Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency The Honourable James Wapakhabulo,\r\nSecond Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Uganda.\r\nMr. Wapakhabulo (Uganda): On behalf of the\r\nUganda delegation, I wish to congratulate you,\r\nMr. President, on your election to preside over the\r\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are\r\nconfident that, under your able leadership, we shall\r\nachieve the objectives of our deliberations. Let me also\r\nthank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the\r\nexcellent leadership he has provided to the United\r\nNations during a very trying and difficult year.\r\nMy country attaches great importance to the\r\ncentrality of the United Nations in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and in fostering\r\ninternational development cooperation. In that regard,\r\nUganda hopes that this session of the General\r\nAssembly will focus on the critical reform of the\r\nUnited Nations to meet the new challenges to\r\nmultilateralism.\r\nTerrorism has reached epic proportions as a threat\r\nto international peace and security. Particularly since\r\n11 September, terrorist organizations have\r\nindiscriminately attacked, killed and maimed thousands\r\nof innocent civilians in Asia, the Middle East, Africa,\r\nEurope and the Americas. In northern Uganda, a\r\nterrorist organization called the Lords Resistance Army\r\nhas killed hundreds, displaced thousands and abducted\r\nchildren into forced recruitment and sale in slavery.\r\nOn 19 August, the terrorists chose to strike at the\r\nheart of the United Nations. They attacked the United\r\nNations offices in Baghdad. That callous attack led to\r\nthe death of innocent Iraqis and many members of the\r\nUnited Nations staff, including the Secretary-General’s\r\nSpecial Representative, Sergio Vieira de Mello. On\r\nbehalf of the Government and people of Uganda, I wish\r\nto express sincere condolences to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and to the bereaved families. We must\r\ncondemn those acts of terrorism in the strongest terms,\r\nand the international community must unite to fight\r\nthis scourge. Under no circumstances should\r\nindiscriminate use of violence be justified.\r\nWe must acknowledge that the emergence of new\r\nthreats such as terrorism and weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, combined with genocide and the massive\r\nviolation of human rights, poses a clear and present\r\nchallenge to the United Nations.\r\nMy country, therefore, shares the view of the\r\nSecretary-General that the time has come to examine\r\nthe fundamental policy issues and structural\r\nmechanisms that may be needed to deal with these new\r\nchallenges. We support his proposal to establish a\r\ngroup of eminent persons to make recommendations\r\nregarding the necessary reforms of the Security\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nCouncil and other United Nations institutions and\r\nprocesses.\r\nOn the situation in the Middle East, Uganda\r\nwelcomes the Quartet-led road map for a\r\ncomprehensive settlement. We support the\r\nestablishment of a Palestinian State living side by side\r\nand in peace with Israel, within secure and recognized\r\nborders, in accordance with the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions.\r\nI now turn to the Great Lakes region of Africa.\r\nWe are pleased to note that there have been positive\r\ndevelopments as a result of regional and international\r\nefforts to build peace and stability in the region. In the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Transitional\r\nGovernment of National Unity has been established in\r\naccordance with the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement and\r\nthe related Pretoria and Luanda Agreements, as well as\r\nthe relevant resolutions of the Security Council.\r\nUganda remains committed to supporting the\r\npeace process in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, including ending the Lendu-Hema inter-ethnic\r\nconflict in the Ituri Province. Uganda encouraged the\r\nSecurity Council to establish a robust force of the\r\nUnited Nations Organization Mission in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), under\r\nChapter VII, for peacekeeping operations in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, including the\r\ndisarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation,\r\nresettlement and reintegration of negative forces.\r\nIn that regard, Uganda welcomes Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1493 (2003). My country provided\r\nEntebbe airbase for logistical support to the European\r\nUnion-led stabilization force in Bunia in July, 2003.\r\nWe have also concluded an agreement with MONUC to\r\nutilize Entebbe airbase, as well as the Kasese and Arua\r\nAirports, for United Nations operations in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nWith regard to the situation in Burundi, the\r\nimplementation of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation\r\nAgreement remains on track, under the regional\r\ninitiative presided over by President Museveni of\r\nUganda and facilitated by Deputy President Zuma of\r\nSouth Africa. The African Union mission in Burundi\r\nhas been established. We call upon the international\r\ncommunity, including the Security Council, to provide\r\nthe necessary support for the mission.\r\nOn the situation in the Sudan, the Government of\r\nUganda commends the Government of the Sudan and\r\nthe Sudan People’s Liberation Army for the historic\r\nagreement on security arrangements, signed in\r\nNaivasha, Kenya, last week. We urge the parties to\r\nexpedite the negotiation of the remaining issues so that\r\na comprehensive agreement can be reached. The\r\nrestoration of peace, security and political stability in\r\nthe Sudan is not only good for the long-suffering\r\npeople of that country, but also for Africa as a whole.\r\nUganda particularly welcomed the initiative of\r\nthe Secretary-General to convene a high-level meeting,\r\nwhich adopted the Principles on Good-Neighbourly\r\nRelations and Cooperation between the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda\r\non 25 September. Our countries pledged to refrain from\r\ninterfering directly or indirectly in one another’s\r\ninternal affairs, including making sure that none of the\r\nneighbouring countries’ territory is used to arm, supply\r\nor host any hostile elements or armed groups against\r\nthe other.\r\nThese efforts, aimed at the restoration of peace,\r\nsecurity, political stability and good-neighbourliness,\r\nare not only good for the Great Lakes region, but also\r\nfor Africa and indeed the entire international\r\ncommunity. Uganda strongly believes that these are\r\nnecessary pre-conditions for regional integration and\r\nthe promotion of trade and investment to meet the\r\nneeds of our people. To that end, Uganda welcomes\r\nand supports the forthcoming United Nations\r\nconference on the Great Lakes region.\r\nDespite many commitments already made at\r\nvarious international forums, the international\r\ncommunity has yet to demonstrate sufficient political\r\nwill to mobilize adequate resources to meet the\r\nMillennium Development Goals and to ensure\r\nequitable sharing of the benefits of globalization for\r\nall. The failure of the World Trade Organization\r\nMinisterial Conference, held at Cancún, vividly\r\ndemonstrates this.\r\nSince the Millennium Summit in 2000, important\r\nplans of action, declarations and strategies have been\r\nagreed upon, inter alia, in Brussels, Doha, Monterrey,\r\nJohannesburg and Almaty, for the achievement of\r\nsustainable development and the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. The challenge for the international\r\ncommunity now is to ensure their full and effective\r\nfollow-up and implementation. The international\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\ncommunity must accord special priority to the\r\ndevelopment needs of the landlocked and least\r\ndeveloped countries, in order to facilitate their full\r\nintegration into the global system. Although official\r\ndevelopment assistance will continue to play an\r\nimportant role in development, Uganda regards trade as\r\nthe single most important external source of\r\ndevelopment financing and productivity growth. In this\r\nrespect, the Doha Development Agenda should ensure\r\nthat the least developed countries not only have access\r\nto markets, but also attain capacity to produce\r\ncompetitively for those markets. We call upon the\r\ndeveloped countries to show the necessary flexibility,\r\nespecially on the question of agricultural subsidies, to\r\nallow for the full and timely completion of the\r\ncomprehensive agenda agreed upon at Doha.\r\nThe fifty-seventh United Nations General\r\nAssembly endorsed the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) as a home-grown African\r\nframework for international development cooperation\r\nwithin the continent. We reiterate the call made last\r\nweek from this podium by the current Chairman of the\r\nAfrican Union, President Joachim Chissano of\r\nMozambique, for strong and effective support for\r\nNEPAD by the international community.\r\nIn summary, my country has supported the call\r\nfor collective action against terrorism and weapons of\r\nmass destruction. We have noted the positive\r\ndevelopments in the Great Lakes region and expressed\r\nour commitment to building a peaceful and stable\r\nregion. We have also underscored the need for urgent\r\nand effective implementation of agreed upon plans of\r\naction to meet the Millennium Development Goals and\r\nto assure practical support for NEPAD. Finally, Uganda\r\nhas reaffirmed its full commitment to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to\r\nMr. Rialuth Serge Vohor, Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, External Trade and\r\nTelecommunications of the Republic of Vanuatu.\r\nMr. Vohor (Vanuatu) (spoke in French): Allow\r\nme to convey to this Assembly the heartfelt greetings\r\nof the Government and people of the Republic of\r\nVanuatu. I should like first of all to sincerely\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the\r\nPresidency of the fifty-eight session of the General\r\nAssembly. You have assumed the Presidency at an\r\nextremely difficult, unsettled and complex time. A\r\nseries of regrettable events have imperilled the political\r\nand ideological authority which is the universal\r\nfoundation of the United Nations ability to work for the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security in the world. Given\r\nthe enormity of the challenges that now face us, my\r\ndelegation — and I personally — would like to\r\nsolemnly assure you of our support and full\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe job of the Secretary-General is one of the\r\nmost difficult jobs, in particular when the very\r\nfounding principles of the Organization are being\r\ncompromised or simply discarded in favour of the\r\ninterest of some Members. The Government of Vanuatu\r\nadmires the outstanding authority and clear-sightedness\r\nas well as the diplomatic qualities of Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations. His\r\nwisdom and his persistence have enabled Member\r\nStates to step up their efforts to make the work of the\r\nUnited Nations more effective and better adapted to the\r\nmaintenance of peace throughout the world, while\r\nkeeping the focus on development priorities such as, in\r\nparticular, the small economies of island States such as\r\nVanuatu.\r\nQuite frankly, we are participating in this meeting\r\nsomewhat confused about the future of our\r\nOrganization, since a minority of Powers are\r\ninfluencing the system to advance their own interests\r\nand to the detriment of the principles and mandates\r\nwhich are the prerogatives of the United Nations. The\r\nUnited Nations mission, inter alia, is to work for\r\npeaceful coexistence among peoples and nations. But\r\nthe United Nations is being thwarted because of the\r\nunilateral initiatives of certain Powers. This is the\r\nresponsibility of its Members, and this situation has to\r\nbe addressed in order to restore the central role of the\r\nUnited Nations in conflict settlement.\r\nWe cannot conceive of any unilateral action in the\r\nfuture without the risk of paralysing the Organization\r\nitself. The decline of order and justice and the various\r\nconflicts that are occurring throughout the world are\r\nparticularly disquieting. If the international system\r\ncontinues to be influenced by certain Powers, the\r\nfuture will remain uncertain, notwithstanding the\r\nindividual efforts made by Member States and despite\r\nthe countless resolutions adopted by this Assembly.\r\nIn recent years, the international geopolitical\r\nenvironment has been dramatically shaken.\r\nIrresponsible actions have unleashed much hatred and\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nbitterness, which jeopardizes world peace and\r\nharmony. The fundamental principles that justified the\r\nexistence of the United Nations are now being called\r\ninto question and we are duty-bound explicitly and\r\nclearly to redefine the new objectives and to strengthen\r\nthe founding principles of the United Nations.\r\nMany tragic events have occurred and countless\r\ninnocent lives have been destroyed. These are the facts\r\nof the world today. I would like to take this opportunity\r\nto pay tribute to the members of the Secretariat who\r\ntragically lost their lives in the line of duty and to\r\nconvey condolences to the United Nations Secretariat\r\nas well as to the families of the victims of that brutal\r\nand horrendous act. That barbaric and inhuman act of\r\nviolence saddens us all. I join with previous speakers\r\nin condemning that brutal act.\r\nUnfortunately, some of us have contributed to the\r\ncurrent situation. A brief overview of past events\r\ndefinitely shows that various world conflicts, wars,\r\nfamines, droughts, epidemics, poverty and\r\nenvironmental degradation are on the increase. Many\r\ndeveloping countries are facing a variety of\r\ndevelopment difficulties, such as the increase in\r\nunemployment that contributes to the degradation of\r\nsocieties. In many cases, the destruction of social and\r\ncultural progress, caused by globalization and\r\nmodernization, has increased feelings of hatred and\r\nbitterness. The main outlines for future development\r\nhave been mapped out but the success of the\r\nimplementation of this remains dependant on political\r\nwill, particularly the financial commitments of the\r\nindustrialized countries. However, I am still optimistic\r\nand I trust in your wisdom, Mr. President, to guide us\r\nto a better future.\r\nWhile counter-terrorism and normalization in\r\nsome countries are on the agenda, we should not divert\r\nour attention from the development issues that can\r\nundermine the future of developing countries.\r\nConsiderable resources will be devoted to security\r\nquestions, when only a tiny share of this amount would\r\nbe enough to meet the needs of the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThe environment is another area of concern. We\r\nsupport previous statements by representatives of the\r\nisland States of the Pacific, and we continue to\r\nencourage countries that have not yet done so to ratify\r\nthe Kyoto Protocol as soon as possible.\r\nHow can we explain to our peoples that certain\r\ninternational obligations are priorities only for the\r\nsmall States, whereas the super-Powers seem hardly to\r\nbe concerned about them, or are even hostile to them,\r\nand yet do not hesitate to impose a series of conditions\r\nwhich contribute to the underdevelopment of small\r\nStates and which we could describe as political and\r\neconomic interference?\r\nThe unilateral imposition and maintenance of the\r\nban on the sale of products containing kava in Europe\r\nis an example of this discriminatory attitude. The\r\nEuropean countries involved do not seem to take\r\naccount of the scientific studies establishing the\r\nabsence of any link between kava and kidney disease, a\r\nlink suggested by the health authorities of some\r\nEuropean countries.\r\nThe threat of economic sanctions by the\r\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment (OECD) against tax havens in the\r\nPacific, while excepting European jurisdictions, leaves\r\nno alternative than to accept the conditions imposed\r\nwithout any consideration of the economies concerned.\r\nSince our acceptance in principle of the OECD\r\nconditions we have received no indication from that\r\norganization of any quid pro quo that it can provide in\r\nthe case of economic loss.\r\nDespite the opposition of the Pacific region to the\r\ntransportation of nuclear waste in the waters of our\r\nregion, certain Powers show a complete lack of respect\r\nfor the sovereignty of the small islands States of the\r\nPacific. It is not only a question of the environment and\r\nof protecting our natural resources against any disaster;\r\nit is much more a question of ethics. In other words, we\r\nregret the complete lack of respect for the small island\r\nStates of the Pacific as fully fledged members of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIt is generally recognized today that trade is the\r\nengine of development. However, like other countries\r\nof similar size, Vanuatu is facing certain tariff and non-\r\ntariff restrictions which are causing our agricultural\r\nproducts to be inaccessible to, in particular, markets\r\nthat are often described as free.\r\nBringing national laws into line with international\r\nconventions carries costs that are often\r\ndisproportionate for the small countries. In almost all\r\ncases, national resource constraints, financial as well as\r\ntechnical, are ignored, whereas they must be taken into\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\naccount for the success of any programme of action\r\nresulting from international commitments.\r\nWe must not lose sight of the basic principle of\r\nthe right to self-determination. We reiterate that the\r\ncredibility of the United Nations rests on following up\r\nthe implementation of any reform aimed at recognizing\r\nthe right of peoples to self-determination, in the\r\ncontext of respect for others and for the United Nations\r\nCharter. We therefore applaud the efforts by the\r\nGovernment of Indonesia to open and maintain\r\ndialogue with the various social and minority\r\nconstituents, as well as those in West Papua, in respect\r\nfor human rights and freedom of expression.\r\nWe welcome the positive role and efforts of\r\nAustralia and New Zealand, after an unprecedented\r\ndecision by the countries of the region, to restore and\r\nmaintain order, security and peace in the region, and in\r\nparticular in the Solomon Islands.\r\nWe applaud the French President, Mr. Jacques\r\nChirac, for having initiated a summit meeting of heads\r\nof State and Government of the South Pacific region,\r\nheld last July, in order to strengthen our cooperation.\r\nI trust in your wisdom, Mr. President, to make\r\nsure that all the theories expounded in the Assembly\r\nare followed by concrete, practical action. We have a\r\nduty to work collectively through the multilateral\r\ninstitutions to help resolve and overcome the\r\ndifficulties and challenges that face us. In order to do\r\nthat, we need to constantly review the very structure of\r\nthe United Nations. The various unilateral initiatives\r\nhave highlighted the limits of the current structure\r\nwhich have caused a weakening of the multilateral\r\napproach. Many super-Powers are unwilling to share\r\neven a part of their authority within the United Nations\r\nand seem to prefer the status quo. The principles of\r\ndemocratization and transparency advocated by most\r\nMembers must be taken into account in the\r\nreorganization and in the Organization’s decision-\r\nmaking process.\r\nMy delegation supports changing the permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council to include Japan\r\nand a representative of the African continent, of the\r\nMiddle East and of the Alliance of Small Island States.\r\nThis reform would give the Organization greater\r\ntransparency, restore confidence in it and improve\r\ninternational cooperation. My delegation strongly\r\nsupports the proposals made, and in particular the\r\nnomination of a group of leaders representing the\r\nvarious regions and the main categories of economies\r\nin order to launch this important proposal. This long\r\nawaited review will finally come about.\r\nWe need to take this great opportunity to renew\r\nand strengthen the United Nations in order to give it\r\nthe qualities it needs to meet the challenges of our\r\ntime. Strengthening the cohesion and unity of our great\r\ncommunity of nations will be a daunting challenge, one\r\nwhich we are prepared to meet, while offering our\r\ncomplete and unconditional support.\r\nWe have aired our concerns in order to stress the\r\ninjustices and contradictions in the current situation,\r\nbut we assure the Organization of our support and our\r\ncommitment to seeing the Organization revitalized,\r\ncapable of meeting the aspirations of all its Members,\r\nwhether large or small, rich or poor, strong or weak.\r\nThe contradictions of principle, mounting\r\nterrorism, human suffering, and the emergence of\r\nconflicts in regions that are normally peaceful,\r\ncombined with the injustices of globalization, are all\r\ningredients for a future catastrophe.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation remains convinced\r\nthat only a reinvigorated United Nations can contribute\r\nin a lasting manner to world peace and security.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Yousef Bin Al-Alawi Bin Abdulla,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Sultanate of Oman.\r\nMr. Abdulla (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): Allow\r\nme, Sir, on behalf of the Sultanate of Oman, to\r\ncongratulate you on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session. We assure you of our\r\nreadiness to work with you and to contribute sincerely\r\nand successfully to the achievement of the noble goals\r\nwe all seek to accomplish in the service of humanity,\r\nand to the safety and security of the international\r\ncommunity. I also take this opportunity to express our\r\nheartfelt thanks to your predecessor, His Excellency\r\nMr. Jan Kavan, who presided over the previous session,\r\nfor his efforts to guarantee the success of the regular\r\nsession and the special sessions held during the past\r\nyear.\r\nLet me also acknowledge the tireless and serious\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to\r\npromote the leading role of the United Nations in the\r\nfield of international peace and security.\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nOnce again, we stress the Sultanate of Oman’s\r\nsupport for the Organization in its endeavours to\r\nachieve the purposes and principles of the Charter.\r\nAt the outset, I should like to shed some light on\r\nthe measures taken by my country to develop its\r\nimportant institutions, particularly the judiciary. It is\r\nour strong belief that a fair and just judiciary forms the\r\nbasis for social and economic development. In our\r\ncontemporary history, the Sultanate of Oman has\r\nenabled the judiciary to become the most important\r\nmeans of establishing justice, issuing fair rulings and\r\nremoving injustices in society, without interference by\r\nthe Executive branch or by any other branch of\r\nGovernment. That development was endorsed in the\r\nconstitutional State system enacted by His Majesty\r\nSultan Qaboos Bin Said through decree 101/96, issued\r\non 6 November 1996.\r\nHis Majesty also issued decree 90/99, which\r\nenacted the law granting full independence to the\r\njudiciary, on 21 November 1999. That law regulates the\r\njurisdiction and the functions of courts of various\r\ncircuits and at various levels. Moreover, the Supreme\r\nCourt was established at the top of the judicial\r\npyramid, with competence to standardize legal\r\nprinciples and to address faulty rulings. That was\r\nfollowed by a series of laws organizing various judicial\r\norgans, including a law establishing the higher judicial\r\nsystem. Additionally, a draft law on civil and trade\r\nprocedures has been elaborated.\r\nAll of the aforementioned demonstrates His\r\nMajesty’s interest in guaranteeing the well-being of the\r\nOmani citizen and in ensuring that all citizens are\r\nfamiliar with their rights and obligations, which are\r\nguaranteed through the right to due process.\r\nIn the spirit of continued development and\r\nbroadened participation by the Omani people in our\r\nsocial and economic development programmes, my\r\ncountry — since the dawn of the blessed renaissance\r\nthat began in 1970 at the initiative of His Majesty\r\nSultan Qaboos Bin Said and that has continued\r\nthroughout the past 33 years — has adopted an\r\napproach utilizing the experience and expertise of\r\nOmani citizens in the Majlis al-Shura, or Consultative\r\nCouncil, which includes positive aspects of our cultural\r\nheritage in the modern development of the Sultanate.\r\nOur Consultative Council process has witnessed a\r\nqualitative shift and an important transformation in our\r\nmodern history. His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said\r\nissued royal instructions in October 2002 expanding\r\nthe base of popular participation in elections for the\r\nOmani Consultative Council by granting every citizen,\r\nmale or female, over the age of 21, the right to vote and\r\nto participate in the next election — scheduled for\r\n4 October — to select the 83 members of the\r\nConsultative Council for its fifth session, from 2004 to\r\n2006. That step complements previous steps aimed at\r\ndeveloping the Consultative Council. Those important\r\ndevelopments in the Sultanate of Oman will create a\r\nstrong foundation for more development and\r\nadvancement programmes to benefit the Omani people.\r\nWe have followed recent developments in\r\nPalestine with grave concern. The Palestinian National\r\nAuthority responded positively to the international\r\ncommunity’s demands by accepting the road map —\r\nconsidered the most important document in the history\r\nof the Arab-Israeli conflict — which embodies the\r\ninternational commitment to establishing an\r\nindependent, sovereign Palestinian State alongside the\r\nState of Israel. Nevertheless, the cycle of violence\r\nbetween the Palestinians and the Israeli Government\r\ncontinues unabated, which may doom the entire peace\r\nprocess, plunging it into a dark abyss from which it\r\ncould be very difficult to rescue it. Therefore, the\r\nQuartet — sponsor of the road map — must shoulder\r\nits international responsibilities in that regard.\r\nOne might well wonder how peace can be\r\nachieved between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples\r\nwhen the Israeli Government has decided in principle\r\nto expel President Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the\r\nPalestinian Authority and elected leader of the\r\nPalestinian people. One might also ask whether the\r\nGovernment of Israel, a Member State of the United\r\nNations, is honouring its commitments under the\r\nCharter. The United Nations must intervene to put an\r\nend to that Israeli policy. Israel must respond to the\r\ninternational community’s demands and must comply\r\nwith international resolutions. It must respond\r\npositively to international efforts aimed at\r\nimplementation of the road map, which provides both\r\nparties with international guarantees aimed at\r\nachieving peace based on the establishment of an\r\nindependent, sovereign Palestinian State on all\r\nPalestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967.\r\nSuch a solution would give the States in the region a\r\nhistoric opportunity to build a new Middle East. In that\r\nconnection, we must warn that failure to commit to the\r\nestablishment of a Palestinian State in conformity with\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nthe road map would create a crisis with catastrophic\r\nresults.\r\nMy country shares with many other Member\r\nStates the view that peace in the Middle East region\r\nwill not be true and lasting unless our approach is just\r\nand comprehensive. In that connection, the Sultanate of\r\nOman reaffirms its support for Lebanon’s right to\r\nrestore the remaining Sheba’a farms and the Syrian\r\nArab Republic’s right to recover the Syrian Golan,\r\noccupied on 4 June 1967.\r\nThe war against Iraq in the first half of this year\r\nwas only one link in the chain of wars that have been\r\nendured by the Middle East region. That war created a\r\nnew reality, characterized mainly by the collapse of the\r\nformer regime, the creation of a huge political and\r\nsecurity vacuum and deterioration in basic services for\r\nIraqi society. The continued lack of security in Iraq and\r\nthe resulting loss of lives — in addition to the\r\ndestruction of the United Nations Office and the\r\nescalation in assassinations — certainly do not help\r\nIraq in this phase of re-establishing the Government\r\nand rebuilding the country.\r\nPrompted by our concern about the situation in\r\nIraq, we believe that efforts are needed to enable the\r\nIraqis to assume full responsibility for managing their\r\ncountry. Iraq has an abundance of national experts in\r\nevery field. These qualified Iraqi cadres are capable of\r\nleading the process of restoring security and of\r\nrebuilding and fully developing their country. Iraq also\r\npossesses enormous economic and human resources\r\nthat could help it to regain its strength and to play its\r\nregional and international roles. Undoubtedly, an active\r\nrole for the United Nations and its specialized agencies\r\nwill help us to attain our common objective: unity and\r\nterritorial integrity for Iraq and prosperity and security\r\nfor all its people.\r\nCommitted to Iraq’s sovereignty, territorial\r\nintegrity and unity, we welcomed the formation of the\r\ntransitional Governing Council. We believe it essential\r\nto deal with that political institution so that we begin to\r\nbuild the right foundations for post-war Iraq —\r\nincluding the provision of basic services and the\r\ncreation of a political climate conducive to the\r\nestablishment of a stable political system that will\r\nrespond to the Iraqi people’s wishes — as a prelude to\r\nbeginning the reconstruction phase.\r\nStability and the consolidation of security are\r\nrequirements of all peoples throughout the world. We\r\nin the Sultanate of Oman — like all other countries in\r\nthe Middle East — have been following with interest\r\nand optimism the official contacts taking place in\r\nvarious conflict areas. We hope that the contacts and\r\ndiscussions between the United Arab Emirates and the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran concerning the islands\r\nbelonging to the United Arab Emirates will enable the\r\ntwo countries to arrive at an effective mechanism to\r\nsettle their dispute. In addition, we appreciate the\r\ninitiatives by India and Pakistan aimed at starting a\r\ndialogue between them. Moreover, my country hopes\r\nthat the two Koreas and other concerned parties will be\r\nable to reach an agreement that addresses the various\r\noutstanding issues through constructive dialogue and\r\nadherence to international conventions and resolutions.\r\nWe hope that that part of the world will ultimately\r\nachieve peace and coexistence.\r\nWe also pay tribute to the peaceful efforts to\r\nsolve the conflicts in Africa, and call on the\r\ninternational community to assist in developing a fair\r\nsystem to improve economic conditions and a\r\nmechanism to relieve the onerous burden of debt on\r\nAfrican countries.\r\nInternational policies have in recent years led to\r\nthe emergence of various types of terrorist acts. All of\r\nus must pause and deeply focus on this phenomenon,\r\nwhich targets people’s security and safety. We believe\r\nthat it has become essential to study in a\r\ncomprehensive and cooperative manner the root causes\r\nunderlying this phenomenon. Although we fully\r\nsupport international efforts to combat terrorism by all\r\navailable means, we must allocate part of the massive\r\nfinancial resources devoted to combating terrorism to\r\nhelp the least developed countries that may be fertile\r\nground for terrorist activities.\r\nThere is no doubt that United Nations efforts in\r\nthe field of disarmament are leading nowhere. They\r\nwill remain an exercise in futility so long as Member\r\nStates cannot count on an effective system of collective\r\nsecurity safeguards. Without such a system,\r\nresponsibility for assessments of the level and quality\r\nof weapons needed will be subjective and fall solely to\r\nindividual Governments. This would open the door\r\nwide to further arms races, and hinder progress towards\r\ndisarmament or the reduction of armaments.\r\nWhile supporting the efforts to limit armaments,\r\nthe Sultanate of Oman affirms the need to take\r\npractical measures in accordance with the International\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regime of mutual\r\nguarantees. My country signed a safeguards agreement\r\nwith the IAEA on 28 June 2001 at the headquarters of\r\nthe Agency in Vienna.\r\nMy country also believes that it is essential to\r\npromote cooperation between States to reduce the\r\nillegal trafficking of small arms and light weapons,\r\nwhich are the reason for most of the conflicts in the\r\nworld. My country notes the efforts made by the United\r\nNations to achieve the elimination of all lethal weapons\r\nfrom every corner of the earth and from outer space.\r\nMy country supports all these efforts and underlines\r\nthe responsibility of the international Organization for\r\nestablishing a world order that is more capable of\r\nguaranteeing security for all States in a manner that\r\nreflects the reality of life in the third millennium. It\r\nshould be consistent with partnership and with\r\nresponsibilities, which are essential for the success of\r\nall efforts.\r\nThis session is being convened at a time of\r\ncontinuous and intertwined development at the world\r\neconomic, financial and trade levels. Many economies\r\nstill suffer from economic stagnation and recession.\r\nThe Sultanate of Oman appreciates the continued\r\nefforts of the International Bank, the International\r\nMonetary Fund and the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO) to achieve complementarity in their work so\r\nthat they may confront the challenges that the countries\r\nof the world are now facing. These challenges include\r\neconomic growth, sustainable development, poverty\r\nreduction and financial stability and balance.\r\nMr. Andrianarivelo-Razafy (Madagascar), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nSince its accession to the World Trade\r\nOrganization in October 2000, the Sultanate of Oman\r\nhas taken great strides towards implementing its\r\ncommitments to the Organization. The Sultanate has\r\nintroduced many amendments and improvements to its\r\nsystems, organizations and laws, and has enacted new\r\nlegislation in conformity with the requirements of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization.\r\nMy country has also been following with great\r\ninterest the ongoing negotiations in the framework of\r\nthe World Trade Organization with a view to\r\novercoming the obstacles and difficulties impeding its\r\nwork. Here, we must point an important difference\r\nbetween developing countries and developed countries,\r\nin that the latter control the World Intellectual Property\r\nOrganization agreements and other conventions. Such\r\nagreements should not be misused by multinational\r\ncorporations in a manner that adds to the burdens of the\r\nleast developed countries in the fields of\r\npharmaceuticals, foodstuffs and technology transfer,\r\nwhich would only exacerbate the obstacles to trade\r\nliberalization that the World Trade Organization is\r\ntrying to overcome. Although the WTO Council of\r\nMinisters issued a separate statement on safeguards for\r\npatented drugs, aimed at helping developing countries\r\nto combat serious and contagious diseases, such a step\r\nmay not sufficiently protect least developed countries\r\nfrom being forced to bear excessive costs.\r\nThe Sultanate of Oman has worked hard at the\r\nregional level with its brothers and friends and through\r\nregional economic groupings, to enhance the climate\r\nfor the liberalization of trade and the economy. In the\r\nframework of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the\r\nSultanate participated in the establishment of the Gulf\r\nCustoms Union at the beginning of this year. In the\r\nframework of the Arab League, we have also pushed\r\nforward the deadline for the establishment of a free-\r\ntrade zone among the Arab States parties to the trade\r\nzone agreement to the beginning of January 2005 when\r\nfull liberalization is expected to occur, opening the\r\ndoor to the free trade of Arab products and paving the\r\nway to an Arab common market.\r\nAt the local level, my country has continued its\r\nefforts to enhance the role of the private sector in the\r\nnational economy, based on the market economy and\r\nfree competition and a favourable economic and trade\r\nclimate that aims at the achievement of a true\r\ninvestment and trade partnership with all countries of\r\nthe world, in the hope that conditions will be conducive\r\nto linking the economy of Oman to the world economy.\r\nRecognizing that the protection of the\r\nenvironment and its resources is a collective\r\nresponsibility, my country’s Government has been\r\nactive in stimulating the role of Omani society and its\r\neffective contribution to this cause. Here, we to\r\nreaffirm our commitment to the basic principles\r\nadopted at the two earth summits, in Rio de Janeiro, in\r\n1992, and in South Africa, in 2002. We believe that\r\nthese principles constitute a scientific framework that\r\nwill guarantee our world partnership and help us to\r\nshoulder our collective responsibility for the protection\r\nof the environment and its natural resources in the\r\nservice of sustainable development.\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nWe would like to express our gratitude and\r\nappreciation for the efforts and endeavours of the\r\nSecretary-General as reflected in his annual report, in\r\nwhich he details the achievements of the United\r\nNations, as well as and the obstacles it faces, and sets\r\nout the strategies for the future for this Organization,\r\nwhich embodies the conscience and aspirations of the\r\nworld. We support the proposals in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on developing and restructuring the\r\norgans of the United Nations to enable the\r\nOrganization to reflect current political reality.\r\nThe United Nations should remain a true\r\ncornerstone of world policy and the main source of\r\ninternational legitimacy, so that countries may appeal\r\nto it for the prevention of wars and conflict. This is\r\nonly possible through the effective pursuit of\r\npreventive diplomacy, the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes and the maintenance of peace, enhancing\r\nworld cooperation and dialogue among civilizations.\r\nThis involves working towards resolving the problems\r\nof poverty and disease, protecting the environment,\r\ncombating terrorism and bridging the gap between the\r\nrich countries of the North and the poor countries of\r\nthe South.\r\nRelations between the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security should be strengthened\r\nthrough the enhancement of weak regional structures to\r\nenable them to archive collective security in a world\r\ngoverned by technology and great population increases.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations represents\r\ninternational legitimacy. It is the crucible in which all\r\nregional and international efforts meld to realize the\r\nhopes and aspirations of our peoples and to confront\r\nthe real challenges to peace, security and development\r\nin all their aspects. This can enhance relations and\r\nstability and spread a culture of peace and constructive\r\ndialogue among present and future generations to\r\ncounter the logic of the threat of force or apprehensions\r\nabout the future.\r\nWe hope that this session will be a success so that\r\nit may chart a vision for the future that points to ways\r\nto serve humanity and renew the Member States’ trust\r\nin the Organization, total commitment to the\r\nimplementation of its resolutions and respect for the\r\nprovisions of the Charter.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I give\r\nthe floor to Mr. Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kenya.\r\nMr. Musyoka (Kenya): I am pleased to take this\r\nopportunity to address the General Assembly. In the\r\npast year both Kenya and the United Nations have been\r\nstruck by terrorism. On behalf of my delegation, I wish\r\nto convey to the Secretary-General, through you,\r\nMr. President, our profound condolences following the\r\nheartless and senseless attack on United Nations\r\npremises in Baghdad last August. Several United\r\nNations personnel, including Mr. Sergio Vieira de\r\nMello, the Secretary-General’s Special Representative\r\nin Iraq, lost their lives during this attack. Mr. Vieira de\r\nMello — an elegant, highly intelligent man — was a\r\ncalm voice of reason in a sea of troubles. As an\r\nassembly of nations, we may have lost his voice, but\r\nwe should not lose sight of his vision and hopes.\r\nTerrorism has become a disturbing trend. We who\r\nlive in Kenya know this all too well, as we do not have\r\nthe option of ignoring the threat of terror. The people\r\nof Kenya have been targeted by terrorists on two\r\nrecent, separate occasions — in 1998 and in 2002.\r\nAfter the 2002 attacks in Mombasa, Kenya’s economy\r\nwas almost brought to its knees because of the various\r\nunhelpful measures from without that discouraged\r\ntravel to our country. As a result, we have been doubly\r\nvictimized. Against this backdrop, Kenya is totally\r\ncommitted to the fight against terrorism, as we have\r\nbeen subjected to the loss of innocent lives, untold\r\nhuman suffering, loss of property and social and\r\neconomic hardship. We empathize with others,\r\nincluding the residents of this city and, indeed, the\r\nAmerican people, who bore the brunt of unprecedented\r\nterror in the September 2001 attack.\r\nWe are convinced that this fight can be won only\r\nby collective action by the community of nations. We\r\nshould all address terrorism under the rubric of the\r\nUnited Nations and develop measured, long-term\r\nstrategies to eliminate terrorism once and for all. Self-\r\ninterest and unilateral action do not provide a firm\r\nbasis for a global alliance against terrorism. Only\r\nprincipled international solidarity will defeat terrorism.\r\nMy delegation wishes to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the efforts made in enhancing the\r\nutilization of the United Nations Office at Nairobi. I\r\nnote with satisfaction that construction of additional\r\nadministration and social facilities at the United\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nNations Complex at Gigiri has commenced. Further,\r\nfollowing the elevation of the United Nations Centre\r\nfor Human Settlements (UN-Habitat) to a fully fledged\r\nUnited Nations programme, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 56/206, it is the desire of\r\nthe Government of Kenya to see maximum utilization\r\nof those facilities through the hosting of additional\r\nmeetings and conferences in Nairobi. This will be a\r\nclear demonstration of our support for the relevant\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions on this issue.\r\nThe proliferation of small arms and light weapons\r\nhas contributed to the conflicts raging in many parts of\r\nAfrica. Kenya has been actively involved in efforts to\r\naddress this issue and hosts the Nairobi Secretariat on\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons, a regional initiative\r\ninvolving 10 countries of the Great Lakes region and\r\nthe Horn of Africa. In addition, at the Biennial Meeting\r\nof States on small arms and light weapons, held in New\r\nYork in July 2003, Kenya presented a report on the\r\nactivities of the Nairobi Secretariat as well as on the\r\nmeasures undertaken by the Government of Kenya at\r\nthe national level to curb that menace. In this regard,\r\nwe call upon the international community to provide\r\nthe requisite resources in our joint effort to fight the\r\nproliferation of such arms.\r\nWars and conflicts continue, and peace, stability\r\nand socio-economic development remain elusive,\r\nparticularly in Africa. Kenya therefore continues to\r\ngive priority to the prevention, management and\r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts. We have spearheaded\r\nthe Inter-Government Authority on Development\r\n(IGAD) peace processes on the conflicts in southern\r\nSudan and in Somalia. Negotiations on a peaceful\r\nsolution are ongoing in both Naivasha and Nairobi,\r\nrespectively.\r\nIt is with profound satisfaction that we recall the\r\nhistoric event that occurred on 22 September of this\r\nyear, when the warring parties in the Sudan signed a\r\ntruly landmark agreement in Naivasha, Kenya. That\r\nagreement, which addresses transitional security\r\narrangements, will no doubt provide the basis for a\r\nbright and prosperous future for the people of the\r\nSudan. The parties will reconvene in the next two\r\nweeks to discuss power sharing, wealth sharing and the\r\nstatus of the three disputed regions of the Sudan.\r\nIndeed, the peace process in the Sudan has become\r\nirreversible.\r\nI therefore wish to pay tribute to the Government\r\nof the Sudan, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement\r\n(SPLM), the Sudanese People’s Liberation Army\r\n(SPLA), IGAD and the international Partners Forum\r\nfor their concerted efforts and dedication to the peace\r\nprocess. This historic event is a concrete example of\r\nmultilateralism at work. It is indeed a beacon of hope\r\nand a manifestation of the fact that, with goodwill and\r\npolitical will, peace is achievable. I am happy to say\r\nthat not all news emanating from Africa is all about\r\ndoom and gloom.\r\nHowever, in order to consolidate and guarantee a\r\nlong-lasting peace, it is vital for the international\r\ncommunity to play a greater role in the process. In this\r\nconnection, I would like to urge the United Nations to\r\nplay a leadership role in the post-conflict\r\nreconstruction of the Sudan and to request Member\r\nStates to support that reconstruction.\r\nOn the Somali peace process, I am happy to note\r\nthat there is encouraging progress in the negotiations,\r\nand we are hopeful that there will be a fruitful\r\noutcome. Just two weeks ago, representatives adopted\r\nthe charter, and elections will soon be held. Kenya\r\ntherefore encourages the parties concerned to\r\nconsolidate and take advantage of the gains made so\r\nfar. We emphasize that the peace process should be all-\r\ninclusive, and we call upon the President of the\r\nTransitional National Government, Mr. Abdikassim, to\r\nreturn to the negotiating table in Nairobi and on the\r\nother faction leaders to accept his participation. By the\r\nsame token, we call upon our partners and the\r\ninternational community to continue supporting both\r\npeace processes.\r\nWe commend the efforts made by the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) to\r\nrestore normalcy in Liberia. While appreciating the\r\nimportant role the United Nations plays in\r\nconsolidating peace and stability in the world, Kenya\r\nadvocates greater United Nations participation in\r\nAfrican initiatives, such as the peace processes led by\r\nIGAD and ECOWAS.\r\nWe are concerned at the continuing deterioration\r\nof the situation in the Middle East. Kenya notes with\r\nregret that a lasting solution to the question of\r\nPalestine remains elusive despite the various initiatives\r\nundertaken and efforts made to address the problem.\r\nWe should not lose sight of the objective of\r\nestablishing a viable Palestinian State, as envisaged in\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nUnited Nations resolutions. Similarly, it should be\r\nrecalled that, in order to ensure a durable solution to\r\nthe conflict, it is important to take full account of the\r\nright of Israel to exist within safe and secure borders.\r\nWe therefore reiterate our call to the parties to the\r\nconflict, as well as to the other players involved, to\r\nexercise restraint and to give priority to dialogue.\r\nAnother area of concern in the Middle East is\r\nIraq. The people of that country have yet to find peace\r\nand stability, without which any hope of national\r\nreconstruction will be in vain. It is, however,\r\nencouraging to observe that the international\r\ncommunity now shares the common view that the\r\nUnited Nations should play a greater role in rebuilding\r\nthat country. It is our hope that that consensus will be\r\ntranslated into action soon.\r\nFor peace and stability to flourish, good\r\ngovernance is a necessity. This challenge is one that\r\nKenya has been able to meet. In December 2002,\r\nKenya saw a historic moment, when we held general\r\nelections which were universally recognized as free,\r\nfair and, indeed, democratic. Every citizen of Kenya\r\nwas provided an opportunity to have a voice in\r\ndetermining his or her Government, successful and\r\nstrong evidence that Africans can and will embrace\r\ndemocracy and that we, the proud descendants of the\r\noldest civilizations in history, are ready to determine\r\nour destiny. I would like to recall the words of a great\r\nson of Africa, the late Patrice Lumumba:\r\n“History will one day have its say ... Africa will\r\nwrite its own history, and it will be to the north\r\nand to the south of the Sahara, a history of glory\r\nand dignity”.\r\nWe are prepared as a country, under the\r\nleadership of President Mwai Kibaki, to play our part\r\nin promoting development and democracy.\r\nThe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) commands the support of all of us and, if\r\nimplemented in a holistic manner, it will guarantee\r\nsustainable development for the African continent.\r\nNEPAD is a symbol of renewed commitment by the\r\nregion’s States, and should thus be accorded the\r\nnecessary support by the international community. We\r\nappreciate the warm reception accorded to NEPAD by\r\nboth the United Nations and our development partners.\r\nWe are committed to the successful implementation of\r\nthis arrangement. For its part, Kenya, which is a\r\nmember of the Steering Committee, has established a\r\nNational NEPAD Secretariat and will host a regional\r\nsummit on NEPAD for East Africa, the Great Lakes\r\nand the Horn of Africa next month to take stock of its\r\nimplementation.\r\nThe United Nations conferences and summits of\r\nthe 1990s, particularly the Rio Summit, the Millennium\r\nSummit, the special session of the General Assembly\r\non HIV/AIDS, the Monterrey Conference and, finally,\r\nthe Johannesburg Summit, have equipped us with\r\nnumerous ideas and commitments to tackle the\r\nproblems facing the world today. Despite this wealth of\r\nideas and commitments, we have continued to slip\r\nbackwards in the fight against poverty, disease,\r\nilliteracy, environmental degradation and hunger.\r\nMy message to all of us today is that we must\r\nrecommit ourselves; let us implement what we have\r\nagreed on to make the world a better place for all. We\r\nwelcome the adoption by the Assembly of resolution\r\n57/270 B on the integrated and coordinated follow-up\r\nto the implementation of United Nations conferences\r\nand summits in the economic and social fields. We urge\r\nall stakeholders identified in this resolution to play\r\ntheir part to ensure its full and speedy implementation.\r\nThe majority of African countries are among the\r\npoorest in the world. The situation has been\r\ncompounded by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which has\r\nravaged the continent and reversed the socio-economic\r\ngains made since independence. To counter the ravages\r\nof the pandemic, the Kenya Government has put in\r\nplace various measures to curb further spread of HIV/\r\nAIDS. As a result of these efforts, prevalence rates\r\nhave been significantly reduced in the last four years.\r\nHowever, much still needs to be done in this area.\r\nLast month, Kenya hosted the thirteenth\r\nInternational Conference on AIDS and Sexually-\r\nTransmitted Diseases. This forum brought together\r\nover 6,000 delegates from all over the world to discuss\r\nurgent measures that we all must take to combat the\r\npandemic. We call upon the international community to\r\nintensify its efforts in fighting the scourge by, among\r\nothers things, the provision of adequate financial\r\nresources, as well as enhanced access to antiretroviral\r\ndrugs, for those infected.\r\nWe welcome the recent agreement arrived at in\r\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) enabling\r\ndeveloping countries to import HIV/AIDS generic\r\ndrugs. We urge developed countries and drug\r\nmanufacturers to respect the decision of the WTO and\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nto cooperate with developing countries to facilitate\r\naccessibility of antiretroviral drugs to all HIV/AIDS\r\nsufferers.\r\nKenya regrets the collapse of the WTO\r\nMinisterial Conference in Cancún last month.\r\nHowever, we in the developing world are ready to\r\ncontinue with negotiations as long as our partners are\r\nprepared to work with us as equal players.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to extend to Assembly\r\nPresident Mr. Julian Hunte, on behalf of my delegation,\r\ncongratulations on his unanimous election as President\r\nof the fifty-eighth regular session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe challenges that I have addressed today have\r\nno respect for boundaries or sovereignty or, indeed,\r\nhistorical realities. They represent a collective problem\r\nfor this Assembly and one that we must face together\r\nas an international organization. It is my hope that the\r\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly will\r\naddress with courage the issues before the international\r\ncommunity. I wish to assure the Assembly President of\r\nthe full support of the Kenyan delegation.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on Mr. Seyoum Mesfin, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Federal Democratic Republic of\r\nEthiopia.\r\nMr. Mesfin (Ethiopia): It gives me great pleasure\r\nto extend to Julian Hunte warm congratulations on his\r\nelection as President of the fifty-eighth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I wish also to take this opportunity\r\nto commend his predecessor for his invaluable\r\ncontribution to the success of the fifty-seventh session\r\nof the Assembly. Allow me also to extend my sincere\r\nappreciation to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nfor the great effort he has been making to maintain the\r\nintegrity of the United Nations in this difficult period\r\nin the history of the Organization. I wish also to\r\ncommend the Secretary-General for his invaluable\r\ncontribution in enhancing humanitarian assistance,\r\nfostering development cooperation and strengthening\r\nour esteemed Organization.\r\nI wish to preface my brief statement with sincere\r\nappreciation for all those who have responded with\r\ngenerous support to assist the people of Ethiopia to\r\novercome the consequences of a devastating and\r\nextended drought, which put at risk more than a dozen\r\nmillion of our compatriots. The responses from the\r\nUnited Nations, the United States, the European Union\r\nand many others were indeed as timely, as they were\r\ngenerous. The people of Ethiopia are grateful for this\r\ndemonstration of solidarity.\r\nWe in Ethiopia are the first to realize that this\r\nstate of affairs in our country cannot continue. Our\r\npeople cannot be allowed to be vulnerable to famine\r\nevery other year because of drought. It is a must for us,\r\nand a matter of national survival and dignity, to ensure\r\nfood security for our people in the shortest time\r\npossible. But this can be done only when our people\r\nare given respite for peace and are able to fully\r\nconcentrate on economic development.\r\nWe have come to be convinced that, for our\r\nstrategy on economic development and good\r\ngovernance to succeed, we need to enhance our\r\ncapacity in human resources development and\r\ninstitution-building. It is imperative for us to focus on\r\ncapacity-building and to make it a priority.\r\nIt has also been found critical that we expand\r\nfurther our decentralization exercise, with a view to\r\nempowering our people at the grass-roots level.\r\nWe have embarked on a fundamental shift in the\r\ncountry’s foreign and national security policy, focusing\r\non the internal needs of our country and on ensuring its\r\nviability, which can be realized only through rapid\r\neconomic development and the nurturing of democratic\r\ngovernance.\r\nLike many countries in our continent, and\r\nperhaps more than most, Ethiopia has suffered at length\r\nas the result of conflict and war and its consequences.\r\nThe internal causes of the absence of peace and\r\ntranquillity in our country were removed, once and for\r\nall, when the military dictatorship came to an end and\r\nwhen we embarked upon laying the foundations for a\r\ndemocratic and just society 12 years ago.\r\nUntil 1998, Ethiopia made great progress that, if\r\ncontinued, would certainly have made us far more\r\nprepared to withstand the consequences of the extended\r\ndrought last year and the year before. But the\r\nAssembly recalls what befell Ethiopia in 1998. The\r\nstrong momentum we had managed to create for rapid\r\neconomic development was pushed off track by the\r\naggression we suffered in May 1998, which took us\r\ntwo years to reverse. Having reversed the aggression,\r\nEthiopia showed its unflinching respect for the\r\nprinciples of international law by taking the lead in\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nensuring the signing of the Algiers Agreement. With\r\nlittle hesitation, Ethiopia withdrew from territory that it\r\nhad seized in a counteroffensive to expel the invading\r\narmy from its territory and to make room for the\r\nTemporary Security Zone, to which the United Nations\r\nMission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) was\r\nsubsequently deployed.\r\nWe have now come to the point at which the\r\nUnited Nations will have to take greater interest to\r\nensure that the hopes and promises engendered by the\r\nAlgiers Agreement are fulfilled. The Agreement was\r\ndesigned to lead to durable peace between Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea. It was not meant to punish the victim of\r\naggression. This is why Ethiopia has felt it necessary to\r\ncall on the Security Council to help us achieve the\r\nhopes implicit in the Algiers Agreement.\r\nEthiopia is committed always to being a peaceful\r\ncountry. We have always been second to none in our\r\ncommitment to the principles of international law. This\r\nwill remain one of our people’s distinguishing features.\r\nThis is a tradition we will continue to maintain and\r\nfoster. This is also how we intend to tackle the present\r\ncomplications in the implementation of the Algiers\r\nAgreement.\r\nFew regions of the world have suffered as a result\r\nof conflict as much as the Horn of Africa. We in\r\nEthiopia are committed, along with others in our\r\nsubregion, to change this existing reality. With the\r\nprogress that continues to be made in the peace process\r\nto resolve the conflict in Somalia, we are today more\r\nhopeful than ever that the long saga of the Somali\r\npeople might be about to end.\r\nI wish to seize this opportunity to thank the\r\nEuropean Union, the United Nations and others for the\r\ninvaluable assistance that they have continued to give\r\nto ensure the success of the peace process in Somalia.\r\nLittle progress could have been made without that\r\nsupport. The frontline countries of the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\r\nwill need even greater support for the success of the\r\npeace process in Somalia, which is now entering into\r\nits most critical phase.\r\nWe are also deeply encouraged by the peace\r\nprocess aimed at resolving the conflict in the Sudan,\r\nwhich has also entered into a very delicate phase. The\r\nparties deserve to be commended for the great resolve\r\nthey are demonstrating in addressing the common\r\nchallenges they are facing. The Framework Agreement\r\non Security Arrangements for the Interim Period,\r\nsigned on 25 September between the two parties,\r\nrepresents a major breakthrough, which will no doubt\r\nhelp lay the foundation for more progress in other\r\nareas. We would like to thank all those, the United\r\nStates Government in particular, who have made\r\ncontributions to the progress that has been made in the\r\npeace process in the Sudan.\r\nThese developments show that the situation in the\r\nHorn of Africa is not hopeless. The challenges we are\r\nfacing are nonetheless formidable. We in Ethiopia are\r\ndetermined to contribute more than our share to assist\r\nin the regeneration of our subregion, which has also\r\nbeen the target of international terrorism. The\r\nachievement of peace and national reconciliation in\r\nSomalia is extremely critical in the fight against this\r\nscourge as well. That is why all those who are willing\r\nto join in the fight against international terrorism\r\nshould be automatically supportive of the peace effort\r\nby IGAD in Somalia.\r\nAs a country from a region that has lost much and\r\nhas stayed far behind in development because of the\r\nabsence of peace, Ethiopia feels solidarity with all the\r\npeoples of the Middle East who yearn for peace,\r\nsecurity and justice. As a people very close to the\r\nMiddle East, Ethiopia has close affinity with the people\r\nof Palestine and with the people of Israel. It is our hope\r\nthat the suffering of both will end soon and that the\r\nhope held up by the road map will be realized.\r\nThe hope we have for economic development and\r\nthe prospect we see for peace in our subregion can\r\nhardly be made a reality without international\r\nconditions that are conducive to countries such as\r\nEthiopia to make progress.\r\nIn this respect, the general situation is not very\r\npromising. Under the circumstances, without greater\r\ncommitment by the developed world to the rapid\r\neconomic development of Africa, countries such as\r\nEthiopia will hardly be in a position to meet the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nThere is, without any doubt, an urgent need for\r\nincreasing the quality and the level of assistance by the\r\ndeveloped world to Africa. There is a critical need for\r\naddressing the problems surrounding issues related to\r\nsubsidies and the access of products from African\r\ncountries to developed countries’ markets.\r\nInternational solidarity and the promotion of our\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nmutual interests make it imperative that a lasting\r\nsolution is found to the debt burden.\r\nAfrica is passing through a very difficult and\r\ncritical period. The HIV/AIDS pandemic is wreaking\r\nhavoc in the continent. As is now widely\r\nacknowledged, this is not simply a health crisis. The\r\npandemic is also an economic, security and social\r\ncrisis with broad and potentially devastating\r\nimplications. Hence, this is a challenge not only for\r\nAfrica, but also for the entire world.\r\nBut Africa is not asking to be rescued by the\r\ninternational community without discharging its own\r\nresponsibilities. What Africa is asking is to be given a\r\nbreak, as many have been given in the past at some\r\npoint in their history. In fact, what is involved here are\r\nmutual obligations. This is the overriding principle\r\nupon which the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) is based. It is Ethiopia’s hope\r\nthat NEPAD will be taken more seriously as a\r\nframework for expanding the cooperation between\r\nAfrica and the developed countries in the interest of\r\nensuring success in Africa’s fight for prosperity and\r\ndevelopment, and for a safe, peaceful and truly\r\nglobalized world.\r\nThe United Nations is facing today one of the\r\nmost difficult periods in its close to 60 years of history.\r\nIts legitimacy and credibility is being increasingly\r\nquestioned. Many have also questioned its\r\neffectiveness. Not a few have also wondered on many\r\noccasions whether they have always been assisted by\r\nthe Organization in nurturing and fostering peace. My\r\nown country has also been disappointed in the past. But\r\nwe have never abandoned hope in the United Nations\r\nor in multilateralism, because we know, at the end of\r\nthe day, that the United Nations is indispensable. That\r\nis why Ethiopia will always be committed to the United\r\nNations and its ideals.\r\nIt is our hope that all Member States, big and\r\nsmall, will be fully committed to the United Nations\r\nand its ideals and carry out the long overdue reform of\r\nthe Organization with a view to making it more\r\neffective.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Antanas Valionis,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\r\nLithuania.\r\nMr. Valionis (Lithuania): I would like first of all\r\nto express my sincere gratitude to Mr. Jan Kavan for\r\nhis work as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nprevious session. We appreciate the knowledge and\r\nskilful leadership of the current President, Mr. Julian R.\r\nHunte of Saint Lucia, and wish him a year of\r\nconstructive dialogue and cooperation.\r\nThis year was one of shocking news and human\r\ntragedy. We lost a noble man and a distinguished\r\ndiplomat, our friend Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, and\r\nmany others who happened to be on duty at the United\r\nNations premises on that tragic day in Baghdad. More\r\nrecently, we paid a final tribute to Ms. Anna Lindh, the\r\nlate Swedish Foreign Minister and our good friend,\r\nwho fell victim to another act of human insanity. We\r\ngrieve for those lost, but we also remember their work\r\nand unfinished missions.\r\nIraq is one such example of unfinished business.\r\nThe restoration of sovereignty and the implementation\r\nof a political process leading to the establishment of a\r\nfully representative Government through democratic\r\nelections is our primary goal. State-building, however,\r\nis not an overnight process. Only through coordinated\r\neffort and close international cooperation can we\r\nexpect to rebuild a free and peaceful Iraq. The United\r\nNations, with its unique experience and legitimacy, is\r\nessential to efforts to help the Iraqi people recover their\r\nsovereignty. In Iraq, the first signs of recovery are\r\nalready visible, as demonstrated by the appointment of\r\na Governing Council and the formation of a\r\npreparatory constitutional committee. These positive\r\ndevelopments should be supported and encouraged.\r\nThus we look forward to the forthcoming Madrid\r\nconference, which will address many issues important\r\nto Iraq’s future. International support is indispensable,\r\nand sometimes even critical, to people coping with the\r\nlegacy of a fallen dictatorship.\r\nThe current setbacks in the conflict between\r\nIsrael and the Palestinians must not prevent the\r\nimplementation of the road map. The vision of two\r\nStates living side by side in peace and prosperity\r\nremains the only viable option.\r\nThe real strength of our power as an international\r\ncommunity continues to lie in our resolve to deal\r\ncollectively with critical issues. The recent report of\r\nthe Secretary-General posed hard questions. We need\r\nto find consensus on the conceptual and political\r\nframework for the operation of the United Nations in\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nthe coming decades. Lithuania firmly supports the\r\nUnited Nations as it pursues the goals enshrined in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. We share the view that the\r\nmultilateral institutions must be updated and\r\nreinforced. It is absolutely essential that the United\r\nNations and its principal organs be seen as relevant and\r\neffective. Lithuania is ready to contribute to the goal of\r\nbuilding an international order based on effective\r\nmultilateral institutions and on the fundamental goals\r\nof the United Nations Charter.\r\nLasting peace is our collective responsibility. The\r\nSecurity Council must be able to take a leadership role\r\nin maintaining international peace and security. Thus\r\nLithuania supports substantial reform to ensure a better\r\nand more equitable representation in both categories,\r\npermanent and non-permanent, through the inclusion of\r\nGermany and Japan, as well as certain other leading\r\ncountries from other regions.\r\nLithuania welcomes the intention of the\r\nSecretary-General to establish a high-level panel of\r\neminent personalities to address responses to current\r\nchallenges. The European Convention, which prepared\r\nthe draft European Constitution, is a good example of\r\nhow such fundamental policy questions could be dealt\r\nwith.\r\nRegrettably, terrorism and the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and their means of\r\ndelivery continue to be on the list of our chief security\r\nconcerns. The Thessaloniki European Council\r\nDeclaration on the Non-Proliferation of Weapons of\r\nMass Destruction, and the European Union’s (EU)\r\nbasic principles and action plan against the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction are well-\r\ndefined responses. Lithuania associates itself with them\r\nand will contribute to their implementation. I should\r\nalso like to recall the Hague Code of Conduct Against\r\nBallistic Missile Proliferation, which is yet another\r\nresult of multilateral efforts and is worthy of global\r\nuniversalization.\r\nGlobal stability also requires regional efforts. In\r\nthis context, I would like to note with satisfaction that\r\nnext year Lithuania and other Central and Eastern\r\nEuropean countries will join the EU and NATO, thus\r\nexpanding the zone of stability and democracy in\r\nEurope. Moreover, our accession will have an\r\nimportant positive effect on the nations at the new\r\nborders of the EU and NATO. Lithuania is determined\r\nto continue its good-neighbourly policies and to\r\ndevelop closer relations with its new EU neighbours. I\r\nshould also like to draw attention to Baltic-Caucasus\r\nregional cooperation, which is already developing a\r\nnumber of successful initiatives.\r\nWe are witnessing the willingness to adopt more\r\neffective measures to combat terrorism and weapons of\r\nmass destruction. Invariably, more conventional\r\nchallenges can be dealt with by transparency and\r\nconfidence-building activities. As a new State party to\r\nthe Ottawa Convention, Lithuania is committed to\r\ncontributing practically to its implementation and\r\npromotion. We feel that it is increasingly important to\r\nfacilitate regional dialogue and action that contributes\r\nto the abolition of anti-personnel mines and the\r\nclearing up of old unexploded ordnance. We have\r\nalready started working with interested parties in that\r\nrespect.\r\nDemocracy, the rule of law and respect for human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms are undoubtedly the\r\nmost important in our system of values. In view of the\r\nprocess of globalization, securing this system is a great\r\nchallenge. Such global afflictions as poverty, hunger,\r\nunsustainable development, disastrous massive\r\npandemics and grave violations of human rights raise\r\nbefore us the vital task of standing together in order to\r\nsecure the future of our children.\r\nStable conditions for peace cannot be created\r\nwithout addressing poverty and eradicating social\r\nexclusion. We should, therefore, put all our efforts\r\ntowards achieving the goals that we agreed to in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. Lithuania, as a future member\r\nof the European Union, is also assuming its\r\nresponsibilities as an emerging donor in this regard.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency The Honourable Sir Rabbie\r\nNamaliu, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration\r\nof Papua New Guinea.\r\nSir Rabbie Namaliu (Papua New Guinea): Let\r\nme from the outset congratulate the President of this\r\nfifty-eighth General Assembly on his election. I have\r\nno doubt that his election by the international\r\ncommunity is a recognition of his vast diplomatic skills\r\nand leadership qualities. His election is also\r\nrecognition of the coming of age of small island States.\r\nI also wish to thank his predecessor Mr. Jan Kavan for\r\nhis stewardship of the work of the fifty-seventh\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nPlease allow me also to pay tribute to the United\r\nNations Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan and his\r\nstaff for their dedication and commitment in dealing\r\nwith many pressing international issues that confront\r\nus today.\r\nI join others delegations in expressing our\r\nGovernment’s sincere condolences to the families of\r\nthe United Nations staff, including the late Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello, the former United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, who lost their lives\r\nin Baghdad on 16 August 2003.\r\nThe attacks were barbaric and against the\r\nprinciples of freedom, democracy and peace as\r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. They must be\r\ncondemned in the strongest possible terms.\r\nIn pursuit of our commitments to combat\r\ninternational terrorism, I am happy to report that Papua\r\nNew Guinea has substantially complied with United\r\nNations Security Council resolution 1373 (2001).\r\nOur Parliament recently ratified many of the\r\nconventions and protocols to combat global terrorism.\r\nYesterday, I personally deposited four conventions with\r\nthe Office of the United Nations Secretary-General.\r\nHaving fulfilled these requirements, Papua New\r\nGuinea is now faced with resource constraints and\r\nother challenges to implementing the treaty\r\nobligations. This situation is further exacerbated by\r\nother threats, such as illicit drug trafficking,\r\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons,\r\nsmuggling of humans and money-laundering.\r\nIn the Pacific Islands region, we have taken\r\npositive initiatives to collectively deal with these\r\nthreats. The Nasonini and Biketawa Declarations\r\nagreed to by the Pacific Islands Forum leaders provide\r\nthe framework for cooperation in dealing with these\r\nthreats.\r\nIn the wider Asia/Pacific Region, the Southwest\r\nPacific Dialogue has met twice, in addition to the\r\nannual Bali security meetings, to discuss political and\r\nsecurity issues facing the region. The Dialogue partners\r\ninclude Indonesia, the Philippines, New Zealand,\r\nAustralia, Timor-Leste and Papua New Guinea.\r\nWhilst issues of greater political and security\r\nrisks are of concern to us, the real threat at this stage is\r\nthe proliferation of small arms and light weapons.\r\nSmall arms and light weapons have not only\r\ndestabilized regions, sparked, fuelled and prolonged\r\nconflicts but also obstructed relief programmes,\r\nundermined peace initiatives, exacerbated human rights\r\nabuses, hampered development and fostered a culture\r\nof violence. There are no international treaties or other\r\nlegal instruments for dealing effectively with this\r\ncategory of weapons.\r\nIn this context, Papua New Guinea welcomes the\r\ncall for the immediate and full implementation of the\r\n2001 Plan of Action on small arms aimed at curbing\r\nand eradicating the flow of small arms and light\r\nweapons.\r\nLet me place this in the context of the crisis in\r\nour province of Bougainville where the proliferation of\r\nsmall arms and light weapons contributed to the\r\nprolonging of the conflict in the province.\r\nWith regard to progress in Bougainville, we have\r\ncompleted the second stage of the arms disposal\r\nprogramme, which has been verified by the United\r\nNations. The regional Peace Monitoring Group (PMG)\r\nhas now been wound down and replaced by the\r\nBougainville Transition Team (BTT). With the help of\r\nthe United Nations the Team will maintain logistical\r\nsupport for the peace process and assist in other\r\noperational areas.\r\nI would also like to inform this Assembly that the\r\npeace process under the Bougainville Agreement has\r\nreached the crucial third stage under the constitutional\r\namendments agreed to by the Papua New Guinea\r\nNational Parliament. While there are delays, every\r\nnecessary step is being taken by all parties concerned\r\nto ensure that the momentum built to date is not being\r\nunduly hampered.\r\nMy Government therefore seeks the\r\nunderstanding of the international community,\r\nespecially the members of the Security Council, to help\r\nus fully achieve all tasks agreed to under the\r\nBougainville Peace Agreement. This will signal a win-\r\nwin story for all, the United Nations, our Government\r\nand the people of Bougainville.\r\nI express our Government’s profound\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the invaluable\r\nefforts of the United Nations Political Office in\r\nBougainville (UNPOB), including those of\r\nAmbassador Noel Sinclair.\r\nI also acknowledge and thank our regional\r\nneighbours — Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Solomon\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nIslands, Tonga and Vanuatu, for their immense\r\ncontribution to the peace process.\r\nWith regard to the conflict in the Solomon\r\nIslands, the package of assistance developed and\r\nagreed to by the Pacific Islands foreign ministers and\r\nlater adopted at the Pacific Islands Forum leaders\r\nmeeting in Auckland, New Zealand, last month has\r\nhelped restore peace and normalcy in that country. It\r\nwas undertaken at the request of the Government of the\r\nSolomon Islands under the Biketawa Declaration.\r\nThe Australian-led operation includes the\r\ndeployment of both civilian police and armed\r\npeacekeepers from many of the Pacific island member\r\nStates, including my own. The cooperation among\r\nmember States underlines the strength of regional\r\npeacekeeping, if done properly.\r\nOn the Israeli and Palestinian issue, we were\r\nencouraged by the general positive signs of progress\r\ntowards resolving and securing peace based on the\r\nUnited States-led road map. However, this has\r\ndeteriorated in recent weeks. We call upon all parties\r\ninvolved to exercise maximum restraint and work\r\ntowards the peaceful settlement of this crisis.\r\nWe are pleased that the Quartet has recently\r\nconvened in New York to review the road map. We\r\nlook forward to their strong leadership in assisting to\r\nresolve this long outstanding issue. Fighting and\r\nviolence will not resolve the conflict. We join the\r\ninternational community’s call for both the Israeli and\r\nPalestinian leadership to make renewed efforts at the\r\nnegotiating table, to cease all hostilities by both sides\r\nand to find a permanent solution to the problem.\r\nOur belief is that diplomacy is the only means by\r\nwhich States may join as partners and co-operate in\r\nbringing about changes which promote peace,\r\neconomic and social progress for all people, both in\r\nprinciple and, more importantly, in practice.\r\nWe believe that this too should apply to the\r\nsituation in Iraq. We support the work being done in\r\nthe Security Council to adopt a new resolution on a\r\nrole of the United Nations that would provide a\r\nframework for the widest possible participation of\r\nUnited Nations Member States in the reconstruction of\r\nIraq.\r\nRegarding United Nations reforms, Papua New\r\nGuinea commends the leadership demonstrated by the\r\nSecretary-General in the current work being done to\r\nreform the main organs of the United Nations, the\r\nGeneral Assembly and its subsidiary bodies and the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe support the expansion of the Security Council\r\nin both permanent and non-permanent membership\r\ncategories. Reforms should take into account the\r\ninterests of both developed and developing countries.\r\nAll permanent members in an expanded Council\r\nshould have similar rights and privileges. However, the\r\nuse of the veto power should be curtailed and applied\r\nonly to Chapter VII issues. In doing so, we must move\r\nswiftly to complete the reforms of the United Nations\r\nsystem — including the Security Council — so we can\r\nrestore the capacity of the multilateral system to better\r\nserve us all.\r\nPapua New Guinea fully endorses the recent\r\nDeclarations and Plans of Action of the Doha,\r\nMonterrey and Johannesburg Conferences. We are\r\nresolved to meet the challenges of poverty eradication;\r\nhunger; illiteracy; environmental degradation; climate\r\nchange; and HIV/AIDS, malaria and other preventable\r\ndiseases. We are also committed to addressing issues of\r\ngood governance. It is the desire of the Government of\r\nPapua New Guinea to incorporate the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals into our national development\r\npriorities. We are in the process of adopting the\r\nmedium-term development strategy, which is aimed at\r\nredirecting development to the rural areas where the\r\nmajority of our people live. We encourage the\r\ninternational community — including all stakeholders\r\nin developed and developing countries — to continue\r\nto make resources available to fully implement those\r\nDeclarations and Plans of Action.\r\nLike other developing member States of the\r\nPacific Islands Forum, Papua New Guinea is firmly\r\ncommitted to the Barbados Programme of Action for\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States. We fully support its 10-year review\r\nprocess, which will take place at the international\r\nmeeting to be held in Mauritius in August 2004. We\r\ncall upon our regional and international development\r\npartners to support the review process, as was the case\r\nwith the recent conferences of the least developed and\r\nlandlocked developing countries.\r\nThe recent breakdown in the World Trade\r\nOrganization negotiations in Cancún is of great\r\nconcern to us all. However, that should not be a barrier\r\nto further negotiations to arrive at a fair and equitable\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\narrangement that provides for the interests of all\r\nnations.\r\nOn a more targeted front, the African, Caribbean\r\nand Pacific (ACP) group of countries — of which\r\nPapua New Guinea is a member — are now negotiating\r\nwith the European Union for a possible economic\r\npartnership agreement. It is important that the main\r\nobjective be the eradication of poverty, and therefore\r\nthat trade preferences enjoyed by ACP countries under\r\nsuccessive Lomé Conventions and under the current\r\nCotonou Agreements not be eroded.\r\nThe small island developing States of the Pacific\r\nregion are among the custodians of the largest ocean\r\nspace. The Pacific Ocean is rich in natural marine\r\nresources. The recent Pacific Islands Forum Leaders\r\nMeeting in Auckland, New Zealand, again reaffirmed\r\nthe Pacific Islands Regional Oceans Policy, which aims\r\nto ensure the future sustainable use of our oceans and\r\ntheir resources by our island communities, in close\r\ncooperation with our development partners.\r\nThe countries of the region, however, have\r\nlimited human, financial and technological capacities\r\nto control, manage and secure those resources for the\r\nbenefit of our current and future generations. In\r\nprotecting our vast marine resources, the Pacific\r\nIslands Forum leaders reiterate their serious concerns\r\nabout the shipment of radioactive materials through the\r\nregion. They also call upon States engaged in those\r\nactivities to accept full responsibility and liability for\r\ncompensation for any damage that may result, directly\r\nor indirectly, from the transportation of radioactive\r\nmaterial through the region. The two accidents that\r\nhappened in the Atlantic Ocean last year underline the\r\nreality of our concerns.\r\nPapua New Guinea, together with other small\r\nisland developing States, continues to express deep\r\nconcerns about the adverse impact of climate change,\r\nclimate variability and sea-level rise, particularly on\r\nthe small, low-lying islands that are already\r\nexperiencing extreme hardships. We will continue to\r\nstress the urgent need for developed countries to exert\r\nstrong leadership in the reduction of greenhouse gas\r\nemissions.\r\nPapua New Guinea has signed and ratified both\r\nthe United Nations Climate Change Convention and the\r\nKyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol paves the way\r\nforward for developed countries to fulfil their\r\nobligations under the Climate Change Convention. We\r\nbelieve that the larger developing countries also have\r\nan obligation to take concrete actions in reducing their\r\ngas emissions. We welcome the support of Japan, the\r\nEuropean Community and China for the Kyoto\r\nProtocol. We urge the United States, the Russian\r\nFederation and Australia to join the global efforts\r\naimed at addressing that issue, including ratification of\r\nthe Kyoto Protocol.\r\nPapua New Guinea is also not immune to the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic. Tuberculosis and malaria are\r\nagain on the rise, so there is an urgent need to find\r\npreventive measures for those diseases. I am, however,\r\npleased to report that the Papua New Guinea\r\nParliament this year enacted legislation aimed at\r\ndealing with the scourge by assisting with prevention\r\nand awareness programmes to reduce and limit the\r\nspread of HIV/AIDS, which threatens the lives of our\r\npeople, particularly mothers and children. In that\r\nregard, we thank Australia for its substantial assistance.\r\nWe also acknowledge continuing support from other\r\ndevelopment partners, including the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF), the Joint United Nations\r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS and the World Health\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe also support the work of the United Nations\r\nin relation to the protection and advancement of the\r\nrights of women and children. While we have ratified\r\nthe appropriate conventions, we realize that we must do\r\nmore. We acknowledge the support being provided by\r\nour development partners, including United Nations\r\nagencies such as the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme and UNICEF.\r\nPapua New Guinea fully concurs with the calls by\r\nthe international community to reform and restructure\r\nthe charters and mandates of the two Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions. Their lending policies should be made\r\nmore lenient and flexible with regard to assisting\r\ndeveloping countries in their developmental efforts.\r\nAmong the greatest achievements of the United\r\nNations is the process of decolonization. But that\r\nprocess will not be completed — as it must be — until\r\nthe remaining 16 Non-Self-Governing Territories have\r\nexercised their inalienable right to self-determination.\r\nThe United Nations should continue to monitor\r\ndevelopments in New Caledonia, Tokelau and the other\r\n14 Non-Self-Governing Territories on the United\r\nNations decolonization list on a case-by-case basis.\r\nNeither size, remoteness nor population density should\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nbe allowed to limit the exercise of this inalienable\r\nright. The Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting held\r\nin Auckland last month once again reaffirmed its\r\nsupport for that principle.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to reaffirm Papua New\r\nGuinea’s firm commitment to the timeless principles\r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. We also\r\nstrongly advocate that it is Papua New Guinea’s\r\nposition that diplomacy, through positive dialogue, is\r\nthe key to addressing these challenges.\r\nFinally, Papua New Guinea believes that a greater\r\nchallenge for all United Nations Member States is to\r\nwork together as genuine partners. That will serve as\r\nan effective tool for implementing our collective goal:\r\nto create a better and more secure world, both today\r\nand for future generations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on Her Excellency Ms. Marjatta Rasi, chairperson\r\nof the delegation of the Republic of Finland.\r\nMs. Rasi (Finland): I have the honour to make\r\nthe following statement on behalf of His Excellency\r\nMr. Erkki Tuomioja, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nFinland.\r\nMultilateralism and the United Nations have gone\r\nthrough a trying time since the last session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly began. At the same time that\r\nmultilateralism has been challenged by unilateral\r\nactions, it has been proved that multilateralism and\r\nmultilateral cooperation — as well as the United\r\nNations — are needed, perhaps more than ever before.\r\nThe discussions at the World Trade Organization\r\nMinisterial Meeting in Cancún also point to the need\r\nfor open and broad discussions on preserving a\r\nmultilateral trading system based on mutually agreed\r\nrules.\r\nInternational cooperation is needed in crisis\r\nmanagement and prevention, in disarmament and arms\r\ncontrol, in promoting human rights and international\r\nlaw in general, in enhancing sustainable development,\r\nin strengthening global governance with regard to\r\nenvironmental issues and in creating coherence and\r\ncooperation on economic and social issues, among\r\nother things. In order to do this, a more efficient and\r\neffective United Nations is needed. The United Nations\r\nsystem must deliver solutions to increasingly\r\ncomplicated challenges, be it Iraq, the Middle East,\r\ncoherence between trade and development, or financing\r\nfor development. Through their political will, Member\r\nStates should give the United Nations the support it\r\nrequires in order for it to be a true actor in world\r\naffairs. We need to be more efficient and more result-\r\noriented.\r\nThe development and strengthening of the United\r\nNations pose a major challenge at this particular\r\njuncture. United Nations structures — the Security\r\nCouncil included — require reform, and the whole\r\nOrganization requires better resources. This is a\r\nprerequisite also for a comprehensive implementation\r\nof the Millennium Declaration, which forms a\r\ndemanding agenda for the United Nations for years to\r\ncome.\r\nDespite different emphases and definitions given\r\nto freedom of action or joint actions, all the\r\nprerequisites exist for strengthening multilateral\r\ncooperation. As a member of the European Union,\r\nFinland is involved in the discussion on the\r\nsignificance of multilateralism and on the terms for\r\npromoting global security. This, too, should be one of\r\nthe main topics in this session of the Assembly.\r\nIn addition to what was said in the Italy’s\r\nstatement on behalf of the European Union, I should\r\nlike to focus on two issues that require multilateral\r\ncooperation in particular: the issue of harnessing\r\nglobalization and that of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe biggest challenges in the future will be those\r\nto international peace and security, which become\r\nbroader and broader in their scope, and the\r\nglobalization process, as well as managing these two\r\ntogether through multilateral cooperation.\r\nGlobalization affects everyone. Some can benefit\r\nfrom it. Some become more marginalized by it.\r\nGlobalization stems from a countless number of\r\ndecisions made in the private sector and beneath or\r\noutside public institutions. But we must be able to\r\ninfluence, through the United Nations and other\r\ninternational organizations, corporate and public sector\r\ndecisions that direct globalization. There are many\r\nongoing processes that try to make globalization more\r\ninclusive and allow everybody to share its benefits.\r\nThe Finnish Government, together with the\r\nTanzanian Government, is launching the Helsinki\r\nProcess on globalization and democracy. Ultimately,\r\nthe global governance pursued by the Helsinki Process\r\nis characterized by the democratization of international\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nrelations, by the way that globalization and its by-\r\nproducts can be managed through more equal\r\nparticipation in deciding on international rules and\r\nnorms. One of the key tasks of the process will be to\r\ndevise and develop new solutions for global problems.\r\nWe will also focus on the global economic agenda and\r\non human security.\r\nThe international players in globalization include,\r\nin addition to States and multinational companies, the\r\ncontinually growing network of non-governmental\r\norganizations. Many of those organizations take a\r\ncritical or negative stand on globalization, but do not\r\nhesitate to adopt procedures that are characteristic of\r\nglobalization or to build networks across national\r\nborders. Out of a vast array of organizations, I could\r\nname two that are perceived as opposite: the World\r\nEconomic Forum and the World Social Forum. Both,\r\nhowever, are concerned with the same challenges in the\r\nsame world. One of the aims of the Helsinki Process is\r\nto bring these two processes closer to each other.\r\nA global approach to international peace and\r\nsecurity and a multilateral security system based on\r\ncooperation are largely axiomatic principles for\r\nFinland and for our partners in the European Union.\r\nBut security problems linked to globalization, and\r\nsolutions to them, threaten to divide the international\r\ncommunity. Peace is much more than the absence of\r\nwar nowadays. Development and peace are inseparably\r\nintertwined, and both of them are being affected by\r\nglobalization.\r\nAnother major issue that requires multilateral\r\ncooperation is weapons of mass destruction and\r\nprevention of their proliferation.\r\nEffective global governance requires universally\r\nagreed norms and rules setting standards for behaviour\r\nto be followed by all States as well as by non-State\r\nactors. Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\r\nand their means of delivery is clearly an issue that\r\naffects the international community as a whole. No\r\nState can ignore these dangers. Today more than ever,\r\nwe need to step up our collective efforts to halt the\r\nproliferation worldwide. The most effective way to\r\naddress global security threats is the multilateral\r\nsystem of binding international agreements. The\r\nexisting system of treaties, built over the decades,\r\nneeds to be strengthened, not weakened. We need to\r\nreinforce our commitment to the prohibition of\r\nchemical and biological weapons and to the prevention\r\nof the spread of nuclear weapons, with the objective of\r\ntheir total elimination.\r\nPromoting adherence to multilateral treaties and\r\nobligations is not enough. It is equally important to\r\nensure that commitments are fully implemented. The\r\ninternational community cannot tolerate precedents of\r\nnon-compliance with the legal undertakings, which\r\nwould put at stake the whole non-proliferation regime.\r\nIn cases where States have difficulties in\r\nimplementing treaty obligations due to lack of legal or\r\ntechnical verification expertise, appropriate support\r\nand assistance should be offered by the relevant\r\norganizations and participating States.\r\nThe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty remains the\r\ncornerstone of our efforts to curb the spread of nuclear\r\nweapons. In our view, the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty constitutes an essential and\r\nirreplaceable building block for containing the\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons, thus contributing to\r\nnuclear disarmament. Finland attaches great\r\nimportance to its entry into force. We urge all States\r\nthat have not yet done so to sign and ratify it as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nIn combating the spread of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, new initiatives and new approaches are\r\ncalled for. In order to complement international\r\ninstruments, we need fresh perspectives on how to\r\nconfront the problem of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nFinland welcomes new efforts, open to all, such as the\r\nG-8 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons\r\nand Materials of Mass Destruction.\r\nThe United Nations and in particular the Security\r\nCouncil have the primary responsibility for\r\nmaintaining international peace and security. Finland is\r\nin favour of enhancing the role of the United Nations in\r\nissues related to the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. We agree with the Secretary-General that\r\nthe United Nations and the Security Council should\r\nlook at the enforcement of regimes against weapons of\r\nmass destruction. The United Nations has valuable\r\nexpertise and experience in verification. Finland\r\nbelieves that this verification and inspection\r\ncompetence should be maintained.\r\nBy focusing on weapons of mass destruction, I do\r\nnot want to suggest that small arms are any less\r\ndangerous. They need due and growing attention by the\r\ninternational community. In some countries and in\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nsome crises small arms are a means of massive\r\ndestruction and a major cause of loss of life, mostly of\r\ncivilians.\r\nThe multilateral institutions should respond to\r\nnew challenges. Being multilateral is not sufficient in\r\nitself. In the work of the General Assembly Finland\r\nunderlines the importance of setting clear priorities,\r\ntackling the issues that are most relevant in today’s\r\nsecurity environment. People throughout the world\r\nmight find it difficult to understand the Organization’s\r\ntrying to resolve the problems of yesterday’s world.\r\nBefore concluding, let me express my\r\nGovernment’s deep satisfaction with the fact that the\r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) has become a\r\nreality and is operational. The ICC is the cornerstone of\r\nefforts to enhance respect for international\r\nhumanitarian law and human rights. We remain\r\ncommitted to ensuring the Court’s success and appeal\r\nto States which have not yet ratified the Rome Statute\r\nto become parties to it.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Vinci Niel\r\nClodumar, chairman of the delegation of the Republic\r\nof Nauru.\r\nMr. Clodumar (Nauru): It gives me great\r\npleasure to deliver this statement on behalf of His\r\nExcellency Rene Harris, President and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Nauru, who had to\r\ncancel his trip to New York at the last minute due to\r\npressing matters at home. President Harris has asked\r\nme to convey to Mr. Julian Hunte warmest\r\ncongratulations on his assumption of the stewardship of\r\nthe Assembly. As a small island developing State,\r\nNauru is extremely proud to be associated with the\r\nCaribbean Community on Mr. Hunte’s marvellous\r\nachievement, which gives us hope that we in the\r\nPacific will also have the opportunity to preside over\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMy delegation would like, through him, to\r\ncommend His Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan, President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session, for\r\nhis excellent leadership and the great efforts that he\r\nmade, particularly in tackling the difficult issues that\r\nhave plagued the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly as the premier organ of the United Nations.\r\nThe President has pledged to continue the good work\r\nthat has been done in these areas, and he can count on\r\nNauru’s full cooperation.\r\nPeace and security — or, more correctly, the lack\r\nof it — is still the main focus of the United Nations 58\r\nyears after its inception. In the past 24 months, we have\r\nseen the internationalization of terrorism manifest itself\r\nout of a cocktail of hatred, desperation and fanaticism\r\nthat has spread its tentacles from the Middle East into\r\nthe international arena. It is unconventional,\r\nclandestine, and indiscriminate with respect to its\r\nvictims. We are also seeing an increase in the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction after a\r\nperiod of relative calm, and this is further exacerbating\r\nthe situation.\r\nThe sum of these two nightmarish threats is a\r\ncause for concern, and States that feel uniquely\r\nvulnerable to terrorist acts are considering the real\r\npossibility of terrorists gaining access to weapons of\r\nmass destruction. That scenario has forced such States\r\nto develop the antidote of unilateral action primed with\r\na pre-emptive strike policy.\r\nWe saw it in action in Afghanistan and, six\r\nmonths ago in Iraq, just as President Bush said we\r\nwould if the Security Council failed to walk the talk of\r\nresolution 1441 (2002), which called for the\r\ndisarmament by Iraq of its weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Nauru is disappointed that President Bush\r\ndid not refer in his statement last week to the status of\r\nthe coalition’s search for stockpiles of these weapons,\r\nand we are puzzled as to why it is hard to find them\r\nwhen intelligence indicated that the Iraqis could arm\r\nand unleash them so as to hit the United Kingdom\r\nwithin 45 minutes.\r\nMy delegation considers the antidote to which I\r\nreferred to be the catalyst in the new wave of nuclear\r\nweapons proliferation, and it is not a coincidence that\r\nthe countries singled out as part of the “axis of evil”\r\nare being accused of developing nuclear weapons.\r\nNauru joins the appeal to the countries concerned to\r\nobserve their obligations under the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to allow the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency to carry out\r\ninspections and verify that nuclear weapons are not\r\nbeing developed.\r\nIn all of this, we are certain of one thing: that the\r\nmajor casualty of the current state of affairs is the\r\ninnocence of the United Nations, which was mortally\r\nwounded in Baghdad when the lives of 22 dedicated\r\nUnited Nations servants were lost, including that of the\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nrevered Sergio Vieira de Mello, and more than 100\r\nwere injured.\r\nThe people of Nauru join the United Nations\r\nfamily in mourning the victims of that tragedy, and our\r\nheartfelt condolences go to the bereaved families. That\r\ndespicable act of terror has cast a shadow over the\r\nsafety and security of United Nations personnel\r\neverywhere. The clarity of its emblem, which stood for\r\ntolerance, hope and impartiality and which had acted as\r\na shield against attack, may have been blurred by its\r\nsubservient role to the administering force in Iraq.\r\nIn the light of the facts before us, Nauru fully\r\nagrees with the assessment made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, in his bold and gutsy\r\nstatement that the Organization has “come to a fork in\r\nthe road” and that we are in a moment of time that is\r\n“no less decisive than 1945 itself, when the United\r\nNations was founded.” (A/58/PV.7, p. 3)\r\nNauru fully supports the proposal to establish a\r\nhigh-level panel of eminent personalities to review\r\nthreats to peace and security and other global\r\nchallenges insofar as these may influence or be\r\nconnected with such threats. Nauru strongly believes in\r\nmultilateralism as a key tool in resolving contemporary\r\nproblems in all of their complexity.\r\nThe Security Council should be at the centre of\r\nour collective efforts in maintaining peace and\r\nresolving conflict. At the same time, the Council must\r\nhave at its disposal the means of making evaluations\r\nand taking collective action. Most importantly, it must\r\nhave the will to act quickly and decisively, not only to\r\nthreats to peace and security, but to genocide and other\r\nmassive violations of human rights.\r\nNauru is pleased to see the rapid progression\r\ntowards making the International Criminal Court\r\noperational since its Statute came into force in July\r\n2001. We believe that the objectives of the Court make\r\nit a useful addition to the international tool kit for the\r\npreservation of peace, as perpetrators of atrocious acts\r\nin armed conflict have been put on notice that they will\r\nbe held accountable for their acts or omissions.\r\nMr. Alexandre (Haiti), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nAs a small island developing State in the Pacific\r\nOcean, Nauru aligns itself with the statements of the\r\nleaders of the Pacific nations who have spoken before\r\nme on the concerns and challenges that we, the small-\r\nisland-big-ocean developing States are facing, now and\r\nin the future. Nauru bears all the unique characteristics\r\nof a small island State, given our small size, in terms of\r\nboth land area and population, our remoteness and our\r\nvulnerability to exogenous forces, be they man-made or\r\nnatural.\r\nIn 1994, the world community agreed that small\r\nisland developing States warranted special\r\nconsideration with regard to their economic and social\r\ndevelopment because of the unique set of\r\ncharacteristics that are inherent in each island country,\r\nand it was to address those unique problems that the\r\nBarbados Plan of Action was created.\r\nAs His Royal Highness the Prime Minister of\r\nTonga stated in his intervention, the road to sustainable\r\ndevelopment for small island developing States is\r\nposted with signs of undertakings, as we marched from\r\nBarbados in 1994 to New York in 1999 for the five-\r\nyear review, then on to Monterrey in 2002 for the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, where more signs were posted saying\r\nthat internal self-help, good governance and trade were\r\nthe key to poverty alleviation, and that subscription to\r\nthose cures would provide the way for developed\r\ncountries to come in and help. Most, if not all, of the\r\nsmall island developing States have been taking this\r\nmedicine for a long time, and we have yet to see the\r\ndoctor. In Johannesburg, a whole chapter was devoted\r\nto the cause of the small island developing States. In\r\nApril of this year, the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment paved the way for an international\r\nmeeting to be held in Mauritius in 2004.\r\nYet despite all these signs of good intentions, the\r\nreality is that, when small island developing States try\r\nto see that these decisions or undertakings are reflected\r\nin other international forums, our proposals in most\r\ncases are either rejected or rendered impotent after\r\nintense and difficult negotiations. The Cancún meeting\r\nis a good example, as is the recent meeting of\r\nConvention bodies such as the Eighth Conference of\r\nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change in New Delhi in 2002,\r\nand the Sixth Conference of the Parties to the United\r\nNations Convention to Combat Desertification, held in\r\nHavana recently. This undesirable situation needs to be\r\naddressed if small island developing States are to\r\nbenefit from the positive outcomes of international\r\nmeetings or review conferences.\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nAs we march towards Mauritius, small island\r\ndeveloping States will have to endure due process in\r\nthe Second Committee and at the twelfth session of the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development in order to\r\nestablish administrative and financial norms for the\r\ninternational meeting. My delegation suspects that\r\nthere will be many bumps and detours on the way, but\r\nour hope is that, at the end of the road, the outcome\r\nwill focus on what needs to be done — when and by\r\nwhom — to overcome impediments in the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action.\r\nIt is not sufficient to rely solely on the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action to address all the development\r\nproblems of small island developing States. To that\r\nend, Nauru sees the Millennium Development Goals as\r\nsupplementing the Programme of Action by adding the\r\nhuman development dimension to the scope of issues\r\nthat should be addressed and by offering partnership to\r\ndrive the process.\r\nHowever, for small island States like Nauru, the\r\ncomplex reporting requirement of the Goals is adding\r\nto the burden of reports that we are required to prepare,\r\nand therefore it is the considered view of my\r\ndelegation that the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme should tailor the questionnaire to suit a\r\ngroup of clients rather than use a one-size-fits-all\r\napproach. Assistance also should be provided to\r\ncountries such as Nauru to collect and process the raw\r\ndata required for the report.\r\nNauru, like other low-lying small island States,\r\nsees the Kyoto Protocol as its salvation from sea-level\r\nrise and climate change, which would devastate our\r\nalready fragile ecological system, which is essential to\r\nour livelihood and culture. My delegation understands\r\nthat the Russian Federation now stands between the\r\nKyoto Protocol’s coming into force and its continuing\r\nto languish. If that is the case, then Nauru calls on the\r\nRussian Federation to do what is universally right and\r\njust by ratifying the protocol before the meeting of the\r\nNinth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held\r\nin Italy in December this year.\r\nA healthy Pacific Ocean and the sustainable use\r\nof its natural resources, including highly migratory fish\r\nstocks, are also critical to our livelihood. We in the\r\nPacific have walked the talk on these issues through\r\nthe development of an ocean policy to guide us in the\r\nmanagement of our part of the Pacific Ocean and to\r\nform the framework for future regional ocean-related\r\ninitiatives.\r\nSecondly, we have adopted a Convention on the\r\nConservation and Management of Highly Migratory\r\nFish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean,\r\nwhich provides a comprehensive regime for the\r\nmanagement of the region’s highly migratory fish\r\nstocks, both in our exclusive economic zone and in the\r\nhigh seas.\r\nThe trans-shipment of nuclear waste through our\r\nwaters is of great concern to many island countries\r\nbecause of the damage it could cause.\r\nMy delegation has stated during previous debates\r\nthat it agrees fully with the proposal to reform the\r\nSecurity Council to bring it into tune with the realities\r\nof today’s world order. We are disappointed that, after\r\n10 years of debate, there is still no convergence of\r\nviews between the two camps on how to move forward.\r\nTo try to address the expansion along with the\r\nquestion of the veto would be like riding a dead\r\nhorse — we would not go anywhere, which is exactly\r\nthe situation we are in.\r\nFurthermore, my delegation believes that we have\r\ndone all we can do at the representative level, and that\r\nthe only way we can make progress is to take it to a\r\nhigher level, so that our political leaders can review\r\nwhat we have done and make a decision on how to\r\nmove forward.\r\nOn the question of reforms to operational policies\r\nand administrative structures, including budgetary\r\naspects of the United Nations, my delegation fully\r\nsupports the actions taken by the Secretary-General in\r\nthis regard, but it appears that much more has to be\r\ndone. The areas of review have to be enlarged and\r\nintensified, if indeed the prediction that the regular\r\nbudget is going to exceed the $3 billion mark is\r\ncorrect.\r\nFinally, concerning reform, my delegation fully\r\nsupports the view expressed by Australia that the group\r\nsystem needs modernization. Most of the Pacific small\r\nisland countries are buried in the Asian group, which\r\nextends from the Pacific Ocean to the Suez Canal,\r\nwhile our big brothers, Australia and New Zealand, are\r\n“Others” in the Western European group. Outside the\r\nUnited Nations system, the Pacific is usually grouped\r\nwith East Asia, in both economic and geopolitical\r\nzoning. We see no reason why this cannot be the case\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nat the United Nations, considering that the divide\r\nbetween Eastern and Western Europe will become\r\nmeaningless as the two converge.\r\nNauru, because of biased and incorrect media\r\nreports over the last five years, now carries a stigma as\r\na haven for money-laundering through offshore banks\r\nregistered in Nauru. There have also been reports that\r\nour Citizen Investment Programme is aiding and\r\nabetting criminals and terrorists, allowing them free\r\nmovement by making possible the acquisition of\r\nNauruan passports.\r\nThe reluctance of foreign authorities to provide\r\nproof of allegations of criminal activities by banks\r\nregistered in Nauru prevented the Government from\r\ninitiating the mechanism provided for in our legislation\r\nto release information on offshore banks to foreign\r\nauthorities. This has put us on a collision course.\r\nNauru was not surprised when, in 2000, the\r\nFinancial Action Task Force (FATF) of the\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment (OECD) listed it along with others as a\r\nnon-cooperating country. The following year, Nauru’s\r\nstatus was further downgraded, and it was put on the\r\nlist for “countermeasures” by members of FATF, not\r\nbecause our laws were insufficient, but because the\r\ngoalposts were shifted and our failure involved a lack\r\nof capacity and capability to supervise the offshore\r\nbanks registered in Nauru.\r\nIn December 2002, the United States\r\nGovernment, in taking up FATF’s call to apply\r\ncountermeasures against Nauru, announced that Nauru\r\nwould be designated a “money-laundering” country\r\nunder the provisions of the Patriotic Act. The highest\r\nlevel of sanctions would be applied, which would\r\nprohibit all commercial and financial transactions\r\nbetween any Nauru-registered financial institution and\r\nthe United States. In May 2003 Nauru was accordingly\r\ninformed and was given 30 days to show cause as to\r\nwhy the sanction should not be applied.\r\nNauru submitted its comments, passed new laws\r\nin March of this year repealing the registration of\r\noffshore banks, and included a sunset clause\r\nterminating the licenses that would come into effect 30\r\nto 180 days — as the case may be — from 27 March\r\n2003, when the law came into force. The Government\r\nhas also suspended the Citizen Investment Programme\r\nwhile it reviews the law, in order to address the\r\nconcerns expressed by the United States Department of\r\nState.\r\nA new anti-money-laundering law was passed in\r\nMarch, and work is in progress on omnibus legislation\r\nthat would address the financing of terrorism,\r\ntransnational organized crime and money-laundering.\r\nNauru also signed an article 98 agreement with the\r\nUnited States.\r\nIn the process, Nauru has lost close to $2 million,\r\nif not more, in revenue, which is a drop in the ocean to\r\nOECD members but real money to us, considering that\r\nit is equivalent to 5 per cent of the Government’s\r\nannual budget. We are now waiting to learn our fate —\r\nawaiting the judgement of the United States and the\r\nFATF, as the two are interlinked.\r\nTo conclude, Nauru, small as it is, believes that\r\npower consists in a nation’s capacity to link its will\r\nwith the purpose of others, to lead by reason and give\r\nthe gift of cooperation.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on Mr. Patrick Albert Lewis, chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Antigua and Barbuda.\r\nMr. Lewis (Antigua and Barbuda): It gives me\r\nprofound pleasure to welcome and congratulate\r\nMr. Julian Hunte in regard to the lofty position that he\r\nnow holds. It was not long ago that he was fighting\r\nalongside the ambassadors of the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean Group. He represents the smallest country\r\nthat has ever ascended to the presidency, and, for his\r\nCaribbean colleagues, there will be additional rejoicing\r\nwhen his photograph appears on the Wall of Presidents.\r\nIt is my hope that our younger diplomats will\r\nendeavour to emulate him and continue to demonstrate\r\nthe mettle of small island developing States. But let me\r\nalso pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for\r\nthe able and skilful manner in which he conducted our\r\ndeliberations during the fifty-seventh session. The\r\nSecretary-General and his staff must also receive\r\nacclaim for their diligence and steadfast work. We\r\nmourn and grieve for the United Nations staff members\r\nkilled and wounded in Baghdad, and, indeed, for all\r\nmembers of the staff who have made the ultimate\r\nsacrifice in upholding the ideals of the United Nations.\r\nWe have often repeated statistics on human living\r\nconditions, but it seems to be just a recitation.\r\nNonetheless, in the hope that this year figures may\r\nmove those in control to make a meaningful attempt at\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nremedies, let me join the list of other colleagues who\r\nhave recalled the fact that almost half of the world’s\r\npopulation subsists on less than $2 a day, and a fifth\r\nlives on less than $1 a day. The point to be stressed is\r\nthat global inequality has increased. The digital divide\r\nis widening, the number of refugees and displaced\r\npersons has grown, and the AIDS crisis is devastating\r\nnumerous societies.\r\nWhat tends to be ignored is what developing\r\ncountries have been doing for themselves. In the\r\nCaribbean, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\r\ncountries have come to each other’s assistance in times\r\nof crisis, whether there be natural devastation by way\r\nof earthquakes, volcanic eruption, drought or floods.\r\nWe have used our military forces positively, to rescue,\r\nto stabilize and to rehabilitate, when suffering the\r\nvicissitudes of nature. Strapped as we are in regard to\r\nfinances, we have assisted one another in regard to the\r\nseverest of economic constraints. If an unbiased\r\nevaluation is made, it will be clear that average gains in\r\nhuman development in low- and middle-income\r\ncountries have been substantial and higher than gains\r\nin income. Life expectancy has increased by 59 per\r\ncent, and illiteracy has been reduced from 39 per cent\r\nin 1970 to 25 per cent at the turn of the century.\r\nNevertheless, current development trends are not\r\nsustainable and are placing extreme pressure on the\r\nenvironment and on the impoverished, who bear the\r\noverwhelming brunt of environmental degradation. Our\r\ncoastal systems are threatened, dominant countries are\r\nfishing indiscriminately within our exclusive economic\r\nzones, and our coral reefs have not only been damaged\r\nbut are disappearing. Yet aid has declined as a share of\r\ngross national product, and World Bank research\r\nindicates that, without a doubling of development\r\nassistance, the endorsed Millennium Goals are unlikely\r\nto be achieved.\r\nDevelopment experts appear to have a single\r\nfocus. We fully accept the necessity for market\r\nreforms, but they are insufficient in themselves. There\r\nis a need for broad social reforms. Equitable income\r\ndistribution and secondary school enrolment have been\r\nfound to be insensitive to growth, while air quality has\r\nbeen negatively correlated to growth. The global\r\ninstitutions continue to listen to their identified experts\r\nand to disregard local experience, whether from the\r\naged and wise or from the young and brilliant.\r\nSustained development requires a significant\r\npercentage of domestic or local ownership.\r\nOur religious literature states that continuing a\r\nlifestyle demands the depositing or planting of seeds,\r\nfrom which, in a relatively short period of time, comes\r\nnew life and the continuance of organic existence. With\r\nthat in mind, it is imperative that development\r\nstrategies clearly take into consideration those who will\r\nsucceed us, and Antigua and Barbuda, which devotes\r\nmuch attention and planning to the advancement of its\r\nyouth, is advocating continued global focus on this\r\nissue in order to ensure a more harmonious\r\ninternational atmosphere than the one in which we\r\ncarry out our activities.\r\nWith that in mind, Caribbean heads of State and\r\nGovernment have met with representatives of the\r\nWorld Bank and are jointly in the process of, first,\r\nidentifying the risk and protective factors and\r\ndeterminants of youth behaviours and development;\r\nsecondly, demonstrating that the negative behaviours of\r\nyoung people are costly not only to themselves but also\r\nto society as a whole; and, thirdly, identifying key\r\nintervention points for youth development,\r\nunderscoring identified risk and protective factors.\r\nPresently, as a result of this joint thrust, we are\r\ntargeting sexual and physical abuse, HIV/AIDS as\r\nlinked to misguided values about sexuality, the\r\nincidence of rage, youth unemployment, and social\r\nmisconceptions as to the use of alcohol and marijuana.\r\nMoving forward requires modernizing the educational\r\nsystem and maximizing the protective effect of schools,\r\nupgrading public health-care systems, making families\r\na top policy issue, and strengthening community and\r\nneighbourhood support to adolescents.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda believes that, whereas aid is\r\nsorely needed, its effectiveness will be limited unless a\r\nlevel playing field is provided in regard to trade and\r\ninvestment in developing societies. There cannot be\r\nmeaningful progress by talking about the relative\r\nsignificance and importance of free trade. We listen\r\nand see the dominant countries employ various and\r\ndiverse forms of agricultural protectionism, while\r\ntaking away from former colonies of exploitation vital\r\npreferences needed to keep their products on the\r\nmarket. Why should globalization be oppressive to the\r\npusillanimous? We have been listening to the\r\nmodifications of the philosophies of Cobden and\r\nBright, but are feeling the yoke of global practices,\r\nknowing that never in modern history has there ever\r\nbeen free trade.\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nThe fears of developing countries in regard to the\r\npractices and realities of globalization, as opposed to\r\nits often-vaunted philosophy, were manifested at\r\nCancún in September of this year. Cancún, we have\r\nbeen made to understand, means snake pit in the local\r\nMayan language, and our hope is that there will be\r\nsome meaningful effort to overcome the drawbacks.\r\nDeveloping countries will be hindered from developing\r\nthemselves if lip service alone continues to be paid to\r\npoverty. The first step in the elimination of poverty is\r\nto adequately recognize the multifunctional role of\r\nagriculture. This multifunctional role incorporates food\r\nsafety, animal welfare and the preservation of land.\r\nUnfortunately, Cancún proved once again that the\r\ndominant countries would continue to exempt\r\nthemselves from the rules governing free trade and to\r\ndomestically provide substantive subsidies to their\r\nfarmers, while denying the former colonies of\r\nexploitation the right to preferences.\r\nThe year 2004 will mark the tenth anniversary of\r\nthe first United Nations Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, which was held in Barbados in 1994. In looking\r\nback at the almost 10 years since that Conference, we\r\nhold these following truths to be self evident: In the\r\nBarbados Programme’s attention on the unique\r\ncircumstances of small island developing States, the\r\ncorresponding actions to address these circumstances\r\nby the international community, has been lacking. This\r\nis the opportunity presented by the international\r\nmeeting, to review the implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action that will be held in Mauritius in\r\nAugust 2004. It presents us with a second chance to\r\nidentify a set of concrete actions which will be needed\r\nto further the implementation of the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action and thereby regain the\r\nmomentum lost by small island developing States in\r\ntheir quest for sustainable development. So far we have\r\nnot been satisfied that problems relating to the trans-\r\nshipment of nuclear waste through our waters, bilging\r\nand fishing indiscriminately in our Exclusive Economic\r\nZones have been given any meaningful consideration.\r\nMy Government welcomes the entry into force of\r\nthe Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention\r\non Biological Diversity, having recently deposited our\r\ninstruments of ratification for both the Protocol and the\r\nStockholm Convention on Persistent Organic\r\nPollutants. As a Party to the Kyoto Protocol to the\r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate\r\nChange, we wish to lend our support to the call made\r\nby the Foreign Minister of Japan for parties to the\r\nClimate Change Convention to maintain the\r\ninternational momentum for climate change\r\nnegotiations, for the early entry into force of the Kyoto\r\nProtocol and for the formulation of common rules that\r\nwill facilitate participation by all countries.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals constitute an\r\nambitious agenda for reducing poverty and improving\r\nlives. The challenge to implement them is enormous. A\r\ncase in point is the target of halving by 2015 the\r\nproportion of people without access to safe drinking\r\nwater and proper sanitation. To meet this target, the\r\nworld will need to connect approximately 200,000\r\npeople to clean water and 400,000 people to improved\r\nsanitation each day.\r\nThat will require three things: first, innovative\r\nfinancing mechanisms to assure the necessary doubling\r\nin financial flows to developing countries for water and\r\nsanitation, from current spending of $10 billion each\r\nyear, to about $20 billion a year; secondly, greatly\r\nimproved governance of scarce water resources, built\r\naround holistic, integrated water resources management\r\nstrategies that encompass priorities from drinking to\r\nagriculture and industrial development; and thirdly, a\r\nclear focus on building capacity where it is needed\r\nmost: working directly with local communities,\r\nespecially women, to help craft and implement their\r\nown solutions. And this is just for water.\r\nWe see, as the dominant Powers repeat their call\r\nfor universal democracy, that the former colonies of\r\nexploitation must remind them that democracy is most\r\ndifficult to achieve among those witnessing the tears\r\nand the conditions of hungry children. Democracy\r\nstruggles to maintain itself among those who are\r\nracked with illnesses and weak from the lack of\r\nadequate nutrition. Democracy is practically a utopian\r\nideal, in which there are defined class divisions and\r\ninsurmountable social barriers. For democracy to thrive\r\nand prosper, all sectors of the society have to\r\nparticipate fully with regard to economic growth and\r\nan adequate distribution of income. It is, therefore,\r\nincumbent that society work toward integral, equitable\r\nand sustainable social and economic development. In\r\nAntigua and Barbuda, in the midst of our trials and\r\ntribulations, we have maintained democracy, and it is a\r\nhallmark of our existence.\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nThe products of science, technology and\r\ninnovation have to be harnessed and designed to add\r\nvalue to the real components of development. Wealth\r\nmust be generated in order to raise the dignity and the\r\nesteem of mankind, and to garner respect for the\r\ninternationally recognized fundamental rights and\r\nprinciples of labour. Without such, socio-economic\r\ndevelopment and, consequently, the full enjoyment of\r\ndemocracy will be held in abeyance.\r\nMy country is at a loss to fully comprehend why\r\nsome of the major countries of this world oppose the\r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). It is vital to our\r\nsecurity and development. The Court represents a\r\nrevolution in legal and moral attitudes toward some of\r\nthe worst crimes on Earth. Whereas many developing\r\nStates have suffered under the yoke of globalization,\r\nthe ICC represents a plus for the globalization process,\r\nits principles of justice and the rule of law in\r\ninternational affairs. The Rome Statute has sufficient\r\nchecks and balances to allay all fears, and we remain\r\nconvinced that the ICC will be a legitimate judicial\r\ninstitution to adequately judge individuals for war\r\ncrimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. We\r\nreiterate that this can be done while guaranteeing States\r\ntheir rights, as they are protected from any interference\r\nby the Court if they pursue the given crimes at the\r\nnational level, and that the prosecutor’s autonomous\r\npower is accompanied by guarantees against using the\r\nCourt for specious or politically motivated endeavours.\r\nThe Non-Self-Governing Territories of the\r\nCaribbean look to Caribbean members of the Special\r\nCommittee on Decolonization, more commonly known\r\nas the Special Committee of 24, to give guidance in\r\nregard to their constitutional evolution. This year there\r\nwas a breakthrough in Anguilla, as the United\r\nKingdom agreed to have the regional seminar held in\r\none of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, and for the\r\nfirst time the United Nations Secretariat agreed to write\r\ndirectly to the local representatives, rather than through\r\nthe representatives of the administering Powers. But\r\nmore importantly, the United Kingdom sent a senior\r\nofficial from the Commonwealth and Overseas Office,\r\nwho was to gain the respect of the seminar participants.\r\nThe Non-Self-Governing Territories greeted this\r\ndevelopment, and all sent delegations that were vocal\r\nand explained that their options had never been\r\nexplained to them. They were eager to remain in touch\r\nwith the United Nations Secretariat, and sought to take\r\nadvantage of whatever experiences, educational and\r\notherwise, the United Nations could provide. In an\r\natmosphere of cordiality, the administrating Power and\r\nthe non-self-governing territories expressed ways and\r\nmeans of promoting development and advancement for\r\nthe territories. Quite significantly the non-self-\r\ngoverning territories hailed the new policy of the\r\nUnited Kingdom for consultation with the elected\r\nofficials of its territories on the appointment of\r\ngovernors.\r\nMy country would not like to give the impression\r\nthat we are only concerned with development, as this\r\nwould be far from the truth. We are cognizant of other\r\nglobal issues, particularly with reference to peace and\r\nsecurity. The images that are constantly before us with\r\nreference to Iraq and the Middle East leave us\r\nquestioning the brotherhood of mankind. The United\r\nNations has to be unified with reference to the\r\nrehabilitation of Iraq, and the transition of its\r\nadministrative structures into the hands of its nationals.\r\nWe subsequently give our support for the peace\r\nprocess in the Middle East, based on the respective\r\nresolutions of both the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council. Likewise, we give wholehearted\r\nsupport to the preservation of the role of the United\r\nNations and other organizations in working toward the\r\nstabilization and security of Afghanistan.\r\nIn the same vein, we support and encourage the\r\nefforts made to resolve the conflicts in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, and the stabilization of peace in\r\nparts of West Africa and the Balkans.\r\nWe continue to press for the revitalization of the\r\ndisarmament process, non-proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons and general arms control.\r\nThese are indeed perilous times, and, when an\r\nevent occurs in a distant part of the globe that can\r\ndrastically affect us domestically, total disregard of the\r\nneed for tolerance will not only produce resentment but\r\nalso the dangerous practice of intolerance. For such\r\ntimes it is far better to remember the words of Thomas\r\nPaine, who stated that “The world is my country, all\r\nmankind are my brethren, and to do good is my\r\nreligion.”\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ngive the floor to Mr. Clifford Mamba, chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Swaziland.\r\nMr. Mamba (Swaziland): It is an honour and\r\nprivilege for me to present my country’s statement as\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\ncommanded by His Majesty King Mswati III and on his\r\nbehalf. Allow me to convey the greetings and best\r\nwishes of His Majesty King Mswati III and Her\r\nMajesty the Indlovukazi and indeed the entire Swazi\r\nnation.\r\nWe are gathered here to chart the way forward\r\ntowards the creation of a world fit for all of us by the\r\nturn of the century and beyond. Over the past year, we\r\nwitnessed dramatic events that brought old and new\r\nissues to the forefront. The international situation has\r\nrelapsed into the old state of uncertainty. International\r\nleadership, be it on the part of the major Powers or the\r\nUnited Nations, has become vague, as confrontations at\r\nthe interstate and intra-state levels have increased. Our\r\ninability to stand collectively against many issues that\r\nafflict each individual country differently has been\r\ncited by our detractors as marking the beginning of the\r\nend of the Organization and multilateralism.\r\nThe United Nations needs to send a clear message\r\nto its detractors that it is alive and well, and that it will\r\nindeed play a major role in the post-cold war era. All\r\nmust know that the United Nations is a major forum for\r\nconsultation, coordination and collective decisions on\r\ncrucial socio-political issues among its Members and\r\nthat its strength and relevance has never come from\r\naffirming the designs of a few selected Member\r\nnations, but instead rests on the collective will of the\r\ninternational community that emerges from a\r\nmultilateral process.\r\nIn our interdependent world, the need to\r\nstrengthen the multilateral process is now more urgent\r\nthan ever before, if we are to achieve our common goal\r\nof a just and humane international order based on\r\ninternational cooperation and solidarity. This is a\r\nchallenge that must be squarely and urgently addressed,\r\nand remedial action must be taken here at the United\r\nNations. We can stand tall and proud, knowing that two\r\nyears ago, the response by the United Nations to a new\r\nand unprecedented level of terrorism was immediate,\r\nunited and effective. That response was a model for\r\ninternational unity of purpose and multilateral action; it\r\nwas a lesson that should not be forgotten as the\r\nOrganization tackles other problems confronting\r\nhumanity.\r\nAt this point, allow me to pay tribute to\r\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special Representative of\r\nthe Secretary-General, and to the other United Nations\r\nstaff and support staff who lost their lives in the\r\nterrible tragedy in Baghdad a few weeks ago. Once\r\nmore, terrorism has shown its ugly face — indeed its\r\nonly face — and how important it is to support the\r\nUnited Nations efforts to deal with it.\r\nDespite the best intentions and efforts of regional\r\norganizations and the United Nations, a scourge of a\r\ndifferent nature continues to threaten many parts of the\r\nworld. I refer here to the threat of internal and inter-\r\nState conflicts around the world. Events in some parts\r\nof the world continue to be of grave concern to us all.\r\nPeople and countries continue to expend valuable\r\nenergy and resources in fighting each other. The\r\ninternational community has a responsibility, not only\r\nto design appropriate strategies for a measured and\r\nearly response, but also to find ways and means of\r\naddressing those conflicts’ root cause and managing\r\nthem to a peaceful resolution.\r\nThere are positive indications that political\r\nconflict and turmoil in Africa will be eliminated, and\r\nthere is hope for building stability and economic\r\nprogress. In the face of dwindling official development\r\nassistance and the lack of comparable resources, the\r\ncreation of the African Union and its New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) programme are\r\ncommendable initiatives to bring Africa closer to the\r\nmainstream of international development, to generate\r\nsustainable economic growth and to eradicate poverty\r\nand the spread of disease.\r\nWhat is needed now are resources and we ask that\r\nevery effort be made by our developed partners to\r\nensure that these initiatives achieve a breakthrough for\r\nAfrican development. Also, the international\r\ncommunity should concentrate its efforts toward\r\nmaking development more inclusive and must ensure\r\nthat particular groups of vulnerable countries, in\r\nparticular small developing States, are not left out of\r\nthe global economy and the development process.\r\nWith the ongoing revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly and its integrated implementation and\r\nfollow-up to the outcome of major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits, we are hopeful that the\r\naspirations of our countries for sustainable\r\ndevelopment and peace will be met.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to be a\r\nmatter of great concern. We urge both parties to renew\r\ntheir commitment to the road map for peace and to\r\nagree on a mechanism for achieving a lasting peace.\r\nWe are pleased to note that a significant level of\r\n29\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nconsensus on the main elements of a settlement has\r\nemerged. We further urge both parties to take\r\nadvantage of this and proceed towards negotiations\r\ninvolving the leadership of Palestine and Israel.\r\nIt is regrettable that the threat of a nuclear\r\nholocaust still haunts us — even to this day — owing\r\nto the inability of the international community to work\r\nout a regime for the total elimination of nuclear\r\nweapons. Under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty we have made significant gains on the\r\nissue of nuclear disarmament, but these alone cannot\r\neliminate the threat of nuclear weapons. The Kingdom\r\nof Swaziland continues to hold the view that the\r\ninternational community must effectively address this\r\nmatter in order to establish a clear timetable to which\r\nall nuclear Powers must commit.\r\nIn addition to the struggle to outlaw weapons of\r\nmass destruction, there is an urgent need to address the\r\nissue of small arms and light weapons, which have\r\ncontributed to conflict and insecurity in many of our\r\ncountries. Their easy accessibility, fuelled by illicit\r\nbrokering, is a major cause for concern. We appeal to\r\nall countries to fully implement the recommendations\r\ncontained in the Programme of Action adopted by the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small\r\nArms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, held here\r\nin New York in 2001, with a view to combating such\r\npractices.\r\nEconomic growth is essential if we are to meet\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, in particular the\r\nfirst goal of eradicating poverty. In our quest to\r\ndevelop quietly and peacefully, according to the wishes\r\nof the Swazi nation, His Majesty King Mswati III\r\nlaunched, in June this year, the country’s first draft\r\nconstitution — a document that has been hailed by\r\nmany as a good framework for shaping a new\r\nSwaziland. The Constitutional Drafting Committee has\r\ntaken the draft to the people for their input, and it is\r\nour hope that it will be finalized and adopted soon. We\r\nare grateful to our international partners for providing\r\nsupport throughout that exercise.\r\nDespite our best efforts, however, the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland is finding it difficult to achieve progress\r\nbecause of the huge obstacles that we face, the greatest\r\nof these being the threat to our future by the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic. Its devastating impact on Swaziland has\r\nbeen well documented. No development sector is\r\nimmune from the consequences of the very high and\r\nincreasing HIV infection rate among our people, given\r\nthe enormous strain that it places on our financial and\r\nhuman resources. We are grateful, however, to the\r\nGlobal Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria,\r\nand hopes are now high. Notwithstanding the inherent\r\ndelays in processing our applications to the Fund, the\r\narrival of the first disbursements from the Fund in\r\nAugust has increased hope for thousands among the\r\naffected and infected population.\r\nWe are now able to embrace the approved\r\nmedical-care strategies, including the reduction of\r\nmother-to-child transmission of the virus and the\r\nprescription of antiretroviral drugs for those who need\r\nthem. The recent high-level meeting on HIV/AIDS,\r\nwhich was held here last week, was of critical\r\nimportance to Swaziland. We are positive that the\r\nconclusions reached during that meeting will be critical\r\nin our endeavour to find solutions to this pandemic.\r\nAs part of His Majesty’s initiative to promote\r\nglobal awareness of the pandemic and to raise funds\r\nthat will help those of our countries that are suffering\r\nfrom the dreadful consequences of the disease, the\r\nmuch awaited album by international artists, entitled\r\n“Songs for Life”, was launched by His Majesty here at\r\nthe United Nations, in Washington and in Los Angeles\r\nin June this year. We look forward with great\r\nconfidence to the success of the album, whose proceeds\r\nwill go entirely to HIV/AIDS programmes.\r\nThe food security situation that continues to\r\naffect the Southern African region is closely linked to\r\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic. The Kingdom of Swaziland\r\nhas been hard hit by food shortages, largely due to the\r\nfailure of the rains, particularly in the rural areas,\r\nwhere communities are entirely dependent on farming.\r\nAs food shortages grip us tighter, we are grateful to the\r\nUnited Nations and its affiliated agencies for their\r\neffort to help us to arrest the crisis. As we approach\r\nthis farming season, it is our prayer that the situation\r\nwill improve.\r\nIt could be safely said that the twenty-first\r\ncentury has had an inauspicious start, with\r\nglobalization, terrorism, disease and weapons of mass\r\ndestruction at the forefront of our minds. This places\r\nall the more responsibility on the United Nations to\r\nharness the resources and commitment of its Members\r\nfor the benefit of humankind. In this effort, there is a\r\ncompelling need to include all the peoples of the world,\r\n30\r\nA/58/PV.19\r\nas envisaged by our founding fathers and as enshrined\r\nin the principle of universality. Acknowledging the\r\nimportance of this principle, the Kingdom of Swaziland\r\nraises the issue of the inclusion once more of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan in the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations and its associated agencies. Our\r\nprincipled position on this important issue remains\r\nunchanged.\r\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan has shown time\r\nand again its willingness to participate in efforts to\r\nbring about true global peace, development and\r\nsecurity, as well as its commitment to utilize resources\r\nfor the benefit of mankind. We therefore fail to\r\nunderstand why the people of Taiwan cannot be part of\r\nthis great family of nations.\r\nFinally, I would like to thank the President of the\r\nAssembly for giving me this opportunity to speak\r\nbefore the Assembly. The Kingdom of Swaziland\r\nreiterates its conviction that the United Nations system\r\nremains the best guarantee for international peace and\r\nsecurity. We pledge to work vigorously with the\r\nOrganization to ensure its success.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate for this\r\nmeeting.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
