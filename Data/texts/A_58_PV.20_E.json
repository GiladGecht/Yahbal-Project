Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I first call on His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Louis Straker, Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Commerce and Trade of\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines.\r\nMr. Straker (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines):\r\nThe fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly\r\naffords me the special privilege, honour and pleasure of\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the\r\noffice of President of the General Assembly. As a\r\ndistinguished son of our neighbouring island, Saint\r\nLucia, you do great honour to your country and to the\r\nwhole Caribbean Community family. I take great pride\r\nin what you, Sir, a fellow Foreign Minister and my dear\r\nfriend, have accomplished, and trust that, under your\r\nastute leadership, this fifty-eighth session will chart the\r\nright course, which will enable the Organization to\r\nfulfil the expectations of mankind for a secure,\r\npeaceful and prosperous world. Who knoweth but that\r\nby some divine order you have come to the presidency\r\nof this body at such a time as this.\r\nLet me first express, on behalf of the Government\r\nand people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\r\ndeepest sympathy to Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\nand the entire United Nations family on the loss of\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello and other United Nations\r\npersonnel in the terrorist attack in Baghdad. Those\r\ndedicated United Nations workers strived for peace and\r\njustice for the people of the world. They lived for that\r\ncause, and, tragically, they gave their lives for that\r\ncause. We share the pain of this loss and the\r\nbewilderment over it, and pay tribute to all those\r\nUnited Nations staff members who put duty before self\r\nin the service of mankind.\r\nMy Government acknowledges with appreciation\r\nthe sterling work being done in difficult conditions all\r\nover the developing world by United Nations agencies,\r\nfrom peacekeeping and the restoration of democracy to\r\ndevelopment cooperation and humanitarian aid. I also\r\nwish to single out for particular mention the United\r\nNations Development Fund for Women and the United\r\nNations Population Fund. We urge Member States to\r\ncontinue to give support and assistance to these\r\norganizations, which make such a difference,\r\nparticularly in the lives of women and children, in the\r\npoorest sectors of the world.\r\nWe have heard speaker after speaker, over the\r\ncourse of the past week, suggesting that the United\r\nNations is in crisis. Many have proposed solutions for\r\nthe rectification of this unhappy state of affairs. It is\r\nmy Government’s contention that the General\r\nAssembly needs to retake its place as the central\r\nplatform of the Organization, because it is the only\r\ntruly democratic arm of the United Nations. In this\r\nregard, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines intends to\r\nparticipate fully in the ongoing debate on reform which\r\nwill be led by you, Mr. President, and we are hopeful\r\nthat, with your able guidance, some real progress can\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nbe made in this fifty-eighth session. Of particular\r\nconcern to small missions like my own is the volume\r\nand variety of work between September and December\r\nevery year. The way the work of the General Assembly\r\nis designed makes it difficult for us to make the kind of\r\ncontribution that we would wish for the effective and\r\nefficient operation of the Organization. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral said in his report on the revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly:\r\n“The proliferation of meetings and official\r\ndocuments places excessive demands on both the\r\nSecretariat and Member States. Many smaller\r\nMember States now find it practically impossible\r\nto play a meaningful role in even the most crucial\r\nactivities of the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council”. (A/57/387,\r\npara. 23)\r\nIf the work of the General Assembly could be\r\nredesigned so as to spread the work load more evenly\r\nthroughout the calendar year, it would enable small\r\nmissions like that of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\r\nto participate fully in the work of the Organization.\r\nThe debate on the reform of the Security Council\r\nis fraught with many difficulties and challenges. It is\r\nmy Government’s view that the simple enlargement of\r\nthe representation on the Security Council may not by\r\nitself necessarily lead to greater democratization of that\r\nbody. No matter how many reform theorems are\r\nadvanced, the will has to come from the permanent\r\nmembers of the Council that wield the veto. My\r\nGovernment has already urged an increase in the\r\nmembership of the Council, both permanent and non-\r\npermanent, but it seems to us that as long as the veto\r\ncontinues to exist, the Council will not be truly\r\nrepresentative of the wishes of the States Members of\r\nthis Organization and multinational diplomacy will be\r\nendangered. The Government of Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines makes so bold as to say that the solution\r\nmay also well lie in the removal of the power of veto,\r\nto allow for more democracy, greater participation,\r\nopenness and transparency. Only then, perhaps, will\r\nthis Organization regain its integrity and respect.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines cherishes the\r\nrelationships that it enjoys with all countries, both large\r\nand small, represented here at the United Nations. The\r\nUnited Nations Charter confers that freedom of\r\nrepresentation on all peace-loving and democratic\r\nStates. Yet my country continues to be deeply troubled\r\nthat Taiwan is still being excluded from this body.\r\nWhile we seek to make the United Nations more\r\nefficient and effective through much-needed reform,\r\nwe can advance the cause and the call for reform by\r\nmaking the United Nations more inclusive through the\r\nadmission to membership of Taiwan and its 23 million\r\npeople, who have no voice in the United Nations.\r\nTaiwan is an exemplary global citizen that maintains\r\nfriendly relations with almost every country in the\r\nworld. We would wish for this Organization to be the\r\ncatalyst that promotes constructive dialogue and\r\nfriendly engagement so that the Taiwan situation can\r\nbe resolved in a peaceful, just and equitable way to the\r\nbenefit of the entire global family.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is proud to be a\r\nState party to the Rome Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court (ICC). We believe in the fundamental\r\nrole that the ICC has to play in our collective quest for\r\npeace and the promotion of the rule of law and justice.\r\nWe are determined to uphold its integrity.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is proud of our\r\ncontribution to the emerging Caribbean civilization.\r\nLet me quote from a recent speech by our Prime\r\nMinister, The Honourable Ralph Gonsalves:\r\n“The reassembling of the African, Asiatic and\r\nEuropean fragments forms the basis of our very\r\nCaribbean civilization itself, which is at once\r\nshaped and yet evolving. Fundamentally, too, our\r\nCaribbean civilization, like all civilizations, has\r\nbeen built on labour — the producers — and the\r\ncontours of the society fashioned by the social\r\norganization of labour”.\r\nMy small country has made the painful\r\ntransformation from colonialism to independent\r\ndemocracy in 25 short years. Our people chose not the\r\npath leading to war and conflict, but rather opted for\r\nthe highway of democracy, racial harmony and respect\r\nfor human rights conducting us to peace, tranquillity\r\nand future prosperity. But we are hampered in our\r\nquest. My country, like others in the region, is in\r\ndanger of losing an entire generation to the scourge of\r\nHIV/AIDS. We need the help of the international\r\ncommunity in the fight against this dreaded disease for\r\nthe preservation of our society.\r\nOur banana industry, which is the engine that\r\ndrives our economy, is shortly to succumb to the greed\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nof certain multinational companies, with the active\r\nassistance of the World Trade Organization. Without\r\nthe banana industry, whose doomsday rapidly\r\napproaches, our hardworking peasant farmers will\r\nbecome just another casualty of globalization. The\r\nEuropean Union mandates that its sugar farmers get\r\npaid 50 euros per tonne — or five times the world\r\nmarket price. Their farmers then dump their product on\r\nthe market, thus depressing prices for farmers\r\nelsewhere. So we may shortly have to bid farewell to\r\nthe sugar industries of developing nations like\r\nBarbados, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Mozambique\r\nand Guatemala. The United States of America spends\r\nmore than $3 billion dollars of its taxpayers’ money\r\nevery year to subsidize its cotton growers. This,\r\nnaturally, signals death to the cotton farmers of\r\nBurkina Faso, Benin, Mali, Chad and other developing\r\nnations. How can the developed world, which\r\ncontinues to subsidize its farmers and which touts\r\nglobalization as the cure for all economic ills, continue\r\ndefending the indefensible?\r\nCancún, as we all now know, was an abysmal\r\nfailure. We went there hoping to be led into the\r\nPromised Land — only to find ourselves lost and\r\nabandoned in the wilderness. We will continue our\r\ncrusade for economic stability and democratic harmony\r\nin our country, but it is self-evident that we need the\r\nhelp of the developed part of the world in order to be\r\nviable. It will benefit no one if small countries like\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines are marginalized and\r\nleft to flounder. We are a vulnerable country. The\r\nreasons why small island developing States are\r\nespecially vulnerable are too well known to be repeated\r\nhere. Our requests for special and differential treatment\r\nin the WTO are completely justified and, for the most\r\npart, largely ignored.\r\nMy Government is cognizant of the fact that\r\nterrorism threatens us all. We are therefore fully\r\nengaged in the process of implementing Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) — a process which has\r\nstretched our limited resources. The oft-repeated\r\npromises of help in this process are proving to be, like\r\nso many other promises made within these hallowed\r\nhalls, just that — promises. Yet we read with grave\r\nconcern in the New York Times just last week that,\r\nbetween them, two of the giants of this Organization\r\nexport arms worth nearly $20 billion every year — the\r\nmajority, of course, to developing nations. What do\r\narms do in developing nations? They are the fuel that\r\nfeeds the flames of conflict and terrorism.\r\nUnless we can collectively find the courage and\r\nwisdom to tackle the problems of poverty, disease and\r\ndespair, all the weapons in the world will not prevent\r\nthe spread of terrorism. We need to move beyond using\r\nthe United Nations as a talk shop and come together as\r\nresponsible nations to tackle the root causes of\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe security which the poorer nations of the\r\nworld desire is obtained not through the force of arms,\r\nbut in relief from burdensome debt, employment\r\nopportunities, shelter, food, clean water, a healthy\r\nenvironment and access to medical care and life-giving\r\ndrugs.\r\nDespite its imperfections, the United Nations is\r\nthe forum that gives us hope. Let us work together so\r\nthat we can bequeath to our children and to our\r\nchildren’s children an Organization that can be used, in\r\nthe words of the Secretary-General, to save succeeding\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war, to reaffirm faith\r\nin fundamental human rights, to establish the basic\r\nconditions for justice and the rule of law and to\r\npromote social progress and better standards of life in\r\nlarger freedom.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. László Kovács, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Hungary.\r\nMr. Kovács (Hungary): Allow me to extend to\r\nyou, Sir, our sincere congratulations on your election\r\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nsession. You may rest assured of my delegation’s full\r\nsupport in the discharge of your important\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nIt is my painful duty to pay, along with so many\r\nof us, a tribute to the memory of Sergio Vieira de\r\nMello and his associates, who sacrificed their lives for\r\nthe people of Iraq in the service of peace and the\r\nUnited Nations. Our heart goes out to the families of\r\nthe victims of that cowardly terrorist act.\r\nThe world was shocked and saddened when a\r\nmost respected colleague, and a close friend of mine,\r\nthe late Anna Lindh, the Swedish Foreign Minister, fell\r\nvictim to a senseless act of crime in Stockholm. Her\r\nvision of the world and her deep commitment to the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations will\r\ncontinue to be a source of inspiration to all of us.\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nHungary aligned itself with the statement\r\ndelivered by the presidency of the European Union\r\nduring the general debate and fully supports it.\r\nWe live in a world of great opportunities and\r\nserious challenges. It is in this context that global\r\nproblems require global and concerted solutions. To\r\nthat effect, we must use the potentials of the United\r\nNations to make the best use of opportunities at hand.\r\nIn that respect, maintaining or restoring peace and\r\nstability, non-proliferation, development and human\r\nrights are in the focus of attention of the international\r\ncommunity. International terrorism, the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, grave armed internal\r\nconflicts, poverty and illegal migration constitute\r\nenormous challenges to all of us.\r\nHungary remains strongly committed to\r\nmultilateral institutions. We are firmly convinced that\r\nthe United Nations can and should play a major role in\r\nmeeting the multifaceted and ever growing challenges\r\nof our contemporary world. We, for our part, are deeply\r\ndevoted to assisting that role. Along with our partners\r\nin the European Union, we are more than prepared to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations as a unique instrument\r\nof a strong multilateral system to tackle global and\r\nregional issues for the sake of a safer and more secure\r\nworld. We will spare no effort to take an active part in\r\nmaintaining peace and security, enhancing the non-\r\nproliferation regimes, protecting and promoting human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, and establishing\r\ninternational standards.\r\nThe global fight against international terrorism\r\nmust remain a major priority of the United Nations. In\r\nthis context, we support the full and effective\r\nimplementation of the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions. Hungary is keenly interested in widening\r\nthe scope of multilateral instruments in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nAfter the success of the coalition forces in\r\nbringing freedom and the opportunities of democracy\r\nin Iraq, we have to turn our attention to the\r\nreconstruction and development of that long-suffering\r\ncountry. Hungary is strongly committed to supporting\r\nthe Iraqi people. Our fellow Hungarians are serving\r\nwith the coalition forces. We will also attend the\r\ndonors conference in Madrid later this fall.\r\nWe are closely following developments regarding\r\nthe United Nations assumption of an ever-increasing\r\nrole in Iraq. I would like to stress that the United\r\nNations has to assume its share of the work both in\r\nrestoring the sovereignty of Iraq and in the\r\nreconstruction process. I believe that our Organization,\r\nwith ample experience elsewhere, can play a\r\nsignificant role in the establishment of democratic\r\ninstitutions, the rule of law, respect for human rights\r\nand election-monitoring. We are studying intensively\r\nour possible contributions to this process. For the time\r\nbeing, though, our priority must be the stabilization of\r\nthe security situation in Iraq and the normalization of\r\nday-to-day life.\r\nHungary is deeply concerned by the grave and\r\ndeteriorating situation in the Middle East. We believe\r\nthat the implementation of the road map is the only\r\nframework for reaching a political settlement. An\r\neffective and credible monitoring mechanism is of\r\ncritical importance to that effect. The Quartet should\r\ncarry on with its mission in the peace process. We call\r\nupon both the Israeli Government and the Palestinian\r\nAuthority to dedicate all their efforts to the full and\r\nunconditional implementation of the road map.\r\nThe security situation in Afghanistan remains\r\nfragile. The Government of Afghanistan deserves our\r\nassistance and attention. Terrorist acts and illicit drug-\r\ntrafficking are causes for serious concern. I am\r\nconfident that, with the unwavering support of the\r\ninternational community, Afghanistan will soon be a\r\nbetter place for the Afghan people.\r\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\r\ntogether with the means of their delivery, is a growing\r\nand serious threat to international peace and security.\r\nThe danger of nuclear, biological and chemical\r\nweapons in the hands of terrorist groups and States —\r\nwhich are a menace to our world — represents new\r\nmajor security challenges, against which we must act\r\ntogether in a resolute manner, both regionally and\r\nglobally.\r\nEarlier this year, the European Union (EU)\r\nadopted a very important and far-reaching Declaration\r\non Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction.\r\nHungary will work hard with its partners in the EU\r\ntowards the effective implementation of that new\r\ninstrument and of the recently agreed EU Action Plan.\r\nIn the current world security environment, the\r\nTreaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) needs to be reinforced. We call on the States\r\nremaining outside the NPT to accede to it\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nunconditionally and to accept the nearly universal\r\nnorms of nuclear non-proliferation.\r\nRevelations about large-scale nuclear\r\nprogrammes and the failure to provide sufficient\r\nexplanations as to their purpose and nature have given\r\nrise to legitimate concerns on the part of the\r\ninternational community. There is a growing\r\nrecognition — shared by Hungary — that those\r\nprogrammes imply serious proliferation risks as well.\r\nWe view the first follow-up meeting of the States\r\nparties to the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC),\r\nheld at Geneva in August this year, as encouraging.\r\nThe participants rightly focused on practical actions.\r\nWe look forward to seeing further progress in\r\nstrengthening national implementation of the BWC at\r\nthe next meeting, in November.\r\nHungary remains strongly committed to the\r\ninternational protection and promotion of human rights\r\nand of fundamental freedoms, including the rights of\r\nminorities. The United Nations is the only universal\r\nOrganization dealing with worldwide standards-setting,\r\nprotecting human rights and addressing violations of\r\nhuman rights in individual Member States. All those\r\nefforts deserve our unqualified support.\r\nHungary continues to attach particular importance\r\nto the protection of the rights of minorities. Regional\r\ninstruments aimed at improving the situation of\r\nnational and ethnic minorities have already been\r\nadopted to that end without major difficulties. A\r\nuniversal instrument on the rights of minorities has yet\r\nto be elaborated. We believe that, given the necessary\r\npolitical will on the part of Member States, the United\r\nNations will be able to fill that gap through an\r\ninternational minority protection system. The more\r\neffectively we act, the more beneficial the service that\r\nwe will be able to provide with respect to protecting\r\nvulnerable minority groups through standards and\r\nnorms.\r\nHungary stands ready and is willing to join others\r\nin redoubling our efforts with regard to strengthening\r\nthe United Nations system. Multilateral institutions are\r\nin serious need of reform, if they are to live up to the\r\nexpectations of the fast-changing political and\r\neconomic landscape of our times. The United Nations\r\ncannot be an exception to that.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Frederick Mitchell, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and the Public Service of the Commonwealth of\r\nthe Bahamas.\r\nMr. Mitchell (Bahamas): It is my distinct honour,\r\non behalf of the Prime Minister, the Government and\r\nthe people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at this, its fifty-\r\neighth session. We share in the celebration of the\r\nelection of a distinguished son of the Caribbean to steer\r\nthe course of this body for the next year. My delegation\r\npledges its full support to you and to the other\r\nmembers of the Bureau in the performance of that\r\nchallenging task. I also take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate your predecessor, from the Czech\r\nRepublic, for his outstanding leadership of the fifty-\r\nseventh session. In addition, I should like to greet and\r\npay tribute to the Secretary-General, who continues to\r\nserve with great distinction, honour and exceptional\r\ncourage. My delegation salutes the Secretary-General\r\nfor the tremendous amount of work he has undertaken\r\nsince we last convened this body.\r\nI also wish to pause at this time to pay tribute to\r\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, the late Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, and to\r\nall other United Nations staff members who were killed\r\nor wounded in the deadly bombings of the United\r\nNations headquarters in Baghdad on 19 August and 22\r\nSeptember 2003. We feel that loss most deeply. For us,\r\nthe United Nations is paramount in ensuring the rule of\r\nlaw and justice in an increasingly complex world. An\r\nattack on the United Nations is an attack on the\r\nprinciples that bind us together as an international\r\ncommunity. We must stand firm against efforts to\r\nundermine those principles. There is no finer tribute to\r\nthose who lost their lives than to say today: Now, more\r\nthan ever before, we need the United Nations.\r\nSuch events remind us that the world is changing\r\ndramatically. It is imperative that we, as an\r\nOrganization, be able to respond to those changes\r\nquickly and appropriately. The Bahamas welcomes the\r\nongoing efforts to revitalize the General Assembly and\r\nto reform the Security Council. It is essential that those\r\nprincipal bodies be able to function effectively if we\r\nare to have any credibility and if we are to attain our\r\ngoals of maintaining international peace, security,\r\njustice and development.\r\nAs we are all too well aware, the process of\r\nreform of the Security Council has stalled, as we\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nremain deadlocked over critical issues. The time has\r\ncome for us to take hard decisions and to agree to a\r\npractical programme of reform that takes fully into\r\naccount the need for more representative membership\r\nas well as the need for a more democratic and\r\ntransparent Council. My delegation has raised those\r\nissues in a number of bilateral discussions with other\r\nconcerned States, and we look forward to working with\r\nthe presidency and with other delegations as we strive\r\nto rationalize the work of the entire Organization,\r\nwhile making it more transparent and accountable.\r\nWhile the problems in our own part of the world\r\nmay not have received as much international attention\r\nas have conflicts in other parts of the world, their\r\nresolution is of paramount importance to us. The\r\nCaribbean is our home, and we will spare no effort to\r\nprotect it against those who seek to destabilize the\r\nregion. The illegal transit of drugs, of weapons and of\r\nhuman beings is an affront to us and a serious\r\nchallenge to our national and regional security.\r\nThe Bahamas is grateful for the support that the\r\nregion has obtained from the international community\r\nin addressing these areas, but reminds Members that\r\nwe need to continue to be vigilant. We urge the\r\nAssembly to enhance its cooperation with the\r\nOrganization of American States (OAS), as that\r\nregional body strives to find solutions to difficult\r\nproblems involving territorial disputes between its\r\nmember States and as it seeks to promote human rights\r\nand to consolidate the foundations of democracy in a\r\nnumber of those States. In that context, we welcome\r\nthe OAS Special Mission for Strengthening Democracy\r\nin Haiti as a demonstration of the region’s commitment\r\nto this field.\r\nThe Bahamas is strongly committed to the further\r\nstrengthening of international efforts to prevent,\r\ncombat and eliminate terrorism in all its ugly forms,\r\nand supports the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the\r\nelaboration of a draft comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism. We are continuously reviewing\r\nour national legislation in order to strengthen it in\r\nthose areas, with particular emphasis on cracking down\r\non the financing of terrorism. Even now, a terrorism\r\nbill is before our Parliament. It will further strengthen\r\nthe laws that limit the ability of those who would\r\ncommit such acts to obtain monies to fund their\r\nactivities. The commitment of the Bahamas in this fight\r\nis unyielding.\r\nThe fight against the forces that would seek to\r\nundermine the rule of law in order to achieve political\r\nobjectives has forced each country to review its\r\ncommitment to freedom within and outside its borders\r\nand to determine how to protect the freedom that our\r\ncitizens so dearly cherish.\r\nLast year, in our address to the Assembly, the\r\nBahamas reminded this body that, in our quest for\r\nsecurity, we must not undermine the very values we\r\nwant to protect, preserve and defend. But it is clear that\r\nour conventions and established and respected\r\ntraditions are being challenged before our very eyes,\r\nand we must be careful to guard against this while\r\nensuring that all of us are safe.\r\nThe Caribbean as a whole is perhaps more\r\nsensitive than any other region to these issues of\r\nchange and the implications for the way of life that we\r\nenjoy, characterized as it is by an abiding respect for\r\nthe privacy of the individual. It should be remembered\r\nthat most of us in the region are small island\r\ndeveloping States, which are especially vulnerable in\r\nsecurity and economic issues. But, at the same time,\r\nour peoples are fiercely proud of our independence and\r\nthe traditions of freedom connected therewith.\r\nNowhere is the paradox of the pressure on our\r\nnow independent status more sensitive and apparent\r\nthan in the exercise of a presumptive legal authority by\r\na body of powerful, but faceless, un-elected\r\nbureaucrats, being advanced from some of the\r\ndeveloped world’s multilateral bodies, which, in the\r\nview of many, threaten to re-impose the status of\r\ndependence, without calling it so by name, and thereby\r\nundermining our economies.\r\nIn that connection, the Bahamas is particularly\r\nconcerned, along with its regional neighbours, about\r\nthe threats to its way of life, in particular as it is\r\nunderpinned by the legitimate wealth creation in its\r\nfinancial services sector. There are those who argue\r\nthat the financial services sectors in our region\r\nundermine economic development and wealth creation\r\nin developed States, but we maintain that the evidence\r\nshows that the wealth accumulation facilitated by the\r\nfinancial services sectors in the region assists in the\r\nfurther development and economic growth of the\r\ndeveloped world. Our country is committed to fair and\r\nequitable trade in services on a level playing field with\r\nestablished rules, without ever-changing goal posts.\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nOver the next year, we shall endeavour to bring\r\nthis matter more clearly into focus by calling, in this\r\nand other assemblies, for the convening of a global\r\nforum on the pressures being applied to small and\r\nvulnerable States in ways that threaten the\r\nindependence of these countries and, which some\r\nargue, is unlawful interference in the internal affairs of\r\na nation-State. It is imperative that any rule-making\r\nforum on these issues be open to all Member States of\r\nthis body. Similarly, all rules emanating therefrom must\r\nbe equitably applied.\r\nAnd so, as we bring these matters to the attention\r\nof the world, we repeat the obvious. The fight against\r\ninternational terrorism must be a major focal point of\r\nthe Assembly, as should other matters such as the fight\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS, the protection of the environment\r\nand the sustainable development of our fragile\r\necosystems.\r\nThe Bahamas is committed to fighting on all of\r\nthese fronts. It is especially concerned about the future\r\nof the world’s children and young people, as\r\nHIV/AIDS threatens to undermine decades and\r\ncenturies of progress in healthcare and in developing\r\nhealthy populations that facilitate economic growth\r\nthroughout the world. The Bahamas is a leader in the\r\nfight against HIV/AIDS in the region. We urge the\r\ncontinued and unrelenting fight against the disease, to\r\nrescue the world’s developing nations from the clutches\r\nof this most recent scourge. It must take all of the\r\npolitical will and financial power of the world’s nations\r\nto ensure that the scourge is brought under control and\r\nthen eliminated.\r\nThe Bahamas welcomes the outcome of the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on children,\r\nheld from 8 to 10 May 2002. We look forward to\r\nparticipating in the consideration of the follow-up to its\r\noutcome at this session. It is of critical importance that\r\nwe reaffirm our commitment to implementing the\r\nprovisions of the outcome document, “Building a world\r\nfit for children”, in the four priority areas of health,\r\neducation, protection of children from abuse,\r\nexploitation and violence, and combating HIV/AIDS.\r\nOur country and its people are especially concerned,\r\neven as I speak, about the safety and security, both\r\nphysical and economic, of children everywhere, but in\r\nparticular children in the Bahamas today, and about the\r\nneed to foster an atmosphere of love and care so that\r\nthey may grow into their rightful places in the adult\r\nworld.\r\nThe Bahamas, as do many of the small island\r\ndeveloping States, depends heavily on the environment,\r\nwhich is the natural beauty of the land, the sea and\r\nmarine life. Tourism is our lifeblood. For the region,\r\nthe natural environment is the primary source of\r\nsustenance and, therefore, we cannot allow our\r\nenvironment to be destroyed. Doing so threatens our\r\nvery survival. We are, therefore, acutely aware of the\r\nchallenges small island developing States face within\r\nthe context of achieving sustainable development. The\r\nsustainable development of our country therefore\r\nremains of critical importance to the Government and\r\nthus, we, as a matter of the highest priority, continue to\r\ntake steps to preserve and protect our environment.\r\nWe are also committed to working with all the\r\nother small island developing States and the other\r\nmembers of this Organization, civil society and all\r\nother concerned stakeholders, including non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, to ensure that the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action is fully implemented.\r\nIn that regard, the Bahamas welcomes the convening of\r\nthe international meeting to review the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action, which is to take place in\r\nMauritius in 2004, and we are proud to host the\r\ninterregional preparatory meeting in Nassau, which\r\nwill be held prior to that, from 26 to 30 January 2004.\r\nIt is our hope that the renewed commitment to this\r\ninternational meeting by all Member States will take us\r\na step closer to honouring our commitment to the\r\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation.\r\nIt is an inescapable fact that there can be no\r\nsocial or economic development without security. For\r\nmany of us in the Caribbean in particular, this security\r\nis being undermined by the activities of those\r\ntrafficking in illegal drugs and weapons. By virtue of\r\nits geographical position, the Bahamas continues to be\r\nan unwitting transit point for illegal activities,\r\nincluding the illicit trade in narcotic drugs and\r\npsychotropic substances. What is often overlooked by\r\nthose who are the consuming countries is that the\r\nBahamas neither produces these substances, nor does it\r\nproduce guns, nor is it the final destination for them.\r\nHowever, as a trans-shipment point, the Bahamas\r\nis suffering from a plethora of illegal activities\r\nassociated with this trade, including the deadly nexus\r\nbetween illicit drugs and the illicit trade in small arms\r\nand light weapons. These weapons, which are illegal in\r\nthe Bahamas, are contributing to an increase in violent\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\ncrime in my country and they are undermining the\r\neconomic and social fabric of our nation.\r\nWe, therefore, welcome the convening of the first\r\nBiennial Meeting of States to consider the\r\nImplementation of the 2001 Programme of Action on\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, held\r\nin July of this year. At the same time, we call on\r\ndeveloped countries to take the same extraordinary\r\nmeasures they use in seeking to stop drug trafficking\r\ninto their countries, to stop illegal small arms from\r\nreaching our shores from their countries.\r\nWe believe that the Charter constitutes a viable\r\nand firm foundation on which the Organization can\r\nbalance and achieve its objectives — to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security and promote economic\r\nand social progress. I wish to reaffirm the Bahamas’\r\ncommitment to the principles enshrined in that\r\nuniversal document, which will stand as a guiding\r\nbeacon as we continue to chart a rocky, yet crucial,\r\ncourse towards peace, security and sustainable\r\ndevelopment for all of the world’s inhabitants. While\r\nprogress may seem meagre, we must not be swayed\r\nfrom our course, and we must remain confident that the\r\nbenefits of our activities and efforts will redound to\r\nfuture generations. Now more than ever, the world\r\nneeds the United Nations.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Sergei Martynov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Republic of Belarus.\r\nMr. Martynov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): To\r\nbegin, I would sincerely like to congratulate you on\r\nyour election to this very important and difficult\r\nposition as President of the Assembly and I wish you\r\nevery success.\r\nThis year, the United Nations has come close to\r\nthe most dangerous brink in its more than a half-\r\ncentury of history. This is not only and not so much the\r\nIraqi crisis per se. That crisis has become but a\r\nmanifestation of what has really threatened the entire\r\nsystem of world order created after World War II. The\r\nbasis of this world order is the unconditional primacy\r\nof international law over the aspirations of individual\r\nStates.\r\nTake that away, and the world will again, as in\r\ncenturies past, become hostage to the power of the\r\nmighty. This will not merely throw us backward. The\r\nbeginning of the twenty-first century differs from past\r\ndecades and centuries in that the existence of a single\r\nglobal super-Power will make the rule of the mighty\r\nglobal in both scale and consequence.\r\n“We all have to recognize — no matter how\r\ngreat our strength — that we must deny ourselves\r\nthe license to do always as we please. ... Unless\r\nwe are all willing to pay that price, no\r\norganization for world peace can accomplish its\r\npurpose”.\r\nThese words, spoken by United States President Harry\r\nTruman, are as urgent today as they were back in 1945.\r\nWe call upon everyone to be guided by them today as\r\nthey were when our Organization was being set up.\r\nBelarus’ contribution to the creation of the United\r\nNations and a new system of international security was\r\none-third of our population, who gave their lives for\r\nthe victory of peace over war and the victory of the\r\ncoalition of the future over the coalition of the past.\r\nThat is exactly why we in Belarus today sense with\r\nspecial urgency the danger of the erosion of a just and\r\nstable world order.\r\nLet us preserve the coalition of the entire world\r\nfor global peace. Let us not allow the Security Council,\r\nas the main body for maintaining peace and security, to\r\nbe replaced by “coalitions of the willing” that use force\r\nwithout Council authorization. Let us not forget that\r\nonly a just peace can prove to be a stable peace.\r\nBelarus welcomes the emerging effort to return to\r\nthe United Nations its legitimate role in settling the\r\nIraq issue. This reflects the recognition that a military\r\nforce or an occupying force cannot solve the problem\r\nof nation-building. We hope that this will also become\r\nrecognition of the fact that a preventive war makes a\r\npoor foundation for security.\r\nWe hope that a new Security Council resolution\r\non Iraq being worked out now will strengthen the\r\ncentral role of the United Nations in the earliest and\r\nurgent return to the people of Iraq of its sovereignty, its\r\nright to independently determine its political future and\r\nits right to natural resources, so that constitutional\r\nprocesses and later election processes can be\r\nimplemented by Iraqis in the interest of Iraqis.\r\nAt the same time, Belarus is worried by the\r\npattern that is dangerous both for the future of the\r\nUnited Nations and for international peace and is\r\ntaking shape on the most urgent issues: the Security\r\nCouncil and the United Nations are ignored when\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nunauthorized military action is taken, and are then\r\ninvited back only in the aftermath, when their\r\nauthority, experience and resources are seen as\r\nessential for rebuilding a peaceful life. That is what\r\nhappened in Kosovo and what is happening in Iraq\r\ntoday.\r\nBelarus believes in the United Nations. We\r\nbelieve that it has a central role to play in the most\r\nurgent issues of today and that it cannot be replaced.\r\nWe believe in the constant values and justice of the\r\nsupremacy of international law and the fundamental\r\nprinciples of its Charter. New global challenges and\r\nthreats merely reaffirm that these values are\r\nindispensable.\r\nAs a founding Member of the United Nations,\r\nBelarus sees the need to modernize and adapt the\r\nUnited Nations mechanisms and structures to the\r\nrealities of this new century.\r\nOf special importance is the reform of the United\r\nNations Security Council. As has been correctly noted\r\nby the Secretary-General, it is not only a question of\r\nenlarging the Council’s membership. Life itself has put\r\non the agenda of the reform process many other\r\naspects, including the Council’s capacity to react to\r\nthreats to peace and security.\r\nIt is essential to achieve a reasonable balance in\r\nthe interrelationship between the main United Nations\r\nbodies, inherent in its Charter. A stronger role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is an important direction for\r\nincreasing the Organization’s efficiency.\r\nThe potential of the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly is underused. As an officer elected by the\r\nentire United Nations, the President of the General\r\nAssembly can and should be called upon to serve as a\r\ncatalyst and organizer in searching for solutions to the\r\nproblems the world and the Organization are facing.\r\nIt is necessary to reform and improve the\r\nactivities of the Economic and Social Council as the\r\ncoordinator of United Nations efforts in economic,\r\nsocial and related areas. Having accumulated\r\nconsiderable experience working in the Bureau of the\r\nCouncil, the Republic of Belarus is ready to make a\r\nconstructive contribution to these efforts. Those were\r\nexactly the considerations that guided Belarus when it\r\nproposed its candidature to Council membership for\r\n2004-2006.\r\nThe United Nations should pay priority attention\r\nto developing international law: new realities in\r\ninternational politics as well as new universal world\r\nproblems have to be taken into consideration. Belarus\r\nis a party to all key multilateral treaties regulating\r\nvarious spheres of international life. This year we have\r\nacceded to a further number of such treaties, including\r\nthe United Nations Convention against Transnational\r\nOrganized Crime and its protocols.\r\nThe international fight against terrorism that\r\nunfolded after the tragic events of 11 September 2001\r\nrightly placed the United Nations in the centre of\r\nantiterrorist efforts. The work of the Security Council’s\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee has helped in the\r\nforming of a global coalition under the aegis of the\r\nUnited Nations to counter terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations.\r\nWe must, however, be realistic: force alone can\r\nnever eradicate the abominable phenomenon of\r\nterrorism, at least, not forever. Injustice, inequality and\r\nindifference will bring it forth again and again, just like\r\nthe accumulation of electricity in the atmosphere\r\nproduces a lightning bolt. The Secretary-General is\r\nright when he states that in order to maintain a\r\ngenuinely global coalition for fighting terrorism the\r\nworld must also see progress on other fronts of the\r\nstruggle for a humane and just world order. Herein lies\r\nan important challenge for the United Nations, for\r\npermanent members of the Security Council and for all\r\nMembers of the Organization.\r\nThe principal contribution of Belarus to the non-\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons and to conventional\r\ndisarmament has been universally recognized. Our\r\nconcern is therefore all the greater with regard to the\r\ngradual erosion of multilateral norms in disarmament\r\nand the stagnation of the international bodies, above all\r\nthe negotiation mechanisms, in charge of international\r\nsecurity and disarmament.\r\nFrom this rostrum, we join in the appeal not to\r\nallow the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThis is a most important task. It should be noted, that\r\nfor many years, Belarus has initiated efforts to prevent\r\nthe development of new types of such weapons.\r\nHowever, has everything possible been done in recent\r\nyears, including by the most militarily powerful States,\r\nto strengthen the multilateral non-proliferation regime\r\nin all its most important aspects? Is everything being\r\ndone to that end today? An appropriate answer to that\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nquestion would be the ratification by all permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nThe activities of multilateral bodies in the area of\r\ndisarmament should be adapted to new realities. We\r\nproceed from the assumption that the United Nations\r\nshould draw up a clear-cut list of priority directions in\r\nensuring international security and generate\r\nprogrammes to overcome real threats to mankind. The\r\nresolutions we adopt should contain clear directives to\r\nexisting forums and structures in the areas of\r\ninternational security, arms control, non-proliferation\r\nand disarmament. Only with this approach will we be\r\nable to stop the devaluation of such notions as peace,\r\nsecurity and stability.\r\nI wish to inform delegations that Belarus has\r\nrecently taken another responsible step to strengthen\r\nthese values. While possessing the world’s seventh\r\nlargest arsenal of anti-personnel landmines, the\r\nRepublic of Belarus has joined the Ottawa Convention\r\non their prohibition. We count on international\r\nassistance in their elimination.\r\nThe norms of international law play a principled\r\nrole in shaping a just international economic order. The\r\nobjective of providing equal access to world markets\r\nand to the benefits of the process of globalization for\r\nall States, particularly developing countries and\r\ncountries with economies in transition, has\r\nunfortunately not been achieved. That is why we urge\r\nMember States to pay unabated attention to the process\r\nof developing the norms and rules of international trade\r\nand commercial activities in the interests of common\r\nwell-being.\r\nAfter the recent failure of the Ministerial\r\nConference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in\r\nCancún, the leading economic Powers should\r\nunderstand the risks of delaying the negotiations within\r\nthe WTO both on the issue of new rules as well as on\r\nthe problem of new membership. One should not forget\r\nthat providing an opportunity to all States to use the\r\nbenefits of the multilateral trading system is in the\r\nlong-term interests of peace, security and stability.\r\nI wish to inform the General Assembly that, as its\r\ncontribution to ensuring access for developing\r\ncountries and least developed countries to the world\r\nmarket, Belarus has made a decision to extend\r\nunilateral trade preferences to a large number of such\r\nStates. Our country’s National Centre of Technology\r\nTransfer has a high potential for innovation and is\r\nready for extensive cooperation with all interested\r\nStates. Its institutional capacities are intended to meet\r\nnot only our requirements, but the interests of\r\ndeveloping countries as well.\r\nLet me touch upon the problem of the\r\nconsequences of the largest technogenic catastrophe of\r\nthe twentieth century, the disaster at the Chernobyl\r\nnuclear power plant. We are grateful to the leadership\r\nof the Secretariat for its ongoing activities to mobilize\r\ninternational support in that direction. This year has\r\nbeen marked by the establishment of the International\r\nChernobyl Research and Information Network and of\r\nthe international Chernobyl Forum by the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency.\r\nJointly with the delegations of other affected\r\nStates, we have prepared for this session a draft\r\nresolution on strengthening international cooperation\r\nand coordination of efforts in studying, mitigating and\r\nminimizing the consequences of the Chernobyl\r\ndisaster. The document seeks to ensure the\r\nimplementation of a new United Nations strategy on\r\nChernobyl. We hope that it will be supported by all\r\ndelegations.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus also proposes an\r\ninitiative to hold in Minsk in 2006 an international\r\nconference timed to coincide with the twentieth\r\nanniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear\r\npower plant. The main objectives of the conference\r\nwill be the search for ways to provide normal living\r\nconditions to people living in affected areas and an\r\nexchange of experiences in solving the problems of\r\nsustainable development in those regions. We invite all\r\ninterested Member States and international\r\norganizations to take part in preparing and holding this\r\nevent.\r\nIn the area of counteracting international crime,\r\nthe fight against human trafficking and illegal drug\r\ntrafficking should become one of the United Nations\r\npriorities. Our country has been actively participating\r\nin international efforts to stop the modern slave and\r\ndrug trades. Located at the crossroads of the most\r\nimportant transportation corridors between Asia and\r\nEurope, Belarus offers efficient interaction in solving\r\nthese problems with all our neighbours and, especially,\r\nwith the European Union. Common efforts are needed\r\nto fight common problems; that way, everybody wins.\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nThe global scope of problems demands a global\r\nscale of interaction involving all States without\r\nexception. Mankind made itself the master of the world\r\nafter having become homo sapiens — sentient man. In\r\norder to become the master of its destiny, and not a\r\nhostage to challenges and threats, humanity should\r\nbecome humanitas sapiens — sentient humanity.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of the\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania.\r\nMr. Kikwete (United Republic of Tanzania): It\r\ngives me great pleasure on behalf of my delegation to\r\nextend to you, Sir, our heartfelt congratulations on your\r\nwell-deserved election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. My delegation is\r\nparticularly pleased at the way you have been\r\nconducting the work of the Assembly thus far. The\r\nskills and experience that you bring to the Assembly\r\nhave been amply proven in the past days of our\r\ndeliberations. I wish to assure you of the continued\r\nsupport and cooperation of my delegation.\r\nLet me use this opportunity to congratulate your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for a job well done during\r\nthe fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\r\nIn the same vein, I wish to pay tribute to our\r\nillustrious Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\r\nvaliant efforts in bringing the United Nations closer to\r\nthe people and in fostering peace and development\r\naround the world. He is discharging the functions of his\r\nhigh office in such a manner that he has won the hearts\r\nand minds of many people the world over.\r\nThis fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly\r\nis being held at a very momentous time in the history\r\nof the United Nations — a time when multilateralism is\r\nfacing serious threats and a time when the United\r\nNations, the main embodiment of multilateralism, has\r\nbeen confronting formidable challenges. Never in\r\nhistory have the relevance and mandate of the United\r\nNations been put to a greater test as in the past few\r\nmonths.\r\nCertainly, the tumultuous events of the past\r\nmonths have shaken the very foundation of our\r\nOrganization, but fortunately have not broken it. We\r\nare comforted by the fact that the United Nations has\r\nwithstood the test of time and emerged as not only\r\nrelevant, but indispensable in keeping world peace.\r\nLikewise, multilateralism has stood out as the only\r\nhope for all peoples. As we celebrate the United\r\nNations and its success, we should always remember\r\nthat it is our solidarity and steadfast adherence to the\r\nideals of the United Nations that have made our\r\nOrganization survive the trials and turbulence of the\r\npast year.\r\nI assure the Assembly that the Government and\r\npeople of the United Republic of Tanzania take pride in\r\nTanzania’s membership of the United Nations. We\r\nremain committed to its ideals and ready to work\r\ntirelessly towards its advancement, strengthening and\r\nsuccess.\r\nPeace and security still eludes the world, as guns\r\nand explosives continue to thunder and cries of agony\r\ncontinue to be heard across the continents. These days,\r\nviolations of human rights have become common\r\noccurrences, even among the developed countries of\r\nthe world. Wars continue to rage, with Africa and Asia,\r\nsadly, claiming the largest share. Acts of terror, too,\r\ncontinue to resonate all over the world. Since the last\r\nGeneral Assembly session, for example, terrorists have\r\nstruck in 12 countries.\r\nAs a country that has been a victim of\r\ninternational terrorism, Tanzania condemns terrorism,\r\nwhatever the reason and wherever it takes place. My\r\nGovernment remains committed to the war against\r\nterror. In this regard, we will continue to cooperate\r\nwith world Governments and institutions of goodwill to\r\ndefeat terrorism. I take this opportunity to inform the\r\nAssembly that Tanzania has ratified all the major anti-\r\nterrorism protocols. We have also enacted a\r\ncomprehensive legislation to deal with terrorism and\r\nterrorist acts in our country.\r\nIt is very saddening to note that even the United\r\nNations has become a target of terrorist attacks, as\r\nexemplified by the recent tragic bombing of the United\r\nNations headquarters in Baghdad, which resulted in the\r\ndeath of 23 United Nations staff members, including\r\nthe charismatic diplomat and chief of mission, Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello and his chief of staff, Nadia Younes.\r\nOnce again, we condemn this senseless act, while\r\njoining in mourning our fallen heroes. They died for\r\nthe United Nations. They risked their lives and died for\r\na just cause, for which they will be remembered for\r\never in the history of our Organization. Tanzania\r\nproposes that the United Nations erect a fitting\r\nmemorial in their honour and memory.\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nI mentioned earlier that Africa has had an unfair\r\nshare of violent conflicts and wars, especially when\r\none considers the rampant poverty and low levels of\r\ndevelopment on the continent. However, I dare say,\r\nwith a sense of guarded optimism, that we see a\r\nglimmer of hope in the evolutions of processes to\r\nresolve some of Africa’s seemingly intractable\r\nconflicts. I have in mind the conflicts in Liberia, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, the Sudan\r\nand Somalia, where encouraging progress has been\r\nrecorded on the path to finding lasting solutions. The\r\nmost welcome development in these conflicts,\r\nhowever, is the fact that African nations and leaders\r\nhave taken the lead in the search for solutions. They\r\nhave done so under the auspices of the African Union\r\nor their regional economic groupings. In several cases,\r\nthey have also intervened as individuals or as groups of\r\nneighbours or like-minded nations and leaders.\r\nTanzania appreciates the support of the United\r\nNations and the international community for the efforts\r\nmade by African nations and leaders in the search for\r\npeace on the continent. We appeal for continued\r\nsupport to sustain the peace in the reconstruction\r\nphase. Equally important, I appeal for timely support\r\nand action. Experience has shown that the support of\r\nthe international community, including the United\r\nNations, in the search for solutions to African conflicts\r\nis a bit too slow, or comes a bit too late.\r\nMy delegation is extremely pleased to have been\r\na witness, on 25 September, of the adoption of the\r\nprinciples of good-neighbourly relations and\r\ncooperation between the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda. It is a welcome\r\ninitiative. We commend the Secretary-General for\r\nconceiving the idea. Once again, I register Tanzania’s\r\nsupport for the initiative and promise that we shall do\r\nwhatever is within our means to promote its success.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to call\r\non the international community to extend the necessary\r\npolitical, economic and financial support to the\r\nTransitional Government in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, under the leadership of President Joseph\r\nKabila. We consider this critical to keep up the\r\nmomentum and avoid reversals.\r\nThe situation in Burundi, regrettably, remains\r\nprecarious. While we welcome the smooth transfer of\r\npower from President Buyoya to President Ndayizeye,\r\nwe also take note of positive developments under the\r\nTransitional Government. However, the Government\r\nand people of Burundi need to be supported to achieve\r\ncomprehensive peace and social and economic\r\nreconstruction. The regional leaders have been trying\r\nto help on the peace front and will continue to do so.\r\nSome progress has been made, but serious challenges\r\nstill lie ahead.\r\nThe unrelenting support of the international\r\ncommunity, especially the Security Council, is\r\ntherefore essential. We also call on the international\r\ncommunity to do more by way of extending economic\r\nand financial support to the Transitional Government\r\nof Burundi. It needs that support to effectively respond\r\nto the humanitarian needs in the country.\r\nMy Government welcomes the decision by the\r\nUnited Nations to convene the long awaited\r\ninternational conference on the Great Lakes region.\r\nPreparations are progressing well under the able\r\nleadership of Mr. Ibrahima Fall, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s special representative for the Great Lakes\r\nregion. There is good cooperation between him, the\r\nAfrican Union and the six core countries of the region.\r\nTanzania feels greatly honoured to be given the\r\nopportunity to host the Conference in June 2004. We\r\nstand ready to contribute to its success.\r\nThe Conference will undoubtedly provide an\r\nimportant forum to all concerned parties to deliberate\r\non important issues of peace, stability and development\r\nin the region. We also hope that it will give due focus\r\nto the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the war-torn\r\ncountries. I appeal to all in the United Nations to\r\nextend the requisite material, financial, political and\r\ndiplomatic support to the Conference.\r\nWe welcome the latest Baker Plan on resolving\r\nthe long-standing Western Sahara problem. We appeal\r\nto the parties to extend the maximum possible\r\ncooperation to Mr. Baker so that the people of Western\r\nSahara can have an opportunity to determine their\r\nfuture peacefully.\r\nOwing to our strategic position in a conflict-\r\nridden region, and our history of stability and\r\ntraditional hospitality, Tanzania has played host to\r\nthousands of refugees from neighbouring countries.\r\nThe influx began in 1959 and has not stopped to date.\r\nAt present, we play host to more than 800,000 refugees\r\nfrom Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and Somalia. We remain committed to our\r\ninternational obligations under the 1951 Geneva\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nConvention relating to the Status of Refugees as the\r\ncornerstone of international protection. However, our\r\n42 years of experience of hosting refugees have made\r\nus see the urgent need to review its relevance and\r\napplication. We are particularly concerned with the\r\nconcept and practice of burden-sharing, which does not\r\nadequately alleviate the burden of hosting refugees in\r\npoor developing countries like ours. We welcome the\r\nnew concept of “Convention Plus” espoused by the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees. We hope that new\r\nand emerging realities will be given serious thought in\r\nthe discussions and conclusions of the High\r\nCommissioner’s Executive Committee.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East remains a matter\r\nof great concern to my Government. When the Middle\r\nEast road map for peace was promulgated a few\r\nmonths ago, we became hopeful. My Government\r\nsupported it because it addressed comprehensively the\r\nissue of the establishment of a viable Palestinian State,\r\nliving side by side and in peace with Israel. Despite the\r\ncurrent difficulties, we still believe that the road map is\r\nthe most reasonable and viable way of resolving the\r\nlong-standing Israel-Palestine conflict. It is imperative,\r\ntherefore, that the obstacles on the road map be\r\novercome quickly. Violence and counter-violence will\r\nnot help.\r\nWe are also of the view that the use of excessive\r\nforce and recourse to extrajudicial measures in dealing\r\nwith Palestinian militants, or exiling President Yasser\r\nArafat, would be counterproductive; it would inflame\r\nthe situation. We appeal to the Quartet and the Security\r\nCouncil to do everything possible to bring the\r\nimplementation of the road map back on track.\r\nAs we all remember, at the dawn of the twenty-\r\nfirst century, the General Assembly at a special session\r\ndiscussed the challenge of poverty and development.\r\nAt the end we came up with the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nwhich embodied a vision of engaging in a\r\ncomprehensive offensive against poverty, deprivation\r\nand lack of development. The clear target of halving\r\nthe scourge of poverty by 2015 was set.\r\nWhen we look back and evaluate what has been\r\nachieved in the three years since the Millennium\r\nSummit, we cannot fail to discover that not much has\r\nbeen done. Provision of the estimated $50 billion to\r\n$100 billion additional resources required annually\r\nover a period of 15 years to finance the implementation\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals is far from\r\nbeing realized. The subsequent meetings in Monterrey\r\nand Johannesburg, as well as the successive G-8\r\nsummits, have been unable to meet the requirement. As\r\nit stands now, the Millennium Development Goals risk\r\nnot being implemented as expected. Indeed, something\r\nneeds to be done quickly to save that historic summit.\r\nIt is incumbent upon the developed countries to\r\ndemonstrate greater political will. Certainly failure will\r\nnot be good for our Organization and surely it will be\r\nbad for all of us.\r\nThe current wave of globalization is the greatest\r\neconomic process of our time. The unfortunate collapse\r\nof the World Trade Organization meeting in Cancún\r\nlast month demands that we face up to this\r\nphenomenon. We hope that summit will be reconvened\r\nsoon. The social imperative of the wave of\r\nglobalization presents us with two interlinked\r\nchallenges that are central to the work of this\r\nOrganization. These pertain, on the one hand, to\r\nfighting poverty, and on the other, to working on\r\nconstructive and inclusive measures to promote the\r\neffectiveness of global institutions in global issues and\r\nconflicts.\r\nThese concerns have also been at the centre of the\r\nwork of the World Commission on the Social\r\nDimensions of Globalization, established last year\r\nunder the auspices of the International Labour\r\nOrganization (ILO), with a mandate to promote social\r\njustice and decent work, linked to economic and social\r\npolicies for global prosperity. This World Commission,\r\nwhich my President is privileged to co-chair with\r\nPresident Tarja Halonen of Finland, is about to\r\ncomplete its work and is due to submit its report early\r\nnext year.\r\nThe Commission has been a forum of useful\r\ndialogue between eminent personalities with a wide\r\ncross-section of backgrounds, views and competencies.\r\nIt has consulted widely and extensively. Its report is\r\nexpected to generate practical ideas for change that can\r\nmake the process of globalization more inclusive and\r\nmore equitable. It will address the needs of those who\r\nfeel marginalized, as well as those who have benefited\r\nfrom globalization but feel uncertain about the future.\r\nIt will speak of the significance of a value-based\r\nmultilateralism and the role of this Organization.\r\nHowever, the recommendations, mandate and\r\nvision of the work of the Commission will not be\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nundertaken, pursued and achieved through the work of\r\nthe ILO alone. They will constitute a wide remit for\r\nother agencies of the United Nations, other multilateral\r\nagencies, regional groupings, individual Governments,\r\nnon-governmental organizations and civil society. It is\r\nalso hoped that the report will be submitted to this\r\nAssembly for consideration and appropriate\r\npromotional direction.\r\nIt is the hope of my delegation that the\r\nCommission’s report will be a welcome basis for\r\ncollective and concerted action towards the attainment\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals and in rendering\r\nglobalization a process that works for all, in all\r\ncountries, within countries and between countries.\r\nI would like to associate myself with the\r\nstatement made this morning by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Finland concerning the launching of\r\na Helsinki process on global governance and\r\ndemocracy, with which my Government feels proud to\r\nbe associated.\r\nThe fight against AIDS remains a major\r\nchallenge to mankind today. It is a war that we must\r\nfight and win. We realize the dire consequences of the\r\npandemic on human life and on our economies. The\r\nhigh-level plenary meeting held last week was\r\nreassuring and most of us came away from the session\r\nmodestly optimistic. Certainly, our resolve to squarely\r\nface up to the pandemic and to meet the set targets has\r\nto be coupled with equal responsibility for leadership\r\ninitiatives, accountability and more judicious resource\r\nmobilization and management.\r\nMr. Lamba (Malawi), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nReform of the United Nations Security Council\r\nhas been in the cards for some time now. Tanzania is\r\nconvinced that the reform of the Security Council is\r\ndesirable, to make this important organ of our\r\nOrganization more representative, more democratic,\r\nmore transparent and more measured in the conduct of\r\nits business. We believe that this will go a long way\r\ntowards renewing the confidence and support of\r\nMember States in the relevance and effectiveness of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nTanzania accepts the truism that reform is a\r\nprocess and not an event. We support the establishment\r\nof the high-level panel of eminent personalities to\r\nreview the functioning of major organs of the United\r\nNations. We look forward to its early constitution. We\r\nattach special importance to this process and promise\r\nto play our part.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Laurie Chan, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Solomon Islands.\r\nMr. Chan (Solomon Islands): I present the warm\r\nwishes of the Government and people of Solomon\r\nIslands on the election of Mr. Julian Hunte as President\r\nof the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I\r\nalso offer gratitude to his predecessor for presiding\r\nover the last session.\r\nAnd we salute the Secretary-General for his bold\r\nleadership of our Organization. Through him, Solomon\r\nIslands wishes to pay tribute to the members of the\r\nUnited Nations staff and others who lost their lives\r\nduring the senseless attack on the United Nations office\r\nin Baghdad last August and the recent incident a few\r\ndays ago.\r\nFifty-eight years ago, the United Nations was\r\nfounded to, among others things, guarantee freedom,\r\npeace and security and to promote economic and social\r\nadvancement to all people. Over the years, many\r\nthreats to international peace and security have receded\r\nor been resolved. The cold war has ended. Security and\r\narms control regimes are in place. Institutions such as\r\nthe World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and\r\nothers have been established to address the economic\r\nand social dimension of humankind’s needs.\r\nIn spite of these significant achievements, peace,\r\nsecurity and our quest for sustained economic and\r\nsocial development remain the main challenges of our\r\ntime. New and complex threats to international peace\r\nand security have emerged at alarming and global\r\nscales during the past decades.\r\nInternational terrorism continues unabated in\r\ndifferent parts of the world, targeting and killing\r\nmainly innocent and vulnerable civilians. There can be\r\nno other option but for the international community to\r\nredouble efforts to fight this evil menace on all fronts.\r\nSolomon Islands remains committed to its obligations\r\nunder Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). Steps\r\nare being taken to enact relevant legislation and to\r\naccede to international conventions to counter terrorist\r\nactivities.\r\nSolomon Islands believes that a lasting settlement\r\nof the crisis in the Middle East will have positive\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\neffects on global peace and security. We therefore\r\nsupport the efforts to bring lasting peace and stability\r\nto the region, especially to the Israeli-Palestinian\r\nconflict and the situation in Iraq. The United Nations\r\nmust play a crucial role in the Middle East peace\r\nprocess.\r\nThe primary responsibility of addressing the\r\ndaunting challenges we face today lies with individual\r\ncountries. However, history proves that much more\r\ncould be effectively achieved through multilateralism.\r\nWe all agree that this era of globalization brings new\r\nglobal challenges. And global challenges require\r\ncooperative global solutions. The United Nations, as\r\nthe leading and legitimate multilateral institution, must\r\ntake equal responsibility in addressing the global\r\nchallenges we now face and must therefore be\r\nstrengthened.\r\nThis is why Solomon Islands supports the\r\nSecretary-General’s ongoing reform of the United\r\nNations system as a process, not an event. Yes, the\r\nreform process has achieved positive results and\r\ngreater transparency, but we need to do more if our\r\nOrganization is to remain effective and relevant to the\r\nchanging political environment.\r\nA reformed and restructured Security Council is\r\nalso necessary. Japan, Germany and others deserve\r\npermanent membership in the Council. They are\r\nequally capable of contributing constructively to\r\nachieving and maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity. The use of veto power by the permanent\r\nmembers should be restricted to the provisions of\r\nChapter VII of the United Nations Charter.\r\nRestoring law and order, economic recovery and\r\nsimply bringing normalcy to Solomon Islands have\r\nbeen difficult challenges which my Government faced\r\nwhen we took office in December 2001. But having\r\nmade the commitment to address these challenges\r\nthrough the Government’s strategic plan and priorities,\r\nwe have engaged ourselves in a series of dialogues and\r\nconsultations with our development partners. Our\r\nintentions are clear — we want outside assistance to\r\nrestore law and order and economic recovery.\r\nLast July, with unanimous bipartisan support, the\r\nSolomon Islands National Parliament adopted enabling\r\nlegislation that authorized outside assistance to restore\r\nlaw and to help the economy to recover. Following an\r\nexplicit invitation by the Government, the Regional\r\nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI)\r\nled by Australia, was assembled and deployed under\r\nthe auspices of the Pacific Islands Forum’s Biketawa\r\nDeclaration and in accordance with the provisions of\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nI am pleased to inform you that the immediate\r\nimpacts of RAMSI have been significant and positive.\r\nSecurity in terms of law and order has been re-\r\nestablished and the Government’s finances are\r\nbeginning to stabilize. The course of action through\r\nRAMSI is the best option we took. It is a unique\r\nregional cooperative and partnership arrangement that\r\nis not merely limited to re-establishing and maintaining\r\npeace and security. It accords Solomon Islanders the\r\nbest real opportunity to rebuild the country and address\r\nthe deep-rooted problems we have had for years,\r\nincluding fighting corruption, restoring the principles\r\nof democracy, good governance and respect for\r\nfundamental human values and rejuvenating the social\r\ncohesiveness of our people.\r\nRAMSI’s work ahead will be challenging, but we\r\nassure RAMSI of every support and cooperation. The\r\nGovernment and the people of the Solomon Islands are\r\nequally committed to achieving this common objective.\r\nWe deeply appreciate the overwhelming support\r\nof the Pacific Islands Forum countries, expressed\r\nthrough the Forum Declaration on the Solomon Islands,\r\nthe Forum Foreign Affairs Ministerial Statement and\r\ntheir active contribution as Participating Countries in\r\nthe Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon\r\nIslands (RAMSI). These countries are committed in\r\ntheir resolve to help a neighbour recover and rebuild.\r\nFor this, I say “Tagio tumas for helpem fren blong\r\niufala”.\r\nWe also appreciate the support RAMSI has\r\nreceived from the wider international community, the\r\nCommonwealth, the United Nations, the European\r\nUnion and other individual bilateral donor partners. We\r\nlook forward to more active support to complement the\r\nimportant work RAMSI is doing in addressing the\r\nimmediate and long-term objectives and plans.\r\nThe Government’s National Economic Recovery\r\nand Development Plan of 2003 to 2005 will be\r\nformally presented to our development partners in\r\nNovember. Our immediate objectives are to restore and\r\nmaintain law and order, to bring about macroeconomic\r\nNote: Solomon Islands pidgin for: “Thank you for helping your\r\nfriend”.\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nstability and income growth, to restore full services in\r\nhealth and education and to re-establish the foundation\r\nfor sustained economic growth and human\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWhile the immediate security situation and\r\neconomic situation of the country are being addressed\r\nby RAMSI, the planned November meeting will\r\nprovide the opportunity for the rest of our development\r\npartners to define their respective roles and assistance\r\ntowards achieving these key objectives.\r\nAs a least developed and island State, our\r\neconomic, social and environmental vulnerabilities are\r\nmajor constraints to achieving sustainable economic\r\ngrowth and livelihoods. But we place our hope on\r\ngreater international support and partnership to address\r\nthese constraints in order to meaningfully and\r\nsuccessfully implement our national development plans\r\nand such key policy outcomes as the 2000 Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment (WSSD) Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation and other programmes within the\r\ndevelopment agenda of the United Nations.\r\nImplementation of the 2000 Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals has been slow. We have, however,\r\nnow incorporated those objectives into the\r\nGovernment’s Economic Recovery and Development\r\nPlan of 2003 to 2005, as priorities for national\r\nimplementation.\r\nThe Solomon Islands looks forward to\r\nparticipating fully in the review process of the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. We\r\nenvisage the outcome of the 2004 international meeting\r\nin Mauritius to be one that will focus on real\r\ncommitments and practical implementations of the\r\nProgramme at the national and regional levels.\r\nThe Brussels Programme of Action for the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries (LDCs) provides yet another\r\nopportunity and dimension for addressing the pressing\r\nproblems facing poor countries. Implementation of this\r\nProgramme at the national level has been slow. Real\r\ncommitments from the international community to\r\naddress our constraints, including capacity and\r\nindebtedness, have, however, not been forthcoming\r\neither.\r\nWe commend the work of the High\r\nRepresentative of the Office for the Least Developed\r\nCountries in seeking international support and\r\ncommitment to implement the Programme. We further\r\ncall on the international community to seriously\r\nconsider more resolute measures, such as cancellation\r\nof debts to highly indebted poor countries.\r\nAs a member of the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO), the Solomon Islands is equally concerned that\r\nthe Cancún meeting failed to yield positive results.\r\nLike other least developed countries, we have a key\r\ninterest in the development dimension of the Doha\r\nRound, and we wish to re-echo what we stated in\r\nCancún, namely that a new, equitable and fair trading\r\nsystem must take into account issues such as the\r\ndifference in income, economic size, technological\r\ndevelopment and private sector capacities of countries.\r\nThe Solomon Islands attaches great importance to\r\nregional cooperation. The communiqué of the leaders\r\nof the Pacific Islands Forum last August, which has\r\nbeen made available as an official document of the\r\nfifty-eighth session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly, reflects the range of issues that directly\r\nconcern us in the Pacific region. Those issues include\r\nclimate change and sea-level rise, fisheries and the\r\nprotection of our marine environment, trade,\r\nsustainable development and security-related issues. As\r\nsmall States with inherent geographical and structural\r\ndisadvantages, our strength lies in pooling our\r\nresources to address these issues collectively. We call\r\nupon the United Nations to take more active part in\r\nregional initiatives.\r\nAllow me at this juncture to express once more\r\nour strong support for Taiwan to be admitted as a full\r\nmember of the United Nations. It is an undeniable fact\r\nthat under international law, Taiwan is a sovereign\r\nstate. It has a transparent and democratic political\r\nsystem, a vibrant and progressive economy and a\r\nhighly efficient social system, all of which are\r\ncompletely independent with no control whatsoever\r\nexercised by the People’s Republic of China.\r\nTaiwan is a willing partner, able to meet its\r\ninternational obligations under the Charter. Its\r\ncontribution to the international community and the\r\nglobal economy are well known. Yet only a fortnight\r\nago, this body once again denied the wishes of the\r\npeople of Taiwan to be considered for membership in\r\nthe United Nations. Over the years the international\r\ncommunity has discriminated against its 23 million\r\npeople. The delayed World Health Organization\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nassistance to Taiwan during the outbreak of severe\r\nacute respiratory syndrome early this year is an\r\nexample of how reasons of power politics prevail over\r\ntimely humanitarian assistance.\r\nI have made the assertion that the United Nations\r\nmust remain relevant to the changing political\r\nenvironment. It must live up to the fundamental values\r\nand principles enshrined in its Charter. It must remain a\r\nuniversal and all-inclusive Organization, capable of\r\nserving all its Members, however big or small, however\r\npowerful or weak and of whatever creed, religion or\r\npolitical belief. Every country must be treated with\r\nequal respect and attention. The United Nations must\r\nalso live up to its principle of equality of all nations in\r\nthis new millennium.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Natan Teewe, Minister for\r\nCommunications, Transport and Tourism Development\r\nof the Republic of Kiribati.\r\nMr. Teewe (Kiribati): Allow me at the outset to\r\noffer Mr. Julian Hunte my warm congratulations on his\r\nelection as President. We are confident that he will\r\nguide our deliberations during this fifty-eighth session\r\nto a productive conclusion. Let me also express my\r\ndeep appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan,\r\nfor his effective guidance of the work of the Assembly\r\nat its fifty-seventh session.\r\nFour years ago Kiribati joined the United Nations\r\nas one of its youngest Member States. Our membership\r\nof the United Nations was an affirmation of our faith in\r\nand support for the noble principles enshrined in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nSince then, events have occurred to test the\r\nresolve of this Organization. Indeed, the United\r\nNations has faced many challenges. The recent brutal\r\nand calculated attack on United Nations personnel in\r\nBaghdad, which resulted in a tragic loss of life and\r\nmany injuries, are to be condemned. We mourn the loss\r\nof the Secretary-General’s senior representative, Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello, and the others who perished in the\r\nattacks.\r\nKiribati commends the Secretary-General for his\r\nunwavering determination to ensure that the United\r\nNations continues to perform the role we expect of it in\r\nthe international arena.\r\nWe have followed with increasing alarm the\r\nglobalization of terror. No longer can we in the Pacific\r\nclaim immunity from terrorism. The consequences of\r\nterrorist acts are abhorrent. Kiribati condemns\r\nterrorism and all acts of terror directed against innocent\r\npeople. We cannot condone acts of terror, regardless of\r\ntheir purported objective.\r\nEven though we have not been, and may never be,\r\ndirectly subjected to horrors such as that of 11\r\nSeptember 2001 and the terrorist acts in Riyadh,\r\nJakarta and Baghdad, we realize that terrorism knows\r\nno boundaries or limitations. It is a crime against\r\nhumanity and against the international community as a\r\nwhole, and we must therefore work collectively to\r\ndefeat it. To do so will require an international\r\nresponse backed by concerted regional and national\r\nefforts.\r\nAt the international level, Kiribati fully supports\r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions against\r\nterrorism. The Pacific Islands Forum is actively\r\naddressing security issues at the regional level. Despite\r\nfinancial constraints, Kiribati is pleased to have\r\ncontributed, within the framework of the 2000\r\nBiketawa Declaration, police personnel to the Regional\r\nAssistance Mission to Solomon Islands. My\r\nGovernment decided to contribute to that initiative\r\nbecause of our firm belief in the strength of regional\r\ncooperation. The Regional Assistance Mission to the\r\nSolomon Islands is a clear demonstration of the ability\r\nof Pacific Island Forum member countries to respond\r\nswiftly and cooperatively to requests from fellow\r\nmember countries for support in restoring law and\r\norder.\r\nWhile Kiribati appreciates the recognition of this\r\nregional initiative by the United Nations, we hope and\r\nurge that further assistance will be forthcoming to\r\nstrengthen and ensure the success of this undertaking.\r\nAt the national level, Kiribati has introduced\r\nvarious bills and taken other measures as part of its\r\neffort to address security challenges. This is an\r\nongoing process that will progress at a pace dictated by\r\nour financial situation, personnel and other constraints.\r\nWe are confident that, given our commitment, and with\r\nappropriate assistance from the international\r\ncommunity, we will in time achieve our goals.\r\nKiribati supports the idea that terrorism must be\r\neliminated. We must all fight against those who reject\r\ndialogue as a means of securing their objectives and\r\ninstead resort to terror. We would like to associate\r\nourselves with the many speakers who advocate that\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nwe exercise restraint. We must ensure that in our fight\r\nagainst terrorism we continue to uphold the principles\r\nthat are the cornerstones of this esteemed body — the\r\nprinciples that we cherish and in which we firmly\r\nbelieve.\r\nKiribati fully supports efforts to address the\r\nsecurity challenges facing the world today. We are,\r\nhowever, mindful that the magnitude of the security\r\nchallenges facing Member States differs.\r\nIn the case of Kiribati there are many challenges\r\nand problems that threaten our people and country.\r\nKiribati is one of the least developed countries and is\r\nalso a small island developing State located in the\r\nmiddle of the Pacific ocean. Our remoteness and\r\ninsularity, narrow economic base, small population and\r\nhigh population growth rate are factors that we have to\r\naccept.\r\nBeing a small island developing States poses\r\nmany challenges to national efforts in terms of\r\nsustainable development and beneficial integration into\r\nthe world economy. These unique characteristics\r\nwarrant special consideration for sustained and\r\nenhanced cooperation from development partners.\r\nKiribati has benefited, and continues to benefit,\r\nfrom the various programmes offered through the many\r\nUnited Nations agencies. In acknowledging with\r\ngratitude the support extended by the United Nations in\r\nthis regard, I would also like to record our appreciation\r\nto our development partners for their continuing\r\nsupport for our efforts at increasing and enhancing the\r\nequitable distribution of development benefits to our\r\npeoples.\r\nWe realize that a lot more needs to be done.\r\nKiribati has a vast exclusive economic zone rich in\r\nfisheries and marine resources. We are actively\r\npromoting the sustainable exploitation of these\r\nresources, and consider the establishment of an onshore\r\nfish processing facility to be an appropriate\r\ndevelopment.\r\nKiribati comprises low-lying coral atolls and is\r\ntherefore very vulnerable to climate change, climate\r\nvariability and sea-level rise. This is an issue of high\r\npriority for us, as it is for other low-lying countries. It\r\nis also an issue that requires an international response.\r\nPolitical commitment and a high level of cooperation\r\nby the international community are called for in\r\naddressing this challenge.\r\nThere is a need for immediate reductions in and\r\nlimits on greenhouse gas emissions to bring them into\r\nline with the objective of the United Nations\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. We call\r\nupon the major emitters of greenhouse gases to ratify\r\nthe Kyoto Protocol in a timely manner.\r\nWe recognize the need to develop and implement\r\nappropriate adaptation response measures, and call for\r\nsupport in this respect from international sources,\r\nincluding the Global Environment Facility.\r\nInternational support will similarly be required in\r\nthe joint implementation of the vulnerability and\r\nadaptation Pacific type 2 initiatives, launched last year\r\nat the World Summit on Sustainable Development.\r\nWe look forward to the 2004 international\r\nmeeting to be held in Mauritius. This will provide a\r\nvaluable opportunity to the international community to\r\ntake stock of what has happened since Rio and\r\nBarbados. We certainly hope that Mauritius will\r\nprovide a road map of concrete and practical actions,\r\nwhich are required to achieve the objectives of the\r\nProgramme of Action. While we accept primary\r\nresponsibility for our own development, we also realize\r\nthat the achievement of such aspirations will be beyond\r\nour reach if we have to work alone. We require the\r\nassistance of our partners in development.\r\nThese have been turbulent times for the United\r\nNations. Recent events have brought to the fore the\r\nneed for the United Nations to adapt. The rapidly\r\nchanging global environment in which the United\r\nNations operates demands adaptations if the\r\nOrganization is to continue to be of relevance to\r\nMember States.\r\nKiribati joins previous speakers in welcoming the\r\nreform initiatives outlined by the Secretary-General.\r\nWe realize that Member States must direct and actively\r\nsupport the adaptation process. The direction and\r\nsupport thus accorded to the United Nations will enable\r\nit to become more responsive to the aspirations of its\r\nMember States and those of the communities and\r\npeoples they represent.\r\nKiribati fully supports the view that the United\r\nNations and its major organs should be more\r\nrepresentative and more democratic in order to reflect\r\nthe expanded membership of the Organization. The\r\nrules so appropriate to situations in the 1940s cannot be\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\napplied practically and effectively in the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nTo conclude, we are faced with new challenges.\r\nWe must commit ourselves to tackling these emerging\r\nchallenges meaningfully. We must therefore be ready to\r\nintroduce and accept changes appropriate to our times.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nMr. Jean-Marc Hoscheit, Chairman of the delegation of\r\nLuxembourg.\r\nMr. Hoscheit (Luxembourg) (spoke in French):\r\nMs. Lydie Polfer, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, regrets that she is\r\nnot able to speak to the Assembly today and has asked\r\nme to do so in her place.\r\nThe current President of the European Union, Mr.\r\nSilvio Berlusconi, has already presented to the\r\nAssembly the priorities and positions of the European\r\nUnion, which Luxembourg supports with conviction.\r\nThe United Nations remains in mourning\r\nfollowing the cowardly and inhuman attack of 19\r\nAugust 2003 against United Nations headquarters in\r\nBaghdad, which took the lives of 22 persons — most of\r\nwhom were United Nations personnel — including that\r\nof Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special Representative\r\nof the Secretary-General. Today our thoughts are with\r\nthose victims, who, day after day, through their work in\r\nthe service of the Organization, helped to make the\r\nworld a better place.\r\nAs was recently noted by the Secretary-General,\r\nthat heinous act raises important questions, because it\r\nis\r\n“a direct challenge to the vision of world\r\nsolidarity and of collective security rooted in the\r\nCharter and articulated in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration”. (A/58/323, chapter I, para. 2)\r\nIt is our responsibility, as representatives of the\r\nnations of the world, gathered here at the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, to meet this challenge\r\nand to try to provide constructive answers that open\r\nprospects for the future.\r\nA few months ago, the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, Ms. Lydie Polfer, presented to the Luxembourg\r\nParliament her foreign policy declaration in a context\r\ncharacterized by the deep divisions in the international\r\ncommunity that marked the international situation at\r\nthe beginning of this year. At that time, Ms. Polfer\r\nelaborated on these thoughts, which also define the\r\noverall approach of the Luxembourg Government to\r\nmultilateral cooperation.\r\n“During the debates on Iraq, all sides\r\nextensively debated the role and the credibility of\r\nour shared institutions. Have they shown their\r\nlimits? Have they ceased to function? Are they\r\nstill adapted to our day and age? Is\r\nmultilateralism still relevant today? I would like\r\nto give a clear answer to this question. Yes, more\r\nthan ever, we need multilateral bodies that allow\r\nus to work together so that international law can\r\nbe established and respected, with international\r\nrules and procedures that ensure respect for\r\nhuman rights and that govern the lives of all\r\nStates, regardless of their size. This is not just\r\nwishful thinking, but something that is in our\r\ninterest.\r\n“We must not only assist in the development\r\nof these institutions, but also participate actively\r\nin strengthening them through committed and\r\nconstructive cooperation. The United Nations is,\r\nof course, the primary forum for such cooperation\r\nto take place”.\r\nBut while we believe that multilateral cooperation\r\nremains the best way of dealing with the many current\r\ninternational issues, we must, however, reflect on ways\r\nand means of adapting such cooperation to the\r\nevolution of our world, with a view to defining a new\r\nmultilateralism for the twenty-first century and to\r\nrethinking the conditions of a new kind of global\r\ngovernance. In this context, the Millennium\r\nDeclaration charts a steady course that will enable us to\r\nmobilize the international community to take action on\r\na number of specific, quantifiable objectives.\r\nAmong recent advances, I would like to highlight\r\nin particular the achievements registered at the fifty-\r\nseventh session of the General Assembly under the\r\nleadership of President Kavan; we commend the\r\ninnovative work he did during his presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We wish also to stress the process\r\nof reflection that was inspired by the Brahimi report on\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nMuch work remains to be done, however. The\r\ntwo recent reports of the Secretary-General on the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations Millennium\r\nDeclaration and on the strengthening of the United\r\nNations provide them with both an analytical\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nframework and an operational plan of action of vital\r\nimportance. We must provide them with concrete\r\nfollow-up.\r\nThe United Nations must remain the premier\r\ninstitution for meeting the challenges facing\r\nhumankind and for finding shared solutions. To quote\r\nthe expressive words of Kofi Annan,\r\n“The challenge ahead is to strengthen our\r\ncapacity for collective action and thus forge a\r\ncommon destiny in a time of accelerating global\r\nchange”. (A/57/387, chapter I, para. 2)\r\nWe must reaffirm the status of international law\r\nwhile developing it to take account of new situations\r\nand contexts. We are doing this successfully in the\r\nfields of the protection of human rights, the fight\r\nagainst terrorism, the environment, and in other fields.\r\nThe inception of the International Criminal Court\r\n(ICC) is a major stage, which we welcome. We hope\r\nthat it will soon begin work on the full range of its\r\nactivities, in accordance with the terms of its Statute.\r\nWe appeal to all Members of our Organization to\r\naccede to the Rome Statute in order to give the ICC the\r\nuniversality that will enable it to fight impunity for the\r\ngravest of crimes. We must continue, with\r\ndetermination and courage, efforts to reform and\r\nrevitalize our institutions. Much has already been done,\r\nthanks in particular to the efforts of our Secretary-\r\nGeneral regarding the Secretariat, whose structures\r\nhave been modernized and whose procedures have\r\nbeen rationalized, though work must continue,\r\nparticularly in the financial, budgetary and\r\nmanagement areas.\r\nLast week, the Secretary-General rightly drew our\r\nattention to the vital renewal of the intergovernmental\r\nbodies of our Organization — be it the Security\r\nCouncil, the General Assembly or the Economic and\r\nSocial Council. With respect to the General Assembly\r\nin particular, our President — whom I wish warmly to\r\ncongratulate on his election to his important post —\r\nundertook a certain number of initiatives aimed at\r\nrevitalizing our annual session, in order to give it once\r\nagain the central place it should occupy as the primary\r\nvenue for meetings, debates and stock-taking. I wish to\r\nassure the President that Luxembourg — which holds a\r\nvice-presidency of the General Assembly — will fully\r\nsupport his endeavours.\r\nThe ability to work with updated methods on a\r\nstreamlined agenda that focuses on the real needs of\r\nour day seems to us to be a prerequisite for the\r\nincreased presence and greater relevance of the General\r\nAssembly in international debates.\r\nImportant progress has already been made in the\r\nareas of peacekeeping and peace-building. The\r\npresentation in 2000 of the Brahimi report launched an\r\nintensive process of reflection and debate, and led to a\r\nnumber of crucial decisions aimed at more effective\r\nmanagement of peacekeeping operations. The adoption\r\nof Security Council resolution 1327 (2000) and the\r\nAssembly’s adoption on 3 July 2003 of resolution\r\n57/337, “Prevention of armed conflict”, constituted\r\nparticularly significant events, which we welcome, just\r\nas we support their practical implementation.\r\nWhile the debate has developed considerably,\r\npolitically and conceptually, we must emphasize the\r\nadmirable work carried out by the United Nations in\r\nthe field, in often difficult conditions. It should be\r\nrecalled that today our Organization is managing 15\r\npeacekeeping operations throughout the world,\r\nmobilizing approximately 40,000 Blue Helmets and\r\ncivilian staff. We can rightly be proud of this, without\r\nbeing complacent. The missions in Timor-Leste,\r\nKosovo and Sierra Leone have shown the decisive\r\nimpact that the United Nations can have when it has a\r\nclear mandate and adequate resources.\r\nHere again, much remains to be done. The\r\ndifficult situations that persist in countries such as\r\nAfghanistan, Côte d’Ivoire and Liberia and in the Great\r\nLakes region, not to mention the “forgotten conflicts”,\r\ncontinue to demand greater attention by the\r\ninternational community. By contributing to the shared\r\neffort, particularly in Kosovo and Afghanistan,\r\nLuxembourg has shown its readiness to assume its\r\nshare of responsibility in this regard.\r\nSpecial attention should be given in the future to\r\nthe problem of the transition from intervention in\r\nemergencies and crisis situations to the handling of\r\npost-conflict contexts. Integrating all dimensions,\r\nparticularly the political, humanitarian, security and\r\neconomic, in a single approach, perfecting the\r\ninstruments and methodologies adapted to this type of\r\nchallenge, seems to us to be an urgent and necessary\r\ntask.\r\nThe Government of Luxembourg is convinced\r\nthat the noble task of preserving peace must be based\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\non a broad and complex concept of security. New\r\nthreats have been added to the dangers of traditional\r\nmilitary confrontation. At the forefront of those threats\r\nare terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nTwo years after the deadly attacks of 11\r\nSeptember, which touched the entire world, we can see\r\nthat great progress has been made in the fight against\r\nterrorism. A firm position of principle and a\r\nmultidisciplinary approach remain indispensable in\r\norder to combat and stop this widespread and\r\ndestructive phenomenon. Luxembourg will play its full\r\npart in this effort, which must be pursued tirelessly,\r\nwith our Organization playing a major role.\r\nThe danger of the proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction continues to arouse the legitimate\r\nconcern of our peoples. World leaders have a\r\nresponsibility to confront this serious threat to peace\r\nand security by establishing and strengthening the\r\nnecessary international regimes. For its part, the\r\nEuropean Union has decided, on the basis of the\r\nEuropean Council’s Thessaloniki Declaration, to\r\ndevelop a long-term strategy against proliferation, and\r\nhas already adopted basic principles and a concrete\r\nplan of action to give shape to this strategy.\r\nLikewise, international arms limitation and\r\nreduction efforts, particularly with regard to small\r\narms, must be continued and broadened.\r\nBut, given the immediate and tragic urgency of\r\nviolent conflicts and terrorist attacks, we must not lose\r\nsight of a more structural cause of global instability\r\nand insecurity: the persistence of poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment. In a world in which every year\r\nalmost 15 million children under the age of 5 die of the\r\neffects of poverty, we must continue unabated our fight\r\nfor development. The Millennium Declaration, the\r\nconclusions of the Johannesburg Summit and the\r\nMonterrey Consensus have shown us the way and the\r\nobjectives to be achieved in order to establish a real\r\nglobal partnership for development.\r\nThe dimensions of this basic problem are many\r\nand interdependent. I shall cite just three.\r\nThe first dimension is the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, in which\r\nLuxembourg is strongly involved and which was quite\r\nrightly the focus of attention at the high-level debate\r\nthat opened this session of the General Assembly. The\r\nsecond is international trade. The failure of the Fifth\r\nWorld Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in\r\nCancún is undeniably a major disappointment. If we\r\nwant to achieve a balanced and more just trade system,\r\nit is imperative that we resume the dialogue on the\r\nobjectives to be achieved and the way to achieve them.\r\nThe third dimension is financing for development,\r\nwhich, according to the Secretary-General’s report on\r\nthe follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium\r\nSummit, remains “well below the level needed to meet\r\nthe Goals” (A/58/323, para. 49), even though we are\r\npleased at a recent rise in the volume of official\r\ndevelopment assistance. For its part, my country is\r\nparticipating in this global solidarity effort by devoting\r\nover 0.8 per cent of its gross national product to\r\nofficial development assistance, with a view to\r\nachieving the target of 1 per cent about midway\r\nthrough the decade.\r\nWhile development remains the new name of\r\npeace, we must not lose sight of other factors of\r\ninstability, such as ecological problems, new infectious\r\ndiseases, transnational crime and corruption, and,\r\nlastly, grave and repeated violations of human rights\r\nand threats to democracy and good governance.\r\nLet us not forget, in that regard, the wise words of\r\nMr. Annan, who has written:\r\n“Greater respect for human rights, along with\r\ndemocracy and social justice, will, in the long\r\nterm, be the most effective prophylactic against\r\nterror”. (ibid, para. 76)\r\nGiven these multiple threats, defining a\r\nprogramme of shared security on a global scale, within\r\nmultilateral bodies, is a primary objective. The\r\nEuropean Union, an international actor deeply involved\r\nin a vast process of enlargement and constitutional\r\ndevelopment, has begun the discussion of a strategic\r\nconcept of security and defence, which will make a\r\nmajor contribution to the international debate in this\r\nregard.\r\nFor more than a year, international attention has\r\nbeen focused once again on the situation in Iraq. There\r\nis no need to go over again before this audience the\r\nsequence of events that led last spring to the onset of\r\nwar in that afflicted part of the world. We all remember\r\nthe deep divisions that emerged in the international\r\ncommunity during that period, threatening to upset the\r\nvery foundations of our Organization. Regardless of the\r\nstand that we may have taken individually regarding\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nthese events, we must now look to the future to\r\ndetermine the prospects of a better future for the Iraqi\r\npeople. That is the objective that should bring us\r\ntogether now.\r\nWe are convinced that the United Nations must\r\nplay a central role here, on the basis of a clear and\r\nsubstantial mandate accompanied by adequate\r\nresources. While it is primarily up to the Iraqi people to\r\ndecide their own future, we all agree that sovereignty\r\nshould be transferred to the Iraqis themselves as soon\r\nas possible.\r\nIn the phase of political, socio-economic and\r\ndiplomatic transition and reconstruction, there must\r\nquickly begin a steady transfer of authority and\r\nresponsibility to legitimate institutions recognized by\r\nthe Iraqi people. That process must include the drafting\r\nand adoption of a new constitution, and the holding, as\r\nsoon as the situation allows, of free, democratic\r\nelections. Among the essentials for this are the\r\nrestoration of basic living conditions and security in\r\nthe daily lives of Iraqis, reconstruction of the basic\r\ninfrastructure and a rapid relaunching of economic\r\nactivity.\r\nThe Security Council and its members bear the\r\nprimary responsibility, but the emergence of an\r\nindependent, democratic, prosperous and peaceful Iraq\r\nis in the common interest of all Members of our\r\nOrganization. Together with its European Union\r\npartners, the Government of Luxembourg remains\r\nconfident that through a broad mobilization the\r\ninternational community will be able to make a\r\ndecisive contribution to this objective.\r\nYear after year, the General Assembly must\r\naddress the situation in the Middle East, particularly\r\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict, because progress\r\ntowards a just and lasting peace remains difficult. Even\r\nfaced with a resumption of tension and repeated acts of\r\nviolence and terrorism, which we emphatically reject,\r\nwe have a duty and responsibility to persevere in the\r\nsearch for solutions that will enable reconciliation\r\namong the States and peoples of the region. The search\r\nfor peace must be tireless. The European Union\r\nremains prepared and determined to play its role,\r\nespecially through its action in the Quartet. We remain\r\nconvinced that the course charted by the road map\r\nremains the right way to break the current impasse. But\r\nall players who are directly involved must display good\r\nwill and good faith in re-launching the peace process\r\nby creating the indispensable conditions of confidence\r\nand security. That is the urgent appeal that we make to\r\nthem, that is the urgent task that we must undertake.\r\nIn the face of wars and violent conflict, in the\r\nface of new threats, in the face of violations of human\r\nrights, in the face of poverty and underdevelopment,\r\nthe law and multilateralism are an often fragile but\r\nirreplaceable recourse for nations. While we must try\r\nvigorously to remedy the weaknesses and\r\ninsufficiencies in multilateral cooperation, it remains a\r\nsource of hope for the men and women of the entire\r\nworld. This is a hope that we must not betray, this is\r\nthe primary responsibility that is ours at this fifty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the general debate for this meeting.\r\nHowever, one representative has requested to exercise\r\nthe right of reply. May I remind Members that\r\nstatements in the exercise of the right of reply are\r\nlimited to ten minutes for the first intervention and to\r\nfive minutes for the second intervention and should be\r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Tekle (Eritrea): The Eritrean delegation is\r\ntaking the floor to exercise its right of reply to the\r\nstatement made by the Foreign Minister of Ethiopia\r\nrelative to the Eritrea–Ethiopia peace process, in the\r\ninterest of truth and to set the record straight.\r\nIt is true that the two countries signed the Algiers\r\nAgreements in 2000. The Algiers Agreements created,\r\ninter alia, a Boundary Commission, which was\r\nempowered to render a final and binding decision. The\r\nUnited Nations, the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) and the European Union (EU) became\r\nguarantors of the Agreements. The Ethiopian\r\nGovernment was fully aware of the content and\r\nmeaning of the Agreements. It is therefore not possible\r\nto talk about the Algiers Agreements without\r\nmentioning, as the Foreign Minister did, the central\r\ninstitution created by the Agreements, namely the\r\nEthiopia-Eritrea Boundary Commission.\r\nThe Boundary Commission rendered its decision\r\non 13 April 2002. The decision was endorsed by the\r\nSecurity Council and all the guarantors. The\r\nGovernment of Ethiopia also fully accepted the\r\ndecision and agreed to implement it without any\r\nreservations. It also lavished praise on the Commission\r\nand its members. Thus, the Foreign Minister had\r\ndeclared that:\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\n“Sanity has won over insanity and the rule\r\nof law has prevailed over the law of the jungle.\r\nEthiopia is fully satisfied with the decision of the\r\nIndependent Boundary Commission. According\r\nto the Algiers peace deal, both parties should\r\naccept the decision of the Boundary Commission\r\nas final and binding with no right to appeal”.\r\nThe Ethiopian Council of Ministers declared:\r\n“Accordingly, pursuant to the Algiers\r\nAgreement, the Federal Democratic Republic of\r\nEthiopia Government accepts and is ready to\r\nimplement the legal decision of the Commission.\r\nThe Government of Ethiopia would like to take\r\nthis opportunity to extend its regards to the\r\nBoundary Commission for discharging its duties\r\nwith a sense of responsibility and great care. The\r\nGovernment of Ethiopia would also like to\r\nexpress its strong interest in the speedy\r\ndemarcation of the boundary. In this respect, the\r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia\r\nGovernment would like to emphasize that the\r\nEritrean Government should honour its\r\nobligations to cooperate in the demarcation\r\nprocess”.\r\nBy April 2003, the Ethiopian Government started\r\nto have reservations and threatened to reject the peace\r\nprocess after the Commission recognized Badme’s\r\nstatus — which was the causus belli and consequently\r\nwas pregnant with legal and political implications,\r\nparticularly on the issue of who was the aggressor and\r\nwho the victim of aggression — as sovereign Eritrean\r\nterritory.\r\nOn 19 September 2003, the Prime Minister of\r\nEthiopia, wrote a letter to Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan denouncing the decision as “illegal, unjust and\r\nirresponsible” and rejecting the demarcation process.\r\nThis is what is critically absent from the statement of\r\nthe Foreign Minister. The truth — the bitter truth — is\r\nthat Ethiopia has, by rejecting the decisions of the\r\nBoundary Commission, effectively killed the Algiers\r\nAgreements.\r\nEthiopia’s rulers have in fact made it clear that\r\nthey do not regard themselves as bound by\r\ninternational norms and decisions, that they have\r\ncontempt for the rule of law and have decided to make\r\ntheir own determination on matters submitted for\r\narbitration and to then impose it on the Security\r\nCouncil. They are threatening to unleash another round\r\nof war if the decision of the arbitration commission is\r\nnot illegally reversed by the Security Council.\r\nYet they call themselves law-abiding, peace–\r\nloving victims of aggression. Is it possible for a\r\ncountry to commit aggression against itself? After the\r\ndefinitive location of Badme in Eritrea, does it need\r\nmuch imagination as to who has committed aggression\r\nor who is the victim of aggression? Must aggression be\r\nrewarded by the reversal of a final and binding\r\ndecision?\r\nEthiopia’s deliberate lack of respect for — and\r\nthe rejection of — the unanimous, final and binding\r\ndecision of the Commission, the decisions of the\r\nSecurity Council and the hallowed principles enshrined\r\nin the Charter is a threat to the intricate web of corpus\r\njuris and institutions forged by the international\r\ncommunity during the past six decades. Those who\r\nweaken the United Nations and its values, principles\r\nand norms by rejecting the rules of the game, including\r\nthe rule of law, must shoulder the appalling\r\nresponsibility of returning the world to the law of the\r\njungle, war and pestilence, and so must those who\r\nappease them.\r\nTo this end, the Security Council, which is\r\ncharged with the primary responsibility of the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, must\r\ntake the necessary measures to ensure that a State that\r\nhas solemnly signed an inviolate agreement, under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations, fulfils its obligations\r\nwithout any reservations. The United Nations, and in\r\nparticular the Security Council, must live up to its role\r\nas the guardian of the rule of law. It must not delegate\r\nthat mandate to any institution, whether international\r\nor regional, if it is to preserve the integrity of the peace\r\nprocess.\r\nIn spite of the past, the people and Government of\r\nEritrea believe in the United Nations and repose trust\r\nin it. We continue to have faith in the Security Council\r\nand the other guarantors and believe that they will act,\r\nwithout fear or favour, on the basis of what is right and\r\nout of respect for, and the preservation of, the integrity\r\nof the decisions of the Boundary Commission. They\r\nmust reaffirm the need to comply with agreements that\r\nhave been solemnly signed and reject any attempt to\r\nabandon them. In so doing, of course, they strengthen\r\nthe foundation and bolster the effectiveness of the\r\njudicial system of the international community.\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nMr. Kidane (Ethiopia): Ethiopia does not like to\r\nwaste the time of this body in engaging in allegations\r\nand counter-allegations, but we would like to set the\r\nrecord straight.\r\nPeace-loving Eritrea has committed aggression\r\nagainst almost all its neighbours in its ten years of\r\nexistence. Ethiopia, on the other hand, in its thousand\r\nyears of existence as a nation, has never committed\r\naggression against any nation in the world. Ethiopia\r\nhas a very clear record.\r\nIt was in 1998 that Eritrea committed aggression\r\nagainst Ethiopia. The place mentioned earlier by the\r\nrepresentative of Eritrea — Badme — happens to be\r\nthe causus belli. The African Union (AU) deployed its\r\nambassadors to find the truth as to who had\r\nadministered that area before 1998. The ambassadors’\r\ncommittee returned to the AU with a report of their\r\nfindings. The report was endorsed by the Council of\r\nMinisters and by the heads of State and Government of\r\nthe AU. It is a glaring fact that Badme was being\r\nadministered by Ethiopia before 1998 and that it has\r\nnever been under Eritrean administration — not even\r\nfor a single day. So that settles the issue: Eritrea was\r\nthe aggressor, and Ethiopia was the victim of\r\naggression.\r\nAfter the aggression had been committed,\r\nEthiopia literally begged Eritrea to leave Ethiopian\r\nland. Eritrea refused to comply until it was pushed out\r\nby Ethiopian forces. After pushing out Eritrean forces\r\nin self-defence, Ethiopia went deep into Eritrean\r\nterritory in the process of its counteroffensive. It was\r\nobvious to everyone that the Eritrean army was in total\r\ndisarray. But the Ethiopian Government — a peace-\r\nloving Government — decided to stop the war\r\nunilaterally, and our Prime Minister declared\r\nunilaterally that the war was over because the\r\naggression had been reversed. That was what\r\nhappened.\r\nIt was because of Ethiopia that the Algiers\r\nAgreement became a reality. There were brokers of that\r\npeace agreement: the United Nations, the Government\r\nof the United States and the European Union were in\r\nAlgiers as well and were witness to the Agreement. So\r\nit was Ethiopia, with the assistance of those\r\ninternational partners, that made the Algiers Agreement\r\na reality. If Ethiopia had not been in favour of peace,\r\nthere would have been no reason for Ethiopia to stop\r\nthe war and to declare it ended. Ethiopia could have\r\npushed into any area; Eritrea was not in a position to\r\ndefend itself.\r\nAfter the Algiers Agreement had come into being,\r\nEthiopia cooperated with the Boundary Commission, as\r\nthe representative of Eritrea rightly put it. Ethiopia\r\naccepted the delimitation decision. We still stand by\r\nour commitment, and we still accept the Boundary\r\nCommission’s delimitation decision. The problem\r\narose when the Boundary Commission failed to live up\r\nto its words — that is, its words in the delimitation\r\ndecision. Since the Commissioners had never been to\r\nEthiopia or to Eritrea, and since the Commission had\r\nnever carried out a field investigation, the Commission\r\npromised that there would be such an investigation\r\nbefore demarcation was completed. If any anomalies\r\nwere found in the process of investigation, such\r\nanomalies were to be corrected. Ethiopia requested the\r\nCommission to correct any such anomalies. The\r\nCommission suggested that there were anomalies, but\r\nthat they could be corrected only if Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea came together and provided the Commission\r\nwith an additional mandate.\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea are not on speaking terms\r\nand were not on speaking terms; therefore, there was\r\nno way for us to provide the Commission with an\r\nadditional mandate. So Ethiopia suggested to the\r\nCommission that it needed no additional mandate to\r\ncorrect its own mistakes. The Commission then\r\nsuggested that there should be dialogue between the\r\nparties. The Secretary-General and the Security\r\nCouncil also suggested to the parties that there should\r\nbe dialogue with a view to making the peace process\r\nsuccessful, but Eritrea remains adamant that there will\r\nbe no dialogue. There is no additional mandate for the\r\nBoundary Commission; the Commission’s delimitation\r\ndecision must be applied mechanically.\r\nAs it stands, the Boundary Commission’s\r\ndecision — which the Boundary Commission itself\r\nadmitted contains anomalies — divides not only\r\nvillages, but homesteads. The Commission based its\r\ndecision on the conduct of the parties, and it is very\r\ndifficult to imagine a single homestead being\r\nadministered by two nations; that is simply impossible.\r\nSo, as I said earlier, the Commission itself recognized\r\nthat there were anomalies but suggested that, in order\r\nto correct them, we come together and provide it with\r\nan additional mandate, and Eritrea refused. The\r\nSecretary-General and the Security Council suggested\r\nthat we talk, and Eritrea refused. So there it is.\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nWe should like to suggest to the Security Council\r\nthat the demarcation process should continue in the\r\nareas where there is agreement and that it continue to\r\nseek the facilitation of partners with a view to\r\nresolving the remaining problems. I should like to\r\nreiterate my Government’s position that we remain\r\ncommitted to the Algiers Agreement and to the\r\nBoundary Commission’s delimitation decision. We are\r\nstill prepared to have the boundary demarcated, but we\r\nseek the assistance of the international community in\r\nresolving the remaining issues. I would challenge\r\nEritrea to join us in that peaceful exercise.\r\nMr. Tekle (Eritrea): I just heard a series of half-\r\ntruths and non-truths from the representative of\r\nEthiopia, and therefore I must at least refer to two or\r\nthree of the issues he raised.\r\nThe first issue is the question of dialogue. The\r\nrepresentative of Ethiopia said that the Security\r\nCouncil, the Secretary-General and the rest of the\r\ninternational community have asked both parties to\r\nengage in dialogue on demarcation issues. That is\r\nincredible, because it is a blatant misrepresentation of\r\nthe United Nations position on the matter. Nothing in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s various reports, in the\r\nBoundary Commission’s recommendations or in the\r\nSecurity Council’s decisions even remotely suggests\r\ndialogue on demarcation. On the contrary, they urge\r\nprompt and full demarcation.\r\nFor example, paragraph 31 of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report of 23 June 2003 (S/2003/665) — we\r\nhad hoped that the Ethiopian representative would cite\r\nparagraphs, dates and reference numbers when he made\r\nwild allegations — emphatically declares that\r\n“expeditious demarcation of the border is crucial” and\r\nurges the two parties to cooperate with the Commission\r\n“so that these activities can be undertaken without\r\ndelay”. In his report of 4 September (S/2003/858), the\r\nSecretary-General declares, in paragraph 32:\r\n“In the same voluntary manner as the two parties\r\ncreated the Boundary Commission and selected\r\nits members, they must now accept its decisions\r\nand assist it in the expeditious demarcation of the\r\nborder”.\r\nHis report of 6 March 2003 (S/2003/257) indicates in\r\nparagraph 13 that\r\n“the United Nations would be prepared, without\r\ncompromising the Boundary Commission’s\r\ndecisions, to facilitate the resolution of problems\r\nthat may arise as a result of the transfer of\r\nterritorial control, as provided in article 4.16 of\r\nthe Algiers Agreement”.\r\nHow, then, could Eritrea have rejected a proposal that\r\nwas never made?\r\nI have Security Council resolution 1507 (2003) of\r\n12 September. I quote paragraph 6, in which the\r\nCouncil:\r\n“Reaffirms the crucial importance of\r\npolitical dialogue between the two countries for\r\nthe success of the peace process and the\r\nconsolidation of progress made so far, welcomes\r\ninitiatives to facilitate this dialogue, and calls\r\nagain on both parties to normalize their\r\nrelationship through political dialogue”.\r\nSo, political dialogue refers first to the consolidation of\r\nthe gains and, secondly, normalization of relations. It\r\nnever, ever, mentioned dialogue on demarcation.\r\nHistory will tell the truth about who had and had\r\nnot won the war. But a court of law decides where a\r\nplace is and a place is not. It is not for me to say\r\nBadme is Eritrean. It is not for the Ethiopians to say\r\nBadme is Ethiopian. We had an Arbitration\r\nCommission, and the Arbitration Commission\r\nemphatically and unequivocally said that Badme is part\r\nof Eritrea. There is total clarification on this matter.\r\nClarification was given. Badme was part of Eritrea, and\r\nwhether the Ethiopian representative likes it or not,\r\nBadme is and will be part of Eritrea. Whosoever\r\nattacked Badme is …\r\nThe President: I am sorry that I have to interrupt\r\nthe speaker, but the five-minute period is up.\r\nMr. Kidane (Ethiopia): We have come to\r\ndiscover that the word “dialogue” has become\r\nmalignant. It is considered a vice by our friends in the\r\nnorth. We have no aversion to dialogue. Eritrea has.\r\nThat is very unfortunate. We are sacrificing the\r\nlivelihood of our people. We are condemning our\r\npeople to poverty, because we cannot make peace\r\nbetween ourselves. I suggest that we should come back\r\nto our senses and start thinking about our poor people,\r\nat least for a single day.\r\nJust to set the record straight, I would like to refer\r\nthis august body to Security Council resolution 1507\r\n(2003) of 12 September, in which the Council\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.20\r\nsuggested that there should be dialogue between the\r\nparties with a view to realizing a lasting and durable\r\npeace.\r\nThe Algiers Agreement is about lasting and\r\ndurable peace. It is not a mechanical drawing of a\r\ntemporary line that will end up being a recipe for\r\nanother round of conflict. That what the Algiers\r\nAgreement is and that was what the Security Council\r\noutlined in its resolutions. That is a fact. We have a\r\nseries of resolutions in which the Security Council\r\nsuggested that there is a need for dialogue. There are\r\nalso letters addressed to the Ethiopian Government by\r\nthe United Nations on different occasions, and they all\r\nallude to the need for dialogue between the parties with\r\na view to sorting out the difficulties that we are\r\nencountering in the process of demarcating boundaries.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.35 p.m.\r\n"
