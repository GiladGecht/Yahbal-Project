Hunte. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Aïchatou Mindaoudou, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of the Republic of\r\nNiger.\r\nMrs. Mindaoudou (spoke in French): Niger is\r\ngratified by your election, Sir, to preside over this\r\nsession and through me assures you of its full support\r\nas you carry out the important mission that has been\r\nentrusted to you. We wish you every success.\r\nI also wish to address to your predecessor, Mr.\r\nJan Kavan of the Czech Republic, my sincere\r\ncongratulations on the skill, dedication and foresight\r\nwith which he guided the work of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session.\r\nI should further like to reiterate Niger’s great\r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the\r\nwisdom and efficiency with which he has guided our\r\nOrganization in a particularly difficult international\r\ncontext.\r\nOn 19 August, sadly, international terrorism\r\nstruck yet another symbol: United Nations headquarters\r\nin Baghdad. The attack claimed many lives, including\r\nthat of the Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Sergio Vieira de Mello. Niger reiterates its\r\nunequivocal condemnation of that barbaric act and\r\nreviles all terrorist acts committed anywhere in the\r\nworld.\r\nThe Government of Niger welcomes our\r\nOrganization’s determination to provide all necessary\r\nassistance to the Iraqi people, despite all the\r\nintimidation to which it has been subject. Such\r\ndetermination, however, can achieve results only if the\r\nUnited Nations is given a key role in managing the\r\nprocess of rebuilding a free and democratic Iraq that is\r\nthe master of its own destiny.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity must remain a priority objective of the United\r\nNations. In this respect, in addition to our ongoing war\r\nagainst international terrorism, we must pursue our\r\nefforts to free the world from the specter of weapons of\r\nmass destruction and the proliferation of small arms\r\nand light weapons. In that connection, the First\r\nBiennial Meeting of States to Consider the\r\nImplementation of the United Nations Programme of\r\nAction to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit\r\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its\r\nAspects at the National, Regional and Global Levels\r\nnoted that, despite progress made since the adoption of\r\nthe Programme of Action, control of firearms and their\r\nuse remains limited. That is why Niger firmly supports\r\nthe elaboration of binding legal instruments on the\r\nmarking, tracking and sale of such weapons.\r\nFor Niger, the regional approach must be given\r\npride of place in the settlement of conflicts, since it is\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nincreasingly recognized that most conflicts in Africa\r\nhave a subregional dimension. That is the case in\r\nparticular in West Africa, where stability in the Mano\r\nRiver region is linked to the situation in Liberia. It is\r\nalso the case in Central Africa, where stability in the\r\nGreat Lakes region is linked to the situations in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in Burundi.\r\nThat is why the Government of Niger feels that the\r\nstrengthening of regional peacekeeping and security\r\ncapacities, the cornerstone of the collective security\r\nsystem, must be based on enhanced cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and\r\nsubregional organizations.\r\nWith regard to the Jammu and Kashmir conflict,\r\nNiger believes that, despite the recent incidents, the\r\nimproved relations between India and Pakistan, which\r\nopened diplomatic relations in August, provide an\r\nunprecedented opportunity that must be seized to\r\nachieve a political settlement through the organization\r\nof a referendum on the self-determination of the\r\nKashmiri people, in accordance with the relevant\r\nresolutions of the Security Council.\r\nIn the Middle East, the vision of a sovereign and\r\nviable Palestinian State, peacefully coexisting with\r\nIsrael, must become a reality. In this regard, it is more\r\nurgent than ever before for the two parties to the\r\nconflict to agree to a ceasefire, comprehensive\r\nadherence to which would help relaunch the road map,\r\nwhich is showing signs of withering. Moreover, the\r\neventful history of the Israeli-Palestinian peace\r\nprocess — a history marked by recurrent setbacks and\r\ndashed hope — requires us to acknowledge that only\r\nthe presence of an international interposition force can\r\nguarantee an end to the bloody violence and create\r\nconditions for the effective implementation of\r\nagreements. Thus, Niger makes a heartfelt appeal to the\r\nUnited Nations, the Security Council in particular, to\r\nensure that this question be reconsidered with all due\r\nattention and in full responsibility in the interest of\r\nworld peace.\r\nNiger is deeply dedicated to the noble ideals of\r\nthe Charter and therefore strives for regional and global\r\npeace and is actively participating in efforts to achieve\r\ngeneral and complete disarmament. In that context, my\r\ncountry has always subscribed to the standards of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in order\r\nto achieve full transparency in the production, sale and\r\ndelivery of uranium. That position is reflected in our\r\ndecade-long cooperation with all actors in the uranium\r\nsector. We allow for no ambiguity. Niger continues to\r\nbe ready, as it has always been, to submit to the\r\nauthority of the IAEA for any verification related to the\r\nproduction and sale of its uranium.\r\nI wish to recall that, in this sphere, my country, in\r\naccordance with article III of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, has accepted, in\r\nagreement with the IAEA, the monitoring and\r\nguarantee system which, when implemented in good\r\nfaith as it is in Niger, offers absolutely no opportunity\r\nfor the kind of clandestine transactions of which my\r\ncountry was so unjustly accused.\r\nThe Development Goals defined in the historic\r\nMillennium Declaration must remain an ongoing\r\nconcern of the international community and guide\r\nglobal action aimed at the establishment of a stable and\r\njust socio-economic order involving greater sharing\r\nand solidarity. We cannot overemphasize the fact that\r\nthe achievement of these Goals requires reflection in\r\nspecific action of all commitments undertaken at the\r\nmajor international conferences and summits.\r\nWhat in fact have we been seeing? The\r\ninternational scene continues to offer the paradoxical\r\nand somewhat ignominious image of a world of\r\nenormous wealth in which the overwhelming majority\r\nof inhabitants still lives in total destitution. Despite the\r\ncommitments made and the consensus reached by\r\nGovernments of the entire world on this issue, we are\r\nobliged to note that the terrible vise of poverty,\r\nignorance and disease has only been tightened around\r\nthe poor peoples of the third world in general and of\r\nAfrica in particular. When we know, for example, that,\r\nsix years after the World Food Summit, 815 million\r\npeople throughout the world continue to suffer from\r\nhunger and 150 million children suffer from\r\nmalnutrition deficiencies, we can readily gauge the\r\nfeeble support of donors for anti-poverty strategies,\r\ndespite the lofty statements of intention that are\r\noccasionally mouthed.\r\nToday more than ever, the situation should pull at\r\nthe conscience of the international community and\r\ninspire us to greater solidarity and determination to\r\nfulfil our commitments. It is time to understand once\r\nand for all that the reduction of poverty is more than a\r\nmoral imperative; it is in fact a secure investment in\r\nthe promotion of a world of peace, prosperity and\r\nsocial progress.\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nIt is encouraging to note that, in recent years,\r\nAfrica has been at the core of major international\r\nconferences. From the Brussels Conference on the\r\nLeast Developed Countries to the Johannesburg\r\nSummit, as well as the Monterrey International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, the World\r\nEconomic Forum, the Evian G-8 summit and the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO) Conference in Cancún, to\r\nname but a few, Africa has been at the heart of the\r\ndebates.\r\nIt should be noted that, while these meetings had\r\nthe merit of having been convened, unfortunately they\r\ndid not respond to the urgent and enormous\r\nexpectations of the continent. In this regard, there is a\r\nneed to ensure consistency in global economic\r\ngovernance through the strengthening of cooperation\r\namong the international organizations and of the\r\ncompatibility of their decisions. It is only thus that the\r\nexcessive marginalization of Africa can be alleviated,\r\nbecause this is the appropriate way to bring the\r\npromises of increased official development assistance\r\nto fruition. Similarly, it is important to increase the\r\nflow of direct foreign investment into Africa.\r\nFurthermore, given the limited results achieved\r\nby current debt-alleviation programmes — the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries Initiative in particular — we\r\nmust now recognize that the ultimate solution lies in\r\nthe outright cancellation of the debt, the servicing of\r\nwhich is consuming the greater part of the budgets of\r\nAfrican countries and fuelling capital flight. There is\r\nalso a need for Africa’s trade partners fully to comply\r\nwith their commitments, in particular by improving the\r\naccess of African products to their markets and by\r\neliminating agricultural subsidies that create distortions\r\nin world trade.\r\nThe failure of the WTO Conference in Cancún is\r\na good illustration of the obstinate reluctance of the\r\nrich countries to take into account the legitimate\r\naspirations of the poor countries regarding the\r\nestablishment of just and equitable standards to govern\r\nworld trade. And yet, solving the critical problem of\r\nagricultural subsidies and of access to markets would\r\nhave made it possible both to enhance the badly\r\ntarnished credibility of the WTO and to provide a\r\nmeasure of consistency to the declarations of intention\r\nmade by the countries of the North. Above all and\r\nunquestionably, it would have contributed to raising\r\nmillions of people out of poverty. This lack of\r\nagreement means that the cotton workers of West\r\nAfrica, among others, can no longer live from their\r\nlabour and may be excluded from international trade, to\r\nthe benefit of more competitive producers who are\r\nbeing subsidized.\r\nCancún was a failed rendezvous of the Doha\r\nRound. WTO will certainly have to adopt a new\r\napproach and prioritize the settlement of agricultural\r\nproblems, which most agree are more important than\r\nthe interests of the multinationals.\r\nThe countries of Africa are fully aware of the\r\nneed to develop their relationship with their\r\ndevelopment partners within the context of\r\ninterdependence, cooperation and mutual\r\nresponsibility. In that regard, they acknowledge the\r\nimportance of judicious national policies and good\r\ngovernance, which they consider to be indispensable to\r\naccelerated development and, above all, to achieving\r\nthe 7 per cent growth rate required to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nThe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) is inspired by this consensual approach,\r\nbased on a new relationship of cooperation between\r\nAfrica and the developed world. NEPAD, a symbol of\r\nAfrica’s resolve to take its own destiny in hand, is the\r\nfoundation on which the African Union will rely to\r\npromote the growth and sustainable development of\r\nAfrican countries, individually and collectively.\r\nWhile we call for a massive flow of investments\r\nand the growth of official development assistance to\r\ncontribute to our development efforts, we, too, must\r\ncomply with our commitments in terms of mutual\r\nresponsibility. That is why my country, Niger, firmly\r\nsupports the implementation of the NEPAD Peer\r\nReview Mechanism. The Mechanism will play a key\r\nrole in the continent’s prospects as an instrument for\r\nbuilding strong States dedicated to good governance\r\nand sustainable development.\r\nIn drawing up through a participatory approach a\r\nnational strategy for poverty reduction, the\r\nGovernment of Niger intends to become deeply\r\ninvolved in the dynamic process of establishing strong,\r\nstable and competitive economies in accordance with\r\nthe objectives of the NEPAD Programme of Action.\r\nThe strategy document serves simultaneously as a\r\nreference framework for poverty reduction policies and\r\nprogrammes and as an instrument to mobilize financial\r\nresources. We are convinced that the implementation of\r\nthe poverty-reduction strategy will contribute to\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nimproving the dialogue of policies, to further\r\nstrengthening donor coordination and intervention, and\r\nto developing a multidimensional strategic partnership\r\nto translate into action the deepest hopes of the people\r\nof Niger.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I solemnly reaffirm the deep\r\ngratitude of the Government of Niger to those\r\ninternational partners which, at the poverty-reduction\r\nforum held last June in Niamey, proved their full\r\nadherence to the strategy and their commitment to\r\nsupporting its implementation.\r\nIn recent years, the world has undergone rapid\r\nand profound changes. These require us to adapt our\r\nOrganization’s functions to today’s reality in order to\r\nbetter to take into account the new challenges and\r\nlegitimate aspirations of the peoples of the planet and\r\nnot the specific interests of a tiny group of countries,\r\nno matter how powerful. That is why Niger firmly\r\nsupports the courageous reforms proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General to strengthen and improve the\r\nfunctioning of the Organization and to allow it\r\neffectively to cope with the challenges of our times.\r\nThe long-awaited democratization of the Security\r\nCouncil must be accompanied by a strengthening of the\r\nrole of the General Assembly, the highest\r\nrepresentative body, and of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, the guarantor of the advent of a new economic\r\nand social order.\r\nThe United Nations is at a decisive juncture and\r\nmust urgently regain the confidence of States and of\r\nworld public opinion, which has been sorely tested by\r\nrecent events. It is up to all of us to strive resolutely to\r\nthat end, because, as the Secretary-General has said,\r\nwe are the United Nations.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Maria Levens, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Suriname.\r\nMrs. Levens (Suriname): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of the Republic of Suriname, I\r\nwould at the outset like to take this opportunity to\r\nextend to you, Sir, a fellow brother of the Caribbean,\r\nand to the other members of the Bureau my sincere\r\ncongratulations on your unanimous election to guide\r\nthe fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nSuriname shares in the satisfaction experienced\r\nby the Caribbean region. We are convinced that, given\r\nyour vast diplomatic experience and skills, you will be\r\nable to guide the affairs of the fifty-eighth session of\r\nthe General Assembly in a most effective manner. In\r\nthis regard, I can assure you that Suriname will support\r\nyou in every possible way.\r\nMy delegation would also like to express its\r\ngratitude to Mr. Jan Kavan, the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-seventh session, for the\r\nmanner in which he chaired the affairs of this organ.\r\nWe wish him well in his future endeavours.\r\nLikewise, my Government would like to reiterate\r\nits support for Secretary-General Kofi Annan. His\r\ndedication to the goals and spirit of the Organization\r\nhas been exemplary and has served him well in\r\nprotecting the interests of humanity.\r\nMy Government strongly deplores the atrocious\r\nterrorist attack on the United Nations headquarters in\r\nBaghdad. Our thoughts are with the Secretary-General\r\nand with the bereaved families of those who perished\r\nas a result of the incident. We especially mourn the\r\ndemise of Sergio Vieira de Mello, a dedicated United\r\nNations staff member who laboured for the benefit of\r\nmany troubled societies.\r\nThe opportunities that arise from developments in\r\nthe world today are, unfortunately, not within reach of\r\nall the world’s children. This world order, which is\r\nwell-developed on the one side, copes with serious\r\ndevelopment setbacks in the economic and social\r\nsectors on the other. Economic downfalls, declining\r\nhealth services and the persistence of an international\r\nnon-supportive environment are all circumstances that\r\naffect the ability of Governments, in particular in the\r\ndeveloping countries, to adequately implement policies\r\nthat are required. There exists a wider disparity\r\nbetween the haves and the have-nots, not only in\r\neconomic terms, but also in terms of opportunities\r\noffered by the rapid development in the digital sector.\r\nGlobalization can become an avenue to global\r\ndevelopment only if it becomes all-inclusive and\r\nassumes a human face.\r\nThis idea was behind the sense of urgency and\r\nunderstanding that participants in the global\r\nconsultative process for development cooperation\r\nbrought to the meetings in Doha, Monterrey and\r\nJohannesburg. These meetings generated the needed\r\npolitical commitment and momentum, as did the\r\nMillennium Summit, at the highest political level. We\r\nmust maintain this momentum and continue to\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\ndemonstrate the political will and energy to implement\r\nthe decisions carefully drafted at these meetings.\r\nTo accelerate progress towards these goals, there\r\nis a need for a set of policies that generate stronger\r\neconomic growth, complemented by action to enhance\r\nthe capabilities of poor people to participate in growth\r\nand to access key social services. As agreed in Doha\r\nand in Monterrey, these efforts should enjoy stronger\r\nsupport from the international community, in particular\r\nthrough increased market access for developing\r\ncountries.\r\nMy Government also holds the view that it is\r\nnecessary for all relevant actors to continue to be\r\ninvolved in the process that should lead to the\r\ncoordinated and integrated implementation of the\r\noutcomes of these meetings. Such an approach should\r\nput us on a path of economic and social development\r\nthat reduces poverty and works for all the world’s\r\npeoples.\r\nInternational peace and security predominantly\r\noccupy the international agenda. The maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security is a major concern of\r\nthe international community, as declining security\r\naffects the protection of human rights and the very\r\nexistence of all human beings. It is therefore important\r\nthat global security be based on a secured and just\r\nframework that promotes the peaceful coexistence of\r\nall States. The Government of Suriname is of the\r\nconsidered view that the United Nations and its Charter\r\noffer the best guarantee for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Abidance by the\r\nsecurity framework laid down in the Charter is\r\ntherefore of utmost importance.\r\nDeclining security affects every member of the\r\ninternational community. It is therefore essential to\r\nincrease the involvement of the general membership of\r\nthe Organization in the agenda and work of the\r\nSecurity Council, while an increase in the membership\r\nof the Council should reflect the international political\r\nand economic realities and security needs of\r\ncontemporary global society.\r\nThe principle of human-centred security might\r\noffer the best possible and most effective road to travel\r\nin order to meet the security needs of today’s world. A\r\ncommitment to human-centred security will generate\r\nmore integrated international cooperation in many\r\nrelated fields, from conflict prevention to disarmament,\r\nincluding respect for the rule of law and for human\r\nrights.\r\nThe United Nations must continue to be\r\ninnovative in its search for effective ways and means to\r\nincrease global security. We must continue to argue for\r\nmore tolerance and understanding among peoples.\r\nSuriname is one of the most ethnically varied nations\r\nin the world, where people of different religions and\r\nracial backgrounds live and work peacefully together,\r\nand with a Government and Parliament in which\r\nHindus, Muslims, Christians and Jews form one front\r\nto collectively work on the development of our country.\r\nThe dialogue among civilizations, in particular\r\namong religions, must be encouraged. We must\r\nfurthermore seek to remove those circumstances that\r\ngive rise to situations that foster global insecurity. This\r\ntask must be given a central place in any overall\r\nstrategy to increase international peace and security.\r\nMaintaining international peace and security must\r\nincreasingly become a common responsibility\r\ninvolving all actors, Governments and peoples alike.\r\nThe restructuring of the United Nations must also\r\nresult in achieving a more effective General Assembly.\r\nIt is important that the General Assembly be\r\nperceived by the general public as an important\r\ninternational body contributing to its development and\r\nprosperity. A restructured General Assembly, as the\r\nsole universal deliberative body, must continue to\r\nspearhead the debate on development, but must also\r\nincorporate into its agenda other issues of a global\r\nnature that are of special importance to humanity.\r\nThe common task ahead is to collectively work\r\ntowards sustainable human development and to create a\r\nglobal society in which equity, equality and equal\r\nrights and opportunities exist for all human beings and\r\nextreme poverty can be eradicated. Achieving such a\r\nglobal society requires the involvement, determination\r\nand commitment of every Government, civil society\r\nand business sector, as well as coordinated and\r\ncomprehensive actions by all these actors in the global\r\nfight against poverty and injustice.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Lewis Brown, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Liberia.\r\nMr. Brown (Liberia): I am honoured to\r\nparticipate, on behalf of Mr. Moses Zeh Blah, President\r\nof the Republic of Liberia, in the general debate of the\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session, and to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at this session. I\r\nexpress the confidence of the Government of Liberia\r\nthat you will faithfully honour the responsibilities\r\nwhich you have been assigned.\r\nI also wish to commend Mr. Jan Kavan of the\r\nCzech Republic for the able manner in which he\r\nsteered the activities of the fifty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nUndoubtedly, Mr. Kofi Annan deserves the\r\ncommendation of this Assembly for his stewardship of\r\nour global Organization and the excellent leadership\r\nwhich he exudes in the resolution of international\r\nquestions, ranging from terrorism to the deadly AIDS\r\npandemic and from poverty to the imbalance in global\r\ntrade and commerce.\r\nWe must also pay a special tribute to Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello and other United Nations workers who\r\nlost their lives in selfless humanitarian service in Iraq.\r\nThose citizens of the world embodied the spirit of the\r\nUnited Nations and are true representatives of the\r\nconscience of humanity.\r\nTerrorism, the menace to international peace and\r\nsecurity, has brought immeasurable grief to the world.\r\nActs of terrorism have elicited neither the\r\nunderstanding nor the empathy of the world for causes\r\nto which terrorists may aspire. Contrarily, acts of\r\nterrorism have rightly ignited widespread disdain and\r\nrevulsion for their perpetrators. Today, terrorism seeks\r\nto undermine our collective freedom and therefore\r\nrequires our collective will and efforts to combat this\r\ncommon enemy.\r\nHowever, this objective is being undermined by\r\nthe lack of international consensus. The unwillingness\r\nto garner and work along lines of international\r\nconsensus has exposed cracks in our efforts to fight\r\nterrorism, bringing into scrutiny the structure of this\r\nworld body and the continued relevance of the Security\r\nCouncil. When the Security Council appears divided on\r\nfundamental questions of international security, the\r\nworld becomes vulnerable. A divided Security Council\r\nfertilizes the grounds for the germination of\r\ninternational terror and insecurity. If the Security\r\nCouncil is to serve as the guarantor of international\r\npeace and security, then that organ must of necessity be\r\nguided by mechanisms that ensure the judicious\r\ndevelopment of consensus and respect for and\r\nadherence to international law.\r\nAdditionally, our united condemnation of and\r\nfight against terrorism must never stoop to the\r\nemployment of methods not far removed from those\r\nused by terrorists themselves. To fight fire with fire\r\nwill leave our global village without a single hut. We\r\nmust muster the will to tackle the issues that are\r\nexploited by terrorists and terrorist organizations.\r\nThe conflict in the Middle East has inescapably\r\nattracted the attention of the world, posing the greatest\r\nchallenge to international peace and security. We are\r\nsaddened by and deeply concerned about the recent\r\nturn of events, which has occasioned the virtual\r\ndebunking of the road map for peace and ensured a\r\nclassic return to violence. Admittedly, there are serious\r\ndifficulties in the search for peace for our brothers and\r\nsisters of that troubled region. However, these\r\ndifficulties should neither beset us with a sense of\r\nhopelessness nor obscure the agonies and the fears that\r\nhave come to characterize the way of life in the Middle\r\nEast.\r\nWe therefore call on the Government of Israel and\r\nthe Palestinian Authority to recognize the right to\r\nexistence of each other within recognized international\r\nborders and to foster pragmatic approaches to dialogue,\r\npeace, security and the virtues of good-\r\nneighbourliness. At the same time, we urge the\r\nSecurity Council to develop, strengthen and maintain\r\ninternational consensus on the way forward.\r\nWith respect to the Liberian crisis, since our last\r\naddress to this Assembly, Liberia has wrestled and\r\ncontinues to wrestle with serious political and security\r\nchallenges. An insurgency that began four years ago\r\nreached the Liberian capital, Monrovia. Unsurprisingly,\r\nan already deteriorating humanitarian situation\r\nworsened, accompanied by the widespread breakdown\r\nof law and order. Regrettably, while recognizing the\r\nintensification of the war in Liberia and the right of the\r\nLiberian people to self-defence, the Security Council\r\nmaintained an arms embargo on the Government. This\r\nsituation catalysed the rapid advance of the insurgents\r\nand bestowed upon their cause a false sense of\r\ninternational approbation. The Liberian State teetered\r\non the verge of disintegration.\r\nBut for the resilience of the people of Liberia and\r\nthe timely intervention of the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) and the International\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nContact Group on Liberia, Liberia would have slipped\r\ninto the abyss of unbridled anarchy. We will therefore\r\nremain eternally grateful to ECOWAS, and particularly\r\nto the Governments and peoples of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Nigeria and Ghana, for their leadership in\r\nthe quest to stabilize the situation in my country. In a\r\nsimilar manner, the Government of Liberia expresses\r\nimmense gratitude to the Government of the United\r\nStates of America, the United Nations, the European\r\nUnion and the African Union for their respective roles\r\nin and continued support for the ongoing efforts to\r\nrestore lasting peace, security and democracy to\r\nLiberia. We must also pay special tribute to the support\r\nof the Governments of South Africa and Mozambique.\r\nOn 11 August 2003, with the deployment of a\r\nvanguard force from the friendly Government of the\r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria, the promise of a smooth\r\ntransfer of power was remarkably fulfilled. This\r\ndevelopment energized the signing, on 18 August in\r\nAccra, Republic of Ghana, of a Comprehensive Peace\r\nAgreement. The Agreement establishes a framework\r\nfor the formation and installation of a transitional\r\nGovernment, the disarmament, demobilization and\r\nreintegration of combatants and the restructuring of the\r\nnational security apparatus. It also provides for the\r\nrepatriation and resettlement of refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons, the rebuilding of the nation’s\r\nproductive capacity and the creation of democratic\r\nspace for the conduct of free, fair and credible\r\nelections in 2005. These goals cannot be achieved\r\nwithout concerted multinational collaboration and\r\nassistance.\r\nThe Government of Liberia welcomes the\r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1509 (2003),\r\nwhich establishes the United Nations Mission in\r\nLiberia. We pledge our cooperation and support to the\r\nrealization of the objectives set out in the resolution.\r\nComprehensive disarmament, demobilization and a\r\nsustained programme of reintegration and resettlement\r\nare sine qua non to peace, security and stability in\r\nLiberia and the West African subregion. The\r\nGovernment of Liberia is therefore beholden to the\r\ninternational community, with gratitude for its\r\ncontinuous assistance and support in the search for\r\npeace and security in Liberia and the West African\r\nsubregion. However, unless democratic expressions\r\nand aspirations are allowed to flourish through\r\nstrengthened democratic institutions, and unless an\r\nalternative source of livelihood is provided the\r\ndisarmed combatants, the gains obtained through the\r\nsupport of the international community could be\r\ngrievously undermined.\r\nIn this respect, resolution 1509 (2003), which\r\nengenders new hope for Liberia, appears to be\r\ncontradicted by the demands of resolution 1343 (2001).\r\nThat resolution imposes and maintains a regime of\r\nsanctions and other restrictions on Liberia. Unarguably,\r\neconomic sanctions imposed under resolution 1343\r\n(2001) becloud Liberia with an undeserved stigma that,\r\nin effect, discourages the flow of much-needed\r\ninternational investment into the private sector to\r\nsupport Liberia’s post-conflict reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment programmes and restricts the essential\r\nflow of energy needed to revive Liberia’s economic\r\ninfrastructure.\r\nA vibrant private sector is the key to Liberia’s\r\nrecovery and the cure to problems of unemployment,\r\nwhich provides stimulus to social unrest and political\r\ninstability. If sanctions, smart or targeted, are tools to\r\naccomplish political objectives, then they must respond\r\naffirmatively to the realization of the objectives. One\r\ndoes not administer medication to a dead person nor\r\ndoes one take medication to cure the illness of another.\r\nThe Government of Liberia therefore calls on the\r\nSecurity Council to lift its regime of economic\r\nsanctions imposed on the country.\r\nIn situations such as ours, international goodwill\r\nand assistance are often accompanied by the temptation\r\nto ignore indigenous expertise largely in favour of\r\nexpatriates. The net effect of adherence to such\r\ntemptation is the development of structures and\r\ninstitutions that are neither manageable nor sustainable\r\nby the beneficiaries after the departure of the\r\nexpatriates. Even so, Liberia is blessed with its share of\r\nendowments in human and natural resources. As can be\r\nexpected, years of political turmoil, conflict and\r\nmismanagement have resulted in the massive exodus of\r\nLiberia’s human resources. Welcoming a new\r\nopportunity to rebuild a more democratic, accountable\r\nand coherent society, Liberians are desperate to return\r\nhome and contribute. To that end, it is the desire and\r\nexpectation of the Government and people of Liberia\r\nthat, as much as is possible, Liberians will be\r\nemployed at all levels in the post-conflict\r\nreconstruction and rehabilitation of their country.\r\nLiberia is a founding Member of this world body.\r\nIrrespective of the current problems we face and our\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nneed for international assistance, Liberia will remain a\r\nrespectable member of the international community.\r\nWe intend to uphold our sovereign dignity in the\r\nconduct of international affairs. Liberia cannot and will\r\nnot be a subject of trusteeship.\r\nLike most third-world nations, Liberia is deeply\r\nindebted to several international financial institutions\r\nand organizations. We are grateful to our creditors for\r\ntheir patience and understanding. Determined as we are\r\nto survive, we count on the empathy of the\r\ninternational community to treat our indebtedness with\r\nthe uniqueness that it deserves and pledge our\r\ncommitment to working along with those institutions in\r\ndeveloping appropriate mechanisms to deal with\r\nLiberia’s debt. Servicing these debts remains a priority\r\nfor the Government of Liberia. However, our capacity\r\nto make payment is limited by manifold problems\r\noccasioned by several years of continuous warfare.\r\nI should now like to turn to the case of the\r\nRepublic of China. The General Assembly must\r\nconfront the moral and legal challenges posed by the\r\nexclusion of more than 23 million people from\r\nrepresentation in this world body. How else are we to\r\nexplain the denial of the rights of a progressive and\r\nindustrious people from representation at the level of\r\nthe General Assembly? The fact remains that the\r\nGovernment and people of the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan have, and continue to engage in, responsible\r\nself-governance. It is incontestable that the people of\r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan continue to\r\nsignificantly contribute to the improvement of the\r\nhuman family. Their achievements in the spheres of\r\nscience and technology, commerce and trade, and the\r\narts and culture cannot be ignored.\r\nThe undaunted spirit of the great people of the\r\nRepublic of China aspires to participate in the United\r\nNations. Liberia is convinced that the participation of\r\nboth sides of the Taiwan Strait in the activities of\r\ninternational organizations will encourage greater\r\nunderstanding and mutual trust between the two sides.\r\nThat is consistent with the spirit of preventive\r\ndiplomacy advocated by the United Nations. Liberia\r\ntherefore reiterates its call for the admission of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan to the United Nations and\r\nits specialized agencies, as well as the assumption of\r\nits rightful place in the discourse and transaction of\r\nworld affairs.\r\nIn conclusion, Liberia is today in urgent need of\r\ninternational assistance and support. While our\r\nsituation appears to be grim, it is certainly not\r\nhopeless. While many of our compatriots may have lost\r\nlives and limbs, we are still a forgiving people. While\r\nour national infrastructure may have been destroyed,\r\nwe are still a resilient people. While our dignity may\r\nhave been impinged upon, we are still a proud people.\r\nWe Liberians are unified in our determination to work\r\nfor a better and brighter future. We are united in\r\nfostering the faith of our founding fathers to build a\r\nnation dedicated to freedom, liberty and justice for all.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Irakli Menagarishvili, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Georgia.\r\nMr. Menagarishvili (Georgia): Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the\r\npresidency of the fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly. Allow me also to express our heartfelt\r\nappreciation to Mr. Jan Kavan for his outstanding\r\nleadership during the previous session. I would also\r\nlike to pay tribute to Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and\r\nthe United Nations staff members who fell victim to\r\ncowardly and blind rage in Baghdad. The dreadful\r\nterrorist attack perpetrated against those messengers of\r\npeace once again highlighted the danger we face in\r\nmany corners of the world.\r\nIn recent years, the United Nations and the entire\r\nworld community have come up against challenges that\r\nthreaten the very basis of the Organization and our\r\ncollective efforts towards global peace and security.\r\nInternational terrorism, a threat with a global\r\ndimension, affects each and every one of us. However,\r\nit has become evident that many of the new\r\ndemocracies are particularly vulnerable to that threat.\r\nScarce material resources and the lack of qualified\r\npersonnel undermine their efforts, highlighting the\r\nneed for further intensified global cooperation.\r\nGeorgia is no exception when it comes to threats\r\nposed by international terrorism. However, despite\r\nexisting difficulties, and with the active support and\r\nassistance of our partners, especially the United States,\r\nwe have made substantial progress. Georgia\r\nsuccessfully completed its anti-criminal and anti-\r\nterrorist operation in the Pankisi Gorge. We have freed\r\nthat territory from illegal armed groups and have seized\r\na considerable number of arms and ammunition. I can\r\nunequivocally state today that the Pankisi Gorge, which\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nhas been freed of every illegally armed person, no\r\nlonger poses any threat to Georgia or its neighbours.\r\nHowever, unless the root cause of the Pankisi Gorge\r\nproblem is settled, namely, the conflict in Chechnya,\r\nwe cannot consider the problem eliminated. The lesson\r\nto be drawn from this experience is that the fight\r\nagainst terrorism, in all its complexity, will be\r\nsuccessful only if carried out through concerted\r\ninternational efforts. A single quick-fix operation can\r\ncause the problem to resurface at a later stage.\r\nMany of the speakers who spoke before me\r\nhighlighted the importance of tackling the threat of\r\ninternational terrorism in all its aspects. We cannot but\r\nshare that notion. Protracted problems, and in\r\nparticular unresolved conflicts that result in the\r\ncreation of uncontrolled territories, have become a\r\nbreeding ground for terrorism. It is only a matter of\r\ntime until we witness greater ties being forged between\r\nseparatist leaders and terrorists.\r\nA vivid example of that is the conflict in\r\nAbkhazia, Georgia. That territory, which is under the\r\ncontrol of a separatist regime, has turned into a safe\r\nhaven for criminals, traffickers in drugs and human\r\nbeings, illegal arms dealers and terrorist groups. The\r\nnotorious Shamil Basayev, who was recently included\r\non the Counter-Terrorism Committee’s terrorist list, has\r\nre-established himself as a friend of the separatist\r\nauthorities and is maintaining active links with the\r\nterrorist groups in Abkhazia. In the near future, we will\r\nprovide the Counter-Terrorism Committee with\r\nrelevant information on individuals involved in\r\nterrorist activities in that region of Georgia.\r\nThe record of the United Nations in reaching a\r\ncomprehensive settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia,\r\nGeorgia, has been less than satisfactory. After more\r\nthan 10 years of United Nations involvement, we have\r\nnot come even a single step closer to a settlement.\r\nBlatant violations of human rights and ethnic cleansing\r\nof the Georgian population in Abkhazia continue\r\nunabated. Despite numerous calls, we have failed to\r\ncorrect even the fundamental flaws in the entire United\r\nNations-led peace process.\r\nWe welcome the fact that, since the last session of\r\nthe General Assembly, the Geneva process has gained a\r\nnew dimension. We are hopeful that that will give new\r\nimpetus to the peace process. I would like to stress that\r\nthis relatively new development is still fragile and that\r\nit should be aimed at achieving results, and not at the\r\nprocess itself. We would also like to underline the\r\nimportance of the recently held summit of the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which\r\nreinforced the previous decisions of CIS heads of\r\nStates putting forth restrictive regulations on political\r\nand economic cooperation and contact with Abkhazia,\r\nGeorgia.\r\nHowever, despite those positive steps, very little\r\nhas changed on the ground. In that regard, I am\r\nthinking in particular of the illegal unilateral actions\r\nundertaken by representatives of the Russian side, and\r\nespecially by leaders of regional authorities, that\r\nsignificantly damage the peace process. The railway\r\nlink between Sochi and Sukhumi is still operating\r\nunhindered. Despite our appeals at the last session of\r\nthe General Assembly, the wholesale granting of\r\nRussian citizenship to the Abkhaz population has never\r\nslowed. Russian passports issued to the inhabitants of\r\nthe secessionist region have already fallen into hands\r\nof terrorists, who are making the best use of free\r\npassage in and out of Russia through the Abkhaz and\r\nOssetian sections of the Georgian-Russian border,\r\nwhere our neighbour unilaterally imposes a visa-free\r\nregime.\r\nThe illegal acquisition of property — including\r\npossessions of internally displaced persons — in\r\nAbkhazia, Georgia, by State bodies, legal entities and\r\nindividuals continues. Needless to say, such acts are\r\nbeing carried out in flagrant violation of international\r\nlaw and represent an infringement of Georgia’s\r\nsovereignty. They run counter to the Georgian law that\r\ndeclares any transaction with the separatist regime null\r\nand void.\r\nThe illegal presence of the Russian military base\r\nin Gudauta is yet another element that is exacerbating\r\nthe situation in Abkhazia. Georgia insists that the\r\ncommitment undertaken in accordance with the Treaty\r\non Conventional Armed Forces in Europe concerning\r\nthe removal of that base be implemented expeditiously\r\nand transparently.\r\nBut there must still be hope — hope that we will\r\nnot again fail the 300,000 internally displaced persons\r\nand refugees, whose patience is running thin. Efforts\r\nmust be redoubled to persuade the Abkhaz side to\r\naccept the so-called Boden Document, on the\r\ndistribution of constitutional competences between\r\nTbilisi and Sokhumi, as a basis for political\r\nnegotiations.\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nWe have repeatedly noted the failure of the\r\npeacekeeping forces of the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States to provide security for returnees. In\r\nfact, those forces — which do not even have a United\r\nNations mandate — have done no more than sustain the\r\nstatus quo, virtually functioning as border guards\r\nbetween Abkhazia and the rest of Georgia. We cannot\r\nhope for any improvement in the situation unless the\r\nUnited Nations takes upon itself the launching, in an\r\ninternationalized format, of a full-scale peacekeeping\r\noperation in Abkhazia. It is through an increased role\r\non the part of the United Nations and through the will\r\nof the international community that the unheeding\r\nAbkhaz separatists can be forced to compromise.\r\nFailing that, the Government of Georgia will have no\r\nother choice but to request the Security Council to\r\nresort to the measures envisaged under Chapter VII of\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nThe Secretary-General and many other world\r\nleaders have duly recognized that the United Nations is\r\npassing though one of the most critical phases of its\r\nhistory. New global realities have made it clear that\r\nimmediate measures ought to be undertaken if we want\r\nto ensure the sustainability of the United Nations and\r\nto strengthen the confidence of Member States in the\r\nOrganization.\r\nIn his statement before the forty-seventh session\r\nof the General Assembly, in 1992, President\r\nShevardnadze of Georgia stated:\r\n“There is no need to fear reforms when\r\nreforms are so necessary, especially, in our view,\r\nin the two interrelated fields of peacekeeping and\r\nnation-building in the newly independent States.”\r\n(A/47/PV.12, p.36)\r\nThose sentiments have been duly echoed during the\r\ncurrent Assembly session. We should be courageous\r\nenough to recognize that reform of the United Nations\r\nis essential for the interests of each of us, as well as for\r\nour collective good.\r\nIt is our belief that Member States can rally\r\naround the Secretary-General in his call for the creation\r\nof a high-level panel of eminent personalities charged\r\nwith a multitude of tasks aimed at reforming the United\r\nNations. I reaffirm Georgia’s support for expansion of\r\nthe Security Council. We join the calls to grant\r\nGermany and Japan permanent seats on the Council\r\nand to increase the number of non-permanent members.\r\nMoreover, the decision-making process within the\r\nCouncil should be made more transparent and\r\ndemocratic to ensure that the adoption of necessary\r\nresolutions does not fall prey to special, narrow\r\ninterests.\r\nAs we continue to collectively witness changing\r\nglobal realities, the Government of Georgia welcomes\r\nthe increasing role of regional structures in achieving\r\nthe fundamental objectives set forth by the United\r\nNations. The efforts of European and Euro-Atlantic\r\nstructures in the Balkans is just one successful example\r\nin that regard. Another vivid example is Afghanistan,\r\nwhere NATO has taken a leading role in the peace-\r\nbuilding operation. That organization’s role will\r\nincrease further as a result of its recent expansion.\r\nSecurity issues have become a serious concern for such\r\nregional organizations as the Black Sea Economic\r\nCooperation Organization and the GUUAM\r\nParticipating States — Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan,\r\nAzerbaijan and Republic of Moldova. Here, we should\r\nlike to appeal to Member States for support for the\r\nGUUAM’s efforts to be granted observer status in the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe Millennium Summit and the decisions taken\r\nthere remain, in our view, one of the most significant\r\nachievements of the United Nations. The consensus\r\nachieved both at the Monterrey and the Johannesburg\r\nSummits are road maps for the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. The Government of\r\nGeorgia supports the objectives and strategies set forth\r\nin both outcome documents, considering it imperative\r\nthat the international community remain on course.\r\nGlobalization is becoming an everyday reality.\r\nAdvances in modern technologies are making that\r\nprocess irreversible. However, it is up to the United\r\nNations to take a more active role in guaranteeing\r\nequitable distribution of resources among all nations of\r\nthe world. It is through increased cooperation, through\r\nthe streamlining of actions within the United Nations\r\nand its bodies, and through the establishment of new\r\npartnerships that the Organization must prevail in\r\nachieving global sustainable development.\r\nDespite rapidly changing global realities, one\r\nthing remains constant: there is a greater need and a\r\ngreater demand for the United Nations. We remain\r\nhopeful that common sense and a common vision of the\r\nfuture will prevail in this unique international body.\r\nFor our part, we are prepared to do our utmost towards\r\nthat end.\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Kalombo Mwansa, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Zambia.\r\nMr. Mwansa (Zambia): Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at this session. My\r\ndelegation pledges its support and its cooperation to\r\nyou. I wish you a very successful tenure of office. I\r\nalso wish to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Jan\r\nKavan of the Czech Republic, for the efficient manner\r\nin which he presided over the proceedings of the\r\nprevious session. In addition, I wish to take this\r\nopportunity to commend the Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nKofi Annan, for his relentless efforts and dedication to\r\nthe cause of international peace, security and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMy delegation wishes to express our deepest\r\nsympathies to the families of the United Nations staff\r\nwho died in the terrorist bombing at the United Nations\r\noffices in Baghdad on 19 August 2003. Those tragic\r\ndeaths are an incalculable loss to the United Nations.\r\nSuch violent acts should not be allowed to continue.\r\nMy Government also joins other Members of the\r\nUnited Nations in condemning these inhuman acts.\r\nI should like to state that Zambia condemns, in all\r\nits forms and manifestations, the terrorism that is\r\noccurring in various parts of the world. We pledge to\r\ncooperate with the international community in the fight\r\nagainst international terrorism. It is in that vein that the\r\nZambian Government welcomes Security Council\r\nresolution 1502 (2003), on the protection of United\r\nNations personnel, associated personnel and\r\nhumanitarian personnel in conflict zones, which was\r\nadopted on 26 August 2003 and which, inter alia,\r\nexpresses strong condemnation of all forms of\r\nviolence.\r\nThe tragedy in Baghdad underscores the need for\r\nconcerted efforts to strengthen multilateral approaches\r\nto international peace and security. The United Nations\r\nshould be allowed to lead efforts to achieve\r\ncomprehensive disarmament in nuclear, chemical and\r\nconventional weapons. Terrorists should be denied\r\naccess to all weapons of mass destruction.\r\nNuclear, chemical and conventional weapons,\r\nincluding small arms and light weapons, pose a serious\r\nthreat to international peace and security. In Africa,\r\nsmall arms and light weapons, as well as anti-personnel\r\nlandmines, have destabilized States and have taken a\r\ngreat toll on life and property. My Government is\r\nhopeful that this session will advance the horizon of\r\nthe international disarmament agenda.\r\nZambia mourns the untimely death of Ms. Anna\r\nLindh, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden, who\r\ndedicated her life to the pursuit of peace, social\r\nprogress and development. My country will miss her\r\nfriendship, dynamism and broad understanding of\r\ndevelopmental issues.\r\nAs a peace-loving Member State, Zambia will\r\ncontinue to cooperate with and to support the efforts of\r\nthe Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), established\r\nby the Security Council to fight terrorism. The CTC\r\nshould be encouraged to work to raise the capacities of\r\nMember States to fight international terrorism.\r\nEmphasis should be placed on addressing linkages\r\nbetween terrorism, money-laundering and organized\r\ncrime, which are among the most serious challenges to\r\nstability and peace in our era.\r\nThe strength of the United Nations lies in its\r\nlegitimacy, founded on the bedrock of principles of\r\ninternational law accepted by all Member States. It is\r\nessential that the conduct of international affairs be in\r\nconformity with those principles. The common security\r\nagenda should reflect a global consensus on all major\r\nthreats to peace and security. The spirit of cooperation\r\nbased on the shared values of equality and sovereignty,\r\nwhich are enshrined in our Charter, is a source of our\r\nstrength.\r\nPoverty is the greatest impediment to\r\ndevelopment. Poverty reduction therefore remains the\r\nforemost priority of developing countries and should\r\ncontinue to feature highly on the agenda of the United\r\nNations. It is regrettable that, since the Millennium\r\nDeclaration three years ago, indications are that most\r\ndeveloping countries risk falling short of achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015. This is\r\nlargely due to lack of resources and capacity and\r\nweaknesses in national and global economies. Zambia\r\ncontinues to strive to implement those goals.\r\nGlobalization has brought about both\r\nopportunities and challenges. But the current world\r\neconomic conditions are unfavourable to developing\r\ncountries in general, and to the least developed\r\ncountries in particular. Unless there is an increase in\r\nthe flow of the official development assistance (ODA),\r\nforeign direct investment and other forms of assistance,\r\nit will be difficult for these countries to come out of the\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nvicious circle of poverty and lack of development. This\r\nsituation is exacerbated by the huge external debts that\r\nthe least developed countries are struggling to pay off.\r\nGiven their economic problems, the least\r\ndeveloped countries, of which 34 out of 49 are in\r\nAfrica, there is need for support from the international\r\ncommunity within the framework of the 2001 Brussels\r\nPlan of Action. In that vein, I wish also to urge\r\ndeveloped countries to honour their pledges to meet the\r\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product\r\noffered as ODA to developing countries.\r\nWhile we welcome the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries (HIPC) Initiative in addressing the external\r\ndebt, there is a need to broaden and ease the process of\r\naccessing funds. Equally important, developing\r\ncountries need easy access to the markets of the\r\ndeveloped countries. This is important to stimulate\r\neconomic growth. To level the playing field, my\r\ndelegation calls for the removal of agricultural\r\nsubsidies in developed countries, which have\r\ncontributed to the adverse and poor terms of trade for\r\nthe developing countries.\r\nZambia regrets the failure to achieve a consensus\r\nat the World Trade Organization Ministerial\r\nConference at Cancún. There is an urgent need to\r\novercome the impasse that emerged. Developed\r\ncountries should demonstrate a give-and-take spirit in\r\nthese negotiations.\r\nIn the effort to address social and economic\r\nproblems and promote development, the African heads\r\nof State and Government, at their summit held in\r\nLusaka, Zambia, in July 2001, adopted the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), to\r\nplace the continent on a path to sustainable growth.\r\nAlthough the ownership and the implementation\r\nof the NEPAD programme is the responsibility of the\r\nAfricans themselves, in order to succeed they need the\r\ncooperation and assistance of the international\r\ncommunity. My delegation would like to appeal to the\r\ndonor community, including United Nations agencies,\r\nto assist in the implementation of NEPAD.\r\nMy delegation is mindful that Africa’s\r\ndevelopment is hampered by conflicts. Wherever these\r\noccur, there is no development; rather, there is more\r\ndestruction and loss of life and property. Zambia\r\ncommends the leadership of Africa for taking up the\r\nchallenge to resolve conflicts in the African way. We\r\nthank them for their time and resources directed at that\r\neffort. We are happy to note the positive developments\r\nthat have taken place in the recent past in various parts\r\nof Africa where the peace processes have led to the\r\ncessation of conflict and the return of peace.\r\nIn that regard, my Government reaffirms its\r\nreadiness to contribute to the international conference\r\non the Great Lakes region initiated by the United\r\nNations in collaboration with the African Union.\r\nThe international community should make efforts\r\nfor conflict prevention and resolution. Conflicts should\r\nbe avoided by creating a conducive political\r\nenvironment and allow political pluralism, democracy,\r\ngood governance and transparency to flourish. My\r\ncountry’s commitment to the peaceful resolution of\r\nconflicts is unwavering, and we will continue to\r\nparticipate in peacekeeping operations.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic is indeed a global\r\ncrisis. It is no longer just a health concern, but an\r\nimpediment to human development and political\r\nstability, which threatens international peace and\r\nsecurity. The startling figures of 42 million people who\r\nlive with HIV/AIDS globally, the majority of whom are\r\nin sub-Saharan Africa, and the 31 million people who\r\nhave died from the pandemic, should compel the\r\ninternational community to take concrete measures to\r\ncombat the scourge.\r\nThe scourge has ravaged Zambia. My\r\nGovernment is devoting considerable attention and\r\nresources to combat its spread and to limit its impact\r\non our communities. We are also tackling the problems\r\ncreated by the pandemic such as the plight of AIDS\r\norphans, street kids and vulnerable households. In this\r\ntask, Government, civil societies, the relevant United\r\nNations agencies and the private sector are all working\r\ntogether. Zambia is also cooperating with other\r\nGovernments as well in tackling this pandemic.\r\nThe Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, which is a welcome\r\ninitiative, has provided renewed impetus to the\r\nprogrammes and interventions of Member States\r\ndesigned to combat these deadly diseases. There is a\r\nneed to contribute more generously to the Fund for it to\r\nbe solvent and viable. My delegation wishes to appeal\r\nfor easier access to these funds to enable affected\r\ncountries to procure cheaper and affordable generic\r\ndrugs that are urgently needed.\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nMy delegation calls for radical reform and\r\nstrengthening the world body to make it a more\r\nefficient and effective instrument to meet the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. Zambia supports\r\nthe Secretary-General’s proposals for reform of the\r\nUnited Nations aimed at the strengthening this world\r\nbody.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to state that my delegation\r\nrecognizes the numerous challenges that the United\r\nNations faces. I have every hope, that through our\r\ncollective effort, we will succeed in attaining peace,\r\ndevelopment and prosperity for all humanity. Zambia\r\npledges her support in these efforts.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Rodolphe Adada, Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nCooperation and Francophonie of the Republic of the\r\nCongo.\r\nMr. Adada (Congo) (spoke in French): Three\r\nyears ago, we held the Millennium Summit, during\r\nwhich we crafted a clear-cut common vision for the\r\ntwenty-first century, a road map to confront the\r\nchallenges of globalization: peace and security now\r\nfacing new threats, development and international\r\ncooperation, the environment, pandemics and so forth.\r\nOne year later the first challenge to this\r\nreassuring and ambitious edifice arose, the terrorist\r\nattacks of 11 September 2001. The international\r\ncommunity reacted unanimously and immediately\r\nadopted a collective response. A few months later we\r\nwitnessed the aggravation of tensions with the Iraq\r\ncrisis, which severely tested the principle of collective\r\nsecurity and moral authority of the United Nations, to\r\nthe point that we doubted the rationale for and the\r\nsurvival of what should be, after all, our common\r\nhome.\r\nFinally, and most recently, we have witnessed the\r\nfailure of the Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) in Cancún. This deadlock in\r\ndefining a negotiating process to revive the Doha round\r\nplaces in jeopardy the growth prospects of the world\r\neconomy which would otherwise benefit all people.\r\nThis can also be interpreted as a new opportunity to\r\nmarginalize the countries of the South.\r\nAll of this shows that this present session is being\r\nheld in a particularly worrisome context. These\r\ndevelopments are dangerous for the management of\r\ninternational affairs that should be marked with a spirit\r\nof dialogue, consultation and openness.\r\nWe must, therefore, return to the spirit of\r\nmultilateralism that characterized the Millennium\r\nSummit. We must reaffirm, loud and clear, the role of\r\nthe United Nations as a central axis of collective\r\nsecurity and inspiration for the rules of international\r\ncooperation aimed at justice and equality.\r\nFor this reason it is important to strengthen the\r\nrole of our Organization and improve its effectiveness.\r\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has now\r\npresented a very edifying report in this connection and\r\nwe very much encourage him to persevere along the\r\npath of reform and rationalization and to place the\r\nmultilateral system at the core of the management of\r\ncrises and the display of leadership in the world.\r\nYour election, Sir, to the presidency of this\r\nsession of the General Assembly is, for us, a\r\ntremendous asset. It symbolizes the sovereign equality\r\nof all States, large and small, and is a way of paying\r\ntribute to your great qualities and your diplomatic\r\nexperience. We are convinced that you will know how\r\nto skilfully guide our debate on multilateralism to a\r\nsatisfying outcome, very much in keeping with the high\r\nexpectations of the community of nations.\r\nThis year, once again we see the challenges to\r\npeace and international security at the very core of our\r\nmajor preoccupations. Everyone remembers the attack\r\nof 19 August 2003 against the United Nations offices\r\nin Baghdad. The death of the Special Representative of\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, and\r\nseveral dedicated servants of the United Nations, is still\r\nalive in our memories.\r\nIn paying tribute to their courage and dedication,\r\nwe must do everything within our power to ensure that\r\ntheir sacrifice was not made in vain and that the cause\r\nthey served so heroically does indeed triumph in the\r\ninterests of the Iraqi people and the noble ideas of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe must therefore encourage the Security\r\nCouncil to return to its essential unity so that the\r\ninternational community, led by the moral authority of\r\nthe United Nations, can help the Iraqi people to find\r\npeace, security and stability and reconstruct their\r\ncountry devastated by war and many years of embargo.\r\nNot far from Iraq, the international community is\r\nstill confronted with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nThis shows that the infernal cycle of violence can only\r\nlead to a dead end. The two parties must come to their\r\nsenses and return to the vision set out in the road map,\r\nwhich provides for the creation of a Palestinian State\r\nthat is independent, democratic and viable, living side\r\nby side with Israel and its other neighbours in an\r\natmosphere of peace and security.\r\nThe Security Council approved this vision in\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1397 (2002) and the two\r\nparties committed themselves to respecting the road\r\nmap on 4 June 2003 at the outcome of the Aqaba\r\nSummit. We must now bring them back to the\r\nnegotiating table, with no pre-conditions, and demand\r\nthat they refrain from any measure or unilateral action\r\nthat is incompatible with the goals of the road map.\r\nStill on the subject of peace and security, it seems\r\nto be necessary and essential to emphasize that we\r\nmust refrain from conflating terrorism, religion or\r\ncivilization as belonging to any geographical area or\r\nsupporting any national liberation struggle.\r\nJust as we must be firm, demanding and united\r\nwhen confronting acts of unjustifiable blind violence,\r\nwe must also be vigilant so as not to be tempted by\r\nconvenience.\r\nIn our relentless struggle against terrorism, it is\r\nimportant to give appropriate responses when it comes\r\nto the sovereignty of peoples, respect for human rights,\r\nsocial justice and combating poverty. We must also\r\nseriously analyse the causes that serve as the breeding\r\nground or pretext for terrorism. This is also part of\r\nconflict prevention and, to some extent, the prevention\r\nof terrorism.\r\nThis year we are celebrating the twenty-fifth\r\nanniversary of the first special session of the General\r\nAssembly on disarmament. It is regrettable to note that,\r\nsince the end of the cold war, so little progress has\r\nbeen accomplished and today’s deadlock in the\r\nConference on Disarmament is a tragic display of our\r\nfailure.\r\nAt a time when the international community is\r\nlegitimately concerned about weapons of mass\r\ndestruction that might fall into the hands of terrorists, it\r\nis important to remind all of the actors that they must\r\nabide by the multilateral agreements and scrupulously\r\nrespect them.\r\nWithin the context of disarmament activities, we\r\nwelcome the holding, last July in New York, of the first\r\nBiennial Meeting of States to Consider the\r\nImplementation of the 2001 Programme of Action on\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. My\r\ncountry hosted in Brazzaville, from 12 to 14 May 2003,\r\na sub-regional seminar on the implementation in\r\nCentral Africa of the United Nations Programme of\r\nAction to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit\r\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its\r\nAspects and presented at that time a report reflecting\r\nAfrica’s firm determination to eradicate this scourge.\r\nAs part of its implementation of the Ottawa\r\nConvention on anti-personnel landmines, from 9 to 10\r\nSeptember 2003, Congo destroyed its stock of\r\nlandmines. During two public operations carried out\r\nwith the support of Canada and the United Nations, our\r\nGovernment destroyed 5,220 landmines. We intend to\r\ncontinue with an operation to search out landmines in\r\nthe southern part of our country that borders on Angola\r\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nThis is to illustrate the degree of cooperation that\r\nprevails among the countries of Central Africa when it\r\ncomes to questions of peace and security.\r\nAfrica is seen today as the focal point for the\r\nchallenges confronting humanity, in particular as\r\nregards armed conflict, underdevelopment and the\r\nproliferation of pandemics. But this is not all that\r\nAfrica has to offer the rest of the world. Various\r\ncourageous initiatives now show Africa’s\r\ndetermination to take its fate into its own hands: the\r\nadoption of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), the African Peer Review\r\nMechanism and the Council for Peace and Security.\r\nThe African Union Summit that was just held in\r\nMaputo, Mozambique, eloquently displays this attitude\r\nof ours. My delegation associates itself with the\r\nstatement made on 24 September by His Excellency\r\nMr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President of the\r\nRepublic of Mozambique, on behalf of the African\r\nUnion. The Acting President clearly informed the\r\ninternational community about the resolve of the\r\nAfrican continent to overcome current obstacles to\r\nbuilding a new Africa in the areas of peace, security,\r\ndemocracy, human rights, economic development and\r\nregional integration.\r\nIt is precisely in this sprit that His Excellency\r\nMr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of the Republic\r\nof Congo, put forward his thoughts in a statement\r\nentitled, “For a Pan-African Pact against Aggression”\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nat the summit in Maputo, which constitutes a\r\ncontribution to preventive diplomacy that will help to\r\nspare the African peoples the horrors of fratricidal\r\nstrife and enable them to devote themselves exclusively\r\nand usefully to development objectives and a code of\r\nconduct between African States, lending timely support\r\nto the framework outlined by the Peace and Security\r\nCouncil of the African Union. My country, which is the\r\ncurrent acting President of the Economic Community\r\nof Central African States (ECCAS) and the Central\r\nAfrican Economic and Monetary Community\r\n(CAEMC), takes such concerns to heart as it discharges\r\nits mandates in the management of various crises that\r\nare shaking our subregion.\r\nWe have already had the opportunity to deplore\r\nthe fact that Central Africa suffers from the paradox of\r\nbeing both one of the richest subregions on the\r\ncontinent and one of the weakest zones in terms of\r\nhuman development indices. All the current initiatives\r\nof the leaders of the subregion are geared towards the\r\nresolution of this paradox. Thus, during the past year,\r\nsignificant progress had been registered in the various\r\ncountries that have experienced, or are experiencing,\r\narmed crises — Angola, Rwanda, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Congo, the Central African\r\nRepublic, Burundi and Chad. In the quest to resolve\r\nthese crises, we have counted on the cooperation of\r\ndiverse partners, especially the United Nations and\r\nAfrican Union.\r\nAllow me to briefly touch on some of the\r\nsituations that require particular attention from the\r\ninternational community. With respect to Angola, while\r\nwe welcome the return of peace in that country,\r\nravaged for nearly three decades by civil war, we wish\r\nto urge the international community to help the\r\nAngolan authorities in their efforts at reconstruction.\r\nWe continue to support the intention of the Angolan\r\nGovernment to submit for consideration at the present\r\nsession a draft resolution on international assistance for\r\nthe reconstruction and economic development of\r\nAngola.\r\nWe also welcome the positive developments\r\nunder way in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\ndistinguished in particular by the establishment of\r\ntransitional institutions and the deployment of the\r\nUnited Nations Organization Mission in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo in Ituri. We urge the\r\ninternational community to continue its support for the\r\npacification and reunification process under way in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and to further\r\ncontribute substantively to the reconstruction\r\nprogrammes in place. I would like to reaffirm our\r\nsteadfast wish to see this neighbouring and brotherly\r\ncountry find peace again, a guarantee for stability of\r\nthe subregion.\r\nI am also duty-bound to draw the attention of the\r\ninternational community to the situation in the Central\r\nAfrican Republic, which has been confronted for years\r\nwith serious and persistent economic, social and\r\nsecurity problems. I would like to recall here that\r\nalarmed by this ever-worsening situation, CAEMC has\r\nestablished an ad hoc committee on the Central African\r\nRepublic, presided over by His Excellency El Hadj\r\nOmar Bongo, President of the Gabonese Republic. It\r\nhas also deployed a peacekeeping force in that country.\r\nCAEMC’s involvement in the Central African\r\nRepublic, which has received much encouragement,\r\nparticularly from the Security Council, mainly aims at\r\nthe reconciliation of the Central African people, the\r\npacification of the country and the prompt restoration\r\nof constitutional order. The holding of a Central\r\nAfrican dialogue fits precisely in the framework of the\r\nrecommended measures.\r\nThis country, which has suffered greatly these\r\npast years, truly needs assistance from the international\r\ncommunity to regain peace, stability, economic growth\r\nand democracy. That is the meaning of the appeal made\r\nat Brazzaville on 17 May 2003 by the ECCAS\r\nMinisters at the meeting of the United Nations\r\nStanding Advisory Committee on Security Questions in\r\nCentral Africa.\r\nStill with respect to our subregion, I would like\r\nfinally to stress in particular the crisis that raged in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of Sâo Tomé and Príncipe in July\r\n2003. At that time, ECCAS, the African Union, the\r\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries and\r\nNigeria worked in perfect concert to re-establish the\r\nconstitutional order shattered in this country on 16 July\r\n2003. While we commend the contribution made by the\r\nUnited States and South Africa, we would like to\r\nappeal again for the entire international community to\r\ngive substantial assistance to the Democratic Republic\r\nof Sâo Tomé and Príncipe, particularly to the\r\nemergency programme that has just been established by\r\nthe Government of this country.\r\nWe must also follow with great interest\r\ndevelopments in Burundi, where every step forward\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nmust be supported and encouraged to make the process\r\nirreversible. To that end, the international community\r\nis urgently called upon to make good on the financial\r\ncommitments made during the conferences in Paris and\r\nGeneva.\r\nThe situations that I have just mentioned lead us\r\nto the relevant conclusions of the open Security\r\nCouncil meeting on 22 October 2002 on strengthening\r\ncooperation between the United Nations system and the\r\nCentral African region in the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity. At that meeting, we expressed our\r\nappreciation for the cooperation between our region\r\nand the United Nations while welcoming, inter alia, the\r\nwork of the Standing Advisory Committee on Security\r\nQuestions in Central Africa. We welcomed the multi-\r\ncountry programme of demobilization and reintegration\r\nput forward by the World Bank.\r\nSince then, we welcomed the visit of the Security\r\nCouncil in June 2003 to the Great Lakes region and the\r\nmultidisciplinary mission of the United Nations\r\nsystem, and we are eagerly awaiting its conclusions.\r\nThese conclusions will allow us to meaningfully\r\nparticipate in the future public debates of the Security\r\nCouncil on our subregion, one year after the meeting\r\nthat elaborated a comprehensive, integrated,\r\ndetermined and concerted approach to the problems of\r\npeace, security and development of Central Africa.\r\nEnergized by that approach, we intend to\r\nparticipate in the international conference on peace,\r\nsecurity, democracy and development in the Great\r\nLakes region. We intend to seize this historic\r\nopportunity to exorcise the demons of hatred and\r\nviolence and lay the foundation for peaceful\r\ncoexistence among our peoples and nations, which\r\nshare a common destiny.\r\nWhile reaffirming the central role that the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo has to play in that\r\nconference, I would like to stress that the Republic of\r\nCongo, my country, which is close to the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo in so many ways, would not\r\nunderstand if it had to attend as an observer at this\r\ncrucial event. The same goes, by all accounts, for other\r\nneighbouring countries of the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, such as Angola and the Central African\r\nRepublic.\r\nThe issues of peace, security and building\r\nnational unity were at the core of the Congolese\r\nauthorities’ concerns during the past year. It is in this\r\nframework that the 17 March 2003 agreement must be\r\nplaced, thanks to which peace continues to reign\r\nthroughout the entire territory.\r\nHaving regained peace, we are seeking to build\r\non it each day, particularly by implementing the\r\nprogramme of disarmament, demobilization and\r\nreintegration of ex-combatants. We are also working\r\ntowards the resettlement of internally displaced\r\npersons. It is not hard to fathom that these missions\r\nrequire considerable funding, which the Congo cannot\r\nprovide alone. We would like to thank all our partners\r\nfor their active solidarity.\r\nWe must still meet the great challenges of\r\nreconstruction, economy recovery, poverty reduction\r\nand the fight against HIV/AIDS, all sectors for which\r\nnational strategies have been adopted. To implement\r\nthis vast project, which we have called “The New\r\nHope”, we are mobilizing all the national forces\r\ncapable of providing assistance to the State, including\r\nlocal government authorities, non-governmental\r\norganizations, civil society and the private sector. In\r\nthat framework, we have conducted negotiations with\r\nour external partners with a view to benefiting from the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative.\r\nAll of these achievements can be implemented\r\nonly in a world free from fear, as envisaged by the\r\nfounders of our Organization, and as we believe today.\r\nThis is why we wish to reiterate our faith and\r\nattachment to the United Nations, an irreplaceable\r\nframework and beacon of all hopes for peace for\r\nhumanity, and which has never seemed more clearly\r\nnecessary than today.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nHonourable Keliopate Tavola, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and External Trade of the Republic of the Fiji\r\nIslands.\r\nMr. Tavola (Fiji): Mr. President, my Government\r\nand country warmly congratulate you on your\r\nassumption of the Presidency of this fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly. In\r\npresiding over the Assembly, Saint Lucia is setting an\r\nhistoric precedent for small island developing States,\r\nwith the able support of its Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) neighbours.\r\nFiji fully supports your chairmanship. We also\r\nrecognize the successful leadership of your\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\npredecessor, President Jan Kavan of the Czech\r\nRepublic.\r\nI wish to express my Government’s deep\r\ncondolences to the family of Mr. Vieira de Mello and\r\nof all the victims of the bombing at the United Nations\r\nin Baghdad last month. This was a brutal crime, which\r\nrobbed the world of one of its most accomplished\r\nmediators and peacemakers. We hope that at this\r\nsession, we can all come together, united, in our\r\ncollective determination to rid the world of terrorism.\r\nI come from a part of the globe that is isolated in\r\nthe vast South Pacific. But that remoteness does not\r\nseparate us from the international perils of the bomb,\r\nthe gun and the hijacker. It does not insulate us against\r\nthose bent on causing death and destruction to defend\r\ntheir interests or advance a cause. The fact is that every\r\ncountry and region is a potential target.\r\nMembers of the Pacific Islands Forum are joined\r\nwith the United Nations in the search for a new order\r\nof peace and stability. That might seem an impossible\r\ntask set against the tensions, the hatreds, the bloodshed\r\nand violence of the times. But, if we abandon it, we sell\r\nout the principles of the United Nations. We betray our\r\ncountries, our peoples and generations to come.\r\nAre we so inadequate and lacking in our\r\nunderstanding and abilities that we are incapable of\r\ncoming up with new solutions to stop the spread of\r\nterror? It is not enough to simply strike out at the\r\nperpetrators. We must spend more effort and resources\r\nfinding out what turns people towards violence to\r\nachieve a goal. We must tell ourselves that there is a\r\ndifferent way, that the growing culture of violence and\r\nkilling is not destined to be a permanent part of our\r\nworld.\r\nThe United Nations needs to go to the root causes\r\nof this terrible phenomenon, which casts a very dark\r\nand menacing shadow over the first years of the\r\ntwenty-first century. In the Pacific, we are\r\nconcentrating on security issues, strengthening law and\r\norder and maintaining stability. A number of initiatives\r\nwere taken during the last 12 months when our Prime\r\nMinister served as Forum chair.\r\nForemost among these initiatives was the ground-\r\nbreaking decision to send a peace mission to the\r\nSolomon Islands in response to a plea for assistance\r\nfrom that country. The Solomon Islands had been\r\nwracked for several years by civil unrest, lawlessness\r\nand ethnic conflict. We in Fiji had a sympathetic\r\nappreciation of the difficulties facing those islands\r\nbecause of our own crisis in 2000. We were more than\r\nhappy, therefore, to contribute to a task force to the\r\nSolomon Islands charged with bringing back order and\r\nre-establishing peace. A contingent of our troops,\r\ncombined with others from Australia, Papua New\r\nGuinea, Tonga and New Zealand, is now in the\r\nSolomon Islands working with the people there. We are\r\nencouraged by what our own soldiers and their\r\ncomrades have been able to do so far to support a\r\nneighbour in distress. Our task is given extra\r\nsignificance through the close ties we enjoy with the\r\nSolomon Islands.\r\nThe Solomon Islands mission has inevitably\r\ngenerated some controversy and debate about\r\nAustralia’s expanding involvement in our region. But\r\nlet the record reflect that we endorse Australia’s\r\nleading role in this intervention on the invitation of the\r\nSolomon Islands Government. One of its notable\r\naspects is that it is multilateral. It was accomplished\r\nthrough the Pacific Islands Forum and has the\r\nunanimous support of the members. Beyond this, we\r\nknow that the support and encouragement of the\r\ninternational community and the United Nations\r\nsystem will remain important, as work to build a\r\ncredible law and justice system, an effective\r\nadministration and a viable economic base continues.\r\nRecent happenings have brought into question the\r\nvalue, the relevance and the future of multilateralism.\r\nOur position is that we understood the concerns, which\r\nled the United States to act in the way it did over Iraq.\r\nThe date of 11 September 2001 was a shattering ordeal.\r\nIt changed history and it changed America.\r\nThat said, Fiji declares an unwavering\r\ncommitment to the concept of the world community\r\nworking together, seeking the common path forward.\r\nWe stand by the ideals of a multilateral, cooperative\r\napproach among nations. We welcome the decision by\r\nthe United States to now seek United Nations\r\ninvolvement in Iraq’s reconstruction.\r\nIn the Pacific, the Nasonini Declaration on\r\nregional security, adopted last year in Fiji, is a\r\nkeystone of joint strategy. It followed the earlier\r\nHoniara Declaration on Law Enforcement Cooperation,\r\naimed at countering transnational and organized crime.\r\nThe Forum countries will give higher priority to\r\nimplementing legislative provisions to improve our\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\ncapacity for dealing with law enforcement and security\r\nchallenges. Underpinning this is an Australian\r\ncommitment, also approved by the Forum, to spend\r\napproximately $15 million over three years, to\r\nstrengthen regional police forces. New Zealand has,\r\nadditionally, agreed to put in $2 million. This important\r\nproject is to be based in Fiji. A regional academy will\r\nprovide training for about 900 police officers annually\r\nfrom Forum countries.\r\nFiji has been taking part in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations since 1978. This has come at\r\na price. But, to us, serving world peace with our\r\nsoldiers demonstrates that even the smallest States can\r\nplay their part in minimizing and preventing conflicts.\r\nCurrently, 635 Fiji personnel are on active duty in\r\nUnited Nations missions, apart from 123 soldiers and\r\n15 police in the Solomon Islands. Our commitment to\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping has not changed. It is a\r\nvital part of our foreign policy.\r\nFiji stresses the importance of strengthening\r\nmultilateral treaties and conventions on disarmament\r\nand non-proliferation. Our country is one of those that\r\nwant to see an effective global strategy for the control\r\nof small arms and light weapons.\r\nDuring our Prime Minister’s chairmanship of the\r\nPacific Islands Forum, there was a deepening of the\r\nSouth Pacific region’s engagement with development\r\npartners and international organizations. Heads of\r\nGovernment from member States enhanced their ties\r\nwith France and Japan. They met in Tahiti with\r\nPresident Chirac and discussed many topics of common\r\nconcern.\r\nAt a summit with Prime Minister Koizumi in\r\nOkinawa, they were able to reach and agreement on the\r\noutcome of the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, the Millennium Development Goals and\r\nour own regional priorities, as a further basis for future\r\ncollaboration.\r\nThe Pacific Islands Forum now has 12 dialogue\r\npartners, including the United States, Canada, France,\r\nthe United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan,\r\nChina, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, India and\r\nTaiwan.\r\nChina — the emerging giant in world affairs and\r\ntrade — has a steadily growing presence in our region.\r\nIts involvement and support for our economic and\r\nsocial development is welcome. We see definite scope\r\nfor trade, investment, cultural and tourism links. China,\r\nmany commentators believe, already has the world’s\r\nsecond largest economy. Its present aid programme is\r\nsignificant and we expect it to grow substantially as\r\nbilateral relationships grow stronger.\r\nAt the same time, we place great value on our\r\ntrade and commerce with Taiwan and value its\r\nassistance to our development. We look forward to the\r\nday when China and Taiwan peacefully resolve their\r\nlong-standing differences.\r\nWe also welcome Japan’s role and presence in the\r\nPacific Islands region. Japan is an economic\r\npowerhouse and its increased role and contribution in\r\npromoting international security and development\r\nshould be recognized by all Member States in allowing\r\nJapan a special place in the United Nations Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nI am pleased to report that in Fiji and the region,\r\nthere is more coordination in the effort to curb\r\nHIV/AIDS, the most terrible disease of our era.\r\nAlthough we have so far escaped the worst effects of\r\nHIV/AIDS, it is a real danger in the islands.\r\nWe expect to make substantial progress in our\r\nfight against this affliction, with support from Japan\r\nand France and an allocation from the Global Fund to\r\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. A programme\r\nfinanced by Australia provides $12.5 million for the\r\nregional campaign. Our Government will also make a\r\nlarger HIV/AIDS allocation in next year’s budget.\r\nHIV/AIDS screening was recently at the centre of\r\ndiscussion in Fiji, when a suggestion was made for\r\nobligatory testing. Such a move was regarded by our\r\nHuman Rights Commission as a rights violation. We\r\nmust weigh the Commission’s views carefully against\r\nthe competing call for radical response to a national\r\nthreat.\r\nThe Fiji Human Rights Commission is a product\r\nof our Constitution and its comprehensive bill of rights.\r\nThe Commission is implementing a public education\r\ncampaign to overcome a lack of awareness on rights\r\nissues. It also monitors Government and statutory\r\nauthorities so that laws and policies conform to\r\ninternational human rights principles and the\r\nrequirements of the Constitution. These generally\r\nreflect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\r\nadopted by this Assembly in 1948.\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nAs a former colony, Fiji is a late-starter in\r\npromoting human rights and civil liberties. Our\r\nGovernment’s strategic plan to 2005 expresses very\r\nclearly where we stand. The plan was endorsed by a\r\nnational economic summit and by Parliament. Please\r\nallow me to quote briefly from the plan:\r\n“The guarantee of fundamental rights and\r\nfreedoms for every citizen of Fiji and their equal\r\nprotection under the law ... is an essential part of\r\nour vision for a peaceful Fiji. A feeling of\r\npersonal security and of group security comes\r\nabout when people have confidence that breaches\r\nof rights and freedoms will be dealt with\r\nimpartially and speedily”.\r\nI quote further:\r\n“... Respect for the rights of others is a\r\ncritical component of our freedoms guaranteed\r\nunder the constitution. It is essential for peaceful\r\nexistence in our multi-cultural society”.\r\nI emphasize these points because sometimes there\r\nare attempts to depict Fiji as a land where rights are\r\nhabitually abused. Propaganda against our country has\r\nbeen circulated in some quarters here at the United\r\nNations.\r\nMuch of this stems from opposition to our\r\naffirmative action policies designed to end social and\r\neconomic inequalities. These are based on principles\r\nwell-established internationally and are provided for in\r\nour Constitution.\r\nIt is self-evident that a country cannot grow in\r\njustice, harmony and prosperity when more than half of\r\nits population — in this case the indigenous Fijians —\r\nare largely outside the economy looking in.\r\nAll right-thinking people will agree that it is just\r\nand fair that this should be changed. But we constantly\r\nstress that this is not about taking from one group to\r\ngive to another. It is about making the economy grow\r\nso that there is enough wealth to be shared equitably\r\namong our population. We want to give the Fijians a\r\nchance to catch up and compete in business and\r\ncommerce.\r\nLet it be noted that we have brought in laws to\r\nhelp the disadvantaged of all communities. This is a\r\nconstitutional obligation. No one is being left out. That\r\nis the commitment we have made to our own\r\npopulation, and we now make to the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nDisparities and inequalities go to the very heart of\r\nthe dispute which brought about the collapse of the\r\nCancún talks. The failure of the talks underscores the\r\ndeep differences which separate the poor countries\r\nfrom the rich in the battle to reform international trade.\r\nWe acknowledge the ideal of free trade, but the stark\r\nreality is that there are many dangerous pitfalls for\r\nnations whose economies are weak and vulnerable.\r\nIt will be a long time before most developing\r\nStates are ready to compete on that so-called level\r\nplaying field. To them it is not level at all. Bring the\r\nbarriers down completely and the full might of first-\r\nworld commercial power will descend. What will that\r\ndo to home-grown and emerging industries in poorer\r\ncountries?\r\nFor the time being, countries like ours need\r\npreferences and special access for our economic\r\nsurvival. Think of it as a form of affirmative action to\r\nreduce that yawning chasm between the rich North and\r\nthe poverty-stricken South. We now need to urgently\r\nconsider where the World Trade Organization goes\r\nfrom here, and what can be done to salvage the\r\nwreckage of Cancún.\r\nAbout three and-a-half years ago, my country\r\ncame very close to anarchy. We had an armed\r\ninsurrection, hostage-taking and violence. The\r\nGovernment of the day was overthrown. It was a time\r\nof extreme crisis for Fiji.\r\nNow, I can stand before this Assembly to tell you\r\nthat our nation is being reborn. Order and stability were\r\nrestored and the first steps taken on a continuing\r\njourney of reconciliation. We had peaceful, democratic\r\nelections. Our Government is on a mission to build a\r\nFiji where peace, multi-racial harmony and prosperity\r\nwill always reign.\r\nOur economic policy is to create more\r\nemployment and wealth through high growth. We have\r\nincreased Government investment in infrastructure and\r\nmade a concerted and, to this point, successful effort to\r\nattract greater volumes of private capital. Many of the\r\nindicators are positive — apart from those relating to\r\nour sugar industry. This year, we expect to achieve an\r\noverall growth rate of more than five per cent.\r\nThis remarkable recovery could not have been\r\nachieved without the encouragement and support of\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nmany friends of Fiji in the international community,\r\nand especially here at the United Nations.\r\nI pay tribute to the role of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the World Health\r\nOrganization, the Food and Agriculture Organization,\r\nthe United Nations Population Fund, the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund, the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and\r\nthe International Labour Organization. The ILO is\r\nmaking a particularly valuable contribution at the\r\nmoment with a plan to accelerate job creation.\r\nTo conclude, the “special case” of the small\r\nisland developing States is calling for a “special\r\nresponse” of the global community, in further\r\nadvancing our sustainable development efforts. The\r\nten-year comprehensive review of the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action in Mauritius next year will\r\nprovide the avenue for our development partners to\r\nmake further commitments to our cause. Fiji is urging\r\nthe international community to contribute to the\r\nsuccess of this meeting.\r\nMr. President and fellow delegates, the United\r\nNations is currently experiencing considerable strain\r\nand division, but it is for all of us to ensure that this\r\nOrganization comes through the period of difficulty,\r\nstrengthened and regenerated. The world needs the\r\nUnited Nations and what it stands for.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ahmed Abdi Hashi, chairman of\r\nthe delegation of the Somali Republic.\r\nMr. Hashi (Somalia): Allow me first of all to\r\nsincerely congratulate Mr. Julian Hunte on his election\r\nas President of the fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly. Your election to the presidency is a\r\nreflection of the high esteem the international\r\ncommunity reserves for your country, Saint Lucia, and\r\nyour good person.\r\nAt the same time, I would like to express our\r\nappreciation for the excellent manner in which your\r\npredecessor conducted the work of the fifty-seventh\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nI would be remiss if I did not pay tribute to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Anan for his strong\r\ncommitment to the principles enshrined in the United\r\nNations Charter and for defending so courageously the\r\nideals on which this Organization is based.\r\nThe destruction of the United Nations\r\nheadquarters in Baghdad, with its unnecessary loss of\r\nlife, was a heinous crime against humanity and the\r\nUnited Nations. Sergio Vieira de Mello and his United\r\nNations co-workers were in Iraq not as an occupying\r\nPower, but to serve and address the humanitarian needs\r\nof the Iraqi people. This despicable act is tantamount to\r\ncutting off the hand that feeds. We offer our sincere\r\nand profound condolences to Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnan, the United Nations family and the bereaved\r\nfamilies. In memory of the fallen, it is imperative for\r\nus, Member States, to accelerate ratification of the\r\nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and\r\nAssociated Personnel.\r\nThe recent high-level meeting at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters on the HIV/AIDS pandemic was of\r\ntremendous interest to the world and particularly to\r\nmany countries in Africa. The AIDS scourge, having\r\ndevastated entire communities, has also negatively\r\nimpacted the economic development of countries. In\r\norder to combat this scourge, it is incumbent upon the\r\ninternational community to make more resources\r\navailable, even in those countries where the incidence\r\nof the pandemic is reportedly low.\r\nMy country, Somalia, is reported to be one of\r\nthose countries in Africa with a very low rate of\r\ninfection. However, this should not lead us into\r\ncomplacency. Countries like Somalia have a unique\r\nchance to prevent the disease from spreading. An AIDS\r\nepidemic would be catastrophic for Somalia and\r\nseriously hamper efforts for peace and nation-building.\r\nIt is therefore critical to put into place coordinated and\r\nstrategic AIDS education and early response\r\nprogrammes to prevent the spread of the epidemic in\r\nSomalia. As the saying goes, prevention is better than\r\ncure.\r\nRecent developments in the international arena\r\npresent the United Nations with unprecedented\r\nchallenges. Whether we succeed or fail will depend\r\nprimarily on the manner in which we address these\r\nchallenges. In our view, that should be through the\r\nUnited Nations. We have to reinforce the principles of\r\nthe United Nations Charter through which we can\r\nfurther cement the pillars of international legitimacy on\r\nthe basis of the equality of nations big and small, rich\r\nand poor; respect for the sovereignty of peoples; non-\r\ninterference in each others’ internal affairs;\r\nrenunciation of the use of force in resolving conflicts;\r\nand respect for human rights.\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nThere are Members of this Organization who\r\nviolate these lofty principles with impunity. Israel is an\r\nexample in this regard. Israel’s continued occupation of\r\nArab lands seized by war; its denying the Palestinian\r\npeople their dignity; the daily killings of Palestinian\r\nchildren; the siege of the legitimate leader of the\r\nPalestinian people and calls by Israeli officials for his\r\nkilling; and the suffering and daily humiliations\r\ninflicted on the Palestinian people are of great concern\r\nto the international community. We believe that these\r\ngross violations of international law are not in the\r\ninterest of Israel or peace in the Middle East. We\r\nbelieve that the Arab initiative, which has the support\r\nof Arab States, provides a unique opportunity for\r\nachieving a just and comprehensive peace in the\r\nMiddle East and specifically between Arabs and\r\nIsraelis.\r\nThe situation in Iraq continues to be of great\r\nconcern. The people of Iraq need peace and\r\ndevelopment. The people of Iraq need to recuperate\r\nfrom the trauma of war and its aftermath. As a country\r\nthat has witnessed war and its destruction, we know\r\nwhat the Iraqi people are going through. We empathize\r\nwith them strongly. There must be a commitment from\r\nthe international community to respecting the unity,\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. The\r\nwithdrawal of the occupying forces from Iraq as soon\r\nas possible and the establishment of a truly\r\nrepresentative Government for Iraq based on a\r\nconstitution acceptable to all Iraqis continue to be\r\nimperatives. In this regard, the United Nations can and\r\nmust play the central role in bringing peace to Iraq.\r\nA fresh wind is blowing throughout Africa, from\r\nthe West of the continent to its Eastern and Central\r\nregions. This fresh wind is one of hope and peace not\r\nonly for Africa, but also for the world. This wind of\r\nhope and peace needs to be nurtured and sustained by\r\nthe international community.\r\nWe welcome the progress made in the search for\r\npeace in African countries — the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, Burundi, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Liberia,\r\nthe Côte d’Ivoire and Guinea-Bissau. The latest and\r\nmost welcome progress towards peace is the 22\r\nSeptember 2003 agreement signed in Naivasha, Kenya,\r\nby the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People’s\r\nLiberation Movement/Sudan People’s Liberation Army.\r\nWe encourage the parties to resolve the remaining\r\noutstanding issues in a spirit of accommodation and\r\nmutual understanding. We also commend the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD),\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States, the\r\nAfrican Union, the United Nations and individual\r\ncountries for their valuable assistance in bringing peace\r\nto areas of conflict in Africa.\r\nI pause to share with the General Assembly the\r\nsituation in my country, Somalia. We express our deep\r\ngratitude to the Government and people of Kenya for\r\nhosting us and for their perseverance. We strongly\r\ncommend Kenya for its active role in promoting peace\r\nin Somalia. I also take this opportunity to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his valuable support for the\r\npeace process in Somalia. The IGAD Partners Forum,\r\nthe African Union, the League of Arab States, the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and IGAD are\r\nto be commended for their firm commitment and input\r\ninto this process.\r\nThe Somali National Reconciliation Conference\r\nat Mbagathi enters its twelfth month. A lot of ground\r\nhas been covered during this period. A declaration on\r\nthe cessation of hostilities has been adopted and the\r\nAfrican Union has put in place a monitoring\r\nmechanism. Today, African Union monitors crisscross\r\nnearly all areas of Somalia to ensure the\r\nimplementation of the declaration on the cessation of\r\nhostilities.\r\nEqually important is the completion of the first\r\ntwo phases of the Conference. Despite such progress,\r\nwe have been struggling with the last and crucial phase\r\nof the Conference for the past four months. This last\r\nphase envisaged the adoption of an interim charter, to\r\nbe followed by the election of an interim head of State\r\nand the formation of an all-inclusive Government of\r\nSomalia. However, disagreements regarding the\r\ncontent of the interim charter and other important\r\nmatters continue to persist. The provisions of the\r\ninterim charter that raise the concerns of many touch\r\nupon the shape and very foundations of the\r\nreconstituted State of Somalia. It is for that reason that\r\nthe Conference is currently in suspense and stalled,\r\nwith the Transitional National Government and at least\r\nseven other groups refraining from participation.\r\nAny interim charter for Somalia, in our view,\r\nmust meet certain, basic criteria. First, it must have\r\nSomali ownership. Secondly, it must be the result of a\r\nfair and transparent process. Thirdly, it must have the\r\nsupport of the Somali stakeholders. Fourthly, it must be\r\nenforceable on the ground. Fifthly, it must reflect the\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nunity and indivisibility of the Somali nation. Finally,\r\nany Government that is established under this interim\r\nCharter should be an all-inclusive one. By the same\r\ntoken, any agreements reached in Kenya must be on a\r\nconsensus basis, have the support of the Somalis as\r\nwell as of the international community, and be\r\nenforceable on the ground.\r\nTo facilitate an agreement based on these criteria,\r\na re-evaluation of the manner in which the Conference\r\nis currently being run is called for. The IGAD frontline\r\nStates must observe the principle of impartiality and\r\nneutrality, without which no mediation can be taken\r\nseriously. Furthermore, the IGAD frontline States must\r\nconfine their role to that of an active facilitator and\r\nattempts to fast-track the process with a view to\r\nreaching any agreement in haste and at any price must\r\nbe discouraged.\r\nIn spite of the current difficulties, I am here to\r\nreiterate before this Assembly the sincere commitment\r\nof the Transitional National Government to the IGAD-\r\nled peace process for Somalia. I hereby state that the\r\nTransitional National Government will rejoin the peace\r\nconference in Mbagathi, Kenya, as soon as its concerns\r\nare fairly addressed. We do this not only for ourselves,\r\nbut also for the Somali people, who have suffered so\r\nlong. I submit that the solution lies in assisting the\r\nSomali parties to come to an agreement that is owned\r\nby all Somalis, rather than in imposing something\r\nagainst their will. We urge the international community\r\nto engage itself in the realization of this goal. We must\r\nall work together to ensure that the march to peace in\r\nSomalia is irreversible.\r\nThe international community has an obligation to\r\nre-engage in Somalia in a very serious manner and to\r\nre-enforce its role as a promoter of peace there at the\r\nSecurity Council and other levels, as it has done with\r\nother conflict areas in Africa. It is not enough to\r\nobserve or to wait and see. Somalia needs serious\r\nsponsorship to push the peace forward. Finally, we urge\r\nthe neighbouring countries of Somalia to scrupulously\r\ncomply with the arms embargo imposed on Somalia by\r\nthe Security Council. We strongly urge them to do so in\r\nthe interest of peace and security in the subregion.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Alfredo Cabral, chairman of the\r\ndelegation of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau.\r\nMr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in French):\r\nYou have assumed the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly, Sir, at a particularly critical time, when the\r\napplicability of rules, the reliability of mechanisms and\r\neven the authority of institutions have been called into\r\nquestion. We are now living through a period of\r\nuncertainty and questioning — uncertainty regarding\r\nthe validity of certain fundamental principles that have\r\nbeen taken for granted and questions about the path to\r\nfollow and the actions to be taken. Against such a\r\ndifficult backdrop and at a time that is, to say the least,\r\nunpredictable, it is encouraging to know that we can\r\ncount on your experience and myriad talents to guide\r\nour work. Guinea-Bissau is gratified by your election\r\nand congratulates you most warmly.\r\nOur programme of work is a heavy one because\r\nonce again we have been unable to draft an agenda that\r\nis more streamlined and less repetitive. As in the past,\r\nwe will therefore be confronted by claims that are all\r\nequally legitimate; unfortunately, however, as always,\r\nrancour will occasionally raise its head. This\r\ndemonstrates the extent to which you, Sir, will require\r\nthe contribution of each and every one of us in order\r\nsuccessfully to complete your mission. In this respect, I\r\nnote with satisfaction that all delegations that have\r\npreceded us at this rostrum have assured you of their\r\nfull support. You may rely on the full cooperation of\r\nthe delegation of Guinea-Bissau. This is all the more\r\ntrue since you have established your mandate under the\r\nsign of action, for it is clear that it is indeed vigorous\r\naction that we shall need to convince those who today\r\ndoubt the ability of the United Nations to meet their\r\nexpectations.\r\nWe need resolute action to ensure respect for the\r\nprinciples and implementation of the objectives of the\r\nCharter. We need collective action to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations capacity to resolve such urgent issues\r\nas poverty and hunger throughout the world, the\r\nHIV/AIDS epidemic, the right to full enjoyment of\r\nhuman rights, control of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nand the deterioration of the environment, our most\r\nprecious heritage, to name but a few. We need\r\nconcerted, multilateral and vigorous action against\r\nterrorism and all those practice, finance, instigate or\r\nare involved in it and commit such cowardly and\r\ndastardly crimes as the attack on the United Nations\r\nheadquarters in Baghdad. We also need action to\r\npromote the adoption of urgent measures to guarantee\r\nthe security of the Organization’s personnel.\r\nWe need urgent and consistent action, too,\r\ndesigned to extinguish hotbeds of tension, resolve\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nconflicts and restore peace wherever it is threatened.\r\nWe need thoughtful, participatory and realistic action\r\ndesigned to improve the functioning of the United\r\nNations system by introducing the necessary structural\r\nreforms and more democratic, transparent and rational\r\npractices in the Security Council, in particular, and\r\nhere in the General Assembly as well. We need\r\nequitable and united action to redress inequality in\r\ntrade, which was recently denounced at the World\r\nTrade Organization Conference in Cancún, and to\r\nadvance socio-economic development in the most\r\ndisadvantaged countries.\r\nEach of us is aware of the daunting nature of the\r\nintricate task facing us. All these objectives and many\r\nothers require of us the steadfast will to harmonize our\r\npoints of view while keeping in mind the crux of the\r\nmatter — our shared responsibility to work together in\r\nthe interests of all Member States. This collective\r\nendeavour can and must succeed, without, however,\r\nobliging us to renounce our principles or ignore those\r\nrules, the relevance and utility of which we are well\r\naware. To that end, we have a unique and irreplaceable\r\nframework — the United Nations, the sole truly global\r\nforum.\r\nTo be sure, our Organization is far from perfect,\r\nbut how could it be otherwise in a world as complex\r\nand unequal as ours? Moreover, we are the United\r\nNations, as was so well recalled by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral before this Assembly. Thus, it is not\r\nunreasonable to believe that, if we agree and if we so\r\ndecide, our Organization could be restructured and\r\nbetter adapted to the rapid transformations we are\r\nwitnessing and, in response to the hopes of all, more\r\ncapable of meeting the growing challenges. The\r\nnecessary reforms are possible so long as Member\r\nStates have the genuine and unflagging political will to\r\nimplement them.\r\nWe have undeniably been sorely tried and tested\r\nthis year. The tragic events of 19 August are still vivid\r\nin our memories, along with the bitterly painful\r\nmemories of our late colleagues and friends, who were\r\nkilled in a cowardly manner and cruelly wrested from\r\ntheir families. We will never be able fully to express\r\nour debt to Sergio and all the others who lost their lives\r\nin the service of the United Nations and the noble goals\r\nand ideals that we champion and shall continue to\r\nchampion together. We must emerge from this ordeal\r\nmore resolute and more united. Circumstances require\r\nno less and we are ethically compelled to do so.\r\nI wish here and now to congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General on his leadership and dedication to\r\nthe cause of peace and to hail the dignity, compassion\r\nand humanism that he demonstrated in the face of such\r\na tragic ordeal as the brutal, wrongful and unforeseen\r\ndeaths of colleagues and personal friends.\r\nThe United Nations, for the first time in a long\r\nwhile, has been bypassed — indeed, forced to take a\r\nback seat — in the management of a crisis, the nature\r\nand gravity of which required it to play its due role\r\ntherein. Beyond the differences that emerged within the\r\ninternational community, and in particular among the\r\nmembers of the Security Council, regarding the right\r\nway to deal with an outlaw, recidivist and dangerous\r\nregime, the issue of Iraq once again highlighted the\r\nlimitations of an Organization that, while universal,\r\nnevertheless depends on a small number of its\r\nMembers. That is one of the reasons behind the many\r\nfrustrations voiced year after year from this rostrum.\r\nOur continent, Africa, still faces difficulties of all\r\nkinds. Poverty and endemic malnutrition are\r\ncompounded by the agonies of HIV/AIDS, which\r\ncontinues to kill millions of individuals. There is also\r\nthe growing number of conflicts and the proliferation\r\nof small arms, which pose an ongoing threat to the\r\npeace and stability of the countries of our continent.\r\nThis unfortunate picture is particularly accurate\r\nfor West Africa, where several armed conflicts have\r\nerupted in recent years, with Liberia as their epicenter.\r\nEveryone is now aware of what some of us, the\r\nRepublic of Guinea in particular, have been saying for\r\nyears: The civil war in Liberia is contagious and the\r\ntrigger of a series of crises and armed conflicts in the\r\nsubregion. It has now touched countries that were once\r\nheld up as examples of political stability and economic\r\ngrowth and were believed to be immune to such\r\ndisasters.\r\nMy delegation should like to welcome the\r\nprogress recently made in Liberia. The people of that\r\ncountry deserve finally to live in peace. It is a people\r\nthat, as we all know, has suffered greatly from many\r\nyears of war and destruction. We were also totally\r\nshocked to see all those children being used as cannon\r\nfodder in a war that was unjustified and unjustifiable.\r\nWe also note with satisfaction the progress made in\r\nSierra Leone. There, too, it was high time for peace to\r\nbe restored. We are also pleased that our friends in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo have finally\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\ncommitted themselves on the path to progress and\r\nnational reconciliation.\r\nMy country, Guinea-Bissau, has undergone some\r\nchanges, the nature of which and the methods used to\r\neffect them have been subject to criticism, running the\r\ngamut from simple regret to formal condemnation.\r\nThese are positions of principle that we understand and\r\naccept, for we have never ceased to proclaim our\r\ndevotion to democracy and the rule of law. I recall here\r\nthat my country was one of the first in Africa to wage\r\nan exemplary liberation struggle on behalf of freedom,\r\nhuman rights and democracy.\r\nHowever, the sad realities of life, particularly\r\nwhen they are characterized by chronic and dangerous\r\nconstitutional instability, can unfortunately lead to the\r\noverthrow of an existing regime specifically to prevent\r\nthe exacerbation of social and political tensions in the\r\ncountry that could lead to confrontation or even civil\r\nwar.\r\nIn Guinea-Bissau, a military committee decided\r\nto reflect in action the hopes for change of the majority\r\nof the population. Not a single shot was fired. No one\r\nin Guinea-Bissau has been arrested and I welcome the\r\nfact that the military has rejected any consideration of\r\nexercising power. In such circumstances, it is hardly\r\nsurprising that the people have adhered to this\r\nmovement, which has effected the changes they\r\ndesired. Indeed, the people’s support was total.\r\nThe members of the military committee for the\r\nrestitution of the constitutional and democratic order\r\nwere in fact acclaimed as genuine liberators. In\r\nGuinea-Bissau, we had been in an untenable situation.\r\nOur people, whose courage and dignity cannot be\r\noveremphasized, had had enough. They had reached\r\nthe limit of what one can decently ask someone to put\r\nup with. I cannot sufficiently reiterate the extent to\r\nwhich our people deserve to be encouraged, supported\r\nand assisted.\r\nNow that we have decided to turn the page, to\r\nlook towards the future and to determine how we, the\r\ncitizens of Guinea-Bissau, can be reconciled, unite our\r\nforces, create synergy and act together for the well-\r\nbeing of our people, the international community\r\nshould intercede on our behalf and to provide the\r\nfinancial assistance we need. It is indeed financial\r\nassistance that we need, because our country and our\r\nState are destitute. We need international assistance to\r\nrecover, to meet our challenges and to ensure that our\r\npeople can eat. We need to see to it that those who\r\nchose freedom some 30 years ago can finally see it\r\nflourish, enjoy its benefits and understand why they\r\nfought and why they have a right to a decent and better\r\nlife.\r\nI should like to say here that, right now in our\r\ncountry, a process is under way that is bringing\r\ntogether all the vital forces of our nation. The political\r\nparties, the military committee and civil society —\r\neveryone has come together to meet the challenge as\r\none and to answer the call of the people to join forces\r\nand work together. As I speak before this Assembly,\r\nthe membership of the Government is under discussion.\r\nThanks to concerted action and a professional and\r\nintensive analysis of the situation in our country, we\r\nhave been able to adopt an interim charter that\r\nspecifies all the stages required to restore as soon as\r\npossible the constitutional and democratic order that\r\nwe and the international community wish to see return\r\nto Guinea-Bissau.\r\nAn Interim President has been chosen by\r\nconsensus. This President is dedicated to working for\r\nthe unity of the country. He intends to strengthen\r\nnational unity and to serve as a catalyst so that we can\r\nreturn to our ideal of progress and freedom.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to thank our brothers\r\nand sisters of the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) subregion, who have striven\r\nto help us get back on our feet, discuss and find the\r\nmost appropriate solutions to our problems. I thank\r\nfirst of all the Heads of State of Ghana, Senegal and\r\nNigeria, who have visited Guinea-Bissau, as well as the\r\nECOWAS ministers, who have never failed to support\r\nGuinea-Bissau. I also wish to note the assistance\r\nprovided to us by the Community of Portuguese-\r\nSpeaking Countries, which dispatched the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Timor-Leste to advise us and to\r\nvoice the solidarity of that linguistic community, to\r\nwhich we belong.\r\nA country’s national unity is its most precious\r\nasset. I cannot overemphasize that fact and I hope that I\r\nshall soon see democracy fully restored in my country.\r\nAbove all, however, I wish to see the people of Guinea-\r\nBissau happy. It is a proud and dignified people that\r\nhas suffered in silence — a most eloquent silence —\r\nand that deserves the trust and assistance of the\r\ninternational community.\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Martin Belinga-Eboutou, chairman of\r\nthe delegation of the Republic of Cameroon.\r\nMr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): I should like at the outset to congratulate you,\r\nSir, on your assumption of the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. You have\r\nset in motion a cycle of African presidencies of the\r\nAssembly — today, the African diaspora, tomorrow the\r\nAfrican motherland. Your election attests to the high\r\nesteem in which the Member States hold your country,\r\nSaint Lucia, a traditional partner of Cameroon in the\r\ngreat African, Caribbean and Pacific family. It is also\r\ntestimony to the trust that the representatives of those\r\nStates place in you and your eminent diplomatic\r\nqualities. You may rest assured that my delegation will\r\ncooperate fully with you, as we have the pleasure of\r\nbeing a member of your Bureau in our capacity as\r\nChairman of the Third Committee. Allow me to extend\r\nmy wishes of success to the other members of the\r\nBureau.\r\nI also take this opportunity to commend your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for the skill with which he\r\nguided our work at the last session.\r\nTo Secretary-General Kofi Annan, I wish to\r\nreiterate, in the context of the current international\r\nscene, Cameroon’s expression of great pride and trust\r\nin him and his role as a facilitator in the settlement of\r\ninter-African conflicts. I thank him for his energetic\r\nand tireless activity in the service of the great ideals of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nOur Organization was created to preserve future\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war, to create\r\nconditions in which all can enjoy dignified lives, and to\r\npromote respect for human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms. The United Nations was created to ensure\r\nthe reign of peace at the service of humankind. As\r\nPope John XXIII recalled in his encyclical Pacem in\r\nTerris, which was addressed to all men of good will\r\nand the fortieth anniversary of which we celebrate this\r\nyear, that peace rests on four indispensable conditions\r\ncorresponding to four specific necessities of the human\r\nspirit: truth, justice, charity and liberty. Our heads of\r\nState trod the same path at the Millennium Summit.\r\nThey undertook to free humankind from warfare and\r\npoverty, to promote human rights and to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations. We felt that it would be useful to recall\r\nthose principles because the picture of the world that\r\nhas emerged in this general debate since 23 September\r\nis not a very optimistic one.\r\nOn 19 August, the United Nations was struck by\r\ntragedy. The terrorist attack that destroyed the United\r\nNations headquarters in Baghdad and struck and killed\r\ndozens of innocent victims, including Sergio Vieira de\r\nMello, Special Representative of the Secretary-General\r\nfor Iraq, posed a great challenge to the principles and\r\nvalues that are the bedrock of our Organization. At the\r\ntime, President Paul Biya expressed on behalf of\r\nCameroon expressed his profound indignation and\r\nfirmly condemned that odious, criminal act. Tomorrow,\r\nwe will weep with the people of Iraq for the tragic\r\ndeath — again in Baghdad — of Akila Al-Hashemi, a\r\nhighly talented diplomat and eminent member of the\r\nIraqi Governing Council.\r\nCameroon is proud that our Organization did not\r\nshirk its responsibilities or even weaken in its resolve\r\nto play a central role in the stabilization, orderly\r\nrestoration of the sovereignty and reconstruction of\r\nIraq and to support the political process under way.\r\nFollowing upon the long series of terrorist acts\r\ncommitted throughout the world since the tragedy of 11\r\nSeptember 2001, the 19 August attack in Baghdad was\r\na timely reminder of the vulnerability of our world\r\ntoday. The complexity of the challenge and the gravity\r\nof the danger require us to step up our collective efforts\r\neffectively to confront terrorism, which today poses\r\nperhaps the most serious threat to international peace\r\nand security. Cameroon again calls for a high-level\r\nconference to be convened to define a collective\r\norganized response by the international community to\r\nterrorism.\r\nIn addition to new threats to international peace\r\nand security, such as terrorism and the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, there are other, equally\r\ndangerous, threats: all sorts of pandemics, including\r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, and despair\r\nstemming from almost endemic poverty.\r\nTherefore, our joint mobilization should be aimed\r\nprimarily at reducing or even eliminating the germs\r\nand causes of conflicts and despair.\r\nIn the Middle East, we must demand that the\r\nparties to the conflict — Israel and Palestine — return\r\nwithout delay to the negotiating table to agree on\r\nmodalities conducive to the rapid and comprehensive\r\nimplementation of the road map. Cameroon regrets and\r\ncondemns the escalation of violence, which is seriously\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nendangering any peaceful solution based on the letter\r\nand spirit of Security Council resolution 1397 (2002),\r\nadopted with no vote against. In it the Council affirmed\r\n“the vision of a region where two States, Israel\r\nand Palestine, live side by side within secure and\r\nrecognized borders”.\r\nOur Palestinian and Israeli friends must get used\r\nto the idea that they are condemned to live side by side,\r\nto coexist in the geopolitical configuration forged by\r\ntheir rich, common history. To that end, Israelis and\r\nPalestinians will have to disarm — of course, in terms\r\nof weapon policies, but primarily disarm at the cultural\r\nlevel by unanimously and sincerely ridding their hearts\r\nof fear and the psychosis of war. The axiom that peace\r\nresults from a balance of war-making ability and\r\nweapons should be replaced by the principle that real\r\npeace can be built only on mutual trust.\r\nThe same applies to the peoples of the renowned\r\nMesopotamia, who are emerging from three decades of\r\ntyranny, and must very soon, with the help of the\r\ninternational community, have their full dignity and\r\nsovereignty restored in a stable and prosperous Iraq,\r\nliving in peace with all its neighbours.\r\nOver the past year, the many conflicts that have\r\nbloodied Africa have remained at the centre of the\r\nconcerns of the United Nations, which has made many\r\nefforts to end them. Fortunately, those efforts are\r\nbeginning to yield results. Some African conflicts are\r\non the way to being resolved, nourishing new and\r\nlegitimate hopes. Unfortunately, despite everything,\r\nthere are still deplorable situations where the\r\nprotagonists are having trouble finding a negotiated\r\npolitical solution or keeping their commitments. We are\r\nconvinced that there will soon be results, given genuine\r\npolitical will on the part of the major actors. The\r\nirreplaceable support they receive from the United\r\nNations deserves to be welcomed and recognized.\r\nAfrica in general and our subregion in particular\r\nare fully aware of the role this important partner plays\r\nin our economic development, in consolidating\r\ndemocracy and the rule of law, and, finally, in\r\npromoting peace and security within and outside our\r\ncountries. That is why the member States of the\r\nEconomic Community of Central African States\r\n(ECCAS) have forcefully expressed their desire to\r\nstrengthen their cooperation with the United Nations\r\nthrough a political presence of that Organization in the\r\nsubregion, which would bolster our subregional\r\ncapacities, particularly in the area of peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nIn that connection, Cameroon reiterates its thanks\r\nto the Secretary-General for sending a\r\nmultidisciplinary mission to Central Africa last June at\r\nthe request of the members of the Security Council. We\r\nawait with interest its innovative recommendations,\r\nwhich will shortly be made to the Security Council.\r\nThey will nourish the debate to be held in this Hall on\r\nthe agenda item entitled “Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Economic Community of\r\nCentral African States”.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s suggestions\r\nconcerning the functioning of the Organization in this\r\nconstantly changing world. We will fully support any\r\nreform that will bring the Organization closer to our\r\npeoples, as envisaged by the measures for strengthened\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and Central\r\nAfrican organizations.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration, the political\r\nleaders of the world committed themselves to creating\r\na world partnership for development and to respond to\r\nthe special needs of Africa. The New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), whereby Africa has\r\ndecided to take back the initiative and to control its\r\nown fate, can serve as a sound platform for a fruitful\r\npartnership between the continent and the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nAfrica is waiting for multiple responses. One,\r\nwhich will play a decisive part in the growth of our\r\ncontinent, is linked to trade. What African States want\r\nand aspire to is to play a more important part in the\r\ntrade of goods and services. That implies in particular\r\nstandards favouring fair competition.\r\nThe failure of the recent World Trade\r\nOrganization Ministerial Conference held at Cancún\r\nhas raised grave doubts, particularly among African\r\ncountries that export agricultural products. The\r\ntremendous reluctance of wealthy nations to dismantle\r\ntheir agricultural subsidy regimes is puzzling, and\r\nseriously threatens the survival of African economies\r\nbased on agriculture and livestock. The subsidies given\r\nto that sector are stifling millions of farmers and cotton\r\nproducers in Central and West Africa.\r\nIn the same context, Mr. President, your country,\r\nSaint Lucia, and Cameroon have been carrying out an\r\nepic battle for almost a decade for the survival of our\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nbanana industries, which are up against the giants of\r\nthe sector.\r\nThere are many more examples of the need for\r\nsolidarity and urgent reform of the multilateral\r\neconomic system. We hope that the Doha round will\r\nnot deviate from its main objective — development —\r\nand that it will take well into consideration the\r\nconcerns of the poorest in order to integrate them\r\npromptly into the global economy.\r\nGlobalization does not relate only to trade. It also\r\naffects human development and new technologies, the\r\nprotection of the ecosystem and the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of water and other natural resources. All\r\nof those aspects require a concerted approach, given\r\nthat the sacrifices of some work to everyone’s\r\nadvantage. Cameroon, which has chosen, for example,\r\nto participate in rational and sustainable management\r\nof the world forest ecosystem, has established a bold\r\nnational environmental management plan.\r\nIt is clear that, in order to effectively implement\r\nsuch policies without exposing its rural populations to\r\nextreme poverty, our country needs significant\r\nfinancial assistance, particularly to diversify its\r\nproduction and to ensure systematic transformation of\r\nits natural resources. In other words, today, more than\r\never before, solidarity should rhyme with\r\npartnership — and globalization with fair trade — to\r\nensure the comprehensive and orderly development of\r\nour world.\r\nThe United Nations assuredly remains the only\r\nuniversal Organization that not only possesses the\r\nnecessary competencies and impartiality, but is also the\r\nonly entity that can confer legitimacy on any\r\nmultilateral action tackling the great world challenges,\r\na number of which we have just listed. To attain these\r\nnoble objectives, it urgently needs to consider in depth\r\nits current approaches, the way it operates and its\r\nimplementing mechanisms.\r\nCameroon unreservedly supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s initiative to establish a high-level panel of\r\neminent personalities to consider ways to strengthen\r\nthe United Nations. We hopefully await their\r\ncontribution to the Organization’s necessary and\r\nunavoidable reform to improve its performance,\r\nincluding its missions of an economic and social nature\r\nas well as international peace and security.\r\nThe Secretary-General invites us to go further\r\nalong the path of reform, to which he has been\r\ncommitted for several years. He is right. What is at\r\nstake is the Organization’s very effectiveness, which it\r\nneeds to tackle the great challenges of our time. He can\r\ncount on Cameroon’s support.\r\nAs I have been concluding my remarks, the light\r\nhas changed from green to yellow and from yellow to\r\nred. How can one refrain from prolonging his\r\ncomments when it is a question of humanity and\r\nhumanity’s future through peace, a negotiated peace, a\r\nconcerted peace, a peace that rests on justice and the\r\nequitable distribution of benefits and wealth?\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Ahmad Chalabi, chairman of the delegation of the\r\nRepublic of Iraq.\r\nMr. Chalabi (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): Today I\r\nstand before the Assembly representing the voice of the\r\nIraqi citizen who long suffered from cruelty within and\r\noutside his homeland. Those within his country\r\ninflicted on him the worst kinds of torture: they\r\nattacked his honour, assaulted his family, humiliated\r\nhim, shackled him, oppressed him and forced him into\r\nmiserable wars. His brothers and his friends in the\r\nregion not only remained silent, ignored him and\r\nturned a blind eye to his catastrophe, they also\r\ncriticized and faulted him the moment he dared to\r\nspeak up. And throughout the world, those who stood\r\nto benefit scrambled to do business and cooperate with\r\nhis torturer.\r\nVery few accepted and spoke the truth; very few\r\nconsidered the catastrophe of their fellow human being\r\nand declared that he was a victim. He heard no\r\nresponse to his appeals. So the Iraqi citizen remained\r\nlost and doubly persecuted — first, with the injustice\r\nof the sword with which the dictatorial regime attacked\r\nhim at home, and then with the injustice of criticism —\r\na more painful affliction — from many abroad. But the\r\nIraqi citizen did not give up. Rather, he was persistent\r\nand patient, and he continued his struggle through his\r\nthoughts, words and actions to achieve liberation, the\r\nideal for which he had always yearned most.\r\nI stand today before the Assembly expressing to\r\nMembers to the best of my ability the voice of this\r\nIraqi individual, declaring with him and on his behalf\r\nthe end of silence. I ask each Member present here to\r\nlisten to him.\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nI come today to present the Assembly with four\r\nessential truths and to demonstrate, through those\r\ntruths, two fundamental rights.\r\nThe first truth is that Iraq’s long, dark night has\r\nended. The bitter experience of humiliation,\r\noppression, suppression, and dictatorship that the Iraqis\r\nendured for more than three decades has ended. It\r\nended with the fleeing of the head of the regime, along\r\nwith his cronies, and with the collapse of the symbols\r\nthat he had erected in Baghdad and throughout Iraq.\r\nThe second truth is that the liberation of Iraq —\r\nand what took place was indeed liberation — could not\r\nhave been achieved had it not been for the resolve of\r\nPresident George W. Bush and the commitment of the\r\ncoalition, headed by the United States of America and\r\nthe United Kingdom. The Iraqis will never forget their\r\nsacrifices and the courage they displayed in Iraq’s\r\nliberation. If today we hear the voices of those who\r\nquestion the intentions of the Governments of the\r\nUnited States and the United Kingdom in undertaking\r\nthe liberation, we invite them to come to visit the mass\r\ngraves, the drained marshes and the gassed city of\r\nHalabja, and to examine the list of the missing whose\r\nright to life was taken from them by the regime.\r\nThe third truth is that the liberation embodied a\r\nuniversal Iraqi national resolve. The liberation came as\r\na result of vigorous Iraqi efforts to oppose the deposed\r\nregime during many long years when hundreds of\r\nthousands of martyrs were sacrificed. The martyr\r\nAyatollah Muhammad Bakr al-Hakim and his\r\ncompanions — may God rest their souls — were not\r\nthe last victims; they added another page to the annals\r\nof Iraqi bravery on 29 August, the day of the Iraqi\r\nmartyr. Nor was death by treachery spared the martyr\r\nAkila al-Hashemi.\r\nThe fourth truth is that the removal of the regime\r\nwas only the prelude to the birth of a new Iraq. The\r\nbirth that has been prepared for by so many faithful\r\nIraqis, both at home and abroad, is at hand.\r\nA unique experience awaits us in Iraq today. We\r\nwill succeed through our desire to do good, to achieve\r\ndevelopment and to let freedom spread and flourish. I\r\nstand here today to confirm that, with God’s help, we\r\nin Iraq will accept nothing short of success. Iraqis are\r\ncapable of succeeding, and they want to succeed. We\r\nwill not allow a gang of mercenaries and terrorists to\r\ndeprive the Iraqi citizen, the Iraqi society and the Iraqi\r\nnation of a bright tomorrow.\r\nThe land of the two rivers, the cradle of\r\ncivilization, the land of Sumer, Akkad, Babylon and\r\nAssyria, the land of peace, the land of the caliphate and\r\nthe house of wisdom, the home of the Code of\r\nHammurabi and the storehouse of accumulated\r\nknowledge, literature, poetry and intellectual\r\nachievement is dependent, first and foremost, on its\r\nhuman resources more than on its natural and oil\r\nresources.\r\nOn the basis of its human resources, Iraq can\r\nundergo a qualitative sea change, moving it from the\r\ngrip of totalitarianism and fear to stability, prosperity\r\nand tolerance. What the international community puts\r\ninto Iraq will be returned many times over. Put your\r\nconfidence in Iraq and receive from it stability and\r\nprosperity. Not only would stability and prosperity be\r\nIraq’s but they would spread to the rest of the region\r\nand the entire world.\r\nThe Iraq that we want to see is the Iraq of the\r\ninnovative individual. More than 60 per cent of Iraq’s\r\npopulation is below the age of 20. Our first priority in\r\npreparing those young people for the twenty-first\r\ncentury is to give them cultural and educational values\r\nthat will enable each of them to prove themselves and\r\ntheir particularities in a new Iraq.\r\nIn the past in Iraq, as in other nations that\r\nsuffered under the ideologies of the twentieth century,\r\nthe individual was suppressed by the masses, the\r\nmasses by the revolution, the revolution by the party,\r\nand the party by the leader. The result was that the\r\nhuman being was lost under continuous layers of\r\nnegation that obliterated his individuality, making him\r\nan object for consumption in an ostensible defence of\r\nthe nation and in the name of the revolution, or to be\r\nsacrificed, body and soul, for the leader. The concerns\r\nof Iraqis are no different from those of all other peoples\r\nof the world. Iraqis are eager to define themselves and\r\nto project their singularity. The Iraq of tomorrow must\r\nrecognize the individual citizen as the basis of\r\nsovereignty and the starting point for legislation.\r\nThe rights of the individual are fundamental; the\r\nrights of the group derive from them. Iraqis, like other\r\npeoples, insist on their right to dignity, freedom, justice\r\nand peace. The assertion of such rights will build the\r\nfoundations of tomorrow’s Iraq. The dignity of every\r\nIraqi, without exception, must be guaranteed, without\r\nconsideration for social status, political position or\r\neconomic situation. An accused person will not lose his\r\n29\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\ndignity, even if found guilty. We will begin with\r\ndignity because the previous regime worked futilely to\r\nconvince Iraqis that their dignity was an endowment\r\nfrom the ruler. Today, we stress that the dignity of the\r\nentire nation stems from the dignity of each citizen.\r\nAs with dignity, so with freedom. Freedom is not\r\na gift from the ruler or the State. Rather, it is a basic\r\nprinciple, the essence of a human being. Responsible\r\nfreedom that does not impinge upon the liberties of\r\nothers is the core of the social contract. Despite the\r\nexcesses of outsiders and infiltrators since the fall of\r\nthe repressive regime, Iraqis have proved to themselves\r\nthat freedom means neither chaos nor the law of the\r\njungle.\r\nThe individual has an instinct for freedom, and\r\nthus he demands justice. The previous regime\r\nundermined justice and transformed it into a tool of the\r\nState to oppress and suppress the people. The new Iraq\r\nwill be based on a firm justice system that ensures the\r\nindependence and integrity of the judiciary. After the\r\nsenseless wars that destroyed innumerable lives,\r\nleaving disaster in their wake, the new Iraq will adopt a\r\nnew defensive policy based on peace. Iraq will be an\r\nactivist for peace for the region and the world. The\r\naforementioned four truths will form the foundation of\r\nIraq’s political future.\r\nIraq will abide strictly and explicitly by all\r\nhuman rights instruments, beginning with the\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, guaranteeing the right of\r\nman to life, property and the pursuit of happiness.\r\nWe pledge that Iraqi laws and legislation apply\r\nequally to all the people. No person will be above the\r\nlaw for any reason, regardless of merit or individual\r\nresponsibility. Indeed, there will be no distinction on\r\nthe basis of religion, sect, race, language, ethnicity,\r\ngender, class or tribe. The defunct regime exploited\r\nthose divisions for its own ends. The new Iraq will rely\r\non justice and fairness.\r\nIraqi women are capable of innovative excellence\r\nand productivity and can take on all the responsibilities\r\nof the nation. It is the duty of society and the State to\r\nremove any obstacles in their way.\r\nThe constant dialogue that is required between\r\nIraqi citizens and the State that represents and serves\r\nthem will take place on the basis of an honest,\r\ndemocratic and representational system. This system is\r\nbased on the principle of the separation of powers, and\r\nfirmly upholds elections as the ultimate arbiter. We are\r\nnot concerned with the dressings of democracy, but\r\nwith the safety of the political system as the\r\nincarnation of the democratic spirit.\r\nThe pillars of this system are, first and foremost,\r\nthe separation of powers in the framework of a written\r\nconstitution that avoids duplication in the judicial,\r\nlegislative and executive powers. That will provide a\r\nsound basis for each to oversee the other. Secondly,\r\naccountability will be ensured as a result of such\r\nsupervision and by means of elections that will provide\r\nfor the participation of individuals in politics. Finally,\r\ncivil society will be empowered by means of a free\r\npress, unions and independent institutions, which will\r\nact as monitors and critics and represent the plurality of\r\npolitical forces in the country.\r\nThe third pillar is the upholding of transparency\r\nas a fundamental principle, based on the sovereignty of\r\nthe individual citizen. The State exists to serve, and is\r\nanswerable to the citizen, who is entitled to inquire into\r\nits affairs. The State does not have the right to withhold\r\ninformation on its affairs. The fourth pillar is\r\nrecognition by the minority of the right of the majority\r\nto assume power, and the respect by the majority of the\r\nrights of the minority. Here, it is important to\r\ndistinguish between a political majority and minority\r\nand a factional majority and minority. Political\r\nmajorities and minorities are determined by the ballot\r\nbox, not by a population census or random correlations.\r\nNo one has the authority to arrogate to himself a\r\npolitical right on the basis of a presumed factional\r\nmajority. We do not want a political, sectarian or\r\nnational allocation in Iraq. A sound representative,\r\nfederal political system can best express the interests of\r\nall Iraqi citizens in a manner that reflects their religion,\r\ncreed, ethnicity or language.\r\nThe previous period was characterized by\r\nrestricting all power to an abusive few in Baghdad, but\r\ntomorrow’s Iraq will be based on the principle of local\r\nauthority in the context of a federal union. Federalism\r\nas construed by Iraqis is not based on the division of\r\nthe homeland; rather, it is a way of empowering and\r\nrehabilitating those living in different regions to take\r\ndirect responsibility for their affairs in their own\r\nregions, without constant interference from the central\r\nGovernment.\r\nOur constitution charts the relationship between\r\nintegrated and continuous local and national\r\n30\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nauthorities. We rely on the federal system, as we do on\r\nthe democratic system, because we have a clear\r\nunderstanding of the relationship between the State and\r\nits citizens. This relationship is not one of\r\nguardianship, because the Iraqi citizen is not a minor\r\nand is therefore not in need of the State’s interference\r\nin all his affairs. Our concern is to ensure that this\r\nrelationship is based on care, with the State being the\r\nvigilant servant of the citizen, and on nurturing in some\r\nareas, especially with regard to the provision of\r\neducation and social and health services for young\r\npeople.\r\nComplementing our belief in federalism, and in\r\ncontrast with the vain and false nationalist excesses of\r\nthe previous regime, we declare that Iraq is one nation,\r\npermanent and whole.\r\nNothing in this declaration belittles the continuity\r\nof our Arab and Muslim heritage, or contradicts the\r\nsentiments of many Iraqis about their own culture and\r\nnational identity. Rather, it confirms that all the\r\nterritory of Iraq — from its mountains in the far north\r\nto its marshes and the Gulf in the extreme south,\r\nincluding its rivers, plains and deserts — is a lasting,\r\nindivisible unit. This is an expression not only of the\r\ntrue beliefs of most Iraqis, but also of a key political\r\nprinciple and point of reference that will help the\r\ncountry recognize realities on the ground and avoid\r\nfurther upheaval.\r\nWhile we seek to strengthen the rule of law and\r\ninstitutions of governance, we wish to make clear that\r\nauthority emanates from the citizen who occupies the\r\npolitical position not from the political post itself.\r\nThere must be a legal foundation in this respect, and\r\ndecisions must not be taken because of the whims or\r\nopinions of a person in authority. The previous regime\r\nissued many arbitrary rules, regulations and decisions\r\nbased on one man’s views. The alternative in\r\ntomorrow’s Iraq will be the application of the rule of\r\nlaw through sanctioned legislative authority that\r\nreflects the will of the Iraqi people, through an\r\nindependent judiciary and under the supervision of an\r\nelected legal body.\r\nLast but not least, let me touch on the relationship\r\nbetween religion and State in the new Iraq. Islam is the\r\nreligion of the overwhelming majority of Iraqis. It is\r\nvital to the Iraqi identity as well as to the State and the\r\nnature of governance. In any case, the great\r\ncivilizational heritage and rich cultural repository of\r\nIslamic jurisprudence is, no doubt, one of Iraq’s assets,\r\nand we will benefit from it through a judiciary that is\r\nbased on equality and pluralism.\r\nLet me point out a truth that is often overlooked:\r\nthat the State, during the previous century, used\r\nreligion for its own ends and took from it what suited\r\nthose who had usurped power. They rejected the\r\nindependence of institutions and of religious centres,\r\ntaking over the Awqaf and imposing a religious\r\nterminology that suited their own interests, at the\r\nexpense of those of others. In Iraq, religion is one of\r\nthe most important assets of the individual and of\r\nsociety. We will not abandon it in any area, or reject its\r\njudicial, intellectual, behavioural or daily implications.\r\nWe call for the rehabilitation of all religious\r\ninstitutions by enabling them to reassume their\r\nresponsibilities in protecting Iraqi citizens who seek\r\ntheir moral and spiritual guidance without hypocritical\r\npolitical involvement.\r\nThese are the main guidelines for what we want\r\nfor our country.\r\nOur right today is to demand help and assistance\r\nfrom the world, thanking all those who stood by the\r\nIraqis in their darkest hour and forgiving those who\r\ninadvertently did not stand with us. It is important for\r\nall nations of the world to acknowledge that what\r\nhappened in Iraq — past atrocities and today’s\r\nreconstruction — reflects an ongoing and dramatic\r\nhistorical event. The international community must\r\nstand shoulder to shoulder with us. That is what we\r\nourselves want and what we want from others on the\r\nroad to a free, just and peaceful Iraq.\r\nWe want an Iraq in which unity and plurality are\r\ntwo sides of the same coin. We want an Iraq that\r\nreturns sovereignty to the individual citizen, not to the\r\nleader. We want an Iraq that is secure in its cultural and\r\nreligious identity and engaged in open dialogue with\r\nthe world. We want an Iraq that embraces its past while\r\nlooking to the future — an Iraq that is at peace with\r\nitself, its neighbours and with the world. We want an\r\nIraq that will eradicate all Ba’athists once and for all,\r\nbring all their officials to justice and prevent them from\r\nassuming power again.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI stand before the Assembly as the representative\r\nof a free Iraq. To all those here who helped us in our\r\nstruggle for liberation, we extend our gratitude. Our\r\n31\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nliberation would not have been achieved without the\r\ndetermination of President George W. Bush and the\r\ncommitment of the coalition, at the forefront of which\r\nstand the people of the United States of American and\r\nGreat Britain. The Iraqis will never forget their courage\r\nand sacrifice on our behalf.\r\nTo those who stood with the dictator and who\r\ncontinued to question to intentions of the American and\r\nBritish Governments in undertaking this liberation —\r\nwe invite you to come and visit the mass graves where\r\nhalf a million of our citizens lie. Come and visit the\r\ndried-up marshes, come and visit Halabja, where\r\nchemicals were dropped on civilians. Come and\r\nexamine the lists of the disappeared, whose right to life\r\nwas taken from them by Saddam Hussain, and we, the\r\nIraqi people, will ask you why you chose to remain\r\nsilent. We are here today to declare that a new Iraq has\r\nbeen born — an Iraq in which dignity, justice and\r\nhuman rights are assured for all citizens, an Iraq at\r\npeace with its people, its neighbours and the world, an\r\nIraq that stands ready to regain its rightful place in the\r\ninternational community of free and proud nations.\r\nStatement by the President\r\nThe President: We have come to the end of the\r\ngeneral debate of the fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly. It is noteworthy that this session attracted\r\nthe highest level of participation since the Millennium\r\nSummit. Among the 189 speakers, the Assembly heard\r\n50 heads of State, 27 heads of Government and 94\r\nDeputy Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers.\r\nI express my sincere appreciation to every head\r\nof State or Government, Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nForeign Minister for their active participation, their\r\nconstructive contribution to the debate and their\r\nsupport for my stated priorities.\r\nWhen I opened this general debate, I indicated\r\nthat I would be listening carefully to the priorities\r\nidentified by high-level participants, which would\r\nprovide the framework for the Assembly’s work. What\r\nI have heard gives a clear indication of where Member\r\nStates are on many of the critical issues that will be\r\nbefore the Assembly.\r\nThere was resounding support in the general\r\ndebate for multilateralism and for the reaffirmation of\r\nthe United Nations as the primary international\r\nOrganization to address critical global problems. In\r\nfact, many expressed the view that, in these unsettled\r\ntimes, the United Nations and multilateralism were\r\nneeded now more than ever.\r\nThe central role of the General Assembly as\r\nadvocate and as a supervisory and policy-making body\r\nwas a point consistently made. However, continuing\r\nrevitalization efforts were urged, in order to permit the\r\nAssembly to deal effectively with challenges both old\r\nand new.\r\nDevelopment and the prosperity of countries and\r\nregions received much attention from high-level\r\nrepresentatives. They supported the view that the fifty-\r\neighth session should give appropriate focus to issues\r\nsuch as poverty, HIV/AIDS, equity in the global\r\neconomic system and the preservation of the\r\nenvironment. The regrettable outcome of the Cancún\r\nround of negotiations gives new impetus to calls for\r\nfull consideration of development issues by the General\r\nAssembly, including the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. Some speakers reminded us that the outcome of\r\nthe High-level Dialogue on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, set for 29 and 30 October 2003, will be\r\ncritical to the work we will do in the area of\r\ndevelopment. Therefore, we expect wide representation\r\nand high-level participation in the High- Level\r\nDialogue.\r\nStrong support was expressed for the 10-year\r\nreview of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. This\r\nshould augur well for the successful review and\r\nimplementation of its outcome.\r\nConsiderable attention was given to Africa’s\r\ndevelopment needs, as well as to the requirement to\r\nkeep these matters high on the Assembly’s agenda.\r\nMany stressed the need for continued international\r\nsupport for the implementation of the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD), and for\r\ncooperation and support to bring peace and stability to\r\nthe African continent.\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, in his report on\r\nthe work of the Organization, gave us thought-\r\nprovoking insights into his priorities for the coming\r\nyear. In this context, we have noted the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals on United Nations reform,\r\nincluding the establishment of a high-level panel of\r\neminent persons to review these matters for our\r\nconsideration.\r\n32\r\nA/58/PV.22\r\nSecurity Council reform continued to command\r\nattention. The general view was that the Assembly\r\nshould continue this work, notwithstanding the fact that\r\nefforts made in this area for more than a decade had not\r\nyielded any tangible results.\r\nI do not recall a statement in which the situation\r\nin post-war Iraq and the need to urgently address all its\r\naspects were not emphasized as a priority for the\r\nUnited Nations. This was an area in which general\r\nsupport was expressed for initiatives to bring relief to\r\nthe people of Iraq and to permit them to take\r\nresponsibility for their own future.\r\nAlmost without exception, all condemned the\r\nbrutal attack on the United Nations premises in\r\nBaghdad on 19 August 2003 and the loss of life and\r\ninjury to United Nations staff. It was agreed that the\r\nattack was the latest and most formidable challenge to\r\nthe United Nations and to the security of United\r\nNations staff. There was support for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s initiative to review the matter of safety and\r\nsecurity of United Nations staff.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East was considered\r\nto be a matter of grave concern. It was thought that the\r\nGeneral Assembly could send a strong message to both\r\nsides in the conflict — Israel and Palestine — to put an\r\nend to bloodshed and violence. Implementation of the\r\nproposed road map was seen by many as a viable\r\nmeans of bringing long-lasting peace to the Middle\r\nEast.\r\nThe one-day high-level plenary on HIV/AIDS,\r\nwhich took place on 22 September 2003, immediately\r\npreceding the general debate, was considered by all to\r\nhave been both constructive and productive. The views\r\nexpressed in both the plenary and the interactive debate\r\nunderscored the need for a cooperative approach in\r\naddressing this most devastating pandemic.\r\nThose are my brief, personal observations of\r\nsalient issues raised in the general debate, which I\r\nthought I should share with the Assembly. As I\r\nreviewed the many statements, I was struck by the\r\ncommon ground among speakers over a wide range of\r\nissues. This makes me hopeful that we will be able to\r\ndo good work in the General Assembly during the\r\nfifty-eighth session.\r\nOur leaders have given direction to the work we\r\nare to do, and political support for it. We must now\r\ncarry forward the commitments they have made, if the\r\nhopes and aspirations expressed are to be realized.\r\nLet me conclude by expressing my sincere\r\nappreciation to the Vice-Presidents of the General\r\nAssembly for their assistance and cooperation in the\r\nconduct of the work of the general debate. I wish also\r\nto thank the dedicated Secretariat staff, particularly\r\nthose who have worked with me, and to commend them\r\nfor their support and cooperation.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item\r\n9?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.25 p.m.\r\n"
