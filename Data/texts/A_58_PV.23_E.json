Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 16\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and\r\nother elections\r\n(d) Election of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/58/396)\r\nThe President: I should like to draw the attention\r\nof the General Assembly to document A/58/396,\r\ncontaining a note by the Secretary-General, under sub-\r\nitem (d) of agenda item 16, relating to the election of\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\r\nBy its decision 55/310 of 26 October 2000, the\r\nGeneral Assembly, on the proposal of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/55/519), elected Mr. Ruud Lubbers as\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for a\r\nperiod of three years, beginning on 1 January 2001.\r\nBy its resolution 57/186 of 18 December 2002,\r\nthe General Assembly decided to continue the office of\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\nfor a further period of five years from 1 January 2004.\r\nIn conformity with the procedure established by\r\nparagraph 13 of the statute of the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, the\r\nSecretary-General proposes to the General Assembly\r\nthat the term of office of Mr. Ruud Lubbers as United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees be extended\r\nfor a period of two years, beginning on 1 January 2004\r\nand ending on 31 December 2005.\r\nMay I therefore consider that the General\r\nAssembly approves the proposals contained in\r\ndocument A/58/396 and decides to extend the term of\r\noffice of Mr. Ruud Lubbers as United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees for a period of two years,\r\nbeginning on 1 January 2004 and ending on 31\r\nDecember 2005?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I should like, on behalf of the\r\nAssembly, to congratulate Mr. Ruud Lubbers on the\r\nextension of his appointment as United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees.\r\nI give the floor to the representative of China,\r\nwho will make a statement on behalf of the Group of\r\nAsian States.\r\nMr. Xie Bohua (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nAllow me to speak on behalf of the Asian Group.\r\nThe Asian Group supports the proposal made by\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan to extend the term of\r\noffice of Mr. Ruud Lubbers for a period of two years.\r\nSince Mr. Lubbers came into office in 2001, he has\r\ndone a great deal to address the problem of refugees\r\nthroughout the world, and great progress has been\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nmade. We wish to express our appreciation for his\r\nefforts.\r\nThe Asian Group is ready to work closely with\r\nMr. Ruud Lubbers, as well as the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, and will\r\ncontinue its efforts to find a solution to the question of\r\nrefugees worldwide.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Lithuania, who will make a statement\r\non behalf of the Group of Eastern European States.\r\nMr. Šerkšnys (Lithuania): Lithuania, as\r\nChairman of the regional Group of Eastern European\r\nStates for the month of October, has the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of our delegations.\r\nTwenty-one Eastern European States fully\r\nsupport the Secretary-General’s proposal to extend the\r\nterm of office of Mr. Ruud Lubbers as United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees for the next two\r\nyears.\r\nIt is a great pleasure for me to congratulate, on\r\nbehalf of the Group, Mr. Ruud Lubbers on the\r\nextension of his appointment.\r\nI should like to express the Group’s full\r\nsatisfaction at his confirmation by the General\r\nAssembly in this very important post and to assure Mr.\r\nRuud Lubbers of our continuous support for the efforts\r\nof the High Commissioner.\r\nI should like also to express the appreciation of\r\nmy Group of States to the High Commissioner and to\r\nhis staff for their constant attention to the fundamental\r\nprinciples of refugee protection — principles we all\r\nmust strive to implement and to safeguard.\r\nOver the past three years, Mr. Ruud Lubbers has\r\nbeen fully dedicated to the implementation of the\r\ncommon goals of the United Nations in the area of\r\nhuman rights and the rights of refugees. That period\r\nwas marked by a real transformation in the area of the\r\nprotection of human rights and by a shared vision and\r\nconcern on the part of the entire international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe are pleased to underscore that Mr. Ruud\r\nLubbers always stands for the rights of the weakest and\r\nmost vulnerable, sometimes confronting the interests of\r\nthe strong and powerful.\r\nIn our struggle against the new threat of\r\nterrorism, we can always hear Mr. Lubbers’ voice — a\r\nstrong request to observe human rights and protect\r\nhuman beings. The High Commissioner always guards\r\nagainst overly restrictive procedures and practices that\r\nare not consistent with international refugee law. He\r\nworks within a framework comprising international\r\nrefugee, human rights and humanitarian law, and\r\ninternationally accepted standards for the treatment of\r\nrefugees and other persons of concern to the Office of\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR).\r\nThe success of the humanitarian operations\r\ncarried out by UNHCR in order to save the lives of\r\nmillions of refugees and displaced persons has become\r\na matter of critical importance as a prerequisite for\r\npeace and stability.\r\nWe are convinced that, under his leadership, the\r\nwork of UNHCR will continue to be enhanced. The\r\nHigh Commissioner’s initiatives — to strengthen\r\nUNHCR as a multinational institution; the “4-R”\r\nproposal in post-conflict situations — namely\r\nrepatriation, reintegration, rehabilitation and\r\nreconstruction; new approaches to development\r\nthrough local integration; a new agenda for protection;\r\nand UNHCR 2004, or Convention Plus — deserve to\r\nbe implemented.\r\nProtecting refugees and searching for durable\r\nsolutions to their plight is a humanitarian imperative,\r\nbut it is also fundamentally about contributing to\r\ninternational peace and security. Persecution and\r\nconflict produce refugees. At the same time,\r\nunresolved refugee problems can themselves be a cause\r\nof conflict and instability. It is vital, therefore, that the\r\ninternational community support UNHCR in its efforts\r\nto find durable solutions for refugees and other persons\r\nof concern.\r\nFinally, I wish to reiterate our full support and\r\ncooperation to Mr. Ruud Lubbers and to wish him\r\nsuccess in his renewed role as High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Spain, who will make a statement on\r\nbehalf of the Group of Western European and Other\r\nStates.\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nMr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I will be\r\nspeaking on behalf of the Group of Western European\r\nand Other States, which I am chairing this month.\r\nWe would like to express our gratification at the\r\ntwo-year extension of the mandate of the High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees, Mr. Ruud Lubbers.\r\nMr. Lubbers’ term of office began on 1 January\r\n2001, and, for almost three years now, he has deployed,\r\nwith dedication and effectiveness, very commendable\r\nefforts at the head of that United Nations agency,\r\nwhose work is of crucial importance. For this reason,\r\nwe welcome the decision of the Secretary-General and\r\nwe commend him for it. We would convey to Mr. Ruud\r\nLubbers that he can rely on the full cooperation of our\r\ngroup.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of\r\nLatin American and Caribbean States.\r\nMr. Stagno Ugarte (Costa Rica) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I am honoured to take the floor on behalf of\r\nthe Group of Latin American and Caribbean States to\r\nlend our support to the extension Mr. Ruud Lubbers’\r\nterm of office as United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Refugees for a period of two more years.\r\nThis being the first time that I have taken the\r\nfloor before this Assembly, I wish to convey to you and\r\nto the other members of the Bureau our congratulations\r\non your election. We are certain that your known\r\nrecord and experience will make it possible for the\r\nwork of the fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude successfully.\r\nOur region regards the purely humanitarian and\r\napolitical nature of the work of the Office of the High\r\nCommissioner as of crucial importance, as it gives\r\ninternational protection to refugees and tries to find\r\npermanent solutions to their problems. We would recall\r\nthat such a solution would involve, first and foremost,\r\nvoluntary repatriation as the preferred solution. We\r\nknow that there needs to be concerted international\r\naction to help refugees. In this regard, we would assert\r\nthat international protection is a dynamic function,\r\nwhich is action-oriented, carried out in cooperation\r\nwith States and other partners, so as to, among other\r\nthings, promote and facilitate the admission, reception\r\nand treatment of refugees and finding lasting solutions\r\nfor their protection.\r\nThis challenge has been tackled in recent years\r\nthanks to the guiding skills of Mr. Lubbers as he has\r\ncarried out his work, and for this reason we support the\r\nextension of his term in office so that he may continue\r\nhis work concerning international protection and\r\nmaterial assistance to refugees, as well as the quest for\r\npermanent solutions to their problems. The Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean Group will continue to follow\r\nattentively the activities of Mr. Lubbers in his second\r\nterm of office, and we will continue to support him in\r\nhis work.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Rwanda on behalf of the Group of\r\nAfrican States.\r\nMr. Kamanzi (Rwanda) (spoke in French): On\r\nbehalf of the African Group, which we are honoured to\r\nchair for the month of October, I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate Mr. Ruud Lubbers on the\r\nextension of his mandate by the Secretary-General of\r\nthe United Nations for the next two years to head the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees. No one doubts that Mr. Ruud Lubbers will\r\ncontinue to exercise his skills and his personal\r\ncommitment in the service of the international\r\ncommunity to resolve the difficult problems of\r\nrefugees who, on our continent, unfortunately, number\r\nin the thousands. We wish him every success and we\r\nassure him of the total support of Africa.\r\nThe President: The Assembly has thus\r\nconcluded its consideration of sub-item (d) of agenda\r\nitem 16.\r\nAgenda item 60 and agenda item 10 (continued)\r\nFollow up to the outcome of the Millennium\r\nSummit: report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/58/323)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/58/1)\r\nThe President: Members will recall that the\r\nSecretary-General presented his report on the work of\r\nthe Organization to the General Assembly at the 7th\r\nplenary meeting, on 23 September 2003.\r\nMr. Bennouna (Morocco) (spoke in French):\r\nThank you, Mr. President, for giving me the floor at the\r\nopening of this crucial debate being held at the fifty-\r\neighth session on questions of development, in\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nparticular the implementation of the Millennium\r\nSummit. We, in the Group of 77 and China, know that\r\nyou attach great importance to the implementation of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\r\nBefore I get to the substance of this debate, I\r\nwould like to convey our sincere thanks to Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, the Secretary-General, for his well-structured\r\nand very important report presented to us at the\r\nbeginning of this session, which presents the progress\r\nachieved so far in the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Goals and what still needs to be done to\r\nmeet its objectives.\r\nAt a time when the international community was\r\nexpecting an accelerated implementation of the\r\nrespective commitments of Member States in order to\r\nattain the Millennium Development Goals, new threats\r\nhave emerged, unfortunately, which jeopardize the\r\ninternational climate of cooperation and consensus that\r\nis essential for the attainment of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development.\r\nRestoring this atmosphere of international\r\ncooperation and consensus remains, in our view, the\r\nmain objective, and it should guide our collective\r\nmultilateral action in order to preserve the credibility\r\nand increase the effectiveness of our universal\r\nOrganization.\r\nA responsible unreserved commitment on the part\r\nof the international community, particularly of the most\r\ndeveloped countries, within a context of solid and\r\nfruitful cooperation towards sustainable development\r\nfor the benefits of all, remains the vital element that\r\ncan only further strengthen confidence in our United\r\nNations system in these difficult times.\r\nWe have taken note of the considerable progress\r\nmade in the implementation of the Development Goals\r\nenshrined in the Millennium Declaration and by the\r\nmajor United Nations conferences and meetings held\r\nsince the year 2000.\r\nHowever, the prospects for Africa, unfortunately,\r\nremain a source of concern. Indeed, the number of\r\npeople living in extreme poverty is expected to\r\ndecrease in all regions of the world except in Africa,\r\nwhere projected growth rates will not stem the spread\r\nof poverty and thus not attain the objectives of\r\nsustainable development. This development is a\r\nprocess that depends on a number of factors, in\r\nparticular on increased financing for development\r\nthrough debt relief and an increase in official\r\ndevelopment assistance, as well as on the success of\r\ntrade negotiations undertaken by the World Trade\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe agree with Mr. Kofi Annan that strengthened,\r\nbalanced and equitable international trade is one way to\r\nhelp the poorest countries combat hunger and poverty\r\nand to attain the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe Doha Declaration underscored that\r\ndevelopment and the interests of the poorest should be\r\ncentral to trade negotiations. Unfortunately, the\r\nsubsequent discussions at the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) in Geneva did not ensure concrete\r\nfollow-up to the Doha Declaration. The failure of the\r\nCancún negotiations should encourage us to redouble\r\nour efforts, in order to achieve in the near future\r\nsatisfactory results to restore the confidence of\r\ndeveloping countries and to send a positive message to\r\nthe world economy. I talked about the failure at\r\nCancún, but others have also said that the developing\r\ncountries showed great solidarity at Cancún, which\r\nmade it possible not to accept any compromise\r\nproposed.\r\nThe high-level dialogue on financing for\r\ndevelopment, to be held at the end of this month,\r\nshould, as a global mechanism for coordination and\r\nfollow-up, enable us to carry out a coherent\r\nexamination of the implementation of the Monterrey\r\ncommitments and to assess progress made.\r\nThe work done by the United Nations to\r\naccelerate the implementation of the Monterrey\r\nConsensus must be accompanied by increased\r\ncooperation of other stakeholders, including the\r\nBretton Woods financial institutions, the WTO, the\r\nprivate sector and civil society. Sustainable\r\ndevelopment also requires that food security be\r\nguaranteed, as well as adequate health and education\r\nservices.\r\nWe are pleased that the United Nations has made\r\nevery effort to improve access to food and medical care\r\nby encouraging increased international cooperation,\r\nsupported, inter alia, by bilateral and multilateral\r\ndonors, to help the developing countries elaborate,\r\nadapt and strengthen their food security and\r\nagricultural development strategies.\r\nThe endorsement by the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the United Nations system of a\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nsubstantive strategy to attain the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals is a commitment that should help\r\nthe developing countries attain their national priorities.\r\nAs we have said since the beginning of this year,\r\nthroughout our chairmanship of the Group of 77, we\r\nneed to have national and international indicators in\r\norder to assess progress made in the implementation of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. We are in the\r\nprocess of establishing those indicators now.\r\nAgenda 21 and the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation are a set of commitments for\r\nsustainable development. Practical steps clearly need to\r\nbe taken to implement them. That is why this year,\r\nduring the eleventh session of the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development, a multi-year programme was\r\ndrafted, covering the period 2004 to 2017, to preserve\r\nthe momentum created in Johannesburg. The Group of\r\n77 made a very decisive contribution to the elaboration\r\nof this multi-year programme. We hope that that\r\nprogramme will strengthen the implementation process\r\nand follow-up to the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment.\r\nWithin the framework of the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development, a multi-year programme of\r\nwork will make it possible to assess all cross-cutting\r\nissues and questions identified by the Johannesburg\r\nPlan of Implementation, in order to identify gaps in its\r\nimplementation and to take the steps necessary to\r\nremedy them. During the eleventh session of the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development, the Group\r\nof 77 saw to it that that programme of work maintained\r\nthe integrity of the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment and ensured equal treatment of all\r\nthematic modules identified. By adopting this multi-\r\nyear programme of work, the international community\r\nhas what we could call a road map for the\r\nimplementation of sustainable development goals.\r\nAllow me to also recall that water, sanitation and\r\nhousing matters will be examined in depth by the\r\nCommission. We hope that the launching of this multi-\r\nyear programme, through consideration of those\r\nmatters, will be a success, inspire confidence and\r\ndemonstrate the real will to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment goals.\r\nAs Members know, United Nations reform has\r\nprobably been and will be the overriding theme of this\r\nsession. Our group is convinced that reform of the\r\nmultilateral institutions is essential now more than\r\never, so that our Organization can adapt to new\r\nproblems and situations in the world. Reform is not an\r\nend in itself. The point is to increase international\r\ncooperation, and particularly to implement the\r\ncommitments undertaken at the various United Nations\r\nconferences and summits, to enable the developing\r\ncountries, particularly the least developed countries, to\r\nattain the Millennium Development Goals for the\r\neconomic and social well-being of their peoples.\r\nIn June 2003, the Assembly adopted a very\r\nimportant resolution, to which we, together with other\r\ngroups, contributed greatly, to ensure that it would be\r\nadopted. I am referring to the resolution on the\r\nintegrated and coordinated implementation of and\r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits. That text reaffirmed the\r\ndetermination to implement and comply with\r\ncommitments made and to place implementation of\r\ndevelopment goals set by the United Nations at the\r\nvery core of development and cooperation policies. As\r\nMembers know, goal number eight, on means of\r\nimplementation, was recognized as being central to the\r\nimplementation of the first seven goals. With that\r\nresolution we now have a framework at our disposal,\r\nand we must all work together to give it specific\r\ncontents.\r\nThe second essential aspect of the resolution —\r\nwhich was adopted in June — is to provide for the\r\nholding of a world summit on development in 2005. I\r\nthink it is time to begin preparing for the summit right\r\nnow. The Assembly will find total support in the Group\r\nof 77 and China for such preparation. We hope that that\r\nmeeting, which will be very important for billions of\r\npeople, is crowned with success.\r\nIn conclusion, on behalf of our Group, I would\r\nrecall that the United Nations is the bearer of a\r\nuniversal ethical message contained in the purposes\r\nand principles of the Charter that any institutional\r\nreform must maintain and strengthen in order to be\r\nmore effective. That is the challenge we must meet\r\ntogether through concerted, collective action in which\r\nall nations, large and small, must bear their share of\r\nresponsibility so that future generations are saved from\r\nthe scourge of war and the horrors of poverty and\r\nilliteracy.\r\nMr. Spatafora (Italy): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the European Union. The acceding\r\ncountries — Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia\r\nand Slovenia — and the associated countries Bulgaria,\r\nRomania and Turkey align themselves with this\r\nstatement.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his important\r\nand comprehensive report and for his statement in the\r\ngeneral debate. The Millennium Declaration (resolution\r\n55/2) remains central in setting the agenda for our\r\nwork. The European Union is wholeheartedly\r\ncommitted to the principles and objectives it sets out.\r\nWe attach equal importance to all its parts, on, inter\r\nalia, peace and security; development and human\r\nrights; democracy and good governance. The\r\nSecretary-General’s report sets out the progress we\r\nhave made in implementing the Declaration and in\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. It\r\nhighlights new challenges and areas where progress is\r\ninsufficient. It lays down fundamental questions that\r\nwe must address.\r\nThe foundation of the European Union’s approach\r\nis our strong commitment to effective multilateralism\r\nand collective action to address shared global\r\nchallenges. The European security strategy on which\r\nwe are working emphasizes that commitment to\r\neffective multilateralism. We are convinced that the\r\nUnited Nations is, and must remain, the central forum\r\nfor international cooperation and the vital instrument\r\nfor common action at a global level. We therefore\r\naccept our common responsibility to ensure that the\r\nUnited Nations is as effective as it needs to be for the\r\npursuit of those goals. The initiative launched by the\r\nSecretary-General to reform and strengthen the\r\nOrganization is a shared interest and a commitment for\r\nall Member States of the United Nations.\r\nWe call upon all Member States to show political\r\nwill, pragmatism and imagination in this endeavour.\r\nWe must address the crucial challenges that the\r\nSecretary-General has set out and the wider questions\r\nthey raise for the international system. For example, we\r\nrecognize the case for reform of the Security Council,\r\nthe General Assembly and the other principal United\r\nNations organs and mechanisms.\r\nWe know that these issues are complex. Finding\r\nthe right answers calls for intensified and more focused\r\naction. In that respect, we also support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposal to invite eminent personalities to\r\nreview the challenges we face and to consider further\r\nsteps that may be needed to meet them. We look\r\nforward to receiving recommendations from the\r\nSecretary-General in 2004, based on the panel’s work\r\non all aspects of the Millennium Declaration, which he\r\nmentioned in his recent status report.\r\nBut we must not put off until tomorrow what we\r\ncan do today. We must push ahead with action on\r\nreform this year, at the current session of the Assembly.\r\nDuring this session, the General Assembly should\r\naddress in particular the issue of establishing a single-\r\nstage budget review for the United Nations regular\r\nbudget as a follow-up to last year’s reform resolution.\r\nWe strongly applaud the progress already made,\r\nunder the Secretary-General’s leadership, to reform the\r\nSecretariat, United Nations agencies and the\r\noperational activities of the United Nations system. But\r\nthere is still more to do. We will continue to support\r\nthis work. We stand ready to engage actively in the\r\nreform process.\r\nIndeed, Member States themselves must do more\r\nto reform, strengthen and make more effective the\r\nintergovernmental bodies of the United Nations. We\r\nwelcome the initiatives launched by the President to\r\nrevitalize the Assembly. We will strongly support his\r\nefforts. Like him, we want the work of the Assembly to\r\nbe more focused and action- oriented and to achieve\r\ngreater political impact in global debate. As the\r\nPresident has said, it is in our best interests\r\n“to demonstrate by our action that the General\r\nAssembly has not only the capacity but also the\r\npolitical will to constructively address and\r\nresolve the complex problems of the world and to\r\nclose the gap between our agreed objectives and\r\nthe resources needed to implement them.... As\r\nadvocate, supervisor and policy-making body,\r\n[the Assembly] must give the direction necessary\r\nto ensure coherence in the system”... (A/58/PV.7,\r\np. 1)\r\nWhile we welcome recent improvements in the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council — which\r\nshould be further developed — there is a need for a\r\ncomprehensive reform that makes it more\r\nrepresentative, more effective and more democratic. In\r\nthe same spirit, we must strengthen the Economic and\r\nSocial Council’s coordinating role across the United\r\nNations system. To that end, we must act now on the\r\nconclusions of the General Assembly to implement and\r\nfollow up major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits in an integrated manner. In that regard, I fully\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nagree with what was said earlier by the representative\r\nof Morocco, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nWe must further reflect on the proposals and ideas of\r\nthe President of the Economic and Social Council. We\r\nmust consider, among other issues, how to improve\r\ncooperation between the Economic and Social Council\r\nand the Security Council, building further on recent\r\ninitiatives, so as to enhance the coherence and\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations system.\r\nAs we engage in follow-up to the full spectrum of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration, we must recognize that\r\nthese are inter-linked strands of a single agenda. For\r\nexample, development cannot flourish without peace\r\nand security, and vice versa. Indeed, the development\r\nagenda must be better interrelated with conflict\r\nprevention — as well as linked to peace-building — to\r\nsustain economic and social development. Our task is\r\nnot whether to tackle so-called hard or soft threats to\r\nsecurity, but to deal with all of them as effectively as\r\npossible.\r\nIn the sphere of peace and security, the European\r\nUnion will play its full part in achieving more effective\r\nconflict prevention, peacekeeping and peace-building.\r\nWe will work to that end in the United Nations, with\r\nother organizations and with all our partners. We will\r\nact to build upon the Joint Declaration that the\r\nEuropean Union and the United Nations recently\r\nsigned on crisis management.\r\nWe must also address new threats. The\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and\r\nterrorism are fundamental threats to international peace\r\nand security. We fully share the Secretary-General’s\r\nview on the importance of international instruments to\r\naddress that issue, and the necessity of ensuring\r\nuniversal adherence to, and full compliance with, those\r\ninstruments. In this regard, we will continue to\r\nimplement the European Union Action Plan against the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration provides a clear\r\nagenda for development, which was reinforced through\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and the major\r\nUnited Nations Summits of Monterrey and\r\nJohannesburg. We must continue, in a spirit of\r\npartnership, our common drive to implement the goals\r\nand targets set out therein, and to meet the clear\r\ntimetables which we have agreed. The European Union\r\nremains absolutely committed to delivering on its\r\nundertaking in order to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. This will require renewed\r\nefforts — for example, to deal with the terrible scourge\r\nof HIV/AIDS and environmental sustainability, as well\r\nas to reach a successful conclusion to the Doha\r\nDevelopment Round. In this context, Africa will\r\nremain at the heart of the European Union\r\ncommitment. We strongly support the principles and\r\nobjectives of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment.\r\nThe European Union remains fully engaged in its\r\nefforts to fulfil the commitments on financing for\r\ndevelopment made at Monterrey with a view to\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. We look\r\nforward to the high-level dialogue on that issue,\r\nscheduled to take place later this month.\r\nWe must continue with equal vigour to strengthen\r\ndemocracy and the rule of law and to protect human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms. These values are best\r\nguaranteed through effective multilateralism. The\r\nEuropean Union considers that rule-of-law elements\r\nshould be included, as appropriate, in United Nations\r\npeace operations. To this end, we support the\r\nstrengthening of United Nations capacities in the area\r\nof the rule of law. We must make the work of the\r\nUnited Nations as effective as possible by supporting\r\nand strengthening the efforts of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Commission\r\non Human Rights. On behalf of the European Union, I\r\ntake this opportunity to pay tribute once again to the\r\nservice and sacrifice of Sergio Vieira de Mello and the\r\nother United Nations staff members who were killed.\r\nWe must strengthen the focus of all the organs of the\r\nUnited Nations system on the protection of civilians\r\nand children affected by armed conflict and on the\r\nrights of women.\r\nIn conclusion, the matters that I have set out\r\nrepresent an enormous set of challenges to the United\r\nNations and its Member States. Work will proceed on\r\nmany fronts. The European Union will contribute\r\nactively.\r\nWe welcome the concept of a major event in 2005\r\nto review progress and make further decisions. Such an\r\nevent must provide new political impetus to achieve\r\nthe goals set in the Millennium Declaration and at the\r\nmajor United Nations summits. We look to the\r\nSecretary-General to make further proposals to the\r\nAssembly next year on the structure of such an event.\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nIn the meantime, let us push ahead with further\r\naction and reform where there is common ground on\r\nwhich it is possible to build with an incremental\r\napproach. Let us focus on implementing the\r\ncommitments we have all made. Let us stay united in\r\npursuing the ambitious aspirations set out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nMr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French): I\r\nshould like first to convey to you, Mr. President, my\r\nwarm congratulations on your well-deserved election to\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly. We have\r\nevery confidence that, thanks to your experience, skill\r\nand dedication, you will successfully carry out your\r\ndifficult task. You will certainly be able to count on the\r\nfull cooperation of my delegation as you guide our\r\nwork to a successful outcome.\r\nI should also like to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his excellent reports on the work of the\r\nOrganization and on the follow-up to the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, which was adopted in December 2000.\r\nI associate myself with the statement made by the\r\nPermanent Representative of Morocco, who spoke on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThis joint debate gives us the opportunity to\r\nassess what has been done in the Organization’s\r\nvarious areas of activity during the past year and to\r\nconsider the progress made and problems encountered\r\nover the past three years in implementing the\r\ncommitments made under the various headings of the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nA close reading of the two reports and a lucid\r\nanalysis of what has been done and what remains to be\r\ndone lead us to conclude that the need for a strong and\r\neffective Organization is more urgent than ever, as it is\r\nclear that we will not be able to attain the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals unless we manage to conclude the\r\nradical reform that our Organization so sorely needs.\r\nThe scope and diversity of the activities of the\r\nOrganization, exhaustively covered in the two reports,\r\nand the limited time available for this discussion, mean\r\nthat we cannot, of course, cover all those activities in\r\ndepth. We will have an opportunity in the coming\r\nweeks to discuss here in detail some very important\r\nitems, such as the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment, the reform of the United Nations, the\r\ncoordination of humanitarian assistance, the follow-up\r\nto the outcome of the special session on children and\r\nother questions relating to development and to\r\ninternational peace and security. I will therefore\r\nconfine myself to making several preliminary\r\ncomments on one of the most salient aspects of the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the implementation\r\nof the Millennium Declaration — those relating to his\r\ninitiative for radical institutional reform and to his\r\nappeal to each Member State to try to reach agreement\r\non this question as a matter of national priority. That\r\nappeal was reiterated in his statement immediately\r\nbefore the general debate.\r\nThe work undertaken by the United Nations to\r\nmeet the challenges of globalization and attain the\r\nMillennium Development Goals raises the important\r\nquestion of whether its means are commensurate with\r\nits ambitions, and whether its structures, mechanisms\r\nand methods are appropriate for the nature of the\r\nchallenges that the United Nations faces today. That is\r\nan enormous and complex task, because we need to\r\ncontrol the effects of globalization; reduce poverty;\r\nremove inequalities; eradicate diseases, in particular\r\nAIDS; promote economic and social development;\r\navert threats, both old and new, to international peace\r\nand security, in particular terrorism; and resolve other\r\nhumanitarian, environmental and human rights\r\nproblems.\r\nIn this respect, my delegation welcomes the fact\r\nthat the Secretary-General, in his report on the follow-\r\nup to the Millennium Declaration, stated that terrorism\r\nconstitutes a violation of fundamental human rights and\r\nmust be combated as such. Meeting that challenge will\r\nrequire strengthening the international community’s\r\ncollective capacity for action. The United Nations, as\r\nthe only universal global organization, provides an\r\nideal, irreplaceable framework for collective unified\r\naction by the international community as a whole.\r\nNevertheless, more than ever before, it is required to\r\nturn over a new leaf to adapt to the new requirements\r\nof a world in constant change and to finalize in a\r\nresolute and determined manner the process of reform\r\nunder way.\r\nDuring the general debate over the last two\r\nweeks, the overwhelming majority of Member States\r\nrenewed their commitment to multilateralism and\r\nforcefully stressed the need to follow up on the\r\ncommitments contained in section VIII of the\r\nMillennium Declaration covering the strengthening of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nThe effective implementation of reforms is\r\nessential if we want the United Nations to become a\r\nmore efficient, consistent, dynamic organization that\r\nwill continue to play the role of catalyst for change and\r\nserve as a forum for dialogue and specific action.\r\nThe climate of cooperation and consensus that\r\nprevailed following the tragic terrorist attacks of 11\r\nSeptember 2001 has unfortunately been gravely\r\njeopardized by the crisis experienced by our\r\nOrganization at the beginning of this year. Profound\r\ndivisions within the international community have\r\nindeed been created, which have cast doubt on the\r\neffectiveness, usefulness and credibility of the\r\ncollective security system as defined by the Charter.\r\nHowever, we have every hope, now that the Security\r\nCouncil seems to have regained its unanimity and unity\r\nof vision and that the central role of the United Nations\r\nin post-war Iraq is not merely recognized but desired\r\nby everyone, that the United Nations will emerge\r\nstrengthened from the trial that it has endured.\r\nAccordingly, we agree with the idea put forward\r\nby the Secretary-General in his report on the follow-up\r\nto the Millennium Declaration that the great strength of\r\nthe Organization lies in its legitimacy, anchored in the\r\nfundamental principles of international law accepted by\r\nall States and expressed by the international\r\ncommunity as a whole.\r\nMultilateralism, of which the United Nations\r\nsystem is the basis, must be preserved and strengthened\r\nif we want international affairs to be effectively and\r\ncredibly managed. Accordingly, we believe that the\r\ndecisions of the Security Council would enjoy greater\r\nsupport if the organ were perceived as being more\r\nrepresentative. An expanded and reformed Security\r\nCouncil would be in a better position to increase\r\nconfidence between it and other members of the\r\ninternational community, which would see that their\r\ninterests were duly represented by the members of the\r\nCouncil, and its decisions would thus be more\r\nrigorously complied with. After the long repetitive\r\ndebates that we have heard for the last 10 years about\r\nthe reform of the Security Council, which,\r\nunfortunately, have been inconclusive, the time has\r\ncome, as the Secretary-General has suggested, to place\r\nthis debate within the context of radical reform that\r\nwould also encompass the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council, or, better\r\nstill, of the role of the United Nations as a whole in the\r\narea of economic and social affairs and its relationship\r\nwith the Bretton Woods institutions, and take a new\r\nlook at the role of the Trusteeship Council in the light\r\nof new types of responsibility conferred on the United\r\nNations by Member States in recent years.\r\nWe share the analysis and understand the motives\r\nbehind that approach and my delegation can only\r\nwelcome this initiative at this stage. It is, however,\r\nimportant to stress that the mechanism proposed to\r\nestablish a panel of eminent personalities to study this\r\nimportant and sensitive question and make\r\nrecommendations for radical institutional reforms\r\nshould meet a number of conditions so that this panel\r\nmay enjoy the trust and support of all Member States.\r\nFirst of all, the choice of these eminent personalities\r\nmust reflect the broadest possible geographical\r\nrepresentation and meet the necessary conditions of\r\nintegrity, competence and neutrality.\r\nIn this vein, an in-depth knowledge of the\r\nOrganization and the way it functions is an essential\r\nrequirement that should not be minimized or ignored.\r\nIn one way or another, Member States should also be\r\ninvolved in defining the mandate and consulted and\r\ninvited by members of the panel to give their views, on\r\nthe understanding that, in any case, the report of the\r\nSecretary-General containing the conclusions and\r\nrecommendations of the panel will be submitted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly for consideration and decision.\r\nThese are essential conditions if we wish to abide\r\nby the procedures in force and the relevant established\r\npractices of the Organization. These conditions would\r\nonly strengthen the credibility of the panel and help it\r\nto enjoy support from Member States.\r\nMr. De Rivero (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): As\r\ncoordinator of the Rio Group, I would like to make this\r\nstatement on behalf of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil,\r\nEcuador, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, El Salvador,\r\nGuatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua,\r\nParaguay, Panama, Peru, Dominican Republic,\r\nUruguay and Venezuela, which are all member States\r\nof the principal mechanism of political coordination in\r\nLatin America.\r\nWe would like to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his candid report on the implementation of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration. The Rio Group shares his\r\ndiagnosis, concerns and proposals.\r\nThe Rio Group is firmly convinced that the\r\ninternational order, which must prevail in the world,\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nneeds to be based on multilateralism and respect for the\r\ninternational law. It is imperative to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations system and to consolidate clear and\r\nconsistent legal norms that allow us to act with vigour,\r\nefficiency and legitimacy to confront the threats and\r\nchallenges in the areas of peace, international security\r\nand development.\r\nIn this regard, we are in complete agreement with\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report. First, there is a need for\r\nprompt and urgent reform of the Organization. This\r\nreform must be based on the universal values of the\r\nSan Francisco Charter, which are still in force, and\r\nmust be focused principally on the main organs of the\r\nOrganization and their interrelationships. The reform of\r\nthe Security Council must be based on its composition,\r\nprocess of decision-making and working methods.\r\nThe General Assembly requires an immediate\r\nreorganization of its working methods and work\r\nprogramme. In this manner, as the most democratic\r\norgan of the system, it can restore its central role as a\r\nuniversal and political forum for addressing the\r\nimportant issues and concerns of the international\r\ncommunity, in relation to either international peace and\r\nsecurity or economic and social development.\r\nFurthermore, we must ensure that its decisions are\r\ncomplied with.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council requires\r\nrationalization and greater scope of activity to work\r\neffectively to promote development and inclusive\r\nglobalization. As the Secretary-General has said, this\r\nrequires us to rethink the relationship between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions as\r\nwell as to attain greater participation of the developing\r\ncountries in the international economic decision-\r\nmaking process. The Secretariat must continue to\r\nimprove its management, accountability and its\r\nrelationships with Member States. Along with all of\r\nthis, we need to insure better coordination among the\r\nvarious organs.\r\nSecondly, the Rio Group also subscribes to the\r\nproposal that greater interaction should be achieved\r\nbetween the United Nations and civil society, and\r\nespecially non-governmental organizations and the\r\nprivate sector. The United Nations cannot turn its back\r\non these new actors which are increasingly important\r\nin the international system and which have an ever\r\nweightier influence on the development of our\r\ncountries. We therefore look forward with interest to\r\nthe recommendations of the high level panel set up by\r\nthe Secretary-General to review relations between the\r\nUnited Nations and civil society.\r\nThirdly, the Rio Group notes with concern the\r\npoint made by the Secretary-General in his report, to\r\nthe effect that in the area of human rights and\r\ndemocracy, there is a danger that we may lose sight of\r\nsome of the important achievements of the last decade.\r\nThe Rio Group would appeal to all States to work\r\nharder to promote democracy and unreserved respect\r\nfor human rights.\r\nFourthly, the Rio Group believes that the agenda\r\nand concerns in the area of international peace and\r\nsecurity should not overshadow the great challenges\r\nthat we face in the area of sustainable development, or\r\nrelegate them to a secondary level.\r\nThe international community has not just the\r\nresponsibility, but also the obligation to act with\r\ndetermination in response to the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, illicit trafficking in small\r\narms and light weapons, terrorism, international crime\r\nand drug trafficking and in striving to overcome the\r\ninequities that have been emerging in the struggle to\r\ncombat these and other contemporary threats.\r\nNevertheless, the international community has\r\nalso the political and moral obligation to firmly tackle\r\npoverty, whether in the form of deprivation, social\r\nexclusion or unemployment. We must not forget that\r\ndestitution, hunger and poverty are the cause of many\r\nof the current crises.\r\nThe Rio Group is committed to fulfilling the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Nevertheless, it is\r\nconcerned that there has been scant progress or even a\r\nstep backwards in the area of such crucial objectives as\r\nthe reduction of poverty. The industrialized countries\r\nas well as the developing countries have the\r\nresponsibility to fulfil our commitment to attain these\r\ngoals and we need to renew our efforts towards this\r\npurpose.\r\nThe industrialized countries must fulfil their\r\ncommitments in the area of cooperation for\r\ndevelopment, as well as those regarding higher levels\r\nof national or foreign public and private investment, so\r\nthat Latin American and other developing countries\r\nmay achieve sustained growth sufficient to reduce\r\npoverty and create employment. It is indispensable\r\ntowards that goal and in the advance towards fulfilment\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nof the Doha agenda, to liberalize the mechanisms of\r\ntechnology transfer and to give effect to the Monterrey\r\nconsensus.\r\nIn May of this year in Cuzco, the Presidents of\r\nthe States members of the Rio Group agreed that the\r\ntime had come to introduce innovative financial\r\nmechanisms to support the efforts of our countries in\r\nthe strengthening of democratic governance and\r\nreduction of poverty, paying immediate attention to the\r\nsocial demands of employment and better incomes,\r\nwhile making it possible to achieve sustainable\r\neconomic and social growth.\r\nExperts from the Rio Group have provided\r\nspecific proposals that will be reviewed shortly by our\r\nministers of economy and finance. These initiatives\r\ninclude, among others, the creation of regional\r\nauthorities to govern investment in infrastructure,\r\nbetter fiscal management through the reformulation of\r\nthe fiscal goals, the reduction of debt cost by designing\r\nnew debt instruments such as indexed bonds, and the\r\ncreation of a regional trusteeship in Latin America for\r\nprivate investment in the development of public\r\ninfrastructure.\r\nThe Rio Group believes that the establishment of\r\nsuch innovative financial mechanisms deserves the\r\nmost serious attention on the part of the international\r\ncommunity, in particular by the industrialized\r\ncountries, as well as the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme and the regional and international financial\r\ninstitutions.\r\nAllow me to conclude by stating that the Rio\r\nGroup accepts the challenge of the Secretary-General\r\nto achieve by 2005 a radical reform of the United\r\nNations and to proceed to evaluate at the highest\r\npolitical level, the progress made, the ground lost, and\r\nthe inadequacies that we see in the implementation of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration.\r\nMr. Hosseinian (Iran): I would like to join the\r\nprevious speakers in thanking the Secretary-General\r\nfor his reports on the items and his address in the\r\ngeneral debate.\r\nAllow me to pay special tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his firm leadership of the Organization and\r\nhis continuing interest in the search for practical and\r\ninnovative solutions. In this context, we welcome his\r\nproposal to invite a group of eminent persons to study\r\nthe challenges before the Organization and propose\r\ninnovative responses to them. We are confident that the\r\ncomposition and leadership of the group will truly\r\nreflect the membership of the Organization.\r\nWe fully agree with the Secretary-General that in\r\nthe area of peace and security, last year was a trying\r\nyear for the United Nations; the war in Iraq severely\r\ntested the principle of collective security and the\r\nresilience of the Organization. Indeed, maybe never\r\nsince its creation has the relevance of the United\r\nNations been so openly challenged and its usefulness\r\nquestioned. The challenge, in turn, even gave rise to\r\ndire forecasts depicting the Organization as moribund\r\nand about to suffer the same fate as that of the League\r\nof Nations.\r\nLater developments in Iraq have clearly\r\ndemonstrated that the United Nations was right in\r\nresisting and opposing the unilateral and unsanctioned\r\ninvasion of a Member State. In his opening statement\r\nto the General Assembly last month, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral was more explicit in pointing to the unilateral\r\nand pre-emptive use of force as a fundamental\r\nchallenge to the principles on which, however\r\nimperfectly, world peace and stability have rested for\r\nthe last 58 years.\r\nNow there is an absolute need to remedy the\r\ndamage done to the integrity of the rule of law at the\r\ninternational level. Recognition of the central role of\r\nthe United Nations in the rapid transfer of sovereignty\r\nto the Iraqi people would constitute the first necessary\r\nstep.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that,\r\n“Whatever view each of us may take of the events of\r\nrecent months, it is vital to all of us that the outcome is\r\na stable and democratic Iraq at peace with itself and\r\nwith its neighbours, and contributing to stability in the\r\nregion.” (A/58/PV.7, p. 2)\r\nMy delegation has noted the reference of the\r\nSecretary-General to terrorism and the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction as issues that remained of\r\ngreat concern during the past year. Regarding\r\nterrorism, we are pleased that he emphasized in his\r\nreport the need for taking into account root causes such\r\nas poverty and grievances over injustice in strategies\r\naimed at reducing the incidence of terrorist acts. We\r\nfully agree that, to maintain together a genuinely global\r\ncoalition against terrorism, the world will need to see\r\nprogress on other fronts of the struggle for a humane\r\nand just world.\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nRegarding weapons of mass destruction, the\r\nSecretary-General rightly refers to the concern of the\r\ninternational community on the risks of the\r\ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction and their\r\npossible use by State or non-State actors. As suggested,\r\nthe only powerful and legitimate tool continues to be\r\nuniversal adherence to, and effective compliance with,\r\nnegotiated multilateral agreements. In that respect,\r\nuniversality of instruments on the elimination and the\r\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention, the Biological\r\nWeapons Convention and, particularly, the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is yet to be\r\nachieved.\r\nOur collective views on the follow up to the\r\noutcome of the Millennium Summit have already been\r\npresented by the Permanent Representative of\r\nMorocco, who spoke on behalf of the G-77 and China.\r\nAllow me to simply highlight a couple of points.\r\nThe momentum that was generated after the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment for at least partial fulfilment of the\r\ncommitments by the international community seems to\r\nbe dying down. That will shatter the prospects for\r\nmeeting the Millennium Development Goals in general\r\nand building a global partnership for development in\r\nparticular. The recent Cancún Conference, that dealt\r\nwith one of the most important components of that\r\npartnership, with its inability to produce the favourable\r\nresult, as well as lack of progress on reform of\r\ninternational financial institutions, once again requires\r\nus to pay urgent and critical attention to the insufficient\r\nvoice of developing countries in trade, financial and\r\nmonetary institutions, as well as the imperative that\r\ntheir structures should be reformed in favour of\r\ndemocratic participation of those countries. The United\r\nNations should continue to lead the efforts towards\r\nachieving that objective.\r\nFinally, my delegation has noted the efforts cited\r\nin the report towards achieving greater consistency of\r\npractices on common support services, improving\r\nhuman resource management, including the expansion\r\nof learning and career support programmes, sustaining\r\npositive financial trends of the last two years and\r\nenhancing accountability, monitoring, evaluation and\r\naudit. Such collective endeavours are expected to\r\nincrease efficiency within the Organization.\r\nMoreover, the report on the agenda for further\r\nchange submitted by the Secretary-General provided\r\nMember States with the opportunity to review results\r\nof the reform process so far and to examine the new\r\nproposals.\r\nWhile reaffirming that strengthening the\r\nefficiency of the United Nations and its centrality in\r\nthe international arena is essential to respond to current\r\nand future challenges and opportunities, we believe\r\nthat further constructive debate among all Member\r\nStates is imperative to ensure that their demands,\r\nconcerns and priorities, particularly those of\r\ndeveloping countries, are duly addressed.\r\nMr. Aboul-Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nwish, at the outset, to sincerely congratulate the\r\nPresident on his election to preside over the fifty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly. I wish him\r\nevery success as he conducts the work of this session\r\nof the Assembly at this important time.\r\nThe Secretary-General was absolutely right when\r\nhe stated in the introduction of his report on the work\r\nof the Organization (A/58/1) for the past year that there\r\nwere dim prospects and predictions for the future of\r\nthis international Organization, a prognosis stemming\r\nfrom the crises facing the world in 2003. Hence, there\r\nis a need to examine closely ways that would help this\r\nOrganization tackle existing challenges.\r\nNotwithstanding the numerous points that the Egyptian\r\ndelegation would like to address and comment on, I\r\nwish to raise the point made in the two reports\r\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General. We believe that\r\nthe vision of the Secretary-General, contained in his\r\nreport on the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, and the main elements of proposed reform\r\nthat make up that vision, merit our attention.\r\nThe United Nations is an Organization for all\r\nStates, large or small. It must meet the needs of the\r\ninternational community and tackle existing\r\nchallenges, while taking into consideration the\r\ndiversity factor inherent in the United Nations system\r\nat all levels; hence the need for sufficient flexibility in\r\nthe system to take all differences into account.\r\nThe general debate of the fifty-eighth session\r\nreflected a broad consensus on the need to reform the\r\nUnited Nations system in all its aspects, be that from\r\nan institutional or administrative perspective. The call\r\nto reform is based on an important assumption, which\r\nis that the United Nations has never faced a challenge\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nlike the one it faces today. It is a challenge to the core\r\nprinciples of the Organization. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral himself said in his statement on 23 September\r\n2003, it is a challenge that relates to the unilateral right\r\nto use force preventively or pre-emptively, even at the\r\nrisk of going beyond the legal framework of the\r\ninternational Organization.\r\nAccordingly, this new concept and approach\r\nadvanced by some and pointed to by others regarding\r\nthe need to introduce modifications to the multilateral\r\ninternational system so that the system can take\r\npreventive or pre-emptive measures, is a philosophical\r\nidea that the whole international community should\r\ncarefully consider in depth before embarking on any\r\ntype of reform or change. The Secretary-General, in his\r\naddress on 23 September, proposed setting up a high-\r\nlevel panel of eminent personalities to be entrusted\r\nwith four tasks. That panel would then submit a report\r\nto the Secretary-General before the beginning of the\r\nfifty-ninth session of the General Assembly and the\r\nSecretary-General would present his recommendations\r\nto the General Assembly at that session.\r\nEgypt supports the Secretary-General’s proposal\r\nand reaffirms a number of points: first, the panel needs\r\nto represent a broad gamut of opinion that would\r\nreflect the diversity of international multilateral\r\nsystems, from the standpoint of culture, needs and\r\ngeographical diversity. Secondly, the terms of reference\r\nand jurisdiction of the panel should reflect the\r\nintergovernmental nature of the United Nations.\r\nThirdly, there are already initiatives in existence that\r\nhave presented various ideas about the need to make\r\ninstitutional reforms in the United Nations — I am\r\nthinking in particular of the ideas of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral himself presented in 1997 and 1999\r\nconcerning what is called humanitarian intervention,\r\nnamely the right of the international community to\r\nprovide protection in the case of human rights\r\nviolations. Given the link between the concepts of\r\nState sovereignty and stability and these previous\r\ninitiatives, it seems important that the proposed panel\r\nshould take into consideration the efforts already made\r\nin this area. It should also be guided by the conclusions\r\nthat have emerged from international committees that\r\nhave already examined in depth these concepts,\r\npossibilities for applying them and their potential\r\nshortcomings. Fourthly, we must not prevent States,\r\ngeographical groups or various negotiating group from\r\npresenting their proposals on this vital subject.\r\nTherefore, right from the start of this panel’s\r\nwork, there must be communication between the panel\r\nand the General Assembly so that the results of the\r\ndiscussion held at the current session can be conveyed\r\nto that panel, thus supplementing and crystallizing their\r\nideas and preventing an undue waste of time. Of\r\ncourse, the President of the General Assembly could\r\nplay a vital and crucial role in this respect. Thus I\r\npropose that the General Assembly, at this session,\r\nadopt a brief resolution that would support the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal to create this panel, while\r\nrestating the vision and the consensus of this Assembly\r\nconcerning the need for reform.\r\nWe have before us now a large number of\r\nproposed reforms — proposals that have already been\r\nput forward and that have not been sufficiently\r\ndebated. There are also proposals that will come before\r\nus in the course of this session. The issue of reform is\r\nimportant and is a matter of concern for all of us.\r\nConsequently, this issue needs to be addressed in a\r\ncomprehensive fashion, in the form of proposals in all\r\nareas and with the participation of everyone in\r\ndiscussing, endorsing or adopting some of these\r\nproposals. We have a single objective here: we must\r\npromote, develop and adapt the international\r\nmultilateral system so as to enable it to tackle all\r\nchallenges, not just some of them. Reform does not\r\nnecessarily mean change, just as change does not\r\nnecessarily mean reform. We need to be fully aware of\r\nthat.\r\nIn conclusion, we have great hopes that this\r\ndiscussion will bring about results acceptable to all. We\r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s proposal of\r\nconvening a high-level dialogue in 2005 regarding the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration and we\r\nhope that everyone will fully participate on the subject\r\nof this reform.\r\nMr. Akinsanya (Nigeria): I wish to express the\r\nappreciation of the Nigerian delegation to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his report on\r\nthe work of the Organization, as contained in document\r\nA/58/1. We also commend the statement that the\r\nSecretary-General made at the beginning of this\r\nsession, a statement that was thought-provoking and in\r\nwhich he has made forward-looking proposals for the\r\nreform of our Organization.\r\nMy delegation also associates itself with the\r\nstatement made by the distinguished representative of\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nthe Kingdom of Morocco, on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report discusses some of\r\nthe most pressing issues confronting humanity —\r\nissues of terrorism, conflict situation, natural disasters,\r\nhuman rights, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, poverty and\r\nsustainable development. The report not only reviews\r\nthe considerable efforts of our Organization to seek\r\nconstructive and lasting solutions to these fundamental\r\nproblems, but also recognizes the complexities of the\r\ntask confronting the international community.\r\nIt is a matter of great concern that, in spite of\r\ncontinued efforts towards the achievement of\r\ninternational peace and security, conflicts and wars still\r\nremain some of the greatest challenges facing our\r\nOrganization. Nigeria commends the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations, through the Security Council, in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. While\r\nsome remarkable successes have been made in this\r\nregard, a lot still needs to be done to usher in durable\r\npeace and stability to conflict ravaged areas of the\r\nworld.\r\nWe commend the continued efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General in his use of preventive diplomacy,\r\npeacemaking, peacekeeping and peace-building in the\r\ndischarge of his responsibilities. To some extent, we\r\ncan say that the objectives of our Millennium\r\nDeclaration related to conflict resolution have been\r\nmet. For instance, there has been a decline in the\r\nnumber of conflicts and a significant increase in the\r\nnumber of peace agreements, especially in Africa. We\r\ntherefore commend the adoption by the United Nations\r\nof a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach at\r\nconflict prevention and resolution.\r\nIn compliance with the Millennium Declaration\r\nand consistent with the Charter of the United Nations,\r\nregional organizations, with the assistance of the\r\nUnited Nations, are becoming more focused and\r\nproactive in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity through the establishment of institutional\r\ncooperation for conflict prevention, management and\r\nresolution. In West Africa, for example, the\r\nestablishment by the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) of the Mechanism for\r\nConflict Prevention, Management, Resolution,\r\nPeacekeeping and Security, as well as such\r\ncomplimentary institutions as the ECOWAS\r\nParliament, Council of Elders and the Mano River\r\nWomen’s Peace Network, are all efforts aimed at\r\ninstitutionalizing our conflict prevention strategy. In\r\nthat regard, the United Nations — in active\r\ncollaboration with ECOWAS and Mano River Union\r\ncountries — is continuing to participate in addressing\r\nthe complex humanitarian, political and security\r\nsituations affecting Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and,\r\nrecently, Guinea-Bissau.\r\nWe commend the continued support of the United\r\nNations for the ECOWAS initiative to promote peace,\r\nparticularly in Liberia and other countries of the Mano\r\nRiver Union, in the belief that without such dialogue,\r\nefforts to address the root causes of the subregion’s\r\nproblems will not yield the desired results. Specifically,\r\nwith the deployment of its vanguard force, ECOWAS\r\nhas taken the lead role in the restoration of normalcy in\r\nLiberia. We also commend the efforts of the United\r\nNations in adopting resolution 1509 (2003). We pledge\r\nour support for that resolution, which effectively\r\nestablishes the United Nations Mission in Liberia\r\n(UNMIL), and urge the international community to\r\nextend financial resources and logistical support to\r\nECOWAS in order to enhance peace efforts. We also\r\nnote with satisfaction the United Nations active\r\ninvolvement in peace operations in many parts of the\r\nworld, including Afghanistan, Côte d’Ivoire, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone and\r\nTimor Leste.\r\nAs the world marks the second anniversary of the\r\ntragic events of 11 September 2001, Nigeria reaffirms\r\nits condemnation of international terrorism. While we\r\nsupport the Secretary-General’s view that human rights\r\nmust not be sacrificed in the struggle against\r\ninternational terrorism, we also believe that poverty\r\nand grievances over injustices are also intrinsically\r\nlinked to terrorism. We pledge our cooperation with\r\nother members of the international community, through\r\nbilateral and multilateral efforts, to combat that menace\r\nin all its forms.\r\nAs the President of Nigeria, His Excellency Chief\r\nOlusegun Obasanjo, said in his statement to the\r\nGeneral Assembly on 23 September, Nigeria condemns\r\nthe recent terrorist attack on the office of the United\r\nNations Assistance Mission in Iraq. We also stress our\r\nsupport for Security Council resolution 1502 (2003),\r\non the protection of civilians and United Nations and\r\nhumanitarian personnel in conflict zones. We also\r\ncondemn all acts of terrorism in the strongest terms,\r\nand urge firm action by all members of the\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\ninternational community to deny support of any kind to\r\nterrorists and their cohorts.\r\nThe illicit trade and transfer of small arms and\r\nlight weapons continues to be a cause of concern to the\r\ninternational community, and to developing countries\r\nin particular, as it contributes to conflicts and political\r\ninstability. The excessive accumulation and easy\r\navailability of small arms and light weapons hinders\r\npeace-building and development efforts and threaten\r\nhuman security. In that regard, the ECOWAS\r\nMoratorium on the Importation, Exportation and\r\nManufacture of Small Arms and Light Weapons in\r\nWest Africa has been a useful mechanism for a\r\ncoordinated and sustainable regional approach in\r\ncontrolling that menace.\r\nNigeria reaffirms its commitment to the\r\nProgramme of Action adopted by the United Nations\r\nfirst Biennial Meeting of States to Consider the\r\nImplementation of the Programme of Action to\r\nPrevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects,\r\nwhich was held in July 2003. We urge the international\r\ncommunity to control the movement of those weapons,\r\nespecially to non-State actors. We also call for the\r\nelaboration of a legally binding international\r\ninstrument to combat illegal trafficking.\r\nWhile we note the progressive decrease in the\r\nproduction and transfer of landmines, it is regrettable\r\nthat landmines continue to impede the development\r\nand security of populations, especially in some African\r\nStates emerging from conflict. We should therefore\r\nstrengthen our support for the United Nations mine\r\naction, as it is the only way to curb the menace of\r\nlandmines.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to pose a\r\ngrave challenge to our efforts at development. We\r\nappreciate the efforts of the United Nations and the\r\ncontribution of the international community in\r\ncombating the HIV/AIDS scourge, particularly in\r\nAfrica. We also endorse the African Union’s plan of\r\naction, adopted at its special summit of African leaders,\r\nto intensify their efforts and mobilize resources for the\r\nprevention of the disease and for the care and treatment\r\nof people infected by it.\r\nNigeria commends the Secretary-General for the\r\nestablishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, which is aimed at mobilizing\r\nthe necessary finances to address the AIDS epidemic.\r\nWe call on the international community to demonstrate\r\nfirm commitment to contribute generously to the Fund.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration resolved to eliminate\r\npoverty by launching a sustained campaign to make the\r\nright to development a reality for all. In order to reduce\r\npoverty and promote development, it is essential to\r\nachieve sustained and broad-based economic growth.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals highlighted\r\npriority areas that must be addressed, including\r\ncommitments made by developed nations, such as\r\nincreased official development assistance, flows of\r\nforeign direct investment and improved market access\r\nfor exports from developing countries. We therefore\r\nbelieve that if the international community is to meet\r\nits development and poverty-eradication goals,\r\ndeliberate efforts should be made to accelerate\r\neconomic growth in developing countries.\r\nIn addition, given the breakdown of the\r\nnegotiations of the World Trade Organization at\r\nCancún, Nigeria believes that practical efforts must\r\nalso be made to put the Cancún process back on track,\r\nwith renewed commitments from capitals and political\r\nwill to break the deadlock.\r\nThrough the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), African countries have\r\naccepted responsibility for their own social and\r\neconomic development. We acknowledge the\r\nimportance of sound national policies and good\r\ngovernance as prerequisites for poverty reduction and\r\nsustained socio-economic development. We therefore\r\nwelcome the fulsome support for NEPAD, contained in\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 57/300, of 2002. We also\r\nurge that the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa,\r\nwhich was created to ensure a coherent and integrated\r\napproach by the United Nations, be adequately funded\r\nto enable it to discharge its responsibility credibly.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations and other\r\nsources of international law have established\r\nconditions under which justice and respect for the\r\nobligations arising from treaties can be maintained.\r\nThe rule of law is becoming more widely accepted, and\r\nStates are increasingly employing treaties to regulate\r\ntheir relations.\r\nIn conclusion, Nigeria is pleased to note that the\r\nSecretary-General has made commendable efforts\r\ntowards strengthening the effectiveness of the\r\nOrganization. We are satisfied with the various\r\ninitiatives that have been put in place, and pledge our\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\ncontinued cooperation in his efforts to strengthen the\r\nOrganization.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): Let me begin by\r\nassociating myself with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Morocco, on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China.\r\nWhen the bomb went off at the United Nations\r\noffices in Baghdad on 19 August 2003, it not only\r\nshattered the lives of our dear colleagues, it also\r\nmarked the end of innocence for the Organization,\r\nwhich for nearly six decades had regarded itself as a\r\nuniversally accepted and neutral actor. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral described the attack as “a direct challenge to\r\nthe vision of global solidarity and collective security\r\nrooted in the Charter of the United Nations and\r\narticulated in the Millennium Declaration.” (A/58/323,\r\npara. 2). That makes the debate on the report\r\n(A/58/323) on the implementation of the United\r\nNations Millennium Declaration perhaps one of the\r\nmost important debates to be held in a long time. We\r\nthank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for presenting us\r\nwith such a bold, candid and challenging report that\r\nallows us to engage the urgent issues that face the\r\nOrganization.\r\nIt is also heartening that the heads of State and\r\nGovernment, ministers and other high-level officials\r\nwho participated in the general debate overwhelmingly\r\nspoke of the challenge that the United Nations faces at\r\nthe dawn of the twenty-first century, and that they\r\nsupported the Secretary-General’s intention to focus on\r\nthe reform of the United Nations.\r\nIn his statement during the general debate,\r\nPresident Mbeki said that recent dramatic events have\r\n“raised important and disturbing questions about\r\nthe very future of the United Nations. Central\r\namong them is the question, does the United\r\nNations have a future as a strong and effective\r\nmultilateral organization enjoying the confidence\r\nof the peoples of the world and capable of\r\naddressing the matters that are of concern to all\r\nhumanity?” (A/58/PV.7, p. 23)\r\nPresident Mbeki also stated that\r\n“there is no way in which we could advance the\r\ninterests of the people, the majority of whom are\r\npoor, outside the context of a strong, effective\r\nand popularly accepted United Nations”. (ibid,\r\np. 24)\r\nMy Government welcomes the intention of the\r\nSecretary-General to appoint a panel of eminent\r\npersons to formulate recommendations aimed at\r\nimproving the overall effectiveness and eventual\r\ntransformation of the United Nations. We agree with\r\nthe Secretary-General that the panel should look at the\r\nrelationship among the major bodies of the United\r\nNations, including the General Assembly, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Security Council.\r\nIn that process the importance of the General Assembly\r\nas the main decision-making body of the United\r\nNations, in which all Member States participate\r\nequally, needs to be enhanced. It is equally important\r\nthat the relationship between the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the United Nations should form part of\r\nthat review.\r\nEverything we do in the United Nations is\r\npremised on the common values that were reaffirmed\r\nin the Millennium Declaration, namely, freedom,\r\nequality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for nature and\r\nshared responsibility. While we continue to work on\r\nthe implementation of our socio-economic goals,\r\nrespect for human dignity remains central to our\r\ncommon objectives. As an institution we have to\r\nembody the highest aspirations of human rights,\r\ndemocracy and good governance.\r\nWhile South Africa remains fully committed to\r\ncombating terrorism in all its manifestations, we\r\nbelieve that human rights should not be sacrificed for\r\nshort-term goals in the fight against terrorism. We have\r\nto take into consideration the unintended consequences\r\nthe fight against terrorism may have. In referring to\r\nterrorism, the Secretary-General has noted that\r\n“in fighting against it, we run the risk of\r\nsacrificing a great deal in terms of human rights,\r\ndemocracy and good governance. Tolerance is too\r\noften the first casualty of a ‘war on terror’, which\r\nis widely perceived, especially by Muslims, as a\r\nwar against Islam. To go down that path would\r\nhand the terrorists a victory beyond their\r\ndreams”. (A/58/323, para. 75)\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration heads of State and\r\nGovernment stated that\r\n“the central challenge we face today is to ensure\r\nthat globalization becomes a positive force for all\r\nthe world’s people”. (resolution 55/2, para. 5)\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nThe United Nations has done its best to try to\r\nmitigate the effects of globalization. Two of the most\r\nrecent United Nations meetings have provided the\r\ninternational community with a platform to address\r\nthose global challenges. The International Conference\r\non Financing for Development led to the Monterrey\r\nConsensus, which presented the international\r\ncommunity with a new framework for cooperation. The\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development resulted in\r\nthe Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, which\r\naddresses fundamental issues of underdevelopment,\r\nsuch as clean water, basic sanitation and protection of\r\nthe environment. The outcomes of those conferences\r\nform part of the broader effort to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. However, as the\r\nSecretary-General states in his report, the progress\r\ntowards achieving the overarching goal of halving\r\npoverty by 2015 will require greater commitment from\r\nthe international community.\r\nThe march towards the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals will be a long and\r\narduous one, with numerous obstacles. Developing\r\ncountries will need the support of, and partnership\r\nwith, developed countries, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the United Nations system. The New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development is already in\r\nplace to promote such partnerships. In the Millennium\r\nDeclaration the special needs of Africa were\r\nhighlighted for that particular reason. We hope that the\r\nconcerns of Africa will continue to be considered\r\nintegral to the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nThe outcome of the Ministerial Meeting of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization held recently in Cancún,\r\nMexico, underlined the need for an open, fair and\r\nrules-based multilateral trading system. It is now\r\nevident that the inability of the international\r\ncommunity to address the concerns of developing\r\ncountries will lead to increased poverty and make it\r\neven harder to achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria\r\npandemic continues to devastate the African continent.\r\nAs a country and as a region, our heads of State and\r\nGovernment have on numerous occasions expressed\r\nand reaffirmed their commitment to combating those\r\ncommunicable diseases in all their manifestations.\r\nDuring the recent high-level meetings devoted to the\r\nimplementation of the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS, numerous States, including South Africa,\r\nreported significant examples of real implementation of\r\nthe targets agreed to in the outcome document.\r\nThe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\r\nMalaria has rapidly developed into an effective\r\nmultilateral institution able to allocate large additional\r\nresources to projects directed to fight against those\r\ndiseases of poverty. Thus far, the Fund has managed to\r\ndisburse funds to public and private partners,\r\nparticularly in developing countries, in support of\r\nprevention and treatment programmes. However, while\r\ncontributions by major foundations, private and\r\nGovernment donors have been forthcoming, the Global\r\nFund remains insufficiently funded. We therefore wish\r\nto urge all Member States to show their commitment\r\nthrough increased contributions to the Fund.\r\nThe past 12 months have indeed presented\r\ntremendous challenges to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. The war against Iraq\r\nand the escalation of the conflicts in Liberia and the\r\neastern Democratic Republic of the Congo have placed\r\nthe role of the Organization under sharp, and\r\nsometimes negative, public scrutiny.\r\nWhile welcoming the deployment of ad hoc\r\nmultinational forces to provide stability and a smooth\r\nentry for eventual peacekeeping missions in Liberia\r\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we\r\nnevertheless concur with the Secretary-General that\r\nthey raise important questions about the kind resources\r\nrequired to ensure the success of peacekeeping. In the\r\ncase of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we\r\nbelieve that an honest assessment of the situation\r\nwould have revealed to the Security Council the need\r\nto mandate, from the beginning, the deployment of the\r\nUnited Nations Organization Mission in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) under\r\nChapter VII of the Charter, backed up with the\r\nnecessary robust capabilities to ensure its credibility.\r\nRobust peacekeeping requires the strong and sustained\r\nsupport of all Member States, both developed and\r\ndeveloping. Developing countries should not be the\r\nonly ones shouldering what is a key United Nations\r\nresponsibility.\r\nWe, as Member States, are continuously engaged\r\nin several negotiations where we review and, at times,\r\nestablish additional mandates for the United Nations. It\r\nis imperative that we provide the Organization with the\r\nnecessary resources to fulfil those mandated activities.\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nThe success of the Organization depends not only on\r\nour political support but also on the extent to which we\r\nensure that it receives adequate financial and\r\nadministrative resources to support it in the completion\r\nof its task without having to resort to extrabudgetary\r\nfunding. We therefore support a more realistic budget\r\nin which the priorities of the Organization will\r\ndetermine the resources needed, and not vice-versa.\r\nAt this time, we are passing through a period\r\nwhen the credibility and effectiveness of the entire\r\nUnited Nations is being questioned. The General\r\nAssembly is seen as an organ that has lost its focus and\r\nthat concentrates on statements and resolutions that are\r\noften ignored. The Economic and Social Council is\r\nseen as being out of step with the rapidly changing\r\nsocio-economic challenges. The Security Council is not\r\nrepresentative of the current United Nations\r\nmembership, and its decisions are viewed increasingly\r\nas lacking credibility.\r\nThe threat to international security posed by all\r\nweapons of mass destruction remains a critical\r\nconcern. Equally, the unrestrained build-up of\r\nconventional weapons beyond a level which can be\r\nconsidered legitimate for self-defence purposes poses a\r\ndaily threat to the physical safety of people in many\r\ncountries around the world. The proliferation of small\r\narms and light weapons disrupts the normal functions\r\nof society.\r\nThe United Nations is uniquely placed to project\r\nglobal assurance in a time of uncertainty. The survival\r\nof the multilateral system demands that the United\r\nNations address equally the concerns of peace and\r\nsecurity as well as underdevelopment, as a way to\r\nensure that the interests of powerful States, as well as\r\nthose of smaller States, are pursued as a collective\r\nglobal effort. We must avoid a situation in which either\r\nthe powerful or the disempowered States do not have\r\ntheir particular interests addressed. The United Nations\r\nwas founded nearly 60 years ago to collectively\r\naddress the needs of the world. We cannot afford to fail\r\nnow.\r\nMr. Lovald (Norway): We have a thought-\r\nprovoking and challenging report before us on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration. I would\r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for his introduction\r\nto the report and for pointing out the challenges to our\r\ncommon security agenda so clearly.\r\nThe report takes a frank and focused approach to\r\nour shortcomings — both the shortcomings of Member\r\ncountries in living up to the obligations set out in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and the shortcomings of the\r\nOrganization itself in fulfilling its mandates. The\r\nNorwegian Government agrees with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the time has come for a hard look at\r\nfundamental policy issues and for a review of the\r\nstructural changes that may be needed to deal with\r\nthem.\r\nWe have seen how international terrorism is\r\ntrying to undermine our common security agenda. The\r\nvicious attacks on United Nations headquarters in\r\nBaghdad were, in the Secretary-General’s own words,\r\nproof of a direct challenge to the vision of global\r\nsecurity, rooted in the United Nations Charter.\r\nThis is a challenge to us all, and one that we must\r\nface with determination and resolve. It must be treated\r\nlike any other serious threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity. But that resolve must result in much more\r\nthan swift retribution. It is essential to eliminate the\r\nroot causes of terrorism.\r\nThe Norwegian Government is firmly convinced\r\nthat there are clear links between peace and security,\r\nsustainable development in the broader sense, and good\r\ngovernance and respect for human rights. Every\r\ncountry bears the main responsibility for its own\r\ndevelopment, and this includes the responsibility for\r\ncreating and fine-tuning national mechanisms for\r\nsharing political, social and economic resources and\r\nensuring the protection of civil liberties, gender\r\nequality and human rights — in other words, the\r\nresponsibility for building a democratic society.\r\nIn our endeavours to improve on, and, when\r\nnecessary, change the structure and functions of the\r\nUnited Nations and of other international institutions,\r\nwe must build on those democratic principles and\r\ncreate a common, revitalized security agenda that will\r\nenable us to meet new challenges.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report on these\r\ninterconnected issues makes it very clear that what is\r\nneeded is change, both in the way we deal with our\r\ncommon challenges and in the institutions we have\r\nestablished to deal with them. The Norwegian\r\nGovernment agrees that we must return to the vision of\r\nglobal solidarity and collective security expressed in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration. Norway’s views on reform\r\nof the United Nations and its institutions and processes\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nare well known. We can assure the Assembly that we\r\nshare the Secretary-General’s vision in this respect. We\r\napplaud his proposal to establish a high-level panel to\r\nreview these issues and make recommendations,\r\nincluding recommendations on ways of strengthening\r\nthe United Nations. We are looking forward to\r\nparticipating in such discussions.\r\nI would now like to turn to development and the\r\nfollow-up to the Millennium Development Goals. We\r\nare pleased to note the emphasis on the eighth\r\nMillennium Development Goal — the commitment to\r\ndevelop a global partnership for development — in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report. This is the glue that binds\r\nall the Millennium Development Goals together into a\r\ncomprehensive development strategy. Thus we must\r\nachieve the eighth Millennium Development Goal in\r\norder to be able to achieve the others. There can be no\r\ncompromise or holding back in this endeavour. It must\r\nbe followed up just as rigorously as the other seven.\r\nThe Norwegian Government endorses the\r\nSecretary-General’s suggestion that donor countries\r\nshould agree among themselves on time-bound\r\ndeadlines for the pledges contained in the eighth\r\nMillennium Development Goal, similar to those for the\r\nother seven. In our view, it is particularly important to\r\nset ambitious deadlines for trade, debt relief and\r\nofficial development assistance. Norway will work\r\ntowards agreement on such deadlines in the\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment (OECD) and other forums. This would\r\nalso make it necessary to set up a universal reporting\r\nsystem for donor countries on progress towards\r\nachieving the eighth goal. The Nordic countries are\r\nalready in the process of implementing such a system\r\non a voluntary basis.\r\nBut time-bound targets are not enough in and of\r\nthemselves. I would also like to stress the importance\r\nof policy coherence. This is the responsibility of donor\r\ncountries, and we must ensure the coordination,\r\nconsistency and coherence of all policies relating to\r\nglobal poverty and attainment of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Policy coherence also entails the\r\nsystematic promotion of mutually reinforcing actions\r\nby national and international decision-makers, which\r\nwill create synergies in our efforts to fight poverty.\r\nIf we are to achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals and win the war on poverty, we must make\r\nchanges and mobilize resources in at least four areas\r\nsimultaneously.\r\nFirst, international framework conditions for debt\r\nreduction, trade and investment must be improved and\r\nangled more towards the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. We must continue to build on the positive trends\r\nand decisions emanating from Monterrey,\r\nJohannesburg and Doha.\r\nSecondly, the developing countries themselves\r\nneed to assign priorities, draw up strategies, invest in\r\nhuman resources and implement poverty-oriented\r\npolicies based on good governance and respect for\r\nhuman rights. Again, as agreed at Monterrey, such\r\nefforts need to be matched with stronger support from\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nThirdly, official development assistance should\r\nbe increased considerably. The necessity for this cannot\r\nbe overemphasized. We think that a clear and concrete\r\nplan, with time limits, should be set for the necessary\r\nincreases in official development assistance. Official\r\ndevelopment assistance is an essential development\r\ntool for achieving the hard targets such as halving\r\npoverty, achieving universal primary education and\r\nreversing the spread of killer diseases.\r\nFourthly, we must make a concerted effort to\r\nensure that the Millennium Development Goals are the\r\nfocus of both global and national action. We must build\r\nnew coalitions for action to achieve them in both\r\ndeveloped and developing countries. To do that, we\r\nmust also mobilize the private sector and the enormous\r\nresources of civil society. New partnerships must be\r\nexplored that can unleash unexploited potential in these\r\nsectors.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to mention a fifth area\r\nwhere progress is essential if we are to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. That is meeting the\r\nspecial needs of Africa. It is a challenge that, in one\r\nway or another, involves practically all eight goals. We\r\nmust be aware of the real magnitude of this challenge\r\nand deal with it accordingly. That applies both to the\r\ninternational community and to the African countries\r\nthemselves. We commend the African leaders on the\r\ninitiative of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\ndevelopment and on their willingness to tackle the\r\ncontinent’s diverse and difficult problems.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): You and your\r\nteam, Sir, have been displaying a spirit of remarkable\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\ncollegial leadership. It is worthy of our admiration and\r\nour support.\r\nBoth the reports of the Secretary-General, the one\r\non the work of the Organization (A/58/1) and the other\r\non the follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium\r\nSummit (A/58/323) are products that represent a high\r\norder of professionalism. They underscore the\r\ngeopolitical realities that have provided the matrix for\r\nUnited Nations activities over the past year. They\r\nreaffirm the sobering facts and serious challenges that\r\nneed to be faced and overcome, if lasting peace and\r\nunfettered development, as envisioned in the\r\nMillennium Declaration, are to be achieved.\r\nWe find this joint debate on both reports most\r\nworthwhile. We would have liked, however, to see the\r\nreport on the work of the Organization issued six\r\nweeks prior to the session’s commencement. We would\r\nalso endorse the idea that several closely linked reports\r\nbe combined into a single document.\r\nThe Secretary-General is both profound and wise\r\nwhen he cautions that, “In the area of peace and\r\nsecurity, in particular, consensus expressed or implied\r\nin the Declaration now looks less solid than it did three\r\nyears ago”. (A/58/323/para. 3)\r\nWhen he expresses concern about the deep\r\ndivision within the international community and refers\r\nto the accusation of double agendas and preferences for\r\nnarrow national gains over broader collective interests,\r\nit confirms our apprehension that we do not learn from\r\nhistory. In concluding, the Secretary-General reaffirms\r\nhis strong resolve to conduct reviews and reform of the\r\nworld body to render it greater flexibility and more\r\ncredibility. Such determination is reassuring.\r\nBangladesh strongly supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call for strengthening the multilateral\r\ninstitutions through effective reforms in order to adapt\r\nto the emerging challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nWe must work together seriously to respond to his\r\nappeals to focus on the principal organs of the United\r\nNations — the General Assembly, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, the Trusteeship Council and the\r\nSecurity Council. But reforms must be truly\r\nrepresentative of the aspirations and concerns of all\r\nMember States. They must not perpetuate current\r\nimbalances, nor respond only to transitory phases.\r\nAnything that purports to lock the international\r\ncommunity into situations for all times cannot be\r\nstabilizing.\r\nWe share the Secretary-General’s concerns over\r\nthe serious setbacks and threats to international peace\r\nand security during the past year. The war in Iraq, in\r\nvarying intensity, continues to test the credibility of the\r\nUnited Nations and the principle of collective security,\r\nas enshrined in the Charter and reaffirmed in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. The central and effective\r\nUnited Nations role in facilitating the post-war\r\neconomic and political reconstruction in Iraq is critical\r\nto the resolution of the current impasse.\r\nThe situation in Palestine worsens by the day. The\r\nspiralling violence continues unabated. The attack on\r\nSyria yesterday, which has been condemned by my\r\nGovernment, cannot, and will not, advance the cause of\r\npeace; indeed, on the contrary, it has contributed to\r\nexacerbating the already volatile situation. The United\r\nNations must use the totality of its capacity in all its\r\norgans to resume the peace process and realize the two-\r\nState solution.\r\nMy delegation has noted the reference made by\r\nthe Secretary-General to proliferation and weapons of\r\nmass destruction as issues of great concern. On\r\nterrorism, he has emphasized the need to take into\r\naccount root causes such as poverty and grievances\r\nover injustices. We cannot agree more. We believe that,\r\nto keep a genuine global coalition against terrorism\r\ntogether, there will be need for tangible progress on\r\nother fronts of the struggle for a humane and just\r\nworld.\r\nBangladesh has never failed to respond\r\neffectively and promptly to the Secretary-General’s call\r\nfor peacekeeping and peace-building. Over the past two\r\nyears, we have participated in 28 United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations, across four continents, with\r\nover 50,000 military and police personnel. Most\r\nrecently, we have answered the call for participation in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, and are poised\r\nto do so in Liberia. We do so not just because we see\r\nthis as advancing our constructive role as an active and\r\nstabilizing international actor, but also because we\r\nwant to spread across the troubled parts of the world\r\nthe lesson and axiom we have learned from our own\r\nexperience that, for development to take place,\r\nconflicts must first cease. Hence, also, our interest in\r\nthe United Nations conflict prevention exercises, in\r\nwhich we have played the role of facilitator.\r\nFor billions around the world, non-military\r\nthreats to security remain the highest priority. These\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\ninclude extreme poverty, environmental degradation,\r\nHIV/AIDS and malaria. The Secretary-General has\r\ndone well to apply special focus on the socio-economic\r\nagenda in both his reports. The Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals are the best hope for the world’s\r\npoor. Unfortunately, the Secretary-General’s\r\nassessment of its progress is sobering. It falls short of\r\nour expectations. For most developing nations, the road\r\nto the year 2015 is far too long and the destination far\r\ntoo elusive.\r\nWe agree with the analysis that the success of the\r\nfirst seven goals hinges on the fulfilment of the\r\ncommitments of goal eight, dealing with equitable\r\ntrade, greater debt relief and larger official\r\ndevelopment assistance flows to developing countries.\r\nTo achieve the Millennium Development Goals, words\r\nmust be translated into deeds and commitments made\r\nmust be kept. It is not enough just to set targets. It is\r\nfar more important to create the wherewithal to achieve\r\nthem. Horrendous experiences have already warned us\r\nthat failure in development is not an option.\r\nThe disappointment at Cancún must not\r\noverpower us, but instead, must spur us to greater\r\naction. Continued failures to advance in trade\r\nnegotiations will be to the detriment of all; there will\r\nbe no advance unless it is based on equity and fair play.\r\nUnhindered market access and special and preferential\r\ntreatment for products of developing countries should\r\nbe at the heart of multilateral negotiations. Trade is an\r\ninstrument of development, and must be treated as\r\nsuch.\r\nAfrica deserves special attention. We applaud\r\nAfrican leaders for the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment, for we believe it will place Africa in the\r\ndriver’s seat. Also the needs of the least developed\r\ncountries must be addressed and the Brussels\r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed\r\nCountries implemented.\r\nI am pleased to be able to say that in recent times,\r\nwe in Bangladesh have achieved considerable progress\r\nwith regard to our development achievements. We have\r\ncut our population growth by half, curbed child\r\nmortality by a third, achieved food self-sufficiency,\r\nimproved sanitation standards with indigenous methods\r\nand reduced emission of ozone-depleting substances\r\nand vehicular pollution. Free schooling for girl\r\nchildren, gender mainstreaming and empowerment of\r\nwomen have been the major policy thrusts of the Prime\r\nMinster, Begum Khaleda Zia.\r\nWe believe our successes are owed not just to\r\nappropriate use of external assistance, though that is a\r\nfactor, but, more important, to the prevalence of a\r\nculture of pluralism, the creation of strong and\r\naccountable democratic institutions and the emergence\r\nof a powerful middleclass and a vibrant civil society.\r\nThe World Bank has called Bangladesh’s experience a\r\nsilent revolution. Many see this as a paradigm worth\r\nemulating. We want to share our experience with others\r\nof comparable milieu. We would like the United\r\nNations to be a conduit for making that possible. The\r\nUnited Nations will be most relevant to developing\r\ncountries when it enhances its role as a locater, collator\r\nand transmitter of best practices. It will pass the litmus\r\ntest of relevance not in drafts and declarations, but in\r\noperations and implementation.\r\nBangladesh firmly believes that poverty\r\nalleviation is best achieved, and development is most\r\npossible, through a mix of democracy, pluralism,\r\nmoderate and progressive social ethos, greater gender\r\nbalance and women’s empowerment, human rights and\r\naccountable governance. We would encourage the\r\nUnited Nations to examine, through appropriate\r\nconsultations, the possibilities of instituting peer\r\nreviews of development policies of partners and\r\nMembers States that volunteer themselves for the\r\npurpose. This could result in rewarding performance,\r\nshow-casing achievements and guiding investments to\r\nmore fruitful destinations.\r\nThe Secretary-General has called for a greater\r\nvoice and presence of developing countries in the\r\ndecision-making process of key international bodies,\r\nincluding the United Nations, the World Trade\r\nOrganization and international financial institutions.\r\nTheir policies impact on our societies most profoundly.\r\nAs the current chairperson of the Second Committee,\r\nBangladesh will work closely with Members States,\r\nglobal institutions and civil society to join efforts to\r\nrealize this goal.\r\nOur leaders, during the past two weeks, have\r\nreaffirmed that nations, big and small, weak and\r\npowerful, need the United Nations as much as the\r\nUnited Nations needs them. It is only through\r\ncombining our endeavours that we shall be able to\r\nachieve our shared objectives of peace, security,\r\ndevelopment and harmony. The power of humanity\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\ndoes not lie in the size of its armies, but rather in the\r\nstrength of its ideas; not in its ability to destroy, but in\r\nits capacity to build; not in its tendencies to despair,\r\nbut in its propensity to hope. Let humanity tap its\r\npower for its own benefit.\r\nMr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAs this is the first time that I am taking the floor since\r\nyou, Sir, have become President, I wish to sincerely\r\ncongratulate you on your election to preside over our\r\nwork and to assure you of my fullest cooperation. I am\r\nalso grateful to the Secretary-General for the\r\ndocuments he has made available to us, A/58/1 and\r\nA/58/323, which constitute a very clear foundation for\r\nour debates.\r\nAllow me first to endorse the remarks made by\r\nthe Permanent Representatives of Morocco and Peru,\r\nwho spoke today in the debate on behalf of the Group\r\nof 77 and the Rio Group respectively, groups to which\r\nGuatemala belongs.\r\nWe wanted to supplement those statements with\r\nsome additional thoughts, because today we have an\r\nopportunity to review the current status of and\r\nprospects for the United Nations, a very important\r\nissue, on which we wish to clearly state our position\r\nfor the record. Secondly, by way of a general\r\nstatement, we concur with the Secretary-General when\r\nhe states, in the last three paragraphs of his report on\r\nthe work of the Organization (A/58/1), that, despite its\r\nimperfections, the United Nations continues to embody\r\nthe hopes of peoples and that its work is having a\r\npositive impact on the lives of many people throughout\r\nthe world. I can attest to the fact that this is true in\r\nGuatemala, where the Organization has had and\r\ncontinues to have a significant impact.\r\nAt the same time, we recognize the vital need to\r\nadapt the Organization to the world’s changing\r\ncircumstances. In that regard, we also concur with what\r\nthe Secretary-General states in his report as well as in\r\nhis address in this very Hall on 23 September 2003,\r\nwhen he indicated that the events of the past few\r\nmonths were so traumatic for us all and that they have\r\nled us to dispassionately re-think the kind of\r\nOrganization we want and to take action in the area of\r\nreform.\r\nThirdly, we have read with interest the report\r\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General by way of follow\r\nup to the outcome of the Millennium Declaration. As is\r\ntrue of any complex project, it provides a mixed picture\r\nin which achievements and failures, steps forward and\r\nbackward, grounds for hope and causes for\r\ndisappointment are intermingled. Perhaps what remains\r\nfreshest in our memory are the marked disagreements\r\nin the Security Council on the disarmament of Iraq and\r\nthe deep divisions in the international community\r\nconcerning the war and its aftermath.\r\nWe also have in mind the far from impressive\r\nperformance of the world economy recently, which is\r\njeopardizing the fulfilment of several key Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, as well as the less than positive\r\noutcome of the World Trade Organization Ministerial\r\nConference, held in Cancún. But none of these\r\nshortcomings can cancel out our Organization’s\r\nsignificant achievements, including the process that\r\nculminated in the independence of Timor-Leste, the\r\ncollective response of the membership to the tragic\r\nevents of 11 September 2001 in combating terrorism,\r\nthe adoption of that unique manifesto — the Monterrey\r\nConsensus — and the strengthening of the Secretariat’s\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building capacity.\r\nAbove and beyond this purely illustrative list of\r\nachievements, we believe that the success of greatest\r\nimport was the very holding of the Millennium Summit\r\nand the adoption of the Declaration which was its\r\noutcome. We believe that that Declaration is in itself an\r\nimportant inherent asset because, among other reasons,\r\nit provides a road map or a shared vision for all\r\nMembers. It is a tool for raising public awareness. It\r\nfacilitates the task of making the work of the United\r\nNations system more coherent, coordinated and\r\ncooperative by providing a set of common objectives.\r\nIt also should also be a source of improvement in\r\nour system of programming and of setting budgetary\r\npriorities. It gives quantitative indicators, which make\r\nit easier to gauge progress. It represents a foundation\r\non which we can continue to build, at the international\r\nlevel as well as within each country. In particular, it is\r\nan implicit justification of the need to preserve and\r\nstrengthen multilateralism and the United Nations.\r\nFor all these reasons, in addition to the\r\naccounting that the Secretary-General has given us in\r\neach of the areas covered by the report — peace and\r\nsecurity, development, human rights and democracy —\r\nour own assessment of the work of the Organization\r\nthis year — a year that has been so traumatic for the\r\nUnited Nations, when we are still mourning the victims\r\nof August 19 last — in no way alters our feeling that\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nthe United Nations remains an indispensable tool for\r\nhumankind. It must be protected, improved,\r\nmodernized and strengthened.\r\nThat is also why we are ready to heed the appeal\r\nmade by the Secretary-General on 23 September that\r\ntogether we reach agreement on ways of improving the\r\nUnited Nations, so that it may serve the purpose of its\r\nfounders:\r\n“to save succeeding generations from the scourge\r\nof war … to reaffirm faith in fundamental human\r\nrights … to establish conditions under which\r\njustice and respect for the obligations arising\r\nfrom treaties and other sources of international\r\nlaw can be maintained … [and] to promote social\r\nprogress and better standards of life in larger\r\nfreedom.”\r\nMr. Akram (Pakistan): We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his reports on the work of the Organization\r\nand on the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, respectively. We are equally grateful for\r\nhis statement during the inaugural session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on 23 September. These reports and\r\nstatements will contribute greatly to our discussions\r\nabout the relevance and the role of the United Nations\r\nin our fast-changing world.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that this has\r\nbeen a trying year for the United Nations. The crisis\r\nover Iraq has severely tested the principles of\r\ncollective security. The Security Council’s refusal to\r\nauthorize the use of force led some to unfair\r\njudgements about the adequacy and effectiveness of the\r\nCouncil as the primary instrument for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. The Council did not\r\nfail; in accordance with the Charter, it set the bar high\r\nfor the use of force.\r\nThe framers of our Charter, emerging from a\r\ndevastating World War, authorized the use of force by\r\nStates only in self-defence or collectively, if explicitly\r\nauthorized by the Security Council. That principle must\r\nremain sacrosanct. Attempting to develop criteria for\r\nan early authorization of coercive measures to address\r\ncertain types of threats is fraught with danger for the\r\nworld order. We fear that reopening the issue of the use\r\nof force, apart from requiring Charter revision, may\r\nopen the door to more frequent resort to unilateral or\r\npre-emptive use of force by certain States.\r\nThe United Nations has continued to grapple with\r\nwhat are now referred to as the old and new threats to\r\ninternational peace and security. The international legal\r\nframework to fight terrorism more effectively is\r\ngrowing, and so is the capacity of States acting\r\ncooperatively to counter terrorism.\r\nWe agree that terrorists must be prevented from\r\never acquiring weapons of mass destruction. States\r\nwhich possess such weapons, or sensitive materials or\r\ntechnology, should exercise effective controls over\r\nthem. At the same time, we must not allow\r\nexaggeration of this threat. There has been only one\r\nincident in Japan where a terrorist group — a non-State\r\nactor — actually resorted to the use of chemical\r\nweapons. Otherwise, weapons of mass destruction have\r\nbeen used only by States and in the context of State\r\nterrorism. Our attention must not be diverted from the\r\nfact that there are two separate dangers — terrorism\r\nand weapons of mass destruction — and both must be\r\ndealt with effectively and largely separately.\r\nPakistan believes that while strengthening State\r\ncapacities to fight terrorism, we must address terrorism\r\nmore comprehensively. A legal definition of terrorism\r\nmust be evolved which also includes State terrorism\r\nand which rejects attempts to de-legitimize the\r\nstruggles of peoples for self-determination and foreign\r\noccupation. The fight against terrorism must be waged\r\nwithout sacrificing human rights. We must evolve\r\nstrategies that aim at reducing the resort to terrorism —\r\nespecially by promoting solutions to longstanding\r\ndisputes and measures to reduce poverty and address\r\npolitical and economic injustice.\r\nIn the arena of disarmament, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has rightly called attention to the risks of\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and\r\nstressed the need to strengthen existing weapons of\r\nmass destruction regimes. We agree that applying\r\ndouble standards could have adverse consequences.\r\nThe most effective way to address the danger of\r\nweapons of mass destruction is through sincere efforts\r\nto achieve disarmament — of nuclear, chemical and\r\nbiological weapons.\r\nThe Secretary-General is of the view — as he\r\nstated in paragraph 20 of his report on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration — that\r\nweak enforcement measures are the major weakness of\r\nthe existing nuclear, chemical and biological regimes,\r\nas they “essentially leave the penalties for non-\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\ncompliance unspecified.” We believe that this is not\r\nnecessarily so. The major weakness is that the non-\r\nproliferation and disarmament bargain is being\r\nunequally implemented. Both horizontal and vertical\r\nproliferation must be halted. The suggestion for\r\npossible action through the United Nations, including\r\nthe Security Council, could, in fact, be\r\ncounterproductive, as is being discovered in the case of\r\nKorea. Pakistan has consistently held that existing\r\ntreaty regimes should be strengthened to equitably\r\naddress all disarmament and non-proliferation issues,\r\nincluding non-compliance. Any effort to complement\r\nthe treaty regimes outside the treaty bodies would not\r\nonly undermine those regimes but also set back efforts\r\nfor disarmament at the global level. They may indeed\r\nincrease the dangers of the use of force, including the\r\nuse of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nIn South Asia, the Secretary-General has referred\r\nto the exchange of High Commissioners between India\r\nand Pakistan and announcements on intended\r\nrestoration of rail, road and air links and other\r\nconfidence-building measures. He has expressed the\r\nhope that those measures will lead to the resumption of\r\nsustained dialogue and to real progress towards a\r\npeaceful settlement of the outstanding problems\r\nbetween these two neighbours, including over Jammu\r\nand Kashmir.\r\nUnfortunately, such hopes have not been realized,\r\ndue to India’s refusal to resume dialogue with Pakistan,\r\nespecially on the core issue of Kashmir.\r\nOn 24 September, President Musharraf proposed\r\nfrom this rostrum an action plan for peace between\r\nIndia and Pakistan — including the opening of bilateral\r\ndialogue, a reciprocal ceasefire along the Line of\r\nControl in Kashmir, cessation of violence within\r\nIndian-occupied Kashmir by Indian forces and\r\nKashmiri freedom fighters, enhanced monitoring of the\r\nLine of Control on both sides, and the maintenance of\r\nan arms balance, both conventional and non-\r\nconventional, between the two countries.\r\nIndia lost an opportunity for peace when it\r\nsummarily rejected Pakistan’s action plan. We hope\r\nIndia will yet reflect and respond positively. This world\r\nbody, and the Secretary-General, have a direct\r\nresponsibility, flowing from the resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council, to promote and support all measures\r\nfor a just and lasting solution to the Kashmir dispute,\r\nrightly described as the most dangerous in the world.\r\nThe pledge of the United Nations — and of India and\r\nPakistan — to the people of Jammu and Kashmir must\r\nbe honoured.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report illustrates how the\r\nchallenge of security in Afghanistan casts a shadow\r\nover every aspect of rebuilding that war-ravaged\r\ncountry. Pakistan believes that the international\r\ncommunity has an obligation to ensure the successful\r\nimplementation of the Bonn process.\r\nIraq remains an urgent challenge for the\r\ninternational community. Member States must be\r\nguided in this situation by the objective of restoring\r\nIraq’s sovereignty and political independence; ensuring\r\nits unity and territorial integrity; upholding the right of\r\nthe Iraqi people to determine their own future and\r\ncontrol their natural resources; and respecting their\r\nreligious and cultural traditions and the sanctity of the\r\nholy places.\r\nThe political and stabilization processes in Iraq\r\nshould involve, and should be owned by, the Iraqi\r\npeople, under the auspices of the United Nations. We\r\ntrust that consensus will be reached on such a\r\nframework for Iraq’s political, security and economic\r\ntransition in a new Security Council resolution,\r\nacceptable to the Iraqi people and enjoying the support\r\nof the regional States.\r\nThe hopes for peace in the Middle East, revived\r\nby the Quartet’s road map, have now been all but\r\nextinguished. The unacceptable Israeli aggression\r\nagainst Syrian territory is a flagrant violation of\r\ninternational law, the Charter and all relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. Besides threatening a larger\r\nconflagration, it undermines endeavours for a\r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle\r\nEast on the basis of resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973)\r\nand 1397 (2002). The world must reject Israel’s\r\naggressive actions and revive the hopes for a just peace\r\nwhere two States — Palestine and Israel — can exist\r\nside by side within viable and recognized boundaries.\r\nHuman rights remain an essential part of United\r\nNations work. Human rights bodies, however, must not\r\nbe allowed to serve the national or partisan political\r\nagendas of some States. Nor should the United Nations\r\ntolerate selectivity and double standards in human\r\nrights, practices that erode the credibility of our\r\ninstitutions. It is bizarre that our Organization should\r\nignore the premeditated massacre of 2,000 Muslims at\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nGujarat, while castigating isolated misdemeanours in\r\nso many other countries.\r\nThere is a growing recognition that development\r\nis humanity’s shared agenda. Regrettably, the\r\ninternational community is falling well short of\r\nrealizing most of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe developing countries must, of course, undertake\r\nthe necessary structural reforms at the national level.\r\nBut the developed countries must honour their\r\ncommitments, particularly in areas of official\r\ndevelopment assistance and equitable trade.\r\nFor its part, Pakistan has embarked upon an\r\nambitious reform programme to mobilize domestic\r\nresources and build up national capacity to meet the\r\nchallenges of development. We are also engaged in the\r\nprocess of preparing our national Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals report.\r\nPakistan believes that the objectives of\r\nsustainable development can be fully realized only\r\nwhen we pursue an integrated approach whereby\r\ncommitments relating to all three pillars of sustainable\r\ndevelopment — economic growth, social development\r\nand environmental protection — are honoured and\r\nimplemented by all parties.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that\r\ninternational trade can be the most important tool to\r\ngenerate development. The inequities in the\r\ninternational trading system must be eliminated.\r\nDevelopment should become the gravamen of trade\r\nnegotiations and globalization. The Doha Round must\r\ngenuinely become a development round. The special\r\nprogrammes for Africa, such as the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development, and for the least developed\r\nand low income countries must be vigorously\r\nsupported.\r\nWe commend the Secretary-General for his\r\nconsistent efforts since 1997 to streamline the\r\nSecretariat. Pakistan has made its modest contribution\r\nto advance these reforms and will continue with those\r\nefforts.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that the\r\nOrganization must adapt to the realities of today’s\r\nworld. However, it is extremely important that the\r\nprospective institutional reforms do not change the\r\nintergovernmental, multilateral and representative\r\nnature of this Organization and that such reforms are in\r\nconsonance with the principles of the Charter,\r\nespecially the principle of the sovereign equality of\r\nStates.\r\nThe General Assembly’s procedures and\r\nprocesses can, of course, be improved to enhance\r\nefficiency. However, the weakness of the General\r\nAssembly has been caused by those who have\r\ntransferred the real responsibility for addressing the\r\nmajor issues — even those not primarily relating to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security — to\r\nthe Security Council and other organs and entities,\r\nsome of which are outside the United Nations system.\r\nWe are not convinced that creating an executive\r\ncommittee, steering committee, select body or any\r\nother privileged group within the General Assembly\r\nwould make it more effective. On the contrary, it would\r\nundermine the representative character of the Assembly\r\nand erode the legitimacy of its decisions. We must try\r\nnot to import into the Assembly the culture of unequal\r\nrelationships that afflict some other bodies of the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nWe can all agree that the Security Council is in\r\nneed of reform. It needs to become more representative\r\nand more transparent. Pakistan supports the expansion\r\nof the Security Council. At the same time, we will\r\ncontinue to resist the proliferation of centres of\r\nprivilege in the Security Council. It is clear that, for the\r\npresent, consensus within the United Nations would\r\nfavour the expansion of only the non-permanent\r\nelected members of the Security Council, and we will\r\nsupport that.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council cannot be\r\nempowered to play the central role in economic and\r\nsocial cooperation merely by changing its name. The\r\nreal problem is the unwillingness of major Member\r\nStates to allow the Economic and Social Council to\r\nconsider and decide on central issues relating to the\r\nmanagement of international economic and social\r\nrelations. The Monterrey Conference and the\r\nendeavour to build an integrated mechanism for\r\nfollow-up and implementation of the outcomes of\r\nmajor United Nations conferences offers a unique\r\nopportunity to enable the Economic and Social Council\r\nand the United Nations as a whole to play a central\r\ncoordinating role in achieving universal development\r\nand the socio-economic goals endorsed by the\r\ninternational community, especially the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nPakistan has also proposed the setting up of ad\r\nhoc composite committees of the General Assembly,\r\nSecurity Council and Economic and Social Council to\r\naddress complex crises and conflict situations in their\r\npolitical, economic and social dimensions.\r\nWe support the presentation of the United Nations\r\nbudget in a shorter, more strategic and results-based\r\nformat. Pakistan believes that all mandated activities of\r\nthe United Nations should be provided with adequate\r\nresources. While we support efforts to align resources\r\nto the priorities of the Organization, we believe that\r\nresource allocation should not be used as an instrument\r\nof policy for priority-setting. We fully support budget\r\ndiscipline and an efficient use of resources.\r\nPakistan would welcome the establishment of a\r\nhigh-level panel of eminent personalities to examine\r\nthe current challenges and recommend ways of\r\nstrengthening the United Nations through reform of its\r\ninstitutions and processes. Such a panel should be\r\nbroadly representative, interact with Member States,\r\nincluding smaller States, and formulate its\r\nrecommendations for action and decision by the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Djumala (Indonesia): The delegation of\r\nIndonesia welcomes the report of the Secretary-General\r\non the work of the Organization (A/58/1), his annual\r\nsummary of how the United Nations has responded to\r\nthe issues before it in the previous year, as well as his\r\nreport on the implementation of the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration (A/58/323). We are proud of\r\nthis opportunity to make a contribution to this\r\ndiscussion, in view of the fact that the past year proved\r\nto be one of the most intriguing that our esteemed\r\nOrganization has ever seen.\r\nSpeaking in the general debate on 23 September,\r\nPresident Megawati Soekarnoputri of Indonesia drew\r\nthe attention of the General Assembly to the need to\r\ntackle the scourge of terrorism by ensuring that its root\r\ncauses are adequately addressed. As Indonesia, a nation\r\nthat has twice in the past year seen the worst of\r\nterrorism, has always stressed here in the United\r\nNations, nothing is an admissible excuse for terrorism.\r\nWhile adequate international effort must be mobilized\r\nagainst it, therefore, attention must also be paid to\r\naddressing those issues that might, in a roundabout\r\nway, provide justification to those who might want to\r\nengage in it. Of key concern here, as President\r\nMegawati indicated, is the pursuit of social and\r\npolitical justice.\r\nIn this regard, it is noteworthy that, in his report,\r\nthe Secretary-General observes that indirect causes of\r\nterrorism, such as poverty and grievances borne from\r\ninjustice, must be taken into consideration in\r\nfashioning strategies aimed at addressing terrorism. We\r\nin Indonesia strongly believe that, by genuinely\r\naddressing these fundamental issues, we will make it\r\nmore and more difficult for terrorists to find adherents\r\nor strong support.\r\nThis approach is based on the relationship\r\nbetween peace and development. While\r\nunderdevelopment should never be used as an excuse\r\nfor disturbance of the peace, it unfortunately is always\r\na ready excuse or natural scapegoat. That is why\r\ndevelopment is the natural answer to the problem of\r\nhow to resolve conflict, in the same way that\r\naddressing issues of poverty and injustice proves a\r\nuseful tool for combating terrorism.\r\nIndonesia notes with concern the chronic\r\nshortfalls in funding for dealing with humanitarian\r\ncrises internationally. Whereas the United Nations\r\nproduced, in all, 27 consolidated appeals for $5.8\r\nbillion for humanitarian assistance, the international\r\nresponse yielded only 52 per cent of the amount\r\nrequested. The 48 per cent shortfall means that many\r\nmillions of lives, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, may\r\nhave been placed in great peril during the reporting\r\nperiod. In this regard, we need to re-emphasize that\r\ninternational security is put at risk when individual\r\nsecurity is put at risk. The gap in funding must\r\ntherefore be closed for peace to prevail and for\r\ndevelopment to take place.\r\nThe present situation in Iraq, where the\r\nhumanitarian crisis intensifies almost daily, embodies\r\nthis challenge. We are pleased to note the\r\naccomplishments of the United Nations system in that\r\ncountry, despite the highly volatile scenario there. Not\r\nthe least of these accomplishments is the courage and\r\ndetermination of the system to respond to the needs of\r\nmillions of ordinary Iraqis, whose only desire is for\r\npeace and the opportunity to live life in greater\r\nfreedom.\r\nIndonesia is in full agreement with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s identification of the elements critical to the\r\nglobal enhancement of the process of development.\r\nThere is agreement on the need for new and increased\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.23\r\nfinancing for development, as mandated by the\r\nMonterrey Consensus. Likewise, there is agreement on\r\nthe fact that cooperation from the private sector also\r\nfacilitates financing of the development process and\r\nhelps to mobilize societies towards attaining national\r\ndevelopment goals.\r\nWhile the role of the private sector is not to be\r\nignored, it is equally important that Governments live\r\nup to their responsibility to create an environment\r\nconducive to development. Through Governments’\r\ncoherently organized policies and programmes,\r\nsustainable development must be placed well within\r\nthe reach of individuals, groups and institutions in their\r\nsocieties.\r\nHowever, without international cooperation to\r\nachieve internationally accepted development goals,\r\nincluding those of the Millennium Declaration, national\r\nefforts will be seriously handicapped. To aim for the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nwithin the specific timeframes is not impractical or\r\nutopian, as some might be tempted to believe. In\r\nparagraph 49 of his report on the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, the Secretary-General made\r\nthe point very clearly:\r\n“Rapid advances in some areas have shown\r\nthat the Millennium Development Goals, while\r\nambitious, can be reached at the global level.\r\nThey are still achievable at the national level for\r\nnearly every country.” (A/58/323)\r\nBut success in meeting global challenges, he\r\nobserves, hinges upon a demonstration of the necessary\r\npolitical will at the global level.\r\nApart from concessions for poor countries to\r\naccess cheaply produced generic drugs to combat the\r\nHIV/AIDS epidemic, nothing else of note has occurred.\r\nIt was estimated that if the summit in Cancún had\r\nnegotiated solid free trade agreements, it would have\r\ngenerated some $530 billion in income gains for both\r\nrich and poor countries and reduced the number of the\r\nworld’s poor by as many as 144 million people by\r\n2015.\r\nTo promote South-South cooperation, Indonesia\r\nhosted, last July, the two-day Asian-African Sub-\r\nregional Organizations Conference in Bandung. That\r\nConference was held to establish a New Strategic\r\nPartnership between Asia and Africa, the foundation\r\nfor which was laid in 1955. Using their differences as\r\nstrengths to complement each other, Asia and Africa\r\nwill draw lessons from their experiences in overcoming\r\nproblems related to political, social, economic and\r\ndevelopment issues, as part of their development\r\nprocesses.\r\nIn this context, my delegation welcomes the\r\noutcomes of the recently held Tokyo International\r\nConference on African Development, which\r\nemphasizes support for the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development as one of its basic themes.\r\nIndonesia strongly urges that the reforms\r\nnecessary to make the United Nations system more\r\neffective and efficient not be delayed any further. We\r\ncannot agree more with the Secretary-General’s\r\nobservation that the Security Council needs to be\r\nreformed in order to regain the confidence of States, in\r\nparticular those of the developing world, by showing\r\nitself to be truly representative of their views and\r\ninterests. The Council’s composition must also reflect\r\ncurrent geopolitical realities. The truth is, we all want a\r\nbetter, stronger, more capable United Nations that\r\nrepresents the best hope for multilateralism in a highly\r\ninterdependent world. For that to happen, the\r\nOrganization must prove itself to be flexible and\r\nadaptable.\r\nWith regard to paragraph 74 of the report —\r\nconcerning the situation in Aceh — my delegation\r\nwould like to set the record straight. There has been no\r\nresumption of military activity against the separatist\r\nmovement. What we have is a combined operation,\r\nwhich contains a humanitarian aspect that has borne\r\nfruit. The Acehnese, who had been the victims of\r\nextortion, killings and other acts of terrorism\r\nperpetrated by the armed separatist movement, have\r\nshown their full support for the integrated or combined\r\noperation without fear of retaliation from the armed\r\nseparatists.\r\nBesides the humanitarian aspect, another aspect\r\nof the combined operation is the revitalization of the\r\ncivil administration and the implementation of the rule\r\nof law. In the five months since the combined operation\r\nbegan, on 19 May 2003, the situation in Aceh has\r\nimproved considerably. Another positive development\r\nis that hundreds of members of the armed separatist\r\nmovement have voluntarily surrendered. The\r\nGovernment has accepted them and provided them with\r\nvocational training so that they will have appropriate\r\nskills when they are returned to the community.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on these items for this meeting.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
