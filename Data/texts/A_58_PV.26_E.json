Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Kirn\r\n(Slovenia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 124 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations\r\nThe Acting President: Before we turn to the\r\nitems on the agenda for this afternoon, I should like to\r\ninform members that since the issue of documents\r\nA/58/360 and Add.1, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo has made the necessary payment to reduce its\r\narrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly\r\ntakes note of that information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: That information will be\r\nreflected in document A/58/360/Add.2, to be issued\r\ntomorrow morning.\r\nAgenda items 60 and 10 (continued)\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/323)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/58/1)\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parilla (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThe Millennium Declaration states, “We ... have gathered\r\n... to reaffirm our faith in the Organization and its Charter\r\nas indispensable foundations of a more peaceful,\r\nprosperous and just world” (resolution 55/2, para. 1). It\r\ncontinues, “We have a collective responsibility to uphold\r\nthe principles of human dignity, equality and equity at\r\nthe global level” (para. 2), and declares, “We reaffirm\r\nour commitment to the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, which have proved\r\ntimeless and universal” (para. 3).\r\nThe illegal war in Iraq has made everything more\r\nclear. In similar times, in 1999, in the Assembly Hall,\r\nthe Cuban delegation said that\r\n“under conditions of a unipolar and neo-liberal\r\nworld order; under the economic and military\r\ndictatorship of a super-Power; and given the\r\nimposition of a single model, the nuclear club, the\r\noffensive military doctrine of the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization, the so-called global threats,\r\ncountries being relegated to the ‘Euro-Atlantic\r\nperiphery’, the financial blackmail against the\r\nUnited Nations, the tyranny of some permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council and the\r\nCouncil’s double standards; the crippling of the\r\nGeneral Assembly; and the ways that political\r\nselectivity and manipulation applied to human\r\nrights issues — in view of all this, it would be\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nsuicidal to endorse the right to global\r\nintervention ...” (A/54/PV.32, p. 2).\r\nTwo wars later, it is obvious that the system of\r\ninternational security constructed after the Second\r\nWorld War, enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations and reflected in the Millennium Declaration,\r\nhas been permanently destroyed.\r\nIn addition, there are now even more dangerous\r\nconcepts: the “Nuclear Posture Review” — the review\r\nof the national security doctrine of the United States;\r\nthat country’s announcement that it is willing to act\r\nagainst threats emanating from the territories of more\r\nthan 60 countries; our countries of the third world\r\nbeing labelled “obscure corners of the planet”; the\r\ndefining of so-called new threats and combinations of\r\nthreats — new forms of terrorism and the proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction; so-called armed and\r\nunarmed threats; and the preventive use of force,\r\nincluding on the territory of other States.\r\nThere is no doubt that the world today is more\r\ndangerous and less secure that it was in 1999 or other\r\nyears before the criminal acts of 11 September 2001.\r\nThere is no doubt that the United Nations has become\r\nmore irrelevant, that some seek to declare the United\r\nNations Charter obsolete and that a de facto world\r\ndictatorship based on the use of force is being\r\nestablished.\r\nAs is well known, Cuba’s position is that the\r\nsystem of collective security, regulated in the Charter\r\nand governed by the central role of the United Nations,\r\nmust be restored, not discarded. The General Assembly\r\nmust now reaffirm, as it did in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, the full validity of the Charter, whose\r\npurposes and principles, including the principles of the\r\nsovereign equality of States, respect for the political\r\nindependence of nations and non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of States, must be applied without\r\nrestriction.\r\nIt should be reiterated that States must refrain\r\nfrom the use of force and threatening to use force and\r\nin every case, must strictly abide by the provisions of\r\nthe Charter and serve only the common interest. We\r\nshould defend multilateralism, which presupposes full\r\nrespect for international law and democracy in\r\ninternational relations.\r\nThe Security Council’s primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security\r\nmust be restored with full respect for the United\r\nNations Charter. There must be profound reform of its\r\nprocedures, including the use of the veto, and an\r\nexpansion of its membership, among both permanent\r\nand non-permanent members.\r\nThe General Assembly must resume its broad\r\npowers under the Charter, including those derived from\r\nparalysis of the Security Council, to reject the use of\r\nforce to achieve political objectives and to emphasize\r\nthat only peaceful settlement of disputes can lead to\r\nsecurity, stability, justice and democracy throughout\r\nthe world.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration must be implemented\r\nto the fullest extent concerning the elimination of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear\r\nweapons, in order to reduce the part they play in\r\nsecurity doctrines and policies, and to halt their\r\ndevelopment and stockpiling. We must also refrain\r\nfrom developing new highly lethal conventional\r\nweapons and from the militarization of outer space.\r\nAs for the Millennium proposals and challenges,\r\nthe blockade against Cuba has been strengthened, and\r\nits extraterritorial effects have expanded. The\r\nmanipulation of Cuban purchases of foodstuffs from\r\nthe United States to show that the blockade has been\r\npartially lifted has done nothing but show the genocidal\r\nnature of this blockade, which three years after the\r\nMillennium Summit still includes medicine and food.\r\nAs stated in the Millennium Declaration,\r\n“only through broad and sustained efforts to\r\ncreate a shared future, based upon our common\r\nhumanity in all its diversity, can globalization be\r\nmade fully inclusive and equitable. These efforts\r\nmust include policies and measures, at the global\r\nlevel, which correspond to the needs of developing\r\ncountries …”. (resolution 55/2, para. 5)\r\nIt further states that “We will spare no effort to\r\nfree our fellow men, women and children from the\r\nabject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty\r\n…” (para. 11).\r\nThe meagre — still unfulfilled — commitments\r\nand numerous conditionalities adopted at Monterrey,\r\nthe empty promises of Doha and the recent failure in\r\nCancún do not seem to be in keeping with the\r\naforementioned appeal. For every miserable dollar of\r\nofficial development assistance, six dollars of debt\r\nservice is extracted from a debt that continues to grow.\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nThe gap between the North and the South has widened,\r\nand the digital divide is growing as well.\r\nNo group of States, whether rich or poor, will be\r\nmore secure in a world where 800 million people go\r\nhungry, where 1.2 billion live on less than a dollar per\r\nday and where 115 million children, three fifths of\r\nthem girls, do not have access to education. There are\r\n876 million people in the world who are illiterate, two\r\nthirds of whom are female. More than 11 million\r\nchildren die each year from preventable diseases, and\r\nmore than 500,000 women a year die in pregnancy or\r\nin childbirth. Of the 42 million people who suffer from\r\nHIV/AIDS, 39 million are from the developing world.\r\nTuberculosis and malaria cause 3 million deaths each\r\nyear; one out of every five individuals does not have\r\naccess to drinking water; and 2.4 billion human beings\r\ndo not have proper sanitary facilities. Is this the\r\nMillennium Declaration’s international partnership for\r\ndevelopment?\r\nAfrica needs financing from the former colonial\r\nPowers, not prescriptions or advice. There will be no\r\npeace, security or stability without development. There\r\nwill not even be any prosperity for the affluent\r\nsocieties if there is no development in the countries of\r\nthe South.\r\nUnder the unjust, exclusive and unsustainable\r\ninternational order that afflicts us, with an international\r\nfinancial architecture that aids in the plundering of our\r\ncountries, the Millennium Goals are pure fantasy.\r\nSolutions are feasible. The debt, which has been\r\nrepaid many times over, should be cancelled. The\r\npromise to devote 0.7 per cent of gross national\r\nproduct to official development assistance must be\r\nkept. Resources must be made available from the sale\r\nof arms, from speculative financial transactions and\r\nfrom advertising in order to meet the overwhelming\r\nneeds of the developing countries. Agricultural\r\nsubsidies in the countries of the North must end.\r\nMonopolization of the intellectual property of medical\r\nresources essential to life must end.\r\nWhat has happened with the Kyoto Protocol on\r\nclimate change? What progress has been made since the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development took place in\r\nJohannesburg? Deterioration of the environment\r\nassociated with irrational consumption by the\r\nindustrialized countries means that the rich and the\r\npoor will be left with a common fate.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration we promised that\r\n“We will spare no effort to promote\r\ndemocracy and strengthen the rule of law, as well\r\nas respect for all internationally recognized\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms,\r\nincluding the right to development.” (para. 24)\r\nThe General Assembly must appeal for\r\ncooperation and constructive dialogue to promote and\r\nprotect all human rights, which are indivisible,\r\ninterdependent and interrelated and should be enjoyed\r\nby all individuals and peoples. It should undertake\r\nconcrete action to find peaceful solutions to\r\ninternational humanitarian problems, in strict\r\ncompliance with the principles and norms of\r\ninternational law and international humanitarian law.\r\nThe politicization of human rights is nothing new\r\nin the proceedings of the Commission on Human Rights.\r\nIt is unfair to criticize the developing countries for\r\ndefending their concepts, rights or legitimate interests.\r\nPoliticization was imposed long ago by the developed\r\ncountries which, as a bloc, promoted double standards,\r\nselective approaches and unequal treatment on the\r\nbasis of their political agendas, their narrow national\r\ninterests, and sometimes even because of the foreign\r\ndemands that most of them have themselves endured.\r\nIndustrialized countries that are truly interested in\r\nfruitful dialogue and in settling disputes and problems\r\nin the area of human rights by means of cooperation, as\r\ncalled for in the Millennium Declaration, must\r\nunderstand that those who support hegemony will also\r\naffect their own interests.\r\nThe treatment of the subject of human rights in\r\nthe section of the report of the Secretary-General on\r\npeace and security, specifically with regard to\r\nsanctions, seems to acknowledge that the Security\r\nCouncil exercises functions that in fact belong to the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, and absolutely not to the Security Council.\r\nDemocracy and civil and political rights have\r\nalso fallen victim to the so-called global war against\r\nterrorism. In addition to the crisis in the political\r\nsystem, the lack of credibility of politicians and\r\nabstention in elections in industrialized countries, there\r\nis now irrefutable data on the manipulation of\r\ninformation and public opinion and on the exclusion of\r\ncitizens from the decision-making process in\r\nGovernments that supposedly represent them.\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nThe Cuban delegation supports the proposal to\r\norganize a United Nations conference in 2005 to\r\nreview in full the implementation of the commitments\r\nmade in the Millennium Declaration, in the hope that\r\nthis would be a second opportunity to fulfil the Goals.\r\nMs. Enkhtsetseg (Mongolia): My delegation\r\nwishes to commend the Secretary-General on his\r\nthought-provoking reports on implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (A/58/323) and on the\r\nwork of the Organization (A/58/1). Mongolia\r\nassociates itself with the statement delivered earlier by\r\nthe representative of Morocco on behalf of the Group\r\nof 77 and China.\r\nAs seen in the report of the Secretary-General on\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration\r\n(A/58/323), the results of the first three years have\r\nbeen mixed and uneven. For every goal, whether\r\nrelating to peace and security, to development or to\r\nhuman rights and democracy, there are encouraging\r\nsigns of progress in some areas along with worrying\r\nevidence of stagnation or even reversal in others. But\r\none of the important conclusions we can all draw from\r\nthe report is that the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nas ambitious as they are, can still be achieved at both\r\nnational and global levels if there is sufficient political\r\nwill. There is, therefore, a clear need for political leaders\r\nto sustain the current momentum in order to avoid\r\nsetbacks and accelerate progress in the coming years.\r\nThe crucial importance of forging strategic\r\npartnerships at both national and international levels and\r\nof active participation by all stakeholders in implementing\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals was strongly\r\nhighlighted at the Fifth International Conference of\r\nNew or Restored Democracies, held last month in the\r\ncapital city of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar. One of the three\r\nthematic sessions of the conference, which was\r\nattended by the representatives of 119 Governments and a\r\nhost of international organizations and civil society\r\norganizations, was held under the sub-theme of\r\n“Partnership and participation in poverty reduction and\r\nattainment of the United Nations Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals”. The main conclusions and\r\nfindings of the thematic session have been reflected in\r\nthe final outcome documents; the Ulaanbaatar\r\nDeclaration and Plan of Action on Democracy, Good\r\nGovernance and Civil Society. The detailed report on\r\nthe result of this conference and its follow-up will be\r\ndelivered to the General Assembly by my Government\r\nearly next month, when the Assembly considers the\r\nrelevant agenda item.\r\nNational reports on the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, in our view, serve as an important tool in\r\nmeasuring progress made and ensuring that the\r\nMillennium Development Goals remain at the heart of\r\ndevelopment efforts. It is encouraging that around 40\r\ncountries have completed their national Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals reports and that an additional 60\r\nreports are expected by the end of this year. I am pleased\r\nto inform the General Assembly that the Government of\r\nMongolia is being actively engaged in finalizing its\r\nfirst Millennium Development Goals report.\r\nIn preparing its national Millennium Development\r\nGoals report, my Government has undertaken a series of\r\npreparatory activities over the past two years. In 2001,\r\nwhen we observed the fortieth anniversary of\r\nMongolia’s membership of the United Nations, a joint\r\nconference was organized under the theme of “Forty\r\nyears of Mongolia-United Nations cooperation:\r\nImplementation of the Millennium Declaration,” the\r\nmain findings of which were subsequently included in\r\nmy Government’s memorandum submitted at the fifty-\r\nsixth session of the General Assembly.\r\nIn June 2002 we set up a national task force on\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals composed of key\r\nministries, the National Statistical Office, academia\r\nand civil society organizations, and entrusted with task\r\nof tailoring the Millennium Development Goals to the\r\nnational context, improving the statistical database and\r\nthe system of evaluation and monitoring of progress\r\nand drafting the report through a broad-based\r\nconsultative process. The first draft of the report was\r\nextensively discussed at a national consultative\r\nmeeting held last August among all the stakeholders,\r\nincluding our bilateral and multilateral partners, civil\r\nsociety and the private sector. The views expressed at\r\nthe meeting and its conclusions have been incorporated\r\ninto the report.\r\nThe report contains overall information on the\r\ncurrent status and measures undertaken by the\r\nGovernment to implement the eight Development\r\nGoals and the 16 targets. It also outlines the major\r\nchallenges, obstacles and priorities for future activities\r\nand development assistance under each Goal. The\r\nGovernment of Mongolia has made poverty reduction\r\nits key priority, committing itself to the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goal target of halving absolute poverty\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nby 2015. Further, it has pledged to meet the poverty\r\nreduction criteria specified in our Poverty Reduction\r\nPartnership Agreement with the Asian Development\r\nBank. We have also finalized our Poverty Reduction\r\nStrategy Paper emphasizing a private-sector-led growth\r\nstrategy and increased social spending in the context of\r\nmacroeconomic stabilization.\r\nThe Government adopted a national programme\r\non supporting household livelihood as a second phase\r\nof its poverty reduction programme. To effectively\r\nreduce poverty, my Government has identified core\r\nstrategies including the following: ensuring sustained\r\neconomic growth, addressing urban poverty and\r\ndisparity, active engagement of local communities and\r\ncivil society organizations in anti-poverty activities,\r\nnatural disaster and risk management, and provision of\r\nadequate social protection.\r\nMy delegation believes that national reports on\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals will be important\r\nin the review of the progress of implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals scheduled for 2005. In\r\nthat respect, we believe that it might be advisable to\r\nrequest Member States to periodically report to the\r\nSecretary-General on their national progress, so that a\r\ncomprehensive picture can be available for review.\r\nLast week and the week before, in the general\r\ndebate, the heads of our delegations reaffirmed their\r\nfaith in the United Nations and agreed on the urgent\r\nneed to take decisive measures so that this world\r\nOrganization is adequately equipped to effectively\r\naddress the formidable challenges, both existing and\r\nevolving. My delegation fully shares the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s view that “Member States need … to take a\r\nhard look at the existing ‘architecture’ of international\r\ninstitutions” (A/58/323, para. 91) and “consider\r\nreaching swift agreement on [reform] as a national\r\ninterest of the highest order” (para. 98).\r\nThe reform measures in our review ought to\r\ninclude the revitalization of the General Assembly and\r\na rationalization of its agenda, the enlargement and\r\ndemocratization of the Security Council, the\r\nreinvigoration of the Economic and Social Council, a\r\nreview of the interrelationship of the United Nations\r\nwith the Bretton Woods institutions and a review of the\r\nrole of the Trusteeship Council in the light of the new\r\nresponsibilities entrusted upon the world Organization\r\nover the recent past.\r\nMongolia supports the idea of setting the year\r\n2005, when the international community is to review\r\nthe progress achieved in implementing all the\r\ncommitments made in the Millennium Declaration, as a\r\ntarget date for reaching agreement on the reform\r\nmeasures. In that regard, my delegation looks forward\r\nto receiving the results and recommendations to be\r\ndeveloped by the high-level panel of eminent\r\npersonalities and to actively working with our fellow\r\nnations during both the current and upcoming sessions\r\nof the General Assembly towards revitalizing the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, I assure the President of my\r\ndelegation’s full support and cooperation in\r\ndischarging his onerous task.\r\nMr. Mubarez (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nreports of the Secretary-General before the Assembly\r\nprovide us with many facts on the work of the\r\nOrganization during the past year, and on follow-up to\r\nthe outcome of the Millennium Summit. The two\r\nreports provide the facts within a context that allows\r\nfor an assessment of the achievements and a clear\r\nvision of the future. We can only commend both\r\nreports. We agree with the introduction of the report on\r\nthe work of the Organization (A/58/1) that this has\r\nbeen a trying year for the United Nations. The war in\r\nIraq has seriously tested the principle of collective\r\nsecurity, on which the Organization is based. The\r\nSecretary-General expressed that very clearly, along\r\nwith the general observation that multilateral\r\ninternational action has been undermined by unilateral\r\naction on the part of some, which runs counter to the\r\nrequirements of joint action and collective security.\r\nIf the statements to which we have listened thus\r\nfar accurately reflect international public opinion and\r\ninternational will, the overwhelming majority of United\r\nNations Member States reaffirm the importance of\r\ncollective work in facing common challenges and of\r\nharmonizing national interests, which are daily\r\nbecoming more complex and intertwined. My country\r\nhas always been firmly convinced that the best way to\r\nmeet collective security challenges and the demands of\r\nglobalization is through multilateral efforts on the part\r\nof regional and international organizations, particularly\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nWe have noted with satisfaction the\r\nOrganization’s efforts in the past year in the political,\r\neconomic and humanitarian areas to implement the\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nrelevant resolutions. However, a lack of consensus has\r\ncaused peace and security efforts to falter, as the report\r\nnoted, which in turn has negatively affected\r\ninternational relations — beginning with the tragic\r\nevents of 11 September 2001 and ending with the\r\noccupation of Iraq — in addition to differences of\r\nvisions, conflicts of interest and hesitation to shoulder\r\nthe responsibility and demands for collective security\r\nand to meet the requirements of peace. All of that has\r\naffected the nature of international relations and the\r\ncredibility and role of the United Nations in particular.\r\nHowever, the undermining of the Organization, its\r\nrole and its credibility has not been caused by those\r\nevents alone. Israel has challenged and damaged\r\ninternational unity and the Organization and international\r\nlegitimacy for more than four decades with its\r\ncontinued occupation of Arab territories and its\r\ncoercive actions against their inhabitants, in addition to\r\nits continued refusal to subject its nuclear facilities to\r\ninternational monitoring and its repeated aggression\r\nagainst its neighbours, the latest of which was its\r\naggression against Syria. If the terrorist acts suffered\r\nby the United States in September 2001 raised\r\nawareness of the danger that terrorism poses to\r\ncollective security, the fight against that scourge has\r\nbeen faltering, with major differences on basic\r\nprinciples. Moreover, the fight against terrorism has\r\naddressed only terrorism’s manifestations, not its root\r\ncauses, and it has failed to distinguish between\r\nterrorism and the legitimate right of peoples to resist\r\nforeign occupation. The Secretary-General warned\r\nabout that in his report on the work of the Organization\r\nwhen he stated,\r\n“there is no trade-off between human rights and\r\nsecurity: respecting human rights must be a\r\nfundamental element in the fight against\r\nterrorism. Promoting values of tolerance and the\r\ndialogue among civilizations is also of paramount\r\nimportance.” (A/58/1, para. 63)\r\nMuch important progress has been achieved in the\r\narea of respect for human rights, as the report states.\r\nHowever, practical implementation has encountered\r\nmany difficulties because of the primacy of narrow\r\ninterests and political considerations over commitments\r\nand moral and humanitarian principles. In that regard,\r\nwe note that in his report on implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration the Secretary-General stated\r\nthat “in the area of human rights and democracy there\r\nis a danger that we may retreat from some of the\r\nimportant gains made in the previous decade”\r\n(A/58/323, para. 3). The report also pointed out that the\r\nobviously slow pace in implementing the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals can be attributed to a lack of the\r\nclear vision and political will needed to truly improve\r\nthe lives of people in developing countries. The United\r\nNations remains the principal forum for international\r\naction and all countries are aware that there is a need\r\nfor basic reform in the Organization so it can meet\r\nfuture challenges and adapt to the ever-accelerating\r\nchanges in international relations.\r\nIn that connection, we support the concepts and\r\nproposals made since the Millennium Declaration to\r\nintroduce basic reforms into the Organization. In\r\nparticular, we welcome the Secretary-General’s initiative\r\nof establishing a panel of eminent personalities to set\r\nout a specific plan for reform aimed at ensuring broad\r\nparticipation representing a wide spectrum of opinion.\r\nFor our part, we reaffirm our readiness to cooperate\r\nwith the President of the General Assembly in ensuring\r\nthat the work of this session provides a real impetus for\r\nour common endeavour.\r\nMr. Lamba (Malawi): This timely and important\r\ndebate on the follow-up to the Millennium Summit and\r\non the work of the Organization provides an\r\nopportunity to assess fulfilment of the declared\r\ncommitments of Member States. The Millennium\r\nSummit, whose outcomes were the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nrepresented a unique occasion and effort that\r\nunderlined for us the challenges and goals of creating a\r\nworld characterized by development, peace and\r\nsecurity. To that end, Malawi welcomes the reports of\r\nthe Secretary-General now before the Assembly.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report on the work of the\r\nOrganization in document A/58/1 presents a lucid\r\npicture of tasks facing the United Nations and of\r\nprogress achieved. In this debate, as the report\r\nsuggested, we must focus our attention on\r\nstrengthening the Organization by taking a measured\r\nassessment of what has happened, reflecting on the sort\r\nof Organization we want in the future and beginning to\r\nmake the necessary changes.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration clearly spelled out a\r\ndevelopment agenda that must be pursued by the\r\nUnited Nations in the fight against poverty and other\r\nproblems facing the world today. The attainment of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals will depend largely on\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nhow much progress we achieve in implementing the\r\noutcomes of major United Nations conferences such as\r\nthe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, held at Monterrey; the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, at Johannesburg; the Third\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed\r\nCountries, at Brussels; and the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development, held at Copenhagen. The collapse\r\nof the recent World Trade Organization Ministerial\r\nConference at Cancún is a sad commentary on the\r\nextent of the North-South partnership.\r\nAs indicated in the Millennium Declaration,\r\nAfrica — the continent most affected by poverty,\r\nhunger, the HIV/AIDS pandemic and violent\r\nconflicts — requires special attention. Poverty will find\r\nits solution in full implementation of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). While\r\nthe United Nations endorsed NEPAD as the vehicle for\r\npromoting Africa’s development, that positive step\r\nmust be matched with a flow of the requisite resources\r\nfor its implementation. In fact, tangible support for the\r\naccomplishment of Africa’s development agenda under\r\nNEPAD should include trade liberalization and the\r\ncancelling of external debt, in addition to achievement\r\nof the official development assistance target of 0.7 per\r\ncent of gross national product, in order to eradicate\r\nextreme poverty on our continent.\r\nThere is no denying that peace and security are\r\nprerequisites for any meaningful development. As we\r\ndeal with the threats posed by weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and the question of terrorism, let us not\r\nlose sight of the devastating impact of small arms and\r\nlight weapons on global peace and security. The United\r\nNations, working in partnership with Member States,\r\nshould deal decisively with the question of small arms\r\nand light weapons.\r\nMalawi remains committed to the fight against\r\nterrorism, as demonstrated by the Government’s recent\r\nratification of and accession to four United Nations\r\nconventions pertaining to the fight against terrorism.\r\nHowever, while the Government has demonstrated a\r\nstrong commitment to the fight against terrorism, the\r\neffectiveness of actions in that regard hinges on the\r\navailability of capacity and resources for the\r\nimplementation of the conventions. In this regard, we\r\nlook forward to the support and cooperation of the\r\ninternational community in the fight against terrorism, in\r\nparticular with regard to the development of capacities\r\nand provision of resources for combating the scourge.\r\nAchieving peace and security should be the\r\npreponderant concern in any effort geared towards\r\nhuman development in an environment of democracy\r\nand human rights. The world continues to witness\r\nterrorism, both national and international, as well as\r\ncivil armed conflicts, all of which have rendered\r\nproductive life impossible, as people suffer\r\ndisplacement, destitution and deprivation. Global peace\r\nand development will always be beyond reach unless\r\nMember States show synergy in taking appropriate\r\nmultilateral measures while respecting justice. Wars are\r\ncreating food crises and poverty, particularly in Africa,\r\nwhich are threatening peace and security. Malawi\r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s strategy of varying\r\nthe United Nations approach to peace and security so\r\nas to include preventive diplomacy, peacemaking,\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building.\r\nThe issue of Iraq — both before and after the\r\nMarch 2003 war — has challenged the United Nations\r\nimmeasurably, making clear the flaws of war as a\r\nsolution to problems. Just before the war, Malawi\r\naffirmed, on behalf of the African Group, the need for\r\nresilience and restraint to avert armed conflict, which\r\nseemed imminent. At that point, multilateralism had\r\neffectively been suspended. The United Nations was\r\nturned into a concerned observer. Today, although the\r\nfield combat in Iraq was declared to be over on 1 May\r\n2003, peace continues to elude every person in Iraq.\r\nThe recent tragic attack against the United Nations in\r\nBaghhad and the death of United Nations staff\r\nmembers, the daily guerrilla activity and the deaths of\r\nallied military personnel remind us that, without the\r\nleadership of the United Nations, total peace in Iraq\r\nwill not be an easy to achieve.\r\nIn the area of conflict resolution, Malawi pays\r\ntribute to the role of the United Nations in the various\r\nconflict zones. In Africa, the Organization’s visibility\r\nin Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, Sierra Leone, Liberia and the Horn of Africa\r\nhas enhanced peace. The same can be said of other\r\nparts of the world, as the United Nations works to\r\nachieve synergy with regional organizations. However,\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building, which characterize\r\nthe post-conflict period, constitute a delicate phase,\r\nrequiring the practical goodwill of the whole\r\ninternational community. Malawi’s contribution to\r\npeacekeeping operations in Africa and elsewhere\r\nunderlines its solid support for peace and security.\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nMalawi believes that the new challenges to peace\r\nand security, including international terrorism, can be\r\nfully addressed only through international partnerships.\r\nTo that end, Malawi encourages the United Nations to\r\naddress regional conflicts through its collaboration\r\nwith the European Union, NATO, the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States, the Inter-\r\nGovernmental Authority on Development, the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community, the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations and the Organization of\r\nAmerican States.\r\nThe United Nations today is the supreme custodian\r\nof the international peace agenda. The major task of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, therefore, remains the identification\r\nof potent ways to strengthen, rather than weaken, it.\r\nThe United Nations and its Security Council have\r\nrecently suffered from a loss of credibility and\r\neffectiveness in the face of certain conflicts, including\r\nthat in Iraq. However, it is gratifying to note that the\r\nlost credibility has returned to the United Nations and\r\nsome faith in it has been restored.\r\nNo single nation today can claim to have the\r\ncapacity to resolve, single-handedly, an armed conflict\r\nof the magnitude of that in the Middle East. The United\r\nNations role with regard to the Palestinian problem,\r\ntherefore, must continue to be visible, with international\r\nsupport being provided through the Quartet.\r\nIn the area of humanitarian commitment, the\r\ncommendable performance of the United Nations,\r\nworking through its agencies, has registered conspicuous\r\nsuccesses with regard to situations of natural disaster,\r\ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS, war and forced\r\ndisplacement. Sub-Saharan Africa is today home to\r\n29.4 million people infected with HIV/AIDS. These\r\nproblems together form a cycle of hopelessness made\r\nworse by poverty.\r\nWhile acknowledging the invaluable and crucial\r\nrole of the United Nations in the coordination of\r\nassistance and the protection of civilians in armed\r\nconflict, Malawi requests the timely delivery of such\r\nassistance.\r\nGiven the magnitude of the poverty suffered by\r\nmost countries — exacerbated by the destabilizing\r\neffects of threats to peace and security — development\r\nin those countries could well remain an illusion.\r\nAccording to the Secretary-General’s report, critical\r\nelements to promote development include enhanced\r\nand increased financing for development; private sector\r\ncooperation; the success of trade negotiations; the\r\nalleviation of urban and rural poverty; secure access to\r\nfood, good health and education; improved\r\ngovernance; opportunities for impoverished women;\r\nand the acquisition of communication technologies.\r\nMalawi suffers from extreme poverty, which hampers\r\nthe realization of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe United Nations must continue to work creatively to\r\nreduce, with international support, the gap between the\r\nrich and the poor.\r\nIn conclusion, Malawi commends the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his two comprehensive reports and for the\r\nstrategies that he has outlined. Malawi reiterates that the\r\nUnited Nations is the supreme multilateral Organization\r\ncompetent to address global issues through collective\r\napproaches and shared responsibility.\r\nMr. Hannesson (Iceland): It is with great pleasure\r\nthat the Icelandic delegation congratulates Mr. Hunte\r\non his election as President of the General Assembly.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his reports on\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration\r\n(A/58/323) and on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/58/1), which reflect the challenges that the United\r\nNations faces in a turbulent and unpredictable world\r\nand which together cover the entire agenda of the\r\nOrganization. In his introduction to his report on the\r\nwork of the Organization, the Secretary-General\r\ncorrectly points out that the United Nations is not an\r\nend in itself but rather an instrument for achieving\r\ncommon ends.\r\nIn the general debate at the beginning of this\r\nfifty-eighth session, we heard a resounding message:\r\nnow is the time to reform the United Nations system\r\nand to ensure that it will serve contemporary and future\r\ngenerations in an effective and relevant manner.\r\nIceland welcomes and supports the initiative of\r\nthe Secretary-General to establish a high-level panel of\r\neminent personalities to make the necessary\r\nrecommendations for the future of our common\r\nOrganization. Now we need men and women of\r\nwisdom and experience, of vision and courage to\r\nsecure the future of the United Nations. They will need\r\nto address a number of issues, including, first, the role\r\nand status of the General Assembly as the chief policy-\r\nmaking body of the United Nations and, secondly, the\r\nneed for a more open, more representative Security\r\nCouncil, reflecting the views of the States Members of\r\nthe United Nations nearly 60 years after its foundation.\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nThirdly, by adopting the best in information\r\ntechnology, the United Nations will not only be a more\r\neffective and open organization; it can also help in\r\nbridging the information divide in the world.\r\nWe may not realize in our daily work at the\r\nUnited Nations that this is an organization in constant\r\nflux. Some changes are minor adjustments; others, such\r\nas the adoption of the Millennium Declaration, are\r\nmilestones. The United Nations must continue\r\nadjusting to an ever-changing world.\r\nThe objectives ahead are clear. What is now on\r\nthe agenda is implementation. We align ourselves with\r\nthe statement of the European Union on the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on implementation of the United\r\nNations Millennium Declaration, in particular its\r\nstatement that the values we seek are best guaranteed\r\nthrough effective multilateralism.\r\nLet us not wait, but let us heed the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call for these urgent and timely changes and\r\nreforms. In that connection, I would like to refer to the\r\nwords of Mr. Halldor Ásgrímsson, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Iceland; in his recent address to the\r\nAssembly, he said that we must craft for ourselves a\r\nUnited Nations that is task-oriented, representative,\r\nfocused and coordinated. Iceland believes that the\r\nopportunity is here, and that the moment is now.\r\nMr. Schori (Sweden): Let me begin by\r\nemphasizing that Sweden fully aligns itself with the\r\nstatement made by Italy on behalf of the European\r\nUnion. I can therefore be brief.\r\nThere is a window of opportunity for reform\r\nduring this session of the General Assembly. The call for\r\nfurther reform of the United Nations was again brought\r\nto the Assembly by the Secretary-General through his\r\nreport on implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration (A/58/323) and his statement at the\r\nopening of this session of the General Assembly. A\r\nvast majority of the speakers during the general debate\r\nalso agreed on the necessity of making reform happen.\r\nSweden would like to underline its support for the\r\nSecretary-General’s initiative to establish a panel of\r\neminent personalities. Its establishment challenges us\r\nto work with even more determination to achieve\r\ntangible results in the areas that the Secretary-General\r\nhas rightly pointed to as fundamental to the work of the\r\nOrganization. We look forward to an active dialogue\r\nwith the panel.\r\nBut we cannot just await the results of the panel’s\r\nwork. Reform must be brought forward now — indeed,\r\nduring this session. The Assembly can be revitalized. It\r\nis a matter of political will. There is no lack of\r\nconstructive ideas. Sweden encourages the President of\r\nthe General Assembly to further this part of the reform\r\nagenda and to put concrete suggestions before the\r\nAssembly. He can count on our support in this.\r\nIf we wish the General Assembly to be a vigorous\r\nactor in the international political arena, we should take\r\ntime to reflect on its modus operandi. We in the\r\nAssembly must ask ourselves whether the draft\r\nresolutions that we traditionally introduce —\r\nsometimes with very few changes from year to year —\r\nserve their intended purpose and reflect the current\r\nsituation. Is the best way to influence the situation to\r\nroutinely request another report from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral? In some cases we could — and should —\r\nconsider biennializing or triennializing resolutions,\r\ndiscontinuing some of our initiatives, or changing their\r\nfocus. That way, we would also ease the burden of the\r\nSecretariat so that it could better focus on current and\r\nmore urgent requests from the Assembly.\r\nReform of the Security Council — that is, its\r\nenlargement — is essential, even inevitable, if we want\r\nthe Council to stay relevant. Rather than trying to find\r\nthe optimal solution now for decades to come, we\r\nshould accept that any reform may have to be re-\r\nthought, in five or 10 years’ time. Such reform would\r\nclearly signal that the United Nations is prepared to\r\nadapt and adjust in order to safeguard its authority in\r\nworld politics. We will return to this item in greater\r\ndepth during next week’s discussions in the Assembly.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals represent a\r\nunique opportunity for the world’s countries to work\r\ntogether for equitable and sustainable global and national\r\ndevelopment. The eighth Millennium Development Goal\r\nis unique, as it represents a true partnership between\r\ndeveloping and developed countries. Indeed, together\r\nwith the Monterrey Consensus, it implies a contract of\r\nmutual obligations. The policies and actions relating to\r\nthe eighth Millennium Development Goal — and thus\r\nprimarily to us in the developed countries — should be\r\nmade more precise. We support the call of the\r\nSecretary-General for a firm timetable with built-in\r\ndeadlines.\r\nRich countries such as Sweden should be\r\nobligated to report on their progress towards achieving\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, especially\r\nconcerning the agenda of the eighth Goal. It is a matter\r\nof responsibility, credibility and donor accountability.\r\nAn international framework for reporting on the eighth\r\nMillennium Development Goal must be designed and\r\nimplemented.\r\nThe Government of Sweden has presented to its\r\nParliament a bill on a policy for global development;\r\npolicy coherence and donor accountability are at its\r\nheart. What used to be primarily the task of\r\ndevelopment cooperation is now a task for the entire\r\nGovernment. This is a pioneering change. The bill will\r\nprovide Sweden with a solid platform to take an even\r\nstronger and more active part in contributing to the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nWe will not miss that opportunity.\r\nMr. Sagach (Ukraine): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of GUUAM States: the Republic of Azerbaijan,\r\nGeorgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine.\r\nAt the historic Millennium Summit and at the\r\nSecurity Council Summit the leaders of United Nations\r\nMember States adopted two milestone declarations,\r\nenriched by the half-century experience of an\r\nOrganization that embodied our common hopes and\r\nexpectations for living in the twenty-first century, in a\r\nmore secure and just world.\r\nHowever, subsequent developments in the world\r\nbrought new and daunting challenges before the\r\ninternational community. Three years after the\r\nmillennium events, we find ourselves at the point\r\nwhere the very credibility of the United Nations and its\r\nability to deal with old and new challenges are\r\nquestioned.\r\nI would like to thank the Secretary-General for\r\nthe preparation of his comprehensive and thought-\r\nprovoking report on implementation of the United\r\nNations Millennium Declaration (A/58/323), in which\r\nhe raises many issues of great importance for the future\r\nof both this Organization and the world as a whole. It is\r\nour common responsibility to find answers to those\r\nquestions if we truly want to see the goals of the\r\nMillennium Declaration achieved.\r\nYet earlier this year, the United Nations was\r\ndivided on the way to resolve the Iraqi crisis. We\r\nfirmly believe that the instruments of the United\r\nNations are very important for the normalization of the\r\nsituation in that country. Whatever the arguments were,\r\nwe must now come together for a common purpose: to\r\nrestore sovereignty to the Iraqi people as quickly as\r\npractically possible, to restore the law and order and to\r\nconduct large-scale reconstruction of the country. We\r\nhave a shared interest in helping Iraqi citizens embrace\r\nthe freedoms that they have been denied for so long\r\nand for which the United Nations was founded. Guided by\r\na sense of responsibility for the destiny of the Iraqi nation\r\nfor peace and security in the region, the GUUAM\r\nMember States dispatched their military contingents to\r\nthe Persian Gulf. We hope that the Security Council\r\nwill agree soon on a new resolution to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations role in Iraq, including by providing the\r\nnecessary arrangements in the area of security.\r\nGUUAM strongly supports the need to strengthen\r\nthe United Nations, as the major forum for international\r\ncooperation and for achieving collective decisions on\r\nissues of common concern and on its ability to deal\r\nwith them. GUUAM welcomes the intention of the\r\nSecretary-General to establish a high-level panel of\r\neminent personalities to examine current challenges to\r\npeace and security and to provide, before the next\r\nsession of the General Assembly, recommendations on\r\nways to strengthen United Nations response to those\r\nchallenges.\r\nWe have witnessed significant changes achieved\r\nin the implementation of the recommendations of a\r\nsimilar panel, chaired by Ambassador Brahimi, on\r\npeacekeeping reform. In this area, the United Nations\r\nhas the capacity today to act, and it already acts more\r\nflexibly, rapidly and effectively. We hope that the\r\nrecent discussions and actions in the area of conflict\r\nprevention will bring us closer to establishing an\r\ninternational system capable of the timely and efficient\r\nprevention of armed conflicts. This dimension should\r\nbe pivotal in the philosophy of future United Nations\r\nactivities.\r\nGUUAM firmly condemns terrorism in all its\r\nmanifestations. Our countries joined the anti-terrorist\r\ncoalition from the very beginning and have made a\r\nsignificant contribution to its activities. As the threat of\r\nterrorism to international peace and security requires\r\nsustained, long-term and global action, this\r\nOrganization continues to play the central role in\r\nfacilitating intergovernmental cooperation in the fight\r\nagainst it, as well as in strengthening the capacity of\r\neach nation’s legislation and executive machinery to\r\ncombat terrorism.\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nToday we may say that the GUUAM States are\r\ntaking part in the implementation of all 12 universal\r\nanti-terrorist conventions through, inter alia,\r\nappropriate bilateral and multilateral mechanisms. The\r\nsummary report on GUUAM counter-terrorism\r\nactivities was presented during the special meeting of\r\nthe Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee\r\nwith international, regional and subregional\r\norganizations, held last March.\r\nAnother issue to which I would like to draw the\r\nattention of Members relates to the problem of so-\r\ncalled frozen conflicts, which were left as unhealed\r\nscars in the new independent States that emerged after\r\nthe collapse of the Soviet Union. The international\r\ncommunity cannot turn a blind eye to the lack of\r\nprogress in the settlement of conflicts in Abkhazia,\r\nGeorgia; Nagorny-Karabakh, Republic of Azerbaijan;\r\nand Transdnistria, Republic of Moldova, which for a\r\ndecade have been destabilizing the situation in our\r\nregion. Postponing the final settlement of those crises\r\nmight have irreversible consequences. We call on the\r\nUnited Nations, the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe and other international\r\norganizations involved to accelerate their respective\r\nefforts to resolve those conflicts.\r\nSlight progress towards achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals has been made so far. More\r\nvigorous and coordinated efforts, both on the part of\r\nthe donor community and the recipient countries, are\r\nneeded. We believe that national ownership and\r\nleadership are critical for the successful implementation\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nIn the meantime, we need to strengthen our\r\ncapacities to prepare the Millennium Development\r\nGoals reports, consolidate information for a poverty-\r\nrelated index and provide analysis for policy-makers.\r\nTherefore, the GUUAM States stress the need to\r\noperationalize the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) poverty reduction trust fund to\r\nthis end.\r\nAs countries with economies in transition, the\r\nGUUAM States would greatly welcome the further\r\nstrengthening of the capacity of the United Nations\r\nsystem, under the overall coordination of the\r\nDevelopment Group, in the following areas: enhancing\r\nthe role of United Nations Resident Coordinators and\r\nstreamlining the UNDP-World Bank partnership\r\nformula at all levels; coordinating and monitoring the\r\nimplementation of the decisions taken at the United\r\nNations summits in Monterrey and Johannesburg;\r\nfurther promoting the Millennium Project, designed to\r\ndraw intellectual power to bring new ideas on how to\r\nspeed up attainment of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals; supplementing the efforts of national leadership\r\nthrough nurturing multistakeholder dialogue based on\r\nactive participation of the private sector, civil society\r\nand non-governmental organizations; and further\r\nmaintaining the Millennium campaign.\r\nIn a globalized world, a favourable external\r\nenvironment is no less important to sustainable\r\ndevelopment than is internal economic growth. Trade is\r\ncrucial to fostering growth and reducing poverty. While\r\ntwo of the GUUAM States — Georgia and the Republic\r\nof Moldova — are members of the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO), others — Ukraine, the Republic\r\nof Azerbaijan and the Republic of Uzbekistan — are\r\nstill in the process of accession. We urge the\r\ninternational community to facilitate accession of those\r\nStates to the WTO by providing special and differential\r\ntreatment terms that will contribute to intraregional\r\ntrade and will support national capacity-building.\r\nTaking into account the UNDP mandate in the field of\r\ntrade, we emphasize the importance of its involvement\r\nin the process of strengthening trade negotiation\r\ncapacities of acceding States.\r\nThe regional dimension cannot be overestimated\r\nin our development efforts. The Fifth Ministerial\r\nConference of the Environment for Europe, held in\r\nKiev this year, was a concrete follow-up to last year’s\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development. It proved\r\nsuccessful in further consolidating the pan-European\r\nenvironmental process and in promoting the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the Johannesburg\r\nSummit in the region of Eastern and Central Europe.\r\nThe so-called soft security threats of HIV/AIDS\r\nand Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the\r\nillegal traffic in narcotic drugs, as well as other threats,\r\ndemonstrate once again that, regardless of the\r\ndifferences countries may have, international\r\ncooperation is crucial to combating those challenges.\r\nEveryone is aware of the devastating impact of\r\ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis\r\nin a great number of countries, particularly in Africa.\r\nThe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\r\nMalaria, which was set up on the initiative of\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, has become an\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\neffective tool for implementing the integrated action\r\nplan in this area. We commend the convening of the\r\nhigh-level meetings of the General Assembly on\r\nHIV/AIDS, on 22 September, and we hope that it will\r\ngive further impetus to our joint efforts to overcome\r\nthis scourge.\r\nThis year marks the fifty-fifth anniversary of the\r\nunique document in the area of the promotion and the\r\nprotection of human rights — the Universal Declaration\r\nof Human Rights. Only 15 years before its historic\r\nadoption by the General Assembly, Ukrainians became\r\nthe victims of man-made famine, which was engineered\r\nas part of a totalitarian policy against the Ukrainian\r\npeople and which resulted in the death of at least 7\r\nmillion innocent men, women and children. We call\r\nupon all Members of the Assembly to support\r\nUkraine’s initiative for the United Nations to pay a\r\ntribute to the memory of those who perished. It is\r\ncrucial that such chapters of world history be known\r\nand remembered. Knowledge gives us the power to\r\nforesee future tragedies and to prevent them before it is\r\ntoo late.\r\nWith its universal mandate and huge potential, the\r\nUnited Nations has a leading role in pursuing the\r\nMillennium Declaration Goals. GUUAM stands ready\r\nto cooperate in their implementation with other\r\nMember States and the United Nations. We therefore\r\nwould greatly appreciate the support of all delegations\r\nto the request that GUUAM obtain observer status in\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Baduri (Eritrea): Allow me to seize this\r\nopportunity to express appreciation to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan for the comprehensive reports on\r\nthe work of the Organization (A/58/1) and on the\r\nfollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration (A/58/323). The reports are notable not only\r\nfor their clarity, precision and objective assessment, but\r\nalso for underscoring the myriad challenges that\r\nconfront the international community and the\r\nopportunities that could have been exploited by it.\r\nThe two reports make it amply clear that there is\r\na dialectical relationship between peace and\r\ndevelopment. Eritrea’s bitter experience during the past\r\nfour decades is only a tragic confirmation of this self-\r\nevident truth. Conflicts and war spawn instability.\r\nInstability causes socio-economic dislocation,\r\nstagnation and deterioration frustrates development\r\nefforts. Economic and social breakdown breeds\r\nextreme poverty that begets human insecurity. Lack of\r\nhuman security, broadly defined, is the primary root\r\ncause of conflict and war.\r\nThis has been the message that had informed the\r\nMillennium Declaration and subsequently the various\r\nsummits during the past few years, including, in\r\nparticular, the Monterrey, Doha and Johannesburg\r\nsummits. It is also the reason that makes the achievement\r\nof the Development Goals of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration central to any of our deliberations on either\r\npeace and security or development.\r\nThe achievement of these Goals demands\r\ncollective action for mutual benefit. Humanity must\r\ntherefore celebrate its unity by collectively confronting\r\nthe problems and challenges of the new millennium\r\nthat, it is now accepted, do not recognize international\r\nboundaries. It also acknowledges the imperative need\r\nfor the United Nations, which has an indispensable role\r\nto play in the promotion of both peace and\r\ndevelopment, to be sufficiently empowered to ensure\r\nsuccess. It is in this context that the Eritrean delegation\r\nshares the concern of the Secretary-General that,\r\nduring the past two years, achievements have seriously\r\nlagged behind the timetable set by the Millennium\r\nDeclaration to meet these Goals. It is also in this\r\ncontext that it wishes to address some of the issues\r\nraised in the two reports.\r\nRecent events confirm that the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction continues to pose a grave\r\nthreat to world peace and security. The destruction of\r\nthese weapons and their delivery systems remains\r\nessential to the protection and the promotion of\r\ninternational peace and security. Yet, humanity is also\r\nsuffering from the massive use of sophisticated\r\nconventional weapons, which have been used, even by\r\nthe poorest of countries, in attempts to suppress a\r\nmultiplicity of armed rebellions in their countries, as\r\nwell as to equip groups to commit hegemonic\r\naggression against their neighbours. Africa, and\r\nparticularly the Horn of Africa, has been one such zone\r\nof instability. These States, which have abandoned their\r\nconstitutional and international responsibilities to their\r\npeoples, region and the international community,\r\ncontinue to trigger ruinous arms races that wreak havoc\r\non themselves and their neighbours.\r\nTerrorism, transnational crime and drug\r\ntrafficking have also contributed to the erosion of\r\nhuman security. Terrorism, in particular, is now a major\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nthreat to peace and security and must be eradicated as\r\nsoon as possible, with the active participation of all\r\nhumanity. It is gratifying to note that the international\r\ncommunity has shown solidarity and assumed\r\ncollective responsibility in the fight against the\r\nscourge. Yet, it would be counter-productive and\r\nmeaningless to fight terrorism without addressing the\r\nroot causes of terrorism.\r\nIt is with satisfaction that the Eritrean delegation\r\nnotes the Secretary-General’s intent to shift focus from\r\nconflict response to conflict prevention. This will\r\nconstitute a major step forward in the search for peace\r\nand development. Unfortunately, the proposal for the\r\ncreation of a culture of conflict prevention does not, at\r\npresent, seem to be attracting much support, although it\r\nis eminently clear that prevention is more effective and\r\nmuch less costly than peacekeeping or peace-building.\r\nThis, however, does not mean that peacekeeping\r\nshould not be viewed as a major concern of our\r\nOrganization. The Eritrean delegation considers\r\npeacekeeping operations as a critical component of the\r\noverall mission of the United Nations to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security. The Eritrean\r\ndelegation has also taken note and, with a few\r\nexceptions, is supportive of the activities of the\r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations in the areas of\r\nplanning, management and support of peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nThe Secretary-General has repeatedly emphasized\r\nthat any attempt to implement the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals must, as a matter of priority,\r\naddress the disparities between the various regions of\r\nthe world. The Eritrean delegation notes with\r\nsatisfaction that Africa is being given the attention it\r\ndeserves. Of all the regions, Africa has been ravaged\r\nthe most by poverty, conflict and pandemics.\r\nUnfortunately, it shares the concerns already expressed\r\nin this debate that there has hardly been any progress\r\nmade in Africa to assure achievement of the\r\nDevelopment Goals and that conditions in some\r\ncountries have, in fact, deteriorated.\r\nNevertheless, it is our earnest hope that the\r\ndecisions and resolutions of the various summits and\r\nother meetings on economic development and\r\ninternational cooperation will be effectively\r\nimplemented to ensure the elimination of the obstacles\r\nthat have hitherto hindered economic growth and\r\nsustainable development. The problem of poverty\r\neradication, which has dominated the agenda of most\r\nof these meetings, must in particular be given urgent\r\nattention without minimizing the importance of foreign\r\ndirect investment, sustainable financing of external\r\ndebt, official development assistance and fair\r\ninternational trade.\r\nThe 2001 report of the World Health Organization\r\nclearly indicates that the current public health situation\r\nin third world countries is detrimental to their\r\ndevelopment. Consequently, investment in the health\r\nsector is critical, not only to improve health conditions,\r\nbut also to ensure human security, as envisaged in the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. A coordinated and\r\nholistic approach and international assistance are needed\r\nto meaningfully tackle the most threatening infectious\r\ndiseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and\r\nmalaria. The 2001 Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS is a good example of the type of approach\r\nand cooperation needed in any such effort, although no\r\nmajor progress has been achieved since that meeting.\r\nEritrea recognizes — if only because we have\r\nbeen fighting for our human rights for 30 years — that\r\nrespecting human rights is an expression of the noblest\r\nattributes of human nature. Human rights constitute the\r\nbedrock requirement for the realization of the Charter’s\r\nvision. We acknowledge the success of the United\r\nNations in bringing human rights to the forefront of its\r\nagenda and to prominence in international relations.\r\nHowever, the United Nations has ignored Eritreans’\r\npleas for the respect of their basic human right — their\r\nright to self-determination — and ignored the\r\ntrampling of their other human rights by successive\r\ncolonial Ethiopian Governments. We are gratified that\r\nhuman rights have assumed a rightfully central\r\nfunction in international relations, even as it is obvious\r\nthat this concept is abused and plagued by selective\r\nenforcement, double standards, politicization and\r\nholier-than-thou attitudes.\r\nMany regions of the world are affected today by\r\nhumanitarian crises caused by conflict and natural\r\ndisasters. Most of the countries affected belong to the\r\nthird world, in particular, Africa. While it is true that\r\nprogress has been made in the delivery of humanitarian\r\nassistance to these countries, it is also true that much\r\nmore needs to be done. It is therefore incumbent on the\r\nMembers of the United Nations to empower the\r\nOrganization and to actively cooperate with it, with a\r\nview to enabling it to act speedily and effectively in\r\nsituations of emergency, whether due to conflict,\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\ndrought, famine, displacement, natural disasters or\r\ninfectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS. Also, it would\r\nbe the height of moral and political insensitivity to\r\ndeliberately ignore the fact that all victims are equal.\r\nI wish to conclude by reiterating Eritrea’s avid\r\ninterest in the reform and strengthening of the United\r\nNations. The Eritrean delegation therefore welcomes\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the matter and\r\nshall contribute its views during the debate of the\r\nappropriate agenda item.\r\nMr. Aguilar Zinser (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nMy delegation supports the statement made yesterday\r\nby the permanent representative of Peru, on behalf of\r\nthe Rio Group, and therefore would simply like to add\r\na few comments on this topic.\r\nFirst, I would like to say that, as in the previous two\r\nyears, my delegation shares the concerns of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral regarding the uneven implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration. There still remain many\r\ndisparities in this area, and results in achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals have been mixed. In his\r\nrecent report, the Secretary-General indicated that, “In the\r\narea of peace and security, in particular, the consensus\r\nexpressed or implied in the Declaration now looks less\r\nsolid than it did three years ago” (A/58/323, para. 3).\r\nAt the same time, he points out that, “In the area of\r\ndevelopment, by contrast, a stronger consensus has been\r\nforged, but grave doubts remain as to whether Member\r\nStates are sufficiently determined to act on it” (ibid.).\r\nAs has also been said, there is a risk of stagnation\r\nor even reversal of progress in the areas of human\r\nrights and democracy. This picture has been further\r\ncomplicated by the events in recent months. Still, there\r\nare encouraging signs, such as the fact that, last year,\r\nprogress was made towards universal ratification of the\r\nsix main instruments governing human rights. As a\r\npromoter of the International Convention on the\r\nProtection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and\r\ntheir Families, Mexico welcomes the entry into force of\r\nthis instrument and hopes that more countries will\r\nadhere to it. We also view with satisfaction the fact that\r\nthe Assembly has unanimously adopted a resolution\r\nthat reiterates the importance of the fact that, in the\r\nfight against terrorism, human rights must be fully\r\nrespected.\r\nNationally, I am pleased to reiterate the fact that\r\nMexico has made headway in achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. As was indicated by the President of\r\nMexico, Vicente Fox, from this rostrum, we have adopted\r\nthese Goals as our own and have worked in all areas of\r\ndevelopment to achieve them, both within the proper\r\ntimeframes and in the proper way. We particularly\r\nemphasize the important — though, as yet, insufficient\r\n— progress that has been made in poverty reduction.\r\nAt the same time, we have continued to be\r\ncommitted to promoting and respecting human rights,\r\nand are moving forward to consolidate our democracy\r\nand eradicate the plague of corruption.\r\nMexico welcomes the fact that this rostrum has\r\nbeen used by the delegations participating in this\r\ndebate to reiterate their commitment to the reform of\r\nour Organization. We have listened here to many\r\nproposals, which deserve our consideration and on\r\nwhich we must come to decisions. We agree with the\r\nview of the Secretary-General when he says that the\r\nUnited Nations requires truly radical reform, with a\r\nview to responding to the many challenges and threats\r\nthat face the international community. We also agree\r\nthat the great strength of our Organization resides in its\r\nlegitimacy, which is founded upon the principles\r\nenshrined in the San Francisco Charter. Therefore,\r\nreform must lead to a revitalization of Member States’\r\ncommitment to our Organization, with a view to\r\ngiv8ing its decisions more effectiveness and legitimacy\r\nand to ensuring that they are respected. There is no\r\nalternative to the United Nations and our commitment\r\nto its reform must therefore be unswerving, sustained\r\nand unambiguous.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nMexico supports the Secretary-General’s proposal\r\nto establish a panel of eminent personalities to study\r\nand make recommendations on the main organs of the\r\nUnited Nations, their performance and reform. We\r\nbelieve that it is essential at the same time to give the\r\nhighest level of political support to such reform and\r\nactively to work in all areas, here and now in this\r\nGeneral Assembly, using this session to make\r\nmeaningful progress that will make our work more\r\nefficient and legitimate.\r\nAs regards revitalizing the General Assembly, we\r\nbelieve that, while one of our organ’s great merits is its\r\nuniversal and broadly democratic nature, it is essential\r\nthat it also acquire true executive capabilities. To that\r\nend, it is necessary to develop new machinery. The\r\nGeneral Assembly should also update its working\r\nprocedures. The Assembly cannot continue to consider\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nall of the items on its agenda at each session. It must be\r\nable to focus on a smaller number of items at each\r\nopportunity — items that reflect the main priorities and\r\nconcerns of the international community — so as to\r\ndelve deeper into its consideration of them and to\r\nestablish guidelines to orient our work in the\r\nOrganization as a whole.\r\nWith respect to the Economic and Social Council,\r\nwhile progress has been made in its restructuring, it is\r\nessential that we strengthen its role as coordinating\r\norgan of the activities of the specialized agencies,\r\nincluding the Bretton Woods institutions — a function\r\nthat has been allocated to it by the Charter. The\r\ninfluence of the United Nations in economic and\r\nfinancial issues will depend largely on an\r\nunderstanding of the role which the Economic and\r\nSocial Council must play, actively and to the full.\r\nAs to the Secretariat, we believe that, while\r\nsignificant administrative reform has been made, it is\r\nnecessary to eliminate inertia and improper practices\r\nthat commonly identify posts with certain countries or\r\npermit excessively autonomous centres of power to\r\nflourish.\r\nAs the Secretary-General clearly says in his\r\nreport, the decisions of the Security Council\r\nincreasingly lack legitimacy in the eyes of the\r\ndeveloping countries, which, I reiterate, represent the\r\nmajority of Members of our Organization. We are\r\ntherefore convinced that the way to ensure the greater\r\nlegitimacy of and, accordingly, greater support for the\r\nCouncil’s decisions and actions is through reform\r\nleading to greater transparency in its working methods,\r\ngreater representativity and the increasingly limited\r\nresort to the veto. Like other delegations, we believe\r\nthat the way to achieve this goal is not by expanding\r\nprivileges within the Council, such as permanent\r\nmembership, or by perpetuating the right of veto in its\r\ncurrent form. Mexico considers such privileges to be\r\nout of date.\r\nIt has again become clear through our discussion\r\nthat, while there is some agreement on the need to\r\nreform the United Nations, there is nonetheless evident\r\nreluctance to abandon traditional national positions.\r\nThe current circumstances require all Member States to\r\nfind common ground, forsake unrealistic claims and act\r\ntogether in the interest of the entire international\r\ncommunity.\r\nMr. Zenna (Ethiopia): My delegation would like\r\nto thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive\r\nreport on the work of the Organization and the follow-\r\nup to the United Nations Millennium Declaration. We\r\ncommend his continuously innovative approach to\r\nreforming and strengthening our Organization.\r\nEthiopia welcomes the proposed establishment of\r\na high-level panel of eminent personalities, as\r\nannounced by the Secretary-General in his opening\r\nspeech on 23 September 2003. We agree with him that\r\nchange is needed in the United Nations to tackle the\r\ngrowing challenges that confront all humanity. Change\r\nis needed to enable the United Nations to play a still\r\nmore central role in fighting poverty and enhancing the\r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals. We\r\nneed to strengthen the United Nations in order to make\r\nit a more potent force in fighting terrorism and\r\nmaintaining world peace and stability. Ethiopia will\r\nwork with other Member countries to make the United\r\nNations more efficient and effective.\r\nWe note with grave concern the fact that much of\r\nthe world is falling short in achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Worse still, progress in the\r\nattainment of the Goals — such as halving global\r\npoverty, substantially reducing child mortality and the\r\nfight against the spread of HIV/AIDS — have been\r\nuneven, with marked differences among and within\r\nregions.\r\nThe recent Human Development Report, under\r\nthe theme “Millennium Development Goals”, states\r\nthat some 54 countries are poorer now than they were\r\nin 1990 and that in 21 countries a larger proportion of\r\npeople are suffering from hunger. In 14 countries, more\r\nchildren are dying before the age of five and in 12\r\ncountries primary school enrolment is shrinking.\r\nFurthermore, human development indices declined in\r\n21 countries. All the aforementioned figures indicate\r\nthat we are not on the right track towards achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nSince the Millennium Summit, we have\r\nundertaken a number of new commitments. The world\r\nhas never been short of commitments and pledges.\r\nHowever, the fundamental challenge involves\r\ntranslating words into deeds and keeping the\r\ncommitments already made. Estimates indicate that at\r\nleast a doubling of official development assistance\r\nfrom its current level of $50 billion is needed to fulfil\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, which were\r\nglobally pledged.\r\nSimilarly, while encouraging achievements have\r\nresulted from addressing the debt crisis of some poor\r\ncountries through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\r\n(HIPC) Debt Initiative and other mechanisms, the call\r\nfor a swifter and deeper debt-relief mechanism remains\r\nunheeded. Consequently, many African countries\r\ncontinue to suffer as a result of a debilitating debt burden.\r\nThe objective of meeting the special needs of\r\nAfrica must remain at the top of the agenda in\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nEstimates indicate that, in order to achieve the goal of\r\nhalving the number of people living in absolute poverty\r\nin Africa, the economies of that country must grow by\r\nat least 7 per cent annually. But statistics tell us that\r\nmany countries in Africa are well below that target.\r\nThe 2003 Economic Report on Africa, issued by\r\nthe Economic Commission for Africa, indicates that\r\nAfrica’s growth in gross domestic product declined\r\nfrom an average of 4.3 per cent in 2001 to 3.2 per cent\r\nin 2002. According to the report, in 2002, of the 53\r\nAfrican countries, only five achieved the 7 per cent\r\ngrowth rate required to meet the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Hence, if the Goals are to be met,\r\nit is essential that the commitments made should be\r\ncarried out — and carried out immediately.\r\nWe in Ethiopia believe that the achievement of\r\nthe Millennium Development goals relating to poverty\r\neradication will depend to a great extent on progress in\r\nrural and agricultural development. This is mainly\r\nbecause about 85 per cent of our population, and an\r\neven larger percentage of the poor, live in rural areas.\r\nThe other reason is that efforts to reduce the deepening\r\nurban poverty can hardly bear fruit in the absence of\r\nrapid progress in agricultural and rural development\r\nactivities.\r\nIt is with this in mind that the Government has\r\ndecided to embark on a substantial and sustained\r\ninvestment in research and extension, in farmer\r\neducation and training, in water harvesting and in\r\nbuilding the physical and institutional infrastructures of\r\nrural markets.\r\nWe have also begun to focus more on\r\nstrengthening the governance system with a view to\r\nensuring peace and stability, enhancing the\r\nparticipation of the rural people in the design and\r\nimplementation of rural development programmes, and\r\nactively engaging the State in the rural areas.\r\nMr. Swe (Myanmar): At the outset, allow me to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his two reports — the\r\nreport on the work of the Organization and the report\r\non the implementation of the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration. Taken together with his\r\nstatement to the General Assembly on 23 September,\r\nthey cover a wide spectrum of the Organization’s\r\nactivities and events over the preceding 12 months,\r\nincluding peace and security issues, terrorism, human\r\nrights, democracy, HIV/AIDS, narcotic drugs and\r\nsustainable development.\r\nIn the area of peace and security, we share the\r\nSecretary-General’s assessment that the year under\r\nreview was indeed a challenging time for our\r\nOrganization and that the war in Iraq greatly tested the\r\nprinciple of collective security and the resilience of the\r\nOrganization. We fully agree with the view expressed\r\nby the Secretary-General and share his concern that the\r\nuse of force pre-emptively could set precedents that\r\nresult in proliferation of the unilateral and lawless use\r\nof force, with or without justification.\r\nWe cannot aspire to overcome the complex\r\nproblems that beset our world without a reaffirmation\r\nof the universal commitment to the principles of\r\nmultilateralism and international law. Indeed, Myanmar\r\nis steadfast in its belief that the United Nations has an\r\nindispensable role to play in ensuring international\r\npeace and security.\r\nTerrorism poses a grave threat to the international\r\ncommunity. A little over a month ago, terrorists\r\nbrought destruction to the very doorstep of our\r\nOrganization when they took the lives of 22 United\r\nNations personnel in a bomb attack on United Nations\r\nheadquarters in Iraq. The international community\r\nmust meet the challenge without giving any quarter to\r\nterrorists, anywhere. At the same time, we must\r\naddress the political, social and economic inequalities\r\nthat cause alienation and despair in order adequately to\r\naddress this challenge.\r\nThe Secretary-General has stressed the necessity\r\nof strengthening the weapons of mass destruction\r\nregime. The continued proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction is a threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity. In our view, the issue can be resolved only\r\nthrough multilateral disarmament measures. Bypassing\r\nthe will of the majority of the international community\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nunder the pretext of combating the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction cannot in any way\r\ncontribute to international peace and security, as recent\r\nevents have clearly shown.\r\nThe menace of narcotic drugs is adequately\r\nreflected in the Secretary-General’s report and deserves\r\nour undivided attention. The drug menace is closely\r\nlinked to crime and terrorism. Success in the war\r\nagainst drugs will contribute to a successful outcome in\r\nthe fight against terror and crime. In Myanmar, the\r\nsuppression of narcotic drugs is accorded the highest\r\npriority. We have initiated a 15-year plan that would\r\ntotally eradicate narcotic drugs from the country by\r\n2014. The plan is formulated based on the balanced\r\napproach of the United Nations, which aims to reduce\r\nsupply, demand and abuse, with the active participation\r\nof the local community.\r\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\r\nhas recognized Myanmar’s commitment to the anti-drug\r\ncampaign. Commencing in January 2004, Myanmar will\r\nserve on the United Nations Commission on Narcotics\r\nDrugs and hopes to work with other members in\r\ncombating this scourge to humankind.\r\nToday the world is faced with another challenge\r\nwhich poses no less a threat than terrorism or drugs.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic has brought misery and\r\nsuffering to countless numbers of people. The special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS brought\r\ntogether Governments, civil society, non-governmental\r\norganizations and the private sector in the quest to find\r\nan effective and timely response to the challenges\r\nposed by the pandemic. The new level of commitment\r\nby the international community encourages us and\r\nmust be translated into action.\r\nSpeaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China,\r\nthe Permanent Representative of the Kingdom of\r\nMorocco pointed out, among other things, that\r\n“Sustainable development also requires that food\r\nsecurity be guaranteed [in addition to a good\r\neconomic situation], as well as adequate health\r\nand education services.” (see A/58/PV.23)\r\nWe wholeheartedly support the statement by the\r\nChairman of the Group of 77.\r\nIn Myanmar, we have given special priority to the\r\ndevelopment of the border areas where the national\r\npeoples reside. The programme now encompasses all\r\nparts of the country and seeks to narrow the gap\r\nbetween urban and rural areas. Development activities\r\nthat have a direct impact on improving living standards\r\nof the populace have been activated. These include\r\nconstruction of roads, bridges, schools and hospitals.\r\nModern agricultural methods have been introduced by\r\nmeans of a programme that now covers 83,000 square\r\nmiles, where 5.3 million of our citizens live. The\r\nGovernment has spent nearly 46 billion kyats — more\r\nthan $500 million — to create an enabling environment\r\nfor sustainable development.\r\nTogether with Member States, Myanmar pledges\r\nto promote and observe human rights, democracy and\r\ngood governance, as enunciated in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. Myanmar is among the first countries to\r\nembrace the adoption of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights. We acknowledge the universality and\r\nindivisibility of human rights. At the same time,\r\nMyanmar also gives priority to the right to\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMy country is making every effort to fulfil the\r\nfundamental rights of its citizens. The rights of women,\r\nchildren, the sick, the aged and other disadvantaged\r\nmembers of society are closely protected. The\r\nMyanmar Human Rights Committee was established to\r\nensure the inalienable rights of our citizens. My\r\nGovernment is cooperating with the United Nations\r\nhuman rights bodies, the Special Rapporteur and other\r\nexperts in the field. The International Committee of the\r\nRed Cross has free and unfettered access to prisons\r\nnationwide.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration\r\ninaccurately cites Myanmar as one of the countries\r\n“where resistance to democracy is strong, even though\r\nthe majority of the people clearly desire change”\r\n(A/58/323, para. 85). We are greatly perplexed by this.\r\nInsofar as Myanmar is concerned, nothing is further\r\nfrom the truth. My Government is firmly committed to\r\nthe attainment of democracy in Myanmar. We have the\r\npolitical will for a systematic transformation into a\r\ndemocracy.\r\nOn 30 August 2003, the new Prime Minister of\r\nmy country, in his first official address to the nation,\r\noutlined a road map that would firmly guide Myanmar\r\nto democracy. If the promotion of democracy is truly\r\nthe desire of the international community, the Myanmar\r\nroad map ought to be welcomed and encouraged. For\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nour part, we are firm in our resolve to implement the\r\nroad map to democracy to its successful conclusion.\r\nMr. Gallegos (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation would like to congratulate you, Mr.\r\nPresident, on the way in which you are guiding the\r\ndebates of the General Assembly and to reiterate that\r\nwe stand ready to cooperate with you.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to support the\r\nstatements made by the permanent representative of\r\nPeru, on behalf of the Rio Group and by the permanent\r\nrepresentative of Morocco, on behalf of Group of 77.\r\nI believe that the report of the Secretary-General\r\non the work of the Organization and on the follow-up\r\nto the outcome of the Millennium Summit will enable\r\nus to give further thought to the Organization’s\r\nobjectives at a time when the Member States that\r\ncreated the United Nations should be examining\r\nthemselves and adopting the necessary political\r\ndecisions to reform the architecture of the international\r\ninstitutions so that they may meet the challenges of the\r\nworld in which we live.\r\nI would like to congratulate the Secretary-General\r\nfor his reports and commend the fact that they contain\r\nrecommendations for dealing with the historic events\r\nthat humanity is experiencing today. My delegation\r\nagrees with the Secretary-General that radical reform\r\nof the multilateral institutions is necessary.\r\nEcuador believes that it is necessary to reform the\r\nUnited Nations and has done its utmost to reach\r\nconsensus to make headway on the path to structural\r\nand substantive reform. This is not an easy endeavour.\r\nThere are differences among Member States over the\r\nreform of the United Nations, as well as on the need to\r\nrevitalize the General Assembly. There can be no doubt\r\nthat any reform requires the political will of the\r\nMember States, and we should make every effort to\r\nensure that world leaders understand the need for a\r\nsubstantial change in multilateral institutions.\r\nIf the Organization is to remain relevant, we must\r\naccept that not only procedural but also substantive\r\nchange is needed. The people of the world look to the\r\nUnited Nations with hope. That hope has been shaken\r\nmany times, because utopias and idealism clash with\r\nreality. International politics is based on interests rather\r\nthan principle or law. Accordingly, it is crucial to\r\nharmonize the interests of all Member States with of a\r\nvision of a world that is more equitable, just and humane.\r\nAs we ascend the stairs to this Hall, we can\r\nadmire two impressive murals depicting war and peace,\r\nwell-being and poverty. During the 50-year history of\r\nthe Organization, we have not been able to resolve the\r\nviolent conflicts that affect innocent human beings\r\nevery day. It is not enough to make rhetorical\r\nstatements to stop the terrible atrocities, in which\r\nknives and machetes become weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Thousands of victims of mutilation, rape,\r\ntorture and assassination attest to the ineffectiveness of\r\nthe system. This cannot continue. This is not ethical.\r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly\r\nshould not be limited to simplifying mechanisms and\r\nreducing the number of items that are discussed. We\r\nshould return to the origins of the United Nations and\r\nmake the general debate the gathering place for the\r\npolitical will of the heads of State or Government to\r\ncome together to reach solutions to the complex\r\nproblems of humanity. This is the forum in which\r\ndebate and the quest for universal consensus should occur.\r\nI believe that it would be desirable to make decisions\r\nagreed upon by the General Assembly binding on the\r\nState Members and other international actors.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council should go\r\nbeyond increasing the number of its members. There\r\nshould be fundamental change that, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has said, responds to the political realities of\r\nthe twenty-first century. The present dangers in the\r\nworld stem not only from States, but also from\r\ntransnational terrorist organizations, organized crime\r\nand institutionalized violence. The Security Council\r\nmust change because the world has changed.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council should be able\r\nto respond to a vision of a world that is integrated and\r\nglobalized in its international relations. Today, all of us\r\nare citizens of the world. We are 6 billion people, and\r\nhalf go to bed hungry, which is also unethical. The\r\ndeveloping countries would be less poor if the\r\ndeveloped countries stopped subsidizing their\r\nagricultural products by $1.2 billion a day. The dignity\r\nof a human being is found in his work, and we cannot\r\nreach this goal if artificial barriers are created that\r\ndoom us to poverty. Here lies the central role of the\r\nUnited Nations: achieving justice and equality.\r\nReform can be postponed no longer; we have\r\ndiscussed it for many years. I belong to the school of\r\nthought of Arnold Toynbee, who maintains in his\r\nmonumental Study of History that in the annals of\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nhistory, the civilizations that disappeared did so\r\nbecause they were unable to adapt to change. Change,\r\nas Heraclitus maintained, is constant. If we do not\r\nchange the multilateral structure of the United Nations\r\nand its specialized agencies so that they respond to the\r\nneeds of our peoples, we will have condemned to\r\nfailure the greatest consultative effort in the history of\r\nhumanity.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I appeal to the representatives\r\nof Member States that all of us respond to the cries of\r\nour peoples and find the political will to adopt reforms\r\nof the international system that will enable us to\r\nprovide a better tomorrow for our children.\r\nMr. Taha (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, my delegation would like to express its thanks\r\nand appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for having submitted the two important reports\r\nnow before the Assembly. In addition, we subscribe to\r\nthe statement made earlier by the representative of\r\nMorocco on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration set forth ways and\r\nmeans of tackling the new millennium’s challenges:\r\neconomic and social underdevelopment, worsening\r\npoverty and rampant epidemics such as HIV/AIDS,\r\ntuberculosis and malaria, in addition to issues of\r\ninternational peace and security, terrorism, organized\r\ncrime and armed conflict.\r\nAmong needed reforms on which not much\r\nprogress has been made, we should like to emphasize\r\nthe need to reform the Security Council. Its permanent\r\nand non-permanent membership must be expanded so\r\nthat it becomes more representative of the United\r\nNations membership as a whole, and its working\r\nmethods must be improved so that its decision-making\r\nprocess is more democratic and transparent. I believe\r\nthat the Council’s importance underscores the need to\r\nreflect on how to elaborate new ways to reform it. In\r\nthat connection, I should like to draw attention to the\r\nbold proposal by the Prime Minister of Malaysia to\r\nimprove the veto by stipulating that it be used only in\r\nconjunction with the efforts of more than one State,\r\nthereby reducing the degree of domination by\r\npermanent members.\r\nDespite the holding of international conferences\r\nin an attempt to bring people’s views closer together,\r\nthere is an ever-widening gap between the rich\r\ncountries of the North and the poor countries of the\r\nSouth. Therefore, it is imperative that we create a fair\r\nand democratic international economic order that will\r\nenable us to create better conditions for international\r\ntrade between rich and poor countries, transcending the\r\nfailure of Cancún by improving the amount of official\r\nassistance provided to poor countries and eliminating\r\ntheir external debts. We welcome the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development as a purely African initiative\r\nproviding a framework that will enable the\r\ninternational community to help the continent to\r\ndevelop. We look forward to practical outcomes that\r\nshould reflect the international will of the General\r\nAssembly to support the continent.\r\nAs a result of the economic and social conditions\r\nin the least developed countries, the international\r\ncommunity must attach particular importance to\r\nseriously helping that group of countries to emerge\r\nfrom the poverty, hunger and disease that afflict them.\r\nIn that connection, we should like to commend the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s decision in December 2001 to\r\ncreate the Office of the High Representative for the\r\nLeast Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing\r\nCountries and Small Island Developing States to\r\ncoordinate, monitor and follow up implementation of\r\nprogrammes of action for those countries.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s statement\r\nconcerning human rights and fundamental freedoms\r\nand their intertwined relationship with economic,\r\nsocial, political and cultural problems. In this regard,\r\nwe renounce the use of selectivity, double standards\r\nand politicization of those noble principles.\r\nThe international community has responded to the\r\nappeals to fight terrorism. We agree with the States that\r\nhave requested the convening of an international\r\nconference to define terrorism so that it can be\r\ndistinguished from the right of peoples to struggle\r\nagainst aggression. In addition, we should study the\r\nroot causes of that phenomenon and its hasty and\r\nunjustified linkage to a particular religion or ideology,\r\nbecause its victims include those of all religions,\r\nnationalities and races.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General indicated that\r\nSudan has made some progress towards a timely\r\ncomprehensive conclusion of an agreement. We should\r\nalso like to point out that we concluded an agreement\r\non security arrangements last September and that we\r\nhope to announce shortly the conclusion of a\r\ncomprehensive settlement on an end to the civil war in\r\nSudan.\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nMr. Schurti (Liechtenstein): Liechtenstein\r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s reports on the work\r\nof the Organization and on the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration. In particular, we appreciate\r\nhis keen eye for those areas in which we — the\r\nMember States that make up the Organization — are\r\nfaltering in our commitments and political will.\r\nTo be sure, the past year was a uniquely\r\nchallenging one for the Organization, but we must\r\nrecognize that it was not outside circumstances or\r\ndisasters that caused what has come to be perceived as\r\na crisis. In fact, the toughest challenge for the\r\nOrganization came from within the membership. If the\r\ncrisis originated within the membership, the solution\r\nwill also, of course, be found among and by the\r\nMember States.\r\nWe remain firmly convinced that an Organization\r\nthat is strong and is perceived as such by everyone is in\r\nthe best interests of all Member States. It would indeed\r\nbe tragic if the international community lost its\r\ncapacity for multilateral cooperation, while its enemies\r\nhave understood the strength of cooperation and\r\norganized themselves in destructive ways such as\r\nterrorist groups.\r\nLast year we pointed out that it might be\r\nsurprising for the Secretary-General to make strong\r\ncalls for multilateralism before an audience that should\r\nepitomize multilateralism to the peoples of the world.\r\nHowever, the events of past months have made it\r\nabundantly clear that the crisis the Organization\r\nexperienced in connection with the disagreement on the\r\nproper course of action against Iraq is no less than a\r\ncrisis of multilateralism. Member States seem to have\r\nfallen out of step with world public opinion, which\r\nclearly favours joint multilateral efforts under the rule\r\nof law.\r\nIt is one of this Organization’s great success\r\nstories — as the world’s premier standard-setting\r\nbody — that the rule of law could be promoted to the\r\nextent that today, nearly everywhere in the world, there\r\nis a strong sense of human rights and the rule of law. It\r\nis a sad irony that the observance of international law\r\nsuffered setbacks because this Organization — and the\r\nSecurity Council in particular — finds it difficult to\r\nlive up to its role as the guardian of the rule of law.\r\nLegitimacy, in accordance with international law,\r\nis the outstanding quality of this Organization,\r\nguaranteeing credibility and acceptance. We must not\r\ngamble away this unique feature; rather, we are called\r\nupon to protect it. The crisis the United Nations has\r\nbeen going through in connection with the action taken\r\nagainst Iraq will not be ended by pragmatically\r\nreturning to business as usual. Indeed, the Organization\r\ncould be further harmed if it continues to operate in\r\nIraq without a stronger and more comprehensive part to\r\nplay. The perceived legitimacy and impartiality of the\r\nUnited Nations must not further be compromised. The\r\nOrganization, in particular its employees on the\r\nground, must not be put in a position where those on\r\nwhose behalf it is acting perceive it to be serving\r\ninterests other than those provided for in the United\r\nNations Charter. We are convinced, however, that,\r\nwhen entrusted with a clear and strong mandate in Iraq,\r\nthe United Nations will be able to live up to the\r\nsupreme role afforded it by international law.\r\nLiechtenstein applauds the Secretary-General for\r\nhis ongoing reform work within the Secretariat, United\r\nNations agencies and the operational activities of the\r\nsystem. Secretariat reform has been largely successful\r\nthus far, and we fully support his continuing work in\r\nthis regard. As a Member State, we recognize that we\r\ncan and should contribute more to making the United\r\nNations system, and in particular intergovernmental\r\nbodies, more effective. A group of eminent\r\npersonalities, as proposed by the Secretary-General,\r\nwill be able to provide us with a fresh view on\r\nnecessary steps to improve the functioning of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nHaving said that, it is clear that no group of\r\npersonalities, or other group, can make the necessary\r\ndecisions on our behalf. In some areas, we have long\r\nrecognized and come to an agreement on the fact that\r\nchanges need to be made. We must now muster the\r\npolitical will to actually take the first step. As for the\r\nSecurity Council, after 10 years of debate, the time has\r\ncome to move beyond improving its working methods\r\nand to make the structural changes needed. The\r\nSecurity Council must be made more representative to\r\nreflect demographic and geopolitical realities and to\r\nmake it more credible. The privileges and\r\nresponsibilities in the context of the decision-making\r\nprocess among the membership of the Security Council\r\nneed to be adjusted.\r\nOf course, only the General Assembly can\r\nundertake such work at the foundations. To start out,\r\nthe General Assembly should assume its rightful role\r\nvis-à-vis the Security Council, in accordance with the\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nCharter, and deal more vigorously with pressing issues\r\nat hand. We will therefore support you, Mr. President,\r\nin your initiative to revitalize the General Assembly.\r\nThere seems to be a common perception that the\r\nmain purpose of the United Nations is to maintain\r\npeace and security in the world. Historically, this is\r\ncertainly understandable. Yet, even in the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations, it was clearly recognized that\r\npeace and security are not, indeed cannot be, stand-\r\nalone areas of work. Working towards peace and human\r\nsecurity must go in tandem with promoting human rights\r\nand advancing social and economic development.\r\nConsistently, the Charter provided that the work of the\r\nUnited Nations would have to encompass the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, respect for the obligations\r\narising from international law, the acceptance of\r\nprinciples and the institution of methods, as well as the\r\npromotion of the economic and social advancement of\r\nall peoples. Peace and security remain hardly\r\nimaginable without continuous work in all these areas.\r\nOver the years, the General Assembly, particularly\r\nthrough conferences and summits, has forged an\r\nimpressive set of legal instruments and adopted\r\ndeclarations and programmes of action that can serve\r\nus well in tackling the world’s problems. Most recently,\r\nthe standard-setting culminated in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, including the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, in which States reaffirmed the vision outlined in\r\nthe Charter, spelling it out in concrete and specific\r\nterms relevant to our times. The Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals reflect the recognition that poverty\r\nremains a serious threat to peace and security.\r\nThat is to say that the Organization has been quite\r\neffective in defining problems and outlining the\r\nrequired responses. However, it does not reach the\r\nsame level of effectiveness when it comes to the\r\nimplementation of its own programmes of actions\r\ntowards clearly defined goals. In following through,\r\nour performance is uneven. Thus, when talking about\r\nworking to make the Organization more efficient,\r\nMember States must bear in mind that, in the end, their\r\nperformance determines the success of the\r\nOrganization. The success and, as a consequence, the\r\ncredibility and legitimacy of the United Nations\r\ndepends on the willingness of its Members to live up to\r\nthe consensus declarations and commitments.\r\nMr. Savua (Fiji): The Millennium Declaration\r\nremains a milestone road map to help us focus more\r\nsharply on the development agenda for the twenty-first\r\ncentury. The lessons learned in the United Nations\r\nsystem since its inception have shaped a common\r\nvision of humankind, with the aim of bringing about a\r\nmore peaceful, prosperous and just world, as detailed\r\nin the Declaration.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s observations, in the two\r\nreports he submitted under items 10 and 60, on the\r\nconstrained movement of the global community and by\r\nMember States in moving towards the set targets are\r\nvery welcome, timely and constructive. The reports are\r\nhelpful also in identifying obstacles and challenges. We\r\nagree with the need for radical institutional reforms.\r\nWe heard many creative and practical suggestions\r\nduring the general debate in this connection and\r\nconsider it incumbent upon the presidency, in\r\ncollaboration with the Secretary-General, to take on\r\nboard those suggestions for institutional reforms and\r\nreforms in the working methods and in the substance of\r\nits various organs and bodies, for a total reinvigoration.\r\nOn its own, the world leaders’ Millennium\r\nDeclaration cannot stop or counter the threats to\r\ninternational peace and security that are being\r\nunleashed. Such threats are no longer confined to areas\r\nof conflict or crisis, as the events of 11 September and\r\nsubsequent attacks exemplify. Even the United Nations\r\nis now a direct target for terrorist attacks, as evidenced\r\nby the Baghdad tragedy.\r\nThis week, the United Nations continues its\r\ndeliberations in the Sixth Committee on how best to\r\ncombat international terrorism through diplomatic\r\nchannels, which continue to be obstructed by political\r\ndifferences. The Security Council’s path, through its\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee, has earned the respect\r\nof and rapport with Member States in implementing\r\nresolution 1373 (2001). While that route is cementing\r\nthe anti-terrorism groundwork at the national and\r\nregional levels, clearly a political solution is now\r\nimperative to boost the fight against international\r\nterrorism.\r\nWithout excusing wanton and cowardly acts of\r\nterrorism against the lives of innocent people, meeting\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals is a significant\r\nstart to fighting terrorism. Meeting the Goals would\r\nuplift the quality of lives and thereby serve to uproot\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nthe adverse social, economic and human rights\r\nconditions in which terrorist tendencies flourish.\r\nDisplacing those adverse conditions and\r\ntendencies and substituting them with a more enabling\r\nand empowering socio-economic environment will\r\nmore than satisfy global collective commitments to the\r\nconferences and summits of the past decade, dating\r\nback to Rio and reaffirmed in Johannesburg. Meeting\r\nthe Goals would help us, led by the United Nations, to\r\nrealign the shifting planes which have been thrown into\r\ndiscord by globalization, as a result of which not only\r\nhas trade balance been skewered, but many other\r\nglobal imbalances have become rapidly entrenched.\r\nThe tragedy is that not only are these global\r\nimbalances being felt at the global level and not only\r\nare the forces of globalization making the rich richer\r\nand the poor poorer on the global scene, but that the\r\ndivide is even more pronounced and accentuated at the\r\nnational level and across borders. This is a sure recipe\r\nfor internal conflict, destabilization and terrorism and a\r\ndistraction to the national Governments of developing\r\ncountries — especially the least developed countries\r\nand small island developing States like my own\r\ncountry, Fiji — from our commitments to improving\r\nthe quality of lives of our citizens.\r\nWhile all the success stories of the United\r\nNations peacekeeping role in Bougainville, East Timor,\r\nSierra Leone, Afghanistan, Kosovo and other peace-\r\nbuilding efforts are causes for celebration and\r\nreflection, they cannot give us the holistic global\r\nsolution or the overall change in paradigm that the\r\ninternational community needs to implement\r\ncollectively in order to find lasting solutions.\r\nSome fatigue or lethargy may have crept into the\r\nOrganization over decades of peace operations. The\r\nreforms in the peacekeeping sector alone that were\r\nrecommended by the Brahimi report, although they\r\nmay build on aspects of human rights and gender\r\ncomponents, cannot bring lasting solutions without the\r\nradical reforms that the Secretary-General speaks of in\r\norder to keep alive hopes for multilateralism in this\r\ncentury. While Fiji looks forward to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s high-level panel on institutional reforms, we\r\nalso trust that the panel will be convened following full\r\nconsultations with regional groups and partners.\r\nWe need to see the United Nations taking a\r\nbalanced approach to peace and security that can\r\nenhance Member States’ commitment to the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development outcomes, in\r\nparticular through the commitments of the developed\r\npartners to assisting home-grown development initiatives\r\nof developing partners. We also advocate global\r\nresponses for global programmes, as with HIV/AIDS,\r\nmultilateral trade or sustainable development.\r\nIn an ideal world, peace and security can be\r\nrealized only by building trust among nations and\r\nStates. States large and small must be enabled to\r\nparticipate meaningfully in the United Nations. We\r\ncannot do so by expanding the agenda of the United\r\nNations in an exponential manner, leaving small and\r\nresource-poor States extremely limited in the issues\r\nand areas in which they can participate, while the\r\nbasics remain to be satisfactorily addressed by this\r\nOrganization. This trend in the United Nations grossly\r\ndisadvantages us developing countries in numerous\r\nways, leaving us engaged in a catch-up mode.\r\nDeveloping countries hold some 80 per cent share\r\nof the global population and a still higher rate of the\r\nworld’s poverty statistics. Bearing this picture in mind,\r\nthere are two options for this Organization. We can\r\nkeep going as we have these past 50-odd years and\r\nmaintain the status quo, or we can leave lasting\r\nfootprints for the holistic changes we intend to make in\r\nthis Organization or for reaping some value from the\r\nannual assessed contributions that we can ill afford to\r\npay, both to the United Nations and to its related bodies\r\nand agencies, and which we need to see making a\r\ndifference.\r\nFiji therefore embraces fully the opening\r\nstatement with which you, Sir, inspired our leaders in\r\nopening the general debate and the many practical and\r\nforward-looking suggestions proffered by your\r\ndelegation and by the many delegations that followed\r\nsuit during that debate. In the same vein, we want to\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General on his astute\r\nassessment of shortcomings in the Organization and his\r\nperceptive recommendations for reform. We stand\r\nready to support these efforts.\r\nMr. Moleko (Lesotho): Let me pay a well-\r\ndeserved tribute to you, Sir, for your election to preside\r\nover this body during the fifty-eighth session. My\r\ndelegation will cooperate with you to make this session\r\na successful and memorable one for the future of our\r\ngeneration.\r\nI would like to thank the Secretary-General for a\r\nvery thoughtful and comprehensive report on the work\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nof the United Nations and the follow-up to the outcome\r\nof the Millennium Summit. The challenges faced by\r\nour Organization have been very clearly set out by the\r\nSecretary-General. The Millennium Development\r\nGoals set three years ago show that the international\r\ncommunity is indeed focused on the right and\r\nachievable objectives. The attainment of these\r\nobjectives is, however, proving to be elusive because of\r\nthe lack of political will and because of protectionism.\r\nThe most intractable of these Goals is that of\r\ncombating HIV and AIDS, malaria and other infectious\r\ndiseases. This Goal is proving to be a challenge\r\nbecause of extreme poverty. We are also failing on the\r\nGoal of halving the proportion of people whose income\r\nis less than $1 per day. Poverty is still the biggest\r\nproblem that we need to address. Any positive gain\r\nover it will necessarily translate into achievement on\r\nthe other Goals, because there is an isomorphic\r\nmapping between poverty and the escalating\r\nHIV/AIDS infection rate.\r\nWe are failing to meet the targets that we set for\r\nourselves and, in the process, have relegated some regions\r\nof the world to doom and possible disappearance. Sub-\r\nSaharan Africa is facing the greatest threat humankind\r\nhas ever had to face. The Global Fund to fight\r\nHIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria does, however,\r\nrepresent a real hope for those nations to address this\r\nproblem. Governments have developed strategies to\r\nslow down the spread of the disease and, as Prime\r\nMinister Mosisili of Lesotho, has said:\r\n“The political will is very strong. What we need are\r\nresources and capacity-building. But the fact that\r\nwe have no capacity — as we have been told ad\r\nnauseam — cannot and must not be used as an\r\nexcuse for denying us resources.” (A/58/PV.3, p. 8)\r\nOur house is on fire and the neighbours who have\r\nwater must come and help extinguish the fire to save\r\nour homes. We need the resources to help build the\r\nvery capacity that we have been told we do not have.\r\nThe relevance of the United Nations in the wake\r\nof the escalating wars and internecine conflicts is a\r\nlemma requiring no mathematical proof. The startling\r\nterrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 on the United\r\nStates, the ensuing war on terrorism, the Iraq war and\r\nthe recent attack against Syria in the name of the war\r\non terrorism, show how much we in this Organization\r\nneed each other. The founding fathers of our\r\nOrganization learned from the two world wars that\r\npeace and international security could not be achieved\r\nthrough unilateralism. The lessons they learned then\r\nare as relevant today as they will be in the future.\r\nThe Middle East situation continues to show that\r\nunilateral actions by some States lead only to further\r\ninsecurity in all the countries of the region. We\r\nrecognize that, under Article 51 of the Charter, any\r\ncountry when attacked has an inherent right to self-\r\ndefence. But unprovoked attacks on weaker nations are\r\nunacceptable. If States need to resort to force to resolve\r\nthreats to international peace and security, they need\r\nthe sanction of this Organization to legitimize their\r\nactions.\r\nThe general debate, which concluded recently,\r\nstrongly endorsed multilateralism and reaffirmed that\r\nthe United Nations remains the only Organization\r\navailable to all nations, big and small, to address global\r\nissues, including terrorism, the HIV/AIDS pandemic,\r\npoverty and, of course, the challenges of globalization.\r\nMy delegation would like to express its unwavering\r\nsupport for the General Assembly as the central body best\r\nable to address these world problems. It is thus necessary\r\nto direct our collective efforts at strengthening it, while\r\nmaintaining its character as a body in which all States\r\ncontinue to have equal powers. We support the\r\nSecretary-General’s call for the reform of the General\r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and the\r\nSecurity Council. We support his idea of appointing a\r\npanel of eminent persons to study this important issue\r\nand report at the fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly. We are confident that the persons he\r\nappoints will not only be eminent and knowledgeable,\r\nbut will also reflect the face of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council — a body\r\nwhose decisions bind all Member States, yet one in\r\nwhich only five out of 191 States have real power — is\r\nan issue that needs immediate attention.\r\nMathematically, that figure represents just 2.6 per cent\r\nof the total membership of the United Nations. If the\r\n10 elected members are factored in, that figure rises to\r\n7.9 per cent. We all know that one Member State with\r\nthe power of veto can thwart the will of the entire\r\ninternational community. Yet one Member State\r\nrepresents 0.5 per cent of the membership of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Security Council is unrepresentative, and it\r\nneeds to be reformed. In addressing this issue in his\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nstatement to the General Assembly on 24 September,\r\nthe Prime Minister of Lesotho, said:\r\n“It has been almost 10 years since the\r\nestablishment of an open-ended working group to\r\nstudy all questions relating to equitable\r\nrepresentation in the Security Council, including\r\nincreasing the membership of the Council. My\r\nDelegation is of the view that there is an urgent\r\nneed to accelerate the pace and to redouble our\r\nefforts to bring this matter to a conclusion. Let us\r\nface it: the very concept and practice of a veto in\r\nthe Security Council is simply untenable and is\r\ntotally at variance with the democratic principles\r\nof our modern times. For one member with a veto\r\nto overrule 14 others is simply undemocratic. It is\r\npatently unjust and contrary to every principle\r\nunderpinning fair play and world order.”\r\n(A/58/PV.10, p. 20)\r\nI would like to echo those words of wisdom by\r\nmy Prime Minister, and call for urgent action to bring\r\nthe 10-year-long discussions of the open-ended\r\nworking group to a close. We need to take action now\r\non the many recommendations and ideas thus brought\r\nto the table.\r\nMs. Peksa-Krawiec (Poland): During the general\r\ndebate, as well as in the current debate under agenda\r\nitems 10 and 60, all speakers have underlined the need\r\nfor bold, far-reaching and courageous steps if we want\r\nto preserve the United Nations as a relevant and vital\r\nOrganization — an Organization that serves all of its\r\nMembers, one that is able to respond to current threats\r\nand is ready to tackle all the new challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nWe share the belief expressed by many\r\ndelegations here that it is the strong commitment of all\r\nMember States to effective multilateralism which is\r\nneeded if the United Nations system is to retain its\r\nunique and important role as the central forum for\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nPoland fully aligns itself with the statement made\r\nby the Permanent Representative of Italy, speaking on\r\nbehalf of the presidency of the European Union, on the\r\nfirst day of our discussion on the reports on the\r\noutcome of the Millennium Summit and on the work of\r\nthe Organization. As he said, we attach great\r\nimportance to the principles and objectives set out in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration and to all the issues\r\naddressed in it — questions relating to peace and\r\nsecurity, development, human rights, democracy and\r\ngood governance.\r\nWe hope that Member States will share the\r\nobservations and conclusions contained in the reports\r\nof the Secretary-General and not only support the\r\nongoing process of reform but also search for new\r\nideas and concepts which will help to move forward\r\nthe implementation of the Goals set out in the\r\nDeclaration, strengthen multilateral mechanisms and\r\nconfirm the position of the Organization as the most\r\nimportant institution of international security and\r\ncooperation.\r\nA new vision of a more effective international\r\norder and collective security requires a new political\r\nconsensus, especially in the light of recent events. This\r\nvery conviction was the foundation of the proposal put\r\nforward during the fifty-seventh session by the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, Mr.\r\nWladzimierz Cimoszewicz, to launch a New Political\r\nAct relating to the United Nations at the dawn of the\r\ntwenty-first century — a document which would\r\nprovide fresh impetus for strengthening the principles\r\nand reinforcing the mechanisms of the United Nations\r\nsystem. Let me express our satisfaction with the fact\r\nthat the Polish initiative corresponds with the position\r\noutlined by the Secretary-General at the outset of the\r\ngeneral debate of the current Assembly session.\r\nMy country fully supports the proposal to\r\nestablish a high-level panel of eminent personalities\r\nthat would examine the role of collective action against\r\ncurrent security challenges and review the operation of\r\nmajor United Nations organs. We are ready to give our\r\nfull support to this body, as well as to help out in its\r\nendeavours.\r\nEarlier this year, while consulting on our initiative,\r\nwe collected a substantive body of thought, which was\r\nthen reflected in the memorandum of the Government\r\nof the Republic of Poland. We are ready to share this\r\nand other documents with the panel, in the hope that it\r\ncould make a substantial contribution and act as a good\r\nstarting point for its deliberations and work.\r\nWe certainly expect the final document — the\r\nreport of the high-level panel — to focus in a\r\nconceptual and holistic way on the nature of changes in\r\nthe international system and provide a vision of a more\r\neffective international order. The report should in our\r\nopinion contain answers to questions posed by present\r\nchallenges, including security risks related to\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nglobalization and non-State actors, development gaps,\r\ninternational solidarity and good governance.\r\nThe high-level panel might at the same time\r\nformulate the reflection on the values and principles\r\nthat bind the international community together and\r\ndefine the behaviour of States towards one another,\r\ntowards other actors on the international scene and\r\ntowards citizens. At the same time, we hope that the\r\nrecommendations of the panel will reflect the need to\r\nfurther strengthen United Nations capacities in the\r\nfields of the promotion of democracy, the rule of law\r\nand the protection of human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms, and that the United Nations mechanisms and\r\ninstruments for providing peace, security and stability\r\nthroughout the world will also be reviewed and\r\nenhanced.\r\nWe look forward to the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendations based on the work of the panel. We\r\nhope that they will give a fresh impetus to further\r\nconceptual thinking and reform of the United Nations\r\nsystem. We cannot, however, just sit and wait for the\r\noutcome of the deliberations of the eminent persons.\r\nWhile supporting their work, we must continue to\r\nstrive for the smooth and timely implementation of the\r\nreforms already agreed upon. We have to intensify our\r\nefforts to make the daily work of the Organization\r\nmore effective and fruitful. United Nations reform is\r\nnot only the domain of high-level political initiatives; it\r\nis also a part of the everyday work of all of us in all\r\nforums.\r\nWe would like to urge the functional committees\r\nof the General Assembly to continue consideration of\r\nthe reform package on a priority basis. From that\r\nperspective, the adoption of a new programme budget\r\nfor the biennium 2004-2005 which supports the full\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration and the\r\nreform process will be of crucial importance. In our\r\nopinion, the Secretariat and other United Nations\r\nbodies should also continue and further strengthen the\r\nreform processes.\r\nPoland strongly believes that, at the same time,\r\nwe should search for ways to improve the work and the\r\noutcomes of the Security Council. Similarly, the role and\r\nworking methods of the Economic and Social Council\r\nshould be, in our opinion, reviewed and strengthened.\r\nFinally, it is our conviction that, especially this\r\nyear, Member States should engage more strongly in a\r\nprocess of revitalizing the General Assembly. We all\r\nagree that the Assembly should be given the most\r\nimportant political role in a global debate, but to\r\nachieve that we must make this body more effective,\r\ncapable and strong. There are many proposals put\r\nforward in this context; we already have a basis to\r\nbuild upon. We therefore hope that, during this year’s\r\ndebate, under your leadership, Mr. President, we will\r\nbe able to take bold decisions in this regard.\r\nEchoing the appeal of the Secretary-General that\r\nwe seek agreement on how to make the United Nations\r\nan Organization for our times, I should like to assure\r\nthe Assembly that, in the course of this session, our\r\ndelegation will do its best to contribute to the\r\nachievement of that goal.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on these items for this meeting.\r\nSeveral representatives have requested to exercise\r\nthe right of reply. May I remind members that\r\nstatements in the exercise of the right of reply are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to\r\nfive minutes for the second intervention and should be\r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who\r\nwish to speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMr. Kim Chang Guk (Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea): I am going to make a statement in\r\nexercise of the right of reply to the statement made\r\nyesterday by the representative of Japan on the nuclear\r\nissue.\r\nThe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is the\r\noutcome of the United States hostile policy towards the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. Japan does not\r\ncontribute at all to its settlement by running amok to\r\nbring international pressure to bear on the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. The United States is\r\nthreatening a pre-emptive nuclear attack on the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. Japan is\r\nactively taking sides with the United States, laying bare\r\nits ambition of re-invading Korea and pronouncing its\r\nright to strike pre-emptively at military bases in the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nBefore all these threats, how can the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea lay down its war-deterrent\r\nforce? The Iraq war taught the world the grave lesson\r\nthat nobody on Earth — not even the United\r\nNations — can protect weak and small nations from\r\narmed aggression by a super-Power.\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nsternly warns Japan to discard its delusion of catching\r\nfish in the troubled waters of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea-United States nuclear confrontation.\r\nJapan’s anti-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nfrenzy will serve only to severely damage its own\r\ninterests.\r\nAs for Democratic People’s Republic of Korea-\r\nJapan relations, these will be possible only when Japan\r\ncompensates for its past crimes on the Korean people.\r\nIt is really foolish for Japan to think that the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea is so impatient\r\nto improve relations with Japan that it would\r\ncompromise its principles and national interests. This\r\nis the core of the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. The delegation of\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is\r\ndisappointed that Japan is incapable of understanding\r\nthis simple logic.\r\nMy next point is that it is despicable for Japan to\r\ntalk of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea-\r\nJapan Pyongyang Declaration. Japan should, if nothing\r\nelse, break itself of the bad habit of betraying its\r\ndialogue partner. Japan should try to earn its credibility\r\nin the eyes of the international community.\r\nMr. Mekel (Israel): I regret to take the floor in\r\nexercising this right of reply to comments by certain\r\ndelegations that have abused the debate in the\r\nAssembly to further their narrow political agenda.\r\nRepresentatives who express such concern when Israel\r\nexercises counter-terrorism measures in an act of self-\r\ndefence, but fail to express even the faintest whisper of\r\nconcern when dozens of innocent lives are lost at the\r\nhands of terrorists groups and the States that sponsor\r\nthem, had best take a good look in the mirror.\r\nSuch failure to expressly condemn the deliberate\r\nmurder of innocent civilians speaks to a double\r\nstandard that for too long has plagued the agenda of the\r\nAssembly. The fact that it is not the loss of 19 innocent\r\nlives in a Haifa restaurant, not to mention the hundreds\r\nof other victims of Palestinian terrorism, that moves\r\ncertain representatives to speak or act, but rather\r\nIsrael’s defensive response to such aggression against a\r\nterrorist training facility speaks volumes about the\r\nvalues and intentions of such speakers.\r\nSyria, a dictatorship which occupies a\r\nneighbouring State and which is known for sponsoring,\r\nfinancing and harbouring terrorism in violation of the\r\nmost basic norms of international law, should be the\r\nlast to speak of justice and law. The Syrian\r\nrepresentative likes to preach reverently about his\r\nsupport for so-called resistance. Perhaps he can explain\r\nhow exactly the attack in Haifa, perpetrated by an\r\norganization which Syria sponsors, harbours and\r\nsupports, and which took the lives of so many innocent\r\nchildren and babies, serves as an act of legitimate\r\nresistance?\r\nPerhaps he can explain how exactly the attack in\r\nHaifa, perpetrated by an organization which Syria\r\nsponsors, harbours and supports, which took the lives\r\nof so many innocent children and babies, serves as an\r\nact of legitimate resistance? Perhaps he can explain\r\nhow the Syrians themselves have dealt with resistance,\r\nas in the case of Hama, where some 10,000 civilians\r\nwere murdered by Syrian armed forces? Or perhaps he\r\ncan explain what steps his Government has taken in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001) and the road map itself, which calls on States to\r\ncease all support for groups that deliberately murder\r\ninnocents?\r\nTo revive the peace process, and to give the road\r\nmap a chance to succeed, we cannot absolve State\r\nsponsors of terror of their responsibilities to the\r\ninternational community and under international law.\r\nThe international community must not allow any\r\npolitical gain from a strategy of murder that has\r\nbrought suffering and despair to all peoples of the\r\nregion. To do so would only encourage that strategy\r\nand push the day of peace further into the future.\r\nMr. Haraguchi (Japan): I should like to speak in\r\nthe exercise of the right of reply with respect to the\r\nintervention made by the North Korean representative.\r\nThe North Korean representative misunderstands\r\nif he thinks that Japan’s strong interest in North\r\nKorea’s nuclear development programme is solely for\r\nthe sake of siding with the United States. I have to\r\nstress that the North Korean nuclear issue is one of the\r\nutmost importance for Japan, as it is directly linked to\r\nJapanese security. Japan therefore cannot be silenced\r\non this vital issue.\r\nSecondly, the North Korean representative\r\nreferred to possible compensation issues. I should like\r\nto draw his attention to paragraph 2 of the Pyongyang\r\nDeclaration, which was duly signed by the leaders of\r\nboth countries and which states:\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\n“Both sides, pursuant to the basic principle\r\nthat when the bilateral relationship is normalized,\r\nboth Japan and the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea would mutually waive all their property\r\nand claims and those of their nationals that had\r\narisen from causes which occurred before August\r\n15, 1945, decided that they would discuss this\r\nissue of property and claims concretely in the\r\nnormalization talks.”\r\nI should like to emphasize that it is our position\r\nto engage in the normalization of diplomatic relations\r\nwith North Korea through a comprehensive solution of\r\nall the outstanding issues, such as the nuclear issue, the\r\nmissile issue and the abduction issue.\r\nMr. Nakkari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): We were not surprised by the manner in which\r\nthe Israeli representative began his statement. He\r\nimmediately condemned all those countries that have\r\nalready denounced the wanton act of aggression that\r\ntook place on 5 October against a peaceful Syrian\r\nvillage. That shows a mentality that supposes anyone\r\nwith different beliefs to be an enemy.\r\nA few days ago, from this very rostrum, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Israel requested the\r\nGeneral Assembly to review its approach and methods\r\nof work and to cease adopting resolutions that call on\r\nIsrael to be committed to international legitimacy. That\r\nshows the logic and nature of that entity and the way in\r\nwhich it deals with its neighbours.\r\nThe false claims that have been made are not new\r\nto this audience, and we regret the fact that we will\r\nhave to respond to them on yet another occasion.\r\nIsrael’s supposed concern for peace is hard to\r\nbelieve, since the current Government of Israel is a war\r\nGovernment that has not refrained from killing men,\r\nwomen and children or from demolishing houses and\r\nconfiscating lands. We have quoted from the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the work of the Organization\r\nregarding the suffering of 1.3 million people due to\r\nIsraeli practices. Those people now live under the\r\npoverty line.\r\nThe report also notes that the United Nations\r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the\r\nNear East cannot fulfil its mandate because of the\r\npolicy of siege and closures. That country knows only\r\nwar and violence, exports its internal crises to other\r\ncountries, and has consistently attempted to kill the\r\nchance for peace.\r\nThe international community had been discussing\r\nthe possibility of finding a peaceful solution to the\r\nArab-Israeli conflict. But Israel has sabotaged that\r\npossibility, and is now trying to compel the world to\r\ndiscount the option of a peaceful solution.\r\nThe option of peace as a strategic choice — a\r\nchoice that has been made by all the countries of the\r\nregion except Israel. That also was alluded to in the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General.\r\nSyria also recalls that it has consistently called\r\nfor a peace based on resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\r\n(1973), the Madrid framework, the principle of land for\r\npeace and other agreements reached by both parties, in\r\naddition to the Arab peace initiative presented at the\r\nBeirut Arab Summit. These are the same bases that the\r\nSecretary-General mentioned in his report.\r\nOther false and misleading claims were made\r\nabout Syria’s occupation of Lebanon. I believe that it is\r\ninsolent for anyone to make such false claims. These\r\nare two peoples, two brotherly Governments, that have\r\nagreed on different measures that suit both of them.\r\nThis is a case in which two Governments are\r\nlegitimately represented and have chosen freely. The\r\naccusations against them are sheer insolence.\r\nWith regard to the other allegations made about\r\nthe Government of Syria, I can say only that the\r\nGovernment commands the respect of the Syrian\r\npeople. We believe that was the main reason for\r\nIsrael’s act of aggression. We are proud of our\r\nleadership and our Government.\r\nOur leadership is as close as can be to the Syrian\r\nstreet’s ambitions and to the hearts and minds of the\r\nSyrian people. It wants to work for peace, not to be\r\nsubjected to such horrible acts of aggression. That is\r\nwhat we mean when we say that Israel can export only\r\nviolence and destruction to its neighbours.\r\nI should like also to recall that it is well known\r\nthat the democratic Israeli system has been able to elect\r\nonly war criminals — Yitzhak Shamir was one of the\r\naccused in the assassination of Count Bernadotte, a\r\nsymbol of the United Nations. Is the current Prime\r\nMinister of Israel any better? Both of them have been\r\nmembers of organizations such as Hagganah and Stern,\r\ntwo organizations that have spread terror in the region\r\n— terror that was unprecedented before Israel existed.\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nIs occupation not the worst kind of terrorism and\r\noppression — killing children and civilians, bombing\r\nthem, destroying their houses and shooting missiles at\r\nthem from fighter jets? In addition, thousands of\r\npeople have been displaced because of all those acts of\r\naggression.\r\nI should like here to refer once again to the report\r\nof the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization. I would also like to add that the claim\r\nthat Syria is responsible for the loss of nineteen lives is\r\nbaseless and groundless. It attempts to find justification\r\nfor a Government that is facing serious crises internally\r\nand exports them to other countries in the form of false\r\nclaims.\r\nIn Syria, we have more than half a million\r\nPalestinian refugees who dream of going back home.\r\nSome of them still keep the keys to their homes. Who\r\nis denying them the right to return? It is Israel, in a\r\nclear and blatant violation of international legitimacy\r\nand of all United Nations resolutions, including\r\nresolution 194 (III) of the General Assembly.\r\nIf Israel considers these half million refugees as a\r\ncause of terrorism, then I can simply say that if those\r\npeople were allowed to return to their homes, the crisis\r\nwould be solved. Does Israel have the courage to take\r\nsuch a step, to allow them to return to their homes?\r\nGeographically, and for all practical purposes, half a\r\nmillion Palestinians who used to have normal lives are\r\nnow accused of terrorism whatever they do. Even when\r\nthe press pays attention to them, it is considered by\r\nIsrael as terrorism.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea for his second\r\nintervention, not to exceed five minutes.\r\nMr. Kim Chang Guk (Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea): The representative of Japan said\r\nthat Japan is concerned about the nuclear issue of the\r\nKorean peninsula. But I would like to ask Japan, is it\r\nnot true that Japanese authorities, including ministers,\r\nare clamouring for a pre-emptive strike against the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea? Is it not true\r\nthat Japan is revising their so-called peace constitution\r\nto endorse aggressive war against neighbouring\r\ncountries? Is it not true that Japan is reviving\r\nmilitarism? So I can say that the concern for security is\r\nof Japan’s own making.\r\nNow Japan is suppressing the activities of\r\nChongryon, the General Association for Korean\r\nResidents in Japan. Japanese authorities are inciting\r\nterrorists to fire guns at the Koreans in Japan. Japanese\r\nauthorities are conniving to have terrorists plant bombs\r\nin Chongryon’s buildings. Japanese authorities are\r\nhindering the business activities of Koreans in Japan.\r\nAll these issues are bringing the situation to the point\r\nof conflict. As for diplomatic relations, there will be no\r\nnormalization of relations between Japan and the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea as long as\r\nJapan does not compensate us, abrogate its hostile\r\npolicy towards the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea and correct its betrayal.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of\r\nIsrael for his second and final intervention of five\r\nminutes.\r\nMr. Mekel (Israel): I regret that I have to\r\nexercise my right to a second intervention to reply to\r\nthe Syrian representative, who today chose to turn this\r\nimportant debate on the follow-up to the outcome of\r\nthe Millennium Summit and the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral into a series of attacks against the State of\r\nIsrael. And now he pretends to be surprised that he is\r\ngetting the reply that he deserves.\r\nThe Syrian representative claims that Israel\r\nattacked a peaceful Syrian village. If that were not so\r\nsad, it would be amusing, because it is always very\r\namusing when one sees a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Let\r\nme say a few words about what Syria is doing about\r\nterrorism. First of all, the encouragement, safe harbour,\r\ntraining facilities, funding and logistical support\r\noffered by Syria to a variety of notorious terrorist\r\norganizations is a matter of public knowledge. Among\r\nthe many terrorist groups that operate under and benefit\r\nfrom the auspices of the Syrian dictatorship are the\r\nIslamic Jihad, Hamas, Hezbollah and the Popular Front\r\nfor the Liberation of Palestine. It is well known that the\r\nsecretary-general of the Islamic Jihad, Ramadan\r\nAbdullah Shallah, is one of several terrorist leaders\r\nwho operate freely in Damascus and receive immunity\r\nand support from the Assad regime.\r\nAllow me to briefly detail the extent of support\r\nthat Syria offers to terrorist organizations. This is what\r\nthey do: they provide safe harbour and training\r\nfacilities throughout Syria for terrorist organizations\r\nsuch as Islamic Jihad, Hamas and Hezbollah, both in\r\nseparate facilities and on Syrian army bases. Syria has\r\n29\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nitself facilitated and directed acts of terrorism by\r\ncoordinating and conducting briefings via phone and\r\nthe Internet and by calling activists to Damascus for\r\nconsultations and briefings. Syria uses its State-run\r\nmedia and official institutions to glorify and encourage\r\nsuicide bombings against civilians in restaurants, schools,\r\ncommuter buses and shopping malls in the State of Israel.\r\nSyria has facilitated the transfer of arms to Palestinian\r\nterrorist organizations such as Islamic Jihad by\r\nallowing the transfer of sophisticated weapons from\r\nIran to Hezbollah through Syrian territory. These are\r\njust a few examples of Syria’s complicity with terror.\r\nOn the other hand, Israel’s measured defensive\r\nresponse to the horrific suicide bombings, directed\r\nagainst the terrorist training facility in Syria, is a clear\r\nact of self-defence, in accordance with Article 51 of the\r\nCharter. This response comes after Israel has exercised\r\ntremendous restraint, despite countless acts of\r\nterrorism that have claimed hundreds of innocent lives\r\nand for which Syria bears direct and criminal\r\nresponsibility. It comes after Israel and the\r\ninternational community as a whole have repeatedly\r\ncalled on Syria to end its support of terrorism and to\r\nfinally comply with international law. It is designed to\r\nprevent further armed attacks against Israeli civilians in\r\nwhich Syria is complicit, with a view to encouraging\r\nSyria to resolve its dispute through bilateral\r\nnegotiations, in accordance with Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), as it legally is\r\nrequired to do.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of\r\nJapan for his second and final intervention of five\r\nminutes.\r\nMr. Haraguchi (Japan): I will be very brief. I\r\nwill touch on three points.\r\nFirst, the North Korean representative referred to\r\nan imaginary state of affairs, as if we, in Japan, have\r\npublicly endorsed a pre-emptive strike, have started\r\nrevising our Constitution or are reviving the military. I\r\ncategorically deny these things. Nothing of the sort has\r\nhappened in Japan.\r\nSecondly, as for our treatment of the Association\r\nfor North Korean Residents in Japan — Chongryon, if\r\nthat is what it is called in Korean — I must say that not\r\nonly this Chongryon but any other group of people or\r\norganization in Japan, as long as they are abiding by\r\nJapanese law, will continue to enjoy the protection of\r\nlaw and freedom. But if any people or organization,\r\nwhether Japanese or non-Japanese, violate Japanese\r\nlaw, they will be punished in accordance with the law.\r\nThis is quite natural.\r\nThirdly, I would like to repeat that the Pyongyang\r\nDeclaration was duly signed by the Prime Minister of\r\nJapan, Mr. Koizumi, and Chairman Kim Jong Il. Given\r\nall of the important issues referred to in that\r\nDeclaration, I would like to suggest to the North\r\nKorean representative that he read it very carefully.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of the\r\nSyrian Arab Republic for his second and final\r\nintervention of five minutes.\r\nMr. Nakkari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): We were planning to refrain from taking\r\nfurther part in this polemical exercise, but I am\r\nintrigued by the representative of Israel’s use of the\r\nexpression, “The wolf has become the victim”. I do not\r\nknow how many more thousands of Arabs need to die\r\nin our region in order for the representative of Israel to\r\nconsider the situation to be fair and just.\r\nI would like to quote from a story that appeared\r\nin the Israeli newspaper, Maarif, about 20 children who\r\nwere playing in an amusement park and suddenly\r\nbegan shouting, “Death to Arabs”, while their families\r\nlooked on with amusement. Another article from the\r\nsame newspaper states that such scenes are common.\r\nThe article also reports a conversation between two\r\npeople who, discussing the fact that 50 people had been\r\nkilled, expressed the wish that that number had been a\r\nhundred.\r\nRabbi Goldstein and Rabbi Schwinn, who are\r\nmembers of the Israeli organization Neturei Karta, have\r\ndescribed the Prime Minister of Israel, Ariel Sharon, as\r\nan ugly personification of Zionism. When addressing a\r\ngroup of Arabs, Rabbi Goldstein also said:\r\n“We would like to say to the Arabs, in particular\r\nthe Palestinians, that there is no war between\r\nthem and the Jews. The real Jews have never\r\nenjoyed peace and tranquillity except with their\r\nMuslim and Christian Arab brothers before the\r\nestablishment of the Zionist State.”\r\nThat may give an idea of the true terrorist attitude\r\nof Israel — an attitude that has preoccupied the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council for a very\r\nlong time. Israeli terror against all the countries of the\r\nregion and its policy of occupation and aggression\r\nknow no limits, despite the hundreds of resolutions that\r\n30\r\nA/58/PV.26\r\nhave been adopted — resolutions that would not have\r\nbeen renewed in the General Assembly if the settler\r\noccupier entity had abided by international law.\r\nWith regard to the claims that Syria is harbouring\r\nterrorists, I would like to state that in the 1980s we\r\nwere one of the earliest victims of terrorism while\r\nothers just looked on. With regard to Hizbullah, I\r\nshould like to point out that, in a letter contained in\r\ndocument A/56/226 responding to repeated claims by\r\nIsrael, we stated that the Government of Israel knew\r\nvery well that Hizbullah is a Lebanese party that works\r\non Lebanese territory, is supported by the Lebanese\r\npeople and receives no instructions from Syria.\r\nThe list of excuses, lies and false claims is\r\nendless. The more than 500,000 Palestinians who are in\r\nSyria are not terrorists, but ordinary citizens who\r\nwould like to return home. Yet their presence there is\r\nall it takes for the Israeli representative to claim that\r\nSyria is harbouring and supporting terrorism. Syria has\r\ninformation and humanitarian offices in Syria that\r\nprovide services to those needy people — people who\r\nhave resorted to living in Syrian territory because they\r\nare not allowed to live on their own land. We are\r\nsimply asking that they be allowed to go home.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\n"
