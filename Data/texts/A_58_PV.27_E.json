Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda items 53 and 54\r\nReport of the International Criminal Tribunal for\r\nthe Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide\r\nand Other Serious Violations of International\r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of\r\nRwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for\r\nGenocide and Other Such Violations Committed in\r\nthe Territory of Neighbouring States between\r\n1 January and 31 December 1994\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\neighth annual report of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal (A/58/140)\r\nReport of the International Tribunal for the\r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Serious\r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia\r\nsince 1991\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\ntenth annual report of the International\r\nTribunal (A/58/297)\r\nThe President: I should like to bring to the\r\nattention of representatives a technical error in\r\ndocument A/58/297. The formal name of the Tribunal\r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia is quoted wrongly in the\r\ndocument. The name should read as follows:\r\n“International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons\r\nResponsible for Serious Violations of International\r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia since 1991”. A corrigendum to that\r\neffect will be issued shortly.\r\nI give the floor to the representative of the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Botaru: On behalf of the Secretariat, I\r\nshould like to apologize for the late issuance of the\r\nreport of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution\r\nof Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of\r\nInternational Humanitarian Law Committed in the\r\nTerritory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991.\r\nThe President: May I take it that the Assembly\r\ntakes note of the eighth annual report of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that the Assembly\r\ntakes note of the tenth annual report of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I call on Mr. Erik Møse, President\r\nof the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.\r\nMr. Møse: It is a great honour to address the\r\nAssembly and to present the eighth annual report of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).\r\nThe report covers the period from 1 July 2002 to 30\r\nJune 2003, but it also provides an opportunity to take\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nstock of the results during the second four-year mandate\r\nof the judges, from 1999 to 2003, under the presidency of\r\nmy predecessor, Mr. Pillay. I shall also provide an\r\nupdate on the activities during the first four months of\r\nthe third mandate and indicate some of our projections.\r\nIn 2003, the ICTR is harvesting the fruit of the\r\nhard work of previous years. So far this year, three\r\njudgements, involving four accused, have been handed\r\ndown. The first judgement this year was delivered in\r\nFebruary. Two more judgements followed in May, and\r\nanother four judgements, involving eight accused, are\r\nexpected by the end of the year or very early next year.\r\nThe total number of judgements rendered as a\r\nconsequence of trials in the second mandate amounts to\r\nnine, involving 14 accused. That reflects a 100 per cent\r\nincrease in the number of accused who have been tried\r\nduring the Tribunal’s second mandate, as compared\r\nwith during its first mandate, from 1995 to 1999. And\r\nit means that soon, the Tribunal will have rendered 15\r\njudgements, involving 21 accused, since the first trials\r\nstarted in January 1997.\r\nTwo voluminous trials, involving a total of 10\r\naccused, started in the second mandate and are now\r\ncontinuing. That brings to 31 the total number of\r\naccused whose trials have been completed or are in\r\nprogress. Since the commencement of the third\r\nmandate, in June this year, the ICTR has begun two\r\nnew trials, each with one accused. The Prosecution has\r\nalready closed its case in those trials. In addition, two\r\ntrials, each involving four accused, are scheduled to\r\ncommence in November. Therefore, by the end of 2003,\r\nthe cases of a total of 41 accused will be completed or in\r\nprogress. During the period under review, the ICTR\r\nAppeals Chamber delivered two judgements. Three\r\nTrial Chamber judgements are currently on appeal. Let\r\nme also mention that cooperation with the ICTY and its\r\nPresident is excellent.\r\nThe commencement of four new trials, involving\r\n10 accused, during the second half of 2003, is a\r\nconsequence of the election by the Assembly of a pool\r\nof 18 ad litem judges in June this year. The first ad\r\nlitem judge took up office in Arusha on 1 September\r\n2003, and the other three will arrive there in a couple\r\nof weeks. Those four ad litem judges will be\r\nparticipating in four trials. I should like to thank the\r\nAssembly for making further progress possible.\r\nHowever, much work remains. At present, 22\r\ndetainees are awaiting trial. The ICTR is anxious to\r\ncommence those cases as soon as it has the capacity to\r\ndo so. On 29 September 2003, the ICTR requested the\r\nSecurity Council to increase the number of ad litem\r\njudges who can sit at any one time from four to nine. I\r\ncannot stress enough the importance of that proposal,\r\nwhich will increase the ICTR’s capacity from four to\r\nsix permanent Trial Chamber sections. The ICTR will\r\nthus enjoy the same judicial capacity for conducting\r\ntrials at first instance as that enjoyed by the ICTY.\r\nAnother significant reform would be to increase the\r\ncompetence of the ad litem judges to do pre-trial work.\r\nA request to that effect was submitted to the Security\r\nCouncil in early September. Those two statutory\r\namendments are instrumental to the timely completion\r\nof the Tribunal’s mandate.\r\nAt the commencement of its third mandate, the\r\nICTR has considered it a priority to elaborate a\r\ncompletion strategy. The first version of that document\r\nwas submitted to United Nations Headquarters in July;\r\nit was prepared within the context of General Assembly\r\nresolution 57/289. A revised version was sent to the\r\nSecurity Council on 29 September 2003 and will be\r\nissued as document S/2003/946. That revised version\r\ntakes into account Security Council resolution 1503\r\n(2003), in which the Council called on the Tribunals\r\nfor the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda to take all\r\npossible measures to complete all trial activities at first\r\ninstance by the end of 2008.\r\nIn the completion strategy, it is estimated that,\r\nwith four ad litem judges, ICTR will be in a position to\r\nfinalize all ongoing trials, together with cases involving\r\nthe remaining 22 detainees, by 2007. However, by the\r\nend of 2008 — the target date set by the Security\r\nCouncil — only about eight other accused could be\r\nbrought for trial, out of a maximum of 16 indictees\r\nwho are still at large and a maximum of 26 suspects\r\nwho have not been apprehended. These projections\r\nmay have to be revised. Unforeseen circumstances may\r\ncause delays. However, with an increase from four to\r\nnine ad litem judges, the Tribunal will be in a better\r\nposition to finalize most trials by the 2008 target date.\r\nIn resolution 1503 (2003), the Security Council\r\ndecided to establish a separate Prosecutor for ICTR. I\r\nwould like to thank the previous Prosecutor, Ms. Carla\r\nDel Ponte, for her great contributions to ICTR. I was\r\nalso very pleased to welcome the new Prosecutor, Mr.\r\nHassan Jallow, when he took up office in Arusha on 3\r\nOctober 2003.\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nDuring the period under review, a number of\r\nreforms were implemented with a view to further\r\nimproving efficiency. The establishment of a so-called\r\nnew trials committee, composed of representatives\r\nfrom all three branches of the Tribunal, facilitated the\r\ncommencement of the four new trials I have just\r\nreferred to. During trial, valuable time is now saved by\r\nthe simultaneous interpretation from Kinyarwanda into\r\nEnglish and French in all Trial Chambers. That was not\r\npreviously the case. Moreover, the judges have adopted\r\nnumerous amendments to the Rules of Procedure and\r\nEvidence. Of particular importance was an amendment\r\nof Rule l5 bis, which makes it possible to continue a\r\ntrial with a substitute judge where a judge falls ill, dies,\r\nresigns or is not re-elected, thereby eliminating the\r\nneed to commence the trial de novo. This provision has\r\nalready been applied. Another amendment was the\r\nestablishment of a procedure to facilitate plea\r\nagreements in cases in which an accused has expressed\r\nthe intention of pleading guilty. In this context, I\r\nshould draw the Assembly’s attention to an important\r\ndifference between ICTR and ICTY. Only three persons\r\nhave pleaded guilty at ICTR, whereas the\r\ncorresponding number at ICTY is 15. Finally, let me\r\nmention that proposals from a working group to\r\naccelerate the pre-trial proceedings are presently under\r\nconsideration by the judges.\r\nThe Rules have been amended to create a\r\nCoordination Council composed of the President, the\r\nProsecutor and the Registrar. This new organ has\r\nalready served its purpose, which is to facilitate the\r\ncoordination of the activities of the three ICTR organs.\r\nInternational criminal justice is necessary, but\r\ncostly. An important part of the expenses relates to the\r\ndefence teams. On 20 December 2002, this Assembly\r\nadopted resolution 57/289, requesting a report on our\r\nTribunal’s legal aid system. A consultant, a British\r\njudge, was subsequently appointed to furnish a report\r\nand to make recommendations on the improvement of\r\nour legal aid system. Based on his very useful\r\ndocument, the Registry recently submitted to United\r\nNations Headquarters its report on the Tribunal’s\r\nprogress in reforming the legal aid programme. Some\r\nof the consultant’s recommendations have already been\r\nacted upon and other proposals are being followed up. I\r\nshould mention that the experience both at ICTR and\r\nICTY illustrates that there are no easy answers here.\r\nICTR will continue to seek solutions which reduce\r\ncosts but without curtailing the right to an efficient\r\ndefence. Let me also pay tribute to defence counsel’s\r\ncontribution to a fair trial within reasonable time.\r\nIn 2002, ICTR experienced difficulties over the\r\nflow of witnesses from Rwanda. I am now very pleased\r\nto report that the situation has improved. For many\r\nmonths, there has been a steady flow of witnesses from\r\nKigali to Arusha. ICTR wants to maintain and develop\r\na harmonious relationship that will make it easier for\r\nthe Tribunal to contribute to reconciliation within\r\nRwanda. We were recently very pleased to receive two\r\ngroups of 10 Rwandan judicial officers, each composed\r\nof judges, prosecutors and officials from the Ministry\r\nof Justice, and we hope that other representatives of\r\nRwandan society will visit the Tribunal soon.\r\nIn this connection, allow me to recall that the\r\nevents of 1994 have given rise to three sets of judicial\r\nproceedings. At the national level, the ordinary\r\nRwandan courts have been supplemented by the\r\nestablishment of so-called gacaca courts based on\r\ntraditional justice, including lay judges, confessions\r\nand reconciliation. At the international level, ICTR is\r\nhearing trials involving the alleged leaders in 1994.\r\nThese three proceedings are not mutually exclusive,\r\nbut supplement each other and can all contribute to\r\njustice and reconciliation in Rwanda. Let me also recall\r\nthat as early as 2000, ICTR expressed support for the\r\nprinciple of compensation, or rather reparation, for\r\nvictims. The responsibility for processing and\r\nassessing claims for such compensation is, however,\r\nnot a task for the Tribunal. I am pleased to note that\r\nthis week, the President of the Human Rights\r\nCommission, who is presently in Arusha, committed\r\nherself to advocating for a special trust fund for victims\r\nof genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\r\nFinally, let me reiterate our appreciation to Benin,\r\nMali and Swaziland for having entered into agreements\r\nto enforce sentences handed down by ICTR. Mali has\r\nreceived five convicts. In March 2003, ICTR signed an\r\nagreement with France to enforce sentences handed\r\ndown by the Tribunal. Similar agreements are likely to be\r\nconcluded with other countries. I also thank all Member\r\nStates for their cooperation, including in respect of\r\narrests, transfers of indicted persons and travel of\r\nwitnesses. The Tribunal also thanks the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his continued support.\r\nThe President: I call on Mr. Theodor Meron,\r\nPresident of the International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia.\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nMr. Meron: It is a great honour for me to address\r\nthis distinguished Assembly to present the tenth annual\r\nreport of the International Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia. Let me first express my profound gratitude\r\nfor the support that you, the General Assembly, have\r\nalways afforded the Tribunal.\r\nI would also like to pay tribute to the wisdom and\r\ndedication of my predecessor as President of the\r\nTribunal, Claude Jorda of France. Judge Jorda served\r\nas President of the Tribunal during much of the period\r\nupon which I report to you today.\r\nThat period, August 2002 to July 2003, has been\r\none of great progress and accomplishment for the\r\nTribunal. Our Trial Chambers and Appeals Chamber\r\nhave heard more cases than ever before. An increasing\r\nnumber of defendants have decided to plead guilty,\r\nexpress remorse for their crimes and offer assistance to\r\nthe Prosecution in other cases. A significant number of\r\nimportant offenders against international humanitarian\r\nlaw have been brought to justice. In pursuance of our\r\nstrategy to bring the work of the Tribunal to a close in\r\na timely and equitable fashion, we have continued to\r\nundertake internal reforms designed to improve the\r\nefficiency of our proceedings, while scrupulously\r\nobserving international norms for due process and fair\r\ntrial. We have moved ahead with efforts to enable our\r\nTribunal to refer certain cases of mid- and lower-level\r\noffenders to courts in the States of the former Yugoslavia,\r\nespecially the State Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nStill, much work remains to be done. We need to do\r\neven more to improve the efficiency of our proceedings.\r\nWe must move forward at full speed with efforts to assist\r\nin the establishment of national courts in the region of\r\nthe former Yugoslavia that are capable of hearing cases\r\nof war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide,\r\nfairly and without any taint of ethnic, religious, or\r\nnational prejudice. We must step up our efforts to\r\nensure that the peoples of the former Yugoslavia\r\nreceive a balanced and honest account of the work of our\r\nTribunal. And we must push for complete — I repeat,\r\ncomplete — cooperation from all Member States, and\r\nespecially from the States of the former Yugoslavia, in\r\nseeing to it that justice is done for the thousands and\r\nthousands of victims of the Yugoslav conflicts who lost\r\ntheir lives, loved ones, property and physical and\r\nemotional well-being.\r\nLet me begin by reviewing with you some of the\r\nTribunal’s central accomplishments during the past\r\nyear. The pace of the Tribunal’s activities has reached\r\nan all-time high. The Tribunal continues to honour the\r\ncommitments that it made to the Security Council.\r\nWith morning and afternoon sessions in its three\r\ncourtrooms, its Trial Chambers conduct between four\r\nand six trials at a time. During the year in review, they\r\nexamined 29 cases on their merits as well as three\r\ncases of contempt and rendered four final judgments on\r\nthe merits or sentencing judgments.\r\nThe trial of Slobodan Milosevic, former head of\r\nState of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, continued\r\nbefore Trial Chamber III. The defendant’s health has\r\nled to a great number of delays, and it is, I would like\r\nthe Assembly to know, an extraordinarily complex\r\ncase. It brings together what had been three separate\r\nindictments, for Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia, with 66\r\ncounts, hundreds of witnesses, tens of thousands of\r\npages of documents, most of which must be translated\r\nfrom Serbo-Croatian into English and French, the\r\nTribunal’s working languages. But the Prosecution’s\r\ncase is coming to a close soon, and the timetable for\r\nthe defence case has begun to be established.\r\nThe Appeals Chamber, too, has disposed of a\r\ngreater number of appeals than in years past. During\r\nthe period under consideration, the Appeals Chamber\r\ndisposed of 36 interlocutory appeals, two requests for\r\nreview, and two contempt proceedings, and handed\r\ndown one judgement on the merits.\r\nThe Trial Chambers also received an increasing\r\nnumber of guilty pleas resulting from plea agreements,\r\nincluding from Biljana Plavsic, former Co-President of\r\nthe Republika Srpska. A total of 16 have now pleaded\r\nguilty at the ICTY. I recognize that because of the\r\negregious nature of the crimes charged before the\r\nICTY, and because the Tribunal’s roles include\r\nproviding some vindication for the victims and\r\ncontributing to the creation of an accurate record of\r\nterrible atrocities, some are hesitant about a too-\r\nfrequent recourse to plea agreements. These concerns\r\nare certainly understandable and legitimate. But I\r\nbelieve that, with properly-detailed acknowledgement\r\nby defendants of their participation in the crimes for\r\nwhich they acknowledge guilt and make genuine\r\nexpressions of remorse, plea agreements can play a\r\nconstructive role.\r\nIn some cases, a forthright and specific\r\nacknowledgement of guilt may offer victims as much,\r\nor even more, consolation than would a conviction\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nfollowing repeated protestations of innocence.\r\nMoreover, as a practical matter, the cooperation\r\nsecured through plea agreements, which of course are\r\nnot binding on the Tribunal, plays an important role in\r\nsecuring convictions of more important participants in\r\nthe large-scale crimes, and the time and resources\r\nsaved by avoiding trials in some cases contributes\r\nsignificantly to the Tribunal’s ability to meet the time\r\nlines indicated by the Security Council for the\r\ncompletion of its work.\r\nWith those deadlines in mind, the Tribunal has\r\nworked hard this past year to advance its completion\r\nstrategy, a plan of internal reforms and external\r\ninitiatives designed to enable the Tribunal to finish its\r\nwork within the deadlines set by the Security Council.\r\nInternally, we have undertaken a series of\r\njudicially initiated reforms designed to improve the\r\nefficiency of our proceedings. The most important of\r\nthese was the removal of the ban on ad litem judges\r\nadjudicating in pre-trial matters. At my urging, and in\r\naccordance with an earlier recommendation by my\r\npredecessor, Judge Claude Jorda, the Security Council,\r\non 19 May 2003, unanimously adopted resolution 1481\r\n(2003), amending the Tribunal’s Statute to permit ad\r\nlitem judges to undertake pre-trial work. This reform\r\nenables ad litem judges to make more efficient use of\r\ntheir time and to enhance their already important\r\ncontribution to the work of the Tribunal, thus helping it\r\nto bring cases to completion more expeditiously.\r\nAt plenary meetings in December 2002 and July\r\n2003, the judges adopted a number of amendments to\r\nthe Tribunal’s rule of procedure designed to improve\r\nefficiency. One revises the methods for permitting\r\ncontinuation of trials when one of the judges hearing\r\nthe case is unable to continue, thus reducing the risk of\r\nmistrials and retrials. Another gives Trial Chambers\r\nenhanced authority to restrict the scope of the\r\nprosecution’s case, thus avoiding the presentation of\r\nredundant and unnecessarily time-consuming evidence.\r\nExternally, the past year has seen a major advance\r\nfor the completion strategy through the advancement of\r\na plan to create a special war crimes chamber in the\r\nState Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The\r\nestablishment of the war crimes chamber in Sarajevo\r\nwill provide a forum to which the Tribunal may\r\ntransfer a number of cases of lower- and mid-level\r\naccused. In anticipation of the Chamber’s creation, the\r\nTribunal judges amended rule 11 bis at a special\r\nplenary meeting in September 2002 to set out the\r\ncriteria that must be satisfied before a case may be\r\nreferred to a domestic court once an indictment has\r\nbeen confirmed.\r\nAfter months of negotiation, in February 2003\r\nPresident Jorda entered into an agreement with the\r\nOffice of the High Representative (OHR) for the\r\nestablishment of the new chamber. In August, the\r\nSecurity Council added its imprimatur through the\r\nadoption of resolution 1503 (2003). A donors’\r\nconference will be held on 30 October at the Tribunal\r\nin The Hague, and a series of working groups composed\r\nof personnel from OHR, the Tribunal and other interested\r\norganizations will develop the detailed policies needed\r\nto get the War Crimes Chamber running.\r\nWhile the completion strategy has made major\r\nstrides in the past year, I look forward to equally\r\nimportant developments in the year ahead. First, as the\r\nSecurity Council made clear in resolution 1503 (2003),\r\nthe completion strategy requires a further focusing of\r\nthe Tribunal’s mission on trying the most significant\r\noffenders against international public order. The\r\nProsecutor, of course, possesses the authority to select\r\nthe individuals who will be charged before the\r\nTribunal. Thus, it is primarily the Prosecutor’s\r\nresponsibility to ensure compliance with the Security\r\nCouncil’s direction that the Tribunal concentrate on the\r\nprosecution and trial of the most senior leaders\r\nsuspected of being most responsible for crimes within\r\nthe Tribunal’s jurisdiction.\r\nWhile we are striving in every way possible to\r\nmeet the goals of completing all trials by the end of\r\n2008 and all appeals by the end of 2010, one cannot\r\npredict with scientific accuracy the completion date of\r\njudicial proceedings. Many factors may affect the\r\noutcome. Some of those influences are within the\r\ncontrol of the Tribunal, others not; and of the former,\r\nsome are within the control of the judges and others\r\nwithin the power of the Prosecutor.\r\nI am happy to report that we should be able to\r\ncomplete the trials of all individuals currently in the\r\ncustody of the Tribunal, including those on provisional\r\nrelease — both individuals whose trials have already\r\nbegun and individuals who are in pre-trial proceedings\r\n— by the 2008 deadline.\r\nAlready confirmed indictments cover an\r\nadditional 17 individuals who are at large. The sooner\r\nfugitives are turned in, the greater the number of guilty\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\npleas that will be received; and the greater the number\r\nof cases that can be transferred to Sarajevo, the sooner\r\nwe will be able to finish the trials of these cases.\r\nSubject to a variety of circumstances, it may be\r\npossible to complete the trials of some indicted\r\nfugitives within the time frame established for the 2008\r\ndeadline, but it will not be possible to complete them\r\nall by that time.\r\nThe handing over of fugitives, of course, is\r\noutside the Tribunal’s control. It depends above all on\r\nthe cooperation of the States of the former Yugoslavia.\r\nI join my predecessors in urging the Assembly to press\r\nall Member States to cooperate fully and promptly with\r\nthe Tribunal’s work.\r\nI recently travelled to Belgrade on the first ever\r\nofficial visit there by the Tribunal’s President, and I am\r\nencouraged by an emerging spirit of cooperation with\r\nthe Tribunal. This is a good beginning. But much\r\nremains to be done — on arrests of fugitives, access to\r\nevidence and facilitation of witness testimony,\r\nespecially by present and former officials.\r\nI must tell the Assembly that, based on current\r\nprojections, it will not be possible to accommodate new\r\nindictments within the time frame indicated by the\r\nCouncil. I say this while fully recognizing that it is the\r\nProsecutor’s prerogative to select the individuals\r\nagainst whom she will file indictments and that if the\r\nProsecution has sufficient evidence to make a prima\r\nfacie case, we judges must confirm the indictments.\r\nOne thing must be clear, however: once indictments\r\nhave been submitted and confirmed by the judges, the\r\nlegal process will have started, and will have to run its\r\ncourse, in accordance with the governing law and the\r\ndemands of due process. A strict application of the\r\ntarget dates for the completion strategy must not — I\r\nrepeat, must not — result in impunity, particularly for\r\nthe most senior leaders suspected of being most\r\nresponsible for the crimes within the Tribunal’s\r\njurisdiction.\r\nSecondly, as I noted a moment ago, with respect\r\nto the Sarajevo War Crimes Chamber, we are moving\r\nfrom plans to action. We should be able to begin\r\ntransferring some cases by 2005.\r\nThirdly, we are continuing to search for ways to\r\nstreamline our procedures. I have revitalized a\r\ncommittee of judges called the Judicial Practices\r\nWorking Group, giving it a mandate to develop and\r\nanalyse proposals to shorten trials and speed the\r\nhearing of appeals. The Prosecutor has recently\r\ncirculated a group of proposals with the same goal in\r\nmind, and the judges are actively considering and\r\nreshaping a number of them. The Rules Committee of\r\nthe judges has some of these proposals submitted by\r\nthe Prosecutor under active consideration. The\r\nCommittee will recommend a package of reforms\r\naimed at improving the rules of disclosure, pre-trial\r\nmanagement and presentation of evidence to the judges\r\nduring the regular plenary meeting in December. The\r\npurpose is to balance the interests of the Prosecutor and\r\nthe accused so that the task of the former is\r\nmanageable, while the rights of the latter to a fair trial\r\nremain protected.\r\nTen years ago, the Security Council created the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia with\r\nthe goal of putting an end to impunity for mass\r\natrocities and serious violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law. During the past decade, with the\r\nconstant support of the Assembly, the Tribunal has\r\nmade a fundamental and lasting contribution to\r\nbringing justice to the peoples of the former Yugoslavia\r\nby holding to account a considerable number of\r\naccused of high rank.\r\nEnsuring that justice is done requires skilful\r\nwork, on the part not only of the Tribunal’s judges, but\r\nalso of its staff. It will be more and more difficult —\r\nparticularly as the completion of the Tribunal’s work\r\ncomes into sight — to retain and attract staff of the\r\nhighest calibre unless opportunities for advancement\r\nare made available. The creation of additional criminal\r\njurisdictions creates additional pressure in this regard. I\r\nhope that the members of the Assembly and of the\r\nSecurity Council will recognize the importance of this\r\nissue and support our proposals to address it.\r\nLet me conclude by saying that if we are to\r\ncomplete our mission in a timely fashion, we must have\r\nthe support, not only of this Assembly as a collective\r\nbody, but also of each and every one of its members,\r\nespecially the States of the former Yugoslavia.\r\nFugitives must be arrested, above all Radovan Karadzic\r\nand Ratko Mladic, as well as Ante Gotovina. Evidence\r\nmust be turned over promptly. Only then will the\r\nTribunal be able to complete the important mission\r\nassigned to it by the Security Council a decade ago.\r\nMr. Mustapha (Malaysia): I should like first of\r\nall to congratulate Judge Erik Møse on his recent\r\nappointment as the new President of the International\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). I commend\r\nJudge Erik Møse and Judge Theodor Meron, the\r\nPresident of the International Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia (ICTY), on their introduction of the reports\r\nof the two Tribunals.\r\nMalaysia fully appreciates the achievements\r\nmade, and the difficulties faced by, the two Tribunals,\r\nas reflected in the reports before us. We commend the\r\nmembers of the Chambers, the Prosecution and the\r\nRegistry for their hard work and for their contributions.\r\nThe Tribunals have a significant role in promoting\r\nthe rule of law and in ensuring that the principles of\r\njustice and equality are upheld. The importance of the\r\nwork of the Tribunals in the fight against impunity for\r\nthe most serious crimes against humanity is not to be\r\nunderestimated. The Tribunals demonstrate that\r\ngenocide and other serious violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law will not be tolerated and that the\r\nperpetrators of such crimes must face retribution. The\r\nTribunals contribute to the essential process of making\r\nthe international criminal justice system effective, and\r\ninduce States to fulfil their responsibilities in bringing\r\nto justice people who have committed despicable acts\r\nand atrocities against other people.\r\nWe acknowledge the fact that the high-quality\r\njudgments and decisions of the Tribunals have\r\ncontributed, and will continue to contribute, to the\r\ndevelopment of international jurisprudence related to\r\ninternational criminal prosecution. Undoubtedly, case\r\nlaw developed by the Tribunals will also further\r\naugment case law on international humanitarian law in\r\nrespect of procedure, competence and substantive\r\nissues. This, in turn, will pave the way for the future\r\nwork of the International Criminal Court.\r\nI will first comment on the activities of the ICTR.\r\nWe are pleased to note the continued efficiency in\r\nthe operations of the ICTR and the improvements made\r\nthat have enabled it to accelerate its work. The\r\navailability of simultaneous translation and the changes\r\nmade to the rules of procedure and evidence to\r\nfacilitate proceedings are among the welcome\r\nimprovements that will indeed contribute to avoiding\r\nneedlessly lengthy trials. We recognize that extreme\r\ncare has been taken to balance efficiency in expediting\r\ntrials with fair trial procedure.\r\nWe deem timely the creation of the Coordination\r\nCouncil, to facilitate coordination of the three organs\r\nof the Tribunal; the Management Committee, to\r\nsupervise Registry activities relating to administrative\r\nand judicial support to the Chambers and judges; and\r\nthe External Relations and Strategic Planning Section,\r\nto enhance the cooperation between the Tribunal and\r\nGovernments, international organizations and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. Their creation will\r\nundoubtedly enhance the Tribunal’s judicial capacity\r\nand its ability to fulfil its mandate.\r\nThe election of the pool of 18 ad litem judges for\r\nthe Tribunal took place on 25 June 2003. Among the\r\nnewly elected ad litem judges is a distinguished former\r\nmember of the Malaysian judiciary who is ready and\r\nable to assist the Tribunal. Malaysia once again extends\r\nits appreciation to Members of the United Nations for\r\nhaving elected him to that position. We believe that the\r\nad litem judges will allow the Tribunal remarkably to\r\nincrease its judicial productivity and to meet the\r\ndemands of the anticipated rise in the number of cases.\r\nWe note the restriction faced by the Tribunal in\r\navailing itself of the pool of ad litem judges. We hope\r\nthat the Security Council will take cognizance of the\r\nproblems faced by the Tribunal in this regard and take\r\nappropriate steps to address them. We believe that the\r\nTribunal must be given the opportunity fully to utilize\r\nthe pool of ad litem judges as it deems reasonable, fit\r\nand necessary. The Tribunal must be in a position to\r\nundertake its tasks efficiently, so that detainees are\r\nspared undue delays in the completion of their trials.\r\nThe adoption of Security Council resolution 1505\r\n(2003) on 4 September 2003 marked an important\r\ndevelopment in the history of the ICTR. Indeed, the\r\nsplitting of the prosecutorial duties for the ICTR and the\r\nICTY — which had previously been under one\r\nProsecutor, Ms. Carla Del Ponte — was essential at a\r\ntime when both Tribunals were moving towards their\r\nrespective completion strategies. That move will enable\r\nthe respective prosecutors to focus their attention on\r\nthe conduct of outstanding investigations and\r\nprosecutions. We wish to thank Ms. Del Ponte for her\r\nsignificant contribution to the work of the ICTR. We\r\nalso congratulate Mr. Hassan Bubacar Jallow on his\r\nappointment as the new Prosecutor of the ICTR.\r\nThe Prosecution’s constant revision and reforms\r\nto meet its targets in fulfilling the mandate of the\r\nTribunal is commendable. They will facilitate further\r\nprogress in the work of the Prosecution. In this regard,\r\nwe note that the Prosecution has identified 40 suspects\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nand intends to defer their prosecution to national\r\njurisdictions. That move will pave the way for the\r\nTribunal fully to concentrate on trying those who bear\r\nthe greatest responsibility for crimes committed.\r\nHowever, caution must be exercised in implementing\r\nthis arrangement, so as to ensure that no perpetrator\r\ngoes unpunished.\r\nIt is critical to the success of the Tribunal that the\r\npeople of the region be informed of its work and\r\ncomprehend its significance. We appreciate the\r\nperseverance of the Registrar in promoting greater\r\nawareness of the Tribunal and in engaging the interest\r\nand support of the local population, the States of the\r\nregion and the international community. We encourage\r\nhim to continue his efforts. We are also pleased to note\r\nthe continued success of the outreach programme, as\r\nwell as gender and victims assistance programmes.\r\nI would now in turn comment on the activities of\r\nthe ICTY. Malaysia is mindful that the process of\r\nachieving justice may take many years. At the same\r\ntime, we are always reminded of the saying, “justice\r\ndelayed is justice denied”. The ICTY is now in its\r\neleventh year of existence. The reform process of the\r\nTribunal, initiated to speed up the process of meting\r\nout justice is proceeding smoothly. My delegation is\r\npleased to note that, to date, the Tribunal has indicted\r\n74 individuals, 56 of whom are currently in\r\nproceedings before the Tribunal and 51 in detention.\r\nThe Tribunal had also completed 35 cases. We\r\nappreciate the work done so far.\r\nHowever, we note with great concern that 17\r\nindividuals are still at large. The delayed apprehension\r\nof these individuals, in particular the major and earliest\r\nindicted war criminals, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko\r\nMladic, should be a matter of serious concern to the\r\ninternational community. They must be apprehended and\r\nbrought to justice. Those concerned must use every means\r\nto achieve this objective. The mandate of the Tribunal\r\nwill not be complete if they remain at large and are not\r\nbrought to trial. In this connection, the commitment by\r\nthe countries in the region to genuine cooperation with\r\nthe Tribunal in handing over indicted war criminals\r\nbelieved to be in their territories is critical. The\r\ncountries concerned must meet without hesitation the\r\ncall for cooperation by the Prosecutor. Otherwise, the\r\ncompletion strategy of the ICTY will be delayed.\r\nThe mandate and objectives of the ICTR and\r\nICTY will only be achieved with the fullest\r\ncooperation of the international community,\r\nparticularly the countries in the regions concerned.\r\nNeedless to say, the sustained commitment by the\r\nmajor Powers will also be crucial. The consequences of\r\nethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity that were\r\nperpetrated in Rwanda and the Balkans must be\r\nrepaired through justice. Such heinous crimes must not\r\nbe tolerated and must never be allowed to happen\r\nagain. Without justice there can be no genuine peace.\r\nIn reiterating its fullest support for both the Tribunals,\r\nMalaysia calls, once again, on the international\r\ncommunity to give its unreserved support to the ICTR\r\nand ICTY in carrying out their respective mandates.\r\nMr. Kusljugić (Bosnia and Herzegovina): Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina welcomes the report that the\r\nPresident of the International Tribunal for the former\r\nYugoslavia (ICTY) submitted to the Secretary-General.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to thank both\r\nPresident Judge Meron and Chief Prosecutor Del Ponte\r\nfor the outstanding efforts they make to bring justice,\r\nwhich will contribute to the reconciliation process in\r\nmy country.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina fully supports the ICTY’s\r\nactivities and is committed to fulfil its obligations related\r\nto cooperation with the Tribunal. We are committed to\r\nstay the course for the strategy of success that has been\r\ndefined to overcome, as soon as possible, the difficult\r\nlegacy of the past and to start building, with mutual\r\nunderstanding, a modern Bosnia and Herzegovina. Only\r\nin that way may we pass along to future generations a\r\nmessage of a world of peace and development, based\r\non mutual understanding and tolerance.\r\nWe consider that the Tribunal plays an important\r\nrole in the process of inter-ethnic reconciliation in the\r\ncountry as well as in South-East Europe, since its work\r\nis based upon establishing individual responsibility for\r\nthe war crimes. We also believe that the work of the\r\nICTY will reveal new evidence regarding the atrocities\r\ncommitted between 1992 and 1995, thus providing new\r\nfacts about the true nature of the conflict in the region.\r\nWe stress that in the past, the responsible\r\ninstitutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in cooperation\r\nwith the experts of the Office of the High\r\nRepresentative, have made measurable progress,\r\nespecially in the process of restructuring the Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina court systems at all levels. The new\r\nLegal Reform Unit, High Judicial and Prosecutorial\r\nCouncils and Special Chamber in the State Court, as\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nwell as the Special Department in the Prosecutor’s\r\nOffice in the country, are now functioning. Together\r\nwith the Criminal Code, which entered into force on 1\r\nMarch 2003, the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina is\r\nnow operative. This will enable the ICTY to begin to\r\ntransfer some mid- and low-level cases of the accused\r\nby the end of next year. However, we expect that the\r\napprehension and trial of the most notorious offenders\r\nwill remain the continuing responsibility of the United\r\nNations and the international community.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina trusts that the ICTY will\r\ntake every possible measure to complete investigations\r\nby the end of 2004, all activities of the Court of First\r\nInstance by the end of 2008 and all work in 2010, as\r\ndecided in Security Council resolution 1503 (2003) of\r\n28 August. In order to better meet the requirements of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions with regard to the work of\r\nthe ICTY, especially resolution 1503 (2003), Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina is fully committed to fulfil all its\r\nobligations and is ready to cooperate with the\r\nresponsible authorities of the countries of the region in\r\napprehending all remaining persons at large who have\r\nbeen indicted by the ICTY. Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nexpresses its hope that, as part of the completion\r\nstrategy, the international community will assist the\r\nnational judicial system by improving its capacity to\r\nprosecute cases transferred to it from the ICTY. Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina expects that the ICTY will develop\r\nand improve its outreach programmes as well.\r\nThe war criminals who remain at large are a\r\ncontinuing source of instability in the region. We\r\nunderline that lasting and stable peace in the region\r\nwill not be achieved unless all suspected war criminals,\r\nincluding the two most notorious, Radovan Karadzic\r\nand Ratko Mladic, are brought to justice.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to urge the\r\nMember States to provide all necessary technical,\r\nfinancial and political support for the forthcoming\r\npreparatory activities, as well as the contributing\r\nnations to pledge their generous support at the donors\r\nconference, to be held on 30 October in The Hague, in\r\norder to enable the Special Chamber in the State Court\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina to become fully operative\r\nas soon as possible.\r\nMr. Mantovani (Italy): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union. The acceding\r\ncountries Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia\r\nand Slovenia; the associated countries Bulgaria,\r\nRomania and Turkey; and the European Free Trade\r\nAssociation countries, members of the European\r\nEconomic Area, Iceland and Liechtenstein, declare that\r\nthey align themselves with this statement.\r\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda\r\n(ICTR), through its work, has made and continues to\r\nmake a substantial contribution to the replacement of a\r\nculture of impunity by a culture of accountability, thus\r\nplaying an important role in the process of national\r\nreconciliation in Rwanda and in the maintenance of\r\npeace and security in the region. Together with the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\r\n(ICTY), the Rwanda Tribunal has been contributing to\r\nthe development of international criminal law. The two\r\nad hoc Tribunals represent a cornerstone in the\r\nuniversal affirmation of the principle that, in the words\r\nof the Secretary-General,\r\n“there can be no healing without peace; there can\r\nbe no peace without justice; and there can be no\r\njustice without respect for human rights and the\r\nrule of law”.\r\nWith great satisfaction, the European Union takes\r\nnote of the recent efforts of the Tribunal. In the past\r\nyear, nine trials, involving 23 accused, have been\r\nconducted, while judgements have been delivered in\r\nthree cases involving four accused. The European\r\nUnion therefore would like strongly to reaffirm its full\r\nsupport for ICTR, its work and its mandate as one of\r\nthe main tools of our collective determination to bring\r\npeace to societies disrupted by atrocious conflicts.\r\nWe are all aware, of course, that, since its inception,\r\nICTR has faced a number of practical difficulties which\r\nhave rendered the performance of its tasks at times not\r\neasy and burdensome. In addition, the complexity of\r\nthe cases, the need for voluminous disclosure and\r\ntranslation of documents, the transportation of\r\nwitnesses from all parts of the world and the\r\navailability of witnesses — all these facts contribute to\r\nthe disappointingly slow pace of trials at ICTR to date.\r\nHowever, the Tribunal has put considerable effort\r\ninto overcoming the many obstacles that it has\r\nencountered so far and has adopted a number of\r\nmeasures aimed at expediting pre-trial and trial\r\nproceedings. In particular, the progress and\r\nadvancements achieved in the Tribunal’s work over the\r\npast year are described in the new annual report\r\nsubmitted by its President, whom the European Union\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nwould like warmly to thank for his work. The European\r\nUnion takes this opportunity to welcome the new\r\nPresident of ICTR, Judge Erik Møse, and to thank the\r\nformer President, Judge Navanethem Pillay — now\r\njudge of the International Criminal Court — for the\r\naccomplishment of her duties and wishes them both\r\nevery success in their new endeavours.\r\nThe European Union further welcomes the\r\nelection on 25 June 2003, pursuant to Security Council\r\nresolution 1431 (2002), of a pool of 18 ad litem judges\r\nand the fact that a number of them have already been\r\ncalled to work on some of the Tribunal’s cases. At the\r\nsame time, the European Union recommends increasing\r\n— as underlined in the report of the President of the\r\nCourt — the number of ad litem judges as soon as\r\npossible in order to ensure a timely completion of\r\nICTR’s mandate. Furthermore, the amendment of the\r\nStatute must lead to an increase of judicial output and\r\ncontribute to the overall completion strategy. The\r\nEuropean Union reiterates the importance of ICTR’s\r\nmaking every effort to respect the deadlines of the\r\ncompletion strategy — namely, 2004 for the completion\r\nof investigations, 2008 for the completion of trials and\r\n2010 for the completion of appeals.\r\nAll the branches of the Tribunal have\r\ndemonstrated continued dedication in their work, in\r\nparticular the Prosecutor. During the period under\r\nreview, the Prosecutor’s Office has continued to\r\nimplement its strategy in investigating new cases and\r\npreparing some of the most complex cases for trial, in\r\nview of the timely completion of the assigned task.\r\nBy its resolution 1503 (2003), the Security\r\nCouncil further decided to amend the Statute of the\r\nTribunal in order to split the positions of Prosecutor of\r\nICTY and the Prosecutor of ICTR with a view to easing\r\nthe prosecutorial workload in the implementation of\r\nthose Tribunals’ respective completion strategies. The\r\nEuropean Union would like to express its highest\r\nappreciation for the efficient and knowledgeable work\r\ndone by Ms. Carla Del Ponte, former Chief Prosecutor\r\nof both Tribunals, and to express its strong support for\r\nher future commitment as Prosecutor of ICTY. The\r\nEuropean Union also welcomes the prompt\r\nappointment of Mr. Hassan Bubacar Jallow as\r\nProsecutor of the Rwanda Tribunal and wishes him\r\nwell in his new position. The European Union calls on\r\nthe Presidents and Prosecutors of ICTY and ICTR to\r\ncontinue their cooperation in order to maximize the\r\nefficient use of the intellectual and financial resources\r\nof the two Tribunals.\r\nAny efforts aimed at improving the Tribunal’s\r\nwork and completion of its mandate within the\r\nestablished time frame are bound to bring no results if\r\ncooperation from the States concerned is not\r\nguaranteed. For this purpose, it remains crucial for\r\nICTR to obtain adequate facilities and full cooperation\r\nfrom these States whenever required, with particular\r\nattention to access to military information and to\r\ncollaboration in securing the appearance in Court of\r\nprosecution witnesses. The European Union in\r\nparticular calls on the Rwandan authorities to ensure\r\nthat they facilitate, to the fullest extent possible, the\r\nperformance of the Tribunal’s mandate and the\r\ndetermination of responsibilities for crimes committed in\r\nRwanda in 1994 for which the Tribunal is competent.\r\nWhile recognizing that room for improvement\r\nstill exists and that further measures can be taken either\r\nto remedy perceived problems or to increase further the\r\nefficiency of the Tribunal, the European Union trusts\r\nthat, due to recent innovations in its structure and\r\nworking methods, as well as to the hard work of all its\r\nstaff, the Tribunal will be able to continue to make\r\nsteady and successful progress towards the timely\r\nfulfilment of its mandate.\r\nI turn now to the International Criminal Tribunal\r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia. The European Union has,\r\non a number of occasions, stressed that it attaches the\r\nhighest importance to the principle that there must be\r\nno impunity for those responsible for the most heinous\r\ncrimes. The European Union wishes to take the\r\nopportunity of today’s meeting to reaffirm its strong\r\nbelief in international criminal justice and in the\r\ncontribution that that can bring to the peace and\r\nsecurity of relations among States. The ICTY, through\r\nthe work of its Courts and its outreach activities, has\r\nmade a valuable contribution to reconciliation in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. The European Union therefore once\r\nagain reaffirms its support for the Tribunal and\r\ncommends its entire staff for their efforts to bring\r\njustice to victims of genocide, war crimes and crimes\r\nagainst humanity.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the tenth annual\r\nreport of the Tribunal’s President and praises the\r\ndevelopments and improvements achieved during the\r\npast year. The European Union would also like to take\r\nthis opportunity to welcome the new President of the\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nICTY, Judge Theodor Meron, and to express its\r\nappreciation to the former President, Judge Claude\r\nJorda, now a Judge of the International Criminal Court,\r\nfor the accomplishment of his duties. We wish both of\r\nthem every success in their new endeavours.\r\nIn addition to its recent activity that led to the\r\nsuccessful conclusion of several cases, the Tribunal has\r\npressed forward with plans to improve its efficiency,\r\ninvolving essentially a two-pronged strategy of both\r\ninternal and external reforms. Notably, the European\r\nUnion welcomes the most important internal reform,\r\nremoval of the prohibition on ad litem judges\r\nadjudicating in pre-trial proceedings. In May, the\r\nSecurity Council unanimously adopted its resolution\r\n1481 (2003), amending the Tribunal’s Statute so as to\r\nenhance the powers of ad litem judges in that regard.\r\nThat reform will undoubtedly maximize the Court’s use\r\nof available judicial resources and increase judicial\r\noutput at the pre-trial stage; it will be an important tool\r\nin the finalization of the ICTY’s completion strategy.\r\nThe European Union reiterates that it is important that\r\nthe ICTY make every effort to respect the deadlines of\r\nthe completion strategy: namely, 2004 for the\r\ncompletion of investigations, 2008 for the completion\r\nof trials and 2010 for the completion of appeals.\r\nProsecutorial activities have intensified with a\r\nview to achieving the goals of the completion strategy.\r\nIn that context, as I have already stated, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has concluded that the two Prosecutors’\r\noffices, for the ICTY and for the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), generate too high a\r\nworkload for only one person to deal with. As a result,\r\nthe Security Council — as the Assembly is already\r\naware — has decided that, in order for both Tribunals\r\nto effectively carry out their mandates in the final\r\nphase of their existence, each of them will need one\r\ndedicated Prosecutor. In that context, the European\r\nUnion, as a sign of its highest appreciation for the\r\nexcellent work Prosecutor Del Ponte has carried out,\r\nhas fully endorsed her re-election for a full mandate as\r\nICTY Prosecutor. The European Union calls on the\r\nPresidents and Prosecutors of the ICTY and the ICTR\r\nto continue their cooperation to maximize the efficient\r\nuse of the intellectual and financial resources of the\r\ntwo Tribunals.\r\nRegarding the external component of its\r\ncompletion strategy, the European Union supports the\r\nefforts to establish a special Chamber for war crimes\r\nprosecutions — a “War Crimes Chamber” — in the State\r\nCourt of Bosnia and Herzegovina and welcomes the\r\ncooperation between the ICTY and the Office of the\r\nHigh Representative in that respect. The European\r\nUnion reiterates its appeal to the Tribunal to ensure\r\nthat the necessary standards of fair trial, independence\r\nand full respect for human rights are also respected\r\nwithin trials in national courts and takes note with\r\nappreciation of the activities undertaken to that end,\r\nparticularly the establishment of the Association of\r\nDefence Counsel, in September 2002.\r\nIt has been emphasized many times that the\r\nsuccess of the Tribunal in the discharge of its mandate\r\ndepends largely on full cooperation on the part of\r\nStates and on their willingness to implement its\r\ndecisions and orders. Although the situation has\r\nimproved in a number of aspects, the Tribunal\r\ncontinues to encounter obstacles and resistance. In that\r\nregard, the European Union, recalling the pledge to\r\ncooperate fully and unequivocally with the ICTY, made\r\nby the countries of the region at the European Union-\r\nWestern Balkans Summit, held at Thessaloniki in June\r\n2003, calls upon them to improve their cooperation\r\nwith respect to the arrest and transfer of indictees still\r\nat large, requests for documents, access to archives and\r\nthe ready availability of witnesses. It reiterates the\r\nneed to intensify efforts to transfer Radovan Karadjic,\r\nRatko Mladic and Ante Gotovina to the ICTY for trial.\r\nThe European Union reaffirms that full cooperation\r\nwith the ICTY on the part of the countries of the\r\nWestern Balkans remains an essential element of the\r\nEuropean Union’s Stabilization and Association\r\nProcess. Failure to cooperate fully with the ICTY\r\nwould seriously jeopardize further movement towards\r\nthe European Union.\r\nThe European Union, assuring both Courts of its\r\nfull support, wishes to thank all the branches of the\r\nTribunals — the Chambers, the Registries and the Offices\r\nof the Prosecutors — for their essential contribution to\r\nthe culture of justice and the rule of law.\r\nMr. Lovald (Norway): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing our full recognition of the achievements and\r\nthe high standards of the International Tribunals for\r\nRwanda and the Former Yugoslavia, as reflected in\r\nvarious judgements as well as in the reports before us.\r\nWe should like to thank the Presidents of the Tribunals\r\nfor their detailed annual reports, which in our view\r\naccurately reflect the progress made during the period\r\nunder review.\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nFirst, let me take this opportunity to welcome the\r\nnew Presidents, Judge Theodor Meron and Judge Erik\r\nMøse, and to thank the former Presidents, Judge Jorda\r\nand Judge Pillay — both now judges of the International\r\nCriminal Court — for the accomplishment of their\r\nduties. We wish all of them every success in their new\r\nendeavours. I also congratulate the two Prosecutors:\r\nMs. Carla Del Ponte, on her reappointment, and Mr.\r\nHassan Bubacar Jallow, who began his four-year\r\nmandate as the Prosecutor for the Rwanda Tribunal on\r\n15 September. We assure them of our full confidence,\r\nsupport and cooperation.\r\nWhile the work of the Tribunals has been aimed\r\nprincipally at contributing to peace and security in\r\nRwanda and the former Yugoslavia, they have a\r\nbroader significance as well. The Tribunals represent\r\nhistoric first steps towards ending the tradition of\r\nimpunity for mass atrocities by establishing effective\r\nsystems of international criminal law. The work of the\r\nTribunals has become a widely recognized contribution\r\nto the search for truth and the fight against impunity\r\nfor the most serious crimes of international concern;\r\nthus it can also assist in the process of rebuilding civil\r\nsociety under the rule of law. The judgements delivered\r\nby the Tribunals are essential contributions to\r\njurisprudence in the field of international criminal law.\r\nThe continuing work of the ad hoc Tribunals also paves\r\nthe way for the work of the International Criminal Court.\r\nDuring the period under review, the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) has continued its\r\nefforts to avoid needless consumption of time. The\r\nmeasures implemented by the Tribunal to better\r\nstreamline the conduct of business so that capacity is\r\nutilized to the maximum have yielded tangible results.\r\nBearing in mind the resources required to try the\r\nmost serious international crimes, we are impressed\r\nand encouraged by the fact that the total result of the\r\nTribunal’s second mandate aims at doubling the\r\nnumber of accused who have been tried, compared to\r\nthe first mandate. It is the responsibility of every\r\nMember State to help the Tribunal continue this\r\nprogress.\r\nThe timely completion of the Tribunal’s mandate\r\nis also dependent upon added resources. We are\r\ntherefore very pleased that the Security Council\r\nreached agreement on resolution 1431 (2002) in\r\nAugust, with a view to creating a pool of ad litem\r\njudges. Norway welcomes the successful election of\r\nthe 18 ad litem judges in June 2003, but it regrets the\r\nfact that only four ad litem judges can sit at any one\r\ntime. We have previously stated concerns about certain\r\nfinancial and management issues, mainly related to\r\ndefence counsel and legal aid. We have noted the\r\nTribunal’s efforts to improve the legal aid programme\r\nin order to ensure the efficient use of resources and the\r\nprotection of the integrity of the Tribunals’ judicial\r\nprocess. We look forward to the forthcoming external\r\nconsultant report on fee assessment, which, hopefully,\r\nwill provide recommendations on how to establish a\r\nnew system of payment acceptable to all.\r\nThe pace of activities of the Tribunal for the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia has also reached an all-time high\r\nduring the period under review. Both internal and\r\nexternal reforms have been successfully implemented,\r\nleading to a remarkable increase in its judicial activity,\r\nthanks not in the least to the additional nine ad litem\r\njudges. We warmly welcomed in May the adoption of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1481 (2003), enhancing the\r\npowers of the ad litem judges by naming them to\r\nadjudicate over pre-trial matters. The ad litem judges\r\ncan now make more efficient use of their time and\r\nenhance their already-important contribution to the\r\nwork of the Tribunal, thus helping it to bring cases to\r\ncompletion more expeditiously.\r\nTo a large extent, the success of the Tribunals in\r\nthe discharge of their mandates depends on the support\r\nof Member States. We therefore regret that problems\r\nrelating to international cooperation have continued to be\r\nan obstacle to the Tribunals in the completion of their\r\nmandates. Positive signals from Rwandan authorities in\r\nthat respect are indeed promising. Without bringing the\r\nhighest-ranking indictees to justice, the essential\r\nmission of the Tribunals will remain unfulfilled. We\r\nreiterate the need to intensify efforts to bring Radovan\r\nKaradzic and Ratko Mladic to the ICTY. All States\r\nmust now recognize their non-negotiable duty to\r\ncooperate with the Tribunals, in accordance with the\r\nbinding decisions of the Security Council.\r\nThe Norwegian Government has demonstrated its\r\nwillingness to consider applications from the ICTY\r\nconcerning the enforcement of sentences, and\r\nsubsequently, in conformity with national laws, to\r\nreceive a limited number of convicted persons to serve\r\ntheir sentences in Norway. We encourage other States\r\nto prove their continued commitment to the work of the\r\nTribunals through concrete action in this crucial field.\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nLet me conclude by reiterating our satisfaction\r\nwith the remarkable achievements of the Tribunals\r\nduring the period covered by the present report. We\r\nrecognize, however, the hard work that lies ahead.\r\nMembers must rest assured that we will stand by our\r\nlongstanding commitment to the Tribunals to\r\nsuccessfully complete the mission assigned to them by\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nMr. Drobnjak (Croatia): A decade ago the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\r\n(ICTY) was created with the purpose of restoring and\r\nmaintaining peace in the war-torn areas of the former\r\nYugoslavia by putting an end to grave violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law and bringing to justice\r\nthe persons responsible for them. Moreover, one of the\r\nICTY’s earlier reports elegantly embodies the far-\r\nreaching meaning of the Tribunal’s work when it states\r\nthat the Tribunal performs the role of justice and\r\nmemory. That definition of purpose further underscores\r\nthe need for keeping ICTY activities in line with the\r\nsensibility of States under its jurisdiction for the\r\nbenefit of the historical record that shall be established\r\nthrough the Tribunal’s jurisprudence. That record is\r\nequally important, as is the obligation to serve law and\r\nadminister justice.\r\nAs part of its authority to transcend national\r\nborders in the prosecution of war crimes, while giving\r\nprimacy to individual rights over State sovereignty, the\r\nestablishment of the ICTY was a far-reaching step\r\nforward in expanding the boundaries of international\r\nlaw. The establishment of the Tribunal has sent a\r\npowerful message: nobody is above the law, regardless\r\nof whether one is a high-level official or a simple\r\nsoldier; whether one is a war hero or a ruthless dictator.\r\nThis principle was best exemplified in the indictment\r\nand trial of Slobodan Milosevic, the first head of State to\r\nbe charged for war crimes, crimes against humanity and\r\ngenocide before an international tribunal, and the main\r\nculprit for the war and the destruction and unspeakable\r\nsuffering it brought to the area of the former\r\nYugoslavia during the last decade of the past century.\r\nIn establishing an extensive judicial record in the\r\nuncharted waters of international criminal adjudication,\r\nthe Tribunal, together with the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), continues to contribute to\r\nthe development of humanitarian law, thereby creating\r\na founding legacy for the future work of the newly\r\nestablished International Criminal Court (ICC).\r\nAs much as we praise the ICTY’s importance and\r\naccomplishments, as it continues to carry out its\r\nlaudable mission, we also have to recognize some of its\r\nshortcomings. The Tribunal is above national laws, but\r\nit should not be above well-founded criticism.\r\nAcknowledgement of the Tribunal’s deficiencies is an\r\nessential step towards the perfection of its work.\r\nUtmost efficiency still cannot be easily associated\r\nwith the ICTY, although an important improvement\r\nwas recently achieved. With a growing budget that\r\nexceeds $1 billion per year, it is proving very\r\nexpensive. Its trials are removed from the countries and\r\ncommunities where the war crimes were perpetrated,\r\nthus at times failing to produce a full impact on the\r\nlocal communities. Over the years, moreover, a number\r\nof procedural flaws have had to be corrected through\r\nrepeated interventions regarding rules of procedure.\r\nRegarding the aforesaid, I would like to draw\r\nMembers’ attention to two practical issues. As we\r\nknow, not all the indicted persons before the Tribunal\r\nwere found guilty. Cases of acquittal demonstrate\r\nimpartiality and efficiency of justice. At the same time,\r\nthe denial of an effective mechanism allowing for\r\ncompensation risks the impairment of an important\r\naspect of the acquitted person’s rights. Croatia\r\nbelieves, therefore, that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal\r\nshould be broadened by putting in place the appropriate\r\nprocedure that would enable it to award compensation\r\nto wrongly convicted, prosecuted or detained persons.\r\nAs for the enforcement of sentences, one has to\r\nraise the following question: to what extent does serving a\r\nsentence in States very far from the former Yugoslavia,\r\nsometimes in a very different socio-cultural environment,\r\nappear to be in line with international instruments that\r\nrequire prisoners to be imprisoned reasonably near their\r\nusual place of residence? The existing instruction, dating\r\nfrom 1993, envisaged the enforcement of sentences\r\noutside the area of the former Yugoslavia. Nevertheless,\r\nwe would like to use this opportunity to reiterate our\r\nrequest to the Secretary-General to review the instructions\r\nof his predecessor regarding these arrangements, so as to\r\nallow for the serving of sentences in the countries of the\r\nregion, including Croatia.\r\nCertain interpretations by the Prosecutor of the\r\nhistorical background and political genesis of the\r\nconflict in the area of the former Yugoslavia, as well as\r\nof the character of the consequent military operations,\r\nappears not to be fully in line with the General\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nAssembly resolution on the occupied territories of\r\nCroatia and the spirit of several important Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. The same could be said of some of\r\nthe indictments. It is of the utmost importance not to\r\nsend the wrong message about the primary causes of\r\nthe war carnage during the nineties. Unfortunately,\r\nsome of the indictments are perceived by those who\r\nlived and suffered through the war in the former\r\nYugoslavia as a distortion of reality when it comes to\r\nthe true architects of war crimes in Croatia and Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina.\r\nIn spite of the imperfections of the International\r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), it must\r\nsurely be commended for its work and achievements.\r\nCroatia joins those who salute the ICTY and its tireless\r\nefforts to bring to justice all those responsible for war\r\ncrimes in the area of the former Yugoslavia, regardless\r\nof their national or ethnic background.\r\nIn recent years, the international community’s\r\npreference has shifted towards different types of\r\ninternational criminal tribunals, as in Sierra Leone or\r\nCambodia. This practice should be pursued further.\r\nThese so-called mixed-type tribunals are not only\r\ncloser to grass-roots level communities where the\r\ncrimes were committed, but are also composed\r\npartially of local jurists. However, any form of ad hoc\r\njurisdiction that comes into being only after the\r\noutbreak of crimes is nothing but a palliative. We\r\ntherefore hope that the International Criminal Court\r\n(ICC), as a permanent supranational structure with\r\nprospective and non-selective jurisdiction, will grow\r\ninto a powerful guardian of human rights in times of\r\nconflict, deterring future crimes and obviating the need\r\nfor ad hoc adjudication.\r\nThe ICTY’s completion strategy, formalized by\r\nrecent Security Council resolution 1503 (2003), brings\r\nus a step closer to the efficient and successful\r\nachievement of the Tribunal’s mission. We are\r\nencouraged by the important reforms that the Tribunal\r\nhas undertaken in order to conduct its operations within\r\na precise timetable. Their effect can already be felt in\r\nthe intensified trial activities.\r\nAgainst this background, we also welcome the\r\nseparation of mandates of the Prosecutors of the ICTY\r\nand the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda\r\n(ICTR). This should contribute to the efficiency and\r\neffectiveness of these Tribunals, since two Prosecutors\r\ncan devote undivided attention and energy to the\r\norganization, oversight, management and conduct of the\r\noutstanding investigations and prosecutions. Respecting\r\nthe benchmarks — such as the completion of all\r\ninvestigations by the end of 2004 and coming up with a\r\nfinal number of new indictments by that date — is not\r\nonly a question of the effective administration of\r\njustice, but also not a small contribution to the\r\nprevention of potentially harmful political tensions in\r\nthe countries concerned.\r\nWe are fully aware of the critical importance of\r\nfull cooperation with the ICTY for the successful\r\ncompletion of its tasks. Croatia will continue to offer\r\nunreserved concrete support and provide all the\r\nnecessary assistance requested by the ICTY and the\r\nOffice of the Prosecutor. It will undertake, within its\r\nown borders, all measures required to prosecute\r\nperpetrators of war crimes, insofar as they are within\r\nthe reach of its judicial system.\r\nAs for the outstanding indictment against retired\r\nGeneral Ante Gotovina, who is still at large, the\r\nGovernment keeps the Office of the Prosecutor\r\nregularly updated on the activities it has been\r\nundertaking to discover his whereabouts. Consistent\r\nwith the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the Court,\r\non 6 October this year, the Government of Croatia\r\nsubmitted its third report pursuant to rule 59 of the\r\nCourt, describing the actions undertaken in order to\r\nexecute the warrant of arrest.\r\nWhen it comes to the issue of cooperation\r\nbetween the ICTY and Croatia, I can inform the\r\nAssembly that there are no outstanding problems in\r\ngaining prompt access to specific documents for the\r\npurposes of the ICTY’s proceedings. The recent visit of\r\nthe Special Prosecutor to Croatia confirmed that.\r\nIn regard to the report of the ICTY contained in\r\ndocument A/58/297, we commend the effort invested in\r\nsuch a comprehensive and voluminous report, but we\r\ncan not agree with every single line in this document.\r\nThe Tribunal’s exit strategy has rightly\r\nrecognized the importance of bringing the war crimes\r\ntrials to a local level. In that regard, we welcome the\r\nefforts aimed at assisting national jurisdictions in\r\nimproving their capacity to prosecute cases delegated\r\nto them by the ICTY, further endorsed in Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1503 (2003). In Croatia, a number\r\nof war crimes are being investigated and prosecutions\r\nare being launched. Furthermore, the Government has\r\nintroduced legislation that, while facilitating future\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\ncooperation with the ICC, also strengthens the\r\ncapability of the domestic legal system for prosecuting\r\nwar crimes. Croatia is ready to cooperate closely with\r\nthe ICTY in conducting such trials. Under the existing\r\nlegislation, ICTY representatives are entitled to follow\r\nthe proceedings and have access to court files, while\r\nevidentiary material obtained by the ICTY can be used\r\ndirectly in domestic trials.\r\nA readiness for a broader and more transparent\r\ninternational monitoring of war crimes trials has been\r\nindicated. We are pleased that the report notes this\r\npositive trend in the cooperation between the Office of\r\nthe Prosecutor and the Office of the State Attorney of\r\nCroatia in regard to prosecutions before national courts.\r\nWe feel confident in taking up this demanding task.\r\nMr. ahović (Serbia and Montenegro): Allow me\r\nto extend the appreciation of my delegation to the\r\nPresident of the International Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia (ICTY), Judge Theodor Meron, for the\r\ncomprehensive report on the Tribunal’s work in the\r\npast year and his introductory analysis, which we have\r\njust heard. We have studied the report and its\r\nconclusions with great attention.\r\nI would also like to express our pleasure with\r\nPresident Meron’s recent visit to Serbia and\r\nMontenegro and the fruitful talks my Government had\r\nwith him. We highly appreciate his recognition of the\r\nimproved cooperation of our country with the ICTY. As\r\nour highest officials reiterated during this visit,\r\ncomplying with its international obligation to cooperate\r\nwith the Tribunal is Serbia and Montenegro’s priority.\r\nMy Government emphasizes its support for the\r\ninternal reforms undertaken by the ICTY, designed to\r\nimprove the efficiency of the Trial Chamber’s\r\nproceedings. We take note of the increased number of\r\nsimultaneous trials and the enhanced capacity of the\r\nTribunal to expeditiously process cases. My\r\nGovernment particularly welcomes the report’s\r\nassessment that these reforms are part of efforts to\r\nbring the ICTY’s work to an orderly close, in\r\naccordance with the completion strategy approved by\r\nthe Security Council. We welcome the establishment of\r\na special War Crimes Chamber for prosecutions in the\r\nState Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina as an\r\nencouraging step in that direction.\r\nThe referral of lower-level cases to competent\r\nnational courts constitutes an important part of the\r\ncompletion strategy. My Government believes it is time\r\nfor the Tribunal to start considering the possibility of\r\nreferral of certain cases to other national jurisdictions\r\nin the States of the former Yugoslavia. In that context,\r\nwe are looking forward to cooperation between the\r\nICTY, in particular the Prosecutor’s Office, and the\r\nappropriate judicial bodies in Serbia and Montenegro.\r\nBoth by its willingness to cooperate with the\r\nICTY and to try war crimes cases before its own\r\ncourts, Serbia and Montenegro is seeking to contribute\r\nto the attainment of the completion strategy goals.\r\nBefore our national courts, there are currently seven\r\nwar crimes trials.\r\nIn addition, we are working to develop the\r\ncapacities of local judiciary to deal with complex\r\nproceedings of this nature. We recognize the necessity of\r\ninternational guidance and assistance in this important\r\nfield, which is welcome. Recent legislation has enabled\r\nthe establishment of a special prosecutor’s office for\r\nwar crimes. In accordance with the recommendations\r\nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope, this office will function as an independent\r\nbody, subordinate only to the Assembly of the Republic of\r\nSerbia. The recently adopted law on the organization and\r\ncompetencies of the State authorities in proceedings\r\nagainst the perpetrators of war crimes also provides for\r\nthe establishment of a special court chamber and a\r\nspecial unit within the Serbian Ministry of the Interior\r\nto deal with war crimes cases. I am pleased to say that\r\nduring his visit to Belgrade, Judge Meron welcomed\r\nthe establishment of these judicial bodies.\r\nBefore turning to specific issues of cooperation\r\nbetween my Government and the ICTY, I would like\r\nbriefly to mention one aspect of the Tribunal’s work\r\nwhich is not often highlighted, but which deserves\r\nattention. The outreach programme, designed to\r\nfamiliarize the broad public in the countries of the\r\nformer Yugoslavia with the activities of the Tribunal,\r\nespecially with respect to the Trial Chambers, should, in\r\nour view, continue. For the programme to be effective, it\r\nshould be adapted to various segments of the local\r\npublic, such as the political and legal communities and\r\nthe population at large. In this way, the programme can\r\nalso assist Government authorities in their efforts\r\ntowards further cooperation with the Tribunal.\r\nAs for cooperation between my country and the\r\nICTY, I would like briefly to highlight the following\r\nfacts. First, we have amended the law on cooperation\r\nwith the Tribunal, in accordance with the ICTY\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nstatutes, deleting provisions that originally placed\r\ncertain restrictions on the surrender of persons indicted\r\nby the Tribunal. Therefore, all internal legal obstacles\r\nto full cooperation have been removed.\r\nSecondly, as of 8 August 2002, Serbia and\r\nMontenegro had received 17 arrest warrants from the\r\nICTY. From that date to the present, five of the accused\r\non the list voluntarily surrendered and were transferred\r\nto the Tribunal, including the former President of\r\nSerbia, Slobodan Milosevic. Another three indictees\r\nwere arrested by the authorities of Serbia and\r\nMontenegro and transferred to the ICTY, including the\r\nformer head of the State Security Agency Jovica\r\nStanisic and the last of the so-called Bukovar-three,\r\nVeselin Sljivancanin. In addition, proceedings are\r\ncurrently underway for the transfer of another person\r\nindicted for war crimes in Dubrovnik.\r\nThirdly, as far as access to documentation is\r\nconcerned, Serbia and Montenegro has handed over to\r\nthe ICTY volumes of minutes, verbatim records and\r\nother classified documents from various State\r\ninstitutions and agencies, including the counter-\r\nintelligence service of the Yugoslav army. Altogether,\r\nwe have handed over to the Tribunal more than 7,000\r\nclassified documents since the beginning of 2001.\r\nFourthly, with regard to access to witnesses, I\r\nwould like to point out that no less than 130\r\nindividuals, including three former heads of State, were\r\nreleased of their obligation not to disclose State,\r\nmilitary or official secrets, in order to testify before the\r\nICTY. This process continues.\r\nWe hope that the aforementioned will help place\r\nin the proper context the issue of my country’s\r\ncooperation with the Tribunal.\r\nFinally, we support the Prosecutor’s commitment\r\nto complete the investigations and indictments by the\r\nend of 2004. In this context, Serbia and Montenegro\r\nwelcomes the first indictment against members of the\r\nKosovo Liberation Army for crimes committed in\r\nKosovo and Metohija. We are awaiting with great\r\ninterest the results of other allegedly numerous\r\ninvestigations of crimes committed against members of\r\nminority communities in this province.\r\nFor our part, we are firmly of the view that the\r\nindividual responsibility of all perpetrators of all\r\ncrimes committed during the conflicts in the former\r\nYugoslavia should be established in proceedings both\r\nbefore the ICTY and the national court. My Government\r\nis aware that cooperation with the ICTY is its obligation\r\nand that more still needs to be done in that respect. The\r\ncooperation with the Tribunal is a process my\r\nGovernment will continue, and in doing so, it will\r\nmake all efforts to achieve further improvements.\r\nMr. George (Nigeria): May I take this\r\nopportunity once again to congratulate you on your\r\nwell-deserved election and to reaffirm the support and\r\ncooperation of the Nigerian delegation in your\r\ndetermination to steer the deliberations of the fifty-\r\neighth session towards its successful conclusion.\r\nI would also like to congratulate Judge Eric Møse\r\non his recent appointment as President of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)\r\nand wish him every success in his new duties.\r\nThe Nigerian delegation appreciates the fact that\r\nthe International Tribunals for both Rwanda and the\r\nformer Yugoslavia are engaged in a very crucial\r\nassignment which is of great importance for humanity.\r\nWe also believe that the existence of these Tribunals\r\ntestifies to the collective determination of Member\r\nStates of the United Nations to stem the propagation of\r\ngenocide and crimes against humanity. Indeed, the\r\nlandmark actions by the United Nations to establish\r\nthese Tribunals has gone a long way in restoring human\r\ndignity and respect for fundamental human rights, as\r\nwell as the rule of law.\r\nIt is pertinent to mention also that these Tribunals\r\nhave helped enforce, through national reconciliation,\r\nstability and peace in the countries concerned through\r\nthe administration of justice. Furthermore, the ad hoc\r\nTribunals have made notable contributions to the\r\ndevelopment of international criminal justice. Most of\r\nall, the ICTR, through its work, has made and\r\ncontinues to make substantial contributions to the\r\nreplacement of a culture of impunity with values of\r\naccountability. Indeed, the decisions of the ICTR, for\r\nexample, are already creating a substantial body of\r\ncase law which is already being used by the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\r\n(ICTY), and by State courts worldwide.\r\nThere is no doubt that the ensuing developments\r\nin international criminal justice will provide a solid\r\nfoundation for the International Criminal Court (ICC),\r\nwhich has now become a functional judicial institution.\r\nIn point of fact, the pioneering work of the Registrar of\r\nthe ICTR in the area of restitutive justice has found a\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\npride of place in the provisions of the Rome Statute of\r\nthe ICC. It is against this backdrop that the Nigerian\r\ndelegation has expressed keen interest in evaluating the\r\ncurrent reports of the ICTR and the ICTY.\r\nIt is heartening to note that in spite of daunting\r\nchallenges, such as inadequate infrastructure, complexity\r\nof cases, the need for voluminous disclosures and\r\ntranslation of documents, transport of witnesses from\r\nall parts of the world and unavailability of witnesses, to\r\nmention but a few, the ICTR was able to handle a total\r\nof nine trials during its second mandate, involving 14\r\naccused, which is twice the number of accused who\r\nhave been tried under the first mandate, between 1995\r\nand 1999. It is significant, therefore, to note that the\r\nTribunal will have rendered 15 judgments involving 21\r\naccused persons by the end of this year.\r\nThe Nigerian delegation commends the Tribunal\r\nfor delivering two appeal judgments on the merits, six\r\ninterlocutory appeal decisions and 19 other decisions\r\nand orders during the period under review.\r\nThe Nigerian delegation, however, notes its\r\nconcern with the relatively slow pace of trials of the\r\nICTR, as compared to tribunals conducted at the\r\nnational level. Although this problem has been\r\nparticularly ascribed to various factors, some of which\r\nhave already been highlighted, there is need to look\r\ninto an important aspect of the recent reform of the\r\nICTR concerning the creation of a pool of 18 ad litem\r\njudges, which is aimed at increasing the Tribunal’s\r\njudicial capacity.\r\nThe proposal for the reform appears to have been\r\ndefeated as the relevant Security Council resolution for\r\nthe ICTR only allows the use of four ad litem judges at\r\none time. There is no doubt that the reform of the ICTR\r\nis primarily aimed at expediting the trials of the\r\naccused persons and at avoiding the negation of the\r\naxiom that justice delayed is justice denied. It is\r\nimperative that this low number of ad litem judges to be\r\nused at any one time should be reconsidered. The ICTR’s\r\nreport under consideration clearly affirms that the\r\nprovision of four ad litem judges at any one time makes\r\nthe division into sections difficult. This is all the more\r\nreason why we believe that reconsideration is necessary.\r\nIn order to ensure the early completion of the ICTR\r\nmandate, the Nigerian delegation recommends that the\r\nICTR ad litem judges should be increased to the same\r\nlevel as that of the ICTY, which was given the\r\nopportunity to use nine ad litem judges at any one time.\r\nThe ICTR needs the full support of the United\r\nNations to carry on with the incredible work that it is\r\ndoing. The Rwanda Tribunal’s present witness\r\nprogramme needs to be further strengthened to ensure\r\nadequate protective measures so that witness, whether\r\nfor the prosecution or the defence, can testify incognito\r\nand be protected from the risk of reprisals.\r\nWe commend the Registrar’s untiring efforts and\r\ninitiatives to promote better knowledge and awareness\r\nat various strata of civil society, particularly about the\r\nwork of the ICTR, especially in Rwanda and the Great\r\nLakes region. The current effort by the Registrar to\r\nseek greater support for the reconciliation process in\r\nRwanda and the establishment of a special fund for the\r\nvictims of genocide in Rwanda is also a step in the\r\nright direction.\r\nThe Nigerian delegation notes with satisfaction\r\nthe assumption of office by the newly-appointed\r\nprosecutor for the ICTR, Mr. Hassan Bubacar Jallow\r\nfrom The Gambia, who took up his new mandate at the\r\nheadquarters of the Tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania, on 3\r\nOctober 2003. We believe that the appointment of a\r\nnew Prosecutor will mitigate some of the existing\r\ninstitutional problems of the ICTR and enhance the\r\nTribunal’s standards of professionalism and\r\nimpartiality. I also believe that the Prosecutor will\r\nbring his professional skills and wealth of experience\r\nto bear on his duties and provide the required\r\nleadership and guidance to move the Tribunal forward\r\nby developing a clear and comprehensive strategy\r\ntowards the attainment of the ICTR’s mandate.\r\nAs regards the International Tribunal for the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia (ICTY), my delegation commends\r\nthe efforts that have been made so far to carry out both\r\ninternal and external reforms, primarily designed to\r\nimprove the Tribunal’s efficiency of proceedings,\r\nincluding the expansion of the duties of ad litem\r\njudges. In that regard, my delegation specifically\r\ncommends the Tribunal for the external component of its\r\ncompletion strategy by reaching an agreement with the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Representative for\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina concerning the establishment of\r\na special chamber for war crimes prosecutions in the\r\nState Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We believe\r\nthat this is a constructive initiative that will enable the\r\nTribunal to begin transferring some cases of mid- and\r\nlower-level accused to the special chamber for war\r\ncrimes prosecutors in the State Court of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina during 2004 or early 2005.\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nIn conclusion, the Tribunals need the sustained\r\nsupport of the international community for the\r\nachievement of their objectives. The existence of these\r\nTribunals is undoubtedly a reflection of the\r\ncommitment of the international community to the\r\nprinciples of the rule of law, a sine qua non for\r\nbuilding a just society. Nigeria reiterates its continued\r\nsupport for the work of the ICTR and ICTY as part of\r\nthe collective will to ensure that the Tribunals are able\r\nto discharge their responsibilities credibly.\r\nMr. Gahima (Rwanda): Allow me to thank you,\r\nSir, for the opportunity accorded to my delegation to\r\nparticipate in this important debate.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to thank\r\nthe President of the International Criminal Tribunal for\r\nRwanda (ICTR) for his report and to assure him and his\r\ncollaborators of my Government’s continued support\r\nfor their work.\r\nAllow me also to take this opportunity to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General and the Security Council for the\r\nrecent decision to appoint a separate Prosecutor for the\r\nICTR, a change in the structure of the Tribunal that my\r\nGovernment had long advocated. We believe that this\r\nchange will go a long way towards addressing some of\r\nthe concerns that my Government has raised about the\r\nwork of the Tribunal in the past.\r\nThe Government of Rwanda is committed to\r\nseeking justice for the victims of the 1994 genocide,\r\nparticularly as far as the senior Government, military\r\nand civil society leaders who planned and oversaw the\r\nRwanda genocide are concerned. Promoting the rule of\r\nlaw, in general, and accountability, in particular, for the\r\ngenocide and other violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law that occurred in Rwanda between\r\n1990 and 1994, has been one of the pillars of the\r\nprogramme of the transitional Government of national\r\nunity. Consequently, we attach very great importance\r\nindeed to the work of the ICTR.\r\nTo assist the ICTR in achieving its mandate, the\r\nGovernment of Rwanda has put in place mechanisms to\r\nfacilitate its work. We have provided assistance and\r\nhospitality to ICTR personnel in Rwanda for the last\r\nnine years. All judicial, law enforcement, central\r\nGovernment and local government organs in Rwanda\r\nhave standing instructions to assist ICTR personnel in\r\ntheir work in our country.\r\nWe provide access to vital witnesses, undertake\r\ninvestigations for the Office of the Prosecutor\r\nwhenever we are requested to do so, make available\r\nevidence in our possession relating to cases in which\r\nthe ICTR is interested to its trial attorneys and\r\ninvestigators, facilitate the travel of witnesses to testify\r\nbefore the ICTR and continue to actively assist and\r\ncooperate with the Tribunal in locating fugitive\r\ngenocide suspects, with a view to their apprehension.\r\nWe regret, however, that the invaluable assistance\r\nwhich Government institutions and private citizens of\r\nRwanda have provided and continued to provide to the\r\nICTR, at considerable sacrifice and expense, often goes\r\nunacknowledged and unappreciated.\r\nAs the ICTR focuses on its completion strategy, it\r\nshould be recognized that the people of Rwanda are\r\nstakeholders in the Tribunal’s work, with a legitimate\r\nright to express views on aspects of the Tribunal’s\r\nperformance that could be improved. Not only are we part\r\nof the international community, we are also the victims\r\nfor whom the Tribunal was established to bring justice.\r\nThe following are some of the areas in respect of\r\nwhich the Tribunal’s performance has had\r\nshortcomings, and which require attention. The\r\nTribunal, to date, is remote and alienated from\r\nRwandan society and has failed to have any significant\r\nimpact on it, as was envisaged by Security Council\r\nresolution 955 (1994), which established the Tribunal.\r\nThe Tribunal’s management organs have often worked\r\nas unrelated institutions, lacking cohesion instead of\r\nbeing complementary organs of the same institution\r\nworking in close collaboration.\r\nFurthermore, the Office of the Prosecutor has\r\nover the years failed to develop a realistic and\r\ncomprehensive prosecution strategy. The Tribunal has\r\nfailed to develop a credible and effective witness\r\nprotection programme and has neglected to address\r\nother pertinent concerns and needs of victims and\r\nwitnesses. The Tribunal has hired perpetrators of\r\ngenocide and close relatives and friends of suspects as\r\ndefence investigators and legal assistants, who then in\r\nturn threaten genocide survivors who are prosecution\r\nwitnesses. There are fee-splitting arrangements between\r\ngenocide suspects in detention and defence lawyers and\r\ninvestigators, with the result being that financial\r\ncontributions made by the international community to\r\nbring to justice the perpetrators of genocide are used\r\ninstead to enrich the criminals and their families and\r\nfriends, and to fuel conflict in our region.\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nAlso, the Office of the Prosecutor has failed to\r\nindict and apprehend large numbers of prominent\r\ngenocide suspects, who are still at large in many\r\ncountries, and it has also failed to develop a realistic\r\nand credible completion strategy.\r\nBy and large, the perception in Rwanda is that, in\r\nview of the vast resources at its disposal, the ICTR has\r\nbeen slow, inefficient and ineffective.\r\nWe would like to recognize that there has been\r\nsome progress in addressing some of the concerns\r\nwhich the Government and the people of Rwanda have\r\nhad with regard to the performance of the ICTR. I\r\nwould in this regard like to cite the following\r\nexamples: the appointment of a separate prosecutor for\r\nthe ICTR; the appointment of the ad litem judges; and\r\nthe initiatives taken by the new President of the\r\nTribunal to expedite the pace of the trials and to\r\npromote the effective functioning of the Tribunal, as\r\nJudge Møse indicated this morning.\r\nRwanda, much like the rest of the international\r\ncommunity, hopes and believes that the new leadership\r\nof the Tribunal offers a window of opportunity for\r\naddressing the problems that have plagued the Tribunal\r\nin the past, and sets the institution on a course that will\r\nenable it to leave a legacy of which we can all be justly\r\nproud in the years to come.\r\nMy Government reiterates its sincere\r\ndetermination to continue to render its full support to\r\nthe ICTR to enable it to fulfil its mandate. We also call\r\nupon all relevant organs of the United Nations,\r\nincluding the General Assembly, to continue to explore\r\nways of making the ICTR more efficient and effective,\r\nand we take this opportunity to make the following\r\nrecommendations for consideration by the Assembly.\r\nWith regard to the completion strategy, we\r\nrecommend that there should be greater consultation\r\nbetween all stakeholders concerned than has hitherto\r\nbeen possible on the proposed strategy. We recommend\r\nthat the completion strategy urgently address the\r\nproblem of the large numbers of genocide suspects\r\nwhom the Office of the Prosecutor has not indicted and\r\nwho are still at large in many countries across the\r\nworld. We recommend also that the completion\r\nstrategy address the financial implications of the\r\ntransfer of more than 30 cases to Rwanda and make\r\nprovisions as to how the financial resources required to\r\nassist Rwanda to deal with those cases will be raised.\r\nOn the problem of the remoteness and alienation\r\nof the Tribunal from Rwandan society, we recommend\r\nthat the Tribunal undertake a credible and substantial\r\noutreach programme to bridge the gap between it and\r\nRwandan society. We are of the view that the ICTR\r\ncould have useful lessons to learn from the experience\r\nof the Sierra Leone Tribunal in this regard. We would\r\nalso once again recommend that hearings of at least\r\nsome of the cases being heard by the Tribunal be\r\nconducted in Rwanda.\r\nAs regards the Tribunal’s relationship with\r\nsurvivors, we urge the ICTR to resolve its outstanding\r\nmisunderstandings with the survivors of the genocide\r\nthrough dialogue with their chosen representatives.\r\nAs regards the hiring of persons suspected of\r\nhaving participated in genocide, we recommend that\r\nthe Government of Rwanda and the ICTR agree on\r\nmechanisms for vetting prospective employees in order\r\nto ensure that persons responsible for genocide are not\r\nemployed by the Tribunal. We recommend also the\r\nappointment of an independent commission to investigate\r\nand make an urgent report on the presence of persons\r\namong the personnel of the ICTR suspected of having\r\ncommitted genocide, and on proposed measures to be\r\ntaken to ensure that the perpetrators of the genocide and\r\ntheir relatives and friends do not continue to be unjustly\r\nenriched by money which the international community\r\npays to ensure that they are instead brought to justice.\r\nAs regards the treatment and protection of\r\nwitnesses, we call upon the ICTR to provide adequate\r\ncounselling and preparation to prosecution witnesses\r\nprior to their appearance before the ICTR. We call also for\r\nthe establishment of an effective witness programme that\r\nis agreed between the ICTR and the Government.\r\nRegarding mismanagement of the Tribunal in\r\ngeneral, we urge greater collaboration between various\r\norgans of the ICTR, so that they act as complementary\r\norgans of one institution instead of perceiving\r\nthemselves as separate, autonomous and competing\r\norgans. We also call upon the organs concerned to end\r\nrecruitment practices based on factors other than merit,\r\nwhich have in the past had an adverse effect on the\r\ncompetence of personnel.\r\nFinally, regarding the relationship between the\r\nICTR and the Government of Rwanda, we recommend\r\nthat, as far as addressing shortcomings in the investigation\r\nand prosecution of cases being handled by the ICTR,\r\nthere ought to be closer collaboration between ICTR\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\npersonnel with Rwandan prosecution and investigation\r\nauthorities to ensure better preparation of cases.\r\nWe recommend that greater use be made of\r\nRwandan professionals within the ICTR during the\r\nremaining years of its mandate, because they are more\r\nfamiliar with the facts and circumstances of the\r\ngenocide, and their experience would be beneficial as\r\nthe domestic courts of Rwanda begin to assume\r\nresponsibility for the cases which will be transferred\r\nfrom the ICTR to our domestic courts.\r\nFinally, we urge the implementation of previous\r\nrecommendations and agreements to institutionalize a\r\nsystem of liaison officers between the ICTR and the\r\nGovernment to facilitate collaboration and cooperation.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express my\r\nGovernment’s appreciation to the General Assembly,\r\nthe Security Council and the Secretary-General for\r\ntheir continuing interest in and support to the ICTR.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda items 53 and 54?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda items 60 and 10 (continued)\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/323)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/58/1)\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members\r\nthat, in a letter dated 8 October 2003 addressed to the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Spain to the United Nations, in his\r\ncapacity as Chairman of the Group of Western European\r\nand Other States for the month of October, requests that\r\nthe General Assembly hear in plenary meeting a statement\r\nby the Observer of the Holy See in the debate on agenda\r\nitem 60, “Follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium\r\nSummit”, and agenda item 10, “Report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization”.\r\nMay I take it that there is no objection to the\r\nproposal to hear a statement by the Observer of the\r\nHoly See in the debate on agenda items 10 and 60?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Limon (Suriname): I would like first of all to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive\r\nreports on the follow-up to the outcome of the\r\nMillennium Summit and on the work of the\r\nOrganization. We welcome the initiative by the\r\nSecretary-General to establish a high-level panel of\r\neminent personalities to examine major global\r\nchallenges, such as peace and security, as well as\r\nUnited Nations reform.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity is one of the pillars upon which the United\r\nNations was established. Recent developments have\r\nbrought to our attention both old and new threats to\r\ninternational security. In addition to traditional threats\r\nto security, in response to which borders and people are\r\nsecured from external attack, we are now faced with\r\nother threats to international security that affect\r\ncontemporary international relations. These include\r\ntransnational organized crime, the spread of infectious\r\ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS and Severe Acute\r\nRespiratory Syndrome, environmental pollution and\r\neconomic crises, all of which could eventually lead to\r\nsocial and political instability. In order to achieve a\r\ncommon security agenda, it is essential that the\r\ninternational community first reach agreement on the\r\nmain threats to international peace and security, both\r\nold and new, and on ways to collectively deal with\r\nthose threats.\r\nOne of the long-pursued objectives of the United\r\nNations is the elimination of all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction from the world. There is growing concern\r\namong the members of the international community\r\nand within the United Nations that non-State actors\r\ncould acquire and utilize such weapons. The\r\nmultilateral instruments and means that currently exist\r\nto deal with threats of weapons of mass destruction\r\nfocus only on threats posed by States, not on those\r\nposed by non-State actors, and have no specific\r\npenalties for non-compliance. My Government agrees\r\nwith the Secretary-General that these are crucial\r\nweaknesses that should be addressed.\r\nActs of terrorism are a grave danger to\r\ninternational peace and security and represent a serious\r\nviolation of fundamental human rights. The growing\r\ninterdependence in the world has the disadvantage in\r\nthat it could facilitate terrorist activities all over the\r\nglobe. Terrorism should therefore be dealt with by\r\ncollective means. The fight against terrorism, to which\r\nSuriname is fully committed, must at all times respect\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\ninternational law, human rights and the principles of\r\ntolerance and peaceful coexistence.\r\nThe transport of nuclear waste through the\r\nCaribbean Sea is an issue of grave concern to the\r\nCaribbean region — especially in the light of the\r\nincrease in terrorist activities throughout the world —\r\ngiven the potential danger that it poses.\r\nOne of the basic human rights of each human\r\nbeing is the right to development, which needs to be\r\nhuman-centred and sustainable. Global poverty is still\r\none of the most difficult challenges facing the\r\ninternational community. Achieving the Millennium\r\nGoals by 2015 will, indeed, require greater national\r\nand international efforts. The implementation of the\r\nGoals should be further promoted, and both developing\r\nand industrialized nations should abide by their\r\ncommitments in this respect.\r\nIt has been determined that the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic is the deadliest in human history and that it\r\nis having a devastating social and economic impact.\r\nThe fact that the Caribbean region has the second\r\nhighest percentage of HIV-infected people is alarming.\r\nMy Government is therefore committed to stopping and\r\nreversing the spread of HIV/AIDS, as well as of\r\nmalaria and other diseases. In this regard, a national\r\nstrategic plan on HIV/AIDS for the period 2004-2008\r\nis being developed.\r\nIndustrialized countries must live up to their\r\ncommitments regarding official development assistance\r\nand work towards a regime of fair trade with\r\ndeveloping countries. The multilateral trading system\r\nneeds to be improved. Developing countries need to be\r\nincluded to a greater extent in the decision-making\r\nprocess of the main international organizations.\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the major United\r\nNations conferences, especially those on sustainable\r\ndevelopment and financing for development, is\r\nnecessary. In our overall efforts to reach the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, we must tackle\r\ncrucial environmental challenges such as climate\r\nchange and biodiversity protection, and we should all\r\nlive up to our commitment regarding the responsible\r\nand equitable management of the Earth’s resources, as\r\nset out in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.\r\nEducation for all, gender equality and bridging\r\nthe digital divide are issues that also require attention if\r\nsufficient development is to be achieved. The\r\ninternational community should make a serious effort\r\nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals and thus\r\ncreate better living conditions for all of the world’s\r\npeople.\r\nWe are currently going through a trying time in\r\ninternational relations. One of the major challenges in\r\nthis respect is the threat to multilateralism. This calls\r\nfor the international community urgently to\r\nacknowledge its responsibility for taking a collective\r\napproach towards resolving global problems and\r\nreviewing the functioning and structure of key\r\nmultilateral institutions like the United Nations.\r\nSuriname supports the efforts to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations through reform. The reform of the\r\nSecurity Council should ensure that that body becomes\r\na more democratic and representative organ and thus\r\nreflects contemporary geopolitical realities. The most\r\nchallenging task will be to find the right solution for\r\nSecurity Council reform — a solution that enables it to\r\neffectively deal with matters of international peace and\r\nsecurity in the context of the current world order.\r\nWe also supports reform proposals with regard to\r\nstrengthening the General Assembly, such as\r\nstreamlining its agenda, improving its decision-making\r\nprocess, strengthening the role of soft-law instruments,\r\nsuch as resolutions and declarations, and enhancing the\r\nCouncil’s relations with the rest of the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate my\r\nGovernment’s commitment to work with the rest of the\r\ninternational community towards a more peaceful,\r\nhumane, equitable and just world.\r\nMr. Alcalay (Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nwould like first of all to express appreciation to you,\r\nMr. President, for having designed the programme of\r\nwork related to items allocated for discussion in\r\nplenary meetings in such a way as to ensure a\r\ncomprehensive overview of the issues with which we\r\nare concerned. This is particularly true as we address\r\nthese two items that we now have before us, because of\r\nthe close interrelationship of the two reports of the\r\nSecretary-General, as shown in the complementarity of\r\nthe accounts of the advances made in implementing the\r\nMillennium Goals.\r\nA significant number of delegations in the\r\ngeneral debate endorsed the proposal to strengthen this\r\nworld political forum. The General Assembly is the\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nonly forum that the international community has to\r\nreview and consider issues, topics and questions relating\r\nto peace and international security.\r\nThis convergence of views should be the\r\nbeginning of something momentous. We are seeing the\r\ninternational community urging the preservation of a\r\ncollective approach to the issues and challenges facing\r\nthe United Nations, by means of multilateralism. All of\r\nthis requires that this Organization, also affected by the\r\nprocess of globalization, adapt to changes and keep in\r\nstep with new international demands.\r\nThe United Nations should be the centre for\r\ndecision-making to tackle the challenges and threats\r\nthat face humankind. The buttressing of the system of\r\ncollective security and a multilateral approach to issues\r\nof concern and interest to the international community\r\nmust be the foundation for our renovation of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his annual report, sets\r\nforth very clearly the challenges lying ahead of the\r\nUnited Nations and has given us an account of what the\r\nOrganization is doing in the areas of peace and security,\r\nsocial and economic development, humanitarian\r\nassistance, international law and human rights, and the\r\nprotection and preservation of the environment, among\r\nother priority issues.\r\nThe points he makes make it clear once again that\r\nthere is a need to conserve a multifaceted approach\r\nwhich will make it possible for each and every Member\r\nState to make its contribution, to share its experience, or\r\npresent a viewpoint in order to make the decision-making\r\nprocess on these important issues a participatory one.\r\nIn our view, our decisions should be grounded in\r\nthe ideals of social justice, freedom, peace, economic\r\nprogress, democracy and independence, and should be\r\ndesigned to build a balanced international climate in\r\nwhich justice will prevail in an environment of\r\nsolidarity that will promote the security and stability\r\nthat are vital for human progress.\r\nDespite the difficulties involved in achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals and the scant progress\r\nreflected in the report of the Secretary-General, those\r\nGoals are still, without question, the relevant agenda of\r\nthis Organization. The Millennium Development Goals\r\nencompass a broad range of challenges and problems\r\nthat are not conventional in nature, and that affect\r\ninternational peace and security. In our view, the\r\nprogress that will be made in achieving these Goals\r\nwill, to a large extent, depend on the progress achieved\r\nin reducing poverty and deprivation and eliminating\r\nsocial exclusion.\r\nPrevention of armed conflict is an area in which\r\nthe Organization has significant potential in terms of\r\nits future work. General Assembly resolution 57/337\r\nwas an excellent contribution by Member States in\r\nterms of addressing this task. The Assembly should\r\ncontinue to work on and develop that resolution\r\nbecause of its importance and predictable effects, and\r\nthat issue should hold a high place in our follow-up to\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\r\nWithout disregarding the need to continue to\r\nintensify action to combat the emergence of new\r\nthreats to international peace and security, such as\r\ninternational terrorism and international organized\r\ncrime, it is vital for the Organization to allocate the\r\nnecessary resources to promote and respond to the\r\ngreat needs of development and of poverty eradication\r\nthrough the development of peoples.\r\nThe progress made towards these Goals will be a\r\nkey factor in the creation of more just societies and\r\nmore robust and stable democracies, while at the same\r\ntime we can also eliminate the dangers, referred to\r\nearlier, of threats to international peace and security.\r\nFor this reason it is essential to bolster the support and\r\nassistance mechanisms for developing countries and to\r\noffer them fresh and innovative tools that will make it\r\npossible for them to achieve the goal of economic and\r\nsocial well-being for their peoples.\r\nIn light of this, we are convinced that the\r\nestablishment of an international humanitarian fund, as\r\nproposed by our country as a tool which will help\r\ncombat the social emergency facing humankind,\r\ncontinues to be a valid proposal and we will continue\r\nputting it forward in future negotiations.\r\nVenezuela attaches great importance to achieving\r\nthe Millennium Declaration Goals. In this regard, we\r\nare particularly eager to see specific formulas, methods\r\nand plans adopted that will allow for follow-up and\r\nevaluation of the Goals, because the progress made in\r\ncombating poverty and social inequities will be\r\nessential in achieving our country’s development goals.\r\nThis process needs to be viewed as a multidimensional\r\nexercise including targets in the areas of health,\r\neducation, productivity, care for the environment,\r\nrespect for human rights and the promotion of cultural\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nvalues and cultural diversity, as fundamental elements\r\nof the social agenda. This is the challenge that my\r\nGovernment has undertaken in pursuing these Goals.\r\nVenezuela believes there is a need to draw up specific\r\nplans of action that will boost our ability to achieve the\r\ngoals of our social agenda.\r\nThe social and economic agenda should be given\r\nthe same degree of priority as the political one, so that\r\nthe problems involved can be looked at as a set, and\r\nfrom the standpoint of solidarity, with emphasis placed\r\non international cooperation to work to create a more\r\nsecure and fairer world, one to which we all aspire and\r\nwhich would be free of many of the conditions in\r\nwhich terrorism and armed conflict can germinate,\r\ngrowing into wars and armed conflict whose scope can\r\nbecome international.\r\nThe United Nations needs to step up its efforts to\r\naid and assist developing countries, while at the same\r\ntime accommodating the specific needs of middle\r\nincome countries, as well as, in particular, the needs of\r\nthe least developed countries, which deserve primary\r\nattention. To this end, we need to establish mechanisms\r\nand special modalities which make it possible for them\r\nto receive the necessary resources and cooperation.\r\nA key step towards achieving these objectives\r\nwill be the firm commitment on the part of all of us to\r\nshift towards a more human development model,\r\ngrounded in new ethical values governed by social\r\njustice. In this regard, we should revise the concept of\r\ninternational security, a concept which would need to\r\nbe defined from the perspective of the human\r\nindividual. This has been very much the concern of the\r\nUnited Nations in developing universal norms and\r\nstandards to protect the rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms of the individual. But when we consider and\r\nanalyse the effective enjoyment of these rights on the\r\nworldwide level, we see that the results are still\r\nminimal. The task appears gigantic when you look at\r\nthe figures we receive daily and see how those\r\nexcluded from the enjoyment of these rights continue\r\nto suffer the greatest hardship.\r\nAt the present time, Venezuela is hosting a high-\r\nlevel conference on poverty, equality and social\r\ninclusion, in conjunction with the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, to consider ways and means of\r\neradicating poverty, in particular critical poverty, as a\r\npre-condition to build and enhance democracy.\r\nAs the Assembly can appreciate, the topic of\r\ncombating poverty is an issue of high priority for Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, and we are certain that the\r\nconclusions that will be reached in the next few days\r\nwill also make it possible for us to contribute to the\r\nefforts of the United Nations towards that end.\r\nFrom that standpoint, it is very important to begin\r\nthe process of the implementation of the Monterrey and\r\nJohannesburg declarations, together with that of the\r\noutcomes of the other major United Nations\r\nconferences that have been held recently in the\r\neconomic and social fields. We must establish the\r\nappropriate guidelines so as to achieve all the\r\nimperatives of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe inclusion in the High-level Dialogue of\r\nfinancial institutions such as those of Bretton Woods\r\nand the increasing partnership among non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and the private sector will\r\nundoubtedly help us achieve those Goals.\r\nAt the international level, there is a very clear\r\nsense that we should take advantage of this opportunity\r\nto update our Organization, adapting it to the\r\nchallenges that it faces and to the scale of the job that it\r\nneeds to do. We must pool our efforts in order to chart\r\nthe new course that the Organization, after a half-\r\ncentury of existence, must embark upon — efforts\r\nwhich must be further enhanced and fine-tuned.\r\nWe need to do our utmost to focus our endeavours\r\nand our attention on areas that have the greatest impact\r\non international life, without losing sight of the need to\r\nensure that this serves to benefit each and every\r\nindividual and all peoples of the world.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to express our\r\nconfidence in the Secretary-General’s proposal to set\r\nup a panel of eminent persons to report on the need for\r\nrestructuring the principal organs of the United Nations.\r\nThe recommendations that they will be making in this\r\nregard will undoubtedly be extremely useful.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to state my\r\ndelegation’s readiness to cooperate at all times with\r\nsuch panel and in connection with the other proposals\r\nthat have been made, so as to ensure that we make an\r\neffective contribution to make the United Nations a\r\nrenewed and forward-looking Organization.\r\nMr. Sow (Guinea) (spoke in French): Allow me\r\nto say, Sir, how deeply my delegation appreciates the\r\nskill, talent and devotion that you have been\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\ndemonstrating in managing and guiding our Assembly.\r\nI should like also to congratulate the Secretary-General\r\non the high quality of his reports on the work of the\r\nOrganization and on the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, as well as on the importance\r\nand relevance of his recommendations and conclusions.\r\nBefore I turn to the consideration of some points\r\nto which my country attaches major importance, I\r\nshould like to say that we endorse the statement made\r\nby the representative of Morocco on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nAn assessment of the work done by the United\r\nNations over the past 12 months shows that problems\r\nrelated to peace and security, development, human\r\nrights, democracy and good governance remain priority\r\nconcerns for the international community. The grim\r\nsuccession of terrorist attacks we have witnessed\r\nrecently, culminating in the disastrous attack of 19\r\nAugust last against the United Nations, brought to light\r\nthe complexity of the challenges facing humankind at\r\nthe national, regional and international levels. By\r\nattacking, with such unprecedented violence, United\r\nNations headquarters in Baghdad, the perpetrators of\r\ninternational terrorism sought to attack the principles,\r\nuniversal values and purposes enshrined in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations and to call into question the\r\ncredibility and legitimacy of its mission — working for\r\npeace, stability and development.\r\nIn that context, the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral rightly describes that tragedy as a direct\r\nchallenge to the vision of global solidarity and\r\ncollective security rooted in the Charter of the United\r\nNations and articulated in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nThe rapid globalization of local or regional crises\r\nis a challenge to the political will and the sense of\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations and of its principal\r\norgans. Our Organization needs to heighten its resolve\r\nto continue its fight against international terrorism and\r\nto find a peaceful and lasting political settlement to the\r\nmany conflicts that beset the world, particularly in the\r\nMiddle East and in Africa.\r\nThe United Nations must continue to help the Iraqi\r\npeople to rebuild their country and to support ongoing\r\nefforts for the restoration of their full sovereignty. In\r\nthe Middle East, initiatives must be taken to relaunch\r\nthe peace process. All parties must be urged to exercise\r\nmaximum restraint and to abide by agreements that\r\nhave been signed, as well as the relevant provisions of\r\nSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions, in\r\norder to provide a negotiated solution to the crisis.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the intensive efforts of\r\nthe United Nations in the area of conflict prevention,\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building in Africa and in the\r\nrest of the world. The examples of Côte d’Ivoire, Sierra\r\nLeone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and,\r\nquite recently, of Liberia show how very successful our\r\nOrganization can be in deploying, sometimes in\r\nemergency conditions, of increasingly complex peace\r\noperations involving multiple partners in the field.\r\nThe challenges to peace and security have a\r\nglobal dimension. They require collective responses based\r\non the international legitimacy of the United Nations. It\r\nis time for the Assembly to take a close look at the\r\narchitecture of international institutions and to seek to\r\nadapt their structure and functions to current needs.\r\nIn this respect, we support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s unrelenting efforts to revitalize and reform\r\nthe United Nations. Our Assembly should, inter alia,\r\nsupport the activities of the high-level panel that he has\r\nmandated to consider ways to strengthen the United\r\nNations through a reform of its institutions. My\r\ncountry has a priority interest in this reform and will\r\ncontribute to its consideration by Member States.\r\nMy country is convinced that, at this critical stage\r\nin world affairs, the principal organs of the United\r\nNations — the Security Council, the General Assembly\r\nand the Economic and Social Council — must be\r\nstrengthened, so that they can better live up to the\r\nexpectations of the developing world and to ensure a\r\nmore equitable allocation of the benefits of\r\nglobalization.\r\nFor Africa, translating the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals into reality is the best hope for\r\nputting an end to poverty and to nip in the bud the\r\nmany causes of conflict and instability. The\r\ncommitments undertaken in the framework of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) by the\r\nAfricans themselves, with the support of their\r\ndevelopment partners, are of crucial importance.\r\nNEPAD is a unique opportunity for Africa, and we are\r\npleased to see our Organization participating fully in\r\nthis dynamic movement. We also need to consider the\r\nprogress made in establishing the new world\r\npartnership on which NEPAD must base its\r\ndevelopment, for unless the international community\r\nmobilizes right now to give the necessary resources to\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nAfrica, the continent runs the serious risk of not\r\nattaining the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nMy delegation notes with regret that negotiations\r\non the key elements of the Doha Development Round\r\nwere not fruitful at the recent Ministerial Conference of\r\nthe World Trade Organization, held in Cancún. We urge\r\nour partners to respond positively to the proposals of\r\nthe developing countries concerning areas of crucial\r\nimportance for peace, stability and progress throughout\r\nthe world.\r\nIn conclusion, we encourage the United Nations\r\nto continue to work for a more equitable world order,\r\none conducive to the attainment of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nMr. Kilo-Abi (Democratic Republic of Congo)\r\n(spoke in French): The delegation of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, through the authoritative voice\r\nof His Excellency, the President of the Republic, Major\r\nGeneral Joseph Kabila, has already had an opportunity\r\nto congratulate you on the devotion, skill and\r\ncompetence with which you and the members of your\r\nBureau have been conducting the Assembly’s work. My\r\ndelegation would like to take this opportunity to say how\r\nmuch we appreciate the two reports of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the United Nations and on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration.\r\nWe would like to say that while highlighting the\r\nchallenges and difficulties facing the United Nations in\r\nhelping to attain the needs of world solidarity and\r\ncollective security, the Secretary-General indicates the\r\nfollowing in his reports: first, the number of Member\r\nStates of the United Nations has increased from 51,\r\nwhen it was first created, to 191 today. It is possible\r\nthat, thanks to the work done by the Special Committee\r\non decolonization, this number may increase.\r\nSecondly, the objectives of peace and security\r\noutlined in the Millennium Declaration have been\r\nassailed through the exacerbation of heinous acts such\r\nas terrorism, the proliferation of small arms and light\r\nweapons, anti-personnel mines, the threat posed by\r\nweapons of mass destruction, the upsurge in\r\ntransnational criminal networks and the looting of\r\nnatural resources in the name of the vague notion of\r\ndefending internal security interests. Thirdly, many\r\npeople throughout the world are overwhelmed by\r\nfamine, extreme poverty, total destitution, ignorance,\r\ndisease and unprecedented pandemics. Fourthly, social\r\nand economic progress have been halted in the wake of\r\nseveral wars.\r\nIn order to deal with all of these challenges and to\r\nchart the way towards strengthening and revitalizing\r\ninternational peace and security and, therefore,\r\ndevelopment, the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nbelieves that everything should be based on\r\ncoordinated action, bearing in mind, first, the\r\noverriding need to strengthen and supplement existing\r\nregimes dealing with weapons of mass destruction,\r\nsmall arms and light weapons, as well as anti-personnel\r\nmines. Secondly, we must also bear in mind the\r\nimposition of financial sanctions and arms embargoes\r\nto produce a kind of shock therapy on the behaviour of\r\nparties and to ensure compliance with the decisions of\r\nMember States. Thirdly, the adoption of effective\r\nmeasures to ruthlessly combat war economies as well\r\nas the trafficking in precious stones and raw materials\r\nthat very often fuel conflicts in the countries that\r\nproduce these resources. At this stage, everything\r\nshould be done to strengthen the diamond certification\r\nsystem within the Kimberley Process. Fourthly, a\r\ngenuine political and economic commitment by\r\nMember States is necessary in order to have a real\r\nimpact on all actors involved in armed conflicts.\r\nMy delegation, at this point, would like to remind\r\nthe Assembly of the request made by His Excellency,\r\nthe President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\non 24 September, to set up a United Nations fund to\r\nprovide compensation for the untold damage suffered\r\nby the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and to\r\nestablish, with the assistance of the United Nations, an\r\ninternational criminal tribunal for the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo to deal with crimes of genocide;\r\ncrimes against humanity, including rape used as a\r\nweapon of war; and mass violations of human rights.\r\nFifthly, in the area of development, there is a\r\nneed to take into account globalization as a positive\r\nforce for all humankind that should be based on a\r\nworld partnership for an increasingly diversified,\r\ndynamic kind of development.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations is essential in\r\norder to meet crucial needs, including, first, to make\r\nour collective security system credible; secondly to\r\nbuttress the principle of the sovereign equality of\r\nStates; thirdly to adapt to current conditions the\r\nmembership of some bodies that would become\r\nobsolete because they date back to 1945, and fourthly,\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nthe need to take into account the geopolitical realities\r\nof the twenty-first century.\r\nWhile we endorse the contents of the statement\r\nmade by the representative of the Kingdom of\r\nMorocco, speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo favours the strengthening as well as the\r\ndemocratization of multilateral institutions, particularly\r\nthrough strengthening the rule of law.\r\nMr. Sharma (Nepal): Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating you on your well-deserved election to\r\npreside over the fifty-eighth session of the United\r\nNations General Assembly. I admire your leadership\r\nand your vast experience in the diplomatic field and\r\nhave full confidence that we will have a successful\r\nsession under your leadership.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration embodies most, if\r\nnot all, of the principles and purposes of the United\r\nNations, spelt out in more concrete terms. Some have\r\neven said the Declaration is a second charter of the\r\nworld body. For now, implementation of the\r\nDeclaration is the primary task of the United Nations.\r\nHence, Nepal welcomes the scheme to consider\r\ntogether the reports on the work of the Organization\r\nand on the follow-up to the Millennium Summit.\r\nBoth reports indicate that the past 12 months saw\r\nmany advances and setbacks for the United Nations\r\nand for the world at large. The most appalling outrage\r\nduring this period was the two terrorist attacks on the\r\nUnited Nations compound in Baghdad, which killed\r\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and others. Our hearts go\r\nout to the bereaved families.\r\nIndeed, maintaining peace and security remains a\r\nmajor concern for the world and a daunting challenge\r\nfor the United Nations. Nepal appreciates what the\r\nUnited Nations has been doing to prevent and resolve\r\nconflicts, to stamp out terrorism and to promote\r\ndisarmament and a culture of peace around the world,\r\nwith remarkable success in some cases and not in others.\r\nSierra Leone and East Timor are two recent\r\nexamples of places where the United Nations has\r\nachieved its goals. However, the United Nations has\r\nfailed to act with regard to Iraq. It has not been able to\r\nstop the bloodshed, and for half a century it has not\r\nbeen able to resolve the festering Middle East crisis.\r\nAfghanistan, Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and a number of other conflict-\r\nridden places remain serious challenges for the world\r\nbody.\r\nDespite the United Nations initiative for\r\nconcerted global action against terrorism, that menace\r\nremains a major threat to world peace. Indeed, we must\r\nbring terror to its knees. At the same time, we must\r\naddress the root causes and constituents of terror, such\r\nas poverty, discrimination and lack of awareness and of\r\nopportunity. We must deny access of non-State actors\r\nto small arms and light weapons by revamping the\r\nrelevant global agreements.\r\nHis Majesty’s Government highly appreciates the\r\nSecretary-General’s concern about the Maoist\r\ninsurgency that is terrorizing Nepal and his kind offer\r\nof his good offices. We shall certainly avail ourselves\r\nof his generosity when we believe his good offices\r\nwould be most fruitful. We also applaud all those\r\nfriends who have been supporting us in dealing with\r\nthe Maoist problem and in carrying out quick-yielding\r\ndevelopmental activities in the affected areas.\r\nIt is disappointing that the United Nations\r\nConference on Disarmament has been caught in the prison\r\nof schismatic inertia and has not been able even to\r\nproduce a programme of work for the past several years,\r\nlet alone a strategy to rid the world of nuclear weapons\r\nwithin a specified time frame. Verification measures\r\nfor a chemical and nuclear weapons ban remain weak.\r\nWe must take urgent steps to revive disarmament as a\r\npriority agenda item for the United Nations.\r\nIt is troubling that nearly 800 million people are\r\nhungry and more than one fifth of the world’s people\r\nlive on less than a dollar a day, with nearly two thirds\r\nof them in Asia. The depth of poverty is appalling in\r\nsub-Saharan Africa. The United Nations deserves\r\ncredit for bringing the world community together to\r\nagree on the Millennium Development Goals, the\r\nMonterrey Consensus, the Johannesburg Programme of\r\nImplementation and other compacts to deal with the\r\nchallenge of development. Indeed, over the past couple\r\nof years, poverty and hunger have marginally receded.\r\nThe child mortality rate has declined and school\r\nenrolments have improved, both slightly. More\r\nresources are now available to fight HIV/AIDS,\r\nmalaria and tuberculosis, and since last year an upward\r\ntrend has been witnessed in development assistance.\r\nHowever, implementation of those agreements\r\nremains unconscionably slow, and progress remains\r\nstarkly inadequate. To meet the Millennium\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nDevelopment Goals, developing nations will need an\r\nadditional $50 billion in assistance annually, but the\r\nadditional pledges are scarcely one third of that figure.\r\nAnd the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative\r\nis moving at a snail’s pace, while highly indebted\r\ncountries continue to reel with the excruciating pain of\r\nunsustainable debt burdens. We must not allow the\r\nglobal economic slowdown to weaken our resolve or to\r\nhamper our progress.\r\nThe Doha Development Round — a linchpin of the\r\nefforts to fulfil the Millennium Development Goals —\r\ncollapsed in Cancún, and colossal farm subsidies and\r\nother tariff and non-tariff barriers of rich nations\r\npersist as obstacles to free trade and to growth in poor\r\ncountries. The failed Cancún trade talks should be\r\nsalvaged by quickly resuming negotiations so that the\r\npromise of Doha becomes a reality and does not remain\r\na mere mirage.\r\nThe United Nations has always stressed that\r\ndisadvantaged countries need special attention and\r\nadequate resources to mitigate their difficulties. Its\r\nfunds and programmes have done their best in that\r\nregard. For example, the Brussels Programme of\r\nAction for the Least Developed Countries has already\r\nbeen mainstreamed into the United Nations system. But\r\nthe overall result continues to be a cause of concern.\r\nDevelopment assistance to the least developed\r\ncountries is woefully inadequate. Duty-free and quota-\r\nfree access to markets, aimed at spurring their investment\r\nand trade, has yet to materialize. Unless they have access\r\nto more resources and to open markets, the least\r\ndeveloped countries — including Nepal and many\r\nAfrican States — will fail to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and the objectives of the Brussels\r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nThe landlocked developing countries suffer from\r\ngeographical handicaps, from an attendant lack of\r\naccess to sea-based resources and from high transit-\r\ntransport costs. That deprives them of many means of\r\nsurvival and of their comparative trade advantage. We\r\nfervently hope that implementation of the Almaty\r\nProgramme of Action will receive full support from\r\ntransit neighbours and development partners to\r\nameliorate the difficulties of the landlocked developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThe Barbados Programme of Action should be\r\nimplemented with all seriousness to help the small\r\nisland developing States to address their unique\r\nproblems. Developing countries have long demanded a\r\ntransformation in the international financial\r\narchitecture to make it inherently fair and more\r\nrepresentative and to enhance its legitimacy. Such a\r\nchange is essential to give poor countries a voice in\r\ndeciding their own destiny. It is a pity that not much\r\nhas happened in that area so far.\r\nA better world will continue to elude us if we fail\r\nto bring democracy, human rights, justice and good\r\ngovernance to ordinary people across the globe.\r\nHumanitarian assistance will continue to be a priority\r\nin helping vulnerable people at their moment of dire\r\nneed. Nepal appreciates the fact that the United\r\nNations has been promoting human rights, justice and\r\ngood governance and has been providing humanitarian\r\nassistance throughout the world.\r\nWe support the United Nations in its endeavours\r\nto advance gender balance inside the Organization and\r\noutside in the global community. The tangible role of\r\nthe United Nations as an advocate and promoter of\r\njustice and good governance in individual countries\r\nand in the wider world finds favour in my country. We\r\nfeel acute pain whenever United Nations forums are\r\nused not for policy, but for politics, and it is dragged\r\ninto unnecessary controversy.\r\nThe United Nations has won accolades as a key\r\nagency for humanitarian aid to needy people ravaged\r\nby wars, conflicts and calamities. It has worked\r\nstrenuously to protect, maintain and repatriate refugees.\r\nNepal profoundly praises the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees and other agencies for\r\ntheir help in looking after the nearly 100,000\r\nBhutanese refugees, and we encourage them to sustain\r\ntheir assistance until the refugees return to Bhutan.\r\nA strong United Nations will be vital in achieving\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and the other\r\nobjectives of the Millennium Declaration. Therefore,\r\nNepal welcomes the Secretary-General’s proposal for\r\nreforms in the United Nations. We believe reform is a\r\nprocess rather than an event. Consistent efforts,\r\ntherefore, will have to be made, not only to improve\r\ndecision-making processes, but also the mechanisms\r\nfor executing decisions.\r\nFor too long, we have focused on narrowing the\r\nagendas of the General Assembly and the Economic\r\nand Social Council as a way to reform these principal\r\norgans. This is indeed important. But these organs will\r\nnot be able to develop the strong constituency crucial\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nto revamping them until their resolutions are properly\r\nimplemented and make a difference in people’s lives.\r\nThis is where our emphasis should increasingly be in\r\nthe days ahead.\r\nSecurity Council reforms have been on the\r\nagenda of the international community for over a\r\ndecade. While modest progress has been achieved in\r\ndemocratizing its work, the Council remains\r\nunrepresentative and outdated in its structure. Nepal\r\ncalls on all nations to show flexibility and a spirit of\r\naccommodation, to remove the snags that have gotten\r\nin the way and frustrated our efforts for Security\r\nCouncil reform.\r\nFinally, Nepal views in a positive light the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal to establish a high-level\r\npanel to suggest reforms. We believe the panel must be\r\nrepresentative and reflect the diverse constituencies\r\nand interests that the world body has the obligation to\r\naddress. While the panel should be free to formulate its\r\nown informed recommendations, it must engage in a\r\ntransparent, open-ended and regular interface with\r\nMember States, who thus would not be surprised by\r\nany of the panel’s recommendations. Only this will\r\nensure the success of reforms.\r\nThe President: In accordance with the decision\r\ntaken earlier at this meeting, I now call on the observer\r\nof the Holy See.\r\nArchbishop Migliore (Holy See): Mr. President,\r\nsince this is the first time my delegation is taking the\r\nfloor under your presidency, allow me to join the\r\nprevious speakers in congratulating you and the other\r\nmembers of the Bureau.\r\nWhen heads of State and Governments at the 2000\r\nMillennium Summit committed themselves to reaching\r\nmeasurable targets by 2015, they were thinking of this\r\nnot only as inspirational, but also as practically viable.\r\nWith 12 years remaining until that target year, my\r\ndelegation reaffirms its commitment to the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, believes in their practical viability\r\nas effective tools of political mobilization in favour of\r\nthe marginalized and unites itself with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call to “take a hard look at the existing\r\n‘architecture’ of international institutions ...” (A/58/323,\r\npara. 91).\r\nThe struggle to reach the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals is a struggle for the globalization of\r\nethics, equity, inclusion, human security, sustainability\r\nand development. Such benefits can be delivered by\r\nmarket forces only if attention is paid to the\r\npreservation and enhancement of human, community\r\nand environmental resources. The efficiency of the\r\ninternational trade and financial systems should be\r\nmeasured by their effective contribution to the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThus, the challenge is to find an effective framework of\r\nrules and institutions for stronger local, national, regional\r\nand global governance, to ensure that globalization\r\nworks for the good of people and not just for profit.\r\nThe international community should refashion the\r\nexisting ideas of political equality, social justice and\r\nliberty and redesign these into a coherent political\r\nproject, robust enough for a world where power is\r\nexercised on a transnational scale and where risks are\r\nshared by peoples around the world.\r\nWhen we speak of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, we are addressing our immediate future and,\r\nthus, we are talking about children. Children are the\r\nmost precious treasure, deserving of the utmost love\r\nand respect, and they are given to each generation as a\r\nchallenge to its wisdom and humanity. The well-being\r\nof the world’s children depends greatly on the\r\nmeasures taken by States to support and help families\r\nfulfil their natural life-giving and formative functions.\r\nIt is interesting to note that, in 1946, when the\r\nGeneral Assembly created the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF), its acronym was\r\nunderstood as the United Nations International\r\nChildren’s “Emergency” Fund. Despite the change in\r\nmeaning, the same sense is now applicable in situations\r\nwhere children are not welcome, where their rights are\r\ntrampled upon and their plight is to be abandoned. It is\r\na real emergency that must be addressed quickly if we\r\nwant to preserve society.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation reaffirms the central\r\nimportance of education. Education, however, should not\r\nonly entail knowledge of information but knowledge with\r\na direction. While global media networks and satellite\r\ncommunications can promote transnational cultural\r\ndiversity, they should also endeavour to safeguard\r\ncultural identities. National and indigenous cultures\r\nshould flourish alongside foreign cultures.\r\nThe feminization of poverty and various\r\nhistorical forms of women’s marginalization have\r\ndeprived the human race of untold resources. A\r\nheartening response to this problem is the gradual\r\n29\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nincrease of women’s participation in the formal labour\r\nmarket. Yet women’s unpaid work hours remain high,\r\nand most nations’ labour laws do not recognize the\r\nvital importance of work or care at home.\r\nWith the conditions necessary for peace so\r\nelusive, my delegation is profoundly concerned about\r\nsecurity and terrorism. An unwanted side-effect of\r\ntechnological progress and economic globalization has\r\nbeen the dramatic increase of human trafficking,\r\nespecially in women and children, spawning drug\r\nrelated crimes, triggering weapons trade and feeding\r\nstreet crime and civil strife. In areas affected by economic\r\nstagnation, structural adjustment programmes have led to\r\nthe dismantling of State services.\r\nChronic environmental degradation is becoming\r\ntoday’s silent emergency. The irrational exploitation of\r\nnatural resources is resulting in less biodiversity and\r\nfewer forests. Unfortunately, most of the costs are\r\nborne by the poor, while the world’s rich benefit the\r\nmost.\r\nMy delegation appreciates, above all, that in\r\nputting flesh to the Millennium Development Goals,\r\ntireless efforts are being exerted by the United Nations\r\nsystem in guiding Governments, assisted by civil\r\nsociety, to set up mechanisms that make ethical\r\nstandards and human rights binding for nations,\r\ncorporations and individuals. In that manner,\r\nmultilateral agreements help to establish global\r\nmarkets that are consistent with human development.\r\nThe Holy See understands that the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, noted for their preferential focus\r\non the poor, are not a transitory target-driven goal but a\r\npermanent task and commitment. Those Goals are\r\ntechnically viable if every human being, who is the\r\nstakeholder and centre of those Goals, is also put at the\r\ncentre of the economic thinking and of the architecture\r\nof all international organizations, including those\r\ndealing with finances and trade.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on these items.\r\nOur joint debate on item 10, “Report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization”,\r\nand item 60, “Follow-up of the outcome of the\r\nMillennium Summit”, has been both interesting and\r\nwide-ranging. The 68 representatives participating in\r\nthe debate, including on behalf of groups of States and\r\nregional organizations, indicates that the views of a\r\nwide cross section of Member States and organizations\r\nwere reflected in the debate.\r\nIt was clear from the debate that the information\r\nprovided by the Secretary-General in his reports on the\r\nOrganization’s work and on Millennium Summit\r\nfollow-up, and his address of 23 September 2003,\r\nfocused on the work of the Organization, were\r\ncarefully reviewed and evaluated, so that comments on\r\nthese two priority issues were succinct and cogent. I\r\nknow that I speak for us all in thanking the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his reports and for his statement, which\r\ngave important orientation to our debate.\r\nUnited Nations reform has come centre stage as\r\none of the critical issues that the Organization must\r\naddress, and, understandably, was among the issues\r\ngiven particular focus in the debate. Many commented\r\non the reform issue in the context of the war in Iraq,\r\ncontending that it severely tested the principle of\r\ncollective security and the resilience of the United\r\nNations. The Organization has, indeed, been sorely\r\ntested over the past year. Reform that can better\r\nposition it to respond to serious challenges is an\r\nimperative, and was given widespread support.\r\nSubstantial comments were made on the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal to establish a high-level\r\npanel to make recommendations on United Nations\r\nreform. Already, Member States are giving\r\nconsideration to the terms of reference of the panel,\r\nand to what they expect from it. The case was made\r\nthat the panel’s report should be a conceptual one,\r\nreflecting on the nature of changes occurring in the\r\ninternational system, and possible responses to those\r\nchanges. Security risks related to globalization,\r\ndevelopment gaps, international solidarity and good\r\ngovernance were among the issues speakers expected\r\nthe panel to take up.\r\nA number of ideas were put forward on the matter\r\nof Security Council reform, indicating that this remains\r\na priority issue, notwithstanding the fact that no\r\ncomprehensive agreement has been reached over the\r\npast 10 years. It was contended by some that given the\r\nstrategic importance of the Security Council, its reform\r\nshould outweigh the single political agenda of any\r\nMember State. The view was also expressed that\r\nrestarting the stalled reform process would prove that\r\nthe United Nations is ready to adapt and adjust, and\r\nthereby, to uphold its authority in the world affairs.\r\n30\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nAmong the opinions expressed on the specific\r\nissue of Security Council membership, it was\r\ncontended that Member States that wanted to, and\r\ncould, shoulder global responsibility as permanent\r\nmembers of the Council should be considered for such\r\nmembership. It was also emphasized that new geopolitical\r\nrealities and better geographical representation on the\r\nCouncil were key issues for resolution.\r\nRegarding revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly, there was broad agreement that further\r\nstreamlining and consolidating of its agenda were\r\ncritical, and a number of proposals were made in\r\nrespect of approaches that might be taken. Our\r\napproach to resolutions of the Assembly was also the\r\nsubject of some thought-provoking commentary. We\r\nwere, in particular, invited to reflect on whether the\r\nway we traditionally introduce resolutions, sometimes\r\nwith very few changes from year to year, serve their\r\nintended purpose or reflect the current situation, and\r\nwhether the best way to influence the situation is to\r\nroutinely request another report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. It was proposed that we further consider bi-\r\nand tri-annualization of resolutions, discontinue some\r\nof our initiatives, or change their focus.\r\nThe importance of the General Assembly, as the\r\nmain decision- and policy-making organ of the United\r\nNations, compels us to give careful consideration to\r\nproposals such as those put forward in the debate. This\r\nis particularly important for me as President of the\r\nAssembly, since, as you know, revitalization of the\r\nAssembly is among my priorities, and is also essential\r\nto our critical tasks of implementation and follow-up\r\ndecisions.\r\nThe debate also provided the opportunity for\r\nmany to share perspectives on the need for an\r\nappropriate response to new and existing threats to\r\ninternational peace and security, such as the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. While\r\nthere was broad support for the General Assembly’s\r\nbeing actively involved in addressing these grave\r\nissues, it was emphasized that its initiatives in this area\r\nmust take fully into account respect for human rights\r\nand for international law.\r\nIn the current global environment, it was to be\r\nexpected that particular attention would be given to\r\nmobilizing global action against terrorism, and this was\r\nreflected in the debate of items 10 and 60.\r\nMultilateralism was cited as the most efficient weapon\r\nin the fight against terrorism. As with the approach to\r\nnew and existing threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity, it was the generally held view that the\r\ndevelopment of a long-term anti-terrorism strategy\r\nmust be in strict conformity with the basic principles of\r\nthe United Nations, including full respect for human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms and international law. It\r\nwas also stressed by many delegations that there could be\r\nno justification for linking any particular religion with\r\nterrorism. In that regard, the opinion was expressed\r\nthat recent incidents in different parts of the world\r\nshow that no religion is immune to terrorist attacks.\r\nAttention was drawn to the illicit trade and\r\ntransfer of small arms and light weapons, as matters of\r\ngrave concern to developing countries, especially in\r\nAfrica. Many delegations called for renewed\r\ncommitment and action to prevent and control the\r\nmovement of these weapons, because they exacerbate\r\nconflicts and political instability and have a serious\r\nimpact on violent crime and criminality.\r\nA broad approach to United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations received support, with some making proposals\r\nfor the improvement of the work done by the United\r\nNations as part of these operations. The coordination of\r\nassistance and protection of civilians in armed conflict,\r\nprovision of humanitarian assistance, disarmament and\r\nvarious aspects of development were among the issues\r\naddressed in this context.\r\nTurning to the Millennium Summit and the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, a majority stressed\r\nthat there was much work to be done to achieve the\r\nGoals. Attaining the Goals and meeting the targets\r\nagreed to in the Millennium Declaration was\r\nconsidered to be the shared responsibility of developed\r\nand developing countries alike. It was also the\r\ngenerally held view that a common effort had to be\r\nmade to ensure that the Goals are the focus of national\r\nas well as global action.\r\nIncessant calls were made for developed\r\ncountries to meet the commitments they have made,\r\nparticularly in the area of official development\r\nassistance, and for them to support a more equitable\r\ntrading system. It was also emphasized that developing\r\ncountries have a stake, and must participate in,\r\ninternational economic decision-making.\r\nBefore us for urgent consideration and action is\r\nthe suggestion that donor countries work towards an\r\nagreement among themselves on a set of deadlines for\r\n31\r\nA/58/PV.27\r\nmore equitable trade, debt relief and to meet their\r\nofficial development assistance commitments, in order\r\nto achieve the eighth Millennium Development Goal. It\r\nis also before us for consideration that a universal\r\nreporting system be established for donor countries on\r\nprogress made in achieving that objective.\r\nIt was suggested that developing countries give\r\ndirection to processes set out in the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals by assigning their own priorities,\r\nelaborating appropriate strategies and focusing on the\r\neffective implementation of poverty-reduction policies.\r\nThe opinion was expressed that good governance is an\r\nimportant underpinning for initiatives in this area.\r\nThe Monterrey Consensus, adopted by the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development,\r\nsupports a framework of mutual obligations and mutual\r\naccountability, to which all States are committed. The\r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Financing for Development,\r\nscheduled for 29-30 October 2003, is an important\r\nevent for refocusing attention on the commitments\r\nmade at Monterrey and maintaining the impetus in this\r\narea. We have an obligation — Member States and\r\ninternational agencies alike — to ensure that the High-\r\nlevel dialogue proceeds as envisaged by heads of State\r\nand Government at Monterrey, and in the resolution of\r\nthe General Assembly on the convening of the\r\nDialogue. Therefore, support expressed for the\r\nDialogue should translate into high-level participation\r\nfrom capitals and agencies.\r\nThe debate pointed to some joint efforts that are\r\nbeing made that would enhance prospects for achieving\r\nreal progress in realizing the objectives of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. It has been noted in\r\nthat respect that the Group of 77 and China has\r\nestablished a multiyear programme of work — 2004 to\r\n2017 — in order to maintain the momentum of\r\ncommitments made last year at the World Summit for\r\nSustainable Development in Johannesburg. This\r\nemphasizes the priority given to the Johannesburg\r\noutcome as a blueprint for the achievement of the\r\nsustainable development goals. Initiatives such as this\r\nare essential for translating the provisions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s resolution on the integrated\r\nfollow-up to major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits into reality.\r\nThe Group of 77’s initiative should also buttress\r\nour efforts to ensure that the 2005 major event will lead\r\nto the timely achievement of the Development Goals.\r\nSupport has been expressed for that major event, in the\r\nhope that it will provide new political impetus to\r\nachieve the goals set by the Millennium Declaration\r\nand at major United Nations summits and conferences.\r\nThe hope was expressed, as well, that the event would\r\nalso give impetus to the reform of the United Nations.\r\nWe have had a full and fruitful discussion, and I\r\nhave taken this opportunity to share my views with the\r\nAssembly on the salient issues raised in our\r\ndeliberations. But we cannot leave it here. I would urge\r\nall to reflect on the comments and proposals made, and,\r\nwhere these require further consideration and action\r\nthat would enhance our shared endeavours, to act\r\naccordingly.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes\r\nnote of the report of the Secretary-General on the work\r\nof the Organization contained in document A/58/1?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We have thus concluded this\r\nstage of our consideration of agenda items 10 and 60.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.35 p.m.\r\n"
