Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nOrganization of work of the fifty-eighth regular\r\nsession of the General Assembly, adoption of the\r\nagenda and allocation of items\r\nSecond report of the General Committee\r\n(A/58/250/Add.1)\r\nThe President: I should like to draw the attention\r\nof representatives to the second report of the General\r\nCommittee (A/58/250/Add.1), concerning a request by\r\nthe Secretary-General for the inclusion in the agenda of\r\nan additional item, “Financing of the United Nations\r\nMission in Liberia”; a request by the Netherlands for\r\nthe inclusion in the agenda of an additional item,\r\n“Admission of the International Criminal Court to\r\nmembership in the United Nations Joint Staff Pension\r\nFund”; and a request contained in a letter dated 3\r\nOctober 2003 from the Permanent Representative of\r\nMexico to the United Nations, addressed to the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, concerning the\r\nallocation of agenda item 108, “Crime prevention and\r\ncriminal justice”.\r\nIn paragraph 1 (a) of the report, the General\r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that\r\nan additional item, entitled “Financing of the United\r\nNations Mission to Liberia”, be included in the agenda\r\nof the current session. May I take it that the General\r\nAssembly decides to include this additional item in the\r\nagenda of the current session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 1 (b), the General\r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that\r\nthe additional item be allocated to the Fifth Committee.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to allocate this\r\nitem to the Fifth Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members\r\nthat this item becomes agenda item 165.\r\nIn paragraph 2 (a) of the report, the General\r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that\r\nan additional item, entitled “Admission of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court to membership in the\r\nUnited Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund”, be included\r\nin the agenda of the current session. May I take it that\r\nthe General Assembly decides to include this additional\r\nitem in the agenda of the current session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 2 (b), the General\r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that\r\nthe additional item be allocated to the Fifth Committee.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to allocate this\r\nitem to the Fifth Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members\r\nthat this item becomes agenda item 166.\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nIn paragraph 3 of the report, the General\r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that\r\nagenda item 108, “Crime prevention and criminal\r\njustice”, also be considered directly in plenary meeting\r\nfor the sole purpose of taking action on the draft United\r\nNations Convention against Corruption.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto also consider agenda item 108, “Crime prevention\r\nand criminal justice”, directly in plenary meeting for\r\nthe sole purpose of taking action on the draft United\r\nNations Convention against Corruption?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The Chairmen of the Third and\r\nFifth Committees will be informed of the decisions just\r\ntaken.\r\nAgenda item 7\r\nNotification by the Secretary-General under Article\r\n12, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/58/354)\r\nThe President: As members are aware, in\r\naccordance with the provisions of Article 12, paragraph\r\n2, of the Charter of the United Nations, and with the\r\nconsent of the Security Council, the Secretary-General\r\nis mandated to notify the General Assembly of matters\r\nrelative to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity that are being dealt with by the Security\r\nCouncil and of matters which the Council has ceased to\r\ndeal with.\r\nIn that connection, the General Assembly has\r\nbefore it a note by the Secretary-General issued as\r\ndocument A/58/354. May I take it that the Assembly\r\ntakes note of that document?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 11\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/58/2)\r\nThe President: As we begin our consideration of\r\nthe report of the Security Council, I believe it\r\nimportant to draw attention to relevant provisions of\r\nseveral resolutions of the Assembly, including\r\nresolutions 47/233, 48/264 and 51/241, on what the\r\nAssembly’s approach to the report ought to be. These\r\nresolutions concern the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly and reform issues generally. The practical\r\neffect of the relevant provisions of the resolutions is\r\nthat they present specific courses of action the\r\nAssembly and, indeed, the President should take in\r\nconsidering the report of the Security Council.\r\nFor example, first, the resolutions encourage\r\nMember States to participate actively in the substantive\r\nand in-depth discussions on and consideration of the\r\nreport of the Security Council, in order to fulfil the\r\nrelevant provisions of the Charter of the United\r\nNations, and, secondly, the President is asked to assess\r\nthe debate on this item and consider the need for\r\nfurther consideration of the report. In light of this\r\nassessment, informal consultations might be\r\nundertaken to discuss the need and content of any\r\naction by the Assembly based on the debate.\r\nI wish to remind the Assembly that this agenda\r\nitem remains open — I underscore, remains open — to\r\nfurther discussion necessary during the year, including\r\ndiscussion on additional reports the Council may\r\npresent to the General Assembly.\r\nI would encourage delegations to keep in mind\r\nthese matters, contained in resolutions that this\r\nAssembly adopted by consensus, as we address the\r\nSecurity Council’s report.\r\nBefore I go any further, may I make again a very\r\nspecial request relating to cellular phones. Please keep\r\nyour cellular phones on vibrate so as to allow speakers,\r\nand even myself in the Chair, to better follow what is\r\ntaking place. It is most disruptive, when a speaker is at\r\nthe rostrum, for cellular phones to sound off. You\r\nwould not like it to happen when your representative is\r\nspeaking, please do not do it to anybody else. I crave\r\nyour indulgence in this particular matter.\r\nI now give the floor to the President of the\r\nSecurity Council, Mr. John Negroponte, to introduce\r\nthe report of the Council.\r\nMr. Negroponte: I am pleased to report, Mr.\r\nPresident, that I forgot to bring my cellular phone with\r\nme this morning.\r\nI have the privilege, in my capacity as President\r\nof the Security Council for the month of October 2003,\r\nto introduce the annual report of the Security Council\r\nto the General Assembly.\r\nOn behalf of the Security Council, I would like to\r\nextend my congratulations to you, Mr. Hunte, on your\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nelection as President of the fifty-eighth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I know that I speak for all members\r\nof the Security Council when I say that I am certain\r\nthat, during your tenure, relations between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council will be further\r\nstrengthened, as we work together to promote the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter.\r\nThe report I am introducing covers the period\r\nfrom 1 August 2002 to 31 July 2003. The seemingly\r\never-increasing trend towards an increased workload\r\nfor the Security Council continued during this\r\nreporting period.\r\nThere were many areas of focus, including Iraq,\r\nthe Middle East and Afghanistan, which are covered in\r\ndetail in the report. Africa continued to be a major\r\npriority for the Council, which responded to worsening\r\nconflicts in Côte d’Ivoire and Liberia, while working to\r\nencourage and foster continuing progress in bringing\r\npeace and stability to the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and Burundi. The Security Council undertook\r\nmissions to Central and West Africa and focused on\r\nseveral issues affecting Africa, such as the threat of\r\nsmall arms and mercenaries and the role of Council\r\nmissions and other United Nations mechanisms in\r\npromoting peace and security on the continent.\r\nIn addition to addressing specific ongoing\r\nconflicts, the Security Council also held thematic\r\ndiscussions directly related to the Council’s work,\r\nwhich will allow for fruitful discussions with the larger\r\nUnited Nations membership. The Council held open\r\ndebates on women, peace and security, on children and\r\narmed conflict, on small arms, on the interaction of the\r\nSecurity Council and regional organizations, on the\r\nthreat of small arms and mercenary activities to West\r\nAfrica, and on the pacific settlement of disputes. The\r\nissue of the protection of civilians in armed conflict\r\nwas pursued on a six-monthly basis, with debates held\r\nin December 2002 and June 2003.\r\nThe serious and continuing threat to global peace\r\nand security posed by terrorism remained a primary\r\nfocus of the Council. The Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee continued to work intensively to fulfil its\r\nmandate as set out in resolution 1373 (2001). The\r\nCommittee conducted detailed dialogues with all\r\nMember States, concentrating on ensuring, as a first\r\npriority, that States have in place legislation covering\r\nall aspects of resolution 1373 (2001) and the executive\r\nmachinery to tackle terrorist financing.\r\nThese issues I have mentioned provide only a\r\nquick overview of some of the larger areas covered by\r\nthe work of the Council during the last year.\r\nDuring the debate on this agenda item in recent\r\nyears, Assembly members have put forward a number\r\nof ideas with regard to a better presentation of the\r\nSecurity Council’s annual report to the General\r\nAssembly. Assembly members have suggested a\r\nshorter and more focused report, and I am happy to say\r\nthat this year’s report is 68 pages shorter than last\r\nyear’s, which in turn was itself more than 300 pages\r\nshorter than its predecessor. This year’s report also\r\nopens with a narrative overview of the Council’s\r\nactivities, a continuation of an innovation begun last\r\nyear at the suggestion of Assembly members.\r\nAlthough the last year was an especially busy\r\none, there was an increase in the already growing trend\r\ntoward transparency in the work of the Security\r\nCouncil. The Council took care to hold as many public\r\nmeetings as possible and regularly conducted wrap-up\r\nsessions and provided opportunities for all Member\r\nStates to attend briefings.\r\nFor example, of the 200 meetings held during the\r\nperiod of this report, only eight were closed, excluding\r\nthe ongoing consultations with troop-contributing\r\ncountries. This compares with 32 closed meetings\r\nduring the previous year. This emphasis on greater\r\ntransparency is intended to allow the wider United\r\nNations membership to remain in closer touch with the\r\nCouncil and its deliberations.\r\nIn concluding, I would like to express my\r\nappreciation to my colleagues on the Security Council\r\nfor their deep dedication and commitment to the cause\r\nof peace and security. On behalf of all Council\r\nmembers, I would like to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his vision and leadership and to express our\r\ngratitude to the members of the Secretariat for their\r\nprofessionalism and daily support, without which the\r\nCouncil could not complete its duties.\r\nMr. Haraguchi (Japan): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing my appreciation to the President of the\r\nSecurity Council, Ambassador John D. Negroponte, for\r\nhis introduction of the annual report of the Security\r\nCouncil on its work. I would also like to thank the\r\nUnited Kingdom and Spain for drafting the\r\nintroduction to the report.\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nIn the period covered by this report, the issue of\r\nIraq figured prominently on the agenda of the Security\r\nCouncil, as the introduction to the report indicates.\r\nMuch of the Council’s time and energy was consumed\r\nby discussions of the Iraqi issue. In that process,\r\nquestions have been raised on the effectiveness of the\r\nSecurity Council with regard to its primary role of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security.\r\nI understand that there was an active discussion\r\namong Security Council members on how each\r\nmember’s views should be reflected in the report\r\nduring the drafting process. I was looking forward to\r\nhearing these frank views in an open meeting of the\r\nCouncil, as has occurred in previous years. However,\r\ncontrary to the previous practice, no Council member\r\ntook the floor to present their views this time. From the\r\nstandpoint of ensuring transparency and accountability\r\nof the Council to non-members, it was regrettable that\r\nwe were not able to hear the views of the Council\r\nmembers directly.\r\nI do not intend to comment on the substance of\r\neach of the activities of the Council as summarized in\r\nthe report at this time. However, let me raise two points\r\nwhich Council members may deem worth considering.\r\nMy first point relates to the issue of ensuring the\r\nopenness of the activities of the Council to non-\r\nmembers. Japan welcomes the fact that the Council has\r\nbecome increasingly aware of the need to ensure its\r\nopenness to non-members in recent years and that open\r\ndebate meetings are now held more frequently, as was\r\njust confirmed in the report of Ambassador\r\nNegroponte.\r\nFrom time to time a Council meeting which had\r\nbeen announced as an open briefing has been changed\r\nto an open debate. That should be a welcome\r\ndevelopment, but those changes in format were often\r\nannounced on very short notice. In the case of the\r\ndiscussion on Kosovo, that took place in August, for\r\nexample, we were informed of the change of format for\r\nthe first time in the Journal of the very day on which\r\nthe debate was to be held. As a result, not many non-\r\nCouncil members were able to take full advantage of\r\nthe opportunity presented.\r\nWe would like to request that the Council make\r\nsure that reasonable advance notice is given in case of\r\nsuch changes, in order to enable non-Council members\r\nto make full use of their opportunity to participate. The\r\nsame thing can also be said of the emergency meetings\r\nof the Council, such as the one held at the beginning of\r\nthis month. I know it is difficult to announce the\r\nholding of an emergency meeting well in advance,\r\nsimply because it is an emergency meeting. However, I\r\nconsider it necessary for the Council to search for a\r\nmeans to ensure that all non-members are informed of\r\nsuch an emergency meetings beforehand so that they\r\ncan express their views if they wish to do so.\r\nIn addition, there have been cases in the past in\r\nwhich wrap-up sessions, whose original purpose was to\r\nreview the activities of the Council for the month,\r\ndigressed from their original purpose by engaging in a\r\nthematic discussion that was totally unrelated to the\r\nCouncil’s activities during that month.\r\nThese are some of the examples of the procedural\r\nissues that have caused frustration among non-\r\nmembers such as my country. I hope that the members\r\nof the Council would continue to make efforts towards\r\nprocedural improvements in these areas.\r\nOn a second matter, Japan would like to request\r\nthat the Council continue to look for means to involve\r\nmore substantially those non-Council members with a\r\nvital interest in an issue under discussion, in the\r\nCouncil’s decision-making process.\r\nAs for resolutions that have budgetary\r\nimplications, including those relating to peacekeeping\r\noperations (PKOs), political missions and peace-\r\nconsolidation, transparency needs to be ensured,\r\nparticularly with respect to major financial contributing\r\ncountries, when adopting resolutions or reviewing their\r\nimplementation.\r\nA mechanism for consultation has been\r\nestablished between the Council and troop contributing\r\ncountries (TCCs) regarding specific PKOs. Some\r\nmechanism of a similar nature is needed for major\r\nfinancial contributors, because they are obliged to\r\naccount for their financial contributions to their\r\ntaxpayers. It is not reasonable to expect that those non-\r\nCouncil members which share the bulk of such\r\nexpenses will simply passively issue the cheques\r\nnecessary for implementation of the decisions made by\r\nthe 15 countries on the Council, without being given a\r\nchance to consult on the decisions or to confirm\r\nwhether the decisions have been properly implemented.\r\nIn this connection, I would like to point out again\r\nthat we have yet to receive sufficient explanation with\r\nregard to budgetary transparency for Security Council\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nmissions, an issue that my delegation has raised\r\ncontinuously. However, I wish to add on this occasion,\r\nthat Japan does acknowledge that improvement has\r\nbeen realized on other issues of transparency, including\r\nthe provision of detailed briefings before and after the\r\ndispatch of Security Council missions.\r\nProcedural improvement of the Council is\r\nimportant; however, that alone is not sufficient to\r\nenhance the legitimacy of the Council. We need to\r\nreform the Council by including those countries which\r\nare both willing and able to shoulder responsibility at\r\nthe global level as permanent members. I intend to\r\nelaborate Japan’s view on this issue under the agenda\r\nitem, “Question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters”, which is to be taken up following the\r\ndiscussion on this item.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): We welcome this debate\r\non the report of the Security Council (A/58/2) and the\r\nreport of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters Related to the Security Council (A/57/47 and\r\nCorr.1). As in previous discussions, it is the\r\nexpectation of my delegation that the views being\r\nexpressed here, especially on the report of the Security\r\nCouncil, will be taken into account by the members of\r\nthe Council.\r\nNamibia rejoiced when peace finally came to\r\nAngola, after many years of political strife. While the\r\nguns have gone silent, the Government of Angola is\r\nearnestly grappling with social and economic\r\nchallenges. It is therefore imperative, as we applaud the\r\npositive developments in Angola, that we, as members\r\nof the international community, support the efforts of\r\nthe Government towards the consolidation of peace and\r\nreconstruction. The spirit of national reconciliation,\r\nwhich the people of Angola have embarked upon, can\r\nonly be nurtured by favourable social and economic\r\nconditions.\r\nFollowing three years of repeated appeals by the\r\nAfrican Member States, the Security Council has\r\nfinally approved a new concept of operations for the\r\nUnited Nations Organization Mission in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), which\r\nstrengthened the Mission. Namibia welcomes this\r\npositive step and the installation of the transitional\r\nGovernment in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nHowever, we remain concerned that the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of that country\r\ncontinue to be violated. The situation in the eastern\r\npart remains particularly worrying. Gross violations of\r\nhuman rights, including rape, murder, the destruction\r\nof property, the large-scale displacement of civilians,\r\nthe use of child soldiers and the illegal exploitation of\r\nnatural resources, continue unabated.\r\nNamibia welcomes the recommendations on the\r\nsituation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as\r\ncontained in the report of the Security Council mission\r\nto Central Africa (S/2003/653). We concur with the\r\nsentiments of paragraph 4 on the role to be played by\r\nthe leadership of the Government of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, “to put the national ahead of\r\nthe factional interest”. In that respect, let me add that\r\nthis will only be possible if and when all the States in\r\nthe region uphold in earnest Article 2 of the Charter.\r\nFurthermore, we welcome the recommendation\r\nconcerning intolerance of impunity. However, to\r\nachieve the desired goal, pressure must be exerted on\r\nthose who hold influence over the armed factions in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. It is not enough to\r\ndeplore the impunity that accompanies the aggression\r\nand the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of\r\nthat country; those responsible must be held\r\naccountable.\r\nWe welcome the proposed international\r\nconference on the Great Lakes region and hope that\r\nthis will mark the beginning of lasting peace for the\r\nCongolese people, as well as for the people of the\r\nwhole region.\r\nMy delegation read the report of the Security\r\nCouncil mission to West Africa (S/2003/688) with\r\ngreat interest.\r\nIt is gratifying to note that the situation in Sierra\r\nLeone has stabilized, and that the process of\r\ngovernance is on course. If we are to meaningfully\r\nassist the people of Sierra Leone in that regard, we\r\nmust help them to create conditions for sustainable\r\ndevelopment, in which their natural resources will be\r\nexploited to their benefit. It is our hope that the\r\nKimberly Process Certification Scheme will contribute\r\ntowards this end. While the United Nations Mission in\r\nSierra Leone is drawing down, the situation in the\r\nregion must be taken into account, as should the\r\npossible impact it might have on the reconstruction of\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nSierra Leone. Particular attention must be paid to the\r\nsituation of women, children and refugees.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the joint mission of the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil’s Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Guinea-Bissau\r\nto that country. We support the recommendations of the\r\nmission for continued collaboration between the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council\r\nand for increased assistance to the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States.\r\nThe commitment of Polisario Front and the\r\nKingdom of Morocco to the ceasefire is a means to an\r\nend. While it is commendable, it must not be seen as a\r\nsubstitute to the right of the people of Western Sahara\r\nto self-determination. My delegation strongly supports\r\nthe immediate implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 1495 (2003) and calls for an increased role\r\nby the Secretary-General on this matter. In this regard,\r\nwe applaud the Polisario Front for its response to the\r\npeace plan, as presented by the Secretary-General’s\r\nPersonal Envoy.\r\nThere is unanimity in the Organization that\r\nSecurity Council resolutions are binding on all Member\r\nStates and that anything short of that will discredit the\r\nOrganization. It is therefore incomprehensible that\r\nSecurity Council resolutions on Palestine, and in\r\nparticular resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 1397\r\n(2002) continue to be flouted with impunity. We cannot\r\nuphold international law when adherence to Security\r\nCouncil decisions is an option for some and an\r\nobligation for others. Pressure cannot be exerted on the\r\noccupied, while the occupiers are being exonerated.\r\nThis concern is as valid for the situation in the Middle\r\nEast as it is for other situations anywhere in the world.\r\nThe people of Palestine deserve their own State, side\r\nby side with that of Israel.\r\nWhen the Security Council adopted resolution\r\n1325 (2000), it reaffirmed the role of women in the\r\nprocess of peace-making and peace-building. In many\r\nparts of the world, women are making their full\r\ncontribution to post-conflict reconstruction, a trend that\r\nmust be encouraged and supported. With regard to\r\nchildren and armed conflict, we call for their full\r\nprotection and urge those responsible to desist from\r\nusing and recruiting them.\r\nNamibia reaffirms its opposition to all acts,\r\nmethods and practices of terrorism, and reiterates its\r\ndetermination to combat it by every means available to\r\nit, in accordance with our national laws. Undoubtedly,\r\nwe must enhance cooperation among Member States to\r\nthat end.\r\nBut in doing so, Namibia continues to maintain\r\nthat, measures to combat international terrorism must\r\nbe in conformity with international obligations arising\r\nfrom treaties and other rules of international law. We\r\nfirmly hold the view that the principle of the rule of\r\nlaw is as central in today’s globalized institutions\r\ndedicated to combating terrorism as it is to national\r\npolitical systems. There is a need to ensure that those\r\nlegal tools dedicated to combat terrorism do not\r\nundermine values that are fundamental to democracy,\r\nliberty and justice — values that lie at the heart of the\r\ninternational constitutional order.\r\nIn these times of growing international tension,\r\nNamibia is concerned about the unilateral pressure\r\nbeing exerted on States parties to the Rome Statute of\r\nthe International Criminal Court to circumscribe their\r\nlegal commitment to the Statute. It is each State’s\r\nsovereign prerogative to become, or not to become, a\r\nparty — or even to withdraw. Furthermore, Namibia\r\nhas once again noticed with great concern the adoption\r\nof another Security Council resolution — resolution\r\n1497 (2003) — under Chapter VII of the Charter, as if\r\nthe ICC were a threat to peace or an act of aggression.\r\nIn our view, such resolutions can undermine the\r\njurisdiction of the ICC.\r\nWe last deliberated on these two items 12 months\r\nago, when a cloud of a possible war in Iraq was\r\nhanging over our heads and when all eyes were on the\r\nmembers of the Security Council in the hope that they\r\nwould reaffirm the centrality of the United Nations and\r\navert war. What has transpired between then and now,\r\nin a way, shapes our deliberations on peace and\r\nsecurity during this session. We have all welcomed the\r\nproposal to have a high-level review of the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nin 2005. The reform of the Security Council is part of\r\nthe commitment our leaders made at the Millennium\r\nSummit.\r\nThe challenges confronting us in the area of\r\npeace and security are a direct result of the\r\nunrepresentative and undemocratic nature of the\r\ncomposition and decision-making of the Security\r\nCouncil. For 12 years, brilliant ideas have been\r\nadvanced on how to correct the situation. For 12 years,\r\nwe have continued to seek courage to expand and\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\ndemocratize the Security Council. How much more\r\nmust the international situation deteriorate before we\r\nmake the Security Council relevant to today’s\r\nchallenges?\r\nMr. Sardenberg (Brazil): At the outset, I would\r\nlike to congratulate Ambassador John Negroponte,\r\nPresident of the Security Council, for having\r\nintroduced the report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, covering the period from 1 August\r\n2002 to 31 July 2003 (A/58/2). The submission of the\r\nannual report of the Security Council, under Articles\r\n15 and 24 of the Charter, is a commendable practice,\r\nwhich should enable a useful and wide-ranging\r\ndialogue between these two principal organs of the\r\nUnited Nations. The report is the Council’s opportunity\r\nto address the universal constituency on vital issues of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the efforts that have\r\nbeen made to produce an accessible and user-friendly\r\nannual report of the Security Council: one can easily\r\nfind the subjects under review, the number of meetings\r\ninvolved, the number of resolutions and presidential\r\nstatements adopted, the documents that have been\r\ncirculated, dates, and so on. However useful, the report\r\nstill falls short of an overview of the decision-making\r\nprocess, the goals envisaged or any of the positions\r\nadvocated by the members. We have been seeking a\r\nreport that is substantive rather than formal, analytical\r\nrather than descriptive.\r\nThe report’s introduction conveys a sense of the\r\nCouncil’s response to new and continuing challenges.\r\nWe look forward to a report that provides a fuller\r\nanalysis of how the Council deals with issues under its\r\nreview. It is emblematic that one of the subjects that\r\nmost figured on the agenda of the Council during the\r\nperiod covered by the report — the situation in Iraq —\r\nincluding debates at the ministerial level, has been\r\naccorded no more than three sentences in the analytical\r\nsection of the document. It seems important to know\r\nhow the Council manages its work, including possible\r\noptions that probably were at its disposal at the time.\r\nWe are aware that the Security Council is a body\r\nin which confidentiality and informality regarding the\r\ndecision-making process are part of the business. The\r\nsafeguards, however, should not compromise the\r\naccountability of the Council to the wide membership,\r\nwhich has entrusted it with the power to deal with the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nTransparency adds to the specific weight of Security\r\nCouncil decisions. A better clarification of the\r\nCouncil’s modus operandi can contribute to dispelling\r\npossible misgivings regarding its effectiveness and\r\neven relevance. Transparency and participation can\r\nonly enhance credibility and effectiveness.\r\nWe should encourage those practices that seem to\r\nbe constructive and that promote a better relationship\r\nbetween the Member States and the Council. The\r\nbriefings given by the presidency of the Security\r\nCouncil at the end of each informal consultation are a\r\nvaluable initiative for our follow-up of the discussions\r\nthat are taking place. Moreover, the end-of-month\r\nwrap-up meetings, which could be a regular practice,\r\nare positive means to enhance interaction and to\r\npromote synergy.\r\nMy delegation also understands that Security\r\nCouncil missions can play an important role in\r\ndetermining how the United Nations should be engaged\r\nin efforts on the ground, as they have been in the cases\r\nof Guinea-Bissau, Côte d’Ivoire, Burundi, the Great\r\nLakes region, Kosovo and, by the end of the month,\r\nAfghanistan. The submission of reports and the\r\ndiscussions that usually take place in the aftermath can\r\nproduce a constructive and vibrant exchange of ideas.\r\nFinally, the meetings with troop-contributing\r\ncountries are an important tool that could be\r\ninstitutionalized, since the great majority of Member\r\nStates whose personnel take part in peacekeeping\r\noperations are not represented on the Council. The\r\ngrowing complexity of United Nations missions\r\nmandated by the Council requires careful consideration\r\nof that contribution by all States concerned.\r\nNotwithstanding those positive developments,\r\nopportunities for exchanges between members and\r\nnon-members remain limited. Although discussions in\r\nthe Council should sometimes flow more freely, at\r\ntimes it is entirely appropriate, or even necessary, that\r\nMember States set out national positions during open\r\nmeetings. Ample opportunity and due consideration\r\nshould be given to the messages conveyed by the\r\nmembership as a whole, as they can enhance the debate\r\nand thus provide an important contribution to the\r\nCouncil’s deliberations.\r\nTo conclude, let me observe that attention should\r\nbe drawn to the increasing engagement of the Security\r\nCouncil in post-conflict situations and in the realities\r\nof reconstruction. There, concerns about political order\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nand security are combined with discussions of an\r\neconomic and social nature. Brazil favours, in that\r\nregard, a better defined partnership between the\r\nSecurity Council and the other main bodies of the\r\nUnited Nations system, so as to contemplate the\r\nspecific requirements of those situations. We call upon\r\nthe Security Council to look for greater interaction with\r\nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, as in the cases of Guinea-Bissau and Burundi,\r\nso as to favour a comprehensive and in-depth approach\r\nto the problems with which it is faced. Within the\r\nframework of a broader interpretation, making fuller\r\nuse of the provision contained in Article 65 of the\r\nCharter would be a first step in a positive direction.\r\nMr. Ashiru (Nigeria): I wish to express the\r\nappreciation of the delegation of Nigeria to the\r\nPresident of the Security Council, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the United States of America, for\r\nintroducing the report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The report of the Security Council\r\n(A/58/2) provides invaluable insights into the activities\r\nof the Council during the course of the preceding year.\r\nThe report highlights issues such as the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, disarmament and\r\ninternational humanitarian efforts. Significantly, it\r\nrepresents the efforts of the Security Council to make\r\nitself accountable to the membership of the United\r\nNations, in accordance with the provisions of Article\r\n24 of the Charter.\r\nNigeria is encouraged by the fact that the Council\r\ncontinues to respond positively to the demands of the\r\nmembership that its report should be more analytical,\r\nconcise and easy to read. We welcome the significant\r\nimprovement in the quality of the report, particularly of\r\nthe statistical information provided.\r\nThe introduction, which summarizes activities of\r\nthe Council as they relate to specific conflict areas is\r\nalso welcome, as it makes for easy reference to the\r\nspecific subject matter. We commend that improvement\r\nin the format and urge its retention.\r\nDespite its best intentions, the Security Council\r\ncontinues to be besieged with the thorny issue of\r\nconflict prevention and resolution. While the Council\r\nhas made appreciable progress in resolving some\r\nconflicts, as borne out by the number of peace\r\nagreements signed, it is our view that the Council, in\r\nconjunction with the international community, can still\r\nto do more to make the world a safer place.\r\nIn that regard, Nigeria endorses the involvement\r\nof the wider society, such as subregional and regional\r\norganizations, non-governmental organizations,\r\ninternational financial institutions and development\r\nagencies, in the process of conflict prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution. Their collective\r\ncontribution can no doubt substantially help in the\r\nreduction of socio-political and economic pressures,\r\npressures which, if not defused, often lead to violent\r\nconflicts and sometimes to war.\r\nWith respect to the situation in Sierra Leone, we\r\nnote the continued progress that has been made since\r\nthe conclusion of democratic elections in that country.\r\nWe support the Security Council’s modified withdrawal\r\nplan for the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone\r\n(UNAMSIL) and suggest that caution be used in its\r\nimplementation to ensure that the security of the\r\ncountry is not negatively affected. Nigeria supports\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1508 (2003) on Sierra\r\nLeone and calls on the Council to assist in the ongoing\r\ntask of the integration of ex-combatants.\r\nSierra Leone still needs to be assisted in the\r\ntraining of its police and army, both of which will be\r\nfully responsible for the maintenance of security in the\r\ncountry after the withdrawal of United Nations troops.\r\nThe Sierra Leone Government also needs further\r\nassistance to establish an effective civilian\r\nadministration and political institutions, particularly\r\ncourts of law, that will ensure practical implementation\r\nof the rule of law. This is necessary to ensure that the\r\ngains of the peace process are not lost.\r\nIn that connection, we observe that the Security\r\nCouncil has played a commendable role in addressing\r\ncomplex humanitarian, political and security situations\r\nin the Mano River Union States, as well as in other\r\nStates in West Africa, especially Guinea-Bissau and\r\nCôte d’Ivoire. However, in order to ensure lasting\r\npeace in the subregion, we urge the Council to come up\r\nwith a comprehensive security arrangement for the\r\nentire Mano River Union area that would address the\r\ncycle of strife, instability and conflicts.\r\nNigeria remains committed to the Security\r\nCouncil’s efforts at implementing its current mandate\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We note with\r\ndismay that despite the authorization by the Council of\r\nphase III of the deployment of the United Nations\r\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo (MONUC), the number of combatants\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\npresenting themselves for disarmament, demobilization\r\nand reintegration remains low. Progress has\r\nunfortunately been hampered by continued violence\r\nand obstructionist activity by some leaders of the\r\narmed groups. In that regard, we urge the parties to\r\ncooperate and facilitate early implementation of the\r\nSecretary-General’s recommendation on the expansion\r\nof the mandate of MONUC. We welcome Security\r\nCouncil assistance in the implementation of the\r\ndisarmament demobilization and reintegration\r\nprogramme, and urge Member States as well as troop-\r\ncontributing countries to provide the additional troops,\r\npersonnel and equipment needed to stabilize the\r\nsituation, particularly in the north-east Ituri district of\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nWe reaffirm our support and commitment to\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1484 (2003), which\r\nauthorized deployment of an Interim Emergency\r\nMultinational Force in Bunia. We note with satisfaction\r\nthat the Force made a significant contribution to\r\nstabilizing security and the humanitarian situation in\r\nBunia. Nigeria welcomes the establishment of a\r\nGovernment of national unity in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, and would urge continued\r\nnational reconciliation efforts, which, we hope, will\r\nlead to durable peace and stability.\r\nThe situation in Liberia tested and stretched the\r\nability of the international community to respond\r\nproactively to a humanitarian catastrophe. The\r\nmagnitude of the human suffering was such that\r\nNigeria could not ignore the scale of the destruction\r\nand human carnage. Nigeria’s decision to deploy its\r\ntroops in the face of obvious perils and attendant costs\r\nwas predicated on the reality of the situation in Liberia.\r\nNigeria’s offer of political asylum to former President\r\nCharles Taylor and the early deployment of its troops\r\nwere a humanitarian gesture to arrest the deteriorating\r\nsituation and facilitate the deployment of the\r\nmultinational force.\r\nIn this regard, we note that the Security Council\r\nhas remained engaged with the protracted conflict\r\nsituation in Liberia. Nigeria welcomes the adoption of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1509 (2003) establishing\r\nthe United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and\r\ncalls on the international community to support and\r\nensure the effective implementation of that resolution.\r\nWe urge the various factions in Liberia to give peace a\r\nchance, and to effect national reconciliation,\r\nreconstruction and rehabilitation of their country. The\r\npeople of Liberia deserve nothing but peace, having\r\nbeen subjected to almost 14 years of civil war.\r\nNigeria endorses the Security Council’s continued\r\nefforts to contain terrorism and urges Member States to\r\nsupport those efforts. We condemn in the strongest\r\nterms the terrorist attack on the United Nations\r\nheadquarters in Baghdad, Iraq, on 19 August 2003\r\nwhich resulted in the death of 22 people, including Mr.\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello, the High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights and Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General for Iraq. We affirm our support and\r\ncommitment to Security Council resolution 1502\r\n(2003) on the protection of civilians and the safety of\r\nUnited Nations and associated personnel, and urge\r\nstrict compliance with it. We commend the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee for effectively galvanizing an\r\ninternational coalition against international terrorism.\r\nThose efforts confirm the determination of the\r\nCouncil to live up to its Charter obligations for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nNigeria remains committed to the global effort to\r\ncombat international terrorism in all its ramifications.\r\nNigeria commends the briefings by the Security\r\nCouncil to non-members of the Council as well as the\r\nbriefings to the Chairmen of the regional groups. We\r\nnote the regularity of the meetings and consultations\r\nwith troop-contributing countries especially the system\r\nof briefing those countries before the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on a mission is presented to the\r\nCouncil.\r\nAs a major troop-contributing country, Nigeria\r\nbelieves that the continuation of this process of\r\nconsultation by the Security Council will eliminate\r\nfrictions early on and will facilitate effective\r\npeacekeeping operations in the field. Furthermore, we\r\nurge that the end-of-month wrap-up meetings of the\r\nCouncil remain as informal and interactive as possible.\r\nNigeria supports those meetings as they provide\r\nMember States the opportunity to exchange views with\r\nthe Council and enable them to benefit from lessons\r\nlearned by all sides.\r\nWe note that the Security Council undertook a\r\nnumber of ad hoc missions to conflict locations during\r\nthe period under review. Nigeria supports that strategy.\r\nWe believe that such missions will enhance the ability\r\nof the Council to properly assess situations. In that\r\nregard, Nigeria commends Council for dispatching\r\nmissions to West Africa, the Democratic Republic of\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nthe Congo and the Great Lakes region. We urge the\r\ncontinuation of that practice.\r\nNigeria reaffirms its support for thematic debates\r\nin the Council on such issues as women and peace and\r\nsecurity; children and armed conflict; and the\r\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons and\r\nmercenary activities: threats to peace and security in\r\nWest Africa. These debates have always provided\r\nopportunities for the Council and Member States to\r\nfocus on the issues in question.\r\nNotwithstanding the efforts of the Security\r\nCouncil in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, Nigeria remains committed to the reform and\r\nexpansion of the Security Council so as to make it\r\nmore responsive to contemporary global needs and\r\nchallenges.\r\nWe note with dismay that obstacles continue to be\r\nplaced against the adoption of any of the constructive\r\nproposals on the reform of the Security Council. We\r\nappreciate the changes that are being made in the\r\nCouncil’s working method in response to demands by\r\nMember States for more openness and transparency.\r\nWe consider these changes no more than marginal, and\r\ntherefore reiterate our long held conviction that what is\r\nrequired is fundamental reform and expansion of the\r\nmembership of the Council in both permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories.\r\nIt is only such reform that will reposition the\r\nSecurity Council to enable it respond to issues of\r\ninternational peace and security in a much more\r\ncomprehensive, objective and effective manner. The\r\noverwhelming membership of our organization\r\ndemands no less in the interest of its continued\r\nrelevance.\r\nFinally, Nigeria pledges its support for the efforts\r\nof the Security Council in making itself more\r\nresponsive to global challenges and meeting the\r\nyearnings of Member States, and reiterates our\r\ndetermination to encourage the Council as it continues\r\nto improve its work methods and discharge its\r\nresponsibility justly in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security and in accordance with the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): I would\r\nlike to thank Ambassador John Negroponte, the\r\nPermanent Representative of the United States and\r\ncurrent president of the Security Council for the month\r\nof October, for his comprehensive introduction of the\r\nannual report of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nAn analysis of the Charter proves how much\r\nexercise by the Security Council of its primary\r\nresponsibility is linked to the consideration of its report\r\nby the General Assembly. Article 24, paragraph 3, of\r\nthe United Nations Charter requires the Security\r\nCouncil to submit to the General Assembly an annual\r\nreport on its work.\r\nThe presentation of the annual report of the\r\nCouncil to the Assembly creates rules that govern the\r\nrelationship between the two principal organs of the\r\nUnited Nations. Consideration of this item always\r\nprovides, we feel, an ideal opportunity for an exchange\r\nof views on how to improve the working methods of\r\nthe Council to make them more transparent and how to\r\nlimit the secrecy of this important organ.\r\nThe exercise we are involved in today should\r\nprovide a valuable opportunity for our Assembly to\r\nconsider in depth the activities of the Council and to\r\nidentify measures that should be taken to make the\r\nnecessary improvements.\r\nFurthermore, this return to the previous practice\r\nof having two separate discussions on the two priority\r\nissues of the General Assembly, the annual report of\r\nthe Security Council and the reform of that body,\r\nseems more appropriate to me. The first experiment of\r\nlast year, whereby we merged these two items, showed\r\nits limitations as far as providing an opportunity to\r\nMember States to properly examine in a more detailed\r\nfashion these two items.\r\nMy delegation continues to welcome the\r\ninclusion, for the second time in the report, of a brief\r\nanalytical summary. This analytical part provides\r\nindicators of achievement of the work done by the\r\nCouncil and should be supplemented by proposals or\r\nrecommendations about how to improve its work.\r\nThis chapter of the report should not be limited to\r\nwhat has been done by the Council. It would be more\r\nuseful to reflect in an objective manner on its failures\r\nand the reasons for those failures.\r\nOnly by making available to Member States a\r\nvery useful, full and substantive document could they\r\nthen be able to assess in depth the work of the Council.\r\nIt is a matter of the Council’s credibility that its\r\ninternal rules of procedure are still provisional, 58\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nyears after the creation of that body. The provisional\r\nrules have sometimes led to undesirable practices in the\r\nconduct of public meetings. In this respect I refer to the\r\nopen debate that took place last month on the Middle\r\nEast, during which States were confined to three\r\nminutes per delegation to express their views on a\r\nquestion as complex as the question of the Middle East.\r\nAny change to the rules adopted by the Council or to\r\nits practices should be stipulated in the rules of\r\nprocedure.\r\nOn the other hand, we note a positive change with\r\nregard to the increase in the number of public meetings\r\nduring the reporting period, providing an opportunity\r\nto non-members to state their views on items before the\r\nCouncil. However, the private informal consultations\r\nthat are not covered by the provisional rules of\r\nprocedure have become the norm, rather than the\r\nexception.\r\nGiven this situation, my delegation continues to\r\nbelieve that it would be wise for consultations\r\nfollowing the open meetings to be open regularly to\r\nparties interested or concerned by the question under\r\ndiscussion in order to seek their views, which would\r\nenable the Council to have a better understanding of\r\nthese subjects and hence, would help the Council to\r\ntake decisions more advisedly.\r\nOn the other hand, we note with concern that\r\nmost of the briefings by the Secretariat and by\r\nrepresentatives of the Secretary-General for various\r\nconflicts, take place in private, not in open meetings,\r\neven though this information is also useful for non-\r\nmember States of the Council who should also then\r\nhave the opportunity to give their views on these\r\nconflicts in question.\r\nThe Security Council’s wrap-up sessions are an\r\ninnovation to be encouraged. These meetings, during\r\nwhich there is an interactive dialogue between\r\nmembers and non-members of the Council, are proof of\r\nthe need for greater openness. These meetings have\r\nproven their usefulness and validity and should be\r\ninstitutionalized and held regularly.\r\nAnother aspect my delegation wanted to touch on\r\nhas to do with consultations among members of the\r\nCouncil. It is disquieting to note that at a time when the\r\nCouncil, in a spirit of openness, is increasing the\r\nnumber of open debates, the ten non-permanent\r\nmembers are not fully involved in the process of\r\nconsultation when it comes to delicate questions.\r\nOn substance we must recognize that the\r\nreporting period has been an extraordinary period for\r\nthe Council in many respects and that it has been\r\nextremely active during this period. The Council has\r\nhad some successes and some failures. First, we note\r\nthe outstanding achievements of the Council in\r\ncombating terrorism, particularly the adoption of\r\nresolutions 1455 and 1456 of 2003, strengthening the\r\nmandate of the Counter-Terrorism Committee and\r\nputting an end to the financing of and support for\r\nterrorism.\r\nWe also should take note of progress made with\r\nregard to a number of peacekeeping operations and of\r\nthe support the Council has continued to give them,\r\nparticularly in Africa. Thanks to the Council’s\r\ncommitment, positive changes have occurred in areas\r\nof conflict in Africa. Security Council missions to\r\nseveral areas of conflict have had a positive impact on\r\nthe local protagonists.\r\nIn light of these good experiences, we encourage\r\nthis kind of initiative and action and call for their\r\nformalization and their expansion to other areas of\r\nconflict. But the Council’s contribution is far from\r\nmeeting the aspirations of African countries. We think\r\nthe Council should take the opportunity to act and\r\nprovide useful support for the African Union and its\r\nmechanisms, to make it possible to attain the results\r\nhoped for in conflict settlement.\r\nOn the other hand, on the subject of the Middle\r\nEast, the Council has fallen well short of the\r\nexpectations placed in it. It has been prevented, thus\r\nfar, from playing its rightful role here. The monthly\r\nbriefing by the Secretariat and the holding of several\r\nopen debates on occupied Palestine have unfortunately\r\nnot had an impact on the situation on the ground.\r\nEither Israel has continued to flout the Council’s\r\nresolutions or, more often than not, the Council has\r\nbeen unable to do anything because it has been blocked\r\nby the anachronistic privilege of the veto.\r\nWe are convinced that if the Council had\r\napproved the establishment of a United Nations or\r\ninternational presence in the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritories, the violence we are witnessing today would\r\nhave been largely avoided or lessened and the situation\r\ntoday would without doubt be more conducive to a\r\nnegotiated settlement.\r\nThe other Arab question confronting the Council\r\nis the question of Iraq. In addressing that issue, the\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nCouncil is going through the most crucial period in its\r\nhistory. The Council should act immediately to put an\r\nend to the suffering of the Iraqi people, whose situation\r\ncontinues to be most tragic. The Council should enable\r\nthe United Nations to play the central role incumbent\r\nupon it and should enable the Iraqi people to regain the\r\nfull exercise of their sovereignty as soon as possible.\r\nIndeed, as President Bouteflika said on 24\r\nSeptember 2003 during his address to the General\r\nAssembly (see A/58/PV.9), only the United Nations can\r\nlegitimately and effectively accompany the institution-\r\nbuilding and reconstruction of the country, and its role\r\nin these processes is of paramount importance.\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): The report of the Security\r\nCouncil which is before us (A/58/2) is a bulky\r\ndocument of 221 pages, the real substance of which is\r\ncontained in the introductory section of 14 pages,\r\ncontaining a descriptive account of the Council’s\r\nactivities, with the rest of the document consisting of\r\ndocumentary information and references. We would\r\nhave benefited more from substance and analysis. The\r\nperiod covered was one of intense activity as the\r\nCouncil held more than 200 formal meetings along\r\nwith numerous informal meetings and consultations.\r\nThe dominant issue in the Council’s activity\r\nrelated to the disarmament of Iraq. It formed part of the\r\ndramatic events which captured world attention amid\r\ncontroversy and debate on the role of the United\r\nNations. As a result of profound divisions, the Council\r\nwas unable to control or determine the course of events\r\nfollowing the decision taken by a coalition of States to\r\ntake military action without authorization by the\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe record of the Security Council in that process\r\nhad some positive elements as, in some ways, members\r\nsought to exercise their responsibility with due regard\r\nfor the principles of the Charter. Political\r\ncircumstances created a difficult time for the Council,\r\nwhich is still grappling with the complications flowing\r\nfrom the unfolding events.\r\nThe other area of concentrated effort was Africa\r\nwhere there were some positive indications of the\r\nCouncil’s effectiveness in dealing with particular areas\r\nof conflict. We note the improving situation in Sierra\r\nLeone and Angola and intervention with respect to the\r\nconflicts in Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia and the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo. There are concerns with the\r\nlevel and urgency of the Council’s response to\r\ndevelopments in both Liberia and the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, which was hesitant and tardy.\r\nIn Liberia, the slowness to engage may have caused a\r\nworsening of the humanitarian situation up to the time\r\nof the deployment of the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) vanguard force.\r\nIn general, we believe that the Council’s\r\nengagement in Africa could have been fortified by a\r\ngreater sense of urgency and a larger commitment of\r\nresources in terms of manpower and economic\r\nassistance to provide for security and stability in a\r\nsituation where there had been so much disruption and\r\nhumanitarian need.\r\nWith regard to the situation in the Middle East,\r\nwhich has been a continued source of anxiety and\r\nfrustration, the year carried us through a familiar\r\npattern of hope and despair. The road map was\r\nheralded as opening the way for peace, but that process\r\nhas been unravelling. The role being played by the\r\nSecurity Council appears to be uncertain and tentative.\r\nThe United Nations is declared as being a party to\r\nthe Quartet, under whose sponsorship the road map\r\nwas launched. But it is not clear to some of us what is\r\nthe agency through which the United Nations is\r\nrepresented in this process. There does not appear to be\r\nany active role being performed by the Organization in\r\nterms of the formulation of the plan or in the\r\nmonitoring and strategy of implementation. The United\r\nNations appears to be only a nominal partner or a\r\nbystander, since there is little evidence that the\r\nSecurity Council has been significantly engaged. The\r\nreport merely indicates that the Council followed the\r\nwork of the Quartet and reiterated support for the road\r\nmap and the Quartet’s efforts.\r\nWe also note that the Council continued to engage\r\nin holding debates on thematic issues, though there\r\nseems to be a lessening of that activity. In our view,\r\nsuch debates are an unnecessary addition to the work of\r\nthe Council. Besides, the practice gives us increasing\r\nconcern with respect to duplication and encroachment\r\non subject matters which are more appropriately\r\nhandled by the General Assembly. We would\r\nrecommend that in order to respect the different\r\ncompetencies of the various organs, the practice of\r\nholding debates on thematic questions should be\r\nreviewed and possibly discontinued.\r\nWith regard to the operations of the Council, we\r\nwould wish to make two observations. The first is that\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nthere is continued concern about transparency and a\r\nfailure to give due attention to the views of the wider\r\nmembership expressed in the debates before the\r\nCouncil. When decisions are taken before a debate is\r\nheld and when non-members are heard after Council\r\nmembers have spoken, the contribution of non-\r\nmembers cannot be really effective. We believe that it\r\nis incumbent on the Council in its decision-making, to\r\ntake account of the views of interested parties and of\r\nthe wider membership. That is a serious obligation on\r\nthe Council, as it acts on behalf of the membership to\r\nsafeguard international peace and security.\r\nThe second point relates to the tendency for\r\ndecision-making to be concentrated among the\r\npermanent members and to the limited role assigned to\r\nthe elected members of the body. We continue to feel\r\nconcerned at this trend of a growing concentration of\r\npower in decision-making. We understand the realities\r\nof power, but the fact is that an undemocratic process is\r\nundermining the legitimacy of the Council’s decisions\r\nand the authority of Council action.\r\nUnder Article 24 of the Charter, the Security\r\nCouncil acts on behalf of the international community\r\nand is therefore accountable to the General Assembly.\r\nAccordingly, we believe it is important that the\r\nSecurity Council be formally informed of the views,\r\nobservations and recommendations of the General\r\nAssembly in relation to its report. As a follow-up to the\r\npresent debate, we would suggest that a special\r\nmeeting of the Security Council be held to hear the\r\nresponse of the General Assembly, either through a\r\nstatement made by the President of the Assembly\r\nsummarizing the debate or alternately through the\r\nadoption of a formal document by the General\r\nAssembly for presentation to the Council.\r\nAccountability should thus be formally acknowledged\r\nin order that the General Assembly can carry out its\r\nrole envisaged in the Charter as a principal organ of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWith regard to reform of the Security Council, we\r\nregret the lack of progress. We continue to underscore\r\nthe importance of enlarging the composition of the\r\nSecurity Council to make it more representative, and of\r\nreforming its decision-making procedures to conform\r\nto the principle of the sovereign equality of States. The\r\nsituation cannot continue to be left in abeyance because\r\nof a failure to find consensus. Some new initiative\r\nshould be undertaken, utilizing a democratic procedure\r\nto move the process forward.\r\nJamaica places its trust in you, Mr. President,\r\nhaving regard to the sense of commitment that you\r\nhave demonstrated for the strengthening of the United\r\nNations system. Your political experience and skill are\r\nour greatest assets for progress during this Assembly\r\nsession. We need to show some positive results from\r\nthe years of meetings, consultations, discussions and\r\nnegotiations. To succeed, we will need the full support\r\nand contribution of all Members of the Organization.\r\nYou can be assured, Sir, that Jamaica will do its part.\r\nMr. Spatafora (Italy): First of all, I would like to\r\nthank the current President of the Security Council,\r\nAmbassador Negroponte, for his presentation of the\r\nreport of the Council (A/58/2), which contains valuable\r\ninformation with which we can assess the Council’s\r\nwork over the 12-month reporting period, a period that\r\nhas been particularly challenging in terms of its role of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security.\r\nThe report highlights the broadening scope of\r\nresponsibilities that the Security Council assumed on\r\nvarious fronts simultaneously, from regional crises to\r\ncounter-terrorism, from the proliferation of small arms\r\nto the peaceful settlement of disputes and other\r\nthematic issues. We take note of the efforts that\r\nmembers of the Security Council, in fulfilling their\r\nresponsibilities, have dedicated to improving the\r\ntransparency, openness and inclusiveness — outreach\r\nto non-members — of their working methods. Here, I\r\nwould like to recall the meaningful remarks made by\r\nsome of my colleagues; here, I would mention the\r\nrepresentatives of Jamaica, Japan, Brazil and Algeria.\r\nWe fully agree with those remarks.\r\nFurther progress could be made in that direction.\r\nIndeed, transparency continues to be an important\r\nmeans by which non-members of the Council can not\r\nonly be informed about the state of deliberations inside\r\nthe Security Council, but also communicate their views\r\nand positions on specific issues. Another area where\r\ncontinued progress should be made is in the interaction\r\nbetween Security Council members and non-members\r\nwhose interests are specially affected, as provided for\r\nin Article 31 of the Charter.\r\nLast year the Secretary-General recommended, in\r\nhis report “Strengthening of the United Nations: an\r\nagenda for further change” (A/57/387), that the\r\nSecurity Council consider codifying recent changes in\r\nits practice. We renew our support for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call.\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nGreater participation of non-members on issues\r\nsuch as conflict prevention, peacekeeping and\r\ntransition to post-conflict peace-building could bring\r\nsubstantial value to Security Council decision-making\r\nand could help mobilize the active support of the\r\ninternational community. An enhanced dialogue with\r\nnon-members could contribute to forging more\r\neffective and coherent global policies to address many\r\npressing crises that confront us today. Promotion of the\r\nrule of law, protection of civilians in armed conflicts\r\nand gender mainstreaming in peace operations are\r\nfurther areas where interaction with the broader\r\nmembership could be useful to the definition of\r\nSecurity Council lines of action. A framework for\r\ncooperation with troop-contributing countries has been\r\nestablished. There is still unexploited potential. Similar\r\nflexible mechanisms, based on transparency and\r\ndialogue, could be developed with regard to other\r\ncomponents of Security Council activity, for example\r\nthe management of special political missions.\r\nThe Security Council could further develop its\r\nrelations and consultations with regional organizations,\r\nparticularly those that have developed crisis-\r\nmanagement capacities to such a level that they can\r\neffectively contribute to the collective action of the\r\ninternational community. The Council could thus avail\r\nitself more frequently of the views of those regional\r\norganizations, since they are often equipped with\r\nsignificant political and financial resources, and better\r\nable to mobilize the will of the main regional actors.\r\nThe same applies to implementation of sanctions,\r\nwhere close cooperation between regional\r\norganizations and sanctions committees or monitoring\r\ngroups can yield satisfactory results.\r\nItaly supports the continuing efforts by sanctions\r\ncommittees to improve their working methods, thus\r\nincreasing transparency and effective fulfilment of\r\ntheir mandates.\r\nThis rare opportunity for dialogue and interaction\r\nbetween two main organs of the United Nations,\r\npursuant to Article 15 of the Charter, should not be\r\nmerely ritualistic. It is our hope that it will induce\r\nspecific, constructive proposals to improve the capacity\r\nof the Security Council to effectively and collectively\r\nface new global challenges and emerging threats to\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIn the context of United Nations reform, it is\r\nimportant to forge stronger interactive links among the\r\nSecurity Council, the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, so that their partnerships\r\nbecome more operational and effective which would\r\nstrengthen the coherence of the United Nations system.\r\nFurthermore, better structural dialogue with United\r\nNations agencies, funds and programmes could help in\r\ndefining more credible mandates during crisis\r\nmanagement, exit strategies and transition to peace-\r\nbuilding. We should seize this moment to reform the\r\npractices of the Security Council and move the\r\ndialogue forward.\r\nMr. Fadaifard (Islamic Republic of Iran): I wish\r\nto begin by thanking His Excellency Mr. John\r\nNegroponte, the President of the Security Council, for\r\nintroducing the report of the Council (A/58/2) to the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe attach great importance to the agenda item\r\nunder consideration. What we are considering is the\r\nannual report by the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly on the way the Council conducts its work,\r\nwhich constitutes the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security on behalf of the full membership of\r\nthe United Nations. The submission of the annual\r\nreport as stipulated by the Charter is the constitutional\r\nlink which establishes accountability between two\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations. In other words,\r\nthe annual report represents an effort by the Council to\r\nlive up to the expectations of the membership and to be\r\naccountable for its work to that membership, from\r\nwhich it receives its powers.\r\nAs to the content and structure of the report\r\nbefore us, we note that it has been prepared in line with\r\nthe revised format agreed upon by the Security Council\r\nin 2002. It provides a guide to the activities of the\r\nCouncil in a concise manner. This is the second such\r\nreport prepared in this way. Here, the Council aimed to\r\nenhance the quality of the report and to accommodate\r\nthe views expressed on the previous format.\r\nIt is noticeable that the report is more\r\nstreamlined, better focused, concise and shorter,\r\navoiding overlapping and repetition and thereby also\r\nreducing the cost of its production. Thus, we believe\r\nthat, to some extent, the present report has rectified a\r\ndefect in the way the Council previously reported to\r\nthe Assembly. While it is dramatically reduced in size,\r\nat the same time, it provides more statistical\r\ninformation on the Council’s activities.\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nThe most important innovation introduced to last\r\nyear’s report is also present in this year’s report. The\r\nintroduction of the current report highlights continued\r\neffort by the Council to present an analytical summary\r\nof its work for the period covered by the report, which\r\nrepresents an effort to address the main criticism\r\nrepeated year after year in past General Assembly\r\ndebates on the Council’s report. While it is,\r\nundoubtedly, an improvement over preceding reports,\r\nwe believe, however, that there is still room for\r\nimproving the introduction by making it more\r\nanalytical and less descriptive, and by providing\r\ninformation about informal consultations and rationales\r\nbehind the decisions made by the Council.\r\nThe report is indicative of the large number of\r\nopen meetings of the Council held in the period under\r\nreview. The holding of 207 open meetings is significant\r\nand is one of the highest in the Council’s history. That\r\nis partly because of the Council’s crowded agenda last\r\nyear and partly due to increased efforts in the area of\r\ntransparency and openness in the work of the Council\r\nand its relationship with the wider United Nations\r\nmembership. As a result, non-members of the Council\r\nhad greater opportunity to participate in its work. It is\r\nimportant that the Council build upon this achievement\r\nand enhance links between the members of the Council\r\nand the Members of the General Assembly.\r\nWhile the working methods of the Council were\r\nalso improved over previous years, mainly as a result\r\nof ideas expressed and progress made in the course of\r\nthe deliberations of the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nSecurity Council Reform, it is noticeable, however,\r\nthat, especially with regard to certain sensitive issues,\r\nthe five permanent members are increasingly acquiring\r\nspecial privileges in considering and informally\r\ncoordinating among themselves in a format where the\r\nelected members are absent.\r\nIt is unfortunate that last year, like preceding\r\nyears, the number of issues on which the permanent\r\nfive resorted to exclusive deliberations and embarked\r\non a decision-making process of their own was on the\r\nrise. It is an unacceptable procedure, which is in\r\ncontrast to the trend towards more transparency and\r\ndemocratization of the Council. That procedure, if\r\nunchecked, will prevent the elected members from\r\nfully participating in the work of the Council, thereby\r\nundermining further the legitimacy and the authority of\r\nits decisions.\r\nMoreover, we notice a trend towards a more\r\ncomplicated decision-making process in the Council.\r\nThe number of subsidiary organs of the Security\r\nCouncil is on the rise. Committees, monitoring groups\r\nand the like are proliferating and playing an\r\nincreasingly important role in the work of the Council,\r\nin its decision-making or in the implementation of its\r\ndecisions. It is very important that these subsidiary\r\norgans of the Council work in a way in which the\r\ngeneral membership of the United Nations can receive\r\nadequate information on their role and functions.\r\nWhile considering the functioning of the Security\r\nCouncil over past years, we cannot refrain from\r\nexpressing our frustration at the Council’s inability to\r\naddress effectively the Palestinian question, which is\r\none of the grave ongoing crises threatening peace and\r\nsecurity in the sensitive region of the Middle East. It is\r\nappropriate and useful that, in the past year, the\r\nCouncil could convene monthly meetings at which\r\nmembers received briefings from the representative of\r\nthe Secretary-General or high-ranking Secretariat\r\nofficials. Undoubtedly, those meetings had an\r\ninformative effect and helped the Council not to lose\r\nsight of the difficult situation in the Middle East.\r\nWhile we hope that the monthly briefings\r\ncontinue this year, we hardly find it effective in\r\nmeeting the responsibility shouldered by the Council.\r\nWe acknowledge that the recourse to veto power\r\nseveral times in the past two years alone is responsible\r\nfor the Council’s paralysis in this area.\r\nUndoubtedly, world public opinion has noted the\r\ndouble standard with which the Council treated, in the\r\nlast year, the Iraqi question, on the one hand, and the\r\nPalestinian question, on the other. There should be no\r\ndoubt that, in continuing to work that way, the Council\r\ndoes not contribute to its legitimacy and authority in\r\nthe eyes of the general membership and of world public\r\nopinion.\r\nMr. De Rivero (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I wish\r\nto thank the Permanent Representative of the United\r\nStates, the current President of the Security Council,\r\nfor introducing the annual report of the Council\r\ncovering the period from 1 August 2002 to 31 July\r\n2003 (A/58/2).\r\nIn the past few months, we have witnessed an\r\nintense international debate on the role of the United\r\nNations, particularly of the Security Council. In many\r\ncases, during these debates, the ability of the United\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nNations and the Security Council to act and to make\r\ndecisions have been called into question and their\r\nfuture considered uncertain. In those circumstances, as\r\nPresident of the Rio Group, I felt that it was\r\nappropriate to invite to our Group the well-known\r\nacademic, Mr. Paul Kennedy, Professor of History and\r\nDirector of the Centre of International Security Studies\r\nat Yale University, to have a dialogue with the\r\nAmbassadors of the Rio Group on challenges to\r\ninternational security and on the future of the United\r\nNations.\r\nDuring our dialogue with Professor Kennedy, we\r\ndrew the conclusion that global challenges such as\r\nterrorism, poverty, migration, drug trafficking,\r\ntrafficking in people and weapons and increasing\r\necological deterioration are affecting the stability of all\r\nour societies, irrespective of borders. That is affecting\r\ninternational peace and security. We also agreed that\r\ntoday all these challenges form a complex\r\ninterdependency, and therefore they cannot be\r\naddressed in a unilateral or isolated way, and much less\r\nthrough a purely military approach. Quite to the\r\ncontrary, those challenges should be faced with a\r\ncommon strategy on the part of all of our countries. In\r\nother words, they cannot be overcome without\r\nmultilateralism. That was also the conclusion reached\r\nby Harvard professors Joseph Nye and Samuel\r\nHuntington in recently published essays.\r\nLastly, it is becoming increasingly clear in world\r\npublic opinion, the academic world and the diplomatic\r\nsphere that, given the current international situation,\r\nthe United Nations is today the indispensable\r\norganization to overcome the challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. A realistic collective security policy on\r\nthe part of the Security Council will be the most\r\nappropriate way to overcome many of those challenges.\r\nNevertheless, we believe that the functions of the\r\nSecurity Council must be improved. Peru therefore\r\nsupports a reform of the Security Council that makes it\r\na more representative body and improves its decision-\r\nmaking process and working methods, so that it may\r\neffectively assume its responsibilities in the face of the\r\nchallenges to international peace and security in the\r\ntwenty-first century. But before any reform is carried\r\nout, it is imperative to ensure the fulfilment of the\r\nCouncil’s resolutions and decisions so as to avoid\r\nlosing credibility for that body in international public\r\nopinion, and consequently in the United Nations.\r\nAdequate cooperation between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council is important to\r\nstrengthening the United Nations. For example, the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s adoption of a resolution on the\r\nprevention of conflict is an example of that body’s\r\nability to contribute to the consideration of issues\r\nlinked to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, which falls under the purview of the Security\r\nCouncil. That resolution encourages the Security\r\nCouncil to use appropriate mechanisms to contribute to\r\nthe effective prevention of conflict.\r\nWe can also count on another resolution of the\r\nGeneral Assembly that recognizes the importance of\r\nfacing up to socio-economic aspects that could\r\nexacerbate civil conflicts. It also calls for the adoption\r\nof measures to promote sustainable development and\r\nthe fight against poverty. The Security Council should\r\nin turn support such preventive efforts by the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nAnother step by the General Assembly that\r\ncontributes to strengthening the credibility of the\r\nSecurity Council is the President’s power, established\r\nin resolution 51/241, to carry out a closer examination\r\nof the Security Council’s report. That power has not\r\nbeen exercised, largely owing to the sterility and lack\r\nof clarity that continues to characterize the report of\r\nthe Security Council we are considering today.\r\nMy country has previously drawn attention to the\r\nfact that there is a need for the report of the Security\r\nCouncil to be transparent, based on the current\r\ninternational situation, and comprised of more\r\nanalytical and political content. Its conclusion should\r\nnot be limited solely to a list of documents; it should,\r\namong other things, include an accounting of the\r\nvetoes exercised and the arguments employed in doing\r\nso, a list of Security Council resolutions yet to be\r\nimplemented and, lastly, a factual summary of the host\r\nof valuable ideas contained in the main proposals\r\nrelating to each one the topics of the Council’s agenda\r\nput forth by countries in the open meetings of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn connection with the report of the Security\r\nCouncil, a student of international relations desiring to\r\nglean a comprehensive perspective on international\r\nsecurity today from the report of the Security Council,\r\nthe main body entrusted with maintaining that security,\r\nwould become lost in the endless lists of documents\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nand almost cryptic jargon that is understood only by\r\ninitiates such as us.\r\nIn the globalized world, where information and\r\ntransparency are the guarantee of democracy and truth,\r\nthe intense work and primary activities carried out by\r\nthe Security Council are, unfortunately, not clearly set\r\nforth. In that regard, the Security Council — the main\r\ninstrument of international security — like other\r\ninternational organizations and bodies, runs the risk of\r\nbecoming, through its reports, an entity removed from\r\nworld public opinion that has no real meaning and that\r\ndoes not convey anything to the international\r\ncommunity. It also runs the risk of being forgotten,\r\npassed over by other organizations that better\r\ncommunicate their performance.\r\nMy country makes those comments because it\r\nsupports the work of the Security Council and wants to\r\nsee it become more efficient and successful, as well as\r\nmore open to cooperation, understanding and\r\ntransparency vis-à-vis the international community.\r\nMy country would like to conclude by\r\nhighlighting the efforts made to produce greater\r\ntransparency in the Security Council — especially the\r\nsignificant number of open meetings that have been\r\nheld, both thematic debates and meetings at which the\r\nSecretariat introduced reports on various subjects on\r\nthe Council’s agenda. Peru supports the continuation of\r\nsuch meetings, as well as of wrap-up meetings, which\r\nprovide an opportunity for all interested States to\r\nparticipate in the establishment and strengthening of\r\nrealistic collective security by the United Nations,\r\nwhich is a common responsibility of all of us.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nUndoubtedly, the report of the Security Council\r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly at the current\r\nsession reflects the number of challenges that arose\r\nduring the period that it covers. Although a number of\r\nevents and developments tested the Council’s unity,\r\neffectiveness and credibility, other issues underscored\r\nits relevance as an important tool for dealing with\r\ninternational peace and security whenever permanent\r\nand non-permanent members of the Council could\r\nmuster the necessary political will, sound vision,\r\nobjectivity and transparency to address those pivotal\r\nissues.\r\nIn that context, we find that events in the period\r\ncovered by the report pointed to the Council’s role in\r\naddressing several central issues affecting the evolution\r\nof the concept of international peace and security at\r\nthis critical stage in the history of international\r\nrelations, issues such as international terrorism, the\r\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons,\r\nmercenarism, the role of regional organizations in\r\npeace and security issues, the Council’s function in the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and the role of the\r\nillicit diamond trade in fuelling conflicts. We hope that\r\nthe Council’s plenary debates on those issues will\r\nreflect a clearer vision and understanding of the\r\nchallenges and threats facing the international\r\ncommunity in terms of maintaining international peace\r\nand security. Moreover, we hope that next year there\r\nwill be more interaction and dialogue between the\r\nSecurity Council and the wider United Nations\r\nmembership on those and other issues.\r\nThe delegation of Egypt would like to express its\r\nappreciation to the Security Council for convening a\r\nseries of special meetings with States that contribute\r\ntroops to United Nations peacekeeping missions. That\r\nis the kind of dialogue and interaction needed to\r\nenhance such missions and to ensure their success. In\r\nour view, it is essential that in the coming period the\r\nSecurity Council continue to hold more such meetings\r\nin order to broaden and enrich the Council’s\r\nperspective in addressing peace and security issues and\r\nto foster a concept of partnership among its members\r\nand all other concerned parties and actors, so as to\r\nform a collective international view regarding those\r\nissues. Here, I should like to stress the need to provide\r\nan opportunity for all non-members of the Council to\r\nexercise their right to fully express their views on all\r\nissues considered by the Council, without any attempt\r\non the part of some parties in the Council to jeopardize\r\nthat right based on non-compelling procedural or\r\nsubstantive pretexts.\r\nThe report of the Security Council shows that the\r\nbulk of the international peace and security issues\r\nbefore it continue to relate to Africa. Obviously,\r\nAfrican issues and conflicts have created new kinds of\r\nchallenges that require the United Nations to develop\r\nnew ways to deal with them. In that regard, we\r\nwelcome the trends in the past year towards the\r\ndevelopment of cooperation between the Council and\r\ninternational actors and African regional organizations\r\nin the fields of peacekeeping and conflict settlement on\r\nthe continent. We also welcome the willingness to take\r\na regional approach in dealing with the causes and\r\nparameters of African conflicts by dispatching Council\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nmissions to Central and West Africa. We highlight the\r\nneed to expand those trends and to consider ways and\r\nmeans of increasing their effectiveness.\r\nHowever, we express concern at the Council’s\r\nlimited ability to respond expeditiously and effectively\r\nto the serious humanitarian and security crises faced by\r\nAfrican nations and regions in the past year. That\r\nlimited ability is reflected clearly in the reports and\r\nstatistical data available to the United Nations and to\r\ninternational relief agencies with regard to the number\r\nof casualties, internally displaced persons and refugees\r\ncaused by African conflicts. We observed the Council’s\r\nreluctance for several months to deal with the grave\r\nmassacres in the eastern and north-eastern Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo until the forces and the mandate\r\nof the United Nations mission there were expanded to\r\nenhance the peace process and reconciliation. Also, we\r\nsaw a similar Council reluctance to approve a\r\nmultinational force in Liberia before a peacekeeping\r\nmission was mandated and deployed there. In addition,\r\nwe find that the Council continues to face serious\r\nproblems in dealing with issues in African post-conflict\r\nsituations because of the required measures and efforts\r\nfor those situations that transcend the limited\r\ntraditional concept of security and peace.\r\nThe concept of peace and security has expanded\r\nto include economic, social, humanitarian and\r\ngeographic dimensions that cannot be fragmented or\r\naddressed in isolation from the others. Hence, the\r\nSecurity Council is duty-bound to carry out its primary\r\nresponsibility for maintaining and consolidating peace\r\nin post-conflict countries by coordinating and\r\ncooperating with the regional organizations concerned\r\nand with all other relevant United Nations organs and\r\nprogrammes — particularly the General Assembly and\r\nits Committees and the Economic and Social Council,\r\nsince those two organs are the appropriate legislative\r\nmechanisms for developing a conceptual framework\r\nfor peace-building in the fullest sense of the word. The\r\ndelegation of Egypt believes that the reform process\r\ncalled for by the Secretary-General in his statement\r\nbefore the Assembly on 23 September 2003 must also\r\ninclude ways and means that will enable the Security\r\nCouncil to respond rapidly, with a more comprehensive\r\nvision, in order to meet the ever-increasing challenges\r\nto the maintenance and building of peace and security.\r\nMr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation will refer jointly to two important agenda\r\nitems: the report of the Security Council and the\r\nquestion of Council representation.\r\nSpain began its two-year term as a member of the\r\nSecurity Council on 1 January. During these almost 10\r\nmonths on the Council, we have contributed to\r\nmaintaining, and, where possible, to enhancing\r\ntransparency in the Council’s working methods.\r\nMay I mention just two examples. During Spain’s\r\npresidency, there were a total of 17 open meetings,\r\nincluding formal meetings and open briefings — in\r\nother words, more than the number of informal\r\nconsultations. Secondly, Spain drafted, together with\r\nthe United Kingdom, the introduction to the report that\r\nis before us today. It did so with the objective of\r\nmaking it more accessible to all Members of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe believe that considerable progress has been\r\nmade in the area of Security Council transparency in\r\nrecent years, but we must not be complacent, and we\r\nmust continue to make progress in this direction.\r\nWe believe that it is a mistake to take an approach\r\nto Council reform that focuses exclusively on the\r\nconcept of expansion. Reform is an all-inclusive\r\nsubject in which at least three elements converge:\r\ncomposition, working methods and decision-making.\r\nWe have already referred to the question of\r\nworking methods. As for the question of composition,\r\nmost Member States believe that the Council, in an\r\nOrganization that now has 191 Members, should be\r\nmore representative — in other words, that it would\r\nhave to be expanded.\r\nNonetheless, there are well-founded doubts about\r\nwhether expansion would make the Council perform\r\nbetter. As was stated here in the General Assembly\r\nsome days ago by the President of the Government of\r\nSpain, an increase in the number of Security Council\r\nmembers will not necessarily mean an increase in the\r\nCouncil’s effectiveness.\r\nSetting aside for the moment this question of\r\nexpansion versus effectiveness, which is no trivial\r\nmatter, let me say that my country believes it is\r\nobvious that the Council can be more representative\r\nonly if we increase only the number of its elected\r\nmembers. Increasing the number of permanent\r\nmembers — in other words, swelling the ranks of those\r\nwho have privileges under the Charter and including in\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nthe United Nations aristocracy another handful of\r\ncountries — would seem to us to be counterproductive.\r\nThe existence of the veto — that totally anti-\r\ndemocratic instrument of immense power — has been\r\nthe subject of frequent complaints ever since the birth\r\nof our Organization. Is it conceivable that we should\r\nwant, in 2003, to create a new category of the\r\npowerful? If the veto is indeed completely and\r\nintrinsically anti-democratic, should we give it to new\r\npermanent members?\r\nThis brings me to the question of decision-\r\nmaking. The process should reflect a greater balance\r\nbetween two essential elements: democracy and\r\neffectiveness. Here again the question of the veto\r\narises. In these 10 months of our term on the Council,\r\nwe have experienced situations involving vetoes and\r\nthreats of vetoes — the so-called hidden veto. Those\r\ninstances of vetoes used or suggested have hardly been\r\nto the satisfaction of the majority of Member States,\r\nand they have illustrated time and again the unusual\r\npower enjoyed by the permanent members, as well as\r\nthe abyss of power that separates the permanent from\r\nthe non-permanent members. Let us not give this elitist\r\nattribute to others.\r\nWe also see that the majority of Member States\r\nhave called for greater democratization in the decision-\r\nmaking process, which is generally understood as\r\nmeaning a reform of the veto through a reduction in the\r\nnumber of potential cases in which it can be applied.\r\nWe believe, for example, that the exercise of the veto\r\nshould be limited to Chapter VII cases. Furthermore,\r\nwe would have to devise formulas that would prevent\r\nits use in cases of massive violations of human rights.\r\nBut let us have no illusions. This wish of the\r\noverwhelming majority for reform can become a reality\r\nonly through the will of those that today possess this\r\nprivilege. Given past experience and Article 108,\r\nunfortunately, this wish on the part of the majority is\r\nnothing but a dream. Only a balance among the\r\ndifferent elements involved in reform can lead to a\r\nSecurity Council that is — as the representative of Italy\r\nsaid on behalf of the European Union in his statement\r\nbefore the Assembly — more representative, more\r\neffective and more democratic.\r\nWe know that this may be only a dream — but it\r\nis a wish that must be expressed.\r\nMr. Rastam (Malaysia): My delegation\r\nwelcomes this opportunity to consider the report of the\r\nSecurity Council. We join others in thanking\r\nAmbassador John Negroponte, President of the\r\nSecurity Council for the month of October, for\r\nintroducing the annual report of the Council to the\r\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We\r\nconsider the annual reporting process by the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly to be an important\r\nstep. It is important not only with respect to the\r\nfulfilment of the provisions of the relevant articles of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, but also as a way of\r\nmaintaining the relationship between the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, as envisaged in the\r\nCharter.\r\nThis annual report should serve as a means for\r\nthe general membership of the United Nations to\r\nbecome better acquainted with the work of the Security\r\nCouncil. Its consideration in the General Assembly\r\nwill, it is hoped, provide useful feedback for the\r\nCouncil in the further improvement of its work.\r\nThe annual report by the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly is an important element in the\r\nCharter relationship between these two major organs.\r\nThe Charter requires that the Council submit annual\r\nand, when necessary, special reports to the General\r\nAssembly for its consideration. This is provided for in\r\narticles 15 and 24. This clearly points to the need for\r\nthe Council to be accountable to the larger membership\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nIn this connection, the General Assembly should\r\nhave the opportunity to assess and judge the\r\nperformance of the Council for the past year. In turn,\r\nCouncil members should have the opportunity to pay\r\ncareful attention to the concerns, observations and\r\ncomments of the larger membership of the United\r\nNations. My delegation hopes that the comments and\r\nsuggestions made in the General Assembly will receive\r\nappropriate consideration by the members of the\r\nCouncil in the further discharge of their responsibilities\r\non behalf of all of us in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nLast year, the report of the Council was\r\nintroduced in a fresh, concise and improved format,\r\nwhich my delegation welcomed. We saw it as a\r\nreflection of the Council’s willingness to evolve and\r\nimprove its methods of work. We felt then that the\r\nCouncil had certainly heeded the comments made by\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nthe larger membership over the years. We also\r\nwelcomed the decision of the Security Council to hold\r\nan open meeting to discuss the Council’s report prior to\r\nthe fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We\r\nare disappointed that the Council decided to do away\r\nwith that practice during this session. We think that\r\nsuch an open meeting would be useful and that it\r\nshould be held in the interest of further promoting\r\ntransparency in the work of the Security Council.\r\nMy delegation finds that improvement in the\r\nformat of the report does not necessarily bring about a\r\nqualitative improvement in the substance of the report.\r\nWe think that the attempt introduced last year to\r\nprovide some analytical reporting in the introduction\r\ncould be further improved. We look forward to future\r\nreports containing more details and analyses. We have,\r\nfor instance, called for a more detailed account of\r\nCouncil decisions and actions. We feel that an\r\nelaboration of the circumstances that had influenced\r\nthe decisions of the Council on a particular issue would\r\nallow the larger membership to appreciate the\r\nachievements registered and difficulties faced by the\r\nCouncil. Perhaps, with better understanding, we might\r\nbe able to offer useful suggestions to break an impasse\r\nin the Council or to enable it to make decisions that\r\ncould be successfully implemented by the parties\r\nconcerned and by the international community at large.\r\nWe had hoped that this report of the Council\r\nwould contain an analysis as bold as the one provided\r\nby the Secretary-General in his reports on the work of\r\nthe Organization (A/58/1) and follow-up to the\r\noutcome of the United Nations Millennium Declaration\r\n(A/58/323).\r\nThe holding of thematic discussions is useful for\r\nimproving the effectiveness of the Council. We note\r\nthat the Council held 15 thematic discussions during\r\nthe reporting period on a wide range of issues. The\r\nexchange of views between Council members and non-\r\nmembers in these thematic discussions on issues\r\nrelating to international peace and security will allow\r\nfor the development of appropriate strategies that are\r\nmore holistic and integrated, involving all the major\r\norgans of the United Nations. Nevertheless, such an\r\nexercise by the Security Council should not venture\r\ninto areas that are rightly the responsibility of the other\r\nmajor organs of the United Nations.\r\nGiven the increased workload of the Council, it\r\nmight be helpful if the thematic discussions were kept\r\nto a minimum in any particular year. They should be\r\nheld not just for the sake of having discussions, but\r\nwith a view to achieving concrete results, which would\r\nhave an impact on the performance not only of the\r\nSecurity Council, but also of the United Nations at\r\nlarge. These thematic discussions and other important\r\nissues addressed by the Council from time to time\r\nwould merit the submission of special reports to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, when necessary, as provided for in\r\nthe Charter.\r\nWe note that the Council’s workload has\r\ncontinued to increase steadily. A total of 207 open\r\nmeetings were held, and 66 resolutions were adopted.\r\nConflicts in Africa continue to dominate the work\r\nof the Council. Malaysia is pleased that the Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group on Conflict Prevention and Resolution\r\nin Africa has been active in its efforts to find lasting\r\nsolutions to various conflicts on the continent. Two\r\nSecurity Council Missions were also organized,\r\nnamely, to Central Africa and West Africa in June and\r\nJuly this year, and the Council has made some\r\nimportant recommendations to bring political stability\r\nto the subregions. We are also particularly pleased with\r\nthe signing of a power-sharing agreement in Burundi.\r\nWe look forward to the Council’s taking more effective\r\ndecisions on the conflict situations in Africa.\r\nMy delegation has noted that during the past year\r\nthe Council discussed the Palestinian question with\r\ngreater frequency. We have observed that 12 meetings\r\nand 21 informal consultations were held on this issue.\r\nOnly one resolution was adopted by the Council. We\r\nrecall that the international community welcomed the\r\npublication of the Quartet’s road map in April. Yet the\r\nCouncil has not been able to play the role expected of\r\nit.\r\nMy delegation certainly welcomes the Council’s\r\nconsideration of the question of Palestine through the\r\nmonthly briefings and open debates. Unfortunately,\r\nthese have not had an impact on the situation on the\r\nground. Indeed, the situation is clearly worsening. The\r\nviolence continues, and the death toll has mounted on\r\nboth sides. The Council must improve and maintain its\r\ncredibility by enforcing its authority on this question,\r\nin particular in respect of the commitment to the road\r\nmap and to a peaceful two-State solution, the end of\r\noccupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories, the\r\ntermination of Israel’s settler-colonialism activities and\r\nthe construction of the separation wall.\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nThe Council must not allow its resolutions to be\r\nmanipulated, or the Council itself to be prevented from\r\ndoing anything meaningful, as happened last month. It\r\nshould resolutely take action on the illegal construction\r\nof the Israeli expansionist wall. My delegation hopes\r\nthat this will be done soon on the basis of the initiative\r\ncurrently before the Council. My delegation also hopes\r\nthat the Council will act decisively on the recent\r\nflagrant violation of Syria’s territory by Israel.\r\nAnother issue that has brought great difficulty for\r\nthe Council is that of Iraq. When we discussed the\r\nCouncil’s report about a year ago, the threat to peace in\r\nIraq was looming over our heads. Despite the call by an\r\noverwhelming majority in the United Nations for a\r\npeaceful solution, a war was launched against Iraq, led\r\nby two members of the Security Council. My\r\ndelegation notes that the report gives a description of\r\nthe events leading up to war. Clearly, the war without\r\nSecurity Council authorization has entailed a number\r\nof problems. It is my delegation’s hope that the\r\nSecurity Council will be able to draw clear lessons\r\nfrom this particularly difficult and protracted issue. A\r\nmajor challenge for all of us, and a lesson to be\r\nlearned, is how the Security Council can prevent such a\r\nsituation from occurring again in the future.\r\nMy delegation believes that the United Nations\r\nmust be made to assume its central role in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. It\r\nmust be given major responsibility for resolving the\r\nproblem in Iraq so that the people of Iraq can regain\r\ntheir sovereignty and their suffering can end.\r\nSovereignty must be returned to the Iraqi people soon.\r\nThey must be given the authority over their own\r\nnatural resources, and this should be done quickly.\r\nOtherwise, the United Nations, which is a major\r\ninstrument for promoting decolonization, would be\r\nseen as indifferent to the ending of the occupation of\r\none of its Members. This would indeed be a tragedy.\r\nOn the issue of sanctions, Malaysia in principle\r\nopposes their imposition due to their debilitating\r\nimpact on the general population of a Member State.\r\nSanctions should be utilized as a measure of last resort\r\nand after careful consideration of their ramifications.\r\nSanctions should hit their intended target and not the\r\ninnocent populace. Sanctions must be devised with\r\nclear parameters, including specific and clearly\r\nidentified targets, time frame and regular impact\r\nassessment. In this connection, we welcome the lifting\r\nby the Council of sanctions against Iraq and the Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya.\r\nAt the last session of the General Assembly,\r\ndiscussion on this item was held simultaneously with\r\nthat on the item concerning reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. My delegation found it useful and fitting that\r\nthe two items should be discussed together, as we\r\nbelieve that the issues under consideration are\r\nintertwined and have an important bearing on one\r\nanother. In this connection, my delegation would also\r\ntouch on the issue of reform of the Security Council at\r\nthis juncture.\r\nMalaysia is pleased that the Secretary-General, in\r\noutlining the tasks for the high-level panel of eminent\r\npersons on the reform of the Organization that he\r\nproposes to establish, has included the questions of\r\npeace and security as well as Security Council reform.\r\nThese two subjects must go hand in hand. It is our\r\nconviction that the key to reforming the United Nations\r\nis its democratization, particularly of the Security\r\nCouncil. Not only should the Council’s membership be\r\ndemocratized, but also, most important, so should its\r\ndecision-making process.\r\nAddressing the question of the veto is central to\r\nthe reform of the United Nations. In this connection, it\r\nmay be recalled that the Prime Minister of Malaysia\r\nproposed in his statement in the general debate, on 25\r\nSeptember, that the veto be modified. He proposed that\r\na veto could be cast only when two veto Powers and\r\nthree other members of the Council backed it. This\r\nmodified veto should eventually be abolished and\r\nreplaced by majority decisions. We believe that,\r\ngradually, the United Nations should be made more\r\ndemocratic, and the Prime Minister’s proposal should\r\nprovide a good basis on which to start.\r\nThe cooperation provided by Member States in\r\nthe work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee is an\r\nexcellent illustration of effective multilateralism.\r\nMember States have readily cooperated in\r\nimplementing Security Council resolution 1373 (2001).\r\nWe reiterate the importance of political will and sense\r\nof responsibility among all Member States in effecting\r\nthis badly needed international cooperation to combat\r\nthe scourge of international terrorism.\r\nSadly, such cooperation is not replicated in the\r\nimplementation of many other Council resolutions. As\r\nthey are legally binding, it is incumbent upon Member\r\nStates to implement Security Council resolutions\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nwithout selectivity. The Security Council must play its\r\nrole, without discrimination, to ensure that all Member\r\nStates adhere to and implement its resolutions. In this\r\nconnection, we repeat our support for the adoption by\r\nthe Security Council of clear and precise indicators to\r\nmeasure its work. One such indicator is the level of\r\ncompliance by Member States in implementing the\r\nresolutions of the Council. The Secretary-General has\r\nunderscored the importance of legitimacy in the work\r\nof the United Nations. This question would be crucial\r\nin our endeavour to regain the credibility of the United\r\nNations in the eyes of the international community. The\r\nlegitimacy of action by the Council is at the forefront\r\nof this endeavour. Effective implementation of Council\r\nresolutions would pave the way to that end.\r\nMr. Kuchinsky (Ukraine): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the Republic of Azerbaijan,\r\nGeorgia, the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and the\r\nRepublic of Uzbekistan — the GUUAM member\r\nStates.\r\nFirst of all, I would like to express our gratitude\r\nto the President of the Security Council for the month\r\nof October, Ambassador John Negroponte of the\r\nUnited States, for presenting the annual report of the\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly (A/58/2). The\r\npromising practice of making this — in every sense\r\nweighty — document more analytical, practical and, at\r\nthe same time, thinner and more elegant can be traced\r\nthroughout the last several years. I believe we owe it,\r\nin particular, to the initiatives of present and former\r\nCouncil members, who have pursued the ideology of\r\nnew and constructive change.\r\nDuring the period under review, from August\r\n2002 through July 2003, the Council maintained the\r\nimportant trend towards higher effectiveness and\r\ntransparency, both in quality and in quantity.\r\nA few months ago, addressing the Council\r\nmeeting on cooperation with regional organizations,\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\nexpressed the feeling of global insecurity, which he\r\nsaid “has seldom, if ever, been greater than it is today”\r\n(S/PV.4739). Such a conclusion mirrors the magnitude\r\nof the critical challenges faced by the Security Council\r\nand the international community. Undoubtedly, an\r\nadequate response to the new threats should reflect our\r\ncommon desire for a strong peace and security\r\nframework, based firmly on the international rule of\r\nlaw.\r\nAnalysing the recent performance by the Council,\r\nwe see that the formula of its success consists of four\r\nmajor elements: unity, which allows for overcoming\r\nnational interests in order to reach collective\r\nagreement; political will, which moves the Council\r\ntowards concrete and practical results; sufficiency,\r\nwhich helps to find appropriate methods, instead of\r\nappropriate explanations; and transparency, which\r\nexpands the Council’s capacity and impact on a wider\r\nnumber of international actors.\r\nMay I also highlight yet another important\r\nelement, which is the transformation of its composition\r\nand geographical representation. Despite the\r\nunderstandable frustration over the slow progress in\r\nthis area, we still count on the common will to reach a\r\nreasonable compromise for a comprehensive reform of\r\nthe Council in all its aspects.\r\nI trust you will agree that we all are interested in\r\na strong, proactive and powerful Security Council. For\r\nall its real and perceived imperfections, the Security\r\nCouncil can and should be ready to provide the proper\r\nresponse to these new and important demands.\r\nThe past 12 months appear to be one of the most\r\nturbulent periods in the Council’s recent history.\r\nThough the issue of Iraq almost divided the world\r\ncommunity, the Security Council finally found a path\r\nof unanimity with the adoption of resolution 1441\r\n(2002) and, in spite of later critical developments, it\r\nmanaged to keep on the consensus track with the\r\nadoption of resolutions 1472 (2003), 1476 (2003) and\r\n1483 (2003).\r\nAgainst this background, it is now important to\r\nfocus efforts on securing law and order and promoting\r\nreconstruction in Iraq. The Security Council can play\r\nan even more prominent role in this process. Our\r\ncountries look forward to adopting a new Council\r\nresolution, clarifying the path towards Iraqi self-\r\ngovernance and ensuring peace, stability and recovery.\r\nAt the same time, we should never forget the\r\nirretrievable losses that the United Nations suffered in\r\nthe course of settling the Iraq issue. We lost excellent,\r\ntalented and dedicated people, among them the\r\noutstanding Brazilian diplomat, Sergio Vieira de Mello.\r\nIt is a dramatic and disturbing fact that, during\r\nrecent years, United Nations staff has been facing\r\ngrowing insecurity. This makes it all the more urgent\r\nfor all members of the international community to fully\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\ncomply with the relevant international treaties and, first\r\nof all, with the Convention on the Safety of United\r\nNations and Associated Personnel.\r\nThis year the Security Council has been further\r\nchallenged by developments in the Middle East and in\r\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The first encouraging\r\nsteps in the resumed peace process earlier this year,\r\nbased on the Quartet’s road map, gave way to\r\nscepticism over the viability of the peace plan.\r\nAlthough there were periods of relative calm, the\r\nterrorist attacks and the use of military force continued\r\nto take innocent lives. The recent suicide bombing in\r\nHaifa and the air strikes by Israel on the territory of the\r\nSyrian Arab Republic led to the escalation of tensions\r\nin the Middle East. In general, we still lack final\r\nanswers, and one of the major questions there is still\r\nwhether the Security Council’s reaction to these events\r\nis adequate and in conformity with its Charter\r\nresponsibilities?\r\nAnother demanding problem is the situation in\r\nAfghanistan. We believe that the success of the Bonn\r\nprocess depends to a great extent on the security\r\nsituation in Afghanistan. Therefore, it is difficult to\r\noverestimate the significance of timely and target-\r\noriented actions of the Council and of the global\r\nantiterrorist coalition.\r\nThe GUUAM group welcomes the decision of the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to take\r\nover the command of the International Security\r\nAssistance Force in Kabul, and believes that it is time\r\nto renew the Force’s mandate.\r\nRegarding European issues, the GUUAM group is\r\nconcerned with a lack of progress in the settlement of\r\nthe conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia. We call on the\r\nAbkhaz side to abide by the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions and to accept the document on “Basic\r\nPrinciples for the Distribution of Competences between\r\nTbilisi and Sukhumi” as a basis for negotiations on the\r\nkey issue of the political status of Abkhazia, within the\r\nState of Georgia.\r\nThe convening of two meetings of senior\r\nrepresentatives of the group of friends of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on Georgia in Geneva, and the summit meeting\r\nbetween the Presidents of Georgia and the Russian\r\nFederation in Sochi gave positive impetus to the peace\r\nprocess. The GUUAM group hopes that the dialogue\r\nestablished between the sides will lead to concrete\r\nresults, and that the more active efforts of the United\r\nNations, the Security Council, the group of friends and\r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope will make the encouraging tendency\r\nirreversible.\r\nIn speaking of the wider range of the Council’s\r\nactivities, we are glad to note the final settlement of the\r\nLibyan problem. Positive developments have been\r\nevident in the resolution of African conflicts. The\r\nSecurity Council further strengthened its interaction\r\nwith other United Nations bodies, in particular with the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. Those developments\r\nmark a positive trend.\r\nOf particular importance is enhanced cooperation\r\nbetween the Council and the European Union, as well\r\nas between the Council and African regional\r\norganizations. The deployment of European Union\r\nforces in Bunia and the role played by the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) in\r\nLiberia were instrumental in dealing with security and\r\nhumanitarian crises in the region. We hope that the\r\nnewly established United Nations Mission in\r\nLiberia — one of the major United Nations missions\r\nundertaken to date — will succeed in bringing further\r\nstability to that embattled country.\r\nThe Security Council continues to play a central\r\nrole in facilitating cooperation among Governments in\r\nthe fight against international terrorism. The GUUAM\r\ncountries welcome the endeavours of the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee (CTC) to provide all possible\r\nassistance to the multinational anti-terrorist coalition\r\nby strengthening the capacities of regional\r\norganizations and groups.\r\nThe CTC’s meeting of 6 March with\r\nrepresentatives of regional organizations — a meeting\r\nin which the GUUAM group took an active part —\r\nproved that there is great potential in that sphere. I\r\nwould also like to emphasize that the GUUAM group\r\ntook an active part in the most recent follow-up\r\nmeeting for regional and subregional organizations,\r\nheld on 7 October in Washington, D.C., by the CTC\r\nand the Organization of American States.\r\nWe are confident that the further expansion of\r\ndialogue and cooperation between the Council and its\r\nregional partners will remain a priority task. Successful\r\nexamples of the interaction of the Security Council\r\nwith the European Union, NATO, the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, the African\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nUnion, ECOWAS, the Organization of American\r\nStates, the League of Arab States and other institutions\r\nprove that the United Nations could and should\r\nactively use this important political tool to rely\r\nincreasingly on regional organizations to assume more\r\nresponsibility, especially for peacekeeping efforts.\r\nThe GUUAM group stands ready to cooperate\r\nfully with the Council and to help it to pursue its\r\nCharter responsibilities.\r\nMr. Effah-Apenteng (Ghana): At the outset,\r\nallow me to express my appreciation to Ambassador\r\nJohn Negroponte, Permanent Representative of the\r\nUnited States of America and President of the Security\r\nCouncil for this month, for his lucid introduction of the\r\nannual report of the Security Council for the period 1\r\nAugust 2002 to 31 July 2003 (A/58/2). I would also\r\nlike to thank the United Kingdom and Spain for\r\ndrafting the introduction to the report. Taken as a\r\nwhole, the information detailed in the report conveys a\r\npicture of the busy schedule that characterized the\r\nCouncil’s work during the period covered.\r\nMy delegation appreciates the Council’s focus on\r\npeacekeeping and its comprehensive approach to\r\ndealing with the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, for which it has the primary\r\nresponsibility. We are encouraged by the fact that the\r\nCouncil paid particular attention to conflict prevention,\r\nresolution and management. We would like to urge the\r\nCouncil to continue to focus its attention on those\r\nissues, given the gravity, complexity and multifaceted\r\nnature of the problems and conflicts bedevilling\r\nvarious regions and the need for peace and security,\r\nwhich are prerequisites for promoting development and\r\nstability. In this regard, we cannot overemphasize the\r\nneed for the Council to cooperate with the General\r\nAssembly, and with the Economic and Social Council\r\nand other development bodies, given the\r\ninterrelationship among peace, security and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMy delegation also notes with appreciation the\r\nCouncil’s continued dedication of most of its efforts to\r\nthe African region. This has been evidenced in its\r\nvarious debates on several conflict situations in the\r\ncontinent, such as those in Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Somalia\r\nand the Central African Republic, and also in the\r\nholding of two missions to Central and West Africa, in\r\nJune and July 2003 respectively. It is our hope that\r\nwith the requisite political will, that time and effort\r\nwill be translated into concrete strategic solutions to\r\nthe conflicts plaguing the region. In order for the\r\nmissions to have greater impact, they should be of\r\nlonger duration and should not involve visits to too\r\nmany countries.\r\nFurthermore, we welcome the consultations and\r\ncomplementary initiatives on which the Council\r\nembarked with regional and subregional institutions;\r\nwe would like to encourage the Council to stay on\r\ncourse. We are of the firm conviction that partnerships\r\nwith subregional and regional organizations such as the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) and the African Union (AU) could go a\r\nlong way towards helping to find lasting solutions with\r\nrespect to the prevention, management and resolution\r\nof conflicts in Africa.\r\nHaving brokered the Accra Accord to bring under\r\ncontrol the conflict in Liberia — and, in effect, in the\r\nMano River Union countries — ECOWAS would like\r\nto cooperate with the international community in order\r\nto identify ways in which vital partnerships can\r\nprevent, combat and eradicate illicit brokering in small\r\narms and light weapons in the West African subregion.\r\nI would like to recall that last year my delegation\r\nadded its voice to the call for more information to be\r\nprovided in the report with respect to Security Council\r\nmissions to conflict areas, so as to enable us to acquire\r\nfirst-hand information — if the Council was going to\r\ncontinue to rely on that system, as we thought it\r\nshould. I would like to congratulate the members of the\r\nSecurity Council for improvements in that regard; the\r\npresent report presents a much more detailed account\r\nof those trips.\r\nOver the years, my delegation has been among\r\nthose calling for improvements in the report and in the\r\nprocedures and working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil. Last year, we commended the Council for\r\ncoming out with a new format, which was more\r\ncompact and reader-friendly. However, much remains\r\nto be done in improving upon the analytical\r\nframework. This year’s report, too, lacks the requisite\r\ninformation for an evaluation of the Council’s work.\r\nWe are encouraged by the number of open\r\nmeetings and by the monthly briefings given by the\r\npresidency of the Council, as well as by the periodic\r\nwrap-up meetings to which non-members were invited.\r\nThe holding of such open meetings should not be seen\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\njust as a matter of going through the motions. If they\r\nare to prove useful, the views expressed by Member\r\nStates should be taken into account when real decisions\r\nare made by the Council.\r\nWe wish to commend the Council for its pivotal\r\nrole in the global campaign against terrorism in all its\r\nforms and manifestations. The Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee is a good example of transparency, and we\r\ncongratulate the previous Chairman, Sir Jeremy\r\nGreenstock of the United Kingdom, for his yeoman\r\nservice, and we welcome the further efforts of his\r\nsuccessor, Ambassador Arias of Spain, in that\r\ndirection.\r\nWe also wish to applaud the functioning of the\r\nmechanism to further improve cooperation between the\r\nCouncil and troop-contributing countries, especially\r\nthe growing regularity and frequency of meetings with\r\nthose countries. My delegation believes that that\r\nconsultative mechanism has inherent benefits for all\r\nthe parties involved in peacekeeping.\r\nIt cannot be gainsaid that this has been a very\r\ntrying year for the United Nations in the area of peace\r\nand security. The obvious schisms that arose over the\r\nsituation in Iraq sorely tested the principle of collective\r\nsecurity and the resilience of the Organization. The\r\nexperience gained from these trying times, in which the\r\nOrganization is hard-pressed to reassert its indisputable\r\nrelevance in the contemporary global context, should\r\nlead us to a clear understanding of the ever-present fact\r\nthat the world desires a United Nations whose image\r\nreflects its true nature as an international instrument\r\ndesigned to achieving the common end of a just and\r\nstable world order — one that is not subject to the\r\npursuit of the narrow parochial interests of a powerful\r\nfew.\r\nMy delegation therefore wishes to reiterate the\r\nimperative need to enhance the credibility of the\r\nCouncil through substantive reform guided by the\r\nprinciples of democracy, the sovereign equality of\r\nStates and equitable geographical representation.\r\nMr. Heinbecker (Canada) (spoke in French):\r\nToday I would like to develop three ideas. The first is\r\nthat we could have made do with just one debate on\r\nthese issues instead of two; secondly, the working\r\nmethods of the Security Council can be improved\r\nfurther; and, thirdly and most important, we all must\r\nsupport the broader reform effort launched by the\r\nSecretary-General, even as we continue our own efforts\r\nto reform the Council, the General Assembly and other\r\nUnited Nations bodies.\r\nWe are pleased to see that, once again, the report\r\nof the Security Council (A/58/2) is more concise than\r\nthose of previous years. That is a step forward that\r\nshould facilitate our deliberations. Having said that, I\r\nam disappointed that we have also taken a step\r\nbackward. Last year, we instituted a joint debate on the\r\nreport of the Security Council and on the question of\r\nrepresentation on the Council. This year we are back to\r\nthe two-debate format, which only consumes extra time\r\nand appears to go against the flow of reform ideas.\r\nThis is particularly regrettable, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is about to form his panel of eminent\r\npersonalities with the mandate to examine reform. We\r\ncan and must use our time more efficiently and\r\neffectively.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWith regard to the Council’s methods, we would\r\nlike to see still greater transparency; self-discipline in\r\nthe recourse to the threat or the use of the veto; a\r\nvoluntary commitment by veto holders to explain to the\r\nentire membership the rationale in each case why a\r\nveto has been used; and, as regards the Council’s\r\ntreatment of the International Criminal Court, greater\r\nadherence to the Charter.\r\nWe would also like to see more systematic\r\nconsultation with non-members of the Council on\r\nmatters of significant interest to them. We are pleased,\r\nin this regard, that the Council has begun to consult\r\ntroop-contributing countries more formally on military\r\nmission mandates. None of us here has any doubt today\r\nthat we live in troubled times, times when soldiers of\r\npeace are attacked, such as the two Canadian soldiers\r\nkilled in Kabul just 10 days ago or the 22 United\r\nNations staffers killed in Baghdad two months ago.\r\nThese and other attacks are attacks against us all, for,\r\nas the Secretary-General has said, we are the United\r\nNations. We live in times when terrorists target the\r\ninnocent, when abject poverty is the daily reality for so\r\nmany of our fellow human beings, and when some\r\nleaders have to be reminded that the State exists for the\r\npeople, not the people for the State, that sovereignty\r\nentails responsibilities as well as privileges, and that\r\nthe primordial responsibility of States — and their\r\nleaders — is to protect their own people. Most germane\r\nfor the people in this Hall, we are living in times when\r\nmany of our own people are losing faith in this\r\nOrganization and in us, and in this Organization’s —\r\nthat is to say our — ability to respond to these\r\nchallenges.\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\nClearly, the United Nations has much to be proud\r\nof, from its 50 plus years of peacekeeping operations,\r\nto the arms control regimes it has created, to the six\r\ncore human rights treaties it has passed, to the\r\ninternational courts — especially the International\r\nCriminal Court — that it has sponsored, to the 120\r\nenvironmental agreements it has brought about, to the\r\nchildren it has fed and educated and inoculated, to the\r\nrefugees it has saved and sheltered and to the\r\nleadership it is providing on health, particularly on\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nBut, equally clearly, all is not well here. As\r\nSecretary-General Annan indicated during his address\r\nto the General Assembly on 23 September, we have\r\ncome to a fork in the road. Few among us would\r\ndisagree that our Organization needs thorough, far-\r\nreaching reform. To continue with business as usual in\r\nthese circumstances would be an exercise in\r\ncomplacency and an abdication of our responsibilities.\r\nWe need to reconsider both what this Organization\r\ndoes and how it does it.\r\nIn considering these purposes and practices, we\r\nneed to serve the interests of both the least and the\r\ngreatest among us. Otherwise, we risk being inadequate\r\nto the needs of the former and irrelevant to the fears of\r\nthe latter. We need, as the Secretary-General said here\r\non 23 September, in his seminal address, to “face up\r\nsquarely to the concerns that make some States feel\r\nuniquely vulnerable, since it is those concerns that\r\ndrive them to take unilateral action” (A/58/PV.7, p. 3).\r\nWe need, no less urgently, to agree that we have a\r\ncollective responsibility to protect the innocent by\r\npreventing conflicts, by reacting to conflicts where we\r\nhave not succeeded in preventing them and by\r\nrebuilding societies after conflicts are over.\r\nWe need to ensure that we deal effectively with\r\nthe weaknesses of both the Security Council and the\r\nother organs of the United Nations, including the\r\nGeneral Assembly. That is why we welcome the\r\nSecretary-General’s decision to establish a panel of\r\neminent persons to make recommendations to States\r\nboth on what the United Nations does and how it does\r\nit — or how it should do it. It is an idea that Canada\r\nheartily endorses. The Secretary-General is seeking to\r\nbreak the reform logjam. Let us work with him and\r\nwith his panel of eminent persons so that, in a year’s\r\ntime, they can make the soundest possible proposals for\r\nchange to our Governments: to the membership.\r\nMeanwhile, let us keep an open mind on what\r\nthat change should entail. And, in the interim, let us go\r\non ourselves, improving the way we do business,\r\nincluding here in the General Assembly. Let us resolve\r\nhere that the 191 delegations that inhabit this place will\r\nbe part of the solution and not part of the problem.\r\nReflecting on his experience with the United\r\nNations, the late Canadian Prime Minister Lester B.\r\nPearson, a former President of the General Assembly,\r\nwrote that\r\n“the growth of the United Nations into a truly\r\neffective world organization was our best, and\r\nperhaps our last, hope ... if mankind was to end a\r\nsavage tradition that the strong do what they can\r\nand the weak suffer what they must.”\r\nIn the intervening 50 years, we have made enormous\r\nprogress. But times change, needs change and now we\r\nneed the United Nations to change.\r\nPrime Minister Pearson’s generation bequeathed\r\nus this magnificent, crucial Organization. It is up to our\r\ngeneration now to renew it and regenerate it. None of\r\nus here doubts that multilateral cooperation is\r\nindispensable, or that global issues respond only to\r\nglobal solutions, or that the United Nations is and must\r\nbe at the heart of the multilateral system and is, or\r\nshould be, essential to the legitimacy of international\r\nactions. No time is perfect for reform, but a historic\r\nopportunity is emerging here, and we should seize that\r\nopportunity.\r\nOur parents and grandparents, realistic idealists\r\nwho experienced the worst war in history, bequeathed\r\nto us the extraordinary idea that nations could unite to\r\nbuild better lives for their people; that they could unite\r\nto safeguard the rights and the dignity of the men and\r\nthe women of nations large and small; and that they\r\ncould unite to save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of war.\r\nThat dream remains unfulfilled for many people.\r\nAnd, for all people, that dream at times recedes. But it\r\nremains a dream that time has not mocked.\r\nAt San Francisco, the leaders of another\r\ngeneration, in times no easier than these, dreamt of a\r\nbetter world and created an institution with which to\r\nbuild it. Let us, let our generation, revive the dream.\r\nLet it be said of us by the generation that follows us\r\nthat we were worthy descendants of the giants who\r\ncreated this place and that, when challenged, we did\r\nnot fail them or their idea of the United Nations that\r\nthey bequeathed to us.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.28\r\n"
