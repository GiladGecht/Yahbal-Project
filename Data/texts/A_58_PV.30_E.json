Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 11 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council\r\nMr. Gopinathan (India): I would like to convey\r\nmy delegation’s appreciation to Ambassador John\r\nNegroponte, Permanent Representative of the United\r\nStates and President of the Security Council, for his\r\npresentation to the General Assembly of the report of\r\nthe Council for the period from 1 August 2002 to 31\r\nJuly 2003.\r\nBefore proceeding further, I wish to convey a\r\nsense of our disappointment over the discontinuance of\r\nthe practice, of convening an open meeting of the\r\nSecurity Council to consider its draft report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly. As many of us will recall, the\r\npractice was instituted last year, at the initiative of\r\nSingapore, who is unfortunately no longer on the\r\nCouncil, with the intention of improving the quality and\r\nconsideration of the report within the Council before its\r\npresentation to the General Assembly. We would like to\r\nvoice our apprehension that this worthy practice,\r\nlaunched last year, might end up as an isolated attempt.\r\nIn our view, this would be a disservice to the general\r\nmembership, which stood to profit immensely from the\r\nviews of members of the Council on how they\r\nthemselves perceived and evaluated the work of the\r\nCouncil during the period under review. We would not\r\nlike to infer that the discontinuation of this useful practice\r\nrepresents any weakening of the Council’s collective\r\nresolve to continue with a sprit of reform and greater\r\ntransparency in the working of the Security Council.\r\nWe agree with the conclusion contained in the\r\nreport that the last 12 months have represented a steady\r\nincrease in the workload of the Security Council.\r\nAdmittedly, the Council has had to confront some of\r\nthe most difficult issues during this period.\r\nIt would be remiss on our part not to reiterate our\r\ndeep regret over the inability of the Council to reach\r\nsatisfactory agreement on the issue of war and peace in\r\nIraq in the first quarter of this year. We can only\r\nattribute the inability of the Council to arrive at a\r\ncollective and unified decision on the major issues\r\nplaced before it to the lack of balanced representation\r\nin its current composition.\r\nThe Prime Minister of India did touch upon this\r\nimbalance when he stated in his address to the current\r\nsession of the Assembly on September 25, “For the\r\nSecurity Council to represent genuine multilateralism\r\nin its decisions and actions, its membership must reflect\r\ncurrent world realities” (A/58/PV.11, p. 14). Within the\r\nUnited Nations, there is ample recognition of the need\r\nfor the Organization and its architecture, in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, to\r\nadapt to the needs and realities of the times. The\r\nSecretary-General himself underscored this point when\r\nhe said that to regain the confidence of States, and of\r\nworld opinion, the Security Council must become\r\n“more broadly representative of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole as well as the geo-political\r\nrealities of today” (A/58/PV.7, p. 3).\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nThe Council’s preoccupation with Iraq did not,\r\ndespite the best intentions of its members, afford it\r\nsufficient time for a more serious examination of other\r\nmajor issues on its agenda relating to the Middle East,\r\nAfrica and Afghanistan. In the area of counter-terrorism,\r\nwhile every effort has been made by the Council to\r\nmaintain the momentum achieved, mechanisms are yet\r\nto be put in place that would hold countries\r\naccountable for their genuine commitment to and\r\nactions in the fight against terrorism originating in\r\nterritories under their control. The Council needs to\r\nmove from the inexhaustible stage of helping to\r\nestablish legal and financial frameworks to a more\r\nserious examination of the actual contributions — or\r\nlack thereof — by Member States to counter-terrorism\r\nefforts. Only by doing so would it have come to grips\r\nwith the real issues at hand.\r\nThe non-permanent members of Security Council\r\nhave taken upon themselves the responsibility, based\r\non their long-term interests, to pursue the agenda of\r\ngreater transparency and reform in the working of the\r\nSecurity Council. Unfortunately, this has not always\r\nbeen the case. In the period under review, new and\r\ningenious methods appear to have been invented,\r\ndesigned to confuse and often exclude the general\r\nmembership from specific projects being pursued in the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe would like to comment, by way of illustration,\r\non a few instances in the functioning of the Security\r\nCouncil that may be perceived as attempts to obfuscate or\r\nlimit access to it by the general membership.\r\nDelayed decision-making on the format of\r\ndiscussions to be followed is a case in point. In at least\r\none instance, the President of the Council delayed a\r\ndecision on the format of discussions to be followed on\r\nan important but controversial thematic topic until a\r\nvery late stage, at which point the subject was declared\r\nopen to the participation of the general membership.\r\nWe are not in a position to fathom the reasons behind\r\nsuch actions. We can only hope that they were not\r\nintended to deny time for adequate preparations by\r\ndelegations seeking to intervene on the given subject.\r\nMr. Fadaifard (Islamic Republic of Iran), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nA second case in point is the Council’s\r\nexperimentation with different modes of participation\r\nunder rule 37 of its provisional rules of procedure. The\r\ndecision by the Council presidency to restrict\r\nparticipation in an open debate on an issue of import to\r\na late stage and to only one or two candidates per\r\nregion could, by its very selectivity, have resulted in\r\nacts of omission or exclusion. Moreover, as is well\r\nknown, some regional groups, such as the Asian\r\nGroup, do not have the mandate to discuss and decide\r\non issues other than elections. Such factors could well\r\nhave added to the impracticability and undemocratic\r\nnature of the decision taken.\r\nA third case in point is discrimination between\r\nmembers and non-members of the Council on time\r\nlimits for statements. In a recent incident the President\r\nof the Council declared a time limit for statements\r\nduring an open debate on a subject of considerable\r\nimportance. However, while members of the Council\r\nwere allowed to give full reign to their views without\r\nobserving any time limit, the general membership was\r\nsubjected to the strictest implementation of a restrictive\r\ntime limit. That incident was considered serious enough\r\nto produce considerable adverse reaction at meetings of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement and the Arab Group.\r\nThe discriminatory treatment between members\r\nand non-members of the Council tends to be\r\npronounced during the so-called ministerial-level\r\nmeetings of the Council, which now are held\r\nincreasingly in two segments, one for the members and\r\nthe other for the less privileged. In that context, we\r\nwould also like to state that expecting non-members to\r\nbe content with reading parts of their statements and\r\ncirculating a longer text is unrealistic as long as the\r\nprovisional verbatim records reflect only what is\r\nactually spoken in the formal meetings of the Council.\r\nA fourth case in point is the surprise scheduling\r\nof open debates with selective notification. In a recent\r\ninstance, an open debate of the Council was scheduled\r\nin response to a serious incident which occurred over a\r\nweekend. Some non-members of the Council did learn\r\nof the meeting and were able to make statements under\r\nrule 37. Others were fortunate if they happened to learn\r\nof the event from television broadcasts. The issue here\r\ncontinues to remain one of selectivity and arbitrariness.\r\nI must hasten to point out that the issues referred\r\nto are not being raised with the intention of castigating\r\nthose involved, but with the desire to bring to the\r\nattention of the larger membership of the General\r\nAssembly and the select membership of the Security\r\nCouncil the areas where greater transparency,\r\npredictability and some even-handedness would be\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nwelcome, and could add to the Council’s effectiveness.\r\nIn our view, if the Council followed some rules-of-thumb\r\nin its practices, it would go a long way in assuring the\r\ngeneral membership of the Council’s sincerity in\r\nattempting to take into account the membership’s\r\nconcerns during Council deliberations. We shall\r\nattempt to list a few suggestions in that regard.\r\nUnless an item is introduced in reaction to major\r\nevents of the day, all open debates involving the\r\nparticipation of the general membership of the\r\nOrganization must be announced at the beginning of the\r\nmonth, when the programme of work is presented and\r\nadopted. Surprise scheduling should be avoided wherever\r\npossible and, if absolutely unavoidable, measures to\r\ninform all members concerned through the mail or by\r\nfacsimile, electronic mail or telephone communication\r\nto the relevant missions would be desirable.\r\nAll non-members of the Council wishing to\r\nparticipate under rule 37 of the Council’s provisional\r\nrules of procedure should be allowed the time they\r\nrequire to convey their views. If that is not possible due\r\nto the exigencies of the situation — and we believe this\r\nshould be truly exceptional — a standard pre-announced\r\ntime limit should be imposed upon all, members and\r\nnon-members alike, without any discrimination.\r\nThe increasing resort to new and fanciful thematic\r\nissues as the crowning glory of non-permanent member\r\npresidencies should be rationalized and restricted, in\r\norder to better utilize the time available for the\r\nconsideration of pressing current issues relating to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe idea of wrap-up sessions, presumably\r\nconceived to allow for stock-taking at the end of a\r\nmonth’s work, should not be utilized to promote\r\ncontroversial issues that selectively advance the\r\nnational agendas of members concerned.\r\nBriefings by Council presidencies to non-\r\nmembers of the Council tend to be arbitrary and ad hoc\r\nin their scheduling. Some presidencies tend to attach\r\ndue importance to that process, while others have been\r\nindifferent to this requirement. It has been observed that,\r\nin several instances, despite the scheduling of briefings to\r\nthe general membership, such briefings either do not take\r\nplace at all or are carried out in a perfunctory manner.\r\nIn fact, briefings to the media are far more\r\ncomprehensive and regular than those to non-members.\r\nBriefings by Council presidencies need to be regular,\r\nthorough and qualitative if the Council is to fulfil its\r\ncommitment to ensuring adequate transparency in its\r\nfunctioning among Member States of the Organization.\r\nIn conclusion, we express the hope that the\r\nexisting and aspiring non-permanent members of the\r\nCouncil will take up with renewed vigour the process\r\nof improving the accountability and working methods\r\nof the Security Council in a manner that would bring it\r\ninto a more harmonious functional relationship with the\r\nlarger membership of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Thamrin (Indonesia): It is a pleasure for my\r\ndelegation to welcome the report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly (A/58/2), covering\r\nthe period 1 August 2002 to 31 July 2003. I would like\r\nto express our appreciation to the President of the\r\nCouncil, Ambassador Negroponte, for his clear and\r\ncapable introduction of the report. As usual, the report\r\nprovides a quick overview of the Council in the last\r\nyear in its area of responsibility, which is the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. As we\r\nall know, the Council’s report for the past year was\r\nvery helpful in that respect. This is always a good\r\nopportunity for Member States to take a look at the\r\nwork of the Council in the course of the previous year,\r\nand one that we always look forward to. We thank the\r\nmembers of the Council for the report.\r\nBefore I go any further, I would also like to\r\nwelcome, on behalf of my delegation, the report of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council. This is a very\r\nimportant issue to my delegation and to other Member\r\nStates of the United Nations, and we always welcome\r\nthis annual opportunity to contribute to it.\r\nThe report of the Security Council before us is a\r\nvery important document. It faithfully details the work\r\nof the Council within the period under consideration.\r\nUnfortunately, it remains little more than a blow-by-\r\nblow account, one that could easily have been prepared\r\nby individual Permanent Missions to the United\r\nNations or obtained from the Dag Hammarskjöld\r\nLibrary. It contains previously publicized documents,\r\nbut little analysis or explanation of the Council’s\r\nactions and decisions, though many delegations have\r\nrequested this in the past. Moreover, the report shows\r\nvery little evidence of its purpose as an important\r\naccounting to the Assembly. What makes the report\r\neven more difficult to understand is that it is still being\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nsent late to Member States every year. There is\r\ntherefore a clear contradiction between its contents and\r\nthe amount of time needed to process it. Unless there is\r\nsignificant analytical input, it is difficult to see why a\r\nreport with a cut-off date of July cannot reach Member\r\nStates within the following month.\r\nIn that connection, it is curious to consider, for\r\ninstance, that despite all of the events that took place in\r\nconnection with Iraq during the period under review, the\r\nreport devotes just over two pages to the subject, without\r\na word beyond what was already known to Member\r\nStates. For an institution concerned with the maintenance\r\nof peace and security, the annual report contains almost\r\nno mention of the hostilities. Indeed, the report refers only\r\nto the President of the Council being informed of “the\r\ncommencement of military action” (A/58/2, p. 7) and\r\nmeeting “the period of conflict in Iraq” (ibid.).\r\nThere should be no mistake about this: when the\r\nCouncil reports to the Assembly it is not a matter of a\r\nconcession by one body of the United Nations to\r\nanother, but the fulfilment of a Charter obligation. This\r\nobligation should be wholly and consistently fulfilled,\r\nin the interest of the peoples of the United Nations, by\r\nboth the Secretariat and the Security Council. Our\r\nrequest is for a document that is useful to the wider\r\nmembership of our Organization because it is timely,\r\ninformative and analytical.\r\nDespite the foregoing, we are pleased that the\r\nCouncil was able to accomplish so much with its\r\nincreased workload during the period covered. We note\r\nthe progress in its work in such areas as African\r\nconflicts, the Middle East and counter-terrorism.\r\nParticular mention must be made of the Council’s focus\r\non the situation in Africa, where there has been\r\nrenewed instability in some countries, notably Côte\r\nd’Ivoire and Liberia. The Council demonstrated\r\nlaudable commitment when it sent two missions to\r\ndifferent locations on the continent at the same time.\r\nSimilarly, the work of the Council in connection\r\nwith the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, especially the\r\nimplementation of the Quartet road map, deserves\r\ncommendation. Indonesia has always supported the\r\nroad map and has urged its faithful implementation. In\r\nour statements to the Council, we have also taken the\r\nview that the Council should maintain a proactive\r\nstance. It is to be hoped that, despite recent setbacks in\r\nthat process, the Council will find ways of encouraging\r\nthe parties, thereby steering the process carefully and\r\nwith determination towards the stated objectives.\r\nMy delegation is gratified at the progress that\r\ncontinues to be made in some of these conflict\r\nsituations, and the intervention that is therefore\r\npossible, not only in averting humanitarian crises, but\r\nalso in promoting peace and democracy.\r\nBefore concluding my comments on the report, I\r\nwould like to note that, while the Council tried to\r\nencourage greater transparency in recent years by\r\norganizing monthly wrap-up sessions that were open to\r\nMember States, that pattern has not been followed\r\nduring the past year. In our view, what is needed are\r\nmore — not fewer — such occasions; they are important\r\ncontributions that can be duly reported in the Council’s\r\nannual reports to the General Assembly.\r\nIt remains a matter of great concern to my\r\ndelegation that no substantial progress has been made\r\non the issue of Security Council reform nearly 10 years\r\nafter the Open-ended Working Group was established.\r\nThe events of the early part of this year underscore\r\nwhat we have continued to stress — comprehensive\r\nreform of the Council is long overdue, if the decisions\r\nof that body are to continue to enjoy the support of the\r\nlarger membership of this Organization.\r\nThere can be no doubt that a transparent,\r\ndemocratic and representative Security Council, whose\r\nmembership and practices reflect the world of the\r\ntwenty-first century — not of the first half of the\r\ntwentieth century — is the only structure capable of\r\nachieving this goal. We should not place this overriding\r\nobjective after national or narrower interests.\r\nMr. Kirn (Slovenia): In my statement I will refer\r\nto both agenda items — one on the report of the\r\nSecurity Council and the other on Security Council\r\nreform, thus joining those who believe that the joint\r\ndebates serve well both the substance of the issues and\r\nthe efficient use of time.\r\nAt the outset, let me thank the Security Council\r\nand the Secretariat for the comprehensive report on the\r\nwork of the Council during the past year, and in\r\nparticular Ambassador Negroponte of the United\r\nStates, the current President of the Council, for\r\nintroducing the Council report. We welcome the\r\ncontinuation of the structure and approach of the report\r\nintroduced last year, once again making the report\r\nconcise, easier to read and analytical.\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nDuring the past year, the Council, and\r\nconsequently the Organization, has been tested\r\nseverely. The unity of purpose and action of the\r\nCouncil has been and continues to be called into\r\nquestion. I am, of course, referring to the Iraqi crisis.\r\nAs the Secretary-General notes in his report on the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations Millennium\r\nDeclaration, the climate of cooperation and consensus\r\nwas seriously eroded by the war against Iraq. We call\r\nonce again on the members of the Council to strive for\r\nsolutions for Iraq that will command wide international\r\nand Iraqi support and will improve security in the\r\ncountry, speed up the process of Iraqi democratization\r\nand institution-building and foster a climate of social\r\nand economic well-being for the Iraqi people.\r\nThis and other crises of today’s world demonstrate,\r\nin our opinion, increasing global interdependence in the\r\nsphere of security, whereby the Council holds primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. We believe these crises also serve as a\r\nstark reminder of the urgent need to adapt the Security\r\nCouncil’s permanent and non-permanent composition, as\r\nwell as its working methods, including the right of\r\nveto, to cope efficiently with the geopolitical realities\r\nof today’s world. I shall address the issue of Security\r\nCouncil reform in the latter part of my statement.\r\nOn a more positive side, we commend the\r\ncontinuous trend towards greater transparency in the\r\nCouncil’s work. Still, we should aim for greater\r\ntransparency in the future work of the Council. The\r\nincreasing practice of holding open Council meetings\r\ncontributes significantly to that end, as it provides\r\nopportunities for the general membership to participate\r\nin the Council’s work. We especially welcome the\r\ngrowing use of Council field missions, such as those\r\nthat have been conducted over the past year in Central\r\nAfrica and West Africa, as well as the meetings held by\r\nthe Council with troop-contributing countries.\r\nFurthermore, we commend the Council meetings\r\nheld on the topical issues of our times. Slovenia has been\r\na longstanding proponent of the Council’s addressing the\r\nprotection of civilians affected by armed conflicts and\r\nthe prevention of conflicts. Recognizing the importance\r\nof gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping operations,\r\nwe are particularly pleased with the Council’s ongoing\r\nattention to women and peace and security. The same\r\ngoes for the issue of children and armed conflict.\r\nDuring the last open debate on this issue, Slovenia was\r\namong those that welcomed the innovative, yet, in our\r\nview, necessary practice, of listing those entities still\r\nrecruit children into their armed forces.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity particularly to\r\nwelcome the recent open debate of the Council on the\r\nsubject of justice and the rule of law and the role of the\r\nUnited Nations. Conflict-management and post-conflict\r\nresolution cannot be successfully dealt with without\r\naddressing the rule of law from its various points of\r\nview, among others, by including this essential\r\ncomponent more often in peacekeeping operations.\r\nBoth the International Criminal Tribunal for\r\nRwanda and the International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia are cases in point on the importance\r\nof justice in bringing about the difficult process of\r\nnational reconciliation. We believe that it is the role of\r\nthe Council, and indeed, in its own interest, to uphold\r\nthe integrity of the Statute of the International Criminal\r\nCourt in the area of preventing and settling disputes.\r\nWe welcome the Council’s attention given to\r\nAfrica, particularly during recent months. The French-\r\nled European mission in the eastern part of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo set a very positive\r\nexample of how the prompt successful cooperation of\r\nregional partners in crisis management is indeed\r\nfeasible. The recent signing of the Memorandum of the\r\nEuropean Union-United Nations Joint Declaration on\r\nCrisis Management is an important step in the right\r\ndirection, one that Slovenia also welcomes in its capacity\r\nas a European Union acceding State. It should also serve\r\nin exploring more ambitiously the issue of strengthened\r\ncooperation of the United Nations, notably the Security\r\nCouncil, with existing regional organizations.\r\nLet me now touch upon the question of the\r\nreform of the Security Council. Without jeopardizing\r\nour intent, we could re-read our statements of last year,\r\nand express our thoughts of last year to the effect that\r\nthe Security Council is simply not reflecting the reality\r\nof today’s world, and that we should therefore not be\r\nsurprised when problems of authority, legitimacy and\r\neffectiveness of the Council are raised. But again, that\r\nwould not sufficient to meet our needs today, not\r\nbecause last year’s assessments would no longer be\r\naccurate, but because the urgency of reform and the\r\nmomentum for change are much greater.\r\nOver the past year, the entire Organization —\r\nprimarily, of course, the Security Council — has\r\nencountered serious challenges. As the Secretary-\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nGeneral, Kofi Annan, said in his address before the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session:\r\n“... we must not shy away from questions about\r\nthe adequacy and effectiveness of the rules and\r\ninstruments at our disposal.\r\n“Among those instruments, none is more\r\nimportant than the Security Council itself”\r\n(A/58/PV.7, p. 3).\r\nThe Security Council is too important to be left\r\non the margin of our discussions and eventually of our\r\ndecisions related to United Nations reform. Security\r\nCouncil reform should be a part of United Nations\r\nreform.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group on Security\r\nCouncil reform has been a useful forum that has\r\nproduced a number of good ideas still relevant to\r\ntoday’s purpose. Yet we must face the fact that its work\r\nis at an impasse. We cannot afford another 10 years of\r\nfruitless debates. We need a more ambitious framework\r\nbased on a common perception of the need for change.\r\nSuch a debate must start immediately if we wish to\r\ntake advantage of the current momentum and if we\r\nwant to strengthen the Organization. We encourage the\r\nPresident to stimulate such a debate.\r\nWhile supporting the Secretary-General’s\r\nintention to establish a high-level panel of eminent\r\npersonalities, we trust that our search for Council\r\nreform solutions will be seen as a part of the same\r\nprocess and therefore as complementary to the work of\r\nsuch a high-level panel.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to point out once again that\r\nthe momentum for change is there, and we need to\r\nseize it unambiguously. As the Secretary-General said,\r\nthis momentum may be no less decisive than that in\r\n1945 itself, when the United Nations was founded. At\r\nthis point in time, all of us may not yet share a concept\r\nof the end results of Council reform, but we share a\r\nperception of the urgent need for a changed Security\r\nCouncil that is more representative, more legitimate,\r\nmore transparent and more efficient.\r\nMr. Pfanzelter (Austria): I should like to express\r\nAustria’s gratitude to Ambassador John Negroponte,\r\ncurrent President of the Security Council, for his\r\nconcise presentation of the report of the Council\r\n(A/58/2). At the same time, my delegation commends\r\nthe Secretariat for its excellent work in compiling that\r\ninvaluable reference and source of information. The\r\npresentation of the report is a welcome continuation of\r\nthe Security Council’s dialogue with the General\r\nAssembly in discharge of its duties pursuant to Article\r\n24 of the Charter. That dialogue will enhance the\r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council in promoting the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter.\r\nAn adequate flow of information to non-members\r\nof the Security Council is a prerequisite for\r\nunderstanding and assessing how the Council is dealing\r\nwith political issues and should therefore be strengthened.\r\nThe presidency of the Security Council should play a\r\ncrucial role in keeping the general membership fully\r\ninformed about the Council’s deliberations. The\r\nmonthly forecast on the work of the Council constitutes\r\na useful tool for all delegations. The briefings of the\r\nrespective presidencies and the information they make\r\navailable via their home pages have been further\r\nimproved. The increase in the number of public meetings\r\nunderlines the Council’s willingness to take into account\r\nthe views of Member States at large and to use them as\r\ninput in the Council’s decision-making process. We\r\nwelcome the reduction in the number of closed\r\nmeetings, as outlined by Ambassador Negroponte.\r\nThe inclusion in the report of a narrative\r\noverview of the work of the Security Council is a\r\npositive development. Its usefulness could be further\r\nincreased with a more extensive analysis of the\r\ndecision-making process in the Council. My delegation\r\nwelcomes the efforts to streamline the report. Reducing\r\nthe number of its pages makes the report not only more\r\nreadable, but also more cost-effective.\r\nThe experience of peacekeeping operations has\r\nclearly underlined that the Council can act successfully\r\nonly if it is engaged in a substantive dialogue with\r\nMember States. Austria, as a traditional provider of\r\npeacekeeping troops, particularly commends the Council\r\nfor its efforts to increase the number of meetings with\r\ntroop-contributing countries. Cooperation at an early\r\nstage between the Council and troop-contributing\r\ncountries is essential when we consider new mandates\r\nfor United Nations peacekeeping missions.\r\nAs a member of the Human Security Network,\r\nAustria welcomes the increased attention that the\r\nSecurity Council is devoting to the problems of\r\ncivilians and children in armed conflicts and in post-\r\nconflict situations by holding open debates on those\r\nissues. The recent thematic Security Council meeting\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\non “Justice and the rule of law: the United Nations\r\nrole” is a commendable initiative that should be\r\ncontinued in the near future.\r\nMr. Grey-Johnson (Gambia): My delegation\r\nvery much appreciates the report of the Security\r\nCouncil (A/58/2) that is before us. It is comprehensive\r\nyet concise, and bears testimony to a year of hard work\r\nand high productivity. We commend all Council members\r\nfor their dedication and effectiveness in the service of the\r\nOrganization, and indeed of humanity at large.\r\nAfrica has dominated the work of the Council for\r\nyet another year. And once more, the Council has been\r\nable to show results. The United Nations involvement\r\nin Côte d’Ivoire has been made more robust with the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations Mission in Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, whose mandate is to assist in the full\r\nimplementation of the Linas-Marcoussis peace\r\nAgreement. The situation in Liberia has been\r\ncontained, and United Nations peacekeeping operations\r\nhave commenced there with the establishment of the\r\nUnited Nations Mission in Liberia. The United Nations\r\nMission in Sierra Leone has helped to consolidate the\r\ntremendous gains registered in Sierra Leone since the\r\ncessation of hostilities. In conflict zones elsewhere in\r\nAfrica, the Council has indeed played its part and has\r\nresponded well to the many challenges.\r\nThe Council’s Ad Hoc Working Group on\r\nConflict Prevention and Resolution in Africa, under the\r\nchairmanship of Ambassador Ismael Abraão Gaspar\r\nMartins of Angola, continues to closely monitor the\r\nsituation in Guinea-Bissau. It continues to work with\r\nthe Economic and Social Council through that body’s\r\nAd Hoc Advisory Group on Guinea-Bissau as well as\r\nwith the Group of Friends of Guinea-Bissau to\r\nrecommend courses of action to be followed in our bid\r\nto keep the country from retreating into conflict and to\r\nstrengthen its political transition.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe Council has shown much concern for the dire\r\nhumanitarian situation prevailing in Guinea-Bissau as a\r\nresult of poor economic performance and the\r\nwithholding of aid. My delegation sincerely hopes that,\r\nwith the new political developments in the country, the\r\ndonor community will play its part to ensure that a\r\nchange in attitude towards the country leads to the\r\ntypes of material and financial support necessary to\r\neliminate the risk of upheaval, strife and conflict.\r\nOverall, although conflicts appear to have\r\nsimmered down in much of West Africa, their causes\r\nhave not yet been completely removed. To be proactive\r\nin our efforts to prevent or resolve conflicts, we must\r\nbegin to address their causes at the root. The Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council should,\r\ntogether, begin to examine issues of governance,\r\npoverty, exclusion, corruption and other factors that\r\nbring about conflict in African countries.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the initiatives being\r\ntaken to address the problem of small arms and light\r\nweapons. We call for similar measures to tackle the\r\nproblem of mercenaries, whose prevalence in West\r\nAfrica keeps countries in that subregion constantly in\r\nthe shadow of war.\r\nCooperating with regional organizations, as the\r\nCouncil did with the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) in the Liberian conflict, could\r\nbe an efficient and cost-effective means of conflict\r\nresolution. The Council should consider resorting to it\r\nmore. Furthermore, in cases where inadequate resources\r\ncircumscribe the effectiveness of regional organizations,\r\nthe Council should examine the possibilities of making\r\nthe requisite outlays to enable them to operate more\r\neasily.\r\nWe hailed the publication of the Quartet’s road\r\nmap for the Middle East in the hope that it would usher in\r\npeace in that unfortunate region. However, rather than\r\nabating, the situation actually worsened significantly.\r\nThe Security Council must continue to be patient, but it\r\nmust also become more imaginative in its search for a\r\nsolution to the problem in the Middle East. Ways must be\r\nfound to realize the creation of a sovereign Palestinian\r\nState, side by side with a secure State of Israel.\r\nIraq dominated the Council’s preoccupations\r\nduring the reporting period, and, although the Council\r\ndid its utmost to prevent war, war in fact did break out.\r\nMy delegation strongly urges the Council to set its\r\nsights on the future and begin the necessary actions to\r\nbring the United Nations to the service of the people of\r\nIraq, as well as to respond to their emergency\r\nhumanitarian and development needs. The initial\r\nexperience has been bitter, with the bombing that\r\nclaimed the lives of Sergio Vieira de Mello and many\r\nof his colleagues, but it should not deter us.\r\nMy delegation calls upon the Council to review\r\nits policy on sanctions, whether smart sanctions or\r\notherwise. In the majority of cases, they hurt only the\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\npoor innocent civilians who invariably are the very\r\nvictims of the situations that brought the sanctions\r\nabout in the first place. Sanctions that have a negative\r\nimpact on the health, education and nutritional status of\r\nthe population are not, for any reason whatever,\r\njustifiable. In many cases, the real victims of sanctions\r\nare women, children, the aged and rural communities.\r\nWe expect the Council Working Group on general\r\nissues relating to sanctions to conduct a comprehensive\r\nreview of the effects of sanctions on vulnerable groups\r\nwith a view to advising the Council — and indeed the\r\ngeneral membership of the United Nations — as to their\r\nreal impact and effectiveness.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the Secretary-General’s\r\ndecision to set up a high-level panel of eminent\r\npersonalities to make recommendations on the reform\r\nof the Organization. It is our sincere hope that the\r\npanel will thoroughly review the workings of the\r\nSecurity Council with a view to recommending\r\nconcrete ways of reforming it, including with respect to\r\nthe veto. The Council must mirror the realities of the\r\nworld in the twenty-first century. It must also operate\r\non the Charter principle of equitable representation.\r\nFinally, let me commend the outgoing members of\r\nthe Council for the invaluable service they have rendered,\r\nand, in the same vein, wish the incoming members a\r\nmost successful and productive period of service.\r\nMr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan): At the outset,\r\nmy delegation would like to thank the President of the\r\nSecurity Council, Ambassador John Negroponte of the\r\nUnited States, for introducing the annual report of the\r\nSecurity Council (A/58/2).\r\nToday’s discussion of that important document has\r\nattracted the close attention of delegations. Last year, the\r\nMember States welcomed the improved format of the\r\nannual report, which was much shorter and, for the first\r\ntime ever, contained an analytical overview in its\r\nintroductory part. It marked the willingness of the\r\nSecurity Council to actively respond to the concerns\r\nexpressed by Member States over the years. In that\r\nrespect, we commend the United Kingdom and Spain\r\nfor their great efforts to streamline this year’s report\r\nand look forward to further improvements of its\r\nanalytical part in coming General Assembly sessions.\r\nThe Security Council has made a significant\r\ncontribution to the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. The report states that in the 12 months\r\nunder review the trend towards a steady increase in the\r\nworkload of the Council continued, along with an\r\nincrease in the trend towards transparency. The Security\r\nCouncil maintained its busy agenda on Africa, the\r\nMiddle East, Afghanistan and other important issues.\r\nThe Iraq file dominated the attention of the\r\nCouncil during the period covered by this report. We\r\nencourage the efforts made by the Security Council to\r\ndefine the role of the United Nations in assisting the\r\npeople of Iraq to rebuild their country and create a\r\nstable and secure environment.\r\nKazakhstan endorses the Security Council’s\r\ncontinuing efforts to address ongoing conflicts. We\r\nbelieve that United Nations peacekeeping operations\r\nconstitute one of the main elements of the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. They are one of the\r\nkey instruments available to the Security Council for\r\nthe settlement of conflicts and disputes.\r\nMy delegation notes the efforts of the Security\r\nCouncil to increase transparency in its work by holding\r\nan increased number of public meetings. We support\r\nthe thematic debates, which provide an opportunity for\r\nmembers and non-members of the Council to focus on\r\nissues of crucial importance. We must encourage those\r\npositive trends and try to take further steps in that\r\ndirection.\r\nHowever, we think that the continuing efforts of\r\nthe Security Council in the field of peace and security\r\nwould be more effective if it conducted more\r\ninteractive discussions between the Council members\r\nand non-members. We wish to see a reformed Security\r\nCouncil, open to dialogue and sending the international\r\ncommunity a clear message that it stands ready to meet\r\nthe new challenges.\r\nMy delegation would like to express its appreciation\r\nto Ambassador Greenstock and to the present Chairman\r\nof the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), Ambassador\r\nArias, for their leadership in steering the activities of the\r\nCommittee. The CTC has continued to work intensively\r\nto fulfil its mandate as set out in resolution 1373 (2001)\r\nby deepening its dialogue with Member States and with\r\nregional and subregional organizations. Kazakhstan is\r\ncommitted to supporting the CTC and to the effective\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001). We hope that a multilateral approach will be taken\r\nin our future actions against international terrorism.\r\nThe Committee established pursuant to resolution\r\n1267 (1999) has continued to focus its work on the\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nneed to address the threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity posed by terrorism. Security Council resolution\r\n1455 (2003) has enhanced the role of the Committee in a\r\nnumber of areas and has improved the implementation by\r\nMember States of the sanctions regime imposed on Al\r\nQaeda, the Taliban and other associated groups and\r\nindividuals. Kazakhstan is among 66 States that\r\nsubmitted their reports on the implementation of\r\nresolution 1455 (2003). My Government will continue\r\nto cooperate fully with the Committee and give all\r\npossible support to this important body.\r\nKazakhstan supports the continuing efforts by the\r\nsanctions committees to improve their working\r\nmethods, thus increasing transparency and effective\r\nfulfilment of their mandates.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is part of the\r\ncommitment our leaders made during the Millennium\r\nSummit. For that reason, it is highly important to\r\nresume the negotiations on Security Council reform.\r\nWe believe that at the fifty-eighth session the President\r\nwill bring the negotiation process back to life in the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group in order to reach a\r\ncomprehensive package agreement on Council reform.\r\nWe also look forward to receiving\r\nrecommendations from the Secretary-General on the\r\nmain aspects of strengthening the United Nations\r\nsystem, including the reform of the Security Council,\r\nbased on the work of the high-level panel that the\r\nSecretary-General intends to establish.\r\nIt is essential to strengthen the ability of the main\r\nUnited Nations body to respond effectively to the\r\nglobal challenges of the twenty-first century. We must\r\nwork together to enable it to confront those challenges\r\nin the area of peace and security in a much more\r\ncomprehensive and effective manner.\r\nMr. Maria Caceres (Paraguay) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The two items on our agenda — the report of\r\nthe Security Council and the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council and related matters — are very\r\nclosely interrelated, and thus we consider that they\r\nhave a common objective, namely, a more democratic,\r\nrepresentative, transparent and more effective Security\r\nCouncil in the face of the challenges of today’s world.\r\nAllow me to congratulate the President of the\r\nSecurity Council for this month, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the United States, for his introduction\r\nof the annual report of the Council, and the delegations\r\nof the United Kingdom and Spain for having drafted\r\nthe introduction, which is one of the most interesting\r\nsections of the report.\r\nIn this past year the Security Council has been\r\nthrough critical times and has had difficulties\r\nexercising the responsibilities that the Charter assigns\r\nto that body, an organ indispensable for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Thus,\r\nthe two items we are considering are more than ever\r\nbefore priorities on our agenda. Their consideration by\r\nMember States must not be a mere formality, but must\r\nbe the reaffirmation of the responsibilities of this\r\nAssembly on issues of fundamental importance for the\r\nentire United Nations membership.\r\nMember States have the right and duty to know\r\nand fully analyse the Council’s work, since the Council\r\nacts on the behalf of all in accordance with the\r\nresponsibilities granted to it by the Charter.\r\nFor the second consecutive year, the Security\r\nCouncil report to the Assembly shows considerable\r\nprogress in terms of format and content, compared with\r\nprevious reports. The introductory summary facilitates\r\na better idea of the work, but the report does not yet\r\nexactly reflect the amount or the importance of the\r\nCouncil’s work. Such efforts by the Council to improve\r\nits report must continue and be encouraged so that the\r\nreport may truly be the useful and substantive document\r\nthat all the Members would like, rather than a simple\r\ndescription of decisions that do not reflect the positions\r\nor discussions which took place in the Council.\r\nWe realize that in recent years there has been\r\nsome progress in the Council’s working methods that\r\nhas led to greater transparency in the work. Efforts to\r\nhold more public meetings and the briefings by the\r\nPresident of the Council at the end of closed meetings\r\nrepresent considerable progress. Also, the public\r\nevaluation sessions at the end of the month and\r\nmeetings with troop-contributing countries — most of\r\nwhich are not members of the Council — are\r\nmeaningful steps forward which should be formalized.\r\nIn addition, we highlight the briefings to non-members\r\non the Council’s travels to the field.\r\nHowever, as can be seen from this report, it is\r\nstill far from being the document we all desire. Most of\r\nthe Council’s deliberations take place during informal\r\nconsultations behind closed doors. As an example, we\r\nbelieve that reports submitted by the Secretariat should\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nbe considered in public meetings, with non-members\r\ninvited to participate, rather than in meetings behind\r\nclosed doors, as usually happens.\r\nWe also believe that after more than 50 years of\r\nprovisional rules of procedure of the Council, the rules\r\nshould become permanent, as is the case with the rules\r\nof other bodies of the United Nations.\r\nAnother issue that seems fundamental to us is\r\nimproving communication and interaction between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, as well as\r\nwith other organs of the Organization. In this connection,\r\nwe think it is indispensable that the President of the\r\nSecurity Council submit to the General Assembly not\r\nonly an annual report, but, whenever necessary, special\r\nreports, for instance on priority issues which emerge\r\nfrom current concerns or specific situations which are\r\non the minds of all Member States, such as the events\r\nof recent months. This is in conformity with what is\r\nstipulated in Article 24 of the Charter.\r\nWe hope that the views expressed in this debate\r\nby Member States that are not members of the Security\r\nCouncil will be taken into account by the permanent\r\nmembers of the Council in order to improve the\r\ndialogue between the two bodies and to improve the\r\nCouncil’s work.\r\nThe presentation of the report of the Council\r\nshould not be a simple formality to comply with our\r\nagenda. It should be a genuine and sincere review of its\r\nactivities, including difficulties encountered as the\r\nactivities take place.\r\nMy delegation is of the view that in order to\r\nachieve true improvement in the work and activities of\r\nthe Security Council, Council reform can no longer be\r\npostponed. This is the very objective pursued by the\r\nreform process. We would like to enhance the\r\nCouncil’s efficiency and effectiveness and improve its\r\nworking methods. The Council must be democratic,\r\nrepresentative, fair, transparent and in keeping with the\r\nreality of today. It must respond to the entire\r\nmembership of the United Nations. Its working\r\nmethods must provide and demonstrate greater\r\ntransparency and participation, and its composition\r\nshould represent the political realities of today’s world.\r\nParaguay understands that there is general\r\nagreement among Member States on the need to reform\r\nthe Security Council. The position of Paraguay on this\r\nissue has been expressed on repeated occasions. It is\r\nnecessary to expand both categories of members and to\r\ninclude developed countries as well as developing\r\ncountries, bearing in mind especially that the latter are\r\nunderrepresented at present.\r\nLikewise, a key issue of the reform which must\r\nbe analysed is the question of the veto power flaunted\r\nby the permanent members. We must aspire to gradual\r\nelimination of the veto power until it completely\r\ndisappears. A first step should be to limit it strictly to\r\nquestions under Chapter VII of the Charter. Likewise,\r\nwe should leave open the possibility of a periodic\r\nreview of the reform in order to consider the\r\nfunctioning of the Security Council in keeping with\r\nfuture realities and requirements.\r\nTen years after the establishment of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on Security Council Reform,\r\nthere has been very little progress on important\r\nquestions so that the reform may be carried out. Today\r\nwe must shoulder our responsibilities and take the\r\npolitical decision to show real progress and achieve the\r\nobjectives desired by most Member States. In this\r\nconnection, we place our confidence in the leadership\r\nof the President of the General Assembly, and we hope\r\nthat, in the next few months, we will find a way to\r\nmove this process forward and achieve the outcome\r\nthat we all have anticipated for so long.\r\nI should to conclude by saying that no reform of\r\nthe United Nations will have the effect we all wish for\r\nwithout the long-awaited reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, so long as it does not take place we cannot\r\nreally speak of a United Nations that is in keeping with\r\nthe times in which we are living — one that will truly\r\nmeet the interests and aspirations of the entire\r\ninternational community.\r\nMr. Chidumo (Mozambique): My delegation\r\nwelcomes the debate on the report of the Security\r\nCouncil and on the question of equitable representation\r\non and increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and related matters.\r\nWe thank the President of the Security Council,\r\nAmbassador John Negroponte of the United States, for\r\nhis introductory remarks on the work of the Security\r\nCouncil during the period under review.\r\nThe report of the Security Council contains an\r\nintroductory section and a listing of meetings,\r\ncommunications received from Member States, and of\r\nresolutions and other decisions adopted by the Council.\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nWe wish to take note of the rather new format of the\r\nreport, with the hope that further work will be done to\r\nimprove it in future.\r\nThe annual report should be more than a mere\r\nlisting of meetings. More importantly, it should continue\r\nto strive to provide a detailed analytical account of the\r\nCouncil’s proceedings and should contain substantive\r\ninformation on the environment in which discussions\r\nare held and on the decisions arrived at in the Security\r\nCouncil, as stated earlier by several speakers. Such a\r\nsubstantive report would contribute to a better\r\nunderstanding of Council affairs, enable Member States to\r\ntake informed decisions and further bridge the gap\r\nbetween members and non-members of the Council.\r\nThis underlines the need for reform in order to\r\nensure openness, inclusiveness, democratization,\r\ntransparency and accountability, and to restore the\r\ncredibility of the Security Council vis-à-vis Member\r\nStates and world public opinion.\r\nThe report before us shows that the bulk of the\r\nwork of the Security Council continued to be on\r\nAfrica, with Iraq, the Middle East and terrorism as\r\nother areas of critical intervention. The Security\r\nCouncil should continue to work to ensure that its\r\ndecisions on Africa are commensurate with the time\r\nand effort it dedicates to the continent. This includes\r\nacting as expeditiously as possible on any possible\r\nthreat to peace and security on the continent. This\r\nwould have been the recommended course of action,\r\nfor instance, in cases such as that of Liberia and the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. For it to act in such\r\na way would contribute to lessening the concerns\r\nexpressed in the past by Member States with regard to\r\nspecific conflicts that have emerged on our continent.\r\nThe Council should not wait until a situation\r\ndeteriorates to take action. Now that robust mandates\r\nhave been decided by the Council, it is imperative to\r\nsecure their implementation.\r\nIn the case of Liberia, within the framework of\r\nthe implementation of the existing mandate, due\r\nattention should be given to the issue of the mercenary\r\nforces involved in that country’s conflict, whose\r\nnegative action is on record as having endangered\r\npeace processes elsewhere in West Africa. The\r\ninauguration of the Transitional Government, which\r\ntook place recently, is an encouraging sign that the\r\npeace effort in Liberia, if properly supported, can and\r\nwill be successful.\r\nThe recent positive developments in Burundi,\r\nwhich have enabled the signing of yet another\r\nimportant agreement between the Government and the\r\nNational Council for the Defence of Democracy-Forces\r\nfor the Defence of Democracy (CNDD-FDD), should\r\nbe encouraged through the adoption by the Security\r\nCouncil of a draft resolution endorsing the African\r\nMission in Burundi. An early involvement of the\r\nSecurity Council is not only desirable but also a\r\nnecessity in order for it to support the African Union in\r\nits quest to settle the conflict in that country. By doing\r\nso, the Security Council would be meeting the\r\nexpectations of the international community.\r\nFor all these reasons, reforming the Security\r\nCouncil is imperative. The democratization and\r\nexpansion of that body should be accorded the highest\r\npriority in order to reflect the current geopolitical\r\nsituation.\r\nIn his statement of 23 September 2003, the\r\nSecretary-General reminded us that the debate over the\r\ncomposition of the Security has been with us for over a\r\ndecade, and that we almost all agree that the Council\r\nshould be enlarged. He reminded us also that the\r\ndifficulties we face in reaching agreement on this issue\r\ndo not excuse our failure to do so. We could not agree\r\nmore with the Secretary-General. The question is, are\r\nMember States ready to listen to the Secretary-General\r\nand to heed their own words?\r\nIn the process of reviewing the composition of\r\nthe Security Council, the criteria for expansion should\r\nnot be restrictive, but, rather, representative and\r\nequitable. In this context, we should not be oriented\r\nonly by the military and economic power of the\r\ncandidates. Other elements, such as moral authority,\r\nequitable geographical representation, the need to\r\nensure fair representation of developing countries, and\r\ncommitment to the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security should be taken into account.\r\nIn the current composition of the Security Council,\r\nAfrica is the most underrepresented continent. We\r\ntherefore reiterate the African position that, in order for\r\nAfrica to have its fair share of seats on the Security\r\nCouncil, our continent should be allocated two permanent\r\nseats, with the same rights as the current permanent\r\nmembers, and two additional non-permanent seats.\r\nThe lack of progress in the decade-long debate\r\nover Security Council reform has done immense\r\ndamage to the credibility of the Council itself. The\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nresponsibility for breaking the prevailing stalemate lies\r\nentirely with those Member States that have so far\r\nfailed to show the necessary political will, flexibility\r\nand pragmatism to come up with a new formula that\r\naccommodates everyone’s interests.\r\nThe new challenges before the international\r\ncommunity in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security compel us all to combine our efforts\r\ntowards undertaking the much-needed reforms. Let us\r\nseize the momentum and make a difference in the\r\nfuture of our Organization.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): In making some\r\nbrief points on the annual report of the Security\r\nCouncil before the General Assembly, we must first\r\ncomment on organizational matters that seem quite\r\nimportant to us. Like others, we are disappointed to see\r\nthat the General Assembly has reverted to its old practice\r\nof having separate debates on the report of the Council\r\nand on Security Council reform. Given the overlap in\r\nsubstance between the two items and the good\r\nexperience we had last year with a joint debate, we find\r\nit hard to understand this change in practice, especially\r\nin the light of the urgent need for the General\r\nAssembly to engage in a radical and effective reform.\r\nThe report itself is more concise and thus more\r\naccessible than on some occasions in the past. That is\r\nthe result of an important effort by the Council and should\r\nhelp to advance the interaction between the two bodies,\r\nwhich we believe should become more substantial and\r\nmeaningful over time. A number of useful suggestions\r\nhave been made during the course of the debate. I\r\nwould like in particular to refer to the statement made\r\nearlier by the representative of Paraguay.\r\nThe Council is clearly looking back at one of its\r\nmost difficult years, due in particular to the profound\r\ndisagreements among Council members on the right\r\ncourse of action concerning Iraq. Rarely has the work\r\nof the Council been followed with more public interest\r\nthan in the past few months — and rarely have more\r\npeople turned away from the Council in frustration and\r\ndisappointment. The time has thus clearly come for us\r\nto rethink the established mechanisms in the area of\r\ninternational peace and security, and we are all\r\nindebted to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\r\ninitiative to establish a panel of eminent persons to\r\nlaunch and inspire this process.\r\nWe continue to believe very strongly in the\r\ntransparency and accountability of the Council with\r\nregard to the membership as a whole. Again, the Council\r\nhas taken important steps over the years in this area,\r\nfundamentally changing its relationship with States that\r\nare not members of the Council. The informal briefings\r\nand increasing number of open debates on a variety of\r\ntopics are positive steps, and wrap-up sessions have\r\nalso proved to be useful in this respect. At the same\r\ntime, the character of the work of the Council has also\r\nchanged, in that it takes increasingly far-reaching\r\ndecisions, including decisions which directly affect the\r\nlives of individuals who have no means of recourse or\r\nappeal. It is thus all the more important that the Council\r\nbe accountable for its decisions towards the membership\r\nas a whole — on behalf of which, after all, it is acting.\r\nWe warmly welcomed the initiative of the United\r\nKingdom, during its presidency last month, to engage\r\nthe Council in a process during which it will look\r\nclosely into the issue of justice and the rule of law,\r\nwithout impinging on the role that other bodies will\r\ncontinue to play in this respect. Indeed, we believe that\r\nthe imperative of the rule of law needs to be\r\nemphasized in the strongest possible terms — at both\r\nthe national and international levels — at a time when\r\nmultilateralism is more urgently needed and more\r\nforcefully challenged than ever.\r\nAs a guardian of the rule of law, the Council must\r\nalso look into its own decisions and ensure that they\r\nare at all times fully consistent with the relevant\r\nprovisions of international law, in particular, of course,\r\nthe United Nations Charter. It is thus regrettable that\r\nduring the past year the Council again made a decision\r\nthat clearly does not fulfil that criterion by adopting\r\nresolution 1487 (2003). We believe that that resolution\r\nis likely to do damage to the credibility of the Council\r\nin the long term, and thus hope that it will refrain from\r\nrenewing it next summer.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on this agenda item.\r\nI would like to inform representatives that, in\r\naccordance with General Assembly resolutions 47/233,\r\n48/264 and 51/241, I intend to make a summary of the\r\ndebate on this agenda item immediately following the\r\nconclusion of our consideration of agenda item 56, the\r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and related matters.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of agenda item 11.\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nAgenda item 56\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters\r\nMr. Listre (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): This\r\ndebate is taking place at a critical moment for the\r\nOrganization. Confidence in the capacity of the United\r\nNations to resolve the most serious global problems\r\nhas been weakened and damaged.\r\nThe international community is facing a number\r\nof difficult issues regarding the future of the\r\nmultilateral and collective security system embodied\r\nby this Organization. It must either choose to trust the\r\nUnited Nations to resolve the most important global\r\nissues or conclude that the Organization is being\r\nbrushed aside by the force of events.\r\nThe international community must respond to this\r\nchallenge through a process of sincere and profound\r\nreflection. We do not have all of the answers, but we\r\nare convinced that the one idea that cannot be called\r\ninto question is respect for the guiding principle that\r\nled to the birth of the United Nations: a democratic\r\ncommitment by all of the peoples of the world to peace\r\nand security.\r\nDespite the fact that that objective has not been\r\nfully achieved, that idea has had sufficient power to\r\nkeep this Organization alive for more than half a\r\ncentury. It is an objective that is shared by the\r\ncountries from all continents, cultures and civilizations\r\nthat together make up the United Nations.\r\nIt is clear that in order to reaffirm that objective\r\nand turn the United Nations into an effective\r\ninstrument, the Organization must be reformed.\r\nLikewise, it is evident that the reform exercise must\r\nrender it even more democratic and reaffirm its\r\nlegitimacy and its ability to bring people together.\r\nThat democratic commitment cannot be overlooked\r\nwhen it comes to the reform of the Security Council. Fifty\r\nyears have elapsed since the system of collective security\r\nwas defined. The international system is not the same\r\ntoday as it was in 1945. When the United Nations was\r\ncreated, a system was established according to which\r\nfive Powers had a privileged position with regard to\r\ncollective security. That was not democratic, and\r\nArgentina questioned it at the time. It was a response,\r\nhowever, to a particular balance of power. Today, the\r\nbalance of power is radically different.\r\nWe need to reform the Security Council, which\r\nhas lost a great deal of its representative capacity and\r\neffectiveness. The paradox, however, is that some of\r\nthe proposals that we have heard about during the\r\nreform exercise, rather than making that body more\r\ndemocratic, advocate the retention of privileges and the\r\ncreation of new ones.\r\nToday we are witness to a Council in which very\r\ndelicate issues — issues that affect global peace and\r\nthat could lead to the endangering of key principles of\r\ninternational law and have a serious impact on the\r\nUnited Nations — are discussed in an exclusive and\r\nexclusionary manner by the permanent members.\r\nTransparency is absent from the Council — even for\r\nmost of its members.\r\nNevertheless, some proposals claim that the solution\r\nis to create new permanent members. Some propose\r\nincreasing the number of permanent members, with new\r\nmembers having the same rights as current members; that\r\nis to say, with the privilege of the veto. They argue that\r\nsome countries aspiring to that category of membership\r\nin fact contribute more to the Organization and are\r\nmore powerful, than some of the permanent members\r\nthat obtained the privilege of the veto in 1945.\r\nOthers, being more resigned — or more realistic —\r\nwould be happy with a permanent seat without the\r\nprivilege of the veto. Should that idea prevail, we would\r\nhave a Security Council with three classes of members,\r\nmuch like passengers on a plane. Some — the five\r\npermanent members — would travel first class. Others —\r\npermanent members without the right of the veto —\r\nwould travel in business class. Lastly, non-permanent\r\nmembers would travel in coach. Can that classification\r\nstand up to the test of legitimacy and equity? Could the\r\npeoples of the United Nations referred to in the\r\npreamble to the Charter trust an organization based on\r\nsuch new inequalities?\r\nA few days ago, while addressing the follow-up\r\nto the outcome of the Millennium Summit, I said that\r\n“the legitimacy lent by the United Nations is its\r\nprincipal asset” (A/58/PV.25). We believe that we\r\ncannot tamper with that asset, as it is what justifies the\r\nvery existence of the United Nations.\r\nThere is no justification for the current aristocratic\r\nstructure of the Security Council. No reasons have been\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\ncited to convince us that a solution of that nature would\r\nbring more legitimacy and effectiveness to the United\r\nNations. The least democratic and least transparent\r\nbody of the United Nations will not be improved if we\r\naccentuate its lack of democracy.\r\nIt should be recalled that, as Article 24 of the\r\nCharter sets out, those who make up the Security\r\nCouncil represent us all, and not themselves alone. It\r\nshould also be understood that we elect them\r\nperiodically and democratically to act in our name, and\r\nthat their representative character and the temporary\r\nnature of their mandates provide our guarantee. It is for\r\nthat reason that, like many other countries, Argentina\r\nmaintains that in enlarging the Security Council it is\r\nnecessary to increase the number of non-permanent\r\nmembers, which are the ones who represent us with\r\ngreater authenticity, and over which we may exercise\r\ngreater control. Not to understand that would take us\r\nback five decades. It would be an assault on the idea of\r\ndemocracy, upon which we based ourselves 50 years\r\nago so that we could live together in peace.\r\nWe understand that reforming the Security\r\nCouncil cannot be a partial undertaking; nor can it fail\r\nto address the veto and the prevailing position of some\r\nof its members. The working methods, transparency,\r\ninformal meetings and practices of the Council should\r\nbe addressed and resolved along with the question of\r\nthe enlargement of its membership.\r\nMy country has always maintained that there is a\r\nneed to eliminate the veto. However, in order to be\r\nrealistic and to make a constructive effort, we accept\r\npostponing that goal for the moment and limiting the\r\nveto to issues falling under Chapter VII of the Charter\r\nfor the time being.\r\nWe have worked for 10 years in the General\r\nAssembly’s Open-ended Working Group to try to find a\r\nsolution to this issue. That work has reflected the\r\npoints of view of all nations, since all of them have\r\nbeen represented in the Group. No country has been\r\nexcluded. It cannot be said that the results achieved by\r\nthe Working Group do not clearly reflect the thinking\r\nof the international community as a whole. If there was\r\nno agreement in the Group, it was because no such\r\nagreement exists among nations. That agreement will\r\nnot exist until we accept that the Security Council’s\r\nnon-permanent membership must be enlarged and that\r\nthe veto should be, at the very least, restricted.\r\nToday it is possible to look at all the possible\r\nways of finding alternatives. We can, and should,\r\nengage the thoughts of the international community to\r\ncome up with other formulas. We therefore welcome\r\nthe concerns of the Secretary-General, as well as his\r\ndecision to establish a group of thinkers. This is a\r\ncrucial moment, and it is necessary to summon all\r\npoints of view in this exercise. But it should be clear\r\nthat the result of this effort should be reviewed by the\r\nGeneral Assembly, which is the only body that can take\r\na decision on reform.\r\nForcing the issue by taking the solution to this\r\nproblem out of the hands of the General Assembly and\r\nits Working Group is what should not happen. We do\r\nnot believe that there can be a solution that does not\r\nemerge from consensus, or that has a goal other than\r\nmaking the Security Council more democratic and\r\nmore effective. Argentina will participate in a\r\nconciliatory spirit to achieve those goals.\r\nMr. Haraguchi (Japan): Let me first of all thank\r\nthe former President of the General Assembly, Mr. Jan\r\nKavan of the Czech Republic, for his work in\r\nefficiently conducting the work of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on Security Council reform during the\r\nprevious session. I also express my gratitude to\r\nAmbassador Ingólfsson of Iceland and Ambassador\r\nKasemsarn of Thailand for their preparation of the\r\nWorking Group’s comprehensive report. It is a pity that\r\nwe are losing those able colleagues from the Working\r\nGroup, as both are leaving New York. I sincerely wish\r\nthem success in their future endeavours.\r\nIn the process of discussing the situation in Iraq\r\nover the past year, questions have been raised as to the\r\neffectiveness of the Security Council with regard to its\r\nprimary role of maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity. Those questions added greater momentum to\r\nthe discussion on the need for Security Council reform\r\nthan we have seen before. In his address to member\r\ncountries at the opening of the general debate during\r\nthis session of General Assembly, Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan stated that\r\n“If you want the ... Council’s decisions to\r\ncommand greater respect, particularly in the\r\ndeveloping world, you need to address the issue\r\nof its composition with greater urgency.”\r\n(A/58/PV.7, p. 4)\r\nStatements from Member States followed in the\r\ngeneral debate, and more than two-thirds of them\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\ntouched upon the need for United Nations reform,\r\nincluding that of the Security Council. That figure\r\nstrongly indicates the increasing momentum on this\r\nissue.\r\nOn reviewing the discussions in the Working\r\nGroup, which started 10 years ago, it is regrettable that\r\nwe do not see any significant progress or any way out\r\nof the deadlock, despite the fact that the necessary\r\nelements to reach general agreement on Security\r\nCouncil reform are already on the table. Former\r\nPresident Kavan stated in his summary of the responses\r\nto the informal questionnaire that, “with one exception,\r\nall Member States that responded found the movement\r\nof the Working Group unsatisfactory”.\r\nJapan also expresses its strong dissatisfaction\r\nwith the current lack of progress in the Working Group.\r\nWe have to recognize that most of the responsibility for\r\nthe stalemate lies with the Working Group itself.\r\nLeaving the current situation as it is will call into\r\nquestion the ability of the United Nations to adjust\r\nitself to challenges in the world. As the Working Group\r\nis the only body established by the General Assembly\r\nto discuss Security Council reform, we must make our\r\nutmost effort to achieve concrete results in the Working\r\nGroup during this session. Japan believes that, if we\r\ncannot make any progress in the next meeting of the\r\nWorking Group, it may be necessary to review the way\r\nthe Working Group manages its discussions. In that\r\nconnection, Japan looks forward to the leadership of\r\nthe new President, Mr. Julian Hunte, as Chairman of\r\nthe Working Group, and of its new Bureau. I should\r\nalso like to add that Japan will try its best to present\r\nnew ideas to assist in the process and to promote\r\ndiscussion in the Working Group.\r\nI would be remiss if I failed to mention the\r\nSecretary-General’s initiative to establish a high-level\r\npanel of eminent personalities. Japan supports that\r\ninitiative and will be following developments with\r\ngreat interest. Although it is the Member States that\r\ncan take firm and clear decisions, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral pointed out in his statement, I expect\r\nsubstantive recommendations to be made with regard\r\nto United Nations reforms that address Security\r\nCouncil reform in particular. Japan intends to\r\ncontribute as much as possible to this initiative.\r\nThe Secretary-General also makes a strong case\r\nfor United Nations reform in his report on\r\nimplementation of the United Nations Millennium\r\nDeclaration (A/58/323). He proposes that we set 2005\r\nas a deadline for reaching agreement on the changes\r\nthat are needed in our international institutions if they\r\nare to meet the new challenges, because 2005 not only\r\nmarks the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the\r\nUnited Nations but is also the year in which a review\r\nof progress in implementing the Millennium\r\nDeclaration will take place. Japan takes that proposal\r\nvery seriously. Japan believes — as our Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, Ms. Yoriko Kawaguchi, said in her\r\nstatement during the general debate, on 23 September\r\n(see A/58/PV.8) — that a political decision should be\r\ntaken on the occasion of such a review by holding a\r\nmeeting of heads of State or Government regarding\r\nreform of the United Nations, and of the Security\r\nCouncil in particular.\r\nThe perpetuation of the same basic Security\r\nCouncil structure as that of 60 years ago leads many to\r\nquestion the legitimacy of the system under which the\r\nUnited Nations operates. I should like to urge that all\r\nMember States take concrete action to strengthen the\r\nfunctioning of the Organization and thereby to restore\r\nits legitimacy. Japan reaffirms its determination to play\r\na positive role to that end.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nOnce again, for the eleventh consecutive year, the\r\nGeneral Assembly is considering the issue of reforming\r\nthe Security Council and expanding its membership. I\r\ndo not wish to reiterate the positions that our\r\nstatements have reflected over the past 10 years. Of\r\ncourse, certain parameters of the Egyptian position\r\nremain unchanged: we endorse the position of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement with regard to expanding Council\r\nmembership — reiterated at non-aligned summit\r\nconferences in 1995, 1996 and 1997 — that the Council\r\nshould comprise at least 26 permanent and non-\r\npermanent members, with the possibility of expanding\r\nthe non-permanent membership. That is in addition to\r\nimprovements in the Council’s working methods based\r\non mutual understanding. Egypt also fully supports the\r\nAfrican position, expressed at the Harare Summit,\r\ncalling for seven African seats — including two\r\npermanent seats — on an expanded Council, with those\r\ntwo seats held on a rotating basis.\r\nI wish to recall General Assembly resolution\r\n53/30, adopted in November 1998, which stipulated\r\nthat any resolution or decision on the question of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and related matters\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nwould require the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of\r\nthe members of the Assembly, in conformity with Article\r\n108 of the Charter. The Open-ended Working Group on\r\nSecurity Council reform is prepared to reconsider this\r\nissue. However, there are a number of questions that\r\nwe consider crucial if we wish the Working Group’s\r\ndeliberations to be truly successful. Among those\r\nessential questions are the following.\r\nFirst, does the extreme slowness of the Working\r\nGroup’s deliberations mean that Member States accept the\r\nCouncil’s working methods and mechanisms as they\r\ncurrently exist, or is there an underlying awareness of\r\nthe need for reform of those working methods?\r\nSecondly, should we wait for double standards\r\nand selectivity to become the Security Council’s\r\nstandard practice when it addresses international peace\r\nand security issues, or is it time for the Council to\r\nconsider all threats to international peace and security\r\non an equal footing, whatever the parties involved or\r\nwhatever the prevailing political balances?\r\nThirdly, does the Council’s current composition\r\ntruly and accurately reflect the existing strategic\r\nbalance, or is it true that, over approximately the past\r\n60 years, certain forces have emerged while others\r\nhave receded, and certain blocs have collapsed while\r\nothers have appeared — and that all those realities\r\nneed to be taken into account in the Council?\r\nFourthly, can the Council, as currently composed,\r\ntruly maintain international peace and security?\r\nFifthly, is the Council truly carrying out the mission\r\nentrusted to it under the Charter in accordance with the\r\nprinciples established by the Charter — that is, the\r\nprinciples of international law and the rules of justice?\r\nSixthly, and most important — has the experience\r\nof the past six months demonstrated that the Security\r\nCouncil is truly an effective instrument for ensuring\r\ninternational peace and security and for guaranteeing\r\nthe independence and sovereignty of States, or has it\r\ndemonstrated the Council’s weakness and the urgent\r\nneed for reform?\r\nIn addition to those questions — which directly\r\nconcern the Council and its performance — there are\r\nothers of more general import that we, as Members of\r\nthe United Nations, need to answer before we can agree\r\non any expansion of the Council. Among those\r\nquestions, I would note the following.\r\nFirst, do the current balance of power and the role\r\nplayed by various parties make it possible to reform\r\nand expand the Council in a balanced manner so as to\r\nguarantee the rights of developing and developed\r\ncountries on equal footing, or will the current\r\ninternational situation lead to the creation of a Council\r\nthat is even more paralysed and less capable of acting\r\nthan the current one?\r\nSecondly, do we all really want to see\r\nsimultaneous reform of and increase in the membership\r\nof the Council, or do some of us want only to expand\r\nthe Council, others simply to reform it and still others\r\nneither to reform nor expand it?\r\nThirdly, do all parties demonstrate genuine\r\npolitical will and determination to agree on a package for\r\nthe reform and expansion of the Council that combines\r\njustice in seat distribution and in the representation of all\r\nregional groups, while guaranteeing the Council’s\r\ntransparency, objectivity and neutrality?\r\nIn Egypt’s statement today, we sought more to\r\nask questions than to provide answers. I hope that these\r\nquestions will give rise to a serious debate on the\r\nunderlying philosophy of reform and on our real goals.\r\nIndeed, we fear that the last 10 years of debate in the\r\nWorking Group may have added more confusion to the\r\nissue of reform.\r\nMr. Al-Otaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nissue the Assembly is discussing today is clearly one of\r\nthe most important items on its agenda, namely, the\r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters. We have been informed of the outcome of the\r\nlengthy meetings and debates that were conducted by\r\nthe Working Group since last year. I would like to\r\nexpress our admiration to Mr. Jan Kavan, the former\r\nChairman, and his two Vice-Chairs for their efforts and\r\nfor having presided over the discussions so well.\r\nThe discussions in the Working Group have\r\ndemonstrated the urgent need to reorganize the\r\nSecurity Council and to give greater transparency to its\r\nworking methods. All the working papers submitted by\r\nmany countries and organizations from the various\r\nregional groups to the Working Group and its\r\nChairman agreed that Council reform is necessary to\r\nstrengthen that body’s ability to maintain international\r\npeace and security and to meet the challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nDespite agreement among Member States on the\r\nprinciples of reform and change, the Working Group,\r\nafter 10 years, has been unable to agree on the nature\r\nof the changes in question, on the number of seats by\r\nwhich to increase the membership or on how to\r\nimprove the working methods of the Council. It is\r\nregrettable that the debates of the past few years have\r\nbeen repetitive. We are in a vicious circle; we must all\r\nthink seriously about how to revitalize the mechanisms\r\nof the Working Group itself.\r\nBut we cannot ignore the progress that has taken\r\nplace in the Working Group’s discussions, especially as\r\nregards the Council’s working methods. There is near-\r\ngeneral agreement on a number of measures and\r\nprovisions that the Council should adopt. Furthermore,\r\nthe Council itself has already started to implement certain\r\nmethods and procedures. But we are only at the beginning\r\nof this process, and we stress that we support the\r\nSecretary-General’s invitation to invest this item with the\r\ngreatest possible importance so that decisions would have\r\nwider acceptance, especially by developing countries.\r\nKuwait has repeatedly stated its position on the\r\nincrease in the membership of the Council and on\r\nimproving its working methods. We have done so\r\nunilaterally and through various groups, in particular\r\nthe Arab Group and the Non-Aligned Movement. The\r\nAssembly’s debate on this item provides us with a good\r\nopportunity to stress the following fundamental\r\nprinciples.\r\nFirst, Kuwait supports an increase in the Security\r\nCouncil membership, provided that this is moderate,\r\nwith a view to preserving the effectiveness and\r\nefficiency of the Council’s work and decision-making in\r\nthe face of challenges to international peace and security.\r\nSecond, the increase should be consistent with the\r\nprinciples of the sovereign equality of Member States\r\nand equitable geographical representation; it must also\r\nreflect the global character of the United Nations.\r\nThird, with regard to the increase of permanent\r\nseats in the Security Council, we support a limited\r\nincrease and consider that such seats should go to\r\ncountries that have truly demonstrated, in their\r\nrelationship with the United Nations, the ability to\r\ndischarge primary responsibilities, such as maintenance\r\nof international peace and security, and to fulfil the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter in the economic,\r\nsocial, political and cultural arenas. Countries should\r\nbe elected to these additional seats by the members of\r\nthe General Assembly, in accordance with agreed\r\ncriteria and procedures.\r\nFourth, with regard to the reform and\r\nimprovement of the working methods of the Council,\r\nwe favour proposals that would promote greater\r\ntransparency and a freer two-way flow of information\r\nbetween the Council and the United Nations\r\nmembership at large. In this context, we stress the\r\nimportance of implementing measures adopted by the\r\nSecurity Council itself to improve its working methods,\r\nwithout waiting for agreement on other issues such as\r\nthe size and composition of the Council and the\r\ndecision-making process.\r\nFifth, we favour the retention of the current\r\nmethod of selecting the non-permanent members on the\r\nbasis of Article 23, paragraph 2, of the Charter, so that\r\nsmaller countries have a greater opportunity to gain\r\nmembership and to contribute to the Council’s work.\r\nSixth, with regard to the veto, bearing in mind the\r\ndifficulty and sensitivity of the issue, we note that the\r\ndiscussions in the Working Group show that there is\r\nnear-unanimous agreement on the need to limit and\r\nrestrict the use of the veto power. There are many\r\nimportant proposals in that connection, which require\r\nfurther consideration. We hope that it will be possible\r\nto reach a consensus that is acceptable to all countries\r\nand that would help the Council carry out its duties.\r\nFinally, we stress our support for the decision of\r\nthe Secretary-General to establish a group of eminent\r\npersonalities to consider and review the working\r\nmethods of the principal organs of the United Nations,\r\nas we hope this will help to generate the necessary\r\nmomentum to reach consensus on the Security Council\r\nreform, so that the Council can best maintain\r\ninternational peace and security and deal with the\r\nchallenges of the next century.\r\nMr. Spatafora (Italy): Today’s debate addresses\r\none of the most controversial issues on the United\r\nNations reform agenda: the Security Council. As last\r\nweek’s debate underscored, the Security Council must\r\nalso be strengthened substantially and made more\r\nefficient and effective for United Nations reform to be\r\ntruly significant and complete. In other words, we need\r\na comprehensive reform of the Security Council in all\r\nits aspects.\r\nItaly’s position on the issue of Security Council\r\ncomposition is well known. We strongly believe that\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nthe current reform process should aim at enhancing the\r\nCouncil’s effectiveness and representative character,\r\ntogether with its legitimacy and credibility. Our\r\nconviction has been reinforced by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the follow-up to the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nLike many other United Nations members, we\r\nbelieve that the creation of new permanent seats would\r\nnot be in keeping with these objectives. As was stated\r\nlast week and again today, that would create new\r\ncentres of privilege. This would, therefore, go against\r\nthe tide of history, in which priority is given, and has to\r\nbe given, to an ongoing process of democratization in\r\nthe handling and the management of international\r\nrelations through multilateral institutions, so that every\r\nMember State, every member of this Assembly, will\r\nfeel more adequately represented and taken on board.\r\nWould this happen with the establishment of new\r\npermanent members which would not be accountable to\r\nthe electoral scrutiny of the membership? Certainly\r\nnot. And it would neither enhance the Council’s\r\nlegitimacy and representative character, nor improve\r\nthe effectiveness of its actions. Indeed, new permanent\r\nmembers endowed with veto power would undoubtedly\r\nmake it more difficult for the Council to swiftly define\r\nand implement collective actions, impairing the\r\neffectiveness of the Council’s decision-making process\r\nand increasing the risk of inaction. Comprehensive\r\nreform of the Security Council should, therefore, also\r\naddress the power and the exercise of veto.\r\nOn the other hand, the proposal aired by some to\r\nadd new permanent members without the right to veto\r\nalso entails serious drawbacks and would not increase the\r\ncohesion of United Nations membership. It would create\r\nfurther division in the Council membership and establish\r\na new layer of hierarchy that would be detrimental to the\r\nUnited Nations. Do we really want to have a first-class\r\nmembership, a second-class membership and a third-class\r\nmembership? The United Nations is not a corporate\r\nconcern, a company or a fund listed on a stock\r\nexchange, with class A, class B and class C shares.\r\nMoreover, let us be clear that any enlargement of\r\nthe Security Council, regardless of the composition it\r\nassumes, will be limited in number. The figure\r\ngenerally mentioned is between 20 and 25 or 26\r\nmembers. With a higher number of members, the\r\nSecurity Council would not be effective and efficient.\r\nWhat would result, it should be clear to all Member\r\nStates, would be a zero-sum game. If we increase the\r\nnumber of permanent members, there will be less room\r\nfor the rest of the membership who agree to the non-\r\npermanent seats. We would give, let us suppose, to five\r\nMember States, who would become permanent\r\nmembers, and thereby take away from what the\r\nremaining Member States have the right to expect\r\nregarding the possibility for them to offer a direct\r\ncontribution to shape the Security Council’s actions\r\nand policies.\r\nWe are all aware that the regional groups are\r\ndeeply divided over which of their countries should be\r\nelevated to permanent member status and are also aware\r\nthat they cannot agree on objective political criteria for\r\nselection. Ten years of debate have demonstrated that\r\nthese irreconcilable differences, which are deeply\r\nrooted in the geopolitical and historical realities of\r\neach continent, do not make the identification of new\r\npermanent members an option within reach.\r\nThe United Nations membership might decide\r\nthat, after 10 years of debate, it is now time to reach\r\nagreement on a formula that can build on common\r\nground and therefore be capable of gathering the\r\ngreatest support within the General Assembly. If so, the\r\nonly realistic formula would be a limited increase in the\r\nnumber of non-permanent members, for the time being.\r\nSuch an enlargement of the Council would\r\nincrease its representative character and, indeed, the\r\nlegitimacy of its actions in the eyes of the international\r\ncommunity. An increase of elective seats would\r\nfacilitate Council access and participation for all\r\nUnited Nations Member States. Furthermore, greater\r\nlegitimacy of Council decisions would make their\r\nimplementation more prompt, thus enhancing the\r\noverall effectiveness of the Council.\r\nOn the issue of representation, let me recall that\r\nback in 1993, Italy tabled a specific proposal,\r\naccording to which countries that shoulder the greatest\r\nresponsibilities in the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity, as well as for other purposes of our\r\nOrganization, could participate more frequently in the\r\nwork of the Council. That proposal remains on the\r\ntable. One could also contemplate a review of the\r\ncurrent ban on the immediate re-election of non-\r\npermanent members.\r\nIn light of the strong appeal launched by the\r\nSecretary-General on the need to reform the Security\r\nCouncil to enable it to face the new global challenges\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nto peace and security, Italy, of course, is also open to\r\nworking with other countries on possible innovative\r\nformulas, provided that they are balanced and reflect\r\nthe basic principles that inspire our approach.\r\nStill in my national capacity, let me add a few\r\ncomments on the European Union profile in the\r\nSecurity Council. The more the European Union\r\nbecomes a strong and cohesive international subject,\r\nthe more it will be able to provide valuable inputs to\r\nthe United Nations in general and to shaping Security\r\nCouncil deliberations.\r\nThe recently signed Joint Declaration on\r\nEuropean Union-United Nations cooperation in crisis\r\nmanagement is an example of the European Union’s\r\ndetermination to enhance its role in peace- and\r\nsecurity-related issues at the United Nations and to\r\nhelp the Organization achieve its goals.\r\nWe are working to fully implement European\r\nUnion-coordinated actions within international\r\norganizations, pursuant to the relevant European Union\r\nTreaty provisions. Realism should not prevent us from\r\nlooking forward. This process must be approached\r\ngradually, incrementally and consensually. It is our\r\nhope that the European Union will progressively\r\nenhance its capacity to contribute to an effective\r\nmultilateralism centred on the United Nations.\r\nDuring the recent general debate in the General\r\nAssembly, our political leaders expressed their strong\r\ncommitment to reforming multilateral institutions. We\r\nnow have to work to translate those pledges into\r\neffective and realistic measures that include Security\r\nCouncil reform. It is essential to maintain a link\r\nbetween political statements and their implementation\r\nand follow up. In taking an incremental approach to\r\nnew action and reforms, let us identify, with realism\r\nand pragmatism, the areas where there is common\r\nground and, on that basis, start to move forward.\r\nMay I recall what the representative of Jamaica\r\nsaid: let us cut the talk and walk the walk. I agree with\r\nthat.\r\nMr. Katti (Algeria) (spoke in French): At the\r\noutset, I would like to echo some ideas developed by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his report on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration,\r\nadopted by the United Nations in September 2000,\r\nparticularly with regard to peace and security and thus\r\nthe role of the Security Council.\r\nFirst of all, there is an urgent need for the\r\ninternational community to reach agreement based on a\r\nprogramme of common security that should reflect overall\r\nconsensus on the main threats to peace and security.\r\nSecondly, it is important not to shirk from the\r\nnecessity to improve, indeed change, if need be, the\r\nstructure and functions of the United Nations and other\r\ninternational institutions to better meet present needs.\r\nFinally, the strength of the Organization lies in its\r\nlegitimacy as enshrined in the fundamental principles\r\nof international law. If, consequently, the Security\r\nCouncil is to gain the broadest possible support for its\r\ndecisions and to be able to best fulfil its\r\nresponsibilities, it must be more representative and\r\nreflect the geopolitical reality of the world today.\r\nThree crucial ideas therefore underpin the\r\nadvancement of peace and security: a common security\r\nprogramme; adjustment of the structures and functions\r\nof the Organization; and the legitimacy of the activities\r\nof the Organization and the need to reform the Security\r\nCouncil, which remains, despite the crises and critical\r\ntimes being faced by our Organization, the main\r\nguarantor of the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nWe understand all the more the analysis and\r\nstatement made by the Secretary-General with respect to\r\nthe need for improvement — indeed change — of the\r\nstructure and functions of the Organization, which is now\r\ncrucial for the credibility and very survival of the United\r\nNations — something that we have always called for.\r\nPast experience, with its setbacks and\r\ndisappointments, makes us nevertheless more guarded\r\nwith regard to the possibility of thoroughly reforming\r\nthe Security Council, given the many obstacles and the\r\nsometimes insufficient political will. Twenty-four years\r\nago, the issue of reforming the Security Council was\r\nput on the agenda of the thirty-fourth General\r\nAssembly session at the request of some 10\r\ndelegations, including my own. But we had to wait for\r\nthe forty-eighth session for the General Assembly to\r\ndecide to establish an Open-ended Working Group,\r\nwith a clearly defined mandate under resolution 48/26,\r\nto consider all aspects of the issue of reforming the\r\nSecurity Council. We would be greatly remiss were we\r\nto depart from that approach.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration, for its part,\r\nhighlighted in a timely way the need to reform the\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nSecurity Council to give it the needed legitimacy and\r\nrepresentativeness to achieve its mission. We hope that\r\nthe issue of reforming the Security Council will\r\ncontinue to be considered in accordance with the\r\nrelevant General Assembly resolutions, in strict\r\ncompliance with the principles of transparency and all-\r\ninclusive participation.\r\nIn statements before the Working Group on the\r\nreform of the Security Council, throughout these\r\nmeetings and those of the fifty-seventh session, I have\r\npointed out that for the last 10 years the same\r\ndelegations have been meeting, almost at the same time\r\nand same place, to reiterate their countries’ respective\r\npositions, as if we were running out of imagination and\r\ncreativity. I had attributed the lack of progress more to\r\nthe absence of political will than to the working\r\nmethods of our group. My opinion remains unchanged.\r\nWith regard to the position of my country on the\r\nreform of the Security Council, which is rather well\r\nknown, I would like to stress that despite the\r\nimprovement in the functioning and working methods\r\nof the Security Council, the Council has not produced\r\nthe final version of its rules of procedure so as to\r\nprevent arrangements concerning diverse measures and\r\npositive changes from being subject to the whims of\r\nany one Council member. Moreover, despite concerted\r\nefforts and results achieved, we nevertheless note that,\r\nregrettably, closed meetings, where important issues\r\nare dealt with and decisions affecting Member States\r\nare made, continue to be the usual practice, whereas\r\nthey should be the exception, and that those that have\r\nthe exorbitant veto power continue to decide among\r\nthemselves in advance the final outcome of the\r\nCouncil’s deliberations.\r\nMy delegation also regrets that whereas the\r\nSecurity Council, under Article 24, paragraph 2 of the\r\nCharter, “shall act in accordance with the Purposes and\r\nPrinciples of the United Nations”, some Council\r\nmembers act as if they had no other intention than to\r\ndefend and promote their own national interests. My\r\ndelegation also believes that the Security Council must\r\ncontinually and regularly consult with the States\r\ndirectly or indirectly involved in conflict situations that\r\nare being discussed in the Council, and with regional\r\nand subregional organizations.\r\nThe Council should also take measures to make\r\nmore effective use of Article 50 of the Charter on the\r\nright of any State to consult the Security Council if it\r\nfinds itself confronted with problems arising from the\r\ncarrying out of measures — preventive or enforcement —\r\ntaken by the Council. Finally, the Security Council must\r\ncommit itself to achieving its mandate as defined by\r\nthe Charter and must not exercise any function not\r\nexplicitly entrusted to it by the Charter. It is not its role\r\nto legislate. That falls to the Member States. It is not its\r\nrole to deal with economic and social issues. That falls\r\nto the General Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. Its main responsibility is the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. That issue is so\r\narduous, complex and demanding that the Council\r\nshould devote its full attention to it without getting\r\nsidetracked.\r\nWe believe that the re-appropriation by the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil of their prerogatives, which in no way compete\r\nwith those of the Security Council but rather\r\ncomplement them, is the first step in any exercise in\r\nreform of the United Nations. It is therefore important\r\nto give full weight to the provisions of the Charter in\r\nrestoring a balance between the various bodies of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nFinally, I would like to note that, in general, with\r\nregard to working methods, there is a broad consensus\r\nto promote greater transparency and effectiveness of\r\nthe Security Council, and that consequently, it would\r\nperhaps be fitting to finalize that consensus before it\r\ndisintegrates.\r\nSuch finalizing of the agreement on the working\r\nmethods and transparency of the work of the Council is\r\nall the more desirable given that no agreement seems to\r\nbe emerging concerning the size of the Council and its\r\ncomposition, other than on the criteria for choosing\r\nnew permanent members. There is even less agreement\r\non the issue of the veto, which my delegation still\r\nconsiders an unacceptable anachronism.\r\nI do not intend to spell out again the position of\r\nmy country on all these substantive issues, but I would\r\nlike nevertheless to reaffirm the support of my delegation\r\nfor the specific proposals made by the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, in particular the proposals concerning the\r\nincrease in the number of Council members, which\r\nstems from the will to increase the representativeness\r\nand effectiveness of that important organ.\r\nI would also like to stress that any enlargement of\r\nthe membership of the Security Council must take into\r\nconsideration the demand of Africa, as it was put\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nforward at the African Union Summit, held in Harare in\r\n1997, and reiterated many times by my delegation,\r\nalong with many other African delegations.\r\nIf the serious challenges facing the Security\r\nCouncil during the past year have shaken our\r\nOrganization and impaired its image and prestige, they\r\nhave also been a wake-up call for Member States to make\r\na serious effort at reform of the Organization as a whole.\r\nThe challenge will clearly be daunting, especially with\r\nrespect to the Security Council, but what is at stake\r\ntoday is the very survival of our Organization.\r\nMr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): During the current session, the statements of\r\nmany Member States and the Secretary-General clearly\r\nhighlighted the need for urgent reform of the United\r\nNations. The Russian Federation continues to believe\r\nthat a strong and effective United Nations is a key\r\ninstrument for collectively regulating international\r\nrelations and establishing a multipolar world order\r\nbased on the Charter and international law. This is\r\nespecially pertinent today when the international\r\ncommunity is seeking to develop a comprehensive\r\nstrategy to counter new threats and challenges.\r\nReform of the Security Council must be geared\r\ntowards strengthening the potential of this key organ\r\nfor the sake of effective implementation of its terms of\r\nreference as enshrined in the Charter. We are sympathetic\r\nto the concerns of many delegations over the slow pace of\r\nprogress in reforming the Security Council — reform\r\nthat would allow the membership of that organ to better\r\nreflect current international realities. We also believe\r\nthat given the deep disagreement among States on that\r\nspecific issue, work must be done step by step and\r\ncautiously. As President Vladimir Putin of Russia said at\r\nthe opening of the present General Assembly session, “…\r\nwe should be guided above all by the broadest possible\r\nagreement on all aspects of the expansion of the\r\nCouncil …” (A/58/PV.11). We must not allow a split in\r\nthe United Nations to occur over this issue, which is so\r\nimportant to many States and the entire Organization.\r\nRussia is prepared to continue with the painstaking\r\nwork of overcoming differences of opinion, primarily on\r\nthe key aspect of the future composition of the Security\r\nCouncil. We are open to any constructive proposals\r\nregarding the expansion of the membership in all\r\ncategories, on the understanding that any increase should\r\ninclude both developed and developing States, which\r\nmust be accorded equal rights and assigned equal duties.\r\nIn this context, the Russian Federation believes\r\nthat Germany, Japan, India and Brazil, as well as a\r\nState representing Africa, would be worthy candidates\r\nfor any additional permanent seats as might be created\r\nin the Security Council. That approach would ensure an\r\nadequate balance of interests among the members and\r\nstrengthen the trend towards consensus within the\r\nCouncil.\r\nWe believe that any proposal that would lead to a\r\nreduction in the prerogatives and powers of the current\r\npermanent members of the Security Council, including\r\nthe right of veto, would be counterproductive.\r\nUnjustified and baseless criticism of the veto only\r\ncreates unnecessary tension, which is not conducive to\r\nreaching the desired agreement with regard to the\r\nparameters of the reform effort.\r\nWith regard to the question of according the right\r\nof veto to any new permanent members, it would be\r\nwise to leave any such consideration until after\r\nagreement has been reached on the specific\r\nmembership of an expanded Security Council. In this\r\nrespect, it will be important to keep the Council to a\r\nmanageable size, since too large an increase in the\r\nmembership could have a negative impact on the\r\nproductivity and effectiveness of that body.\r\nOn the basis of that consistent position, Russia\r\nwill continue to participate constructively in efforts to\r\nreach an agreement that commands maximum support\r\non the reform of the Council, within, inter alia, the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group of the General Assembly.\r\nThe activities of that Group should continue to be carried\r\nout on the basis of the agreed parameters, including the\r\nprinciple of consensus and the cluster approach. We must\r\nalso consider those recommendations that may be made\r\non Security Council reform by the Secretary-General as\r\na result of the work of the panel of eminent persons.\r\nWe hope that those recommendations will duly take\r\ninto account the existing approaches to this problem\r\nand the interests of various States, as well as of the\r\nUnited Nations as a whole. Ultimately, it is the General\r\nAssembly that will have to take a decision on that\r\nmatter.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to emphasize that the\r\nreform of the Security Council will be successful only\r\nif the end result is not division, but greater unity among\r\nStates with regard to that unique organ, which bears, on\r\nbehalf of all of the Members of the United Nations, the\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\ninternational peace and security. Russia will continue\r\nto do everything it can to help to achieve that goal.\r\nMr. Sardenberg (Brazil): I would like at the\r\noutset, Sir, to express appreciation for the work\r\nperformed by your predecessor in the presidency, Jan\r\nKavan, as chairman of the Open-ended Working Group\r\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council\r\nand Other Matters related to the Security Council, as\r\nwell as by the two Vice-Chairmen, Ambassador\r\nThorsteinn Ingólfsson and Ambassador Chuchai\r\nKasemsarn, who, during the past year, very ably\r\nconducted the business of that Group.\r\nThe Chairman displayed a commendable\r\nreadiness to accept proposals and take initiatives with a\r\nview to carrying the process forward. Particularly\r\nworthy of mention are the initiative proposing a\r\nquestionnaire on the work and methods of the Working\r\nGroup and the idea of circulating an informal summary\r\nof the results, which provided us with a convenient\r\nreference regarding these questions. The decision to\r\nfilter out of the working documents all proposals with\r\nno identified sponsors was also useful and timely, and\r\nresulted in a considerably streamlined report. Yet,\r\ndespite the fact that it has been 10 years since it was\r\nestablished, the Working Group has regrettably not\r\nlived up to the expectations that led to its creation.\r\nFrom our perspective, the lack of results is by no\r\nmeans discouraging. The issues are indeed complex\r\nand involve many difficulties, but this should not\r\ndistract us from continuing to seek institutional\r\ndevelopments that adequately reflect the political and\r\nsecurity realities of the twenty-first century and that\r\ncan thus better represent our own views and interests.\r\nThe need for such reform has existed for many years,\r\nbut its urgency was underscored by the grievous\r\ninternational developments we witnessed this year. As\r\nPresident Lula da Silva pointed out in his address to\r\nthe General Assembly on 23 September,\r\n“Reform of the United Nations has become\r\nan urgent task, given the present risks to the\r\ninternational political order .... [The Security\r\nCouncil’s] composition, in particular as concerns\r\npermanent membership, cannot remain unaltered\r\nalmost 60 years later. It can no longer ignore the\r\nchanging world. More specifically, it must take\r\ninto account the emergence on the international\r\nscene of developing countries. They have become\r\nimportant actors that often exercise a critical role\r\nin ensuring the pacific settlement of disputes”.\r\n(A/58/PV.7, p. 6)\r\nThe events that have taken place this year on the\r\ninternational scene have given rise to new challenges\r\nfor the international community, not the least of which are\r\nthose stemming from new security strategies. They have\r\nbrought into question the adequacy and effectiveness of\r\nthe rules and instruments at our disposal, prompting the\r\nSecretary-General, in paragraph 91 of his report on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration\r\n(A/58/323), to express the view that\r\n“Member States need ... to take a hard look at the\r\nexisting ‘architecture’ of international institutions\r\nand to ask themselves whether it is adequate for\r\nthe tasks we have before us”.\r\nThat pressing need is made clear by the\r\nSecretary-General in several other passages in that\r\nreport, as well as in his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/58/1).\r\nIn the specific case of the Security Council, the\r\nSecretary-General’s diagnosis also points to a\r\nperceived lack of legitimacy in that organ’s decisions,\r\nin particular “in the eyes of the developing world,\r\nwhich feels that its views and interests are\r\ninsufficiently represented among the decision-takers”\r\n(A/58/323, para. 96). He goes on to state that “The\r\ncomposition of the Security Council — unchanged in\r\nits essentials since 1945 — seems at odds with the\r\ngeopolitical realities of the twenty-first century”\r\n(ibid.).\r\nBrazil is certainly in agreement with that\r\nappraisal. The very existence of new challenges to the\r\ninternational order is a matter of paramount concern for\r\nall, and should propel us forward, both in preserving\r\nthe commonly agreed purposes and principles of\r\ninternational conduct enshrined in the Charter, and in\r\nredoubling our efforts aimed at reforming the\r\nOrganization, in particular the Security Council. In this\r\nrespect, we support the Secretary-General’s initiative to\r\nestablish a high-level panel of eminent personalities\r\ncharged with, among other duties, recommending ways\r\nof strengthening the United Nations through reform of its\r\ninstitutions and processes. We note with satisfaction the\r\nfact that more than 130 of the heads of State or\r\nGovernment, ministers for foreign affairs and others who\r\nattended this year’s general debate heeded the Secretary-\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nGeneral’s call and expressed their willingness to\r\ncontribute to bringing the process of reform to fruition.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group should carry on\r\nworking with a view to fulfilling its mandate. Although\r\non major issues general agreement has so far been\r\nelusive, its work on procedural and practical matters has\r\nyielded important results, thereby helping the process.\r\nThe work of the Working Group could continue in\r\nparallel with that of the panel, which should present its\r\nreport to the General Assembly next year.\r\nAs work proceeds in the coming months, let us\r\nkeep in mind the Secretary-General’s words in plenary\r\non 23 September:\r\n“I respectfully suggest to you, Excellencies,\r\nthat in the eyes of your peoples the difficulty of\r\nreaching agreement does not excuse your failure\r\nto do so. If you want the Council’s decisions to\r\ncommand greater respect, particularly in the\r\ndeveloping world, you need to address the issue\r\nof its composition with greater urgency.” (see\r\nA/58/PV.7)\r\nIt is high time for the international community\r\nsquarely to confront the question of reform of the\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations, in order for them\r\nbetter to respond to the world’s needs. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has pointed the way forward; let us take it.\r\nMr. Fadaifard (Islamic Republic of Iran): I wish\r\nto begin by thanking the Chairman of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the reform of the Security Council,\r\nhis two Vice-Chairmen and members of the Bureau for\r\ntheir outstanding work over the past year and, in\r\nparticular, for their leadership and patience during the\r\ndiscussions of the Working Group during the fifty-\r\nseventh session of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. President, we are pleased that you will be\r\nguiding deliberations on this critically important issue\r\nduring the next session of the Working Group. We are\r\nconfident that your diplomatic skill and your\r\ncommitment will enable us to make tangible progress\r\nin the work of the Group this year.\r\nTen years have elapsed since the establishment of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. While the Group has made\r\nconsiderable progress in some areas of the mandate\r\nlaid down by the General Assembly in 1993, the\r\nthorough and exhaustive debates that have been held to\r\ndate have proved that there remain significant\r\ndifferences on such substantive matters as the size and\r\ncomposition of the Security Council, especially as\r\nconcerns an increase in the permanent membership and\r\nthe right of veto. In other words, the fundamental\r\nquestion — how to advance from the Security Council\r\nwhich we have now to an organ which is more\r\nrepresentative and democratic, but no less efficient —\r\nhas yet to be answered.\r\nNonetheless, despite the seeming stalemate on so-\r\ncalled cluster I issues, the Working Group managed to\r\nhave a positive impact on the Council’s working\r\nmethods. Some of the recommendations formulated in\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group over the years could\r\nbe adopted and implemented by the members of the\r\nCouncil and, as a result, we can say that the Council is\r\nnow conducting its work somewhat more transparently\r\nthan in the early 1990s.\r\nIn our opinion, further progress on cluster II\r\nissues, including on modalities for the holding of\r\nmeetings and consultations with directly interested and\r\ntroop-contributing countries, are required in order to\r\nensure increased accessibility and transparency.\r\nIn the meantime, and given the lack of progress\r\non cluster I issues, it is worth reaffirming the fallback\r\nposition maintained by the Non-Aligned Movement,\r\nnamely that, if agreement is not reached on the\r\nexpansion of the permanent membership, then the\r\nexpansion should be limited, for the present, to the\r\nnon-permanent seats.\r\nAs to the objectives of the reform of the Council,\r\nwe continue to believe that the objective of the reform\r\nprocess is, and must remain, to make the Council more\r\nrepresentative, more democratic, more transparent and\r\nmore accountable, thereby helping to strengthen its\r\nlegitimacy, efficiency and authority. That requires\r\ntaking into account the dramatic changes that have\r\ntaken place since the creation of the United Nations 58\r\nyears ago, such as the end of the colonial era, resulting\r\nin the increasing weight of the developing countries,\r\nand the end of the cold war. We believe that the\r\nattainment of those objectives requires, among other\r\nthings, that the membership of the Council be\r\nexpanded to at least 26, in order better to represent the\r\ndeveloping world.\r\nMoreover, the opinion of the vast majority of\r\nStates Members of the United Nations — which continue\r\nto express their dissatisfaction at the use of the veto, as an\r\nundemocratic instrument, in the decision-making process\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nof the Security Council — should be heeded. The\r\ngeneral support for limiting and curtailing the use of\r\nthe veto, with a view to its eventual elimination, needs\r\nto be explicitly reflected in the final outcome of the\r\nWorking Group’s efforts.\r\nWe believe that the interests of all States and\r\nregions should be seriously considered in this\r\nunprecedented and historic exercise, which is also\r\ncrucially important for the future of the United Nations\r\nand of international relations. Therefore, the process of\r\nreform of the Council should not be subject to any\r\npredetermined timetable. Any attempt to force a\r\npremature decision could do the Organization more\r\nharm than good.\r\nWe are of the view that, due to importance of\r\nCouncil reform, and on the basis of the principle of\r\nequality of all Member States, every effort should be\r\nmade to reach the broadest possible agreement among\r\nMember States. We fully agree that all Member States\r\nshould intensify their efforts to achieve a comprehensive\r\nreform of the Security Council in all its aspects, which\r\ninclude enlargement, decision-making and the related\r\nquestion of veto, as well as working methods, as\r\nreiterated by our heads of State and Government in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. However, we believe that we\r\nneed to proceed with extreme prudence with respect to\r\nthe new proposals put forward in recent years,\r\nincluding during this session’s general debate.\r\nWhile setting a deadline for, and convening a\r\nsummit to deal with, reform of the Security Council\r\ncould give rise to helpful momentum, we need,\r\nhowever, to keep in mind that the impasse reached and\r\nlack of progress made in the expansion of the\r\npermanent membership of the Council is a direct\r\nproduct of the tremendous importance of the issue and\r\nthe diversity of views and interests — not the result of\r\nobstructionism or delaying tactics. We believe that the\r\npotential of the mechanism in place has not yet been\r\nexhausted and that the Open-ended Working Group\r\nshould be given further opportunities.\r\nMr. Pleuger (Germany): Seldom has the work of\r\nthe Security Council engaged world public opinion as it\r\nhas during the past year. The relevance of its decisions —\r\nand, let me add, of its non-decisions — was undisputed.\r\nYet its role and its decision-making mechanisms were the\r\nsubject of fervid discussions. It has become clear once\r\nagain that, first, the Security Council plays a central\r\nrole in the functioning of the multilateral system, and\r\nthat, secondly, the legitimizing function of the Security\r\nCouncil is a decisive component of that central role.\r\nLooking at the experience of the past year, we are\r\nmore convinced than ever that reform of the Security\r\nCouncil is indispensable in order to maintain the\r\ncredibility and legitimacy of the Council’s decisions\r\nand to promote respect for its decisions in the interests\r\nof peace and security.\r\nYet the legitimacy of the Security Council is\r\nbased on its representativeness. Member States must\r\nfeel represented in the Security Council in order to be\r\nable to accept and implement its decisions, which are\r\noften very far-reaching.\r\nWhen the number of seats on the Security\r\nCouncil was increased from 11 to 15 in 1963, the\r\nUnited Nations had 112 Members. When the present\r\nfive permanent members were chosen in 1945, there\r\nwere only 51. Out of those 51, 11 Members sat on the\r\nCouncil. That was more than 20 per cent of the total\r\nmembership. The composition of the Security Council\r\nobviously no longer reflects the current political and\r\neconomic realities of the international system. The\r\ndistinction in 1945 between the victors and the\r\nvanquished has lost its validity. The bulk of the\r\nMember States today come from the large regions of\r\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. The\r\neconomic and political distribution of weight has\r\nchanged.\r\nWith the end of the conflict between East and\r\nWest, more than 13 years ago now, the road to\r\nadaptation was fundamentally cleared. With resolution\r\n48/26 of 3 December 1993, the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup was established. It has performed remarkable\r\nwork and, as I personally remember quite well, under\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia’s presidency of\r\nthe fifty-first General Assembly session, brought us\r\nalmost within reach of true reform. Today, its tenth\r\nreport lies before us. We thank the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-seventh session, the two\r\nVice-Chairmen and all those who actively cooperated\r\nfor their contributions.\r\nYet, if we are honest, we must admit to ourselves\r\nthat the law of diminishing returns has long been\r\nshowing its effect in the work of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group. We sometimes wonder if the\r\ncontinuation of the Group is still worthwhile.\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nThe Secretary-General gave a strong new impetus\r\nto the reform of the entire United Nations system with\r\nhis report on implementation of the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration (A/58/323). In his statement to\r\nthe General Assembly, he said that the United Nations —\r\nall of us — had come to a fork in the road. And, as part\r\nof the reform, he called for a Security Council that is\r\n“more broadly representative of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole as well as the geopolitical\r\nrealities of today” (A/58/PV.7, p. 3).\r\nWe thank him for that initiative. We thank those\r\nspeakers who, in their contributions to the general\r\ndebate of the fifty-eighth session, supported that call\r\nand identified Germany as a candidate for a permanent\r\nseat. Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schröder stated in\r\nthis context that\r\n“the Council must be reformed and enlarged. First\r\nand foremost, it must also include more\r\nrepresentatives of the developing countries. Let\r\nme reiterate that in the context of such a reform\r\nGermany is ready to assume greater\r\nresponsibility”. (A/58/PV.9, p. 24)\r\nLet me emphasize that Germany does not want\r\nany quick fixes in this reform effort. We want\r\nenlargement not only in permanent but also in non-\r\npermanent seats. The large regions must receive\r\nadditional permanent as well as additional non-\r\npermanent seats.\r\nWe want not only enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil, but also the reform of its working methods. In\r\nrecent years, significant advances have been made in\r\nthis area, to which Germany, as a non-permanent\r\nmember, has endeavoured to contribute.\r\nAnd finally, we want not just Security Council\r\nreform, but a reform of the other United Nations organs\r\nas well.\r\nThe Secretary-General in his opening statement\r\nto the fifty-eighth session laid out a challenge to the\r\nSecurity Council and to its ability to respond\r\ncollectively to new threats to peace and security. This\r\nis clearly an issue that needs to be addressed if the\r\nCouncil is to maintain its credibility and its relevance.\r\nIt is in that respect that we are in agreement with\r\nthe task the Secretary-General has given to the high-\r\nlevel panel of eminent personalities. It is also in that\r\nspirit that we will contribute to the reform debate at the\r\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Almansoor (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nAllow me to begin by thanking Mr. Jan Kavan for his\r\ncommendable efforts in presiding over the discussions\r\nof the Open-ended Working Group on reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. We would also like to wish you, Mr.\r\nPresident, every success in carrying out this important\r\nand very difficult task, which we know you will be able\r\nto discharge.\r\nEver since the United Nations was established in\r\n1945, those who are interested in strengthening the role\r\nof the United Nations, whether Member States or the\r\nSecretariat, have been striving to fulfil its purposes in\r\nall spheres of interest to the international community.\r\nDespite the fact that this international Organization has\r\ngone through very complicated and difficult situations,\r\nwhich have come hand in hand with the winds of\r\nchange in the world, the United Nations has not\r\nchanged to match the new developments. Therefore, it\r\nhas now become most important to ensure that the\r\nUnited Nations can cope with those changes.\r\nTherefore, reform of the Organization is a question of\r\ncritical importance and a priority responsibility for\r\nmany who are interested in that matter.\r\nPerhaps the most urgent reform is to modernize\r\nthe Security Council, which bears responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. As in\r\nprevious years, the General Assembly is discussing\r\ntoday the most important issue on its agenda, namely,\r\nthe question of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and other\r\nrelated matters. We strongly believe that the document\r\ncirculated with respect to this agenda item reflects a\r\ncommendable effort by the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup that is considering this issue. That is reflected\r\nalso in the outcome of the Working Group’s most\r\nrecent meetings, held during the previous session.\r\nAlthough the Working Group did not succeed in\r\nreaching agreement on the key issues of reform, such\r\nas working methods and the numbers for an increase in\r\nthe Council’s membership, the value and importance of\r\nits efforts and achievements so far is not diminished.\r\nThe General Assembly’s 1993 decision to\r\nestablish the Group was a decisive step forward\r\ntowards the reform of the Security Council to which\r\nStates Members of the Organization aspire.\r\nAll countries and regional groups want to see the\r\nCouncil reformed and its working methods and\r\nprocedures improved. Discussions in the Working\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.30\r\nGroup over the years have focused on those issues and\r\nhave led to agreement on what is needed for reform and\r\nimprovement of the Council’s working methods in\r\norder to increase its effectiveness and improve its\r\nperformance in dealing with the important issue of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security. Today there\r\nis near consensus on many of the recommendations for\r\nchanging the working methods of the Security Council.\r\nOverall reform of the Council is thus an urgent and\r\npriority issue. We must make a major effort to achieve it,\r\nparticularly as the membership of the United Nations has\r\nincreased substantially. Newer Members of the United\r\nNations must be equitably represented. Beyond that,\r\nthe items on the Council’s agenda require reform if the\r\nCouncil is to be able to resolve existing difficult\r\nsituations. Redoubled efforts are needed to that end.\r\nWe note an increase in the number of resolutions\r\nadopted by the Council, compared with the past. This is\r\ndue to an increase in the number of items on the\r\nCouncil’s agenda. Many of these issues did not exist in\r\nthe past, such as dealing with post-conflict situations in\r\nsuch a way as to verify accomplishments and to help in\r\nthe process of reconciliation and reconstruction.\r\nWe are satisfied with the Council’s improved\r\nworking methods. More open meetings are being held\r\nand Member States have more opportunities to speak\r\non a variety of items. The end-of-month wrap-up\r\nmeetings provide an opportunity to evaluate and\r\nsupport the Council’s work. A better mechanism should\r\nbe found to ensure participation by States, particularly\r\nthose that are directly involved in the issues at hand.\r\nThe success we have had in improving the Council’s\r\nworking methods should encourage us to make further\r\nprogress more quickly. That requires political will on\r\nthe part of all States, to ensure that the Council better\r\nrepresents public opinion and is more democratic and\r\ntransparent in its approach to all international matters.\r\nWe must demonstrate a sincere desire for that,\r\nbecause the Security Council is the most representative\r\norgan in the area of international peace and security\r\nand because of its importance. We must do that without\r\nresorting to the use of double standards. Permanent\r\nmembers of the Council must meet their responsibilities,\r\nparticularly their moral responsibility, and refrain from\r\nthe use of veto power when this runs counter to rights\r\nthat are widely recognized by the United Nations and\r\nwhen it can jeopardize international peace and security.\r\nThe entire world looks to the Security Council as\r\nthe main body that helps prevent conflict. Some,\r\nhowever, harbour doubts about the Council’s\r\ncredibility, particularly with regard to certain issues.\r\nWe should have no doubts about the activities of the\r\nCouncil and should not minimize its importance, since\r\nit is a haven for all. Everyone should feel safe and\r\nsecure that the Council is protecting their rights and\r\nissues and providing justice and equality for all.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n"
