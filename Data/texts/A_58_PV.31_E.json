Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Andrianarivelo-\r\nRazafy (Madagascar), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 56 (continued)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters\r\nMr. De La Sablière (France) (spoke in French):\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations has invested the\r\nSecurity Council with primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. As the\r\nPresident of France emphasized at the opening meeting\r\nof the current General Assembly session, it is desirable\r\nfor the Security Council’s legitimacy that its\r\ncomposition better reflect the state of the world.\r\nThat is why France has always favoured an\r\nexpansion of the Council, which would enhance its\r\nrepresentativity. Such an expansion should apply to the\r\npermanent member category, because the presence of\r\nmajor countries is necessary. France particularly\r\nsupports the aspirations of Germany and Japan. Also\r\nincluded among permanent members should be major\r\ncountries of Asia and the Americas, such as India and\r\nBrazil, and, of course, of Africa. The Council’s\r\nrepresentativity should also be improved in the non-\r\npermanent member category, particularly to permit\r\nincreased representation of developing countries.\r\nThe Assembly made those observations last year\r\nduring the same debate. Today, the discussions are\r\nunfortunately at an impasse despite 10 years of debate.\r\nTherefore, we should give them new impetus, bearing\r\nin mind the general interest. We should also accompany\r\nany eventual reform of the Security Council’s\r\ncomposition with a strengthening of its authority and\r\neffectiveness in the mission entrusted to it.\r\nThe Secretary-General has just made proposals to\r\nre-launch the needed reform of the Organization.\r\nFrance fully approves of his decision to convene a\r\nhigh-level panel of eminent personalities charged with\r\nrecommending paths of action. But the Members of the\r\nUnited Nations must commit themselves to reform that\r\nextends beyond the Security Council. France, for its\r\npart, is prepared to play a full role in such discussions,\r\nwhich should be pursued without delay to enable the\r\nSecurity Council to continue its activities with\r\neffectiveness and determination.\r\nMr. Kulyk (Ukraine): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the GUUAM Member States — the Republic\r\nof Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova,\r\nUkraine and the Republic of Uzbekistan.\r\nAt the outset, I should like to thank the former\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. Jan Kavan of\r\nthe Czech Republic, and the members of the Bureau of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council for their important\r\nefforts to intensify the overall process of Council\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nreform during the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly. Let me also reaffirm our readiness to support\r\nconstructive initiatives of the current presidency to\r\ncontribute to that responsible task. The intention to\r\nelaborate recommendations for Council reform recently\r\nindicated by Assembly President Julian Hunte is a\r\nwelcome step, and we hope it will bring tangible results.\r\nThe general debate, held in this Hall two weeks\r\nago, highlighted the issue of Security Council reform\r\nas one of the priority tasks on the international agenda.\r\nIn fact, there is a strong recognition of both the\r\nnecessity and the urgency of making that body stronger\r\nand more effective in responding to challenges facing\r\nthe world community in the field of peace and security.\r\nTransforming the composition and the geographical\r\nrepresentation of the Council is one of the most\r\nimportant prerequisites for further improving the\r\nCouncil’s activities. Despite understandable frustration\r\nat the slow general progress in that area, we continue to\r\nrely on the common will to reach a reasonable\r\ncompromise in order to achieve comprehensive reform\r\nof the Council in all its aspects. We hope that the high-\r\nlevel panel of eminent personalities that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral intends to establish during the current General\r\nAssembly session will help us to view afresh the core\r\nof our prolonged deliberations and will pave the way to\r\nan appropriate solution.\r\nWith regard to the substance of Security Council\r\nreform, we hold the position that both categories of\r\nmembership — permanent and non-permanent —\r\nshould be expanded. However, equitable geographical\r\ndistribution of non-permanent seats on the Security\r\nCouncil is a principle to which we attach special\r\nsignificance. Any comprehensive reform proposal must\r\ntake into account the interests of every regional group.\r\nWith respect to the idea of creating new permanent\r\nseats on the Council, we continue to maintain that\r\ncountries which are able and willing to take greater\r\nresponsibility — including financial — for maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security and which enjoy the\r\nnecessary international authority and support at both\r\nthe regional and global levels may receive permanent\r\nmember status.\r\nIt is in all our interests that the Security Council\r\nbe strong, proactive and powerful. Its effective\r\nperformance in the international arena depends on our\r\nreadiness to continue and enhance processes aimed at\r\nimproving its working methods. From our point of\r\nview, a general look at the Council’s current modus\r\noperandi makes it clear that, despite objective and\r\nsubjective difficulties, that organ has made considerable\r\nprogress towards greater effectiveness and transparency.\r\nThe GUUAM member States stand ready to\r\ncontribute further to efforts aimed at strengthening and\r\nimproving the activities of the Security Council.\r\nMr. Kim Sam-hoon (Republic of Korea): We can\r\nall agree that the current composition of the Security\r\nCouncil no longer reflects the underlying international\r\ngeopolitical realities of the present day. There has been\r\ngeneral agreement among Member States on the need\r\nto expand the Security Council in order to more\r\nadequately reflect those current realities in its\r\ncomposition. However, the question of how to expand\r\nthe Council has plagued the United Nations for nearly a\r\ndecade now. No conclusions have been reached on that\r\nissue, owing primarily to a divergence of views on how\r\nto characterize the structural changes that have taken\r\nplace in the international geopolitical landscape since\r\nthe Council’s inception.\r\nSome Member States may contend that the most\r\nsignificant shift over the past 50 years has been the\r\nemergence of a few global and regional Powers whose\r\nresources and influence can compete with — or in some\r\ncases even exceed — those of certain current permanent\r\nmembers of the Council. However, the Republic of\r\nKorea shares the view that an equally salient structural\r\nchange has been the increase in the number of medium-\r\nsized Powers, which possess the willingness and the\r\ncapabilities to make a substantive contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Some\r\nof those countries could contribute resources — resources\r\ncomparable to or greater than some of the “aspirants” —\r\nto the Security Council in the discharge of its\r\nresponsibilities. The Republic of Korea believes that\r\nmarginalizing and alienating those middle Powers by\r\nincreasing the permanent membership could weaken\r\nthe institutional vitality of our Organization. Nor would\r\nit be consistent with our collective vision of a more just\r\nand equitable world. Such an increase would be certain\r\nto create serious problems in the Council’s operations.\r\nFrom an operational perspective, the increase in\r\npermanent members with divergent views could hinder\r\nthe Council in the discharge of its responsibilities in a\r\ntimely and efficient manner.\r\nWe all know from experience that there are\r\ninherent limitations on Security Council action in\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nsituations that threaten international peace and security\r\nwhen a clash of strategic interests occurs among the\r\npermanent members. A Security Council with an\r\nexpanded permanent membership with veto power\r\nwould be even more likely to become paralysed by\r\nconflicting interests. If the Council became\r\nincreasingly unable to act in grave and dire situations,\r\nwhile giving way to unilateral initiatives or actions led\r\nby coalitions of the willing, it would progressively fall\r\ninto a condition of benign irrelevance in the world\r\norder. Such a development would run counter to our\r\nultimate goal of reform, which is to enhance the\r\nrelevance of the Security Council and strengthen\r\nUnited-Nations-centred multilateralism.\r\nThe Republic of Korea believes that under these\r\ncircumstances the most practical and equitable solution\r\nto Security Council reform is an increase in the\r\nCouncil’s non-permanent membership. We would like\r\nto see a geographical perspective factored into such an\r\nincrease. Moreover, we believe that more opportunities\r\nto serve on the Council should be provided to those\r\ncountries that are better capable of contributing to the\r\nactivities of the United Nations. Such an increase in\r\nnon-permanent Security Council members would\r\nbenefit the largest number of Member States while\r\ncausing the least amount of harm to the smallest\r\nnumber of Member States. We firmly believe that this\r\nformula for reform would serve both to make the\r\nCouncil more representative and democratic and to\r\nenhance the Council’s operational efficiency.\r\nThe Republic of Korea supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s idea of establishing a high-level panel of\r\neminent personalities. The Organization will certainly\r\nbenefit from the informed and intellectual outside input\r\nthat the panel will offer. However, we note that when it\r\ncomes to the longstanding issue of Security Council\r\nreform, it is not for want of wisdom or intellectual\r\ninput that our current impasse persists.\r\nIn conclusion, the Republic of Korea would like\r\nto see every effort made to reform the Security Council\r\nin a way that not only ensures the equity, justice and\r\neffective operation of the Council, but guarantees its\r\nprimary and central role in maintaining global peace\r\nand security.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I would like, on behalf of my delegation, to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Jan Kavan, President of the General\r\nAssembly during its fifty-seventh session, for having\r\nso skilfully over the previous year guided the work of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nrelated to the Security Council. I would like also to\r\ncommend the representatives of Iceland and Thailand\r\nfor their efforts towards comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nTen years have passed since the establishment of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group. Since 1993, we have\r\nall been looking forward to a positive outcome of the\r\nprocess, set in motion by General Assembly resolution\r\n48/26, to reform the Security Council so that it\r\nequitably represents all regional groups in its\r\npermanent and non-permanent membership and ensures\r\nthat democracy and transparency are firmly rooted in its\r\ndecision-making process and in its working methods.\r\nTaking stock of the results achieved over the past\r\n10 years, it can be seen that all Member States have\r\nhad an opportunity to express their views and put\r\nforward their own proposals for reform. In that context,\r\nresolution 53/30 represented a major step forward in\r\ndeciding that a two thirds majority of the membership\r\nwould be required for adopting any decision on reform.\r\nIt has also become very clear that a consensus exists\r\nacross the board with regard to restructuring the\r\nCouncil so as to bring it into line with geographical\r\nrealities and the changes that have occurred since 1945,\r\nin particular the large number of States that have joined\r\nthe United Nations and on whose behalf the Security\r\nCouncil works.\r\nThe report of the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nreform of the Council contained in document A/57/47\r\nincludes a series of relevant proposals aimed at\r\nimproving the working methods of the Council. For its\r\npart, the Council has begun to incorporate some of\r\nthose changes into its working methods, particularly with\r\nregard to troop-contributing countries for peacekeeping\r\noperations, the number of public meetings and the\r\nstrengthening of contacts with regional organizations. I\r\nbelieve that those are steps in the right direction.\r\nWe believe that the Council is on the verge of\r\nimplementing a series of positive decisions. Its\r\nrelationship with the General Assembly, however,\r\ncannot be limited to the submission of just one report a\r\nyear. The Council must submit a series of special\r\nreports, as Article 24 of the Charter stipulates, so as to\r\nallow for closer cooperation between the two organs in\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\ndealing with issues involving international peace and\r\nsecurity. The Council must also strengthen its ties with\r\nthe International Court of Justice. And, on the subject\r\nof judicial issues, it is also of the utmost importance\r\nthat the Council implement changes in its own rules of\r\nprocedure to allow for public meetings to be held\r\nbefore the decision-making process begins. The current\r\nprocess is not yet sufficiently transparent. We know\r\nthat the major decisions in the Council are made by one\r\ngroup — or even by a single country.\r\nThe increase in the number of Council members\r\nis an important aspect of its reform. Annex IV of the\r\nreport of the Working Group contains a series of\r\nproposals put forward unilaterally by countries within\r\nthe Group or by representatives of groups of countries.\r\nOur position is that absolute equality in\r\nsovereignty among Member States is imperative in this\r\nprocess. We would prefer that any expansion be limited\r\nto the non-permanent-member category. We do not\r\nneed any more permanent members to continue\r\ndiscriminating against other Member States. We, of\r\ncourse, will not obstruct any decision to add permanent\r\nseats as long as it is done in a non-selective manner\r\nand not based on criteria that give priority to countries\r\nthat can carry the burden of the financing of\r\npeacekeeping operations or that are capable of\r\nproviding a great number of peacekeeping troops or a\r\ngreat deal of equipment. Were we to adopt that\r\nprinciple only, we would simply be reinforcing the\r\nhegemony of the strong and the wealthy in the Council,\r\nalways to the detriment of the poor and weaker States,\r\nwhich constitute the majority. Any expansion of the\r\npermanent category must therefore reflect equitable\r\ngeographical distribution and in particular the status of\r\ndeveloping countries. Latin America is not represented,\r\nand Africa does not have a permanent seat either,\r\nthough it represents almost one third of the\r\nmembership. This must be remedied.\r\nWe must also work to realize the aspirations of\r\nour continent as represented by the African Union, as\r\nembodied in the Harare Declaration and as set out by\r\nPresident Chissano in his statement on the issue. Africa\r\nmust therefore have two permanent seats on the\r\nSecurity Council, to be occupied by rotation among\r\nagreed criteria by African States.\r\nNegotiations in the Working Group have shown\r\nthat some seek to stress the retention of privileges as\r\nthey are held today by permanent members, in\r\nparticular in terms of the right to veto. There can be no\r\nquestion that this is one of the most crucial issues and\r\nthat it needs to be resolved. The veto right flies in the\r\nface of the principle of equal sovereignty among States\r\nas stipulated in the Charter and contravenes the\r\nprinciples of justice and democracy.\r\nMany countries, including my own, have spoken\r\nout to say that the right to veto does not serve the\r\ninterests of international peace and security but, rather,\r\nthe national interests of just a few countries, in\r\nparticular those that constantly flout the Security\r\nCouncil’s authority and refuse to implement its\r\ndecisions, defying the entire world.\r\nThe fact is that the countries that were the victors\r\nof the Second World War have arrogated to themselves\r\nthose privileges. More than five decades have gone by\r\nsince then, and the world has experienced profound\r\ntransformations. The membership of the United Nations\r\nnow stands at 191. Two thirds of these countries were not\r\nMembers 50-odd years ago and never had any of the\r\nprivileges of the five permanent members.\r\nWe therefore must stress a position we have\r\nsteadfastly maintained for some 30 years now — that\r\nwe must do away with the veto right. This could first\r\nbe achieved by using a restrictive approach and setting\r\nout a series of conditions, including the need for at\r\nleast two votes against by permanent members when a\r\ndecision is reached by the majority.\r\nAnother proposal will involve the use of the veto\r\nright in ratifying a decision by a two-thirds vote of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. These and other such decisions\r\ncould lead us to doing away with the veto right\r\noutright. We believe that Security Council reform must\r\ndo away with the privileges now given to just a few\r\ncountries, which allow them to hold hegemonistic sway\r\nover the entire world.\r\nThe Secretary-General has spoken out on these\r\nissues, saying that if we want Security Council\r\ndecisions to be respected the world over especially by\r\nthe developing countries, we must tackle the issue of\r\nreforming the Council with greater professionalism.\r\nWe would add that one of the main documents — the\r\nMillennium Declaration — calls for intensified efforts\r\nto be made to bring about Council reform in all\r\nrespects. We must now try to give concrete form to the\r\ncall made by the Secretary-General and act on the\r\ncommitments we entered into three years ago.\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nWe believe that in future meetings of the Working\r\nGroup there must be sufficient political will on all\r\nsides to bring these reform efforts to a successful\r\nconclusion, so that, as a result, the Council can fulfil\r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter, work in the\r\nservice of all nations and be more transparent and more\r\ndemocratic in its decision-making process.\r\nMr. Al-Shamsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): At the outset, I should like to express my\r\nthanks and appreciation to the President for his sincere\r\nefforts to direct the deliberations of this session, which\r\nis dedicated to one of the most important items on the\r\nagenda of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation has read carefully the most recent\r\nreport of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and other\r\nMatters Related to the Security Council. We note that,\r\n10 years after its creation, and despite the consensus\r\nreached by all Member States and the multiplicity of\r\nsuggestions offered by States on this matter, the Group\r\nhas not been able to reach agreement on how to effect\r\nthe required changes relating to the composition and\r\nmethods of work of the Council, especially as concerns\r\nthe increase in the number of its members and the use\r\nof the veto. We hope that the influential countries in\r\nparticular will have the political will to reach a\r\nconsensus on this issue in the near future.\r\nWe have expressed our position on this item\r\nregarding the importance of restructuring the Security\r\nCouncil and the methods of its reform. Today we reiterate\r\nour position, which can be summarized as follows.\r\nFirst, the principle of increasing the permanent\r\nand non-permanent membership of the Council on the\r\nbasis of a ratio that strengthens its efficiency and its\r\ndecision-making capacity must be supported. Such an\r\nincrease should conform to the principle of the\r\nsovereign equality of all Member States, as well as to\r\nthe principle of equitable geographical distribution and\r\nthe universal nature of the Council. It should also take\r\ninto consideration the imbalance that exists in its\r\ngeographical representation, ensuring the developing\r\ncountries a greater chance of representation.\r\nWe also call for giving priority to the allocation\r\nof permanent seats to those States that have\r\ndemonstrated their commitment to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security — States which will be\r\nelected by other Member States in the General\r\nAssembly. We believe also that a permanent seat\r\nshould be allocated to the Arab Group to be occupied\r\nby rotating members agreed upon by the whole Group.\r\nWe call also for the adoption of constructive\r\nsuggestions on parameters and controls relating to the\r\nright to veto, as a step towards reaching agreed\r\nlanguage that will ensure that the Council fulfils its\r\nresponsibilities with greater objectivity and impartiality\r\nand avoids abusing that right.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates is deeply concerned at\r\nthe continued failure of the Council to carry out its\r\nmandate and responsibilities with respect to the\r\ntensions in the Middle East, especially in relation to the\r\nIsraeli aggression against the Palestinian Authority and\r\nthe Palestinian people. Israel, the occupying State,\r\ncontinues to violate international law and to show\r\ncontempt for all relevant resolutions of the United\r\nNations concerning the conflict in the area.\r\nThe latest of those offences was its violation of\r\nSyrian sovereignty on 5 October, in an act of aggression\r\nthat was deplored by the international community,\r\nwhich considered it a flagrant violation of international\r\nlegality and of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nNevertheless, the Security Council took no action\r\nagainst Israel — because of the position taken by certain\r\ninfluential permanent Council members — which implies\r\ntacit encouragement to Israel. We hope that Israel will\r\nnot interpret this as encouragement to encroach on the\r\nsovereignty of other States with impunity and that the\r\nsituation will be redressed so that we can avoid sending\r\na message to other States that such aggression and\r\nviolations are permitted.\r\nFinally, we hope that our deliberations today will\r\nlead to some concrete progress in the work towards the\r\nreform of the Security Council and an equitable\r\nincrease in its membership to strengthen its\r\neffectiveness and credibility, as well as its central role\r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nMr. Balestra (San Marino): After 10 years of\r\nintensive work in the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nthe reform of the Security Council, we are here today\r\nto discuss not how to reform the Security Council, but\r\nhow to proceed in our discussion. This could seem\r\nironic but it is just proof of the importance and\r\nsensitivity of this issue.\r\nOn the one hand, the frustration of those who\r\nwould like to see some quick concrete results is\r\nunderstandable. On the other, the concern about a\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\ndecision taken under pressure and with an inflexible\r\ntime frame is also understandable. After all, we are in the\r\nprocess of substantially modifying the most important\r\norgan of the international community that deals with\r\npeace and security — and this is not an easy task.\r\nIn my opinion and in the opinion of San Marino, the\r\nsimultaneous increase in both categories, permanent and\r\nnon-permanent members, seems still far from the general\r\nagreement required for the adoption of such an important\r\ndecision. An increase in the number of non-permanent\r\nmembers is instead the only element that seems shared by\r\nall Member States, but that, unfortunately, remains\r\nhostage to the expansion in both categories.\r\nThe position of my country on the enlargement is\r\nwell known. San Marino is in favour of an increase\r\nonly in the number of non-permanent members. In fact,\r\nwe are opposed to any reform that may raise\r\ninequalities among States. San Marino also considers\r\nthat a quick fix would represent an approximate\r\nsolution. It would crystallize an Organization that\r\nshould, on the contrary, reflect the political, social and\r\neconomic changes in the world. In addition, an increase\r\nin the non-permanent members would be the only\r\npossible outcome for the time being.\r\nIn the opinion of my country, any enlargement\r\nshould equitably address all Member States, correcting\r\nthe current imbalances. The regional groups should\r\ncontinue to play a basic role in the allocation of\r\nSecurity Council seats to their members.\r\nMy delegation wishes to welcome the intention of\r\nthe Secretary-General to establish a high-level panel of\r\neminent personalities with the task, among others, of\r\nrecommending ways to strengthen the United Nations\r\nthrough the reform of its institutions and processes.\r\nThis initiative could bring new momentum to our\r\ndiscussion. Nevertheless, it is fundamental for the\r\npanel to be composed of eminent experts with a\r\nspecific knowledge of international organizations and\r\nto act within a well-defined mandate. Moreover, San\r\nMarino considers it necessary that such experts, in\r\nfulfilling their mandate, should take into consideration\r\nall consultations carried out in the Working Group and\r\nmaintain intense interaction with all Member States.\r\nMr. Gopinathan (India): The Indian delegation\r\nwelcomes this opportunity to comment on agenda item\r\n56: Question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters.\r\nMany delegations expressed during the general\r\ndebate, held at the beginning of the fifty-eighth\r\nsession, a sense of deep regret over the inability of the\r\nSecurity Council to reach satisfactory agreement on the\r\nissue of war and peace involving Iraq in the first\r\nquarter of this year. Many attributed the inability of the\r\nSecurity Council to arrive at a collective and unified\r\ndecision on the major issues placed before it to the lack\r\nof balanced representation in its current composition.\r\nThe Prime Minister of India did touch upon this\r\nimbalance when he stated in his address at this session\r\nof the Assembly, on 24 September:\r\n“For the Security Council to represent genuine\r\nmultilateralism in its decisions and actions, its\r\nmembership must reflect current world realities.\r\nMost United Nations Members today recognize\r\nthe need for an enlarged and restructured Security\r\nCouncil, with more developing countries as\r\npermanent and non-permanent members. The\r\npermanent members guard their exclusivity. Some\r\nStates with weak claims want to ensure that others\r\ndo not enter the Council as permanent members.\r\nThis combination of complacency and negativism\r\nhas to be countered with a strong political will. The\r\nrecent crises warn us that until the Security\r\nCouncil is reformed and restructured, its\r\ndecisions cannot reflect truly the collective will\r\nof the community of nations.” (A/58/PV.11, p. 14)\r\nWithin the United Nations, there has been ample\r\nrecognition of the need for the Organization and its\r\narchitecture to deal with the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security to adapt to the needs\r\nand realities of the times. The Secretary-General\r\nhimself underscored this point on more than one\r\noccasion. In the report on the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, presented at the current\r\nsession of the General Assembly, he said:\r\n“Increasingly, however, [the] decisions [of the\r\nSecurity Council] lack legitimacy in the eyes of\r\nthe developing world, which feels that its views\r\nand interests are insufficiently represented among\r\nthe decision-takers. The composition of the Security\r\nCouncil — unchanged in its essentials since 1945\r\n— seems at odds with the geopolitical realities of\r\nthe twenty-first century.” (A/58/323, para. 96)\r\nIntroducing his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization at the beginning of the general debate, the\r\nSecretary-General had said that to regain the confidence\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nof States, and of world opinion, the Security Council must\r\nbecome “more broadly representative of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole as well as the geopolitical\r\nrealities of the contemporary world” (A/58/PV.7, p. 3).\r\nIndia’s position on the reform and restructuring of\r\nthe Security Council has been summed up in the words\r\nof Prime Minister Vajpayee quoted at the beginning of\r\nmy statement. Therefore, I shall not go into details, as\r\nthey have been spelt out on several occasions in the\r\npast. Suffice it to say that we do not subscribe to partial\r\nand piecemeal solutions that bring no resolution to the\r\ncore problem. Nor are we intimidated by relevance of\r\nthe time factor cited by some as a reason to rush into\r\npartial reform. A subject as complex and intricate as\r\nCouncil reform cannot have a time line or a quick fix\r\nimposed, even as we agree that Council reform is\r\nurgent and pressing, and must be administered in a\r\nreasonable time frame.\r\nI would be remiss if I did not register my\r\ndelegation’s sincere appreciation for the lead taken by\r\nyour predecessor, the President of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-seventh session, Mr. Jan Kavan, of the Czech\r\nRepublic, in the work programme of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group for this year. Acting on a proposal\r\nmade by some to streamline cluttered and unstructured\r\ndocuments, noteworthy progress was achieved in\r\npruning down the document on cluster II issues.\r\nThe questionnaire circulated by the President to\r\nMember States in the month of May was a dynamic\r\ninitiative in that it posed and brought to the fore some\r\nvery pertinent issues, apart from defining where the\r\nmainstream lies. It demonstrated that the majority\r\ncontinues to favour a comprehensive approach to\r\nSecurity Council reform, that there must be\r\nsimultaneous reform in both the permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories, and that cluster I and cluster II\r\nissues must be dealt with in tandem.\r\nBroad agreement was also expressed on the issue\r\nthat the time is now perhaps ripe to begin considering\r\nconcrete proposals for reform on cluster I issues.\r\nMember States have also expressed a willingness to\r\nconsider a change in the working methods of the\r\nWorking Group in order to inject some dynamism and\r\nachieve a breakthrough or register some progress in the\r\nproceedings. We need to be cognizant of those facts as\r\nwe move forward.\r\nFinally, I should like to say a word on the\r\ninitiative of the Secretary-General to set up a high-\r\nlevel panel of eminent personalities to study the\r\nquestion of United Nations reform in a broad and\r\ncomprehensive way, of which Council reform will no\r\ndoubt comprise an important part. We welcome the\r\ninitiative and look forward to the Group’s report and the\r\nSecretary-General’s recommendations thereon, expected\r\nsometime before the beginning of the fifty-ninth\r\nsession. We hope that the initiative will impart a fresh\r\noutlook and inject new momentum into a process that\r\nmust now urgently move forward. We shall continue\r\ndiscussions in that spirit in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup next year. India is wholly committed to working\r\nwith other delegations in order to carry this process\r\nforward to achieve meaningful and productive outcomes.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The Security Council is not shouldering the\r\n“primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security” that United Nations\r\nMembers confer on it, and the Council is no longer\r\n“carrying out its duties under this responsibility” or\r\nacting on the behalf of Members. Frequently, the\r\nSecurity Council is not acting in accordance with the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations. The\r\nillegal war in Iraq and the inaction in the Middle East\r\nconflict, inter alia, are eloquent and irrefutable\r\nexamples. The Security Council is also doing violence\r\nto the spirit and the provisions of the Charter through\r\nan increasingly voracious and intrusive agenda that is\r\nusurping the functions of the General Assembly and of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe Security Council has become an anti-\r\ndemocratic and conspiratorial body that acts on the\r\nbasis of the opacity and secrecy of informal\r\nconsultations, which have become the norm, not the\r\nexception. The Council is seriously inequitable. In no\r\nother organ is the principle of sovereign equality being\r\nviolated in such a daily, institutional and flagrant way.\r\nThe non-permanent members are excluded and ignored,\r\ndespite the fact that they enjoy legitimacy granted by\r\nthe ballot box, not by wars.\r\nThere will not be true United Nations reform\r\nwithout Security Council reform. The rule of international\r\nlaw — particularly of the Charter — will not be restored,\r\nnor will there be democracy in the Organization, so\r\nlong as the Council wields totalitarian powers.\r\nIt is true that members of the Council, including\r\npermanent members, are also suffering from the\r\ndictatorship of the super-Power, established by the\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nforce of arms and money. What can be done if the veto\r\nis the principle and the purpose of that order? The veto\r\nwas a reflection of an international balance that does\r\nnot even exist now. Today, it expresses only the\r\nimpotence of disagreement. It has grave consequences\r\nand poses high risks for the Powers that hold it under the\r\nCharter and that are declared irrelevant when they\r\nactually exercise it. Paradoxically, the super-Power uses it\r\nmost and needs it least. Member States, with a handful\r\nof exceptions, agree that the veto must be eliminated.\r\nHow can we address the veto to eliminate, modify\r\nor regulate it? Let us be realistic: what is essential is\r\nnot the veto’s legal aspect, but the powerful forces that\r\nsuppress the other permanent members, the non-\r\npermanent members and the membership at large. They\r\nare the forces that regulate the essential processes of\r\nthe economy, finances and military supremacy along\r\nwith precarious and fleeting balances of power. They\r\nare the same correlations that are preventing the\r\nexercise of the mechanical majority of non-permanent\r\nmembers and preventing the General Assembly — as a\r\nresult of this era’s political, military and financial\r\nrealities — from regaining the powerful functions\r\noutlined in the document we call, with nostalgia and\r\nhope, the Charter. Today, the United Nations is a\r\nreflection of the world dictatorship from which we are\r\nsuffering and of the unjust, exclusive and unsustainable\r\norder in which we live.\r\nIn the meantime, let us continue to work. The\r\nSecurity Council must be expanded to include new\r\npermanent and non-permanent members. As stated by\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, if there is no agreement\r\non other categories, the number of non-permanent\r\nmembers must be immediately increased. The new\r\npermanent and non-permanent Council seats created as\r\npart of an expansion must have exactly the same\r\nprerogatives as the current ones. The objective of an\r\nexpansion must be to correct the inadequate\r\nrepresentation of developing countries. Two or three\r\nAfrican countries, two or three countries from Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, and two or three of the\r\ndeveloping countries in Asia must come in as\r\npermanent members with the same prerogatives as the\r\ncurrent ones, including the veto. Until we achieve the\r\nultimate objective of eliminating the veto, we will need\r\nto limit its application to Chapter VII of the Charter as\r\na first step towards that objective.\r\nInformal Council consultations must proceed\r\nfrom a decision adopted in a formal meeting on the\r\nbasis of a proposal by one or several Council members\r\nthat is included in the record. To save time, we will not\r\nreiterate many other elements that our delegation has\r\nalready addressed in this Hall so many times. The\r\nGeneral Assembly’s Open-ended Working Group must\r\ncontinue its work with renewed vigour.\r\nCan we only hope for a better world? We, the\r\npowerful majority of Member States, can impose\r\ndemocracy. This can done only from within the General\r\nAssembly, where each State has a vote and none a veto.\r\nThis is no utopian vision. It would be feasible to create\r\na powerful alliance among all Member States that\r\nwould include almost all of the permanent members of\r\nthe Council that aspire to democracy in international\r\nrelations, sovereign equality, multilateral agreement,\r\ninternational law and a system of collective security —\r\nin other words, those that want a United Nations that is\r\nperfectible but indispensable, notwithstanding its\r\nflaws, mistakes and capitulations. In the absence of a\r\ncomprehensive political decision, only superficial,\r\ncosmetic reforms will be feasible.\r\nMs. Ndhlovu (South Africa): The Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on Security Council reform was\r\nestablished because the States Members of the United\r\nNations recognized the need to address representational\r\nequity in the Security Council and to examine formulas\r\nto increase its membership. The Working Group was also\r\ncharged with examining other important matters related to\r\nthe composition and the working methods of the Council,\r\nwith the intention of arriving at a package of reforms\r\nthat would ensure that the Council would effectively\r\nexecute its mandate of maintaining international peace\r\nand security. After a decade of debating Council\r\nreform, we find that we are still far from reaching\r\ngeneral consensus and that the Security Council is, now\r\nmore than ever before, in dire need of reform.\r\nBarely a fortnight ago heads of State or\r\nGovernment and senior representatives congregated\r\nhere for the general debate of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-eighth session. They recognized the complex\r\nchallenges that the United Nations faces in the new\r\nmillennium and the importance of revitalizing our\r\nOrganization in order to meet these complex global\r\nchallenges. The call for United Nations reform by 141\r\nworld leaders underscores the importance and urgency\r\nthat Member States attach to this important issue.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s initiative to appoint a\r\npanel of eminent persons received strong support,\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nbecause it is now generally accepted that the United\r\nNations cannot continue simply to talk about reform —\r\nit must urgently act to make itself relevant to the times\r\nand the challenges of our era.\r\nOne positive aspect of the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposal is that the issue of Security Council reform\r\nwould be dealt with in the context of United Nations-\r\nwide integrated reform, including the important\r\nelement of strengthening the relationships between the\r\norgans and institutions of the United Nations.\r\nIn the view of the general public, the tardy\r\nresponse to the crisis in Liberia and the failure of\r\ndiplomacy as regards Iraq and the Middle East was in part\r\nattributed to the Security Council and, by extension, to the\r\nentire United Nations system. Whatever our views may\r\nbe of such criticism, we now find ourselves in a\r\nsituation in which effecting change in the composition\r\nand working methods of the Security Council has\r\nbecome an urgent moral and political imperative.\r\nEffective and timeous United Nations action in many\r\ntroubled spots around the globe is essential, because\r\nlives depend on it. There can be no greater motivation\r\nfor us to now bridge our differences and revitalize our\r\ncommon purpose against the scourge of war.\r\nSouth Africa supports expansion in both the\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories of Council\r\nmembership, with new members having equal sovereign\r\nstatus with existing members in those categories. As a\r\nmember of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the\r\nAfrican Union, South Africa has actively participated\r\nin the Group. South Africa supports the call by the\r\nlarge majority of Member States for the reform process\r\nto be transparent and give due consideration to\r\nequitable geographic representation in the context of a\r\npackage of reforms that would not disadvantage\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nArguments have been put forward that the size of\r\nthe Council can be increased only slightly from the\r\ncurrent 15, because the Council should not become\r\ncumbersome and unable to respond rapidly to crises.\r\nOur experience with the Security Council has shown us\r\nthat its credibility in dealing with crises was not an issue\r\nof size, but that credibility emerged when there was a\r\nsense of transparency, legitimacy, representativity and\r\naccountability in the its deliberations and actions.\r\nSimilarly, we found that the size of the Council was not\r\nthe basis for its slow reactions or even its failure to act.\r\nMore often, it was the use or the threat of use of the\r\nveto, as well as a lack of political will on the part of\r\nindividual powerful States, that often frustrated the will\r\nof the majority of Council Members and, indeed, of the\r\nmajority of United Nations Members.\r\nIn this regard, the question of the veto remains a\r\ncontentious one in the debate on Council reform. When\r\nwe examine the record of the use of the veto, it\r\nbecomes clear that we cannot continue to have\r\nsituations in which individual Member States serve\r\ntheir own narrow national interests while ignoring the\r\noverwhelming voice of the international community.\r\nIt is, consequently, important that we overcome\r\nour traditional divisions on how to reform the Security\r\nCouncil and seek agreement on the composition and\r\nthe working methods of a Security Council that will\r\nserve us all in the context of the new geopolitical\r\nrealities of this new millennium. The time has come to\r\narrest the erosion of the Council’s credibility and to\r\nwork with the Secretary-General in his bold initiative\r\nto reform the United Nations in the interests of all\r\nMember States.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to express\r\nour gratitude to the former Chairman of the Working\r\nGroup, Mr. Jan Kavan, for his determination and\r\ncommitment throughout the past year’s meetings of the\r\nGroup. His personal efforts, including the informal\r\nsurvey that was conducted, highlighted the near-\r\nuniversal dissatisfaction with the progress of\r\ndiscussions in the Group.\r\nMy delegation welcomes Mr. Julian Hunte as the\r\nnew Chairman of the Working Group and would like to\r\nassure him of our support and cooperation throughout\r\nupcoming meetings. We believe that he will guide the\r\nWorking Group through a challenging period during\r\nwhich it will have to take stock of the progress it has\r\nmade and decide on the best way to consolidate its\r\nwork into concrete proposals on a reform package. We\r\nlook forward to working with him and to contributing\r\nto meeting that challenge.\r\nMr. Kim Chang Guk (Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea): Ten years have passed since the\r\nGeneral Assembly began deliberations on the issue of\r\nSecurity Council reform, in conformity with the\r\nconsistent demand of the Member States of the United\r\nNations. However, agreement has not yet been reached.\r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that repeated deliberations\r\nhave produced no results at all. That is largely due to\r\nthe pursuit of unilateral interests, which constitutes a\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nviolation of the basic purpose of the reform. My\r\ndelegation believes that priority should be attached to\r\nthe following matters, if the Security Council is to be\r\ndemocratized thoroughly so as to resolve international\r\npeace and security issues in line with the common\r\ninterests and demands of all Member States.\r\nFirst, the Security Council should be reformed to\r\nensure the full representation of developing countries.\r\nAs we are all aware, the present composition of the\r\nSecurity Council does not fully represent the demands of\r\ntoday’s reality. Only when the representation of\r\ndeveloping countries, which make up the overwhelming\r\nmajority of Member States, is realized will it be\r\npossible to enhance the transparency and effectiveness\r\nof the work of the Security Council and to speed up the\r\ndemocratization of the United Nations.\r\nIn that respect, we consider it important to\r\nincrease the number of non-permanent members first,\r\nso that developing countries are fully represented. In\r\naddition, under the circumstances in which even\r\nelementary issues are not agreed upon with regard to\r\nSecurity Council reform, it is necessary to take a\r\nserious approach vis-à-vis expansion in the category of\r\npermanent membership.\r\nSecondly, the Security Council should adhere to the\r\nprinciples of justice and impartiality in its activities, on\r\nthe basis of the purposes and principles of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations. Due to the unilateralism and high-\r\nhandedness of the super-Power, the Security Council\r\nwas unable to properly carry out the missions entrusted\r\nto it by the Charter with regard to resolving major\r\ninternational issues. That has undermined the authority\r\nand dignity of the Security Council as an organ\r\nauthorized to ensure peace and security. If the Security\r\nCouncil is incapable of observing the principles of\r\njustice and fairness, which are its lifeblood, the value\r\nof its existence should be publicly questioned.\r\nThe Security Council should fundamentally\r\nimprove its working methods and fully represent the\r\nwill and interests of all Member States, thereby\r\nrestoring the credibility of the international community.\r\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia) (spoke in French): Allow\r\nme, at the outset, to thank Ambassador John\r\nNegroponte, President of the Security Council for this\r\nmonth, for his introduction of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil (A/58/2), submitted to the General Assembly\r\nin accordance with relevant provisions of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation, which did not participate in\r\nyesterday’s debate on that item, would have preferred\r\nto discuss the items pertaining to the Council’s report\r\nand to representation in the Council together, given the\r\nincreasingly obvious link between the two items. In\r\nthat regard, my delegation would like to take this\r\nopportunity to make a few brief comments on the\r\nreport of the Security Council.\r\nThe consideration of the Council’s report\r\nprovides a valuable opportunity to examine in depth\r\nthe work done by the Council as well as to identify the\r\nmeasures that must be taken to make the necessary\r\nimprovements in the working methods of that\r\nimportant body.\r\nWith regard to the report’s format, my delegation\r\nwelcomes the fact that this is a short, analytical\r\ndocument containing a statistical section.\r\nWith regard to the functioning of the Council, we\r\nare pleased to note that during the period under review\r\nthe Council held more open meetings, during which an\r\nincreasing number of States participated. We also note a\r\nclear increase in the number of open briefings organized\r\nby the Secretariat, which make it possible for States that\r\nare not members of the Council to be better informed\r\nabout certain matters being addressed by the Council.\r\nWith regard to the wrap-up sessions held at the\r\nend of each month, which are open to non-members of\r\nthe Council, my delegation believes that that practice is\r\nan opportunity to speak on subjects of concern to the\r\ninternational community in an analytical, frank and\r\nopen manner. We believe that practice should be\r\ncontinued and encouraged.\r\nHaving said that, much remains to be done to\r\nmake the work of the Council even more transparent to\r\nall Member States.\r\nTurning to the issue of substance, the report of\r\nthe Security Council reveals the fact that the Council\r\nhas not merely reacted to threats to international and\r\nregional peace and security; it has also acted directly,\r\nresolutely and forcefully to address a great number of\r\nconflicts in Africa. However, the Council’s efforts have\r\nfallen short of our expectation vis-à-vis the Middle East.\r\nThe Council’s inability to become more involved in\r\nresolving the Palestinian issue poses a serious threat to\r\nthe region and to the authority of the Security Council.\r\nLastly, my delegation supports the President’s\r\nidea of submitting specific recommendations and\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nconstructive proposals after our debate on this issue in\r\norder to improve the capacity of the Security Council.\r\nWith regard to agenda item 56, entitled “Question\r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters”, allow me first to pay tribute to Mr. Jan\r\nKavan, former president of the General Assembly, and\r\nhis two Vice-Presidents in the Working Group on\r\nSecurity Council Reform, for their outstanding\r\ncontribution to the item under discussion today.\r\nThe crucial importance of reforming the Security\r\nCouncil has constantly been reiterated from year to\r\nyear since the establishment, in 1993, of the Working\r\nGroup entrusted with the consideration of this issue in\r\nall aspects. We certainly appreciate the delicate nature\r\nand complexity of that task. Nevertheless, we believe\r\nthat we need to carry out comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council as soon as possible, and that we must\r\nintensify our efforts to that end.\r\nThe world is facing new challenges that\r\nnecessitate our working together within the United\r\nNations, which remains the ideal framework within\r\nwhich to join our efforts to establish international\r\npeace and security, as well as the source of\r\ninternational law to which all States without exception\r\nshould commit themselves.\r\nAs Secretary-General Kofi Annan pointed out in\r\nhis statement to the General Assembly at the opening\r\nof the general debate, those challenges make it\r\nnecessary for the Security Council\r\n“to regain the confidence of States and of world\r\npublic opinion — both by demonstrating its ability\r\nto deal effectively with the most difficult issues and\r\nby becoming more broadly representative of the\r\ninternational community as a whole as well as the\r\ngeopolitical realities of today.” (A/58/PV.7, p. 3)\r\nWhile we support the Secretary-General’s appeal\r\nfor a profound reform of our Organization, we reaffirm\r\nthe fact that Tunisia is willing to take an active part in\r\ninternational efforts to attain that goal, for which there\r\nis an increasingly urgent need. The Security Council\r\nshould be involved in that profound reform.\r\nNevertheless, its enlargement should not necessarily\r\nwait until that process is completed.\r\nThe wealth of varied proposals that have been\r\nsubmitted give us the potential elements to act towards\r\nthat end. However, since 1993, after almost 10 years of\r\nintense and substantive deliberations, the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on that question has not yet managed\r\nto develop a specific and universally-acceptable\r\nformula. The report before us reflects the frustrating\r\ndeadlock that we have witnessed since the Group was\r\nestablished. The report is still a simple compilation of\r\nopposing ideas and proposals that we have been\r\nendlessly considering for 10 years now.\r\nThis does not mean at all that we do not\r\nrecognize the progress made in certain aspects of\r\nreform of the Council, particularly with respect to its\r\nworking methods. In fact, the long deliberations of the\r\nGroup have enabled us to identify a certain number of\r\nkey elements that have been widely supported by the\r\nmajority of Member States.\r\nThose elements include, first, the need to reform\r\nboth the composition and the functioning of the\r\nCouncil to ensure greater representativeness. Secondly,\r\nthe need to consider the issue of the veto in conjunction\r\nwith that of the increase in the number of Security\r\nCouncil members. Thirdly, the need to further improve\r\nthe working methods and decision-making process of\r\nthe Council to promote the openness, transparency and\r\ndemocratic nature of that organ. Fourthly, the need to\r\nconsider all aspects of reform of the Council in the\r\nframework of a comprehensive package. Lastly, the\r\nneed for periodic review of this reformed Council.\r\nIt is therefore clear that we have the basis for a\r\nsolution. It is also clear that what is lacking is neither\r\nideas nor proposals but rather the necessary political\r\nwill to achieve the common goal, set forth in General\r\nAssembly resolution 48/26 of 1993 and reaffirmed in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration, as well as a specific\r\ncommitment to that end.\r\nTunisia, which has taken part in all the deliberations\r\nof the Working Group since its establishment, continues\r\nto stand by its position on that issue, which it has\r\nreaffirmed several times. Indeed, my country believes\r\nthat the goal of that reform is the strengthening of\r\ndemocratic and fair representation on the Council, as\r\nwell as its credibility and effectiveness. The Security\r\nCouncil must reflect the political and economic\r\nrealities of our world today. It must have the necessary\r\ndemocratic legitimacy to act on behalf of the\r\ninternational community in carrying out the mandate\r\nentrusted to it in accordance with the Charter. Those\r\ngoals cannot be attained without an increase in both\r\ncategories of members, permanent and non-permanent.\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nThe size of a restructured Security Council should\r\nreflect genuine representation of developing countries\r\nand also representation among the industrialized\r\ncountries that meet the criteria set forth in the Charter.\r\nIn that context, Tunisia has always vigorously\r\nsupported the position of Africa and its demand to be\r\ngranted two permanent seats, with the privileges\r\ninherent to that membership category, and two\r\nadditional non-permanent seats. Tunisia also supports\r\nthe rotation scheme approved by the African heads of\r\nState and Government. I would also like to recall in\r\nthat context that my country supports the candidacy of\r\nGermany and Japan for permanent seats in the Security\r\nCouncil in light of our belief that those two countries\r\nare capable of making a major contribution to the work\r\nof the Council and of assuming the responsibilities that\r\nfall to permanent members.\r\nWith regard to the right of veto, my delegation\r\nadheres to the position of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\ncalling for limitations on the application of the veto to\r\nactions undertaken in the framework of Chapter VII of\r\nthe Charter. Clearly, a positive and constructive attitude\r\non the part of the Security Council permanent members\r\nconcerning that question will be crucial.\r\nFinally, the issue of periodic review of this reformed\r\nSecurity Council is an essential element of the reform\r\nprogramme that deserves serious consideration. That\r\nreview should be viewed as a confidence-building\r\nmeasure that will enable us to make the necessary\r\nadjustments for the future. Still more important, it will\r\nrepresent the mechanism through which we will be able\r\nto assess the contribution made by the new members to\r\nthe strengthening of the effectiveness of the Council.\r\nWe are concerned by the deadlock that seems to\r\nbe getting worse over time and is prevailing in the\r\nWorking Group’s deliberations. In fact, without\r\ngenuine political will and a spirit of compromise, the\r\nentire reform process will be inconclusive. It is time to\r\nadjust international institutions to the reality of the\r\nmodern world.\r\nWe must now strive to establish fresh momentum\r\nin our work and begin genuine negotiations on the\r\nspecific aspects of a viable, fair and especially realistic\r\ncompromise. My delegation will continue to vigorously\r\nsupport any proposal that will make tangible the ideas of\r\nrepresentativeness, transparency and democratization of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nWe rely, Mr. President, on your energy and\r\nwisdom to guide our future work on this issue towards\r\nthe success that we all seek.\r\nMr. Schori (Sweden): Last year we had a\r\ncombined debate on the report of the Security Council\r\nand its possible enlargement. In the spirit of our\r\ncommon efforts to revitalize the work of this Assembly\r\nI will address both items in one statement, commencing\r\nwith the membership of the Security Council.\r\nThe debate this year, on a practically eternal issue,\r\nis much invigorated by the Secretary-General’s recent and\r\nclear call for radical reform of the United Nations. The\r\nworld has changed tremendously since the foundation of\r\nthe United Nations in 1945. We all agree that the United\r\nNations must adapt to changing realities if we want to\r\nsafeguard its primary role in international peace and\r\nsecurity. Mr. Annan put a challenge before us. Sweden\r\nwelcomes this challenge, and agrees with him that we\r\ncannot afford to delay dealing with the core issues.\r\nGlobal threats must be defined and addressed\r\ncollectively. Global security requires multilateral\r\nsolutions. Only the Security Council can provide\r\nlegitimacy to the use of force beyond the right of self-\r\ndefence. But this legitimacy is closely linked to how\r\nthe Security Council is perceived by the entire United\r\nNations membership and the international community as a\r\nwhole. The Council must therefore be representative of\r\nthe 191 Member States. Its composition must reflect the\r\ngeopolitical realities of the twenty-first century.\r\nA reform of the Security Council is thus essential\r\nfor the Council to stay relevant in the eyes of the\r\nworld. The deadlock on the composition can be broken.\r\nWe should not let the best become the enemy of the\r\ngood. Rather than trying to find the optimal solution\r\nfor decades to come, we should instead accept that any\r\nreform may have to be re-thought, in five or ten years’\r\ntime. A swift agreement on an expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council would demonstrate to the world that\r\nthis Organization is indeed prepared to adapt and\r\nadjust, in order to safeguard and strengthen its\r\nlegitimacy and efficiency in global politics.\r\nSweden therefore suggests that the Security Council\r\nbe enlarged with a number of non-permanent members,\r\nespecially from developing countries. Sweden believes\r\nthat an agreement on such an expansion could be\r\nreached fairly quickly, if we all adopt a flexible attitude\r\nconcerning our respective, national positions. Adding\r\nnon-permanent members now does not exclude the\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\npossibility of agreeing on additional permanent\r\nmembers at a later date.\r\nIn his report on the work of the Security Council,\r\nthe Secretary-General raises the issue of an increased\r\nworkload for the Council. It is therefore encouraging to\r\nnote that, in spite of this, the Council has become more\r\ntransparent towards the entire membership. Sweden\r\nwelcomes the increase of open meetings in the Council\r\nand we hope this practice continues.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to welcome the\r\nformat of the report of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly. It is encouraging that, for the second year, the\r\nmembers of the Security Council are using the new and\r\nmore user-friendly format, with the analytical summary\r\nand a substantially decreased number of pages. It is a\r\ngood example of how to modernize United Nations\r\nreporting.\r\nWe have momentum for reform, a window of\r\nopportunity. The Secretary-General’s report on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration\r\n(A/58/323), his speech made at the opening of the\r\ncurrent Assembly session and the tremendous support\r\nthat was demonstrated during the general debate should\r\nencourage us all to make change happen. Sweden stands\r\nready to fulfil its responsibilities, and it is determined to\r\nbe an active partner at this fork in the road; but\r\nultimately it is a matter of our collective effort.\r\nMr. De Ruyt (Belgium) (spoke in French): We can\r\nnot avoid a certain feeling of weariness when, once again,\r\nwe have to note with regret that the work of the Open-\r\nended Working Group charged with considering all\r\naspects of the reform of the Security Council has\r\nhardly made any progress since the fifty-seventh\r\nsession of the Assembly. And yet, we must be quite\r\nclear that we should not resign ourselves to the idea\r\nthat the reform of the Security Council is no longer\r\nnecessary, just because the work is now deadlocked.\r\nQuite the contrary: each year that passes reinforces our\r\nfeeling that the Council’s current composition no\r\nlonger reflects today’s geopolitical realities. We cannot\r\ncontinue to ignore this fact forever. Ultimately, it is the\r\ncredibility and the legitimacy of the Council that are at\r\nstake. If we do nothing, our inability itself will\r\ncontribute to eroding the credibility of the Council and\r\nof the United Nations in general. I do not think that this\r\nis a situation that anyone would want to see come\r\nabout, since the implications for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security would be quite dramatic.\r\nTherefore, we all need to ask the following\r\nquestion: are our national interests in the long-term\r\nbetter served by the refusal of some to make certain\r\nconcessions? Of course, we all have national positions\r\nto defend, and that is quite legitimate. But perhaps it is\r\ntime to recognize that it would be in our collective\r\ninterest to resolutely commit to a constructive search\r\nfor a compromise.\r\nTherefore my delegation totally supports what the\r\nSecretary-General said here in his statement to the\r\nGeneral Assembly on 23 September with regard to the\r\nneed to break the deadlock on this question and with\r\nregard to our responsibility for doing so. We\r\ncongratulate him for having taken the initiative to re-\r\nlaunch, at the highest level of the Organization, the\r\nprocess of reform. We therefore look forward with\r\ngreat interest to the proposals that will be made by the\r\npanel of eminent persons. As to the broader context of\r\nthe reform of the Council, the panel needs to shed new\r\nlight on our debate, and therefore we hope that this\r\ndevelopment will give new impetus to implementing\r\nthe reform and that it will lend new dynamism at the\r\npolitical level.\r\nIn fact, it is not so much new ideas that we need;\r\nthe main elements that are needed for a solution are\r\nalready on the negotiating table. What is lacking is the\r\npolitical will to take the lead, to take the necessary\r\nsteps to bring the positions closer together.\r\nThe only thing Belgium wants here is to bring about\r\na balanced, realistic reform that would correspond to the\r\nwishes of the vast majority of Member States, a reform\r\nthat would strengthen the representativeness — and\r\ntherefore the legitimacy — of the Security Council,\r\nwithout jeopardizing its efficiency. With a group of\r\ncountries that share this approach, my delegation has\r\nintroduced some pragmatic proposals that seek to\r\nexpand both categories of membership, permanent and\r\nnon-permanent, as well as to limit the use of the veto.\r\nWe remain convinced that these are the parameters that\r\nare necessary to arrive at a solution of compromise. I\r\ncan assure you that my delegation will continue to\r\nactively participate in the work of the Working Group in\r\nthe same constructive spirit that inspired our proposals.\r\nYou can count on our full support in this endeavour.\r\nMr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nPlease allow me to express my thanks to Mr. Kavan,\r\nChairman of the Open-Ended Working Group of the\r\nlast General Assembly session, and the two Vice-\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nChairmen, Ambassador Ingolfsson and Ambassador\r\nKasemsarn for their hard work to ensure the smooth\r\nprogress of the Open-ended Working Group. We\r\nbelieve that under the leadership of Mr. Hunte, the new\r\nChairman, the Open-ended Working Group will\r\ncontinue to hold constructive discussions.\r\nThe past year has been an extraordinary one for\r\nthe Security Council. On the one hand, positive\r\nprogress has been made in the efforts to help seek\r\nsolutions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nLiberia and Côte d’Ivoire, thus contributing to the\r\nmaintenance of peace and stability of the countries and\r\nregions concerned. This has been widely acclaimed by\r\nthe international community, especially the African\r\ncountries. On the other hand, the Security Council has\r\nbeen confronted with unprecedented challenges on the\r\nIraqi issue. Some people have thus felt frustrated about\r\nthe failure of the Security Council to reach consensus\r\non that issue. Some are worried about whether the\r\nSecurity Council is able to fulfil the responsibility of\r\nmaintaining peace and security. However, the general\r\ndebate of the current session shows that the basic\r\nconsensus of the vast number of Member States\r\nremains unchanged. That is, faced with this new\r\nsituation, the role of the Security Council in\r\nmaintaining world peace and security should be further\r\nenhanced, not weakened. The authority of the Security\r\nCouncil should be reinforced and not reduced.\r\nAs was pointed out by Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan during the General Assembly general debate, it\r\nis necessary to reform United Nations organs, including\r\nthe Security Council, so that they can better respond to\r\nthe new issues created by the new situation. China\r\nshares the view of the Secretary-General. We have\r\nconsistently supported the efforts to keep pace with the\r\ntimes and conduct appropriate and necessary reform of\r\nthe Security Council. Reform should be aimed at\r\nenhancing the capacity of the Security Council to face\r\nnew challenges and threats and at realizing more\r\nequitable representation.\r\nSecurity Council reform should start with its\r\nunbalanced composition. Currently, representation of\r\nthe developing countries is insufficient in the Council.\r\nPriority should therefore be given to increasing\r\nrepresentation of the developing countries according to\r\nthe principle of equitable geographic distribution.\r\nDiscussions on increasing the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council have been going on for ten years at\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group. In the current\r\ncircumstances, we should have not only the patience\r\nfor extensive and in-depth discussions and the urgency\r\nto speed up reforms, but also the wisdom to make the\r\nappropriate compromises. The Chinese delegation is\r\nready to continue to take an active part in the Open-\r\nended Working Group discussions in a constructive\r\nmanner. We look forward to creative discussions\r\namong all parties during the current General Assembly\r\nsession in this regard.\r\nWe also support the Security Council in the\r\nfurther improvement of its working methods to\r\nincrease transparency of its work and its efficiency. In\r\nrecent years, marked progress has been made in\r\nimproving working methods by holding more open\r\nmeetings and through good communication and\r\ncooperation with troop-contributing countries. This has\r\nbeen well received by many Member States. China is\r\nprepared to continue to work with the other members\r\nof the Security Council in that regard.\r\nChina welcomes the proposal put forward by the\r\nSecretary-General on setting up a high-level panel of\r\neminent persons. We believe that the composition of\r\nthe panel should reflect geographical balance. We also\r\nhope to see the panel yield positive proposals that will\r\nreflect a consensus to provide the majority of Member\r\nStates the basis for further discussion and decision.\r\nMr. Alcalay (Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nYesterday the delegation of Venezuela addressed the\r\nAssembly to acknowledge the Security Council’s\r\nefforts to improve the preparation of its report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, as many previous speakers have\r\nhighlighted at this very meeting.\r\nToday we intend to focus in the second part of\r\nour statement on the issue of equitable representation\r\non the Security Council and of increasing its\r\nmembership. Unfortunately, we cannot arrive at the\r\nsame optimistic conclusions on these issues as on\r\nothers. We note that the efforts made in the Security\r\nCouncil Working Group on equitable representation\r\nand on increasing its membership have not produced\r\nthe results the international community, represented in\r\nthe Assembly, has been seeking for more than 10 years.\r\nThe issue that brings us together today is vitally\r\nimportant to our Organization at a crucially important\r\ntime to mankind. The Security Council, a principal\r\norgan of this system, must regain and consolidate its\r\nauthority, capabilities and efficiency. Despite the fact\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nthat another year has gone by without progress being\r\nmade by the Working Group in attaining the proposed\r\nobjectives, and despite the many efforts made and\r\nresources invested, every passing year reveals to us the\r\nincreasingly pressing need to achieve the consensus\r\nnecessary among Member States to make the Security\r\nCouncil an equitable and democratic body adapted to\r\nthis new era.\r\nWe believe that Security Council reform must be\r\ncomprehensive so that the issues of its expansion, the\r\nuse of the veto and the working methods it should have\r\nto be able to adapt itself to current circumstances can\r\nbe dealt with jointly.\r\nWe note with satisfaction the changes in the\r\nCouncil’s working methods. This has been observed on\r\nmany occasions. There has been undeniable progress in\r\nterms of holding more meetings and public debates, the\r\nholding of briefings that are very useful to non-member\r\nStates, the more equitable treatment being accorded to\r\nnon-member States on the speakers’ list for public\r\ndebates and the greater availability of public information\r\non the development and results of the work of the\r\nCouncil. There can be no doubt that that reflects progress.\r\nHowever, the enthusiasm we feel over these\r\nchanges gives way to something else when we consider\r\nthe issues of the veto and of the increase in the\r\nCouncil’s membership, progress on both of which\r\nremains deadlocked. We note with frustration that the\r\nsame readiness shown to advance in the areas I\r\nmentioned earlier is not evident in the same way with\r\nrespect to these two other aspects, which are essential.\r\nFor a long time, Venezuela has supported\r\nelimination of the veto, given its anti-democratic and\r\nanachronistic nature. Authentic democratization of the\r\nSecurity Council requires elimination of that privilege or,\r\nat the very least, its regulation, in order to restrict its use\r\nto what is absolutely necessary. Our hope is that there\r\nwill be just representation, particularly of developing\r\ncountries, on the expanded Council. We have taken one\r\nmore step towards that end by lending our support, in\r\nVenezuela, my country, to Brazil’s aspirations to be\r\nconsidered for permanent membership on the Security\r\nCouncil. We reaffirm that support today, as we are\r\ntalking about this institution. We do that every time the\r\nissue arises and will continue to do so.\r\nOur country has been participating with great\r\ninterest in the work of the Working Group in an attempt,\r\nto the extent possible, to make effective progress. We\r\nhave encountered obvious difficulties, but they must not\r\ndiscourage us; rather they should lead us to pool our full\r\nefforts and expectations for the initiative introduced by\r\nthe Secretary-General, when, just a few days ago in the\r\nAssembly, he called for the creation of a group of\r\neminent personalities to, among other things, review\r\nthe functioning of the main organs of the United\r\nNations and to recommend ways of strengthening the\r\nOrganization. We look forward with great optimism to\r\nthe outcome of that work and the selection of those\r\npersonalities, which should be representative of the full\r\ncontext of the United Nations membership.\r\nOur Organization, like any system, will not be\r\nable to improve or recover from the ills afflicting it if it\r\ndoes not receive comprehensive treatment that deals\r\nappropriately with all organs that are not functioning\r\nproperly and that are causing dysfunction within the\r\nsystem. That treatment must involve the Security\r\nCouncil, which, as a main organ of our United Nations\r\nand as an essential component of achieving substantial\r\nchange, must also be altered and reformed.\r\nTo the extent that we apply the saying that an\r\nounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure, we\r\nwill be ensuring a healthy and sustainable life for our\r\nOrganization. Toward that end, we strongly appeal to\r\nall Member States to continue to strive and to focus our\r\ndetermination to attain that goal.\r\nMr. McIvor (New Zealand): Last year we\r\ncombined the debate on the Security Council report\r\nwith that on Security Council reform. That was a good\r\napproach. It saved time, and the discussion reflected\r\nobvious linkages between the issues involved in the\r\ntwo items. We hope that that practice can formally be\r\nreinstated in the future, as suggested by a number of\r\nprevious speakers. I will nevertheless comment today\r\non both items to avoid having taken the floor twice.\r\nEvents over the past year have made the need for\r\nSecurity Council reform greater than ever. The Council\r\nhas had an extraordinary profile around the world.\r\nPeople watched closely as deliberations on Iraq\r\nproceeded. There was a very public debate about the\r\neffectiveness of the Council in dealing with threats to\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMany rightly questioned whether a body designed\r\nin the aftermath of the Second World War could be\r\neffective some 60 years later. Yet despite such\r\ncriticisms, the fact remained that there was widespread\r\nglobal support for the Council’s role and great\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nimportance attached to its decisions. People want a\r\nSecurity Council playing a lead role in international peace\r\nand security; they also want a more representative\r\nCouncil. There is near-universal agreement on the need\r\nfor the Organization to evolve and to reflect the world\r\nin which we now find ourselves. The challenge is how\r\nto respond to that need.\r\nNew Zealand’s views on Security Council reform\r\nare well known. We strongly believe that to be credible\r\nand effective, the Council must have the full trust and\r\nsupport of the international community. As the pre-\r\neminent global legal body addressing threats to peace and\r\nsecurity, the Security Council must be seen as more\r\nrepresentative of today’s international community.\r\nTrust and respect derive from both the conduct and\r\nthe composition of the Council; one without the other is\r\nnot enough. The Working Group has made progress over\r\nthe past few years on working methods. That should\r\ncontinue. But no matter how effectively the existing\r\nCouncil discharges its duties, if it is not considered\r\nsufficiently representative, its authority is diminished.\r\nThe Working Group cannot break the impasse on\r\nstructural Security Council reform. Our hope must now\r\nbe that the Secretary-General’s timely initiative to\r\nestablish a panel on United Nations reform will bring\r\nfresh impetus to Security Council reform. New Zealand\r\nfully supports the Secretary-General’s holistic\r\napproach. The panel should not shy away from\r\ndifficult, fundamental questions. We look forward to an\r\nindependent, honest and fresh assessment of where we\r\nneed to go from here.\r\nWe would also appeal to Member States to make\r\nthe most of the opportunity afforded by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s panel. We very much hope that Member\r\nStates will be open to this process. While we may have\r\nanxieties about the options and the potential implications\r\nof those options, we should not step away from exploring\r\nthe possibilities. In particular, we would stress that\r\nreform of the Security Council — or indeed of the\r\nwhole United Nations — is not a zero-sum game; it is\r\nnot about winners and losers. We can all be winners. If\r\ndiscussions are premised on the vital need to make the\r\nSecurity Council more effective in the twenty-first\r\ncentury, then everyone will have gained.\r\nFinally, I should like to comment briefly on the\r\nCouncil’s report (A/58/2). This year’s report again\r\nreflects the increasing workload and complexity of\r\nissues before the Council. There have been\r\nencouraging developments to further enhance Council\r\nconsultation with Member States in a number of areas,\r\nnot least peacekeeping, where there have been real\r\nefforts to engage with troop-contributing countries. In\r\nterms of our own region, New Zealand particularly\r\nwelcomes the Council’s open approach to discussions\r\non Bougainville and Timor-Leste.\r\nHowever, there have been some areas where the\r\nCouncil has remained worryingly closed to outside\r\nconsultation. While we recognize that there are times\r\nwhen it is important for consultations to take place\r\nbehind closed doors to achieve consensus, it is\r\nimportant nonetheless that Member States be kept\r\ninformed of the issues under consideration. Closed\r\ndoors can lead all too easily to misunderstanding and\r\nmisinformation. Lack of communication can undermine\r\nthe very work the Council is trying to achieve.\r\nThe bottom line is that, more than ever before, we\r\nlook to the Council to recognize that all Member States\r\nhave an inherent legitimate interest in being kept\r\ninformed — and sometimes actively engaged — on\r\nissues under Council consideration. That principle was\r\nwisely recognized in the Charter. It is a logical\r\nconsequence of the fact that the Security Council’s\r\ndecisions are binding upon Member States in\r\ninternational law. They affect and belong to us all.\r\nMr. Drobnjak (Croatia): The basic pretext for\r\nour debate is well known and simple: the importance and\r\nthe workload of the Security Council are increasing year\r\nafter year, in parallel to the complexity of issues in\r\ninternational relations. The Council is in dire need of\r\nreform. We all know that it must be reformed, and we\r\nhave a number of ideas as to how to reform it, but we are\r\nunable to reform it. So what shall we do about reform?\r\nAfter having listened to the statements during the\r\ngeneral debate of the fifty-eighth General Assembly\r\nsession, delivered by the Presidents, Prime Ministers and\r\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of Member States — as well\r\nas the statements delivered under the item of the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/58/1) — we have no doubt that strong support exists\r\nfor reform of the Security Council. We have not heard a\r\nsingle voice raised against it. In the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, our Presidents and Prime Ministers\r\nunquestionably declared their political will to embrace\r\nthe process of Council reform. Yet, after more than a\r\ndecade of negotiations, we have not moved towards any\r\ngenuine progress in reforming the Security Council.\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nHow can we explain that inconsistency?\r\nProviding an honest and comprehensive answer to that\r\nquestion is the first essential step towards reform.\r\nTalking about reform will not suffice if we are not\r\nready to identify the bottlenecks and to have an open,\r\nstraightforward discussion on the matter.\r\nWe have taken a number of small positive steps\r\nforward in the past year. We highly praise the new format\r\nof the report of the Security Council, which represents a\r\nnotable improvement in the Council’s working methods.\r\nIn its new format, the report is much easier to read and\r\nrepresents a well-organized working document with a\r\ngreater degree of transparency. It provides us with a\r\ncomprehensive picture of all the work done by the\r\nSecurity Council in these uncertain times.\r\nAnd indeed these times are uncertain, as much as\r\nthey are a challenge to international peace and security.\r\nThey are underlined by new types of conflicts, like the\r\nIraq war, and by more complex peacekeeping missions,\r\nlike some of those in Africa. As the Secretary-General\r\nhas rightly stated, we must be aware of the changes in\r\nthe international security environment that represent\r\nchallenges — which today are predominantly global —\r\nto peace and security. That is another reason why it is\r\nmore important than ever before to have an efficient\r\nand representative Security Council — one that has the\r\nconfidence of the entire membership and is supported\r\nby world public opinion.\r\nWe deeply believe that we cannot achieve our\r\nobjective through partial reform, tackling only bits and\r\npieces of the problem. We need comprehensive and\r\nthorough reform that can be achieved only in a package\r\nencompassing all the elements of cluster I and cluster II\r\nissues. Provisional or partial solutions will only force us\r\ninto an endless circle of new rounds of negotiations.\r\nThroughout the years, we have demonstrated our ability\r\nto debate. It is now time to show that we can produce\r\nresults, not merely words.\r\nMajor decisions on Council reform remain beyond\r\nour reach. We place our confidence in the President of\r\nthe General Assembly — who will chair the Open-\r\nended Working Group on Security Council Reform\r\nduring this session — in finding new avenues to begin\r\nthe negotiation process. The importance of the problem\r\nis such that no obstacle or disagreement, regardless of\r\nits nature or size, can be an excuse for derailing the\r\ndebate.\r\nIt is not only time that is pressing us to find\r\nsolutions to Security Council reform; it is also an ever-\r\nchanging political environment and its dynamics that\r\nmight leave the Organization behind because it is too\r\nrigid in its structure or too slow in its reactions. The\r\nability to deal effectively with pressing issues — whether\r\nof a political or an organizational nature — is the ultimate\r\nsign of the Organization’s relevance. If we want the\r\nOrganization to remain relevant and to maintain its\r\npivotal role in the new era, we must urgently address\r\nthe problem of Council reform despite all the problems\r\nand political sensitivities we may encounter.\r\nCroatia stands ready to participate actively in the\r\nforthcoming work and to make its contribution to\r\nsuccessful reform.\r\nMr. Mra (Myanmar): First of all, I should like to\r\nexpress my delegation’s appreciation to Ambassador\r\nNegroponte of the United States of America, President\r\nof the Security Council for the month of October 2003,\r\nfor introducing the report of the Council covering the\r\nperiod from 1 August 2002 to 31 July 2003 (A/58/2).\r\nAs the Security Council is an organ primarily\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, its report is an important document for\r\nconsideration by the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to observe that the\r\nSecurity Council has taken a number of initiatives in\r\nintroducing reforms into its working methods. The\r\nholding of frequent public meetings and wrap-up\r\nsessions and the issuing of press releases containing all\r\nstatements by the President of the Council on behalf of its\r\nmembers show a growing trend towards transparency.\r\nThe report did not lose focus in dealing with priority\r\nissues such as Iraq, the Middle East, Afghanistan and\r\nAfrica. However, there have been comments that an\r\nanalytical report would serve a more useful purpose\r\nthan a merely descriptive report.\r\nThematic discussions allow participation by the\r\nlarger membership in the Council’s work. In my\r\ndelegation’s opinion, such discussions can be fruitful only\r\nwhen they are directly related to the Council’s work.\r\nLinking extraneous issues that are not directly related to\r\nthe agenda of the Council can only serve to complicate\r\nmatters and to detract from its original purpose.\r\nCounter-terrorism remains one of the Security\r\nCouncil’s major areas of concern. My delegation attaches\r\nimportance to the work of the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee, established pursuant to resolution 1373\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\n(2001). The fact that an overwhelming number of\r\nMember States have submitted reports to the\r\nCommittee detailing the measures they have taken\r\nagainst terrorism amply demonstrates their resolve and\r\ncommitment in fighting terrorism. The initiative taken by\r\nthe Committee to convene a major meeting of some 60\r\ninternational, regional and subregional organizations on\r\n6 March 2003 will also enhance the effectiveness of\r\nglobal action against terrorism.\r\nMyanmar is cooperating closely with the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee. It has already submitted\r\nto the Committee its second report, along with relevant\r\ndocuments, reflecting the legislative and executive\r\nmeasures that the Government has taken. The third report\r\nis being prepared in coordination with the various\r\nministries concerned, and we intend to submit it in due\r\ncourse. Here, my delegation would like to reiterate that\r\nMyanmar is opposed to all forms of terrorism.\r\nWhile some of the procedural changes and\r\ninitiatives undertaken by the Security Council are to be\r\ncommended, many of us continue to be concerned over\r\nthe unrepresentative and undemocratic nature of the\r\ncomposition and decision-making process of the\r\nCouncil. The Millennium Summit endorsed the need to\r\nextensively reform the Security Council in all its\r\naspects. Although there are differing opinions, there is\r\nat least a consensus view that, at the bare minimum, the\r\nCouncil should be expanded to conform to the present-\r\nday realities of the enlarged membership of the United\r\nNations. We welcome the progress achieved so far in\r\nthe consideration of issues dealing with the working\r\nmethods of the Security Council, although substantial\r\ndifferences in views remain on other issues.\r\nMyanmar has had several occasions in the past to\r\nstate its position on reform of the Security Council.\r\nMyanmar holds the view — together with other members\r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement — that Council expansion\r\nand reform should be integral parts of a single package.\r\nIf the Security Council is to become more\r\nrepresentative of contemporary political and economic\r\nrealities, it should be expanded in both categories.\r\nOn the question of the veto — which is one of the\r\nkey issues of Council reform — an ideal solution in the\r\ndemocratization process should be the abolition of the\r\nveto. However, pending such abolition, we should limit\r\nits application to the provisions of Chapter VII of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. It is also our view that new\r\npermanent members of the Security Council should\r\nenjoy the same rights and privileges as the current\r\nmembers.\r\nMy delegation agrees with the Working Group’s\r\nrecommendations that, based on discussions in\r\npreceding years, cluster I and cluster II issues should\r\ncontinue to be considered in a similar and balanced\r\nmanner.\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has stated that\r\n“Reform is not an event; it is a process” (A/51/950, para.\r\n25). It has been 10 years since that process started with\r\nthe establishment of the Working Group in 1993. Once,\r\nin 1965, the Security Council was expanded from 11 to\r\n15 members. The United Nations is therefore not a\r\nstranger to reform. With a demonstration of realism\r\nand political will, we can take the reform process\r\nnearer to achieving its goal. In order to build further on\r\nthe results so far achieved and to further accelerate the\r\nprocess, my delegation fully supports the view that the\r\nWorking Group should continue its activities at the\r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly.\r\nBefore concluding, my delegation would like to\r\nexpress its appreciation to Mr. Jan Kavan, President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session and\r\nChairman of the Working Group; and to Ambassadors\r\nThorsteinn Ingólffson and Chuchai Kasemsarn, who\r\nserved as Vice-Chairmen of the Working Group, for a\r\njob well done.\r\nMr. Mmualefe (Botswana): I have the honour to\r\npresent this statement on behalf of Ambassador Dube\r\nof Botswana, as he has been detained at other meetings\r\nthis afternoon.\r\nAllow me, at the outset, to align myself with and\r\nreiterate my delegation’s commitment to the position of\r\nthe African Group on this important matter.\r\nIt is now ten years since the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and Other Matters Related to the Security\r\nCouncil began its deliberations. Yet, regrettably, very\r\nlittle progress has been achieved to date. The current\r\nreport of the Open-ended Working Group, as with\r\nprevious reports, reflects considerable divergence of\r\nviews on issues related to the expansion of the\r\nmembership of the Council, as well as its decision-\r\nmaking, including the use of the veto. We note,\r\nhowever, that there is more agreement on how the\r\nCouncil should conduct its business, that is, its\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nworking methods, and that, in practice, there are now\r\nmore open debates in which non-members participate.\r\nThe present membership of the Security Council\r\nis not reflective of the geo-political realities of the\r\ntwenty-first century, which are significantly different\r\nfrom those of 1945, when the United Nations was\r\nfounded. The United Nations of today has all world\r\ncultures and socio-political systems represented in its\r\nmembership. The Security Council of today does not in\r\nany form reflect this social, cultural and linguistic\r\ndiversity. Its composition remains predominantly Euro-\r\ncentred, a fact which, by itself, is a reflection of the\r\nlingering influence and dominance of a bygone period\r\nof history and which can no longer be acceptable in the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe challenges before the United Nations are now\r\nvaried and complex. They require the participation of\r\nall Member States if we are to confront them\r\neffectively. The responsibility of the United Nations in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, in\r\nparticular, has greatly increased. The demise of the\r\ncold war has not resulted in the peace dividends we all\r\nhoped for. Instead, complex and destructive intra- and\r\ninter-State conflicts have erupted, and the proliferation\r\nof nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction has not been halted.\r\nThe authority and integrity of the Security\r\nCouncil is now being tested as never before. It is the\r\nresponsibility of all Member States to ensure its\r\neffectiveness. It would thus defy logic if the\r\nmembership of the Security Council, especially in the\r\nnon-permanent category, remained unchanged and the\r\ngreater number of the United Nations membership did\r\nnot participate on equal terms in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nVarious proposals on Security Council reform\r\nhave been provided by regional groups of the United\r\nNations membership and by individual Member States,\r\nin the context of the Open-ended Working Group and\r\nother General Assembly debates, and these are worthy\r\nof consideration. My delegation aligns itself with the\r\nposition of the African Union in which the Union seeks\r\nthe allocation of two permanent and two new non-\r\npermanent seats, the utilization of which would be\r\ndetermined by the African Union itself. This and other\r\nproposals from other regional groups, particularly from\r\ndeveloping countries, are worthy of the consideration\r\nby this Assembly.\r\nFrustrating as it may be that, after years of\r\nintense debate on this issue, not much progress has\r\nbeen achieved, we should not relent in our efforts to\r\nachieve meaningful reform of the Security Council. My\r\ndelegation attaches great importance to the issue of\r\nCouncil reform because it is central to the success and\r\nexistence of our Organization. For us, it is important\r\nthat the membership of the Security Council truly\r\nreflect the membership of the United Nations in terms\r\nof representation. Bringing developing countries into\r\nmembership of the Security Council on the basis of the\r\nsovereign equality of States would help strengthen\r\ntheir role in the maintenance of peace and security.\r\nThe working methods of the Security Council\r\nalso require further improvement. More public debates\r\nshould be held with the general membership of the\r\nUnited Nations, so that decisions that the Security\r\nCouncil makes reflect the collective will of the\r\ninternational community. Informal consultations of the\r\nCouncil on various issues should become an exception,\r\nand should not substitute for transparency and\r\naccountability.\r\nThe use of the veto, enjoyed by the five\r\npermanent members of the Security Council, requires\r\nurgent review. Although there may have been strong\r\narguments by some permanent members of the Council\r\nto the effect that it is an effective decision-making tool,\r\nin practice it has been used by some to preserve narrow\r\nnational interests, and this clearly is an untenable\r\nsituation. The veto should have no place in an\r\nappropriately expanded Security Council, and should be\r\nreplaced with a democratic decision-making procedure\r\nbased on the principle of the sovereign equality of States.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate Botswana’s\r\ncommitment to the comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council to ensure that all States, large or\r\nsmall, can play their rightful role in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Botswana will\r\ncontinue to play its part in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup. We also welcome the decision of the United\r\nNations Secretary-General to appoint a high-level\r\npanel of eminent personalities, which will review ways\r\nof strengthening the United Nations.\r\nMr. Mahbubani (Singapore): Mr. President, I\r\napologize to you for speaking at great length,\r\nyesterday, on the report of the Security Council. I will\r\ntry to be briefer today, as I speak about the question\r\nbefore us.\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nThere are two reasons why we can be briefer\r\ntoday. One is, of course, that we have spoken on this\r\nsubject for almost ten years now. We have given all the\r\nspeeches that we can possibly give on the subject and if\r\nany of my colleagues are interested in what our views\r\nare, we will be happy to share with them some very\r\nthoughtful, long and comprehensive speeches that we\r\nhave given. The second reason why we can afford to be\r\nbriefer today is that, when we come to discuss the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposals for revitalization, we\r\nwill of course, once again, revisit the issue of Security\r\nCouncil reform.\r\nSo what I propose to do today is to present three\r\npoints. The first point is about why we have not made\r\nany progress so far in Security Council reform. The\r\nsecond point is about the roles and interests of small\r\nStates in Security Council reform and the third point is\r\nabout the question of the veto power, which I see\r\neveryone has been addressing. I’ll try to do this as\r\nquickly as I can.\r\nMy first point is a question: why has reform of\r\nthe Security Council not succeeded? Of course, the\r\ngreat paradox here is that, if one listens to all the\r\nstatements made so far, there seems to be almost total\r\nagreement that the Council is probably a relic from\r\n1945 and, as we are now in the twenty-first century, it\r\nmust be reformed. Yet despite such nearly unanimous\r\nagreement, we are not moving ahead with reform. We\r\nbelieve that the key reason that we have not moved\r\nahead with it after 10 years of discussions is that we\r\nhave put the cart before the horse. We are discussing\r\nthe shape of the cart and how many seats it should\r\nhave — that is, how many first-class, second-class and\r\nthird-class seats here should be in a reformed Security\r\nCouncil — but we have not yet agreed where we want\r\nto take the cart once we have put a horse in front of it.\r\nIndeed, that is the fundamental problem in this House:\r\namong the 191 Member States, there is as yet no\r\nconsensus on what the Security Council’s primary role\r\nand responsibilities should be.\r\nBy the way, I can say that, when Singapore was\r\non the Security Council, several members compared\r\nthe Council’s work to that of a fire department. A fire\r\ndepartment — like the New York Fire Department —\r\nreacts automatically, regardless of whether the fire is\r\non Park Avenue or in Harlem, the Bronx or some other\r\narea. But the Security Council, whose job is to react to\r\nconflicts, does not react in such a dispassionate\r\nfashion. It reacts when the interests of the major\r\nPowers are affected and remains silent when they are\r\nnot affected. Why have we allowed that to happen? The\r\nreason is that Member States have not reached a\r\ncommon understanding of what the Council’s role and\r\nresponsibilities should be. So my first point is, let us\r\nfirst agree what its role and responsibilities should be\r\nbefore we move on to discussing such matters as its\r\nstructure and its expansion.\r\nMy second point concerns the role of the interests\r\nof small States. It is clear that neither the major Powers\r\nnor the middle Powers need the Security Council for their\r\nsecurity. But the small States — especially those with\r\npopulations of fewer than 10 million — are the countries\r\nthat need the Council the most, and they need an effective\r\nCouncil that works. How does one explain to States\r\nwith populations of fewer than 10 million — which\r\nmake up approximately half of the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations — that an expansion of the Council\r\nwill suit their interests and indeed will make the world\r\na safer and more secure place? We hope that those who\r\naspire to permanent membership or reform of the\r\nSecurity Council will address that point to small States\r\nand explain how a reformed Council will benefit them.\r\nLet me mention in passing that it is unfortunate\r\nthat small States are put in the position of having to\r\nchoose between their bilateral interests and their\r\nmultilateral interests. In their bilateral interests, they\r\nhave reasons to maintain good relationships with the\r\nmajor Powers and the middle Powers, so they indicate\r\ntheir support for this or that candidate. But their\r\nmultilateral interests lie in having an effective Security\r\nCouncil, not necessarily one that is as large as it can\r\npossibly be. I think it is unfair to put small States in the\r\nposition of having to choose between their bilateral\r\ninterests and their multilateral interests, and we hope\r\nthat that will now cease.\r\nMy third and final point concerns the question of\r\nthe veto. Here, the tragedy is that all the attention is\r\nfocused on the formal use of the veto. I hope our\r\ncolleagues heard what the representative of Spain said\r\nyesterday about the hidden vetoes — the ones that are\r\nused every day in the course of informal consultations.\r\nNo light has been shed on all those hidden vetoes, but\r\nwe need to understand their role within the actual\r\nfunctioning of the Security Council. Frankly, if we are\r\ngoing to talk about expanding the Council and adding\r\nnew permanent members to it, all of us should first\r\nreach an understanding of the responsibilities of\r\npermanent membership. The one great mistake we\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nmade in 1945 was to give away the privilege of the\r\nveto power without attaching any responsibilities to\r\nthat privilege. Consequently, we face a very strange\r\nsituation today. When there is a crisis in the world and\r\none turns to the major Powers and the middle Powers\r\nto ask them to help resolve it, they tend to run away;\r\nvery few of them will volunteer to help to resolve it.\r\nOn the other hand, when one says that there are\r\npermanent seats available on the Security Council —\r\nwhich gives one primary responsibility for handling\r\nthreats to international peace and security — there are\r\nmany volunteers. The reason why there are many\r\nvolunteers for permanent membership is that there are\r\nno responsibilities attached to permanent membership.\r\nSo we should like to suggest that, if the Council truly\r\nwants to resolve the question of who should have\r\npermanent membership and who should have the veto,\r\nit should attach specific, defined responsibilities to\r\npermanent membership and the veto power. I think that\r\nmight set us on the road to Security Council reform.\r\nIn conclusion, to avoid any misunderstanding, it\r\nis important that I emphasize that we support reform of\r\nthe Security Council. As a member of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, we support its views on reform and\r\nexpansion of the Council, and we have said before that\r\nmany countries — including my own — would agree\r\nthat, when general agreement is reached on expansion\r\nof the Council, Japan and Germany should be among\r\nthe new permanent members. Those are things we have\r\nsaid consistently, and we stand by them. Frankly,\r\nhowever, we believe that if we are to move ahead with\r\nSecurity Council reform, we must first return to basics.\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): At the beginning of the current Assembly\r\nsession, the world’s leaders agreed with near unanimity\r\nthat the challenges faced by the Organization are\r\nunprecedented. One of the greatest difficulties\r\nconfronting our world today is the confusion in the\r\nsystem of basic values and concepts and others’ misuse\r\nof that confusion out of either good or ill will. That has\r\nled to chaos in the system of international relations.\r\nThe problem is exacerbated by the fact that some\r\npresume that they have a monopoly on facts and can\r\nsee what others cannot, and then act on that basis.\r\nOur past deliberations on Security Council reform\r\nwere based on realistic criteria that attempted to\r\nrespond to the changed circumstances that determine,\r\ninter alia, the Council’s membership, its working\r\nmethods and the veto power. Today, it is no longer a\r\nquestion of expanding the Security Council’s\r\nmembership; our deliberations proceed from the need\r\nto meet the new challenges facing the system of\r\ninternational peace and security. The Secretary-General\r\nwas correct when, in paragraph 2 of his report on the\r\nwork of the Organization (A/58/1), he said:\r\n“Undoubtedly, in the area of peace and\r\nsecurity, it has been a trying year for the United\r\nNations. The war in Iraq severely tested the\r\nprinciple of collective security and the resilience\r\nof the Organization. Rarely in its fifty-eight-year\r\nhistory have such dire forecasts been made about\r\nthe United Nations. The United Nations will\r\nemerge strengthened if we make a measured\r\nappreciation of what happened ...”.\r\nSecurity Council reform should be based on\r\nseveral premises that are in keeping with the Charter and\r\nthe historical circumstances, under which the United\r\nNations was founded. The preamble of the Charter states:\r\n“We the peoples of the United Nations,\r\ndetermined to save succeeding generations from\r\nthe scourge of war, which twice has brought\r\nuntold sorrow to mankind”.\r\nThe founders of the United Nations, intent on\r\navoiding the historical circumstances that led to two\r\nworld wars, emphasized several concepts related to the\r\nsystem of international peace and security, the most\r\nimportant of which is the implementation of the\r\nprinciple of collective security in order to give\r\nlegitimacy to this principle. The Secretary-General\r\nemphasized this in his report on the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, where he pointed out that cooperation\r\nbetween the countries of the world is more essential\r\nnow than ever. He also emphasized that the Charter\r\nshould be the basis for providing legitimacy to all\r\naction at the international level.\r\nDemocracy in international relations has became\r\nmore urgent than ever in a world in which\r\ncommunications networks, relations, ties, interests and\r\ndisadvantages have gone beyond regional and local\r\nframeworks. The veto power is one of the most\r\npronounced manifestations of the absence of\r\ndemocracy in international relations. If it is true that\r\nany organization in the world needs to strive to achieve\r\nstability, then justice should be its guiding source, in\r\nkeeping with the relationship between justice and law\r\nin any legal system.\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nBased on that same concept, and in keeping with\r\nthe resolutions of the Non-Aligned Movement adopted\r\nat its summits and conferences, the use of veto should\r\nbe restricted, with the long-term aim of its elimination,\r\nas it has been proven that international peace and\r\nsecurity have been greatest victims of the veto. It has\r\nbeen abused and has become a tool for discrimination,\r\nnot only between countries, but also in the\r\nimplementation of United Nations resolutions,\r\nincluding of the Security Council itself. Therefore, it is\r\nimportant now to establish controls and criteria to avert\r\nthe arbitrary use of veto.\r\nReform of the Security Council and increasing its\r\nmembership should be an integral part of a joint\r\ncomprehensive endeavour, in which due consideration\r\nwould be given to the principle of equal sovereignty\r\namong nations and equitable geographical representation,\r\nas well as to achieving transparency, responsibility and\r\ndemocracy in the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil, including its decision-making process.\r\nExpansion of the Council membership in both\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories must ensure\r\nequitable representation for developing countries, in\r\naccordance with the position of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement. In that connection, we wish to mention that\r\nthe Arab Group has always emphasized at previous\r\nconsultations the need for a permanent seat to be\r\nallocated to the Arab countries, as part of any future\r\nreform process. Arab countries, supporting expansion\r\nof the Council membership, should have one\r\npermanent seat, to be filled on a rotating basis and in\r\nkeeping with the procedures adopted by the League of\r\nArab States. Two non-permanent seats should also be\r\nallocated to Arab countries, to be filled on a rotating\r\nbasis, as is the current practice. The Council membership\r\nshould be expanded to include 26 members.\r\nDiscussing reform of the Security Council and\r\nincreasing its membership prompts us to attach special\r\nimportance to the working methods of the Council,\r\nwhich is no less important an issue than is expansion of\r\nthe Council. This requires the establishment of controls\r\nand criteria, emphasized by summits of the Non-\r\nAligned countries, in a way that ensures non-use of the\r\nveto in an arbitrary manner and that strengthens\r\ndemocracy and transparency in decision-making and\r\nthat ensures implementation of Security Council\r\nresolutions in a more balanced and equitable way,\r\nwithout resorting to double standards.\r\nExpansion of the Council should be guided by the\r\nfact that its ability to mobilize the greatest possible\r\nsupport for its resolutions and measures would be\r\nstrengthened if they were seen to represent the\r\ninternational community more broadly, in keeping with\r\nArticle 24 of the Charter, which stipulates that the\r\nSecurity Council act on behalf of the United Nations\r\ngeneral membership. Security Council reform should also\r\nbe carried out pursuant to Article 108 of the Charter.\r\nEnormous efforts have been made during the past\r\n10 years, and the delicate nature of the reform process\r\nrequires that we achieve consensus. Sincere efforts\r\nalone can facilitate the work of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on Security Council reform, which is the only\r\nframework for achieving that desired objective.\r\nMr. Hannesson (Iceland): Having not taken part\r\nin the debate earlier this week on the report of the\r\nSecurity Council, I would like to use this opportunity,\r\nwith your permission, Mr. President, to thank the\r\nPresident of the Security Council for the month of\r\nOctober, Ambassador Negroponte of the United States,\r\nfor his introduction of the report of the Security Council.\r\nI noticed many speakers in that debate referred,\r\non the one hand, to the report of the Security Council\r\nand, on the other hand, to the item now under\r\nconsideration: the question of equitable representation\r\non and increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil. In my first draft for this statement I intended\r\nto welcome a decision to convene a joint debate, as it\r\nwould be a manifestation of the streamlining of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, to which Iceland attaches\r\nimportance. I fully agree with the views expressed by\r\nthe Permanent Representative of Canada at the outset\r\nof his statement yesterday that we could have made do\r\nwith one debate on these issues.\r\nIceland’s views on the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council has been on record for years. It is\r\nessential that the composition of the Council better reflect\r\nthe membership of the United Nations as a whole.\r\nDevelopments since 1945 include the United\r\nNations membership growing from the original 51\r\nStates to 191 States, as we have often heard. The\r\ndecision in 1963 to increase the number of non-\r\npermanent seats from six to ten, which took effect in\r\n1965, was in response to demands based on the fact\r\nthat Member States had greatly increased in numbers.\r\nBy 1965 they totalled 117. Since that year, 74 new\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nStates have become members of the United Nations.\r\nThis should be reflected in the composition of the\r\nSecurity Council. We must safeguard the credibility of\r\nthe Council and at the same time secure its efficiency. We\r\nrealize that there is no easy balance between equitable\r\nrepresentation and the performance of the Council.\r\nHowever, no stone should be left unturned in our\r\nefforts to achieve that goal.\r\nThe growing practice of open Security Council\r\nmeetings is to be welcomed. I agree with the\r\nPermanent Representative of Guatemala who in last\r\nyear’s debate stated that this practice has contributed to\r\nthe closer involvement of all States in the Council’s\r\nwork by providing the opportunity to express their\r\nviews on subjects that the Council considers. Further\r\nmeasures should be taken, however, to increase\r\ntransparency in the decision-making process and thus\r\nadd to the welcome steps already taken by the Council,\r\nwithout weakening its capabilities.\r\nIceland supports an increase in both permanent and\r\nnon-permanent seats on the Council. New permanent\r\nmembers should have the same rights and obligations\r\nas the current permanent members. The veto right\r\nshould be restricted, and an obligation to state the\r\nreason for its use should be established. Such a\r\nstatement should include the reason why a permanent\r\nmember considers a matter to be of vital importance, as\r\nrequested recently by the Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Iceland Halldór Ásgrímsson in the general debate of\r\nthe General Assembly (see A/58/PV.14). Or, as my\r\ncolleague from Singapore so eloquently stated here a few\r\nminutes ago, we should attach responsibility to the veto.\r\nI suspect that my statement today will not mark a\r\nsignificant development or change in the debate on the\r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council. In truth, I\r\ndoubt, with all due respect to my colleagues, if any of\r\nthe statements in this debate will be such a landmark.\r\nThe declared aim regarding this issue is, however,\r\nclear to every delegation, since in September 2000, at\r\nthe largest-ever gathering of world leaders, they agreed\r\nto intensify efforts for a comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council in all its aspects. That agreement was\r\na landmark.\r\nThe positions of United Nations Members are\r\nmostly known. We have been working hard and long\r\nhours — 10 years as a matter of fact — in the Open-\r\nended Working Group to reach our common goal, but\r\nwith very limited results as regards the major issues:\r\nthe expansion of the Council and the question of the\r\nveto. We should not, however, underestimate the\r\ndifferences among us, although we know the reform\r\noptions have been narrowed down and are on the table.\r\nWe have the common goals of the reform,\r\ndemocratization, and strengthened legitimacy of the\r\nSecurity Council. We believe that the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group is still the most appropriate forum for\r\nnegotiation on this important issue, and we urge all\r\nMember States to show flexibility and a willingness to\r\ncompromise in order to realize the aims of our leaders,\r\nstated so clearly three years ago.\r\nLet us heed the Millennium Declaration of our\r\nleaders and the recent challenge by the Secretary-General,\r\nKofi Annan, to agree on concrete reforms by 2005.\r\nMr. Taha (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It would not\r\nbe far from the truth to say that all Member States want\r\nto see reform of the principal organs of the United\r\nNations, in particular the Security Council. Article 24\r\nof the Charter establishes the primary responsibility of\r\nthe Security Council for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security on behalf of the\r\ngeneral membership. Here, the membership is calling\r\nfor reform in the composition of the Council.\r\nMy delegation stresses the validity of paragraph\r\n13 of the report of the Secretary-General on the United\r\nNations Millennium Declaration (A/58/323), which\r\nstates that the United Nations finds itself at a critical\r\njuncture: unless the Security Council regains the\r\nconfidence of States and of world public opinion,\r\nindividual States will increasingly resort exclusively to\r\ntheir own national perceptions of emerging threats and\r\nto their own judgement on how best to address them.\r\nTo forestall such a development, the United Nations\r\nwill have to demonstrate its ability to deal with the\r\nmost difficult issues, and to do so effectively.\r\nThe principle of equitable representation is\r\nenshrined in the Charter. We must therefore be mindful\r\nof that principle when hiring or appointing individuals\r\nto posts in this Organization.\r\nThe fact that there has been a significant increase\r\nin the membership of the United Nations to 191\r\nrequires the Organization to improve its effectiveness\r\nand its readiness to adapt to the expanded membership.\r\nThat makes it particularly necessary to expand the\r\nSecurity Council and to achieve greater transparency in\r\nits working methods.\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nWe endorse the points made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his statement at the 7th meeting, on 23\r\nSeptember, with respect to establishing a panel of\r\neminent personalities to address, inter alia, the issue of\r\nreforming the Council. We agree that the Council’s\r\nability to muster the greatest possible support for its\r\nresolutions and decisions will be strengthened if the\r\nCouncil is viewed as representing the whole\r\ninternational community and the geographical and\r\npolitical realities of the contemporary world.\r\nThe use of the veto — itself the outgrowth of\r\ninternational circumstances differing from today’s — for\r\nvarious purposes and by a limited number of countries\r\ndoes not reflect the Charter concepts of justice and\r\nequality among nations. The use of the veto also\r\ncontradicts the principle of human rights in general. We\r\ntherefore echo those who have called for the\r\nelimination of the veto right, considering it to be a\r\nprivilege that contradicts the sacred principles enshrined\r\nin the Charter. We also call for restricting its use until we\r\nhave the political will to eliminate it entirely.\r\nLastly, we underscore the need to achieve balance\r\nin the relationship between the General Assembly, the\r\nprincipal body in our Organization, and the Security\r\nCouncil, its executive arm, in an effort to strengthen\r\ncooperation between the two. That should be done so\r\nthat they can truly reflect the will of the international\r\ncommunity and so as to put an end to issues that the\r\nCouncil failed in dealing with, and particularly to put an\r\nend to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian and Arab\r\nterritories and to resolve the whole Middle East situation.\r\nMr. Choisuren (Mongolia): Mongolia has been\r\nfollowing closely the discussions on the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations and its institutions. The Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters Related to the\r\nSecurity Council, which was established almost a\r\ndecade ago, has held extensive negotiations on the\r\nways and means to strengthen and improve the\r\neffectiveness of that unique body. Today, we are\r\naddressing one of the most important, yet difficult and\r\ncontroversial, issues dealing with the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe urgency with which we need to tackle reform\r\nissues has been made abundantly clear. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral himself has drawn our attention to that fact\r\ntime and again. He has pointed out that Member States\r\nneed to take a hard look at the existing architecture of\r\ninternational institutions and the perceived lack of\r\nlegitimacy of the Security Council’s decisions due to\r\nthe fact that its composition has remained unchanged\r\nsince 1945. My delegation, like many others, is in full\r\nagreement with that appraisal. In fact, during the\r\ngeneral debate at this session of the General Assembly,\r\nmany heads of delegation expressed at the highest level\r\ntheir willingness to speed up the reform process and to\r\nmake their contributions to that end. My delegation\r\nalso shares the concern over the slow pace of the\r\nreform process of the United Nations. It is evident that\r\ninnovative approaches and firm political will to change\r\nthe present situation are the prerequisites for a\r\nsuccessful reform.\r\nMy delegation believes that there are several\r\nfundamental factors pointing to the need for such\r\nreforms. Today’s world is completely different than it\r\nwas over 50 years ago, when the system of collective\r\nsecurity was defined. During that half-century, we have\r\nwitnessed such great historic events as the demise of\r\nthe colonial system, the collapse of the communist\r\ndictatorial system, the end of the cold war era and the\r\nemergence of a great number of independent States. We\r\nare now witnessing the great advance of democratization\r\nand globalization. A universal Organization such as the\r\nUnited Nations and a powerful body such as the\r\nSecurity Council, which is responsible for maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security, should certainly not\r\nlag behind in such historical changes.\r\nMongolia wants to see the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil take place along the lines of democratization.\r\nIn that context, we have consistently supported a just\r\nand equitable enlargement of the Security Council by\r\nincreasing the number of permanent and non-permanent\r\nseats and by ensuring equal representation for both\r\ndeveloping and developed countries. The questions of\r\nincreasing the effectiveness and democratization of the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council and\r\nreviewing the power of the veto should constitute the\r\nessential elements of the reform. My delegation\r\nbelieves that further enhancing openness and\r\ntransparency and equitably enlarging the composition\r\nof the Council would make the Security Council a\r\nmore democratic and representative body.\r\nAt the same time, we are keenly aware of — and\r\nindeed share — the concern of other delegations that\r\nexpanding the membership of the Security Council\r\nalone will not necessarily mean increasing its\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\neffectiveness. Another track of Security Council reform\r\ncould therefore be aimed at the goal of increasing its\r\neffectiveness. In that respect, we attach importance to\r\nfurther democratizing its working methods and\r\ndecision-making practices. In that regard, the issue of\r\nthe power of the veto has always been raised, including\r\nthe issue of whether the veto should be retained or\r\nrestricted and the question of when and under what\r\ncircumstances it should be used. Clearly, that is one the\r\nmost important components of the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, and we cannot just shy away from it.\r\nLooking back at our recent experience, the\r\ncontentious issues that have prevented the members of\r\nthe Security Council from reaching common positions\r\nand taking collective action were the differing\r\nperceptions regarding the level of threat posed to\r\nregional or international security, the extent to which\r\npeace had been breached and the course of action to be\r\ntaken in that regard. In my view, therefore, developing\r\nand refining a checklist of criteria by which to measure\r\nthe level and seriousness of a threat is one of the\r\nimportant tasks facing the United Nations. The\r\nrecommendations of the high-level panel of eminent\r\npersons to be established by the Secretary-General will be\r\nhighly welcome in that respect. The Security Council\r\ncould determine an adequate and timely response to an\r\nemerging threat on the basis of such criteria.\r\nOur determination to carry out the reform of the\r\ninstitutions of the United Nations is motivated by our\r\ngenuine desire to strengthen multilateralism and the\r\ncentral role of the United Nations in international\r\naffairs and to bolster the capacity of the Organization\r\nto respond to new challenges. My delegation hopes that\r\nthe ideas put forward by different delegations during\r\nthis session and the findings and recommendations of\r\nthe high-level panel of eminent persons will enable us\r\nto reach a satisfactory solution to these extremely\r\nimportant issues.\r\nMr. Pfanzelter (Austria): My delegation is very\r\ngrateful to you, Mr. President, for giving me the floor,\r\nbut even more so for your strong leadership in the\r\nreform process of the United Nations. Austria fully\r\nsupports your efforts to advance the reform agenda,\r\nespecially that of the General Assembly. We all agree that\r\n2003 has been a very difficult year for the Organization.\r\nThe urgent call for reform by the Secretary-General has\r\nto be taken up by all Member States.\r\nAs host to one of the headquarters of the United\r\nNations, Austria shares a strong sense of responsibility\r\nfor the effective and efficient functioning of the\r\nOrganization. We therefore welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s initiative to establish a high-level panel of\r\neminent persons to submit reform proposals in time for\r\nconsideration by the next session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration set out a vision for\r\npeace, security and sustainable development in our\r\ncentury. We need a fair and consistent collective\r\nsecurity system, based on a common understanding of\r\nthe major threats of today’s world and what our\r\ncommon responses should be. It is of critical\r\nimportance that we put the plight of individual human\r\nbeings in the centre of our debate.\r\nAustria strongly believes that the strengthening of\r\nthe main organs of the United Nations, and in particular\r\nthe Security Council, will provide a framework for\r\nachieving the goals of the Millennium Declaration.\r\nThe Security Council is at odds with the\r\ngeopolitical reality of the twenty-first century. It\r\nneither reflects the growing number of Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, nor the regional balance. As a result,\r\nsome question the legitimacy of the Council’s decision-\r\nmaking process. Enlarging and balancing its membership,\r\nas well as increasing its transparency is essential.\r\nWe welcome the recent efforts of the Security\r\nCouncil to increase the transparency of its working\r\nmethods by conducting more open debates. But more\r\nneeds to be done. Progress in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup cannot be limited to the reform of working\r\nmethods. The deadlock in the deliberations on\r\nmembership and veto power needs to be overcome. As\r\na first step, it might help to eliminate extreme positions\r\nwhich do not enjoy wide support. This could reduce the\r\nplethora of options before us. Maintaining efficiency,\r\nas well as the greatest degree of transparency and\r\nlegitimacy, must remain equally important goals that\r\nshould be guiding our reform efforts.\r\nThe reform debate of the Security Council has\r\nlasted more than ten years without producing tangible\r\nresults. Progress can only be achieved if the underlying\r\npolitical impasse is overcome by a reconsideration of\r\npositions in the major capitals of the world. All sides\r\nmust be prepared to compromise.\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.31\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: In the morning of Thursday, 16\r\nOctober 2003, the General Assembly will take up, as\r\nthe first item, agenda item 124, entitled “Scale of\r\nassessments for the apportionment of the expenses of\r\nthe United Nations”, to consider a report of the Fifth\r\nCommittee to be issued as document A/58/432. The\r\nGeneral Assembly will then continue its consideration\r\nof agenda item 39, entitled “New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development: progress in implementation and\r\ninternational support”, as well as sub-items (a) and (b).\r\nOnce the debate on agenda item 39 is concluded, the\r\nGeneral Assembly will resume its consideration of\r\nagenda item 56, entitled “Question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council and related matters”. Once the\r\ndebate on agenda item 56 is concluded, the General\r\nAssembly will resume its consideration of agenda item\r\n11, entitled “Report of the Security Council”, in order\r\nto hear my assessment of the debate on that item and to\r\ntake note of the report of the Security Council, on the\r\nunderstanding that that item will remain open for\r\nconsideration during the fifty-eighth session.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
