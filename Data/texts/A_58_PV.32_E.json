(Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 39\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress\r\nin implementation and international support\r\n(a) New Partnership for Africa’s Development:\r\nprogress in implementation and international\r\nsupport\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/254)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General on proposed\r\nrevisions to programme 8 of the medium-term\r\nplan for the period 2002-2005: United Nations\r\nsupport for the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (A/58/83)\r\nReport of the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination (A/58/16, chapter III, section B,\r\nprogramme 8; chapter IV, section B)\r\n(b) Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/352)\r\nThe President: As members are aware, this is the\r\nfirst time the Assembly is considering this new item,\r\nwhich consolidates items that in the past had been\r\ndiscussed separately in plenary meeting in the General\r\nAssembly. The purpose of this consolidation is to allow\r\nfor a comprehensive, yet focused, approach to the\r\ndebate on this most important issue.\r\nIn view of the wide interest in this critical topic, I\r\nam also pleased that we are having this debate early in\r\nthe session.\r\nWith regard to sub-item (a) of agenda item 39,\r\nmembers will recall that at its 2nd plenary meeting, on\r\n19 September 2003, the General Assembly decided\r\nthat, as part of its consideration of this agenda item, the\r\nAssembly would review the recommendations by the\r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination contained\r\nin document A/58/16, specifically in chapter III,\r\nsection B, programme 8, and in chapter IV, section B of\r\nthat document, as well as document A/58/83, which\r\npertain to United Nations support for the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development.\r\nThe Assembly decided that all relevant comments\r\nregarding these recommendations would be transmitted\r\nto the Fifth Committee prior to the Committee’s\r\nconsideration of the proposed medium-term plan and\r\nits revisions, and of the recommendations contained in\r\nthe section entitled “Evaluation” of the report of the\r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination.\r\nBefore giving the floor to the first speaker on my\r\nlist, I should like to inform members that, in a letter\r\ndated 10 October 2003 addressed to the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Permanent Representative of\r\nSpain to the United Nations, in his capacity as Chairman\r\nof the Group of Western European and Other States for\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nthe month of October, requests that the General\r\nAssembly hear in plenary meeting statements by the\r\nObserver of the Holy See in the debates on agenda item\r\n39, entitled “New Partnership for Africa’s Development:\r\nprogress in implementation and international support”;\r\nagenda item 40, entitled “Strengthening of the\r\ncoordination of humanitarian and disaster relief assistance\r\nof the United Nations, including special economic\r\nassistance”; agenda item 44, entitled “Culture of peace”;\r\nand agenda item 48, entitled “Fifty-fifth anniversary of\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights”.\r\nMay I take it that there is no objection to the\r\nproposal to hear statements by the Observer of the Holy\r\nSee in the debates on agenda items 39, 40, 44 and 48?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Leonardo Santos Simão, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Cooperation of the Republic of\r\nMozambique, speaking on behalf of the African Union.\r\nMr. Simão (Mozambique): Mr. President, on behalf\r\nof my delegation, I am pleased once again to congratulate\r\nyou upon your election as President of the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. Under your able\r\nleadership, the General Assembly is making significant\r\nprogress in tackling the various items in its agenda, and\r\nI am sure of a successful outcome of our work. You can\r\ntherefore rest assured of our continued support and\r\ncooperation as you lead us over the next few months.\r\nToday’s debate is crucial to the future of Africa.\r\nBoth the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) and the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General’s report on the\r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa remain at the top of\r\nour agenda, both in Africa and at the international\r\nlevel. I am pleased that at long last we have all agreed\r\non the need to address these issues together, as both\r\ndevelopment and conflict issues are two faces of the\r\nsame coin, insofar as Africa is concerned.\r\nToday, the African peoples are firmly engaged in\r\nmaking Africa a continent of hope. We are striving to\r\nachieve peace, stability and socio-economic\r\ndevelopment, while seeking to build strong foundations\r\nfor democracy and good governance and to create\r\nbetter living conditions for our peoples.\r\nIn order to address these challenges, Africa has\r\neffectively seized control of her destiny and presented\r\na visionary course of action, embodied in the creation of\r\nthe African Union, as a means to provide the necessary\r\ninstitutional framework and political leadership.\r\nNEPAD is an initiative that is led, owned and\r\nmanaged by the African Union. It constitutes a serious\r\ncommitment to addressing the aspirations of the\r\ncontinent and its peoples. NEPAD, as our\r\ncomprehensive development strategy, is key for the\r\nimplementation of our vision for a better Africa.\r\nAfter many years of efforts devoted to political\r\nemancipation, we have now embarked on a two-fold\r\nstrategy. On the one hand, we are determined to ensure\r\nthat conflicts, which have been ravaging our continent,\r\ncan soon be an issue of the past. On the other hand, we\r\nare committed to ensuring that Africa takes its rightful\r\nplace in the community of nations by embarking on a\r\nsteady pattern of sustainable development, through the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD.\r\nIt was with this ultimate goal in mind that the\r\nAfrican Union met in Maputo to discuss the future of\r\nAfrica and agree on important decisions that will lay\r\nthe foundations of the African Union and contribute to\r\nan effective implementation of NEPAD. We therefore\r\nview this meeting of the General Assembly as an\r\nexcellent opportunity to take stock of our common\r\nresolve to make NEPAD a tangible reality with benefits\r\nfor Africa and, indeed, for the world at large.\r\nWe in Africa believe that, with the successful\r\nimplementation of NEPAD, our continent will cease to\r\nbe a burden and a permanent source of concern for the\r\ninternational community — due to violent conflicts,\r\nendemic diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and\r\ntuberculosis, famine and the negative impact of natural\r\ndisasters — and become an effective partner in the\r\ninternational arena.\r\nOne of the main pillars of NEPAD is the\r\nachievement and maintenance of peace, stability and\r\nsecurity, widely regarded as prerequisites for an\r\nAfrican renaissance and development. To this end, we\r\nare creating three fundamental institutions, in addition\r\nto the Commission of the African Union, in order for\r\nthis vision to flourish.\r\nThe first one is the Peace and Security Council,\r\nan organ of the African Union for conflict prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution. The second is the Pan-\r\nAfrican Parliament, a tool to ensure the full participation\r\nof the African peoples in the development and\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\neconomic integration of the continent. The third is the\r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Council, an advisory\r\nbody composed of various social and professional\r\ngroups of member States of the African Union, to\r\nensure an effective participation of African civil\r\nsociety in the affairs of the Union.\r\nOur efforts today are geared towards putting these\r\nthree fundamental institutions in place, as soon as\r\npossible, to pave the way for NEPAD implementation.\r\nThe establishment of the short-term Action Plan,\r\ncontaining high priority projects in the areas of energy,\r\ntransport, water and sanitation, information technology\r\nand health and education, is an important step forward.\r\nWe are also making progress in producing the medium-\r\nto long-term Infrastructure Action Plan.\r\nFurthermore, a Comprehensive African Agricultural\r\nDevelopment Plan was jointly developed with the Food\r\nand Agriculture Organization, with the objective of\r\naddressing the current food crisis in Africa and laying\r\nthe groundwork for the agricultural development of the\r\ncontinent.\r\nSince the signing of the Constitutive Act of the\r\nAfrican Union two years ago, we have placed emphasis\r\non creating the institutional framework for overseeing\r\nthe implementation of NEPAD at the regional level,\r\nintegrating NEPAD priorities into our national\r\ndevelopment programmes and creating institutions to\r\nmanage it, as a means of bringing about coherence in\r\nNEPAD matters within our own Governments.\r\nAt the same time, the African Peer Review\r\nMechanism is taking shape, with an increasing number\r\nof member States of the African Union acceding to it.\r\nThe operational structure of the Mechanism has been\r\nestablished, including the panel of eminent persons,\r\nand soon we will have an evaluation of the first two\r\ncountries that are volunteering to be reviewed under\r\nthis Mechanism.\r\nIn promoting NEPAD, we should be careful not to\r\nproject it as something to come in the future. NEPAD,\r\nyes, is still in its infancy, but it is a sound and visible\r\nreality in Africa today. For example, the ongoing\r\nregional projects and many others still in the pipeline\r\nillustrate NEPAD in action. Similarly, the ongoing\r\nrenewed efforts for conflict prevention, resolution and\r\nmanagement are clear examples of NEPAD in action.\r\nTo this end, our feeling is that these efforts are\r\nhaving positive results in the overall area of conflicts.\r\nIn fact, there are no new conflicts on our continent, and\r\neven those that now exist are a combination of either\r\nold conflicts which have not been resolved properly or\r\nseemingly new ones that can be traced back to the old\r\nones. Overall, the balance in settling conflicts is\r\npositive, as illustrated by many positive examples\r\nunderway in Africa, including Angola, Sierra Leone,\r\nthe Comoros, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nLiberia and Burundi, all of which are on a steady path\r\nto full stability.\r\nAs for Burundi, President Chissano of\r\nMozambique, in his address to the General Assembly\r\nlast month, appealed to the Security Council to adopt a\r\nresolution formally endorsing the African Mission in\r\nBurundi and to take the necessary measures to provide\r\npolitical, financial and logistical support to this\r\noperation. The recent signing of an agreement in\r\nPretoria between the Government of Burundi and the\r\nCNDD-FDD has more than vindicated the President’s\r\nappeal for action by the Council.\r\nThese important developments clearly show that\r\nAfrica is on the right track towards creating the necessary\r\nconditions for the successful implementation of NEPAD.\r\nDespite the ownership and leadership of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and\r\ndespite the ongoing African initiatives for conflict\r\nprevention, management and resolution, the role of the\r\ninternational community is critical to a successful\r\noutcome of the two issues.\r\nWe encourage the United Nations to continue to\r\nconcentrate its efforts in support of NEPAD. The\r\nOffice of the Special Adviser on Africa should be\r\ngiven the necessary support, in order to enable it to\r\nundertake its responsibilities.\r\nWe also encourage our development partners to\r\nlive up to their commitments to Africa and to continue\r\nto assist NEPAD in its actions. For NEPAD to be\r\nsuccessful it is essential that these partners support us\r\nin a coherent, predictable and sustainable manner,\r\nindividually or within financial and trade institutions.\r\nWe in Africa will continue to shoulder our\r\nresponsibilities, ensuring that our resolve and\r\nleadership to create a better future for the continent\r\nremain unabated.\r\nMr. Spatafora (Italy): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the European Union. The acceding countries\r\nCyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia,\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nLithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, and the\r\nassociated countries Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey,\r\nalign themselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union sees today’s debate as a\r\ngreat opportunity to focus the attention of the fifty-\r\neighth General Assembly on African issues. We wish to\r\ntake this opportunity to reiterate our commitment to the\r\nsocial and economic development of Africa, which\r\nremains, to use the words of the European Union\r\nCouncil of Ministers, our “privileged partner”.\r\nAs we are all aware, peace and development are\r\nclosely related, especially in the case of Africa. We\r\nwelcome this year’s new approach of addressing both\r\nissues under a single agenda item centred on the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), which\r\nhas been adopted by African Heads of State as the\r\ndevelopment programme of the African Union. We also\r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s reports prepared\r\nunder the supervision of the Office of the Special Adviser\r\non Africa, whose conclusions and recommendations we\r\nfully share and whose implementation we are ready to\r\nsupport. In particular, we commend the quality of the\r\nNEPAD report, outlining the challenges and constraints\r\nfacing the African countries, the international\r\ncommunity and the United Nations system.\r\nThe European Union has supported the NEPAD\r\ninitiative from the beginning. We share the vision on\r\nwhich it is grounded, according to which Africa’s\r\ndevelopment — considered as vital to Africans as to the\r\nentire world — must be framed in a partnership between\r\nthe more developed countries and the African countries,\r\nwhere the latter have the primary responsibility in\r\nestablishing the conditions for sustainable economic and\r\nsocial development and attracting private investments.\r\nThose conditions include improving governance,\r\nfighting corruption and enhancing transparency and the\r\nrule of law. NEPAD also rightly emphasizes the private\r\nsector’s role in Africa as a means to help fully integrate\r\nthe continent into the process of economic globalization.\r\nI wish to reiterate the European Union’s full\r\nsupport for the basic principles and political priorities\r\naddressed by NEPAD, which coincide with the values\r\nand objectives of the European Union external relations\r\npolicy. The sectoral and thematic priorities of NEPAD\r\nare the same as those defined in the 2000 Cairo Plan of\r\nAction, adopted within the Europe-Africa dialogue. We\r\nbelieve that the African Union decision on the\r\nintegration of NEPAD into the African Union will\r\nallow us to reinforce our dialogue with Africa on a\r\nbroad scope of issues. We look forward to further\r\ndeepening this dialogue at the first meeting of the\r\nForum for the Partnership with Africa, organized by\r\nFrance and scheduled for 10 November 2003.\r\nIn this regard, we applaud the progress made by\r\nAfrican countries in implementing NEPAD, particularly\r\nthe establishment of the African Peer Review Mechanism.\r\nWe hope that other African countries will join the 16\r\nStates that have acceded to it as of today, and we\r\nencourage them to start applying the Mechanism, as\r\nplanned, by the end of the year. Drawing on the\r\nrecommendations contained in the Secretary General’s\r\nreport, further efforts are also needed to integrate\r\nNEPAD goals and priorities into national, subregional\r\nand continental development plans; foster cooperation\r\nbetween the NEPAD Implementation Committee and\r\nthe regional economic communities; generate popular\r\nsupport for NEPAD among the African people and\r\nmobilize domestic resources. In this context, the\r\nEuropean Union would also like to underline the\r\nimportance of a gender perspective.\r\nThe resolve of the African countries will have to\r\nbe matched by the commitment of the more developed\r\ncountries to support Africa — in a spirit of genuine\r\npartnership — by substantially enhancing the flow of\r\nresources and their effectiveness to the continent.\r\nI would like to recall the collective European\r\nUnion financial commitment, which was defined at the\r\nEuropean Union Summit in Barcelona in March 2002,\r\nin the context of the preparations for the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development at\r\nMonterrey, namely, to bring official development aid to\r\n0.39 per cent of gross national income by 2006, as a\r\nfirst significant step towards the United Nations goal of\r\n0.7 per cent. The European Union and its member\r\nStates are respecting this schedule and are already\r\nproviding almost half of all current development\r\nassistance to Africa.\r\nThe European Union and its member States have\r\nbeen at the forefront of the international community’s\r\ncooperation with Africa in many areas. Given the\r\nestablishment of NEPAD and the developments that have\r\noccurred within the African Union, the European Union\r\nnow faces a new challenge: how to best integrate the pan-\r\nAfrican dimension into its cooperation programmes.\r\nThe full version of my statement, which has been\r\ndistributed, provides more information on some of the\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nconcrete actions undertaken by the European Union in\r\nthe key areas of health, debt and trade.\r\nRegarding trade, the European Union recognizes the\r\nimportance of cotton for the development of a number of\r\nAfrican countries and understands the need for urgent\r\naction to address trade distortion in this market.\r\nIn response to the cotton initiative in the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO), the European Commission\r\nof the European Union has proposed a constructive\r\nsolution to address trade aspects linked to the\r\ndepressed prices of cotton in the world market. It had\r\nbeen proposed to bind that solution in the WTO, but\r\nthis has been postponed until a round is successfully\r\nconcluded.\r\nThe European Union expresses its deep regret\r\nover the failure of the Cancún Conference. We remain\r\nconvinced that a growing liberalization of world trade,\r\ntogether with development cooperation activities, can\r\nplay a crucial role in achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. This is why the European Union\r\nfeels that it is important to continue negotiations in the\r\nWTO framework as soon as all the parties are ready to\r\nparticipate again. All parties should demonstrate the\r\ndetermination and flexibility needed to honour the\r\ncommitments enshrined in the Doha Development\r\nAgenda.\r\nToday’s meeting is also devoted to the promotion\r\nof lasting peace in Africa. Indeed, this is the first goal of\r\nthe NEPAD Initiative, which rightly links development\r\nand stability. Our main focus must be on the prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts in Africa.\r\nAccording to the established position of the European\r\nUnion, our contribution to conflict prevention and\r\nmanagement is to be made through the strengthening of\r\nAfrican capacities, including support for regional and\r\nsubregional organizations and civil society.\r\nThere have been important developments in this\r\narea. At its Durban Summit in July 2002, the African\r\nUnion endorsed the Protocol for the establishment of\r\nthe African Union Peace and Security Council, which\r\nwill be the ruling organ of an African peace and\r\nsecurity mechanism, including an African stand-by\r\nforce. We hope that the number of ratifications required\r\nfor the Protocol to enter into force can soon be reached.\r\nIn the meantime, at the African Union Summit in\r\nMaputo last July, the European Commission made an\r\ninnovative proposal: to establish an African peace\r\nsupport operation facility in support of African peace\r\noperations, including the soon-to-be-launched African\r\nUnion peace and security mechanism. This proposal is\r\ncurrently being developed in Brussels. It recognizes\r\nthat there is no development without peace and aims to\r\nenlarge the range of aid intervention to include support\r\nfor African-run peacekeeping operations.\r\nWe expect other donors to contribute to the\r\nestablishment of the African peace and security\r\nmechanism, following the adoption at the Group of Eight\r\nSummit in Evian of a joint plan for strengthening African\r\ncapacities to undertake peace support operations. This\r\nplan sets forth the ambitious goal of helping African\r\ncountries to create, by 2010, a stand-by peace force\r\ncapable of conducting peacekeeping operations and\r\nconsistent with the African ownership of peace and\r\nsecurity issues.\r\nThe creation of an African stand-by force will\r\ndeter conflicts on the continent and supplement strong\r\nand effective cooperation between the United Nations,\r\nthe European Union and the African Union. This\r\ntrilateral cooperation must encompass both conflict\r\nprevention and aid. This was one of the main\r\nconclusions of the seminar that the European Union\r\npresidency organized in Rome, on 28 and 29 July, on\r\nconflict prevention, management and resolution in\r\nAfrica, which was attended by the Secretary-General’s\r\nSpecial Adviser on Africa, Professor Gambari, among\r\nothers, and also by qualified representatives of African\r\ncivil society, who, we believe, play a crucial role.\r\nThe lessons learned from past experience prove\r\nthat when the European Union, the United Nations and\r\nAfrican countries act in a coherent and consistent\r\nmanner, they can make a significant impact on peace,\r\ndevelopment and security. The most recent example\r\nwas the European Union-led Operation Artemis in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. The European\r\nUnion-United Nations cooperation agreement on crisis\r\nmanagement, signed in New York two weeks ago, will\r\ncreate further opportunities to demonstrate the\r\nEuropean Union’s commitment.\r\nThe European Union has much to offer Africa in\r\nterms of building capacity in conflict prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution, including peacekeeping\r\nand cross-cutting issues such as control of small arms\r\nand light weapons. While financial resources form the\r\ncentral pillar, there is also an important technical\r\ncapacity-building and skills transfer that the European\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nUnion can offer. We intend to foster discussion with\r\nour African partners on this sensitive issue within the\r\nframework of the ongoing Europe-Africa dialogue\r\nestablished at the Cairo Summit in April 2000. As was\r\nconfirmed at the Ouagadougou ministerial conference\r\nin November last year, Europe wishes to make the\r\nstrategic framework provided by the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and the African\r\nUnion, the heart of its political dialogue with Africa.\r\nEnsuring Africa’s inclusion in world advancement\r\nis a European Union priority. We are confident that this\r\nchallenge can be achieved through continuing progress\r\nin the implementation of NEPAD and increasing\r\nsupport from the international community. While the\r\nEuropean Union will pursue this objective in the\r\nframework of its ongoing dialogue with Africa, we also\r\nexpect the United Nations to play an important role in\r\nfostering the partnership between the developed world\r\nand the African continent. I wish to pledge the European\r\nUnion’s full support for initiatives undertaken in this\r\nrespect, and I wish the Special Adviser for Africa,\r\nProfessor Gambari, every success in his important role.\r\nMr. Løvald (Norway): Norway has a strong\r\ncommitment to Africa. We feel that there are many\r\npositive signs coming from the continent. We will\r\ncontinue our partnership with many African States and\r\nwe will engage even deeper with African regional and\r\nsubregional organizations.\r\nNorway recognizes the important steps that are\r\ncurrently being taken by leaders on the African\r\ncontinent. With the development of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and\r\nthe new African Union, African leaders themselves are\r\nclearly taking charge of development on the continent.\r\nNEPAD is an initiative that is led, owned and managed\r\nby the African Union. I reaffirm Norway’s support to\r\nthe principles and political priorities in the NEPAD\r\nplan of action. We are encouraged by the progress\r\nmade in establishing the African Peer Review\r\nMechanism, and look forward to its implementation.\r\nNorway commends the new Office of the Special\r\nAdviser for Africa for its efforts in putting together the\r\nSecretary-General’s first consolidated report as regards\r\nNEPAD. In general, Norway supports the conclusions\r\nand recommendations of the report. We also welcome\r\nthe progress report of the Secretary-General on the\r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa. We generally\r\nsupport the approach of the report and its\r\nrecommendations.\r\nNorway shares the basic view that conflict\r\nprevention, including early warning and preventive\r\naction, need to be at the centre of any multilaterally-\r\ndriven peace-building process. Too often the legacy of\r\na conflict is yet another conflict. We have to find ways\r\nto stop this cycle. Conflict prevention and post-conflict\r\npeace-building are very much two sides of the same\r\ncoin. As the Secretary-General correctly points out in\r\nhis recent report on the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, we have to have a strategy\r\nthat embraces the entirety of peace and security,\r\ndevelopment, and human rights, democracy and good\r\ngovernance. We must also have multilateral institutions\r\nthat are up to the job and capable of implementing such\r\ncomprehensive strategies.\r\nFighting poverty and promoting development is\r\nthe soundest investment we can make in Africa.\r\nNEPAD is a significant step towards economic and\r\nsocial development and political stability. Norway has\r\njoined the rest of the international community in a\r\ncommitment to the Millennium Development Goals, a\r\nroad map for halving poverty by the year 2015. We have\r\npledged to reduce child mortality by two thirds. We have\r\npledged to halve the proportion of people without\r\naccess to safe drinking water and basic sanitation.\r\nTo reach the Millennium Development Goals, we\r\nneed to focus on four points. First, the international\r\ncommunity must improve the international framework\r\nconditions for trade, investment and debt. Secondly,\r\nnational Governments in poor countries must focus on\r\ngood governance and accountability. Thirdly, official\r\ndevelopment assistance must be increased and\r\nimproved. Fourthly, the private sector and civil society\r\nmust become active partners in poverty alleviation.\r\nViolent conflicts have devastating consequences\r\nnationally, regionally and internationally. Conflicts\r\ncause displacement, high mortality rates, poverty and\r\ntrauma, and divert resources away from development.\r\nInfrastructure is destroyed. Institutions are demolished.\r\nInvestments are lost. Economies weaken. Institutions\r\ndisintegrate, and, in some cases, States fail altogether.\r\nConflict has the potential to undo decades of\r\nhuman, economic and national development. In most\r\ncases, the United Nations only gets engaged in earnest\r\nafter a conflict has broken out. The reasons are many,\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nbut there is a high price to be paid in terms of loss of\r\nlives, human misery and setbacks in development.\r\nThere are many things we can do to prevent this\r\nfrom happening. We can do more to prevent economic\r\nfactors such as diamonds and other natural resources\r\nfrom fuelling and prolonging conflicts. We can also\r\ntake action to curb the illegal trade in small arms.\r\nFocusing on these two areas would enhance the effect\r\nof United Nations preventive action considerably.\r\nWithout peace and stability, our fight against\r\npoverty will fail. The Secretary-General has rightfully\r\nplaced emphasis on the responsibility of African\r\ncountries themselves for development in Africa.\r\nRegional and subregional organizations, and civil\r\nsociety, need to be involved in all stages of conflict\r\nresolution and in enhancing African capacity with\r\nregard to peacekeeping operations. In Maputo this year,\r\nwe saw the formal launching of the African Union\r\nPeace and Security Council, and we have recently seen\r\nefforts made to settle disputes and conflicts on the\r\nsubregional level that have led to positive results.\r\nThe role of the international community should\r\nprimarily be to strengthen and support efforts and\r\ninitiatives within the African countries themselves. We\r\nlook forward to furthering our cooperation with the\r\nAfrican community of States, together with the United\r\nNations, regional and subregional structures and, not\r\nleast, a vibrant civil society where gender and rights-\r\nbased approaches are of key importance.\r\nNorway, together with Italy, the United States and\r\nthe United Kingdom, supports and participates in the\r\nSudan peace talks. The talks are led by the regional\r\norganization the Intergovernmental Authority on\r\nDevelopment (IGAD) and headed by Kenya. On 25\r\nSeptember this year, the parties signed an agreement on\r\nthe principles for resolving the sensitive issues of\r\nsecurity arrangements for a peace agreement.\r\nHopefully, this will pave the way for the signing of a\r\nfull peace agreement this autumn.\r\nPeace in Sudan would end one of Africa’s longest\r\nconflicts. Two million people have been killed and\r\nmore than 4 million have become refugees or internally\r\ndisplaced over the last 20 years. A peace agreement\r\nwould be a strong signal that parties of different ethnic,\r\nreligious and cultural backgrounds can work and live\r\ntogether. It would hopefully have great impact on the\r\nstability of the region.\r\nBut Sudanese society will need to see the\r\nconcrete results of a peace agreement. This will\r\nunderline the fact that peace pays. Preparations for a\r\nbroad-based and long-term assistance effort has been\r\nunder way for some time. Norway, as co-chair of the\r\nIGAD Partners Forum, will host a donor conference as\r\nsoon as there is a peace agreement.\r\nThe absence of war does not necessarily equal\r\npeace. Getting the parties to the negotiating table is\r\nonly the first step. Then comes the harder part: the\r\nconsolidation of peace in post-conflict situations. This\r\ninvolves promoting social and economic development,\r\nas well as addressing political and security issues.\r\nHere, the international community can help build\r\nthe necessary competence, capacity, institutions and\r\nprocesses for non-violent conflict resolution. And here,\r\nthe United Nations has an indispensable role as partner\r\nin supporting NEPAD and thus, in promoting peace and\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At\r\nthe last session of the General Assembly, we witnessed\r\nthe launching of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) as an African initiative based\r\non the realities, aspirations, needs and problems of\r\nAfrica. The African countries asserted their ownership\r\nof the substance of this Partnership and committed\r\nthemselves to bringing to bear all their social, political,\r\neconomic and environmental strengths and to\r\nestablishing the necessary institutions to that end.\r\nAt the last African Summit, held in Maputo,\r\nMozambique — and here I wish to express my thanks\r\nto the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mozambique for\r\nhaving introduced this item today — NEPAD was\r\nadopted as the principal programme of the African\r\nUnion, marking a new development in terms of African\r\nownership of that initiative. This is also reflected in the\r\nefforts of the executive committee of that Partnership\r\nthroughout the last year in the various areas in which it\r\nis active.\r\nI would like to place on record our appreciation\r\nfor the growing worldwide interest in NEPAD. In this\r\nregard, however, we would say that that interest is still\r\npurely moral and political in nature.\r\nWe greatly rely on the efforts of Ambassador\r\nIbrahima Gambari and the group that he heads in the\r\nUnited Nations in terms of mobilizing more interest\r\nand international commitment in support of NEPAD\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nfrom the technical and financial standpoint. We\r\nunderscore the need to unify and coordinate the activities\r\nof the United Nations agencies and other international\r\norganizations to help to fully implement this initiative,\r\nparticularly with respect to questions relating to economic\r\nand social development. The activities should reflect the\r\ncommitment of the international community to work for\r\nfull implementation and achievement of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals in a manner consonant with current\r\nefforts to promote international peace and security.\r\nFor us, NEPAD is a framework for a necessary\r\npartnership embodying the principle of reciprocal\r\nresponsibility and commitment between Africa and the\r\nrest of the world. We aspire to a serious partnership\r\nthat will recognize the particular characteristics and\r\ncapabilities of Africa, that stems from a joint resolve to\r\neradicate the causes of conflict, violence and economic\r\nmarginalization and that lays the foundation for respect\r\nfor the decisions taken by the peoples of the continent\r\nin terms of their development priorities and\r\nprogrammes to improve life there.\r\nThe United Nations contributions to peacekeeping\r\nand peace-building in Africa are increasingly important,\r\nparticularly as regards the provision and mobilization\r\nof technical and financial support required for African\r\ninstitution-building and strengthening in that regard.\r\nThe efforts on the continent to establish machinery to\r\nprevent and manage conflict in the context of the\r\nAfrican Union, in particular the idea of establishing a\r\nPeace and Security Council require joint study by the\r\nUnited Nations and the African Union of the needs and\r\nrequirements involved in those endeavours, while\r\nidentifying areas in which the United Nations can\r\nprovide assistance and possible sources of finance for\r\nthose mechanisms.\r\nIn this regard, we would highlight the continent’s\r\npriorities, especially with respect to combating the\r\nproliferation and smuggling of small arms and light\r\nweapons and strengthening cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and Africa and subregional organizations\r\nin such vital areas as peacekeeping operations. Here,\r\nwe stress disarmament and demobilization of ex-\r\ncombatants and their reintegration into civilian life, the\r\nprotection of civilians and all matters relating to the\r\npresent and future conditions of refugees and displaced\r\npersons from a regional perspective.\r\nIn that context, I wish once again to stress that\r\nour work to end conflicts in Africa should not be\r\nlimited to achieving or monitoring a ceasefire. Nor will\r\nthey end by returning combatants to their barracks,\r\nprotecting facilities or facilitating meetings of provisional\r\nor transitional governments. The real challenge lies in\r\nmanaging post-conflict situations that require a set of\r\nintertwined programmes for reconciliation and political,\r\neconomic, social and administrative development.\r\nThe Government of Egypt takes note of what is\r\nstated in the Secretary-General’s report on progress in\r\nthe implementation of his recommendations on the\r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa. The report\r\nattests to the various initiatives and programmes that\r\nthe United Nations system is carrying out in African\r\ncountries in post-conflict situations. We note that the\r\nSecretary-General has referred in his report to the\r\nimportant element of comprehensive and permanent\r\npeace-building. However, in that regard, I wish to note\r\nthat progress in comprehensive and permanent peace-\r\nbuilding depends on the continuous commitment of the\r\ninternational community to African countries emerging\r\nfrom conflict, through the provision of the financial\r\nresources necessary to continue to build upon the progress\r\nalready made in the political and security areas.\r\nIn that regard, we stress the need to develop\r\ncoordination mechanisms among United Nations\r\norgans and programmes for resolving and managing\r\nconflicts and for the building and maintaining of peace\r\nin Africa, including the international financial\r\ninstitutions, so that we can define the role and the\r\nactivities of each programme and organ at every stage\r\nof conflict management. We must also prepare\r\nconsistent and coherent plans and programmes that\r\nreflect the true nature and special needs of societies\r\nconcerned, while avoiding overlapping activities and\r\nsetting aside the least effective ones.\r\nThat way it will be possible to maximize the use of\r\navailable human and material resources. Accordingly, the\r\nEgyptian delegation takes the view that the organs and\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations system should develop\r\nchannels for daily communication and interaction with\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental structures and\r\nwith national institutions in the countries concerned, as\r\nwell as with the African Union and with relevant\r\nsubregional organizations, to ensure ongoing\r\ncoordination and dovetailing of joint activities.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): There is\r\nno doubt that, without peace there can be no\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\ndevelopment. In many African countries facing conflict,\r\ndevelopment efforts — even when still possible — have\r\ninevitably been eroded. Notwithstanding the important\r\nprogress that has been made in peace-building and\r\ndevelopment in recent years, thanks to the efforts of the\r\nAfrican countries themselves and to the support of the\r\ninternational community, conflicts persist and continue\r\nto affect many countries and regions beset also by\r\ndisease and poverty.\r\nThe comprehensive reports of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral eloquently highlight the scope of the\r\ndifficulties and the problems that impede Africa’s\r\ndevelopment. The clarity with which they describe\r\nefforts by African countries and the support of the\r\ninternational community and the United Nations\r\nsystem facilitates understanding of the gravity of the\r\nsituation in Africa and the continent’s main concerns.\r\nJoint consideration of the items entitled “The\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress in\r\nimplementation and international support” and the sub-\r\nitem entitled “Causes of conflict and the promotion of\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa”,\r\nwhich in many cases are interdependent, seems\r\nappropriate because it makes it possible to deal with\r\nboth of them in a coordinated and integrated manner.\r\nHowever, given the specific nature of each of those\r\nitems, my delegation believes that separate reports on\r\nthem should continue to be issued.\r\nOn the question of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, my delegation welcomes the ongoing\r\nattention paid by the Secretary-General to the sensitive\r\nquestion of conflict resolution and the maintenance of\r\npeace in Africa, as well as his support for African\r\ninitiatives in resolving conflicts.\r\nThe efforts made since June 2002 in the Central\r\nAfrican Republic, in Angola and, recently, in Liberia,\r\nfor which the Secretary-General has just appointed a\r\nSpecial Representative, are significant and should be\r\nintensified. The establishment by the Economic and\r\nSocial Council of Ad Hoc Advisory Groups for\r\nGuinea-Bissau and Burundi is also commendable, as\r\nthey are aimed at coordinating the support of the\r\ninternational community and of the United Nations\r\nsystem for the transition from the post-conflict phase to\r\nthat of recovery and reconstruction in those countries,\r\nwhich are emerging from conflict.\r\nIt is clear that cooperation and coordination\r\namong the Ad Hoc Working Group of the Security\r\nCouncil on Conflict Prevention and Resolution in\r\nAfrica, the Economic and Social Council’s Ad Hoc\r\nAdvisory Group on African Countries Emerging from\r\nConflict and the competent mechanisms of the African\r\nUnion should be further strengthened so that initiatives\r\nfor peace and development in Africa can become part\r\nof a comprehensive, integrated and coordinated\r\napproach. The political will and determination of\r\nAfrican countries to achieve lasting settlements of the\r\nmany conflicts that continue to ravage the continent\r\ndepend, however, on the existence of adequate African\r\ncapacities. We believe that these are two basic\r\nconditions for the creation of such capacities.\r\nFirst, the resources needed for these capacities\r\nmust not be diverted from the development effort.\r\nSecondly, large-scale support and encouragement for\r\nAfrican peace and security initiatives should not\r\nultimately lead to the international community’s\r\nabandoning conflict prevention, management and\r\nresolution in Africa, or particularly to the disengagement\r\nof the United Nations and its Security Council, which,\r\nunder the Charter, bears primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nA year ago the Assembly adopted two important\r\nresolutions on Africa: resolution 57/2, entitled “United\r\nNations Declaration on the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development”, which welcomed NEPAD and\r\nconfirmed that international support for the New\r\nPartnership was essential; and resolution 57/7, which\r\nterminated the United Nations New Agenda for Africa\r\nin the 1990s and made NEPAD a reference framework\r\nfor support for Africa by the United Nations system\r\nand the international community. Twelve months later,\r\nwe now have our first opportunity together to assess\r\nthe progress made in the implementation of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), and\r\nthe international community’s support for NEPAD. It is\r\nextremely encouraging to observe that the African\r\ncountries are resolutely committed to attaining the\r\ngoals that have been set and have taken promising steps\r\nin that direction.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the subject\r\n(A/58/254) — and we welcome its comprehensive\r\napproach and simplicity of format, which were intended\r\nto make it easier to follow up support for NEPAD —\r\nsets out in a precise manner the obstacles encountered\r\non the ground. It is clear that the lack of financial\r\nresources and the persistence of conflicts and endemic\r\ndiseases that continue to decimate the human resources\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nof the continent are major obstacles that weaken the\r\ncapacity and development efforts of the African\r\ncountries. In shouldering their responsibility, first and\r\nforemost to provide for their own development, the\r\nAfrican countries have made enormous national\r\nsacrifices at the political, economic and social levels to\r\nmeet all of the conditions to make this new African\r\npartnership a success.\r\nWe welcome the progress made in priority areas\r\nsuch as governance, peace and security, national\r\ncoordination, agriculture, health, education, environment,\r\ntourism, infrastructure and industrialization. Certainly,\r\nmore efforts need to be made to strengthen the resolve\r\nof African countries to move ahead with their\r\nimplementation of NEPAD.\r\nThe recent establishment of new African Union\r\ninstitutions adapted to current conditions stems\r\nnaturally from the common will and commitment, now\r\nirreversible, to use all the machinery that can help\r\nattain the goals of NEPAD, with a view to lifting the\r\ncontinent out of underdevelopment and providing\r\nbetter conditions for its active integration into the\r\nworld economy.\r\nWe welcome the partnership established between\r\nNEPAD and the Group of Eight (G-8), as well as the\r\ncommitments of the G-8 to support Africa’s efforts. We\r\nalso welcome the many support initiatives of certain\r\ndeveloped countries for Africa. Whether multilateral or\r\nbilateral, such initiatives should be encouraged.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General rightly\r\nstresses the particular importance of the contribution of\r\nthe international community, while noting that efforts\r\nstill need to be made in the areas of official\r\ndevelopment assistance, providing relief for the serious\r\nexternal debt burden, liberalization of international\r\ntrade and encouraging private investment flows\r\ntowards Africa.\r\nIn his report on implementation of the United\r\nNations Millennium Declaration (A/58/323), the\r\nSecretary-General clearly notes that the success or\r\nfailure of the Millennium Development Goals depends\r\non whether the developed countries live up to their\r\ncommitments in those areas. That shows how closely\r\nthe fate of NEPAD remains tied to the establishment of\r\nan enabling international environment which will, to a\r\nlarge extent, determine the attainment of goal 8 of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, concerning the\r\nestablishment of a global partnership for development\r\nand in particular, its benchmarks relating to debt,\r\nofficial development assistance and the establishment\r\nof an open multilateral financial and trading system.\r\nMy delegation is convinced that an active, consistent\r\nresponse to these decisive questions of development\r\nfinancing requires a comprehensive and integrated\r\napproach.\r\nThe United Nations system must play a major\r\nrole in helping to support Africa’s efforts. Operational\r\nactivities are of great importance here, but they must be\r\ncarried out with strict universality, objectivity and\r\nneutrality and be free of any temptation to interfere in\r\nthe internal affairs of recipient countries.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to stress the importance of\r\nthe creation of the Office of the Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral and Special Adviser on Africa. The creation of\r\nthat Office is an expression of the United Nations\r\ncommitment to provide regular follow-up to international\r\nsupport for NEPAD. That Office is of crucial\r\nimportance for Africa and for following up the\r\nimplementation of the New Partnership, and it needs to\r\nbe provided with sufficient human and financial\r\nresources to enable it to succeed.\r\nMr. Natama (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French):\r\nAllow me first of all, Mr. President, to pay tribute to\r\nyou for the way in which you and the other members of\r\nthe Bureau are directing the work of this session. My\r\ndelegation assures you of its full cooperation as you\r\ncarry out your tasks.\r\nI wish also to thank the Secretariat for the\r\nrelevance of the reports before us; their conciseness\r\nand exactitude makes them easy to use. My delegation\r\nfully endorses the statement made on behalf of the\r\nAfrican Group. Nonetheless, we also wish to make a\r\nfew general comments on the items before us today.\r\nA few months ago, the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) seemed to be at a\r\ncrossroads, on the one hand because of the war in Iraq,\r\nand on the other hand because of the continuing doubts\r\nabout the capacity of African leaders to apply the\r\nprinciples of good political and economic governance\r\nthat they themselves espoused in the Durban\r\nDeclaration of July 2001.\r\nThat apparent uncertainty was dispelled with the\r\nadoption of a more recent declaration on the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD at the second ordinary session\r\nof the African Union Summit, held in Maputo from 10\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nto 12 July 2003. All of these initiatives taken by\r\nAfrican heads of State are important milestones\r\nmarking a genuine commitment to a new start for the\r\ncontinent, which is now being reflected in practical\r\nterms by the fact that some 15 countries have\r\nspontaneously and voluntarily joined the African Peer\r\nReview Mechanism.\r\nI would like to stress here that for my country —\r\nwhose Government on 20 March 2003 took the\r\ndecisive step of joining the Mechanism — peer review\r\nis a vital development tool in view of its significant\r\nimpact on the building of the institutional, political and\r\neconomic capacities of our countries. Without doubt,\r\nthe fact that the first reviews will very soon be carried\r\nout is incontestable proof of the resolve of African\r\nStates to establish a sound environment which will\r\npromote transparent management.\r\nConcerning ongoing progress, we should also\r\nmention the process of creating an African Peace and\r\nSecurity Council. The African continent, without doubt,\r\nneeds to end the wars that continue to ravage it, in order\r\nto seriously plan for its development. The Council is\r\ntherefore vital, and rapid ratification of the Protocol\r\nrelating to its establishment will make it possible for\r\nleaders to prevent, control and resolve conflicts.\r\nMoreover, I take this opportunity here to pay\r\ntribute to the remarkable work done by the Economic\r\nand Social Council concerning African countries\r\nemerging from conflict. As members know, at its most\r\nrecent substantive session the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil extended the mandate of the Ad Hoc Advisory\r\nGroup on Guinea-Bissau and established an Ad Hoc\r\nAdvisory Group on Burundi.\r\nThese new elements on the agenda of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council have served to support\r\nthe concept that there can be no development without\r\npeace. With this fresh impetus, the secretariat of the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD),\r\nthe Commission of the African Union, the Economic\r\nand Social Council and the Security Council should\r\nfurther strengthen their cooperation on issues of peace,\r\nsecurity and development. At this stage, tangible\r\nprogress has been made in Burundi, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and Sierra Leone, with further\r\nprogress expected in Liberia and the Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nMy delegation concurs with the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport concerning the difficulties and constraints in\r\nimplementing NEPAD, particularly the issue of weak\r\ninstitutional capacity for planning and executing\r\ndevelopment programmes at the regional and national\r\nlevels, as well as the problem of inadequate resources.\r\nHowever, in the spirit of the New Partnership, the\r\nprinciple of collective responsibility of all countries of the\r\ncontinent should prevail in seeking resolutions to\r\nproblems. The suggestion that African countries\r\nthemselves might devote their own resources to funding\r\nNEPAD would be welcome and could more readily\r\nattract the support of development partners. As for\r\nmobilizing the international community, which has thus\r\nfar been regarded as modest, it should be encouraged to\r\nkeep pace with the efforts and determination of African\r\nleaders. Africa, moreover, is hoping for the support of\r\nthe international community in the crucial area of\r\naccess to markets of the North. In that spirit, it would\r\nbe desirable for initiatives such as African Growth and\r\nOpportunity Act to be extended to all African countries,\r\nwithout ideological considerations, and for agricultural\r\nsubsidies by Europe and North America to be granted\r\nin accordance with World Trade Organization rules.\r\nThe success of NEPAD requires a participatory\r\napproach to its implementation. Burkina Faso believes\r\nthat every African State must initiate broad debate to\r\nmake their population at all levels of society aware of this\r\nnew initiative so that the people may take ownership of it.\r\nThe political will that has been forcefully expressed by\r\nheads of State will remain wishful thinking if grass-roots\r\ncommunities are not deeply involved in the\r\nimplementation of this programme, especially since the\r\nsocial environment is just as important as good\r\ngovernance, stability and many other factors affecting\r\nthe decisions of various public and private international\r\ninvestors. That is why Burkina Faso has launched a\r\nbroad public awareness campaign on NEPAD, through,\r\namong other things, the holding of public debates with\r\ncivil society, universities and national and local\r\ndecision makers.\r\nMoreover, a subregional approach, as a strategic\r\nframework for the implementation of NEPAD\r\nmechanisms, has prompted my country to initiate and host\r\nover the past months subregional meetings on sectoral\r\nissues, such as on agriculture and livestock raising, in\r\nconjunction with the Food and Agricultural Organization,\r\nas well as on education, science and culture with the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization. In the same vein, Burkina Faso will be\r\nhosting a summit of African Union heads of State on\r\nemployment and the fight against poverty in 2004.\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nAs it enters its operational phase, NEPAD will\r\nneed strengthened human capacities. Burkina Faso is\r\npreparing for this by establishing an instrument that is\r\nable to meet the new requirements, namely a political,\r\neconomic and social policy analysis centre. Furthermore,\r\nBurkina Faso is now adopting its second national plan\r\nfor good governance, which will incorporate the\r\ntargets, standards and criteria of the African Peer\r\nReview Mechanism for the forthcoming review in the\r\nframework of that Mechanism, in September 2004. My\r\ncountry intends to continue to pursue its advocacy\r\nactivities while stressing the implementation of\r\ndevelopment projects in accordance with the guidelines\r\nagreed in NEPAD, according to which we have adapted\r\nour national campaign against poverty.\r\nI would like to conclude by commending the\r\nUnited Nations system for its invaluable contributions\r\nover the past decades to extricate Africa from\r\nunderdevelopment. The follow-up to the implementation\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 57/7 once again grants\r\nthe United Nations a leadership role in coordinating\r\nand harmonizing international activities for Africa.\r\nMr. Isakov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The progressive development of Africa is\r\nbeing stalled by several factors. The destructive impact\r\nof illegal armed groups are eroding the very basis of\r\nthe existence of sovereign States. They continually fuel\r\nthe illicit trade in small arms and light weapons,\r\nmercenary activities, the use of child soldiers, gross\r\nviolations of human rights and the norms of\r\nhumanitarian law, the illegal export of natural\r\nresources and transborder crime. Consequently, conflict\r\nthat spills across borders takes on a subregional nature,\r\ndestroys State structures and law and order and causes\r\nrefugee flows. They also threaten the peace and\r\nstability of the entire continent. We can counter this\r\nonly by acting together.\r\nRussia supports the efforts undertaken by the United\r\nNations to strengthen the peacekeeping capacities of\r\nAfrica and establish effective cooperation in the field\r\nof peacekeeping. We note with satisfaction that the\r\nprogress that has been achieved during the past year in\r\nthe settlement of armed conflict in Africa. The\r\nsuccessful United Nations peacekeeping operations in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone,\r\nLiberia and other crisis zones show the intrinsic link\r\nbetween peace and stability and fully-fledged socio-\r\neconomic recovery in conflict-torn countries.\r\nThe new kinds of partnership being forged\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations\r\nis of particular significance in this context. Among the\r\npositive examples of such partnership are the Security\r\nCouncil-mandated European Union mission to the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and the deployment\r\nof the forces of the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States in Liberia. The events over the past\r\nmonths in the Central African Republic and Guinea-\r\nBissau attest to the seriousness of the problems that\r\nAfrican countries are facing in the post-conflict period.\r\nThe entire experience of Africa’s development\r\nshows that what will prevent destabilization is the\r\nstrengthening of State institutions, the development of\r\ndemocracy, tackling ongoing economic problems,\r\ncombating corruption, providing secure borders, non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of other States and\r\nmutually beneficial relations with neighbours.\r\nMoreover, it is quite clear that the main\r\nresponsibility for Africa’s future falls to the Africans\r\nthemselves. One important step forward was the recent\r\nadoption of the principle of good-neighbourly relations by\r\nsouthern African countries under the Secretary-General’s\r\nauspices. We are convinced that such exemplary\r\nmultilateral cooperation with the participation of the\r\nUnited Nations can be used in other parts of Africa.\r\nRussia will continue to do its part with the resources\r\navailable to it to strengthen peacekeeping capacity of\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe social and economic aspects of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development are crucial for\r\nguiding Africa towards sustainable development. In\r\nthat respect, Russia will focus its efforts on debt\r\nalleviation of African countries in the framework of the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative.\r\nBetween 1998 and 2002, Russia wrote off $11.2 billion\r\nof the debt of African countries, including $3.4 billion\r\nin 2002. A decision was made that Russia would\r\ncontribute an additional $10 million to the Initiative\r\nTrust Fund between 2003 and 2004. The States of the\r\ncontinent are being given wide trade preference.\r\nCurrent Russian legislation stipulates that traditional\r\nexports from the least developed countries, most of\r\nwhich are African, are exempt from customs import\r\nduties. These goods are not subject to quantitative\r\nimport restrictions or to anti-dumping, countervailing\r\nor special protection measures. More than 80 per cent\r\nof Russia’s imports from Africa receive preferential\r\ntreatment.\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nWith the assistance of Russian companies, several\r\nmajor investment projects are being carried out in\r\nAfrica, including projects to develop mineral resources,\r\nenergy and metallurgy. Russia provides tangible\r\nassistance to African countries in areas such as training\r\nand public health. Each year they are granted\r\napproximately 800 Russian State scholarships. Russian\r\nteachers and doctors are working in the continent. In\r\nthe context of the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, Russia is assisting African\r\ncountries to help fight diverse infectious diseases.\r\nRussia provides the African countries\r\nhumanitarian assistance to deal with the effects of\r\nnatural disasters. During 2002 and 2003, assistance was\r\nprovided to Algeria, Ethiopia and Eritrea, and through\r\nthe World Food Programme Russia has given\r\nemergency food aid to Angola. In 2003, Russia made a\r\nvoluntary contribution to the budget of the Office of\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for\r\nthe direct funding of humanitarian operations in Africa.\r\nWe intend to continue to participate actively in\r\ninternational efforts in support of the country’s social\r\neconomic development.\r\nMr. De La Sablière (France) (spoke in French):\r\nFrance welcomes the high level of attention being\r\ngiven to Africa by the Assembly. Our debate today, like\r\nthe resolution we adopted last year, attests to the\r\nimportance assumed by the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) — an initiative of\r\nAfrican countries — and the need to continue and to\r\nstrengthen our partnership with Africa.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report describes clearly\r\nand fully the progress made and the steps still to be\r\ntaken. We agree with his conclusions and\r\nrecommendations. Their implementation must be a\r\npriority, and France will make its full contribution.\r\nThe Italian presidency of the European Union\r\ndescribed earlier the actions of the Europeans in this\r\nregard. Our own commitment falls within that\r\nframework. We aim to work together with African\r\ncountries, according to their defined principles, which\r\nare also ours, and in keeping with their priorities —\r\npeace and security, fighting poverty, hunger and\r\ndisease, access to water and education and protection\r\nof natural resources. Those concur with the goals that\r\nthe United Nations and the international community\r\nestablished at the Millennium Summit, the Monterrey\r\nConference and the Johannesburg Summit. Indeed, we\r\nall know that the Millennium Development Goals apply\r\nparticularly to Africa.\r\nAttaining those Goals is still possible. To that\r\nend, we must apply all instruments available to us to\r\nsupport the efforts of African countries themselves —\r\ninvestment, trade, official development assistance, debt\r\nrelief, innovative sources of financing, technology\r\ntransfer and expertise. Each must be used to a greater\r\nextent and more effectively than we do now.\r\nI will not review most of those points. Our Italian\r\ncolleague has demonstrated the resolve of Europeans to\r\nmake progress in that direction for the purpose of\r\nsecuring sustainable development for Africa. I will\r\nmake a few additional remarks on some points to\r\nwhich France attaches special importance.\r\nFirst, the work done since last year within NEPAD\r\nand by the African Union has been remarkable, as was\r\ndemonstrated by the outcome of the Maputo Summit in\r\nJuly. I am thinking particularly of the Peer Review\r\nMechanism, with 16 countries having already signed\r\nthe memorandum. We welcome the establishment of the\r\ngroup of eminent persons and the commitment of the\r\ncountries that have volunteered to serve on it. I am also\r\nthinking of the policies designed by NEPAD in important\r\nareas such as agriculture, health and the environment.\r\nWe are all aware that much remains to be done,\r\nbut action has begun. Now we need to move to\r\nimplementation. The subregional organizations can\r\nplay a very valuable role in that regard.\r\nMy second point, the partnership between\r\nNEPAD and the Group of 8 (G-8), was further built\r\nupon in Evian, along the lines set by the Genoa and\r\nKananaskis summits. The report adopted by the heads\r\nof State and Government spells out how the G-8\r\nmembers will strive to respond to the ambitions of the\r\nAfrican countries. I would also like to draw attention to\r\nG-8 support for establishing an early warning mechanism\r\nand for the creation of a pre-positioned African force,\r\nin keeping with the so-called Berlin Process adopted at\r\nEvian and Maputo. This is one of the most important\r\nachievements of the Partnership, as peace and security\r\nare essential to development and prosperity.\r\nRatification of the protocol establishing the African\r\nUnion Peace and Security Council will mark a another\r\npositive step forward. The European Union, for its part,\r\nis ready to support African peacekeeping operations\r\nunder United Nations auspices.\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nThirdly, I wish to mention some of the priorities\r\nset by NEPAD that we strongly support, together with\r\nthe European Union and the G-8. These priorities are\r\nboth interdependent and critical to the success of the\r\nwhole programme.\r\nThe first priority is to combat AIDS. That\r\npandemic affects certain African countries to a tragic\r\nextent. The meetings on 22 September in New York\r\ndemonstrated the strength of political mobilization\r\nwithin the international community. It is essential that\r\nthat be translated into practical terms through greater\r\neffort. Following the Secretary-General, the President\r\nof the French Republic has appealed to all donors to\r\nincrease their support to the Global Fund in order to\r\nraise $3 billion needed by the Fund as early as next\r\nyear. Europe, for its part, has already committed itself\r\nto the Fund. At the same time, the agreement achieved\r\nconcerning access to medicine is important. It is vital\r\nthat the countries that need it take full advantage of it.\r\nThe second priority is access to water and\r\nsanitation. The goals set at the Millennium Summit and\r\nthe Johannesburg Summit are crucial. Following the\r\nKyoto Forum, the G-8 adopted a plan of action that\r\naims particularly at supporting NEPAD efforts in that\r\narea. All possible sources of financing should now be\r\nmobilized. The World Bank is a part of that work. The\r\nEuropean Union envisages the creation of a European\r\nwater fund, whose arrangements are still under review.\r\nWe hope that the United Nations will also play a full\r\nrole in this area.\r\nThe third priority is to combat hunger. As\r\nPresident Lula noted, food security is a matter of global\r\nconcern. More than 40 million people are likely to die\r\nof hunger in Africa. While we need to take immediate\r\nmeasures to cope with threats of humanitarian crises,\r\nlong-term solutions are also necessary. NEPAD has\r\nlogically made agricultural development one of its\r\npriorities. For its part, the G-8 has committed itself to\r\nworking to reverse the decline in official development\r\nassistance to agriculture and to enhance the trading\r\npotential of the countries concerned. The Ministerial\r\nDeclaration adopted by the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil in July expresses the same ideas. In that\r\nrespect, too, implementation will be crucial.\r\nThe importance of infrastructure should not be\r\nunderestimated. NEPAD and the subregional\r\norganizations represent a natural framework for\r\ndiscussing infrastructure. We are committed to\r\nencouraging investment in this area, including in the\r\nprivate sector.\r\nMy fourth and final point relates to trade. We\r\ndeeply regret the failure of the Cancún meeting.\r\nEverybody loses in such circumstances. We are aware,\r\nhowever, that the primary victims are the most\r\nvulnerable countries. When all those involved are\r\nready, and negotiations resume, heightened attention\r\nmust be paid to the specific needs of African countries.\r\nFrance and the European Union, as the Italian\r\npresidency of the Union has noted, have made\r\nproposals in this regard relating to market access,\r\nexport subsidies for agricultural products and the\r\nproblem of commodity prices — an issue that you,\r\nMr. President, have made one of your priorities. We\r\nhope that those ideas will be taken into account.\r\nSupport for NEPAD should involve the pooling of\r\nall of our efforts, and should be regarded as a long-\r\nterm undertaking. That is why France has proposed\r\nextending and expanding the partnership with the\r\nGroup of Eight to other partners and international\r\norganizations that are involved. In this regard, we will\r\nbe hosting, in Paris, the first meeting of a new forum\r\nfor partnership with Africa, whose mission will be to\r\nmonitor and support the progress made by Africans on\r\nall issues. The Secretary-General will, of course, be\r\nrepresented in that forum.\r\nThe United Nations plays a key role in support of\r\nNEPAD through its various agencies, which should\r\nlend greater support to existing policies, with a view to\r\nmobilizing the international community and ensuring\r\nthat its activities are coherent and properly organized in\r\nterms of monitoring and evaluation of results. In this\r\nregard, we welcome the action taken by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his Special Adviser.\r\nAfrica and NEPAD must remain at the heart of\r\nthe General Assembly’s agenda as an issue of primary\r\nimportance. France, working within the European\r\nUnion, will lend its full support to a resolution that\r\nreflects the ambition that inspired us last year, taking\r\nnote of the changes that have taken place and charting\r\nthe course to follow next year.\r\nAs the President of the Republic has noted,\r\nconfidence in Africa has brought us together. We are\r\ncommitted to breaking the vicious circle of\r\npowerlessness and lack of mobilization. Our duty here\r\nin the General Assembly is to ensure that that\r\ncommitment is fulfilled.\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nMr. Negroponte (United States of America): I\r\nam pleased to speak today in affirmation of what\r\nPresident Bush has called the growing strategic\r\nrelationship between the United States and the African\r\ncontinent. Africa matters to the United States\r\nGovernment because it matters to the American people.\r\nOur ties have taught us unforgettable lessons of human\r\nsuffering and human potential, and they have given us\r\nunshakeable confidence in the human spirit and in our\r\ncommon future.\r\nAs President Bush said in Abuja, Nigeria, last\r\nJuly, working together, we can help make this a decade\r\nof rising prosperity and expanding peace across Africa.\r\nThat goal is ambitious, but the way forward is clear\r\nand well marked on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.\r\nThe United States has strongly supported the\r\nobjectives of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) since its inception. NEPAD is a\r\ndramatic commitment by African leaders to end conflict\r\nand hasten progress by taking concrete action to promote\r\npeace and stability, to consolidate democracy and to\r\nprovide sound economic management and people-\r\ncentred development. That is as it should be: Africa’s\r\nfuture mapped out by Africans on behalf of Africans.\r\nWe commend African leaders for their vision in\r\nlaunching NEPAD. In particular, we wish to recognize\r\nPresident Mbeki, President Wade and President\r\nObasanjo for their pivotal role in developing and\r\nguiding the implementation of NEPAD. We are\r\nencouraged by recent progress in the implementation of\r\nwhat we hope will be a rigorous and transparent\r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism, overseen by the\r\nPanel of Eminent Persons.\r\nThese endeavours have been reinforced by the\r\nrole African leaders and regional organizations, such as\r\nthe Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States, the\r\nSouthern African Development Community and the\r\nAfrican Union peacekeeping mission in Burundi, are\r\nplaying in preventing and resolving conflict in Africa.\r\nAfrica’s leadership reversed a coup d’état in Sao\r\nTome and Principe in July; played a pivotal role in\r\ndefusing the conflict in Liberia; and provided critical\r\npeacekeeping functions in Côte d’Ivoire. It is making\r\nprogress in containing tensions in Burundi and helping\r\nto address the complex, troubling situation in\r\nZimbabwe. It has played a key role in peace\r\nnegotiations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nand it is guiding African-led mediation efforts in Sudan\r\nthat are bearing fruit.\r\nThe United States has a deep and continuing\r\ncommitment to these initiatives in pursuit of peace and\r\nsecurity, which are so essential to the continent’s hopes\r\nfor strong and sustainable economic growth and\r\ndevelopment. Thus we are training peacekeepers,\r\nholding military education seminars at the Africa\r\nCenter for Strategic Studies and working with African\r\nmediators and subregional organizations to enhance\r\ntheir conflict-resolution capabilities.\r\nAt the same time, we are supporting the efforts of\r\nAfrica’s leaders to stop war and terror on the continent\r\nand working with those same leaders to expand trade,\r\nopportunity and enterprise for the African people.\r\nAmerica is already the world’s largest investor in\r\nAfrica’s economies, but enormous opportunities remain\r\nopen to us both. Under the historic African Growth and\r\nOpportunity Act, the United states is opening its\r\ndynamic markets to thousands of products from Africa.\r\nThis reflects a shared United States-NEPAD emphasis\r\non the vital role of trade in economic growth and\r\ndevelopment, bringing millions of dollars in new\r\ninvestments to Africa’s shores, along with thousands of\r\nnew jobs for African workers.\r\nThese new trade and investment linkages benefit\r\nnot only Africa’s trade with the United States but also\r\neconomic ties within Africa itself and between Africa\r\nand the rest of the world. The fact is that African\r\ncountries have suffered too long from their relative\r\nisolation from the global economy.\r\nWe must therefore find ways to overcome the\r\nfailure of the Cancún Ministerial Meeting to forge a\r\nconsensus on how to further open the world’s markets and\r\ntake advantage of the promise of market-led, poverty-\r\nreducing growth. Hundreds of billions of dollars per year\r\nin increased income — and the lives that would be\r\nimproved by that income — are at stake. Ambitious\r\nglobal trade liberalization offers as much promise to\r\nAfrica as to any other region in the world, perhaps more.\r\nComplementing United States trade policies, the\r\nPresident’s Millennium Challenge Account, which is\r\nnow before the Congress, will make substantially\r\nincreased resources available to help developing\r\ncountries that demonstrate, not promise, a strong\r\ncommitment to liberty and prosperity for all their\r\npeople.\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nThe Millennium Challenge Account draws on one\r\nof the essential lessons of development: countries prosper\r\nwhen their Governments function justly, effectively and\r\ntransparently. This requires the rule of law, independent\r\njudiciaries and respect for the rights of citizens, including\r\nthe right to choose their own representatives.\r\nOf course, these elements are integral to Africa’s\r\nability to achieve the vision of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). As President Bush\r\nstated earlier this year in South Africa, “NEPAD ... can\r\nhelp extend democracy and free markets and\r\ntransparency across the continent ...”.\r\nIndeed, to the extent NEPAD achieves the goals\r\nof good governance, our own commitments to African\r\npeace, security, trade and economic development will\r\nhave greater impact. The task now is for African\r\nGovernments to translate NEPAD’s aspirations into\r\nspecific actions at the national level by investing in\r\ntheir people, implementing responsible economic\r\npolicies that foster trade and investment and by being\r\nopen and accountable in their budget, procurement and\r\ntax systems.\r\nNeedless to say, we do recognize that even as\r\nmany African nations accept the responsibility of good\r\ngovernment, they also confront extreme challenges in\r\nthe areas of health, education, and humanitarian relief.\r\nThe challenge of implementing ambitious reforms\r\nwhile human survival is in doubt can be overwhelming.\r\nAs Africa’s true partner and friend, our commitment to\r\nAfrica therefore includes the $15 billion Emergency\r\nPlan for AIDS Relief and continued United States\r\nleadership in the global effort to fight HIV/AIDS; the\r\nAfrican Education Initiative, contributing over $200\r\nmillion in new money, combined with existing\r\nprogrammes, to total $600 million over the next five\r\nyears for basic education in Africa; and $850 million in\r\nemergency assistance to help Africa address its food\r\ncrises.\r\nTaken all together, we believe that the elements of\r\nthe United States Government’s policy towards Africa\r\nreinforces NEPAD’s affirmation of an African destiny\r\nshaped by the wise stewardship of democratically elected\r\nAfrican Governments. Our overarching goal, then, is to\r\nfulfil the President’s vision of a growing strategic\r\nrelationship between the continent of Africa and the\r\nUnited States of America. The shared history, friendship\r\nand common values that bind us together demand\r\nnothing less.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): I wish to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for the two comprehensive reports\r\nthat are under consideration today — one on the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)\r\n(A/58/254) and another on the causes of conflict and\r\nthe promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa (A/58/352). We believe that\r\nboth these reports are extremely important and while\r\nthey might address similar challenges, they are\r\nnevertheless distinct. NEPAD is a programme of the\r\nAfrican Union, an African-grown and owned socio-\r\neconomic plan for the continent, with a number of very\r\ndistinct priorities and programmes.\r\nThe report concerning the causes of conflict and\r\nthe promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa addresses among other things,\r\npeacekeeping, peacemaking, refugees and the\r\nproliferation of small arms, issues that are dealt with\r\nby other institutions of the African Union.\r\nOver a year ago, during a high-level plenary\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly on NEPAD, our\r\ndiscussions focused mostly on what NEPAD hopes to\r\nachieve and how we expected it to work. Today, we are\r\nglad to report that significant progress has been made\r\nin the implementation of NEPAD.\r\nNEPAD has completed many continent-wide\r\nprogrammes and strategies. These include\r\ncomprehensive plans for African agricultural\r\ndevelopment, health programmes and a multi-sectoral\r\nAIDS strategy, a NEPAD education programme, a\r\ntourism strategy, and programmes for industrialization\r\nand infrastructure development. The Heads of State and\r\nGovernment Implementation Committee has proven to\r\nbe a useful mechanism for the overall, hands-on\r\noverseeing of the implementation of NEPAD.\r\nMore important, Africa has moved beyond the\r\ncompletion of strategies and programmes to\r\nimplementation. At the subregional level, there have\r\nbeen a number of projects started, including the\r\nelectricity link between the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and Zambia, the oil pipeline that runs through a\r\nnumber of West African Countries, the New Rice for\r\nAfrica initiative, the printing of school textbooks,\r\nschool feeding programmes and many more.\r\nThe African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM)\r\nwhich is supposed to help promote good governance on\r\nthe African continent, has now been established. While\r\nthis is quite a novel and courageous process to be\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nundertaken by any group of countries, Africa is\r\nconvinced of the contribution that the APRM could\r\nmake to promote good governance on our continent. It\r\nis therefore very encouraging that more than 16\r\ncountries have so far acceded to the Peer Review\r\nMechanism and many more are considering becoming\r\npart of the Mechanism.\r\nSouth Africa appreciates the focus placed on the\r\nAPRM in the Secretary-General’s report and the effort\r\nmade to describe the structures and procedures involved\r\nin it. The APRM is rightly described as a means of\r\nmonitoring progress towards good economic and political\r\ngovernance through peer learning and peer-sharing.\r\nBut contrary to the report of the Secretary-General,\r\nthe APRM was not meant to be a “means of attracting\r\nsupport from development partners”. (A/58/254, para. 8)\r\nRather, the APRM was Africa’s own effort for seeking\r\ngood governance for Africa itself and not as a means to\r\nappeal to the international community.\r\nWe have also seen progress in the United Nations\r\nwith the establishment of the Office of the Special\r\nAdviser on Africa. That Office is already making quite\r\na difference and has had numerous outputs, such as\r\ncontributing to the reports before us today. We hope it\r\nwill be provided with the necessary resources to enable\r\nit to fulfil its important mandate within the United\r\nNations. In this regard, we look forward to the\r\nunveiling and implementation of the advocacy strategy\r\nof the Office of the Special Adviser.\r\nWe are further encouraged by the growing efforts\r\nof the United Nations system to mainstream NEPAD\r\ninto its priorities and programmes. The close\r\ncooperation between the NEPAD secretariat and\r\nAfrican regional and subregional organizations, as well\r\nas individual Governments within the United Nations\r\nsystem, is, indeed, very heartening. We hope to see this\r\ntrend expand even further in future.\r\nI am pleased that the report does not neglect to\r\nhighlight the challenges and constraints still faced by\r\nmany African countries. In a true spirit of partnership,\r\nthese cannot be addressed through the efforts of the\r\nAfrican countries alone. They need the support of the\r\ninternational community. Such challenges and\r\nconstraints are particularly clear in the areas of\r\nresource mobilization.\r\nRegarding external debt, South Africa appreciates\r\nthe debt relief provided by a number of both developed\r\nand developing country bilateral creditors. The efforts\r\nto fully finance the Trust Fund financing the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative are\r\nalso valuable. The increase in the number of African\r\ncountries reaching their decision and completion points\r\nis also appreciated. In its current form, however, the HIPC\r\nInitiative seems not to be able to deliver the relief that\r\neveryone expected of it when it was enhanced some four\r\nyears ago. One of the results is that some heavily\r\nindebted poor countries still spend more on servicing\r\ntheir debt than on health and education.\r\nWe are looking forward to the international\r\nconference planned for 2004, at which we must look\r\nbeyond HIPC and come up with new proposals for\r\nfinding a solution to Africa’s untenable debt burden.\r\nConsideration will have to be given to the proposals\r\ncontained in the Monterrey Consensus and most recent\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution on external debt with\r\nregard to the link between debt relief and a country’s\r\nability to generate the necessary resources to attain the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nSouth Africa appreciates the increase in recent\r\nyears in the flow of official development assistance to\r\nAfrica, although it has not yet reached the 1990 level.\r\nIn view of the limited supply of official development\r\nassistance, my delegation fully supports the efforts to\r\nincrease aid effectiveness. Donor countries also place\r\nparticular emphasis on the need to improve the\r\neffectiveness of official development assistance. That\r\nstance, however, contrasts sharply with the reluctance\r\nby some donor countries to untie certain types of aid to\r\ncertain countries. The main consideration should be to\r\nensure the maximum impact and benefit to be derived\r\nby the recipient country from the aid, not the benefits it\r\ncould provide to other constituencies and interests.\r\nOtherwise the concept of aid efficiency would become\r\na mere slogan which is applied selectively.\r\nA very tragic picture was painted by the failure of\r\nCancún to deliver a result that would have favoured the\r\nAfrican and other developing countries. It almost made\r\na mockery of the vows by all and sundry to make the\r\nDoha Round a development round, as well as earlier\r\nundertakings to provide increased market access to\r\nproducts from Africa. It was almost absurd — if not tragic\r\n— to see the four African least developed cotton-\r\nproducing countries pitted against the giants of world\r\ntrade, given that the cotton subsidies alone surpass the\r\ngross domestic product of those four African countries\r\ncombined. Despite the most persuasive arguments of\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nthe African least developed countries that they be given\r\nan equal chance to compete fairly, those poor countries\r\nwere asked to find alternative livelihoods. If that is not\r\nan indictment of the current state of world trade, it is\r\ndifficult to imagine what could be.\r\nIt is sad to see how the potential of the Cancún\r\nmeeting to provide African and other developing\r\ncountries with an opportunity to work their way out of\r\nabject poverty was squandered. It almost suggests that\r\nsome want developing countries to remain forever\r\ndependent on the goodwill of donor Governments.\r\nIn the area of South-South cooperation, there has\r\nbeen a growing trend towards economic and technical\r\ncooperation between Africa and the other developing\r\nregions of Asia and Latin America. This has been given\r\nadded impetus by the Asian-African Subregional\r\nOrganizations Conference, which was co-hosted by\r\nSouth Africa and Indonesia in Bandung earlier this\r\nyear. The second Africa-China Forum will take place in\r\nDecember this year, as will the Ministerial Conference\r\non South-South Cooperation, in Marrakech, Morocco.\r\nEven more promising was the announcement during the\r\ngeneral debate by India, Brazil and South Africa of an\r\ninitiative to address issues of hunger and poverty. This\r\nmarks the beginning of an initiative by developing\r\ncountries to address issues that are urgent for the survival\r\nand prosperity of developing countries themselves.\r\nSouth Africa believes that certain actions could be\r\ntaken to make NEPAD more effective. These include the\r\nneed to expand national focal points in order to ensure a\r\ncoordinated and integrated implementation of NEPAD\r\npriorities at the national level. It will also be important\r\nto further popularize NEPAD at the national and\r\ncontinental levels so as to ensure buy-in by the general\r\npublic. A clear and comprehensive communication\r\nstrategy will be needed. The non-governmental and\r\ncommunity-based organizations can play an important\r\nrole in this regard. We welcomed the meeting\r\norganized by the African Union to discuss NEPAD\r\nwith stakeholders in civil society in Africa. As of\r\ntoday, there is complete support for NEPAD in civil\r\nsociety and the private sector, and this is resulting in an\r\nadded advantage on the part of many countries, which\r\nare deepening their commitment to NEPAD values and\r\npractices.\r\nI would like to make some comments on issues\r\nspecifically raised in the Secretary-General’s report on\r\nthe causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa. In the\r\nfield of peace and security, Africans are taking the\r\ninitiative to address African problems. South Africa\r\nwelcomes the extensive involvement of the United\r\nNations in assisting African countries to resolve and\r\nmanage conflicts. As the report points out,\r\ncoordination between the United Nations and the\r\nAfrican Union is particularly pertinent to post-conflict\r\npeace-building. Policies must be complementary and\r\naim at achieving durable peace. In this regard, we were\r\nparticularly pleased to hear that the Secretary-General\r\nconsults regularly with the Bretton Woods institutions\r\nwith a view to ensuring peace-friendly structural\r\nadjustment policies in Africa and elsewhere.\r\nSouth Africa’s own commitment to the promotion\r\nof an integrated and coordinated approach to post-\r\nconflict reconstruction is best demonstrated by our\r\nstrong support for the creation and work of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council Ad Hoc Advisory\r\nGroups on Guinea-Bissau and on Burundi. The work of\r\nthose two Groups has already made quite a contribution\r\nto closer cooperation between different organs and\r\nstructures within the United Nations system,\r\nparticularly the closer cooperation between the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Security Council.\r\nThe report itself refers to the creation of the United\r\nNations Development Programme Emergency\r\nEconomic Management Fund for Guinea-Bissau, as\r\nproposed by the Ad Hoc Group on Guinea-Bissau.\r\nOn the peacekeeping front, a number of efforts\r\nhave been made over the past few years aimed at\r\nbuilding Africa’s capacity to resolve and manage\r\nconflict. The contributions of the European Union, as\r\nwell as of the Group of Eight industrialized countries,\r\ndeserve special mention. The complexity of conflict\r\nmanagement also highlights the importance of close\r\ncoordination between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations. Assistance by the United Nations in\r\ndrafting a ceasefire agreement for Burundi serves as a\r\ngood example of constructive cooperation. The lessons\r\nlearned and best practices emanating from the long and\r\nwide experience of the United Nations in areas such as\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration and\r\nceasefire implementation should certainly be shared\r\nwith regional groups involved in peacemaking efforts.\r\nWe welcome further the emphasis placed on\r\nsocial development in the report. There can be no\r\ndoubt about the important link between the promotion\r\nof peace and the promotion of social development. The\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nimportance of an integrated approach to development\r\nwas also highlighted during the recent World Summit\r\nfor Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002,\r\nwhich also underscored the importance of coordination\r\nwithin the United Nations system in its interaction with\r\nAfrica.\r\nIn this regard, South Africa welcomes the recent\r\nadoption by the Commission for Social Development\r\nof a resolution on the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). The resolution highlights the\r\nneed to strengthen, in a spirit of partnership,\r\ninternational, regional and subregional cooperation for\r\nsocial development and implementation of the outcome\r\nof the World Summit for Social Development and the\r\ntwenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe Commission for Social Development is also\r\ncalled upon to give prominence to the social\r\ndimensions of NEPAD in its future priority themes.\r\nSouth Africa is looking forward to the adoption by the\r\nGeneral Assembly during its current session of the\r\nreport of the forty-first session of the Commission for\r\nSocial Development.\r\nAs far as the future of the report on the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa is concerned, South\r\nAfrica will wish to see the continuation of the report.\r\nWhile it may be true that many of the issues dealt with\r\nin that report can be found elsewhere, it is of great\r\nimportance to have the information collected in one\r\nreport that focuses on all the issues as they particularly\r\nrelate to Africa.\r\nSir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): Mr.\r\nPresident, I associate the United Kingdom fully with\r\nthe statement made by the presidency of the European\r\nUnion. I also join others in thanking you, Sir, for this\r\ndebate. The issues are central to the work of the United\r\nNations and our common agenda of poverty eradication\r\nand sustainable development.\r\nAfrica’s current position is dramatic. If its\r\nsituation does not improve, 23 countries will fail to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nDemocracy is gradually taking hold in the continent,\r\nbut the number of poor people in the region continues\r\nto increase. Maternal and child mortality is increasing:\r\na woman has a 1 in 13 chance of dying in pregnancy or\r\nchildbirth and 75 per cent of the world’s HIV/AIDS\r\nsufferers are in sub-Saharan Africa.\r\nAfrica’s problems are complex and\r\ninterconnected. Let me highlight four: first, conflict in\r\nkey countries and regions. In January 2000 more than\r\nhalf of all African countries were affected by conflict,\r\nalthough I’m glad to say there are now promising signs\r\nof improvement. Secondly, governance — in some\r\nAfrican countries the State has effectively failed. Thirdly,\r\nterms of trade have deteriorated and commodity prices\r\nhave fallen. The result has been low investment and\r\neconomic growth, insufficient jobs created for the poor\r\nand too few resources for health and education.\r\nFourthly, HIV/AIDS has caused huge damage right\r\nacross the continent.\r\nBut the news is not all bad. NEPAD is the most\r\npromising African-led development initiative in a\r\ngeneration. It aims to tackle HIV/AIDS, reduce poverty\r\nand sustain long-term economic growth. It is backed by a\r\ncommitment to improve governance, build peacekeeping\r\ncapacity and create the right environment for investment.\r\nThe African Peer Review Mechanism, to begin in Ghana\r\nthis year, is an important tool that we strongly support.\r\nAfrican countries know and have recognized that\r\nthe primary responsibility rests with them. The\r\ninternational response to Africa’s challenges must be\r\nimplemented in partnership with those African\r\nGovernments, working within the framework of the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).\r\nThe G-8 responded two years ago by agreeing to\r\na series of commitments under the G-8 Africa Action\r\nPlan. In June this year, G-8 countries reported the\r\nprogress. We now look forward to the Africa partners\r\nforum meeting next month, under French chairmanship,\r\nto consider how further progress can be made.\r\nLet me set out five areas which the United\r\nKingdom considers require urgent further international\r\neffort. First, more and better development assistance.\r\nThat is why the United Kingdom development\r\nassistance to Africa will rise to over £1 billion by 2006.\r\nBut we must all increase the financing available for\r\ndevelopment. The United Kingdom is exploring with\r\npartners the best means of achieving this, for example,\r\nGordon Brown’s proposal for a new international\r\nfinance facility. This aims to double resources for\r\nofficial development assistance up to 2015 by tapping\r\ninto new private sources. We welcome the interest in\r\nthis from the Secretary-General, other Member States,\r\nand the Bretton Woods institutions.\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nSecondly, we need to tackle trade. The current\r\nsystem does not work for the least developed countries.\r\nAfrica’s share of world trade is now less than 1 per\r\ncent. Trade rules must be improved to benefit the\r\nworld’s poor. The failure of the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) talks in Cancún is most damaging\r\nto the world’s poorest countries. Africa stands to get a\r\nbetter deal through multilateral negotiations in the\r\nWTO than through a multitude of regional and bilateral\r\nagreements. That is why the United Kingdom is\r\ndetermined to do all it can to get the Doha\r\nDevelopment Agenda round back on track. We are\r\nabsolutely committed to progress in the negotiations\r\nand progress multilaterally on those areas most critical\r\nto African countries — agricultural market access,\r\nspecial and differential treatment provisions for poorer\r\ncountries, and reductions in trade-distorting subsidies.\r\nThirdly, we must support African efforts to\r\nresolve armed conflicts. We should pay tribute to what\r\nis being achieved, for example, the substantial efforts\r\nby the Economic Community of West African States in\r\nWest Africa.\r\nAfrican countries and regional and subregional\r\norganizations deserve international support so that they\r\ncan engage more effectively to prevent and resolve\r\nviolent conflicts and undertake peace support\r\noperations. A plan for training and operational support\r\nhas been agreed between the G-8 and the African\r\ncountries. The United Nations will be closely involved\r\nin its implementation and we must support African\r\nefforts to eliminate the flow of illicit weapons on the\r\ncontinent. The United Kingdom has pledged over £20\r\nmillion to combat the proliferation of small arms,\r\nincluding regional programmes in East Africa, the\r\nGreat Lakes region and Southern Africa. It remains the\r\ncase that small arms kill more people in Africa as a\r\nwhole, than anything other than disease.\r\nFourthly, we must do more to fight one of Africa’s\r\nbiggest challenges, HIV/AIDS. Twenty-nine million\r\npeople across Africa are living with that scourge. The\r\nWorld Bank has warned that several African economies\r\nare facing collapse and family incomes are being\r\ndecimated because of HIV/AIDS. The United Kingdom\r\nis proud to be the second largest donor of HIV/AIDS\r\nassistance and in 2002-2003 we invested over £270\r\nmillion worldwide, the dollar equivalent being in\r\nexcess of $420 million. This will enable all Africans\r\nwho need it to have access to effective HIV/AIDS\r\ntreatment. That goal is an international priority.\r\nFifthly, we must work to help strengthen\r\ngovernance in African States. Effective institutions,\r\nrepresentative democracy and accountable government\r\nare essential conditions for private sector investment,\r\ngrowth and poverty reduction. The United Kingdom\r\nsupports stronger capacity-building programmes for\r\nthis.\r\nFurthering the rule of law should be a common\r\ngoal for all Members of the United Nations. The rule of\r\nlaw makes democracy more likely and that, in turn,\r\nmakes conflict less probable.\r\nLet me conclude by saying that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has rightly signalled the importance of a high-\r\nlevel review in this Assembly in 2005 of the progress\r\nbeing made on the Millennium Declaration. I hope that\r\nthe United Kingdom will be able then, as President of\r\nthe G-8 and of the European Union, which falls to us in\r\n2005, to report substantial progress on the\r\ncommitments we have all made. But specifically, it is\r\nvital that all of us do more to support NEPAD and to\r\nsupport Africans in their effort to lift Africa out of\r\npoverty. That is a vital task for the United Nations\r\nsystem and for all its Member States. This, Sir, must be\r\nour shared endeavour.\r\nMr. Mizukami (Japan): The Government of\r\nJapan has been promoting the principles of Africa’s\r\nownership and international partnership for African\r\ndevelopment through the Tokyo International Conference\r\non African Development (TICAD) process since 1993.\r\nTherefore Japan has been sincerely respecting and\r\nsupporting the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), the clear and concrete\r\ndemonstration of Africa’s ownership, from the time of\r\nits launching. Two weeks ago, Japan renewed its\r\ncommitment to supporting NEPAD by hosting the third\r\nTokyo International Conference on African Development\r\n(TICAD III), together with 89 countries and 47\r\norganizations that participated in the Conference.\r\nJapan welcomes the progress made in the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD. We are pleased that the\r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism has been established\r\nand that so far 16 countries have acceded to it. Sharing\r\ngood practices and development experiences through\r\npeer reviews is instrumental in strengthening Africa’s\r\nownership and contributing to Africa’s development\r\nthrough NEPAD. These factors are indispensable for\r\nAfrican development. We hope that the Peer Review\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nMechanism will be promoted further and will be\r\nsuccessful.\r\nWe are also pleased to note the progress made in\r\nareas such as agriculture, health, infrastructure and\r\ninvestment within the framework of NEPAD. However,\r\nwe are concerned that capacity-building in Africa\r\ncontinues to be a serious challenge, coupled with the\r\nbrain drain. We believe that education is the bedrock\r\nfor development and human resources are the key to\r\nnation-building. We strongly hope that both African\r\ncountries and international donors will invest more in\r\nthe development of the skills and abilities of people in\r\nAfrica. Japan believes that Asia-Africa cooperation, a\r\nprincipal feature of the TICAD process, can contribute\r\na lot to capacity-building in Africa.\r\nPrime Minister Koizumi announced at TICAD III\r\nthe three pillars that comprise Japan’s initiative for\r\nassistance to the implementation of NEPAD.\r\nWith regard to the first pillar, “human-centred\r\ndevelopment”, human resource development is always\r\nJapan’s top priority in development assistance. In\r\naddition, on the occasion of TICAD III, the Prime\r\nMinister announced that over the next five years Japan\r\naims to extend grant-in-aid assistance to Africa\r\ntotalling $1 billion in areas such as health and medical\r\ncare, including measures against HIV/AIDS, as well as\r\neducation, water and food.\r\nThe second pillar is “poverty reduction through\r\neconomic growth”. Without economic growth, poverty\r\ncannot be reduced sustainably. In particular, Japan has\r\nbeen placing strong emphasis on cooperation to\r\nimprove agricultural productivity because agriculture is\r\nthe backbone of African economies. The establishment\r\nof the New Rice for Africa initiative is among the\r\nsuccessful examples of Japan’s efforts.\r\nInfrastructure is also essential for economic\r\ndevelopment. Japan places emphasis on such areas as\r\ntransportation, communication, energy, and water. In\r\nthe area of trade and investment, Japan will promote\r\ninvestment in Africa by Japanese companies through\r\nmeasures such as overseas investment loans, with a\r\ntarget of approximately $300 million in loans over five\r\nyears.\r\nThe third pillar is “consolidation of peace”. While\r\nthe progress that has been made in the peace process in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra\r\nLeone, for example, is encouraging, the prevalence of\r\nunresolved conflicts and residual causes of conflict in\r\nAfrica is of grave concern to all of us. We welcome in\r\nthis connection the initiative taken by regional and\r\nsubregional organizations, including the African Union\r\nand the Economic Community of West African States,\r\nto address the conflicts in these countries. Africa’s own\r\nwill and determination, which were crystallized by\r\nNEPAD, are indeed the key to tackling conflicts in\r\nAfrica in the future.\r\nMy Government believes at the same time that\r\nemergency measures alone taken vis-à-vis these\r\nconflicts will not make for lasting peace in Africa but\r\nmust be accompanied by the post-conflict peace\r\nprocess, domestic security, and humanitarian and\r\nreconstruction assistance — three elements which are\r\nindispensable to the consolidation of peace. We in the\r\ninternational community must therefore encourage and\r\nsupport the efforts of African countries in these areas.\r\nThe Government of Japan, for its part, has contributed\r\nto such efforts in various fields, and we will continue\r\nto actively support the activities of African regional\r\nand subregional organizations in the areas of conflict\r\nprevention, management and resolution.\r\nAmbassador Haraguchi became one of the\r\nmembers of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Burundi, at\r\nthe request of Ambassador Nteturuye of Burundi. We\r\nare pleased to be able to participate in the Advisory\r\nGroup and would like to work with other members of\r\nthe Group in order to prepare recommendations for a\r\nlong-term programme of support for Burundi. It also\r\ngives my Government a good opportunity to\r\naccumulate knowledge of and experience in the post-\r\nconflict development of African countries.\r\nJapan wishes to engage in further dialogue with\r\nits African partners in order to address the question of\r\nhow the people of Africa can free themselves from\r\nthreats against their lives and human dignity, such as\r\nthose posed by poverty, conflict and infectious disease.\r\nJapan, in other words, would like to contribute to\r\nAfrica’s quest for human security and its desire to\r\nrealize a society in which people can live with hope in\r\ntheir hearts instead of despair.\r\nMr. Kazemi Kamyab (Islamic Republic of Iran):\r\nIt is indeed very opportune for the General Assembly\r\nto consider how to support the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). The reality of the\r\nsituation faced by many millions of people in Africa\r\nonly calls for a real, serious and comprehensive\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\napproach, as well as a policy and action on a scale, with,\r\nand of a magnitude, commensurate with the situation\r\nitself. Let me seize this opportunity to reiterate my\r\ncountry’s full solidarity with African countries, all of\r\nwhich without fail belong to the developing family. My\r\ncountry currently has an active diplomatic presence in\r\nmost African countries, and they, in turn, have\r\nstrengthened their diplomatic presence in Tehran.\r\nWith determination and cooperation, we have\r\nbeen able to contribute to a large number of projects\r\nand reconstruction plans in many African countries.\r\nThe cordial and close cooperation of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran with the countries of the continent is\r\non the rise, both in the bilateral field and on the\r\ninternational scene. Nonetheless, and perhaps because\r\nof often time-consuming bottlenecks and the lack of\r\nnecessary infrastructure, economic ties have not been\r\nprogressing on an equal footing with political relations.\r\nOf course, with determination and mutual cooperation,\r\nwe have been able to contribute to many projects and\r\nreconstruction plans in many African countries.\r\nBuilding infrastructure, constructing hospitals\r\nand health clinics and cooperation in the academic and\r\nscientific fields are but some of very general topics\r\nunder which we have contributed to the development of\r\nthe poorer areas of the continent. Given the\r\nvulnerability of the continent to many natural disasters,\r\nmy country has provided financial and humanitarian\r\nassistance that almost always includes grants.\r\nFurthermore, in order to promote and facilitate\r\neconomic and commercial relations, my Government\r\nhas allocated a line of credit of $200 million for Africa.\r\nThe credit ceiling shall be decided on the basis of\r\nmutual banking agreements.\r\nThe African renaissance, the rebirth we have all\r\nbeen talking about in recent years, can only be initiated\r\nand undertaken in all earnestness by Africans\r\nthemselves and by African countries individually and\r\ncollectively. NEPAD has embodied all of those\r\nelements. There is, of course, a role for others in the\r\ninternational community, including the United Nations.\r\nAs far as the United Nations system is concerned, it\r\nshould undertake to integrate all its various plans,\r\nprogrammes and initiatives into a comprehensive\r\npolicy framework, comprising all political, economic\r\nand social components and having clear and well-\r\ndefined roles and mandates for the relevant executing\r\nagencies and departments. Yes, there is a way forward\r\nfor Africa. Let us all start moving down that road.\r\nMr. Talbot (Guyana): As we have done on many\r\noccasions in times past, Guyana is pleased once again\r\nto stand in solidarity with Africa, a continent with\r\nwhich we share not only lasting ties of history and\r\nculture but also common aspirations for durable peace\r\nand sustainable development for our peoples. My\r\ndelegation applauds the initiative of African leaders to\r\nfashion a new partnership for development on the\r\ncontinent within a framework of democratic governance.\r\nToday, as we review the progress made in the\r\nimplementation of, and international support for, the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), our task\r\nis greatly facilitated by the Secretary-General’s reports\r\ncontained in documents A/58/254 and A/58/352. The\r\nreports provide an enlightening survey of the progress\r\nmade, as well as the challenges and constraints\r\nencountered. My delegation wishes to place on record\r\nits gratitude to the Secretary-General for his reports, as\r\nwell as its appreciation for his efforts, and those of the\r\nentire United Nations system, in support of NEPAD.\r\nGuyana views the New Partnership as a positive\r\nagenda for action, not only by and among African\r\ncountries themselves as the primary actors, but also as\r\none to be embraced by the entire international community.\r\nWe are heartened by the commitment that the countries of\r\nAfrica have demonstrated to integrating the priorities of\r\nNEPAD into their national policies and development\r\nplanning frameworks. Guyana holds the view that\r\nownership and leadership of the NEPAD process by\r\nAfricans is indispensable to the achievement of the\r\nobjectives of the New Partnership. In that context, my\r\ndelegation welcomes the establishment of the African\r\nPeer Review Mechanism and the increasing accession\r\nof countries to the Mechanism.\r\nAlso to be welcomed and supported are the\r\nefforts of the African Union to consolidate democracy\r\non the continent and strengthen regional mechanisms\r\nfor conflict prevention, resolution and management.\r\nThe hopeful results in Liberia, Burundi and Sao Tome\r\nand Principe are testimonies to both the leadership\r\nshown by Africa in addressing problems within its\r\ndomain and to the growing partnership between\r\nregional organizations on the continent and the United\r\nNations. We welcome that development.\r\nWe look forward to the entry into force of the\r\nprotocol to establish the Pan-African Parliament to\r\nensure the effective and full participation of African\r\npeoples in the development and integration of the\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\ncontinent, as well as the Protocol relating to the\r\nestablishment of the Peace and Security Council of the\r\nAfrican Union. Efforts being made to reorient the\r\nactivities of regional communities to reflect the\r\npriorities of NEPAD can contribute in a meaningful\r\nway to the operationalization of those priorities\r\nthroughout the continent as a whole.\r\nNotwithstanding the positive developments to\r\nwhich I have referred, Africa continues to face formidable\r\nchallenges in its pursuit of peace and development. The\r\nSecretary-General has drawn attention to several of\r\nthose challenges as they pertain to sectors such as\r\nagriculture and food security, health — in particular the\r\ncrisis caused by HIV/AIDS — and education. No less\r\ndaunting are the challenges posed by conflict and\r\ninstability. Those challenges need to be seriously\r\naddressed if the continent is to have any chance of\r\nattaining the objectives of the New Partnership.\r\nWe also note that the implementation of NEPAD\r\nis constrained by a number of shortcomings, not least\r\nin the implementation machinery itself. In addition, the\r\nSecretary-General also highlights weak institutional\r\ncapacity at the national and regional levels, insufficient\r\npopularizing of NEPAD at the country level and\r\nfunding inadequacies. In our view, those represent\r\nopportunities for further cooperation and support from\r\nthe international community.\r\nWhile these challenges and constraints can be\r\novercome, it is clear that doing so will require renewed\r\nefforts by the international community to honour its\r\ncommitments to NEPAD. Concrete actions with respect\r\nto the provision of official development assistance,\r\ndebt relief for Africa, market access for African\r\nproducts, redressing the deterioration of terms of trade\r\nfor commodity producers and assistance in enabling the\r\ncontinent to attract foreign direct investment remain\r\nessential in that regard, with special responsibility\r\ndevolving on developed country partners. My delegation\r\nis appreciative of the positive developments referred to\r\nby the Secretary-General on that front, and we call for\r\nintensified efforts in support of NEPAD. Equally\r\nimportant is for such efforts to assure a degree of\r\nsustainability in the gains achieved wherever possible.\r\nMy delegation is also of the view that South-\r\nSouth cooperation, including triangular cooperation\r\ninitiatives, forms an integral and complementary part\r\nof the international response to NEPAD. In that regard,\r\nwe note with appreciation the Secretary-General’s\r\nacknowledgement of the contribution made by countries\r\nof the Latin America and the Caribbean region, among\r\nothers, in the area of capacity building. At the level of\r\nthe Caribbean Community, a number of cooperation\r\ninitiatives have been undertaken with countries and\r\ninstitutions in Africa, including at the level of our\r\nrespective secretariats. We look forward to continued\r\ncooperation in that regard, including the strengthening\r\nof our relationship with the continent in the context of\r\nthe group of African, Caribbean and Pacific States. My\r\nown country, Guyana, is in the process of reviewing that\r\nrelationship with a view to strengthening cooperation\r\narrangements with several African countries.\r\nI wish to conclude by renewing my delegation’s\r\ncommitment to lending every possible support that our\r\nlimited resources will permit to the cause of Africa’s\r\nrenaissance.\r\nMr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): The delegation of\r\nAngola would like to thank the Secretary-General for\r\nhis comprehensive report contained in document\r\nA/58/254, entitled “The New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment: first consolidated report on progress in\r\nimplementation and international support”. It is our\r\nview that that report provides useful insight into the\r\nprogress of implementation with regard to the relevant\r\nagenda item.\r\nResolution 57/2, which was adopted at the\r\nprevious session, welcomed the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) as an African\r\ninitiative that would be supported by the international\r\ncommunity at large. The subsequent steps taken by the\r\nUnited Nations, and particularly the adoption of\r\nresolution 57/7, on 4 November 2002, gave special\r\nmomentum to that process. It is that process and\r\nimpulse that African countries had been expecting for a\r\nconsiderable time.\r\nDespite providing us with important information\r\non the actions taken thus far, the report nevertheless\r\nclearly recognizes that de facto results are far from\r\nbeing achieved.\r\nAngola recognizes and commends the relentless\r\nwork that the United Nations has undertaken with\r\nregard to the implementation of NEPAD. We welcome\r\nthe establishment of the Office of the Special Adviser\r\non Africa, which is currently chaired by our good\r\nfriend and friend of my country, Mr. Ibrahim Gambari.\r\nWe hope that the Office will be well provided with\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nadequate financial and human resources in order to\r\ncarry out its mandate promptly and efficiently.\r\nWe also commend other United Nations agencies\r\nfor their collaboration and support for activities that\r\nprioritize the implementation of NEPAD. We would\r\nespecially like to thank the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme for supporting NEPAD’s\r\nsecretariat in the elaboration of its five-year\r\nprogramme of work. The involvement of the Economic\r\nCommission for Africa in fine-tuning the African Peer\r\nReview Mechanism also constitutes an important step\r\nin the establishment of an institutional framework for\r\nmutual accountability and policy coherence in Africa.\r\nIn the view of our delegation, the cluster approach to\r\ndeal with that matter constitutes an excellent\r\nmechanism to keep the coordination of agencies’\r\nefforts alive in their treatment of NEPAD.\r\nIn the chapter entitled “Challenges and\r\nconstraints”, the report sheds some light on the\r\ndifficulties that African countries will face in order to\r\nmeet the minimum goals set forth in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. The report states plainly that\r\n“Total official development assistance to Africa is\r\nmodest in comparison with the huge agricultural\r\nsubsidies paid to farmers in the developed\r\ncountries. Furthermore, the subsidies depress\r\ncommodities prices, hindering Africa’s ability to\r\nincrease exports and escape from poverty and\r\ndependence on aid.” (A/58/254, para. 36)\r\nThat is an old and well-known problem that the\r\ninternational community, and developed countries in\r\nparticular, need to address.\r\nAngola is working on a new poverty-reduction\r\nstrategy paper aimed at improving the macro-economic\r\nframework and structural and social policies to foster\r\ngrowth and reduce poverty. The Ministry of Planning in\r\nmy country is the focal point for matters regarding the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD at the national level. The\r\nMinistry is sparing no efforts in its commitment to honour\r\nits responsibilities when it comes to implementation.\r\nAngola stands ready to continue its participation in\r\nregional and subregional programmes — such as\r\nProject Link — that will enhance the capacity of\r\nAfrican countries to better respond to the challenges\r\nfacing NEPAD. We support the recommendations\r\ncontained in the report of the Secretary-General, and\r\nwe will work closely with all partners in order to bring\r\ncomplete success to NEPAD.\r\nAfrica is known as a continent of vast beauty,\r\ndeep history and rich culture. Africa is, however, a land\r\nthat continues to struggle with famine, poverty, debt,\r\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic, malaria and tuberculosis —\r\ntragedies that have claimed the lives of millions of\r\npeople. Armed conflicts constitute the other major cause\r\nof death in our continent. We are therefore deeply\r\ncommitted to finding adequate solutions to existing\r\nconflicts. We are particularly committed to creating the\r\nconditions necessary to avert the situation that Mr.\r\nLeonardo Santos Simão, Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nCooperation of Mozambique — which currently chairs\r\nthe African Union — referred to when he said that\r\n“there are no new conflicts on our continent, and\r\neven those that now exist are a combination of\r\neither old conflicts that have not been resolved\r\nproperly or seemingly new ones that can be\r\ntraced back to the old ones.” (supra)\r\nThe recommendations contained in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report provide a clear assessment of the\r\nproblems and constraints that the majority of the\r\ncountries of Africa are still facing five years after the\r\npublication of the Secretary-General’s first assessment\r\non the causes of conflict in Africa. We would\r\nespecially like to refer to recommendation 57 of the\r\nimplementation matrix, which demands more effective\r\nharmonization of bilateral and international initiatives.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report on this matter also\r\npoints out the need for a more refined reporting\r\nmechanism. Angola is of the view that the provision\r\ncontained in resolution 57/296 — which pertains to the\r\ninclusion of a sub-item entitled “Causes of conflict and\r\nthe promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa” under a single agenda on the\r\ndevelopment of Africa, entitled “New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development: progress in implementation and\r\ninternational support”, beginning at the fifty-eighth\r\nsession — constitutes the best solution and should be\r\nwelcomed. But we need to do much more than just\r\nreporting. Effective and coordinated action by the\r\ninternational community is needed. NEPAD offers us a\r\nsound opportunity to act together.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Barely a year ago, we held a special high-\r\nlevel session of the General Assembly on the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). On\r\nthat occasion, the international community expressed\r\nits full support for that initiative aimed at achieving\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\nAfrica’s sustainable development. Nevertheless, that\r\nmuch-heralded support has in fact been scarce, and it\r\nhas not achieved tangible results.\r\nThe situation in Africa is increasingly critical.\r\nHalf of African’s population lives in extreme poverty,\r\nand one third suffers from starvation. One out of six\r\nchildren dies before the age of five, and 3.6 million\r\nchildren are born underweight. The enrolment rate for\r\nelementary education is at 57 per cent, and only one\r\nout of every 3 children finishes primary school. Life\r\nexpectancy at birth in sub-Saharan Africa is barely 48\r\nyears of age. Out of the 42 million people infected with\r\nHIV/AIDS, 70 per cent live in sub-Saharan Africa and\r\nhave no access to the medicines and treatments needed\r\nto fight the virus, avoid other diseases and ease pain.\r\nAge-old diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and\r\nother equally deadly ailments have not been overcome.\r\nOnly 48 per cent of the population has access to\r\ndrinking water. Of Africa’s population over the age of\r\n15, 37.6 per cent are illiterate. Millions of people do\r\nnot have access to electricity, let alone to a telephone\r\nline. There are only 15 telephone lines per 1,000\r\npeople in Africa; whereas in industrialized countries,\r\nwhich account for 15 per cent of the world’s\r\npopulation, there are 592 telephone lines for every\r\n1,000 inhabitants.\r\nCurrent international economic relations, which\r\nare characterized by the inequalities imposed by the\r\nneo-liberal globalization process, leave Africa at a total\r\ndisadvantage. How can it be said that the globalization\r\nprocess is inclusive and offers opportunities and\r\nbenefits for all when Africa, which comprises 18.5 per\r\ncent of the world’s population and has the largest\r\nnatural resource reserves in the world, accounts for\r\nonly 1 per cent of gross domestic product and 2 per\r\ncent of the world’s trade? Is it a coincidence that 34 of\r\nthe 49 least developed countries are in Africa? Is it a\r\ncoincidence that 34 out of the 42 heavily indebted poor\r\ncountries are in Africa? It is obvious that the current\r\nunjust and unsustainable international order continues\r\nto plunder Africa as a basic source of wealth without\r\nbringing it economic development. Africa continues to\r\nbe a net exporter of capital that exports wealth in\r\nexcess of the aid and financing it receives.\r\nMoreover, due to those reasons and because of\r\nthe consequences of colonial partition, there are today\r\nmore armed conflicts in Africa than in any other\r\ncontinent. That poses a significant challenge to meeting\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, as it has\r\ndevastating effects on the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of the region. Africa’s wisdom deserves\r\nrespect. Africa does not need more advice or recipes to\r\nsolve its conflicts; it needs financial resources. Despite\r\nwhat is said in debates and affirmed in numerous\r\nresolutions, emphasis continues to be on reacting to\r\nconflicts in Africa instead of on preventing them and\r\neliminating their causes.\r\nVarious initiatives and proposals related to Africa\r\ncontinue to proliferate at the United Nations, but there\r\nis still a lack of political will and altruism on the part\r\nof former colonial Powers, as well as a comprehensive\r\napproach to solve problems related to peace, security\r\nand development on the continent. Neither is there a\r\nmechanism at the United Nations that makes it possible\r\nto periodically and efficiently monitor the fulfilment of\r\nwhat is agreed.\r\nAfrica cannot continue to wait. International\r\ncooperation is inescapable, and it is urgently needed.\r\nThe peoples of Africa need the support of the\r\ninternational community, for the resources at their\r\ndisposal are insufficient and have to be devoted to\r\npaying for both their external debt and development.\r\nAfrica today spends four times as much on servicing its\r\nforeign debt than it does on education and health\r\ncombined. A small increase in the official development\r\nassistance that has been provided to Africa this year\r\nwith many conditions; debt relief or cancellation\r\ninitiatives; promises to promote foreign investment and\r\npronouncements regarding reducing agricultural\r\nsubsidies, which boost agricultural production and\r\nexports, continue to be insufficient measures\r\namounting to ridiculous sums when compared to the\r\ncontinent’s needs.\r\nAfrican countries urgently require — without\r\ninterference and conditions — special and differential\r\ntreatment, access to markets, stability in commodity\r\nprices, foreign debt cancellation, access to technology,\r\na substantive increase in official development\r\nassistance and the necessary financial resources.\r\nCuba is a country with limited resources that has\r\nbeen subjected to a fierce economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial blockade for over four decades. That\r\nblockade has been strengthened during the last year,\r\nand its extraterritorial implementation has been\r\nexpanded. In the spirit of solidarity, Cuba continues to\r\nextend its altruistic and disinterested cooperation to\r\nAfrican countries. As an illustration of what can be\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.32\r\naccomplished with political will and cooperation that is\r\nboth disinterested and based on solidarity, I would like\r\nto refer to the fact that, between 1963 and 2002, over\r\n83,000 Cubans provided technical assistance in Africa\r\nin the areas of health, agriculture, education and sports,\r\namong others. By the end of 2002, 2,340 Cuban\r\ncollaborators were providing technical assistance in 27\r\nAfrican countries. During the same period, over 5,000\r\nof our African brothers and sisters received technical\r\ntraining in various technical fields in our country.\r\nA comprehensive health programme that has been\r\ndeveloped since 1998 is the most current example of\r\nCuban cooperation with Africa. Through that\r\nprogramme, Cuban health care professionals and\r\ntechnicians working exclusively in the area of primary\r\ncare are providing their services free of charge to\r\npeople living in rural areas. That programme also\r\ncontributes to training the human resources of\r\nreceiving countries, to developing HIV/AIDS\r\nprevention programmes and to offering technical\r\nadvice. By the beginning of 2003, 1,148 Cubans were\r\nworking in the programme in 13 African countries.\r\nI would like once again to reiterate my country’s\r\noffer to help the brotherly peoples of Africa in the\r\nstruggle against the AIDS pandemic by sending an\r\nadditional 4,000 doctors and health professional to\r\ncreate, free of charge, the infrastructure required to\r\nprovide the population with the essential medicines,\r\ndiagnoses, medical advice and follow-up. That\r\npersonnel would also assist in training human\r\nresources. Cuba is also offering professors to establish\r\nmedical school faculties and qualified staff to provide\r\nadvice and to work in campaigns aimed at preventing\r\nAIDS and other diseases. I also wish to reiterate our\r\nwillingness to donate antiretroviral therapy for 30,000\r\npatients per year.\r\nWe should take action on an urgent basis, or the\r\nmodest Development Goals outlined by the Millennium\r\nDeclaration will be but an illusion for the peoples of\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
