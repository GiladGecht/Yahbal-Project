(Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 39 (continued)\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress\r\nin implementation and international support\r\n(a) New Partnership for Africa’s Development:\r\nprogress in implementation and international\r\nsupport\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/254)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General on proposed\r\nrevisions to programme 8 of the medium-term\r\nplan for the period 2002-2005: United Nations\r\nsupport for the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (A/58/83)\r\nReport of the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination (A/58/16, chapter III, section B,\r\nprogramme 8; chapter IV, section B)\r\n(b) Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/352)\r\nMr. Kamanzi (Rwanda): In my capacity as\r\nChairman of the African Group, I would like to express\r\nwarm congratulations to you, Mr. President. The\r\nAfrican Group commends your invaluable input in\r\nguiding the deliberations of this session. In the same\r\nvein, we warmly congratulate all the members of the\r\nBureau for their election and reaffirm our support to\r\nthem. Let me also express my full subscription to the\r\nstatement made yesterday by The Honourable\r\nLeonardo Santos Simão, Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nand Cooperation of the Republic of Mozambique, on\r\nbehalf of the Chairman of the African Union, as well as\r\nto the statement made by Mr. Mohammed Bennouna on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nAfrica welcomes the decision of the General\r\nAssembly to hold a debate on Africa’s development.\r\nThis is particularly important given the rapidly\r\nchanging situation in the world, globalization and\r\nregional conflicts, and their impact on development in\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe African continent today is confronted with an\r\nurgent need to find enduring solutions to the diverse\r\ndevelopment problems facing it, of which conflict is an\r\nintegral part. Africa welcomes the interest of the\r\ninternational community in the development of Africa,\r\nas expressed in its acceptance of the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and the initiatives\r\non the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and development in Africa. In this connection,\r\nwe welcome the report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/58/254) on the New Partnership and the progress\r\nreport on the causes of conflict and the promotion of\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa.\r\nWe have noted the progress in and the constraints\r\non the implementation of both programmes. We\r\ncommend the efforts of the international community\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nwith regard to certain initiatives and actions that have\r\nbeen taken with regard to both programmes. Those\r\nefforts could lead to significant development and\r\nconflict prevention on the continent in the future if they\r\nare adequately consolidated. We have noted, however,\r\nthe prevalence of some constraints that should be\r\neliminated in a timely manner in order to ensure that\r\nthe goals of both programmes are attained.\r\nI would like here to emphasize again that African\r\ncountries are committed to the effective\r\nimplementation of NEPAD. That commitment was\r\ndemonstrated in their Declaration on the\r\nimplementation of the programme at the July 2003\r\nMaputo Summit of Heads of State or Government,\r\nwhich, among other things, called on the international\r\ncommunity to continue its support and on the\r\nImplementation Committee of the heads of State or\r\nGovernment to further intensify its efforts to engage\r\ndevelopment partners for cooperation. African\r\nGovernments have taken major actions on the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD, and in this respect we\r\nwelcome the support of the Group of Eight and other\r\npartnership structures, including the Third Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development,\r\nheld two weeks ago in Japan.\r\nFurthermore, given the relevance of peace and\r\nsecurity to sustainable economic growth and\r\ndevelopment, the Assembly of the African Union, in\r\ndecision Assembly/AU/Dec.16 (II) on the\r\noperationalization of the Protocol relating to the\r\nEstablishment of the Peace and Security Council — the\r\nconflict prevention, management and resolution\r\nbody — called on all countries that have not yet done\r\nso to speed up the process of signing and ratifying that\r\nProtocol.\r\nWe would like to acknowledge the significant\r\nsupport that Africa has received from its development\r\npartners in the past in its conflict prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution efforts. We call on the\r\ninternational community to continue its support,\r\nespecially for those countries emerging from conflict,\r\nin order to put those countries on the path of\r\nsustainable economic growth and development.\r\nAs we gather here today, however, it is well\r\nknown that Africa’s progress in its development efforts\r\nremains far below the normal threshold. This was\r\nillustrated in the recent World Bank appraisal of the\r\nglobal implementation of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. African countries have embarked upon a process\r\nof promoting and strengthening democracy. They have\r\nacknowledged the need for a peer review mechanism as\r\nuseful barometer for political and economic\r\nperformance and the rejuvenation of development.\r\nThey have embraced the values of the market economy\r\nand are engaged in the consolidation of sound\r\nmacroeconomic policies for sustainable economic\r\ngrowth and development. But, it has been noted that\r\nthe critical constraints in the implementation of\r\nNEPAD are largely to be found in the international\r\nenvironment. This is the time for a supportive\r\ninternational environment for projects on health,\r\neducation, infrastructure and agriculture, which are\r\nfundamental to development and poverty alleviation.\r\nThe successful implementation of NEPAD will, in\r\nour view, depend on further positive changes in attitude\r\non the part of our development partners with regard to\r\nthe flow of official development assistance. We\r\nwelcome the slight improvement in official\r\ndevelopment assistance to Africa in the past two years.\r\nMost of the official development assistance flows are\r\ncurrently being directed to the areas of health and\r\neducation, where assistance is urgently needed.\r\nThat increase, however, still falls far short of the\r\nofficial development assistance that African countries\r\nrequire if they are to effectively resolve the\r\nfundamental problems associated with sustainable\r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication. There is a need\r\nfor those countries that have not done so to fulfil their\r\nobligations to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross\r\nnational product as official development assistance to\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nUltimately, the capacity of African countries to\r\nimplement projects in NEPAD will depend on their\r\nability to earn more foreign exchange through the\r\nexpansion of foreign trade. The outcome of the Cancún\r\nMinisterial Conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganization was disappointing for African countries.\r\nThere is a need for genuine cooperation on the part of\r\nour development partners with regard to the removal of\r\nthe huge subsidies and tariff barriers on export\r\nproducts of African countries seeking to enter the\r\nmarkets of developed countries.\r\nFurthermore, there is concern with regard to the\r\ninstability of commodity prices, which affects the\r\nearnings of African countries. The cooperation of\r\ndevelopment partners on these issues is critical to the\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nstabilization of economic growth and development\r\nprocesses in African countries.\r\nIn spite of the efforts of African countries to\r\nimprove the investment environment through the\r\npromotion of democracy and good governance and the\r\nimplementation of sound macroeconomic policies, they\r\nhave failed to attract foreign direct investment. I would\r\nlike to reiterate here that the challenges of development\r\nare enormous in the areas of infrastructure,\r\nindustrialization and agricultural development in\r\nAfrica. The current limited savings of African\r\ncountries can only result in limited investment and\r\nslow growth. We therefore call on our development\r\npartners to strengthen their political will and encourage\r\ntheir private sectors to adequately complement national\r\nefforts with regard to investment.\r\nProgress on the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\r\nDebt (HIPC) Initiative remains unsatisfactory, given\r\nthe fact that many heavily indebted countries are slow\r\nto secure the desired relief. There are problems in the\r\nareas of conditionalities and the prompt redemption of\r\npledges to the Trust Fund. Furthermore, some countries\r\nare experiencing difficulties in the preparation of\r\nPoverty Reduction Strategy Papers. We urge our\r\ndevelopment partners to resolve those problems so that\r\nresources for development in African countries can be\r\nreleased.\r\nWe have noted with appreciation the rapid\r\nintegration of NEPAD into the programmes of the\r\nvarious agencies, programmes, funds and organizations\r\nof the United Nations. We also welcome their growing\r\ncollaboration on this matter and encourage greater\r\ncoherence and coordination so as to ensure that\r\navailable resources produce optimum results in\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nMr. Savua (Fiji): Fiji thanks the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s for his consolidated report and endorses its\r\nrecommendations on the United Nations Declaration on\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD). While it is still in its early days, we\r\ncommend and welcome the new actions, initiatives and\r\nmodalities that the African countries are using in\r\npursuit of the high ideals that underpin NEPAD.\r\nIt is an accepted fact that sound and sustainable\r\ndevelopment is attainable only with durable peace,\r\nconflict prevention and conflict mitigation. As this\r\ninternational family grows in wisdom and experience\r\nsome 50 years since it was born, violence and conflict\r\ncontinue to keep abreast of its development. We watch\r\nwith keen interest the progress of NEPAD, fully\r\nconfident that it will find a way out of the quagmire of\r\nwars and development rollbacks that have beleaguered\r\nAfrica and will arrive at a methodology to make\r\nNEPAD a success. It is our hope that the emerging\r\nlessons can be applied and replicated in other regions.\r\nStructural and institutional strengthening,\r\nevidenced in the establishment of the African Union\r\nand its various regional economic communities, are\r\npositive responses by Africa to this United Nations\r\ndevelopment partnership arrangement.\r\nWe also welcome the establishment of the new\r\noffice of the Under-Secretary-General and Special\r\nAdviser on Africa, who is entrusted with the\r\nresponsibility of coordinating and guiding the\r\npreparation of Africa-related reports and to coordinate\r\nthe interdepartmental task force on Africa. This, we\r\nhope, will provide the necessary impetus to ensure that\r\ncoherence occurs on all African-related developments.\r\nNEPAD is of particular significance to\r\ndeveloping countries in the African, Caribbean and\r\nPacific Group of States (ACP), such as my own\r\ncountry, Fiji. Our sights are fixed on the development\r\nagenda using development concepts that can realize the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, which ultimately can\r\nimprove the livelihood of our people. Our goals are\r\nbased on the common vision that inspired the inception\r\nof the ACP three decades ago, which are the collective\r\naspirations for socio-economic advancement,\r\nprincipally in partnership with the European Union.\r\nWith market access as its substantive objective, the\r\ncurrent preferential arrangement under the 2000\r\nCotonou Agreement continues this form of\r\ndevelopment assistance to the ACP countries until\r\n2007. Clearly, more economic and development\r\npartnerships are needed today to match the changing\r\nlandscape. Geopolitical, economic and development\r\nimbalances, due primarily to the forces of globalization\r\nand trade liberalization, have served to entrench global\r\ndisparities, contrary to their good intentions.\r\nNEPAD offers Africa a new opportunity to\r\nrespond to these challenges and to deliver a carefully\r\ntargeted set of actions. The policy framework and\r\naspirations of NEPAD have to be liberating and self-\r\nsustaining. The United Nations must continue to be the\r\ncatalyst in the implementation of NEPAD, so that\r\nAfrica will control and feed its own development and\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\ngrowth mechanism, assisted by international\r\norganizations and institutions, the private sector and\r\nother international and regional mechanisms.\r\nStrengthening South-South cooperation will also\r\nnurture the linkages that NEPAD successes can trigger\r\nin other development- and resource-poor regions and\r\nsubregions.\r\nWe applaud those initiatives that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has listed that African countries are\r\nspearheading. We expect that the Peer Review\r\nMechanism will be fully embraced by the continent.\r\nWe are witnessing the rejuvenation through the Africa\r\nUnion of efforts to construct conflict prevention and\r\nmitigation mechanisms. Fiji can testify to the relevance\r\nof having regional-based conflict mitigation and\r\npreventative approaches as more ideal, if they can be\r\nassisted by the international community.\r\nThe failure at Cancún can be turned into a potent\r\nforce in addressing the current deepening shortcomings\r\nin international trade, if we can bring to fruition issues\r\nthat were close to settlement in that meeting of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization. This would invariably\r\nwould yield substantial benefits to developing\r\ncountries.\r\nIt is widely recognized today that progress is\r\nslow, particularly on the part of the developed\r\ncountries, in meeting the commitments they made at\r\nvarious United Nations conferences — especially at\r\nMonterrey, Doha and the Millennium Summit at\r\nHeadquarters — to place the interests of developing\r\ncountries at the centre of multilateral trade\r\nnegotiations. The failure of the Cancún Conference and\r\nthe cotton scandal reflect this trend of inconsistency,\r\nboth in the multilateral trade system and through other\r\nmultilateral institutions. In addition, more donor\r\nassistance from developed countries is needed in\r\nexternal debt relief and management to make huge and\r\nsignificant differences and to match the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations system to align its activities with\r\nNEPAD.\r\nIt is said that Cancun means snake pit. We hope\r\nthat it will not live up to its name, but, rather, that we\r\nwill recognize and settle the differences and move\r\nprogressively ahead. Our development programmes\r\nrely inextricably on trade for their sustainability. It is\r\nour fond hope that our international collective visions\r\ncan become clearer and allow transparency to be the\r\nbyword and give NEPAD the support it justly deserves.\r\nMr. Mustafa (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I wish to thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\nfor his detailed report on the progress made in the\r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and for international support\r\nfor it. I also wish to thank the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Mozambique, Chairman of the Executive\r\nCouncil of the African Union, for his statement made\r\nyesterday morning. We associate ourselves with the\r\nstatement made by the Permanent Representative of the\r\nKingdom of Morocco, on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina and with previous speakers who underscored the\r\nimportance of the NEPAD initiative, as the framework\r\nendorsed by the African continent and endorsed by the\r\nUnited Nations and donor countries to meet\r\ndevelopment challenges in Africa.\r\nIn its capacity as Chairman of the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development and the\r\nCommon Market for Southern and Eastern Africa,\r\nSudan has been adopting policies and measures that\r\nstrengthen and promote cooperation between the\r\ncountries of those bodies. Those policies are also in\r\nkeeping with the NEPAD goals of achieving peace,\r\ndevelopment and well-being for the people of the\r\ncontinent as a whole. To that end, we have held several\r\nspecialized conferences in the areas of economic\r\ncooperation, disarmament, fighting terrorism and in\r\naddressing the issues of displaced persons and\r\nrefugees. We believe that they have all contributed to\r\nachieving the NEPAD goals.\r\nThe gravity of the situation in the African\r\ncontinent and the determination of the Africans to\r\nemerge from the abyss of war and disease into the\r\narenas of progress and development are reflected in\r\nNEPAD through its objectives and attempts to achieve\r\nself-reliance, beginning with its serious work of facing\r\nAfrica’s problems, identifying their root causes and\r\ndeveloping informed specific plans to address them.\r\nHence, the determination of the international\r\ncommunity and the United Nations to support this\r\ninitiative, in order to push it forward and implement it.\r\nThe serious steps and measures taken by the African\r\nUnion and by a number of African countries in such a\r\nshort period, and the various degrees of progress\r\nachieved by NEPAD in its priority fields, is something\r\nthat calls for optimism, indeed.\r\nDespite the great difficulties and the suffering of\r\nmany African countries from repeated food crises,\r\nstarvation and poverty, the involvement of regional\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\neconomic groups to set up a plan for comprehensive\r\nagricultural development in Africa will enable us to\r\npinpoint the sources of risk and the main difficulties\r\nthat give rise to many other problems.\r\nThe challenges facing NEPAD impede the efforts\r\nmade by African countries towards its implementation.\r\nThe first requirement that will contribute to intensified\r\nefforts by the African countries, and the provision of a\r\nhigher level of resources and capabilities towards the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD, involves expanding the\r\nprocesses of debt cancellation, either at the bilateral or\r\nmultilateral level. This is in addition to the fact that\r\nfulfilment by the developed countries of their pledges\r\nmade during the various United Nations conferences\r\nand summits, especially the Millennium Summit and\r\nthe Monterrey Conference, and their offers of technical\r\nassistance and transfer of technology, are among the\r\nmost important elements for achieving further gains for\r\nAfrica and for all developing countries.\r\nMr. Rastam (Malaysia): My delegation\r\ncommends the Secretary-General for the two\r\ncomprehensive reports which are before us, namely on\r\nprogress in implementation and international support\r\nfor the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) and on causes of conflict and the promotion\r\nof durable peace and sustainable development in\r\nAfrica. Malaysia broadly supports the conclusions and\r\nrecommendations made in both reports.\r\nMalaysia associates itself with the statement\r\nmade by the Permanent Representative of Morocco, as\r\nChairman of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nMalaysia recognizes and welcomes the very\r\nimportant steps that have been taken by African leaders\r\nin the recent past. The establishment of NEPAD, an\r\ninitiative owned and led by Africans based on the\r\nprinciples of responsibility, solidarity and partnership,\r\nis particularly welcomed by Malaysia. We applaud the\r\nshared determination of African leaders to wrest\r\ncontrol of Africa’s future, to assume responsibility over\r\ntheir people’s development, as well as to fight hunger,\r\npoverty and disease and to ensure sustainable economic\r\nand social development on the continent.\r\nThe African countries have now taken action in\r\nkey areas, including health, education, food security\r\nand infrastructure, that are identified in NEPAD as\r\ncrucial to the development of the continent. We also\r\nwelcome the establishment of national focal points for\r\nNEPAD in several African countries which would\r\npromote cohesiveness, coherence and improved\r\ncoordination in the implementation of the policies and\r\nprogrammes under NEPAD.\r\nIn recognition of those steps, Malaysia joined\r\nother Non-Aligned Movement member countries at the\r\nthirteenth Conference of Heads of State or Government\r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement in Kuala Lumpur last\r\nFebruary to commend the establishment of NEPAD and\r\nsincerely support its full implementation. The\r\nMovement also commended the determination and\r\ncommitment of African leaders towards resolving\r\nconflicts on the continent and welcomed the transition\r\nof the Organization of African Unity to the African\r\nUnion two years ago. The transition clearly\r\ndemonstrates to the world the common vision among\r\nAfricans for a united and strong Africa that would\r\nenable the continent to take up the multifaceted\r\nchallenges confronting its peoples. At the same time\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement called on the United\r\nNations and the international community to support\r\nthose efforts.\r\nMalaysia supports initiatives to establish\r\nappropriate mechanisms for the prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts at both the\r\nregional and subregional levels in Africa, including the\r\nestablishment of the African Peer Review Mechanism.\r\nWe acknowledge the important contributions and roles\r\nof the African Union, the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States, the Economic Community of\r\nCentral African States, the Intergovernmental\r\nAuthority on Development and the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community in the promotion of peace,\r\nsecurity and development in different parts of Africa,\r\nincluding in the areas of preventive diplomacy and\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. Malaysia and the other\r\nNon-Aligned Movement countries have reaffirmed the\r\nexistence of an intrinsic link between peace and\r\ndevelopment, which demands an integrated approach to\r\nconflict prevention, resolution and management. The\r\nefforts undertaken by the countries of Africa in this\r\nregard should continue to be supported by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe note that the Secretary-General has continued\r\nhis practice of appointing special envoys and\r\nrepresentatives to prevent, mediate, contain and resolve\r\nconflicts in Africa. We welcome, in particular, the\r\nestablishment of the Office of the Special Adviser on\r\nAfrica, at the level of Under-Secretary-General. We\r\napplaud the efforts of the able and well-qualified\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nProfessor Ibrahim Gambari. This notwithstanding, we\r\nbelieve that our brothers in Africa can do more in the\r\narea of conflict resolution.\r\nWe support the Secretary-General’s call for\r\npolitical will and resolve among African leaders,\r\nincluding to develop an adequate African capacity for\r\nconflict resolution in order to achieve a durable\r\nsolution to the numerous conflicts besieging the\r\ncontinent. Political stability and good governance are\r\ncrucial in ensuring the success of NEPAD. Malaysia\r\nwill do its utmost to assist as a friend of Africa as well\r\nas in its capacity as current Chairman of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement.\r\nThe challenges facing Africa are numerous and\r\nmultifaceted and must be boldly confronted in a\r\nconcerted, comprehensive and coordinated manner. The\r\nchallenges of eradicating poverty and hunger, ensuring\r\nfood security, reversing the vicious cycle of debt,\r\ntackling underdevelopment and eliminating the threat\r\nof communicable diseases, such as HIV/AIDS,\r\ntuberculosis and malaria, require an enormous effort,\r\nnot only on the part of Africans but also the\r\ninternational community as a whole. The increasingly\r\nheavier burden of unsustainable debt payments,\r\ninsufficient and sluggish flow of foreign direct\r\ninvestment and official development aid, as well as the\r\nlack of humanitarian assistance, continue to hamper the\r\naccomplishment of the desired long-term development\r\ngoals of the majority of African countries. The wanton\r\nloss of life and destruction of infrastructure, and the\r\nconsequent displacement of millions of people from\r\ntheir homes following the numerous conflicts and wars\r\non the continent, also require urgent attention and\r\nadequate means in order to be resolved.\r\nI join other speakers before me in calling on the\r\ninternational community, in particular the developed\r\ncountries and the international financial institutions, to\r\nincrease their official development assistance\r\ncontributions and other forms of assistance to Africa in\r\nsupport of the continent’s efforts towards consolidating\r\npeace, pursuing sustainable development, promoting\r\ngood governance and human rights, reducing poverty\r\nand hunger and fighting disease.\r\nThe increase in official development assistance to\r\nAfrica from $17.73 billion in 2001 to $18.62 billion in\r\n2002 is a slightly positive development. That can\r\nsurely be increased substantially in years to come. The\r\nefforts undertaken by a few countries to address the\r\nproblem of the external indebtedness of the heavily\r\nindebted poor countries in Africa, including debt\r\ncancellation and other bilateral and multilateral\r\narrangements, are recognized and commended.\r\nWe note that Africa will require average annual\r\neconomic growth of 7 per cent if it is to reduce by half\r\nthe number of people living in poverty in the continent\r\nby 2015. That can be achieved only with the assistance\r\nof the developed countries, in terms of both financial\r\nresources and an increase in foreign investments. In\r\nthat regard, Malaysia will continue to support all\r\ninitiatives aimed at securing sustainable development\r\nin Africa. Malaysia participated as an observer at the\r\nrecent Third Tokyo International Conference on\r\nAfrican Development. This reflects our long-standing\r\ncommitment to that objective.\r\nMalaysia remains fully committed to the\r\npromotion of increased cooperation among developing\r\ncountries. In that spirit, we have extended our\r\ncooperation and assistance to, and shared our\r\nexperience, expertise and know-how with, developing\r\ncountries through the Malaysian Technical Cooperation\r\nProgramme. A total of 46 African countries have\r\nbenefited from the Programme since its inception. As\r\nof June 2003, approximately 2,000 participants from\r\nAfrica have attended Programme training courses in\r\nMalaysia in the fields of agriculture, human resources\r\nmanagement, information and communication\r\ntechnology and public administration. In addition, the\r\nMalaysian South-South Corporation, a private sector\r\nentity devoted to promoting South-South cooperation\r\nin the private sector, has also established a Malaysian\r\nbusiness centre in Kampala, Uganda, to further\r\nenhance and promote dialogue and linkages between\r\nthe corporate and private sector in Africa and\r\nMalaysia. The Asia-Africa Investment and Technology\r\nPromotion Centre has also been set up in Malaysia,\r\nwith the assistance of the Government of Japan, to\r\nfacilitate trade and investment between Asia and\r\nAfrica.\r\nMalaysia continues to look into various ways of\r\npromoting cooperation with Africa. In that regard, we\r\ncontinue to engage our African partners on ways and\r\nmeans to enhance cooperation and partnership at both\r\nthe governmental and private sector levels through the\r\nannual Langkawi International Dialogue and the\r\nSouthern Africa International Dialogue convened under\r\nthe auspices of the Commonwealth Partnership for\r\nTechnology Management.\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate Malaysia’s\r\ncommitment to cooperating with African countries in\r\ntheir collective efforts towards achieving peace and\r\nsustainable development. We value our traditional\r\nclose and friendly ties with Africa.\r\nMr. Mercado (Philippines): Allow me at the\r\noutset to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive update on the progress made in the\r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). My delegation associates itself\r\nwith the statement of Morocco on behalf of the Group\r\nof 77 and China.\r\nThe Philippine delegation welcomes the\r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/58/254) stressing the\r\ndecisions and follow-up actions at the national and the\r\nregional levels to achieve development for Africa\r\nunder the rubric of NEPAD — a comprehensive\r\nframework for the economic and political development\r\nof the African continent in cooperation with Africa’s\r\npartners.\r\nIt has often been emphasized that Africa’s\r\ndevelopment is crucial for global economic growth and\r\nsustainable development. Thus, the international\r\ncommunity’s support for the development of Africa is\r\ntantamount to assistance for all development-loving\r\nnations.\r\nI say this because the attainment of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, for instance, hinges\r\non how far and how successfully we can cooperate\r\ntogether to address lingering problems such as ensuring\r\npeace and security in the region and resolving poverty\r\nand sustainable development concerns including\r\nHIV/AIDS, malnutrition and others. Tackling those\r\nenormous problems in that big continent would help\r\ncontribute to the attainment of internationally agreed\r\ndevelopment objectives, including the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals call for\r\nreducing the poverty rate by half by 2015. However,\r\ninstead of pursuing economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, many countries are becoming poorer in\r\nboth relative and absolute terms. The Human\r\nDevelopment Report 2003 of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) indicates, for\r\ninstance, that 54 countries are poorer now than they\r\nwere in 1990 and that almost half of those countries are\r\nfound in Africa. Moreover, it would take some 50 years\r\nfor other countries to meet the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. That calls for renewed partnership\r\nand action to help Africa and the rest of the developing\r\ncountries. It behoves all of us to join together and\r\nextend our helping hands for the benefit of Africa.\r\nGovernance is an important tool for development.\r\nAlong this line, my delegation welcomes the African\r\nPeer Review Mechanism that has been put in place for\r\nassessing Africa’s political and economic performance.\r\nThe fact that African leaders have agreed to submit\r\nthemselves to a review mechanism involving their\r\npeers signifies their resolve, commitment and\r\ndetermination to ensure progress in their own\r\ndevelopment. We congratulate Africa on undertaking\r\nthis important and bold step, especially those countries\r\nthat will start submitting to the Mechanism by the end\r\nof 2003.\r\nWe also welcome Africa’s initiatives to\r\nconsolidate and strengthen the regional mechanisms for\r\nconflict prevention, resolution and management, as\r\nwell as initiatives at the subregional level in the field\r\nof infrastructure, agriculture, health and education,\r\namong others. We also laud the establishment of the\r\nPan-African Parliament and of national focal points for\r\nNEPAD. The creation of the Office of the Special\r\nAdviser to the Secretary-General on Africa augurs well\r\nfor the future of NEPAD.\r\nBut the biggest problem confronting Africa is the\r\nlack of sufficient resources. Indeed, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report emphasizes that the big challenge for\r\nAfrican countries in implementing NEPAD is the lack\r\nof financial resources. The mobilization of resources\r\nwell above existing levels, accompanied by appropriate\r\npolicies conducive to growth, is vital to ensuring\r\nadequate financing for economic and social\r\ndevelopment programmes in Africa.\r\nWe therefore call upon the international\r\ncommunity, especially the developed countries, to\r\nhonour the commitments made at major United Nations\r\nsummits and conferences, primarily with regard to\r\nproviding adequate contributions in the form of official\r\ndevelopment assistance, resolving debt problems and\r\nopening markets, in order to facilitate investment,\r\nsustain economic growth and attain the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals for Africa.\r\nRelations with Africa have always been a\r\nPhilippine foreign policy priority. In the past, the\r\nPhilippines actively participated in the international\r\ncommunity’s fight against apartheid in Africa. We also\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\njoin the rest of the world in the fight against the\r\nmodern-day apartheid in the region, the fight against\r\npoverty and the maintenance of peace and security.\r\nAs my President, Mrs. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo,\r\nsaid in her address before the Assembly two weeks ago\r\n(see A/58/PV.13), the Philippines has actively\r\ncontributed military and police personnel to United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations in Africa and other\r\nparts of the world over the past half century. This\r\nreflects President Arroyo’s conviction that peace is an\r\nindispensable condition for economic development,\r\njust as development is an essential component of peace,\r\nand that nothing will do more to lift us out of poverty\r\nthan peace itself. In line with that, we are now\r\npreparing to contribute Filipino soldiers to the United\r\nNations Mission in Liberia.\r\nMoreover, the Philippines stands ready to provide\r\ntechnical assistance to Africa, especially in field of\r\ncapacity-building. We reiterate our readiness to share\r\nour experiences, including our positive and progressive\r\nrecord of government partnerships with vital\r\nstakeholders, including the business sector and civil\r\nsociety.\r\nMr. Alexandre (Haiti), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nI mentioned earlier that assistance to Africa\r\nwould spark economic growth and development in\r\nmany parts of the globe. In light of increasing\r\nglobalization and interdependence, the burden is on us.\r\nIt bears repeating, therefore, that the support of the\r\ninternational community for the development of Africa\r\nwould benefit most countries in other parts of the\r\nworld. In the end, a prosperous Africa will lead to a\r\nprosperous world.\r\nMr. Tidjani (Cameroon) (spoke in French):\r\nAllow me at the outset to express my delegation’s\r\ngratitude for holding this debate on agenda item 39 (a),\r\nentitled New Partnership for Africa’s Development:\r\nprogress in the implementation and international\r\nsupport, and agenda item 39 (b), entitled Causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa. We are all the more\r\nsatisfied because holding this debate will help\r\nstreamline our work and highlight the links that exist\r\nbetween peace and development.\r\nPeace indeed is vital for development. In that\r\nregard, in preparing NEPAD, the heads of State of\r\nAfrica were mindful that poverty reduction and\r\nsustainable development stem from peace, democracy\r\nand the rule of law and that durable economic growth\r\ndepends on the implementation of better educational\r\nand health policies and the development of\r\ninfrastructure of the rural sector, a solid private sector\r\nand an environment favourable to foreign and\r\ninternational investment. They were also of the view\r\nthat international partnership, particularly through\r\nofficial development assistance, debt reduction and\r\naccess to capital markets, are all vital for Africa’s\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThese concerns are in keeping with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendations contained in his report on\r\nthe causes of conflict, issued in 1998, an evaluation of\r\nwhich has been submitted to the current session.\r\nWe have before us two progress reports —\r\nA/58/254 and A/58/352, which highlight the efforts\r\nmade by the African countries to ensure the success of\r\nNEPAD and the implementation of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendations on the causes of conflict,\r\nand which review the support of the international\r\ncommunity for these initiatives.\r\nIn the area of peace and security, the creation of\r\nthe Peer Review Mechanism attests to the commitment\r\nof African States to strengthen the foundations of\r\ndemocracy and respect for the rule of law. That\r\ncommitment has been confirmed by the current plan for\r\nthe creation in the African Union of a Peace and\r\nSecurity Council, which will help reinforce the\r\ncontinent’s capacities for peacekeeping and security.\r\nProgrammes of action in the strategic sectors of\r\nagriculture, infrastructure and the environment, at the\r\nnational, subregional and international levels, have\r\nbeen addressed, within the context of NEPAD, for the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nwhich have also been taken into account by NEPAD.\r\nHowever, the mobilized means to achieve those\r\ngoals, however significant they are, remain inadequate.\r\nA vigorous partnership and greater international\r\nsolidarity are also still required to achieve the NEPAD\r\nobjectives in particular and the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals in general. Within that context, the\r\ncommitments and appeals made at various international\r\nmeetings must be fulfilled and reaffirmed, particularly\r\nwith regard to official development assistance, trade,\r\ndebt reduction and infrastructure development.\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nOn the subject of official development assistance,\r\ndespite the slight increase, in constant terms it has\r\nremained below its 1990 levels. In that context, we\r\nwelcome the generosity of our partners in the area of\r\nofficial development assistance. We support\r\nparticularly the lifting of various trade barriers that\r\nimpede the export of African products. Such a measure\r\nwould lead to better development of African trade,\r\nwhich would support revitalized economic activity.\r\nWe also support the elimination of agricultural\r\nsubsidies that hamper the development efforts of\r\nAfrican countries. Moreover, we welcome the efforts\r\nmade thus far to resolve Africa’s debt problem. We\r\nnote that it is still an unbearable burden for our\r\ncountries, including those that have already benefited\r\nfrom the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.\r\nFor those reasons, my delegation maintains that the\r\nconvening of an international conference on Africa’s\r\ndebt will be an unparalleled opportunity for the\r\ninternational community to address this issue in a\r\nspecific and positive way.\r\nInfrastructure remains the key to Africa’s\r\ndevelopment. It requires significant financial\r\ninvestment, whose amount far exceeds the budgetary\r\ncapacity of most African countries. In that regard and\r\nin order to tackle this important challenge, the efforts\r\nof our partners to increase foreign direct investment\r\nwould be greatly appreciated.\r\nAs the reports emphasize, greater commitment on\r\nthe part of Africa and its partners is required to achieve\r\nNEPAD’s development objectives and the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Cameroon, as a member of the\r\nNEPAD steering committee, is involved in the Peer\r\nReview Mechanism and is fully prepared to work\r\nactively in achieving its goals and objectives. In order\r\nto do that, a member of the Government has been\r\nspecifically designated as a focal point for the follow-\r\nup to NEPAD issues.\r\nLet me conclude by thanking the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the excellent quality of the reports before\r\nus on this issue. My delegation also welcomes the\r\nestablishment of an Office of the Special Advisor on\r\nAfrica and hopes that it will be provided the financial\r\nand indispensable human resources to enable it to carry\r\nout its task.\r\nMr. Djangone-Bi (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Ivorian delegation congratulates\r\nMr. Julian Hunte on the organization of this debate on\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD). We would also like to take this opportunity\r\nto express our appreciation to the Secretary-General. In\r\naddition, my delegation associates itself with the\r\nstatement made earlier by Morocco on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nAfrica, which has taken charge of its own\r\ndevelopment through NEPAD, relies on the\r\ninternational community’s support for implementation\r\nof that instrument. In that regard, Côte d’Ivoire has\r\nwelcomed the commitments undertaken by the\r\ndeveloped countries. The outcomes of major\r\ninternational conferences — including the Monterrey\r\nConsensus reached at the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development; the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development; and the Doha Round —\r\nperfectly illustrate the will of the international\r\ncommunity to help Africa to decisively join the process\r\nof sustainable development.\r\nAt this stage, it will be necessary to assess\r\nprogress made in implementing commitments with\r\nregard to NEPAD by seeking ways to reduce every\r\nobstacle to fulfilment of those commitments. The first\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on progress in\r\nimplementation of NEPAD and on international support\r\n(A/58/254) details the progress achieved.\r\nAt the national level, NEPAD’s priorities are at\r\nthe heart of development policies. Anti-poverty\r\nstrategies have been formulated throughout Africa. At\r\nthe subregional level, economic cooperation is\r\nincreasingly becoming a reality. Political leaders and\r\neconomic actors are working together to attain the\r\nmajor objective of economic integration. In West\r\nAfrica, Côte d’Ivoire, for its part, continues to play its\r\nrole within subregional development bodies. At the\r\ncontinental level, NEPAD truly addresses the aspiration\r\nto build a major bloc that is economically viable and\r\ncapable of influencing international, political and\r\neconomic relations.\r\nToday, thanks to NEPAD, Africa — a continent\r\nbursting with potential — has truly taken charge of its\r\ndestiny in order to begin its sustainable development\r\nfor the well-being of its peoples. From that perspective,\r\nthe international community has shown solidarity by\r\nindicating its total support for NEPAD. It has also\r\ntaken a number of positive actions in the areas of\r\nofficial development assistance and debt alleviation or\r\ncancellation. The firm promises to eliminate subsidies\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nfor basic commodities also demonstrate the will of rich\r\ncountries to make international trade fair and more\r\ncompetitive.\r\nIn the light of that progress, Côte d’Ivoire, while\r\ncongratulating our development partners, urges them to\r\nundertake greater efforts to help African countries\r\nbreak out of the vicious circle of poverty. Fair\r\ncompensation for the work of their farmers must be\r\ncombined with increased official development\r\nassistance — which should reach 0.7 per cent of the\r\ngross national product of industrialized countries —\r\nand total debt forgiveness, so as to generate financial\r\nresources that can be devoted to health, education and\r\nother vital sectors of the economy. We must also\r\nconsider in depth the failure of Cancún and take\r\neffective measures to promote trade, the true engine of\r\ndevelopment. However, the noble objectives of\r\ndevelopment can flourish only if financial flows are\r\ncreated within a framework of good governance, peace\r\nand security. It is at that level that the donor countries\r\nexpect action from African countries, which must\r\nshoulder their responsibilities in order to earn the trust\r\nof their development partners.\r\nScarcity of financial resources and institutional\r\nand structural inadequacy are certainly serious\r\nhandicaps to Africa’s development, but it is the\r\nconflicts in Africa that could reduce to naught the\r\nfoundations of African economies. Those scourges\r\ntherefore require special attention from the\r\ninternational community — as does terrorism, which\r\nunfortunately continues to claim victims.\r\nMoreover, the General Assembly has rightly\r\ncalled for implementation of the recommendations\r\ncontained in the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa (A/58/352).\r\nIndeed, one must agree that peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment are intimately connected. Development\r\nwithout peace is a fantasy, and my country — which is\r\nexperiencing an unprecedented crisis characterized at\r\npresent by a situation of neither war nor peace —\r\nknows something about that. Conflicts with diverse\r\ncauses have harmful repercussions on economic and\r\nsocial development.\r\nCôte d’Ivoire encourages all peace initiatives\r\nbased on dialogue. It fully endorses the plan to\r\nformulate and adopt, within the framework of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States, a\r\ngeneral stabilization plan for the subregion that would\r\ncontribute to the restoration of lasting peace and\r\nstability in West Africa. Côte d’Ivoire believes that\r\npreventive action for peace must be carried out at\r\nseveral levels — diplomatic, socio-economic and\r\ncultural — because it is always better to prevent than to\r\ncure.\r\nIn Africa today, there are at least five United\r\nNations peacekeeping missions: the United Nations\r\nMission in Sierra Leone, the United Nations\r\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, the United Nations Mission in Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea and the United Nations Mission for the\r\nReferendum in Western Sahara. That is far too many\r\nfor a continent whose peoples ask for nothing except to\r\nlive in security and peace. Ultimately, the fight against\r\npoverty can be conducted effectively only if internal\r\nand external conditions are absolutely right. Therefore,\r\nCôte d’Ivoire calls for respect for the principles of\r\ngood governance and responsibility, as well as for\r\nsolidarity concerning effective implementation of the\r\noutcomes of the major international conferences, on\r\nwhich the success of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment will largely depend.\r\nMs. Knowles (Australia): Australia continues to\r\nstrongly support the articulation, through the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), of an\r\nAfrican vision for a new African future. By\r\nacknowledging that the primary responsibility for\r\nlifting Africa out of poverty lies with Africa itself,\r\nNEPAD is qualitatively different from past initiatives\r\ndesigned to foster development in Africa. Australia\r\nbelieves that NEPAD’s focus on good political and\r\neconomic governance, democracy, stability and market-\r\nled economic growth will bear the fruit of sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt is vital that those laudable principles be\r\nrealized through a real commitment by African\r\ncountries to their implementation and through support\r\nby the rest of the international community for this\r\nendeavour. We strongly commend the 16 countries that\r\nhave volunteered to be reviewed under the African Peer\r\nReview Mechanism. In addition to the useful national\r\nevaluations, the experiences and lessons learned in that\r\nprocess will assist other African countries facing the\r\nsame challenges.\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nNEPAD’s focus on securing and reaping the\r\nbenefits of further trade liberalization is clear-sighted,\r\nnecessary and welcome. Trade liberalization represents\r\none of the single most important steps that can be taken\r\nto help eradicate poverty and encourage sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Australia is a leading advocate of trade\r\nliberalization, particularly in the field of agriculture, a\r\nsector of special importance to African countries. We\r\nhave long advocated ending farm subsidies in\r\ndeveloped countries. Not only are those subsidies\r\nhugely expensive — more is spent on them than\r\nAfrica’s combined economic output — they are also\r\nhighly damaging to Africa’s development prospects.\r\nDespite the setback at Cancún, Australia will continue\r\nto work with developing country partners to create a\r\nfair international trading system in agricultural\r\nproducts, including in the Doha development round of\r\nnegotiations.\r\nAustralia will continue to support capacity\r\nbuilding for trade negotiators in Africa through\r\ntargeted interventions through the Africa Governance\r\nFund, and will increase funding for African regional\r\ntrade initiatives, especially in agriculture.\r\nAustralia recognizes the importance of\r\ndevelopment assistance programmes and will continue\r\nto play a constructive role in Africa. HIV/AIDS is a\r\nserious threat to development and will remain a major\r\nfocus of Australia’s development assistance\r\nprogramme for Africa. Australia’s other priorities —\r\npromoting good governance and education, including\r\nthrough the African Virtual University in Nairobi and\r\nefforts to bridge the digital divide — are also relevant\r\nto NEPAD priorities.\r\nBasic health and humanitarian support underpins\r\nall development. Since March 2002, Australia has\r\nprovided $A 43.5 million in food aid to people at risk\r\nof starvation in Africa. Mostly recently, on 8 October\r\n2003, Australia announced an additional $A 7.5 million\r\nto drought affected countries in Southern Africa.\r\nNEPAD’s goals have been set, and we have seen\r\nprogress over the last year. The challenge now for\r\nAfricans, and for the international community, is to\r\nremain focused and continue along that promising and\r\npractical path.\r\nMr. Jingree (Mauritius): We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his first consolidated report (A/58/254) on\r\nprogress in the implementation and international\r\nsupport for the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). The report clearly outlines the\r\nprogress in the implementation of NEPAD, as well as\r\nthe challenges and constraints in doing so. We have\r\ntaken note of the conclusions and recommendations\r\ncontained in the report.\r\nWe welcome the fact that this year the Assembly\r\nis considering both the issue of NEPAD and the causes\r\nof conflict in a joint debate. Indeed, NEPAD is a\r\nprogramme of development of Africa that is closely\r\nlinked to peace and security on the continent.\r\nMy delegation would like to focus on a few\r\naspects of NEPAD.\r\nIt has now been acknowledged that NEPAD is a\r\nvision of Africa encompassing all African countries,\r\nmainland and well as island countries. The island\r\ncountries of Africa have their own specificities and\r\nconstraints, including their vulnerabilities. We feel that\r\nthe vulnerability of the small island States of Africa\r\nhave been well documented. The NEPAD initiative\r\nshould also address issues related to small island\r\ndeveloping States, especially in the sectors of\r\ninformation and communication technologies, trade\r\nand the environment.\r\nBesides economic development issues, African\r\ncountries have also emphasized governance in NEPAD.\r\nThe governance process in Africa is reflective of the\r\ncurrent democratic wave sweeping across the\r\ncontinent. The key element of governance in Africa is\r\nobviously the extent to which the process is effectively\r\nand sufficiently institutionalized. That includes the\r\ninvolvement not only of Governments but also of civil\r\nsociety agencies and the private sector. The role of the\r\nprivate sector is fundamental, given its importance in\r\nfacilitating the dynamic process of NEPAD. The\r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism, which was\r\ninstitutionalized this year, will provide a model to\r\nfacilitate the governance process in Africa.\r\nAs a member of the NEPAD Heads of State and\r\nGovernment Implementation Committee, Mauritius is\r\nputting in place national structures to implement and\r\nfollow up the plan. In the same spirit, the private sector\r\nin Mauritius has just adopted a code of conduct on\r\ncorporate governance.\r\nSince the conception of the NEPAD plan, the\r\nGroup of Eight (G-8) has shown much interest in\r\nhelping to eradicate poverty in Africa and to put\r\nAfrican continents on the path towards sustainable\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\ngrowth and development, both individually and\r\ncollectively. Such interest was demonstrated at the G-8\r\nSummit held in Kananaskis in 2002, where the G-8\r\nunveiled its African Action Plan to achieve NEPAD’s\r\nobjectives. However, we note that the extent of\r\ncommitment to the initiative lessened at the Evian\r\nSummit this year, focusing instead on other issues that\r\nthe G-8 considered more pressing. Now more than\r\never, the help and support of the G-8 is required for the\r\nNEPAD initiative, lest there be a crisis in expectations\r\nfor the NEPAD plan.\r\nOn a more positive note, the third Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development,\r\nwhich was held from 29 September to 1 October, did\r\nreaffirm the importance of Africa to some countries.\r\nIndeed, Japan’s announcement of an increase in its\r\ngrant aid to Africa — from the $800 million spent\r\nduring the past five years to $1 billion for the\r\nupcoming five-year period — is in line with the overall\r\nNEPAD plan. Japan’s grant aid will provide assistance\r\nfor the fight against HIV/AIDS and contribute to\r\naddressing other pressing development issues,\r\nincluding the problem of African countries’ debt.\r\nWe call upon the international community to\r\nrenew its commitment and support for the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD.\r\nFor its part, the United Nations has an important\r\nrole to play in implementing NEPAD. In that regard,\r\nwe welcome the establishment of the Office of the\r\nSpecial Adviser on Africa. We would also like to\r\nexpress our appreciation and support to Mr. Ibrahim\r\nGambari, Under-Secretary-General and Special\r\nAdviser on Africa, as well as to his Office, for\r\ncoordinating global advocacy in support of NEPAD.\r\nWith respect to conflict situations in Africa, we\r\nare confident that NEPAD will help to resolve and\r\nprevent conflicts. With the strong determination of our\r\nleaders to help resolve conflicts, we are pleased to see\r\nthat progress has been made in several parts of the\r\ncontinent. Peace and stability are slowly returning to\r\nthe Great Lakes region. The Economic Community of\r\nWest African States responded swiftly to the crisis in\r\nthe West Africa subregion. The same determination\r\nprevailed in other subregions to resolve conflicts.\r\nAfrica’s efforts to grapple with the conflicts on the\r\ncontinent will require the support of the international\r\ncommunity. We believe that the Security Council, as\r\nwell as its Ad Hoc Working Group on Conflict\r\nPrevention and Resolution in Africa, could still play a\r\nmore significant role in helping Africa to resolve its\r\nconflicts. We also believe that there need to be more\r\ncoordinated efforts between the Security Council and\r\nthe Economic and Social Council with respect to\r\ninitiatives for countries emerging from conflicts.\r\nIn conclusion, a peaceful and prosperous Africa is\r\nnot only in the interests of the continent itself, but also\r\nin the wider interests of the international community.\r\nMr. Al-Awadi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I would like to underscore the fact that the\r\nGovernment and people of Kuwait will never forget the\r\nsupport they received from Africa during very difficult\r\ncircumstances experienced by my country in the past.\r\nWe take pride in participating alongside our\r\nAfrican brothers in the debate on the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and on causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa. Kuwait has always\r\ndevoted top priority and importance to these two\r\nquestions because they are related to the interests and\r\nconcerns of our brothers in Africa, with whom we have\r\nclose historical ties, based on mutual respect and\r\nmutual support on issues of common interest in various\r\nfields.\r\nKuwait would like to express its thanks and\r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who\r\ngave impetus to international support for the priorities\r\nof the African continent following the submission of\r\nhis report (A/58/352) on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa. He made this and other\r\nquestions concerning the African countries a central\r\npriority of the Millennium Declaration, followed by\r\npositive developments that strengthened the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in addressing African questions. The\r\nlatest of these developments was the General\r\nAssembly’s welcoming of NEPAD in resolution 57/2.\r\nGiven Kuwait’s close relations, including\r\neconomic relations, with the African countries, we\r\nconsider NEPAD an embodiment of a principle that we\r\nhave always believed in — that there is a close\r\nrelationship between development, political stability\r\nand peace. In that context, we would like to pay tribute\r\nto the African Union for its efforts in integrating the\r\npriorities of NEPAD into national policies and\r\ndevelopment planning and for its work towards\r\nestablishing a new and sound institution for good\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\ngovernance, peace and security in order to guarantee\r\nNEPAD’s success.\r\nImportant elements of NEPAD are the Peer\r\nReview Mechanism and the Peace and Security\r\nCouncil of the African Union, the latter of which was\r\napproved during the first regular session of the Heads\r\nof State and Government of the African Union at its\r\nJuly 2002 Durban summit. Another important element\r\nis the mechanism for conflict management and\r\nresolution, which is aimed at ending bloody conflicts\r\nraging in many African countries.\r\nKuwait views with satisfaction the two reports of\r\nthe Secretary-General, the headway made in the\r\ninternational community’s support for NEPAD and the\r\nefforts to settle conflicts in Africa. The report of the\r\nSecretary-General on NEPAD (A/58/254) notes that\r\nseven African countries have reached the completion\r\npoint for the cancellation of debts. Other heavily\r\nindebted African countries have benefited from the\r\ncancellation of debts announced by many donor\r\ncountries. That is viewed positively by Kuwait, which\r\nwas, even before the creation of NEPAD, an early\r\nproponent of debt relief for African countries. Those\r\ncountries were the beneficiaries of the initiative of His\r\nHighness the Emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad\r\nAl-Jaber Al-Sabah, who in his speech before the forty-\r\nfifth session of the General Assembly, announced the\r\ndecision to cancel all interest on the debts of the\r\npoorest countries of Africa. In addition to moral and\r\npolitical support, we offered great economic assistance\r\nto development projects in African countries, whether\r\nthrough the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic\r\nDevelopment or through charities and civil society\r\norganizations.\r\nKuwait is at the forefront of States giving\r\ndevelopment assistance to other countries, especially\r\nAfrican countries. The assistance in some cases\r\namounted to 8.3 per cent of the Kuwaiti gross national\r\nproduct, which reflects our concern to help developing\r\ncountries raise their standards of living, especially our\r\nbrothers in the African continent. During the period\r\n2001-2002, the Kuwaiti Fund for Economic\r\nDevelopment provided assistance and loans amounting\r\nto $5.9 million to many countries, including 10 African\r\nStates, which received 18 per cent of all the assistance\r\noffered by Kuwait. For the period 2001-2002, the\r\nKuwaiti Fund offered development assistance\r\namounting to $10 million to support development\r\nprojects in the agriculture, water, energy and\r\ntransportation sectors. Forty African countries\r\nbenefited from that development assistance. By mid-\r\n2002, the Kuwaiti Fund for Economic Development\r\nhad provided technical assistance worth $200 million;\r\n10 per cent of that amount went to Africa. Many\r\nAfrican economic and financial institutions benefited\r\nfrom Kuwait’s development assistance. The African\r\nDevelopment Fund received assistance totalling $136\r\nmillion.\r\nAfrican countries and the specialized agencies in\r\nthe African Union should promote this initiative all\r\nover the world and not limit their efforts to certain\r\ndonor countries or to a single continent. The African\r\nUnion’s public relations efforts should be enhanced to\r\npromote this initiative and to raise awareness in all\r\ncountries interested in helping Africa. This should be\r\ndone with the assistance of the United Nations.\r\nThe African countries have made noticeable\r\nefforts to meet the formal request of the international\r\ncommunity: Africa should have the principal role in\r\nachieving stability in the African continent in order to\r\nencourage the donor countries and the private sector to\r\ngive those countries the required technical and\r\neconomic assistance. It is time for the international\r\ncommunity to take further steps towards encouraging\r\nthe African countries and to support their efforts\r\nthrough an increase in technical assistance, in\r\nappreciation of the great efforts made by African\r\ncountries to create the peaceful environment required\r\nfor technical and economic assistance.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation calls upon the\r\nUnited Nations to continue to address the various\r\nproblems of the African continent. In that context, we\r\nwould like to express our support for the efforts of\r\nUnder-Secretary-General and his Special Adviser on\r\nAfrica, Mr. Ibrahim Gambari, to create a cross-agency\r\nmechanism to deal with Africa’s problems, in\r\nparticular within the framework of the General\r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council.\r\nMr. Ekua Avomo (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): As this is the first time that I take the floor\r\nduring this session, I would like, first of all, on behalf\r\nof the delegation of Equatorial Guinea, to congratulate\r\nthe President on his election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. We would\r\nalso like to convey our gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his first in-depth report (A/58/254) on\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nprogress in implementation and international support\r\nfor the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD).\r\nAs a development strategy, NEPAD encompasses\r\nalmost all aspects of society’s economic and political\r\nstructures, including, among other things, development\r\nplanning, sound economic management, human rights,\r\ngood governance, democracy, peace and security, as\r\nwell as the agriculture, health and education sectors —\r\nall of which are key aspects to achieving progress.\r\nAlthough NEPAD is an African initiative, it\r\nnevertheless requires necessary international assistance\r\nfrom both developed countries and the United Nations\r\nsystem. NEPAD provides an important basis to achieve\r\ndevelopment for the African continent. However, that\r\nwill not be possible without the contribution of each\r\nand every African country’s domestic efforts and\r\nstrategies. NEPAD is, first and foremost, an African\r\nissue. It should be up to us, as Africans, to primarily\r\nensure its full success.\r\nThe United Nations — because of what it\r\nrepresents and because of its broad experience — and\r\ndeveloped countries — because of their technology and\r\nthe means at their disposal — should play a crucial and\r\ndecisive role to support Africa in resolving its many\r\nproblems. In that regard, developed countries should\r\nassist Africa to fulfil the commitments undertaken at\r\nthe Monterrey and Johannesburg meetings, organized\r\nunder the auspices the United Nations, to overcome the\r\nproblem of external debt and secure open markets for\r\nAfrican exports; in a word, to achieve the goals of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, among other things.\r\nWe must all strive not to fall into the habit of\r\nmeeting routinely without achieving any specific\r\nobjectives, as happened at the recent meeting of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization at Cancún, where there was\r\nno understanding between the countries of the third\r\nworld and developed countries. Such a situation is\r\nclearly damaging to the weakest.\r\nThe gaps between developed and third world\r\ncountries are growing. Whereas some are concerned\r\nabout daily survival, others have a comfortable\r\nexistence assured them for many decades. Given those\r\ncircumstances, it is difficult to talk about a globalized\r\nworld. The political and economic situation in the\r\nworld today — which is more occupied by other\r\nissues — relegates Africa to an unequal position.\r\nDespite the great efforts being made, war, hunger,\r\npoverty, HIV/AIDS and other questions continue to\r\nsignificantly hinder the achievement of sustainable\r\ndevelopment in African societies. The statistics\r\ncontained in the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme’s Human Development Report 2003 speak\r\nfor themselves. In sub-Saharan Africa over 30 million\r\npeople are infected with HIV/AIDS, over 33 per cent of\r\nthe population suffers from malnutrition and 117 of\r\nevery 1,000 children die before the age of 5.\r\nMy country, Equatorial Guinea, is experiencing\r\ngreat changes in its economic life. We are increasing\r\nour contacts with countries from which we may be able\r\nto receive beneficial cooperation in such sensitive areas\r\nas health and sanitation, education and the status of\r\nwomen, among others. As a peace-loving country,\r\nEquatorial Guinea has been actively engaged in the\r\nefforts of the Central African Economic and Monetary\r\nCommunity to resolve conflicts in the subregion by,\r\namong other things, sending troops to the sisterly\r\nCentral African Republic and organizing at Malabo the\r\ntwentieth ministerial meeting of the United Nations\r\nStanding Advisory Committee on Security Questions in\r\nCentral Africa, which will be held from 27 to 31\r\nOctober 2003.\r\nOn the bilateral front, Equatorial Guinea has\r\nentered into a number of agreements with neighbouring\r\ncountries, and is in the process of negotiating others,\r\non issues of mutual concern.\r\nUltimately, it can be said that there is strength in\r\nunity. The countries, Governments and peoples of\r\nAfrica must join their efforts to attempt to resolve the\r\ngreat problems and challenges they face by expanding\r\ntheir trade and economic relations, strengthening\r\nregional and subregional organizations and enhancing\r\nthe effectiveness of African mechanisms for conflict\r\nresolution, just as we have seen in various areas in\r\nCentral, West and East Africa.\r\nMr. Sharma (Nepal): Nepal aligns itself with the\r\nstatement made by Chairman of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina regarding the sub-item on the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD). We also thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report on that\r\nsub-item (A/58/254) and on the sub-item on the causes\r\nof conflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa (A/58/352).\r\nThe African continent, the birthplace of humanity\r\nand the cradle of human civilization, is indeed\r\ntroubled. The continent bears the old scars of\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\ncolonialism and the fresh wounds of neglect. Most\r\nAfrican countries are grappling with poverty, illiteracy\r\nand disease, and a number of them are in the grips of\r\nconflict and instability. The African people have now\r\nrisen to change that. NEPAD embodies their aspiration\r\nto take control of their destiny through continent-wide\r\ncooperation and collaboration in political and\r\neconomic spheres. NEPAD is an African programme\r\ndesigned to uplift Africans. It is a grand vision never\r\ntried on such a scale elsewhere, and it must be given a\r\nchance.\r\nNepal has long worked in solidarity with African\r\nStates in their struggle for political independence and\r\nfreedom. We congratulate our African friends for the\r\nNEPAD initiative, and we are delighted to support their\r\npursuit for emancipation from poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment. No doubt, NEPAD is an ambitious\r\nundertaking, but it is within striking distance. Africa\r\nhas shown the will to harness its energy and ingenuity\r\nto translate that vision into reality. The international\r\ncommunity should come forward with increased\r\nsupport and assistance to help Africa help itself to\r\nstand on its feet as a proud continent of peaceful\r\nsocieties and prosperous peoples.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nAfrica holds extraordinary promise. Most African\r\nsocieties are tolerant and open-minded, with hard-\r\nworking and innovative people who are prepared to\r\nembrace change. The continent is also a vast repository\r\nof natural resources. Conflict and political uncertainty\r\nhave devastated much of Africa and thwarted its\r\npromise. From Somalia to Liberia, from the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo to Burundi, Africa\r\nhas suffered the pain of violence and the bloodshed of\r\nwar.\r\nSome countries are emerging from strife and, still\r\nfragile, are trying to find their feet in the domain of\r\npeace and normalcy. To make matters worse, much of\r\nAfrica is desperately poor. Poverty in many countries is\r\nprofound and pervasive, and prevents ordinary\r\nAfricans from leading a decent life and raising their\r\nfamilies in dignity. The lack of education impedes their\r\nprogress, and deadly diseases sap their vitality and cut\r\ntheir lives short.\r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis have had a\r\ndramatic impact, decimating sub-Saharan Africa and\r\ntaking a heavy toll in terms of youth and children. The\r\nuntenable greed of some has transformed natural\r\nresources — a huge boon for the African nations —\r\ninto a source of conflict. The rate at which natural\r\nresources are being depleted is frightening. Land\r\nfertility is declining, and conflict and frequent famines\r\nare creating a huge caseload of refugees and displaced\r\npersons.\r\nNepal applauds the idea of setting up a conflict\r\nresolution mechanism under NEPAD. As the\r\nmechanism becomes operational, the global community\r\nshould offer its assistance to complement African\r\nefforts to prevent disputes and resolve conflict. Such\r\nassistance should be aimed at capacity-building, arms\r\ncontrol and mutual confidence, so that durable peace\r\ncan reign in Africa.\r\nPoverty often offers a constituency for rebellion\r\nand conflict. A lasting peace will continue to elude\r\nAfrica unless a heavy investment is made to lift up the\r\ncommon people from the mire of poverty, illiteracy and\r\ndisease.\r\nThe world community must substantially increase\r\nthe amount and improve the quality of its assistance to\r\nAfrican countries in order to implement NEPAD and to\r\nbuild African institutions and the capacity for\r\ndevelopment. Indeed, in the Millennium Declaration,\r\nthe Monterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg\r\nProgramme of Implementation, the world community\r\ncommitted itself to helping Africa and other developing\r\ncountries. Moreover, it pledged to help NEPAD in the\r\n2002 Declaration adopted by the General Assembly.\r\nThese commitments should be met as quickly as\r\npossible on a steady basis.\r\nAs a result of pervasive poverty and a limited\r\nresource base, most African countries are not in a\r\nposition to raise enough funds to finance their own\r\ndevelopment. They need increased official\r\ndevelopment assistance with which to reduce poverty,\r\nfight HIV/AIDS and other diseases, and build\r\ninfrastructure. Nepal welcomes the trend, since 2002,\r\nof increasing official development assistance, and\r\nencourages development partners to sustain that trend.\r\nIn order to release resources for investment from\r\ndebt-service obligations, poor African nations need\r\naccelerated debt relief. Nepal is deeply concerned\r\nabout the slow pace at which the Heavily Indebted\r\nPoor Countries (HIPC) Initiative is being implemented,\r\nat a time when heavily indebted poor nations in Africa\r\nand elsewhere are reeling under the pain of\r\nunsustainable debt overhang.\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nMarket access, which African countries urgently\r\nrequire, has proved to be the most difficult nut to\r\ncrack. It is critical that the rich countries remove the\r\ntariff and non-tariff barriers that wall off the products\r\nof poor countries. Huge farm subsidies in rich\r\ncountries that deprive poor African farmers of their\r\nlivelihoods have no place in free trade. The failure of\r\nthe Cancún trade talks came as a rude shock to us, and\r\nshould challenge the international community to\r\nresume trade negotiations without delay.\r\nMarket opening will surely stimulate investment\r\nin African countries, as well as attract foreign\r\ninvestment. Measures to address the problems of\r\nmarket volatility, investment law and connectivity will\r\nadd further momentum to investment and progress in\r\nthose countries.\r\nThe development of the least developed countries\r\non the continent should receive special attention so that\r\nsuch countries can catch up with the rest.\r\nThe African Peer Review Mechanism is one of\r\nthe most remarkable features of NEPAD, and the\r\nboldest experiment ever for collective self-assessment.\r\nIt will not be easy, but Nepal is confident that African\r\nleaders will display the political will and courage to\r\ntell the truth and take the necessary steps to rectify any\r\naberrations as and when they occur. We are happy to\r\nnote that four countries will introduce the Mechanism\r\nby the end of this year.\r\nNepal supports the accelerated implementation of\r\nNEPAD and calls on the international community to\r\njoin forces to help Africa help itself. It is time to begin\r\nto heal the wounds of neglect that Africa has suffered\r\nfor so long.\r\nThe President: In accordance with the decision\r\ntaken by the General Assembly at its 32nd plenary\r\nmeeting on 15 October 2003, I now call on the\r\nObserver of the Holy See.\r\nArchbishop Migliore (Holy See): A year ago,\r\nthe General Assembly unanimously welcomed the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) as the\r\ninstitutional response of the African Union to meet the\r\nspecial needs of Africa. My delegation is confident that\r\nthe international community will not fail in assisting\r\nthe efforts of this new alliance of African countries in\r\nresponding to the challenges facing their continent. The\r\ncall to, as well as the need for, solidarity among all\r\npeoples increase with the passing of each day.\r\nIn the current world order, the African nations\r\nseem to be among the most disadvantaged. In the face\r\nof the current marginalization of Africa, we have a\r\nduty in solidarity to maintain the commitments we have\r\ncollectively made to move forward with a new pattern\r\nof solidarity and cooperation between the wealthier\r\nnations and the peoples of Africa. This requires a rapid\r\nand definitive solution to the external debt overhang of\r\nAfrican countries. Partial solutions have shown\r\nthemselves in the past to have been inadequate. It is\r\ntime to move forward with a courageous and generous\r\nsolution, which at the same time involves ownership by\r\nboth the Governments of Africa and broad sectors of\r\ncivil society.\r\nThe sum total of African external debt is small by\r\nglobal standards. Hence, not only in terms of justice,\r\nbut also of effective economic possibilities, the burden\r\nof external debt necessitates a comprehensive and\r\nexpeditious solution through the enhanced Highly\r\nIndebted Poor Countries Initiative and other debt relief\r\nmeasures, as agreed upon in the Programme of Action\r\nof the Third United Nations Conference on the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries. This relief process should not\r\ndrag on for long under the yoke of technical and\r\nbureaucratic requirements. Moreover, such process\r\nshould neither be subject to excessive conditionalities\r\nnor become an obstacle to the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nFor external trade to become an essential factor of\r\nAfrican development, the international community\r\nshould uphold and apply aptly the true values of trade\r\nby eliminating all types of unfair competition against\r\nAfrican countries. Establishing trade barriers to protect\r\nthe economic advantages of the producers of rich\r\ncountries, particularly in those sectors in which Africa\r\ncan be competitive, is inconsistent with all those\r\nsolemn economic international commitments. In\r\nconformity with the Programme of Action for the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries for the Decade 2001-2010, the\r\nobjective of granting duty-free and quota-free market\r\naccess to those countries should remain as a\r\nperemptory obligation. In the aftermath of the\r\nMinisterial Conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganization at Cancún, my delegation hopes that the\r\ninternational community will consider providing a\r\ncoherent response to the trade claims of African\r\ncountries, especially in relation to the leading case\r\ninvolving cotton.\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nIn this regard, my delegation wishes to note that\r\nAfrica needs to develop a family-based diversified\r\nagrarian economy, capable of responding to multiple\r\nchallenges such as excessive urban migration, lack of\r\nfood security, the welfare of the family and rural\r\ncommunities, protection of the environment and greater\r\neconomic growth. Furthermore, it is not possible to\r\nachieve economic and social development without\r\nproviding appropriate technology and know-how.\r\nHowever, such technology should be specifically\r\ndesigned for the economic, ecological and social\r\nrealities of Africa and not imposed scientific and\r\ntechnological programmes that are alien to the African\r\nreality.\r\nWithout peace in Africa, it is impossible to think\r\nof just structures of economic and social development.\r\nThe prevention and resolution of regional and internal\r\nconflicts, as well as peace negotiations, correspond to\r\nthe role of the African Union and to the rest of the\r\nregional and subregional organizations, in conjunction\r\nwith the interested Governments. Nevertheless, the\r\nUnited Nations and the rest of the international\r\ncommunity have, an important role to play by\r\nsustaining and supporting regional initiatives and\r\neventually, at a subsidiary level, by supplementing\r\nlocal efforts where necessary.\r\nThe African ownership of NEPAD should not be\r\nan end in itself. Its implementation process and its\r\nultimate responsibility will become fully African only\r\nif it is manifested in an effective and profound manner\r\nthrough the ennoblement of African values, especially\r\nrespect for the family. An acute sense of solidarity and\r\ncommunity life — which in African societies is a true\r\nreflection of the extended family — is deeply rooted\r\nwithin the family, the fundamental unit of society.\r\nNEPAD should become the maximum political\r\nexpression of this extended African family.\r\nIt is therefore the hope of my delegation that\r\nNEPAD’s pursuit of political, social and economic\r\nprogress will also help in the advancement of the\r\nauthentic values of Africa. The Holy See is confident\r\nthat Africa will always preserve this priceless cultural\r\nheritage and never succumb to the temptation of\r\nindividualism, which is so foreign to its best traditions.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 2011 (XX) of 11 October 1965\r\nand decision 56/475 of 15 August 2002, I now call on\r\nthe Observer for the African Union.\r\nMr. Kébé (African Union) (spoke in French):\r\nAfter yesterday’s statement by the Foreign Minister of\r\nMozambique on behalf of the current Chairman of the\r\nAfrican Union, I wish to make the present statement on\r\nbehalf of the Commission of the African Union.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to convey\r\nmy warmest congratulations, sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nsession. My delegation will spare no effort in assisting\r\nyou in carrying out your important mission\r\nsuccessfully. Allow me also to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the two reports before us, on progress in\r\nimplementation and international support for the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), and\r\non implementation of the recommendations contained\r\nin the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa.\r\nI would particularly like to commend the\r\nSecretary-General for the good quality of these reports,\r\nand I welcome this opportunity to share with the\r\nAssembly certain of my remarks and comments. Before\r\ndoing so I wish to pay tribute to Professor Ibrahim\r\nGambari and the Office of the Special Adviser on\r\nAfrica for the unparalleled energy with which they\r\nhave addressed African economic issues within the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nAllow me to recall for the record that it was at\r\nLusaka, during the thirty-seventh regular session of the\r\nAssembly of Heads of State and Government of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity in July 2001, that the\r\nstrategic policy framework and the new vision for the\r\nrenewal and development of Africa, known as NEPAD,\r\nwas adopted. That decision was an act of faith and the\r\nrenewal of a commitment to the principles and\r\npurposes articulated in the Constitutive Act of the\r\nAfrican Union. More than anything, it was the\r\nreaffirmation of a common belief that peace, security,\r\ndemocracy, good governance, political and social\r\nstability and efficient economic policies are the\r\nessential conditions in sustainable socio-economic\r\ndevelopment on the continent.\r\nThe second regular session of the Summit of the\r\nAfrican Union took place in Maputo from 10 to 12 July\r\n2003. Its theme was the guaranteeing of the\r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment, which brings us to the very heart of our\r\ndiscussion here today.\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nWe are pleased by the commitment undertaken by\r\nAfrican States and the international community for the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD. This innovative\r\nprogramme is grounded in a clear-cut partnership\r\nbetween Governments and the private sector in Africa\r\non the one hand, and between African States and\r\ndevelopment partners on the other. Our commitment no\r\nlonger needs to be demonstrated. We are aware that we\r\nmust get the movement started if we want to convince\r\nothers to follow us.\r\nAll over Africa, measures have been initiated at\r\nthe national, subregional and continent-wide levels to\r\nincorporate NEPAD’s objectives into all major\r\npolitical, economic and social undertakings on the\r\ncontinent. Many countries have established a national\r\ncoordinating body for NEPAD. The regional economic\r\ncommunities have begun to restructure their activities\r\nso as to reflect NEPAD’s priorities in their work\r\nprogrammes. Those communities will play a leading\r\nrole in carrying out infrastructure projects and in the\r\ncontext of the integrated agricultural development\r\nprogramme.\r\nA number of other priority programmes have\r\nalready been drafted in the areas of health, education,\r\nenvironment, tourism, industry and so on.\r\nImplementation has already begun at the national and\r\nsubregional levels.\r\nAt the continental level, we have established the\r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism, which 16 countries\r\nhave already joined; we intend to get the reviews\r\nstarted before the end of 2003. This is a unique kind of\r\ninstrument, based as it is on voluntary commitments\r\nand reciprocal monitoring, evaluation and information-\r\nsharing. Each country reviewed will be a textbook case\r\nfor the others in the specific areas of political and\r\neconomic governance and business management.\r\nOf course, we have to maintain the momentum\r\nthus achieved and step it up as necessary. We must\r\nincrease both vertical and horizontal coordination;\r\nbuttress national and subregional institutional\r\ncapacities; and ensure that NEPAD is supported at the\r\ngrass-roots level in Africa. We will achieve this with\r\nthe backing and support of the international\r\ncommunity, which, convinced by our determination,\r\nhas committed itself, standing shoulder to shoulder\r\nwith us, to a number of measures designed to facilitate\r\nNEPAD’s implementation.\r\nThese measures involve, inter alia, official\r\ndevelopment assistance; the problem of Africa’s\r\nexternal debt; opening the markets of the developed\r\ncountries to African exports; elimination of agricultural\r\nsubsidies, which render African products non-\r\ncompetitive; encouraging private enterprises to invest\r\nin Africa; and channelling financial, technical and\r\nother resources to NEPAD’s priority sectors.\r\nTo that end, at Kananaskis the Group of Eight\r\nadopted an Africa Action Plan. The United States has\r\ncreated the Millennium Account, and countries such as\r\nAustria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland,\r\nLuxembourg, Norway, the Netherlands, Portugal,\r\nSweden and Switzerland are already devoting 25 per\r\ncent or more of their official development assistance to\r\nAfrica. We must maintain the pace thus set and ensure\r\nthat each step taken and each advance achieved\r\nbecomes irreversible in our battle for Africa’s political,\r\neconomic and social development.\r\nAll our endeavours, and those of our partners, in\r\nthe area of economic and social development will come\r\nto nought unless we first create the conditions for\r\nlasting peace, security and stability in Africa.\r\nWe in the African Union are aware that peace,\r\nsecurity and stability constitute the foundation upon\r\nwhich economic and social development will be built.\r\nIn this connection, we have undertaken to deal with all\r\nthe conflicts that have broken out on the continent in\r\ncooperation with existing subregional mechanisms and\r\nwith the ongoing support of the United Nations. Real\r\nprogress has been made in Angola, Sierra Leone,\r\nGuinea-Bissau, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nin Ethiopia and Eritrea, and in Liberia. These crises,\r\nwhich only a few years ago were in full conflagration,\r\nare now on the way to being extinguished thanks to the\r\ncombined action of subregional mechanisms, the\r\nAfrican Union, the United Nations and our partners.\r\nThe first lesson that we can draw from these\r\nevents is that we can indeed find a solution to the most\r\ndifficult situations if we pool our efforts and our\r\nenergies in a dynamic partnership for peace. The\r\nsecond lesson is that it is not enough to induce the\r\nwarring parties to sign a ceasefire agreement in order\r\nto establish peace. Yes, peace is a process that begins\r\nwith the ceasefire agreement, but that process must be\r\nsupported for a good while, since the political,\r\neconomic and social fabric of a country in that\r\nsituation is very fragile, if not completely devastated.\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nThe examples of Guinea-Bissau and the Central\r\nAfrican Republic in this regard are indicative of the\r\nrisks that a country faces of sliding back once again\r\ninto the grip of conflict.\r\nDespite the advances achieved, we still have a\r\ngreat deal to do in Africa, particularly to complete the\r\npeace negotiations that are under way on the Sudan; to\r\nfinalize the peace process between Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea; to consolidate the peace process in Burundi;\r\nand to get the process of reconciliation in Somalia on\r\ntrack.\r\nI wish in particular to highlight the case of\r\nBurundi, where ceasefire agreements were concluded\r\nbetween the Transitional Government and three armed\r\ngroups. Those agreements provide for the deployment\r\nof an African mission whose purposes and mandate\r\nwere defined on 2 April 2003 by the Central Organ of\r\nthe Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management\r\nand Resolution in Africa.\r\nAlthough one of the warring parties, the\r\nPalipehutu-FNL, has not signed the agreement, the\r\nAfrican Union believes that it is worth striving to\r\nsupport the embryonic peace thus achieved. The bulk\r\nof the forces of the African Union mission in Burundi\r\nhave already been deployed. That mission is an\r\ninvestment in peace and in the future. As such, it must\r\nbe supported by the United Nations and by the\r\ninternational community as a whole.\r\nThe Security Council must endorse it, since it has\r\nresponsibility for everything that relates to\r\ninternational peace and security. We need the assistance\r\nof the United Nations Secretariat on the ground to help\r\nus in planning the mission and carrying it our\r\nsuccessfully. We need all our development partners to\r\nrespond positively at the pledging conference that the\r\nAfrican Union is organizing in South Africa on 2 and 3\r\nDecember 2003 in order to garner the necessary funds\r\nto finance the mission, whose budget amounts to close\r\nto $120 million a year.\r\nThe African Union’s programme goes beyond the\r\ndaily management of conflicts. Its conceptual basis is\r\nthe principle of prevention — that is to say, acting at an\r\nearly stage on the underlying causes of conflict before\r\nthey break out. In this connection, the African Union\r\nhas established a Peace and Security Council, whose\r\nProtocol, adopted at the first African Union Summit,\r\nheld at Durban, will come into force very shortly.\r\nMore specifically, we need to root out on our\r\ncontinent the seeds of ethnic, religious and\r\nregionalistic division. We need to make institutions and\r\npolitical systems more democratic; promote grass-roots\r\nparticipation and transparency in the management of\r\nthe State patrimony; promote respect for human rights\r\nin all their aspects; combat impunity and corruption;\r\nand safeguard the equality of all before the law.\r\nOnce we have instilled in everyone this culture of\r\ndemocracy, and once our institutions offer everyone, on\r\nan equal footing, recourses whereby they can ensure\r\nthat their voices are heard and that their rights are\r\ntaken into account, we will have fewer armed conflicts\r\nto manage. It is my conviction and that of the African\r\nUnion that the new partnership that we have just put in\r\nplace within the context of our new Union will greatly\r\nassist us in achieving these objectives.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 49/2 of 19 October 1994, I now\r\ncall on the observer for the International Federation of\r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\r\nMr. Gospodinov (International Federation of Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): National Red Cross\r\nand Red Crescent Societies are people’s organizations.\r\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent Societies (IFRC) represents 53 African\r\nmembers, of 178 members worldwide. In Africa alone,\r\n2 million of our active volunteers support the people\r\naffected by severe poverty, to whom we usually refer as\r\nthe most vulnerable. So we speak to you today with a\r\nvoice and experience from the grass roots.\r\nWe strongly support the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) because the vulnerable\r\nin Africa need it, and for us they are more than just the\r\nvulnerable, they are human beings, our brothers and\r\nsisters.\r\nMillions of people die every year from\r\nmalnutrition in slow agonizing deaths due to poverty.\r\nIn a world searching for security, it has become\r\napparent that human security — in this context, the\r\nright of each of us to have basic necessities — is the\r\nonly secure foundation on which to build. NEPAD\r\ncommits to eradicating poverty and has outlined a\r\nreliable plan for action. It therefore deserves to be\r\nsupported.\r\nThe IFRC warmly commends the efforts of the\r\nJapanese Government in organizing the Tokyo\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nInternational Conference on African Development. Our\r\ndelegation has participated in the Conference itself, and\r\nin many of the preparatory stages. We have done so in\r\nthe spirit of NEPAD, working through our African\r\nnational Red Cross and Red Crescent societies.\r\nAfricans have dreamed of democracy and good\r\ngovernance for a long time. They want their\r\nGovernments to be transparent and accountable to\r\nthem, responding to their needs promptly. They want\r\ntheir Governments to listen to them, to respond quickly\r\nto disasters affecting them, to fight the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic and to provide them with basic health care.\r\nNEPAD promotes democracy and good governance and\r\ncommits to the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. This has long been a focus of\r\nAfrican Red Cross and Red Crescent societies, open\r\nand transparent governance enabling strong\r\nimplementation of their development efforts.\r\nNEPAD and IFRC member societies have worked\r\non similar challenges independently, with little\r\ncommunication between them so far. This is not\r\nsurprising. Both are guided by the needs of the people.\r\nOur volunteers are part of the people. They work\r\nwithin their respective communities. In addition, as\r\nauxiliary to public authorities, national Red Cross and\r\nRed Crescent societies closely associate themselves\r\nwith Government policies that match our fundamental\r\nprinciples of neutrality, impartiality and independence.\r\nTo illustrate what we mean I will take a few\r\nquotations from the NEPAD web site, and put them in\r\nthe context of this debate.\r\nFirst, “Africa becomes more effective in conflict\r\nprevention and the establishment of enduring peace on\r\nthe continent.” In pursuing the promotion of our\r\nfundamental principles, some national Red Cross and\r\nRed Crescent societies in Africa train youth leaders in\r\npeer education about resolution of differences through\r\ndiscussion. Mother clubs are encouraged to discuss the\r\nimportance of peace and peaceful settlement of\r\ndifferences at home to influence children from early\r\nchildhood. Dissemination sessions of our fundamental\r\nprinciples speak to the subject of peace. During\r\ndifficult times, when all other organizations may have\r\ndeparted, national Red Cross and Red Crescent\r\nvolunteers have protected children using our emblems,\r\nat the risk of their own lives.\r\nSecondly, “Africa adopts and implements\r\nprinciples of democracy and good political, economic\r\nand corporate governance ...”. In addition to the global\r\nrequirements of donor accountability, the IFRC quite\r\nsuccessfully promotes the principles of integrity,\r\ntransparency and internal accountability in national\r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent societies, governance\r\nbeing accountable to members and volunteers; and\r\nmanagement accountable to governance through a set\r\nof rules. Regular general assemblies are held with\r\nelections of officers for limited terms. Annual plans\r\nand budgets are adhered to and annual external audits\r\nare performed. I am pleased to inform you that today,\r\n75 to 80 per cent of our Red Cross and Red Crescent\r\nsocieties in Africa exercise democracy in every\r\npractical sense. This gives NEPAD experienced allies\r\nin civil society, working consistently to promote\r\ndemocracy and good governance.\r\nThe third element is effective poverty eradication\r\nand genuine partnerships based on mutual respect and\r\naccountability. Our organizations from all African\r\ncountries met in Ouagadougou in September 2000 and\r\ncommitted to two important priorities that would\r\ncontribute to eradicating poverty.\r\nThe first priority, responding to the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic as an unprecedented humanitarian and\r\ndevelopment disaster in Africa, involved massively\r\nscaling up their response in terms of advocacy,\r\nprevention, care and mitigation. They called for a\r\ncomprehensive and coordinated strategy from\r\ncommunities, Governments, national and international\r\norganizations and the private sector for continent-wide\r\nsupport for awareness and prevention campaigns and\r\naccess to treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe second priority, making food security of\r\nstrategic importance for this decade, recognizes that\r\nfood insecurity is directly linked to a number of root\r\ncauses, including poverty, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the\r\nworsening debt crisis and armed conflict. National Red\r\nCross societies from the developed world, attending the\r\nsame meeting as observers, made their own parallel\r\ncommitment to respect and support the priorities\r\nestablished by the Africans themselves and to work in\r\npartnership to fight the pandemic and food insecurity.\r\nThis, in some senses, is a precursor to NEPAD.\r\nAs action followed, I am happy to report to you\r\ntoday that good progress has been recorded in\r\nimplementing NEPAD priorities. Our network reached\r\n1 million Africans in its HIV/AIDS programmes in\r\n2002. The forecasts suggest that it will reach 3 million\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nAfricans by the end of this year, without estimating the\r\npossible multiplier effect in families and communities.\r\nIn related programmes, our volunteers distributed\r\ninsecticide-treated nets for malaria and carried out\r\nsocial mobilization campaigns to help vaccinate over\r\n12 million children for measles and polio in partnership\r\nwith the World Health Organization and African\r\nGovernments.\r\nThe road to development has never been easy\r\nthroughout history. Capital formation or accumulation\r\nof wealth requires restructuring the economy, which\r\ninvolves a lot of sacrifices from the people. These\r\nsacrifices could last indefinitely if the wealth so\r\naccumulated does not quickly regenerate the economy\r\nand create employment to mitigate the suffering. With\r\nHIV/AIDS, the spread of killer diseases such as\r\nmalaria, the known cyclical disasters and the alarming\r\nlevel of poverty, Africans can sacrifice no more\r\nwithout serious consequences. A strong Government\r\npartnership with civil society is essential if we are to\r\nstave off the sacrifices of development.\r\nThe IFRC and its members exist in partnership\r\nwith Governments. It is a partnership based on the\r\nGeneva Conventions, respect for the Red Cross and\r\nRed Crescent emblems and the fundamental principles\r\nof our movement. It is also based on mutual\r\ncooperation and trust, consistent with the position of\r\nour member national societies as auxiliaries to public\r\nauthorities at all levels in their respective countries.\r\nThat aspect of the relationship, which includes a\r\nmutual commitment to dialogue and consultations on\r\nhumanitarian affairs, will again be at centre stage in\r\nDecember this year, when Governments and all our\r\nleaders meet together at the International Conference\r\nof the Red Cross and Red Crescent. At that meeting,\r\nwhich will also be attended by key African regional\r\norganizations along with the United Nations, the\r\nparticipants will agree upon overarching policies and\r\ndirections to guide the work of the wider international\r\ncommunity and our movement on the modern\r\nhumanitarian agenda.\r\nIn that spirit, the International Federation of Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies calls on African\r\nGovernments and other partners to renew and\r\nconsolidate their partnerships with their national Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies, in order to meet the\r\nfollowing goals. The first is to ensure that health care\r\nand social welfare systems are enabled to meet the\r\nneeds of the vulnerable. The second goal is to stop the\r\nspread of HIV/AIDS and to enable people living with\r\nHIV/AIDS to have access to the use of the drugs they\r\nneed. The third goal is to minimize the effects of\r\ndisasters by adopting and implementing appropriate\r\npolicies to invest in long-term food security strategies\r\nthat reduce vulnerability.\r\nIn conclusion, the Secretary General’s report on\r\nthe implementation of Millennium Declaration and the\r\n2003 report of the Commission on Human Security\r\nboth underscored the fact that Africa still faces serious\r\nproblems. All indicators continue to show that Africa is\r\na continent where human security remains at an\r\nunacceptably low level. We trust that Governments will\r\ntake the opportunity offered by the forthcoming\r\nInternational Conference of the Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent in Geneva in December to make their own\r\ncommitments to a better future for Africa. It is not\r\nenough to keep Africa in our hearts and minds. We\r\nmust do more for Africa, and we must do it now.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 33/18, of 10 November 1978, and\r\ndecision 53/453, of 18 December 1998, I now call on\r\nthe observer for the International Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie.\r\nMr. Bouabid (International Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie) (spoke in French): Africa has made, and\r\ncontinues to make, notable progress in the prevention,\r\nmanagement and settlement of conflicts, in the\r\nestablishment and strengthening of democracy, in\r\nsupporting the rule of law and in promoting human\r\nrights. The International Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie, whose charter identifies those areas as\r\npriorities in its work, is quite proud to have been a\r\npartner of numerous African countries in making such\r\ndecisive progress. I would like to take this opportunity\r\nto reaffirm that our support and assistance in all those\r\nfields continue to be available to our African member\r\ncountries.\r\nIn that context, the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) unquestionably represents both\r\na break and a beginning. It is a break towards an\r\ninnovative approach, and the beginning of an enduring\r\nAfrican renaissance. With this African initiative, we in\r\nla Francophonie fully realize that we are living at a\r\nmajor moment in the history of the African\r\ncontinent — a moment that is both unprecedented and\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nhighly symbolic of Africa’s new face, the hopes it\r\nnurtures and the ambitions it has for its peoples.\r\nWe now have before us a new programme of\r\naction that is based on a new strategic vision, a\r\nprogramme for Africa that has been thought out,\r\nconceived, developed and managed by Africa itself and\r\nthat takes into account all the realities in the continent.\r\nThat programme is also one in which African leaders\r\nrecognize their primary responsibility for the\r\ndevelopment of their continent and formally commit\r\nthemselves to do everything possible to launch Africa\r\ninto the orbit of growth and development and to\r\nintegrate it decisively into the world economy.\r\nForemost among African initiatives because of its\r\npolitical status, its continent-wide scope, the breadth of\r\nits goals and the originality of its approach, the\r\nNEPAD project today cannot be disregarded, either by\r\nthe donors and international organizations involved in\r\nAfrica or by the international community as a whole.\r\nThe international community must lend its support\r\nthrough at least an equivalent commitment, especially\r\nin dealing with problems in which Africa unfortunately\r\ndoes not have much leverage. I am thinking in\r\nparticular of the problems of finance, indebtedness,\r\naccess to markets and the transfer of technologies and\r\nexperience. In that regard, it is essential that we meet\r\nthe goals adopted at the Millennium Summit, the\r\nMonterrey Conference and the Johannesburg Summit.\r\nHaving affirmed the interdependence between\r\npeace, democracy and development and having\r\nrecognized that stability, good governance and the rule\r\nof law are essential elements in development, NEPAD\r\ndeserves our respect and support. In that regard, we\r\nwelcome the establishment of the African Peer Review\r\nMechanism, which is designed to ensure that the\r\npolicies and practices of States parties conform to\r\nuniversally recognized values enshrined in the\r\nDeclaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and\r\nCorporate Governance. As a truly institutional\r\ninnovation in inter-African relations, we believe that\r\nthe Mechanism is a resounding illustration of Africa’s\r\nwill to resolutely enter an era of good governance, as\r\nwell as a key tool in the effective implementation of\r\nNEPAD.\r\nThe International Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie counts 29 African States among its 56\r\nmembers. From the beginning, la Francophonie\r\nwelcomed the NEPAD initiative and decided to extend\r\nits full support to it, while calling on NEPAD to take\r\ninto account and respect various elements that we\r\nbelieve are essential to ensuring NEPAD’s full success.\r\nThe first of those is the participation of all actors,\r\nboth in considering and implementing this\r\ncomprehensive project, as well as ownership of\r\nNEPAD by citizens themselves. That clearly requires\r\nan ongoing information process to raise awareness and\r\nto mobilize the citizenry. The second element is the\r\nneed to take immediate steps in the medium- and long-\r\nterm implementation of the programme of action to\r\nfoster the well-being of people in order to soothe the\r\nimpatience, and even disillusionment, that followed the\r\ngreat hopes that were engendered by the wave of\r\ndemocratization of the 1990s. Lastly, the third element\r\nis to strengthen democratic culture and peace, as well\r\nas the notion of effort and responsibility. That should\r\nbe done by both example and through education,\r\nutilizing a multifaceted approach aimed at all social\r\ngroups.\r\nThe International Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie put forth proposals in that regard at the\r\nsummit of African heads of State on financing NEPAD,\r\nwhich was held in Dakar in April 2002. Those\r\nproposals emerged from the convergence between\r\nNEPAD’s priorities, on the one hand, and the priorities\r\nof la Francophonie’s work, on the other hand, in\r\nparticular those suggested by la Francophonie’s Inter-\r\ngovernmental Agency, its main operational body.\r\nThose proposals deal principally with the following\r\nareas.\r\nThe first area involves peace, security and good\r\ngovernance. We have made our advocacy and\r\nprogrammes available to NEPAD, especially those that\r\ncame out of the Bamako declaration adopted by\r\nfrancophone countries in November 2000. We also\r\nplace special emphasis on strengthening institutional\r\ncapacity by relying on the professional networks and\r\ninstruments already in place. Along with our partners\r\nin NEPAD, our delegation for human rights and\r\ndemocracy began to think about concrete ways of\r\ninvolving la Francophonie in this fundamental aspect\r\nof NEPAD at two specific meetings. It is in that context\r\nthat we made our contribution to the establishment of a\r\nnetwork of African mediators at Ouagadougou in\r\nMarch 2000, as well as the inter-African network to\r\nregulate communications, which was established at\r\nJohannesburg in September of the same year.\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nIn cooperation with the World Bank, our human\r\nrights and democracy delegation also greatly\r\ncontributed to the preparation and convening of the\r\nAbuja Pan-African Conference on law, justice and\r\ndevelopment. We are currently preparing the follow-up\r\nConference, to be held in Algiers in February 2004,\r\nagain in cooperation with the World Bank.\r\nI also wish to refer to the establishment of a\r\nstanding committee in Dakar entrusted with helping to\r\nimplement la Francophonie’s support for the\r\ninternational initiative for democracy and human rights\r\nin Africa. We are also planning, together with the\r\nUnited Nations Department of Political Affairs, a\r\nseminar on early warning and conflict prevention, to be\r\nheld in the first quarter of 2004. Many African entities\r\nwill be associated with that seminar, the objective of\r\nwhich will be to improve the capacity of participating\r\ninstitutions in preventing, managing and settling\r\nconflicts.\r\nIn the field of new information and\r\ncommunication technologies, in addition to the\r\nprogrammes already being carried out by the Institut\r\nfrancophone des nouvelles technologies de\r\nl’information et de la formation — which are of great\r\nbenefit to many African members and whose objectives\r\nare shared by NEPAD — a francophone ministerial\r\nconference on the information society was held last\r\nmonth in Rabat in preparation for the World Summit on\r\nthe Information Society. The work undertaken at the\r\nconference has given la Francophonie’s action an even\r\nstronger dynamic of support for NEPAD.\r\nEnergy and the environment are two sectors that\r\nare broadly covered by the activities of la\r\nFrancophonie, through its Institut de l’énergie et de\r\nl’environnement in Quebec, in the context of the\r\nfollow-up to the Johannesburg World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development. La Francophonie’s\r\nframework of action in that context, which will guide\r\nour programming in this field over the next decade, has\r\nbeen largely inspired by the concerns and orientations\r\nformulated in NEPAD. Africa enjoys confirmed\r\npriority therein. NEPAD’s energy and environmental\r\nfacet will be supported by la Francophonie as an\r\napproach based on regional action and as a basis of our\r\nprogramming for sustainable development in Africa.\r\nLa Francophonie’s framework of action thus embraces\r\nthe priorities and scope of NEPAD in its deployment.\r\nEducation and culture are two fields in which la\r\nFrancophonie has acknowledged experience. Its\r\nprogrammes for Africa are conceived and deployed in\r\nclose cooperation with ministers of education,\r\nespecially Africans. It goes without saying that they are\r\nfully in line with NEPAD’s priorities.\r\nIn conclusion, I note that the solidarity of the\r\nFrench-speaking countries with Africa will enjoy pride\r\nof place on the agenda of the summit of heads of State\r\nand Government of the French-speaking countries, to\r\nbe held in Ouagadougou in the autumn of 2004.\r\nNEPAD will be at the centre of the discussions at the\r\nsummit, the theme of which will be cooperation for\r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on agenda item 39 and its sub-items (a) and\r\n(b).\r\nOur joint debate on item 39, “New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development: progress in implementation and\r\ninternational support”, and its sub-items (a) and (b) has\r\nbeen both interesting and wide-ranging. The 63\r\nrepresentatives participating in the debate underlined\r\nthe progress achieved since the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which met one year ago, as\r\nwell as obstacles that have been encountered in\r\nimplementing this African Union-led, owned and\r\nmanaged initiative.\r\nAfrican leaders have taken many steps to\r\naccelerate economic growth, promote sustainable\r\ndevelopment, reduce poverty and improve the living\r\nstandards of the peoples of Africa. Efforts have also\r\nbeen made in both conflict prevention and in creating a\r\nbetter framework for development. The creation, in\r\naddition to the Commission of the African Union, of\r\nthree fundamental institutions — the Peace and\r\nSecurity Council, the Pan-African Parliament and the\r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Council — will\r\ndefinitely facilitate the process of conflict prevention\r\nand ensure the participation of the African peoples in\r\nthe development and economic integration of their\r\ncontinent. The inclusion of civil society in the African\r\nUnion’s affairs will also be facilitated.\r\nMany delegations from donor and developing\r\ncountries applauded the establishment of the African\r\nPeer Review Mechanism and encouraged its\r\nimplementation by the end of this year. Despite the\r\nprogress achieved, much remains to be done in moving\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nforward with the implementation of NEPAD. Bold\r\nactions are required on the part of all stakeholders to\r\naddress the various challenges and constraints that\r\nhave been identified. The increase of official\r\ndevelopment assistance and debt relief will allow the\r\nAfrican countries to ensure sustainable development\r\nand achieve the NEPAD objectives, as well as those of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration. I was pleased to hear\r\nabout new commitments from developed countries that\r\nwere sounded during many recent international\r\ngatherings and we call on them to substantially\r\nenhance the flow of resources to the African continent.\r\nThe importance of trade in national development\r\ncannot be overstated. We all agree that the international\r\ncommunity should make more concerted efforts to\r\nexpand market access to African products. The current\r\nsystem does not work, especially for the least\r\ndeveloped countries. Many delegations highlighted the\r\nfact that some developed countries have begun to\r\ndemonstrate flexibility on agricultural subsidies and\r\nother issues. The recent World Trade Organization\r\nagreement to allow developing countries to import\r\ninexpensive generic drugs was widely welcomed,\r\nespecially in Africa, where HIV/AIDS, malaria and\r\ntuberculosis are pervasive. The failure at Cancún,\r\nhowever, has dampened hopes for further progress in\r\nthese areas.\r\nAs the report of the Secretary-General underlines,\r\ncertain countries observed a degradation of their debt\r\nindicators because of the decrease in export incomes\r\nand the volatility of commodity prices. The result has\r\nbeen low investment and economic growth, insufficient\r\njob creation for the poor and too few resources for\r\nhealth and education. During this debate, a number of\r\nideas were put forward on the handling of external\r\ndebt, which has sapped the energy of many developing\r\ncountries. By further exploring such options as debt\r\nrestructuring and debt relief, many believe that these\r\nwill contribute to the sustained economic growth of the\r\nhighly indebted poor countries in Africa. I invite all\r\nmembers to continue the discussion of these and other\r\nalternatives and actively to participate in the open-\r\nended panel of the plenary on commodities that I will\r\nconvene on the afternoon of 27 October 2003.\r\nThe debate of the plenary was also devoted to the\r\npromotion of lasting peace in Africa. Actually, this is\r\nthe major goal of NEPAD, which rightly links\r\ndevelopment and stability. Delegations underlined\r\nimportant developments in this area. Still, the main\r\nfocus continues to be on the prevention, management\r\nand resolution of conflicts and many representatives\r\nproposed that it should be done also through the\r\nstrengthening of African capacities, including support\r\nfor regional and subregional organizations.\r\nAt the same time, the role of the United Nations\r\nsystem cannot be overestimated. Past experience\r\nproves expeditiously that when United Nations and\r\nAfrican countries act in a coherent and consistent\r\nmanner, they can have a significant impact on peace,\r\ndevelopment and security. Many delegations\r\ncommented on the high quality of the reports on\r\nAfrica. They welcomed the creation of the Office of the\r\nSpecial Adviser on Africa and congratulated the Office\r\nfor the efforts it has made thus far in addressing the\r\nchallenges of African development. They called for\r\nadequate resources to be made available to it to enable\r\nit to perform the functions assigned to it.\r\nThe forthcoming high-level dialogue on financing\r\nfor development, so critical to socio-economic\r\ndevelopment, especially in Africa, can become another\r\ndriving force for action-oriented solutions in this area.\r\nWe all agree that during this session the General\r\nAssembly must advance the work and take action on\r\nmany pressing development issues, and, as I promised\r\nfrom the very beginning of my term, we will pursue\r\nmany of these issues through interactive dialogue.\r\nThe Assembly has been the guiding light behind a\r\ndecade of summits and conferences, the objectives of\r\nwhich were to assist Member States, especially those in\r\nAfrica, to meet their development goals. Now is the\r\ntime to mobilize all our efforts for their timely\r\nimplementation.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 39 and its sub-items (a)\r\nand (b).\r\nAgenda item 56 (continued)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters\r\nMr. Chaimongkol (Thailand): Thailand is\r\npleased that, once again, these two related items —\r\nnamely, “Report of the Security Council and “Question\r\nof the equitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters”, including the report of the Open-ended\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nWorking Group, are being considered in tandem as part\r\nof our efforts to rationalize the work of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThese two items are indeed important, not least\r\nbecause, first, we appreciate the symbolism inherent in\r\nthe Council’s reporting to this body, which represents\r\nthe general membership of the United Nations; and\r\nsecondly, Thailand’s former Permanent Representative\r\nto the United Nations, Ambassador Chuchai\r\nKasemsarn, had served as one of the Vice-Chairmen of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on Security Council\r\nreform.\r\nBut I cannot but wonder whether there is a larger\r\nissue here — one that transcends the report of the\r\nSecurity Council or the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nSecurity Council reform, and perhaps one that both the\r\nreport and the Working Group, unfortunately, have\r\nbeen unable to address.\r\nThe issue is the one raised by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral himself in his report to the General Assembly\r\non 23 September. Are the available rules and\r\ninstruments that underpin multilateralism, particularly\r\nthe Security Council, adequate and effective enough to\r\nmeet the current challenges to international peace and\r\nsecurity? And, if not, what are we, the Member States,\r\ngoing to do about it?\r\nFollowing the end of the cold war, hopes were\r\nhigh that the Security Council, entrusted by the general\r\nmembership of the United Nations with overseeing the\r\nimportant question of international peace and security,\r\nwould regain its unity and be able effectively and\r\nconsistently to fulfil its mandate.\r\nIndeed, the Security Council has had many\r\nnotable achievements. It has, inter alia, mandated\r\npeacekeeping operations and assistance missions\r\nworldwide — from Sierra Leone to Timor-Leste to\r\nAfghanistan — and galvanized the international\r\ncommunity to combat international terrorism through\r\nthe Counter-Terrorism Committee.\r\nBut it is also fair to say that, in view of recent\r\nexperiences, there is a growing perception that the\r\nSecurity Council has been unable to meet fully the high\r\nexpectations placed on it by the general United Nations\r\nmembership and that, for some States, there is even a\r\nsense of frustration.\r\nPart of this is because of the perceived erosion of\r\nunity in the Council. That situation does not help sway\r\npublic opinion towards the Council as being the\r\nguarantor of international peace and security. In\r\naddition, recent practices regarding the formulation of\r\ndecisions within the Council, where even the elected\r\nmembers of the Council — the representatives of all\r\nfive regional groups here at the United Nations — are\r\nnot always fully consulted, raises the question of\r\ntransparency even within the Council itself. On\r\noccasion, the Council has simply been unable to act.\r\nThe time is thus indeed ripe for the members of\r\nthe international community to look at the issue as\r\nposed by the Secretary-General with an open mind, a\r\nsense of urgency and clarity of purpose. For we are\r\nindeed, as the Secretary-General put it, at a fork in the\r\nroad, where the choices appear to be between,\r\nfirst, making the existing multilateral system more\r\neffective — a generally preferred option — or,\r\nsecondly, resorting to other alternatives, the\r\nconsequences of which, for most, are unknown at best\r\nand unthinkable at worst.\r\nIf we are in agreement that there are no better\r\nalternatives to the multilateral system, we should\r\nseriously consider making the existing multilateral\r\nsystem, and indeed, the Security Council more\r\neffective. That is where reform of the Security Council\r\ncomes into play.\r\nThe problem that we all face in this regard,\r\nhowever, is that the forum mandated by the General\r\nAssembly to examine the question of Security Council\r\nreform — namely, the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nSecurity Council reform — has not been able to\r\nachieve any substantial progress since it was\r\nestablished by General Assembly resolution 48/26 in\r\n1993. The Working Group remains as deadlocked as\r\never and unable to offer concrete recommendations on\r\nCouncil reform.\r\nMoreover, while all of us speak of the need for\r\nreform, there appears to be a trend of declining interest\r\nin the work of the Open-ended Working Group, which\r\njust has not been able to compete with other United\r\nNations bodies for the attention of Member States.\r\nDuring the previous session, for example, meetings of\r\nthe Working Group had to be cancelled in order to\r\naccommodate requests by Member States to follow the\r\nproceedings on the issue of the day in the Security\r\nCouncil. But those frustrating developments should not\r\ndistract us from trying to make some progress on\r\nSecurity Council reform, as difficult as it may be. In\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nthat connection, I wish to pay tribute to Mr. Jan Kavan,\r\nthe former President of the General Assembly, for his\r\nfirm leadership and determination, in the face of\r\nadversity, to continue to push forward the issue of\r\nCouncil reform as Chairman of the Working Group.\r\nIt is fair to say that there has been some progress\r\nmade in the past year. At the initiative of the Working\r\nGroup’s bureau, we were able to significantly\r\nstreamline the proposals for reform that had\r\naccumulated throughout the years relating to both\r\ncluster 1 and cluster 2 issues. The Working Group now\r\nhas before it a more concise menu of proposals as a\r\nbasis for its work when it reconvenes early next year.\r\nAs for Thailand, we continue to call for\r\ndiscussions on both cluster 1 and cluster 2 issues in\r\ntandem, with a view to creating a single comprehensive\r\npackage of proposals for reform. But we would also\r\nsupport constructive ideas to improve the working\r\nmethods of the Working Group, including the use of\r\ninformal meetings to facilitate consultations.\r\nThailand continues to call for a gradual approach\r\nto resolving the issue of the veto, beginning with\r\ncurtailment of the veto and leading to its eventual\r\nabolition. We continue to support expansion of Council\r\nmembership in both the permanent and non-permanent\r\ncategories on the basis of equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation and the ability to share responsibility\r\nand to make financial and political contributions to the\r\nUnited Nations. On that basis, we see Japan as a\r\nworthy candidate to be a new permanent member of the\r\nCouncil. Furthermore, any solution with respect to\r\nCouncil expansion should be subject to periodic\r\nreview.\r\nBut substantive Security Council reform will not\r\nhappen if Member States do not have the political will\r\nto make it happen. If Security Council reform does not\r\nmaterialize, then the existing multilateral framework\r\nand the institutions that help oversee international\r\npeace and security may not be able to meet effectively\r\nthe new and old challenges facing humanity.\r\nThailand therefore supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposal to establish a high-level panel of\r\neminent persons to, among other things, examine\r\ncurrent challenges to peace and security and\r\nrecommend ways to strengthen the United Nations\r\nthrough the reform of its institutions and processes. We\r\nlook forward to fruitful and productive interaction\r\nbetween that panel, when it is established, and the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on Security Council\r\nReform.\r\nI would like to make one last point on the report\r\nof the Security Council. We appreciate all the efforts\r\nundertaken to prepare the report, which follows the\r\nimproved format begun last year. The report provides a\r\nuseful summary of what the Council has undertaken\r\nduring the preceding 12-month period. But we hope\r\nthat future reports will be more analytical, and that\r\nthey will incorporate the monthly assessments of the\r\nCouncil’s work made by Council Presidents. The report\r\nshould be made as up-to-date as possible, otherwise it\r\nwill be of limited use and of even more limited\r\nrelevance.\r\nThailand will continue to engage constructively\r\nin the process of Security Council reform as part of the\r\nglobal cooperative effort to make multilateralism even\r\nmore effective in addressing the challenges of our\r\ntimes.\r\nMr. Paolillo (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): Ten\r\nyears after the establishment of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters Related to the\r\nSecurity Council, not only have we failed to find a\r\nsatisfactory formula to reform the membership of the\r\nCouncil in a way that adequately reflects modern\r\ninternational realities, we must now also resolve the\r\nissue of how to proceed in the future to pursue our goal\r\nof reform. It hardly needs to be pointed out that we\r\ncannot continue to belabour the old reform proposals,\r\nmade over a decade ago; nor can we continue to resort\r\nto the same mechanisms and procedures we have\r\nemployed thus far. That would simply protract our\r\nconsultations, perhaps making them as unproductive as\r\nthey have been to date.\r\nIn order to make progress it is essential that we\r\nchange our approach, thinking and procedures. I\r\nbelieve that, at this stage, it is abundantly clear that\r\nreform based on a simultaneous increase in both the\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories of\r\nmembership has thus far not won widespread\r\nacceptance in the international community. No doubt,\r\nthe purpose of enhancing the representative,\r\ndemocratic and transparent character of the Council\r\ncan be achieved through another sort of reform that\r\nwould not entail expanding the right of the veto — an\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nanti-democratic institution par excellence — to a small\r\ngroup of States.\r\nWe also believe that we should stop addressing\r\nthe question of the reform of the Security Council as a\r\ncomprehensive package whose every aspect hinges\r\nupon another. That has led to the paradox that Uruguay\r\nhas repeatedly pointed out, namely, that despite the fact\r\nthat there is widespread agreement on certain\r\nreforms — such as increasing the number of non-\r\npermanent members, which no country opposes —\r\nthose reforms cannot be adopted or implemented until\r\nsome improbable agreement is reached with regard to\r\nother reforms whose potential for being accepted is\r\nextremely remote. That approach is every year\r\ndepriving the members of the General Assembly of the\r\npossibility of being represented in the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nI wish to say once again what we have repeatedly\r\nsaid in the past. Had we decided 10 years ago to\r\nincrease the number of non-permanent members — for\r\ninstance, by increasing that number to 15, which is to\r\nsay, only five additional non-permanent members — 50\r\nadditional countries could have held seats in the\r\nSecurity Council in that time. It continues to be an\r\nirony that while we proclaim the goal of expanding the\r\nCouncil’s representative nature, we are proceeding in a\r\nmanner that perpetuates restricted representation. An\r\nincrease in non-permanent members could be effected\r\nonly without prejudice to continued study of the\r\npossibility of expanding the permanent membership.\r\nWe are convinced that we can continue our\r\nendeavour and achieve more effective results if we\r\nwork on new proposals that will even satisfy the\r\naspirations of some States that are prepared to shoulder\r\ngreater responsibilities by increasing their presence and\r\nparticipation in the Council without thereby affecting\r\nthe body’s democratic nature or the principle of the\r\nsovereign equality of States. For example, we could\r\nconsider the possibility of the limited re-election of a\r\ncertain number of non-permanent members, or the\r\nestablishment of permanent observers, or indeed the\r\nproposal made by Italy in 1993 aimed at ensuring more\r\nfrequent participation by certain countries in the work\r\nof the Council. However, we must bear in mind that an\r\nexpansion of the Security Council cannot exceed\r\ncertain limits. Inefficiency and sluggishness could\r\nbecome serious threats in a Security Council\r\ncomprising more than 25 members.\r\nAt the same time, we must establish rules and\r\nprocedures that ensure participation on the part of all\r\nCouncil members — permanent and non-permanent —\r\nat all stages of consultation and negotiation. Let us not\r\nforget that the Security Council acts on behalf of all\r\nMembers of the Organization, and that, in that capacity,\r\nall its activities must be carried out with the greatest\r\npossible transparency and be open to all its members.\r\nFor the same reason, we must improve the relationship\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly to bridge the gap that exists between those\r\ntwo bodies.\r\nThe Secretary-General has informed us that he\r\nproposes to create a high-level panel of eminent\r\npersonalities to consider, among other matters, the\r\nfunctioning of United Nations organs and the relations\r\namong them. It is to be hoped that the panel will\r\nanalyse the debates on that issue that have taken place\r\nin the Assembly and in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup. Reference to the yearly reports that the\r\nWorking Group has been submitting to the Assembly\r\nmay be of great interest to the panel, because they\r\nprovide a complete picture of current trends of thought\r\nand of the kinds of reform that have the potential to be\r\ngenerally accepted.\r\nWe hope that the results of the panel’s work will\r\nmake a useful contribution to our ongoing efforts to\r\nimprove the Security Council’s efficiency. Without\r\nprejudice to that, we understand that it would not be\r\nadvisable to suspend our work within the Organization\r\nin expectation of the panel’s pronouncements. At a\r\ntime when the United Nations needs, more than ever\r\nbefore, to foster the spirit of renewal and change, we\r\nmust continue our exercise in the hope of soon finding\r\na satisfactory response to this important problem.\r\nMr. Ryan (Ireland): We thought the initiative last\r\nyear to consider the report of the Security Council and\r\nthe matter of reform of the Council together was a\r\ngood one and made for a more coherent debate.\r\nTherefore, I should like to cover both subjects today.\r\nThe restructuring of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly on the Council’s\r\nactivities — also initiated last year — certainly helps to\r\nmake it more accessible. The grouping of statistical\r\ndetail in annexes also contributes to a more\r\nmanageable report. We still think, however, that the\r\nCouncil could be more adventurous. While the\r\nintroduction is well drafted and takes a comprehensive\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nlook at the issues before the Council in the period\r\nAugust 2002 to July 2003, we continue to believe that\r\nit could have a greater analytical component, even\r\nallowing for the constraints of which we are all aware.\r\nI would recall that Ireland was a member of the\r\nCouncil during part of the period covered by the report.\r\nDuring our membership of the Council, we were\r\nassociated with a number of practical improvements in\r\nthe Council’s working methods. Among these were the\r\nincreased frequency and modified format of open\r\nmeetings of the Council and the arrangements for\r\ncloser and more systematic consultations with troop-\r\ncontributing countries. Because of them, we have better\r\naccess to information and greater opportunities to\r\nparticipate in Council deliberations as a non-member\r\nthan was possible in 2001, when we joined the Council.\r\nWe welcome the continued progress being made in the\r\nCouncil’s working methods. I believe that verifiable\r\nsteps were taken in the past couple of years which\r\ncould usefully be recorded and developed as we move\r\nforward.\r\nThe Security Council has had a very challenging,\r\neven traumatic, year since its last report. That reflects\r\nthe many threats and challenges to international peace\r\nand security — and to the Organization itself — starkly\r\nidentified by the Secretary-General in his statement to\r\nthe General Assembly at the opening of the current\r\nsession (see A/58/PV.7): terrorism; the escalation of\r\nviolence in many parts of the world; extreme poverty;\r\nand the threat of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nincluding nuclear proliferation.\r\nThe situation in Iraq predominated during the\r\npast year and is likely to absorb much of the Council’s\r\nenergy in the coming phase. The problem of conflict in\r\nAfrica was again a particular focus, with crises in a\r\nnumber of areas, particularly in West Africa. The\r\nCouncil had to address conflicts in Côte d’Ivoire and in\r\nLiberia. In Central Africa, the situation in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is one of mixed\r\nresults; agreement has been reached on the process for\r\nbuilding a transitional national Government, but\r\nserious violence has continued on the ground,\r\nparticularly in the east. Some real progress has been\r\nachieved, including the successful conclusion of the\r\nUnited Nations Mission in Angola in February 2003\r\nand the consolidation of the peace and reconstruction\r\nprocess there. We are disappointed, however, that the\r\nreport is largely silent on the issue of greater\r\ncooperation between the Security Council and other\r\norgans of the United Nations, in particular the\r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nI now wish to turn to the second topic of our joint\r\ndebate: that of reform of the Security Council. As the\r\nIrish Prime Minister, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, said in\r\nhis address to the General Assembly a little over two\r\nweeks ago (see A/58/PV.11), our present world needs a\r\nviable system of global governance that can ensure\r\ninternational peace and security. He went on to add\r\nthat, to be viable, such a system must possess two\r\nessential qualities: effectiveness and legitimacy. To be\r\neffective, it requires the unambiguous support of the\r\nentire community of nations; to retain legitimacy, it\r\nmust be seen to work in the interests of the entire\r\ninternational community. He was speaking of the\r\nUnited Nations as a whole, but his point is also directly\r\napplicable to the Security Council.\r\nWe all know what is at stake. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral put it starkly — and rightly so — to the\r\nAssembly some weeks ago when he said that there is\r\nan urgent need for the Security Council to regain the\r\nconfidence of States and of world public opinion by\r\ndemonstrating its ability to deal effectively with the\r\nmost difficult issues, but also by becoming more\r\nbroadly representative of the international community\r\nas a whole as well as of the geopolitical realities of\r\ntoday’s world. After nearly a decade of debate, the\r\nparameters of that debate are wearisomely familiar. It\r\nis as if, collectively, we have become connoisseurs of\r\nagendas of evasion, driven in some quarters by\r\nnarrower self-interests. But, as Mr. Ahern also stated\r\nsquarely in his address to this year’s Assembly, we\r\nhave balked, collectively, at taking the hard decisions.\r\nMy Government is convinced that we must now\r\nrealize — and, crucially, translate into action — that\r\nthe point has come for us, together, to get to grips with\r\nthose hard decisions. If we want the Council’s\r\ndecisions to command greater respect, we must all\r\naddress the issue of the Council’s composition with\r\ncreative urgency. This is the Secretary-General’s\r\nchallenge to us: to make multilateralism, the United\r\nNations system, directly relevant to the common\r\nthreats we face in the real world, in real time.\r\nIreland takes our Secretary-General’s call to\r\naction very seriously. We do not call into question the\r\ndedication of representatives in the Open-Ended\r\nWorking Group and we appreciate that valuable work\r\nhas been done — also in the past year — to try to\r\n29\r\nA/58/PV.35\r\nnarrow the differences between positions. Frankly,\r\nhowever, this is no longer sufficient.\r\nWe need to look at the issue more creatively if we\r\nare to break out of the current impasse on Council\r\nreform. We need to work more consciously and\r\ndeliberately towards a solution that is comprehensive\r\nand will give us a Council which is strengthened,\r\nbecause it enjoys reinforced legitimacy, and is also\r\nefficient and effective, because it is more responsive to\r\nnew challenges in a world vastly different from that\r\nwhich existed in 1945 and, regrettably, also very\r\ndifferent from that which existed at the start of this\r\nnew century or even two months ago. We need, above\r\nall, to be guided first and foremost by what is best for\r\nthe international community and for the safeguarding\r\nand strengthening of the multilateral system to which\r\nwe are and must continue to be passionately attached.\r\n2005 is increasingly being seen as a natural\r\npoint — five years after the Millennium Summit — at\r\nwhich to assess what will have been achieved by then\r\nunder the programme of action set out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. Reform of the United\r\nNations — and therefore also reform of the Council —\r\nis a critical element of that programme of action. While\r\nthere is an objective need for reform that transcends\r\ntimetables, we might also draw inspiration from this\r\ndeadline.\r\nWe welcome the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to establish a high-level panel of eminent\r\npersonalities to look at the challenges facing the United\r\nNations, including reform, but it is vital that work be\r\ndone to prepare the ground for the report of the group.\r\nIts findings will not be implemented in a vacuum or its\r\nwork assisted by postponing action until it completes\r\nits work.\r\nIn conclusion, you have our pledge, Sir, that the\r\nIrish delegation will contribute actively and\r\nconstructively on the issue of Security Council reform.\r\nWe stand ready, as an active member of the Open-\r\nEnded Working Group, to discuss with you and with\r\ninterested delegations how we might take our work\r\nforward. We are willing to look at any and all creative\r\nsuggestions, but we must all do more than simply\r\ntinker with the way we work. We must address,\r\ntogether, those hard decisions I spoke about earlier.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.\r\n"
