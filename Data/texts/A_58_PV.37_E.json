Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work\r\nLetter from the Chairman of the Committee on\r\nConferences (A/58/356/Add.1)\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now turn its\r\nattention to document A/58/356/Add.1, which contains\r\na letter dated 13 October 2003 from the Chairman of\r\nthe Committee on Conferences addressed to the\r\nPresident of the Assembly. Members are aware that,\r\npursuant to section I, paragraph 7, of Assembly\r\nresolution 40/243, no subsidiary organ of the General\r\nAssembly may meet at United Nations Headquarters\r\nduring the main part of a regular session of the\r\nAssembly unless explicitly authorized by the\r\nAssembly.\r\nAuthorization is thus sought for the subsidiary\r\norgan cited in the letter, on the strict understanding that\r\nmeetings would have to be accommodated within\r\navailable facilities and services.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to authorize the subsidiary organ of the\r\nAssembly listed in the letter of the Chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Conferences to meet during the main\r\npart of the fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 12\r\nReport of the Economic and Social Council (A/58/3\r\n(Part I))\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the President\r\nof the Economic and Social Council, His Excellency\r\nMr. Gert Rosenthal, to introduce the report of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nMr. Rosenthal (spoke in Spanish): It gives me\r\ngreat pleasure to introduce the report of the Economic\r\nand Social Council for 2003, circulated in a\r\npreliminary version under symbol A/58/3.\r\nThe United Nations Charter establishes a clear\r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the\r\nCouncil, and, as main organs of the Organization, we\r\nwork together in multiple ways. But in the past year,\r\ntwo new avenues of cooperation have opened up,\r\nwhich will surely lead to a much stronger relationship\r\nin the future. I refer, first, to the joint role that the\r\nMonterrey Consensus assigns to the General Assembly\r\nand the Economic and Social Council in follow-up\r\nactivities to the International Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development. Secondly, I refer to General\r\nAssembly resolution 57/270 B, adopted in June of this\r\nyear, which confirmed the central role of the Economic\r\nand Social Council in promoting an integrated and\r\ncoordinated implementation and follow-up of decisions\r\nadopted at major United Nations summits and\r\nconferences in the economic and social spheres.\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nDocument A/58/3 presents a broad vision of\r\nEconomic and Social Council activities during this\r\ncalendar year. I would like to highlight those aspects\r\nthat I find to be of special significance.\r\nFirst, I would like to mention the Economic and\r\nSocial Council high-level joint meeting with the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO), held on 14 April. This was the\r\nfirst fully reconstituted meeting after Monterrey. As\r\nsuch, it featured significant innovations both in its\r\npreparations and its format, to enable it to fulfil its new\r\nspecific role in the follow-up to the conference.\r\nPreparations involved extensive consultations within\r\nthe Council and with the management of the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, the WTO, and the executive\r\ndirectors of the World Bank. Informal hearings with\r\nmembers of civil society and the business sector were\r\nalso held in March 2003.\r\nI am very pleased with the outcome of the\r\nmeeting, both in form and in substance. As to form, we\r\nwere able to attract a very high level of\r\nintergovernmental representation of the main\r\nmultilateral stakeholders, including the Chairman of\r\nthe Development Committee. A representative of the\r\nWTO intergovernmental machinery participated in the\r\nmeeting for the first time since the spring meetings\r\nwere initiated in 1998. The President of the General\r\nAssembly also participated, as did a significant number\r\nof executive directors of the World Bank and the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund. Also attending were\r\nmembers of the community of non-governmental\r\norganizations and the business sector.\r\nOn the substance, we had a very productive\r\ninteractive dialogue on the progress achieved and the\r\nobstacles encountered in the application of the\r\ncommitments contained in the Monterrey Consensus.\r\nIn summary, this yearly gathering strengthened the\r\nintergovernmental cooperation of the Council with its\r\nkey counterparts in Washington and Geneva. The\r\ndiscussions also focused increasingly on major themes\r\nin the Monterrey Consensus, which proved very\r\nproductive.\r\nWhen the high-level dialogue of the Assembly on\r\nfinancing for development meets on 29 October, it will\r\nbe able to build on the discussions of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council joint meeting with the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the WTO. The outcome of the spring\r\nmeeting is reflected in the summary of the President,\r\nwhich was welcomed by the Council at its substantive\r\nsession.\r\nLet me now turn to the outcome of the\r\nsubstantive session of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. As I have already stated, I feel that 2003 has\r\nbeen a successful year for the Council, and one rich in\r\ninnovations.\r\nFirst, the Economic and Social Council responded\r\nwell to its crucial role in examining development\r\npolicies during its high-level segment. The segment\r\nfocused mainly on promoting an integrated approach to\r\nrural development in developing countries for poverty\r\neradication and sustainable development. The Council\r\ngave important policy directions on how rural\r\ndevelopment could best help achieve the medium-term\r\ngoals and other internationally agreed development\r\ngoals. It also called for a new integrated approach to\r\nrural development, one that built on major United\r\nNations conferences and summits since Rio, bringing\r\ntogether the social, economic and environmental\r\ndimensions of development. The ministerial declaration\r\nadopted by the Council highlighted the fundamental\r\nimpact of international cooperation and market access\r\non rural development.\r\nThe focus of the Council’s ministerial declaration\r\non a multi-sectoral approach and on partnerships was\r\nmirrored in the attendance at that segment. Heads of\r\nUnited Nations agencies, ministers and policymakers\r\nfrom various sectors joined with non-governmental\r\norganizations and business sector representatives in the\r\ndebate, round tables and related events. A United\r\nNations public-private alliance was launched in\r\nresponse to the ministerial declaration. This alliance\r\nencourages business approaches that promote economic\r\nand social advancement and profitable investment in\r\nrural areas, starting with Madagascar as the first pilot\r\ncountry. It can be said generally that the Economic and\r\nSocial Council put rural development back on the\r\ninternational agenda after a period of relative neglect\r\nby Governments and their development partners.\r\nThe Council also exercised with renewed\r\ndynamism its role in development cooperation. The\r\noperational activities segment is becoming a meeting\r\nplace for the world of development cooperation. A\r\nselect and influential mix of policymakers, bilateral\r\ncooperation agencies representatives of the\r\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment’s Development Assistance Committee,\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nthe United Nations, its funds and programmes and its\r\ncountry teams and civil society gathered in Geneva.\r\nThere were panels that were able to carry out\r\nexceptionally frank discussions on difficult issues, such\r\nas the lessons learned from the United Nations\r\nsystem’s evaluations of its activities and, crucially, the\r\nfunding situation of United Nations development\r\norganizations. Many innovative ideas emerged.\r\nReflection on budgeting of financial resources might\r\nalso contribute to the follow-up to the Monterrey\r\nConference. This dialogue will continue as we prepare\r\nfor the triennial comprehensive policy review on\r\noperational activities for development that the General\r\nAssembly will conduct next year. The resolution\r\nadopted by the segment also contains detailed guidance\r\nfor preparing that review.\r\nThis year’s humanitarian affairs segment was also\r\none of the best, since the segment was created as part\r\nof the first phase of the Secretary-General’s reform.\r\nPanels also brought new ideas to the table on issues\r\nsuch as the transition from relief to development,\r\nhumanitarian financing and HIV/AIDS-related\r\nemergencies. For example, considerable attention was\r\npaid to the high risks involved in transition and to the\r\nneed for flexible transitional funding mechanisms that\r\nwould enable the simultaneous financing of relief and\r\ndevelopment. Member States reached agreement on an\r\naction-oriented resolution, which is now being\r\nfollowed up by the humanitarian agencies. The\r\nresolution contains a new and ambitious agenda on\r\nhumanitarian financing for the humanitarian\r\ncommunity, as well as for the donors and recipients.\r\nAt its coordination segment, the Council built on\r\nthe recently adopted General Assembly resolution on\r\nthe coordinated implementation of conferences. The\r\nCouncil decided to undertake informal consultations,\r\nstarting next year, to develop a multi-year programme\r\nfor its coordination segment. As Members know, the\r\nAssembly has decided that the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil should review the progress made in\r\nimplementing conferences annually by focusing on a\r\ncommon cross-sectoral thematic issue at its\r\ncoordination segment. At its next session, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council will continue to reflect\r\non how best to implement the decisions of the\r\nAssembly on this issue.\r\nThe Council has added a new dimension to its\r\nwork over the past year through the creation of ad hoc\r\nadvisory groups on African countries emerging from\r\nconflict, for which the guidelines of the General\r\nAssembly were followed. Members will recall that\r\nresolution 55/217, on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa, had requested the Economic\r\nand Social Council to consider creating such groups\r\nwith a view to assessing the needs of the country’s\r\nconcerned and elaborating a long-term programme of\r\nsupport. The Council created two of these groups —\r\none on Guinea-Bissau in 2002 and the other on\r\nBurundi in 2003, at the request of the respective\r\ncountries’ authorities.\r\nThat initiative, although recent, has proven to be\r\na useful tool to gather major development partners,\r\nincluding the United Nations system, the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and donors to study jointly the\r\nneeds of these countries. The groups promote a broad\r\napproach to problems related to the transition and the\r\nrecovery process and to avoid a relapse into conflict. I\r\ntrust that by so doing, the groups will contribute to this\r\ncomprehensive approach to conflict prevention and\r\npost-conflict peace-building, as requested by the\r\nAssembly.\r\nDuring the general segment, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council held a meeting with the Chairpersons of\r\nall its functional commissions. Constructive proposals\r\nemerged from this session, particularly with a view to\r\nimproving coordination among the commissions.\r\nI have made some suggestions to the members of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council on how we can\r\nimprove our oversight and management of the\r\nCouncil’s subsidiary bodies. We will discuss these\r\nsuggestions more fully when the substantive session\r\nreconvenes. Of course, we look at this process within\r\nthe context of the broader reform launched by the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nSeveral other important decisions were made. For\r\nexample, the Council provided guidance on the\r\npreparation of the General Assembly high-level\r\nmeeting on HIV/AIDS, held on 22 September. The\r\nCouncil paved the way for the General Assembly to\r\nadmit a new specialized agency into the United Nations\r\nfamily by approving a draft relationship agreement\r\nwith the World Tourism Organization. This new\r\nspecialized agency can make an important contribution,\r\nparticularly as we search for innovative ways to\r\nmobilize resources for the development of poor\r\ncountries. The Council also reviewed the work of its\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICT)\r\nTask Force. The Task Force, created in response to\r\nEconomic and Social Council work on ICT in 2000, is\r\nwell positioned to continue to promote ICT policies for\r\ndevelopment and to contribute to the preparations for\r\nthe two phases of the World Summit on the Information\r\nSociety.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council further\r\nreviewed the implementation of the Brussels\r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed\r\nCountries. It sent a strong message that progress must\r\nbe accelerated. It will devote its high-level segment\r\nnext year to resource mobilization and the creation of\r\nan enabling environment for poverty reduction in the\r\nframework of the implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction. The discussion will continue during the\r\ncoordination segment, which will have as one of its\r\nthemes the work of the United Nations system on rural\r\ndevelopment, with due consideration being given to the\r\nleast developed countries. I hope that all the Members\r\nUnited Nations and all parts of the United Nations\r\nsystem will take an active part in preparing for the\r\nhigh-level segment. More than an event, it should be\r\nthe culmination of an intense preparatory process, and\r\nlead to concrete advances for the least developed\r\ncountries. The theme of the segment — the least\r\ndeveloped countries — will also help the Council to\r\nestablish a closer link with the African Union summit\r\nmeeting.\r\nThe coordination segment in 2004 will also\r\nreview the implementation of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil’s agreed conclusions of 1997 on\r\nmainstreaming a gender perspective into all policies\r\nand programmes in the United Nations system. I hope\r\nthat United Nations system agencies will consider that\r\nto be a target date for the achievement of concrete\r\nresults in mainstreaming gender in their work.\r\nIn conclusion, the Economic and Social Council\r\nhas carried out extensive and productive work in the\r\ndischarge of its coordination and oversight functions\r\nand policies. I can affirm with confidence that the\r\nCouncil is gaining both in effectiveness and in vitality\r\nin its role as the central strategic body in the United\r\nNations system for promoting policy coherence and\r\nstrengthening system-wide cooperation to achieve our\r\ncommon goals. We have come a long way, although we\r\nstill have some distance to go to meet the challenges of\r\nthe twenty-first century. The progress we have made\r\nthus far, however, encourages me to end my statement\r\non an optimistic note: we are moving in the right\r\ndirection.\r\nMr. Bennouna (Morocco) (spoke in French):\r\nAmbassador Rosenthal, President of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, has just given us a comprehensive\r\nbriefing on the work done by that body, particularly on\r\nthe substantive session in Geneva. As Chairman of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China, my country participated\r\nactively during that meeting and contributed to its\r\nsuccessful outcome. We fully agree with Mr.\r\nRosenthal’s comments and conclusions, and I\r\ncongratulate him and the Vice-Presidents on their\r\nwork.\r\nAmbassador Rosenthal has sought to revitalize\r\nthe Economic and Social Council — an important\r\nCharter organ — and I believe that he should be able to\r\nfeel a sense of satisfaction in his work in promoting the\r\nessential functions of that organ.\r\nI should like to recall — and this point has been\r\nmade before — that in the economic and social field it\r\nis the Council that is mandated by the Charter to\r\nprovide coherence to the work done by the United\r\nNations system — the family of the United Nations: all\r\nof the agencies and bodies working in specialized\r\nfields, which, unfortunately, sometimes lack the\r\nholistic vision that is necessary, particularly in today’s\r\nglobalized world. I believe that today it is the\r\nEconomic and Social Council that must carry out that\r\nwork, which is much more complex now than when the\r\nCharter was adopted.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to say that\r\nthe work that General Assembly President Hunte is\r\ncurrently carrying out to revitalize the activities of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, so as to modernize it and help it to\r\nconfront the challenges of the twenty-first century,\r\nmust be accompanied by the reform of the Economic\r\nand Social Council, so that that body can provide\r\nguidelines to all of the specialized agencies. Work is\r\nunder way, but it has not yet been completed and must\r\ncontinue.\r\nThe Group of 77 participated actively in what is\r\ncalled the operational activities segment of Economic\r\nand Social Council. Operational activities are all of the\r\nactivities of the system that make it possible for us to\r\nact in the developing countries — the poor countries —\r\nto promote development and reduce poverty. Within the\r\nEconomic and Social Council we have noted that all of\r\nthe developed countries are willing to give more\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nweight to those operational activities. But in order for\r\nus to give them more importance, secure predictable\r\nfinancial resources must be made available to enable\r\nthe United Nations system to discharge its work in the\r\nfield. Clearly — this is no secret — these resources are\r\ncurrently insufficient. It could even be said that it is\r\nhard to imagine that an organization such as the United\r\nNations Development Programme should have only\r\nsome $700 million annually to help all of the poor\r\ncountries in the world.\r\nOf course there is expertise and certain donor\r\nactivities that need to be legitimized, but these\r\nresources are not enough. We therefore await with\r\ngreat interest the report that will be provided by the\r\nSecretary-General to be submitted at the fifty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly on the question of\r\nfinancing operational activities, as well as the triennial\r\npolicy review that is set for that time. We hope that by\r\nnext year a substantive debate will take place on\r\nfinancing for development.\r\nWe also take note with satisfaction of the work\r\ndone by the Economic and Social Council at its second\r\nsegment, the humanitarian segment. The resolution\r\nadopted by the Economic and Social Council this year\r\nstrengthens coordination of emergency humanitarian\r\nassistance provided by the various stakeholders within\r\nthe United Nations system. The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to the Economic and Social Council and to the\r\nGeneral Assembly will reflect progress made in the\r\nfollow-up to Council resolution 2003/5, and we hope\r\nthat in this manner we will be able to make progress in\r\nstrengthening the coordination of the entire United\r\nNations system in the humanitarian field.\r\nSpeaking of the humanitarian field, I would like\r\nto say how shaken we were by the tragedy that\r\noccurred in Iraq on 19 August 2003, which cost the\r\nlives of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and a number of\r\nworthy staff members of the United Nations and which\r\nrequires us to be even more vigilant in coordinating our\r\nwork in the humanitarian field and in the safety and\r\nsecurity that must be given to all United Nations staff\r\nmembers.\r\nI will mention another matter we are particularly\r\nconcerned with and where I think we have made a\r\nmajor contribution. That is the question of the\r\nintegrated follow-up and implementation of\r\ncommitments undertaken at major United Nations\r\nconferences since the Millennium Declaration was\r\nadopted in 2000, including the United Nations\r\nConference on Sustainable Development and the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, as well as the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO) conference in Doha on international trade.\r\nAs you know, the adoption by the General\r\nAssembly in June 2003, of resolution 57/270 B was a\r\nmajor achievement which will be discussed in the\r\nSecond Committee as well as in plenary meetings. We\r\ndo hope that in 2005, which is in two years time, we\r\nwill have a summit meeting on development that will\r\nassess the progress made in poverty reduction and\r\neducation in poor countries. Furthermore, we hope\r\nthere will be interesting mechanisms to follow up the\r\nfinancing for development, as they were envisaged at\r\nMonterrey.\r\nIt is impossible to resolve the issue of financing\r\nfor development unless there is a dialogue between our\r\nOrganization, the United Nations in New York and the\r\nBretton Woods institutions located in Washington,\r\nD.C., including the World Bank and the International\r\nMonetary Fund (IMF). In spring 2003, Economic and\r\nSocial Council President Rosenthal moved this\r\ndialogue forward. We had a very interesting session\r\nhere in New York, but we want to move beyond mere\r\nintellectual discussion so that together we may draft\r\noperational programmes. We believe, and I speak on\r\nbehalf of the G-77, that the World Bank and the IMF\r\nneed the United Nations and the United Nations needs\r\nthe IMF and the World Bank for the same reasons. This\r\ndialogue therefore needs to take place as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nFor this reason, the Economic and Social Council\r\nneeds to move forward with its mission in this area, the\r\ngoal being the implementation of the commitments\r\nundertaken in Monterrey. On 29 October 2003 there\r\nwill be a high level dialogue on financing for\r\ndevelopment with the participation of the finance\r\nministers. Here again, we hope this will provide an\r\nopportunity to move this major question forward.\r\nI now come to one question mentioned by the\r\nPresident of the Council — the question of the least\r\ndeveloped countries, the poorest of the poor. The\r\nPresident has just reminded us that the Council decided\r\nto devote next year, through a high level debate, to the\r\nquestion of helping to fund the least developed\r\ncountries and helping to implement the Programme of\r\nAction for the Least Developed Countries, which was\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nadopted in 2001 by the Third United Nations\r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries, held in\r\nBrussels.\r\nThe G-77 and China would like to take this\r\nopportunity once again to appeal to all donor countries\r\nand all multilateral organizations to redouble their\r\nefforts in order to implement the commitments they\r\nundertook to assist the least developed countries\r\ntowards growth and development.\r\nWe hope we will be able to participate actively at\r\nthe Economic and Social Council meeting on the least\r\ndeveloped countries next year and that we will be able\r\nto advance implementation of the Brussels programme\r\nof action. The meeting that took place in Geneva this\r\nyear showed, unfortunately, that the Brussels\r\nProgramme of Action has not made much progress. I\r\nthink we must draw that conclusion and, therefore, if\r\nthe Brussels Programme made no progress, it was\r\nbecause there was a lack of adequate political will to\r\nhelp it move forward.\r\nAs Chairman of the G-77, Morocco has made the\r\ncause of the least developed countries one of its top\r\npriorities; that is why we held a ministerial meeting on\r\nthe least developed countries in Rabat this year.\r\nOne of the last points, which was central to the\r\nEconomic and Social Council debates in Geneva, was\r\nthe subject of rural development in the developing\r\ncountries and the question of agriculture and the\r\ncountryside. I participated in the round tables and\r\nplenary meetings concerning rural development and it\r\nwas a very high quality debate. Not only did the\r\nrepresentatives of Governments take part, but also\r\nprominent people from civil society and stakeholders\r\nfrom the countries concerned. Obstacles to rural\r\ndevelopment were identified and some possible\r\nsolutions were proposed. I wish to recall that the\r\nobstacles to rural development continue to include\r\naccess to the markets of the developed countries,\r\nincluding agricultural product markets from the poor\r\ncountries to the developed countries.\r\nThe irregular subsidies that the wealthy countries\r\ncontinue to provide to their agricultural producers\r\nultimately threatens to ruin the agricultural sector in\r\nthe poor countries. The cotton scandal is well known\r\nand was in fact brought up at the Cancún meeting of\r\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) in September.\r\nThat meeting left us greatly frustrated because the\r\nposition of the developing countries was unfortunately\r\nnot heard. But we hope that the dialogue will be\r\nresumed. A ministerial WTO declaration was adopted\r\nat Geneva, and we truly hope that it will enable us to\r\nredouble efforts to promote the agricultural products of\r\nthe developing world. As is well known, development\r\nand growth begin with agriculture.\r\nFinally, allow me to recall a number of problems\r\nthat return every year: the lack of direct foreign\r\ninvestment, the instability of commodity markets and\r\nthe terrible debt burden. They prevent rural\r\ndevelopment in the developing countries.\r\nIn conclusion, the Group of 77 and China\r\nexpresses once again its gratitude to the President of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council and his team and to\r\nall who have contributed to the success of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council’s substantive session in\r\nGeneva. We hope that the Council will also benefit\r\nfrom the encouraging positive wind of reform blowing\r\nat the United Nations, which was reflected in the\r\ninterventions of all the heads of State or Government\r\nduring the present session of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Spatafora (Italy): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the European Union. The acceding\r\ncountries Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia,\r\nSlovenia have aligned themselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union holds that the revitalization\r\nand reinforcement of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil’s role to be of the utmost importance. This\r\nobjective, reaffirmed by the heads of State and\r\nGovernment in the Millennium Declaration three years\r\nago, and at the recent ministerial segment of the\r\ngeneral debate, needs to be vigorously pursued. We\r\nwelcome the progress made in strengthening the\r\nCouncil’s role. At the same time, we believe that much\r\nremains to be done to give the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil its rightful role in the United Nation system, as\r\nit has evolved since its inception. Here, I would like\r\nto say that we fully share and support what\r\nAmbassador Bennouna has just said about the need\r\nfor the revitalization exercise — the rethinking and\r\nstrengthening exercise — to apply not only to the\r\nGeneral Assembly but also to the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. I fully support and share that belief as a\r\nrepresentative of the European Union and of Italy.\r\nThe European Union would like to highlight\r\nsome of the major areas in which the role of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council can be strengthened.\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nFirst, with respect to reinforcing the system-wide\r\ncoordination role: the European Union is encouraged\r\nby the outcome of the Ad Hoc Working Group of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the follow-up to the outcomes of\r\nthe major conferences, as reflected in resolution\r\n57/270 B.\r\nThere is broad consensus on the pivotal role of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council in system-wide\r\ncoordination and in promoting the integrated,\r\ncoordinated implementation of and follow-up to the\r\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits and in\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. This\r\nwill allow the Council to assume the responsibilities\r\ninvested in it by the Millennium Summit, the\r\nMonterrey Consensus, the Johannesburg Summit and\r\nall the conferences and special sessions of the General\r\nAssembly throughout the 1990s. We welcome the\r\ndecision by the Economic and Social Council in\r\nGeneva last July to finalize the list of cross-cutting\r\nthemes and the multi-year work programme before its\r\nnext substantive session in 2004.\r\nAt the same time, we consider the activities of the\r\nfunctional commissions of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil to be of the utmost importance. They can\r\ninject great vitality into United Nations debates and\r\nactivities, as demonstrated by the outcome of the recent\r\neleventh session of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. The Commission’s new path shows how\r\ninnovation can lead to better targeted and more\r\nproductive actions. Such actions keep the United\r\nNations at the focus of the initiatives and attention of\r\nGovernments, civil society and other stakeholders. To\r\nthat end, openness to innovation in identifying the most\r\neffective and result-oriented work methods is a must.\r\nEmphasis must be placed on result-oriented rather than\r\ndebate-oriented work. That is the way forward. The\r\nGeneral Assembly has asked the various commissions\r\nto continue to review their methods. We have high\r\nhopes for the results that this process will deliver.\r\nIn his report on the coordination segment of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council (E/2003/67), the\r\nSecretary-General indicated areas that deserve more\r\nattention. In particular, we agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s suggestion to focus on the relationship\r\nbetween the Economic and Social Council and the\r\nregional commissions and on the need to build a closer\r\nrelationship with specialized agencies and inter-agency\r\nbodies to ensure consistency and coherence in the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nWhat we need is to ensure coherence and consistency.\r\nAmbassador Bennouna emphasized that aspect, as well.\r\nThe Secretary-General has suggested that\r\n“the role of the Economic and Social Council —\r\nand the role of the United Nations as a whole in\r\neconomic and social affairs, including its\r\nrelationship to the Bretton Woods institutions —\r\nneeds to be rethought and reinvigorated”.\r\n(A/58/PV.7, p. 4)\r\nThe European Union believes that the\r\nrelationship between the United Nations, the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and World Trade Organization has\r\nimproved substantially: the preparatory process of the\r\nMonterrey Conference on Financing for Development\r\nshowed the tremendous potential for a relationship\r\namong different organizations working within their\r\nmandates to achieve a common outcome. We must\r\nwork hard to keep up that spirit, using that type of\r\nmethodology to implement our common agenda for\r\ndevelopment. However, I have to say that we have not\r\nyet achieved the level of synergy and cooperation that\r\nshould be expected. We need to ensure greater\r\ncoherence and consistency in that area, as well.\r\nThe enhancement of the role of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council largely depends on its ability to address\r\nissues of major relevance to Governments and public\r\nopinion. The membership has a great responsibility in\r\nestablishing the themes on which we have to focus our\r\naction since they are the outcome of a negotiated\r\nprocess. At the same time, we must not refrain from\r\nallowing the Economic and Social Council to be more\r\npro-active on important issues, convening ad hoc\r\nmeetings whenever justified by the issue’s relevance.\r\nAs an example, the Economic and Social Council\r\ncould, if needed, devote more of its work to country-\r\nspecific situations or crises.\r\nThe humanitarian segment of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council last July highlighted another area in\r\nwhich more action is needed. The Council plays a\r\nmajor role in strengthening the coordination of United\r\nNations emergency humanitarian assistance. In that\r\nrespect, Assembly resolution 57/270 B gives clear\r\nguidance to all stakeholders.\r\nThe European Union believes that humanitarian\r\nassistance should be provided in ways that support\r\nrecovery and long-term development and promote self-\r\nreliance among affected populations and sustainability\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nof humanitarian efforts. In complex emergencies a\r\nsound transitional phase and well-coordinated and\r\nappropriately sequenced relief and development\r\ninterventions can help prevent the recurrence of\r\nconflicts, which should also be an objective. In\r\nwelcoming the United Nations work in this area, we\r\nbelieve that the Economic and Social Council must\r\ncontinue to focus on the challenges of the transition\r\nfrom relief to development.\r\nAs for post-conflict situations, the European\r\nUnion is pleased by the establishment of the Ad Hoc\r\nAdvisory Group on African Countries emerging from\r\nconflict. The first experience with Guinea-Bissau and\r\nthe recent establishment of the Ad Hoc Advisory\r\nGroup on Burundi show that opportunities exist to\r\nimprove the role of the Economic and Social Council\r\nin filling the gap between relief efforts and long-term\r\nreconstruction and development. We believe that this\r\nexperience will provide useful lessons for enhancing\r\ncoordination between the Economic and Social Council\r\nand the Security Council in addressing the post-conflict\r\nchallenges faced by African countries.\r\nFinally, regarding management issues, the\r\ninitiative of the President of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, Ambassador Rosenthal, of presenting a\r\nmemorandum on his recent experience in Geneva\r\ndeserves our strongest attention. He has made a number\r\nof suggestions on how to improve the working methods\r\nof the Economic and Social Council in a way that\r\nwould enable it to better discharge its statutory duties.\r\nThe European Union strongly appreciates\r\nAmbassador Rosenthal’s initiative and what he stressed\r\nin his statement a few minutes ago. We cannot simply\r\ncontinue to repeat that the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil has a pivotal role in the United Nations\r\nsystem, while ignoring that it cannot perform many of\r\nits tasks efficiently because of its working methods.\r\nHis idea of improving the ability of the general\r\nsegment to carry out management tasks deserves our\r\ncareful attention: it may not be a major reform, but it\r\nmay well produce major results — and what we are\r\nseeking are results. The European Union encourages\r\nthe President of the Economic and Social Council,\r\nAmbassador Rosenthal, to continue the process he has\r\nundertaken.\r\nMr. Zaki (Pakistan): We welcome the report of\r\nEconomic and Social Council (A/58/3) for 2003. We\r\nalso commend the President of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, Mr. Rosenthal, and other members of\r\nthe Bureau for so ably steering the work of the Council\r\nduring this year.\r\nThe Pakistan delegation associates itself with the\r\nstatement made by the representative of Morocco on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council, as we all\r\nknow, is one of the most important organs of the\r\nUnited Nations and is vested with the responsibility of\r\ncontributing towards the promotion of higher standards\r\nof living, full employment and conditions of economic\r\nand social progress and development. These are the\r\nsublime ideals set forth for us by the framers of the\r\nCharter.\r\nDuring the past year, the Council held a series of\r\nuseful meetings and discussions at its annual\r\nsubstantive session in Geneva, as well as at the spring\r\nmeeting of the Economic and Social Council with the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\r\nOrganization, in pursuit of these objectives.\r\nWhile many useful recommendations emerged\r\nfrom these meetings, particularly at the high-level\r\nsegment, which was devoted to developing an\r\nintegrated approach to rural development, a lot more\r\nneeds to be done to make the world a happier home for\r\nthe poor, underdeveloped and marginalized people.\r\nToday’s debate provides us with an opportunity to\r\nreview the extent to which the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil has been able to achieve the objectives it has\r\nset for itself.\r\nThe Council is the central forum for the system-\r\nwide coordination of United Nations activities in the\r\neconomic and social fields. Lately, it has also been\r\ngiven an important responsibility for the integrated and\r\ncoordinated follow-up to and implementation of the\r\noutcomes of major United Nations conferences. It is,\r\ntherefore, imperative that we explore all avenues to\r\nbring greater vitality and effectiveness to the work of\r\nthe Council. We should particularly focus on improving\r\nthe Council’s coordination role vis-à-vis the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, specialized agencies and United\r\nNations funds and programmes.\r\nOf greatest importance is the Council’s role to\r\ncontribute towards creating conditions that will\r\nstimulate economic growth and development in the\r\nunderdeveloped and developing world. For this\r\npurpose, a number of important steps need to be taken\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nto ensure, first, that political commitment exists for\r\nachieving the agreed official development assistance\r\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of developed countries’ gross\r\nnational product; secondly, that ambitious efforts are\r\nmade for debt write-off and debt restructuring, not only\r\nfor the heavily indebted poor countries, but also for the\r\nlow-income countries with a high growth and demand\r\npotential; thirdly, that required actions are taken for\r\ncapacity-building and trade growth in the developing\r\ncountries; and, fourthly, that bold political actions are\r\ntaken to create innovative ways of financing\r\ndevelopment on concessional terms.\r\nTogether with larger financial and investment\r\ninflows into the developing countries, a more\r\ndeliberate effort is also required to restore trade and\r\nexports as the engine of growth in developing\r\ncountries. But this can only happen if there is a genuine\r\nendeavour to enable the developing countries to utilize\r\ntrade for growth, rather than enforcing a globalization\r\nthat further marginalizes those countries and locks\r\nthem into patterns of dependency and\r\nunderdevelopment.\r\nWhat the world needs at this crucial juncture is\r\naction that would turn the talk about free markets, trade\r\nliberalization and the outcome of Doha Development\r\nRound into reality. The collapse of the trade talks at\r\nCancún is a wake-up call for those who believe that the\r\ndeveloping countries will accept persisting trade\r\ninequities masked by slogans and symbolism.\r\nThe failure at Cancún was the result of what\r\nhappened in Doha, where the major trading countries\r\nrefused to offer the promised concessions on\r\ndevelopment-related issues. The Declaration presented\r\nat Cancún did not address the major concerns of the\r\ndeveloping countries. To avoid recurrence of such\r\nfailures, the specific areas of interest to developing\r\ncountries should remain at the core of multilateral trade\r\nnegotiations, such as improving market access, special\r\nand differential treatment and the phasing out of\r\nagricultural subsidies.\r\nThe creation of a just and equitable international\r\ntrading and finance system is the most important route\r\nto the revival of global economic growth and\r\ndevelopment and the realization of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, particularly the goal of achieving\r\na 50 per cent reduction of poverty by 2015.\r\nFor its part, the Economic and Social Council\r\nmust play its role in creating conditions for correcting\r\nthe imbalances in the world of trade and finance and\r\nregistering tangible progress towards the achievement\r\nof Millennium Development Goals. These ambitious\r\nbut imperative goals can be achieved only with a\r\ngenuine political commitment on the part of all\r\ncountries.\r\nIn the social sector, the Council is rendering\r\nvaluable contributions, from the promotion of human\r\nrights to gender mainstreaming to achieving social\r\ndevelopment. The high-level segment this year\r\nunderscored the fact that sustainable development and\r\npoverty eradication cannot be achieved without\r\nfocusing on rural development, as three-fourths of the\r\nworld’s poor live in rural areas. In this context, the\r\nempowerment of rural women assumes particular\r\nimportance.\r\nThe Government is actively pursuing a policy of\r\nfar-reaching reforms to reduce and eventually eradicate\r\npoverty, especially in the rural areas, where 75 per cent\r\nof our people live. We are following an integrated\r\napproach that covers the economic, social and\r\nenvironmental dimensions, with emphasis on gender\r\nfactors.\r\nWe in Pakistan have taken several concrete steps\r\nto ensure greater participation of women in the political\r\nprocess, with a view to achieving the empowerment of\r\nwomen and gender equality. Thirty-three per cent of\r\nseats in all local bodies have been reserved for women.\r\nConsequently, more than 40,000 women councillors,\r\nmostly in rural areas, have been elected across the\r\ncountry. Besides political empowerment, steps have\r\nbeen taken in the economic and social areas, such as\r\ncompulsory and free primary education for all,\r\nparticularly for girl children in rural areas; provision of\r\naffordable health care, including reproductive health;\r\nand equal opportunities for employment, vocational\r\ntraining and microcredit.\r\nThis is a real, peaceful revolution in which the\r\nGovernment and civil society are partners. There is\r\ngreat promise for the future, for the promotion of social\r\nand economic progress and the protection of human\r\nrights, hopefully leading to the building of a more\r\nhumane society based on justice and the rule of law.\r\nBefore I close, I would like also to comment on\r\nthe proposals presented by the President of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council in his informal paper to\r\nstrengthen the work of that body. We thank him for his\r\nthought-provoking ideas and believe that they merit\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nserious consideration. We are particularly attracted to\r\nthe idea of rationalizing the work of the general\r\nsegment. We look forward to discussing these and\r\nother ideas, with a view to strengthening the Council.\r\nA revitalized Economic and Social Council can make a\r\nreal contribution to implementing its agenda of\r\neconomic and social reform as well as the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nMr. Drobnjak (Croatia): At the outset, let me\r\ncommend the President of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil for his presentation of the report for the work\r\nof the Council in 2003. This is the third time that the\r\nreport of the Council has been considered in the\r\nGeneral Assembly and its committees, and in this\r\nregard we particularly welcome it. This reporting\r\nprocedure enhances coordination and cooperation\r\nbetween two main United Nations bodies. However, let\r\nme reiterate what we said during Croatia’s presidency\r\nof the Council last year — a substantive report, rather\r\nthan a technical one, would be more conducive to our\r\ndeliberations within the framework of the overall\r\nreform of the Organization.\r\nWe welcome the more efficient relationship\r\nbetween the Bretton Woods institutions and the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO), which can serve as the\r\nbasis for broader-based and more inclusive\r\ninternational decision-making. In this regard, we look\r\nforward to an even more substantive and interactive\r\nspring meeting between the Council, the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and the WTO.\r\nAllow me briefly to address the issue of United\r\nNations humanitarian and disaster relief assistance,\r\nincluding special economic assistance. I will focus my\r\nremarks on the part of the world where Croatia is\r\nsituated — Central and South-eastern Europe. The\r\nUnited Nations should increase its efforts to ensure a\r\nsmooth transition from the provision of humanitarian\r\nand reconstruction assistance to development activities\r\nin post-conflict environments. A number of the remarks\r\ncontained in the report entitled “Economic assistance\r\nto the Eastern European States affected by the\r\ndevelopments in the Balkans” have little value in\r\ncomparison terms, because the so-called successes of\r\nthe central-market economy that existed prior to 1990\r\ncannot be compared with the real values of liberalized\r\nmarket economies, regardless of the impact of war.\r\nWith the goal of streamlining efforts to stabilize\r\nSouth-east Europe, the Stability Pact for South-eastern\r\nEurope was established as an overarching framework\r\nfor simultaneous development in the fields of security,\r\neconomic recovery and the strengthening of\r\ndemocracy. Even though it did not attract as much aid\r\nand assistance as had been hoped, it produced tangible\r\nresults in all three fields, contributing significantly to\r\nenhanced stability in that part of the world. The United\r\nNations, as one of the participants in the Stability\r\nPact’s work, did not exercise its role to the fullest\r\npossible extent. Lessons learned — successes and\r\nfailures alike — could be put to good use in other parts\r\nof the world that are plagued with problems relating to\r\npost-conflict stability, economic recovery and\r\nconfidence-building.\r\nHumanitarian and reconstruction aid, no matter\r\nhow generous and far-reaching, cannot match the\r\nstrategic importance of foreign direct investment. The\r\nessential prerequisite for foreign direct investment is a\r\nstable and democratic environment with stimulating\r\nmacroeconomic measures, which is often lacking in\r\ncountries in dire need of such investment. Therefore,\r\ndevelopment assistance, especially in the areas of\r\ncapacity- and institution-building, should closely\r\nfollow humanitarian assistance and post-conflict\r\ncountry rebuilding. This is the best possible investment\r\nin the stability of the countries and regions concerned.\r\nIt is a weapon in the fight against a terrorism-infested\r\nenvironment — a weapon as powerful as a well-\r\nconducted military action.\r\nLet me also point out under this item that my\r\ndelegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral entitled “Participation of volunteers, ‘White\r\nHelmets’, in the activities of the United Nations in the\r\nfield of humanitarian relief, rehabilitation and technical\r\ncooperation for development”. As a former recipient\r\ncountry, we are well aware of the important work of the\r\n“White Helmets” and other United Nations volunteers.\r\nWe join those delegations that are ready to consider a\r\nbetter integration of volunteer activities into the United\r\nNations system in order to be able to profit from within\r\nthe existing resources of the opportunities offered by a\r\nwell-established system.\r\nWith regard to enhanced cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and all relevant partners, in particular\r\nthe private sector, my delegation welcomes the report\r\nof the Secretary-General and supports further\r\ncooperation in this field. We commend the role that the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development has played\r\nin enhancing the task of partnerships for the United\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nNations system in support of United Nations goals. We\r\nsupport the recommendation made in the report of\r\nbringing under the same umbrella the Global Compact\r\nOffice and the United Nations Fund for International\r\nPartnerships into one Partnership Office, within\r\nexisting resources.\r\nAs we move into a phase of implementation of\r\nthese complex and interrelated goals, it is essential that\r\nthe United Nations show that it can provide practical\r\norientations on issues that are of the utmost concern to\r\npeople everywhere. A more substantive and interactive\r\nrelationship should be developed between the\r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council, as it\r\nwould provide practical orientation to the international\r\ncommunity in the follow-up to major conferences.\r\nTherefore, it would be important to maximize synergy\r\nbetween the Economic and Social Council and the\r\nSecond and Third Committees, as well as between the\r\nBureaux of the two Committees. To that end, we look\r\nforward to participating in the discussion of the\r\nindicative programme of work of the Second\r\nCommittee to have it reflect the outcomes of recent\r\nmajor conferences and summits.\r\nFinally, let me conclude by saying that, during the\r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly, there has\r\nbeen a sense of expectation that this work in\r\nstrengthening the Organization will be energized by\r\nengaging in a spirit of constructive dialogue on all of\r\nthe above areas, with a view to strengthening the role\r\nof the United Nations as a leading institution in the\r\nmultilateral arena. The Croatian delegation will try to\r\ncontribute as much as possible towards that end\r\nthrough its Vice-Presidents in the Fourth and Second\r\nCommittees and through an active approach in the\r\nforthcoming debate on the reforms of our Organization.\r\nFinally, I would like to state that Croatia aligns\r\nitself with the statement of the European Union\r\ndelivered this morning by the Italian European Union\r\npresidency.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker\r\nin the debate on this item. The Assembly has thus\r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda\r\nitem 12.\r\nAgenda item 40\r\nStrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian\r\nand disaster relief assistance of the United Nations,\r\nincluding special economic assistance\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/344)\r\n(a) Strengthening of the coordination of emergency\r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/58/89,\r\nA/58/434)\r\n(b) Special economic assistance to individual\r\ncountries or regions\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/58/133,\r\nA/58/244, A/58/225, A/58/273, A/58/280, A/58/285,\r\nA/58/286, A/58/358)\r\n(c) Strengthening of international cooperation and\r\ncoordination of efforts to study, mitigate and\r\nminimize the consequences of the Chernobyl\r\ndisaster\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/332)\r\n(d) Participation of volunteers, “White Helmets”,\r\nin the activities of the United Nations in the\r\nfield of humanitarian relief, rehabilitation and\r\ntechnical cooperation for development\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/320)\r\n(e) Assistance to the Palestinian people\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/88 and\r\nCorr.1)\r\nMr. Bennouna (Morocco): I am very proud to\r\nspeak again on behalf of the Group of 77 and China on\r\nthe very sensitive item on United Nations humanitarian\r\nassistance.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAs members are aware, the question of\r\nstrengthening the coordination of humanitarian and\r\ndisaster relief assistance is an extremely sensitive\r\nissue, on which we ourselves have found it difficult to\r\ncoordinate our action in the Group of 77 (G-77) and\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nChina. Coordination at the global level is indeed\r\ndifficult.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to thank the\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for the documents to\r\nwhich the President has just referred. These documents\r\nsubmitted to us assist us greatly in our efforts to\r\ncoordinate the work of the United Nations in providing\r\nhumanitarian assistance.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China believes particularly\r\nthat the report submitted pursuant to General Assembly\r\nresolution 57/152, on international cooperation in\r\nhumanitarian assistance following natural disasters,\r\nfrom the relief phase to the development phase, is an\r\nessential report. We will focus our statement on that\r\nreport.\r\nWhile it is true that the international community\r\ncan play a very important role in the area of natural\r\ndisasters, I wish to repeat what I said this morning. We\r\ncannot address United Nations humanitarian assistance\r\nwithout recalling how traumatized we all were by the\r\ntragic attack of 19 August, the target of which was the\r\nUnited Nations. It was an attack that, in a way, struck\r\nat the image that we all have of the Organization.\r\nThese tragic events therefore compel us to review our\r\nrole and to channel our work clearly. These events also\r\nprompt us to work to strengthen protection of United\r\nNations staff, associated personnel and local staff, who\r\ndo outstanding work in the field. An international\r\nconvention has been adopted in this regard and is\r\nentering into force. We will now have to work to\r\neffectively protect United Nations personnel\r\neverywhere in the world.\r\nAnother thing that my Group wishes to recall is\r\nthat the United Nations, if it is to be effective, must\r\nreach out to people. It cannot lock itself up in offices or\r\nbehind ramparts. That openness is what United Nations\r\nwork in the field is about.\r\nThe problem of natural disasters is crucially\r\nimportant to the international community, particularly,\r\nto the least developed countries. When these disasters\r\noccur, their impact on affected populations is long\r\nlasting, as it is on economic and social development\r\nand environmental protection. It is therefore up to us to\r\ndetermine how the international community can more\r\neffectively deal with these types of situations, which\r\ncan have a lasting effect on the development of the\r\nleast developed countries.\r\nFor the Group of 77 and China, the principle\r\nguidelines contained in the annex to resolution 46/182\r\nof 19 December 1991 are, and should remain, the basis\r\nof all responses to humanitarian emergency requests\r\nfor assistance. These principles, in fact, should\r\ncontinue to allow us to play a fundamental role in the\r\ndeployment of United Nations humanitarian assistance\r\nand assistance provided by other players, whether non-\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs) or other entities in\r\nthe field.\r\nIn this context, I would like to recall that the\r\nState affected has the primary responsibility in the\r\norganization and development of humanitarian\r\nassistance. It is the affected State’s responsibility, and\r\nit must call for international assistance and accept this\r\nhumanitarian assistance. It has a fundamental role to\r\nplay. But it is important for us, as the United Nations\r\nand the international community, to help such a State\r\nstrengthen its capacities at the national and local levels\r\nand to foster closer cooperation between the affected\r\nState and the United Nations system and other\r\nhumanitarian organizations. The States whose peoples\r\nare in need of emergency humanitarian assistance\r\nshould facilitate the work of the humanitarian\r\norganizations, in particular, by providing security for\r\nthe delivery of food, shelter and medical care.\r\nAs the Secretary-General pointed out in his\r\nreport, we have seen during the last few years a\r\nsignificant increase in the number of natural disasters\r\nof which the poorest countries are the primary victims.\r\nFaced with this fact, the Group of 77 and China\r\nbelieves that it is vital to act first in terms of\r\nprevention. It is, in fact, essential to give priority to\r\nreducing what has been called vulnerability, through a\r\nglobal approach based on a greater effort at\r\ninternational cooperation. This means a strengthening\r\nof capacities, to transfer the appropriate technologies\r\nand to develop a system of advance warning in order to\r\nidentify and predict natural disasters and possible\r\ndisasters of a human origin. There are natural disasters\r\nand disasters that have a human origin.\r\nIn this context, the Group of 77 and China would\r\nlike to reiterate the importance of strengthening\r\ninternational cooperation in all phases of a catastrophe,\r\nranging from initial relief and mitigation to assistance\r\nfor development, through a proper use of multilateral\r\nchannels and the provision of adequate resources.\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nMr. Kirn (Slovenia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThere are countries where, following a natural\r\ndisaster, people sometimes remain in tents for months\r\nand even years. In this context, the Group of 77 and\r\nChina welcomes the fact that the resolution adopted in\r\nthe framework of the Economic and Social Council’s\r\nhumanitarian segment last July particularly encouraged\r\ndonors to allot humanitarian assistance on the basis of\r\nneed, with a view to ensuring a more equitable\r\ndistribution of humanitarian assistance across all\r\nemergencies, including those of a protracted nature.\r\nIt is true that resources are often abundant in\r\nhumanitarian situations that have benefited from wide\r\nmedia coverage. By contrast, significantly less in the\r\nway of resources is provided, unfortunately, to certain\r\ngeographical areas, or when the relief phase gives way\r\nto the development phase.\r\nIt is appropriate to reiterate here that\r\ncontributions for humanitarian assistance should never\r\nbe granted to the detriment of resources that are\r\nprovided as cooperation for development. When I say\r\nthat there is media coverage, I mean that when\r\ntelevision screens show natural disasters, there is\r\nalways a strong reaction from the community. But,\r\nwhen television and other media leave and no longer\r\nshow what is happening, we get the impression that\r\nnothing is happening any longer, whereas obviously\r\npeople’s hardships do continue.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General refers to the\r\ncoordination efforts now underway between the United\r\nNations Development Programme, the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the\r\nsecretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster\r\nReduction. This coordination should be strengthened\r\nwith a view to advancing the implementation of\r\nprovisions related to vulnerability, risk assessment and\r\ndisaster management. All of this is contained in the\r\nPlan of Implementation that was adopted in\r\nJohannesburg at the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment.\r\nI would like at this point to mention the use of\r\nremote-sensing technologies, both in space and land-\r\nbased, which have become very important for the\r\nprediction and mitigation of natural disasters. As we\r\nknow, access to scientific progress in outer space\r\nshould be access for all humankind, because such\r\nresearch — at least, basic research in that category —\r\nis considered to be the heritage of humankind.\r\nUnfortunately, developing countries often do not have\r\naccess this very costly remote-sensing technology. It is\r\ntherefore essential to encourage a transfer to the\r\ndeveloping countries of these technologies that can\r\nsave human lives.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his report, also referred\r\nto the need to take into account the special needs of the\r\nmost vulnerable populations. The Group of 77 and\r\nChina reiterate on this occasion that the international\r\ncommunity must appropriately and on a priority basis\r\ntake into account the specific needs of the least\r\ndeveloped countries affected by natural disasters. This\r\nshould be done in the framework of what I would call a\r\nreal duty to provide assistance, the duty of all those\r\nwho have the means to come to the aid of those who\r\nare in danger. We may call this an obligation, of sorts,\r\nto assist a community in danger.\r\nAs in previous sessions, the Group of 77 and\r\nChina will submit a draft resolution on international\r\ncooperation on humanitarian assistance following\r\nnatural disasters, ranging from relief through\r\ndevelopment. The Group of 77 is delighted at the\r\ngrowing support that this resolution is receiving and\r\nhopes that it will encounter even broader international\r\nconsensus this year. This would constitute a real\r\nmessage of hope for us and numerous people the world\r\nover as they come to believe in this duty of\r\ninternational solidarity.\r\nMr. Spatafora (Italy): I have the honour of\r\nspeaking on behalf of the European Union. The\r\nacceding countries Cyprus, the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland,\r\nSlovakia and Slovenia, the associated countries\r\nBulgaria, Romania and Turkey and the European Free\r\nTrade Association (EFTA) country Iceland, member of\r\nthe European Economic Area, align themselves with\r\nthis statement.\r\nThe European Union sees today’s debate as an\r\nimportant opportunity to focus the attention of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session on\r\nhumanitarian issues: an area where the leading role of\r\nthe United Nations is uncontested and with respect to\r\nwhich the international community and those in need\r\nhave high expectations. I wish to take this opportunity\r\nto renew the European Union’s commitment to\r\nstrengthening United Nations action in this area,\r\nespecially at a time when the number of humanitarian\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\ncrises is increasing and when we are faced with\r\ngrowing challenges in terms of resources, security and\r\naccess.\r\nI wish to express, on behalf of the European\r\nUnion, our sorrow at the deaths of personnel who lost\r\ntheir lives bringing relief to the poor and the needy.\r\nThe safety and security of humanitarian personnel\r\nworking in the field is a key issue for the European\r\nUnion, and must be addressed effectively. In this\r\nregard, we condemn all cases of violence against\r\nhumanitarian personnel, including abductions, such as\r\nthe case of the Médecins Sans Frontières worker Arjan\r\nErkel, abducted in Dagestan in August 2002.\r\nHowever, condemning deliberate attacks on\r\nhumanitarian personnel is not enough. The\r\ninternational community must act jointly and\r\ndecisively to end the culture of impunity wherever it\r\nexists. In this regard, the European Union welcomes\r\nthe Security Council’s adoption of resolution 1502\r\n(2003) on the protection of humanitarian personnel,\r\nand urges States to fully comply with its\r\nrecommendations. The European Union also welcomes\r\nthe Secretary-General’s recent expression of support\r\nwith regard to the issue of security in the field, and\r\nlooks forward to the concrete initiatives that will\r\nfollow the current review phase.\r\nThe European Union is convinced that the\r\nInternational Criminal Court can play an important role\r\nin deterring intentional attacks on humanitarian\r\npersonnel, as well as serious violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law. We warmly welcome the start of the\r\nCourt Prosecutor’s work, and reiterate our full support\r\nfor it.\r\nWhile stressing the need for increased security,\r\nthe European Union also wishes to underline the\r\nimportance of having United Nations staff present in\r\ncrisis situations. The international community expects\r\nthe United Nations to be physically present in order to\r\nprovide not only humanitarian assistance but also\r\nnecessary humanitarian protection for those in need. A\r\ncentral challenge is achieving a balance between\r\nminimizing the security risk and providing a\r\nmeaningful humanitarian presence. We strongly urge\r\nall Governments and parties to armed conflict and\r\nthose in post-conflict situations to cooperate fully with\r\nthe United Nations and other humanitarian agencies\r\nand organizations in providing safe and unimpeded\r\naccess to vulnerable populations.\r\nThe General Assembly must consider several\r\nimportant issues in today’s debate, including\r\nstrengthening the coordination of humanitarian\r\nassistance, as well as specific regional and country\r\nsituations. The European Union would like to see\r\ngreater emphasis on pressing thematic issues and\r\nsituations relevant to the humanitarian community. We\r\nare convinced that the sectoral policies and guidelines\r\nthat the General Assembly is expected to produce\r\nshould also be applicable to specific country situations.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the outcome of\r\nthe humanitarian segment of last July’s Economic and\r\nSocial Council session. Once again, that segment\r\nprovided appropriate guidance on a number of\r\nimportant issues: the protection of civilians in complex\r\nemergencies; sexual abuse and exploitation in\r\nhumanitarian crises; the role of affected countries and\r\ncommunities in facing emergencies; the role of military\r\nassets in the provision of humanitarian assistance; the\r\ntransition from relief to development; and the\r\nrespective roles of States, United Nations agencies and\r\ndonors in providing a coordinated and effective\r\nresponse. The European Union looks forward to further\r\ndeveloping humanitarian policies and guidelines on\r\nthose issues in the wider context of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe European Union provides about half of all\r\nglobal humanitarian assistance. In 2002 alone,\r\nEuropean Union member States collectively\r\ncontributed more than 2 billion euros, while the\r\nEuropean Commission, through its humanitarian office,\r\nallocated more than 537 million euros to projects in\r\nmore than 60 countries. Although humanitarian\r\nassistance has more than doubled in recent years,\r\nhowever, the growing number of crises that the\r\ninternational community has to face puts enormous\r\npressure on donors. Iraq, the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, Liberia, Southern Africa, Haiti and Sri\r\nLanka are just some examples of high-profile\r\nemergencies. The humanitarian community has been\r\nrequired to ensure maximum coordination and\r\ncoherence of all available instruments. Maximizing the\r\nuse of limited resources and ensuring their equitable\r\nallocation based on need are the main challenges that\r\nwe currently face.\r\nThe debate recently launched on “good\r\ndonorship” and the harmonization of procedures may\r\ncontribute significantly to meeting those challenges.\r\nThe European Union is willing to go into greater depth\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nin this debate, together with other donors and partners,\r\nso as to improve the effectiveness and coordination of\r\nhumanitarian assistance. We expect the United Nations,\r\nparticularly the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA), to play a major role in\r\nthat process.\r\nThe European Union furthermore believes that\r\nthe issue of the transition from relief to development\r\nshould be considered in an integrated manner involving\r\nboth humanitarian and development actors. We also\r\naddressed that matter earlier this morning.\r\nAdvocacy is another important area that requires\r\nthe Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs to take a leadership role. In so-called forgotten\r\nemergencies, in particular, there is a clear need for a\r\ncoherent advocacy and public information strategy. In\r\nthat respect I fully support the comments made by\r\nAmbassador Bennouna earlier.\r\nA more specific advocacy role is also needed in\r\nrelation to the most vulnerable groups, particularly\r\nwomen and children, internally displaced persons and\r\ncivilians in armed conflict. Such a role will require\r\nmore effective coordination among OCHA, the\r\nSecurity Council, the Department for Peacekeeping\r\nOperations and the various agencies, funds and\r\nprogrammes operating in the field.\r\nIn that context, the European Union commends\r\nthe indispensable advocacy role played by civil society.\r\nThe role of non-governmental organizations has been\r\ninstrumental in bringing about a more forceful response\r\nfrom the United Nations to humanitarian crises in many\r\nparts of the world, especially Africa. Their role in\r\nproviding humanitarian assistance is also extremely\r\nimportant. The European Union will continue to\r\nsupport the activities of non-governmental\r\norganizations, as well as of the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross, and the strengthening of\r\nthe partnership and coordination between the United\r\nNations and civil society in the humanitarian field.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate the European\r\nUnion’s full support for the work of the United Nations\r\nin the humanitarian area and its readiness to engage\r\nwith all stakeholders in finding ways and means to\r\nimprove the effectiveness, coordination, coherence and\r\nconsistency of our humanitarian response. We very\r\nmuch rely on the leading role of OCHA in this respect,\r\nand I wish the new Emergency Relief Coordinator,\r\nUnder-Secretary-General Jan Egeland, every success in\r\nhis new and challenging position.\r\nMr. Løvald (Norway): In late June, Annalena\r\nTonelli received a 2003 Nansen Refugee Award in\r\nrecognition of decades of quiet devotion and\r\nselflessness in helping the poorest of the poor in\r\nremote and difficult places in Somalia. She touched the\r\nlives of thousands of people. Yet two weeks ago, she\r\nwas brutally murdered outside her hospital in Borama.\r\nWith the 19 August massacre at the United Nations\r\nheadquarters in Baghdad — which caused the tragic\r\ndeaths of Sergio Vieira de Mello and 21 other\r\nhumanitarians — still fresh in our minds, the safety of\r\nhumanitarian workers has been moved to the top of the\r\ninternational agenda. The disturbing trend of blatant\r\ndisrespect for humanitarian workers that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral pointed out in his report to the Economic and\r\nSocial Council this summer — a trend that has been\r\nfurther documented in two reports to the General\r\nAssembly at this session — has been exacerbated by\r\nthe unprecedented magnitude and anti-United Nations\r\nhostility of the Baghdad massacre.\r\nThe deliberate targeting of United Nations and\r\nhumanitarian personnel for violent action is alarming,\r\nand calls for a concerted effort to reverse a trend which\r\nruns counter to the most basic tenets of international\r\nhumanitarian law. Efforts must be intensified at all\r\nlevels, from normative work and practical security\r\nmeasures to punitive action against the perpetrators and\r\nthe restoration of general respect for the inviolability of\r\nthe humanitarian space.\r\nIt is, for instance, time to put renewed energy into\r\nstrengthening the Convention on the Safety of United\r\nNations and Associated Personnel. The reinforcement\r\nof the United Nations security management system and\r\nthe Inter-Agency Security Management Network, and\r\nits increasing cooperation with non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs), must continue.\r\nStronger action must be taken by all States to\r\nensure that any threat or act of violence committed\r\nagainst humanitarian personnel on their territory is\r\ninvestigated fully and the perpetrators brought to\r\njustice. A climate of impunity is, quite simply,\r\nunacceptable.\r\nIt has been said that the best protection for\r\nhumanitarian workers is local understanding and\r\nbacking. Something has clearly gone wrong when\r\nUnited Nations and humanitarian personnel are viewed\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nas representing an enemy that may be attacked\r\nanywhere as part of a global or ideological struggle.\r\nHumanitarian efforts are becoming viewed as part of\r\nother agendas. This raises fundamental questions for\r\nthe United Nations and the humanitarian community,\r\nsuch as how to avoid being identified with political\r\nmilitary actions that are being resisted. When are they\r\nto retreat before extremist groups and say no to helping\r\npeople in need because of unreasonable risks to their\r\nown staff, when locally recruited humanitarian\r\npersonnel, in fact, account for the majority of\r\ncasualties? Thus the international community, in\r\nworking through national counterparts and structures,\r\nmakes them, in reality, substitute soft targets.\r\nStates, and perhaps donor States in particular,\r\ncannot ignore those difficult questions, but they call for\r\na revival, rather than a revision, of the humanitarian\r\nprinciples of humanity, independence, neutrality and\r\nimpartiality. We need to hold the banner of\r\nhumanitarianism high, to quote the new Emergency\r\nRelief Coordinator.\r\nHumanitarianism is a universal value and a noble\r\ncommitment that must have an independent space in\r\ninternational relations. It embodies compassion for\r\nfellow human beings in need and, as such, deserves to\r\nbe respected and protected. Humanitarian workers are\r\nflag-bearers against hunger, thirst, illness, deprivation,\r\nabuse, neglect, exploitation and despair. They carry\r\nwith them food, water, medicines, shelter, care,\r\nempathy and hope. Their mission of saving lives,\r\nalleviating suffering and maintaining and restoring\r\nhuman dignity is as imperative as ever.\r\nWhile the safety of humanitarian staff and their\r\nunimpeded access to vulnerable populations are\r\noperational prerequisites, we must also continue our\r\nlongstanding and tedious work to improve the\r\ninstruments or tools that they have at their disposal to\r\nmeet the enormous need for their services.\r\nOver the past few years, a great deal of progress\r\nhas been made in enhancing the coordination of\r\nhumanitarian assistance. The consolidated appeals\r\nprocess is well established as a coordination tool.\r\nNevertheless, there is still room for improvement in\r\nterms of greater and more systematic integration of a\r\ngender perspective and an increased emphasis on\r\nincluding an HIV/AIDS component in all relevant\r\nprogramming areas.\r\nAs we know, consolidated appeals process\r\nadvocacy and especially its fundraising function\r\ncontinue to pose a major challenge. Overall, the\r\nvolume of humanitarian assistance is still too small\r\ncompared to the need for it, and its distribution is far\r\nfrom equitable. Some high-profile priority cases\r\nreceive the bulk of the assistance, while some\r\nemergencies seem to be more or less forgotten.\r\nNorway is encouraged by the Emergency Relief\r\nCoordinator’s resolution to give priority to those\r\nforgotten emergencies and to the pressing need for a\r\ndurable solution to them. But significant increases in\r\nthe total level of assistance will be required for that\r\npurpose.\r\nThe consolidated appeals process is about team-\r\nbuilding and teamwork within the United Nations\r\nfamily and between the United Nations and recipient\r\nStates. It is also increasingly about reaching out to\r\ninclude other humanitarian actors in order to forge a\r\nstronger common humanitarian agenda. This\r\ncollaborative approach has some way to go before it\r\ncan be described as successful in the field. If it is\r\nsuccessful, it may well have a decisive impact on\r\nefforts to protect and assist, particularly as concerns\r\ninternally displaced persons, ensuring them a more\r\npredictable response from the United Nations system.\r\nTeamwork and team-building are also very\r\nimportant when it comes to bridging the relief-to-\r\ndevelopment gap. It is very encouraging to observe\r\nhow the “4-R” concept of the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR) — repatriation, reintegration, rehabilitation\r\nand reconstruction — has become accepted\r\nterminology in the development community.\r\nRecent studies — and they are numerous in the\r\nfield of humanitarian assistance — have drawn our\r\nattention to the fact that much can be done to enhance\r\nthe efficiency of humanitarian assistance through better\r\ncoordination, not just among implementing partners,\r\nbut also among donors.\r\nThe Stockholm Conference on Good\r\nHumanitarian Donorship, held last June, adopted\r\nprinciples and created a plan of action in order to\r\nreverse today’s reality, in which the totality of donors’\r\nefforts is less than the sum of the individual parts. An\r\nambitious implementation effort has been started under\r\nCanada’s leadership, and we look forward to\r\nparticipating in the pilot project envisaged for Burundi\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nin 2004 and for the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nin 2005.\r\nWhether we are dealing with good donorship,\r\ncoordination of humanitarian assistance or the safety of\r\nhumanitarian workers, we must never lose sight of the\r\nfact that the impact of our action or inaction is very\r\nreal for those of our fellow human beings who need our\r\nhelp.\r\nAnnalena Tonelli attributed her motivation to\r\n“my invincible trust in humanity, my unshakeable\r\nhope that men and women of goodwill from all\r\ncorners of the world would decide to fight for\r\nthose who were not given the opportunity to live\r\na life worthy of being called a life”.\r\nThat should be the essence of our humanitarian\r\nmission.\r\nMr. Atta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Egypt would\r\nlike to reaffirm the importance of the General\r\nAssembly’s assuming a leading role in following up\r\nand evaluating humanitarian assistance activities.\r\nEgypt calls on the United Nations, its organs and its\r\nspecialized agencies to help those States that need to\r\nbuild their national institutional capacities. The United\r\nNations must also focus on achieving the necessary\r\ncoordination among all humanitarian assistance\r\nentities — be they United Nations bodies or other\r\nrelevant organizations — working in the field, in order\r\nto meet the challenges posed by natural disasters and\r\nthe consequences of war through the implementation of\r\nan integrated approach to deal with natural disasters at\r\nall stages, from early warning to relief to\r\nreconstruction and development.\r\nEgypt calls on those States that are financially\r\nable to do so, and on the international financial\r\ninstitutions, to increase their contributions in order to\r\nfund humanitarian relief and assistance activities, in\r\nfulfilment of the principles of international solidarity\r\nand interdependence, and with the letter and spirit of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nEgypt once again calls upon the international\r\ncommunity to intervene with urgency to deal with the\r\nhumanitarian disaster faced by the Palestinian people\r\nand with their subjection to practices that have led to\r\nunprecedented suffering in the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritory.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work\r\nof the Organization (A/58/1) makes clear reference to\r\nthe closures and curfews imposed by the Israeli\r\noccupation forces, which has led to the economic\r\nparalysis that has left more than 1 million in poverty.\r\nThe report also refers to the military operations that\r\nhave left approximately 10,000 Palestinians homeless.\r\nEgypt fully appreciates the positive role played\r\nby the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for\r\nPalestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which\r\nhas provided assistance to more than 4 million\r\nrefugees. We would like to thank all organizations and\r\nagencies providing humanitarian relief and assistance\r\nto the Palestinian people. We call upon donor countries\r\nto increase their support for those efforts by providing\r\nthe necessary financing and assistance in order to fill\r\nthe gap in UNRWA’s budget, meet the humanitarian\r\nneeds of the Palestinian people and take a very firm\r\nstance against all actions impeding the delivery of\r\nassistance to those in need.\r\nMy delegation calls upon the Secretariat to\r\ninclude in the report of the Secretary-General to be\r\nsubmitted next year to the General Assembly and to\r\nthe Economic and Social Council an analytical\r\npresentation of the efforts of the United Nations with\r\nrespect to the humanitarian situation in the occupied\r\nterritories because of the difficulties faced in providing\r\nthat international humanitarian assistance and to\r\nsuggest solutions to those difficulties so that the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council can take\r\nappropriate measures.\r\nEgypt calls upon the Office for the Coordination\r\nof Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to coordinate and\r\ncooperate with UNRWA in order to follow up on the\r\nhumanitarian situation of the Palestinians under Israeli\r\noccupation, including the situation of the refugees,\r\nbecause they are an integral segment of those civilians\r\nwho need humanitarian help.\r\nEgypt believes that it is a timely priority that the\r\nUnited Nations assume an active role in expanding and\r\nensuring the protection of humanitarian relief workers,\r\nand we underscore the importance of not limiting that\r\nprotection to legal aspects alone. The United Nations\r\nshould focus on the need for the political resolve of all\r\nStates, whether or not they are a party to an agreement\r\nto host such operations. I would mention here the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General, which shows that most\r\nof the victims were Palestinian UNRWA workers. That\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nfact compels us to give sufficient importance to\r\nextending protection to those relief operations that are\r\nmore exposed to dangers than other operations and to\r\nrelief workers whose security and safety are threatened.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China): The Chinese\r\ndelegation wishes to thank the Secretariat for the series\r\nof reports of the Secretary-General on this item. My\r\ndelegation supports the statement made by Morocco,\r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and is ready to\r\ntake an active and constructive part in the discussion of\r\nthis item and in the consultations for drafting\r\nresolutions.\r\nThe Chinese delegation would like to take this\r\nopportunity to welcome Mr. Jan Egeland, the newly\r\nappointed Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian\r\nAffairs. We also wish to express our appreciation and\r\nadmiration to his predecessor, Mr. Kenzo Oshima and\r\nthe Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs (OCHA), under his leadership, for a job well\r\ndone in coordinating United Nations humanitarian\r\nassistance activities.\r\nThe Chinese delegation agrees with the general\r\nreview and analysis made by the Secretary-General in\r\nhis report (A/58/344) on the overall humanitarian\r\nsituation in 2002-2003. During the past year, the world\r\nhas witnessed frequent outbreaks of natural disasters\r\nand armed conflicts, as well as the growing threat of\r\nthe spread of HIV/AIDS and the aggravation of the\r\nproblem of refugees and internally displaced persons.\r\nAs a consequence, humanitarian assistance is facing\r\nmore serious challenges than ever before.\r\nIn order to better respond to and overcome these\r\nchallenges, it is necessary to reiterate once again the\r\nguidelines established by resolution 46/182 on the\r\nstrengthening of the coordination of emergency\r\nhumanitarian assistance. The United Nations and the\r\ninternational community should consistently follow\r\nthose guidelines in providing humanitarian assistance\r\nto the affected countries. Humanity, neutrality and\r\nimpartiality should be maintained, as should full\r\nrespect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and\r\nnational unity of recipient countries. Humanitarian\r\nassistance activities should be carried out with the\r\nconsent of, and at the request of, affected countries,\r\nwithout any conditionality.\r\nThe Chinese delegation believes that adequate\r\nfunding is a necessary condition and a basic\r\nrequirement for the success of any humanitarian\r\nassistance endeavour and for a smooth transition from\r\nrelief to development. As a tool of coordination,\r\nstrategic planning and advocacy, the Consolidated\r\nAppeals Process has consistently played a significant\r\nrole in humanitarian assistance funding. However, over\r\nrecent years, the proportion of funds made available\r\nthrough this channel has been steadily declining. This\r\nsituation has drawn close attention from all sides. We\r\nare seriously concerned and hope that efforts in this\r\nfield will be further enhanced. We repeat our appeal to\r\nthose countries that are in a position to do so to\r\nactively mobilize resources for humanitarian\r\nassistance.\r\nThe issue of the safety and security of\r\nhumanitarian personnel and the protection of United\r\nNations personnel has attracted increasing attention. As\r\nthe Secretary-General indicates in his report, United\r\nNations personnel continue to face major threats to\r\ntheir safety and security in all regions of operation;\r\nphysical violence directed against them is the most\r\ndangerous of all. Two months ago, an explosion at the\r\nUnited Nations office in Iraq took the lives of more\r\nthan 20 United Nations personnel on duty, including\r\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special Representative of\r\nthe Secretary-General for Iraq and former Under-\r\nSecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs. Here, we\r\nwould like once again to express our deep condolences.\r\nChina is also a country prone to natural disasters.\r\nThis year, it has suffered a succession of floods and\r\nearthquakes which have taken a heavy economic toll.\r\nNevertheless, the Chinese Government, within its\r\ncapacity, has continued to give through bilateral\r\nchannels all forms of assistance to other developing\r\ncountries. It has also stepped up its emergency\r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief assistance efforts. This\r\nyear, our country has provided food assistance to\r\naffected countries in Africa and emergency\r\nhumanitarian supplies to refugees, as well as to\r\nearthquake- and flood-affected areas in Africa and\r\nAsia. The Chinese Government expresses its support\r\nfor the relevant report and recommendations on\r\nproviding special economic assistance to individual\r\ncountries under this item. Let me conclude by\r\nexpressing thanks to OCHA for its concern and\r\nassistance to China in our fight against the earthquakes\r\nand floods this year.\r\nMr. Staehelin (Switzerland) (spoke in French):\r\nThe Secretary-General’s reports describe, in a concise\r\nand structured manner, the complex reality faced in the\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\ndeployment of international humanitarian aid. Events\r\nthat have taken place since the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil’s recent substantive session have made evident\r\nhow numerous and significant are the obstacles faced\r\nby international humanitarian assistance.\r\nWe have not forgotten the unspeakable acts\r\nperpetrated against the United Nations offices and\r\npersonnel in Baghdad last August 19, not to mention\r\nthe deliberate attacks that have cost the lives of\r\ndelegates of the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross (ICRC) in Iraq and in Afghanistan and of\r\nnational Red Cross and Red Crescent societies staff\r\nelsewhere in the world. We also know that employees\r\nof humanitarian non-governmental organizations also\r\nfall victim to abduction or assassination, and that these\r\norganizations must deal with all kinds of pressure.\r\nAll these acts are unacceptable, and the\r\nperpetrators must be punished without delay, in\r\naccordance with national legislation and international\r\nobligations, such as those laid out in the provisions of\r\nthe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,\r\nan instrument that went into effect over 15 months ago.\r\nSwitzerland attaches utmost priority to preserving\r\nspace for humanitarian assistance in all circumstances\r\nand without exception. Respect for international\r\nhumanitarian law by all parties to a conflict, be they\r\nStates or armed groups, is pivotal to the preservation of\r\nthis space. As a State party to, and a depositary of, the\r\nGeneva Conventions, Switzerland invites all States that\r\nhave not yet done so to ratify these Conventions’\r\nAdditional Protocols.\r\nWe must furthermore firmly reiterate the need to\r\nguarantee unimpeded access by humanitarian personnel\r\nto those in distress. In this regard, the neutrality,\r\nimpartiality and independence of humanitarian action\r\nmust be completely respected. When we say\r\n“independence”, we mean the autonomy of\r\nhumanitarian objectives in relation to political,\r\neconomic or military objectives or any other objective\r\none might have in areas where humanitarian action\r\ntakes place.\r\nWe equally feel that specific efforts must be made\r\nat all levels in order to improve the protection afforded\r\nto civilian populations, especially women and children,\r\nwho are the primary victims of current crises and\r\nconflicts. Where the prevention of human suffering\r\nfails, the humanitarian imperative to relieve it remains.\r\nStill, the commitment expected of humanitarian\r\norganizations cannot, in this sense, replace the efforts\r\nof the international community aimed at preventing the\r\nneed for, or the prolonging of, international\r\nhumanitarian aid.\r\nIn disaster or complex emergency situations, the\r\nprimary role of humanitarian organizations must also\r\nbe asserted vis-à-vis the use of military resources, as\r\nprescribed by the Oslo Guidelines adopted on the\r\nsubject in 1994 and 2003.\r\nThe coordination of international humanitarian\r\nassistance falls to the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA), newly placed under the\r\ndirection of Mr. Jan Egeland, to whom we express our\r\nsupport in the performance of his difficult and complex\r\ntasks. Over the coming months, Switzerland will\r\ncommit itself to strengthening OCHA’s role as the\r\nmainspring of international humanitarian coordination,\r\nnotably by means of a transparent dialogue between\r\ndonor countries and members of the Group of 77, be\r\nthey directly or indirectly affected by disasters, crises\r\nor conflicts.\r\nOur aim will also be to place the financing of\r\nOCHA’s activities on a more solid and foreseeable\r\nfooting, with a view to increasing the regular budgeted\r\ncontribution of the United Nations. We will also be\r\ncommitted to optimizing strategic planning and\r\ncoordination mechanisms in the field, as well as to the\r\nefficiency and effectiveness of the Inter-Agency\r\nStanding Committee. Finally, there will be a need to\r\nreview the means for financing contingency planning\r\nfor emergency situations. The importance of such\r\nplanning is crucial, whether we are dealing with natural\r\nor technological disasters, crises, or conflicts.\r\nThe neglect of human suffering by political,\r\nsecurity or economic agendas, as well as by the media,\r\nshould be our first and foremost challenge. The\r\ncredibility of the international community is at stake.\r\nOn a different note, we look forward to the\r\nrecommendations of the Executive Committee on\r\nHumanitarian Affairs and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Group on issues concerning the transition\r\nfrom relief to development. We are, indeed, convinced\r\nof the urgent need to find concrete ways and means to\r\nimprove the international response to situations of\r\ntransition, so as to avoid their turning into chronic\r\ncrises.\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nOn the subject of transition, we should like to\r\nencourage humanitarian and development organizations\r\nto intensify their cooperation so that the HIV/AIDS\r\nepidemic’s short- and long-term consequences are\r\nconsidered in their respective programmes and\r\nprojects. In a high-level meeting devoted to the subject,\r\nright here in the framework of the General Assembly\r\nlast 22 September, an intensified commitment to the\r\nfight against HIV/AIDS was made. The theme will also\r\nbe high on the agenda of the upcoming twenty-eighth\r\nInternational Conference of the Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent Movement, to be held in Geneva from 2 to 6\r\nDecember.\r\nMr. Isakov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): In his address to the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-eighth session, the President of Russia, Vladimir\r\nPutin, highlighted the moral and political importance of\r\nUnited Nations humanitarian activities for millions of\r\npeople suffering from hunger, disease, natural disasters\r\nand conflicts. It is precisely in this area where the\r\nUnited Nations has achieved real results, bringing it\r\nfurther political and moral authority. To a greater\r\nextent, this is a logical outcome of the consistent\r\nadherence by the United Nations to the fundamental\r\nprinciples of humanitarian assistance: neutrality,\r\nhumanity, impartiality and respect for sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of States. At the same time, it is the\r\noutcome of the undeniable comparative advantages of\r\nthe United Nations and its unique legitimacy, inter alia\r\nwhen coordinating multilateral action in the field.\r\nThe Russian Federation commends the work done\r\nby the United Nations system to improve the\r\ncoordination of emergency humanitarian assistance. We\r\nnote the lead role played in this process by the United\r\nNations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs (OCHA). Coordination mechanisms, in\r\nparticular the Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeals,\r\ncontinue to do effective work and are constantly\r\nimproving their work. An important job is also being\r\ndone by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\r\nmy gratitude to the former United Nations Under-\r\nSecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and\r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator, Mr. Kenzo Oshima, for\r\nthe great amount of useful work he did, and to wish his\r\nsuccessor, Mr. Jan Egeland, every success in his\r\ncrucial, difficult but extremely noble, work.\r\nIn the humanitarian area, extremely serious\r\nchallenges have emerged. The problem of forecasting\r\nand increasing preparedness for adequate response to\r\nemergency situations is becoming ever more important.\r\nIncreasingly, the United Nations is facing complex\r\nhumanitarian situations aggravated by the results of\r\nconflicts, epidemics and natural disasters. This requires\r\na comprehensive, integrated and coordinated reaction,\r\none that often goes beyond traditional short-term\r\nhumanitarian operations. It is precisely for that reason\r\nthat it is important to focus on the transition from\r\nhumanitarian assistance to reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nAn effective and smooth transition is the key to\r\nthe success of international humanitarian efforts, post-\r\nconflict peace-building and the building of a\r\nfoundation for socio-economic development. It is\r\nparticularly important that there be coordinated efforts\r\nwith the lead role played by the United Nations.\r\nClearly, the effectiveness of these efforts will depend\r\ndirectly on the amount of resources provided.\r\nWe believe, therefore, that all major participants\r\nin the reconstruction process, including United Nations\r\nprogrammes, funds and specialized agencies and the\r\nBretton Woods institutions, should have some reserve\r\ncapacity that could, if necessary, be drawn upon prior\r\nto a reaction from the donor community, which often is\r\nnot prompt enough and is sometimes inadequate. We\r\nalso believe that in post-conflict situations, particularly\r\nduring the transition to peace-building and\r\nreconstruction, there is great scope for intensifying\r\nproductive interaction between the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and the Security Council.\r\nOne serious problem still remains which is\r\nproviding for the safety and security of humanitarian\r\npersonnel. The tragic events of recent months that took\r\nplace in Iraq are another reminder of this. Among the\r\nspecific tasks to improve international humanitarian\r\ncooperation, the following can be highlighted: better\r\npreparedness and improved effectiveness of emergency\r\nplanning and management mechanisms; strengthening\r\nthe regional presence of the United Nations Office for\r\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in\r\ndisaster-prone areas; improving emergency warning\r\nnetworks in the case of major emergency situations in\r\norder to coordinate national rescue services and the use\r\nof up-to-date rescue and other specialized technologies\r\nin international rescue operations.\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nWe support the proposal of the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General contained in his report on the work\r\nof the Organization, regarding the need to improve the\r\noperational mechanisms of interaction, and to\r\nstrengthen the synergy between the national, regional\r\nand international efforts to deal with the consequences\r\nof natural disasters.\r\nRussia has increased its contribution to United\r\nNations humanitarian operations and is gradually\r\nrestoring its donor capacity. During the first six months\r\nof 2003, Russia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations\r\nprovided humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia, Eritrea,\r\nAlgeria, Ecuador and Tajikistan, as well as to Iraq,\r\ntotalling more than $3 million. This year the Russian\r\nGovernment adopted a decision to give voluntary\r\ncontributions to the World Food Programme (WFP)\r\ntotalling $11 million and $2 million to the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR). Together with this, Russia is prepared to\r\nmake available highly qualified human and\r\ntechnological potential from our Ministry, for United\r\nNations humanitarian operations involving emergency\r\nsituations. We think this solid potential will be put to\r\ngood use by the humanitarian agencies.\r\nInternational post-Chernobyl cooperation remains\r\nparticularly important. We think that the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) should\r\nremain the lead link in the infrastructure providing\r\ninternational post-Chernobyl cooperation. We welcome\r\nthe fact that United Nations Under-Secretary-General\r\nEgeland has confirmed this point. We take note of the\r\nlaunch, in June 2003, of the International Chernobyl\r\nResearch and Information Network and we commend\r\nthe creation of the Chernobyl Forum under the aegis of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\r\nPost-Chernobyl cooperation has constantly been\r\nthe focus of attention of the leaders of the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The latest\r\nCIS summit held in Yalta in September 2003 appealed\r\nto United Nations Member States to proclaim 26 April\r\nthe day of the Chernobyl disaster, an international day\r\nto commemorate the victims of radiation disasters and\r\ncatastrophes. This appeal is reflected in the draft\r\nresolution that the Russian Federation, Belarus and\r\nUkraine intend to submit at the current session of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly. We hope that all\r\ndelegations will support this noble initiative.\r\nMs. Barghouti (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\ndiscussion of the Assembly concerning agenda item\r\n40 (e): Assistance to the Palestinian people, comes at a\r\ntime when the situation in the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritories, including East Jerusalem, is seriously and\r\nunprecedentedly deteriorating, in the economic, social,\r\ncultural and environmental areas, as a result of the\r\ncontinued Israeli occupation, the intensification of the\r\noccupation’s coercive and oppressive policies,\r\nmeasures and practices against the Palestinian people,\r\nthe Palestinian National Authority and the elected\r\nleadership.\r\nIn this context, my delegation wishes to express\r\nits thanks and gratitude to the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report\r\nsubmitted under this item (A/58/88), which deals with\r\nthe difficult and deteriorating conditions in the\r\noccupied Palestinian territories, the negative impact of\r\nIsraeli policies and measures on the living conditions\r\nof the Palestinian people and the acute economic and\r\nhuman crises the Palestinian people are facing. The\r\nsummary of the report indicates that,\r\n“Tight internal and external closures, widespread\r\ncurfews, incursions and other measures taken by\r\nthe Israeli military led to a further worsening of\r\neconomic indicators and to an increase in poverty\r\nand unemployment levels among Palestinians.\r\nThe capacity of the Palestinian Authority was\r\ndiminished just as needs increased.” (A/58/88)\r\nSimilarly, the report refers to observations made by the\r\nPersonal Humanitarian Envoy of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Catherine Bertini, in August 2002, indicating\r\nthat the main causes of the humanitarian and economic\r\ncrises of the Palestinians have been,\r\n“Israel’s systematic imposition of severe\r\nrestrictions on the movement of Palestinian goods\r\nand people across borders and within the West\r\nBank and Gaza Strip. This strict closure policy\r\nhas effectively divided the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritory into approximately 50 isolated pockets.”\r\n(A/58/88, para. 6)\r\nIn this context, the World Bank submitted a report,\r\npublished in March 2003 and entitled “Two Years of\r\nIntifada, Closures and Palestinian Economic Crisis: An\r\nAssessment”, which addressed the blockade, closures\r\nand the Palestinian economic crisis after 27 months of\r\nthe intifada, to the meetings of the International\r\nMonetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank held in\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nDubai at the end of September. The World Bank\r\nwarned of the financial collapse of the Palestinian\r\nAuthority at a time when the Palestinian people are\r\nsuffering from increased poverty, destitution and\r\nunemployment. The report adds that the continued\r\nIsraeli blockade of the Palestinian territories threatens\r\nto have even more severe consequences in the light of\r\nthe state of repression that the Palestinian people are\r\nundergoing.\r\nWe are gravely concerned at the report’s statistics\r\nshowing already poor conditions for the Palestinians\r\nwith respect to employment becoming even worse.\r\nMoreover, there is a further drop-off in investment and\r\nan increased level of debt owed by the Palestinian\r\nAuthority to private companies. The report states that\r\nlosses to the Palestinian gross domestic product after\r\nthree years of the intifada amounted to $5.2 billion,\r\nthat the per capita income of Palestinians fell 46 per\r\ncent since 1999, that 60 per cent of the population\r\nfaces poverty and that more than 75 per cent of the\r\npopulation of the Gaza Strip are very poor.\r\nIt is quite clear that the worsening crisis and its\r\ncauses stem from the continued Israeli policies of\r\nblockades, checkpoints, settler colonialism, land\r\nconfiscation and the construction of the expansionist\r\nwall, which has resulted in the confiscation of\r\nthousands of dunums and the ruining of the lives of\r\ntens of thousands of Palestinian civilians. Since\r\nSeptember 2000, Israel has escalated its aggressive\r\nbloody campaign against the Palestinian people, which\r\nhas led to the death of 2,600 Palestinian martyrs and\r\nthe injury of more than 36,000 others, some of whom\r\nwere left completely disabled. Furthermore, occupation\r\nforces have bombed and destroyed several homes and\r\nprivate and public facilities, uprooted trees and\r\ndeliberately destroyed the infrastructure, including\r\nroads and water and sanitation networks. These Israeli\r\npractices against the Palestinian people are war crimes\r\nand constitute flagrant violations of the Fourth Geneva\r\nConvention.\r\nWe call on the international community to\r\nintensify pressure on Israel, the occupying Power, to\r\nimplement its commitments in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention and in\r\ncompliance with the will of the international\r\ncommunity that calls on Israel to put an end to its\r\naggression, destruction and racist settlement policy. It\r\nis important to recall the collective and individual\r\nresponsibility of the parties to the Convention to\r\nrespect and guarantee respect for the Convention’s\r\nprovisions in all cases.\r\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to express\r\nits special gratitude to our brothers in the Arab States\r\nwho received many seriously wounded Palestinians and\r\nwho provided emergency assistance and medical\r\nsupplies. Most importantly, they provided crucial\r\nassistance to maintain the functioning infrastructure of\r\nthe Palestinian Authority and of the Palestinian\r\npopulation as a whole.\r\nWe also wish to thank the other friendly States,\r\nforemost among them the European Union and Japan,\r\nthat provided humanitarian and general assistance to\r\nour people. We also thank the donor countries and the\r\nnon-governmental organizations that provided\r\nemergency humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian\r\npeople. In that respect, we must seriously counter\r\nIsraeli measures against these States and institutions,\r\nthe deliberate killing they are subjected to and the\r\ndamage that Israel inflicts on their facilities. We call on\r\nthe international community to provide protection to\r\nthose institutions, commensurate with the requirements\r\nof international humanitarian law.\r\nWe emphasize that donor countries and United\r\nNations agencies, including the United Nations Relief\r\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near\r\nEast (UNRWA), should continue to provide all kinds of\r\nsupport and assistance to the Palestinian people, who\r\nhave been blockaded by the Israeli occupation, in order\r\nto improve their living conditions, to alleviate their\r\nsuffering, to revive the peace process and to return to\r\nthe negotiating table.\r\nWe agree with the conclusions of the\r\naforementioned report of the Secretary-General that\r\nwhile international assistance might alleviate the\r\nsuffering of the Palestinian people, only a\r\ncomprehensive political settlement ending occupation\r\ncan put an end to the real humanitarian and economic\r\ncrisis faced by a growing number of people in the West\r\nBank and the Gaza Strip. The realization of a\r\ncomprehensive and just peace, as well as peace and\r\nsecurity for the countries of our region, requires not\r\nonly Israel’s total withdrawal from all occupied\r\nPalestinian territories, including East Jerusalem and the\r\noccupied Syrian Golan Heights, but also recognition of\r\nthe Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and\r\nthe establishment of a sovereign Palestinian State in\r\ntheir own territory. If those objectives are not achieved,\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nno progress can be made in the peace process and no\r\none can talk about regional development or cooperation\r\nwith Israel, the occupying Power.\r\nIn that respect, we stress the role of the United\r\nNations in achieving this just and comprehensive\r\npeace, based on the permanent responsibility of the\r\nUnited Nations towards the Palestine question. We also\r\nstress the importance of the role of the United Nations\r\nin providing assistance to the Palestinian people and of\r\nthat of the Special Coordinator for the Middle East\r\nPeace Process and Personal Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General to the Palestinian Liberation\r\nOrganization and the Palestinian Authority.\r\nMr. Rudenko (Ukraine) (spoke in Russian): I\r\nshall speak on agenda item 40 (c), concerning\r\ninternational cooperation with respect to the Chernobyl\r\ndisaster. First, I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on this agenda item, contained in\r\ndocument A/58/332. Despite the fact that 17 years have\r\npassed since the disaster, the situation in the affected\r\nterritories of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia remains\r\ncomplex. As the representative of the Ukraine\r\nparliamentary committee dealing with the task of\r\nprotecting our people from the effects of the Chernobyl\r\naccident, I would add that the situation remains\r\nextremely complicated.\r\nWith the passage of time — particularly since the\r\nclosing of the Chernobyl nuclear station and our\r\ncountry’s voluntary act for the sake of future\r\ngenerations — for the many who have no direct contact\r\nwith it, the problem of Chernobyl is gradually losing\r\nits acuteness. But for Ukraine, Chernobyl signifies the\r\nmore than 3 million people who suffered from that\r\ndisaster and its consequences, including 1.2 million\r\nchildren. Chernobyl signifies the 160,000 people from\r\n170 towns and villages who had to leave their homes\r\nand be relocated outside the areas of radioactive\r\ncontamination. Chernobyl signifies the towns, villages,\r\nforests and fields — an area of more than 4,000 square\r\nkilometres — that are dead.\r\nThree years ago, Ukraine did its duty and closed\r\nthe Chernobyl nuclear power station. We have paid an\r\nexcessively high price for that station, on three\r\noccasions. The first time was when, during the\r\nexistence of the Soviet Union, despite the will of the\r\nUkrainian people, we were forced to build the nuclear\r\npower station. We paid again in 1991, when we had to\r\ndeal alone with that tragedy that had taken the lives and\r\nhealth of people, poisoned the land and the air and\r\ncaused massive resettlement. The third time we paid\r\nwas when, despite the economic difficulties we faced\r\nand the difficult situation in the energy sector, we\r\nclosed that electric power station, which had not\r\nexhausted its capacity and for whose operational safety\r\na large amount of money had been spent. We note with\r\nregret that complying with the demands of the\r\ninternational community for the speedy closure of\r\nChernobyl actually did more harm than good to\r\nUkraine.\r\nThe measures undertaken by Ukraine to mitigate\r\nthe situation are reflected in the annex to the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General, and I will therefore not dwell on\r\nthem in detail. I would like, however, to draw attention\r\nto the fact that every year Ukraine spends 5 per cent to\r\n7 per cent of its national budget on dealing with the\r\nconsequences of the Chernobyl disaster. Between 1986\r\nto 2003 we spent more than $12 billion to that end.\r\nUkraine continues to bear — by itself — the main\r\nsocial burden of dealing with the consequences of the\r\nChernobyl disaster.\r\nWe support the appeal made at the recent session\r\nof the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of\r\nEurope calling on the United Nations, the countries of\r\nthe Group of Eight, the European Union and the\r\nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development,\r\nto grant, to Ukraine, on an emergency basis, the\r\nnecessary scientific, technical and economic assistance\r\nfor urgent action to mitigate the consequences of the\r\nChernobyl disaster. The moral aspect of this problem is\r\nof enormous importance. Like the representative of\r\nRussia, I call upon all delegations to support the\r\ninitiative of the heads of State of the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States to proclaim 26 April as a day to\r\ncommemorate the victims of the radiation catastrophes.\r\nI appeal to the General Assembly to proclaim that as an\r\ninternational day within the context of the United\r\nNations. We are duty-bound to do that in memory of\r\nthose who died, as well as for the living. I am also\r\nconfident that the General Assembly will adopt a\r\nresolution on the Chernobyl question, which will give\r\nadditional impetus to our cooperation in resolving the\r\nproblem of Chernobyl.\r\nWe are grateful to the Secretary-General for the\r\nattention that the Organization continues to give to the\r\nChernobyl item, as is borne out by today’s discussion\r\nand by the documents submitted. I would like to note in\r\nparticular the efforts made by the Office for the\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the United\r\nNations Development Programme, the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund and the United Nations Population\r\nFund.\r\nAt the same time, I would like to see real action,\r\nrather than mere drafts on paper. One body that does\r\nvery specific work on Chernobyl is the International\r\nChernobyl Centre for Nuclear Safety, Radioactive\r\nWaste and Radioecology. I would also like to take note\r\nof the three pilot projects of the Chernobyl Trust Fund,\r\nas well as the opening of the international Chernobyl\r\nResearch and Information Network (ICRIN). We hope\r\nthat the work done in ICRIN will prove to be just the\r\nstart of the real work, otherwise it will be hard to\r\nexplain to the victims the usefulness of the project.\r\nWe are deeply alarmed at the situation with\r\nregard to the Trust Fund, which, according to our\r\ninformation, in the past year was replenished only from\r\ninterest on the money in the Fund. In this connection,\r\nwe must step up our work with the donors regarding\r\nthe specific projects elaborated by the United Nations\r\nduring the recovery phase. We need to see innovation\r\nand the concretization of the proposals to mobilize\r\nresources through the organization of representative\r\ninternational donor conference.\r\nAll of the points that I have raised are in response\r\nto the question of why we need to keep the item of\r\nChernobyl on the agenda of the General Assembly and\r\ncontinue to consider the problem as a humanitarian\r\ndisaster, the consequences of which continue to have a\r\nnegative impact on the lives of people in the entire\r\nregion — the lives of present and future generations.\r\nMr. Snowdon (Australia): Tragic events over the\r\npast 12 months — disasters, conflicts and terrorist\r\nattacks — have cut short the lives of many civilians\r\nand injured many others. The resultant widespread\r\ngrief, distress and displacement have created enormous\r\nhumanitarian challenges for the United Nations and for\r\nthe international community. We should all be thankful\r\nthat there are people who, in order to meet\r\nhumanitarian needs throughout the world, work\r\nselflessly and, not infrequently, put their own safety,\r\nsecurity and well-being at risk. That risk has been\r\nunfortunately and tragically underlined in Iraq.\r\nThe Australian Government condemned in the\r\nstrongest terms the attack on the United Nations\r\nheadquarters in Baghdad. I want to pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General’s senior representative in Baghdad,\r\nSergio Vieira De Mello, and his colleagues and express\r\nour condolences, sympathy and concern at the\r\nsenseless injury and loss of life. Australia deplores\r\nattacks on humanitarian personnel wherever they occur,\r\nand we call upon all parties to ensure the safe and\r\nunhindered access of humanitarian personnel to\r\naffected civilian populations. There should be no\r\nimpunity for the perpetrators of such attacks. They\r\nmust be promptly bought to justice.\r\nStrengthened coordination of United Nations\r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief assistance will improve\r\nits impact and quality on the ground. Consequently,\r\nAustralia strongly supports the role of the Office for\r\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and\r\nits efforts to facilitate coordination of the United\r\nNations responses to natural disasters and complex\r\nemergencies.\r\nIn particular, Australia welcomes the United\r\nNations decision to establish the Joint Logistics Centre,\r\nwhich has provided important logistics support\r\nto humanitarian agencies operating in Iraq and\r\nto which Australia has provided financial support.\r\nSuch initiatives significantly improve inter-agency\r\ncoordination efforts during critical phases of\r\nhumanitarian response.\r\nHowever, there remains ample scope for United\r\nNations organizations to improve collaboration with\r\neach other and with OCHA, both at Headquarters and\r\nin the field. In this regard, we welcome further efforts\r\nby the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, the\r\ntransitional working group under Carol Bellamy and\r\nthe United Nations Development Group under Mark\r\nMalloch Brown to strengthen coordination frameworks\r\nfor humanitarian assistance and ensure effective\r\ntransition to development assistance. Australia, through\r\nparticipation in the Montreux process and the Working\r\nGroup on OCHA, will remain engaged in efforts to\r\nfurther enhance these frameworks.\r\nAustralia attaches particular importance to the\r\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict, so we were\r\npleased to support a workshop for Pacific States\r\norganized by OCHA in June. That workshop\r\nsuccessfully raised awareness of global initiatives\r\nrelating to conflict and improved understanding by\r\nthose States of their responsibilities and obligations\r\nunder international law.\r\nWe welcome the steps taken by the United\r\nNations over the past year to enhance the protection of\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nwomen and children and to prevent their sexual\r\nexploitation and abuse. Let us also recognize the\r\ncapacities of women as effective agents for preventing\r\nconflict, rather than just focus on their vulnerabilities.\r\nMore generally, we think that aid programmes are\r\nwell placed to address many of the root causes of\r\nconflict and instability and to support durable solutions\r\nfor those affected. In Australia’s case, a specific policy\r\non peace, conflict and development guides our\r\napproach and defines the aid programme’s role —\r\nwithin broader Government efforts — in preventing,\r\nmanaging and reducing conflict, building peace and\r\nassisting post-conflict recovery.\r\nAustralia endorsed the conclusions of the June\r\nmeeting in Stockholm on good humanitarian donorship,\r\nand we will seek to apply those principles and good\r\npractices within the overall policies set for our aid\r\nprogramme.\r\nOver the past 12 months Australia has responded\r\nto many calls for humanitarian assistance, not only in\r\nthe Asia-Pacific region but also beyond it. Several\r\nresponses deserve particular mention.\r\nIn Solomon Islands, Australia, working with New\r\nZealand and other Pacific Island Forum partners,\r\nintervened, at the invitation of the Government of\r\nSolomon Islands, to restore law and order. The\r\nhumanitarian dimension of the intervention is aimed at\r\nassisting people displaced through conflict, ethnic\r\ntension and the breakdown of law and order. Australia\r\nis providing an additional economic assistance package\r\nof 25 million Australian dollars for Solomon Islands.\r\nIn Timor-Leste, since 2000, Australia has\r\nprovided A$ 150 million in reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment assistance, targeting key sectors such as\r\ngovernance, water supply and sanitation, food security\r\nand income generation for rural communities, health\r\nand education. Australia is also providing A$ 1 million\r\nto the World Food Programme (WFP) appeal for\r\nemergency food aid assistance. We commend the re-\r\nestablishment of the World Food Programme in Timor-\r\nLeste as an important step in the ongoing monitoring of\r\nfood security and enhanced capacity-building for\r\nTimor-Leste. We encourage further long-term\r\ninvolvement with the broader donor community in the\r\nWFP’s endeavours.\r\nAustralia has committed more than A$ 100\r\nmillion to the humanitarian and reconstruction needs of\r\nthe Iraqi people. Australia provided prompt assistance\r\nto key international humanitarian agencies in their\r\npreparations and early support to the United Nations\r\nFlash Appeal and associated agencies, including a\r\ncommitment of A$ 6 million to the Central Emergency\r\nRevolving Fund, provision of water supply and\r\nsanitation services, disease prevention and treatment\r\nprogrammes, food distribution, provision of child\r\nprotection services, and the clearance of mines and\r\nunexploded ordnance.\r\nAlthough Australia’s aid programme is focused\r\nprimarily on our region — the Asia Pacific — we\r\nremain committed to helping to meet humanitarian\r\nneeds across the globe. As part of its global\r\ncommitment, Australia continues to support the needs\r\nof Palestinian communities affected by the ongoing\r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, providing almost A$ 3.5\r\nmillion in humanitarian assistance through United\r\nNations agencies in 2002-2003. Such assistance\r\nincludes contributions to food aid, food security and\r\npsychosocial programmes, and has been delivered\r\nprimarily through the United Nations Relief and Works\r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\r\n(UNRWA), the World Food Programme, the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization (FAO).\r\nFinally, let me record Australia’s appreciation for\r\nthe efforts of the former Under-Secretary-General for\r\nHumanitarian Affairs, Mr. Kenzo Oshima. We were\r\npleased to host Mr. Oshima in Australia last year for\r\nthe launch of the 2003 United Nations Inter-Agency\r\nConsolidated Appeals. We look forward to working\r\nwith his successor, Mr. Jan Egeland. Australia will\r\ncontinue to engage strongly with the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and\r\nother effective agencies in order to improve the impact\r\nand quality of humanitarian and disaster relief\r\nassistance.\r\nMr. Radhakrishnam (India): We thank the\r\nSecretary- General for the reports which have been\r\nprepared on “Strengthening of the coordination of\r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief assistance of the\r\nUnited Nations, including special economic\r\nassistance”. We associate ourselves with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of Morocco on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 on this agenda item.\r\nRecent events have clearly demonstrated the fact\r\nthat the United Nations cannot fulfil the role expected\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\nof it in the field of humanitarian assistance if the safety\r\nand security of its personnel is not ensured. Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello and his colleagues, who laid down\r\ntheir lives in the terrorist attacks against United\r\nNations headquarters in Baghdad on 19 August, served\r\nin the finest tradition of the international civil service\r\nas represented by the United Nations. The deliberate\r\ntargeting of United Nations personnel involved in the\r\npursuit of peace makes this incident all the more tragic.\r\nThe report before us (A/58/89) has enhanced our\r\nunderstanding of key issues which merit consideration\r\nby the General Assembly, particularly those relating to\r\nhumanitarian financing and the effectiveness of\r\nhumanitarian assistance. The report points out that\r\nthere has been a doubling of overall levels of\r\nhumanitarian aid since 1990. This is, indeed, most\r\nheartening. It is, however, a matter of concern that this\r\nincrease in humanitarian assistance has been\r\naccompanied by an overall decline in flows of official\r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nThe Secretary-General has, in another report,\r\nreferred to humanitarian assistance’s crowding out the\r\nresources required for development. The Economic and\r\nSocial Council this year reiterated that humanitarian\r\nassistance should be provided in a way that is not to the\r\ndetriment of resources made available for development\r\ncooperation. It is important to ensure this, as it is\r\ndevelopment assistance which, in the long term,\r\nreduces the need for emergency humanitarian\r\nassistance.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report draws attention to\r\nthe fact that donor decisions to allocate resources are\r\nnot driven primarily by objective needs but more by\r\ndomestic considerations, traditional patterns of\r\nexpenditure and geopolitical interests. The largest\r\nshortfalls in responses to the consolidated appeals\r\nprocess, reaching more than 70 per cent, are faced by\r\nthe countries of sub-Saharan Africa. That pattern goes\r\nagainst the basic tenets of humanitarian assistance as\r\ncontained in General Assembly resolution 46/182.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council has, in\r\nresponse to that trend, encouraged the donor\r\ncommunity to provide humanitarian assistance in\r\nproportion to needs and on the basis of need\r\nassessments, with a view to ensuring a more equitable\r\ndistribution of assistance across humanitarian\r\nemergencies, including those of a protracted nature. We\r\nhope that the Council’s call will be heeded.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General contained in\r\ndocument A/58/434, which focuses on natural\r\ndisasters, has attempted, for the first time, also to\r\nprovide information on funding trends for natural-\r\ndisaster responses. We commend the Secretariat for its\r\nefforts, even though the information provided is\r\nsomewhat sketchy. We understand that this is because\r\nof definitional problems and a lack of consistency with\r\nregard to the bases on which information is compiled.\r\nThis issue needs to be addressed, as the absence of\r\ncomprehensive and precise information affects our\r\nunderstanding of an issue to which the international\r\ncommunity attaches great importance.\r\nWe understand that the Secretariat has set up a\r\njoint working group to review a range of United\r\nNations responses in post-conflict transition situations.\r\nOur attention has been drawn to the recommendations\r\nof that group, which are contained in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the reform of the Organization. We\r\nnote that the working group attached importance to the\r\nfacilitation of links among the political, peacekeeping\r\nand operational wings of the United Nations and to\r\naddressing the variance in mandates for different\r\nUnited Nations offices at a given location.\r\nThat recommendation seems to be based on the\r\npremise that the response of the United Nations cannot\r\nbe effective if it is fragmented and that, therefore, the\r\nvarious entities dealing with human rights, security,\r\nhumanitarian assistance and development should\r\ndeliver an integrated response. The recommendations\r\nof the working group also call for strengthening the\r\nefforts of the United Nations in the areas of advocacy\r\nand negotiation.\r\nWe have always highlighted the risks associated\r\nwith such an approach. Life-saving humanitarian\r\nassistance must be provided on the basis of the\r\nprinciples of neutrality, humanity and impartiality.\r\nSuch assistance should never be used as a bargaining\r\ntool by those dealing with political issues, though the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights is\r\nundoubtedly important. However, if humanitarian\r\nworkers were to do so, they would be politicizing their\r\nactions and compromising their access to those in need.\r\nSimilarly, development assistance provided by the\r\nUnited Nations needs to respect the principles of\r\nneutrality and country-driven programming. In the\r\npost-conflict scenario, affected Governments may not\r\nbe best placed to assert their own priorities. The United\r\nNations, therefore, needs to provide assistance for\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.37\r\ncapacity-building; it should not attempt to take\r\nadvantage of the situation through bypassing the\r\nnational Government.\r\nThe mandates of peacekeeping operations also\r\nneed to be defined in a manner that does not result in\r\ntheir being seen as partial. The last regular session of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council has provided\r\nlegislative guidance in this regard through its\r\nresolution which, inter alia, affirms the leading role of\r\ncivilian organizations in implementing humanitarian\r\nassistance. It also affirms the need, in situations where\r\nmilitary capacity and assets have to be used to support\r\nthe implementation of humanitarian assistance, to\r\nensure that such use is strictly in conformity with\r\nhumanitarian principles.\r\nWe note that transition situations particularly\r\nattract the attention of both the Secretariat and the\r\ndonor countries. To be concerned about bridging the\r\ngap between relief and development and to provide\r\nemergency assistance in ways that are supportive of\r\nrecovery and long-term development is laudable. The\r\ntendency to see transition situations as opportunities to\r\nfundamentally transform social mores, recast economic\r\npriorities and influence political dynamics is, however,\r\nmost regrettable. If it collaborates with such efforts, the\r\nUnited Nations will run the risk of jeopardizing its\r\nstatus as a trusted partner of the developing countries.\r\nThe arguments which we have outlined for\r\nclearly respecting the differences in the United Nations\r\nroles in peacekeeping, the protection and promotion of\r\nhuman rights, the fostering of economic and social\r\ndevelopment and the coordination of humanitarian\r\nassistance also provide a reason for approaching with\r\ncaution and circumspection any integrated plan for the\r\nfulfilment of these objectives, for example, through a\r\nform of economic and social security council.\r\nThe General Assembly has outlined the Guiding\r\nPrinciples of humanitarian assistance in the annex of\r\nits resolution 46/182, adopted in 1991. While\r\ncoordinated and intrusive approaches may seem more\r\nattractive, the efforts of the Secretariat in the field of\r\nhumanitarian assistance will be assessed by us in terms\r\nof the benchmarks provided by this resolution.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
