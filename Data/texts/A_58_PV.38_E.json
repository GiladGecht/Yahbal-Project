I also thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his valuable and comprehensive reports on\r\nthis item, which will help towards the success of our\r\ndeliberations. We also wish to associate ourselves with\r\nthe statement made by Morocco on behalf of the Group\r\nof 77 and China.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates has been following\r\nclosely the relentless efforts of the United Nations to\r\nprovide humanitarian relief assistance to countries\r\naffected by armed conflicts and natural disasters.\r\nAccording to reports of the Secretary-General, the\r\nnumber of individuals in need of emergency and relief\r\ndevelopment assistance has increased over the past\r\nyear, due to the outbreak of wars and conflicts in\r\npreviously untroubled regions, such as in parts of\r\nAfrica and in Iraq, as well as the continued violence in\r\nthe occupied Palestinian territories and the severe\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\ndecline in economic and humanitarian conditions in\r\nmany developing countries, especially the African\r\nHorn, which has been affected by drought and the\r\nspread of HIV/AIDS. All of this requires a doubling of\r\nthe United Nations humanitarian assistance to help\r\nthose countries cope with disasters and tragic human\r\nconditions.\r\nIn this regard, we express our deep sorrow over\r\nthe deaths by terrorism and violence of United Nations\r\nemployees as they carried out their noble missions in\r\nsuch countries as Iraq and other areas affected by\r\narmed conflicts. We are also concerned about the\r\nobstacles and dangers that impede access to affected\r\nareas and people in need of help, as in the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories. In that respect, we support the\r\nmeasures taken by the United Nations to enhance\r\nawareness of the importance of safeguarding the\r\nsecurity of its employees while they do their noble\r\nhumanitarian work.\r\nWe also commend efforts by specialized agencies\r\nof the United Nations to coordinate humanitarian relief\r\noperations and stress the need to double international\r\nefforts to strengthen emergency and development\r\nassistance to developing and poor countries, which are\r\nthe most grievously affected by disasters and armed\r\nconflicts because of the vulnerability of their economic\r\nand ecological systems. We also call on the donor\r\ncountries to fulfil their commitments to helping the\r\naffected countries and to coordinate and strengthen\r\ntheir assistance in the context of a development\r\nstrategy that aims at building systems capable of\r\ncoping with natural disasters more efficiently. We also\r\nurge the international community to strengthen\r\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights\r\nconventions in order to eliminate the root causes of\r\narmed conflicts and wars, which have disastrous\r\nrepercussions and impede development.\r\nGiven its sense of responsibility for and\r\nsympathy towards the international community, the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates has always met its financial\r\nobligations to the United Nations and the peacekeeping\r\nbudget. It also donates annually to United Nations\r\nbodies and agencies involved in humanitarian and\r\ndevelopment activities. Under the leadership of Sheikh\r\nZayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, President of the country,\r\nthe Government of the United Arab Emirates attaches\r\ngreat importance to providing emergency relief and\r\nlong-term development assistance, through a number of\r\nspecialized national institutions, to developing and\r\npoor countries and those affected by natural disasters\r\nand conflict. It is estimated that the country spends 3.5\r\nper cent of its annual gross national product on foreign\r\naid, which includes emergency relief and development\r\nassistance, donations and loans to 50 countries in\r\nAfrica, Asia and Europe. Coordinated airborne relief\r\nassistance, land caravans and mobile field hospitals,\r\nsuch as those sponsored by the State and by the Red\r\nCrescent of the United Arab Emirates, have helped to\r\ndeliver timely emergency assistance to areas in\r\nconflict, such as Iraq, Palestine, Kosovo and\r\nAfghanistan, as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nTurkey, Lebanon, Sudan and Somalia.\r\nIn an initiative of the President of the State, the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates allocated $50 million to\r\ndismantle 130,000 landmines in South Lebanon in\r\n2001. As of October 2002, the unit had succeeded in\r\nremoving and defusing 17,793 landmines.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates recognizes the need of\r\naffected countries to rehabilitate and reconstruct after\r\ncontaining the consequences of disasters. Accordingly,\r\nthe United Arab Emirates has always extended soft\r\nloans and donations to developing and affected\r\ncountries to build dams, power stations, roads, ports\r\nand fully equipped residential units. It has also donated\r\n$30 million to the reconstruction of Afghanistan, in\r\naddition to in-kind assistance to support the country’s\r\neconomic and political stability. The United Arab\r\nEmirates continues to extend financial and material\r\nassistance to help the Palestinian people rebuild their\r\ncities and villages and provides them with jobs. The\r\nUnited Arab Emirates plays an essential role in the\r\nprocess of reconstructing Iraq. It is part of the core\r\ngroup of donor countries to participate in the\r\nconference of donor countries for the reconstruction of\r\nIraq, to be held on 23 and 24 of this month in Madrid.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates is deeply concerned\r\nabout the dire and deteriorating humanitarian\r\nconditions of the Palestinian people, which are caused\r\nby the Israeli policy of killing, destroying and\r\nblockading cities, and obstructing humanitarian\r\nassistance to the people in the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritories. We call on the international community to\r\ncompel Israel immediately to stop the killing and\r\naggression, to end the practice of closure and siege and\r\nto remove the separation wall, which will lead to a\r\nhumanitarian and economic disaster in the West Bank.\r\nWe also demand that Israel allow international\r\nhumanitarian organizations to deliver the needed\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nemergency assistance to the Palestinian people, in\r\naccordance with international humanitarian law,\r\nespecially the Fourth Geneva Convention. We also urge\r\nthe donor countries and the influential financial\r\ninstitutions to increase the amount and quality of\r\nhumanitarian assistance delivered to the Palestinian\r\npeople in order to save them from a tragedy deplored\r\nby the human conscience and rejected by international\r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nMr. Siv (United States): I thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his thorough and wide-ranging report on\r\nhumanitarian assistance. He has pointed to the\r\nalleviation of certain humanitarian crises this year. This\r\nincludes progress in the return home of refugees and\r\ninternally displaced persons in places such as\r\nAfghanistan, Sierra Leone and Angola. We are\r\nheartened by this. In addition, we welcome the\r\nimprovements cited by the Secretary-General in\r\nAngola and Sudan.\r\nThe people of Sudan have suffered for 25 years\r\nunder a deadly combination of drought and civil war.\r\nTwo years ago, under the leadership of President Bush,\r\nthe United States initiated a new push for peace and\r\nstability in that nation. We utilized humanitarian\r\ninroads in places such as the Nuba Mountains to help\r\nbuild a bridge to peace, contributing $163 million to\r\nhumanitarian assistance for Sudan in 2003. We worked\r\nwith the warring parties, other Member States and\r\nUnited Nations agencies. Today, this multi-pronged\r\napproach is paying off. Today, the people of Sudan can\r\nsee a glimmer of hope for their future.\r\nMore recently, the international community has\r\nused many tools to help Liberia’s people take back\r\ntheir country. These have included multilateral\r\ndiplomatic efforts, bilateral political pressure, the\r\ndeployment of peacekeepers and the delivery of\r\nhumanitarian aid throughout the process. As a result,\r\nthere have been many improvements since we met in\r\nGeneva this summer. After an initially challenging\r\nstart, the humanitarian community demonstrated just\r\nhow much it can achieve when working together. Over\r\nthe past year, the United States has provided almost\r\n$50 million in humanitarian aid to the Liberian people.\r\nAt the same time, there remain considerable challenges\r\nto the provision of humanitarian assistance and\r\nprotection to all communities affected by conflict or\r\ndisaster.\r\nThe lack of safe access to many of those\r\ncommunities around the globe continues to plague\r\nhumanitarian agencies and to cost lives, including\r\nthose of humanitarian workers. The year 2003 will be\r\nlong and sadly remembered for the unprovoked and\r\ncowardly attack in Baghdad, committed against staff\r\nmembers of the United Nations on 19 August. We have\r\nall seen the devastating consequences of this tragedy\r\nfor individual colleagues and for our community of\r\nnations. We commend United Nations agencies and\r\ntheir staff for the resilience and dedication they have\r\ndemonstrated in choosing to persevere in Iraq and in\r\nother conflict zones. This bears witness to the strength\r\nof the Organization.\r\nThe United States holds the improvement of\r\nsecurity conditions in Iraq among its highest priorities.\r\nOur commitment to the safety and security of\r\nhumanitarian workers worldwide is evidenced by\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1502 (2003). It was\r\nadopted unanimously and after much careful reflection\r\non the responsibilities that lie with each of us.\r\nThere are other challenges, including the need to\r\nimplement the United Nations code of conduct to\r\nprevent the exploitation, including sexual exploitation,\r\nand abuse of those we aim to assist; the need to uphold\r\nhumanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality and\r\nindependence while working with the many actors in\r\nhumanitarian response and recognizing their diverse\r\nroles; and the need to improve the effectiveness of\r\nhumanitarian aid. To accomplish this, we must ensure\r\nthat our aid is more timely, appropriate and\r\ncoordinated. We welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport on the agenda for further change and the\r\nopportunity to thoroughly examine the role of the\r\nResident Coordinator system in humanitarian response.\r\nWe recognize the need to adhere to policies of\r\ngood donorship and remain committed to basing our\r\nfunding on the sound assessment and prioritization of\r\nneeds on the ground. The United States continues to be\r\none of the largest donors to the multilateral system. We\r\nencourage all donors to work together in continuing to\r\nstrengthen the strategic and operational coordination\r\nrole of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs. We have valued Kenzo Oshima as a colleague\r\nand welcome Jan Egeland as the new head of that\r\nimportant Office.\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nFinally, every year there are reports indicating\r\nthat the impact of natural disasters is being heightened.\r\nEvery year there are more people living on our planet.\r\nMany of those people have no choice but to settle on\r\ndisaster-prone lands. The responsibility for us, as\r\nGovernments and as Members of the United Nations, is\r\nclear. Each country should assess its own\r\nvulnerabilities to hazards and prepare and mitigate to\r\nthe best of its ability. Where the dangers are greatest,\r\nwe need to invest in mitigation measures to lessen the\r\nimpact of natural hazards, to install early warning\r\nsystems and to insist on enforcement of appropriate\r\nbuilding codes. At the international level, we must all\r\nwork with the United Nations International Strategy for\r\nDisaster Reduction. With adequate preparation and\r\ncooperation, nations can reduce risks, thereby saving\r\nlives.\r\nThe year 2003 has seen improvements in several\r\nlong-standing humanitarian crises. Together, let us\r\nwork towards the same and more in 2004.\r\nMr. Laurin (Canada): The Government of\r\nCanada is pleased to have the opportunity to address\r\nthe General Assembly on the subject of strengthening\r\nthe coordination of the humanitarian and disaster relief\r\nassistance of the United Nations. Let me begin by\r\nexpressing Canada’s satisfaction at the appointment of\r\nthe new Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mr. Jan\r\nEgeland. Mr. Egeland’s experience has well prepared\r\nhim to lead the United Nations humanitarian system\r\nand its partners in responding to the challenges and\r\ndilemmas that are inherent in humanitarian work.\r\nEvents over the past year have demonstrated that\r\nthe need for concerted and effective humanitarian\r\naction has never been stronger. As Member States,\r\nthere is much we can do to support Mr. Egeland and the\r\ndedicated humanitarian professionals working for\r\nUnited Nations agencies, the Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent Movement and non-governmental\r\norganizations. Key issues requiring our urgent\r\ncollective attention include the safety and security of\r\nUnited Nations and associated personnel, respect for\r\ninternational humanitarian law, access to affected\r\npopulations and the protection of civilians in armed\r\nconflict.\r\nThe United Nations system has made important\r\nprogress over the past year in developing measures to\r\nimprove staff safety and security, including through\r\ntraining and the implementation of the Minimum\r\nOperating Security Standards. However, in the wake of\r\nthe senseless attack on United Nations headquarters in\r\nBaghdad on 19 August, it is clear that these efforts\r\nmust be strengthened. That attack constituted a new\r\nlow in respect for human life, for the principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and for international\r\nhumanitarian law. It demonstrated a need not only for\r\nimproved threat-assessment capacity, but also for a\r\nreview of current approaches to security management.\r\nWe encourage the Office of the United Nations\r\nSecurity Coordinator, in collaboration with United\r\nNations agencies and other partners, to develop\r\npractical approaches for consideration by Member\r\nStates. Security is an implicit cost of doing business.\r\nWe support the Secretary-General’s appeal to States to\r\ncontribute to the Trust Fund for Security of Staff\r\nMembers of the United Nations System and security\r\nline items in individual consolidated appeals. We\r\nfurther encourage States to amend their import\r\nrestrictions as required to allow United Nations\r\noperations to fully implement the Minimum Operating\r\nSecurity Standards.\r\nWhile we focus on operational requirements,\r\nStates and other actors must also act to address legal\r\ngaps. We strongly support the new momentum building\r\nbehind efforts to broaden the scope of the 1994 United\r\nNations Convention on the Safety and Security of\r\nUnited Nations and Associated Personnel. Canada also\r\nurges those States that have not yet ratified the 1994\r\nConvention and implemented it in national legislation\r\nto do so without delay. Furthermore, we call on States\r\nto ensure that the perpetrators of attacks against United\r\nNations and associated personnel are brought to justice\r\nand that they do not find safe haven in any Member\r\nState.\r\nThe dangers faced by humanitarian workers can\r\nbe seen as part of a broader trend towards lack of\r\nrespect for international humanitarian law, including\r\nhumanitarian principles of neutrality and impartiality.\r\nWhere this lack of respect stems from ignorance or\r\nmisunderstanding, humanitarian organizations have\r\noften been successful in negotiating access by\r\ncommunicating the nature of their work. More\r\ndisturbing are contexts in which armed groups are\r\nactively hostile to humanitarian action and in which\r\nforced displacement, manipulation of food aid and\r\nattacks on civilians are deliberately pursued. It is clear\r\nthat the international community must continue to\r\nstruggle to meet such challenges.\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nWe are not without means. Research, advocacy\r\nand experience have provided the international\r\ncommunity with an impressive range of tools to\r\nenhance the protection of civilians. Our most effective\r\nresponse in most circumstances remains promotion and\r\nimplementation of human rights, international\r\nhumanitarian law and refugee law. These efforts should\r\nbe undertaken in tandem with support to the practical\r\nsteps humanitarian agencies can take to enhance\r\nprotection at the field level. Where these agencies\r\nprove unable to overcome determined opposition, we\r\nhave recourse to traditional conflict-resolution\r\nmechanisms, including good offices, capacity-building,\r\npreventive military deployments and peacekeeping or\r\npeace enforcement missions.\r\nCanada is pleased that the Security Council\r\ncontinues to promote the protection of civilians in\r\narmed conflict agenda, as was seen in the robust\r\nmandates conferred on the peace support missions sent\r\nto Liberia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nRegional organizations have considerable potential to\r\nfurther that agenda, as shown by the emphasis on\r\nprotection of civilians in the mandate conferred upon\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States by\r\nthe Security Council in Côte d’Ivoire. On a similar\r\nnote, we should not ignore the capacity of individual\r\nStates to influence other States or armed groups to\r\nmodify their behaviour.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nDespite setbacks, coordination of humanitarian\r\naction continues to improve both at headquarters and in\r\nthe field. Canada is pleased by the efforts of the Office\r\nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA),\r\nin collaboration with its partners, in particular the work\r\nto further improve the Consolidated Appeals Process.\r\nWe applaud the contingency planning for Iraq. We\r\nwelcome the work of the OCHA Internal Displacement\r\nUnit and the collaborative approach it has promoted to\r\nmeeting the protection and assistance needs of\r\ninternally displaced persons. Canada remains\r\nconvinced that this approach represents the most\r\neffective strategy and urges all agencies to support its\r\nwork in this regard.\r\nWe believe that OCHA’s collaboration with the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme and the\r\nInternational Strategy for Disaster Reduction, in\r\npartnership with the International Federation of Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies, has led to more\r\neffective strategies for disaster preparedness,\r\nmitigation and response. Likewise, OCHA’s advice on\r\ncivilian-military issues this past year has benefited both\r\nhumanitarian organizations and States. Canada\r\nwelcomes the development of the Guidelines on the\r\nUse of Military and Civil Defence Assets to Support\r\nUnited Nations Humanitarian Activities in Complex\r\nEmergencies. The Guidelines provide a useful\r\nframework by clarifying ways in which military forces\r\ncan be directed in support of humanitarian activities\r\nwithout undermining respect for humanitarian\r\nprinciples. Canada commends OCHA and the Inter-\r\nAgency Standing Committee (IASC) for their work on\r\nthese Guidelines and encourages them to continue to\r\npromote their use.\r\nWith respect to the IASC, we believe that its\r\nwork continues to demonstrate its value as a forum for\r\nhumanitarian agencies to develop responses to global\r\nchallenges. Canada welcomes the work of the IASC in\r\nimproving coordinated and effective responses to\r\nHIV/AIDS. On the issue of sexual and gender-based\r\nviolence, the IASC has shown commendable\r\nleadership. The 2002 Plan of Action outlining\r\nminimum standards of behaviour, now complemented\r\nby the bulletin of the Secretary-General, should serve\r\nas a guide for all United Nations agencies and States in\r\nthe prevention and response to sexual and gender-based\r\nviolence. Action must be devoted to follow-up on this\r\nwork, including by ensuring the six core principles are\r\nintegrated into programme design, execution,\r\nmonitoring and evaluation.\r\nOther noteworthy inter-agency work is being\r\nundertaken by the joint Executive Committee on\r\nHumanitarian Affairs/United Nations Development\r\nGroup Working Group on Transition Issues. Canada\r\nhopes that the Working Group’s recommendations will\r\nlead to improvements in how the United Nations\r\nsystem responds to countries emerging from conflict.\r\nWhile considerable progress is being made, inter-\r\nagency rivalry and competition for finite resources\r\npersist. Further efforts are required to enhance\r\ncoordination and coherence among humanitarian\r\nactors. In addition to supporting the work of OCHA\r\nand the IASC, there are many ways in which States can\r\nassist these efforts. This past year has seen\r\nconsiderable attention devoted to means by which\r\nneeds-based approaches to humanitarian action can be\r\nimproved, including through the Consolidated Appeals\r\nProcess. Both the Humanitarian Financing Work\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nProgramme and the International Meeting on Good\r\nHumanitarian Donorship have helped identify ways to\r\naddress weaknesses of the current humanitarian\r\nsystem. These include capacity-building of affected\r\nStates, broader beneficiary participation, greater\r\naccountability of donors and affected States and\r\nharmonization of reporting requirements. We will work\r\nwithin our own bureaucracy, and collectively with\r\nother donor Governments, towards the implementation\r\nof the principles and good practices that were agreed at\r\nStockholm.\r\nIn conclusion, despite the considerable challenges\r\nwhich continue to confront us, we are moving in the\r\nright direction. Roles and responsibilities of affected\r\nStates, donors, the different parts of the United Nations\r\nsystem and partners in humanitarian action are\r\nbecoming clearer. This clarity lends itself not only to\r\nmutual accountability, but also and above all to\r\naccountability to those we are trying to assist. They are\r\ncounting on our commitment. It is incumbent upon us\r\nto respond.\r\nMr. Aguilar Zinser (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nstrengthening of the coordination of emergency\r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations cautions\r\nthat, over the past 30 years, the natural disasters that\r\nafflict the world have tripled in frequency and that\r\nthere has also been an increase in the number of people\r\naffected by them. It also notes, however, that the\r\nnumber of deaths from natural disasters has declined as\r\na result of actions to prevent potential catastrophes and\r\nof investments made in preventive mechanisms.\r\nThese are important figures. They show that work\r\nundertaken at the national and international levels to\r\nprevent natural disasters can indeed contribute to\r\nreducing the negative impact of such disasters. That is\r\nwhy Mexico believes it essential that we continue to\r\nstrengthen the international community’s mechanisms\r\nof cooperation in order to prevent and cope with\r\nnatural disasters. It is necessary to enhance national,\r\nregional and United Nations system capacities and to\r\nstrengthen the role of our Organization as the\r\ncoordinator of the international community’s efforts on\r\nbehalf of the countries affected, in accordance with the\r\npriorities established by the authorities of those States\r\nthemselves.\r\nIn Mexico and in Central America, cooperation\r\nhas yielded positive results in the field of prevention\r\nand in disaster relief assistance. International\r\ncooperation in disaster relief, as we see it, should be\r\nintegrated into a long-term context and a thorough\r\nconsideration of the conditions of vulnerability that, in\r\nmany instances, explain the magnitude of the damage\r\ncaused by such disasters.\r\nWe must therefore view the problem from the\r\nperspective of sustainable development, which is\r\nindeed the best defence against the ravages of nature\r\nand other disasters because it gives societies, through\r\nthe actions of their States, the tools they need to\r\nincrease their capacity to respond, to coordinate\r\nactivities and to make good use of resources, thus\r\nreducing the vulnerability of communities to disasters.\r\nIn addition to efforts to reduce the vulnerability\r\nof peoples to natural disasters, it is necessary to\r\neradicate poverty. There is a direct link between\r\nvulnerability to natural disasters and socio-economic\r\nconditions. It is a fact that poor communities usually\r\nfind themselves in situations of far greater risk and\r\nvulnerability. In his report on the International Strategy\r\nfor Disaster Reduction, the Secretary-General indicates\r\nthat many countries are rapidly accumulating latent\r\nrisks arising out of growing population densities in\r\ndangerous areas, the elimination of environmental\r\nprotection capacities that contribute to mitigating\r\ndangers, and the emergence of new social and\r\neconomic vulnerabilities due to immigration, urban\r\ndevelopment and unequal economic growth.\r\nIn this regard, it is also important to stress the\r\ndirect causal relationship between the vulnerability of\r\ncommunities to natural disasters and the destruction of\r\nthe environment that occurs around such communities.\r\nDeforestation is among the most serious causes of\r\nvulnerability to natural disasters in our countries.\r\nHence the importance of integrating international\r\ncooperation in disaster and vulnerability reduction into\r\nan comprehensive approach to reducing poverty and to\r\nprotecting and preserving the environment.\r\nWith respect to man-made disasters, it is\r\nimportant to emphasize that various United Nations\r\nbodies — in particular the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council — are considering the\r\nquestion of the protection of civilians in armed conflict\r\nand of humanitarian personnel. The Security Council,\r\nhowever, has a special responsibility in this regard. As\r\nhas been pointed out here, it has become increasingly\r\nclear and explicit that the Security Council is interested\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nin including in its mandates mechanisms for the\r\nprotection of civilians in conflict situations. We have\r\nseen this in the Council’s actions on the principal\r\nconflicts now on its agenda.\r\nNevertheless, in connection with the protection of\r\nhumanitarian personnel of the United Nations and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, the Security Council has\r\nbeen slow to act. It was not until the recent adoption of\r\nresolution 1502 (2003), which was promoted by\r\nMexico, that the Council specifically addressed the\r\nsafety and protection of humanitarian personnel in\r\nsituations of armed conflicts. The terrible events of 19\r\nAugust in Baghdad highlighted the urgent need for the\r\nCouncil to be endowed with appropriate instruments to\r\nensure the security and protection of personnel doing\r\nhumanitarian work. Such instruments could be made\r\navailable both to the relevant humanitarian\r\norganizations and to the United Nations so that\r\ncountries and parties to a conflict might understand\r\ntheir responsibilities with regard to the protection of\r\nhumanitarian personnel.\r\nResolution 1502 (2003) condemns all acts of\r\nviolence committed against humanitarian personnel,\r\nand deliberate attacks in particular. It reaffirms the\r\nobligation of all parties involved in an armed conflict\r\nto comply fully with the rules and principles of\r\ninternational law related to the protection of such\r\npersonnel. It recalls the need for States to end impunity\r\nfor those who perpetrate such acts. As a result of the\r\nadoption of the resolution, the Secretary-General must\r\nnow  address, in all his country-specific situation\r\nreports, the issue of the safety and security of\r\nhumanitarian personnel and United Nations and its\r\nassociated personnel, including specific acts of\r\nviolence against such personnel, remedial actions taken\r\nto prevent similar incidents and actions taken to\r\nidentify and hold accountable those who commit such\r\nacts. Moreover, he is requested to explore and propose\r\nadditional ways and means to enhance the safety and\r\nsecurity of personnel of the United Nations and\r\nhumanitarian organizations, who provide vital\r\nassistance in conflict situations.\r\nThe situation of personnel providing such\r\nassistance has deteriorated in recent years. A source of\r\nparticular concern is the increase in deliberate attacks\r\nand the fact that they impact directly on the neutrality\r\nand impartiality inherent in humanitarian work.\r\nDeliberate attacks on humanitarian personnel are\r\nclassified as war crimes in the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court and in resolution 1502\r\n(2003) itself. Such a definition seeks to make it\r\nextremely clear that humanitarian personnel are\r\nplaying a central role in protecting and assisting\r\ncivilian populations affected by armed conflict.\r\nThat is why ensuring the security of personnel in\r\ncharge of humanitarian assistance is an obligation of\r\nthe warring parties and should be a fundamental task of\r\nStates, the United Nations and humanitarian\r\norganizations. The United Nations must continue to\r\nstrengthen its coordination with the agencies and other\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations on\r\nthe ground.\r\nMr. Oyugi (Kenya): I take this opportunity to\r\ncommend Mr. Hunte on the able manner in which he\r\ncontinues to guide our work. Let me reassure him of\r\nmy delegation’s support and cooperation.\r\nWe wish to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport, contained in document A/58/344, submitted\r\nunder the agenda item on strengthening of the\r\ncoordination of humanitarian and disaster relief\r\nassistance of the United Nations, which is the subject\r\nof our deliberations.\r\nMy delegation notes with grave concern the tragic\r\nloss of life of humanitarian staff in their service to the\r\ninternational community. It is our view that\r\nhumanitarian staff should be allowed to operate in safe\r\nand secure environments. That is one of the operational\r\nprerequisites for the successful delivery of\r\nhumanitarian assistance. In this regard, therefore, we\r\nsupport the Secretary-General’s suggestion that it is\r\ncrucial for Governments and non-State actors to\r\nprovide stronger commitments to the humanitarian\r\ncommunity to ensure that those responsible for attacks\r\non humanitarian staff are promptly brought to book.\r\nThe subject before us is a cross-cutting issue that\r\ntouches many of us in this Assembly. Looking at the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, we note that developments\r\nin the humanitarian environment during the past year\r\nhave been mixed in that some long-standing conflicts\r\nare moving towards a resolution, while, in other parts\r\nof the world, there is an unfortunate re-emergence of\r\nother conflicts. Protracted conflicts therefore continue\r\nto worsen the suffering of civilians in general and of\r\nwomen and children in particular. Furthermore, other\r\nchallenges have emerged that have aggravated human\r\nsuffering. These include the ravages of drought and\r\nfood shortages. The spread of HIV/AIDS in situations\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nof armed conflict is a development that is challenging\r\nhumanitarian aid and requires the international\r\ncommunity to rethink its approach to emergencies.\r\nThe Secretary-General requires the support of all\r\nof us in his efforts to strengthen the coordination of\r\nhumanitarian assistance. Kenya has played a leading\r\nrole in coordinating the delivery of humanitarian\r\nassistance in conflict areas in our region. We have\r\nextended assistance, notably to southern Sudan,\r\nSomalia, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, to name just a few. My delegation concurs with\r\nthe Secretary-General’s observation that\r\n“in the area of natural disasters, improvements in\r\noperational tools need to be reinforced by greater\r\ncooperation between the international community\r\nand regional and national response actors so as to\r\nensure better synergies in disaster management”.\r\n(A/58/89, para. 3)\r\nKenya supports the efforts of the United Nations\r\nto assist Member States and regional arrangements in\r\nresponding to natural disasters. Due to the many\r\ndisasters that have visited our country, mechanisms\r\nhave been put in place in order for us to be able to\r\nrespond appropriately. An example of this is the\r\nDisaster Preparedness Centre, which is part of the\r\nOffice of the President, for the purpose of facilitating\r\ncoordination. The Centre is charged, amongst other\r\nthings, with the responsibility of capacity-building, the\r\ndevelopment of early warning systems, the monitoring\r\nof natural disasters and overall natural disaster\r\npreparedness.\r\nKenya organized the first regional meeting for\r\ndisaster management in 2000. The meeting brought\r\ntogether civilian and military leaders from 11\r\ncountries. It was organized in conjunction with the\r\nGovernment of the United States and it has since\r\nbecome an annual event known as “The Golden Spear”.\r\nThis event is organized in recognition of the realization\r\nthat civilian defence assets could be effectively and\r\nquickly deployed in the event of a disaster.\r\nWe support the relevant resolutions and call on\r\nthe international community to provide assistance in\r\nresponse to the United Nations 2003 Consolidated\r\nInter-Agency Appeal for the relief and rehabilitation of\r\naffected countries. We commend the efforts made so\r\nfar by the international community to mitigate these\r\ndisasters. In Africa, these efforts have been manifested\r\nin various schemes, such as the economic assistance for\r\nthe reconstruction of Djibouti and the special\r\nassistance for the economic recovery and\r\nreconstruction of the Congo. There is also the case of\r\nthe emerging humanitarian assistance for the situation\r\nin Ethiopia and the rehabilitation of Somalia.\r\nOn the issue of gender mainstreaming, my\r\ndelegation supports the call for integrating a gender\r\nperspective into the full range of emergency\r\noperations. The effective targeting of emergency\r\nhumanitarian assistance to women and girls in refugee\r\ncamps is critical. This, in our view, should be started\r\nfrom the initial stages of a conflict and continue right\r\nthrough to the post-conflict reconstruction process.\r\nKenya notes with concern the problem of sexual\r\nexploitation and abuse arising in complex emergencies\r\nand armed conflict. We support the Plan of Action\r\nprepared by the Task Force on the Protection from\r\nSexual Exploitation and Abuse in Humanitarian Crises.\r\nIt is expected that all United Nations civilian staff\r\nmembers will subscribe to the six core principles\r\nrepresenting the minimum standards of behaviour on\r\ntheir tours of duty. At the same time, it is hoped that\r\nthe United Nations will enforce the disciplinary\r\nprocedures that are currently being formulated.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that my\r\ndelegation supports the recommendations outlined in\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General and will continue to\r\nplay its part in this regard. However, it is our ardent\r\nbelief that, if humanitarian assistance is to be of use, it\r\nhas to be timely, adequate and supported by predictable\r\nand sustainable resources. More often than not,\r\nhumanitarian assistance has been slow, inadequate and\r\nunpredictable, thus negating its effectiveness for\r\nrecipients.\r\nMr. Fuks (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): I have\r\nthe honour of addressing this General Assembly on\r\nbehalf of my Government on the occasion of our\r\nconsideration of agenda item 40. In this respect, my\r\ndelegation wishes to thank the Secretary-General for\r\nhis report in document A/58/320 on the “White\r\nHelmets” initiative, which has been so favourably\r\nreceived by this Assembly.\r\nI wish also to express my sincere recognition of\r\nthe continuous support given to the initiative by the\r\nUnited Nations Volunteers and other system agencies\r\nin the countries in which we have worked together.\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nI should also like to point out the sustained trust\r\nand support the initiative has enjoyed from the United\r\nNations Development Programme in its undertakings. I\r\ntrust that the actions carried out by the initiative will\r\ncontribute to extending the cooperation between our\r\ncountries to our peoples and our Governments. I also\r\nwish to mention the close cooperation provided by the\r\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs in New York and Geneva.\r\nAs pointed out by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport, White Helmets has proven in its activities and\r\nresults to be a valuable tool in the areas of cooperation,\r\nfinancing and mobilization of resources. I wish to\r\nexpress my gratitude for the report, which clearly\r\nshows the initiative’s good intentions and its ongoing\r\nprogress. This experience is also built on an ever-\r\nbroadening network of agreements and institutional\r\ncontacts with, among others, the World Food\r\nProgramme, the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization, the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, the Inter-American Development\r\nBank, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees, the European Parliament and the African\r\nUnion.\r\nI wish to express my gratitude for the views set\r\nforth by the Secretary-General in his report, which\r\nconfirm the conceptual validity of the previously\r\nidentified, trained and standby White Helmets\r\nvolunteers as a useful mechanism available to the\r\nUnited Nations to provide immediate support for its\r\nrelief, rehabilitation, reconstruction and development\r\nactivities. It is within that context that my Government\r\nwill introduce a draft resolution on the White Helmets\r\ninitiative for the consideration of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThis is an excellent opportunity for my\r\nGovernment to ratify its commitment to peace and the\r\nfight against hunger and extreme poverty, one of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. It is also a propitious\r\noccasion to express the conviction that the White\r\nHelmets initiative deserves to continue receiving the\r\nsustained support of the members of the international\r\ncommunity. As the Secretary-General has pointed out\r\non more than one occasion, civil society’s active\r\nparticipation in the United Nations activities is\r\nindispensable to the success of humanitarian disaster\r\nand conflict relief missions. In some circumstances,\r\nthis participation not only mitigates damages, but can\r\nhelp avoid unwanted situations.\r\nThe availability of White Helmet Volunteers is a\r\nuseful, effective and efficient mechanism for\r\nparticipating in such activity in an orderly and ever-\r\ngrowing way. It is one of many convergent lines of\r\naction carried out by different countries. In view of\r\nthis, we come once again from the South of the world\r\nto this General Assembly in the firm conviction that\r\nthe revitalization of this forum of global representation\r\nis essential to consolidating international law and\r\nhuman rights as the rational instruments with which\r\nconflicts can be solved and threats faced effectively.\r\nA few weeks ago, before this General Assembly,\r\nour country stood firmly by its commitment in the face\r\nof the greatest challenge of our time — avoiding a\r\n“widening of the gap between the rich and poor\r\n[reflecting] a grim reality of unprecedented\r\npoverty and social exclusion”. (A/58/PV.11, p. 7)\r\nThe Argentine commitment to making globalization\r\nwork towards the well-being of all was also made clear.\r\nThe White Helmets initiative is a mechanism\r\ntowards attaining that goal. It encompasses all men and\r\nwomen of goodwill in the world, every person with a\r\nsocial conscience. In stressing that\r\n“new challenges call for different and creative\r\nsolutions so as not to be left behind by changes in\r\nthe world in the technological, economical, social\r\nand undoubtedly even cultural fields”, (ibid., p. 9)\r\nthe decision to support every effort to attain those goals\r\nwas stated before every country in this universal\r\nforum. Those are the central tasks on the international\r\nagenda. We accept the challenge of finding new ideas\r\nfor a new world, combining different ideas and creating\r\nthe practical means to put them at the disposal of the\r\nnations we represent. That is our duty and our\r\nchallenge.\r\nIn that context, maintaining an international\r\ncooperation mechanism is no longer merely about\r\nrelations among countries with different development\r\nconditions. It is no longer enough merely to\r\ndemonstrate the high level of professionalism of our\r\nrapid response teams. The time has come to reaffirm\r\nour vocation for solidarity and giving. That is\r\nespecially true for those of us who have received the\r\nsupport of various actors in the midst of our recent\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\ncrises. We have the obligation and the resolve to\r\ncooperate with the rest of our fellow countries. With\r\nthe concurrence of the international community, we are\r\nwilling to make an effort in the maintenance of that\r\ntool for horizontal cooperation.\r\nAs many Latin American leaders have stated\r\nbefore this very forum, the different rules that guide\r\nworld affairs are changing and there is a sense of\r\nshared responsibility in the face of the difficult\r\nconditions most peripheral countries are experiencing.\r\nIt is important that the international community\r\ncontinue to debate the nature of its role in these\r\ncircumstances and the profile of the volunteers who\r\nparticipate in international efforts to eradicate extreme\r\npoverty and hunger and to carry out humanitarian\r\nactivities in natural or man-made emergencies.\r\nWhite Helmets seeks to make a contribution to\r\nthat exchange, to collaborate in the construction of\r\nadequate models that will help attain the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals set by the United Nations, and to\r\nsupport activities that mitigate damage caused by\r\ntragedies and disasters.\r\nWhen faced with a crisis, people generate\r\nsolidary and participative response experiences in the\r\nproductive, health and social fields. Volunteerism can\r\nintegrate the protagonists of these everyday epics so as\r\nto benefit from their experiences and develop new\r\nmodels for cooperation. This new and not yet fully\r\nexplored network must, like other initiatives,\r\nincorporate representatives who have experienced and\r\nfaced these crises, misery, poverty and natural\r\ndisasters. It includes training that will allow the\r\nformalization of responses and thus enable the\r\ntransmission of tools that have emerged from the heart\r\nof a crisis to similar populations. It seeks to build\r\nworking teams that will go to work wherever they are\r\nneeded. It also contemplates sowing the seeds of a\r\nmodel implementation and organization to be\r\nreplicated by the men and women of the country that\r\nhas made the request. I reiterate that we accept the\r\nchallenge of finding new ideas for a new world,\r\ncombining different ideas and creating the practical\r\nmeans to put them at the disposal of the nations we\r\nrepresent. That is our duty.\r\nLastly, I wish to convey once again my\r\nGovernment’s deepest thanks to Mr. Hunte for the\r\nsupport this Assembly has given the White Helmets\r\ninitiative and to all those who, in one way or another,\r\ncontribute to alleviating world hunger, an objective that\r\nbinds all men of goodwill.\r\nMr. Haraguchi (Japan): Let me first express my\r\ndeep respect for all United Nations personnel devoted\r\nto humanitarian assistance activities. They are making\r\nan admirable contribution to the effort to help people in\r\nneed, even at the risk of losing their lives. Despite their\r\nsincere efforts, however, there are often cases where\r\nhumanitarian assistance does not fully produce the\r\nexpected results due to a lack of coordination among\r\ndonors and United Nations agencies tackling the same\r\ncrisis from different angles.\r\nWe are of the view that close coordination among\r\ndonors and various humanitarian agencies and a\r\nseamless transition from humanitarian assistance to\r\nreconstruction are crucial to achieving effective and\r\nmutually reinforcing results, given the limited\r\nresources available. Japan once again calls on all\r\ndonors and humanitarian agencies to work closely\r\ntogether, with the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA) playing a central role in\r\ncoordinating them.\r\nIn this connection, the Japanese Government\r\nwelcomes the report of the Commission on Human\r\nSecurity submitted to the Secretary-General last May,\r\nwhich very ably addresses the important issue of the\r\nneed for United Nations agencies to deal with a crisis\r\nin a comprehensive and integrated manner among other\r\nsubjects. Our delegation took the liberty of sending a\r\ncopy of the report to all the missions in New York and\r\nit is our hope that the representatives here will have a\r\nchance to read it. The report says that\r\n“assistance is often compartmentalized for\r\ndifferent categories of people — refugees,\r\nreturnees, internally displaced persons,\r\ndemobilized combatants — reflecting the\r\nmandates of agencies providing assistance, not\r\noverall needs”.\r\nThe areas of assistance are also divided by the\r\nmandates of agencies into food, education, medical\r\ncare and housing, just to mention a few.\r\nIn reality, however, all forms of activity aimed at\r\nhelping people in need affect each other. In order to\r\naddress the real needs of suffering people in an\r\neffective manner, United Nations agencies need to\r\nengage in their dedicated work in a more integrated and\r\ncomprehensive manner.\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nIt is also important to ensure a seamless transition\r\nfrom humanitarian assistance to reconstruction. Madam\r\nSadako Ogata, former United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees and Co-chair of the\r\nCommission on Human Security, has challenged the\r\nnotion of “post-conflict” and urged us to rethink the\r\ncurrent working arrangements, which have been\r\nformulated in accordance with a rather artificial and\r\noften misleading demarcation between activities for\r\nconflict situations and those to be implemented in post-\r\nconflict situations.\r\nAlthough the focus of activities may shift in time,\r\nhumanitarian and development assistance needs to be\r\nimplemented throughout the spectrum of the conflict\r\nand post-conflict stages of any humanitarian crisis.\r\nWith a focus on assisting people rather than adhering to\r\ninstitutional mandates, we will be able to produce\r\nresults that address the problems people face in their\r\nentirety and in the most effective manner.\r\nBased on this idea, the Japanese Government has\r\nlaunched an innovative initiative to provide\r\ncomprehensive regional development assistance to\r\nAfghanistan, under the name the “Ogata Initiative”.\r\nThis initiative aims at arranging and implementing\r\nspecific, feasible projects emphasizing regional\r\nrecovery and community empowerment in close\r\ncooperation with agencies including the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund, and the World Food Programme,\r\nunder the ownership of the Afghan people. The\r\nprojects cover a broad range of areas such as temporary\r\nhousing and water-supply systems for the resettlement\r\nof refugees and internally displaced persons, and\r\nincome-generation and food-for-work programmes for\r\ncomprehensive regional development. Through the\r\nexperience we obtain from this initiative, I hope that\r\nwe will be able to further develop a methodology for\r\napplying the conceptual framework of human security\r\nto concrete projects on the ground that reflect\r\nrecipients’ interests.\r\nIt is also true that, no matter how efficiently the\r\nrelevant United Nations agencies coordinate among\r\nthemselves, humanitarian assistance activities cannot\r\nbe carried out fully without adequate financial\r\nresources. Here lies the reason why efforts to ensure\r\npublic understanding are important. Deeper and\r\nbroader understanding and support for humanitarian\r\nneeds among the public will make it easier for\r\ncountries to make contributions to humanitarian crises.\r\nTo this end, it is essential that United Nations agencies\r\ntake special care to inform the general public of the\r\ntangible and positive results which their activities are\r\nexpected to produce in the lives of people suffering\r\nthrough humanitarian crises.\r\nIn order to realize broader support for\r\nhumanitarian activities that reflect the diversity of the\r\ninternational community, it is also important to try to\r\nincrease the number of new donors, as well as to\r\nenhance the geographical balance with respect to\r\nhumanitarian personnel employed by United Nations\r\norganizations. At the same time, it is important not to\r\nforget the price of our failure to act on what are\r\nsometimes called “forgotten crises”. When CNN\r\nbroadcasts news about a new crisis that includes\r\nshocking footage of people in distress, it immediately\r\nattracts world attention.\r\nOn the other hand, even if a humanitarian tragedy\r\ncontinues for a long time, very few will know or be\r\nconcerned about it unless there is media coverage.\r\nJapan hopes that the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs and other agencies further\r\nimprove the way, for example, through the\r\nConsolidated Appeal Process, to address forgotten\r\ncrises more effectively. For its part, Japan continues to\r\nextend humanitarian assistance to regions less in the\r\npublic eye, such as Southern Africa, either through\r\nUnited Nations agencies or bilaterally.\r\nIn the wake of the violent attack on the United\r\nNations offices in Baghdad, the issue of the security of\r\nhumanitarian personnel has come to the forefront of\r\ninternational concern. Humanitarian personnel are\r\noften dispatched to dangerous front lines even at very\r\nearly stages of a conflict in a spirit of humanity,\r\nneutrality, and impartiality. These are the people who\r\nare most deeply committed to the noble cause of\r\nhelping others who are helpless and suffering, and no\r\nattack on these people, whatever the reason, should\r\never be tolerated. We have to bear in mind that no\r\neffective humanitarian assistance is possible without\r\ntheir presence on the ground.\r\nIt is indispensable to ensure the safety of\r\npersonnel engaging in United Nations humanitarian\r\noperations. Japan welcomes Security Council\r\nresolution 1502 (2003) as an important step towards\r\nbetter protection of humanitarian personnel. It is\r\nnecessary to conduct further discussions on this matter,\r\nincluding the question of expanding the scope of\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nprotection under the existing Convention on the Safety\r\nof United Nations and Associated Personnel.\r\nLastly, let me touch briefly upon the importance\r\nof disaster reduction. In addition to man-made conflict,\r\nnatural disasters often cause grave humanitarian crises.\r\nConsequently, a significant portion of humanitarian\r\nassistance activities have as their goal the provision of\r\nrelief to victims of natural disasters. But relief is only\r\npart of the answer. A wider range of measures is\r\nrequired to this end, including those aimed at reducing\r\nnatural disasters, namely, mitigation, prevention and\r\npreparedness.\r\nI have to stress that disaster reduction is also\r\nessential to the achievement of the overarching\r\nobjectives of sustainable development. It is highly\r\nimportant as well in terms of carrying out the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development Plan of\r\nImplementation, as well as following up the Ministerial\r\nConference of the Third World Water Forum.\r\nJapan has proposed that the General Assembly\r\nadopt a resolution enabling the United Nations to hold\r\na world conference on disaster reduction in order to\r\nconclude the review of the 1994 Yokohama Strategy,\r\nadopted at the World Conference on Natural Disaster\r\nReduction, and upgrade it to more fully reflect the\r\nguiding principles of the Plan of Implementation of the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development and to\r\nidentify specific policy measures to put the Yokohama\r\nStrategy into effect. I would like to appeal to Member\r\nStates to support this resolution. If it is accepted, Japan\r\nwould like to host the conference in Kobe, in Hyogo\r\nPrefecture, in January 2005, in close coordination and\r\ncooperation with the Inter-Agency Secretariat of the\r\nInternational Strategy for Disaster Reduction.\r\nLet me conclude my remarks by assuring you that\r\nJapan, together with other donor countries, will\r\ncontinue to be an active supporter of OCHA and other\r\nUnited Nations agencies engaged in humanitarian\r\nassistance.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I give\r\nthe floor to Mr. Vladimir Tsalka, Chairman of the\r\nCommittee on the problems of the consequences of the\r\ncatastrophe at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant at\r\nthe Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus.\r\nMr. Tsalka (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The\r\nGeneral Assembly is today considering an issue of\r\nextreme importance both for my country and for the\r\nentire international community. With the Chernobyl\r\ncatastrophe, human civilization entered a new stage of\r\ndevelopment in which technological risk, multiplied by\r\nthe human factor, is jeopardizing its very existence.\r\nAt present, we all face a number of questions.\r\nHave we managed to find an adequate response to that\r\nchallenge? What is the current situation in the most\r\naffected regions? What efforts need to be made to\r\nimprove the situation and to increase the world\r\ncommunity’s ability to cope with a possible recurrence\r\nof large-scale radiation disasters?\r\nBelarus, where nearly 2 million people still reside\r\nin contaminated areas, which make up 23 per cent of\r\nthe country’s territory, continues to undertake\r\nconsiderable efforts aimed at minimizing the\r\nconsequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe. The\r\nresources we must allocate every year to address post-\r\nChernobyl problems are comparable to our education,\r\nhealth care and defence expenditures. Since 1991 we\r\nhave spent more than $13 billion to mitigate the impact\r\nof Chernobyl. The estimated total damage amounts to\r\n$235 billion. It is obvious that those additional forced\r\nexpenditures could be otherwise allocated for the\r\npurposes of the country’s social and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThanks to consistent and efficient measures at the\r\nnational level, our country has managed to minimize\r\nthe impact of radiation. The radiological situation in\r\nBelarus is stable and is regularly monitored. However,\r\nthe Chernobyl catastrophe entails a range of complex\r\nproblems for the health sector and for the ecological\r\nmanagement and economic development of the affected\r\nregions.\r\nThere is some degree of uncertainty with regard\r\nto preserving the health of people living in\r\ncontaminated areas and the steps that should be taken\r\nin that regard. There is still no international consensus\r\nregarding the long-term impact of low-level doses of\r\nradiation on people. That cannot but be a matter of\r\nconcern.\r\nWe highly commend the informative and\r\nmobilizing role played by the United Nations in\r\ncreating momentum to overcome the aftermath of\r\nChernobyl. It is no coincidence that the first resolution\r\nof the General Assembly on this issue, resolution\r\n45/190, which established the political and institutional\r\nbasis to develop full-fledged international cooperation\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\non Chernobyl-related issues, was called a resolution of\r\nhumanism, solidarity and charity.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report (A/58/332) under\r\nconsideration comprehensively reflects the measures\r\nthat have been undertaken by the Governments of\r\naffected States in collaboration with the specialized\r\nagencies and other bodies of the United Nations\r\nsystem, as well as of the current difficulties in the\r\nprocess of implementing resolution 56/109 on the\r\nsubject of Chernobyl, which was adopted during the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe three most affected countries — Belarus, the\r\nRussian Federation and Ukraine — have initiated an\r\nadditional draft resolution on Chernobyl for adoption\r\nby the General Assembly at the fifty-eighth session.\r\nThat is a logical and consistent step towards the\r\nimplementation of the new strategy proposed in the\r\nUnited Nations report entitled “The Human\r\nConsequences of the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident: A\r\nStrategy for Recovery”, envisaging a gradual shift from\r\nthe provision of humanitarian aid to ensuring the\r\nsustainable development of the affected regions.\r\nThe implementation of that strategy is based upon\r\na comprehensive approach to addressing post-\r\nChernobyl problems that includes a variety of measures\r\nin the areas of health, social and psychological\r\nrehabilitation, environmental recovery and economic\r\ndevelopment. That approach is based on the concept of\r\nthe active involvement of the affected population in the\r\nrehabilitation process.\r\nThe Government of Belarus fully supports that\r\nstrategy and calls for enhanced international\r\ncooperation, which is a powerful instrument in\r\nalleviating the consequences of the catastrophe. I\r\nwould like to emphasize that the most important task at\r\nthe current stage is to translate theoretical\r\nrecommendations into real projects and collaborative\r\nprogrammes. Such work is already under way in\r\nBelarus.\r\nThe declaration on the principles of the\r\ninternational Cooperation for Rehabilitation\r\nprogramme was signed at Minsk on 15 October 2003.\r\nThe United Nations Development Programme, the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization, the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe, the Swiss Agency for\r\nDevelopment and Cooperation and a number of\r\nEuropean non-governmental organizations are among\r\nthe international participants in the programme. The\r\nEuropean Commission, a number of States members of\r\nthe European Union and other participants are expected\r\nto endorse the declaration in the near future. I would\r\nlike to take this opportunity to urge all concerned\r\ncountries and international organizations to take part in\r\nthe implementation of the programme, which is the\r\nfirst of a new generation of Chernobyl-related\r\ninitiatives aimed at ensuring sustainable development\r\nin the affected regions. I am confident that the United\r\nNations has the necessary knowledge, technology and\r\nresources to implement development programmes in\r\nChernobyl-affected regions.\r\nThe International Chernobyl Research and\r\nInformation Network and the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency’s Chernobyl Forum, which were\r\nestablished this year, will certainly make a valuable\r\ncontribution to the development of concrete\r\nprogrammes and projects. We expect that the outcome\r\nof their activities will help achieve a significant\r\nimprovement in the living conditions of the people\r\naffected by this most serious radiation disaster.\r\nI would also like to draw attention to the\r\ninitiative announced recently in this Hall by the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Belarus\r\n(see A/48/PV.20) to organize an international\r\nconference at Minsk in 2006 to mark the twentieth\r\nanniversary of the Chernobyl catastrophe. I am\r\nconfident that the conference will promote the further\r\nenhancement of international cooperation on\r\nChernobyl-related issues on the basis of the principles\r\nof solidarity, mutually beneficial cooperation and\r\nefficient coordination of bilateral and multilateral\r\ninitiatives. We would like to invite all those interested\r\nto take part in the preparation and work of that\r\ninternational conference.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to invite Member\r\nStates to support the draft resolution on Chernobyl. It\r\nis my hope that its noble principles will serve as a\r\nsound basis to strengthen the efforts of the\r\ninternational community to restore decent living\r\nconditions for the people affected by the Chernobyl\r\ncatastrophe.\r\nMr. Kim San-hoon (Republic of Korea): My\r\ndelegation applauds the efforts of United Nations\r\nprogrammes, funds and agencies to provide and\r\ncoordinate humanitarian assistance around the world.\r\nWe would also like to thank the Secretary-General for\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nproviding us with a comprehensive set of reports on the\r\nvarious issues involved.\r\nThe United Nations has unparalleled authority\r\nand expertise in bringing life-saving assistance to\r\npeople in vulnerable situations in the aftermath of\r\ndisaster, civil strife and conflict. The Republic of\r\nKorea actively supports and takes part in those efforts.\r\nThis year we have provided $33 million in\r\nhumanitarian assistance through the United Nations,\r\nwhich includes $13 million in assistance for Iraq. We\r\nare also doing what we can bilaterally. In particular,\r\nthis year we have provided humanitarian assistance for\r\nNorth Korea totalling around $230 million, which\r\nincludes 300,000 tons of fertilizer, 400,000 tons of rice\r\nand $50 million of aid from civic groups.\r\nMr. Bennouna (Morocco), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe Republic of Korea supports the central role\r\nplayed by the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs in the areas of humanitarian\r\nadvocacy, policy and coordination. We appreciate the\r\nconsolidated appeal process and other mechanisms\r\nestablished to strengthen international cooperation for\r\nimproved emergency preparedness and response. We\r\nhave every confidence that the new Emergency Relief\r\nCoordinator, Mr. Jan Egeland, will actively build upon\r\nthe accomplishments of his predecessor to further\r\nstrengthen the humanitarian assistance work of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nOur deliberations on strengthening the\r\ncoordination of emergency humanitarian assistance are\r\ntaking place following a sobering year. While the need\r\nfor the United Nations to continue in its mission of\r\nleading humanitarian assistance around the world has\r\nnot diminished in the least, the threat to the safety and\r\nsecurity of its personnel in the field has been greatly\r\nheightened. That message was painfully brought home\r\nby the attack on United Nations headquarters in\r\nBaghdad on 19 August. That attack was universally\r\ncondemned, but we must do more than condemn. At\r\nthe end of the day, the United Nations must emerge\r\nwith strengthened, rather than weakened, resolve to\r\ncarry on.\r\nMember States must support the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations by ensuring that the atrocity of 19\r\nAugust does not go unpunished. Indeed, impunity for\r\ncrimes committed against United Nations personnel\r\nmust be brought to an end all around the world. It is\r\ndeeply disheartening to learn that although more than\r\n200 civilians have lost their lives to malicious acts\r\nwhile in the service for the United Nations since 1992,\r\nin only 21 cases has legal action been taken by the\r\nMember States concerned to bring the perpetrators to\r\njustice. Efforts must be redoubled to achieve a better\r\nrecord.\r\nWhile our current focus remains on Iraq and a\r\nfew other high-profile cases, the reports submitted by\r\nthe Secretary-General under sub-items (a) to (e) of\r\nagenda item 40 remind us that a much larger part of\r\nhumankind requires continued assistance. Let us not\r\nforget the “forgotten emergencies”. It is rare that\r\nhumanitarian assistance can be effective with short-\r\nterm intervention.\r\nA clear case in point is the HIV/AIDS pandemic,\r\nwhich has reached crisis levels in many developing\r\ncountries. As was discussed during the high-level\r\ndialogue on the issue earlier during this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, when HIV/AIDS combines with\r\nother elements of humanitarian need in many poor\r\ncountries the result is an escalation of vulnerability.\r\nThe fight against HIV/AIDS must therefore be\r\nintegrated into efforts to overcome complex\r\nemergencies in those countries.\r\nFurthermore, the Republic of Korea believes that\r\nhumanitarian assistance should be seen in the long-\r\nterm perspective of rehabilitation and development. In\r\nthat regard, we view the transition from relief to\r\ndevelopment as an important area of work for the\r\nUnited Nations in coordinating humanitarian\r\nassistance. We welcome the outcome of the Economic\r\nand Social Council’s deliberations on that issue. We\r\nhope that the Executive Committee on Humanitarian\r\nAffairs and United Nations Development Group review\r\nof the issues involved will generate useful\r\nrecommendations.\r\nThe Republic of Korea also emphasizes the\r\nimportance of safe and unhampered access by\r\nhumanitarian personnel to vulnerable populations, as\r\nwell as of transparency in humanitarian assistance. It\r\ngoes without saying that assistance must reach the\r\npeople who need it. But that may not always be the\r\ncase. We encourage the programmes, funds and\r\nagencies of the United Nations to take further steps in\r\nthat regard, knowing full well that the concrete steps to\r\nbe taken will vary depending on the circumstances on\r\nthe ground.\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nIn closing, I would like to reiterate the abiding\r\ncommitment of the Republic of Korea to supporting,\r\nand actively participating in, the humanitarian\r\nactivities of the United Nations on the basis of the\r\nprinciples of independence, neutrality, impartiality and\r\nhumanity.\r\nMs. Enkhtsetseg (Mongolia): The extent and\r\nnature of the developments and challenges in the\r\nhumanitarian field have become increasingly complex\r\nover the past few years. Humanitarian emergencies,\r\nexacerbated by protracted and emerging conflicts,\r\nepidemics like HIV/AIDS and the frequent occurrence\r\nof natural disasters in many parts of the world,\r\nincreasingly require an effective, adequate and timely\r\nresponse. In order to ensure the provision of such a\r\nresponse, we must deliberate on a number of issues\r\nraised by the Secretary-General in his reports\r\nsubmitted under the agenda item under consideration.\r\nThose issues include, among others, the transition from\r\nrelief to development, humanitarian financing and the\r\neffectiveness of humanitarian assistance, the protection\r\nof civilians, emergency preparedness, natural disasters,\r\ninternally displaced persons and HIV/AIDS in the\r\ncontext of emergencies.\r\nMy delegation, while associating itself with the\r\nstatement made yesterday by the representative of\r\nMorocco on behalf of the Group of 77 and China,\r\nwishes to make a few additional remarks.\r\nFor humanitarian assistance to be adequate it has\r\nto be commensurate with the needs of a given\r\nemergency, equitably distributed and effectively\r\nmanaged. It seems all three areas are interrelated, and\r\nall have room for further improvement. As seen from\r\nthe reports of the Secretary-General, there is no\r\nconsistency in the way in which humanitarian needs are\r\ncurrently assessed. Assessments vary to a great degree,\r\nnot just between countries but also from year to year.\r\nIn our view, although assessing the adequacy of\r\nhumanitarian assistance in relation to need is a\r\ncomplex task, a common tool to analyse and diagnose a\r\ngiven situation has to be developed, and it must be\r\nconsistently applied. That will help to restore the trust\r\nof donors in the value of assessments and will\r\ncontribute towards ensuring a more equitable\r\ndistribution of humanitarian assistance.\r\nAnother area requiring attention is the need to\r\ndevelop definitions that clearly identify eligible flows\r\nand provide a qualitative description of humanitarian\r\nassistance in order to redress the present disturbing\r\nsituation when various uses of humanitarian assistance\r\nlead to a blurring of the distinction between\r\nhumanitarian assistance and official development\r\nassistance. In that respect, my delegation wishes to\r\nemphasize the importance of the call made in the\r\nEconomic and Social Council this year for\r\nhumanitarian assistance to be provided in a way that is\r\nnot to the detriment of resources made available for\r\ndevelopment cooperation.\r\nMy delegation strongly supports further\r\nenhancement of the central and unique role of the\r\nUnited Nations in providing leadership for operations\r\nand coordination of international humanitarian action.\r\nWe commend the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for the important role it\r\nplays in responding to complex humanitarian crises\r\naround the world. My delegation would like to take this\r\nopportunity to thank former Under-Secretary-General\r\nKenzo Oshima for his indomitable perseverance and\r\nable stewardship, as well as to welcome his successor,\r\nMr. Jan Egeland. We wish him well in undertaking his\r\nonerous responsibilities.\r\nThe frequency and magnitude of natural disasters\r\nhave considerably increased over the past three\r\ndecades, resulting in enormous human and material\r\nloss. On the other hand, it is heartening to note that due\r\nto the development of better knowledge of hazardous\r\nconditions and the investment made in protective\r\nmeasures, a dramatic decline has been registered in the\r\nnumber of deaths from natural disasters in the same\r\nperiod. Nonetheless, capacity-building to enhance\r\npreparedness for, and reduce the impact of, natural\r\ndisasters remains a major challenge, especially in\r\ndeveloping countries. It is undisputable that the most\r\neffective way to mitigate the consequences of natural\r\ndisasters is to have adequate capacity at both the\r\nnational and local levels, including an efficient and\r\ncredible early warning system, the accurate and speedy\r\nassessment of emergencies, with the active\r\ninvolvement of donors, timely advocacy and coherent\r\ncoordination and greater synergy among all the major\r\nactors.\r\nFor a country with an extremely low population\r\ndensity, vast territory and weak infrastructure,\r\nMongolia’s high susceptibility to natural disasters\r\nresults in added vulnerability. Mongolia is subject to a\r\nnumber of disasters, including droughts, forest fires,\r\nfloods, earthquakes and dzud, which entails extremely\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nharsh winters with severe snowstorms. For the past 4\r\nyears, Mongolia has been hit hard by successive\r\ndroughts in summer and dzud in winter. The toll on\r\npeople has been immense, given the devastating\r\neconomic and social consequences of natural disasters\r\nand their impact on a small and vulnerable economy\r\ncaught in the midst of transition. During the first two\r\nwinters, my Government, in collaboration with the\r\nUnited Nations, had to raise international support\r\nthrough emergency appeals. My delegation would like\r\nto take this opportunity to thank wholeheartedly all our\r\nbilateral and multilateral partners for their generous\r\nsupport and assistance to mitigate the consequences of\r\nthe disaster.\r\nAs natural disasters — including dzud, droughts\r\nand forest fires — are recurring phenomena, my\r\nGovernment, in collaboration with the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and the financial support of\r\ndonors, has endeavoured to develop a longer-term\r\nstrategy for disaster preparedness and management to\r\nsupplement immediate relief measures. The necessary\r\nlegislative and administrative action has been taken to\r\ndevelop national capacity for disaster preparedness and\r\nmanagement, including moving responsibility for\r\ndisaster management affairs from military to civilian\r\ncontrol. We look forward to continued cooperation in\r\nstrengthening natural disaster preparedness and\r\nresponse capacities at the local, national and regional\r\nlevels.\r\nLast but not least, my delegation wishes to echo\r\nwhat has been said by many others in underscoring the\r\nimportance of ensuring the safety and security of\r\nhumanitarian workers, including United Nations staff.\r\nIn that connection, I would again like to reiterate that\r\nMongolia, along with other nations, resolutely\r\ncondemned the barbaric attack on United Nations\r\nheadquarters in Baghdad last August. United Nations\r\nstaff are emissaries of peace. In every corner of the\r\nworld — under the most difficult and, at times\r\ndangerous, circumstances — they dedicate their lives\r\nto helping people in need. We pay tribute to the late\r\nSpecial Representative Sergio Vieira de Mello, his\r\ncolleagues and the many others who have dedicated\r\nthemselves to the ideals of humankind.\r\nMr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan) (spoke in\r\nRussian): I would first like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the report (A/58/332) he has submitted\r\nunder agenda item 41 (c), entitled “Strengthening of\r\nthe coordination of humanitarian and disaster relief\r\nassistance of the United Nations, including special\r\neconomic assistance: strengthening of international\r\ncooperation and coordination of efforts to study,\r\nmitigate and minimize the consequences of the\r\nChernobyl disaster”. That report provides a complete\r\nassessment of the implementation of General Assembly\r\nresolution 56/109.\r\nSince the adoption of resolution 56/109, the\r\ninternational community and the three States most\r\naffected by the Chernobyl disaster have made\r\nconsiderable efforts to overcome the aftermath of that\r\ncatastrophe. In that regard, we would like to praise the\r\nwork of the multidisciplinary international inter-agency\r\nmission that studied the humanitarian consequences of\r\nthe accident as part of the fresh assessment of the\r\nChernobyl situation being carried out by the United\r\nNations. The mission’s report on that issue, which was\r\nlaunched in New York in February 2002, gave fresh\r\nimpetus to the work done by the entire international\r\ncommunity to implement a range of initiatives in the\r\nregion in the areas of health, socio-economic\r\ndevelopment and environmental protection.\r\nKazakhstan welcomes the concrete steps\r\nmentioned in the report of the Secretary-General that\r\nhave been taken by Member States to enhance\r\ncooperation in Belarus, the Russian Federation and\r\nUkraine. We believe that the results that have been\r\nachieved in that regard provide a concrete example of\r\njoint, goal-oriented work by Governments and the\r\nUnited Nations to implement agreements reached.\r\nThe implementation of such projects as the one\r\nestablished with the help of the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) to set up local social and psychological\r\nrehabilitation centres in Belarus, the Russian\r\nFederation and Ukraine and the joint programme by the\r\nFood and Agricultural Organization of the United\r\nNations (FAO) and International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) to reduce people’s exposure to food-\r\nborne radioactivity, as well as programmes aimed, inter\r\nalia, at developing agriculture in the affected regions,\r\npoints to the fact that a serious approach is being taken\r\nto finding effective ways to address those problems.\r\nKazakhstan would also like to hail the assistance that\r\nhas been provided by the donor community for several\r\nprojects to study, alleviate and minimize the\r\nconsequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe. We believe\r\nsuch assistance to be both extremely timely and\r\nessential.\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nAt the same time, we agree with the comments\r\ncontained both in the report of the Secretary-General\r\nand in the annexed reports of the Governments of\r\nBelarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine that\r\ncurrent aspects of the Chernobyl problem require\r\nstrengthened international coordination and\r\ncooperation to implement the relevant resolutions of\r\nthe General Assembly and the various projects and\r\nagreements linked to the Chernobyl problem. We also\r\nbelieve that the role of information and dissemination\r\nactivities must be enhanced in order to draw the\r\ninternational community’s attention to events of such\r\ndevastating scope and consequences as the Chernobyl\r\ncatastrophe. In that regard, my delegation supports the\r\nproposal to declare 26 April the International Day of\r\nRemembrance of Victims of Radiation Accidents and\r\nCatastrophes. We also support, and will join in\r\nsponsoring, the draft resolution on Chernobyl to be\r\nintroduced at the General Assembly during this\r\nsession.\r\nThe Chernobyl tragedy, which affected three\r\nStates in particular, is an event that was keenly felt in\r\nmy country, on whose territory the former\r\nSemipalatinsk nuclear testing ground was located — a\r\nplace where, over more than 40 years, approximately\r\n500 nuclear devices were tested. Those tests caused\r\ntremendous harm to the health of the population and\r\nenvironment of Kazakhstan. Statistics indicate that\r\napproximately 1.5 million people received very high\r\ndoses of radiation. The highest level of oncological\r\ndisease in Kazakhstan affects the inhabitants of the\r\nSemipalatinsk region. Since 1950, the infant mortality\r\nrate has increased by a factor of 10, and life expectancy\r\nhas been dropping steadily.\r\nWe are grateful to the world community for its\r\nsupport in providing humanitarian and social economic\r\nassistance and in helping rehabilitate the environment\r\nin the Semipalatinsk region. At the same time, we see\r\nthat there is an acute need to enhance and increase the\r\ninternational community’s efforts to implement the\r\nprovisions of the relevant resolutions on Semipalatinsk\r\nand the recommendations on mobilizing financial\r\nresources.\r\nThe Chernobyl catastrophe continues to be an\r\nextremely serious problem, not only for the countries\r\nmost seriously affected, but also for the entire world.\r\nWe are convinced that possible ways of alleviating and\r\nminimizing the consequences of this tragedy, as well as\r\nthe tragedy of the Semipalatinsk region, involve\r\neffective implementation of decisions regarding these\r\nproblems. To give fresh impetus to cooperation in this\r\narea, we need to improve coordination and interaction\r\namong all parties to the process at the national,\r\nregional and global levels.\r\nMr. Morales (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\ndelegation of Panama is honoured to address this\r\nplenary meeting on General Assembly agenda item\r\n40 (b), on behalf of Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador,\r\nGuatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama.\r\nOur countries attach special importance to the\r\nAlliance for Sustainable Development (ALIDES), as a\r\nsubregional political framework which, institutionally,\r\nrepresents the commitment of the Central American\r\nregion to sustainable development.\r\nALIDES has been an appropriate mechanism for\r\nestablishing our subregional priorities in the economic,\r\nsocial, political, cultural and environmental areas.\r\nThrough this initiative, Central America has sought to\r\nstrengthen the coordination of humanitarian assistance,\r\ndisaster relief and special economic assistance for the\r\nsubregion.\r\nThrough ALIDES, we the Central American\r\nnations have focused our efforts on achieving greater\r\nand more effective agreement on macroeconomic\r\npolicies and enhanced modernization of our energy,\r\ntransportation and telecommunications infrastructures.\r\nThis Alliance has also been a uniquely important factor\r\nin the significant progress we have made towards\r\nconsolidating peace, based on democratic processes\r\nand unswerving respect for human rights, as well as in\r\nefforts to achieve the safety and security of our citizens\r\nand regional integration.\r\nAll that notwithstanding, we have noted with\r\nconcern the significant reduction in the past two years\r\nin non-reimbursable cooperation of donor countries in\r\nboth regional and national contexts. This has occurred\r\nat a time when there has been a considerable decline in\r\ninvestment resources throughout the Central American\r\nregion.\r\nDespite that, we wish to underscore on this\r\noccasion the work being carried under the ALIDES\r\nsystem by the Central American Centre for the\r\nPrevention of Natural Disasters (CEPREDENAC). This\r\nCentre assists our countries in developing more\r\neffective strategies to mitigate the impact of natural\r\ndisasters. It has made great efforts to establish early\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nwarning networks in the various countries of the\r\nregion.\r\nThe Central American countries are delighted at\r\nthe decision of the CEPREDENAC Board of Directors\r\nto hold the “Mitch Plus 5” regional forum, in\r\nconjunction with the Strategic Framework for the\r\nReduction of Vulnerabilities and Disasters in Central\r\nAmerica and the Regional Programme for Risk\r\nManagement in Central America, CEPREDENAC-\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\r\nWe are pleased to announce the recent signing in\r\nBrussels of a political dialogue and cooperation\r\nagreement between the European Union and Central\r\nAmerica, which strengthens the process of the San Jose\r\ndialogue and also covers economic, immigration and\r\nthe international fight against terrorism. The outcome\r\nof very cordial negotiations, this instrument represents\r\nan important step towards strengthening relations\r\nbetween the two regions and towards promoting\r\nCentral American integration.\r\nWe also consider it extremely important to inform\r\nMembers that, on 12 December 2002, at the European\r\nheadquarters of the World Bank in Paris,\r\nrepresentatives of bilateral and multilateral\r\ndevelopment agencies renewed their commitment to\r\nthe Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. Our Biological\r\nCorridor, with a surface area similar to that of Great\r\nBritain, and representing 20 per cent of the territory of\r\nCentral America, protects an area that stretches from\r\nsouthern Mexico to Panama. Those protected areas are\r\nhome to 24,000 species of flora and over 500 species of\r\nmammals.\r\nThe Central American countries wish to reiterate\r\ntheir hope that the sustained support of the\r\ninternational community and the United Nations\r\nsystem, which are vital to attaining the goals contained\r\nin the plan of action of our Alliance for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, will continue to be given in the future,\r\nbecause only by mobilizing adequate resources to\r\nsupport this initiative will we be able to alleviate\r\nextreme poverty, conserve the environment and provide\r\nbenefits of sustainable development of this subregion.\r\nAs proof of the commitment not only of our\r\ncountries, but of the entire region, this year we will\r\nsubmit once again the draft resolution on international\r\nassistance and cooperation for the Alliance for the\r\nSustainable Development of Central America. We\r\nrequest the firm support of other Member States for\r\nthat draft resolution.\r\nMr. Mekel (Israel): I would like to devote my\r\nstatement to item 40 (e), entitled “Assistance to the\r\nPalestinian people”. Unfortunately, the issue addressed\r\nby this item was highly misrepresented during this\r\ndebate.\r\nIsrael supports efforts made by the donor and\r\ninternational communities to alleviate the hardships of\r\nthe Palestinian population in the West Bank and Gaza.\r\nIsrael is sensitive to the humanitarian and economic\r\nneeds of the Palestinian people and views the\r\naddressing of those needs as a fundamental Israeli\r\ninterest.\r\nThe provision of assistance to the Palestinian\r\npeople is a primary component of Israeli policy, arising\r\nfrom our belief that stimulating the economic growth\r\nof the Palestinian economy and enhancing the welfare\r\nof the Palestinian population is integral to the future of\r\nour region.\r\nDespite Israel’s mounting security concerns, we\r\nhave endeavoured, to the greatest extent possible, to\r\npermit a steady flow of food, medicine, humanitarian\r\nassistance and other essential supplies. We have done\r\nour utmost to ensure that our legitimate security\r\nprecautions affect Palestinian life and economic\r\nactivity as little as possible.\r\nWe further welcome the efforts of Member States,\r\nas well as those of various international agencies and\r\norganizations, including the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations\r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the\r\nNear East (UNRWA), the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund (UNICEF) and the International Committee of the\r\nRed Cross (ICRC), to improve the living conditions of\r\nPalestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel is\r\ncommitted to ensuring that those organizations are\r\nempowered to fulfil their humanitarian and\r\ndevelopment mandates, despite the extremely difficult\r\nsecurity situation on the ground.\r\nIn the debate on this agenda item, the Palestinian\r\nObserver referred extensively to the deteriorating\r\neconomic and humanitarian condition of the\r\nPalestinians, blaming Israel’s security measures for that\r\nsituation.\r\nWhile the increasing hardship faced by the\r\nPalestinians is a sad truth, the presentation of Israel’s\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nactions as the cause of this suffering is disingenuous —\r\nit is as if one were to begin a story from the middle.\r\nIn actuality, the Palestinian plight is due to two\r\nfactors — the first being the corruption of the\r\nPalestinian leadership, and the second being the\r\nonslaught of Palestinian terrorism.\r\nI would like first to focus on corruption. One\r\nmonth ago, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\r\ndisclosed that its own audit had uncovered the fact that\r\nPalestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat had,\r\nbetween 1995 and 2000, diverted fully $900 million\r\nfrom the budget of the Palestinian Authority into a\r\nspecial bank account under his personal control.\r\nAccording to IMF representative Karim Nashashibi,\r\nthe money — which came from tax revenues collected\r\nby Israel and turned over to Arafat — was used to\r\ninvest in 69 domestic and foreign commercial\r\ncompanies, whose actual owners were not disclosed.\r\nThat report of the IMF is hardly surprising. It merely\r\nconfirms what has long been known about the corrupt\r\nnature of Arafat and of the Palestinian leadership.\r\nFor example, a European Union audit disclosed\r\nthat $20 million in Egyptian funds meant to build low-\r\nincome housing was instead used to build a luxury\r\napartment complex that was given over to top\r\nPalestinian Authority officials and Arafat cronies. Last\r\nyear, Jaweed al-Ghussein, the former Chairman of the\r\nPalestinian National Fund, revealed that Arafat had\r\ntaken more than a half billion dollars in Palestinian\r\npublic funds and transferred it to his own personal\r\naccounts.\r\nOver time, Arafat has accumulated well over $1\r\nbillion in personal wealth. With greedy despots such as\r\nYasser Arafat refusing to relinquish the helm, the\r\ninternational community must accept nothing less than\r\ntotal transparency when extending its assistance to the\r\nPalestinian people.\r\nThis money is not only plundered for personal\r\ngain, it is also diverted to finance terrorism — the\r\nsecond and more acute cause of Palestinian hardship.\r\nFollowing the signing of the 1993 Oslo Accords,\r\nIsrael made substantial efforts to facilitate Palestinian-\r\nIsraeli economic cooperation in the context of the\r\npeace process. As a result, there had been a marked\r\nexpansion of Palestinian trade and employment in\r\nIsrael, as well as other forms of economic cooperation,\r\nfrom 1994 until the outbreak of the present violence.\r\nIsrael, in cooperation with the Palestinian\r\nAuthority, had taken a broad range of actions since\r\n1994 in order to promote and improve the free\r\nmovement of goods and labour from the Palestinian\r\nAuthority areas into Israel. In addition, industrial parks\r\nhave been set up in the Palestinian Authority involving\r\nsubstantial Israeli investment and economic incentives.\r\nThose measures have had a significant positive impact\r\non the Palestinian economy.\r\nHowever, the Palestinian leadership’s decision,\r\nfollowing the Camp David Summit of July 2000, to\r\nemploy violence as a political tool sabotaged Israeli-\r\nPalestinian economic cooperation and left Israel with\r\nno choice but to implement essential security measures\r\nin order to defend itself from Palestinian terrorism. The\r\nacute security threat presented by Palestinian terrorism\r\nmakes these measures unavoidable if Israel is to fulfil\r\nits duty as a sovereign State to safeguard the lives of its\r\ncitizens.\r\nIt must be stressed that the purpose of the security\r\nprecautions is not so-called collective punishment.\r\nIsrael has no desire unduly to burden the Palestinian\r\npopulation, but, rather, to ensure the security of Israeli\r\ncitizens facing daily threats to their very lives.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report (A/58/88)\r\nrecognizes the terrorist attacks by Palestinians against\r\nIsraelis as a cause of the present crisis. The challenge\r\nIsrael faces is to do its utmost to protect its citizens,\r\nwhile doing as much as it can to minimize the impact\r\nof tightened security on the Palestinian population,\r\namong whom terrorists hide and operate, in violation of\r\ninternational humanitarian law. This is not an easy job,\r\nand it involves excruciating dilemmas of balancing\r\nconflicting human rights, the most important of which\r\nis the right to life itself. Israel has taken calculated\r\nrisks in order to try to close the gap between security\r\nneeds on the one hand and humanitarian needs on the\r\nother.\r\nDespite the difficult reality presented by the\r\nterrorists, who show no respect for life or for law,\r\nIsraeli policy makes every effort to minimize harm to\r\nthe civilian population and to differentiate it from the\r\nterrorists that callously use civilians as human shields.\r\nIf calm prevails in any particular area, improvements\r\nare implemented there independently of other areas. In\r\naddition, Israel is working with the donor community\r\nand United Nations agencies on mechanisms to\r\noptimize and facilitate humanitarian activities, access\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nand movement under the present security\r\ncircumstances. That effort is noted in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report.\r\nOn 25 May 2003, with the adoption of the road\r\nmap, the Government of Israel immediately began to\r\nimplement measures meant to ease conditions for the\r\nPalestinian population, in anticipation of the\r\nPalestinian Authority’s fulfilment of its primary road\r\nmap obligation — to dismantle the terrorist\r\ninfrastructure.\r\nThose Israeli steps included the following: the\r\ntransfer of Israeli security responsibility to the\r\nPalestinian Authority in Gaza, and the withdrawal of\r\nits forces from that area; authorization for 40,000\r\nPalestinian workers and merchants to enter Israel daily\r\nfrom the West Bank and Gaza in order to strengthen the\r\nPalestinian economy; the authorization of the daily\r\nemployment of an additional 15,000 workers in the\r\nspecial industrial parks located between Israel and the\r\nPalestinian Authority areas, giving a further boost to\r\nthe Palestinian economy; the opening of shipping\r\nterminals allowing daily access for about 2,000 trucks\r\ncarrying merchandise, produce and raw materials into\r\nand out of the West Bank and Gaza from Israel, Jordan\r\nand Egypt; the authorization of tourist entry into\r\nBethlehem and Jericho, important sources of income\r\nfor the Palestinian economy; the elimination of\r\nroadblocks and checkpoints throughout the West Bank\r\nand Gaza in order to improve freedom of movement for\r\nthe Palestinian population; and the extension of the\r\nPalestinian fishing zone out to 12 miles from the Gaza\r\ncoast in order to strengthen that key economic sector.\r\nUnfortunately, the Palestinian Authority, for its\r\npart, did nothing to fulfil its road map obligation to\r\nfight the terrorist organizations, and terrorists used\r\nevery Israeli attempt to ease conditions of Palestinian\r\ndaily life as an opportunity to renew their attacks on\r\nIsraeli citizens. They took advantage of the increased\r\nfreedom of movement to smuggle weapons between\r\nvillages and cities, they exploited this freedom of\r\nmovement to smuggle fugitives, arms, mortar bombs,\r\nartillery rockets and even suicide belts between\r\nvillages and cities and they exploited workers’ passage\r\ninto Israel to infiltrate Israeli cities and carry out\r\nsuicide attacks.\r\nAlthough Israel experienced numerous fatal\r\nterrorist attacks and smaller scale suicide bombings, it\r\ncontinued its policy of easing conditions for\r\nPalestinians until 19 August when a suicide bomber,\r\ntaking advantage of Israel’s economic gestures to the\r\nPalestinians, infiltrated Jerusalem and detonated\r\nhimself on a city bus, killing 23 people, including 6\r\nchildren and infants, and wounding over 130. Needless\r\nto say, Israel was left with no choice but to again\r\nimplement the security measures that are necessary to\r\nprotect its population.\r\nThis illustrates that the unfortunate condition of\r\nthe local civilian population is due, more than any\r\nother factor, to the terrorists themselves and to the\r\nPalestinian Authority which, despite its road map\r\nobligations, allows terrorists free rein. This terrorism\r\nhurts Israelis and Palestinians alike; an end to this\r\nsituation is dependent, first and foremost, upon an end\r\nto violence and terrorism.\r\nConsequently, the Palestinian claim, made here\r\ntoday, that the economic and humanitarian plight of the\r\nPalestinians is due to Israeli security measures ignores\r\nthe connection between cause and effect. If there were\r\nno terrorism, there would be no need for tightened\r\nsecurity and none of the negative economic and\r\nhumanitarian effects that it engenders.\r\nIf the concern of the Palestinian observer for the\r\npopulation in the territories is sincere, then he should\r\nbe confronting the terrorist organizations operating\r\nwithin the areas of the Palestinian Authority and\r\nstopping their violence, rather than blaming Israel for\r\nhaving to protect itself.\r\nAt the end of the day, the welfare and safety of\r\nboth Palestinian and Israeli peoples is inextricably tied\r\nto the fulfilment, once and for all, of the Palestinian\r\nobligation to fight and dismantle terrorism, in\r\naccordance with international law, United Nations\r\nresolutions and the road map. It is this that would\r\nobviate the need for Israeli security measures and pave\r\nthe way for peaceful negotiations, based on mutual\r\nrecognition and mutual compromise, which are the true\r\nguarantee of the welfare, prosperity and security of the\r\npeoples of the region.\r\nMr. Zenna (Ethiopia): The Ethiopian delegation\r\nwould like to convey its thanks to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report on agenda item\r\n40 (b), regarding emergency humanitarian assistance to\r\nEthiopia. My delegation associates itself with the\r\nstatement made by Morocco, on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China. We would like to welcome Mr. Jan\r\nEgeland, the newly appointed United Nations Under-\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nSecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs. Our\r\nappreciation also goes to his predecessor, Mr. Kenzo\r\nOshima, and the organization he led, the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs, for a job well\r\ndone during these trying years.\r\nRecurrent droughts have affected Ethiopia during\r\nthe last 30 years, but their severity and duration varied.\r\nThe droughts that affected the country in the early\r\nseventies and mid-eighties caused enormous human\r\nsuffering and deaths. During the last ten years, there\r\nhave been droughts three to four years out of ten.\r\nDuring this time, the prevalence and area coverage of\r\ndrought increased sharply, but deaths caused by famine\r\nand human suffering were checked.\r\nIn terms of area coverage and the number of\r\npeople affected, the drought that affected the country\r\nduring 2002-2003 is more severe than any the country\r\nfaced before it. The multi-agency assessment team\r\nestimated that a total of 13.2 million people, or some\r\n20 per cent of the population, were at risk beginning\r\nJanuary 2003. Their food needs were estimated at 1.4\r\nmillion tons.\r\nSupporting such a large number of people has\r\nbeen possible because of the Government’s Emergency\r\nFood Security Reserve, which is designed to cover\r\nemergency requirements of food for approximately\r\nfour months for some 4 to 5 million people. Further\r\nmore, the credible early warning system and advocacy\r\nby the Government, United Nations agencies, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, donor representatives and\r\nthe media, coupled with timely and generous responses\r\nby donors, averted unprecedented human suffering.\r\nAllow me at this juncture to thank all those who\r\nextended a helping hand, specifically the United States,\r\nthe European Union and the various United Nations\r\nagencies, funds and programmes.\r\nI would also like to thank His Excellency\r\nMr. Kofi Annan for the commitment and interest he has\r\nshown by appointing a personal representative to\r\nadvise him in finding lasting solutions for the problem\r\nin the region.\r\nRelief support to save the lives of millions of\r\naffected people is a noble act. But it will not solve the\r\nbasic problems that make Ethiopians susceptible to\r\nrecurrent drought. In the long run, the most important\r\nstep is to strengthen the capacity of countries like\r\nEthiopia to grow more. The pivotal point here is to link\r\nrelief to development and, as stated by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan, to create a second Green\r\nRevolution in Africa. That way we can mitigate\r\npoverty and effectively avert the hunger and\r\nmalnutrition that haunt the continent.\r\nBy the same token, when he launched the\r\nMillennium Challenge Account initiative, President\r\nBush emphasized that the account may be used to\r\n“increase harvest where hunger is greatest”. We hope\r\nthat these just words will be realized soon. The\r\nEuropean Union has also long engaged itself in the\r\nsearch for long-term and lasting solutions for the food\r\nsecurity problem in Ethiopia. The Union has committed\r\nitself through budget support and the Cotonou\r\nAgreement financial allocations. We are grateful for\r\nsuch useful supports.\r\nIn order to mitigate the effects of recurrent\r\ndrought and to ensure food security in the short term,\r\nthe Ethiopian Government is taking measures such as\r\nwater harvesting, resettlement, conservation based\r\nagriculture, improving livestock production and\r\nmarketing. The resettlement programme the\r\nGovernment is undertaking tries to avoid as much as\r\npossible the associated economic and social problems.\r\nThe present resettlement programme is fully voluntary\r\nand avoids mixing of peoples of different cultures and\r\nlanguages in order to minimize any social problems\r\nthat might crop up between the settlers and local\r\npopulation. To mitigate problems associated with\r\ncompetition for resources between settlers and local\r\npopulations, the programme is planned and executed at\r\nthe grass-roots level with the full participation of the\r\npeople.\r\nRealizing that mere economic growth or an\r\nincrease in agricultural productivity will not eliminate\r\nfood deficiency, the Government has focused on\r\npoverty eradication policies. To this effect, the\r\ncountry’s sustainable development and poverty-\r\nreduction programme has been built on agriculture-led\r\nindustrialization and food security, against the\r\nbackdrop of justice system and civil service reform,\r\ngood governance, decentralization and empowerment,\r\nas well as capacity-building.\r\nEthiopia’s food security strategy aims to address\r\nboth the supply and demand sides of the food equation:\r\navailability and entitlement. This could be achieved by\r\nensuring food security at both national and household\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nlevels. The strategy is targeted mainly at chronically\r\nfood-insecure, moisture-deficit and pastoral areas.\r\nFinally, while expressing our thanks and\r\nappreciation to the international community for its\r\ntimely and generous humanitarian assistance to the\r\ndrought-affected people of Ethiopia, I appeal to it to\r\nhelp the Government in its endeavour to eliminate the\r\nroot causes of poverty and famine.\r\nMr. Taha (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): First of all,\r\nI would like to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nvaluable report (A/58/225) submitted under agenda\r\nitem 40 (b) and to express appreciation for the efforts\r\nmade by the United Nations and other international\r\norganizations that are part of the United Nations\r\nfamily. We would also like to thank all of the brotherly\r\nand friendly countries that have continued to provide\r\nus with assistance, particularly during and before the\r\nperiod covered by the report — a period during which\r\nthe Sudan had to face a great many problems resulting\r\nfrom natural and other causes.\r\nMy Government’s desire for peace throughout the\r\nterritory of the Sudan is absolute. Anybody involved in\r\nthe peace process will be aware that the Government\r\nhas spared no effort in its attempt to achieve peace and\r\nput an end to war, so as to make it possible for us to\r\neffectively mobilize our efforts and use our many\r\nresources for the well-being and development of our\r\npopulation, as well as to provide assistance and support\r\nto regional organizations for development throughout\r\nthe entire region.\r\nConsiderable progress has been made this year\r\ntowards achieving peace in the Sudan. Indeed, we have\r\nalmost achieved our objective. I believe that the\r\nongoing talks in Kenya will be the last round of talks\r\nand we will finally put an end to the longest civil war\r\non the African continent.\r\nI feel able to say, in a spirit of optimism, that the\r\nnecessary foundation for the achievement of progress\r\nin reaching a final agreement seems to have been\r\nestablished. We believe that the great encouragement\r\nand positive response that we have received from the\r\ninternational community, as reflected in the statements\r\nthat we have heard from a number of countries and\r\nregional organizations in this Hall, will allay the fears\r\nof States and organizations regarding our ability to\r\nbegin a new chapter in our history.\r\nPreserving the peace requires even greater effort\r\nand resolve than actually achieving peace in the first\r\nplace. We would like to associate ourselves with the\r\nconclusions of the Secretary-General in his report, in\r\nparticular those regarding the dire and urgent need to\r\npreserve security and to create social institutions after\r\npeace has been achieved. We would also like to\r\nassociate ourselves with the comments expressed in\r\nparagraph 103 of the report, which indicates that\r\nassistance partners must act urgently to create\r\nmechanisms to consolidate the foundations of any\r\nnegotiated peace.\r\nWe have elaborated a number of plans and\r\nstrategies for the post-conflict period. In this\r\nconnection, I would like to refer to the funds that have\r\nbeen set up or are being set up to assist in\r\nreconstruction in the south, whether under the auspices\r\nof the League of Arab States or other parties. A fund\r\nwas also set up at the Islamic Summit meeting recently\r\nheld in Malaysia with a view to supporting\r\nreconstruction in the south.\r\nAt the national level, the Government of Sudan\r\nhas set up a fund for the reconstruction of the south and\r\nother war-stricken areas. That fund has now moved\r\nbeyond the stage of planning, strategy and needs and\r\nhas begun to mobilize assistance. We hope that the\r\nUnited Nations and the specialized agencies will also\r\nbe involved in the reconstruction effort, because their\r\ncommitment will indeed make it possible for\r\nreconstruction and for consolidating the foundations of\r\npeace.\r\nMr. Amirbayov (Azerbaijan): The strengthening\r\nof the coordination of emergency humanitarian\r\nassistance of the United Nations is an issue that is of\r\ngreat importance from our national perspective as a\r\nmatter of principle.\r\nExperience during the past decade proves that the\r\neffective and timely distribution of emergency\r\nhumanitarian assistance to refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons suffering in various ongoing\r\nconflicts throughout the world depends on the\r\navailability of international, regional and local\r\nresources. Tackling this challenge is far beyond the\r\ncapacity of individual States or organizations and\r\nrequires a collective response on the part of major\r\nactors at all levels. Furthermore, it necessitates\r\neffective coordination among an increased number of\r\nhumanitarian actors in the field — actors with different\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nkinds of expertise, mandates and resources — and their\r\ncollaboration with local authorities. As a natural part of\r\nany humanitarian effort, the local authorities, in their\r\nturn, must ensure safe and unhindered functioning of\r\nhumanitarian personnel acting in the field.\r\nWhile fully understanding that primary\r\nresponsibility for a solution to the problem of refugees\r\nand internally displaced persons (IDPs) rests with the\r\ncountries concerned, one can hardly disregard the fact\r\nthat national efforts to that end may not necessarily be\r\nsimilar from country to country. The substance and\r\nquality of these efforts would certainly differ,\r\ndepending on factors such as the security and\r\ndevelopment situation of a country, availability of\r\nextrabudgetary resources and a country’s experience in\r\nhandling refugee situations.\r\nThis is particularly evident in situations where\r\ncountries suffer from the consequences of protracted\r\nconflict. Azerbaijan, a small developing country with\r\nan economy in transition and a total population of 8\r\nmillion, has for 15 years been home to 1 million\r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons as a result of\r\nthe armed aggression and continuing occupation by\r\nArmenia of Azerbaijan’s territories.\r\nTen years have passed since both the Security\r\nCouncil, in its four resolutions 822 (1993), 853 (1993),\r\n874 (1993) and 884 (1993), and the General Assembly,\r\nin its resolution 48/114, entitled “Emergency\r\ninternational assistance to refugees and displaced\r\npersons in Azerbaijan”, adopted at the forty-eighth\r\nsession, expressed their grave concern at the\r\nhumanitarian situation in Azerbaijan and appealed to\r\nall States and organizations to provide adequate and\r\nsufficient financial, medical and material assistance to\r\nthe refugees and IDPs in my country. On behalf of\r\nthese people I would like to thank all those who\r\nprovided and continue to provide much needed\r\nhumanitarian assistance to this vulnerable group of\r\npeople.\r\nHowever, despite the contributions of donors and\r\nthe activities of relevant humanitarian actors, the\r\nprotracted character of this armed conflict and the lack\r\nof progress towards a settlement have had a negative\r\nimpact on the situation of refugees and IDPs in\r\nAzerbaijan. Due to insufficient funding and a shortage\r\nof humanitarian assistance we are seeking possible\r\nways to offer immediate responses to the current\r\ndemands of refugees and IDPs, although the long-term\r\nresolution of this problem is inevitably linked to\r\nsettlement of the conflict and the return of refugees and\r\nIDPs to their places of origin.\r\nThe decreasing volume of humanitarian\r\nassistance accompanied by the departure of foreign aid\r\nagencies which have assisted with the provision of\r\nfood and materials to refugee camps for the past\r\ndecade, has caused despair and frustration — in the\r\nfirst place, among the affected population. Massive\r\neconomic transformation and restricted financial\r\nresources have curtailed the capacity of Azerbaijan to\r\nprovide basic social services for refugees and IDPs.\r\nCurrently, the volume of humanitarian assistance does\r\nnot cover the most pressing needs of this fragile part of\r\nour society.\r\nNevertheless, the Government of Azerbaijan,\r\nusing its limited resources, spares no effort to mitigate\r\nthe suffering of the affected population, and has\r\nrecently made a further allocation of more than $70\r\nmillion to the construction of housing for refugees.\r\nHowever, being stuck in a situation of “no war, no\r\npeace” in its conflict with Armenia, and confused in\r\nthe transition from relief to development, Azerbaijan\r\nmust nevertheless keep up with the demands of its\r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons. Another\r\nissue is that the United Nations and its institutions\r\nacting in Azerbaijan, having shifted from the phase of\r\nemergency humanitarian assistance to the stage of\r\ndevelopment, do not adequately respond to the\r\nestimated needs. This is a situation where a clear-cut\r\nbalance should be struck between the delivery of\r\nemergency humanitarian assistance and activities for\r\nrecovery and development. In our view, correctly\r\nproportioned assistance, applied in the right place at\r\nthe right time, requires the integration of Government\r\ninto the planning and coordination phases from the\r\nvery start so that Government can effectively integrate\r\nits own resources with those provided by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn our particular case, Azerbaijani concerns\r\nstemming from the premature application of the stage\r\nof transition from relief to development, a stage which\r\nis more relevant to the post-conflict rehabilitation\r\nstage, must be addressed, including with respect to our\r\nconcern to ensure the sustainability of the return of the\r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons to their\r\nnative lands. Effective transition from relief to\r\ndevelopment in the situation of a protracted conflict\r\nshould envisage continuation of the delivery of\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nemergency humanitarian assistance during the initial\r\nstages of transition. Moreover, development-related\r\nprojects ought not to be carried out at the expense of\r\nemergency humanitarian assistance.\r\nThe role of United Nations country teams led by\r\nResident Coordinators should be of primary importance\r\nfor the definition and formulation of coherent, flexible\r\nstrategies based on the specifics of the country\r\nconcerned and the availability of resources. In that\r\ncontext, we agree with the proposal put forward in the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on strengthening the\r\ncoordination of humanitarian assistance of the United\r\nNations (A/58/89), on the basis of the observation that\r\nthe effective transfer from the usual humanitarian\r\nassistance coordination system to that of United\r\nNations Resident Coordinators, which would maintain\r\nappropriate levels of capacity and support during\r\nemergencies and transition, will be possible only if the\r\nResident Coordinator system is strengthened. More\r\nflexibility in utilizing existing financial resources\r\nwould allow the Resident Coordinators to carry out\r\nmore efficiently the assessment and consequent\r\nfinancing of humanitarian needs.\r\nEffective and timely United Nations assistance to\r\nmitigate the humanitarian situation is a key factor in\r\nensuring protection of the civilian population during\r\narmed conflict. I would like to hope that our\r\ndeliberations today will pave the way, if not for\r\nprogress in bringing such conflicts to an end, then at\r\nleast for a clearer definition and understanding of what\r\nshould constitute a humanitarian response that is\r\nsufficient to adequately meet the needs of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons.\r\nMr. Sow (Guinea) (spoke in French): My\r\ndelegation is grateful to the Secretary-General for his\r\nreports on strengthening of the coordination of\r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief assistance of the\r\nUnited Nations, including special economic assistance.\r\nWe support the statement made by the representative of\r\nMorocco on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe importance of humanitarian issues resulting\r\nfrom conflicts, natural disasters and epidemics has\r\nprompted the Assembly to adopt, inter alia, resolution\r\n46/182, which emphasizes what is at stake and\r\nproposes solutions. In the same context, the\r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and the\r\nBrahimi report (A/55/305) took a detailed and\r\ninstructive approach to this question. Since then, a\r\ngreat deal of experience has been gained. Those\r\ninvolved in emergency situation management have\r\nconstantly combined their efforts in order to make\r\nhumanitarian action more operational.\r\nAnalysis of the reports before us, which describe\r\nin detail the problems under consideration, leads my\r\ndelegation to say that the record of developments in the\r\nhumanitarian situation in the past year is uneven. This\r\nis due, on the one hand, to the upsurge of conflicts and\r\ndisasters in some parts of the world and, on the other\r\nhand, to their mitigation in other parts of the world,\r\nmaking concerted solutions necessary among the actors\r\ninvolved at the international, regional, subregional and\r\nnational levels.\r\nThe diversity of actors in the humanitarian field\r\nand the multidimensional nature of the questions to be\r\nresolved require coordination and close collaboration\r\nbetween the General Assembly and other United\r\nNations organs and agencies on the one hand, and the\r\nother actors involved on the other. This also\r\npresupposes a concise definition of humanitarian aid\r\nwith a view to focusing its mandate and operations on\r\nwhat is essential.\r\nMy delegation acknowledges the primary\r\nresponsibility of States in the protection of civilians.\r\nHowever, one must not underestimate the responsibility\r\nof other actors, especially those in conflict. We\r\nwelcome the organization of regional workshops on the\r\nissue, as reflected in paragraph 10 of the report, and we\r\nhope that the conclusions of such workshops will be\r\nbroadly disseminated. We believe that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendations contained in the three\r\nreports on the subject will help to further guide the\r\ninternational community’s activities. The aide-mémoire\r\nand the road map now being finalized will also be of\r\ngreat usefulness.\r\nWe appreciate the interest aroused by the safety\r\nand security of United Nations personnel, associated\r\npersonnel and personnel of humanitarian organizations.\r\nIn that context, the Security Council’s recent adoption\r\nof resolution 1502 (2003) strengthens the instruments\r\nin force; it is incumbent on the international\r\ncommunity to ensure their implementation.\r\nThe issue of the relationship between\r\nhumanitarian and military personnel deserves attention.\r\nWe appreciate the provisions prepared by the Inter-\r\nAgency Standing Committee (IASC) and hope that\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nthey will enable us to find appropriate solutions in that\r\nregard.\r\nWith respect to refugees and displaced persons, it\r\nis useful to emphasize the large numbers involved and\r\nto note that, despite the issue’s general nature, it is\r\nappropriate to take a case-by-case approach, which\r\nwould permit the sharing of experiences within the\r\nframework of a comparative advantage approach. Thus\r\nthe Angolan experience, as described in paragraph 15,\r\nis worth sharing.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the IASC’s\r\nconsideration of issues related to vulnerable persons —\r\nparticularly women — and to exploitation and sexual\r\nviolence in humanitarian crisis situations. We believe\r\nthat the IASC’s elaboration of a series of policies,\r\nstrategies and guidelines aimed at ensuring systematic\r\nconsideration of women’s priorities, experiences and\r\nparticular needs and the adoption of an action plan for\r\nprotection against exploitation and sexual violence in\r\nhumanitarian crisis situations, developed by the\r\nworking group on the problem, will contribute to a\r\nbetter understanding of those phenomena with a view\r\nto finding appropriate solutions.\r\nIn order to ensure that humanitarian action is\r\noperational, we should strengthen coordination and\r\ncooperation among all humanitarian actors, particularly\r\npublic and civil society actors. In that connection, we\r\nwelcome the ongoing initiatives of the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs with the United\r\nNations Development Programme, on the one hand,\r\nand with the United Nations Environment Programme,\r\non the other, in the framework of global disaster\r\nmanagement and an international partnership on an\r\nintegrated approach to prevention, preparation and\r\ninterventions in urgent environmental situations with a\r\nview to promoting sustainable development.\r\nWe appreciate the efforts of the Special Envoy of\r\nthe Secretary-General in Southern African and the\r\nHorn of Africa, which have enabled us to alleviate the\r\ndevastating effects of the drought and HIV/AIDS and\r\nto undertake adequate measures. We encourage the\r\nIASC to complete the guidelines on organizing\r\nemergency interventions to ensure the integration of\r\nelements related to HIV/AIDS into all relevant\r\nplanning fields, so as to facilitate global anti-\r\nHIV/AIDS action in humanitarian crises.\r\nFurthermore, we note with concern the\r\nconsiderations affecting the financing of humanitarian\r\nactivities, as described in the report. The three issues of\r\nthe sufficiency of humanitarian aid, its equitable\r\ndistribution and its effective management are more\r\ntopical than ever. We are also concerned about the\r\nincrease in the volume of activities that parallels a\r\ndecline in official development assistance. The\r\nprovisions of paragraph 11 of the annex to resolution\r\n46/182 should continue to guide donors’ activities\r\naimed at dealing with that problem.\r\nMy delegation shares the observations made in\r\nthe report on the financing issue. We reaffirm that,\r\ngiven the interests at stake, the allocation of resources\r\nmust be based on needs in order to avoid undertaking\r\ndisparate activities with limited capacity to intervene.\r\nIn addition, donors will have to show greater\r\nconfidence in the United Nations coordination system\r\nand facilitate the establishment of mechanisms that will\r\nenable it to demonstrate greater flexibility, by\r\nincreasing the amount of resources that are not\r\nreserved for specific use in emergency situations.\r\nAs the Assembly may note, my delegation’s\r\ninterest in the item under consideration results from the\r\nsituation of Africa in general and the West African\r\nsubregion in particular, where natural disasters and\r\nespecially conflicts have occurred in recent years. My\r\ncountry, Guinea — which borders on countries of the\r\nsubregion that are in a post-conflict situation — has\r\nsuffered humanitarian and other types of consequences.\r\nThe prolonged presence of refugees and the\r\ndisplacement of persons within the country after the\r\nrebel attacks of 2000 have affected the socio-cultural\r\ninfrastructure and diverted funds initially intended for\r\ndevelopment programmes.\r\nThe Government of Guinea, mindful of its\r\ninternational commitments and faithful to its African\r\nhumanitarian tradition, has not only agreed to make\r\nenormous efforts to contain that situation’s effects but\r\nhas also participated with other actors of the\r\ninternational community — most particularly those of\r\nthe subregion — in efforts to restore security, peace\r\nand stability in the subregion in general and more\r\nparticularly in the countries affected by the conflicts. In\r\nthe light of our experience, my delegation attaches\r\nsustained importance to the issue of the capacity to\r\ncoordinate humanitarian operations and the\r\nestablishment of new competences related to the\r\nprincipal aspects of transition: peace-building, socio-\r\neconomic recovery and re-establishment of the\r\ninstitutions of civil administration and of Government.\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nI cannot conclude without highlighting the\r\nimportance of preventing natural disasters and\r\nconflicts. In that regard, we welcome the existing\r\nstructures — particularly the early-warning instruments\r\nand means of United Nations departments and bodies\r\nand the Economic and Social Council’s Ad Hoc\r\nAdvisory Group on African Countries Emerging from\r\nConflict, as well as the Security Council’s Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group on Conflict Prevention and Resolution\r\nin Africa, whose activities deserve to be supported. We\r\nshould also devote attention to the recommendations\r\nmade by the Secretary-General in his report on\r\nprevention of armed conflict (A/55/985). Finally, we\r\nhope that the second World Conference on Natural\r\nDisaster Reduction, to be held in Kobe, Japan, from 18\r\nto 22 January 2005, will serve as an opportunity to\r\nmeet countries’ expectations and needs, given the\r\nnegative effects of such disasters.\r\nMr. ahović (Serbia and Montenegro): At the\r\noutset, I would like to thank the Secretary-General for\r\nthe comprehensive and informative reports submitted\r\nunder the agenda item under consideration.\r\nThe reports clearly indicate that humanitarian\r\noperations are becoming more complex and larger, both\r\nin scale and number. At the same time, the work of the\r\nhumanitarian personnel all over the world is becoming\r\nincreasingly dangerous, and is being carried out under\r\nextremely difficult conditions. The tragic event that\r\ntook place on 19 August of this year in Baghdad is the\r\nlatest demonstration of the serious, and indeed deadly,\r\nthreats to the safety and security of United Nations\r\npersonnel. Obviously, a strengthened and unified\r\nsecurity management system for the United Nations is\r\nneeded, as stated in the report contained in document\r\nA/58/344. Humanitarian staff need to operate in as\r\nsecure and safe an environment as possible in order to\r\ndeliver assistance successfully.\r\nWe believe that the ultimate goal of humanitarian\r\nassistance in post-conflict situations is to ensure that\r\ndurable solutions are found, thereby setting the stage\r\nfor sustainable development. As recognized in\r\nresolution 2003/5 of the Economic and Social Council,\r\nit is of critical importance for the successful\r\nmanagement of transition from relief to development\r\nthat more support is given to recovery and long-term\r\ndevelopment activities, capacity-building at all relevant\r\nlevels and the enhancement of national ownership. The\r\nissue of transition from relief to development should be\r\nfurther considered in an integrated manner, with a view\r\nto better understanding the implications of that process\r\nwhile working out the programmes of humanitarian and\r\ndevelopment organizations.\r\nFrom our experience as a country receiving\r\nhumanitarian assistance, and as indicated in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report contained in document\r\nA/58/89, we know that coordination in the context of\r\nthe transition from relief to development is a\r\ndemanding and time-critical process that requires the\r\nfull engagement of Governments and donors at the\r\nearly stages. The process of coordination among\r\nproviders, and between providers and recipients of\r\nassistance, should be constantly reviewed and adjusted\r\nto the real needs in the field to make it more efficient\r\nand avoid competition, overlapping and duplication of\r\nactivities. In order to improve coherence and to give\r\nclear, consolidated and timely guidance to the United\r\nNations system, we fully support the establishment of\r\nthe Executive Committee on Humanitarian Affairs and\r\nthe United Nations Development Group Joint Working\r\nGroup on Transition Issues.\r\nI would like to focus in particular on document\r\nA/58/358, entitled “Economic assistance to the Eastern\r\nEuropean States affected by the developments in the\r\nBalkans”. The report contains a comprehensive review\r\nregarding economic assistance provided, especially to\r\nthe countries of South-Eastern Europe. The report also\r\nattests to the seriousness of the economic problems that\r\nthose States, including mine, are confronting.\r\nAs stated in the report, few countries in the\r\nregion have managed to embark on a path of sustained\r\ngrowth, and many of them still face macro-economic\r\nstabilization problems and are lagging in the process of\r\nintegration into the European economy. We therefore\r\nfully agree with the conclusions in the report that\r\ncontinued donor support, the participation of regional\r\norganizations and the involvement of the private sector\r\nwill be essential for reconstruction, stabilization and\r\ndevelopment in the Balkans.\r\nIn that regard, regional cooperation mechanisms\r\nare of key importance. The Thessaloniki agenda for the\r\nWestern Balkans, which is referred to in the report,\r\nrepresents a significant step forward in the relationship\r\nbetween the European Union and the region. Its\r\nimplementation should, inter alia, facilitate and\r\naccelerate our transition from relief to development.\r\nThe activities of other regional actors, such as the\r\nStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, the European\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nBank for Reconstruction and Development, the\r\nEuropean Investment Bank and other partners are also\r\nvery important. They have a leading role to play in\r\nareas such as the rebuilding of infrastructure,\r\npromoting the private sector and attracting much-\r\nneeded investment.\r\nSerbia and Montenegro is profoundly\r\nrestructuring its economy. In doing so it is mobilizing\r\nits internal resources to overcome its dire starting\r\nposition and to reform rapidly. Our aim is to complete\r\nthe relief-to-development process and to implement\r\ndevelopment policies that promote durable solutions\r\nand strengthen national capacities to meet the basic\r\nneeds of the most vulnerable. The ongoing reform and\r\nrecovery programme is painful. It is also coupled with\r\nsome negative effects that include, for example, rising\r\nunemployment and increased costs in basic services,\r\nwhich affect many segments of society.\r\nNow that the difficult task of reconstruction is\r\nunderway, resources tend to be scarce. Unfortunately,\r\nhumanitarian assistance is decreasing due to a shift in\r\ndonor funding to emergencies in other parts of the\r\nworld. However, humanitarian assistance is still needed\r\nto address widespread poverty, fragile basic services\r\nand the needs of one of the largest displaced\r\npopulations in Europe, namely, the over 380,000\r\nrefugees from the former Yugoslavia and the\r\napproximately 260,000 internally displaced persons\r\n(IDP), most of whom are from Kosovo and Metohija.\r\nOf special importance to us is the assistance, financial\r\nand otherwise, of Member States and international\r\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations\r\nin the implementation of our national strategy to\r\nresolve the problems of refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons. That national strategy, which has\r\nbeen integrated into the overall development strategy\r\nand reform programme of the country, reaffirms our\r\ncommitment to find durable solutions to the problems\r\nof refugees and IDPs. Serbia and Montenegro is also\r\ncooperating bilaterally and regionally with\r\nneighbouring countries to comprehensively address the\r\nplight of refugees.\r\nAs for IDPs, we welcome the fact that the IDP\r\nUnit of the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs is operational, reflecting the need\r\nto solve the complex problems of a growing number of\r\nIDPs. In that context, we would like to point to the\r\nspecific nature of the problem of IDPs in Serbia and\r\nMontenegro. We call upon the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo to enhance its\r\nefforts to fulfil the obligations stemming from Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1244 (1999) and to create the\r\nnecessary conditions for the safe return of IDPs.\r\nThe transition from relief to development in my\r\ncountry has also had an impact on the work of the\r\nprogrammes and agencies of the United Nations.\r\nHumanitarian coordination, under the Resident\r\nCoordinator appointed last year, is aimed at\r\nstrengthening the links between United Nations\r\nagencies and programmes and the national authorities,\r\nas well between relevant regional and other\r\ndevelopment organizations. For our part, we will\r\ncontinue to make efforts to further improve cooperation\r\nand coordination in order to enable that mechanism to\r\naddress actual needs even more effectively. We highly\r\nappreciate the engagement of the United Nations\r\nsystem, including that of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund and the international financial\r\ninstitutions that have continued to assist our country.\r\nHowever, their further input will be necessary.\r\nFinally, allow me to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress our appreciation for the humanitarian\r\nassistance rendered to my country over the past few\r\nyears by a number of States referred to in the report\r\ncontained in document A/58/358, in particular by major\r\ncontributors such as the European Union and\r\ninternational relief agencies and organizations.\r\nMr. Musambachime (Zambia): At the outset, I\r\nwould like to commend the Secretary-General for the\r\nvery comprehensive and concise report contained in\r\ndocument A/58/89, which has been submitted under\r\nthis agenda item. The report refers to issues pertinent\r\nto my country.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report has ably\r\naddressed the theme of strengthening the coordination\r\nof United Nations humanitarian assistance, with\r\nparticular attention to humanitarian financing, the\r\neffectiveness of humanitarian assistance and the\r\ntransition from relief to development. The report also\r\nexamines some of the key humanitarian developments\r\nand challenges of the past year and addresses some of\r\nthe key issues related to the protection of civilians and\r\ninternally displaced persons (IDP), contingency\r\nplanning, natural disasters and HIV in the context of\r\nemergencies.\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.38\r\nWe welcome the proposals in the report which,\r\namong other things, stress the need for increased\r\nnational and regional capacity-building in the early\r\nwarning and monitoring of natural hazards, and natural\r\ndisaster preparedness, mitigation and response by\r\nstrengthening coordination in the areas of information-\r\nsharing and analysis, logistical support, response\r\ncoordination and the strengthening of relationships\r\nwith existing regional structures.\r\nEarlier this month, when my delegation spoke at\r\nthe meeting to discuss the southern African crisis and\r\nthe related consolidated appeals, which were launched\r\nby the United Nations, I took the opportunity to thank\r\nthe United Nations and its partners, particularly the\r\nWorld Food Programme, for coming to the aid of\r\nSouthern Africa, including Zambia, during the period\r\n2002-2003, thus preventing the famine and mass\r\nstarvation that would have ensued had it not been for\r\nsuch prompt intervention.\r\nMy delegation expresses deep appreciation for\r\nthe several visits made by Mr. Oshima, former Under-\r\nSecretary-General in the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs. We also welcome his successor,\r\nMr. Jan Egeland, and promise our support and\r\ncooperation. My delegation also appreciated the visits\r\nmade to Zambia by Mr. James Morris, the Special\r\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General for the humanitarian\r\nsituation in southern Africa. We commend him and his\r\nteam for their commitment and personal efforts to help\r\nthe plight of Zambians and others in the Southern\r\nAfrican region. During his recent visit to Zambia,\r\nMr. Morris, together with  Ms. Machel, met with the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Zambia, Mr. Mwanawasa,\r\nand several key ministers, as well as a cross-section of\r\npolicy-makers and experts on the impact that the HIV\r\npandemic is having on Zambia. The Government is\r\nstudying the recommendations made, with a view to\r\ntaking appropriate action.\r\nDuring the 2001-2002 agricultural season, in\r\nresponse to the food deficit resulting from the drought,\r\nthe Government put in place a number of measures\r\ndesigned to promote agricultural production and\r\nenhance food security. These included, first, the\r\nimportation of some 200,000 tons of maize; secondly,\r\nthe provision of relief food to needy areas; thirdly, the\r\nintroduction of the Food Security Pack programme,\r\naimed at empowering vulnerable farmers with input\r\ncredit; and fourthly, the early distribution of fertilizer\r\nby the Food Reserve Agency. As a result of those\r\nmeasures, Zambia produced a higher yield last season\r\nthan in the previous five years. My Government is\r\ndetermined to continue with that programme.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to note that,\r\nwhile major successes have been recorded in both the\r\nagricultural and social sectors, the HIV pandemic is\r\nexacerbating the situation. The disease attacks the most\r\nproductive members of society — those who are in the\r\nagricultural sector and are concerned with food\r\nproduction. This has resulted in millions of orphaned\r\nchildren, widows and elderly people living in abject\r\npoverty. It is the vulnerable members of our society\r\nwho need us to ensure that they have access to food,\r\nbasic health, water, sanitation and affordable generic\r\ndrugs to treat or prevent HIV/AIDS. Such attention will\r\ngo a long way towards reversing that human\r\ncatastrophe.\r\nI wish to appeal to the Secretary-General, through\r\nthe Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs, to increase support to Zambia and other\r\ncountries in the region in further enhancing food\r\nsecurity.\r\nI would like to commend the efforts of the United\r\nNations and the international community for assisting\r\nZambia at a time of humanitarian crisis. My country\r\nwill continue to look to them for support.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
