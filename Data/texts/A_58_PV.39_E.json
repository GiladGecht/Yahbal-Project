(Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 40 (continued)\r\nStrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian\r\nand disaster relief assistance of the United Nations,\r\nincluding special economic assistance\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/344)\r\n(a) Strengthening of the coordination of emergency\r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/58/89,\r\nA/58/434)\r\n(b) Special economic assistance to individual\r\ncountries or regions\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/58/133,\r\nA/58/224, A/58/225, A/58/273, A/58/280,\r\nA/58/285, A/58/286, A/58/358)\r\n(c) Strengthening of international cooperation and\r\ncoordination of efforts to study, mitigate and\r\nminimize the consequences of the Chernobyl\r\ndisaster\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/332)\r\n(d) Participation of volunteers, “White Helmets”,\r\nin the activities of the United Nations in the\r\nfield of humanitarian relief, rehabilitation and\r\ntechnical cooperation for development\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/320)\r\n(e) Assistance to the Palestinian people\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/88 and\r\nA/58/88/Corr.1)\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 49/2 of 19 October 1994, I now\r\ncall on the Observer of the International Federation of\r\nthe Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. I take it that\r\nthe meeting will allow the speaker to be heard in\r\nsilence.\r\nMr. Gospodinov (International Federation of Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): The International\r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\r\n(IFRC) and its worldwide network draw on the debate\r\nand the resolutions which flow from it as the basis of\r\nour work with Governments, international\r\norganizations, non-governmental organizations and all\r\nother actors. Needless to say, we listen to, coordinate\r\nand work with many United Nations partners,\r\nespecially the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs, the World Food Programme,\r\nUNICEF, the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) and other United Nations\r\npartners.\r\nI am very pleased to present to the Assembly\r\nseveral issues that are of particular relevance to our\r\nwork and, indeed, the work of Governments, United\r\nNations bodies and all other stakeholders.\r\nOn international coordination — as our President\r\nsaid during the high-level segment of the Economic\r\nand Social Council in July this year — we believe that\r\nour debate must promote a holistic approach to the\r\nissues now confronting the international community.\r\nHowever, our experience shows that instead of a\r\nproperly integrated approach to the programming,\r\ndelivery and distribution of humanitarian assistance,\r\nthere is often a patchwork of decisions based on\r\nconsiderations which have more to do with donor\r\npriorities than the needs of the vulnerable people.\r\nWe are pleased, however, that bodies such as the\r\nInter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), in which\r\nthe IFRC is a standing invitee, is addressing these\r\nissues and has shown a resolve to improve both\r\ncoordination and the collaborative approach to\r\nresponse. Next year, for example, the IASC is expected\r\nto give high priority to the development of guidelines\r\nfor humanitarian action in order to reduce vulnerability\r\nand protect livelihoods. The IFRC will play a\r\nsignificant part in that exercise, bringing to the table\r\nthe experience it can draw from its global network at\r\nboth the national and community levels.\r\nWith respect to linking relief to development, one\r\nof our key objectives in this debate is the acceptance by\r\nall States and other partners that emergency relief\r\noperations must be planned and undertaken with a\r\nlong-term perspective. Only then will it be possible to\r\nlink relief with development.\r\nFor many years, one of our key messages to the\r\nAssembly and other United Nations bodies has been\r\nthat too little has been done to address local capacity-\r\nbuilding in relief work. Through the IASC, we hope to\r\nbring more focused international attention to this area.\r\nThe arrival of Mr. Jan Egeland as Emergency Relief\r\nCoordinator and Under-Secretary-General for\r\nHumanitarian Affairs is an important element in this\r\nequation, and we look forward to working with him in\r\na strong and cooperative partnership.\r\nWe also appreciate the determination of\r\nMr. Egeland and his colleagues to focus — within\r\nIASC — more actively on natural disasters. The IFRC\r\nhas the lead, together with the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs, of an IASC\r\ntaskforce on preparedness and response to natural\r\ndisasters. The work is aimed at enhancing inter-agency\r\ncoordination and efficiency in the area of natural\r\ndisasters.\r\nThe development of this holistic approach\r\nthrough work in the IASC and other bodies parallels a\r\nnew and welcome understanding on the part of donors\r\nthat being a donor is not enough — there is an\r\noverriding requirement to be a good donor. That is why\r\nthe IFRC recently took part in the Good Donorship\r\nConference in Stockholm, hosted by the Government\r\nof Sweden. It is also why we strongly support work in\r\nthe IASC to set up its own inter-agency link with the\r\ngood donorship implementation group, created as an\r\noutcome of the Stockholm Conference. The IFRC sees\r\nmany parallels between this work and other work on\r\nhumanitarian financing and accountability and looks\r\nforward to contributing to the discussions, both as an\r\ninternational organization and as a body capable of\r\nprotecting the interests and concerns of beneficiaries.\r\nThis concern for beneficiaries is not, of course,\r\nnew for us. Our network, and its base of some\r\n95 million members and trained volunteers around the\r\nworld, is widely recognized for its front-line work\r\nduring disasters and health emergencies and in daily\r\nlife as the promoter of respect for humanitarian values.\r\nWe are continually strengthening our ability to put that\r\nexpertise to work so that it directly impacts on the way\r\nassistance is programmed, delivered and distributed.\r\nWe were therefore particularly pleased to be associated\r\nwith the launch early this year of Humanitarian\r\nAccountability Partnership International. HAPI, as it is\r\nincreasingly known, was the outcome of the\r\nHumanitarian Accountability Project hosted at the\r\nheadquarters of the IFRC in Geneva. Its basic objective\r\nis to strengthen accountability towards those affected\r\nby crisis situations and to facilitate improved\r\nperformance within the humanitarian sector.\r\nThe IFRC has also brought forward the concerns\r\nof beneficiaries in many other contexts over the years.\r\nThis year, for example, the World Disasters Report —\r\nthe world’s flagship publication on disasters issues,\r\npublished by the International Federation — focused\r\non ethics in aid. Among the key messages of the World\r\nDisaster Report this year is the inequity which often\r\naccompanies assistance programming because of the\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nbroad failure of some donors to act on the basis of\r\nsheer needs. That is one of the reasons why the IFRC\r\ndevotes so much of its attention to the issues of what\r\nare commonly known as forgotten disasters. We are\r\nvery pleased that Mr. Egeland is making forgotten\r\nemergencies a high priority and that he will be working\r\nwith the media to that end.\r\nIt is also vitally important to recall in this debate\r\nthat responding after the disaster has struck is not\r\nenough. Programmes, including at the national level in\r\ncountries prone to disasters, must incorporate disaster\r\nrisk reduction as a policy and programme highlight.\r\nThat has been our priority for decades, and it has\r\nachieved the support of States, as was shown in the\r\nplan of action adopted at the twenty-seventh\r\nInternational Conference of the Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent in 1999. But adopting plans of action is\r\nclearly not enough. There must be a willingness on the\r\npart of States to translate their commitments into\r\npolicies and programmes. The IFRC will be seeking to\r\nbuild that willingness at the forthcoming twenty-eighth\r\nInternational Conference, at which Governments and\r\nnational Red Cross and Red Crescent leaders will meet\r\ntogether in Geneva to decide on the Agenda for\r\nHumanitarian Action.\r\nIt is important to state here the three main\r\nfoundations of that agenda, for they show our\r\ndetermination to go forward with this theme over the\r\nlong term.\r\nThe first of those pillars endorses the concept and\r\nframework for international disaster response laws and\r\nfor implementing appropriate legal, policy and\r\noperational measures to facilitate and expedite\r\neffective responses to disasters. This pillar of the\r\nfoundation — international law relating to disaster\r\nresponse — relates very specifically to a contribution\r\nthe IFRC is making to the strengthening of\r\nhumanitarian coordination. Resolution 57/150, adopted\r\nafter the debate on this item in 2002, affirms the\r\nAssembly’s interest in the way this project is\r\ndeveloping, and my delegation plans to deliver a\r\nsubstantive report on the issue in time for consideration\r\nin 2004. It will be able to encompass the conclusions\r\nreached by States and national societies at the\r\nInternational Conference of the Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent in December this year. Without wishing to\r\nprejudge the outcome, I can say that, through\r\nconsultations with a very wide range of interested\r\nparties and stakeholders, we have learned that they\r\nwelcome the way the exercise is leading towards\r\nsignificant strengthening of coordination.\r\nThe President: In accordance with resolution\r\n48/265 of 24 August 1994, I now call on the Observer\r\nfor the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.\r\nMr. Linati-Bosch (Sovereign Military Order of\r\nMalta): Thank you very much, Mr. President, for\r\ngiving me the floor on behalf of the Sovereign Military\r\nOrder of Malta. I am also grateful to you for your good\r\nwork in directing the deliberations of this session.\r\nThe Sovereign Military Order of Malta has been\r\nclosely following the initiatives of the United Nations\r\naimed at providing emergency humanitarian assistance\r\nto countries affected by natural disasters and/or armed\r\nconflicts. The Order participates in activities aimed at\r\nalleviating the suffering of civilians in affected areas.\r\nWe especially share the anxiety of the United\r\nNations with regard to the protection of its personnel\r\nand strongly condemn the unprovoked attacks in\r\nBaghdad in August 2003. The improvement of security\r\nconditions for personnel must be among the highest\r\npriorities. Allow me to add that the Sovereign Military\r\nOrder of Malta is deeply concerned about the\r\nprotection of its own humanitarian personnel when it\r\nparticipates in United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations. Allow me, as a Permanent Observer, to\r\nobserve that adequate measures for the protection of all\r\nhumanitarian personnel could be included in the\r\nSecurity Council mandates.\r\nThe Order of Malta considers that, given its\r\nhumanitarian principles, its neutrality, its impartiality\r\nand its independence, it has the credentials to continue\r\nits activities and, to the extent possible, improve its\r\neffectiveness in humanitarian aid that covers refugees,\r\nreturnees and internally displaced persons.\r\nThere is no doubt that natural disasters cause\r\ngrave humanitarian crises and that a significant portion\r\nof humanitarian assistance activities have as their goal\r\nto provide immediate relief to the victims. We are not\r\ndenying that immediate help is imperative, but, as part\r\nof a more comprehensive position, we must include\r\nmitigation, prevention and reconstruction. In other\r\nwords, we must not limit assistance to the immediate\r\nconsequences of a catastrophic event.\r\nThe Order is convinced of this fact and has\r\ndemonstrated its long-term commitment in many\r\ndifferent contexts, from El Salvador to Iraq. In El\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nSalvador, the Order of Malta responded to the\r\ndevastating earthquakes of 2001 by providing water-\r\nsupply treatment plants and participating in the\r\nreconstruction work of the Departments of San Vicente,\r\nLa Paz and Cuscatlan. More recently, in Iraq, the Order\r\nhas been active in the northern towns of Erbil, Mosul,\r\nMakhmur and Kirkuk, by cooperating in programmes\r\nto rebuild social infrastructure.\r\nTo conclude, allow me to express the Sovereign\r\nMilitary Order of Malta’s satisfaction at the\r\nappointment of Mr. Jan Egeland as the new Emergency\r\nRelief Coordinator and to reiterate the Order’s\r\ncommitment to continue to respond to the challenges\r\nthat humanitarian work presents.\r\nThe President: In accordance with Assembly\r\nresolution 45/6 of 16 October 1990, I now call on the\r\nObserver for the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross.\r\nMr. Villettaz (International Committee of the\r\nRed Cross): The International Committee of the Red\r\nCross (ICRC) wishes to thank you, Mr. President, for\r\ngiving it the opportunity to speak on the subject of\r\nhumanitarian coordination, which it considers of vital\r\nimportance in the conduct of humanitarian operations\r\nin complex situations.\r\nThe ICRC cannot but begin by noting, with\r\nextreme sadness and equal concern, that the current\r\nyear has been profoundly tragic for the international\r\ncommunity. While it was still grieving the deaths of\r\nthree of its own personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq, the\r\nICRC was appalled by the brutal attack perpetrated on\r\nthe United Nations headquarters in Baghdad on 19\r\nAugust. The ICRC strongly condemned this act of\r\nterror that targets civilians and wishes to reiterate here\r\nits heartfelt sympathy to the victims and their families\r\nand colleagues.\r\nThe complexity prevalent in most humanitarian\r\ncrises, together with the sheer dimensions of the human\r\nsuffering resulting from the numerous ongoing\r\nconflicts in the world, represent challenges that go far\r\nbeyond the capacity of any single humanitarian\r\norganization. In this regard, the ICRC is deeply\r\ndistressed to observe the heavy toll that continues to be\r\npaid by civilians, especially by the most vulnerable\r\namong them, including women and children.\r\nDisease and starvation, displacement and\r\nseparation, continue to wreck havoc on families and\r\ncommunities. In an attempt to address these vast needs,\r\nan increasing number of humanitarian actors, with\r\ndifferent mandates, areas of expertise and resources are\r\npresent in humanitarian crises. Consequently, it is only\r\nnatural that coordination has come to form an intrinsic\r\npart of humanitarian efforts, in order for such efforts to\r\ngain in overall effectiveness.\r\nFor the ICRC, the central aim of humanitarian\r\ncoordination consists in seeking the greatest possible\r\ncomplementarity among all actors, flowing from their\r\nrespective mandates, expertise and operating principles\r\nand procedures. Towards that end, the ICRC\r\nparticipates in coordination efforts through regular\r\ndialogue and mutual consultation, both at headquarters\r\nand in the field, on thematic issues and on operational\r\nquestions. As a standing invitee of the Inter-Agency\r\nStanding Committee (IASC), the ICRC, together with\r\nthe International Federation of Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent Societies, participates in various coordination\r\nmechanisms and structures put in place by the IASC\r\nitself and by the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA), sharing experiences\r\nand information and thereby contributing to the\r\ncommon goal of rendering humanitarian action more\r\neffective.\r\nAnother example, at the bilateral level, would be\r\nfruitful exchanges with the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\r\nwithin the framework of the UNHCR 2004 process and\r\nthe Agenda for Protection. In parallel, the ICRC\r\nparticipated actively in the preparation of the internally\r\ndisplaced persons (IDP) response matrix by OCHA’s\r\nIDP unit. It also held a senior level meeting with the\r\nWorld Food Programme to actively explore\r\npossibilities of strengthening cooperation between the\r\ntwo organizations with regard to food assistance.\r\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross\r\nseizes this opportunity to thank Mr. Oshima for the\r\ncooperation extended to our institution and to express\r\nits best wishes to Mr. Egeland in the execution of his\r\ndifficult and complex task.\r\nWhile on the subject of humanitarian\r\ncoordination, the ICRC wishes to stress its firm\r\nconviction that, in order to both ensure the security of\r\nhumanitarian personnel and indeed render possible\r\nhumanitarian operations for all victims of a conflict,\r\npolitical and military action ought to be kept\r\nimperatively distinct from humanitarian action. Were\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nthe perceptions of humanitarian action as strictly\r\nneutral and independent to be altered by a blurring of\r\nthe distinction between such action and political\r\ninitiatives or military operations, the consequence\r\nwould inevitably be greatly impeded access to victims\r\nand high security risks for humanitarian workers. In\r\nthis perspective, coordination also signifies concerted\r\nefforts by all concerned to safeguard this vital\r\nhumanitarian space and thereby protect humanitarian\r\nworkers and victims alike.\r\nIn conclusion, the ICRC wishes to reaffirm its\r\ncommitment to the spirit and practice of humanitarian\r\ncoordination. The ICRC remains equally determined to\r\nfulfil the international mandate conferred on it by the\r\nGeneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols in\r\nrelation to the protection and assistance of all victims\r\nof armed conflict.\r\nThe President: In accordance with the decision\r\ntaken by the General Assembly at its thirty-second\r\nplenary meeting on 15 October 2003, I now call on the\r\nObserver of the Holy See.\r\nArchbishop Migliore (Holy See): On behalf of\r\nmy delegation, I wish to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor the useful reports prepared under this item. My\r\ndelegation also wishes to convey its appreciation to the\r\nUnited Nations for its commendable initiatives\r\nundertaken to reduce the impact of natural hazards on\r\nhuman society, through a coordination of efforts by the\r\ninternational community, with particular attention to\r\ndeveloping countries. The rigors of natural phenomena\r\ncannot be prevented, but their impact can be reduced\r\nand even avoided when capacities of vulnerable\r\ncountries are strengthened and enhanced. In this\r\nregard, my delegation acknowledges the importance of\r\nstrengthening the coordination of the United Nations\r\nemergency humanitarian assistance, so vital if relief\r\nassistance is to transcend the emergency phase and pass\r\ninto long-term development strategy.\r\nThe world has advanced to such a degree that it is\r\noften possible to foresee natural disasters, thereby\r\nhelping reduce harm to people and damage to property.\r\nStrengthened by transparent and accountable systems,\r\nthe international community can now accomplish much\r\nin relief and long-term reconstruction. For this reason,\r\nmy delegation supports the efforts of the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs, it welcomes the\r\ncomprehensive approach of the Consolidated Appeals\r\nProcess, the participation of the United Nations funds\r\nand agencies, the preventive approach of the\r\nInternational Strategy for Disaster Reduction, the lead\r\nof the Economic and Social Council humanitarian\r\nsegment and the valiant United Nations and other\r\nhumanitarian personnel.\r\nNeedless to say, the scale of emergencies\r\nworldwide makes the task of offering effective and\r\nprompt assistance seem overwhelming. Our initiatives,\r\nprojects and efforts may never be enough. Emergencies\r\nare so numerous, intense and varied that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has quite fittingly noted that because of the\r\nseverity and suddenness of these overwhelming\r\nemergencies, others are reduced to forgotten or “silent”\r\nones. This situation worsens when assistance is\r\ncoloured by partiality and incoherent policies, not to\r\nmention when crises are ignored or even put aside\r\nbecause of misrule and misguided politics.\r\nThe vastness of the problem and the countless\r\nnumbers of children and individuals in urgent need of\r\nhelp should not paralyse us in inaction. The sad fact\r\nthat the contributions from donor countries and\r\nagencies are often insufficient to meet many worldwide\r\nneeds should not lead us to hopelessness. Rather, these\r\ncontributions should be praised and encouraged.\r\nSimple gestures of giving, oftentimes combined with\r\nrapidity of response and coordination, will make a\r\ndifference and bear fruit.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to mention that the Holy\r\nSee has taken an active role in this regard. More than\r\n30 years ago, it established the Pontifical Council Cor\r\nUnum to harmonize and encourage the activities of\r\nchurch organizations, associations, non-governmental\r\norganizations and other groups involved in the field of\r\nsocial and charitable assistance to people in countries\r\nhit by natural disasters and wars. In particular, the\r\nPontifical Council has been engaged in intensifying its\r\nhumanitarian action for victims of almost all types of\r\nnatural disasters, especially in developing countries.\r\nMoreover, within its means, it has contributed in\r\nconcrete ways to assisting people in moments of\r\ndisaster.\r\nBesides the Pontifical Council, the Catholic\r\nChurch in particular countries has organized its relief\r\nefforts through agencies such as Caritas Internationalis\r\nand Catholic Relief Services. These organizations\r\ngenerously commit themselves to humanitarian work in\r\nthe area of natural disaster reduction and rehabilitation.\r\nThe commitment of Church organizations and\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nassociations has become increasingly essential and\r\nimportant in contributing to the development and\r\nreconstruction of various societies.\r\nIn general, there is a clear and determined\r\nawareness that it is possible to prevent and reduce the\r\nimpact of natural disasters. However, numerous\r\ndisasters continue to strike peoples in different parts of\r\nthe world, while chronic emergencies resulting from\r\narmed conflicts, extreme poverty and ethnic clashes\r\nhave given rise to an enormous displacement of\r\npeoples throughout the world.\r\nThe international community should not let these\r\nvictims of tragic events and conflicts succumb to the\r\nagony they have been enduring in the aftermath of such\r\nnatural and manmade disasters. It is necessary to have\r\nthe will, converted into concerted action, to intensify\r\nassistance for peoples still struggling in the battle for\r\nexistence and survival. For this assistance to be\r\neffective, it must have the support of the entire family\r\nof nations.\r\nMy delegation therefore wishes to encourage the\r\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs and other humanitarian agencies\r\nto continue their laudable efforts in responding\r\npromptly and effectively to the plight of all victims of\r\ndisasters and emergencies throughout the world.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on agenda item 40 and sub-items (a) to (e).\r\nOne representative and one observer have\r\nrequested to exercise the right of reply. May I remind\r\nmembers that statements in the exercise of the right of\r\nreply are limited to ten minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second\r\nintervention, and should be made by delegations from\r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Margarian (Armenia): I would like to\r\nrespond to the statement made by the Azerbaijani\r\ndelegation, in which several references to my country\r\nwere made.\r\nThe use of the problem of refugees as a\r\npropaganda tool is best illustrated by the fact that\r\nAzerbaijan continues to speak about 1 million refugees\r\nduring the current session of the General Assembly. In\r\nthat regard, may I draw the Assembly’s attention to the\r\nreport of the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees contained in document\r\nA/57/12. It is clearly indicated, on page 41 of the\r\nEnglish version of that report, that the total number of\r\nthe Azeri population of concern to the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR) is 587,310. It is apparently not so easy to\r\ngive up such as impressive number as 1 million, but it\r\nis time for the delegation of Azerbaijan to realize that it\r\ncannot mislead the international community endlessly\r\nwith false, propagandistic numbers.\r\nOne can only wonder how it is possible that a\r\ncountry so rich in oil and with foreign investment\r\ntotalling in the billions of dollars has for so many years\r\nnot been able to resolve the social and humanitarian\r\nproblems of refugees and internally displaced persons\r\n(IDP) or at least to ease the poor conditions in which\r\nthose people live. It is apparent that the Government of\r\nAzerbaijan is indeed not interested in resolving the\r\nissue of refugees. Had that been the case, a solution\r\nwould have been found long ago. It is at least\r\nhypocritical that the Government of Azerbaijan has\r\nchosen to exploit the suffering of its own people as a\r\npropaganda tool, making a show of keeping those\r\npeople in tent camps near Baku for years and making\r\nthem the tragic subjects of its propagandistic campaign.\r\nWe are dealing here with just another\r\nmanifestation of unsophisticated warfare against\r\nArmenia and its population. Unfortunately, Armenia\r\nwas the first country in Eastern Europe to face an\r\ninflow of refugees after the pogroms and massacres\r\nagainst the Armenian population in Azerbaijan that\r\ntook place from 1988 to 1990 and forced a community\r\nof half a million Armenians to flee that country,\r\nleaving behind their houses, apartments and properties.\r\nThose people were sheltered in Armenia, which was\r\nitself severely devastated by the earthquake of 1988\r\nthat affected one third of the country and left half a\r\nmillion people homeless and internally displaced.\r\nMeanwhile, in the same period of time, the authorities\r\nof Armenia provided the Azeri population of Armenia\r\nwith all the necessary conditions to receive\r\ncompensation for the property they left in Armenia,\r\nwithdraw their deposits from banks and leave for\r\nAzerbaijan in safety and security.\r\nRegardless of the numbers and nationalities of\r\nrefugees and IDPs, the fact of their existence alone\r\nshould be a matter of great concern for all of us. That is\r\nthe reason that my Government, instead of speculating\r\nabout the tragic destiny of that people, developed and\r\nis successfully implementing a comprehensive\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nrehabilitation programme for refugees and IDPs. We\r\nare doing our best to integrate them into our society.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to note that\r\nArmenia, whose border areas have also suffered owing\r\nto the conflict in the region, has somehow remained\r\nexcluded from the rehabilitation programmes carried\r\nout by United Nations agencies, despite the fact that\r\nsimilar programmes have been under way for several\r\nyears in the neighbouring country.\r\nWe hope that, after concluding its presidential\r\nelections, Azerbaijan will put an end to its unchanged\r\nrhetoric and try instead to engage in constructive\r\ndialogue to find a peaceful solution to the Nagorno-\r\nKarabakh conflict.\r\nMrs. Barghouti (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nThe least we can say about the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Israel with regard to this item during\r\nthis morning’s meeting is that it was full of mistakes\r\nand distortions of fact and replete with flagrant lies.\r\nBecause of the limited time allotted, we shall not go\r\ninto detail concerning that statement.\r\nHowever, according to the claims of the\r\nrepresentative of Israel, the cause of the Palestinian\r\ncrisis is terrorism and corruption on the part of\r\nPalestinians. The fact is that the main cause for the\r\ndeterioration of the situation in occupied Palestine, the\r\nsuffering of the Palestinian people and the strangling\r\neconomic crisis afflicting our people is the\r\ncontinuation of the ugly occupation of our land and\r\nIsrael’s, the occupying Power, escalation of its bloody\r\nexpansionist racist campaign against our people,\r\ninstitutions and elected leaders.\r\nI would merely like to indicate that the occupying\r\nPower yesterday arbitrarily bombed the Gaza Strip,\r\nleading to the killing of 11 Palestinian civilians,\r\nincluding two children, and the wounding of scores of\r\nPalestinians and the destruction of many houses. That\r\ncriminal act is yet another in a series of war crimes by\r\nIsrael’s occupying forces, crimes akin to crimes against\r\nhumanity. That criminal act has even led to objections\r\nby some Israeli Government officials because of its\r\nhorrendous nature. Israel covers up such crimes by\r\nsaying that they are simply security measures. Now\r\nthey are saying that they are steps taken against\r\nterrorism.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation would like to\r\nreaffirm what we stated yesterday during the resumed\r\ntenth emergency special session of the General\r\nAssembly. The Palestinian leadership has a crystal\r\nclear position of principle in that respect. Let it be clear\r\nthat it is Israel’s policies and actions that have led to\r\nsuicide bombings, and not the other way around. That\r\ndeplored phenomenon has emerged 27 years after the\r\noccupation and after our people have lost hope in a\r\nbetter future. Israel is responsible for ruining the lives\r\nof three generations of Palestinians, as well as for\r\ntearing the fabric of our society and for the morbid\r\nphenomena that have afflicted our society, including\r\nsuicide bombings. Israel must understand that there\r\nwill be no security solution to that phenomenon under\r\nany circumstances. While all parties must act to end the\r\nphenomenon, we should not allow Israel, the\r\noccupying Power, to exploit the war against\r\ninternational terrorism or its civilian victims in order to\r\nprovide cover for its illegal policies and practices of\r\ncontinued occupation, settler colonialism,\r\nexpansionism and rejection of peace.\r\nWith regard to Israel’s assertions of corruption, I\r\nwould simply like to say that financial matters are\r\npurely internal Palestinian matters. Before talking\r\nabout corruption, Israel should return to Palestinians\r\nthe money it took from them. That money belongs to\r\nthe Palestinian Authority, not to Israel. Palestine’s\r\nMinister for Finance is commended by the international\r\ncommunity for his integrity and honour. We cannot\r\nallow Israel, which is the source of corruption and a\r\nfundamental reason for Palestine’s economic\r\ndeterioration, to make allegations about corruption.\r\nThe President: May I again remind members that\r\nstatements in exercise of the right of reply are limited\r\nto 10 minutes for the first intervention and to five\r\nminutes for the second intervention and should be\r\nmade by representatives from their seats.\r\nMr. Israfilov (Azerbaijan): It had not been our\r\nintention to take the floor, but the groundless claims\r\nmade by the Armenian representative have forced us to\r\nexercise our right of reply.\r\nWe regret — although we had somewhat\r\nexpected — the inadequate reaction of Armenia to our\r\nstatement on the agenda item under discussion.\r\nAnother attempt on the part of Armenia to dissociate\r\nitself from its immoral and vicious deeds has failed.\r\nThe Armenian representative has failed once again to\r\nmake even one substantiated argument in his remarks,\r\nwhich comes as no surprise, at least to us.\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nWe have no intention of engaging in a useless,\r\nirrelevant and counterproductive exchange with the\r\nArmenian representative, but we would nevertheless\r\nlike to draw the attention of delegations to the\r\nfollowing facts, with respect to whose substance the\r\nrepresentative of Armenia could hardly accuse\r\nAzerbaijan of engaging in speculation.\r\nArmenia is an aggressor State. It has violated the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and continues to undermine the\r\nfundamental norms and principles of international law,\r\nwhich constitute the basis of the whole system of\r\ninternational relations.\r\nArmenia has violated the territorial integrity and\r\nsovereignty of another State Member of the United\r\nNations, the Republic of Azerbaijan, and continues to\r\noccupy almost one-fifth of the territory of that State.\r\nArmenia continues blatantly to ignore the will of\r\nthe international community and that of the Security\r\nCouncil, which, in its resolutions 822 (1993), 853\r\n(1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993), demanded the\r\nunconditional, immediate and complete withdrawal of\r\nArmenian occupying forces from the occupied\r\nterritories of Azerbaijan. Ten years have passed since\r\nthen, and the aggressor, enjoying an environment of\r\nimpunity, continues with that unlawful and ugly\r\npractice and continues to occupy Nagorny Karabakh\r\nand several other regions of Azerbaijan.\r\nArmenia continues its almost-10-year blockade of\r\nAzerbaijan’s Autonomous Republic of Nakhchivan,\r\nthereby causing enormous suffering to the civilian\r\npopulation of that part of Azerbaijan. It is also\r\nmisleading the world with its mythical claims\r\nregarding the blockade.\r\nArmenia is responsible, and should be brought to\r\njustice, for the ethnic cleansing it has committed in all\r\nthe Azerbaijani-populated areas within its territory,\r\naccompanied by indiscriminate pogroms and the killing\r\nof hundreds of innocent women and children.\r\nArmenia, as a result of its criminal policy, has\r\norchestrated and carried out the eviction of almost 1\r\nmillion Azerbaijanis from Armenia and from the\r\noccupied Azerbaijani territories inside and outside of\r\nthe Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.\r\nIt is my intention once again to draw the attention\r\nof the United Nations and the international community\r\nto the dire fate of the innocent civilian population\r\naffected, which was the subject of Azerbaijan’s\r\nintervention today.\r\nArmenia has erased all traces of any Azerbaijani\r\npresence in the occupied territories and continues its\r\npractice of destruction and desecration of cultural and\r\nreligious monuments in those territories. It continues\r\nalso with the illegal resettlement of citizens of Armenia\r\nand other States on the occupied territories of\r\nAzerbaijan.\r\nArmenia, having committed all those crimes,\r\ncontinues to find it appropriate to justify its repugnant\r\npolicies and to mislead the Assembly. The only way\r\nArmenia can be saved from ostracism is for it to get\r\nback on the track of normal civilized behaviour; to\r\nrespect — at last — international law, including the\r\nUnited Nations Charter; and to start to behave as a\r\nresponsible member of the family of nations.\r\nMr. Shacham (Israel): I asked to take the floor in\r\nexercise of the right of reply in order to set the record\r\nstraight with regard to the current counter-terrorist\r\noperations being carried out by Israel in Gaza in\r\nexercise of the basic right of all States to self-defence.\r\nSince the beginning of this month, over two\r\ndozen Kassam artillery rockets have been fired by\r\nPalestinian terrorists at cities in sovereign Israeli\r\nterritory — 10 such rockets in the past 48 hours. Since\r\nthe Palestinian Authority is doing nothing to curtail\r\nthese flagrant acts of terrorism in its own midst, Israel\r\nwas forced to take action to stop those attacks.\r\nIsrael’s response was measured, focused on\r\nlegitimate terrorist targets and carried out in such a\r\nway as to minimize as much as possible any harm to\r\nthe civilian population, which the Palestinian terrorists\r\nhave exploited as shields for their extensive terrorist\r\ninfrastructure. Israel struck with precision munitions\r\nagainst the following legitimate terrorist targets.\r\nIts first target was a clandestine Hamas arms\r\nfactory in Sajaiyeh, in which explosive charges and\r\narms were manufactured. That target had to be attacked\r\ntwice due to the number of weapons found in the\r\nfactory.\r\nIts second target was a warehouse on the outskirts\r\nof Gaza in which weapons and explosives belonging to\r\nHamas were stockpiled. The secondary explosions\r\nfollowing the attack indicated that the warehouse was\r\nfilled with ammunition.\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nIts third target was a pick-up truck transporting\r\ntwo terrorists — Khaled al-Masri and Iyad al-Hilu of\r\nHamas, who were responsible for the infrastructure\r\nmanufacturing the Kassam rockets, along with mortar\r\nshells and explosives used in terrorist attacks.\r\nFinally, it targeted a vehicle travelling near\r\nNuseirat carrying a terrorist cell that was fleeing from\r\nan intercepted attempt to infiltrate Israel near Kibbutz\r\nNahal Oz and to carry out a spectacular terrorist attack.\r\nThe strikes against those targets were carried out, as I\r\nstated previously, with precision munitions. Military\r\nsurveillance footage just released shows that no\r\ncivilians were visible in the target area at the time of\r\nthose operations. The footage shows that at least eight\r\nterrorists were killed in those pinpoint operations,\r\nwhile no civilian casualties were apparent.\r\nThe aim of those operations was simple: to impair\r\nHamas’ capability to carry out acts of terrorism. Let\r\nthere be no doubt: Israel deeply regrets the inadvertent\r\nloss of innocent life during its counter-terrorist efforts.\r\nHowever, as long as the terrorists choose purposely to\r\nposition themselves and their infrastructure in the\r\nmidst of the civilian population, shielding themselves\r\nbehind civilians, and as long as the Palestinian\r\nleadership does nothing to prevent the terrorists from\r\ndoing so, it must bear sole responsibility for these\r\nunfortunate civilian casualties.\r\nI would remind the Assembly that all of these\r\nterrorist targets are located in the Gaza Strip, an area in\r\nwhich the Palestinian Authority has full security\r\ncontrol. There is no excuse for the Palestinian\r\nAuthority’s complacency regarding and complicity\r\nwith these terrorists. These terror groups should have\r\nbeen dismantled long ago by the Palestinian Authority\r\nin accordance with international law and with the\r\ncommitments that the Palestinian leadership repeatedly\r\ntook upon itself, from the Declaration of Principles in\r\n1993 to this year’s road map.\r\nHaving no alternative, Israel must do what the\r\nPalestinian Authority is obligated, but refuses, to do:\r\nfight Palestinian terrorism. Israel must protect the lives\r\nof its citizens.\r\nMr. Margarian (Armenia): I ask for your\r\nindulgence, Mr. President, in taking the floor a second\r\ntime.\r\nThe representative of Azerbaijan made many\r\nabsurd allegations, but I will limit my second response\r\nto two major issues. First, his reference to so-called\r\naggression by the Republic of Armenia against his\r\ncountry was, again, totally misleading. We have\r\nrepeatedly stated — and this is well known — that the\r\nsituation to which he referred was a forced reaction to\r\nAzerbaijan’s own decision to use military force to\r\nsuppress the legitimate and just quest of the people of\r\nNagorny Karabakh to peacefully exercise their right to\r\nself-determination, which is guaranteed by\r\ninternational law and the United Nations Charter.\r\nAzerbaijan’s claims of territorial integrity are also\r\nhistorically, legally and politically deficient, since\r\nNagorny Karabakh has never been a part of Azerbaijan,\r\nexcept during the era of the Soviet Union, when it was\r\nwithin its administrative borders. Consequently, during\r\nthe break-up of the Soviet Union the people of\r\nNagorny Karabakh exercised their right of self-\r\ndetermination, peacefully and in accordance with\r\nSoviet and international law. Those facts are well-\r\nknown and have been documented, so I would suggest\r\nthat my Azerbaijani colleague once again review his\r\nfacts. The people of Nagorny Karabakh have the\r\nlegitimate credentials to pursue a just solution to the\r\nconflict. Armenia is determined in its endeavours to\r\ntake every measure to ensure a peaceful negotiated\r\noutcome, which would ensure the right of the Karabakh\r\npeople to live freely and securely in their homeland.\r\nMr. Israfilov (Azerbaijan): I would like briefly to\r\nsummarize my earlier intervention. First, Armenia is to\r\nblame for the emergency humanitarian situation in\r\nAzerbaijan. It is because of Armenia’s aggression and\r\npolicy of ethnic cleansing that hundreds of thousands\r\nof innocent civilians were brutally evicted from their\r\nhomes. Secondly, Armenia has grossly violated the\r\nCharter and international law. It has violated the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of a sovereign\r\nMember State, Azerbaijan, and should therefore be\r\nbrought to justice. The international community should\r\nput an end to impunity for the aggressor, as well as to\r\nthe policy of double standards and a selective\r\napproach.\r\nI could, of course, go on with this list, but I\r\nbelieve that those comments are sufficient for now. My\r\nadvice to Armenia would be that, instead of giving\r\ncynical advice and counting the money and oil\r\nresources of others, instead of wasting the time and\r\nresources of this body in exercise of the right of reply,\r\nit would be better off practising common sense and\r\ndecency and respecting the norms and principles of\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\ninternational law and the rules of this house, and get\r\nout of the occupied Azerbaijani territories.\r\nMrs. Barghouti (Palestine): It is highly\r\nregrettable that, regardless of the issue under\r\ndiscussion in the Assembly — in this case\r\nhumanitarian assistance — the Israeli representative is\r\nable to present us only with a standard-issue statement.\r\nHe delivers it “anywhere, any time”, always on\r\nterrorism, which is highly questionable and very\r\ninsulting to the General Assembly.\r\nMoreover, we regret that the Israeli representative\r\nforgot to mention that nearly 100 Palestinian civilians,\r\nincluding children, were wounded in the Israeli attacks\r\nagainst Gaza yesterday, which killed 12 civilians,\r\nincluding a doctor who rushed to assist the victims.\r\nThose are the facts.\r\nMr. Shacham (Israel): In my first reply I\r\naddressed the issues raised in the Palestinian\r\nObserver’s reply. However, since the Palestinian\r\nObserver has, in replying, provided me with the\r\nopportunity to address the Assembly for five more\r\nminutes, I would like to refer to the issue of suicide\r\nbombers, which the Palestinian Observer brought up in\r\nher first reply.\r\nThe morally abhorrent and patently false claim\r\nthat suicide terrorism is caused by Israel must be\r\nrejected out of hand. Less than 2 weeks ago, 21 Israelis\r\nwere killed by a female Palestinian suicide terrorist.\r\nHanadi Jaradat, a 29-year-old lawyer from Jenin, who\r\ncarried out the attack, was the sixth such female suicide\r\nbomber in the past two years. Several other female\r\nbombers have been apprehended when about to blow\r\nthemselves up, including one who was hiding a bomb\r\nunder a maternity dress and another who was only 15\r\nyears old.\r\nWhile the media has expressed surprise at\r\nPalestinian women acting as suicide bombers, it should\r\nsurprise no one who has followed developments in the\r\nPalestinian Authority. Yasser Arafat’s Palestinian\r\nAuthority — not Israel — has regularly targeted\r\nwomen in its promotion and glorification of suicide\r\nterrorism. Immediately after the first bombing by a\r\nwoman — Wafa Idris — on 27 January 2002, the\r\nPalestinian Authority undertook a very public\r\ncampaign to indoctrinate Palestinian women to see\r\nthemselves as potential suicide bombers. After the\r\nbombing, the Palestinian Authority immediately\r\ndepicted her as a heroine and her murders as acts to be\r\nemulated. Within days, the Palestinian Authority held a\r\ndemonstration in her honour, with young girls carrying\r\nposters with Idris’ pictures and the words, “The Fatah\r\nmovement” — that is, Arafat’s movement —\r\n“eulogizes with great pride the heroic martyr Wafa\r\nIdris”.\r\nThe Palestinian Authority, seeing that women\r\ncould more easily get past Israeli security, immediately\r\ncreated an operational framework for terrorist activity\r\nby women. The Palestinian Authority named this new\r\nbrigade in honour of Wafa Idris. All of that promotion\r\nled to a string of unsuccessful suicide bombing\r\nattempts by women and, eventually, to a bombing in a\r\nJerusalem supermarket on 29 March 2002 by Ayat al-\r\nAkhras, a 17-year-old girl, who killed two Israeli\r\ncivilians and injured about two dozen others. The\r\nPalestinian Authority — not Israel — then turned those\r\ntwo successful killers into symbols for Palestinian\r\ngirls. Palestinian Authority girls’ summer camps, for\r\nexample, were named after Idris and Akhras, both last\r\nyear and this year.\r\nSadly, this campaign to turn female suicide\r\nbombers into role models is succeeding. In an\r\ninterview on Palestinian Authority television after the\r\nfirst two suicide bombings by women, young\r\nPalestinian girls discussed their feelings about suicide\r\nterrorism. Typical of the statements was one made by a\r\ngirl name Sabrine, who stated, “Of course I support\r\nblowing up. It is our right. Maybe no one will\r\nsympathize with us when they hear that children blow\r\nthemselves up, but that is called heroism”.\r\nWomen whose social standing is problematic,\r\nincluding women who have acquired a so-called bad\r\nreputation due to assumed promiscuity or extra-marital\r\nrelationships, have often been convinced to take part in\r\nsuicide operations as a means of rehabilitating their\r\nnames. The strength of this type of persuasion can best\r\nbe understood in the relevant cultural framework: a\r\nsociety in which women are often considered to\r\nembody the honour of the family. Any hint of\r\nimpropriety, no matter how minor, can have serious\r\nconsequences for the women involved, even prompting\r\nmale family members to murder her in so-called\r\nhonour killings.\r\nSo, in steps Yasser Arafat and his Fatah Tanzim\r\nterrorist group. They recently embarked on a campaign\r\nto recruit as suicide terrorists those young women who\r\nfind themselves in acute emotional distress due to such\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nsocial stigmatization. This method of coercion is\r\ncharacterized by the seduction of young women into\r\nillicit relationships or, failing that, the arrangement of\r\ntheir rape. Subsequently, overwhelming emotional\r\npressure is brought to bear on the women in order to\r\nconvince them to end their lives in an admirable\r\nmanner, since public revelation of their impropriety\r\nwill constitute an intolerable disgrace to the honour of\r\ntheir families.\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has thus\r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item\r\n40, sub-items (a) to (e). I would like to remind\r\nMembers that sub-item (f), entitled “Emergency\r\ninternational assistance for peace, normalcy and\r\nreconstruction of war-stricken Afghanistan”, will be\r\nconsidered together with agenda item 28, “The\r\nsituation in Afghanistan and its implications for\r\ninternational peace and security”, on Friday, 5\r\nDecember 2003.\r\nAgenda item 41\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the special session\r\non children\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General (A/58/333)\r\nMr. Balarezo (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I have\r\nthe honour to address the General Assembly on behalf\r\nof the countries of the Rio Group: Argentina, Bolivia,\r\nBrazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican\r\nRepublic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,\r\nMexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Uruguay,\r\nVenezuela and my country, Peru.\r\nThe important role of the Rio Group during the\r\nprocess that concluded with the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on children in May 2002 was the\r\nresult of commitments assumed by our countries long\r\nbefore the beginning of the special session, with the\r\nratification of the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild. That Convention constitutes the basis of our\r\nwork in favour of our children and adolescents, with a\r\nfocus on human rights. The task of our Governments\r\nbenefited from the valuable participation of\r\nrepresentatives of civil society, in particular non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and other actors involved\r\nin promoting and protecting the rights of children and\r\nadolescents. That has enabled us to take action aimed\r\nat achieving sustainable human development, focused\r\non the best interests of the child and grounded in the\r\nprinciples of democracy, equality and non-\r\ndiscrimination, among other things.\r\nAt the international level, the special session on\r\nchildren, among other factors, has strengthened our\r\ncapacities and has motivated our nations to continue to\r\ndevelop processes and to implement action for change\r\nto benefit children and adolescents, based on a shared\r\nregional vision.\r\nThe special session enabled the international\r\ncommunity to renew its political commitment to\r\nchildren and adolescents. It also established a group of\r\npriorities through the adoption of the Plan of Action,\r\nwhich contained commitments for the twenty-first\r\ncentury. Through that document, the product of the\r\nspecial session, we established four priorities: to\r\npromote healthy lives, to provide quality education to\r\nall children, to protect children from abuse,\r\nexploitation and violence, and to combat HIV/AIDS.\r\nAchieving those goals, as well as the\r\ncommitments undertaken in 1990 and the initiatives of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration, Agenda 21, the Monterrey\r\nConference and the Johannesburg Summit, requires\r\ncoordinated action by all involved national and\r\ninternational actors.\r\nAt the regional level, the Rio Group believes that\r\nthe well-being of children and adolescents should be\r\nconsidered a main objective of the development\r\nprocess. That was declared at the seventeenth Summit\r\nof the Rio Group, held in Cusco, Peru in May 2002.\r\nThe outcome of that Summit was the Cusco Consensus,\r\nin which we established a strategic agenda for action,\r\ngiving high priority to the effective reduction of\r\npoverty and the fight against malnutrition and hunger;\r\nthat work that must begin with children. In that regard,\r\nthe Rio Group renewed its commitment to promoting\r\nthe fulfilment of the goals agreed at the special session\r\nof the General Assembly in 2002. The Rio Group has\r\nthe political will at the highest level of member\r\nGovernments to promote and protect the rights of\r\nchildren and adolescents, taking into consideration\r\ntheir specific needs according to their age, including\r\nthe right to sexual and reproductive health and the\r\nresponsibilities of both male and female adolescents.\r\nIn that regard, the countries of the Rio Group\r\nhave made great efforts to achieve one of the goals set\r\nout in the document entitled “A world fit for children”,\r\nreferring to the development and strengthening of\r\nnational and regional plans. It should be pointed out\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nthat many of our countries have now prepared national\r\nplans based on social investment in children and\r\nadolescents. Some of those plans are now at the\r\nimplementation stage, and we recognize the valuable\r\nsupport of UNICEF in this undertaking.\r\nIn that connection, it should be underlined that\r\nsuch social investment is often seriously hindered by\r\nthe difficult economic situation prevailing in our\r\nregion. This has had a negative impact on various\r\nsocial groups, in particular on vulnerable social groups\r\nsuch as children and adolescents, affecting the\r\nprovision of services such as health and education.\r\nThis situation has hindered the fulfilment of our\r\nobjectives, such as the goal of using a minimum of 20\r\nper cent of national budget resources for basic social\r\nservices. Nevertheless, most of our countries have been\r\nable to reduce the infant mortality rate and the\r\nmortality rate of children under 5 years of age to\r\neradicate some preventable diseases, to increase\r\nprimary school enrolment and graduation rates and to\r\nreduce illiteracy.\r\nThe countries of the Rio Group are proud to have\r\nmulticultural and multi-ethnic populations. For that\r\nreason, we attach special importance to investing in\r\nchildren and adolescents, in particular in areas of\r\nmarginalized or minority populations, such as\r\nindigenous populations and those of African descent.\r\nIn that regard, we are coordinating action to combat\r\ndiscrimination and high rates of poverty and social\r\nexclusion. At the same time, we reaffirm the need to\r\nimplement public policies that include ethnicity and\r\nother dimensions such as gender, age and poverty.\r\nI cannot conclude without referring to the\r\ndifficult situation of children in armed conflict. As the\r\nSecretary-General states in his report (A/58/333), the\r\nfight to ensure the protection of the rights and well-\r\nbeing of the children exposed to armed conflicts has\r\nreached a decisive moment. Several normative\r\ninstruments and commitments exist; but it is now\r\nnecessary to take coordinated steps to fully implement\r\nthem, with a view to establishing an effective regime of\r\nprotection for children affected by war. In that regard,\r\nwe support the Secretary-General’s initiative to\r\nestablish an integrated surveillance and information\r\nnetwork to provide objective, periodic and accurate\r\nreports of violations against children.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to renew the\r\ncommitment of our Governments to continue to work\r\non behalf of children and adolescents, as they are the\r\nmost important human and social asset for which we\r\nhave a present and future responsibility.\r\nMr. Mantovani (Italy): I have the honour to take\r\nthe floor on behalf of the European Union. The\r\nacceding countries of Cyprus, the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland,\r\nSlovakia and Slovenia, the associated countries of\r\nBulgaria, Romania and Turkey, and the European Free\r\nTrade Association country member of the European\r\nEconomic Area, Norway, have aligned themselves with\r\nthis statement.\r\nAt the General Assembly’s special session on\r\nchildren, the international community committed itself\r\nto a set of specific goals for children and young people.\r\nIts outcome document is our undertaking to work\r\ntogether in order to build a world fit for children. A\r\nlittle more than one year later, it is time for us to reflect\r\non our actions and to assess their impact to ensure that\r\nthe Plan of Action does not remain mere words.\r\nCreating a world fit for children is about creating\r\nan enabling environment that impacts the everyday\r\nlives of children and their families. That must be\r\nreflected in all strategies at the international, regional,\r\nnational and local levels. The Plan of Action adopted at\r\nthe special session on children focused on four priority\r\naction areas: promoting healthy lives, providing quality\r\neducation, protecting children from abuse and violence\r\nand combating HIV/AIDS. Those goals are fully\r\nconsistent with the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nthe achievement of which is of central importance to\r\nchildren. The Goals are ambitious, but attainable.\r\nAt the international level we can benefit from the\r\nclear standard provided by the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child and its Optional Protocols. Another\r\nimportant aspect in implementing, at the international\r\nand regional levels, the goals set forth in the Plan of\r\nAction entitled “A world fit for children”, is to\r\nintegrate a rights-based approach into the work of\r\nregional and global organizations such as UNICEF and\r\nother relevant bodies of the United Nations system.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the fact that that\r\napproach is now firmly entrenched in their mandates\r\nand programmes, and considers it particularly\r\nimportant that they continue to follow that path.\r\nFurther efforts to fully mainstream the rights-based\r\napproach are also needed in the concrete\r\nimplementation of programmes at the national level.\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nThe adoption and carrying out of national plans\r\nof action for children is a crucial step towards putting\r\nin place mechanisms for meaningful implementation,\r\nmonitoring and review. Most important, it is the only\r\nfollow-up action defined in “A world fit for children”\r\nto be completed by the end of 2003. For the European\r\nUnion, this element is high on national agendas and is\r\na part of policy- and decision-making in all areas.\r\nMechanisms to monitor compliance with the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child have already\r\nbeen put in place. In fact, ombudsmen for children or\r\nother similar institutions exist in a great number of\r\nEuropean countries. The European Union reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to give high priority to that objective, and\r\nencourages all States to do the same by translating\r\ninternational goals into specific time-bound and\r\nmeasurable national targets based on local needs and\r\nsituations.\r\nIn all those follow-up processes it is fundamental\r\nto actively involve, and work in cooperation with, civil\r\nsociety actors, including non-governmental\r\norganizations and children and their families. Children\r\nand adolescents are resourceful citizens capable of\r\nbuilding a better future for all. We must respect their\r\nright to express themselves and to participate in all\r\nmatters affecting them. In particular, we believe that\r\nfurther action is needed at the national level to take\r\nchildren’s views and interests into account.\r\nThe European Union underscores the importance\r\nit attaches to ensuring that children live healthy lives.\r\nWe note general comment 4 of the Committee on the\r\nRights of the Child, regarding adolescent health and\r\ndevelopment. We also reiterate that sexual and\r\nreproductive health care and education are elements in\r\nthe fight against poverty, and hence in reaching the\r\ngoals and targets set by “A world fit for children”. We\r\ntherefore encourage all Governments to follow up their\r\ncommitments to effectively address, for all persons of\r\nappropriate age, the promotion of their reproductive\r\nand sexual health. The goal of healthy lives for all\r\nchildren also encompasses such other aspects as child\r\nmortality, disease, malnutrition, healthy environments\r\nand mental health. In that respect, all States should\r\nensure that all children have access to sustainable\r\nhealth systems and social services, as well as to\r\nadequate education, information and counselling that\r\nguarantees them the opportunity to participate in\r\ndecisions affecting their health.\r\nIn “A world fit for children”, all States agreed to\r\nensure that all children have access to complete\r\nprimary education that is free, compulsory and of good\r\nquality. The same opportunity should be made equally\r\navailable to all children exposed to difficult situations.\r\nOn several occasions, the European Union has stressed\r\nthe crucial role that education must play in developing\r\nmore extensive and far-reaching actions concerning\r\nchildren. We therefore urge all States to take all\r\nnecessary measures to eliminate obstacles to the full\r\nrealization of the right to education, with particular\r\nemphasis on the education of girls. Indeed, educating\r\ngirls is a key factor to reducing poverty, hunger, under-\r\nage-5 mortality and maternal mortality, as well as in\r\nfighting major diseases. If the goals of the special\r\nsession’s Plan of Action are to be met, the international\r\ncommunity must rapidly move towards the goal of\r\nuniversal primary education by ensuring every girl her\r\nright to education.\r\nMillions of children are still suffering from war,\r\nviolence, exploitation, neglect and all forms of abuse\r\nand discrimination. Violence against children can take\r\nmany forms, such as trafficking, child labour, sexual\r\nexploitation and abduction, physical and psychological\r\nviolence and torture. It can occur everywhere, and it is\r\ndifficult to tackle because it is often hidden. Girls,\r\nchildren belonging to minorities, indigenous children\r\nand children with disabilities are more likely than\r\nothers to suffer from multiple kinds of discrimination.\r\nWe urge all States to adopt a zero-tolerance approach,\r\nto take all necessary measures to combat such practices\r\nand to ensure the investigation, prosecution and\r\npunishment of perpetrators while safeguarding the\r\nrights and interests of child victims at all stages of\r\nproceedings.\r\nThe urgent need to adopt policies and\r\nprogrammes to respond to the needs of millions of\r\nchildren orphaned, or directly and indirectly affected\r\nby HIV/AIDS, has not yet been effectively addressed.\r\nIn that respect, girls are in a particularly difficult\r\nsituation, as they often face economic, legal and social\r\nconstraints that impede effective risk-reduction. Efforts\r\nmust therefore be intensified. Girls need to be\r\nempowered, while boys need to be more involved.\r\nThe European Union reaffirms its commitment to\r\ncombating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria with a\r\nview to their eradication. It welcomes the rapid start-up\r\nof the activities of the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria and affirms its determination\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nto enable this multilateral instrument to bring high-\r\nquality affordable prevention, care and treatment to the\r\nmost needy, in particular children in the developing\r\ncountries. Prevention must include efforts to increase\r\naccess to contraceptives and sexual health information.\r\nThe real implementation of plans for a world fit\r\nfor children has just begun. The Secretary-General’s\r\nreport highlights positive steps already taken by many\r\ncountries in all regions of the world. The progress\r\nachieved so far is a good start, but much more remains\r\nto be done. All relevant actors — Governments, civil\r\nsociety, non-governmental organizations, children and\r\ntheir families and the international community as a\r\nwhole — need to move ahead, from plans and policies\r\nto actions and results.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report contained in document A/58/333\r\nprovides a useful basis for our discussion on the\r\nprogress made in the implementation of the\r\ncommitments we made to our children last year at the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s special session on children. We\r\nthank the Secretary-General for the report and concur\r\nwith the recommendations contained therein.\r\nFurthermore, we commend the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) for its tireless efforts and\r\ncontinued commitment to promote the rights and\r\nwelfare of our children.\r\nThis year is particularly significant because of the\r\nfirst time-bound goals and targets based on the plan of\r\naction entitled “A world fit for children” (resolution\r\nS-27/2). In this respect, I would like to express our\r\nappreciation for the timely and appropriate discussion\r\nfocused on the progress made and problems\r\nencountered in realizing the commitments made at the\r\nspecial session on children.\r\nNot only did the special session on children\r\nprovide us the occasion to review the progress made\r\nsince 1990, it also availed us of the opportunity to\r\nfurther commit ourselves to make this world a better\r\nplace for our children. On our part, the rights of the\r\nchild are enshrined in our constitution as the guiding\r\nprinciple when it comes to issues pertaining to\r\nchildren.\r\nFollowing the special session on children, there\r\nhas been a considerable amount of awareness-raising in\r\nNamibia. For example, as a follow-up to the campaign\r\nfor the “Say Yes for children” pledge, 28 September\r\nwas declared as the Day of the Namibian Child. The\r\nDay of the African Child, commemorated on 16 June,\r\ncontinues to serve as an important platform for children\r\nto raise issues pertaining to their advancement and\r\ndevelopment. Furthermore, the Government, in\r\nconjunction with the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA), is conducting a series of nation-wide\r\nworkshops on the sexual and reproductive health of\r\nadolescents.\r\nWe attach great importance to the health and\r\neducation of our children. The education and health\r\nsector accounts for around forty per cent of our annual\r\nnational budget. Primary health care is free, while\r\ncurative health care is heavily subsidized by the\r\nGovernment. In addition, the treatment programme to\r\nprevent mother-to-child transmission has been piloted\r\nin two main hospitals in the country, and plans are\r\nunder way to expand it to other hospitals.\r\nIn the area of education, the early childhood\r\ndevelopment policy is under review to include\r\nHIV/AIDS components.\r\nPrimary education is free and compulsory in\r\nNamibia, in accordance with the national constitution.\r\nEach year the Government, under the auspices of the\r\nNamibia Institute For Education Development, reviews\r\nand amends the syllabus for all grades in order to\r\nensure quality education for children. The challenge for\r\nus is to provide a universal sustainable quality\r\neducation.\r\nRegarding the promotion and protection of the\r\nwell-being of children, Parliament recently passed the\r\nCombating of Domestic Violence Act. The Act does\r\nnot define violence solely as physical assaults, but\r\nincludes economic, emotional, psychological and\r\nphysiological violence. Furthermore, the Government\r\nis in the process of drafting two acts of legislation for\r\nthe protection of children, namely, the Children’s\r\nStatus Bill and the Child Care and Protection Bill. In\r\nthis field, there are 15 Women and Child Protection\r\nUnits across the country. They are there to protect\r\nbattered women and children and are administered by\r\nthe Namibian police.\r\nAlthough much progress has been made, the\r\nimpact of these achievements remain uneven. Major\r\nchallenges continue to face our Government in\r\nimplementing the plan of action that was adopted at the\r\nspecial session on children.\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to reverse\r\nour hard-earned social and economic gains. It is one of\r\nthe major public health problems in Namibia.\r\nHIV/AIDS is also resulting in an increased number of\r\nhouseholds headed by children. In redressing this\r\nsituation, the Namibian Government is directing more\r\nattention towards improved support for child-headed\r\nhouseholds, through identifying foster parents and\r\nproviding financial assistance to them and ensuring\r\nthat all orphans and other vulnerable children are\r\nregistered without any impediments. Orphans in\r\nNamibia also receive free education. The Government\r\nis currently finalizing the Orphans and Other\r\nVulnerable Children Trust Fund, which will cover all\r\nessential needs for these children.\r\nFurthermore, poverty remains not only a major\r\nobstacle in realizing many of the commitments we\r\nmade to our children but also a cause of many other\r\nsocial evils such as an increase in violence against and\r\nabuse of children. In this respect, girls, more than boys,\r\nare increasingly becoming victims.\r\nAnother obstacle in realizing the commitments\r\nwe made to our children is food insecurity. Namibia is\r\na drought-prone country, and therefore many of our\r\nchildren, especially in the remote areas, suffer from\r\nhunger and related illnesses. As a result, the\r\nGovernment coordinates relief programmes, which\r\ninclude, among others, feeding schemes for school\r\nchildren in some schools. The Government assumes the\r\ncentral role in reaching the most vulnerable citizens\r\nwhen executing its activities.\r\nFinally, the Namibian Government remains fully\r\ncommitted to the implementation of the Plan of Action.\r\nWe are convinced that the effective implementation of\r\nthe Plan of Action requires concerted efforts on all\r\nlevels. Thus, we call on the donor countries to honour\r\ntheir commitment to providing additional resources.\r\nMr. Staehelin (Switzerland) (spoke in French):\r\nSwitzerland has always considered the special session\r\nof the General Assembly devoted to children to be an\r\nimportant opportunity for the international community\r\nto reaffirm in one voice its commitment to children.\r\nFurthermore, we participated actively in the\r\nnegotiations that made possible the adoption of the\r\noutcome document, “A world fit for children”\r\n(resolution S-27/2, annex).\r\n“A world fit for children” contains an ambitious\r\nPlan of Action. While identifying priorities, it\r\nconsiders in a detailed and comprehensive way the\r\nmany challenges that must be faced daily by children in\r\nthe world, particularly in the areas of education, health,\r\neconomic and sexual exploitation and armed conflict.\r\nThe principles of non-discrimination; the best interests\r\nof children; the right to life, to survival and to\r\ndevelopment; and respect for children’s opinions\r\nunderlie the entire Plan of Action. Undoubtedly, some\r\nof the commitments reached during the negotiations\r\nfall short of international standards in this area,\r\nparticularly in the fields of access to reproductive care,\r\njuvenile justice and child labour. That said, each State\r\nremains bound by its international obligations, and\r\ntheir implementation complements that of the Plan of\r\nAction.\r\nThere are many measures that will enable us to\r\nfulfil the objectives and strategies defined during the\r\nspecial session — ratifying international instruments\r\nthat protect children and integrate them into the\r\ndomestic legal system; intensifying international\r\ncooperation to fight transboundary crime, such as the\r\ntrafficking in children and child pornography on the\r\nInternet; and awareness-raising campaigns, to cite only\r\na few. Moreover, identifying national priorities —\r\nincluding at the sectoral level — is necessary, given\r\nthat persistent challenges are not always the same in all\r\nregions of the world.\r\nIn that connection, we thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on follow-up to the United\r\nNations special session on children (A/58/333), which\r\nmy country read with great interest. We share the\r\nopinions expressed by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport and, like him, consider that much remains to be\r\ndone in this area, including in our own country. In\r\norder to bring that about — and without diminishing\r\nthe primary responsibility of States — constructive\r\ncooperation with international organizations, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, the private sector, civil\r\nsociety as a whole and, above all, children themselves\r\nis necessary.\r\nSwitzerland hereby informs the Assembly that it\r\nwill shortly hold informal consultations on a\r\nprocedural draft resolution on follow-up to the special\r\nsession. The draft resolution — which will be a text of\r\nthe General Assembly presidency — will be elaborated\r\nin close cooperation with the member countries of the\r\nExecutive Board of the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund. We consider it particularly important to plan the\r\nconvening of a high-level plenary meeting in 2006,\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nwhen “A world fit for children” requests the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to submit an initial detailed report on progress\r\nachieved. We welcome in advance the valuable\r\ncooperation of all States in that regard.\r\nMs. Tariq (Pakistan): Mr. President, we are\r\nimmensely pleased to see you preside over this\r\nimportant meeting.\r\nToday, millions of children are suffering as a\r\nresult of infant mortality, child trafficking — often\r\nleading to prostitution — and exploitive child labour.\r\nThose deprived, neglected, exploited and abused\r\nchildren continue to call the collective conscience of\r\nhumanity to action. Their plight is a grim reminder of\r\nfailure of the international community. However, the\r\nworst exploitation of children — both as victims and as\r\nchild soldiers — is witnessed in situations of armed\r\nconflict. Despite growing awareness and increased\r\nfocus on children’s protection and rehabilitation, their\r\nsufferings have not ended. For efforts to succeed, we\r\nmust address the root causes. We believe that the just,\r\npeaceful and amicable resolution of long-standing\r\nconflicts in the Middle East, South Asia, Africa,\r\nCentral Asia and elsewhere is essential.\r\nThe twenty-seventh special session of the General\r\nAssembly, on children, was convened last year to take\r\nstock of the abysmal and disheartening situation of the\r\nchildren in the world. Its outcome, the annex to\r\nresolution S-27/2, “A world fit for children”, was a\r\nforward-looking, focused and results-oriented\r\ndocument that painstakingly carved out our shared\r\nagenda — one that can be fulfilled only through\r\nsustained and collective efforts. Such efforts require\r\ninternational assistance for developing countries\r\nthrough debt relief measures, increased development\r\nassistance, enhanced investment, the removal of trade\r\nbarriers and measures to bridge the digital divide.\r\nPakistan took an active part in the special session.\r\n“A world fit for children” provided us with a great\r\nchallenge that Pakistan, its people and governments\r\nhave accepted. Immediately after the special session,\r\nPakistan organized a national conference on children.\r\nAll stakeholders, including the Government, civil\r\nsociety, international organizations, children and media\r\nfrom all over Pakistan, participated. Their views and\r\nrecommendations are being incorporated into the\r\nnational plan of action for children.\r\nFor Pakistan, another follow-up to the special\r\nsession was the establishment of a national child\r\ncommission with an equal partnership among the\r\nfederal and provincial governments, the corporate\r\nsector, civil society, media representatives and, most\r\nimportant of all, children themselves. Four important\r\nsubcommittees have been set up, and that structure will\r\nbe replicated in the provinces.\r\nThe Government is working on good governance,\r\nparticipatory democracy and economic revival.\r\nPakistan is also putting in place a comprehensive\r\nreform programme that protects the vulnerable,\r\nincluding children, and is a fundamental element of\r\nPakistan’s human security agenda. Accordingly, the\r\nnational perspective plan for 2002 to 2012 concentrates\r\non education, infant mortality, child labour and the\r\nreview of legislation in line with our international\r\nobligations.\r\nFollowing are a number of Pakistan’s relevant\r\ninitiatives and achievements.\r\nFirst, free secondary education — especially for\r\ngirls — has been provided. School enrolment is set to\r\nreach 100 per cent by 2010, while the female literacy\r\nrate is set to increase from 39 per cent presently to 67\r\nper cent by 2011.\r\nSecondly, juvenile courts have been set up, and\r\ncapital punishment for juveniles has been abolished.\r\nThe policy of granting amnesty in minor cases has been\r\ncontinued. Prosecution has also been withdrawn in\r\ncases where trails have been delayed due to no fault of\r\nthe juvenile accused. Special arrangements for the\r\neducation of juveniles in prison have been made.\r\nThirdly, greater access to proper nutrition and\r\nhealth facilities is being ensured. Focus remains on\r\nimmunization campaigns, provision of iodized salt and\r\nimprovements with respect to low birth weight.\r\nNational immunization campaigns now cover over 90\r\nper cent of infants and children. Polio has almost been\r\neradicated. Infant mortality has been brought down to\r\nunder 95 per 1,000.\r\nAccess to safe water is now available to more\r\nthan 93 per cent of urban and 78 per cent of the rural\r\npopulation.\r\nTo improve the nutritional status of girl children\r\nin primary schools, the Tawana Pakistan project has\r\nbeen launched, which seeks to provide meals,\r\nmicronutrients and medicine to girls in primary\r\nschools.\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nTo eliminate child labour by 2005, a national\r\npolicy and plan of action have been approved. A fund\r\nhas been established for the education of working\r\nchildren with an initial outlay of 100 million rupees —\r\naround $1.8 million. Special free classes in the\r\nmorning and evening have been arranged for working\r\nchildren, and stipends are being paid to their families\r\nas compensation and incentive.\r\nWe are well aware that the future will judge\r\nnations by the well-being of their children. It is our\r\nconviction that depriving children — whether of\r\nfreedom, growth or education — in truth deprives\r\nnations of their sense of morality. It is in this spirit that\r\nwe join the global voice for a qualitative change in the\r\nlives of our children. Our child-action road map\r\nacknowledges the principle of the best interests of the\r\nchild, which is reflected in our laws, policies,\r\nprogrammes and resource allocation. Despite\r\ndifficulties, we are determined to make our country\r\nand, in turn, the world fit for children.\r\nMs. Omar (Malaysia): I wish to begin by\r\nrecording our appreciation to the Secretary-General for\r\nhis report (A/58/333) outlining the progress, as well as\r\nthe constraints, in meeting the goals of the Declaration\r\nand Plan of Action adopted at the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on children held in May 2002.\r\nMy delegation is pleased that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has reported that good progress has been made\r\nin terms of the commitment of Governments to\r\nincorporate the goals of the Plan of Action into their\r\nnational policies, plans and programmes. However, we\r\nnote with a certain amount of sadness that there has\r\nbeen little change in the major statistical indicators for\r\nthe four goals envisaged by the Plan of Action. Eleven\r\nmillion children under the age of 5 still die each year.\r\nPneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria and HIV/AIDS remain\r\nleading causes of death among children. Over 100\r\nmillion children still do not have access to education;\r\n180 million children are still engaged in the worst\r\nforms of child labour.\r\nThe results of this review, although issued only\r\nslightly more than a year since the special session, are\r\nsufficient to remind us that, unless we pay serious\r\nattention to the problems faced by developing countries\r\nin meeting their commitment, nothing much will\r\nchange in the statistical indicators, even for the next 10\r\nyears. The situation affecting children in these\r\ncountries in the four identified areas may even\r\ndeteriorate. We certainly have a daunting task ahead of\r\nus. We must not forget that the World Summit for\r\nChildren was held in 1990. Twelve years later we\r\nfound it necessary to call for a special session, as the\r\nsituation affecting children remained a cause for\r\nconcern. It is obvious that the collective pledges and\r\ncommitments made to improve the situation need to be\r\ntranslated into concrete action at the national, regional\r\nand international levels. For this, adequate resources,\r\nexpertise and assistance need to be available to all\r\nconcerned.\r\nAt the special session, the international\r\ncommunity committed itself to taking action for the\r\nimprovement and development of all children,\r\nparticularly those in developing countries. Member\r\nStates have collectively acknowledged the imperatives\r\nof international cooperation and a multidimensional\r\napproach to assist developing countries to implement\r\nthe Plan of Action. We reminded ourselves of the\r\npledges made at the various landmark international\r\nmeetings and summits, including through documents\r\nsuch as the Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey\r\nConsensus and the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation. We therefore need to remind ourselves\r\nagain of those commitments and of the actions required\r\nto realize the goals set by the special session on\r\nchildren.\r\nMy delegation commends the relevant United\r\nNations development agencies for their invaluable\r\nsupport and commitment in gearing their activities to\r\nassist and support Member States in implementing the\r\npolicies, plans and programmes proposed by the Plan\r\nof Action. We urge the relevant United Nations\r\nagencies to continue their efforts in assisting\r\ndeveloping countries to establish and strengthen their\r\nnational capacity and institutions for the promotion and\r\nprotection of the rights of children. They could also\r\nexplore the possibility of working in tandem with\r\nregional organizations, where appropriate, to assist\r\nMember States achieve the goals set at the special\r\nsession.\r\nMalaysia began the implementation of its Second\r\nNational Plan of Action for Children prior to the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on children\r\nconvened in 2002. Our Plan of Action, spanning the\r\nperiod from 2001 to 2020, has been formulated in\r\nconformity with the provisions of the Convention on\r\nthe Rights of the Child. Designed as part of the\r\nnational policy to ensure the promotion and the\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nprotection of children, aimed at steering the country to\r\nachieve the status of a developed nation by the year\r\n2020, the National Plan of Action has incorporated all\r\nfour elements and goals envisaged at the special\r\nsession on children.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to share with the\r\nAssembly the action undertaken by Malaysia on the\r\nfour priority areas addressed at the special session on\r\nchildren. First, with regard providing quality education,\r\nin Malaysia education is given the highest priority in\r\nthe national agenda: 20.6 per cent of the total\r\ndevelopment allocation under the Eighth Malaysia Plan\r\nis allocated for education. The national education\r\npolicy is geared towards providing basic education for\r\na minimum of nine years. There is equal access to\r\neducational opportunities for both girls and boys, with\r\nthe proportion of enrolment of the two genders being\r\nalmost equal — 50.4 per cent boys and 49.6 per cent\r\ngirls — except at the tertiary level, where there is\r\nhigher enrolment of girls than boys. Educational\r\nfacilities have been put in place in all schools\r\nthroughout the country for the disabled. With this\r\ndevelopment, the Government has now made primary\r\neducation compulsory for all.\r\nSecondly, with regard to promoting healthy lives,\r\nMalaysia has developed the health sector and\r\ncontinuously upgrades medical facilities and\r\nprogrammes in the country. This has led to, among\r\nother things, a steady decline in maternal and neonatal\r\nmortality, which currently stand at 0.2 and 5 per 1,000\r\nrespectively. To ensure that every child can enjoy\r\noptimal health, community clinics have been set up\r\nthroughout the country. These health centres provide\r\nimmunization, normal-development assessment and\r\nother related medical care for children. Malaysia has\r\nalso given special attention to disabled children in line\r\nwith the concept of total rehabilitation, which entails a\r\nmultidisciplinary approach. The Department of Social\r\nWelfare, through institutional services, with the\r\nMinistry of Health providing technical input, provides\r\nrehabilitation services for disabled children.\r\nThirdly, in the context of protecting children\r\nagainst abuse, exploitation and violence, Malaysia has\r\nenacted its Child Act 2001, formulated in line with the\r\nprovisions of the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild. The act sets out provisions for the care and\r\nprotection of children. A court for children has been\r\nestablished. In dealing with problems of child abuse,\r\nMalaysia has developed mechanisms for child\r\nprotection, care and rehabilitation through the setting\r\nup of intersectoral Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect\r\n(SCAN) teams at district and state hospitals. A\r\nmilestone in preventive measures is the establishment\r\nof child protection teams, which set out multiple\r\nprogrammes run by the community and for the\r\ncommunity. Among other things, they run parental\r\neducation activities and serve as counselling centres.\r\nMalaysia has also taken measures to combat the\r\ncommercial sexual exploitation and trafficking of\r\nchildren. Since effective measures to combat such\r\ncrimes requires regional and international cooperation,\r\nthe relevant authorities in Malaysia have developed\r\nclose cooperation with their counterparts, particularly\r\namong countries of the Association of Southeast Asian\r\nNations (ASEAN).\r\nFourthly, in combating HIV/AIDS, Malaysia has\r\ngiven very serious attention to measures to combat\r\nHIV/AIDS, although the reported number of cases of\r\nHIV infection is low, in proportion to our population.\r\nThe Government has taken a comprehensive and\r\nintegrated approach in dealing with this problem; it\r\nincludes preventive measures, care, support and\r\ntreatment for those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe Government works closely with Non-\r\nGovernmental Organizations (NGOs) in this regard, in\r\nparticular the Malaysian AIDS Council, an umbrella\r\norganization headed by Datin Paduka Marina Mahathir.\r\nFully recognizing that the future of a country\r\ndepends to a great extent on the advancement and\r\nprotection of its children, Malaysia has pledged in its\r\nVision 2020 that every child born should be brought up\r\nin a healthy environment; provided with all necessary\r\nprotection against diseases; receive proper nurturing,\r\ncare and affection; receive general and higher\r\neducation as far as possible; learn appropriate skills in\r\nthe necessary fields; and be imbued with cultural and\r\nhuman values.\r\nMalaysia is prepared to cooperate with the United\r\nNations, in particular the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund, to offer information on the experiences we have\r\ngained in the implementation of the Declaration and\r\nPlan of Action of the special session. We hope that the\r\nsharing and dissemination of information on our\r\nrespective experiences will assist Member States in\r\nmoving towards the goals in the four areas envisioned\r\nat the special session on children.\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nMrs. Sereno (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\ndelegation of Uruguay aligns itself with the statement\r\nmade by Peru on behalf of the Rio Group.\r\nThe Declaration and Plan of Action annexed to\r\nresolution S-27/2, entitled “A world fit for children”\r\nand adopted at the twenty-seventh special session of\r\nthe General Assembly, represent a commitment by the\r\ninternational community to consider boys, girls and\r\nadolescents as a priority development goal. They\r\ncontain recommendations to States to help them\r\nimplement the mechanisms necessary to provide\r\nchildren with a quality education and protect them\r\nfrom abuse, exploitation and violence, and to combat\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nIt is now time to review the progress achieved\r\ntowards the first goal set forth in that document, which\r\nis the elaboration and strengthening of national and\r\nregional plans of action targeted at children, and to\r\ntransform international objectives into national\r\nobjectives based on local needs and situations, a goal\r\nthat should be achieved by the end of this year.\r\nFor Uruguay, the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild is the basis and principal normative framework\r\nthat guides national strategies related to children.\r\nUruguay has also ratified the two Optional Protocols to\r\nthe Convention, on the involvement of children in\r\narmed conflict, and on the sale of children, child\r\nprostitution and child pornography.\r\nUruguay has increased public spending for this\r\nsector of the population and has obtained good results,\r\nsuch as in the field of health, for example, where the\r\nrate of infant mortality has declined, and in the field of\r\neducation, where universal education has been\r\nintroduced from the age of four years.\r\nHowever, together with progress in policies for\r\nthe provision and expansion of comprehensive services\r\nfor children, Uruguay is encountering a series of\r\ndifficulties as a result of the prolonged economic crisis\r\nfrom which it has been suffering for nearly five years\r\nnow, which has affected the most vulnerable sectors of\r\nsociety and has led to such problems as an increased\r\nincidence of poverty among children and child labour.\r\nIn order to combat these and other evils that\r\naffect our children and to promote the effective\r\nenjoyment of their rights, Uruguay has been developing\r\na comprehensive programme for at-risk children, youth\r\nand families. This programme depends on and is\r\ncoordinated by the secretariat of the office of the\r\nPresident of the Republic and is thus a reflection of the\r\nGovernment’s determination to take leadership in this\r\nfield. In addition to national counterpart funding in the\r\namount of $4.5 million, the programme will be\r\nfinanced through a loan from the Inter-American\r\nDevelopment Bank in the amount of $40 million,\r\nrepayable over 25 years with a five-year grace period.\r\nThe programme is notable for its participatory\r\nand intersectoral design, which was developed jointly\r\nby the State, civil society and various young people’s\r\ngroups which are potential beneficiaries. Its objective\r\nis to improve the living conditions and the social\r\nintegration of boys, girls and youth who are in\r\nsituations of social risk, as well as of their families. To\r\nthat end, we will work to provide comprehensive care\r\nand greater access to quality services for the entire\r\nfamily group, giving priority to preventive action that\r\nwill have a sustainable impact over the long term. The\r\nprogramme consists, inter alia, of major components\r\nthat include comprehensive projects for prevention and\r\ncare for children by age group, with special models for\r\nthe prevention of teenage pregnancy and for the needs\r\nof street children and victims of child abuse and sexual\r\nabuse.\r\nIn that connection, I wish to draw attention to the\r\nincrease in resources and the introduction of new\r\nmethodologies for the Child and Family Health Centres\r\nthat provide services to households with children aged\r\nup to four. For children aged 4 to 12 years, the goal is\r\nto strengthen the links between the family, school and\r\ncommunity, by encouraging healthy lifestyles and\r\npromoting, for example, recreational activities and\r\nsports as vehicles for socialization and integration.\r\nIn the case of children aged 13 to 17 years, efforts\r\nwill focus on, among other things, reintegrating them\r\ninto the formal educational system in order to permit\r\nthem to acquire and develop skills that will prepare\r\nthem for later inclusion in the labour market.\r\nAnother important aspect of the programme\r\nrelates to the teaching and widespread dissemination of\r\nthe rights of the child, in which the goal is to ensure\r\nthe widest possible dissemination and to promote\r\ngreater awareness within society at large of the specific\r\nconditions of the population to which the programme is\r\ntargeted and to publicize the contributions made by\r\nchildren and youth themselves to the programme. This\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nprogramme is national in scope and is expected to\r\noperate for five years.\r\nApart from the elaboration of this programme,\r\nUruguay has embarked on a number of other initiatives\r\naimed at implementing the recommendations contained\r\nin the document entitled “A world fit for children”\r\n(resolution S-27/2, annex) and at addressing the\r\nproblems that affect our children and young people.\r\nIn order to combat the problems of teenage\r\npregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including\r\nHIV/AIDS, we have decided to implement a single\r\nnational sex education programme as part of the school\r\ncurriculum and health service, which includes the\r\ncompulsory training of teachers, instructors and health\r\nprofessionals.\r\nThe plan also places emphasis on the importance\r\nof the family unit, on educational and health care\r\nestablishments, as well as on extended social circles\r\nsuch as friends, sporting groups, religious\r\norganizations and other groups that can influence the\r\nteaching of children and youth.\r\nParliament is also considering draft legislation for\r\nthe establishment of a national council on guidance and\r\nassistance for graduates of the National Youth Institute,\r\nwith the aim of continuing training, care and assistance\r\nto these young people.\r\nAnother initiative is the so-called “Blue Line”, a\r\ntoll-free telephone line whereby children and\r\nadolescent victims of abuse or violence of any kind can\r\nlook for help and counselling.\r\nIt should be noted that all of these actions on\r\nbehalf of children are being undertaken with the\r\nvaluable support and tireless work of civil society in\r\nUruguay, especially the national networks of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and children’s\r\norganizations. The latter include, for example, “Gurises\r\nUnidos”, an organization that works with street\r\nchildren. Their General Coordinator chaired the caucus\r\nof Latin American and Caribbean non-governmental\r\norganizations during the special session.\r\nThese and other plans and projects represent a\r\nmajor challenge for Uruguay. In order to achieve their\r\nfull implementation, the national authorities are\r\nmaking strenuous efforts in the knowledge that placing\r\nchildren first, eradicating poverty by investing in\r\nchildren, not allowing any child to be left behind, and\r\nguaranteeing children the protection, care, health and\r\neducation that they deserve will enable them to develop\r\ninto upright individuals and responsible citizens,\r\ncapable of living in a society that is truly democratic,\r\negalitarian, free of discrimination, with peace and\r\nsocial justice, and a society in which one can respect\r\nand enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nThe Chinese delegation wishes to thank the Secretariat\r\nfor the report submitted by the Secretary-General. I\r\nwould like to take this opportunity to describe China’s\r\nprogress made as a follow-up to the United Nations\r\nspecial session on children. The Chinese Government\r\npromulgated in May 2001 a national programme of\r\naction for child development in China, which laid out\r\nthe goals of decreasing the mortality rates of infants,\r\nchildren under five years of age and their mothers;\r\nreducing malnutrition in children under 5, and\r\npromoting the early development of children,\r\nincreasing their access to school and raising their\r\neducational levels.\r\nIn order to reach the goals put forward by the\r\nUnited Nations special session on children,\r\nGovernmental agencies have formulated a series of\r\nplans at all levels. The relevant Government\r\ndepartments and organizations have been given specific\r\nresponsibilities for implementation and have reinforced\r\ntheir efforts by mapping out detailed plans and defining\r\nkey areas and difficult issues.\r\nThe National working committee on women and\r\nchildren, a central Government department responsible\r\nfor work with children, is made up of 24 Government\r\ndepartments and five non-governmental organizations.\r\nSince 2001, the working committee on women and\r\nchildren has further strengthened its functions with\r\nincreased staff and funds in all provinces, prefectures\r\nand counties.\r\nThese committees are responsible for promoting\r\nand coordinating the implementation of the national\r\nprogramme of action by Government departments and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, and for monitoring\r\nand evaluating its implementation process. At present,\r\na national-level monitoring and statistical indicator\r\nsystem has been established, and the training of\r\nprovincial monitoring and statistical personnel has\r\nbegun.\r\nChina has promulgated a series of laws\r\nconcerning the survival, protection and development of\r\nwomen and children. In addition to the Constitution,\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nthere are, for example, laws on education, the\r\nprotection of minors, maternal and childcare and\r\nadoption, as well as numerous corresponding\r\nregulations and policy measures which together form a\r\nfairly complete legal framework for the protection of\r\nthe rights and interests of children.\r\nAs the largest non-governmental organization in\r\nChina, the All China Women’s Federation has closely\r\nfollowed issues relating to children such as the rights\r\nof the child, and the protection, education, health,\r\nparticipation and development of children.\r\nSince the special session on children, the\r\nFederation has attached even greater importance to the\r\nrole of those working with children at the grass-roots\r\nlevel. To further improve the training of these workers,\r\nworkshops on women and children have been\r\norganized at various levels and vigorous efforts have\r\nbeen made to utilize international resources and\r\nintroduce good international practices.\r\nSteps have been taken to create a favourable\r\nexternal environment and opportunities for children’s\r\nparticipation, and related efforts have been made in\r\nvarious areas, including awareness-raising, to help\r\nbring about a better understanding of girls.\r\nChina is the developing country with the largest\r\npopulation in the world, and the Chinese Government\r\nand all sectors of its society have made unremitting\r\nefforts to bring about a world fit for children. Although\r\nmajor achievements have been registered, there are still\r\ndifficulties and challenges ahead. We will, as always,\r\nabide by the principle of “children first”, and we will\r\ncontinue to promote the survival, protection,\r\ndevelopment and participation of children and to strive\r\nto build a better future for them.\r\nMs. Rustam (Indonesia): On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, I would like first of all to extend our\r\nappreciation to you, Sir, for your resolute efforts to\r\nensure the successful work of this body. I would like\r\nalso to commend the Secretary-General for his report\r\nentitled “Follow-up to the United Nations special\r\nsession on children”.\r\nA year ago, world leaders and heads of State,\r\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs), children’s\r\nadvocates and young people themselves gathered here,\r\non the occasion of the twenty-eighth special session of\r\nthe General Assembly, to decide the future of the\r\nchildren and adolescents of the world. The outcome of\r\nthat special session, “A world fit for children”, is an\r\nessential document which outlines goals, strategies and\r\nactions towards the creation of a liveable world for\r\nchildren.\r\nIn order to ensure the realization of a world fit for\r\nchildren, we must reaffirm our commitment to the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the special session.\r\nA year or so later, it is also important that we use this\r\nopportunity to share our experiences in the\r\nimplementation of the outcome document.\r\nThe Declaration and Plan of Action entitled “A\r\nworld fit for children” form the basis for the\r\nIndonesian Government to advance national\r\ndevelopment planning for children and child-rights-\r\nbased programmes. The Government is currently\r\nfinalizing the National Programme for Children in\r\nIndonesia 2015. That programme addresses the key\r\nissues of child health and nutrition, children and HIV,\r\nearly childhood care and development, basic nine-year\r\neducation, and child protection.\r\nAs far as child health is concerned, the\r\nIndonesian Government has introduced specific\r\npolicies focusing on the promotion of community\r\nnutrition education, family nutrition improvement, food\r\nfortification, and implementation of food and nutrition\r\nsurveillance systems. The Government has also\r\ntranslated its vision into the Healthy Indonesia 2010\r\nprogramme, using a life-cycle approach to address\r\nspecific health and nutrition issues.\r\nAs a child is closely linked to his or her mother,\r\nensuring the health of mothers and reducing maternal\r\nmortality is essential. The Government has since 2001\r\ninitiated various programmes and initiatives for that\r\npurpose, including the National Safe Motherhood\r\nProgramme and the Making Pregnancy Safer Strategy.\r\nDespite the fact that the number of HIV/AIDS\r\ncases among children remains low, the Indonesian\r\nGovernment has taken proactive measures to prevent\r\nthe spread of the epidemic, especially among children,\r\nthrough, for example, mother-to-child transmission.\r\nThe Government’s commitment to combating the\r\ndisease is reflected in the new National Strategy to\r\nCombat HIV/AIDS 2003-2007.\r\nWe believe that the quality of the care received by\r\na child in its first years of life are of fundamental\r\nimportance to its development. A child’s first years\r\nmake up the formative period, when children undergo\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\ngreat leaps in physical, social, intellectual and\r\nemotional development. Under the current National\r\nDevelopment Plan, the Government is looking into the\r\npossibility of cooperating with local educational\r\ninstitutions to provide training for teachers and\r\nfacilitators of early childhood education. We also\r\npromote social awareness of early childhood care and\r\ndevelopment among parents in order to sensitize them\r\nto the idea of structured early-stimulation programmes.\r\nAs regards providing children with education, we\r\nfocus on enhancing access to, and improving the\r\nquality of, education. At this stage, Indonesia has\r\nalready achieved a 95 per cent net enrolment of\r\nchildren aged seven to 12 years of age in primary\r\nschools. We are continuing our efforts to provide nine\r\nyears of quality basic education to all children.\r\nWe also pay particular attention to the issues of\r\nchild labour, child trafficking and sexually exploited\r\nchildren, and to the emerging issues of children’s\r\ninvolvement in the use, production and distribution of\r\nillicit drugs. We recognize these problems and continue\r\nour efforts to strengthen coordination and collaboration\r\namong the relevant institutions, including through the\r\ninvolvement of civil society, to address the problem.\r\nThe Government of Indonesia is currently\r\nworking to increase understanding of child-protection\r\nissues by developing a profile of Indonesian children,\r\nwhich draws from available statistics and academic\r\nresearch. Mapping, rapid assessments and other studies\r\nare being carried out by institutions with the assistance\r\nof a number of donor agencies.\r\nIndonesia also continues to emphasize the\r\nimportance of international cooperation in addressing\r\nissues concerning the promotion of the well-being of\r\nchildren and the protection of their rights. International\r\ncooperation is essential in particular to the\r\nstrengthening of national capacity-building, in order\r\neffectively to implement the outcome document of the\r\nspecial session on children.\r\nBefore I conclude, let me add a few words\r\nregarding the Bali Consensus — the outcome of the\r\nsixth East Asia and the Pacific Ministerial Consultation\r\non Children — which was mentioned in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report.\r\nThe Bali Consensus contains commitments on\r\nbuilding partnerships with and for children and young\r\npeople. The document lists focus areas for regional\r\ncooperation, recommends effective partnerships, and\r\nidentifies goals and principles of action. The\r\nConsensus emphasizes partnerships as an integral part\r\nof realizing the Millennium Development Goals and\r\nthe 2002 “A world fit for children” Plan of Action.\r\nThe Consensus argues that we should involve all\r\nsectors of society in our partnerships, including\r\nchildren and young people; families; Governments;\r\nparliamentarians; NGOs; community-based\r\norganizations; the private sector; civil society;\r\nreligious, spiritual, cultural, indigenous, and traditional\r\nleaders; the mass media; regional and international\r\norganizations; and donor partners.\r\nIn our efforts to improve the lives of children in\r\nthe East Asia and Pacific region, the Consensus has\r\nidentified four focus areas for cooperation. These\r\ninclude: HIV/AIDS; trafficking and the commercial\r\nsexual exploitation of children; maternal and neonatal\r\nmortality; and child malnutrition. The first two issues\r\nare new and complicated challenges to the countries in\r\nthe region. The last two issues, on the other hand, are\r\nrelatively longstanding and tend to be intractable.\r\nIn fulfilling our policy commitments to children\r\nin our region, we have agreed that all policies and\r\nactions that affect children and young people must be\r\nguided by the spirit and principles of the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child. We have also agreed to\r\nensure peace and stability and to reduce poverty in\r\norder to guarantee the fulfilment of the rights of all\r\nchildren and young people; improve the quality,\r\naccessibility and equity of education in order to\r\nachieve our goals; and promote the active and\r\nmeaningful participation and empowerment of women,\r\nchildren and young people in all activities that affect\r\ntheir lives, including involvement in the achievement\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals and in the\r\nimplementation of the outcome document “A World Fit\r\nfor Children”.\r\nIt is our hope that the international community\r\nand the United Nations will maintain their support for\r\nour regional efforts as we strive to create a world fit for\r\ngenerations to come.\r\nMr. Nguyen Thanh Chau (Viet Nam): I would\r\nlike to express Viet Nam’s high appreciation and\r\nsincere thanks to the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive report on follow-up to the special\r\nsession on children (A/58/333). It sums up the global\r\nendeavour in favour of the interests of children.\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nThe specific goals are set forth in the Declaration\r\nand Plan of Action entitled “A world fit for children”\r\n(resolution S-27/2, annex): to promote healthy lives; to\r\nprovide quality education; to protect children against\r\nabuse, exploitation and violence; and to combat\r\nHIV/AIDS. This is actually the least we could do for\r\nour children, who we all agree are not only the future\r\nbut also the masters of the country and the world.\r\nWe are pleased to note that as many as 140\r\ncountries have taken concrete actions to translate those\r\ncommitments into action and to integrate them into\r\ntheir existing national plans and policies. Special care\r\nhas been given to children by intensifying programmes\r\nfor vaccines and immunization, for the eradication of\r\npolio and malaria and for improving nutrition. Progress\r\nhas been made: more than 80 per cent of school-aged\r\nchildren are enrolled in school globally, and the quality\r\nof basic education has improved dramatically.\r\nHowever, it is sad to know that while progress\r\nhas been made, children around the world continue to\r\nsuffer. Nearly 200 million children under five years of\r\nage are malnourished, 11 million of whom die each\r\nyear. More than 100 million children still have no\r\naccess to education; 250 million children have to work\r\nfor a living, of which 180 million are engaged in the\r\nworst forms of child labour. Forty million suffer from\r\nabuse and neglect, while thousands more are infected\r\nwith HIV/AIDS. We are also particularly concerned\r\nover the alarming issue of the sexual exploitation and\r\nillegal trafficking of children. It is therefore high time\r\nfor the international community to cooperate and take\r\nresolute measures to prevent and put an end to such\r\nsituations.\r\nIn Viet Nam, it is a national tradition, as well as a\r\nconsistent policy of the State, to provide children with\r\nthe best in protection, care and education. As early as\r\n1991, immediately after the 1990 World Summit for\r\nChildren, a national programme of action for the\r\nprotection and care of children was promulgated. Its\r\nobjectives for the period 1991 to 2000 have\r\nsuccessfully been achieved. Now, the whole nation,\r\nfrom its centre to the grass-roots level, is mobilized to\r\nimplement the 2001-2010 national programme of\r\naction, which defines specific goals for nutrition,\r\nhealth care, primary education, clean water and\r\nenvironment, culture, leisure and recreation for\r\nchildren. In short, it will ensure the children’s\r\nfundamental rights and cater for all their needs.\r\nUnder the guiding spirit of “A world fit for\r\nchildren”, as stated in the Declaration and Programme\r\nof Action of the special session on children, our\r\nGovernment’s budget for the social sector increased\r\nconsiderably — by 30 per cent — for the period\r\n1995 to 2000 and is on the increase. As a result,\r\nchildren now have much better access to health care,\r\neducation and protection. The picture is bright. The\r\nmortality rate of children under five was reduced to\r\n42 per 1,000 — compared to the target of 50 of 1,000;\r\n93.3 per cent of children from 1 to 6 years of age have\r\nbeen immunized against six basic diseases — the target\r\nwas 90 per cent; 100 per cent of diseases related to\r\nvitamin A deficiency have been eliminated; the\r\nmalnutrition rate was reduced from 51.5 per cent in\r\n1990 to 33.1 per cent in 2000; in 2000, polio was\r\nthoroughly eradicated; 100 per cent of provinces and\r\ncities succeeded in eradicating illiteracy and\r\nuniversalizing primary education; 93 per cent of\r\n6-year-old children go to school, compared to the target\r\nof 90 percent.\r\nIt is obvious that achievements have been\r\nrecorded in the field of the promotion and protection of\r\nthe rights of the child in Viet Nam. However, we are\r\nfully aware that much remains to be done to meet the\r\nchallenges. We would like to express our most sincere\r\nthanks to the many international organizations,\r\nparticularly UNICEF, and friends around the world\r\nwho have provided us with generous support and\r\nassistance. Viet Nam is ready to share, as well as to\r\nlearn from the experiences of others so that we can\r\nwork together to fulfil our goal of creating a world fit\r\nfor children.\r\nWe all had our childhood, which may have been\r\nfull of happiness or sorrow and sadness. However it\r\nwas, our obligations and responsibilities are to ensure\r\nby all means that our children, our future, will enjoy a\r\nlife filled with laughter, fun and joy.\r\nMs. Jahan (Bangladesh): The special session of\r\nthe General Assembly on children, held in May 2002,\r\nprovided a unique opportunity to pledge our renewed\r\ncommitment to build a safe and happy world for our\r\nchildren. The outcome document, entitled “A world fit\r\nfor children” (resolution S-27/2, annex), provided a\r\ncomprehensive work programme to ensure for every\r\nchild a decent, secure and fulfilling life. Bangladesh\r\nwas privileged to be actively involved with the process\r\nboth as a facilitator and as a Vice-Chairman of the\r\nPreparatory Committee. Earlier, in 1990, at the World\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nSummit for Children, world leaders committed\r\nthemselves to the specific goals of children’s survival\r\nand development and protection of their rights.\r\nAs we pause to reflect on our achievements, we\r\nmust ask ourselves whether our children are better off\r\ntoday than they were a decade ago. If they are not, then\r\nwe must rededicate ourselves with renewed vigour and\r\nsincerity in addressing their special concerns. The\r\noverall situation of children in many parts of the world\r\nremains critical. Children continue to be the most\r\nvulnerable victims of poverty, armed conflict,\r\ntrafficking, displacement, HIV/AIDS and many forms\r\nof discrimination and abuse, including sexual\r\nexploitation. Other equally formidable challenges, such\r\nas illiteracy, hunger, malnutrition and a high incidence\r\nof child mortality, physical and mental disabilities,\r\npersist and threaten the very survival and the\r\ndevelopment of millions of children worldwide. It\r\ncertainly is a sad commentary on our times.\r\nWhile we note that the global situation of\r\nchildren remains far from ideal, we must nonetheless\r\nrecognize the forward movement, however little it may\r\nhave been, that has taken place in parts of the world.\r\nIn translating our international commitments at\r\nthe national level, Bangladesh has adopted a national\r\nplan of action for children. The survival of children,\r\ntheir protection against killer diseases and education\r\nare important priorities of the plan, which focuses on\r\nthe girl child. The decade 2001 to 2010 has been\r\ndeclared the Decade of the Rights of the Child in\r\nBangladesh.\r\nBangladesh is committed to the four major\r\npriority concerns, as specified in the outcome\r\ndocument of the special session, “A world fit for\r\nchildren”: promoting healthy lives; providing quality\r\neducation; protecting children from abuse, exploitation\r\nand violence; and combating HIV/AIDS.\r\nIn our national budget, allocations have been\r\nsignificantly increased for education and primary\r\nhealth care. To be more specific, the highest allocation\r\nof resources has been placed with the education sector.\r\nWe have achieved a commendable record in school\r\nenrolment, which now stands at 93.3 per cent. Primary\r\neducation has been made compulsory for all, and free\r\nfor girls up to the twelfth grade. Girl children are also\r\nawarded stipends and scholarships. These special\r\nincentives have brought parity in girls’ enrolment, with\r\na positive impact on the age of marriage and on the\r\nhealth of women and children. Innovative ideas in the\r\narea of informal education, including our food-for-\r\neducation programme and microcredit programmes,\r\nhave also facilitated the well-being of children,\r\nparticularly the girl child.\r\nRemarkable progress has been made in reducing\r\nchild mortality and malnutrition through an extended\r\nimmunization programme. Progress has also been\r\nachieved in reducing iodine deficiency disorders.\r\nVitamin A supplementation, oral rehydration therapy\r\nand programmes on safe motherhood have also saved\r\nmillions of children’s lives.\r\nWithin its limited resources, Bangladesh is\r\nstriving hard to provide access to safe drinking water\r\nfor its population, including children. However, the\r\nmagnitude of the arsenic problem remains a critical\r\nconcern. We hope relevant international bodies,\r\nincluding the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF) and the World Health Organization, will be\r\nforthcoming in assisting us in this regard.\r\nAlthough Bangladesh figures among the low-\r\nprevalence countries affected by HIV/AIDS, as a\r\nprecautionary measure we have adopted a national\r\npolicy on HIV/AIDS with a focus on children infected\r\nand affected by HIV/AIDS. Special programmes have\r\nalso been undertaken for children with disabilities. The\r\nGovernment runs 64 integrated schools for visually\r\nimpaired children; these are found in all district\r\nheadquarters of the country. Programmes have also\r\nbeen undertaken for abandoned and street children.\r\nSignificant achievements have been made in\r\nphasing out child labour from the garment industry\r\nwith the active support of the International Labour\r\nOrganization (ILO) and UNICEF.\r\nOur success in all these areas should not give us\r\nreason for complacency. Among the issues that would\r\nneed our urgent attention in sustaining our gains is\r\npoverty eradication. Our national efforts in that regard\r\nneed to be supplemented by active and sustained\r\ninternational cooperation. Similarly, the Government\r\nand civil society must act in partnership in promoting\r\nthe growth and the development of our children.\r\nBangladesh is fully committed to the protection\r\nand the promotion of human rights of children. We\r\nwere one of the first countries to sign and ratify the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child. We are also one\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nof the first few countries that has ratified the two\r\nOptional Protocols to the Convention.\r\nAt the regional level, we have signed the South\r\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)\r\nConvention on Regional Arrangements for the\r\nPromotion of Child Welfare in South Asia. Bangladesh\r\nplayed a pioneering role in the adoption of the SAARC\r\nConvention on Preventing and Combating the\r\nTrafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution.\r\nThe elimination of trafficking in persons,\r\nespecially children, has been accorded particular\r\npriority in Bangladesh. A national advisory committee\r\nhas been established to combat trafficking. Stringent\r\nlegislative acts aimed at protecting women and\r\nchildren, in particular girls, from all forms of abuse,\r\nexploitation, violence and discrimination have been\r\nenacted.\r\nHowever, we are aware that legal reforms and\r\nlegislation alone are not enough, unless they are\r\neffectively followed and implemented. We,\r\nnonetheless, are making our best endeavours to provide\r\nfor children’s development against a social backdrop\r\nwhere values of pluralism, democracy, human rights,\r\nfamily tradition and cultural norms are pervasive. Such\r\na society, we believe, is the best school for a child’s\r\nupbringing.\r\nThere are some other areas of concern on which\r\nwe must focus further. Our experiences reveal that the\r\ntrauma of armed conflict spares none, but that the\r\nworst affected by far are children. The international\r\ncommunity, including the United Nations, must aim at\r\nreinforcing international action concerning children in\r\narmed conflict and in refugee situations.\r\nWe must work closely in support of children in a\r\nconsistent fashion. Children deserve to be at the very\r\nheart of our development agenda. They must be a\r\ncentral focus of international cooperation. We must be\r\nable to mobilize adequate international resources to\r\nsupplement national efforts aimed at promoting the\r\ngrowth and development of our children. As we meet\r\nhere today, a deep sense of realization dawns on us that\r\nmuch still remains to be done in transforming our\r\ncommitments into concrete actions that will lead to a\r\nbetter world for our children.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to recall what our\r\nPrime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia stated at the\r\nspecial session on children in May last year:\r\n“Our children are our greatest asset, the source of\r\nour joy and the future of our nations, our\r\ncountries and the world. ...\r\n“...\r\n“... The Assembly finds Bangladesh at the\r\nforefront of efforts to give our children the best\r\npossible first start in life. I am confident that all\r\nof us gathered here will also do the same”.\r\n(A/S-27/PV.2, pp. 1-2)\r\nMr. Kirn (Slovenia): Slovenia associates itself\r\nwith and fully endorses the statement made earlier by\r\nthe Italian presidency of the European Union. Since the\r\nrights of the child are a very important part of\r\nSlovenia’s domestic and foreign policy agendas, we\r\nshould like in our national capacity to highlight a\r\nnumber of issues regarding the implementation of the\r\noutcome of the special session on children.\r\nLast year, States Members of the United Nations\r\nadopted “A world fit for children” (resolution S-27/2,\r\nannex), which includes a Declaration and a Plan of\r\nAction. It is definitely an ambitious agenda that\r\nrequires comprehensive action. It may be too early to\r\nreview overall implementation of the outcome, yet\r\ntoday’s discussion is important for sharing experiences\r\nand practices — especially at the national level — and\r\nfor ensuring that the political attention devoted to the\r\nsubject is as strong as it was one year ago.\r\n“A world fit for children” is an important\r\nsupplement to the Millennium Declaration, since it\r\naccommodates the implementation of relevant\r\nMillennium Development Goals for the best interests\r\nof children. From the human rights perspective, “A\r\nworld fit for children” emphasizes clearly that the\r\nfocus of international action should be guided by the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child and its two\r\nOptional Protocols as the ultimate references in\r\nprotecting and promoting the rights and well-being of\r\nchildren. It is our hope that that can be reaffirmed by\r\nuniversal ratification of the Convention in the near\r\nfuture. Since economic and social development and the\r\nprotection of human rights — including the rights of\r\nthe child — are interlinked and inseparable, we warmly\r\nwelcome the rights-based approach to development\r\ncooperation programmes, which has been implemented\r\nby the United Nations Children’s Fund and other\r\nUnited Nations agencies.\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nAllow me to highlight a number of activities that\r\nare taking place in Slovenia as immediate follow-up\r\nmeasures to the special session, all being implemented\r\nin strong partnerships between relevant governmental\r\ninstitutions and civil society organizations, especially\r\nthe Slovenian National Committee for UNICEF. As a\r\nfirst step, the outcome document “A world fit for\r\nchildren” has been translated into the Slovenian\r\nlanguage and has also been published in a modified\r\nform that is easily understandable by young children. It\r\nis being widely distributed to all kindergartens, schools\r\nand other educational institutions.\r\nSlovenia’s Ministry of Labour, Family and Social\r\nAffairs, together with the National Committee for\r\nUNICEF, is preparing a national plan of action for\r\nchildren for the period 2003 to 2013, to be adopted by\r\nthe national Parliament next spring. It includes all\r\nissues and areas affecting the lives of children and\r\nadolescents in modern society and emphasizes\r\nSlovenia’s international obligations as a future member\r\nof the European Union. According to the plan, the new\r\ninstitution of an ombudsman for children is to be\r\nestablished, either as an independent body or within the\r\nframework of the existing office of the human rights\r\nombudsman. In addition, a special governmental office\r\nwill be created to more effectively coordinate various\r\nintersectoral activities related to children’s well-being.\r\nImplementation of the national plan of action will be\r\nmonitored by the so-called child observatory, given the\r\nimportance of active participation by children in\r\ndecision-making that affects their lives.\r\nAll priority areas of the outcome document “A\r\nworld fit for children” are equally important, and equal\r\nattention should be devoted to all of them. But there is\r\none area of particular concern for Slovenia and its\r\nforeign policy agenda: protection from abuse,\r\nexploitation and violence, with an emphasis on\r\nchildren in armed conflict. In the past two years, we\r\nhave witnessed important developments in that field in\r\naddition to the document “A world fit for children”: the\r\nentry into force of the Optional Protocol to the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child on the\r\ninvolvement of children in armed conflict, the adoption\r\nof relevant Security Council resolutions and the\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court.\r\nIn addition to global efforts, regional and inter-\r\nregional action is needed. Slovenia highly appreciates\r\nbeing a member of the Human Security Network, a\r\ngroup of like-minded countries from all regions of the\r\nworld. The protection of children in armed conflict is\r\none of the priorities of the Network’s agenda, and\r\nSlovenia warmly welcomes that.\r\nIt is not possible to build sustainable peace unless\r\nchildren are provided with rehabilitation and faith in\r\nthe future. Several years ago, mindful of the\r\nimportance of children for the prosperity of post-\r\nconflict societies, Slovenia decided to establish an\r\ninstitution to assist war-affected children: the\r\n“Together” Centre for the Psycho-social Well-being of\r\nChildren. The basic principle of the centre is to\r\nstrengthen local structures in the childcare field and to\r\ndevelop new mechanisms for children’s protection and\r\nempowerment that will remain in the region even after\r\ninternational assistance has been withdrawn. The centre\r\nhas expanded its activities to all post-conflict areas of\r\nSouth-Eastern Europe and outside the region. In close\r\ncooperation with Slovenia, Austria and Jordan, the\r\ncentre and its other partners have already initiated\r\nvarious rehabilitation programmes for Iraq.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to express our\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his report\r\n(A/58/333), which identifies many positive results that\r\nhave already been achieved. Yet there is still much to\r\nbe done to fully implement the provisions of “A world\r\nfit for children”, so let us demonstrate the necessary\r\npolitical will and commitment in that respect. Finally,\r\nour gratitude goes to UNICEF and its marvellous staff\r\nwho are working in the field to make our words and “A\r\nworld fit for children” a reality.\r\nMs. Bethel (Bahamas): A little over a year ago,\r\nworld leaders gathered in New York to reaffirm their\r\ncommitment to building a world truly fit for children.\r\nThe twenty-seventh special session of the General\r\nAssembly was notable not only for the levels of\r\npolitical will manifested and the adoption of a set of\r\ntime-bound goals to improve the state of the world’s\r\nchildren, but also for the participation of children\r\nthemselves, for the first time, in the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Their presence in New York\r\nreminded us of the importance of the task at hand, and\r\nthe impact of their attendance should stay with us as\r\nwe examine the measures that we have already\r\nundertaken and those that remain as we commit\r\nourselves to building a world fit for them and\r\nsucceeding generations.\r\nMy delegation thanks the Secretary-General for\r\npresenting the comprehensive report we have before us.\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nThe report shows that there have been mixed results\r\nthus far in implementing the Declaration and Plan of\r\nAction adopted at the special session, and that,\r\nunfortunately, there has been a lack of consistent and\r\nsystematic follow-up to this point. My delegation trusts\r\nthat our consideration of this item at this session will\r\nprovide a new impetus to the critical follow-up\r\nprocess.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report offers a timely\r\nreminder that all of the actions undertaken by the\r\ninternational community ultimately have an impact on\r\nthe world’s children. Accordingly, the commitments we\r\nundertook at the major conferences and summits of the\r\n1990s and in more recent times are about children,\r\nwhether we realized it at the time or not. The outcomes\r\nof the World Summit for Social Development and its\r\nfive-year review; the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen and its five-year review; the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development; and the\r\nWorld Summit for Sustainable Development have\r\ncommitted us to a series of actions that will truly test\r\nour commitment to creating social and economic\r\ndevelopment, eradicating poverty, preventing\r\nenvironmental degradation, and ultimately preserving\r\nour world for future generations. These commitments\r\nare perhaps best captured in the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, and we call on all States to\r\nreaffirm their commitment to implementing these\r\nGoals.\r\nIn that context, my delegation wishes to reiterate\r\nthe importance of international cooperation and\r\nassistance in meeting these Goals. We have set\r\nourselves a truly ambitious agenda, which no State can\r\nachieve alone. Accordingly, resource mobilization at\r\nthe national and particularly the international level,\r\nthrough official development assistance, debt relief and\r\ninternational assistance, is critical to ensuring that all\r\nStates are able to meet their obligations, particularly\r\nthose that affect the daily lives and future of the\r\nworld’s children.\r\nThe Bahamas is a young nation, both in terms of\r\nits political independence and in terms of its\r\npopulation. According to the most recent national\r\ncensus, 35 per cent of the population is under the age\r\nof 18. Thus it is an imperative that actions be\r\nundertaken to safeguard the well- being of that segment\r\nof our population. We recognize that our future\r\ndevelopment and prosperity depend on our children,\r\nand it is with this reality in mind that the Bahamas\r\nGovernment has sought to translate its commitment to\r\nchildren into a series of significant national actions.\r\nAs an archipelagic State, the Bahamas faces\r\npeculiar difficulties in the delivery of social and other\r\nservices to the populations of each of its 22 inhabited\r\nislands. Notwithstanding those difficulties, however,\r\nthe Government of the Bahamas has committed itself to\r\nproviding social and other services to the entire\r\npopulation of the country — a commitment that has\r\nnecessitated duplication of infrastructure in each of the\r\nislands and the allocation of scarce resources in this\r\nregard.\r\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child\r\nremains the overarching framework for the Bahamas as\r\nit seeks to safeguard the well-being of the nation’s\r\nchildren and to meet its obligations in each of the\r\ndesignated areas of promoting healthy lives; providing\r\nquality education; protecting children against abuse,\r\nexploitation and violence; and combating HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe Bahamas recognizes that the health of a\r\nnation is the wealth of a nation, and that, without a\r\nhealthy population, no development and progress can\r\nbe achieved. Accordingly, the Government of the\r\nBahamas has devoted considerable resources to\r\nproviding universal access to health care in each of our\r\nislands. We are pleased that we have been able to\r\nsecure a dramatic reduction in infant mortality rates\r\nover the last decade, and the Ministry of Health is\r\nworking, in partnership with other Government\r\nagencies, to continue to reduce those rates.\r\nConsiderable focus has also been placed on the\r\nimportance of immunization in halting the spread of\r\npreventable childhood diseases. Accordingly,\r\nimmunization rates stand at 90 per cent for children\r\nunder the age of five, and efforts are continuing to\r\nincrease this figure.\r\nEqual emphasis is placed on the importance of\r\neducating our children, to enable them to take their\r\nplaces as productive members of society and to\r\ncontribute to the development of the nation.\r\nAccordingly, the Government of the Bahamas devotes\r\nthe single largest share of the national budget to\r\nproviding universal access to education for all up to the\r\nage of 16. Free primary and secondary education is\r\navailable to all Bahamians on a non-discriminatory\r\nbasis. The Government has also provided free pre-\r\nschool education at many of its public schools. The\r\nBahamas seeks to provide a well-rounded quality\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\neducation, including technical and vocational training\r\nand access to information technology, to its children, to\r\nprovide the best possible start for our young people and\r\nto provide them with the tools they need to make their\r\nway in the world.\r\nThe sad reality of violence against, and abuse and\r\nexploitation of, children is one that none of us in the\r\ninternational community has been able fully to prevent.\r\nThe Bahamas is, however, fully committed to\r\neradicating any practices that would harm our children\r\nand prevent them from enjoying their full human\r\nrights. The Bahamas has a legislative framework in\r\nplace that seeks to protect children, augmented by the\r\nwork of Government agencies with a mandate to\r\ninvestigate instances of abuse and violence, and to\r\nintervene when necessary.\r\nThe Government is constantly reviewing that\r\nframework in an effort to ensure that the nation’s\r\nchildren are not vulnerable to those that would seek to\r\ndo them harm and to meet its international obligations\r\nin this regard. When we put our children at risk, we put\r\nour future at risk, and we will take every step necessary\r\nto ensure that this does not happen.\r\nAs is well known, the HIV/AIDS pandemic has\r\nravaged the world and threatens the development\r\nprospects of many nations. The Caribbean region is the\r\nsecond-worst-affected region in the world, and the\r\nBahamas has not been exempted from this. The\r\nBahamas Government has waged an intensive\r\ncampaign against the pandemic, through the provision\r\nof care, treatment and prevention programmes, coupled\r\nwith awareness-raising and education activities.\r\nChildren are perhaps the most innocent victims of\r\nthis disease, and the Bahamas has sought to limit its\r\nimpact on our children. Accordingly, the Bahamas has\r\nsought to increase access to antiretroviral drugs,\r\nparticularly for HIV-positive pregnant women, and has\r\nrecorded a reduction in the rate of mother-to-child\r\ntransmission to 3 per cent in 2002. The Bahamas has\r\nalso taken action with respect to the increasing\r\nnumbers of HIV orphans. While we cherish the\r\nextended family that continues to characterize our\r\nnation, the Government has also taken steps to\r\nintervene where that extended family cannot, to\r\nprovide care and support for these children. Our\r\ncommitment to combating HIV/AIDS, and particularly\r\nits impact on children, will not wane.\r\nWhile national action will ultimately prove the\r\nmost effective in protecting the world’s children and in\r\nsafeguarding their well-being, my delegation also\r\nwishes to stress the importance of regional and\r\ninternational action. In that context, my delegation\r\nwishes to pay tribute to the work of the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) and of other specialized\r\nagencies in the United Nations system for the sterling\r\nwork they have undertaken in pursuit of the goals\r\ncontained in “A world fit for children”. We look\r\nforward to continuing to work in fruitful partnership\r\nwith those agencies in that regard.\r\nThe view has been expressed in some quarters\r\nthat the United Nations has become nothing more than\r\na talk shop from which concrete action rarely\r\nemanates. In fulfilling our obligations to the world’s\r\nchildren, let us put the lie to this assertion. The world’s\r\nfuture depends on the actions we take today to\r\nsafeguard the welfare and well-being of our children.\r\nLet us not fail them, and ourselves, and reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to building a world that is truly fit for\r\nchildren.\r\nMs. Ognjanovac (Croatia): The twenty-seventh\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly, on children,\r\nreaffirmed our strong commitment to building a world\r\nfit for children. By adopting its outcome documents we\r\ncommitted ourselves to finishing the agenda of the\r\n1990 World Summit for Children and to achieving the\r\ngoals and objectives for the better protection of\r\nchildren’s rights set out in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nMuch has been done since then and good progress has\r\nbeen achieved, but as the Secretary-General rightly\r\nstated in his report on the follow-up to the United\r\nNations special session on children (A/58/333), the real\r\nwork has just started.\r\nIn this light, my delegation would like to\r\nemphasize that strong international cooperation and\r\neffective implementation of international legal\r\nstandards for the protection of the well-being of\r\nchildren by each and every State is a sine qua non\r\ntowards full promotion and protection of the rights of\r\nchildren.\r\nAs a party to the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild and its two Optional Protocols; the International\r\nLabour Organization Worst Forms of Child Labour\r\nConvention and the United Nations Convention against\r\nTransnational Organized Crime and its two\r\nsupplementing Protocols, Croatia attaches great\r\n29\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nimportance to the protection of children’s rights and\r\ncalls upon the States that have not yet ratified those\r\ninstruments to do so.\r\nIn an effort to ensure full implementation of the\r\nDeclaration and Plan of Action of the twenty-seventh\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on children,\r\nmy Government has undertaken various initiatives\r\naimed at further strengthening children’s human rights.\r\nIn July 2003 the Croatian Government adopted a\r\nrevised National Programme of Action for children,\r\ncontaining, inter alia, a chapter on priority activities for\r\nthe well-being of children for the period 2003-2005.\r\nThe principles and priorities outlined in this chapter\r\nwere drawn up from the agreed international time-\r\nbound goals and translated into practice, taking into\r\naccount the specific needs of children at the local and\r\nnational levels. National non-governmental\r\norganizations and children and young people were\r\ninvolved in the process of developing the programme,\r\nas well as in its implementation.\r\nNational mechanisms for the protection and\r\npromotion of children’s rights have been further\r\nstrengthened by the adoption of a children’s\r\nombudsman’s law and the consequent appointment of\r\nan ombudsman. An Ombudsman’s office was\r\nestablished as an autonomous and non-partisan\r\ninstitution that will monitor the implementation of the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child and other\r\ninternational instruments ratified by the Republic of\r\nCroatia in the field of children’s rights.\r\nThe office will also coordinate the work of\r\neveryone involved in the protection of children’s rights,\r\nincluding those who are responsible for the protection\r\nof children against all forms of violence. In addition,\r\nthe office will inform the public of the situation of\r\nchildren’s rights, promote and protect, inter alia, the\r\nrights of children with special needs and consider\r\nrequests related to the protection of children’s rights\r\nand interests put forward by any institution or\r\nindividual.\r\nIn Croatia, special attention has been devoted to,\r\nand child rights issues were incorporated in other\r\npolicies created to enhance the human rights of some of\r\nthe most vulnerable members of society. For example,\r\nthe National Family Policy adopted by the Government\r\nin January 2003 proposes measures for the promotion\r\nof health care for children, especially measures for the\r\nprotection of infants. It also puts forward measures for\r\nthe improvement of health care for women, particularly\r\nduring pregnancy and child birth, preventive activities\r\nfocused on maintaining and improving the health of\r\ngirls and educational programmes for medical\r\npersonnel working in the field of family health care.\r\nThe National Plan for the Suppression of\r\nTrafficking in Persons, that is being implemented\r\nsuccessfully, envisages measures for the creation of an\r\nadequate legislative framework for instituting\r\nproceedings and providing for sanctions against\r\nperpetrators who provide assistance and protection to\r\ntrafficked persons, especially women and children who\r\nare victims of trafficking, as well as measures aimed at\r\nthe prevention of trafficking in human beings.\r\nTo ensure better legal protection for the victims\r\nof domestic violence, regardless of their age and sex,\r\nthe Croatian Parliament earlier this year adopted a Law\r\non the Protection against Domestic Violence. The Law\r\ndefines actions that qualify as domestic violence,\r\nstipulates various legal sanctions for perpetrators and\r\nprovides protective measures against the perpetrator,\r\nsuch as obligatory psycho-therapeutic and psychiatric\r\ntreatment when necessary, issuing restraining orders,\r\nprohibiting harassment or stalking of a person or\r\nexposing a person to violence, as well as a measure\r\nmandating immediate eviction of a violent member\r\nfrom a family household.\r\nThe Penal Code of the Republic of Croatia\r\ncontains key laws covering the area of violence against\r\nchildren, in particular sexual violence. In its chapter\r\nVI, the law defines criminal acts against family and\r\nyouth and provides sanctions against those committing\r\nvarious acts that are harmful to children and minors.\r\nAlthough significant progress has been made in\r\nCroatia in the area of the promotion and protection of\r\nthe rights of the child, the Croatian Government\r\nremains committed to working further to create a child-\r\nfriendly environment and supports every initiative that\r\neffectively contributes to the full achievement of\r\ninternational legal standards for the protection of the\r\nwell-being of children and to the realization of the\r\nDeclaration and Plan of Action of the twenty-seventh\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on children.\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syria) (spoke in Arabic): The issue\r\nof the rights of children occupies a special place of\r\ninterest and importance to the Syrian Government. This\r\ncan be seen through carefully implemented national\r\nplans that have been followed up by the highest\r\n30\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\npolitical authority in Syria. The President of the\r\nRepublic has personally given this issue a great deal of\r\nattention and has followed up on the projects and\r\nactivities that provide services to children, either in the\r\ncountryside or in the cities. In this vein, a higher\r\nCommittee for Children was established in 1999, in\r\nwhich all Governmental and non-governmental\r\norganizations participate in following up on all issues\r\nconcerning children, including the implementation of\r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by\r\nSyria in 1993, and the implementation of the twenty-\r\nseventh special session of the General Assembly on\r\nchildren, held in 2002.\r\nOn the regional level, Syria effectively\r\nparticipates in all Arab conferences concerning issues\r\nrelating to children. An Arab plan of action on children\r\nwill be adopted at a high-level conference that will be\r\nheld early next year. At the international level, Syria\r\nthis year joined the Optional Protocols to the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, which deal with\r\nthe Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and the\r\nSale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child\r\nPornography.\r\nSyria also acceded in 2001 to the International\r\nLabour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 138\r\nconcerning Minimum Age for Admission to\r\nEmployment. The minimum age for employment in\r\nSyria has been raised to 15 years of age. Moreover,\r\nSyria acceded to ILO Convention No. 182 concerning\r\nthe Prohibition and Immediate Action for the\r\nElimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour. It also\r\ncooperates with many international agencies in\r\ncombating child labour, including the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF).\r\nSyria submitted its periodic national report this\r\nsummer after its accession to the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child and it will carefully consider all the\r\nrecommendations made by the Committee on the\r\nRights of the Child. After discussion of the report, the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva\r\ndecided, in cooperation with the Syrian Government, to\r\nhold a workshop in Damascus from 22 to 24 October\r\n2003 to discuss all issues regarding children and to\r\nshed light on the achievements of the Government in\r\nthat regard. Syria takes pride in its achievements so far\r\nwith regard to implementation of the objectives of the\r\nWorld Summit for Children of 1990, particularly in\r\neducation and health care, and following-up the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the special session\r\nof the General Assembly on children in 2002.\r\nGiven the shortage of time, we would like to\r\nmention just a few of these achievements. Our national\r\nhealth strategy relies on expanding the sphere of\r\nprimary health care to reach the countryside and to\r\nachieve equality between urban and rural areas. Health\r\ncare and compulsory education are available to all\r\ncitizens free of charge. Females comprise 48 per cent\r\nof all students in pre-college levels. In the education\r\nsector, the Ministry of Education is working on\r\ndeveloping a curriculum for students that will\r\nintroduce the concept of the rights of children.\r\nThe “Healthy Village” programme in Syria is a\r\npioneer programme that considers the well-being of the\r\nhuman being a development objective and a means to\r\nimprove the quality of life of citizens. The programme\r\npays great attention to the development of the child and\r\nthe enablement of women and to improving the\r\nenvironment and the workplace in order to increase the\r\nincome of all sectors of society. Many international and\r\nnon-governmental organizations contribute actively to\r\nthat programme.\r\nDespite these achievements, the Syrian\r\nGovernment cannot reach all children in Syria, since\r\nthousands of those children have been living under\r\nIsraeli occupation in the Syrian Golan since 1967.\r\nThose children suffer from the daily coercive actions of\r\nthe occupying forces; for example, the closure of\r\neducational institutions, the prohibition of Syrian\r\nbooks and curricula, and the imposition of Israeli\r\ncurricula and Israeli citizenship in an attempt to erase\r\nthe national identity of the younger generation. Also,\r\nwe must not forget to mention the thousands of\r\nfamilies that have been displaced and whose property\r\nhas been confiscated since the Israeli occupation of the\r\nSyrian Golan.\r\nMy delegation has carefully reviewed the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on the follow-up to the\r\noutcome of the special session of the General\r\nAssembly on children and we express our appreciation\r\nof the efforts made in the preparation of such an\r\nimportant document. It is the first report to describe the\r\nprogress achieved at both the regional and global levels\r\nin the follow-up to the special session on children, and\r\nin particular the measures taken in the implementation\r\nof the four main objectives of the Plan of Action\r\nentitled “A world fit for children”. We would like to\r\n31\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nstate that the next report on the issue should be a little\r\nmore detailed, particularly when addressing the issues\r\nof protecting children from violence, abuse and\r\nexploitation, in particular children in armed conflict\r\nand under foreign occupation. The final outcome of the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on children\r\nspecifically mentioned such children. Children in the\r\noccupied Palestinian territories suffer daily at the hands\r\nof Israel owing to the continued repressive measures of\r\nthe Israeli occupation forces, which the entire world\r\ncan see on television screens everyday. The\r\ninternational community must put an end to all\r\npractices that violate the rights of children.\r\nWe would also like to stress the importance of\r\nparagraph 74 of the report concerning the study being\r\nprepared on violence against children. We believe that\r\nthis study should be more factual when describing the\r\nviolence that children are exposed to during armed\r\nconflict and under foreign occupation, so that the\r\nreport will be more reliable and more objective. We\r\nlook forward to progress in this study.\r\nFinally, we would like to stress the importance of\r\naddressing children’s issues without selectivity or\r\ndouble standards, if we are to prepare a sound\r\ngeneration for the future. Human beings are both a goal\r\nand a means of development, and as such should be\r\npart and parcel of the social development process.\r\nIn spite of all the achievements of the past decade\r\nin the field of caring for children, we stress that there is\r\nneed for more work and intensified efforts to attain a\r\nbetter standard of living for all children. We believe\r\nthat we have a strong foundation to go forward towards\r\nreaching our objectives as embodied in the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child and the outcome of the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s special session on children.\r\nMr. Requeijo Gual (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nDuring the 1990 World Summit for Children and the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on children in\r\n2002, many commitments were made to improve the\r\nstandard of living of all children throughout the world,\r\nto increase their chances for and materials necessary\r\nfor survival, to improve health and sanitation services,\r\nto combat curable diseases and reduce their spread,\r\ncreate new opportunities for education, increase\r\navailable food and keep children out of danger.\r\nHowever, for most of the children in the world,\r\nthese commitments will never become a reality. We\r\ncannot share the enthusiasm in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport. How can we share it when, as this report and\r\nother United Nations reports indicate, 3.1 million\r\nHIV/AIDS victims are under 15 years of age; only 1\r\nper cent of persons affected by HIV/AIDS in Africa\r\nhave access to retroviral medication and some 6,000\r\nyoung people between 15-24 years of age are infected\r\nby this terrible disease each day? How can we be\r\noptimistic when 250 million children must work in\r\norder to survive, and almost 180 million must take up\r\nthe worst forms of child labour; when 1.2 million\r\nchildren are enslaved each year and some other 2\r\nmillion are exploited by prostitution and pornography;\r\nand approximately 40 million children suffer from\r\nmistreatment and abandonment? How can we refer to\r\nsuccessful plans when 500 million children still live in\r\nextreme poverty; 100 million are not in school and\r\nmany more receive inadequate education; some 150\r\nmillion children in the developing world are\r\nmalnourished and 11 million children under 5 years of\r\nage die each year from preventable diseases? The\r\npreparation of national plans of action, the\r\nharmonization of laws and policies, proper national\r\nmanagement of public affairs and implementation of\r\nprogrammes on children are still insufficient for there\r\nto be a world fit for children, in which the children of\r\nsome four-fifths of humanity could enjoy a proper life.\r\nWhat chances for success can these policies or\r\ndomestic activities have, when developing countries\r\nare witnessing a decrease in the amount of official\r\ndevelopment aid they receive and are losing\r\napproximately $100 billion dollars that had been\r\npledged by the industrialized countries? What kind of\r\nmaterial support can national activities of the third-\r\nworld countries receive when their most competitive\r\nexport products cannot enter the markets of the\r\ndeveloped countries because of the protectionist\r\nmeasures the developed countries impose, including\r\nfarm subsidies at an amount of more than $300 billion\r\ndollars?\r\nWhat conditions exist for developing countries to\r\npursue their own plans when the already precarious\r\ninvestment flows to those countries continue to\r\ndecrease; when they are net exporters of capital; when\r\nthey are impeded from accessing advanced\r\ntechnologies; and when they continue to expend $350\r\nbillion annually — which represents approximately 20\r\nper cent of their exports — solely to pay for a foreign\r\ndebt servicing that UNICEF once said had the face of a\r\nchild?\r\n32\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nWithout the adoption by industrialized countries\r\nof a philosophy based on solidarity that makes it\r\npossible for them to meet their international\r\ncooperation commitments, the efforts of developing\r\ncountries will be useless in solving the serious\r\nproblems of childhood. Likewise, in order to address\r\nthose problems one must effectively implement the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, the governing\r\ninternational instrument in the promotion of the rights\r\nof the child, which provides an indispensable\r\nframework to confront those challenges. Similarly, we\r\nmust work with the two Optional Protocols to the\r\nConvention — one on the sale of children, child\r\nprostitution and child pornography, which my country\r\nhas already ratified, and the other on the involvement\r\nof children in armed conflict, which Cuba has signed\r\nand is currently evaluating with a view to its\r\nratification.\r\nWith regard to the need to promote an\r\ninternational climate of peace, it is unfortunate that\r\ndeveloping countries — and especially the most\r\npowerful nations — are doing little to address or solve\r\nthe main causes of armed conflicts and other conflicts\r\nstemming from the vestiges of colonialism, widespread\r\npoverty, increasing inequalities within and outside\r\ncountries, social and political crises, the manipulation\r\nof ethnic, cultural and religious differences, and\r\nforeign occupation and domination.\r\nFor over four decades, Cuba has been subjected\r\nto an iron-fisted, economic, commercial and financial\r\nblockade. That blockade has been tightened in the past\r\nyear, and its extra-territorial application has been\r\nexpanded. That has created serious impediments to\r\naccess to educational materials and to the acquisition of\r\ntechnologies, raw materials, reagents, diagnostic\r\ninstruments and necessary medical equipment and\r\nmedication, including vital medicines necessary to\r\nensure the survival of children with cancer.\r\nAs part of its hostile policy against Cuba, the\r\ncountry blockading us is also attempting to place us on\r\na list of violating countries and to impose illegal\r\nsanctions against us on the basis of Cuba’s supposed\r\nsupport for the trafficking in women and children. That\r\ncountry, which has no moral authority to refer to Cuba,\r\nhas 400,000 children involved in prostitution and is\r\nhost to the trafficking of 50,000 women and girls\r\nannually, mostly for the purposes of prostitution. Those\r\nbaseless accusations are politically motivated and are\r\nan attempt to tarnish the results achieved by Cuba with\r\nregard to women and children, which have been\r\ninternationally recognized as exemplary achievements.\r\nCuba has made remarkable progress in caring for\r\nchildren, despite its scarce resources and the fact that it\r\nis a country affected by a genocidal blockade. Cuba’s\r\ncomprehensive policy for the development of children\r\nis based on social assistance programmes that are\r\npremised on equality of opportunity and social justice\r\nwith regard to the distribution of resources and Cuba’s\r\ncomprehensive delivery of childhood services. That\r\npolicy has made it possible for Cuba to surpass every\r\nbenchmark and goal set by the 1990 and 2002 meetings\r\non children.\r\nThe mortality rate for children under one year of\r\nage in my country is 6.5 per 1,000 live births. One\r\nhundred per cent of our children are immunized against\r\n13 preventable diseases. One hundred per cent of\r\npregnant women receive obstetric care, and 99 per cent\r\nof births take place in hospitals. Every child and young\r\nperson has free access to a classroom and teacher.\r\nPrimary school enrolment is at 100 per cent, with a rate\r\nof 95 per cent at the secondary school level. There is\r\none teacher for every 42 inhabitants and 20 students\r\nper classroom in primary schools. We are working so\r\nthat very soon there will be no more than 15 students\r\nper classroom in secondary schools.\r\nIn order to improve and expand education, there\r\nare programmes under way to equip every instructional\r\ncentre with the computers necessary to provide\r\neducation. To date, 46,290 computers have been\r\ninstalled in schools at the pre-school, primary and\r\nsecondary levels, including in every rural school. Two\r\nthousand, three hundred and sixty-eight schools have\r\nbeen equipped with electric solar panels in order to\r\ntake advantage of computers, including at 93 schools\r\nwhere there is a single student. We have begun\r\ntransmission at a new educational television channel,\r\nand we will soon introduce a second channel for the\r\nsame purpose.\r\nUnless we make way for solidarity, end\r\nselfishness and put in place a more just, sustainable\r\nand equitable international economic order, it will be\r\nvery difficult for “A world fit for children” to become a\r\nreality for the majority of the world’s children.\r\nMr. Swe (Myanmar): At the outset, I wish to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his report (A/58/333),\r\nwhich has provided us with a sound basis for our\r\ndiscussion today.\r\n33\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nThe special session on children, which took place\r\nin May 2002, has done much to promote the cause of\r\nchildren. The outcome document adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly, entitled “A world fit for children”,\r\nprovides us with a platform to build upon in ensuring\r\nthat no child is left behind. The Secretary-General’s\r\nreport shows that the progress made to date represents\r\na good start, but that tremendous challenges lie ahead.\r\nThe Secretary-General also stressed in his report that\r\ninvesting effectively in children is a powerful force to\r\nachieve true sustainable development. We fully\r\nsubscribe to that view.\r\nMay I apprise the Assembly of my country’s\r\ninvestment in its most valuable resource, our children,\r\nby focusing on four main priorities that are\r\nincorporated in our national action plan.\r\nFirst, with regard to providing quality education\r\nfor all, the Government of Myanmar attaches great\r\nimportance to education, and is currently implementing\r\na 30-year, long-term national education promotion\r\nprogramme to ensure that all children of school-going\r\nage can attend school. The primary school enrolment\r\nrate for the 2002-2003 academic year was 93.07 per\r\ncent. Over 7.5 million students are currently enrolled in\r\nover 40,000 basic primary schools — which is to say,\r\nprimary- and secondary-level schools —throughout the\r\ncountry. Nearly 900,000 students are enrolled in the\r\ncountry’s 154 universities and colleges this year. The\r\nGovernment has allocated 39 billion kyats to the\r\nMinistry of Education for this academic year alone. E-\r\neducation, which was launched in Myanmar on 1\r\nJanuary 2001, is gathering momentum, and every year\r\nmore e-education learning centres, e-education\r\nresource centres and multi-media class rooms are being\r\nestablished at both the basic education level and at the\r\nuniversity and college levels.\r\nSecondly, with regard to promoting healthy lives,\r\nthe national plan of action is being implemented by the\r\nrelevant ministries, United Nations agencies and\r\nnational and international non-governmental\r\norganizations. As a result of the various programmes\r\nundertaken, there has been a marked drop in the infant\r\nmortality and the under-five mortality rates. The\r\nimmunization coverage of six major diseases for\r\ninfants under one year of age and vitamin A\r\nsupplementation for children under five years of age\r\nhave also increased significantly.\r\nThirdly, with regard to protecting children against\r\nabuse, exploitation and violence, Myanmar acceded to\r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991. In\r\norder to further promote the rights of children,\r\nMyanmar promulgated its child law in 1993. A series\r\nof national-level plans have been implemented to\r\nachieve the goals pertaining to the survival, protection\r\nand development of children. Those efforts are under\r\nthe supervision of the National Committee on the\r\nRights of the Child.\r\nChild affairs in Myanmar are under the purview\r\nof the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and\r\nResettlement. Apart from playing a coordinating role,\r\nthe Ministry’s Department of Social Welfare also\r\noperates early child care and development centres and\r\ncares for orphans and abandoned children at its 20\r\ntraining centres and 143 centres run by voluntary\r\norganizations. Rehabilitation programmes for\r\nabandoned and abused children and for juvenile\r\ndelinquents are also being carried out by the Social\r\nWelfare Department.\r\nThe Government of Myanmar has undertaken\r\neffective measures to combat the global phenomenon\r\nof human trafficking, particularly trafficking in women\r\nand children. Myanmar has put in place a national\r\naction plan for the prevention of trafficking in persons.\r\nThe action plan is comprehensive in nature and\r\nencompasses strategies aimed at prevention,\r\nenforcement and prosecution, protection and\r\nrepatriation, return and reintegration. Creating\r\nawareness through training programmes and the media\r\nare part of the preventive strategy. Effective\r\nenforcement measures are being carried out, and\r\nhuman traffickers are liable under the penal code of\r\nMyanmar. Jail sentences ranging from seven to 14\r\nyears have been meted out to offenders. Myanmar is\r\nnow in the process of enacting a separate anti-human-\r\ntrafficking law that will further serve as an effective\r\ndeterrent.\r\nLast but not least, with regard to combating\r\nHIV/AIDS, as part of its HIV/AIDS preventive\r\nstrategy, Myanmar is educating its future leaders, the\r\nchildren. Our School-based Healthy Life Skills\r\nHIV/AIDS Prevention Education Project (SHAPE) has\r\nbrought life-skills-based education on HIV/AIDS and\r\nsexually transmitted diseases (STD) to over 1 million\r\nschool children in Myanmar, ranging in ages from\r\nseven through 15. SHAPE has been integrated into the\r\nnational curriculum, and the project is been steadily\r\n34\r\nA/58/PV.39\r\nexpanded to cover all schools in the country. National\r\nand international non-governmental organizations\r\ncontinue to play an active role in HIV/AIDS prevention\r\nand care, conducting community-level peer-education\r\nprojects for young people and life-skills-based\r\nHIV/AIDS/STD training programmes. A new project in\r\nthat area was launched in May of this year. The 2003-\r\n2005 adolescent reproductive health awareness project,\r\nwhich is funded by the United Nations Population Fund\r\nin collaboration with international and local non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, was launched to improve\r\nreproductive health information, education and services\r\nfor young people.\r\nChildren’s rights are human rights, and my\r\ndelegation places special importance on promoting the\r\nrights of children everywhere. The recent Ministerial\r\nDeclaration of the Meeting of the Ministers for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Non-Aligned Movement, of which\r\nMyanmar is a founding member, reaffirmed the\r\nMovement’s\r\n“concern over the intolerable persistence of\r\nadverse social and economic conditions faced by\r\nchildren on account of poverty, use of children in\r\narmed conflict, including abduction of children\r\nfor training as child mercenaries and in terrorism,\r\nmass killing of children in communal and\r\nsectarian violence, child labour, particularly the\r\nworst forms of child labour, the continued\r\nexploitation and trafficking of children for\r\npornography, prostitution and drug trafficking,\r\nthe sale of children and their organs, the\r\nincreasing number of children affected by\r\nHIV/AIDS, as well as the suffering of refugee\r\nand displaced children especially in Africa.\r\nUrgent steps, including through international co-\r\noperation, must be undertaken to address these\r\nproblems.” (A/58/420, annex, para. 45)\r\nMyanmar fully shares those concerns.\r\nThe Foreign Ministers also reaffirmed the Non-\r\nAligned Movement’s long-standing and principled\r\nposition that all human rights are universal, inalienable,\r\nindivisible, interdependent and interrelated. The\r\nForeign Ministers also stressed “the importance of\r\naddressing the international human rights agenda in a\r\nfair and balanced manner” (ibid, para. 41). They also\r\nexpressed their concern\r\n“over the continued exploitation of human rights\r\nfor political purposes, including selective\r\ntargeting of individual countries for extraneous\r\nconsiderations, which are detrimental to the\r\npromotion and protection of all human rights for\r\nall.” (supra)\r\nChildren are our future and our most valuable\r\ninvestment. It is particularly important to stress that\r\npoliticizing this issue, which we all hold most dear,\r\nwould be a disservice to the cause of children.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate that Myanmar\r\nwill continue its serious efforts to achieve the goals set\r\nout by the special session on children to create a world\r\nfit for children.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I would like to make an\r\nannouncement regarding some changes to the\r\nprogramme of work of the General Assembly contained\r\nin document A/INF/58/4/Rev.l.\r\nOn Friday, 31 October 2003, in the morning, the\r\nGeneral Assembly will consider as the second item\r\nagenda item 108, “Crime prevention and criminal\r\njustice”, in order to take action on the draft United\r\nNations Convention against Corruption, recommended\r\nby the Ad Hoc Committee for the Negotiation of a\r\nConvention against Corruption in a report to be\r\ncirculated as document A/58/422.\r\nOn Monday, 3 November 2003, the General\r\nAssembly will consider as the first item agenda item\r\n23, “Sport for peace and development”, and its sub-\r\nitems (a) and (b) in the morning rather than in the\r\nafternoon. After the adjournment of the morning\r\nmeeting, the President of the International Olympic\r\nCommittee will make a statement at an informal\r\nsegment.\r\nOn Monday, 17 November 2003, in the morning,\r\nthe General Assembly will take up agenda item 16 (a),\r\n“Election of forty-three members of the United Nations\r\nCommission on International Trade Law”.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.50 p.m.\r\n"
