Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. van den Berg\r\n(Netherlands), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 41 (continued)\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the special session on\r\nchildren\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/333)\r\nMs. Kang Kyung-wha (Republic of Korea): My\r\ndelegation welcomes this opportunity to review the\r\nfollow-up to the General Assembly’s special session on\r\nchildren, which was held from 8 to 10 May last year.\r\nNo issue is more relevant to the present and future\r\nwell-being of our world than that of children. Indeed,\r\n“A world fit for children”, as the outcome document of\r\nthe special session is called, would be a world best fit\r\nfor all. Progress towards the major goals identified in\r\nthe document will be a major contribution to achieving\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. The Republic of\r\nKorea is resolved to fully realizing those goals.\r\nIn the Republic of Korea the special session and\r\nthe preparations leading up to it served to further\r\nconsolidate the reorientation in policy-thinking on\r\nchildren. In the past, the focus had been on support for\r\nchildren in need. However, the revision of our child\r\nwelfare act in 2000 marked a shift towards children’s\r\nrights in general. The shift was further institutionalized\r\nwith the formulation of the comprehensive plan for\r\nchild protection and rearing, which was published on 5\r\nMay 2002 — Children’s Day — on the eve of the\r\nspecial session.\r\nThe comprehensive plan incorporates the\r\nelements of “A world fit for children” that are most\r\npertinent to areas requiring further improvement in the\r\nRepublic of Korea and is organized in a way that will\r\nmost effectively build upon the achievements attained\r\nthus far. The plan covers 48 measures in five areas:\r\nenhancing children’s rights; improving the health and\r\nwelfare of children; strengthening children’s safety;\r\nprotecting children from harmful environments; and\r\nsupporting the sound rearing of children. To oversee\r\nthe implementation of the plan, the Committee for\r\nChild Protection and Rearing, which is composed of 13\r\nvice-ministerial-level officials from the relevant\r\nministries and offices, has been established to devise\r\nannual programmes for the implementation of the plan\r\nand to undertake regular reviews of achievements.\r\nAmong the 48 measures, of particular note for its\r\ncross-cutting implications for future policy-making is\r\nthe development of the children’s rights index. As\r\ncalled for in “A world fit for children” and further\r\nemphasized in the Bali Consensus — the outcome of\r\nthe sixth East Asia and the Pacific Ministerial\r\nConsultation on Children — pertinent data is crucial to\r\ndevising effective policies. My Government has\r\ntherefore commissioned the Institute for Health and\r\nSocial Affairs to develop a children’s rights index. The\r\nexisting system of data collection has lacked a unified\r\ncategorization of age groups for children, and is\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\ntherefore insufficient to cover all children and all areas\r\nunder the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The\r\nnew index should lead to vast improvements in the\r\ncollection of data pertaining to children. It will serve as\r\nthe basis of a white paper on children’s rights, to be\r\npublished every five years, beginning in 2005.\r\nOf the four major goal areas elaborated in “A\r\nworld fit for children”, I wish to focus on education,\r\nwhich was also identified in the Bali Consensus as an\r\noverarching imperative in fulfilling the commitments\r\nmade with regard to children.\r\nEducation has always been given the highest\r\npriority in the Republic of Korea, and educated citizens\r\nhave led the drive behind the country’s economic\r\ndevelopment and democratic growth. The opportunities\r\nfor children are already wide and still expanding.\r\nCurrently, boys and girls are equally entitled to nine\r\nyears of compulsory education. Most children advance\r\nto high school. There is little gender disparity in\r\nprimary and secondary education. As of 2001, 67.6 per\r\ncent of girls and 73.1 per cent of boys advanced to\r\ncollege upon graduation from high school.\r\nThe Government’s current focus is on achieving\r\ngender equality and eliminating gender discrimination\r\nin the content of education. A gender-equal curriculum\r\nfor primary and secondary education has been worked\r\nout. Training programmes for teachers based on gender\r\nequality are also being strengthened. The Republic of\r\nKorea is fully committed to fostering gender equality\r\nin and through education, and will continue its efforts\r\nin that regard.\r\nFurthermore, we believe that the empowerment of\r\nwomen is crucial in the promotion of the rights and\r\nwell-being of children. Measures to empower women\r\nsuch as strengthened maternity protection and child\r\ncare outside the home have a direct bearing on the\r\nhealthy growth of children. The Ministry of Gender\r\nEquality, which was established in 2001, is therefore\r\nworking closely with the Ministry of Public Health and\r\nWelfare and other relevant offices to devise policies\r\nthat optimize the benefits to both women and children.\r\nAnother focus to improve the education sector is\r\non children with disabilities. Measures in that area are\r\nan important part of the national programme for the\r\npromotion of the welfare of the disabled, which was\r\nestablished in 1998. Currently, the second phase of the\r\nprogramme, for the period 2003-2007, includes\r\nmeasures to provide quality education for disabled\r\nchildren suitable for the knowledge-based information\r\nage, to expand model schools for inclusive education,\r\nto improve support centres for disabled children and to\r\nprovide textbooks suited to the needs of children with\r\nvisual impairments.\r\nWhile promoting the goals of “A world fit for\r\nchildren” at home, the Republic of Korea has also been\r\nan active participant in regional and global initiatives\r\non children. The Asia-Europe Meeting’s (ASEM)\r\nAction on Child Welfare and the ASEM Initiative to\r\nCombat Trafficking in Women and Children are just\r\nsome of the recent forums through which we have\r\nshared our experiences and policies with others on the\r\npending issues related to children.\r\nThe official development aid programmes of the\r\nRepublic of Korea have also incorporated projects for\r\nchildren in the East Asia and Pacific regions, including\r\nthe construction of primary schools and hospitals, the\r\npromotion of children’s health projects and the\r\ndispatch of medical specialists in paediatrics and\r\nobstetrics. We hope that those efforts will contribute to\r\nthe enhancement of the well-being of children and to\r\nthe achievement of the goals of “A world fit for\r\nchildren” in the region.\r\nFinally, the Republic of Korea is fully behind the\r\nefforts made by the United Nations on behalf of\r\nchildren. In particular, we applaud UNICEF’s\r\ndedication to helping the most vulnerable and needy\r\nchildren of the world, in collaboration with other\r\nUnited Nations bodies. We have supported its activities\r\nin the field with financial and material assistance. The\r\nsuccessful outcome of the special session was in no\r\nsmall measure due to the dedication of UNICEF acting\r\nas its secretariat. Likewise, the successful\r\nimplementation of “A world fit for children” calls for\r\nits continued active engagement in advocacy,\r\nhumanitarian intervention and development assistance\r\non behalf of children. In collaboration with other\r\nagencies of the United Nations and as a complement\r\nand support to the efforts of Member States, that\r\nengagement would provide the building blocks for the\r\nconstruction of a world fit for children.\r\nMr. Buffa (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation aligns itself with the statement made\r\nyesterday by the delegation of Peru on behalf of the\r\ncountries of the Rio Group.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Paraguay\r\nattaches priority to promoting and protecting the\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\nfundamental rights of children and adolescents,\r\nparticularly in conjunction with the set of objectives\r\nand targets agreed at the May 2002 special session of\r\nthe General Assembly on children. The outcome\r\ndocument of the session, “A world fit for children”\r\n(resolution S-27/2, annex), reaffirmed the international\r\ncommunity’s commitment to implementing the\r\nremaining programmes and tasks of the 1990 World\r\nSummit for Children.\r\nWe should note that the special session was the\r\nfirst time that delegations comprised children and\r\nadolescents as official members, more than 400 of\r\nwhom participated from more than 150 countries. The\r\nobjectives and targets specifically established in four\r\npriority spheres of action — promoting a healthy life;\r\naccess to quality education; the need to protect children\r\nand adolescents from maltreatment, exploitation and\r\nviolence; and combating HIV/AIDS — sought to\r\nstrengthen and provide new impetus to countries’\r\ncommitments to attaining the Millennium Development\r\nGoals by 2015 through the definition of essential and\r\nconcrete intermediate goals for 2010.\r\nWe should also seek to integrate international\r\nobjectives into national Government plans and policies.\r\nIn that connection, we have agreed to formulate or\r\nstrengthen, by the end of 2003, national and regional\r\nplans of action designed for children with the\r\nparticipation of civil society, including non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and children and\r\nadolescents, whose opinions should be taken into\r\naccount in all matters that affect them.\r\nIn that context, I wish to take this opportunity to\r\nannounce that Paraguay recently drafted and adopted\r\nthe national plan for children and adolescents, a five-\r\nyear short-term plan for 2003 to 2008, consistent with\r\nthe national childhood and adolescence policy\r\nformulated for a 10-year period, 2003 to 2013, which\r\nhas greater and longer-term objectives aimed at\r\ncomprehensive and substantive development of this\r\nmajority sector of society, which represents\r\napproximately 47 per cent of Paraguay’s population.\r\nSince the World Summit for Children, important\r\nprogress has been made in Paraguay with regard to the\r\nsystem for protecting and promoting the rights of\r\nchildren and adolescents. In that connection, the\r\nchildhood and adolescence code is the chief regulatory\r\nframework protecting children’s rights. It imposes a\r\ndoctrine of comprehensive protection and incorporates\r\nthe principle of the best interests of the child, in\r\nkeeping with the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild.\r\nIn the same way, Paraguay has ratified the\r\nprincipal instruments of the inter-American and global\r\nsystems for protecting and promoting children’s rights,\r\nincluding very recently the second Optional Protocol to\r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child, on the sale\r\nof children, child prostitution and child pornography.\r\nLikewise, the national secretariat of childhood and\r\nadolescence is promoting measures aimed at early\r\nratification of International Labour Organization\r\nConvention 138, concerning the minimum age for\r\nadmission to employment, which has already been\r\nendorsed by the Paraguayan Congress and is currently\r\nbefore the Chamber of Deputies.\r\nIn this field, there are favourable signs in\r\nParaguay. On the one hand, decentralized efforts and\r\nmechanisms for protection, promotion and\r\ndevelopment of all children and adolescents have\r\npassed their experimental stage and are now being\r\npermanently financed and assessed. I am referring to\r\nthe municipal childhood councils, which aim to protect\r\nchildren’s best interests and to implement public\r\npolicies at the local governmental level throughout the\r\nnational territory with the central administration’s\r\ndecentralized agencies, civil society organizations and\r\ncommunity organizations for children and adolescents.\r\nA concrete example of that is the commitment to\r\nimplement a programme to provide a glass of milk to\r\nevery child attending primary school. Currently, there\r\nis renewed effort in the central department responsible\r\nfor that programme, whose outreach is expected to be\r\n300,000 children.\r\nHowever, much remains to be done. In that\r\nconnection, we cannot fail to mention our great\r\nconcern about the number of children and adolescents\r\nwho still live on the streets in an urgent situation\r\nwithout access to a minimum education and who are\r\nsubject to all kinds of abuses and excesses. We are also\r\nconcerned about the high rates of school dropouts due\r\nto premature admission to employment and to the\r\npregnancies of school-age girls.\r\nIn the area of education, I should like to reaffirm\r\nParaguay’s firm commitment to strengthening\r\neducational reform, which not only aspires to tailor the\r\ncomprehensive training of children and adolescents to\r\ncurrent needs and challenges, but also seeks to\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\noptimize the educational system’s scarce resources.\r\nTherefore, mindful that education and comprehensive\r\ntraining of children and adolescents are essential for\r\ndevelopment and the enjoyment of human dignity, the\r\nGovernment of Paraguay proposes to increase its social\r\ncapital through innovative strategies that will reverse\r\nthe perverse cycle of poverty.\r\nMr. Chaimongkol (Thailand): My delegation\r\nwishes to thank the Secretary-General for his report on\r\nfollow-up to the United Nations special session on\r\nchildren (A/58/333), held in May 2002. We are pleased\r\nto learn that one year has passed with a good start in\r\nthe implementation of the Plan of Action contained in\r\nthe outcome document, entitled “A world fit for\r\nchildren” (resolution S-27/2, annex), adopted at the\r\nspecial session. Thailand reaffirms its commitment to\r\npursuing the four goal areas of the Plan of Action:\r\npromoting healthy lives; providing quality education;\r\nprotecting children against abuse, exploitation and\r\nviolence; and combating HIV/AIDS.\r\nThailand attaches high priority to protecting\r\nchildren against abuse, exploitation and violence. The\r\nThai Government has striven to prevent and suppress\r\nall forms of exploitation of children, particularly\r\ntrafficking in children. Apart from strengthening\r\nlegislative measures, the national policy and plan of\r\naction to prevent and suppress trafficking in women\r\nand children was adopted with an integrated and\r\ncomprehensive approach to addressing the problem,\r\nparticularly its root causes. Moreover, special attention\r\nhas been devoted to girls’ education. Education, both\r\nformal and non-formal, and vocational training have\r\nbeen provided to girls with a view to empowering\r\nthem.\r\nIt is to be noted that a consistent spirit of\r\npartnership among governmental and non-\r\ngovernmental sectors, including the private sector, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and civil society, has been\r\nforged to ensure that every effort is made to promote\r\nand protect children in Thailand.\r\nAs international cooperation is required in the\r\nprevention and eradication of trafficking in children,\r\nThailand has developed close cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations system and the Governments of\r\ncountries in the Greater Mekong subregion — namely\r\nCambodia, China, the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic and Myanmar — to step up cooperation in\r\ncombating trafficking in women and children in the\r\nregion. At a bilateral level, Thailand also concluded, in\r\nMay 2003, an agreement with Cambodia on the\r\nsuppression of trafficking in women and children and\r\non assistance to trafficked victims.\r\nAs mentioned in the report of the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Children\r\nand Armed Conflict, Thailand is pleased to facilitate\r\nconflict resolution by providing a venue for peace talks\r\nby the conflicting parties. We are particularly delighted\r\nthat the recent peace talks in Thailand have resulted in\r\nthe reaffirmation of the commitments undertaken by\r\nthe parties concerned to refrain from using children\r\nunder 18 years of age in combat and from recruiting\r\nthose under 17.\r\nMy delegation wishes to underline the importance\r\nof the universal nature of the Convention on the Rights\r\nof the Child, which now has 192 State parties. We also\r\nwelcome the increasing number of countries that have\r\nacceded to its optional protocols. As a party to the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child since 1992,\r\nThailand welcomes the enlargement of the Committee\r\non the Rights of the Child, which will further\r\nstrengthen the capacity of the Committee to fulfil more\r\neffectively its mandate.\r\nIn this connection, my delegation shares concerns\r\nabout the increasingly heavy workload and the backlog\r\nproblem faced by the Committee, which are currently\r\naffecting the Committee’s effectiveness in addressing\r\nglobal concerns on children-related issues. We\r\ntherefore wish to support the efforts of the Committee\r\nto improve its methods of work and its management in\r\norder to better deal with the challenges facing it. We\r\nshould not forget that the effectiveness of the\r\nCommittee is vital to achieving “A world fit for\r\nchildren”.\r\nMr. Dhakal (Nepal): At the outset, I wish to join\r\nprevious speakers in expressing my delegation’s\r\nsincere appreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive report (A/58/333) on the follow-up to\r\nthe United Nations special session on children.\r\nMy delegation also wishes to express its\r\nappreciation to the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General for Children in Armed Conflict for\r\nhis analytical report on the protection of children\r\naffected by armed conflict (A/58/328).\r\nHumanity is on a perennial quest for peace,\r\nprosperity and justice for all. Children must be at\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\ncentre stage of that quest, as they are the future of our\r\nsocieties. For them to become educated, healthy and\r\nproductive citizens, they must have the right to proper\r\neducation, adequate health facilities, and a conducive\r\neconomic and social environment.\r\nToday millions of children are victims of poverty,\r\nilliteracy, disease and armed conflict across the world.\r\nEleven million children still die every year, mostly of\r\npreventable or curable diseases. The HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic has been taking its toll on millions of\r\ninnocent children as well. Atrocities and brutality\r\nagainst children continue unabated in conflict areas.\r\nThis, indeed, must change. We have a set of\r\nglobal blueprints for action in place. The Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child sets out broad parameters for\r\na better environment for children. The Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and the Declaration on “A world\r\nfit for children” identify steps to change the world for\r\nand with children in a time-bound manner. The\r\nMonterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation reinforce these and other goals.\r\nWe need to pool our resources and energies to\r\nimplement those blueprints in order to protect the\r\nrights of children and to uplift their status in society.\r\nThe multidimensional nature of children’s problems\r\nrequires that we make coherent and concerted efforts at\r\nthe national, regional and international levels. Nepal\r\nexpresses its appreciation to the United Nations for its\r\nendeavours to build a common platform for action and\r\nto bring about much-needed coherence and\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe task before us is formidable. The goals of\r\nreducing poverty by half and of providing all children\r\nwith primary education by the year 2015, as well as\r\nother global agreed goals, are laudable, appropriate\r\nand, indeed, ambitious. Business as usual will not get\r\nus where we want to go. We must muster greater\r\npolitical will in order to accomplish our task and\r\nredouble our efforts to achieve those goals.\r\nNepal is fully committed to protecting the rights\r\nof children and to promoting their development. We\r\nhave become party to a number of international and\r\nregional human rights instruments, including the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child and\r\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions\r\nNo. 138, on Minimum Age for Admission to\r\nEmployment, and No. 182, on the Worst Forms of\r\nChild Labour. Nepal has already signed the two\r\nProtocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\r\nWe have also submitted our combined second and third\r\nperiodic reports, as stipulated by the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child.\r\nTo translate those commitments into improved\r\nstatus for children, Nepal has taken a number of\r\nlegislative, policy and administrative measures. The\r\n1990 Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal guarantees\r\nthe protection of the rights and interests of children and\r\nprohibits trafficking in human beings, slavery, serfdom\r\nor forced labour.\r\nThe Children’s Act of 1992 spells out the rights\r\nof children in accordance with the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child and prescribes measures to\r\nsafeguard them. The Child Labour — Prohibition and\r\nControl — Act of 1999 prohibits the employment of\r\nchildren under the age of 16. There are also several\r\nprovisions in the civil code to protect the interests of\r\nchildren.\r\nA strategic action plan has been formulated to\r\naddress problems in seven key sectors, including child\r\nbonded labour; child rag pickers; child porters; child\r\ndomestic workers; children in mines; children in the\r\ncarpet sector; and trafficking in girls and sexual or\r\nlabour exploitation. There is a special focus on\r\npromoting a healthy life; providing quality education;\r\nprotecting children against abuse, exploitation and\r\nviolence; and combating HIV/AIDS.\r\nA master plan has been prepared to eliminate the\r\nworst forms of child labour by 2007 and all forms of\r\nchild labour by 2010. The overriding objective of the\r\ncurrent tenth five-year plan is to reduce poverty\r\nthrough interventions in the education, health,\r\nsanitation and rural development sectors. The plan\r\naims to raise the literacy rate to 63 per cent and to\r\nincrease school enrolment substantially. Free primary\r\neducation for all, free textbooks for girl students at that\r\nlevel, as well as scholarships for Dalit and\r\ndisadvantaged children, are some of the key features of\r\nour strategy that have been in the process of\r\nimplementation in the education sector for some time\r\nnow.\r\nAn integrated health service that provides\r\nprimary health care, family planning services and\r\nimmunization was introduced in our country some time\r\nago. Immunization has reached more than 90 per cent\r\nof our country’s children. Emphasis has been placed on\r\nproviding safe drinking water and sanitation facilities.\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\nThose programmes are integral to our efforts to\r\nalleviate poverty and improve overall condition of\r\nchildren. As part of our overall strategy, a\r\ncomprehensive national plan of action on children is\r\nalso being implemented, with the assistance of\r\nUNICEF and other United Nations agencies.\r\nTo implement those programmes, Nepal\r\nestablished a Ministry of Women, Children and Social\r\nWelfare and other necessary institutional frameworks.\r\nThe Human Rights Commission, the Women’s\r\nCommission and juvenile benches in district courts\r\nhave been set up to protect children’s rights. A high-\r\nlevel central child-welfare board and district child-\r\nwelfare boards have been set up in all 75 districts to\r\npromote the rights of the child and to mobilize local\r\ncommunities and resources to address problems faced\r\nby children at the district level.\r\nHis Majesty’s Government has been working in\r\nclose cooperation with all stakeholders at home and\r\nabroad to make possible the implementation of various\r\ndevelopment programmes aimed at children. It has\r\nsought the full participation of non-governmental\r\norganizations and the private sector in those activities.\r\nAt the regional level, we signed the South Asian\r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)\r\nConvention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking\r\nin Women and Children for Prostitution and the\r\nSAARC Convention on Regional Arrangements for the\r\nPromotion of Child Welfare in South Asia at the\r\nEleventh Summit of the South Asian Association for\r\nRegional Cooperation, which was held in Kathmandu\r\nin January 2002. The Conventions will complement\r\nglobal and national efforts to create a world fit for\r\nchildren.\r\nDespite those efforts, poverty persists and\r\nchildren continue to suffer in Nepal. The Maoist\r\ninsurgency has further worsened the situation. The\r\nMaoists have been disrupting much-needed\r\ndevelopment activities, destroying infrastructure and\r\nrecruiting children as child soldiers. Nepal, a least\r\ndeveloped country, needs peace to be able to\r\nimplement the various programmes and activities\r\naimed at the protection of children’s rights and the\r\npromotion of development. The Government has been\r\nseeking to resolve the Maoist problem through\r\ndialogue, while at the same time taking measures to\r\nprotect lives and property from Maoist brutalities and\r\nto safeguard liberty and freedom from the insurgents’\r\nambition to destroy democracy.\r\nNepal needs additional financial and technical\r\ncooperation from its development partners to\r\nimplement various policies and programmes and to\r\nimprove the situation of children. Assistance is also\r\ncritical for quick-impact projects in the Maoist-affected\r\nareas to provide basic services to people. A recently\r\npublished report, which was also presented at the Joint\r\nExecutive Board meeting of UNICEF and the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), showed\r\nthat our resources and the present level of external\r\nassistance will be far from sufficient to meet the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nIn conclusion, as parents and elders it is our\r\nobligation to provide children with the basic necessities\r\nof life and with the opportunity for quality education,\r\nhealth services and a loving and caring environment.\r\nWe must not allow the momentum generated by the\r\nvarious conferences on those topics to falter.\r\nMrs. Ahmed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It is\r\nclear that the rights of the child have been at centre\r\nstage since the holding of the World Summit for\r\nChildren in 1990. Those rights are now a priority of\r\nGovernments, civil society organizations, scientists and\r\nresearchers who seek to foster the capabilities of\r\nchildren and meet their basic needs within a family\r\nproviding safety, well-being, education, morals and\r\nethics for a better future. Interest in the agenda for\r\nchildren has increased since the adoption and\r\nimplementation of the Plan of Action entitled “A world\r\nfit for children”, which will contribute to the well-\r\nbeing of children and to strengthening their rights.\r\nInternational cooperation has a very important\r\nrole to play in that regard, especially in connection\r\nwith providing support to developing countries as part\r\nof the implementation of the Convention on the Rights\r\nof the Child and as a practical and positive approach\r\naimed at overcoming obstacles and meeting agreed\r\ninternational financial commitments. There is,\r\ntherefore, a need to enhance the implementation of the\r\nPlan of Action and to reinvigorate political will at the\r\nnational and international levels.\r\nIf the present international situation continues, we\r\nshall see a widening of the gap between the rich and\r\nthe poor in every country. Poor countries will therefore\r\nnot be able to benefit from the positive aspects of\r\nglobalization, which will then lead to further\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\nmarginalization of developing countries, and in\r\nparticular the least developed countries. At the same\r\ntime that those countries are experiencing the effects of\r\nmalnutrition, malaria and HIV/AIDS — especially the\r\nones located in Africa — they must also contend with\r\nthe burden imposed by foreign debts and the servicing\r\nof those debts.\r\nMy delegation made a statement to the Third\r\nCommittee concerning the national efforts Sudan is\r\nmaking with regard to protecting the rights of children\r\nand promoting their well-being. In this connection, we\r\nwould like to express our gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report (A/58/333) on the follow-up to\r\nthe outcome of the special session on children. We\r\nwish to underscore the contents of that report\r\npertaining to the follow-up to major international\r\nconferences and other important summits that provided\r\na comprehensive plan of action for development,\r\nwhose primary objective is the elimination of poverty.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General also referred\r\nto cooperation between the African Union, the\r\nEconomic Commission for Africa and UNICEF in\r\ndrafting a comprehensive report on the situation of\r\nchildren in Africa. My delegation believes that that\r\nreport should serve to raise awareness of the situation\r\nof children in Africa, given that they represent the most\r\naffected and vulnerable segment of the population by\r\nvirtue of their exposure to such endemic diseases as\r\nmalaria and HIV/AIDS and the fact that their mortality\r\nrate is extremely high owing to malnutrition and armed\r\nconflict. My delegation therefore believes that all\r\nfactors affecting the lives, rights and prosperity of\r\nAfrican children must be taken into account in the\r\npreparation of the report.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General also\r\naddressed the issue of follow-up by some regional\r\norganizations. A comprehensive resolution in line with\r\nthe outcome document of the General Assembly’s\r\nspecial session on children and entitled “An Arab\r\nworld fit for children” was adopted at the Arab Summit\r\nheld in March 2002. The May 2002 meeting of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) also\r\nadopted a resolution on child care and protection in the\r\nIslamic world. That resolution refers to the Plan of\r\nAction as a reference for action by OIC members.\r\nMy delegation would like for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s future reports on follow-up to include a\r\ncomprehensive analytical review of the implementation\r\nof the Plan of Action at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels by focusing on the four primary\r\ngoals with a view to defining problems and challenges\r\nand making practical recommendations. My delegation\r\nattaches special importance to the study being prepared\r\nby the Secretary-General on violence against children,\r\nin keeping with the relevant resolution of the General\r\nAssembly. My delegation hopes that it will be inclusive\r\nof all the fundamental causes that lead to violence\r\nagainst children, and in particular of the spread of\r\npoverty and disease. The report should also deal with\r\nthe commercial and sexual exploitation of children\r\nthrough prostitution and their suffering under armed\r\nconflicts, abuse, killing and displacement, to which\r\nthey are subject as a result of foreign occupation.\r\nFinally, my delegation wishes to express its\r\nappreciation for the efforts of the Secretary-General\r\nand the United Nations specialized agencies,\r\nparticularly the United Nations Children’s Fund, aimed\r\nat achieving the well-being of children and enhancing\r\ntheir rights, while, at the same time, implementing the\r\nrecommendations of the report, “A world fit for\r\nchildren”, and supporting national efforts to follow up\r\nimplementation of the plan of action of that document.\r\nWe also appreciate all the relevant initiatives of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and civil society\r\norganizations.\r\nMr. Kovind (India): We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on the follow-up to the outcome\r\nof the special session on children (A/58/333). We have\r\nperused this report with interest.\r\nWe understand that the first in-depth report of the\r\nSecretary-General on this subject will be provided only\r\nin 2006. This is understandable, as progress, or the lack\r\nof it, can only be reviewed after sufficient time has\r\nbeen allowed for action to be taken. The General\r\nAssembly, nevertheless, in its resolution 57/190\r\nrequested a report this year with a view to identifying\r\nproblems and constraints in achieving progress. Such a\r\nreport can enable Member States to focus on areas in\r\nwhich reinforced commitment may be required.\r\nThe special session on children, held in 2001, had\r\nrecognized that the resources promised at the 1990\r\nWorld Summit for Children had, in fact, not been\r\nprovided. The Plan of Action adopted by that session\r\ntherefore devoted a separate chapter to the mobilization\r\nof resources. That was based on the realization that\r\nimplementation would not be possible without\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\nadditional allocation of resources, both in the national\r\nand the international contexts. Developed countries\r\nundertook a number of commitments with regard to\r\nofficial development assistance, bilateral official debt\r\nand market access in the Plan of Action adopted by the\r\nspecial session.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General does not refer\r\nto any specific constraints or problems that have been\r\nidentified with regard to the commitments undertaken\r\nat the special session. The report contains a passing\r\nexhortation to all countries to follow up on the\r\nMonterrey Consensus to increase financing for\r\ndevelopment. There is, apart from this, no analysis of\r\nwhether movement in the last year and a half has been\r\nin the right direction or not. Such an analysis could\r\nhave helped us in our understanding of possible\r\nproblems and constraints. There are a number of\r\nstudies that establish the incremental growth\r\nacceleration that takes place with simple investments in\r\nthe health, nutrition and education of infants and\r\nchildren. A study conducted in India has shown that\r\none dollar invested in a child saves 27 dollars in future\r\nhealth care, medical treatment, subsidies and lack of\r\neconomic contribution. It is very right, we believe, that\r\npoverty alleviation must begin with children. To invest\r\nin children is to invest in the future.\r\nIndia has the largest child population in the\r\nworld. We are aware of the gigantic dimension of that\r\nchallenge. Our achievements, vis-à-vis all indicators\r\nfor children over the past decade, have been positive.\r\nFor example, the infant mortality rate declined from\r\n146 per 1,000 live births in 1960 to 70 in 2000. The\r\nprevalence of severe and moderate degrees of\r\nmalnutrition among children has steadily declined from\r\n1974 to 2000. Primary school enrolment rates increased\r\nfrom 38 per cent in 1951 to 80 per cent in 2000. The\r\navailability of safe drinking water improved\r\nsignificantly, from 68 per cent in 1990 to 78 per cent in\r\n2000. We realize that we still have a long road ahead,\r\nand we are committed to ensuring the rights, protection\r\nand complete development of every child in our\r\ncountry.\r\nWe are attempting to provide maximum outreach\r\nfor our programmes for children. The integrated child\r\ndevelopment services, the largest child-care\r\nprogramme in the world, provide early child-care\r\nservices to over 30 million children from 0 to 6 years\r\nfrom low-income groups. With the further scaling up of\r\nthese services and a strong focus on newborn health\r\nand survival, including through home-based neo-natal\r\ncare by community workers and better health facilities,\r\nwe hope to further improve the health status of our\r\nchildren.\r\nThe spectre of HIV/AIDS threatens the fabric of\r\nsociety, and children often become unwitting victims of\r\ntragedy. The national policy for prevention and control\r\nof HIV/AIDS, announced by the Government of India\r\nlast year, reaffirms our commitment to provide an\r\nenabling social environment to prevention, care,\r\nsupport and protection of victims and to provide\r\ninformation and health education.\r\nThe problems of persisting malnutrition and high\r\ninfant and maternal mortality rates have been receiving\r\nour attention. We have launched a national nutrition\r\nmission that provides, inter alia, additional nutritional\r\nsupplements to adolescent girls and expectant and\r\nnursing mothers. Our strategy to eradicate malnutrition\r\nwill follow the intergenerational approach, while\r\nbuilding community awareness about healthy nutrition\r\nand educating mothers regarding proper health and\r\nnutritional care of their families. With those measures\r\nand with continued emphasis on improving the quality\r\nof water and access to sanitation, we hope to make an\r\nappreciable dent in the problem.\r\nOur Government launched a universal elementary\r\neducation scheme three years ago. Through it, we\r\nintend to provide free and quality education for all\r\nchildren in the age group of 6 to 14 years by 2010, with\r\nspecial emphasis given to girls’ education. This is a\r\nsignificant step toward achieving the goal of\r\nuniversalizing elementary education through a time-\r\nbound integrated approach. Our Department of Women\r\nand Child Development released a detailed statistical\r\nprofile of Indian children last year. It contains a rich\r\ncompilation of data for all the states in the country. The\r\ndata have been disaggregated by gender and by the\r\nrural versus urban dimension. This is the beginning of\r\nthe creation of a national and State database for\r\nchildren. Such a database would assist our policy\r\nmakers and programme managers in devising more\r\nfocused interventions and in guiding us towards the\r\ngoals that we have established.\r\nMs. Kangaloo (Trinidad and Tobago): The\r\ndelegation of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago\r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport, contained in document A/58/333 and entitled\r\n“Follow-up to the United Nations special session on\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\nchildren”. In his report, the Secretary-General has\r\nsought to identify the extent to which progress has\r\nbeen made by Governments in developing and/or\r\nstrengthening national action plans for children as a\r\ncritical first step towards the implementation of the\r\ncommitments made 18 months ago at the special\r\nsession.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation would like to inform\r\nthe Assembly that Trinidad and Tobago’s national plan\r\nof action is well advanced and is expected to be\r\ncompleted and approved by the Cabinet in 2004. This\r\nnational plan of action, which is being drawn up after\r\nthe holding of regional public consultations to\r\nincorporate the views of civil society and other\r\norganizations, will identify concrete strategies for the\r\ndevelopment of children.\r\nIn addition to the preparation of a national plan of\r\naction, other activities and policy initiatives have been\r\ninitiated or are fully under way in several areas, all of\r\nwhich are aimed at according full respect for and\r\nprotection of children’s rights in Trinidad and Tobago.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago’s broad policy with respect\r\nto children envisages, inter alia, the following:\r\nproviding quality education at the primary, secondary,\r\nvocational and tertiary levels starting from early\r\nchildhood; ensuring access to training with a view to\r\npromoting sustainable employment; promoting the\r\nprotection of children’s rights; fostering youth\r\nleadership and participation in community activities\r\nand national decision-making; and increasing\r\nawareness of health issues such as HIV/AIDS.\r\nSince the adoption of the World Declaration on\r\nthe Survival, Protection and Development of Children\r\nat the World Summit for Children, held in 1990, to\r\nwhich Trinidad and Tobago fully subscribes, and in the\r\ncontext of our subsequent adherence to the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child, various civil society\r\norganizations in Trinidad and Tobago have been\r\nstriving individually and collectively to formulate,\r\nintroduce and implement measures in keeping with the\r\naforementioned international policy instruments, to\r\nprotect and develop the children of Trinidad and\r\nTobago and to promote their best interests.\r\nFor its part, Government has provided a\r\nfacilitative environment and has sought to foster\r\ncollaboration at all levels of society to take into\r\nconsideration the relevant input of all stakeholders.\r\nCharged as I am with the portfolio of social\r\nservices delivery in the Office of the Prime Minister, I\r\nwish to share with the international community some\r\ninformation on the activities that we have undertaken,\r\naimed at reaffirming and promoting the rights of\r\nchildren.\r\nSince 1997, we in Trinidad and Tobago have been\r\nannually observing Child Rights Week in the month of\r\nNovember, with the intention of disseminating\r\ninformation on the rights of the child to a wide cross-\r\nsection of target groups such as Government ministries,\r\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs), teachers,\r\nparents, the general public and, most important of all,\r\nthe children of Trinidad and Tobago.\r\nWe have also been engaged in regular and\r\nongoing sensitization and education programmes aimed\r\nat various publics. Information packages have been\r\ndistributed to schools and to community-based\r\norganizations throughout Trinidad and Tobago,\r\ncontaining, among other things, a summary of the\r\narticles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\r\nEssay writing on this issue, community meetings and\r\ntelevision and radio appearances have all focused on\r\ndiscussions on the rights and responsibilities of the\r\nchild. Articles relating to proper parenting and child\r\nrearing are featured on a weekly basis in the print\r\nmedia with national circulation.\r\nIn July of this year, Trinidad and Tobago\r\nsubmitted its second periodic report to the Committee\r\non the Rights of the Child, in accordance with the\r\nConvention and taking fully into account the\r\nCommittee’s concluding observations of its\r\nconsideration of Trinidad and Tobago’s initial report of\r\nOctober 1997.\r\nIn November of last year, as part of my\r\nGovernment’s annual observance of Poverty\r\nEradication Week, focus was placed on children in\r\nrecognition of the destructive impact that poverty has\r\non their daily lives as well as on their future. The\r\nexploration of the theme “Breaking the cycle of\r\npoverty through early childhood care, nutrition and the\r\nenvironment” enabled the national community to\r\nunderstand what we — as adults, as a Government, as\r\ncivil society and as a community — need to do to\r\nensure that we break the cycle of poverty as it affects\r\nchildren in particular.\r\nTo conclude, the Government of the Republic of\r\nTrinidad and Tobago continues to work towards\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\nachieving the four major goals identified in the\r\nDeclaration and Plan of Action entitled “A world fit for\r\nchildren” (resolution S-27/2, annex). This year’s\r\nnational budget for the fiscal year ending in September\r\n2004 allocates the highest percentage of resources to\r\nthe health and education sectors and, in the area of\r\ncombating HIV/AIDS, the Government will, starting in\r\nfiscal year 2003 and continuing for the next five years,\r\nspend approximately $80 million on all aspects of the\r\ncampaign against HIV/AIDS, which will target, among\r\nothers, HIV-positive children. The Government will\r\nalso be expanding access to antiretroviral therapy by\r\nestablishing treatment centres throughout the country\r\nand by extending the coverage of our programme for\r\nthe prevention of mother-to-child transmission.\r\nIn the area of providing quality education and in\r\nkeeping with the Government’s holistic approach to\r\neducation, a plan to achieve universal pre-school\r\neducation before the end of this decade has been\r\ndeveloped.\r\nAs regards protecting children against abuse,\r\nexploitation and violence, my Government will be\r\nestablishing no later than 2004 a fully functional\r\nchildren’s authority for championing the rights of\r\nchildren.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Trinidad and\r\nTobago remains committed to ensuring the protection\r\nand well-being of our nation’s children, and we will do\r\nour utmost to ensure that our children not only survive\r\nbut blossom into healthy, wholesome young adults\r\ncapable of playing a meaningful role in the ongoing\r\ndevelopment of Trinidad and Tobago.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker on the debate on this item. The General\r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 41.\r\nAgenda item 46\r\nTowards global partnerships\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/227)\r\nMr. Staehelin (Switzerland) (spoke in French):\r\nSwitzerland fully subscribes to the principle of States’\r\nprimary responsibilities to eradicate poverty, to respect\r\nall human rights, to protect the environment and to\r\npromote social and sustainable development. There is,\r\nin fact, little doubt regarding the central role of States,\r\nparticularly in drafting national and international\r\npolicy. However, in the current climate of economic\r\nand social globalization, there is even less doubt that\r\nthe requirements for global governance extend beyond\r\nthe sphere of Governments’ jurisdiction and authority.\r\nA solid consensus on the current state of affairs is\r\nincreasing among a growing number of countries in the\r\nNorth as well as in the South. In this regard, many\r\nrecent initiatives support the need to develop and\r\naffirm a new culture of collaboration, relying on all of\r\nsociety’s available resources.\r\nIn 2001, this Assembly unanimously recognized\r\nfor the first time, by its resolution 56/76, the soundness\r\nof global partnerships. It reminded us that action taken\r\nto meet the challenges of globalization could only\r\nbenefit from a strengthening of the cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and all concerned partners,\r\nin particular the private sector, so that globalization\r\ncould become a force that is beneficial for all.\r\nDespite this encouraging development, what was\r\nonce the millennium consensus is now waning, to the\r\npoint of being called into question. Switzerland is\r\nconvinced that partnerships are one useful tool for\r\nmaintaining this process, or even of re-energizing it.\r\nThis commitment was notably manifested at the\r\nmajor conferences — from Monterrey to Cancún, by\r\nway of Johannesburg — even though their outcomes\r\ndid not necessarily meet expectations. Without\r\nbringing these results into question, we must persevere;\r\nour hope is based on the fact that the many partnerships\r\ndeveloped at these intergovernmental meetings often\r\nproduce tangible and promising results in the future.\r\nDrafted two years ago, the Secretary-General’s\r\nfirst report on “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and all relevant partners, in particular the\r\nprivate sector” (A/56/323) is now the document of\r\nreference. It presented existing forms of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the private sector,\r\nidentified outstanding issues and proposed\r\nrecommendations in that regard. Switzerland supported\r\nthose pertinent recommendations then and continues to\r\ndo so.\r\nAction was taken on the report’s\r\nrecommendations, as shown by the latest report on the\r\nstrengthening of cooperation between the United\r\nNations and relevant partners (A/58/227). Moreover,\r\nwe thank the Secretary-General for this excellent\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\ndocument, which presents an exhaustive overview of\r\nrecent developments. It highlights, in particular, that all\r\npartnerships initiated within the United Nations context\r\nmust respect a certain number of simple and effective\r\nrules: first, they must fully preserve the integrity,\r\nimpartiality, and independence of the United Nations;\r\nsecondly, they must function in as transparent a manner\r\nas possible; finally, they must contribute to the\r\nachievement of the Organization’s goals.\r\nIn our view, these rules are essential, and in this\r\nregard we have taken a great interest in the review\r\ncurrently under way of the guidelines governing the\r\nOrganization’s relations with the private sector. We\r\nhope that this review will be completed as early as\r\npossible.\r\nThe report also highlights the fact that, today\r\nmore than ever, we need a new culture of cooperation.\r\nIn this regard, Switzerland is particularly interested in\r\nthe development of policy dialogues with the private\r\nsector, as well as in efforts to promote United Nations\r\nobjectives and sensitize non-State actors to them.\r\nIn the same spirit, Switzerland supports with\r\nconviction the Global Compact launched by the\r\nSecretary-General. In three years, this innovative\r\ninitiative has proven that it is possible to bring together\r\nbusinesses, the United Nations and its agencies, civil\r\nsociety, and Governments in the search for common\r\nand freely agreed solutions. Of course, a watchful and\r\nconstructive eye must be trained upon the subscribing\r\nactivities and businesses, in order to ensure that the\r\ninitiative is not reduced merely to public relations. The\r\nfounding principles of the Global Compact must\r\ntherefore remain the transparency and responsibility of\r\nall actors involved. At the same time, however, the\r\nGlobal Compact is in itself an experiment, requiring\r\nflexibility and sufficient political space to manoeuvre\r\nto maximum effectiveness.\r\nIt could be said that the Global Compact has\r\nreached the end of its experimental phase, and is now\r\nmaturing into its operational phase. Institutional\r\ndevelopments, improved transparency, and the\r\npermanent debate revolving around the initiative give\r\nus confidence for its future.\r\nMr. Stanislavov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The implementation of the goals set out in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration by the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development and the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development requires\r\njoint efforts and enhanced partnership cooperation\r\namong States, international organizations, the private\r\nsector and other segments of civil society. The\r\nexperience of recent years has confirmed that the main\r\nfocus of the efforts of these partners should be the fight\r\nagainst poverty and assistance to economic growth and\r\nsustainable development. The United Nations has\r\nshown itself to be the most appropriate platform for\r\ndeveloping such partnerships, enabling flexible\r\ncoordination of the work of their stakeholders, the\r\nbalance of their interests, transparency, accountability\r\nand conformity with United Nations objectives.\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions 55/215 and 56/76,\r\n“Towards global partnerships”, co-sponsored by\r\nRussia, set out the proper parameters for interaction\r\nbetween the United Nations and non-State entities,\r\nparticularly enterprises, foundations and other actors of\r\nthe private sector. Further broadening the business\r\nrelations of the Organization with the private sector\r\ndeserves all possible support and encouragement. That\r\nis the imperative of our times. The globalization of the\r\nworld economy has made business one of the leading\r\nfactors of development and one of the most important\r\nparticipants in global economic ties. More than that, it\r\nis obvious that the prospect of full achievement of the\r\nMonterrey and Johannesburg targets depends on the\r\nproductive participation of the private sector and other\r\npartners.\r\nOn the whole, Russia is satisfied with United\r\nNations efforts to establish multilateral partnerships.\r\nAs one of the most successful examples of such efforts,\r\nwe would like to mention the useful work of the United\r\nNations Information and Communication Technologies\r\n(ICT) Task Force. In this area, we particularly take\r\nnote of the achievements resulting from the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development and the important\r\ncatalytic role played by the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. We believe that there is a need to make\r\nmore active use here of the Monterrey track as well. On\r\nthe whole, the United Nations system needs to expand\r\nthe practice of partnerships, especially in the area of\r\ndevelopment assistance. It is also important that\r\npartners have an opportunity to exchange experience\r\nwith each other.\r\nFrom the outset, Russia has supported the\r\ninitiative of Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the\r\nGlobal Compact, aimed at the active cooperation of the\r\nbusiness community with the United Nations with a\r\nview to creating a global economy with a human face.\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\nIt is no secret that in certain places there are still\r\napprehensions that the involvement of the business\r\nsector in cooperative work with the United Nations in\r\nthe area of development might undermine the entire\r\ngovernmental basis of such cooperation. We do not\r\nshare such apprehensions, and in our view the\r\ndevelopments of recent years in fact convincingly\r\nconfirm this rationale.\r\nThe experience of the United Nations allows us to\r\ndraw some conclusions. We share the view of the\r\nSecretary-General, stated in his report under this\r\nagenda item (A/58/227), that there is no single model\r\nfor successful partnerships and that partnerships are\r\nflexible in nature. However, it is obvious that any\r\ninnovations in the strategic framework and in the\r\npractical implementation of partnerships must in the\r\nfinal analysis both meet the interests of the\r\nGovernments of Member States and work to strengthen\r\nthe authority and preserve the independence of the\r\nOrganization. We expect that that basic approach will\r\nbe fully taken into account when carrying out the\r\nupdating of the United Nations business guidelines\r\npromised in the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nRussia is interested in developing cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Russian business\r\ncommunity, particularly through the Global Compact.\r\nThe idea of the Compact has become increasingly well\r\nknown in Russia as a result of a successful round table\r\non Russian business and the United Nations, held at the\r\nend of 2001 in Moscow. Currently, 11 leading Russian\r\ncompanies have adhered to the Global Compact, and a\r\nnational coordination committee for the Global\r\nCompact, made up of representatives from private\r\ncompanies and corporations, has been established. The\r\npositive trends in the Russian economy and the\r\nattendant increase in foreign investment activity are, in\r\nour view, creating additional opportunities for the\r\nwider dissemination of the principles of corporate\r\ngovernance and international standards of management,\r\naccounting, auditing and environmentally sound\r\nproduction advanced by the Global Compact.\r\nMr. Kazemi Kamyab (Islamic Republic of Iran):\r\nLet me express first and foremost our deep\r\nappreciation for the President’s active and engaged\r\nstewardship of the work of the General Assembly. I\r\nshould also like to take this opportunity to register our\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General and the\r\nSecretariat for the timely reports prepared for this\r\nyear’s session, including that on agenda item 46,\r\n“Towards global partnerships”.\r\nRecent developments at major United Nations\r\nconferences, such as the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development and the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, as well as the increasing\r\nengagement of the United Nations in partnerships —\r\nexamples of which have been elaborated in the report\r\nof the Secretary-General — should indicate the\r\nimportance of this subject to all of us in the Assembly,\r\nwhether from developing or developed countries. Since\r\nwe have had the opportunity in the past to present our\r\ngeneral views on various aspects of global\r\npartnerships, I do not intend to repeat those positions\r\nand analyses, which are fully known to the Assembly.\r\nInstead, I wish to emphasize some elements and\r\naspects which we consider to be prominent and urgent\r\nfor our prospective work.\r\nI should stress here that my Government attaches,\r\nas a matter of principle, great importance to the role\r\nand participation of stakeholders, including the private\r\nsector, in activities contributing to the realization of the\r\ngoals and objectives of the United Nations. Based on\r\nthis overall premise, we are well disposed and fully\r\nprepared to engage in a proactive and constructive\r\ndialogue with all interested negotiating partners on all\r\naspects of this important subject.\r\nWe are of the firm view that partnerships, in all\r\ntheir aspects and at the national and global levels alike,\r\nshould be conducive to development and the\r\nelimination of poverty. This cannot be overemphasized.\r\nWhat is at issue, therefore, is the role that the\r\ninternational community should play in this context.\r\nThe question of building partnerships finds its place\r\nwithin this overall framework. Put in very practical\r\nterms, the question for us is how to strengthen the\r\ndevelopment role of the United Nations system, how to\r\nenhance the effectiveness of its development activities\r\nand its support for national development strategies and\r\nprogrammes by implementing various initiatives,\r\nincluding partnerships with all relevant partners and\r\nthe private sector in particular. Needless to say, these\r\ninitiatives should be thoroughly reviewed, discussed\r\nand refined by Member States.\r\nIn a world somewhat fixated on market\r\neconomics and corporate profitability, legislation and\r\nintergovernmental agreements should remain important\r\ncomponents of any strategy to promote corporate\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\nresponsibility and accountability. New initiatives in\r\ngeneral, and partnerships in particular, should not lead\r\nto a further weakening of the regulatory role of the\r\nState and intergovernmental bodies. It is necessary to\r\nreiterate the importance of the State in providing for\r\nthe general welfare of its citizens. We should recognize\r\nthat fact and not undermine or diminish the role of the\r\nState. It is the State that is in charge of development,\r\nand not the market or corporations, as they have totally\r\ndifferent agendas.\r\nThe cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nrelevant partners should primarily aim at making a\r\ncontribution to the realization of the goals and\r\nprogrammes of the Organization. Relevant partners,\r\nparticularly the private sector, should contribute to the\r\nrealization of the development goals of the\r\nOrganization through the provision of financial\r\nresources, transfer of technology, management\r\nexpertise, in-kind donations, responsible investments,\r\nand reductions in the price of drugs used to treat\r\npandemic diseases. We hope in particular that the\r\ntransnational corporations, which have great influence\r\nin the global economy, will join efforts to realize the\r\ndevelopment goals of the United Nations and take\r\nconcrete measures to help developing countries in their\r\nefforts to promote development.\r\nIn our view, it is imperative that the United\r\nNations and its related bodies should focus their work\r\non issues central to the transfer of knowledge and\r\ntechnology and to the building of the necessary\r\ndomestic capacities, with a view to promoting the\r\ncompetitiveness of the developing countries. We are\r\nvery much concerned that the resources available to the\r\nUnited Nations system to assist developing countries in\r\nmeeting the challenges they face in designing the\r\npolicies and strategies required to bridge the\r\ntechnology gap between the North and the South are\r\nsimply inadequate. In this context, the resources that\r\nthe partners can contribute within the framework of\r\npartnership, in terms of expertise, funding and\r\ntechnology, should be a complement to, not a substitute\r\nfor, governmental resources.\r\nWe take the view that in the context of\r\ncooperation with the relevant partners, the United\r\nNations needs to follow a differentiated approach, in\r\nline with the characteristics of the partners as well as\r\nthe fundamental purpose of contributing to the\r\nimplementation of the development goals and\r\nprogrammes of the Organization.\r\nWith that in mind, and taking into account the\r\nlessons learned from successful partnerships, and also\r\nwith due regard for the provisions of the relevant\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions on global partnerships,\r\nmy country stands ready to contribute to collective\r\nintergovernmental endeavours to meet the challenges\r\nahead, with a view to the further evolution of a\r\ncommon vision and the elaboration of realistic\r\napproaches to promoting partnerships among all\r\nstakeholders.\r\nMr. Mantovani (Italy): I have the honour to take\r\nthe floor on behalf of the European Union. The\r\nacceding countries — Cyprus, the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland,\r\nSlovakia and Slovenia — and the associated countries\r\nBulgaria, Romania and Turkey, as well as the European\r\nFree Trade Association countries Iceland and Norway,\r\nalign themselves with this statement.\r\nAt the outset, let me express, on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union, our gratitude to the Secretary-General\r\nfor his report on “Enhanced cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and all relevant partners, in particular\r\nthe private sector”. The report is a useful update on the\r\nprogress made and challenges encountered since the\r\nadoption of the Millennium Declaration, which\r\nrecognized the relevance of the participation of the\r\nprivate sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs)\r\nand civil society to the collective achievement of the\r\nOrganization’s purposes.\r\nThe United Nations and the private sector have\r\ndeveloped valuable and diverse initiatives. There are\r\nmany forms of partnerships, ranging from time-bound\r\nproject partnerships involving a small number of\r\nentities, to global initiatives involving various actors.\r\nThe European Union is very pleased to acknowledge\r\nthat today partnerships are an integral part of the work\r\nof many United Nations organizations, including funds\r\nand programmes, particularly those who have on-the-\r\nground capacities to deliver.\r\nThe European Union has always considered\r\npartnerships to be important steps in the context of\r\ninternational cooperation for sustainable development.\r\nWe believe that partnerships are supportive of, and\r\ncomplementary to, the intergovernmental processes and\r\nprocedures of the United Nations and policy-making at\r\nthe national level. The development process is an\r\nincreasingly demanding task — all the more so given\r\nour growing awareness of our developing partners’\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\nneeds and priorities. To achieve the ambitious goals set\r\nout in the Millennium Declaration, we must seek new\r\nsolutions and methods of work. This will be possible\r\nonly with the active participation of all stakeholders in\r\nthe development process — governmental and non-\r\ngovernmental alike.\r\nThe European Union takes a positive view of the\r\nvarious initiatives undertaken after the launching of the\r\ndebate on global partnerships. There has been a\r\nflourishing of partnership initiatives, the best known of\r\nwhich are outlined in the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nThe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment has further encouraged the establishment\r\nof partnerships. At the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, 200 partnerships were announced.\r\nPartnerships are playing an important supportive role\r\nin carrying out the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation, as recognized at the most recent\r\nsession of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment.\r\nThe United Nations Information and\r\nCommunication Technologies (ICT) Task Force is\r\nanother valuable example of public-private-civil-\r\nsociety partnerships that make information and\r\ncommunication technologies available to all the\r\nworld’s citizens, in fulfilment of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. We look forward to the next\r\nWorld Summit on the Information Society, as it will\r\nprovide a unique opportunity to develop partnerships in\r\nthis key sector. Furthermore, I wish to acknowledge the\r\nactivities of the United Nations Fund for International\r\nPartnerships and to express our gratitude to the private\r\ncompanies and individuals that have contributed to the\r\nimplementation of so many projects worldwide.\r\nGlobal partnerships are not for multinational\r\ncorporations alone. Experience to date has shown that\r\nboth industrialized and developing countries are paying\r\nattention to the private sector. We would like the\r\nUnited Nations to expand its partnerships to include\r\nmore initiatives by developing countries, if necessary\r\nthrough capacity-building projects.\r\nThe evolving debate on global corporate\r\ncitizenship shows great vitality. Concepts such as\r\naccountability, transparency and corporate social\r\nresponsibility should be taken into account and\r\nunderlined. Governments have an important role in\r\npromoting this debate at the national and international\r\nlevels. They also have an important role to play in\r\nencouraging responsible global corporate citizenship,\r\nwhich should lead more companies to embrace the\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment (OECD) guidelines for multinationals\r\nand the Global Compact, and to become involved in\r\npartnerships in support of poverty reduction and\r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe United Nations Global Compact, launched by\r\nthe Secretary-General in July 2000, is receiving\r\ntremendous support from the international community.\r\nThe private sector has also come to recognize the need\r\nto balance financial and economic imperatives with\r\nbroader societal concerns. The Global Compact\r\ncontains a vision for good conduct based on nine\r\nprinciples, which more than 1,200 companies have now\r\nmade part of their corporate strategy.\r\nThe European Union supports the work done by\r\nthe Global Compact to integrate its principles into\r\nbusiness activities through a range of initiatives,\r\nincluding dialogue, learning, outreach and projects. We\r\nbelieve that the Global Compact contributes positively\r\nto the achievement of development objectives,\r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report reflects the fact\r\nthat partnerships are a very new phenomenon for the\r\nUnited Nations. They entail experimentation, as we are\r\nlearning by doing. The United Nations can be\r\ninstrumental in creating a favourable environment for\r\nthe evolution of partnerships. The United Nations,\r\ntogether with main stakeholders like the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization, has,\r\ntherefore, a particular role to play in further\r\nencouraging and enhancing the use of the instrument of\r\npartnerships in order to achieve the goals of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe European Union understands concerns that\r\nthe pursuit of profit and the promotion of private or\r\nindividual advantage might take precedence over the\r\npublic good. Partnerships must not compromise the\r\nindependence of the United Nations or prevent it from\r\ndefending the general interest and acting accordingly.\r\nThe Secretariat has the responsibility to safeguard the\r\nintegrity of the system, and we welcome the steps\r\ntaken in that respect. At the same time, we believe that\r\nthe growing partnership activities will require special\r\ntraining within the United Nations system to enhance\r\nthe Organization’s ability to manage them.\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\nThe European Union will introduce a draft\r\nresolution in the General Assembly that will reflect the\r\npositive developments in the global partnership\r\nactivities of the United Nations, which we have\r\noutlined in this statement. We intend to build on the\r\nconsiderable support we received two years ago, and\r\nlook forward to working with all interested delegations.\r\nMs. Jan (Pakistan): We are grateful to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report, contained in\r\ndocument A/58/227, on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and all relevant partners, in particular\r\nthe private sector.\r\nOur deliberation on this agenda item is rooted in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration, which called for the\r\ndevelopment of strong partnerships with the private\r\nsector and with civil society organizations in pursuit of\r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication.\r\nThe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment reaffirmed the commitment made at the\r\nMillennium Summit to forge a global partnership to\r\naddress the complex and multidimensional challenges\r\nof poverty and underdevelopment.\r\nThe history of United Nations partnership with\r\nnon-State actors dates back to 1946, when the\r\nCommittee on Non-Governmental Organizations of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council was first established.\r\nToday, thousands of non-governmental and civil\r\nsociety organizations are working with the United\r\nNations for the attainment of their shared objectives.\r\nWith the help of those partners, United Nations\r\nagencies have achieved some major successes,\r\nespecially in the areas of health, nutrition, poverty\r\neradication and development.\r\nIn today’s globalizing world, it is becoming\r\nincreasingly evident that if we want globalization to\r\nwork for all, as envisioned by our leadership in the\r\nMillennium Declaration, the economic, financial and\r\nsocial challenges confronting humankind will have to\r\nbe addressed in a coherent and collective manner by all\r\nstakeholders. That will require greater cooperation\r\nbetween Member Governments of the United Nations\r\nand other non-State actors, such as the Bretton Wood\r\ninstitutions, civil society and the private sector, and the\r\ndevelopment of greater harmony in their shared\r\nendeavours to promote development. Based on that\r\npremise, Pakistan welcomes cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and other stakeholders and\r\nacknowledges the positive role such partnerships can\r\nplay in facilitating the flow of financial resources and\r\ntechnical know-how, including research and\r\ndevelopment, capacity-building and the sharing of\r\nexperiences in various realms of development.\r\nWe believe that today’s complex challenges can\r\nonly be addressed through a collaborative and coherent\r\napproach involving the Member Governments of the\r\nUnited Nations, institutional stakeholders, the private\r\nsector and civil society. It was in that context that the\r\nMillennium Declaration resolved to provide greater\r\nopportunities for the private sector, non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs) and civil society to meaningfully\r\ncontribute to the realization of the objectives and goals\r\nof the United Nations, particularly the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nWe also recognize the pivotal role that the private\r\nsector can play in achieving the development\r\nobjectives of the major United Nations summits and\r\nconferences, particularly in the areas of trade, debt,\r\ninvestment, technology and industrial cooperation.\r\nSimilarly, they can also make a positive contribution in\r\nthe operational activities of the United Nations,\r\nespecially as regards disadvantaged groups and the\r\npoorest segments of society.\r\nIn that regard, we are pleased to learn from the\r\nSecretary-General’s report that a number of partnership\r\ninitiatives between the United Nations and non-State\r\nactors are contributing immensely to the realization of\r\nthe Organization’s development goals. We appreciate\r\nthe effort of United Nations funds, programmes and\r\nagencies to promote successful partnership with NGOs,\r\ncivil society and other non-State actors. In that\r\nconnection, we welcome the creation of a United\r\nNations Partnerships Office in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of the relevant resolutions of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that\r\npartnerships are a tool to complement the\r\nOrganization’s efforts to achieve the goals and\r\nobjectives of the United Nations. We also agree that,\r\ngiven the diversity of the areas in which the United\r\nNations system works with its development partners, to\r\nevolve a uniform modality of interaction and rules of\r\nengagement is not possible. However, it is also not\r\npossible to work with non-State actors without defining\r\nthe scope and limits of such cooperation. It is therefore\r\nimportant that partnership arrangements between the\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\nUnited Nations system and the private sector should be\r\nbased on clearly defined definitions, principles and\r\ncriteria.\r\nThe principles and approaches for such\r\npartnerships should be built on the firm foundation of\r\nthe purposes and principles set out in the Charter. The\r\nguidelines so prepared should clearly stipulate\r\ndelineation of responsibilities and roles, accountability,\r\ntransparency and commitment to maintaining the\r\nindependence, integrity and impartiality of the United\r\nNations. Furthermore, they should aim at serving the\r\ngoals and purposes of the United Nations system and\r\nshould respect the sovereignty and supremacy of\r\nStates. In that regard, the set of principles for\r\npartnership arrangements prepared by the Commission\r\non Sustainable Development at its eleventh session\r\ncould be used as a guideline by other entities of the\r\nUnited Nations system for preparing their own\r\nguidelines, taking into account their specific\r\nrequirements.\r\nPakistan appreciates the role of non-State actors\r\nin the realization of the objectives of the United\r\nNations and considers that those entities can play a\r\nvital role in the realization of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. They can also support developing\r\ncountries in their efforts to eradicate poverty, by\r\nproviding financial resources, technical expertise and\r\ntransfer of technologies. However, it is important to\r\nensure that the entities involved in partnership\r\narrangements with the United Nations abide by the\r\nrules of procedure set by the Organization and assume\r\ncorporate responsibility and accountability.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his detailed report on partnerships\r\n(A/58/227). It contributes to a comprehensive\r\nunderstanding of the state of cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and its partners in various areas over\r\nthe past two years. The reach of economic\r\nglobalization has broadened and deepened over recent\r\nyears, but the gap between North and South continues\r\nto widen, and the disparity in development among\r\ncountries has become more pronounced. At the same\r\ntime, we are witnessing a considerable role being\r\nplayed in globalization by the private sector,\r\nparticularly the massive transnational corporations.\r\nIn order to turn globalization into a positive force\r\nthat benefits all and to promote common and balanced\r\ndevelopment of countries in the process of\r\nglobalization, each of the relevant partners, especially\r\nthe private sector, should make its unique contribution\r\nby giving full play to its own advantages in financing\r\nand technology. In that context, we support the United\r\nNations strengthening its cooperation with the relevant\r\npartners in order to encourage them to take part in\r\nactivities aimed at attaining the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and implementing the outcomes of\r\nthe major United Nations conferences in the economic\r\nand social fields.\r\nWe have observed that the United Nations and its\r\nrelevant partners have engaged in diverse forms of\r\ncooperation over the past two years. Many private\r\nsector and non-governmental organizations and civil\r\nsociety actors actively participated in the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development and the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development, and in\r\ncarrying out specific projects in the field of\r\ndevelopment, playing a positive role towards achieving\r\nthe goal of poverty eradication and other Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. We appreciate their efforts in that\r\nregard.\r\nAt the same time, with a view to achieving better\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and relevant\r\npartners that takes full advantage of the strengths of\r\nthose partners and optimizes their contribution to the\r\nwork of the Organization, I would like to emphasize\r\nthe following points.\r\nFirst, cooperation with relevant partners should\r\nconform to the purposes and the principles of the\r\nCharter and to the rules and procedures of the United\r\nNations, without detriment to the intergovernmental\r\nnature of the Organization. That is the basis for United\r\nNations cooperation with its partners.\r\nSecondly, partnerships should complement, but\r\nnot be a substitute for, intergovernmental cooperation,\r\nand their overriding priority should be to contribute to\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals and\r\nimplementing the outcomes of major United Nations\r\nconferences. At the same time, partnerships should be\r\naction-oriented. We agree with the observation of the\r\nSecretary-General in his report that “partnerships must\r\nprove their worth in a practical manner by the\r\nachievement of concrete results” (A/58/227, para. 66).\r\nThirdly, the Secretary-General also points out that\r\n“[there] is no single model for successful partnerships”\r\n(para. 64). We fully agree with him on that point and\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\nbelieve that the United Nations should adopt diverse\r\nand flexible forms of cooperation with relevant\r\npartners, in keeping with the characteristics of those\r\npartners and the areas and levels of cooperation, and\r\nthat this cooperation should contribute to achieving\r\nobjectives.\r\nFourthly, partnerships need to be guided and\r\nregulated in order to ensure their quality. We support\r\nthe proposal made by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport “to create more robust processes for partnership-\r\nreporting and accountability” (para. 92). At the same\r\ntime, we believe that the comprehensive and detailed\r\nguidelines and criteria on partnerships in the field of\r\nsustainable development formulated by the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development at its\r\neleventh session could serve as guidance for other\r\npartnerships within the United Nations system in the\r\nfield of development.\r\nMr. Butagira (Uganda): We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report (A/58/227). It is clear from the\r\nreport that the United Nations has been active in\r\nbuilding partnerships to achieve the goal of the\r\neradication of poverty and other programmes of the\r\nOrganization. Numerous examples of partnership\r\nprojects have been undertaken, including on improving\r\neducation, eliminating child labour, promoting youth\r\nissues, human rights, information technology and\r\nsustainable development. All of these contribute to the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nand other commitments made at other major United\r\nNations summits and conferences.\r\nThese partnerships are of particular importance to\r\ndeveloping countries, which have tremendous problems\r\nmobilizing financial, technical and human resources to\r\nimplement development and poverty eradication\r\nprogrammes. Partners, especially from the private\r\nsector, can come in to complement the efforts of\r\nGovernments.\r\nMy own country, Uganda, has benefited in the\r\nspecific areas of investment guidance and capacity-\r\nbuilding, as well as in the fight against HIV/AIDS,\r\nmalaria and tuberculosis. Partnerships can help us, as a\r\nleast developed country, in the area of infrastructure\r\ndevelopment and maintenance. We also need continued\r\nassistance in our joint effort to combat all forms of\r\nterrorism in our region.\r\nWe agree that such partnerships should in no way\r\nbe a substitute for States’ responsibility to be the lead\r\nparticipants in their own development and in the fight\r\nfor poverty eradication. It should also not be a\r\nsubstitute for the international community meeting its\r\ncommitment to help developing countries eradicate\r\npoverty and achieve other agreed targets necessary for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe note that the cooperation between the United\r\nNations and relevant non-State actors, especially the\r\nprivate sector, is necessary and mutually beneficial and\r\nhas gained momentum in the recent past. We agree\r\nwith the view that such partnerships should continue to\r\nserve the purposes and the principles of this, the most\r\nuniversal intergovernmental Organization, and should\r\nnot compromise its intergovernmental decision-making\r\nnature.\r\nLastly, in its quest to deliver programmes to\r\nMember States, the United Nations should continue to\r\nassess the benefits and the risks associated with\r\npartnerships with non-State actors and to strengthen the\r\nguidelines for such cooperation.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. The General\r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 46.\r\nMr. Alimov (Tajikistan), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nAgenda item 50\r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of and\r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United\r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic,\r\nsocial and related fields\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/359)\r\nMr. Benmellouk (Morocco) (spoke in French): I\r\nshould like to make the following comments on behalf\r\nof the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe question before us today is indeed important,\r\nif not critical, given that the strengthening of\r\nmultilateralism and the viability of international action\r\nfor development depends, to a great extent, on the\r\ninternational community’s capacity to translate into\r\nreality the commitments it undertook in the area of\r\neconomic and social development at the various\r\nconferences and summits held during the past few\r\nyears under the auspices of the United Nations.\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\nThe Group of 77 and China would recall that the\r\ncommendable — and considerable — efforts of the\r\ninternational community have made it possible to\r\nachieve results dealing with the problem of\r\ndevelopment in all of its aspects that are accepted by\r\nall.\r\nIndeed, with the commitments contained in the\r\nMillennium Declaration, as well as those emanating\r\nfrom the major conferences — in particular those held\r\nat Copenhagen, Monterrey and Johannesburg — the\r\ninternational community today has at its disposal a\r\nclear road map to guide our actions and channel our\r\nefforts towards the achievement of conditions\r\nconducive to sustainable and harmonious development;\r\nthe equitable sharing of the benefits of globalization;\r\nand a peaceful world reconciled with itself.\r\nHowever, the achievement of such a far-reaching\r\nyet viable objective requires unswerving efforts to\r\nfulfil the commitments to which I have just referred,\r\ntaking into account the specific particularities of each\r\nprocess. It is within that framework that the Group of\r\n77 and China launched the initiative for the\r\nestablishment of an ad hoc working group to consider\r\nways and means of ensuring the integrated and\r\ncoordinated follow-up of the outcome of the major\r\nconferences and summit meetings held under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations in the economic and\r\nsocial spheres.\r\nToday, in the context of the adoption of resolution\r\n57/270 B, we welcome the outcome of the Group’s\r\nwork, in particular since the decision to convene, in\r\n2005, a summit devoted to development and to involve\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) in the annual meeting of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council on financing for\r\ndevelopment represent, inter alia, considerable\r\nadvances in the area of development.\r\nMoreover, the broad consensus that emerged from\r\nthe work of that working group is likely to strengthen\r\nthe conviction of the international community as a\r\nwhole regarding the vital need to revitalize the spirit of\r\nmultilateralism and shared responsibility, given the\r\nirreversible process of globalization and the\r\ninterdependence of economies.\r\nIn that context, the Group of 77 and China\r\nbelieves that, at a time when the developing countries\r\nare continuing to make tremendous efforts towards\r\neconomic and social reform despite various and\r\noverwhelming constraints, it devolves on developed\r\ncountries to accompany those efforts by fulfilling their\r\ncommitments in the area of development.\r\nIndeed, based on the principles of solidarity,\r\npartnership and shared responsibility, which must guide\r\nthe international community in its efforts to work for\r\nthe welfare of all, the developed countries are more\r\nthan ever before called on fully to contribute to those\r\nefforts through a variety of measures. Such measures\r\ninclude market access for products from the developing\r\ncountries; a stepping up of official development\r\nassistance; a reduction in the external debt of\r\ndeveloping countries and its cancellation for the least\r\ndeveloped countries; the promotion of foreign direct\r\ninvestment for countries of the South; and\r\ncontributions to the Global Fund to combat major\r\npandemics.\r\nThe real threats of marginalization and poverty\r\nresulting from the galloping pace of globalization that\r\nface so many peoples of the South must further prompt\r\nthe various elements of the international community —\r\nin particular the developed countries — immediately to\r\nact to realize a global partnership leading to\r\ndevelopment that benefits all and that will allow us to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nResolution 57/270 B, to which I referred earlier,\r\nhas prepared the ground for a major event — a summit,\r\nto be held in 2005, to take stock of the implementation\r\nof commitments to achieve the Development Goals.\r\nThe Group of 77, which spared no effort to achieve the\r\nadoption of that resolution, fervently hopes that the\r\nprospect of that global summit will provide an\r\nopportunity for all of us once again to give the issue of\r\ndevelopment top priority on the agenda of the United\r\nNations. As everyone is aware, security questions are\r\nglobal and necessarily include the fight against poverty\r\nand destitution. Only hope for a better future can lead\r\nto greater stability and security for all.\r\nWe must take advantage of this debate to follow\r\nup on that resolution, decide on the modalities for the\r\nsummit and begin preparations for its success. The\r\nsummit, as provided for by the resolution, should be\r\nheld within the framework of the integrated and\r\ncoordinated follow-up of the outcome of the major\r\nconferences and summits of the United Nations in the\r\neconomic and social fields, including the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\nWe believe that such a major event will provide a\r\ngenuine opportunity to consider the implementation of\r\ncommitments undertaken by Member States, both\r\ndeveloped and developing, and to assess the progress\r\nmade towards the achievement of the development\r\ngoals agreed at the international level, including those\r\nset out in the Millennium Declaration. That meeting\r\nwill also enable the international community to reflect\r\non the best ways and means to move forward the\r\nimplementation process.\r\nAnother question that is provided for in\r\nresolution 57/270 B deals with the assessment of\r\nfollow-up mechanisms of the International Conference\r\non Financing for Development. That resolution\r\nprovides for an assessment during the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly of the Monterrey\r\nConsensus follow-up mechanisms, namely the high-\r\nlevel meeting of the Economic and Social Council with\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions and with the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO), and the Assembly high-\r\nlevel dialogue on financing for development. The\r\nGroup of 77 will be ready to begin that assessment\r\nimmediately following the high-level dialogue on\r\nfinancing for development, set for 29 and 30 October.\r\nMr. Balarezo (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I have\r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the countries of the\r\nRio Group: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,\r\nColombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador,\r\nEl Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico,\r\nNicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Uruguay, Venezuela,\r\nand my own country, Peru.\r\nThe Rio Group has decided to speak in this\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly, in which we are\r\ndiscussing resolution 57/270B, adopted in June 2003,\r\nto reaffirm our firm commitment to fulfilling that\r\nresolution’s objectives and to stress the importance of\r\nits full implementation.\r\nWe believe that the negotiating process that\r\nguided us to the resolution reflected the concern of us\r\nall that the progress made is not sufficient and that\r\ngreater political impetus is therefore required to ensure\r\nthe complete and effective fulfilment of the\r\ncommitments we undertook in the major United\r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic and\r\nsocial fields.\r\nThose conferences and summits, each with its\r\nown thematic unity, offered us an institutional,\r\nprogrammatic and conceptual framework for tackling\r\nwhat we consider to be the major challenges to\r\nhumanity: eradicating poverty and improving the living\r\nstandards of the world’s entire population.\r\nNevertheless, the need for coordination among the\r\nvarious follow-up mechanisms and for determining the\r\ndifferent roles of the various actors involved alerts us\r\nto the urgency of preparing a comprehensive\r\nframework giving coherence to the follow-up\r\nprocesses.\r\nTo tackle that challenge, we recognize, above all,\r\nthat everyone must be involved in attaining those\r\ncommitments. Therefore, it is necessary to coordinate\r\nand integrate the work of all actors involved in this\r\nprocess, such as States, the organizations and agencies\r\nof the United Nations system, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, the World Trade Organization, civil society\r\nand the private sector.\r\nIn this regard, the Rio Group takes note of the\r\nproposal of the President of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil to strengthen the role of the Council, which is\r\nacting on the requests for it to make its coordination\r\nactivities more effective, in particular with respect to\r\nthe work of the Commissions, the impact of the\r\nactivities of the United Nations funds and programmes,\r\nand the Council’s relationship with the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization. The Rio\r\nGroup believes the proposal by the President of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council is a valuable contribution\r\ndeserving the study and discussion of Member States.\r\nWe emphasize the need to examine periodically\r\nthe progress made towards achieving the agreed goals\r\nof the major United Nations conferences and summits.\r\nSuch a review should respect the follow-up processes\r\nof each conference at all levels — national, regional,\r\ninternational and system-wide — and identify the\r\nobstacles that arise in the course of implementing\r\ndecisions. Reviewing each follow-up process will also\r\nenable us to find the best ways to update their working\r\nmethods and to enhance the synergies generated among\r\nthe follow-up processes, with a view to achieving\r\nbetter results.\r\nThe Rio Group would like to stress the\r\nimportance we attach to such a periodic review, which\r\nwould provide us with an assessment of progress made,\r\nmaintain the momentum necessary to consolidate that\r\nprogress and enable us to design a set of measures for\r\novercoming any obstacles encountered. In that regard,\r\nwe support holding a summit in 2005 to assess\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\ncomprehensively the progress made. It should coincide\r\nwith a comprehensive review of the implementation of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration assessing progress towards\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, including goal 8:\r\nbuilding a global partnership for development.\r\nWe also agree that we must determine the roles of\r\nand coordination among the various organisms and\r\nagencies of the United Nations system in the follow-up\r\nmechanisms for decisions adopted in order to enhance\r\nthe effectiveness of measures taken at all levels and to\r\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, we will continue this work in this\r\nsession of the General Assembly when we consider the\r\nindicative programme of work of the Second\r\nCommittee and when we evaluate the follow-up\r\nmechanisms established at the Monterrey Conference\r\nin accordance with Chapter III of the Monterrey\r\nConsensus. The Rio Group notes the suitability of\r\ncontinuing to explore ways and means of improving the\r\nwork of the Second and Third Committees. The Rio\r\nGroup will participate energetically in that work, which\r\nis part of the framework of the reform process under\r\nway at the United Nations and which aims to improve\r\nits action and effectiveness.\r\nMr. Mantovani (Italy): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union. The acceding\r\ncountries Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia,\r\nSlovenia, the associated countries Bulgaria, Romania\r\nand Turkey, and the European Free Trade Association\r\ncountries Liechtenstein and Norway align themselves\r\nwith this statement.\r\nThe European Union supports a strong and\r\nefficient United Nations system and is ready to\r\ncontribute actively to the goal of building an\r\ninternational order based on effective multilateral\r\ninstitutions within the fundamental framework of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nThe principal goal of the years ahead will be the\r\neffective implementation of the commitments made at\r\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits of\r\nthe last ten years, including the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, which for the European Union represents\r\nthe overarching policy framework for United Nations\r\neconomic and social work. The United Nations must\r\nplay a central role in maintaining the political\r\nmomentum established through the major conferences\r\nand in ensuring a more integrated and coordinated\r\nimplementation of their targets and commitments.\r\nThe positive outcome of the ad hoc working\r\ngroup of the General Assembly on the integrated and\r\ncoordinated implementation of and follow-up to the\r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits in the economic and social fields culminated\r\nin the approval of resolution 57/270B. Its success in\r\ncapitalizing on the momentum originating in the United\r\nNations conferences and summits of the last decade has\r\ngiven fresh impetus to the work carried out by United\r\nNations bodies. At this point, we have established a\r\nclear direction and a working programme that calls on\r\nthe entire membership to make progress on these\r\nissues.\r\nAt the end of this month, the General Assembly\r\nwill hold its first High-Level Dialogue on Financing\r\nfor Development. The European Union is committed to\r\nensuring the successful outcome of that event. It will\r\nallow us to make an assessment of the follow-up to the\r\nmechanisms established in the Monterrey Consensus.\r\nThe Monterrey Consensus has been successful because\r\nit is based on an innovative partnership among the\r\nUnited Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions and the\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO). Those organizations\r\nhave demonstrated a great commitment to\r\nimplementing the Monterrey Consensus and have\r\nshown that it is possible to work together, within their\r\nrespective mandates, to achieve a common objective.\r\nWhat we have witnessed is just the beginning of a\r\nnew era of cooperation and synergy in the international\r\ncommunity’s cohesive and effective action to\r\nimplement a common agenda for the financing of\r\ndevelopment. We believe that there is room to improve\r\nthis relationship further through the development and\r\nstrengthening, in all the organizations involved, of a\r\nsense of ownership of the follow-up mechanisms of the\r\nMonterrey Consensus. We should continue to involve\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions and the WTO in our\r\ndiscussions intended to determine the best ways to\r\nensure that the follow-up mechanisms reflect the spirit\r\nof Monterrey and correspond to our common final\r\nobjectives.\r\nAs far as the Second Committee is concerned, we\r\nare convinced that in order to maximize the policy\r\nrelevance and the impact of the Committee’s\r\ndeliberations, we need to address the way it works. In\r\nparticular, we are bound, according to resolution\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\n57/270 B, to consider the Second Committee\r\nprogramme set forth in the annex to the resolution and\r\ntake a decision thereon by December 2003. The\r\nEuropean Union has already put forward its vision on\r\nhow it feels the work should be reorganized. We\r\napproach this debate with an open mind but with the\r\nclear objective of strengthening the role of the United\r\nNations.\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 57/270 B also\r\nindicated the need to strengthen United Nations\r\ncohesiveness by fostering stronger interaction and\r\ncoordination between the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council through a process of\r\ngreater consultation between the Presidents and the\r\nBureaus of the Assembly and the Council.\r\nFurthermore, we need to ensure that the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and its Second and Third\r\nCommittees be more focused, coherent, visible and\r\npolitically relevant to the implementation of and\r\nfollow-up to major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits. In order to achieve this, we need to look at\r\nthe interaction between the different Committees,\r\nguided by political vision.\r\nThe broad consensus on the pivotal role of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council in system-wide\r\ncoordination and in promoting integrated, coordinated\r\nimplementation of and follow-up to major United\r\nNations conferences and summits has been emphasized\r\nin the light of the policy guidance emanating from the\r\nMillennium Summit, the Monterrey Consensus and the\r\noutcome of the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. At its session last July, the Economic\r\nand Social Council decided to finalize the list of cross-\r\nreferenced thematic issues and the multi-year work\r\nprogramme before its next substantive session, in 2004.\r\nIn its deliberations, the General Assembly has\r\nalso invited the functional commissions of the United\r\nNations Economic and Social Council to contribute\r\nactively to the assessment of cross-sectoral thematic\r\nissues. The various commissions have been asked to\r\nreview their work methods, and we have great\r\nexpectations for the results. The new path being taken\r\nby the Commission on Sustainable Development, for\r\nexample, shows how innovation can lead to more\r\ntargeted, productive work that keeps the United\r\nNations in the focus of the initiatives and attention of\r\nGovernments, civil society and other stakeholders. In\r\nthis respect we believe that the functional commissions\r\nshould look at resolution 57/270 B with a different\r\ntimetable. According to the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, it will take at least two years before we can\r\nhave an understanding of what has been done. We\r\nbelieve that once there is consensus on proceeding in a\r\ncertain direction, decisions have to be implemented\r\nrapidly and efficiently.\r\nAchieving the Millennium Declaration Goals and\r\nthe objectives of the other major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits will take sustained political\r\nattention, a strong sense of commitment and\r\nunwavering dedication at both the national and\r\ninternational levels. The European Union believes that\r\nthe major event of 2005 will strengthen our common\r\nwill to focus on implementation based on a\r\ncomprehensive review of the progress achieved. As we\r\nhave already indicated, we look to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to make further proposals to the Assembly\r\nnext year on the structure of such an event. At the same\r\ntime, we believe that the Secretariat should begin\r\npreparations, in order to provide the membership with a\r\ncomprehensive evaluation on what has been achieved\r\nin terms of the results of the commitments undertaken\r\nby the international community in implementing the\r\nMillennium Declaration and the outcomes of the major\r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits.\r\nMr. Qamar (Pakistan): It is with great pleasure\r\nthat I address this august forum on the important\r\nsubject of integrated and coordinated implementation\r\nof and follow-up to the outcomes of the major United\r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic,\r\nsocial and related fields.\r\nAt the outset, I wish to align our delegation with\r\nthe statement made by the representative of Morocco\r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Pakistan’s\r\ndelegation welcomed the adoption of General\r\nAssembly resolution 57/270 B on integrated and\r\ncoordinated conference follow-up. We call for its\r\nimmediate and full implementation.\r\nOver the years, the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council have played an important\r\nrole by contributing to the evolution of the global\r\neconomic and social normative framework that\r\nemerged from the major United Nations conferences\r\nand summits of the 1990s. It is now time to move from\r\npolicy to implementation. To that end, we are happy\r\nthat the focus of the decisions contained in resolution\r\n57/270 B is on implementation.\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\nWe are pleased to note that the Economic and\r\nSocial Council has been given the primary\r\nresponsibility to act as the central forum for system-\r\nwide coordination and annual review and assessment of\r\nprogress in the implementation of conference\r\noutcomes. Pakistan’s delegation looks forward to\r\nparticipating in discussions to develop a multi-year\r\nwork programme for the coordination segment of the\r\nCouncil, taking into account the thematic issues\r\ncommon to the conference outcomes as well as\r\nproposals by Member States. We believe that for the\r\noptimal results, the substantive review process must be\r\ncarried out by the functional commissions. The work of\r\nthe functional commissions should be analytical and\r\nmust highlight key coordination issues relating to the\r\ntheme of the coordination segment. As it is, the theme\r\nof the future high-level segment would be related to the\r\ntheme of the coordination segment, which augers well\r\nfor greater synergy and effective follow-up.\r\nThe monitoring of the implementation of the\r\ncommitments should be across the board and based on\r\nindicators agreed upon through an intergovernmental\r\nprocess. While on this subject, may I emphasize the\r\nneed to make the mechanisms for reporting by national\r\nGovernments simplified and harmonized.\r\nOf particular satisfaction to us is the emphasis\r\nplaced by the General Assembly on the need for\r\nregular review of the progress made in the\r\nimplementation of commitments undertaken in major\r\nUnited Nations conferences. The Assembly has also\r\nstressed the need for indicators to assess progress made\r\nin the achievement of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, including the Goal concerning a global\r\npartnership for development.\r\nIn addition, we welcome the decision to hold a\r\nmajor United Nations event in 2005 aimed at a\r\ncomprehensive review of progress achieved in\r\nimplementing all commitments made in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. We fully endorse the points stressed by the\r\nrepresentative of Morocco, speaking on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China, that such a review should be\r\nundertaken in a balanced manner in terms of the\r\nrespective commitments of developed and developing\r\ncountries. Indeed, a 2005 summit would be a welcome\r\nopportunity to undertake a global review of\r\nimplementation of conference outcomes, including that\r\nof the Millennium Summit. We trust that the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly will initiate the\r\npreparatory process at an early date to ensure the\r\nsuccess of such a summit. We look forward to\r\nparticipating in deliberations on this important subject.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nAt the outset, I should like to express our support for\r\nthe statement made earlier by Morocco on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nSince the 1990s, the United Nations has held a\r\nseries of major conferences and summits in the\r\ndevelopment field — such as the Millennium Summit,\r\nthe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment — with the aim of strengthening\r\ninternational development cooperation and achieving\r\nsustainable development and general social progress in\r\nall countries, particularly the developing countries.\r\nThose summits and conferences set out goals and\r\ntargets for international development cooperation.\r\nFinding ways to integrate and coordinate\r\nimplementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of\r\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits is\r\nessential in attaining the Millennium Development\r\nGoals.\r\nWe welcomed the fact that last year, the United\r\nNations took an important step forward in its efforts to\r\nintegrate and coordinate follow-up actions by forming\r\nan Ad Hoc Working Group within the General\r\nAssembly. In June this year, the General Assembly\r\nadopted resolution 57/270 B, on integrated and\r\ncoordinated implementation of and follow-up to the\r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits in the economic and social fields, which\r\nestablished specific goals and focuses and which\r\ndefined roles for the United Nations and related\r\ninstitutions. That marked a good starting point for\r\ncomprehensive and balanced implementation of the\r\noutcomes of the relevant conferences and summits. In\r\nthat context, we have taken note of the report submitted\r\nby the Secretary-General (A/58/359) on\r\nimplementation of resolution 57/270 B. We appreciate\r\nthe useful suggestions put forward by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nI wish to make the following points on how to\r\nimplement the resolution on follow-up to the outcomes\r\nof the major United Nations conferences and summits.\r\nFirst, being action-oriented and placing priority\r\non implementation are essential for integrated and\r\ncoordinated implementation of and follow-up to the\r\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits.\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\nDevelopment — particularly of developing\r\ncountries — has been the common theme of all the\r\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits. At the\r\nsame time, underdevelopment is the major obstacle to\r\ndeveloping countries’ efforts to implement those\r\noutcomes. The United Nations should commit itself to\r\nthe development goals, principles and consensuses\r\nestablished by those conferences and summits;\r\nfundamentally change the trend towards making peace\r\nprimary and development secondary; attach equal\r\nimportance to promoting development and maintaining\r\npeace; establish a development culture; strengthen\r\ndevelopment agencies; and ensure development\r\nresources. To that end, we believe that the United\r\nNations, in formulating cross-sectoral themes, should\r\ntake fully into account the concerns of developing\r\ncountries — such as financial assistance, technology\r\ntransfer, capacity-building, market access and poverty\r\neradication — so that development goals can be\r\neffectively addressed and attained in a comprehensive,\r\nconcerted and balanced way.\r\nSecondly, strengthening coordination and\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and relevant\r\nagencies and promoting the coherence and coordination\r\nof international development policies will guarantee\r\nimplementation of the resolution. In implementing\r\ninternational development goals and targets, the United\r\nNations and other development institutions — such as\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions, the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) and the relevant funds and\r\nprogrammes — all have important but different roles to\r\nplay. The United Nations and those institutions need to\r\nstrengthen the coherence and coordination of their\r\npolicies to better link development policies and\r\nprojects and to enhance the coherence and coordination\r\nof international development policies. We thus\r\nappreciate the regular dialogue with the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the WTO in the General Assembly and\r\nin the Economic and Social Council.\r\nThirdly, more comprehensive reform of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council will lay the foundation\r\nfor more meaningful development cooperation. In\r\norder to better integrate and coordinate United Nations\r\nefforts in that regard, resolution 57/207 B has provided\r\nthe General Assembly, the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and their functional bodies with a number of\r\nreform measures, such as reviewing follow-up\r\nmechanisms for development financing, streamlining\r\nthe Second Committee’s agenda, holding joint\r\nmeetings of the Second and Third Committees and\r\nimproving the functional commissions’ working\r\nmethods. Reform leads to efficiency, effectiveness and\r\nresponsiveness.\r\nWe welcome and support the proposals\r\nconcerning United Nations reform in the economic and\r\nsocial fields. Here, I wish to emphasize two points.\r\nFirst, reform of the Second Committee and reform in\r\nthe economic and social fields are integral parts of the\r\nentire United Nations reform process. Coordinated and\r\ncomprehensive consideration should be given to\r\nvarious reform measures in their entirety. Secondly, the\r\nultimate goal of reform is strengthening, not\r\nweakening, the economic development function of the\r\nUnited Nations; strengthening governmental\r\nresponsibility rather than replacing it with partnership;\r\nexpanding, not diminishing, the right of developing\r\ncountries to participate in decision-making; and\r\nenabling civil society to join in international\r\ncooperation according to relevant rules of procedure,\r\nrather than without rules to follow.\r\nFinally, we support the provision of resolution\r\n57/270 B that automatic five-year and 10-year review\r\nmechanisms for a number of major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits are to be assessed on a case-\r\nby-case basis. We also support the United Nations\r\nholding a major event in 2005 to comprehensively\r\nreview integrated and coordinated implementation of\r\nand follow-up to the major conferences and summits. I\r\nshould like to reiterate that, as 2005 — a major year for\r\nthe United Nations — will also see a review of the\r\nMillennium Summit and a high-level dialogue on\r\nfinancing for development, the United Nations should\r\nconduct consultations at an early date to determine the\r\nlevel, form, focus and interrelations of those high-level\r\nmeetings.\r\nWe are prepared to continue to strengthen our\r\ncooperation and consultations with various parties in a\r\njoint effort for successful, integrated and coordinated\r\nUnited Nations follow-up actions.\r\nMr. Mustapha (Malaysia): My delegation\r\nwelcomes the decision of the General Assembly to\r\ninclude consideration of this item in the agenda of the\r\ncurrent session.\r\nMost conferences and summits are prompted by a\r\ndesire to discuss important issues of common interest\r\nand to explore solutions to problems. We attach great\r\nimportance to the implementation of the decisions and\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\ngoals of all United Nations conferences and summits. It\r\nis imperative that effective monitoring mechanisms be\r\nestablished to ensure that conferences and summits\r\nachieve their desired goals and objectives.\r\nIn this connection, we thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report to the General Assembly. It has\r\nassisted us in identifying the core elements of the\r\nframework that are essential for integrating follow-up\r\nprocesses, as projected in resolution 57/270 B, adopted\r\nby this body four months ago. The report also\r\nhighlights issues that require our immediate attention.\r\nFor its part, the Economic and Social Council, through\r\nits coordination segment, focused on its role in this\r\nregard at its 2003 substantive session, bearing in mind\r\nits crucial task to promote the achievement of\r\ninternationally agreed development goals.\r\nThe question of the core elements of the\r\nframework that are essential for integrating follow-up\r\nprocesses with respect to implementation was\r\ndiscussed comprehensively during the deliberations\r\nleading up to the adoption of resolution 57/270 B, as\r\nwell as during discussions held during the 2003\r\nsubstantive session of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. My delegation intends, therefore, to touch on\r\nthe issues relating to implementation actions\r\nhighlighted in the report.\r\nThe Secretary-General has identified three kinds\r\nof implementation actions: first, ongoing activities that\r\nneed to be strengthened; secondly, decisions to be\r\nadopted in implementing specific provisions of the\r\nresolution; and, thirdly, the question of future reviews.\r\nOn the strengthening of ongoing activities, resolution\r\n57/270 B has emphasized that a stronger link should be\r\nestablished between policy guidance and operational\r\nactivities. We concur with the observation that the\r\ngoverning body has the responsibility to ensure that\r\nrelevant policy decisions are integrated into the\r\nprogramme of work of the respective organizations.\r\nIn this regard, the respective Executive Boards of\r\nthe relevant agencies, funds and programmes should\r\nundertake a more concerted effort to ensure greater\r\ncoherence in the activities undertaken by them, in the\r\nfurtherance of the objectives of their various\r\nprogrammes, culminating ultimately in the\r\nimplementation of outcomes of conferences and\r\nsummits in an integrated and coordinated manner. We\r\nare also in agreement with the assertion made by the\r\nGeneral Assembly that system-wide interagency\r\ncoordination and cooperation to implement the\r\noutcomes of major conferences and summits should be\r\nfurther promoted through the work of the United\r\nNations System Chief Executives Board (CEB) for\r\nCoordination and the United Nations Development\r\nGroup.\r\nIt is clear to my delegation that the bulk of the\r\nfollow-up activities would necessarily have to be\r\ncarried out by the Economic and Social Council\r\nthrough its various functional commissions. These are\r\nthe bodies that have been entrusted, and even at times\r\nspecifically mandated, with the primary responsibility\r\nfor the review and assessment of progress made in\r\nimplementing the outcomes of United Nations\r\nconferences and summits. In this regard, the Economic\r\nand Social Council has the responsibility to ensure that\r\nits functional commissions work in a coordinated\r\nmanner, especially when deciding on thematic issues to\r\nbe considered by its various organs. In this regard, my\r\ndelegation commends the Economic and Social Council\r\nfor having begun, even prior to the adoption of\r\nresolution 57/270 B, to have joint Bureau meetings\r\nbetween its various functional commissions and\r\nbetween the functional commissions and the Council\r\nitself. Such meetings would prove invaluable in\r\nallowing the relevant chairpersons to discuss their\r\nmulti-year programmes of work, in particular when\r\ndeliberating thematic issues for a new term. As a\r\nmember of the Economic and Social Council, my\r\ndelegation reiterates its full support and commitment to\r\nwork with other members to ensure success in our\r\nendeavours.\r\nThrough resolution 57/270 B, the Assembly had\r\nalso requested the Economic and Social Council to\r\nestablish a multi-year work programme for its\r\ncoordination segment no later than 2004. The Bureau\r\nof the Economic and Social Council is to initiate\r\nconsultations by January 2004, with the aim of\r\nreaching a decision before the start of its substantive\r\nsession in the same year. However, as most of the\r\nfunctional commissions of ECOSOC had already\r\nadopted their multi-year programmes of work well in\r\nadvance of the adoption of resolution 57/270 B, we are\r\nof the view that the Economic and Social Council\r\ncould begin to play its role in this regard by\r\nconsidering a thematic issue that would involve the\r\nwidest cross-section of the work of its various organs\r\ninsofar as it is possible. The Economic and Social\r\nCouncil should continue with the consideration of such\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\nthematic issues until its functional commissions have\r\nexhausted their current multi-year programmes of\r\nwork. At such time, the multi-year programmes of\r\nwork of the Economic and Social Council and its\r\nfunctional commissions could be streamlined so that\r\nthey would consider particular cross-sectoral thematic\r\nissues common to each organ.\r\nHaving said this, my delegation would like to\r\nstress that such consideration of common cross-sectoral\r\nissues should be done in a fair and balanced manner,\r\nbearing in mind the tendency to overlook the\r\nconsideration of social issues, alternatively referred to\r\nas soft issues, when juxtaposed with those with an\r\neconomic or developmental aspect. We must remember\r\nthat in developing countries, in particular, limited\r\neconomic development will lead to a situation where\r\nsocial policies could not be effectively carried out, thus\r\npreventing the fulfilment of goals set out in the various\r\noutcome documents of United Nations summits and\r\nconferences. As such, one should not overlook the\r\nimportance of coherence and the integration of social\r\nand economic imperatives.\r\nMy delegation reiterates its commitment to fulfil\r\nall obligations undertaken at various United Nations\r\nsummits and conferences, and pledges its full support\r\nto both the General Assembly and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, and through the Council, its various\r\nfunctional commissions, in the furtherance and\r\nachievement of all goals of the major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits.\r\nMr. Chave (Switzerland) (spoke in French):\r\nSwitzerland took an active part in the General\r\nAssembly’s Ad Hoc Working Group on the Integrated\r\nand Coordinated Implementation of and Follow-up to\r\nthe Outcomes of the Major United Nations Conferences\r\nand Summits in the Economic and Social Fields.\r\nDespite the important work achieved by the\r\nGroup, it is our opinion that the emphasis placed on the\r\nMillennium Development Goals as a reference point\r\nfor such a coordinated follow-up has fallen short of the\r\nexpectations expressed at the Millennium Declaration’s\r\nadoption. Moreover, despite Switzerland’s conviction\r\nthat a coordinated follow-up must cover all the major\r\nconferences, it is becoming evident that the issues\r\naddressed by these conferences have yet to be\r\nintegrated in a concrete way in either policies or\r\ninstitutions.\r\nNevertheless, Switzerland is satisfied with the\r\ndecisions taken concerning the working methods of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the improvement in\r\nthe functioning of its subsidiary organs, including the\r\nfunctional commissions, as well as with the\r\nsuggestions regarding the General Assembly,\r\nparticularly its Second and Third Committees. Each\r\nbody is responsible for improving its own effectiveness\r\nand better coordinating its work, with a view to fully\r\nrealizing the action plans elaborated at the major\r\nconferences and the Millennium Goals.\r\nTo accomplish this, we deem the following points\r\nto be of particular importance: more flexibility in the\r\nmulti-year work programmes of the Council and its\r\nfunctional commissions; more efficacious working\r\nmethods; greater coordination between the agenda of\r\nthe Council and those of its functional commissions;\r\nreorganization and simplification of the Second\r\nCommittee’s agenda; improved coordination among the\r\nvarious offices of the Secretariat; regular reporting by\r\nall the functional commissions on the integrated\r\nfollow-up of major conferences and summits; and\r\nimproved coordination at all levels and among all\r\nactors, including Governments, international\r\norganizations — in particular, the United Nations, the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\r\nOrganization — civil society and the private sector.\r\nOn another level, we recognize the soundness of\r\nthe Working Group’s observations on the importance of\r\nthe resources necessary to implement the\r\nrecommendations of conferences and summits.\r\nHowever, there are limits to the resources made\r\navailable through official development assistance for\r\nthe realization of the Millennium Declaration’s\r\ncommitments. We must come up with new and\r\ninnovative solutions. In this respect, Switzerland\r\nsupports the Secretary-General’s efforts to make the\r\nUnited Nations accessible to new actors and partners,\r\nwho can bring with them new capacities and resources.\r\nWithout seeing any need to restructure the very\r\nfoundations of the current multilateral architecture,\r\nSwitzerland believes that the Monterrey Consensus —\r\nmore specifically its Chapter III — is a step in the right\r\ndirection, recognizing the need for collaboration among\r\nall the parties concerned in order to achieve the\r\nMillennium Goals. In our view, the specific role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the context of the follow-up to\r\nMonterrey is to contribute to improved cooperation,\r\ntransparency and coordination between Governments,\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\ncivil society and public and private actors, as well as\r\nmultilateral institutions. Switzerland feels that specific\r\nquestions raised in the follow-up to Monterrey should\r\nbe addressed in the Second Committee, and it looks\r\nforward to taking part in its debates over the coming\r\nweeks.\r\nMr. Ayari (Tunisia) (spoke in French): The\r\nTunisian delegation would first like to associate itself\r\nwith the statement made by the representative of\r\nMorocco on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and\r\nto acknowledge our colleague Abdellah Benmellouk,\r\nwho presented that statement.\r\nMy country welcomes the discussion today on the\r\nintegrated and coordinated implementation of and\r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits in the economic, social and\r\nrelated fields. At the general debate of the current\r\nsession, most Member States stressed the importance\r\nthey attached to giving practical effect to the\r\nundertakings given by the international community at\r\nthe major conferences and summits that marked the\r\n1990s and the beginning of the new millennium with a\r\nview to eradicating poverty and promoting sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThose conferences and summits, including the\r\nMillennium Summit, the Monterrey Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development and the Johannesburg\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development gave rise to a\r\ngreat deal of expectation in the international\r\ncommunity, in particular among the developing\r\ncountries, who were hoping at last to see to the advent\r\nof a stable, fair and united socio-economic order. These\r\nevents have effectively charted a course for us all to\r\nfollow to combat poverty, promote development and to\r\nensure that peace, security and justice reign. They also\r\nprovided the opportunity to define the key parameters\r\nand undertake commitments for a global partnership in\r\norder to achieve these targets.\r\nDespite these commitments, we must\r\nacknowledge that many of the development targets set\r\nout in the Millennium Declaration will not be achieved\r\nby many countries. Instead, we are seeing an increase\r\nin the number of people living in poverty, particularly\r\nin Africa, a region where achieving these objectives is\r\nthe greatest challenge. Therefore, we must pay close\r\nattention to the fulfilment of commitments undertaken\r\nin the framework of an implementation and follow-up\r\nprocess that is energetic, systematic and results-based\r\nand that avoids duplication and wasted effort.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome the fact that the\r\nUnited Nations system is determined to achieve\r\ntangible results. The adoption in June 2003 of General\r\nAssembly resolution 57/270 B on integrated and\r\ncoordinated implementation of and follow-up to the\r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits in the economic and social fields is\r\nparticularly important because in our opinion it reflects\r\nan awareness of the need to stimulate energetic policies\r\nto promote implementation of and follow-up to these\r\ncommitments. In that resolution the Assembly defined\r\nthe roles that Member States, the United Nations\r\nsystem, the Bretton Woods institutions, the World\r\nTrade Organization, civil society and the private sector\r\nwould play in implementing these commitments, all\r\nwithin the context of a partnership that requires each\r\nparty to carry its own weight.\r\nAdmittedly, it is the developing countries that\r\nbear the primary responsibility for achieving these\r\ntargets, but it is also clear that, given the interwoven\r\nnature of national economies and the world economic\r\nsystem, their efforts require the support of the\r\ninternational community, including the assistance of\r\ntheir developed partners, because most of them will not\r\nsucceed alone. Success for developing countries also\r\ndepends on establishing an international economic\r\nclimate that is favourable to them.\r\nThe role of the Bretton Woods institutions and the\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) in implementing the\r\noutcomes of the conferences was broadly emphasized\r\nby the General Assembly in the aforementioned\r\nresolution, which called for a strengthening of their\r\ncontribution to implementing the outcomes of the\r\nconferences and summits. The high-level meeting of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council with the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, held on 14 April 2003, was an\r\nimportant milestone in reviewing the progress achieved\r\nand the obstacles encountered in implementing the\r\nMonterrey Consensus. We believe that that meeting\r\nwill effectively contribute to strengthening the\r\nEconomic and Social Council’s cooperation with the\r\nkey partners in Washington and Geneva. Furthermore,\r\nthe high-level dialogue on financing for development,\r\nto be held on 29 and 30 October, will enable us to think\r\nmore in depth about ways and means of translating the\r\ncommitments undertaken at Monterrey into concrete\r\nactions.\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.40\r\nWith regard to the role of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, Tunisia welcomes the emphasis placed\r\non the need to strengthen that pivotal body, which is\r\ncharged with promoting the coordination and\r\ncoherence of policies and with the implementation and\r\ncomprehensive and coordinated follow-up of the\r\noutcomes of the major international conferences in the\r\neconomic and social fields. We also attach great\r\nimportance to the role played by the functional\r\ncommissions, such as the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, and we call for a strengthening of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council’s relations with the\r\nregional commissions. In addition, we call for support\r\nfor the development frameworks established at the\r\nregional level, such as the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment.\r\nMoreover, the Tunisian delegation would like to\r\nhighlight the need to enhance the capacity of national\r\nstatistical systems, but that must be accompanied by\r\nprogress in developing international indicators that will\r\nenable us to better assess situations and results of\r\nnational implementation plans.\r\nThe scope of the problems and the complexity of\r\nthe obstacles that must be overcome by developing\r\ncountries demand that we be more resolute and devote\r\nmore resources — at both the national and international\r\nlevels — to ensuring economic growth and sustained\r\nand lasting development for those countries.\r\nOfficial development assistance, despite efforts to\r\nbetter utilize it, continues to decline. The donor\r\ncountries must honour their commitments to increase\r\nofficial development assistance to the level of 0.7 per\r\ncent of gross national product. Increasing such aid is\r\nalso important to provide the United Nations system’s\r\noperational activities with the maximum of success and\r\neffectiveness. In that regard, we highlight the role of\r\nUnited Nations funds and programmes — particularly\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme — in\r\nsupporting developing countries’ efforts, particularly\r\nwith a view to eliminating poverty, as well as the need\r\nto ensure the financing of those funds and programmes\r\nin a more certain and predictable way.\r\nDebt relief should be more significant and more\r\nrapid. It is also essential to facilitate and improve\r\naccess to world markets for developing countries’\r\nproducts, which requires a reduction in agricultural\r\nsubsidies and the elimination of tariff barriers. It is also\r\na question of facilitating active participation by\r\ndeveloping countries in decisions taken by major\r\ninternational organizations — not only the United\r\nNations, but also the WTO, the International Monetary\r\nFund and the World Bank.\r\nThe Tunisian delegation believes that it is of the\r\nutmost importance to regularly assess progress\r\nachieved in implementing the outcomes of the major\r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits. We welcome\r\nthe inclusion on the agenda of the current General\r\nAssembly session of an item entitled “Integrated and\r\ncoordinated implementation of and follow-up to the\r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits in the economic, social and related fields”.\r\nFinally, we should like to stress the importance of\r\norganizing a summit in 2005 to review progress in\r\nimplementing all commitments undertaken in the\r\nMillennium Declaration on the basis of a report of the\r\nSecretary-General. We believe it is necessary to begin\r\nthe preparations for that summit as soon as possible.\r\nImplementing commitments undertaken by the\r\ninternational community is the only path that will lead\r\nto a better world. Let us work together to meet the\r\nchallenges of underdevelopment, destitution, disease\r\nand malnutrition. Let us do that for the 1.2 billion\r\npeople painfully surviving on less than one dollar per\r\nday, for the 840 million people suffering from hunger\r\nand for the 24,000 people — many of whom are\r\nchildren — who die of starvation every day.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
