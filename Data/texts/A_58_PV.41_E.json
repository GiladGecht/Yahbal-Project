Hunte. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 50 (continued)\r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of and\r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United\r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic,\r\nsocial and related fields\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/359)\r\nMs. Ndhlovu (South Africa): South Africa aligns\r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of\r\nMorocco on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nIt is with a sense of proud achievement that the\r\nSouth African delegation contributes to the debate on\r\nthe integrated and coordinated implementation of and\r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits in the economic and social\r\nfields. Not only did we actively participate in all of the\r\nmajor conferences and summits that took place during\r\nthe last decade, we were also privileged to host both\r\nthe World Conference against Racism, Racial\r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in\r\n2001 and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in 2002.\r\nSouth Africa strongly supports the recognition —\r\ngiven by resolution 57/270 B, which is the basis for\r\ndiscussions under this item — of the fact that we are\r\nbeyond the normative debate and planning phase and\r\nhave to ensure that the outcomes of major conferences\r\nand summits are indeed implemented. Having had\r\nthese conferences and summits, we now face the\r\nchallenge of ensuring that the decisions taken at these\r\nglobal meetings are implemented in a coherent and\r\neffective manner. In this regard, the principal result\r\nthat South Africa would like to see from the\r\nimplementation of these decisions is that they would\r\nultimately lead to a better life for all mankind.\r\nSouth Africa, as part of the developing world,\r\nknows the great difficulties in achieving the goals of\r\nfreedom from want and freedom from fear. This is a\r\nchallenge that cannot be addressed by any one country\r\nin isolation. It is indeed a challenge for all of us and\r\nmust be addressed in a multilateral context.\r\nIn this context, the outcomes of the major United\r\nNations conferences and summits provide a\r\ncomprehensive basis for action at the national, regional\r\nand international levels, with the key objectives being\r\npoverty eradication, sustained economic growth and\r\nsustainable development. The fact that every country\r\nhas the primary responsibility for its own economic\r\nand social development means that regional and\r\ninternational organizations, as well as the United\r\nNations as a whole, also have a role to play in this\r\nimportant partnership. However, for this partnership to\r\nwork, every Member State should undertake to\r\nimplement the commitments it has made.\r\nAfrica has already shown its commitment to\r\ncontribute to this notion of partnership by, among\r\nothers, its active promotion and participation in the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).\r\nThis home-grown African initiative, so generously\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nsupported by the United Nations and other Member\r\nStates and organizations, is seeking to address Africa’s\r\nparticular problems within a coherent and\r\ninstitutionalized framework of partnership and mutual\r\nbenefit.\r\nHowever important this regional framework is to\r\naddressing the issues confronting Africa, the need for a\r\ninternational socio-economic environment that is\r\nconducive remains critical for it to be successful. It is\r\nbecause of this recognition that South Africa has\r\nexpressed its disappointment on the failure of the\r\ndiscussions in Cancún, while in the same vein\r\npronouncing its determination to get the development\r\nround, as agreed upon in Doha, back on track. We also\r\nbelieve in the necessity to ensure the full participation\r\nof developing countries in setting the agenda and\r\ndetermining the norms for international interaction in\r\nthe economic, financial and monetary fields.\r\nHowever, the United Nations system also has an\r\nimportant responsibility to stay fully engaged in the\r\nimplementation of agreements and commitments\r\nreached at the major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits. Of particular importance is the need to ensure\r\nthat policy guidelines from the General Assembly and\r\nthe Economic and Social Council on the\r\nimplementation of the outcomes of the major United\r\nNations conferences and summits be incorporated into\r\nthe programmes of work and operational activities of\r\nthe relevant funds and programmes of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMy delegation recognizes the need to strengthen\r\nthe role of the General Assembly as the highest\r\nintergovernmental mechanism for the formulation and\r\nappraisal of policy on matters relating to the\r\ncoordinated and integrated follow-up to the major\r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits. At the same\r\ntime, it is important to ensure that the working methods\r\nof its committees and plenary meetings allow for\r\nmaximum focus and participation, in order to enhance\r\nthe role of the General Assembly in reviewing the\r\nprogress made in implementation.\r\nWith reference to the important role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly as a deliberative and legislative\r\nbody to set norms and guidelines, it is therefore\r\nregarded as the ideal authority for overall monitoring\r\nand oversight of implementation regarding decisions\r\ntaken in multilateral forums. The convening power of\r\nthe United Nations, as was seen in the major summits\r\nand conferences of the past decade, and as was\r\nreflected, for example, by the highest level of\r\nparticipation at the Millennium Summit, the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, suggests that the United Nations should\r\nplay an overall coordination and monitoring role,\r\noverseeing the implementation by all actors, including\r\nfrom national Governments, regional and global\r\ninstitutions and civil society.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council can and should\r\nact as the central mechanism for system-wide\r\ncoordination and should also continue to be\r\nstrengthened. In that regard, my delegation is\r\nparticularly supportive of the recommendation made in\r\nresolution 57/270 B, that the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil should review on a regular basis, by means of\r\na cross-sectoral approach, the progress made in the\r\nimplementation of the outcomes of the major United\r\nNations conferences and summits and their follow-up\r\nprocesses and to assess its impact on the possible\r\nachievements of the goals and the targets of the\r\nconferences and summits. The role that the Statistical\r\nCommission could play by refining and finalizing\r\nindicators to assess the implementation of\r\ncommitments and the achievement of development\r\ngoals remains crucial.\r\nIn this ambit of partnership, it is also important to\r\nrecognize the important role that the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nshould play in the implementation of the outcomes of\r\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits. The\r\nhigh-level meeting every spring between the Economic\r\nand Social Council, the Bretton Woods institutions and\r\nthe WTO, during which time the important issue of\r\ncoherence and consistency of the international\r\nmonetary, financial and trading systems in support of\r\ndevelopment and other matters are discussed, is already\r\nan indication of the effort to implement the decisions\r\nmade at Monterrey to improve dialogue and\r\ncoordination between the United Nations and those\r\ninstitutions. This bodes well for future discussions on\r\nthe international development agenda and for taking\r\nstock of progress made in the implementation of the\r\nMonterrey Consensus.\r\nAt the same time, acknowledgement should also\r\nbe given to the important role that non-governmental\r\norganizations, community based organizations and the\r\nprivate sector should play in the coordinated\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nimplementation and follow-up to the outcomes of the\r\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits in the\r\neconomic and social fields.\r\nThe successful implementation of the outcomes\r\nof the major United Nations conferences and summits\r\nlies with all of us — Member States, non-governmental\r\norganizations and the United Nations system. The\r\ncommitments made during these conferences and\r\nsummits will come to nothing if we do not show the\r\nnecessary political will to succeed. The goals that we\r\nhave set ourselves at these major meetings to eradicate\r\npoverty and to improve the lives of millions of people\r\nare in danger of not being achieved.\r\nI would also like to briefly reflect on the follow-\r\nup to the outcome of the special session on children.\r\nThe international community made profound\r\ncommitments to children at the special session on\r\nchildren and endorsed unanimously the Declaration and\r\nPlan of Action, “A World Fit for Children”. The\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional\r\nProtocols serve as a landmark treaty due to its almost\r\nuniversal ratification by Member States. The voices of\r\nchildren and their concerns and aspirations form an\r\nintegral part of the outcome document adopted in 2002.\r\nThese commitments to building a world fit for children\r\nmust compel us to implement our obligations as a\r\nmatter of priority, since the issues at stake, as\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan said, are about the\r\nfuture of humanity.\r\nThe international community is faced with global\r\ncrises and a number of conflicts, which in all instances\r\ninvolve the lives of children caught up in conflict and\r\nhumanitarian disasters. Yet, in many parts of the world,\r\nthe challenges to improve children’s lives have moved\r\nforward. The work of the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund (UNICEF), in partnership with Governments, has\r\ncontinued to address the rights of children in a\r\ncomprehensive manner. Numerous national plans,\r\nbased on the outcome of the special session, are in\r\nplace and are being implemented. The international\r\ncommunity therefore has a road map before it and\r\nshould continue to deliver its promises to the children\r\nof the world.\r\nIn closing, allow me to voice my delegation’s\r\nsupport for the recommendations made by the\r\nSecretary-General in his report (A/58/228) to address\r\nthe serious issue of global road safety. It is again\r\nhighlighted that the burden of road traffic injuries falls\r\ndisproportionately on people in low-and middle-\r\nincome countries, with Africa possessing the highest\r\nroad traffic death rate of 28 deaths per 100,000\r\npopulation. World Health Organization projections\r\nsuggesting that by 2020 road traffic injuries would rank\r\nthird among causes of death and disability, ahead of\r\nsuch other health problems as malaria and HIV/AIDS,\r\nis a serious concern. The impact that this could have on\r\nthe sustainable development of the developing\r\ncountries speaks for itself.\r\nI would, therefore, in particular, support the\r\nrecommendation made by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport for stronger international cooperation to support\r\nthe development of the national capacities of Member\r\nStates in need thereof to address this problem. The role\r\nthat the United Nations system could play in\r\naddressing global road safety could be, among others,\r\nthe identification of a coordinating body within the\r\nUnited Nations system to facilitate and coordinate the\r\nefforts of global road safety. Such an effort should be\r\nwelcomed.\r\nMr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan): Let me, at the\r\noutset, express our appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report prepared under agenda item 50,\r\nentitled “Integrated and coordinated implementation of\r\nand follow-up to the outcomes of the major United\r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic,\r\nsocial and related fields”. In our view his report is the\r\nresult of the thorough and comprehensive work carried\r\nout by the Secretariat and by the delegations of\r\nMember States that made recommendations under this\r\nagenda item within the framework of the open-ended\r\nad hoc working group headed by the President of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe are encouraged by the report’s observation\r\nthat the global consensus generated by the United\r\nNations summits and conferences of the last decade on\r\nissues of poverty eradication and sustainable\r\ndevelopment as central concerns of national and\r\ninternational policy frameworks has renewed the\r\nrelevance of the work of the United Nations in the\r\neconomic, social and related fields, and of its mission\r\nto guide and harmonize policies for development.\r\nIn that regard, the Millennium Summit truly\r\nmarked a turning point in the process of transforming\r\nthe emerging global consensus into specific goals and\r\ntargets, backed by political commitment at the highest\r\nlevel. We pledged in the Millennium Declaration to\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nstrengthen international solidarity and partnership in\r\norder to attain the Millennium Development Goals in a\r\ntimely manner.\r\nWe share the view that the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development and the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development — two\r\nmajor conferences, held last year in Monterrey and\r\nJohannesburg respectively — have proved to be very\r\nuseful global events in terms of offering focused\r\nmechanisms to monitor progress towards attainment of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\r\nAt the same time, the issue of conceptual\r\nintegrity of various efforts to follow up on the\r\noutcomes of those international summits and\r\nconferences is highly relevant in view of the need to\r\nensure better coordination of global, regional and\r\nnational activities for development. In this regard, it is\r\nmy delegation’s view that the existence of a structure\r\nfor integrated and coordinated implementation and\r\nfollow-up is the key to promotion of mutually\r\nreinforcing action in the pursuit of the internationally\r\nagreed development goals.\r\nKazakhstan shares the view that an enabling\r\nenvironment at the national and international levels is\r\nof critical importance for attaining the agreed\r\ndevelopment goals. As for our country, we can say that\r\nit has become possible to successfully incorporate our\r\ndevelopment-goals commitments into our long-term\r\nnational programmes and strategies as a result of the\r\npolitical will, clearly expressed by our leaders, to\r\npursue the development of Kazakhstan, guided by the\r\nprinciple of the State’s economic and social\r\nresponsibility vis-à-vis its citizens.\r\nKazakhstan’s report on the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, the first such report submitted by\r\na country of the Commonwealth of Independent States\r\n(CIS), demonstrated that those goals are fully reflected\r\nin our existing national development strategies,\r\npolicies and programmes. We also agree that an\r\nenabling environment at the international level requires\r\nenhanced partnership between donor and recipient\r\ncountries, based on a recognition of the national\r\nleadership and ownership of the development goals, as\r\nwell as on sound policies and good governance at the\r\nnational and international levels.\r\nTo achieve the internationally agreed\r\ndevelopment goals, it is necessary to step up efforts to\r\nmobilize and effectively use financial resources as a\r\nmeans of implementation. Reaching the United Nations\r\ntarget for official development assistance of 0.7 per\r\ncent of gross national product, along with the\r\nmobilization of the domestic resources of recipient\r\ncountries, should be considered a key factor in\r\nattaining such important goals as the elimination of\r\npoverty, the improvement of social indicators, the\r\nachievement of better living standards and the\r\nprotection of our environment.\r\nIn that regard, our delegation attaches great\r\nimportance to the High-Level Dialogue on Financing\r\nfor Development to be held next week in accordance\r\nwith the Monterrey Consensus in order to coordinate,\r\nat the intergovernmental level, follow-up to the\r\nMonterrey Conference.\r\nKazakhstan believes that the role of the United\r\nNations system, including the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization (WTO),\r\nis as crucial as ever in terms of assisting Governments\r\nin their efforts to comply with their development-goals\r\ncommitments. The joint spring meetings of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, the WTO and the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD) should continue to be an important\r\ninstrument to monitor the progress of the United\r\nNations system in this area of international\r\ncooperation.\r\nOur delegation would like to welcome the\r\ndecision of the eleventh session of the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development to move to a biennial cycle\r\nof work as an example of a coordinated approach to the\r\nimplementation of the outcomes of the major United\r\nNations summits and conferences. That decision, in our\r\nview, should facilitate a more meaningful assessment\r\nof progress in the follow-up to the outcomes of the\r\nmajor United Nations summits and conferences.\r\nWe also believe that an implementation review\r\nprocess should be used to reaffirm the goals and\r\nobjectives agreed upon at conferences and summits and\r\nto identify obstacles and constraints as well as actions\r\nand initiatives to overcome them. In this context, a\r\nmajor event to be held in 2005 to review the progress\r\nachieved in implementing all the commitments made in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration, as referred to by the\r\nGeneral Assembly in its resolution 57/270 B, would,\r\nwe hope, contribute to that process.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate our\r\nconviction that the United Nations should continue to\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nplay a critical role in ensuring steady progress towards\r\nforging global partnerships for development and the\r\nimplementation of the outcomes of global forums.\r\nMr. Jenie (Indonesia): Let me first thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on this important item\r\n(A/58/359). Also, we associate ourselves with the\r\nremarks made by the distinguished representative of\r\nMorocco on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe time has come for us to meet the challenges\r\nposed by the lack of progress in the implementation of\r\nthe outcomes of the major United Nations conferences\r\nand summits in the economic, social and related fields.\r\nWe must live up to the commitments made at the\r\nconferences and summits, where together we\r\nestablished internationally agreed development goals\r\naimed at eradicating poverty, achieving sustained\r\neconomic growth and promoting sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIndeed, solid platforms for action emerged from\r\nthose international gatherings to facilitate the\r\nachievement of development goals and targets,\r\nincluding the Millennium Declaration and the\r\noutcomes of the International Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. Thus, we must move from the phase of\r\ngoal-setting and commitment to the phase of concrete\r\nimplementation at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels. The international conferences and\r\nsummits also successfully engaged civil society, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, the private sector and\r\nother relevant stakeholders in the development process.\r\nAs stated in the Secretary General’s report, “They thus\r\nmarked the first crucial phase in the process of\r\nbringing development issues to the forefront of the\r\nmultilateral agenda” (A/58/359, para. 4).\r\nWith this background in mind, my delegation\r\nwelcomed resolution 57/270 B on the subject before us.\r\nWe believe that this comprehensive resolution should\r\nbe used for guidance and as the basis for the work of\r\nthe relevant United Nations bodies and other\r\nstakeholders responsible for implementing the\r\noutcomes of the conferences and summits.\r\nAt the national level, appropriate policies and\r\ndevelopment strategies are indeed crucial for achieving\r\nthe agreed development goals. The fact is that domestic\r\neconomies are interwoven with the global economic\r\nsystem; that underlines the need to establish an\r\nenabling international economic environment to\r\nsupport national development efforts. In fulfilling this\r\ngoal, it is important to stress, inter alia, the need to\r\nenhance partnerships between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries; the importance of strengthening\r\nthe coherence of the United Nations system, including\r\nthe Bretton Woods Institutions and the World Trade\r\nOrganization; and the need to engage other relevant\r\nstakeholders, including civil society and the private\r\nsector, in this process.\r\nThis holistic approach will necessarily require the\r\nformulation of a global strategy. In the context of the\r\nagenda item before us, such a move will be a step in\r\nthat direction. For that purpose, the initiative taken by\r\nthe Secretary-General to establish a high-level panel of\r\neminent personalities is certainly relevant and timely.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation takes this opportunity to\r\ncall on the high-level panel of eminent personalities to\r\nstrengthen efforts aimed at integrating and coordinating\r\nimplementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of\r\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits.\r\nOther United Nations bodies have equally important\r\nroles to play in this regard.\r\nThe General Assembly and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and its relevant functional commissions,\r\nacting as a three-tiered system for follow-up to and\r\nreview of the conferences, are all playing crucial roles\r\nin the implementation process. It is therefore important\r\nto ensure that each of those organs fully grasps the\r\nlinkages between the outcomes of the major United\r\nNations conferences and summits and, as part of a joint\r\neffort, contributes towards achieving an integrated\r\nframework for the implementation of the\r\ninternationally agreed development goals.\r\nFurthermore, it is essential to strengthen the links\r\nbetween policy development at the intergovernmental\r\nlevel and the operational work being undertaken at the\r\ncountry level by the funds, programmes and specialized\r\nagencies of the United Nations system, including the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\r\nOrganization. Such an approach will foster the greater\r\ncoherence of the whole range of activities and\r\nundertakings initiated by the funds, programmes and\r\nother relevant organizations and bodies of the United\r\nNations as they work towards the realization of the\r\noutcomes of the conferences and summits.\r\nTowards those ends, we should strive for greater\r\ncoherence and coordination in the work of the General\r\nAssembly, especially in plenary meetings and in the\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nSecond and Third Committees. That would ensure that\r\nthe system is fully equipped to effectively adopt an\r\nintegrated approach to follow up the outcomes of the\r\nconferences and summits.\r\nConcerning the programme of work of the Second\r\nCommittee, my delegation is of the view that the\r\nrestructuring and mainstreaming of its agenda needs to\r\nbe reflected in the framework for the integrated and\r\ncoordinated implementation of and follow-up to\r\nconference outcomes. That must be done without\r\ndiluting any agenda items, such as those concerning\r\ndebt, trade or financing for development, that are of\r\ncritical importance to developing countries.\r\nAnother positive measure that could aid the\r\nimplementation process is the possible comprehensive\r\nreview in 2005 of actions taken to achieve that goal. It\r\nis believed that such a major event would prove\r\npolitically attractive and powerful for Member States.\r\nAccordingly, the review process should be placed\r\nhigh on the agenda of the General Assembly,\r\ncoinciding with the decision taken at the fifty-seventh\r\nsession and taking into account the need to give more\r\nimportance, coherence and visibility to the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration. In that\r\nregard, I would like to stress that the importance of\r\nsuch a review should be viewed within the framework\r\nof the integrated and coordinated follow-up to the\r\noutcomes of major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits.\r\nIn achieving our objective, my delegation would\r\nlike to emphasize the crucial role of the General\r\nAssembly as the highest inter-governmental\r\nmechanism and the most important tool for the\r\nappraisal of policy on matters related to the integrated\r\nand coordinated follow-up to the major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits. The General Assembly must\r\nensure that the goal of integrating and harmonizing\r\npolicy guidance, based on the recommendation of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council as the coordinating\r\nmechanism of the functional commissions and\r\nspecialized agencies, is put into effect. Moreover, the\r\nGeneral Assembly should begin to enhance policy\r\ncoherence among the United Nations system, the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\r\nOrganization in achieving development goals,\r\nparticularly in eradicating poverty, promoting food\r\nsecurity and enhancing sustainable development.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to\r\nreaffirm that the focus must be on implementation,\r\nwhile preserving the thematic unity of each of the\r\nconferences and summits and their respective follow-\r\nup mechanisms. To gear up further, we should also\r\nseek to ensure that the implementation process\r\ncomplements the ongoing reform process of the United\r\nNations as a whole. However great the challenge may\r\nbe, one has to be optimistic in realizing those\r\nobjectives. It is our hope that we shall not move\r\nbackwards but display the political will to progress\r\nconsistently, as required by General Assembly in its\r\nresolution 50/227 on further measures for the\r\nrestructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in\r\nthe economic, social and related fields.\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): Jamaica associates itself with\r\nthe statement made by the representative of Morocco\r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China. We also join\r\nprevious speakers in thanking the Secretary-General\r\nfor his report on the integrated and coordinated\r\nimplementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of\r\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits in\r\nthe economic, social and related fields (A/58/359). The\r\nreport provides a useful assessment of the preliminary\r\nsteps being taken to implement resolution 57/270 B.\r\nThe adoption of that resolution marked an\r\nimportant step in support for the consensus on the need\r\nfor a sharper focus on implementation. It creates a\r\nframework for linking policy development at the\r\nintergovernmental level and operational activities at the\r\ncountry level. If we are to meet the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and ensure that concrete and\r\npractical efforts are made to achieve the various goals\r\nwe have set in the extensive set of conferences and\r\nsummits, all United Nations bodies should work in\r\nconcert to improve coordination in support of\r\nimplementation.\r\nWhile only four months have elapsed since the\r\nadoption of the resolution, we are pleased that, as\r\nindicated by Secretary-General, concrete steps are\r\nbeing taken in a number of areas both in the General\r\nAssembly and in the Economic and Social Council to\r\ngive effect to crucial decisions and recommendations.\r\nHowever, we would have liked to have been provided\r\nwith some detail with respect to the actual functioning\r\nof the follow-up mechanisms established in accordance\r\nwith chapter III of the Monterrey Consensus in order to\r\nfacilitate an in-depth analysis and assessment of the\r\nwork done to date. It is important that in future\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nsessions of the General Assembly special emphasis be\r\nplaced on providing such material.\r\nWith regard to further action to be taken by the\r\nGeneral Assembly during this fifty-eight session to\r\nsupport implementation of the resolution, we urge that\r\nevery effort be made to expedite consideration of the\r\nrevised indicative programme of work of the Second\r\nCommittee to allow a decision to be taken by the\r\nstipulated deadline in December 2003. It is important,\r\nhowever, that the question of restructuring the work of\r\nthe Committee be carefully addressed and that the\r\nquality of the deliberations and the effectiveness of the\r\nCommittee’s work not be negatively affected. It is\r\nparticularly important that issues of particular interest\r\nto developing countries and to the ongoing debate on\r\nglobal economic policy not be overshadowed in any\r\nway and continue to be given priority.\r\nWe welcome the recommendation for increased\r\nconsultation between the Presidents of the General\r\nAssembly and of the Economic and Social Council, and\r\nwe urge that concrete steps be taken to ensure the\r\ninstitutionalization of such contacts.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council has a central\r\nrole to play in providing oversight, and it remains the\r\nmost appropriate body for coordinating follow-up on\r\nthe implementation of the commitments made at major\r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits. There is a\r\nclear need for enhanced coherence, coordination and\r\ncooperation at the intergovernmental level between the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and intergovernmental\r\norganizations such as the Bretton Woods institutions\r\nand the World Trade Organization (WTO). The annual\r\nspring meetings between the Council, the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and the WTO should therefore be\r\nstrengthened, and we welcome the Council’s decision,\r\nin its resolution 2003/47, to invite representatives of\r\nthe Trade and Development Board of the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD) to participate in future sessions.\r\nIn order to improve the value of these exchanges,\r\nhowever, it is important that the outcomes of those\r\nmeetings provide concrete, action-oriented proposals\r\nwhich will have practical effect in the operation of\r\nthese bodies with respect to development issues. This\r\nwould facilitate more effective coherence and\r\npragmatic actions in support of follow-up, particularly\r\nof the Monterrey Consensus.\r\nIt is important in all of this that we do not lose\r\nfocus by over-concentration on analysis of themes and\r\ncross-cutting issues. We should not be converting the\r\nreview of implementation into a complicated academic\r\nexercise. To avoid this, the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil should maintain a special focus on monitoring.\r\nJamaica had supported the establishment of a separate\r\nmonitoring mechanism, but, since that was not\r\nforthcoming, it is hoped that the Council will fulfil that\r\nrole.\r\nIn this context, my delegation hopes that the\r\ndecision that the Economic and Social Council conduct\r\nreviews through the consideration of cross-sectoral\r\nthematic issues common to the conferences outcomes\r\nwill not detract from the need to monitor indicators and\r\nconcrete steps by all actors to meet specific targets. In\r\nthis respect, the Secretary-General and the Department\r\nof Social and Economic Affairs should support this\r\napproach by informing the Council of specific details\r\nand progress, or lack thereof, in relation to\r\ncommitments made at the major conferences. That\r\nwould enable the General Assembly to address\r\nconcrete challenges to implementation on an ongoing\r\nbasis.\r\nThe functional commissions have an important\r\nrole to play within their respective mandates to\r\nimprove the effectiveness of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil in follow-up. By better planning its work on\r\ncommon conference themes, the Council will be able to\r\nengage with the functional commissions. We expect\r\nthose commissions, in order fully to support the\r\nCouncil, urgently to review their working methods with\r\na view to directing greater attention to the outcomes of\r\nmajor conferences. We look forward to an early report\r\nfrom the Commissions to the Council on their efforts.\r\nWe believe that well-organized and effective\r\nreviews of major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits are vital for maintaining political momentum,\r\nraising awareness and assessing new challenges and\r\nconstraints to the implementation of commitments. We\r\nagree that the question of periodicity and of the format\r\nof reviews should be carefully considered on a case-by-\r\ncase basis. That approach should not, however, serve to\r\nfrustrate efforts to undertake much- needed reviews\r\nand ongoing assessments of the implementation of the\r\nconference and summit outcomes.\r\nThe holding of a major event during the General\r\nAssembly in 2005, which would ensure a\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\ncomprehensive review, is therefore welcome. It will\r\nrepresent an important opportunity for the international\r\ncommunity to take stock of the progress being made.\r\nThe ongoing work in ensuring implementation is one of\r\nthe important elements in the revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and therefore should be treated as a\r\nmatter of the highest priority.\r\nMr. Rao (India): We thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his report on the integrated and coordinated\r\nimplementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of\r\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits in\r\nthe economic, social and related fields. My delegation\r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the\r\nPermanent Representative of Morocco in his capacity\r\nas Chairman of the Group of 77.\r\nWe welcome the adoption by the General\r\nAssembly of resolution 57/270 B, which provides, in\r\nour view, a framework for the General Assembly to\r\nprovide political oversight to the implementation of\r\nand follow-up to the major United Nations conferences\r\nheld over the past decade.\r\nThe objective of any follow-up exercise should be\r\nto address the issue of implementation. The major\r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits have in their\r\noutcomes a set of well-defined targets and\r\ncommitments for which all Member States have\r\naccepted a shared responsibility. The implementation\r\nof outcomes would be a clear demonstration of the\r\nfulfilment of such shared responsibility and would\r\ncontribute immensely to the strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nFor the developing countries, the implementation\r\nof the outcomes of the major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits presents an enormous\r\nchallenge. They are not in a position to fulfil all the\r\ncommitments they undertook with respect to the\r\noutcomes of such events, especially as regards the\r\nMillennium Declaration, without further progress in\r\ninternational cooperation. The developed countries\r\nhave special obligations in the areas of official\r\ndevelopment assistance, debt relief and market access.\r\nReviewing the implementation of conference\r\noutcomes requires a two-pronged approach. First, it\r\nneeds an integrated and coordinated approach to the\r\noverarching goals common to all or many of the\r\nconferences. Secondly, it also requires a focused\r\nreview that seeks to retain the identity and integrity of\r\nevery major conference and to stimulate progress in the\r\nimplementation of agreements in the specific area or\r\nsector covered by each conference. The Economic and\r\nSocial Council and its functional commissions can play\r\na major role in addressing this task. To that purpose,\r\nthe Council will pursue the establishment of a multi-\r\nyear programme of work for the consideration of\r\nidentified cross-sectoral thematic issues.\r\nWe welcome the opportunity to assess the\r\nfunctioning of the follow-up mechanisms established\r\npursuant to the Monterrey Consensus. We would like to\r\nsee greater synergy between the annual meeting of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council with the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, the World Trade Organization (WTO) and\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) on the one hand and the\r\nbiennial high-level meeting of the General Assembly\r\non the other. Apart from the high quality of the\r\ndialogue in terms of issues addressed and level of\r\nspecificity, what we also require is an effective\r\nmechanism to assess the implementation of\r\ncommitments and agreements reached in the Monterrey\r\nConsensus.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General (A/58/359)\r\nspeaks in paragraph 11 of the need to establish a\r\nstronger link between policy guidance and operational\r\nactivities, as provided for in resolution 57/270 B. We\r\nwould, however, like to sound a note of caution in that\r\nregard. The principal foundation for the operational\r\nactivities of the United Nations development system is\r\ncountry-driven programming or, in other words, the\r\nUnited Nations system responding to the needs and\r\npriorities of the recipient countries. We believe that\r\nnothing should be done to undermine that principle.\r\nThe linkage provision should not be misused to thrust\r\ndonor-driven or Secretariat-driven agendas on the\r\ndeveloping countries. The only possible link would be\r\nto ensure that the activities of the funds and\r\nprogrammes in recipient countries advance the\r\nimplementation of the conference outcomes.\r\nOn the question of the review of the Second\r\nCommittee’s programme of work, my delegation would\r\nlike to point out that the exercise must not be seen in\r\nisolation but should be viewed as part of the efforts for\r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly. Any\r\ndecision that might be taken in the limited context of\r\nthe Second Committee should be subject to review in\r\nthe light of decisions that are adopted in the overall\r\nprocess of revitalization of the General Assembly and\r\nreform of the United Nations.\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nThe report presented by the Secretary-General\r\nthis year on the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration (A/58/323) contains several useful\r\nsuggestions. We agree with the proposal made by the\r\nSecretary-General for the holding of a major event in\r\n2005. Such an event should provide an opportunity for\r\na comprehensive review of the progress achieved in\r\nimplementing all the commitments made in the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nMr. Maalouf (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States welcomes the opportunity to speak on the\r\nintegrated and coordinated implementation and follow-\r\nup to the outcomes of the major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits in the economic, social and\r\nrelated fields. We strongly support the need to frame\r\nour work at the United Nations around the outcomes of\r\nthe major summits and conferences and we participated\r\nactively in the open-ended ad hoc working group on\r\nthis subject. We recall that the Secretary-General has\r\npointed out the urgent need for us to take a critical look\r\nat all of the General Assembly’s activities and ask\r\nourselves whether they are relevant to the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration and\r\nother conference outcomes and whether they have the\r\ndesired impact.\r\nWhile recognizing that the working group’s\r\nreport was only adopted in June and that it is therefore\r\nsomewhat premature to report on outcomes, we must\r\nnot lose sight of the fact that a number of fairly modest\r\nrecommendations came out of that group,\r\nrecommendations which can be acted on during this\r\nGeneral Assembly session. We are pleased that the\r\nbureaux of the Second and Third Committees have\r\ndiscussed overlap and duplication and are looking for\r\nways to take up, in a more coordinated manner, issues\r\nrelating to conference follow-up.\r\nAs stated in resolution 57/270 B, the Second\r\nCommittee is to consider its programme of work and\r\nmake a decision on it by December 2003. Members\r\nneed to bring the vision and commitments of the major\r\nsummits and conferences — such as the Millennium\r\nSummit, the Monterrey International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development and the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development — to the work of the Second\r\nCommittee. We need to move towards partnerships and\r\naction and away from sterile rhetoric and timeworn\r\nthemes.\r\nThe United States welcomes the mandate of\r\nresolution 57/270 B by which the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil functional commissions must examine their\r\nmethod of work in order to better pursue the\r\nimplementation of the outcomes of major United\r\nNations conferences and summits. The ongoing work\r\nof the Commission on Sustainable Development offers\r\nus an example that the other Economic and Social\r\nCouncil functional commissions may wish to consider\r\nfollowing. Last May, the Commission, at its eleventh\r\nsession, adopted a series of trail-blazing reforms.\r\nMembers agreed to limit the number of negotiations\r\nand to focus on how the international community —\r\nGovernments, international organizations, civil society\r\nand the private sector — can work together to achieve\r\nour ambitious and critically important objectives.\r\nTaken together, these steps will make the Commission\r\non Sustainable Development and the United Nations\r\nmore responsive and relevant to the needs of all,\r\nespecially developing countries.\r\nWe look forward to working constructively with\r\nother delegations to follow through on the challenging\r\ntask before us.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on this item for this meeting.\r\nAgenda item 51\r\n2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in\r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/58/136 and\r\nCorr.1)\r\nMr. Alessandro (Italy): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union. The acceding\r\ncountries Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia\r\nand Slovenia, the associated countries Bulgaria,\r\nRomania and Turkey and the European Free Trade\r\nAssociation country member of the European\r\nEconomic Area Norway align themselves with this\r\nstatement.\r\nThis important debate is yet another indication of\r\nthe attention that malaria control and prevention has\r\nreceived throughout the international community,\r\nparticularly after the World Health Organization,\r\ntogether with UNICEF, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and the World Bank, founded\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nthe Roll Back Malaria Partnership and since the\r\nholding of the Abuja Summit in 2000. Over the last\r\nfew years, we have seen a change in attitude that has\r\nplaced malaria high on the agenda of Governments,\r\ninternational organizations and development\r\nprogrammes. Through the Roll Back Malaria Initiative\r\nand the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\r\nMalaria, a new form of co-operative partnership has\r\nstarted between low-income countries and the donor\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe European Union warmly welcomes such\r\ndevelopments. We recognize the need for more\r\nresources to implement concrete actions, but, at the\r\nsame time, we must be aware that those resources are\r\nlimited and should be used primarily to create\r\ncontinuity in awareness and support. That means day-\r\nby-day support at the grass-roots level, involving\r\nGovernments, local communities and aid agencies in a\r\nparticipatory manner, in order to meet the targets\r\nagreed upon for the Decade to Roll Back Malaria.\r\nWe fully endorse the final declaration of the\r\nSecond Summit of the African Union, in which Heads\r\nof State and Government confirmed that the fight\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis is a\r\npriority for the continent. The burden of those diseases\r\nand their impact on the population are heavy, and they\r\ninevitably affect development initiatives planned\r\nwithin the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) and the Group of Eight Africa Action Plan.\r\nThis year, more than a million people will die\r\nfrom malaria. Many more will contract the disease. Of\r\nthe 500 million people suffering from malaria, 450\r\nmillion, representing 90 per cent of the total, are sub-\r\nSaharan Africa’s poorest citizens. In addition, we are\r\naware that malaria costs Africa from $10 billion to $12\r\nbillion annually in its gross domestic product. That\r\nincludes medical costs, missed schooling, lower\r\nproductivity, less foreign direct investment and lower\r\ntourism revenues. Moreover, malaria claims the lives\r\nof many African children every day. The European\r\nUnion expresses its deepest concern at this situation\r\nand its willingness to act to reverse it.\r\nTo end this cycle of suffering and poverty,\r\nGovernments and the private sector are accelerating\r\nmalaria research. As we pick up the pace on malaria\r\nresearch, we must also greatly expand existing\r\nprevention, care and treatment approaches, which are\r\nmutually dependent. Global funding to combat malaria\r\nwill require resources matching the scale of the crisis.\r\nApproximately $60 million a year is invested in\r\nmalaria research, and $200 million is spent annually to\r\ntreat impoverished patients and distribute mosquito\r\nnets and insecticides. In that regard, the European\r\nUnion is committed to strengthening and increasing\r\nfinancial support for research and development.\r\nAllow me to describe briefly the actions we have\r\nundertaken so far. Under the last European framework\r\nprogramme, covering the period 1998 to 2002, we\r\nimplemented 26 different research projects on malaria\r\nat a cost of more than 30 million Euros. Nearly 100\r\nresearch institutions, based in 15 African countries, 11\r\nEuropean countries and five Asian and South American\r\ncountries, participated in the project. Through that\r\npartnership to tackle malaria, we encourage\r\nstrengthened cooperation within the framework of\r\ninternational initiatives such as the European Malaria\r\nVaccine Initiative, the African Malaria Vaccine Trial\r\nNetwork and the new European-Developing Countries\r\nClinical Trial Partnership.\r\nFurthermore — following as well the\r\nrecommendations made in General Assembly\r\nresolution 57/294 on the Decade to Roll Back\r\nMalaria — last July the European Parliament and the\r\nEuropean Council adopted a regulation on assistance in\r\nfighting poverty-related diseases in developing\r\ncountries, namely HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.\r\nIn allocating funding and expertise, priority will be\r\ngiven to the least developed countries and the most\r\ndisadvantaged sections of the population. The financial\r\nframework for the implementation of this new\r\nregulation for the period 2003 to 2006 is set at 351\r\nmillion euros.\r\nThe European Union has also noted that, in spite\r\nof the fact that most of the key pharmaceuticals are off\r\npatent, few developing countries have sufficient\r\ncapacity to manufacture them. Moreover, for the time\r\nbeing, available drugs are not well suited for\r\ndeveloping countries, and malaria drugs are becoming\r\nless and less effective as a result of increased parasite\r\nresistance. We should therefore find new drugs\r\nappropriate to Africa’s special needs and take into\r\naccount local distribution problems and cold chain\r\navailability.\r\nIn that regard, we encourage interested parties,\r\nespecially the pharmaceutical industry, to promote\r\nsustainable local production for national and regional\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nmarkets, aiming at the transfer of technology. For that\r\nreason, the European Union and its member States\r\nfully endorse the Doha Declaration on the Agreement\r\non Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property\r\nRights and Public Health.\r\nMany African countries are working to fight\r\nmalaria, but they cannot do it alone. Like HIV/AIDS\r\nand tuberculosis, this disease requires a well\r\ncoordinated, comprehensive and consistent response,\r\nwhich is beyond the financial and human resources of\r\nmany developing countries. Because of their magnitude\r\nand transitional nature, poverty-related diseases require\r\na systematic response from the international\r\ncommunity. In that respect, we commend the proactive\r\nrole played by the United Nations and the World Health\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe believe public health is a public\r\nresponsibility. Actions targeting the poverty-related\r\ndisease must be carried out within the larger context of\r\nimproving health care systems in developing countries\r\nand making those systems accessible to all. Improving\r\nhealth care is a precondition for and a key element of\r\nsustainable development. The European Union is\r\ncommitted to providing partner countries with\r\nassistance consistent with their own development\r\nplans, thus taking into account the overall objectives of\r\nimproving the population’s health and reducing\r\npoverty.\r\nIf the international community is capable of\r\nbuilding a true global partnership with effective tools,\r\nand if developed and developing countries and the\r\npublic and private sectors are able to work together\r\ntowards this common goal, we strongly believe that\r\nmalaria can be definitively rolled back throughout the\r\nworld, as it has been in Europe.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): In his report contained\r\nin document A/58/136 the Secretary-General reveals\r\nthat, in 2005 — when we review the implementation of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals — he, in close\r\ncollaboration with the Director General of the World\r\nHealth Organization (WHO), will present to the august\r\nAssembly a progress report on the targets of the\r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries,\r\nparticularly in Africa.\r\nThe importance of that submission to the sixtieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly is underlined by the\r\nfact that, in Africa, an increasing number of deaths is\r\nbeing caused by malaria. It is in that context that heads\r\nof State or Government of the African Union, meeting\r\nin July at the Second Ordinary Session of the Assembly\r\nin Maputo, Mozambique, reaffirmed their commitment,\r\nenshrined in the Abuja Declaration and the plan of\r\naction adopted for the Roll Back Malaria Initiative. It\r\nis for that reason that my delegation thanks the\r\nSecretary-General for his report and welcomes this\r\ndebate.\r\nMr. Hoscheit (Luxembourg), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nMalaria continues to be a major public health\r\nproblem in Namibia, and thus warrants special\r\nattention in terms of monitoring trends and formulating\r\ncontrol strategies and prevention at all levels of the\r\nhealth care system and the community. According to\r\nhealth service statistics, an average of 450,000 malaria\r\ncases and 800 deaths from malaria are reported\r\ncountrywide annually. This amounts to an incidence\r\nrate of 248 per 1,000 population and a mortality rate of\r\n45 per 100,000 population per year. As one can expect,\r\nchildren under the age of five years and pregnant\r\nwomen are at higher risk of getting malaria and\r\nsuffering its consequences. Our efforts to combat this\r\ndisease are impeded by the problem of inadequate\r\nresources, compounded by the shortage of trained\r\npersonnel.\r\nIn addressing this problem, in 1991 the\r\nGovernment launched a comprehensive programme to\r\ncontrol malaria and other vector-borne diseases.\r\nThrough this programme a number of activities have\r\nbeen undertaken to improve disease management,\r\nincluding the training of health workers, intensification\r\nof house spraying and improved reporting through the\r\nhealth information system.\r\nWhile challenges remain, we have indeed made\r\nprogress. At the national level, the Government has\r\ndemonstrated its firm commitment to tackling the\r\nproblem of malaria by establishing a national malaria\r\ncontrol programme, appointing malaria control staff\r\nand allocating regular budgetary and logistical support.\r\nThe national policy and strategy on malaria was\r\nlaunched in 1995. That policy document describes the\r\ngoals, malaria control strategies and activities at all\r\nlevels of the health care system. It is also intended to\r\ninform both health workers and the general public\r\nabout the role they can play in reducing malaria\r\nmorbidity and mortality to the lowest possible level.\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nTo date, 2000 health workers have been trained in\r\nmalaria case management and microscopic diagnosis,\r\nwhich is believed to have markedly improved the\r\nquality of malaria diagnosis and treatment. It was\r\npossible to significantly improve the coverage and\r\nquality of spraying in the affected areas following a\r\nmajor input from the Government and our Roll Back\r\nMalaria partners.\r\nTo reduce the impact of malaria among the\r\nvulnerable population groups, about 20,000 children\r\nunder the age of five years and pregnant women have\r\nbeen provided with insecticide-treated nets in selected\r\nhighly affected areas. In order to mitigate the dreadful\r\neffects of malaria epidemics among affected\r\ncommunities, weekly malaria surveillance has been put\r\nin place. This has facilitated the detection of malaria\r\nepidemics at a relatively early stage. To facilitate the\r\nimplementation of malaria control in the country, a\r\nfive-year Roll Back Malaria strategic plan has been\r\nfinalized.\r\nOn 22 September 2003, high-level meetings of\r\nthe General Assembly were convened to mobilize\r\nefforts to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Today, we\r\nmeet to discuss yet another killer disease, which in\r\nmany African countries is claiming more lives than\r\nHIV/AIDS. This is a fact that needs to be emphasized\r\nas a rallying tool in the process of raising awareness\r\nand resource mobilization.\r\nMalaria is preventable, treatable and curable, as\r\nstated clearly in the report of the Secretary-General.\r\nOne can die from malaria only if and when not treated\r\npromptly and effectively. The challenge, then, is to\r\nassist the affected countries. The use of anti-malaria\r\ntools is widespread and common. Unlike the case of the\r\nAIDS virus, many African countries have access to\r\nanti-malarial drugs. However, the growing resistance to\r\ncurrent drugs compounds the problem. This is a\r\nchallenge that needs to be addressed now, together with\r\nthe question of affordability. We can achieve the Abuja\r\ntarget of 60 per cent coverage only when the new and\r\nimproved drugs are affordable.\r\nEfforts at the community level are crucial, and, as\r\npointed out in the Secretary-General’s report, home\r\ntreatment supported by public information and pre-\r\npackaging can assist substantially in reducing child\r\nmortality. Malaria affects the areas surrounding\r\naffected communities and their efforts towards\r\nsustainable development. In this context, research on\r\nenvironmental management for malaria control in\r\ndevelopment should be supported.\r\nWhile we continue to support ongoing research\r\nfor a vaccine, we call on the international community\r\nto support the efforts of the affected countries by\r\nproviding the tools, which are already available. In that\r\nconnection, we welcome and further encourage the\r\ntransfer of technology for the production of insecticide-\r\ntreated nets and efforts to increase access to anti-\r\nmalaria medicines. We view the transfer of this new\r\ntechnology as a firm beginning in effectively tackling\r\nmalaria in the affected African countries. Making\r\ngenerous contributions to the Global Fund to Fight\r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is one effective way\r\nof assisting the affected countries. We commend the\r\nefforts of the World Health Organization (WHO), the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and other\r\nRoll Back Malaria partners in mobilizing the business\r\ncommunity to take part in the global campaign against\r\nmalaria.\r\nWe welcome the increase in resources mobilized\r\nfor the Roll Back Malaria campaign, but more\r\nresources are needed to complement those of the\r\naffected countries.\r\nIn conclusion, the report before us contains\r\nrecommendations to the affected countries, the\r\ninternational community as a whole, and in particular\r\nthe private sector, in the fight against malaria. We urge\r\nthe implementation of those recommendations, so as to\r\nassist African countries in implementing the Abuja\r\nDeclaration.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nGeneral Assembly today is considering an item of great\r\nsignificance — the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in\r\nDeveloping Countries.\r\nMalaria’s socio-economic impact is not limited to\r\nthe African continent. Studies have shown that malaria\r\nis endemic in more than 100 countries, whose\r\npopulations represent 40 per cent of the total\r\npopulation of the world. Studies have also shown that\r\n90 per cent of those infected by the disease — whose\r\nnumber ranges from 300 million to 500 million\r\npeople — are Africans.\r\nRegrettably, children represent the majority of the\r\n3 million people who die from the disease every year.\r\nThis is particularly regrettable given not only the high\r\nrate of infection and death among adults and children,\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nbut also in view of the painful scientific fact that\r\nmalaria is curable if diagnosed and treated early. For\r\nthat reason, we must focus on the humanitarian, not the\r\ncommercial, aspect of dealing with this disease.\r\nReports indicate that the African continent\r\nrequires nearly $1 billion a year to combat malaria\r\neffectively. Reports indicate also that the financing\r\navailable is only about a quarter of what is needed. My\r\ndelegation therefore agrees with the statement in the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General that the level of\r\ninternational funding to combat malaria is inadequate.\r\nWe support his call to bolster governmental\r\nexpenditures in African countries with greater and\r\nmore comprehensive international funding.\r\nIf malaria, as facts have shown, is both a cause\r\nand a consequence of poverty, we cannot expect\r\ndeveloping countries to succeed in overcoming the\r\nhealth problems they face without a tangible increase\r\nin development assistance, including the alleviation of\r\nthe debt burden of those countries, to redirect more\r\nresources to health services, to promote prevention and\r\ntreatment programmes, and to improve general health-\r\ncare services in general.\r\nEvery 30 seconds a child dies of malaria. I\r\ntherefore call on all Governments, in particular the\r\ncommunity of donor States, to make some simple\r\ncalculations: how many children will have died during\r\nthe delivery of this statement? How many children will\r\ndie during the discussion of this item? How many\r\nchildren must die before the international community\r\nmoves to eradicate this disease?\r\nMalaria is not considered incurable. On the\r\ncontrary, there are means of treatment and prevention.\r\nAll that is required would be a reasonable percentage\r\nof what the world spends daily on armaments and on\r\nthe building of vast military arsenals.\r\nMs. Bahemuka (Kenya): My delegation\r\ncommends the Secretary-General and the Secretariat\r\nfor the documentation provided for this agenda item.\r\nMalaria is the second most deadly disease in\r\nAfrica, after the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Recognizing the\r\nmagnitude of the problem, the General Assembly, at its\r\nfifty-first session, appealed to the international\r\ncommunity and to non-governmental organizations to\r\nallocate substantial resources — especially through the\r\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\r\nMalaria — for developing countries, particularly in\r\nAfrica. The goal was to enable African countries fully\r\nto implement the plan of action adopted at Abuja for\r\nthe Roll Back Malaria initiative.\r\nWe are grateful indeed to the World Health\r\nOrganization and to the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund (UNICEF) for their joint efforts to compile a\r\nreport on malaria in Africa, which was released on\r\nAfrica Malaria Day, observed on 25 April last in a\r\ncoordinated launch in Nairobi; Washington, D.C.; and\r\nLondon. We also appreciate the efforts of the World\r\nBank and of other partners in resource mobilization\r\nand in financing the campaign against malaria.\r\nAt the national level, Kenya recognizes that good\r\nhealth is a prerequisite for the socio-economic\r\ndevelopment of any country. We are a signatory to the\r\nAbuja Declaration on Roll Back Malaria. We have\r\nresponded to the Abuja Declaration through the\r\nremoval of taxes and tariffs associated with insecticide-\r\ntreated net products. A National Malaria Strategy has\r\nbeen put in place and focuses on improving malaria\r\ncase management at all levels of the health sector;\r\nreducing the risks of malaria during pregnancy;\r\nincreasing the use of insecticide-treated nets and other\r\nvector-control technologies; and responding to malaria\r\nepidemics.\r\nThe National Malaria Control Council (NMCC)\r\nhas since been reconstructed to become the Inter-\r\nAgency Coordinating Committee. That Committee will\r\nbe a more effective political and financial management\r\ntool for soliciting and directing investment aimed at\r\nrolling back malaria in Kenya. The objective is to\r\nreduce morbidity and mortality caused by malaria by\r\n30 per cent among Kenya’s population by the year\r\n2006 and to sustain that improved level of control\r\nthrough 2010.\r\nSignificant resources to Kenya districts are now\r\nbeing mobilized though health sector reform. That\r\nreform will provide the framework and financing\r\nmechanisms for improved district-led support for\r\ncurative and preventive services. The Division of\r\nMalaria Control will support planning of district-led\r\nstrategies in concert with the national malaria strategy.\r\nIn order to enhance those efforts, the Government\r\nof Kenya, in collaboration with other stakeholders,\r\nintends to strengthen preventive and promotive health\r\ncare through malaria control, an expanded\r\nimmunization programme, integrated control of\r\nchildhood illness and the prevention of\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nenvironmentally related communicable diseases. We\r\nare also trying to strengthen curative health services so\r\nas to manage the top 10 killer diseases through the\r\nprovision of health personnel, drugs and equipment. In\r\naddition, Kenya would like to expand health insurance\r\ncoverage and access for all its citizens.\r\nNational efforts in the fight against malaria\r\nrequire international support through funding, capacity-\r\nbuilding and equipment. Kenya has drawn up a\r\nstrategic plan that has enabled us to benefit from the\r\nGlobal Fund. Such funds will be utilized to strengthen\r\nmalaria early-warning systems and studies in order to\r\nimprove detection of outbreaks and response to them.\r\nIn conclusion, we must work together with the\r\ninternational community to strengthen national\r\ninterventions in the fight against the major killer\r\ndiseases in developing countries. It is very urgent that\r\nour development partners honour their commitments by\r\ncontributing to the Global Fund to fight the three\r\nmaladies that continue to afflict developing countries.\r\nMr. Menan (Togo) (spoke in French): Last year,\r\nwhen the General Assembly was considering the item\r\nthat is before it today, the Togolese delegation strongly\r\nurged the international community to make every effort\r\nto attain the objectives set out in the framework of the\r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries,\r\nparticularly in Africa. From that perspective, and in\r\nkeeping with the views that we initially expressed,\r\nTogo believes that the Decade’s objectives should be a\r\ngenuine challenge for countries where malaria is\r\nendemic and for the international community to meet at\r\nall costs.\r\nIt is paradoxical that malaria, which everyone\r\nagrees is a disease that can be cheaply controlled and\r\ncured, remains one of the primary causes of death in\r\nAfrican countries, as indicated by statistics set out in\r\nthe report on malaria in Africa in 2003, published\r\njointly by the World Health Organization (WHO) and\r\nthe United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).\r\nAccording to those statistics, more than 3,000 children\r\nin Africa die from the disease every day.\r\nThe Secretary-General addresses that state of\r\naffairs in his report on implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration (A/58/323), when he notes\r\nwith bitterness that, despite the progress achieved with\r\nregard to children’s health in developing countries in\r\nthe 1990s, nearly 11 million children die each year\r\nbefore their fifth birthday, primarily from diseases that\r\ncan be easily prevented or treated, malaria among\r\nthem.\r\nHowever, it is encouraging to note that, because\r\nof the proclamation in 2001 of the Decade to Roll Back\r\nMalaria and the launching of the Roll Back Malaria\r\ninitiative three years earlier by WHO, UNICEF, the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and\r\nthe World Bank, preventing and fighting the disease are\r\nagain becoming top priorities at the national and\r\ninternational levels. That is also made clear in the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General (A/58/136), submitted\r\nto the General Assembly in keeping with the\r\nrecommendations contained in resolution 57/294,\r\nwhich the Assembly adopted at its last session. As the\r\nreport recalls, administering medicines and using\r\ninsecticide-treated mosquito nets are still the only\r\neffective ways to fight the disease.\r\nHowever, access to treated mosquito nets remains\r\nrelatively limited in Africa — despite notable recent\r\nefforts to bring mosquito nets into general use —\r\nbecause of their high cost, which is an obstacle to their\r\nwidespread use. That is why Togo commends the\r\nSecretary-General for his proposal to persuade\r\ncompanies that extract petroleum products on the\r\nAfrican continent to contribute to the Roll Back\r\nMalaria initiative in Africa by providing at greatly\r\nreduced cost the polymers used in manufacturing\r\nmosquito nets. We fervently hope to see the General\r\nAssembly endorse that recommendation as well as the\r\nothers contained in the aforementioned report.\r\nTo attest to Togo’s commitment to pursuing\r\nefforts aimed at promoting the health of the Togolese\r\npeople, despite the financial difficulties the country has\r\nfaced for more than 10 years, since the suspension of\r\nthe aid that it had received from its main development\r\npartners, the head of the Togolese State announced to\r\nUNICEF authorities in June the Togolese\r\nGovernment’s decision to lower customs tariffs on\r\ninsecticide-treated mosquito nets.\r\nHere, we should stress that, despite the scarcity of\r\ntheir resources and the problems of every kind that\r\nthey face, African countries are attempting to various\r\ndegrees to initiate health programmes that place\r\npriority on fighting malaria. Those countries are\r\nmindful of the need to increase national investments in\r\nthe health sector and to improve its management,\r\nparticularly through greater integration of anti-malaria\r\nactivities into their development efforts in the health\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nsector, in conformity with their commitments under the\r\nDeclaration and Plan of Action on the Roll Back\r\nMalaria in Africa initiative, adopted in Abuja, Nigeria,\r\nin 2000. However, they cannot succeed in that\r\nendeavour unless they receive adequate assistance from\r\nthe international community, as the report of the\r\nSecretary-General opportunely recalls.\r\nWith regard to pharmaceutical products,\r\naccording to a study by the Pasteur Institute in France,\r\nresearchers in areas where malaria is endemic have not\r\nbeen able to develop a viable remedy for all forms of\r\nthe parasites that are responsible for the disease. The\r\nstudy also states that one of the major difficulties\r\nconfronting researchers is fighting the great ability of\r\nmosquitoes — vectors of the parasite — to adapt to\r\ntreatments and that the parasites deposited by\r\nmosquitoes into the human organism are resistant to\r\nmedicines, whereas mosquitoes themselves develop\r\nresistance to insecticides.\r\nHowever, it is reassuring that research continues\r\nto make appreciable progress, as attested by a British\r\npharmaceutical group’s recent launching of a new\r\nproduct, called Lapdap, designed to fight the most\r\ndeadly form of malaria, which is the most widespread\r\nform in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet it seems that, if the\r\npolitical will prevails and if pharmaceutical companies\r\nare not too much bent on the frenetic quest for high\r\nprofits, the current efforts could sooner or later be\r\nsuccessful, both in discovering a treatment for all types\r\nof the parasites that cause the disease and in\r\ndeveloping a vaccine.\r\nIn this campaign against malaria, Togo, like other\r\nAfrican States, very much hopes that the international\r\ncommunity will not cease to support seriously affected\r\ncountries so that lives can continue to be saved and so\r\nthat the Decade to Roll Back Malaria will be able to\r\nreverse the trend of the disease.\r\nIn that way, the international community would\r\nrespond to one of the specific needs of Africa:\r\npromoting the health and well-being of our peoples.\r\nAnd above all, it could help to spare families in distant\r\nAfrica the tragic, wrenching scenes, often marked by\r\nthe death of a child simply because the parents did not\r\nhave enough money — which in many cases would be\r\nless than $1 — to buy the necessary drugs.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate the gratitude of\r\nmy Government to the United Nations agencies,\r\nparticularly the World Health Organization and the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund, as well as to the\r\nvarious foundations for their positive contribution in\r\nthe struggle to combat malaria. The Government of\r\nTogo urges donors to provide further support for the\r\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\r\nMr. Tekle (Eritrea): The Eritrean delegation takes\r\nthis opportunity to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\ninformative report (A/58/136) on agenda item 51,\r\nentitled “2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in\r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa”.\r\nMy delegation participates in this debate\r\nanticipating that the review of the first three years of\r\nthe 10-year programme will enable us to identify the\r\nobstacles that confronted us and the various means by\r\nwhich we can get rid of, or attempt to get rid of, those\r\nobstacles. It hopes that this exchange of views will\r\nenable us, if necessary, to readjust our programmes and\r\nto reorganize our priorities and approaches.\r\nUnlike HIV/AIDS, malaria is not a new\r\npestilence. Humanity has known and lived with it for\r\nmillennia. Although, fortunately, it has been\r\ncompletely eradicated in most parts of the world for at\r\nleast several decades, in some unfortunate areas it\r\ncontinues to kill or debilitate large sections of the\r\npopulation. Even worse, it has recurred in areas from\r\nwhich it had successfully been eradicated. Among the\r\nworst hit is the Horn of Africa, even though previously\r\nit had made progress, owing to several national\r\neradication programmes.\r\nThe statistical data are grim. In most of the\r\ncountries of the Horn of Africa, including Eritrea,\r\nalmost 30 per cent of the population is victim to\r\nmalaria. Worse, almost 70 per cent of the population\r\nlives in malaria-endemic areas. In Eritrea, the death\r\nrate among children hospitalized with malaria is about\r\n7.4 per cent.\r\nThe causes of the continued existence of malaria\r\nmay differ from area to area. In the Horn of Africa, the\r\nprimary reason for this calamity has been war —\r\nnever-ending war. Malaria has had at least as much\r\nimpact as HIV/AIDS on our economies, and in some\r\ncases it has had a more negative one, not only because\r\nof its debilitating effects on a much greater workforce,\r\nparticularly among the peasantry, but also because the\r\nmalaria-endemic areas are largely unavailable for\r\ncultivation. Indeed, in Eritrea malaria is the greater\r\nthreat.\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nThus, malaria is as much an economic threat as it\r\nis a health problem and has influenced socio-economic\r\ndevelopment programming in African countries. It is\r\nfor this reason that the Eritrean Government has, since\r\n1991, addressed the problem with the seriousness it\r\ndeserves, has given it high priority and is determined to\r\nwage an unremitting struggle against the plague.\r\nThe Government of Eritrea has, inter alia, taken\r\nthe following concrete measures in its war against\r\nmalaria.\r\nFirst, in addition to earlier efforts, the Ministry of\r\nHealth inaugurated a five-year malaria reduction\r\nprogramme for the period 2001 to 2005. The major\r\ngoal of this holistic programme adopted by the\r\nMinistry was to significantly control the further spread\r\nof the disease while, at the same time, preventing more\r\ninfection among vulnerable groups by the\r\nstrengthening of epidemiological surveillance. Its\r\nambition was to minimize the effects of malaria on the\r\ncapacities of the population by reducing mortality,\r\nmorbidity and the incidence of malaria by 80 per cent,\r\nand to reduce malaria epidemics by 90 per cent by the\r\nend of 2005. The programme is largely on course.\r\nSecond, it established the national malaria control\r\nprogramme, which is responsible for the formulation of\r\nmalaria control policies, plans and guidelines;\r\ncoordination and control of programmes; monitoring\r\nand evaluation of programme activities; and\r\ncoordination of technical assistance and research.\r\nThird, it has trained village health agents and\r\nassigned them to provide malaria control services at the\r\ngrass-roots level. These agents diagnose and treat\r\nsimple cases of malaria, disseminate awareness\r\ninformation, mobilize communities for environmental\r\nmanagement and identify vector-breeding sites close to\r\ncommunities. This is made possible through village\r\nmeetings and periodic seminars given by the village\r\nagents, and through the coordination of community\r\nparticipation in weekly environmental management\r\nactivities, including the draining and filling of breeding\r\nsites.\r\nFourth, through its regional and local offices, the\r\nGovernment provides insecticide-impregnated bed nets\r\nto the needy population. It is hoped that, by the end of\r\n2005, every household will have at least two such\r\nbednets.\r\nFifth, it employs combination therapy for the\r\ntreatment of the disease at all levels and has evolved a\r\ndetailed treatment regimen known as the Eritrean\r\nstandard treatment guidelines.\r\nSixth, it carries out indoor house-spraying\r\nactivities, albeit selectively, on the basis of a previous\r\nhistory of malaria in a given area and/or evidence of a\r\nsudden increase in other areas. This may, in some\r\ncases, include total coverage of villages in affected\r\nareas.\r\nSeventh, it routinely conducts tests of insecticide\r\nspraying to determine the susceptibility or resistance of\r\nthe vector to insecticides selected for vector control.\r\nEighth, it has developed and widely disseminated\r\neducational and awareness material in several Eritrean\r\nlanguages, including Arabic, Tigre and Tigrigna, and\r\nhas effectively used radio and television programmes,\r\nas well as village meetings, to that end.\r\nNinth, the Malaria Control Programme has also\r\nestablished a close collaborative relationship with\r\nrelevant Eritrean ministries including, in particular, the\r\nMinistries of Agriculture and Environment, and Land\r\nand Water, as well as the Meteorological Department,\r\nto ensure appropriate surveillance and to develop\r\nsensitive forecasting methods.\r\nIn its effort to control the scourge, the\r\nGovernment of Eritrea has been cooperating with, and\r\nhas received assistance from the United States Agency\r\nfor International Development, for its entomological\r\nresearch programme, an Italian cooperation project, the\r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) for the Roll Back\r\nMalaria programme, the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund (UNICEF) for the protection of children and\r\nthose countries which are supporting the HAMSET\r\nDisease Control Project, which deals with HIV/AIDS,\r\nmalaria, sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis.\r\nHowever, Eritrea recognizes that if the campaign\r\nagainst malaria is to succeed, it must transcend national\r\nboundaries and benefit from the creation of effective\r\ncooperative regional mechanisms, strategies and\r\nprogrammes. These are not yet in place.\r\nNeedless to say, the Eritrean Government will\r\nsteadfastly pursue the goals it has set for itself in its\r\nfive-year plan, which ends in 2005. The mission is\r\ngreat and the challenges and obstacles are many. Yet,\r\nthey would not be insurmountable if there were to be\r\npeace with justice, peace based on the rule of law,\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\npeace respecting good neighbourliness and peace\r\nanchored in good faith and trust. Unfortunately, the\r\nchances of achieving these ideals, too, seems to be\r\nremote.\r\nMr. Rajalingam (Fiji): Fiji commends the\r\nSecretary-General for the excellent report contained in\r\ndocument A/58/136, entitled “2001-2010: Decade to\r\nRoll Back Malaria in Developing Countries,\r\nParticularly in Africa”, and supports its\r\nrecommendations.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic has touched all corners\r\nof the globe. Its effects have devastated families,\r\neconomies and Governments. Whole generations may\r\nbe lost before we totally recover. Likewise,\r\ndevelopment strides gained in recent decades have\r\nbeen rolled back. Less mentioned but no less intense in\r\nits devastation is malaria.\r\nMalaria continues to plague parts of our region.\r\nAlthough our statistics seem relatively less alarming\r\nthan other regions, they have attracted global attention\r\nand resources. We do not believe this statistical\r\nindicator to be cause for complacency in taking\r\npreventative measures to ensure it does not reach\r\npandemic proportions. Nor indeed should a complacent\r\nattitude cause malaria to revisit those countries in the\r\nregion, such as Fiji, that have successfully rid its\r\ncitizens of this disease. Sadly, tuberculosis is one such\r\nravaging disease that has returned.\r\nWe acknowledge the intensive efforts of the\r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) in controlling this\r\ndisease as well as member Governments’ initiatives to\r\nfight the scourge. The WHO report contained in\r\ndocument A/58/136 is meticulous in its detail and\r\nstatistics. We are encouraged to see that the plan of\r\naction to roll back malaria is global in perspective and\r\nembraces all countries and regions, irrespective of size\r\nor extent of the endemic malaria. In our region, we feel\r\nconfident that the malaria project allocation of the\r\nGlobal Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria\r\nwill make a significant difference towards reaching the\r\nobjectives of the global programme.\r\nDeveloping countries are particularly vulnerable\r\nto the onset of any epidemic. They lack the industrial\r\nbase for pharmaceutical production to meet demands\r\nand lack readily available financial resources to buy the\r\nnecessary pharmaceutical products from\r\nmanufacturers. Typically, when a disease reaches\r\nepidemic proportions, it is also accompanied by\r\nopportunistic, often deadly, companion infections or\r\ndiseases which are equally potent in impact.\r\nThe WHO report has allowed us to reflect on the\r\ngrim picture of the malaria pandemic in Africa.\r\nAlongside the plaguing effects of HIV/AIDS in Africa,\r\nclearly the eradication, or at least alleviation of such\r\npandemics depends on development. The Global Fund\r\nto fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is only one\r\navenue — groundbreaking as it is — that is making it\r\npossible for African countries to access funds for\r\nmalarial control commensurate with the severity of\r\ntheir needs.\r\nClearly, the implementation of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development could strengthen\r\nthis fight. Other financing alternatives, such as debt\r\nswaps, form a sound basis for consideration by the\r\nUnited Nations and WHO, in partnership with the\r\nBretton Woods institutions. The private sector and\r\nindustry need to nurture and contribute to this\r\nprogramme.\r\nThe contributions of non-governmental\r\norganizations are also acknowledged. Assistance\r\nprovided by non-governmental organizations such as\r\nthe Sovereign Military Order of Malta, in setting up\r\nsleeping sickness clinics in the Southern Sudanese\r\ntown of Yei, is noteworthy.\r\nMany other contagious and preventable diseases\r\nare affecting developing countries. In Fiji, filariasis,\r\ndengue, leprosy and diabetes have ravaging impacts\r\nand the incidence of tuberculosis is increasing. Care,\r\ntreatment and upstream prevention need to be\r\nextensively addressed by WHO and other stakeholders.\r\nMr. Olhaye (Djibouti): With the advent of\r\ninformation technology and instant communications,\r\nour world appears to have gone from a state of\r\ninformation awareness and knowledge, to one of\r\ninformation overload and virtual ignorance.\r\nConsequently, many concerns deserving the attention\r\nof the international community are driven from public\r\nview in the competition for attention being waged by a\r\nvast number of issues. The global fight against\r\nterrorism in all its various forms, the recent wars in\r\nAsia, particularly in Afghanistan and Iraq, and those\r\nplaguing the continent of Africa, as well as the\r\nspreading scourge of the HIV/AIDS crisis, are but a\r\nfew of the more pressing issues which have combined\r\nto push malaria below the radar of public concern. Not\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nsurprisingly therefore, the disease remains a dangerous\r\nthreat to millions of people.\r\nThe effort to combat malaria figures prominently\r\nin the Millennium Development Goals, which seek to\r\nhalt and reverse the incidence of this disease and other\r\nmajor diseases by 2015.\r\nThe General Assembly, by its resolution 57/294,\r\ndeclared 2001-2010 as the “Decade to Roll Back\r\nMalaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in\r\nAfrica”. The resolution called for support of the\r\nSecretary General’s recommendations, contained in\r\ndocument A/57/123. What we are seeking in this and\r\nother relevant meetings is an update on the status of the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations in the General\r\nAssembly resolution.\r\nImplementing the recommendations would, of\r\ncourse, take place in a real-world situation, and here\r\nthe actual facts are startling. The latest report of the\r\nSecretary-General on implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration highlights disturbing statistics\r\nrelating particularly to sub-Saharan Africa. Clearly,\r\nAfrica represents the major focus of the malaria crisis.\r\nTo its credit, Africa has recognized that fact. The\r\nAbuja Declaration of 2000 set targets and called on\r\nAfrican States and their partners to allocate new\r\nresources — at least $1 billion per year — for\r\ncombating the disease. The Africa malaria report of\r\n2003 was released on 25 April 2003, Africa Malaria\r\nDay, and took stock of the malaria situation.\r\nObviously, funds set aside for malaria must\r\nincrease. A meagre $200 million was spent worldwide\r\nin 2002, as against the $1 billion recommended for\r\nAfrica alone. But perhaps more critical than the sheer\r\nprovision of funds is the need for Governments in\r\nAfrica to be engaged and to enhance the capacity of\r\nmanpower. The international community must transfer\r\nnew technology to developing countries, particularly\r\nfor the production of long-lasting insecticide nets, and\r\nways must be found to increase the availability of\r\ncombination drugs for multi-drug-resistant malaria.\r\nAs with HIV/AIDS, the roles of both prevention\r\nand treatment loom large for malaria. It appears that\r\nthousands of lives can be saved, particularly children,\r\nsimply through the effective use of insecticide-treated\r\nbed nets. Usage is restricted, however, due to the high\r\ncost of those nets. Those costs could be lowered by a\r\nreduction in the high tariffs and taxes levied on them\r\nwithin Africa. With the resulting lower prices, more\r\npeople would be able to afford the nets, which would\r\nstimulate market potential for commercial production.\r\nThe result would be a low cost but highly effective\r\nmethod for reducing the incidence of malaria among\r\nusers.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General is quite\r\npositive about the potential of long-lasting insecticidal\r\nnets, which are factory pre-treated and require no\r\nfurther treatment during a projected four to five years\r\nof usage. While the nets are considered to be a major\r\nbreakthrough in the prevention of malaria, global\r\nproduction is inadequate. The report recommends that\r\nan additional five to ten factories be constructed in\r\nAfrica at strategic locations in the next few years. Even\r\nmore promising, the long-lasting insecticide nets are\r\nmade from polymers derived from petroleum. Oil\r\ncompanies in Africa could therefore be encouraged to\r\nmake those polymers available either free or at a low\r\ncost.\r\nThe importance of long-lasting insecticide nets\r\nrises considerably when we examine the growing\r\nimmunity and resistance of malaria parasites,\r\nparticularly to the major malaria drug, chloroquine.\r\nDeveloping new treatments are therefore critical. The\r\nWorld Health Organization recommends the use of\r\nartemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), which\r\nappears very promising aside from its relatively high\r\ncost and limited operational experience in Africa. One\r\npharmaceutical company is said to be making ACT\r\navailable at cost. Others must follow, along with donor\r\nGovernments, to explore strategies for making ACT\r\navailable at the lowest cost.\r\nFor many reasons, people in sub-Saharan Africa\r\ncover the cost of malaria prevention and treatment out\r\nof their own pockets. More important though, is the\r\nfact that, given the inevitably low level of knowledge,\r\nawareness and information — all tied to poor\r\ncommunications and public education — there is little\r\nguidance on quality, safety or appropriateness. Public\r\neducation is critical.\r\nPerhaps the essential fact to note is the\r\nconclusion of the Secretary General’s report that\r\nmalaria is treatable, preventable and curable. That can\r\nbe seen by the zero- to low-level incidence in many\r\nareas of the world where malaria has been eradicated.\r\nMajor advances are possible in many countries simply\r\nby utilizing existing tools. Developing new tools, such\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nas a vaccine, deserves continued support, although they\r\nmay be years away. While progress is being made,\r\nmeasured against our targets and recommendations, it\r\nis too slow. The creation of the Global Fund to Fight\r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is a major\r\nbreakthrough and holds the potential of access to funds\r\nfor malaria control commensurate with needs. Such\r\nfunds would be well spent given that macro-economic\r\nanalysis indicates that the net return on investment in\r\nmalaria control is substantial and far exceeds the initial\r\ninvestment in terms of improved economic\r\nperformance and reduced poverty.\r\nFinally, it would be a travesty to discuss the\r\nprevention and treatment of malaria in Africa without\r\nnoting the remarkable private efforts of the Bill and\r\nMelinda Gates Foundation. While it is true that the\r\nFoundation is the most highly funded in the world,\r\nwhat stands out is not the size of the largesse of those\r\nindividuals but the intensity of their personal focus and\r\nconcern for the lives and well-being of the global poor.\r\nAs one American newspaper notes, the Gates have\r\nplaced huge bets on big, difficult scientific problems.\r\nThey have committed more than $126 million to\r\nfinding an AIDS vaccine and have put some $150\r\nmillion into the development of a malaria drug.\r\nRecently, they personally trekked to a remote clinic in\r\nMozambique to announce the largest grant in history\r\nfor malaria research, using the occasion to highlight\r\nmalaria’s toll of more than 1 million children dead each\r\nyear, mostly in Africa. They recently awarded a $28\r\nmillion grant for a huge series of tests for a technique\r\nwhich, if successful, could cut malaria deaths by half in\r\nAfrica.\r\nUnderstandably, much of the world shares with\r\nthe Gates a lack of understanding about why other\r\npeople and their Governments do not share their sense\r\nof urgency. We hope more Governments and\r\norganizations will join this noble cause to eradicate one\r\nof humanity’s scourges from the face of the earth.\r\nMr. Zenna (Ethiopia): At the outset, I would like\r\nto extend my sincere appreciation and thanks to the\r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report entitled\r\n“2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in\r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa”\r\n(A/58/136 and Corr.1). My delegation fully concurs\r\nwith the recommendations contained therein.\r\nIt goes without saying that Africa, the most\r\nmarginalized region in the world, suffers from various\r\nsocial and economic deprivations which claim the lives\r\nof millions of people each year. Also, it has always\r\nbeen the case that dismal economic growth, hunger,\r\nfamine and disease are customary terms to describe the\r\nmisery of this continent.\r\nWhen one speaks of diseases in Africa, it is\r\nhardly possible to fail to mention malaria. Although\r\nmalaria is a global health problem, it remains the\r\ndisease of the impoverished, mostly in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica. The major changes in the eco-epidemiological\r\nsystem that frequently occur in different parts of the\r\ncontinent, the premature termination or unplanned\r\ninterruption of antimalarial measures in epidemic-\r\nprone areas and population movements due to the\r\nrequirements of seasonal workers, refugees or\r\nmigration for different reasons are the major causes of\r\nthe outbreak of this epidemic in the region.\r\nEthiopia is no different from other African\r\ncountries that are severely affected by the disease. The\r\nepidemic has proved to be a major public health and\r\neconomic problem in Ethiopia, in which 40 million\r\npeople are at risk of the disease, with approximately 4\r\nto 5 million cases reported annually. The disease is on\r\nthe top of the list of the major killer diseases in the\r\ncountry and accounts for a significant number of\r\noutpatients. Recurring large-scale drought and\r\nsubsequent malnutrition seem to create a conducive\r\nenvironment for the onset and spread of the epidemic\r\nin various regions of the country. According to a high-\r\nlevel delegation of the World Health Organization that\r\nrecently visited the drought-affected areas in Ethiopia,\r\nthe onset of the malaria epidemic will increase during\r\nthe next couple of months. Furthermore, according to\r\nthe same report, if the proper measures are not taken,\r\ntens of thousands of people will certainly die of the\r\nepidemic.\r\nIn an effort to combat the spread of this epidemic,\r\nthe Government, to the best of its resource capability,\r\nis trying to take the necessary measures. In addition to\r\nhaving signed on to the global campaign to fight\r\nmalaria, it has launched its own five-year country\r\nstrategic plan for malaria control. In collaboration with\r\ninternational organizations such as the World Health\r\nOrganization, UNICEF and others, efforts are under\r\nway to target the most vulnerable section of the\r\npopulation, namely pregnant women and children in\r\nrural areas, and launch a wider campaign to fight the\r\nspread of the epidemic. The Secretary-General’s report\r\nstates that “the bottlenecks that impede effective\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nresource flows for malaria have now been identified\r\nand malaria control is back on the Government agenda”\r\n(A/58/136, para.21).\r\nApart from what I briefly touched on at the\r\nbeginning of my speech about the difficulties that our\r\ncontinent of Africa is facing, the pain and sacrifice in\r\novercoming the horrific situation in the region is\r\nbecoming unbearable. Being aware of this menace, the\r\ninternational community, at the dawn of the new\r\nmillennium, has taken the initiative of alleviating the\r\nmajor challenges that impede the growth of the region\r\nby setting various development goals. To that end,\r\ndiseases that are pervading the African region have\r\nbeen recognized as barriers that hamper prosperity.\r\nAccordingly, the international community has stressed\r\nthe importance of solidarity in tackling the problem.\r\nThat commitment to mitigate the effects of the\r\nepidemic is embodied in the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. The establishment of the Global Fund to Fight\r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is an important and\r\nencouraging endeavour by the international community\r\nto support poor countries in their effort to make\r\nprogress in malaria control. Ethiopia, one of the\r\nbeneficiaries of the Global Fund, calls on the\r\ninternational community, especially partners among the\r\ndeveloped countries, to increase the flow of financial\r\nsupport to the Fund. We believe that such cooperation\r\nis in line with the political commitment of our partners\r\nto help realize the dream of stopping the global spread\r\nof malaria.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker on this item. The General\r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 51.\r\nAgenda item 160\r\nGlobal road safety crisis\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General (A/58/228)\r\nDraft resolution A/58/L.3\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Oman to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/58/L.3.\r\nMr. Al-Hinai (Oman): The General Assembly is\r\nfor the very first time discussing another rapidly\r\ngrowing epidemic — that of globa road l traffic deaths\r\nand injuries. The Secretary-General’s report (A/58/228)\r\ncontains very alarming statistics. It was just over a\r\nhundred years ago that the first road traffic death\r\noccurred. Today, approximately 3,000 people\r\nworldwide are killed daily as a result of road crashes,\r\nwhile thousands more are injured, some never again to\r\nlead productive lives. It is also alarming that this\r\nburden falls disproportionately on developing\r\ncountries, where roads are becoming more congested\r\nwith vehicles and people every day.\r\nBut, let us not lose hope. The battle is not lost.\r\nWe can do something about it. I am optimistic that we\r\ncan get this plague under control. I am optimistic for\r\ntwo reasons: first, because we have an unprecedented\r\nunderstanding of the dynamics of road crashes and,\r\nsecondly, because we have a broad range of effective\r\ninterventions to prevent them.\r\nLet me first say a word about the predicted rapid\r\nrate of increase in road deaths in the developing world.\r\nThis is a man-made plague, and we understand very\r\nwell why the deaths and injuries have been increasing\r\nin low- and middle-income countries. What makes this\r\nplague different from AIDS and the Severe Acute\r\nRespiratory Syndrome (SARS) is that we can both\r\nunderstand and control this problem.\r\nIn developing countries, the victims of road\r\ncrashes are the most vulnerable people, the vulnerable\r\nroad users. Most of the victims of road traffic injuries\r\nand deaths are pedestrians, a contrast to the situation in\r\ndeveloped countries, where the victims are mostly the\r\ndrivers and passengers of automobiles. Owing to the\r\nstricter manufacturing standards imposed on car\r\nmanufacturers in the developed countries, those\r\npassengers and drivers are actually very well protected\r\nby the steel frame of the vehicles in which they are\r\nriding.\r\nIn developing countries, pedestrians and\r\nbicyclists are the most vulnerable road users; they have\r\nno protection. Mothers carrying babies walk between\r\nrapidly moving buses, cars and trucks, while traffic\r\nsigns, which are rare, are often ignored even when\r\npresent.\r\nCars in developing countries are much more\r\nlikely to kill a person than cars in the developed\r\ncountries. In some developing countries, cars are up to\r\n200 times more lethal than in developed countries.\r\nFurther, we also know that car manufacturers plan to\r\nincrease production and exports to the developing\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nworld. As the number of vehicles increase, so will the\r\nnumber of deaths and injuries — unless we take action.\r\nFrom this, we can understand the rate of growth\r\nof this epidemic. It is a scientific fact that we live in a\r\nworld that is based on cause and effect. When we\r\nunderstand the causes, we can control the effects. In\r\nthis case, we understand exactly what is behind the\r\nincreasing rates of death, and that gives us an\r\nadvantage in addressing the problem. Hence, my first\r\nreason for optimism.\r\nThe second reason for my optimism is the new\r\nway of thinking about road safety. The historical view\r\nhad been that the way to prevent traffic deaths was\r\nsimply to warn drivers and pedestrians to be careful.\r\nWe thought that prevention meant getting the word out\r\nto people and educating them about safe procedures. In\r\nthat view, education was really the only tool we had for\r\nprevention. We now realize that there are many other\r\nactions we can take, and that responsibility rests not\r\nonly with individuals, but it should be a responsibility\r\nshared across many sectors and levels in our countries.\r\nA more advanced approach to road safety has\r\nbeen developed, one that recognizes that the driver, the\r\nvehicle and infrastructure are three components of a\r\ndynamic system. That approach recognizes that there\r\nare many things we can do to prevent road crashes. A\r\nsystems-based approach seeks to identify all the\r\nsources of error and design that contribute to road\r\ncrashes, and then tries to mitigate the consequences.\r\nThat systems-based approach suggests that, first, we\r\ncan look at roadways and make changes. For example,\r\npedestrians and people in non-motorized vehicles are\r\nnot separated from fast-moving traffic. Many roads do\r\nnot have barriers, or even white lines down the middle,\r\nto separate lanes of traffic. Communities should have\r\nroadways that circle villages or towns, rather than just\r\npass right through them. Blind spots that limit visibility\r\ncan be eliminated, and rumble strips can be added to\r\nroads to reduce speed.\r\nNext, we can make design changes in vehicles.\r\nMany vehicles may be very old and lacking safety\r\nfeatures such as collapsible steering columns and\r\nengine blocks that absorb impacts by crushing like an\r\naccordion. Those features — and others such as\r\nseatbelts, child-safety seats, airbags and lights to\r\nincrease visibility — can be added to modifications to\r\nthe front ends of vehicles to minimize injury to\r\npedestrians.\r\nWe can also look at human behaviour and make\r\nchanges. Laws can be written and enforced that\r\nseverely penalize drivers for speeding or driving under\r\nthe influence of drugs or alcohol. Laws and their\r\nenforcement can be supported, starting at the top levels\r\nof Governments and down through community levels,\r\nand taught at an early age in school.\r\nOn behalf of its sponsors — Algeria, Australia,\r\nAzerbaijan, Bahrain, China, Cuba, Ecuador, Grenada,\r\nIran, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Pakistan, Panama,\r\nQatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sudan, Switzerland,\r\nSyria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, the United\r\nStates, Yemen and Oman — I now have the honour to\r\nintroduce the draft resolution on the global road safety\r\ncrisis, which is contained in document A/58/L.3. Since\r\nthe issuance of the draft resolution, the following\r\nadditional countries have joined the list of sponsors:\r\nArmenia, Argentina, Belgium, Costa Rica, the\r\nDominican Republic, France, Greece, Iceland, Italy,\r\nKenya, Nauru, Portugal, the Republic of Moldova, the\r\nRussian Federation, Singapore and Trinidad and\r\nTobago.\r\nIn order to raise greater awareness of the\r\nmagnitude of the road-traffic injury problem, the\r\nsponsors are calling for a plenary meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to be held on 14 April 2004 to bring\r\ntogether Government representatives and experts to\r\ndiscuss this issue. That meeting will be held in\r\nconjunction with World Health Day, which will be\r\nobserved on the 7 April 2004, and the World Health\r\nOrganization’s launching on that day of its World\r\nReport on Road Traffic Injury Prevention.\r\nIn conjunction with that plenary meeting, the\r\nsponsors are requesting that a meeting be organized to\r\nallow the private sector, relevant non-governmental\r\norganizations, members of civil society and other\r\ninterested parties to exchange information on best\r\npractices regarding road safety. The sponsors are also\r\ncalling for the Economic and Social Council to\r\nfacilitate the exchange of information on best practices\r\nregarding road safety and to make recommendations\r\nfor road traffic injury control. It is expected that the\r\noutcome of the exchange of information between the\r\nEconomic and Social Council’s regional commissions\r\nand other relevant organizations and agencies of the\r\nUnited Nations system and the exchange of views that\r\nwill take place at the 14 April 2004 meeting will form\r\nthe basis of the report of the Secretary-General to be\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly at its sixtieth\r\nsession.\r\nI would like to express my deep gratitude to the\r\nrepresentatives who participated in the many informal\r\nmeetings we held and who offered constructive\r\nsuggestions, amendments and advice.\r\nI am honoured to recommend draft resolution\r\nA/58/L.3 for adoption by the General Assembly.\r\nIn conclusion, catastrophic road crashes are not a\r\nnecessary product of development. Motorized vehicles\r\nrepresent positive progress for people and allow us to\r\ndevelop economically and as a society. We can ensure\r\nthat, as our nations move people and goods to foster\r\ndevelopment and commerce, we do it safely. For my\r\ndelegation, this represents an extraordinary opportunity\r\nfor all of us to help reach that goal — an opportunity to\r\nmake a difference in the lives of men, women and\r\nchildren around the world.\r\nMr. Suhaili (Malaysia): At the outset, my\r\ndelegation would like to commend the delegation of\r\nOman for its initiative in raising this important\r\nquestion as an agenda item of the General Assembly.\r\nWe extend our sincere appreciation in particular to\r\nAmbassador Fuad Al-Hinai, Permanent Representative\r\nof the Sultanate Oman to the United Nations, for his\r\nuntiring efforts and dedication in pursuing this matter.\r\nMy delegation would also like to acknowledge the role\r\nand contributions of Member States and relevant\r\nagencies of the United Nations, non-governmental\r\norganizations and members of civil society to this\r\ninitiative. We welcome the publication of the inaugural\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the global road\r\nsafety crisis (A/58/228). We support the\r\nrecommendations contained in the report, most of\r\nwhich have been, and are being, implemented by\r\nMalaysia.\r\nAccording to statistics compiled by the World\r\nHealth Organization (WHO), road traffic accidents\r\nworldwide have resulted in the deaths of over 1 million\r\npeople and caused injury and disability to more than 10\r\nmillion others on an annual basis. In 2000 road traffic\r\naccidents constituted the ninth leading cause of death.\r\nSuch a horrific situation affects both developed and\r\ndeveloping countries. However, 88 per cent of those\r\ndeaths and injuries have occurred in developing\r\ncountries. Furthermore, it is estimated that at least 6\r\nmillion people will die and 60 million others will be\r\ninjured or disabled in developing countries over the\r\nnext 10 years as a result of road traffic accidents.\r\nThose figures warrant serious and urgent attention and\r\na concerted global effort to tackle and reverse such a\r\nlargely preventable cause of death and injury.\r\nIn Malaysia over 200,000 cases of road traffic\r\naccidents were reported in 2002 alone. Those cases\r\nresulted in the loss of nearly 6,000 Malaysian lives.\r\nThe fatality rate due to these accidents in 2002 stood at\r\na rate of 4.9 deaths per 10,000 registered vehicles.\r\nConsequently, total losses to the gross national product\r\narising from that situation amounted to $1.42 billion.\r\nThe Government of Malaysia has maintained a\r\nlong-standing and abiding commitment to address this\r\nproblem, in the interest of saving lives and managing\r\nvaluable resources required for development. The\r\nNational Road Safety Council of Malaysia was\r\nestablished in 1962. Through the National Council, the\r\nGovernment of Malaysia continues to undertake\r\nvarious efforts to reduce the number of road traffic\r\naccidents and to promote road traffic safety\r\nconsciousness among road users and the general public.\r\nThe Council has set a target of reducing fatalities to a\r\nrate of 4 per 10,000 registered vehicles by 2010. In\r\npursuing that objective, in 1997 Malaysia launched a\r\nnationwide road traffic safety campaign and awareness\r\nprogramme premised on the concept of the “three Es”,\r\nwhich stands for education, enforcement and\r\nengineering. That campaign has been quite effective in\r\nreducing the number of road accident fatalities to 5,886\r\ndeaths in 2002. Malaysia will continue to make serious\r\nefforts to further reduce that figure.\r\nAside from efforts at the national level, Malaysia\r\nis an active participant at the regional and international\r\nlevels in formulating strategies for the development\r\nand sustainability of road infrastructure. Among other\r\nthings, those strategies are aimed at reducing road\r\ntraffic accidents by constructing better, safer and more\r\nroad user-friendly infrastructure and by promoting and\r\nensuring efficient maintenance of road infrastructure.\r\nMalaysia is involved in the World Bank Group’s\r\nGlobal Road Safety Partnership, the World Road\r\nAssociation, the Land Transport and Safety Committee\r\nof the Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN), the Road Engineering Association of Asia\r\nand Australasia and ASEAN’s Sub-working Group on\r\nRoad Transport and Road Safety. We believe that the\r\nconsultations in, and experiences gained through, those\r\nand other forums have, and will continue to be, useful\r\nin the collective efforts to address this issue at the\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nregional and international levels. That would also be in\r\naccordance with one of the conclusions contained in\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General submitted under\r\nthis item.\r\nThe statistics on deaths, injuries and disabilities\r\ncaused by road traffic accidents must be a cause of\r\ngrave concern to us. They are a burden on our human\r\nconscience and a subject of concern because of their\r\ndestructive and multidimensional impact on the\r\neconomic and social well-being of our societies. The\r\nloss of even one human life and the disabilities caused\r\nby road traffic accidents have a rippling negative effect\r\non individuals, families and societies. It is equally\r\nheart-rending for anyone to learn of the loss of dear\r\nfriends and family members — be it a teenager\r\ninvolved in an illegal motorcycle race on the streets of\r\nKuala Lumpur, a family returning from vacation\r\nsomewhere in Greece or a busload of passengers killed\r\nin a ravine somewhere in Pakistan. Initially, such\r\naccidents immediately and drastically affect family and\r\nsocial units, both emotionally and psychologically.\r\nSubsequently they have a gradual effect on the larger\r\ncommunity and on the country as a whole, owing to the\r\nhuman, economic and social losses involved.\r\nAccording to studies conducted by the World\r\nHealth Organization, Harvard University and the World\r\nBank, it is anticipated that by 2020, if left unchecked,\r\nroad traffic accidents will advance to become the\r\nsecond leading cause of death and disability in the\r\nworld. The inclusion of this item in the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is very timely, especially given that\r\nroad safety will be the theme and focus of World\r\nHealth Day in 2004. Malaysia supports the adoption of\r\nthat theme to mark the start of a global campaign for\r\nroad traffic safety. We also support the draft resolution\r\nbefore the Assembly on this item.\r\nRoad traffic accidents have affected, and continue\r\nto affect, each and every one of us in one way or\r\nanother. The United Nations has an important role to\r\nplay in leading international efforts to address this\r\nhighly preventable but deadly public safety problem.\r\nRest assured that, within our means and capacity,\r\nMalaysia stands committed to make its contribution in\r\nthat regard.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nThe Chinese delegation supports the consideration by\r\nthe current session of the General Assembly of the\r\nagenda item entitled “Global road safety crisis”. I wish\r\nto avail myself of this opportunity to register our\r\ngratitude to the Permanent Mission of Oman for this\r\ninitiative. I would also like to thank Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan for the informative report (A/58/228) that\r\nhe has submitted to the General Assembly under this\r\nitem.\r\nAccording to the report of the Secretary-General,\r\nroad traffic injuries have become a public health crisis\r\nof global dimensions. In 2000, 1.26 million people\r\nworldwide died as a result of road traffic injuries,\r\naccounting for 2.2 per cent of global mortality and\r\nranking as the ninth leading cause of human death and\r\nmorbidity. The World Health Organization (WHO)\r\npredicts that by 2020 road traffic injuries could rank\r\nthird among the causes of death and disability, ahead of\r\nHIV/AIDS and malaria.\r\nA cause of concern is the fact that the losses\r\nsustained by developing countries as a result of road\r\ntraffic injuries far exceed those of developed countries.\r\nOf the 1.26 million road traffic fatalities in 2000, about\r\n1.04 million occurred in developing countries, which\r\ntranslates into 88 per cent of the total number of\r\ndeaths, whereas developed countries accounted for\r\nonly 12 per cent. Faced with that grave situation, it\r\nstands to reason that the international community\r\nshould enhance cooperation and endeavour to improve\r\nroad safety in all countries, and in developing countries\r\nin particular. In that context, I wish to make four\r\npoints.\r\nFirst, ensuring road safety is a systemic\r\nundertaking that involves human beings, vehicles,\r\nroads, the environment and management. In\r\nformulating specific laws, policies and measures in an\r\neffort to eradicate causes of road traffic injuries,\r\ncountries should take into account the overall picture\r\nand a whole range of factors.\r\nSecondly, given that national Governments bear\r\nthe primary responsibility for road safety, they should\r\ngive priority to preventive interventions. In doing so,\r\nthey should rely on the participation and collaboration\r\nof all sectors of society; heighten the safety awareness\r\nof relevant Government departments, transportation\r\nauthorities and the general public; and ensure road\r\nsafety.\r\nThirdly, it is imperative to effectively beef up\r\ninternational cooperation. Countries should increase\r\ntheir exchange of information, learn from one another\r\nand join their efforts to improve road safety. Because\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\ndeveloping countries suffer from economic constraints\r\nand their infrastructure and management techniques are\r\nyet to be perfected, the international community should\r\nprovide them with the necessary financial, technical\r\nand managerial assistance.\r\nFourthly, the World Health Organization (WHO),\r\nwhich shoulders the weighty responsibility of keeping\r\neveryone in good health, should play an important role\r\nin coping with this problem. We have noted with\r\npleasure that WHO has chosen the theme of road safety\r\nfor World Health Day 2004. It is our hope that the\r\nevents surrounding World Health Day will serve to\r\nfurther heighten public attention to road safety in all\r\ncountries and make travelling a safer and more\r\ncomfortable experience.\r\nChina is a developing country. Along with the\r\nsustained healthy growth of the Chinese economy over\r\nthe past two decades, China’s road construction and\r\nautomobile industry have made significant headway.\r\nQuestions such as how to try to improve road safety\r\nconditions, accelerate legislation on road safety,\r\nincrease input in highway and urban road safety\r\nfacilities, intensify the training and safety education of\r\ndrivers, further improve road traffic accident\r\nprevention mechanisms and upgrade the treatment and\r\nrehabilitation of those injured in traffic accidents are\r\nmajor challenges facing the Chinese Government. We\r\nhope to enhance cooperation with the WHO and other\r\ninternational organizations and agencies, draw on the\r\nadvanced experience of other countries and scale new\r\nheights in China’s road safety capacity-building\r\nendeavours.\r\nMr. Vargas (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): At\r\nthe outset, I would like to thank the Permanent Mission\r\nof Oman for assuming this important initiative.\r\nIn the early days of the automobile, some people\r\nmade fun of those slow moving vehicles by calling out\r\n“hitch a horse to it” as they passed by. Others\r\nwelcomed the prospect that such an innovative\r\nmachine would put an end to the reckless behaviour of\r\nhorsemen who dashed down streets in full gallop,\r\nthereby endangering pedestrians. Over 100 years have\r\nlapsed since then, and both jokes and hopes have\r\nliterally been run over by the almost unmanageable\r\nroad crisis that, to one degree or another, affects all the\r\ncountries of the world and whose consequences are\r\nreflected in alarming statistics.\r\nTraffic accidents are today responsible for the\r\ndisability of approximately 30 million people and cause\r\nmore than 3 million deaths per year. Those numbers\r\nhave made traffic accidents the principal cause for the\r\nloss of potential life-years. Road accidents require\r\n$500 billion annually in medical services and are\r\nresponsible for a loss in productivity amounting to\r\nabout 1 per cent of a country’s gross domestic product.\r\nNevertheless, those statistics do not begin to quantify\r\nthe dimensions of individual and familial tragedies\r\ncaused by traffic accidents, of which all of us have\r\nbeen, or may potentially be, victims.\r\nTraffic accidents generate and multiply\r\nexponentially the complex sources of violence. They\r\nharm the economy and the environment and have\r\ndamaging physical and psychological effects on human\r\nbeings, as well as on such social and cultural values as\r\nsecurity and solidarity and on efforts to improve\r\nquality of life.\r\nThe lack of road safety long ago ceased to be a\r\nproblem of the developed world alone or a\r\nphenomenon limited to large urban centres. In my\r\ncountry, for example, the motorization index is\r\ngrowing exponentially, thereby increasing the risk of\r\ntraffic accidents and producing a worrying rise in the\r\nemission of toxic gases. Between 1981 and 2002 the\r\nnumber of in situ deaths grew by 243 per cent.\r\nAlthough the percentage of deaths caused by traffic\r\naccident has gradually decreased, that reduction was\r\nnot due to a net drop in the actual number of deaths but\r\nto the fact that there are currently many more non-fatal\r\naccidents. The number of accidents has doubled in the\r\npast 10 years, totalling 64,440 in the year 2002. For a\r\nnation of fewer than 4 million inhabitants, such\r\nnumbers indicate that the lack of road safety is a very\r\nserious social and public health problem affecting\r\nmostly children, students and the majority of the\r\neconomically active segment of the population.\r\nFor generations, road safety strategies have\r\nfollowed the traditional model of the “four Es”. That\r\nmodel corresponds to the English words enforcement,\r\nengineering, education and emergency; in other words,\r\nto the laws pertaining to those words. However, it is\r\nnecessary to expand that traditional model to include\r\nnew, complementary strategies. With regard to Costa\r\nRica itself, our road transit authorities are making\r\nstrenuous efforts to refocus their work and achieve\r\nmore concrete and effective results.\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nIn that regard, my country has incorporated\r\nseveral new elements in its effort to achieve road safety\r\nas part of an approach that brings together various\r\nperspectives, policies, strategies, resources and\r\nexpertise. Against that backdrop, in promoting road\r\nsafety it is essential to take into account specific\r\ngeographic, demographic, cultural and climactic\r\ncharacteristics. It is also essential to involve local\r\ngovernments, civil society and the private sector in\r\ndevising and implementing road safety policies. Local\r\nmanagement of road safety must result in the putting in\r\nplace by the users of the road system itself of\r\nparticipatory approaches to the design, implementation,\r\nmonitoring, control and evaluation of plans and\r\nprogrammes in the area road safety that take into\r\naccount the local environment. Moreover, given the\r\ndynamic character of the road safety problem, it is\r\nnecessary to decentralize the taking of political,\r\ntechnical and financial decisions.\r\nI would in particular like to emphasize the\r\nimportance of putting a human face on engineering.\r\nThe decision-making process regarding the\r\nimplementation of civil engineering work must take\r\ninto account the particularities and special needs of the\r\nmost vulnerable users of the transit system. Among\r\nother things, sustainable road safety requires the\r\ndevelopment of a road system defined by the abilities\r\nof the users of those roads. In that connection, a road\r\nsystem should not be more complicated than what the\r\nleast competent user can negotiate. That is an idea we\r\nmust consider.\r\nFrom its earliest beginnings, the automobile was\r\nconceived as a tool in the service of human beings that\r\nwould save time, physical effort and economic\r\nresources, not as an end in itself — and much less as a\r\nweapon of mass destruction. Let us join efforts to\r\nensure that road transportation once again becomes a\r\nmeans of safely and quickly reaching a destination, and\r\nnot an ongoing threat to every child and adult.\r\nIn conclusion, in addition to expressing our\r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General for his report on the\r\nglobal road safety crisis (A/58/223), I would once\r\nagain like to thank the delegation of Oman for its\r\nleadership in the preparation of the draft resolution on\r\nthis item, which we are happy to sponsor.\r\nMr. Mantovani (Italy): I have the honour to take\r\nthe floor on behalf of the European Union. The\r\nacceding countries of Cyprus, the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland,\r\nSlovakia and Slovenia, the associated countries of\r\nBulgaria, Romania and Turkey and the Economic Free\r\nTrade Association countries of Iceland and\r\nLiechtenstein align themselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the report of the\r\nSecretary-General (A/58/228) on the need for a global\r\neffort to raise awareness about the health impact and\r\nsocial and economic costs of road traffic crashes and\r\ninjuries. The magnitude of the burden posed by road\r\ntraffic injuries is reflected by the figures cited in the\r\nreport of the World Health Organization (WHO). It is\r\nalso clear that this public health problem has a major\r\neffect on low- and middle-income countries and that it\r\nconsiderably undermines the achievement of\r\nsustainable development.\r\nDespite the gravity of this public health problem,\r\nwe are convinced that a great deal can be done to\r\nprevent and reduce road traffic injuries. Accidents on\r\nthe roads are preventable, and their impact on society\r\ncan be reduced by the political commitment of national\r\nGovernments.\r\nWe can also do more on an international level to\r\naddress this problem. To that end, we call for efforts by\r\nthe United Nations system to support the development\r\nof policies on road safety and to promote the\r\nintegration of road safety concerns into all relevant\r\nnational policies — including those that relate to\r\nwomen, children and the elderly — within the overall\r\nframework of sustainable development. In that context\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme, the\r\nWHO, the World Bank and UNICEF, as well as the\r\nregional development banks, should be called upon to\r\nplay a major role through the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Assistance Framework and the Poverty\r\nReduction Strategy Paper process. The United Nations\r\nsystem can also contribute by providing assistance in\r\nthe critical area of data collection. In that respect, the\r\nEuropean Union welcomes the initiative by the WHO\r\nto designate road safety as the theme for World Health\r\nDay, which will be celebrated in Paris on 7 April 2004.\r\nThe European Union attaches great importance to\r\nthe problem of road safety. That commitment is\r\nreflected in the European Commission’s recent\r\nadoption of its European road safety action programme\r\nfor the period 2003 — 2010, which aims at halving the\r\nnumber of road accident victims in the European\r\nCommunity as a whole by 2010. The same action\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.41\r\nprogramme provides for the establishment of a\r\nEuropean road safety observatory within the\r\nCommission.\r\nThe problem of road safety is on the agenda of\r\nthe European Union. The ministries of transportation of\r\nthe member States of the European Union will gather\r\nin Verona, Italy, in the next few days to discuss priority\r\naction lines in order to improve and harmonize security\r\nstandards in Europe.\r\nThe European Union believes that saving human\r\nlives through an effective road safety policy is a\r\ndifficult challenge, but it is also a moral obligation for\r\nall Member States.\r\nFinally, speaking in my national capacity, let me\r\nadd that Italy is ready to join the list of sponsors to\r\ndraft resolution A/58/L.3, on the global road safety\r\ncrisis.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
