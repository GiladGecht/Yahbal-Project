Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 15\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(a) Election of five non-permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will now\r\nproceed to the election of five non-permanent members\r\nof the Security Council to replace those members\r\nwhose term of office expires on 31 December 2003.\r\nThe five outgoing non-permanent members are\r\nthe following: Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico\r\nand the Syrian Arab Republic. Those five States cannot\r\nbe re-elected. Their names, therefore, should not\r\nappear on the ballot papers.\r\nApart from the five permanent members, the\r\nSecurity Council will include in the year 2004 the\r\nfollowing States: Angola, Chile, Germany, Pakistan\r\nand Spain. The names of those States, therefore, should\r\nalso not appear on the ballot papers.\r\nOf the five non-permanent members that will\r\nremain in office in the year 2004, two are from Africa\r\nand Asia, one is from Latin America and the Caribbean\r\nand two are from Western Europe and other States.\r\nConsequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General\r\nAssembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December\r\n1963, the five non-permanent members should be\r\nelected according to the following pattern: three from\r\nAfrica and Asia, one from Eastern Europe and one\r\nfrom Latin America and the Caribbean. The ballot\r\npapers reflect that pattern.\r\nIn accordance with established practice, there is\r\nan understanding to the effect that, of the three States\r\nto be elected from Africa and Asia, two should be from\r\nAfrica and one from Asia.\r\nI should also like to inform the Assembly that\r\nthose candidates, their number not exceeding the\r\nnumber of seats to be filled, that receive the greatest\r\nnumber of votes and a two-thirds majority of those\r\npresent and voting will be declared elected. In the case\r\nof a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a\r\nrestricted ballot limited to those candidates who have\r\nobtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to\r\nthat procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with rule 92 of the\r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret\r\nballot and there shall be no nominations.\r\nRegarding candidatures, I have been informed by\r\nthe Chairmen of the respective regional groups of the\r\nfollowing.\r\nFor the three vacant seats from among the\r\nAfrican and Asian States, there are three endorsed\r\ncandidates, namely, Algeria, Benin and the Philippines.\r\nFor the vacant seat from among the Eastern European\r\nStates, there is one endorsed candidate, namely,\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.42\r\nRomania. For the vacant seat from among the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, there is one endorsed\r\ncandidate, namely, Brazil.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, we shall now proceed to the election by\r\nsecret ballot.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like\r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the\r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no\r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a\r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting.\r\nI should like to seek the usual cooperation of\r\nrepresentatives during the time of the conduct of the\r\nelections. Please be reminded that during the voting\r\nprocess all campaigning should cease in the General\r\nAssembly Hall. That means, in particular, that once the\r\nmeeting has begun, no more campaign material can be\r\ndistributed inside the Hall. I intend to follow that to the\r\nletter. All representatives are also required to remain in\r\ntheir seats so that the voting process can proceed in an\r\norderly manner. I would also seek the Assembly’s\r\ncooperation and support regarding cellular phones.\r\nPlease put them on “vibrate” if you feel you must have\r\nthem on. It is very disconcerting, when we are in the\r\nmiddle of serious business, to hear those phones sound\r\noff. I thank you for your cooperation.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process.\r\nBallot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now\r\nbe distributed. I request representatives to use only\r\nthose ballot papers that have been distributed.\r\nMay I ask representatives to write on the ballot\r\npapers marked “A”, for the African and Asian States,\r\nthe names of the three States for which they wish to\r\nvote; on the ballot papers marked “B”, for the Eastern\r\nEuropean States, the name of the one State for which\r\nthey wish to vote; and on the ballot papers marked “C”,\r\nfor the Latin American and Caribbean States, the name\r\nof the one State for which they wish to vote.\r\nA ballot paper containing more names from the\r\nrelevant region than the number of seats assigned to it\r\nwill be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a\r\nballot paper that do not belong to that region will not\r\nbe counted.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Ms. Alice\r\nZaunschirm (Austria), Mr. Yusuf Mammedaliyev\r\n(Azerbaijan), Mr. Alfred Moungara-Moussotsi\r\n(Gabon), Mrs. Luisa Fernanda Bonilla Galvão de\r\nQueiroz (Guatemala), Mr. Philippe Worré\r\n(Luxembourg) and Mr. Ali Al-Darmaki (Oman)\r\nacted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe President: I now suspend the meeting for\r\nthirty minutes.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.30 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 11.50 a.m.\r\nThe President: Before announcing the result of\r\nthe voting, I would like to clarify that, in accordance\r\nwith Article 19 of the Charter and resolution 58/1, of\r\n16 October 2003, two Member States were not given\r\nballot papers.\r\nThe result of the voting is as follows:\r\nGroup A — African and Asian States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 182\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 182\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting: 182\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 122\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nBenin 181\r\nPhilippines 179\r\nAlgeria 178\r\nRepublic of Korea 1\r\nGroup B — Eastern European States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 182\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 182\r\nAbstentions: 7\r\nNumber of members voting: 175\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 117\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nRomania 174\r\nPoland 1\r\nGroup C — Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 182\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 182\r\nAbstentions 4\r\nNumber of members voting: 178\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 119\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.42\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nBrazil 177\r\nArgentina 1\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority,\r\nthe following States were elected members of the\r\nSecurity Council for a two-year term beginning 1\r\nJanuary 2004: Algeria, Benin, Brazil, the\r\nPhilippines and Romania.\r\nThe President: I congratulate the States that have\r\nbeen elected members of the Security Council, and I\r\nsincerely thank the tellers for their assistance in the\r\nelection.\r\nWe have thus concluded our consideration of sub-\r\nitem (a) of agenda item 15.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I would like to remind\r\nrepresentatives that on Monday, 27 October 2003, the\r\nAssembly will consider the cluster of items concerning\r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly,\r\nrestructuring and reform. The Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral will present an introduction at the beginning of\r\nthe meeting. There are over 45 speakers inscribed to\r\nspeak on the items. I appeal to members to consider\r\nputting forward suggestions and to participate\r\npersonally at that meeting. I would also appeal to\r\nmembers to limit their statements to seven minutes.\r\nAgenda item 160 (continued)\r\nGlobal road safety crisis\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/228)\r\nDraft resolution (A/58/L.3)\r\nMr. Tan (Singapore): As we have just elected\r\nfive members of the Security Council, I would like, on\r\nbehalf of my delegation, to congratulate the five\r\ncountries concerned.\r\nAt the outset, with regard to the agenda item\r\nentitled “Global road safety crisis”, I would like to\r\nexpress our appreciation to the delegation of Oman for\r\nits efforts to bring that growing crisis to the world’s\r\nattention.\r\nSingapore welcomes this opportunity to discuss\r\nthe growing road safety crisis. Motor vehicles have\r\nbecome such an efficient and convenient mode of\r\ntransportation, as well as an essential part of our\r\neveryday lives in some form or other, that we often\r\nforget that these high-velocity, moving lumps of metal\r\nand plastic are also lethal weapons and, indeed — as\r\nsome delegations have noted — weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Every year we pay a very heavy toll in\r\nhuman lives for that convenience.\r\nAccording to the report (A/58/228) of the\r\nSecretary-General on the global road safety crisis, an\r\nestimated 1.26 million people worldwide died as a\r\nresult of road traffic injuries in the year 2000. Road\r\ntraffic injuries accounted for 2.2 per cent of global\r\nmortality, and were responsible for 25 per cent of all\r\ndeaths due to injury. Also in the year 2000, road traffic\r\ncrashes ranked as the ninth leading cause of death. The\r\nWorld Health Organization’s (WHO) projections\r\nsuggest that by 2020 road traffic injuries will overtake\r\nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria to rank third\r\namong the causes of death and disability. Furthermore,\r\nthe burden of road traffic injuries falls\r\ndisproportionately on people in low- and middle-\r\nincome countries.\r\nApart from the death toll and human cost, the\r\napproximate worldwide financial cost of road accidents\r\nis estimated at $500 billion. That is larger than the\r\nannual gross domestic product (GDP) of many small-\r\nand medium-sized economies. It is further estimated\r\nthat the amount spent on repair work, medical\r\nassistance, investigations and other expenses incurred\r\nby accidents adds up to approximately 2 per cent of the\r\nGDP of developing countries annually. That is twice\r\nthe total overseas development assistance provided to\r\nthose countries.\r\nIn addition, the social cost of this growing crisis\r\ncannot be measured in dollars and cents. Happy\r\nfamilies end up grieving over the untimely demise of\r\nloved ones or because of those traumatized for life.\r\nFormerly productive citizens become paralyzed or are\r\nmarginalized from the workforce. Innocent children\r\nbecome orphaned, often owing to preventable\r\ncircumstances, and face a lifetime of hardship and\r\nadversity.\r\nWe, the international community, have been\r\nremiss in not recognizing this escalating trend sooner.\r\nThat is why Singapore values Oman’s initiative. The\r\nWHO’s decision to designate “Road safety” as the\r\ntheme of World Health Day in 2004 is an important but\r\nlong-overdue step in the right direction. It is only with\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.42\r\ngreater awareness that we can start to address the crisis\r\nindividually and collectively.\r\nAs the Secretary-General’s report notes, it is a sad\r\nfact that more than one third of road traffic deaths in\r\n2000 — that is 435,000 deaths — occurred in South-\r\nEast Asia. In other words, more than one third of the\r\ntotal road traffic deaths in the world occurred in a\r\nregion with only 8 per cent of the world’s population.\r\nClearly more needs to be done to reverse this highly\r\ndisturbing trend in our region.\r\nDomestically, the Singapore Government has\r\ntaken numerous steps in the last two decades to\r\nimprove road safety in Singapore, based, as some of\r\nour fellow representatives have mentioned, on the\r\n“three Es” approach to road safety — engineering,\r\nenforcement and education.\r\nIn the area of engineering, experts from\r\nSingapore’s Land Transport Authority regularly\r\nconduct road safety inspections to ensure that road\r\nconditions meet the highest standards of maintenance.\r\nSeveral engineering initiatives — such as alignment\r\nmarkers, crash cushions, bus-stop bollards and vibra-\r\nlines to warn drivers driving too close to the edge of\r\nthe road — have also been implemented to improve\r\nroad safety.\r\nEnforcement also plays an important role in\r\nimproving road safety. The enforcement of traffic rules\r\nis necessary to stop reckless and irresponsible road\r\nusers from causing accidents and harm to others.\r\nIrresponsible road users face fines, suspension from\r\ndriving and even jail terms.\r\nUltimately, however, education is the only\r\nguarantee for the long-term improvement in road\r\nsafety. Education is crucial in creating responsible road\r\nusers. For instance, anti-smoking campaigns are a good\r\nexample of how effective a focused public education\r\ncampaign can be in changing mindsets. Similarly,\r\nrelying on inventive and catchy slogans, we should\r\nconsider such approaches to educate members of the\r\ngeneral public on their responsibilities as road users.\r\nAs part of the continuing process of educating\r\nroad users on their responsibilities, various public\r\neducation campaigns, events and programmes on road\r\nsafety have been organized to reach out to all road\r\nusers, be they drivers, motorcyclists, cyclists or\r\npedestrians. Positive road habits are also reinforced\r\nthrough annual events, such as road safety outreach and\r\nanti-drink-and-drive and road courtesy campaigns.\r\nWith the “three Es” approach, Singapore has been\r\nable to bring about a steady drop in the number of\r\nfatalities and serious accidents over the past two\r\ndecades. Last year, our fatality rate of 4.8 per cent per\r\n100,000 people was the second lowest in 29 years. Any\r\nroad accident that causes death or serious injury,\r\nhowever, is still one road accident too many. We can\r\nand will work together to further reduce this figure.\r\nSingapore also welcomes opportunities to share\r\nexperiences and learn from the best practices of others.\r\nWe have done much through consultations and\r\nbriefings on road safety education with visitors from\r\nsuch countries as China, Thailand, Malaysia,\r\nIndonesia, Viet Nam and India. We have also made\r\ncontributions at such forums as the seminar series of\r\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\r\nknown as the Global Road Safety Partnership; the Road\r\nSafety Experts Group Meetings of the Asia-Pacific\r\nEconomic Cooperation forum; and the recent Asian\r\nDevelopment Bank/ASEAN Road Safety Programme\r\nWorkshop in Singapore. We will continue to cooperate\r\nfully with the international community in combating\r\nthis problem.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to underscore the\r\nseriousness of the problem with another simple\r\nillustration. At the current rate of deaths from road\r\ntraffic accidents, more than 10 people will have died\r\nand 30 others been injured in the short duration of my\r\nspeech.\r\nMr. Savua (Fiji): I join Singapore in\r\ncongratulating the five newly elected non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council. We should also like\r\nto extend our appreciation to Oman for bringing this\r\nissue to the attention of the international community\r\nand for introducing the draft resolution before us,\r\nwhich we believe calls for all our support.\r\nAgenda item 160, “Global road safety crisis”,\r\naptly reflects the concerns confronting all nations and\r\nthe enormous costs imposed by road traffic injuries in\r\nterms of mortality, mobility and social and economic\r\ncosts. Road accidents are the leading cause of death\r\namong people aged 15 to 44; 1.26 million people were\r\nkilled on the roads in the year 2000. That is equivalent\r\nto 2.2 per cent of global mortality. The World Health\r\nOrganization (WHO) projects that road traffic injuries\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.42\r\ncould rank third among causes of death and disability\r\nby the year 2020.\r\nThe statistics contained in document A/58/228\r\nare consistent with these projections. Sadly, most of the\r\ndeaths and fatal injuries could be preventable if\r\nsuitable intervention were developed. While the\r\nprimary responsibilities in this connection lie with\r\nMember States, we agree with the Secretary-General\r\nthat there is a need for investment and partnerships to\r\nbe fostered between the Member States and the United\r\nNations system in sharing knowledge, best practices,\r\nlessons learned and resources. Regional coordination\r\nand cooperation will once again prove effective,\r\nespecially in assisting developing countries,\r\nparticularly those facing unique challenges, such as\r\nsmall island developing States, like my own country,\r\nFiji.\r\nIn thanking the Secretary-General for his report,\r\nwe rely on his coordination in forging ahead on such\r\ncooperation and partnerships, using all avenues that are\r\nat his disposal. We recognize in this connection the\r\nefforts of the WHO in designating the theme “Road\r\nsafety” for the observance of World Health Day on 7\r\nApril 2004, as well as the launching of the World\r\nReport on Road Traffic Injury Prevention. These efforts\r\nneed all our full support to ensure that our sacred aims\r\nare realized. The Report calls on nations to enact\r\nprogrammes and initiatives to arrest the runaway\r\nstatistics of the carnage on our roads. All these\r\ninitiatives are well-meaning and hope to do as much\r\nthey can. However, money is always a prohibitive\r\nfactor. We count on the United Nations to assist us, as\r\nwe have already alluded to.\r\nDomestically, the Fiji National Road Safety\r\nCouncil was established by an act of Parliament in\r\n1995. It is tasked with enhancing the safety of all road\r\nusers. Educating road users has been a hallmark of the\r\nCouncil’s campaign to cover rural and urban areas of\r\nFiji. The campaign has also covered road users of\r\ndifferent groups, schools, drivers and passengers in the\r\nuse of all kinds of roads. The Council has enjoyed\r\nmuch success over the years, as indicated by the\r\nreduction in our road accident figures. Ideally, we\r\nwould like achieve an accident rate of zero. However\r\ndifficult this may be, the work of prevention will have\r\nto be relentless, continuous and versatile if it is to be\r\ninteresting and eye-catching. The success of the\r\nNational Road Safety Council is a result of the\r\npartnership between Government and the Council, on\r\nthe one hand, and Mobil Oil, other oil companies and\r\npublic support, on the other.\r\nOur region has made innovative progress in\r\npromoting road safety procedures. The State of\r\nVictoria, Australia, has been assisting the Fiji police in\r\nthe use of speed guns and providing equipment in\r\nteaching road safety. The Asian Development Bank has\r\nprovided soft loans to help the Council further in\r\nrealizing its designated responsibilities.\r\nThe high-level plenary meeting of the General\r\nAssembly scheduled for 14 April 2004 can be attended,\r\nwe trust, at the highest level possible to give the day\r\nproper recognition and to give substance to all the\r\nplanned programmes and the development of road\r\nsafety initiatives. It is our view that a lot of assistance\r\nis already available; the problem is making known the\r\nassistance that can help reduce our road safety figures.\r\nFiji intends to persevere in its road safety programmes\r\nand is willing to assist other programmes, if wanted.\r\nMr. Gilman (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States fully supports the initiative addressing\r\nthe global issue of traffic safety in the United Nations\r\nsystem and welcomes the opportunity to work with\r\nMember States on the most efficient and effective way\r\nto coordinate the exchange of information and the\r\ndevelopment of the best road traffic safety practices.\r\nThe issue of road safety holds a prominent place in our\r\nnational and international agendas.\r\nAt the national level, while the United States was\r\nable to reduce its annual traffic-related fatalities from\r\n55,000 in the late 1960s to 42,000 last year, the fatality\r\nrate is still stagnant and the associated societal and\r\neconomic costs continue to be too high at $230 billion\r\na year. Moreover, we cannot be complacent about the\r\nannual deaths of some 42,000 United States citizens or\r\nsimply accept that significant loss as an unavoidable\r\npart of living in a heavily-motorized society. Through\r\nthis initiative, we look forward to learning from other\r\nnations about their successful strategies and we hope to\r\noffer some of our own.\r\nAt the international level, we have stepped up our\r\nactivities to address traffic safety issues through our\r\nparticipation in the Working Party on Road Traffic\r\nSafety within the Economic Commission for Europe\r\n(UNECE). That group is the only existing United\r\nNations working group that can appropriately respond\r\nto the call for action on this draft resolution.\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.42\r\nThe United States strongly believes that any\r\ncoordinated initiatives to address the problem of global\r\nroad safety should be managed within the existing\r\nUNECE Working Party. The infrastructure and\r\ntechnical expertise are in place and the UNECE’s\r\nmandate is inclusive of non-European countries,\r\nincluding developing economies. We strongly\r\nrecommend that the Chairman of the Working Party\r\nand its Secretariat be present at the 14 April plenary\r\nmeetings in order to discuss how all of us can\r\ncollectively use the Working Party’s mandate to its\r\nfullest extent.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 49/2 of 19 October 1994, I now\r\ncall on the observer for the International Federation of\r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\r\nMr. Geleta (International Federation of Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): At the outset, I\r\nshould like on behalf of our organization to\r\ncongratulate the newly elected members of the Security\r\nCouncil. As we debate this somewhat sad theme today,\r\nand given the speed with which we lose people on the\r\nroads, I wonder, as some colleagues have done,\r\nwhether this theme may not become a Security Council\r\nissue some months from now.\r\nAt any rate, I should like to start by saying that\r\nthis theme is of very deep concern to our organization,\r\nnot only in the secretariat in Geneva, but also\r\nworldwide. In many cases, as the Assembly knows,\r\nRed Cross/Red Crescent volunteers are the first to\r\nreach road crash sites, where they provide first aid,\r\npsychological support and ambulance services. We do\r\nthis on a daily basis for crash victims in communities\r\naround the world. These communities and our\r\nvolunteers are deeply affected by the preventable\r\ntragedies they encounter every day. They strongly\r\nbelieve that this particular crisis, or disaster, if you\r\nlike, can be drastically reduced. We therefore welcome\r\nthe attention being given to this issue by the General\r\nAssembly and trust that it will lead to concerted action\r\nat the regional and national levels to address the issues\r\nidentified in the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nThe statistics are so grim that I will not bother the\r\nAssembly with terrifying figures, since previous\r\ncolleagues have covered these. I am sure, however, that\r\nmany saw yesterday’s BBC report informing us that, in\r\njust one of our beautiful European countries alone, on\r\naverage 100 people die every day on the roads. No\r\ncomment is needed, I believe.\r\nAs early as 1998, we were already raising the\r\nalarm. The International Federation of Red Cross and\r\nRed Crescent Societies (IFRC) published a study on\r\ntraffic accidents in its World Disasters Report. This\r\nstudy asked an unpleasant question: Must millions\r\nmore die from traffic accidents before we act much\r\nfaster? The central message here is that action needs to\r\nbe taken by all of us — Governments, the private\r\nsector, civil society and the public at large — to deal\r\nwith this disaster.\r\nIn 1999, during the International Conference of\r\nthe Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement, Governments\r\nand our national organizations committed themselves\r\nto a plan of action to respond to this growing problem\r\nthrough the further development of road safety\r\nmeasures, in partnership with other stakeholders. The\r\nimplementation of the plan of action leaves a lot to be\r\ndesired, particularly given the growing scale of this\r\ncrisis.\r\nIFRC strongly supports the actions undertaken by\r\nmany of our national societies and, to a certain extent,\r\nexpects more from our partners, the Governments.\r\nAlthough we are aware that each Government, however\r\nconstrained it may be in skills, technology and\r\nresources, engages in road safety programmes, only six\r\nresponded to the requirements of General Assembly\r\nresolution 57/309, according to the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport. However, we would like to make special note of\r\nOman, Austria and Ethiopia, which have mounted\r\nactive road safety campaigns in collaboration with their\r\nnational Red Cross and Red Crescent societies.\r\nAnother very valuable illustration of\r\ncollaboration is the European Red Cross road safety\r\ncampaign, organized by 26 European national\r\norganizations and strongly supported by the European\r\nCommission. It is an active and powerful campaign,\r\noriginally launched in 2002 and hosted by the German\r\nRed Cross. It works and it saves lives.\r\nWe recognize that partnerships are a prerequisite\r\nto the achievement of real progress in addressing this\r\ncrisis. For our part, we are particularly pleased with the\r\npartnership that has been developed to bring together\r\nour resources with the United Kingdom Department for\r\nInternational Development, the Swedish International\r\nDevelopment Cooperation Agency and, very\r\nimportantly, the World Bank, the World Health\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.42\r\nOrganization (WHO) and the private sector. The result\r\nwas the formation in 1999 of the Global Road Safety\r\nPartnership (GRSP), which is hosted at our\r\nheadquarters in Geneva. It is an active global\r\npartnership dedicated to the improvement of road\r\nsafety, especially in developing countries, through the\r\nsharing of information and experience.\r\nThe partnership between the United Nations and\r\nthe WHO in the production of reports and\r\ndocumentation for this debate is most welcome. We\r\nlook forward to that institutional collaboration being\r\ntaken to a new level in 2004, when World Health\r\nDay — 7 April — will have road safety as its theme.\r\nWe and the Global Road Safety Partnership are\r\nworking actively with the WHO and the World Bank on\r\nthe preparation of the key document, the World report\r\non road traffic injury prevention, to be launched on that\r\nday. As part of that theme, we urge all Governments to\r\nopen dialogue with their national Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent societies to prepare for effective events to\r\nmark World Health Day and to support sustainable\r\npartnerships with both civil society and the private\r\nsector to address national road safety issues.\r\nFurthermore, the IFRC will, through its first-aid\r\nwork, take every appropriate opportunity to strengthen\r\nthe capacity of communities to address the crisis we\r\nare discussing today. In many respects, the work of the\r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent on first aid provides the\r\nmost human interface between the aforementioned sad\r\nstatistics of the crisis and its impact on ordinary\r\npeople. As the Assembly may be aware, in many\r\nEuropean countries, it is compulsory that everyone\r\npass a Red Cross first-aid course and examination\r\nbefore receiving a driver’s license. We shall also work\r\nto ensure that these activities and the proposed high-\r\nlevel United Nations debate next April are built into\r\nthe coordinated work to be carried out within the\r\nmultilateral family.\r\nIn conclusion, to rephrase an old American\r\nsaying, all roads are paved with good intentions. Let us\r\nwork together to make those intentions a reality.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on this item.\r\nI should like to inform members that, at the\r\nrequest of the sponsors of draft resolution A/58/L.3,\r\naction on the draft resolution will be taken at a later\r\ndate, to be announced in the Journal of the United\r\nNations.\r\nAgenda item 50 (continued)\r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of and\r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United\r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic,\r\nsocial and related fields\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/359)\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 57/29 of 19 November 2002, I\r\nnow call on the Observer for Partners in Population and\r\nDevelopment.\r\nMr. Singh (Partners in Population and\r\nDevelopment): Thank you very much, Mr. President,\r\nfor giving us this opportunity to offer a few remarks in\r\nrelation to agenda item 50 on behalf of the Partners in\r\nPopulation and Development.\r\nFirst, let me say a few words about the Partners in\r\nPopulation and Development. As many members know,\r\nthe Partners in Population and Development came into\r\nexistence during the 1994 International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD) as an\r\nintergovernmental alliance of developing countries\r\nwith a record of substantial success in reproductive\r\nhealth and population programmes and with a\r\ncommitment to share with other developing countries\r\ntheir knowledge and experience. It now comprises 19\r\ncountries representing 54 per cent of the world\r\npopulation. During the ICPD+5 process, in 1999, the\r\nGeneral Assembly specifically recognized the Partners\r\nas a major South-South initiative, and last year, as was\r\nmentioned, we were granted Permanent Observer\r\nstatus, which we hope to utilize to work closely with\r\nvarious United Nations agencies and programmes\r\ninvolved in population and development.\r\nThe four major areas covered by the Partners are\r\nfamily planning and reproductive health, maternal\r\nmortality and morbidity, issues concerning adolescents,\r\nand HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.\r\nThe modalities that have been used to focus on those\r\nthemes are policy dialogues, training, research and the\r\ndissemination of information, particularly on best\r\npractices and lessons learned. We work closely with the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and other\r\nUnited Nations agencies involved in population and\r\ndevelopment. In our view, the work that we do\r\ncontributes to the furtherance and strengthening of\r\nSouth-South cooperation, which was one of the major\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.42\r\npoints in the Programme of Action of the 1994 Cairo\r\nConference and which, we believe, is one of the major\r\nelements of the promotion of future cooperation among\r\nall countries in relation to strengthening the capacities\r\nof countries in the South.\r\nThe main topic we wish to touch upon here is\r\nintegrated and coordinated implementation of and\r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits in the economic, social and\r\nrelated fields. We agree that reviews and appraisals of\r\nthe major United Rations conferences and summits\r\nshould assess the progress made in the implementation\r\nof the commitments and provide an occasion to\r\nreaffirm the goals and objectives agreed at those\r\nconferences and summits, share best practices and\r\nlessons learned, and identify obstacles and constraints\r\nencountered, actions and initiatives to overcome them\r\nand important measures for the further implementation\r\nof their programmes of action, as well as new\r\nchallenges and emerging issues.\r\nWe expect that the ICPD+10 review — or the\r\nCairo plus 10 review — in which we are particularly\r\ninterested, will proceed fully along those lines. We\r\nlook forward to the country-level assessment of\r\nprogress and constraints in implementing the ICPD\r\nProgramme of Action undertaken by the UNFPA. That\r\nassessment should give us valuable insights into what\r\nprogress has been achieved towards the goals and\r\nobjectives of the ICPD and what further action needs to\r\nbe undertaken to achieve those goals by the year 2015.\r\nWe also await with interest the outcomes of the\r\nregional meetings organized by the regional\r\ncommissions, as well as the initiatives taken by civil\r\nsociety organizations.\r\nThough it seems clear that no global\r\nintergovernmental conference on population and\r\ndevelopment will take place in 2004, we believe that at\r\nall levels — national, regional and international —\r\nvarious opportunities within and outside the United\r\nNations will be used to refocus worldwide attention on\r\nthemes and issues relating to further implementation of\r\nthe ICPD Programme of Action, with particular\r\nattention to the issue of resource mobilization. We also\r\nbelieve that, if it is decided to organize a major\r\nmeeting in 2005 to examine implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, issues related to\r\npopulation and development will form part of the\r\nagenda of such a meeting.\r\nWe see a clear relationship between the\r\nMillennium Development Goals and the ICPD goals\r\nand objectives. We fully share the view of the\r\nSecretary-General, expressed on many occasions, that\r\nthe overall Millennium Goals of poverty eradication\r\nand gender equality are closely linked to the goals\r\nadopted by the ICPD in 1994; I refer in particular to\r\nthose relating to reproductive health and population.\r\nWe know that the UNFPA has already done a\r\nconsiderable amount of work on that topic. I wish to\r\ninform members that it is our intention to organize a\r\nnumber of policy dialogues, involving policy-makers\r\nand programme managers, on various aspects of this\r\nintegral relationship. We hope that the outcomes of\r\nthose dialogues, which will be published in the form of\r\nmonographs, will contribute to continuing discussion\r\non how such links between population themes and the\r\nMillennium Development Goals are to be established at\r\nthe operational level.\r\nThe President: We have heard the only speaker\r\nin the debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 15.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.35 p.m.\r\n"
