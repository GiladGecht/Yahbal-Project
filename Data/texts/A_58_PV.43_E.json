Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.45 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 60 (continued)\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit\r\nDraft resolution (A/58/L.5)\r\nThe President: Members will recall that the\r\nGeneral Assembly held its debate on this agenda item,\r\ntogether with agenda item 10, at the 23rd to 27th\r\nplenary meetings on 6, 7 and 9 October 2003. In\r\nconnection with this item, the General Assembly has\r\nbefore it a draft resolution issued as document\r\nA/58/L.5.\r\nI give the floor to the representative of China to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/58/L.5.\r\nMr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese): I\r\nhave the honour to introduce draft resolution A/58/L.5,\r\nentitled “Enhancing capacity-building in global public\r\nhealth”, under agenda item 60.\r\nTo halt and to begin to reverse, by 2015, the\r\nspread of HIV/AIDS and the incidence of malaria and\r\nother major diseases is one of the development goals\r\nset down in the Millennium Declaration. To achieve\r\nsuch a goal, the international community needs to pay\r\ngreater attention to capacity-building in global public\r\nhealth. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory\r\nsyndrome (SARS) in certain countries and regions in\r\nthe first half of the year once again demonstrated that\r\npublic health has become a global issue, which requires\r\nglobal cooperation. Only by enhancing the capacity of\r\nthe international community to combat HIV/AIDS,\r\nmalaria and other infectious diseases and by boosting\r\nnational capacity-building in public health can there be\r\na solid basis for development and prosperity in all\r\ncountries. With that in mind, the Chinese delegation\r\nhas taken the initiative of submitting the draft\r\nresolution entitled “Enhancing capacity-building in\r\nglobal public health”.\r\nThe main elements of this draft resolution include\r\nrecalling the Millennium Declaration adopted by heads\r\nof State and Government at the Millennium Summit\r\nand the development goals contained therein, in\r\nparticular the health-related development goals;\r\nrecognizing that the globalization of trade and\r\nincreased international travel have increased the risk of\r\nthe rapid worldwide spread of infectious diseases,\r\nposing new challenges to public health; noting with\r\nconcern the deleterious impact on humankind of\r\nvarious major infectious diseases and epidemics,\r\nespecially the heavy burden they impose on the\r\ndeveloping countries; welcoming the current success of\r\nthe affected countries in combating severe acute\r\nrespiratory syndrome (SARS); emphasizing the need\r\nfor greater international and regional cooperation to\r\nmeet new and existing challenges to public health;\r\nwelcoming the efforts of the World Health\r\nOrganization and other United Nations bodies, as well\r\nas the private sector and civil society, aimed at\r\nenhancing capacity-building in global public health and\r\nat promoting public health at the country level.\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\nIn the operative part, the draft urges Member\r\nStates to further integrate public health into their\r\nnational economic and social development strategies\r\nand consistently improve their public health systems;\r\ncalls upon Member States and the international\r\ncommunity to raise public awareness of good public\r\nhealth practices, including through education and the\r\nmass media; calls for the improvement of global public\r\nhealth preparedness and response systems, including\r\nsystems of prevention and monitoring of infectious\r\ndiseases; invites the regional social and economic\r\ncommissions to cooperate closely with Member States\r\nin their capacity-building in public health; encourages\r\nUnited Nations agencies, bodies, funds and\r\nprogrammes to continue to address public health\r\nconcerns in their development activities and\r\nprogrammes and to actively support capacity-building\r\nin global public health; and requests the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to include observations on the issue of\r\nenhancing capacity-building in global public health in\r\nhis report on the follow-up to the outcome of the\r\nMillennium Summit to be submitted to the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session.\r\nDuring the consultations on this draft resolution,\r\ndelegations put forward many constructive ideas and\r\nproposals that further enriched the draft resolution and\r\nmade it more comprehensive. I am confident that the\r\nadoption of this draft resolution by the General\r\nAssembly will not only inspire Member States to give\r\nhigher priority to capacity-building in public health,\r\nbut also to play an important role in achieving the\r\ndevelopment goals set in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nBefore the text was issued, 120 countries joined\r\nin the sponsorship of this draft resolution. Now,\r\nanother 24 countries have joined in sponsorship —\r\nAlbania, Bhutan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria,\r\nEcuador, Estonia, Fiji, Gabon, Haiti, Jordan,\r\nKyrgyzstan, Liechtenstein, Maldives, Mauritania,\r\nMonaco, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Republic of\r\nMoldova, Romania, Seychelles, Turkey, Turkmenistan,\r\nUruguay and Uzbekistan. Please allow me to express,\r\non behalf of the Chinese Government, our sincere\r\nthanks to all those countries that have shown interest\r\nand given their support. We hope that this draft\r\nresolution can be adopted by consensus.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of\r\nMorocco, who will speak on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nMr. Arrouchi (Morocco): I would like, on behalf\r\nof the Group of 77 (G-77), to thank the delegation of\r\nChina for having introduced this very important draft\r\nresolution on enhancing capacity-building in global\r\npublic health. We fully support this initiative, as it will\r\nhelp the international community to further enhance\r\ncapacity-building of global public health. This\r\ninitiative will also contribute to the promotion of\r\nfurther implementation of the outcome of the\r\nMillennium Summit, particularly in reinforcing\r\nnational public health infrastructures to face new\r\nchallenges posed by deadly diseases worldwide. From\r\nthe special session on HIV/AIDS, we know that the\r\nnumber of infected persons has increased from 36\r\nmillion to 40 million, the majority of who are in\r\nAfrica.\r\nWe look forward to a unanimous and enthusiastic\r\ndecision by the General Assembly on this very\r\nimportant draft resolution.\r\nMr. Shamanov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): Regarding the draft resolution on capacity-\r\nbuilding and global public health, we would like to\r\npoint out the following.\r\nAt the crossroads of this twentieth and twenty-\r\nfirst century, public health has become a priority on the\r\ninternational agenda. The international community’s\r\nconsensus was reflected in a number of fundamental\r\ndocuments in recent times, including the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and the Plan of Implementation of the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development. In\r\nachieving sustainable development and eradicating\r\npoverty, protecting public health and strengthening\r\nnational health services have taken on increasingly\r\nimportant roles, first of all as factors for the promotion\r\nand implementation of those objectives and secondly as\r\nindicators of the social and economic sustainability of\r\nsociety.\r\nFrom this standpoint, we regard positively the\r\nChinese-sponsored draft to enhance capacity-building\r\nin global public health and based on what we feel to be\r\nits great timeliness, we were one of the first sponsors.\r\nThe principle importance of the document is that it\r\ndoes not focus on just one of the individual aspects of\r\npublic health, but draws the attention of the\r\ninternational community to the strengthening of social\r\npublic health services as the basic machinery. Major\r\nemphasis is put on the improvement of the systems for\r\nprevention and monitoring infectious diseases and for\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\nestablishing partnerships among Governments,\r\norganizations and institutions of the United Nations\r\nsystem and international financial institutions, as well\r\nas the private sector and other representatives of civil\r\nsociety.\r\nWe would like to highlight with satisfaction the\r\nsuccessful work of our Chinese colleagues on coming\r\nto an agreement on the draft. Evidence of this is the\r\ngreat number of sponsors for this document. We hope\r\nthat it can adopted by consensus and we believe that\r\nthe adoption of this resolution will give further\r\nimportant momentum to international cooperation for\r\nthe purpose of carrying out the tasks of public health\r\nand sustainable development.\r\nMr. Cardoso (Brazil): Let me convey my\r\ncongratulations to the Chinese delegation for such an\r\nopportune and important initiative. Brazil was very\r\npleased to be one of the sponsors at a very early stage\r\nof the consultations.\r\nWe note with satisfaction, out of the many\r\nimportant issues raised by this draft (A/58/L.5), a\r\nreference to the World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nGeneral Council’s recent decision on the\r\nimplementation of paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration\r\non the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of\r\nIntellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) and\r\npublic health. This is a life-saving decision that allows\r\npoorer countries to deal with diseases that devastate\r\ntheir people. The overwhelming majority of people\r\nsuffering from infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS,\r\nare in developing countries.\r\nWe attach great importance to health related\r\nissues. This year we will bring to the attention of the\r\nThird Committee initiatives already taken in the\r\nCommission on Human Rights on the universal right to\r\nenjoy the highest possible standard of physical and\r\nmental health and on access to medications in the\r\ncontext of pandemics such a as HIV/AIDS, malaria and\r\ntuberculosis.\r\nIf we are to attain the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, in particular the health related Development\r\nGoals, we must persevere in enhancing capacity-\r\nbuilding in global public health, especially in\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nMr. Nambiar (India): The achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals of reducing child\r\nmortality, of improving maternal health and of\r\ncombating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases\r\nnecessarily requires capacity-building in public health\r\non a global basis.\r\nFurthermore, ill health undermines economic\r\ndevelopment and impedes efforts to reduce poverty.\r\nCapacity-building in public health is in fact essential\r\nfor economic growth and the achievement of the seven\r\nDevelopment Goals of the Millennium Declaration.\r\nIndia is happy to be associated with this draft\r\nresolution as a sponsor. We thank China for the\r\ninitiative that they have taken.\r\nIn the context of the Development Goals adopted\r\nby the United Nations, it is important that the\r\nOrganization also recognizes its close and direct link\r\nwith public health. Not to do so would constitute a\r\nserious shortcoming in the details of any viable\r\nstrategy for the achievement of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nMember States of the United Nations have the\r\nprimary responsibility for building and strengthening\r\ntheir public health capacities. The draft resolution\r\nrecognizes, however, that the magnitude of the\r\nchallenge may be beyond the capabilities of many\r\ndeveloping countries. We are pleased to see in the draft\r\nan emphasis on the importance of active international\r\ncooperation. The report that the Secretary-General will\r\ngive to us at the next session will, we expect, help us\r\nfurther address this matter.\r\nThe Commission on Macroeconomics and Health\r\nhad, in its 2001 report, provided an approach to the\r\ndevelopment cooperation goal of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. We recognize that there has been\r\nmovement, albeit somewhat limited, on its\r\nrecommendations. We are happy that India, particularly\r\nthrough its pharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities,\r\nhas been able to make a contribution. We hope that this\r\ndraft resolution will encourage further effort in the\r\ndirection recommended by the Commission. We join\r\nChina in expressing appreciation for the positive and\r\nconstructive spirit of the consultations held on this\r\ndraft and also look forward to its adoption by\r\nconsensus.\r\nMr. Cumberbach Miguén (Cuba) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I would like join other speakers in thanking\r\nthe Chinese delegation for having introduced this\r\ninitiative, of which my country has been a sponsor\r\nsince its introduction.\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\nMeeting here, our heads of State and Government\r\nproposed in the Millennium Summit Declaration that\r\nwe enhance our citizens’ health, one of many other\r\ngoals furthering the development of our peoples.\r\nIn this context, Cuba thinks that it is essential to\r\npromote at the global level international cooperation\r\nactivities that will lead to creating capacities and\r\npromoting public health, particularly in the third world.\r\nWe are convinced that the draft resolution entitled\r\n“Enhancing capacity-building in global public health”\r\n(A/58/L.5) is an additional step forward in this\r\ndirection. We would like to reiterate once again that\r\nour country will continue to support all international\r\nefforts in the health area to combat the evils afflicting\r\nthe international community.\r\nMr. Mekprayoonthong (Thailand): My\r\ndelegation wishes to express our appreciation to China\r\nfor its important initiative to present this draft\r\nresolution for consideration by the General Assembly.\r\nThe emergence of new epidemics in the twenty-\r\nfirst century has called for collective action from the\r\ninternational community on the basis of shared\r\nresponsibilities. Thailand hosted the special meeting of\r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)\r\nleaders and China in Bangkok in April 2003 to\r\nencourage strong political commitment and strengthen\r\ncooperation in order to contain severe acute respiratory\r\nsyndrome (SARS).\r\nThe success in combating severe acute respiratory\r\nsyndrome has proven that regional and international\r\ncooperation are vital to cope with the common threat of\r\ninfectious diseases. In that regard, Thailand joins other\r\ncountries in sponsoring this draft resolution and looks\r\nforward to its adoption by consensus. My delegation\r\nbelieves that adoption of this draft resolution will lead\r\nto significant enhancement of capacity-building in\r\nglobal public health. That is crucial for the\r\nstrengthening of global capacity to contain this\r\ncommon threat to our peoples.\r\nMr. Andrabi (Pakistan): One of the greatest\r\nchallenges that humanity faces in the twenty-first\r\ncentury is the spread of infectious diseases, both\r\nemerging and re-emerging. Although the exact sources\r\nof many new diseases are still being researched, the\r\nphenomenon of globalization — people coming into\r\ncloser contact with other people — has permitted a\r\njump of infectious agents across borders. This has\r\ngiven a global complexion to the problem. It needs a\r\nglobal response.\r\nInfectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS,\r\ntuberculosis and malaria have devastated millions of\r\npeople. The process of development in countries\r\nafflicted by those diseases has come to a grinding halt.\r\nThese epidemics have rolled back decades of progress\r\nand prosperity with their devastating effect. Public\r\nhealth has therefore acquired a very prominent place on\r\nthe development agenda. Economic growth and social\r\ndevelopment must go hand in hand, and the two need\r\nto complement each other.\r\nReversing the spread of major diseases by the end\r\nof 2015 is one of the development goals set out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. Last year, a new epidemic —\r\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome — broke out in more\r\nthan 30 countries and regions, causing over 800 deaths\r\nand more than 8,000 cases of infection. Its outbreak\r\nand spread pose a threat to public health undertakings.\r\nThe fact that its cause remains unknown heightens the\r\nlevel of threat. We commend the efforts made by China\r\nand other affected countries to take effective measures\r\nnot only to combat the epidemic, but also to control its\r\nspread. However, it has become quite clear that,\r\nwithout effective international cooperation, such\r\nproblems cannot be effectively dealt with.\r\nThis calls for closer international cooperation on\r\nthe basis of equality and mutual respect and benefit.\r\nSpecial attention needs to be paid to the establishment\r\nand improvement of the global contingency reaction\r\nmechanism. Simultaneously, the ability to respond\r\neffectively to such major health disasters also needs to\r\nbe enhanced. The United Nations system, therefore,\r\nneeds to consider integrating public health issues into\r\nits activities and programmes. The aim should be to\r\nfurther strengthen the capacity of Member States and to\r\nfacilitate international cooperation in public health.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, we consider the Chinese\r\ndraft resolution (A/58/L.5) a timely initiative and a\r\nmajor step in the right direction. We thank China for its\r\nefforts to draft a consensus resolution with broad\r\nsponsorship. Pakistan has fully supported this initiative\r\nsince its inception and has joined in sponsoring the\r\ndraft resolution. Adoption of this draft resolution by\r\nthe General Assembly would enable the international\r\ncommunity to effectively help developing countries\r\ndevelop their economies, improve the level of health\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\ncare and reduce the probability of the outbreak of\r\ndiseases.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/58/L.5, entitled “Enhancing capacity-\r\nbuilding in global public health”.\r\nI should like to announce that, since the\r\nintroduction of draft resolution A/58/L.5, the following\r\ncountries have become sponsors of the draft resolution:\r\nArgentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Eritrea, the former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Israel, Mali, the\r\nMarshall Islands, Norway, Switzerland, Ukraine and\r\nVenezuela.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/58/L.5?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution\r\n58/3).\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has thus\r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item\r\n60.\r\nAgenda items 55, 57, 58 and 59\r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly\r\nUnited Nations reform: measures and proposals\r\nRestructuring and revitalization of the United\r\nNations in the economic, social and related fields\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations system\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/57/786,\r\nA/58/175, A/58/351, A/58/382, A/58/395 and\r\nA/58/395/Corr.1)\r\nThe President: Members will recall that at the\r\n90th plenary meeting of the fifty-seventh session, held\r\non 18 June 2003, the General Assembly decided to\r\ndefer consideration of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral entitled “Strengthening of the United Nations:\r\nan agenda for further change: Intergovernmental\r\nreview of the medium-term plan and the programme\r\nbudget” (A/57/786) to the fifty-eighth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, under the item entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations system”.\r\nThe General Assembly begins discussion this\r\nmorning on a cluster of reform items. Particular\r\nattention will be focused on agenda item 55,\r\n“Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly”.\r\nDelegations will also wish to pay attention to the\r\nreports of the Secretary-General under item 59, which\r\ndescribe the actions taken by the Secretary-General in\r\nimplementation of Assembly resolution 57/300.\r\nFrom the time that I was elected President in June\r\nof this year, I have considered United Nations reform\r\nto be a matter of the highest priority. As Member States\r\nmay be aware, I have already begun to take practical\r\nsteps to streamline the work of the Assembly and to\r\nmake better use of the General Committee as a body\r\nproviding coordinating and oversight advise and\r\nsupport to the President.\r\nI have also begun to look into the provisions of\r\nvarious General Assembly resolutions that confer\r\nspecific responsibilities on the President, but which\r\nmay not have been implemented. Thus, for example, I\r\nprovided an assessment of the debate on the report of\r\nthe Security Council, an action that had been\r\nauthorized by the Assembly but not implemented.\r\nAs Chairman of the Assembly Working Group on\r\nrevitalization, I have a personal responsibility in\r\nrespect of item 55. I also have a deep, personal\r\ncommitment. The comments made by speakers in the\r\ngeneral debate, including those made by a large\r\nnumber of heads of State and Government, indicate\r\nthat Member States consider that the time has come for\r\nserious consideration to be given to a wide range of\r\nreform issues.\r\nReform and revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly figure prominently among those issues.\r\nSpeaker after speaker has also reaffirmed his or her\r\ncommitment to the Organization and the provisions of\r\nthe Charter. Having come here and made that\r\nreaffirmation, I believe that the leaders in capitals are\r\nnow looking to those of us in this Hall today to proceed\r\nfrom discussion to action. I trust therefore that the\r\ndebate that we are about to have will reflect this\r\napproach and that speakers will seek to be\r\nstraightforward and precise in expressing their views.\r\nIn order to move forward, we need to speak\r\nfrankly to each other and we need to make specific\r\nproposals. Upon the conclusion of this debate, I shall\r\nannounce the facilitators whom I have designated to\r\nmove the process forward. I will work closely with the\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\nfacilitators and coordinate their work. I will also\r\ndiscuss with them a time frame for the negotiation\r\nprocess. I have already sought to provide a framework\r\nfor action by way of the informal note that I circulated\r\na week and a half ago, which served as a background\r\npaper to the informal open-ended plenary consultations\r\nthat took place on 17 October. It seems to me that that\r\nmeeting went well and helped to launch our\r\ndeliberations on this item.\r\nBefore concluding, I extend a special welcome to\r\nthe Women’s International Forum, whose members\r\nimpressed me tremendously by their interest in matters\r\nrelating to the reform and revitalization of the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, respectively.\r\nI now call on the Deputy Secretary-General.\r\nThe Deputy Secretary-General: It is a great\r\npleasure for me to join the Assembly today to present\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report on implementation of\r\nhis agenda for further change, contained in document\r\nA/58/351.\r\nThis is a moment when the United Nations is\r\nfacing formidable challenges and wrestling with\r\nfundamental questions. The Secretary-General, in his\r\nspeech to the General Assembly at the opening of the\r\ngeneral debate, called for bold changes in order to\r\nensure that our Organization is up to the task. At the\r\nsame time, it is important not to lose sight of the\r\npractical measures and day-to-day steps that need to be\r\ntaken to strengthen, adapt and otherwise equip the\r\nUnited Nations to meet the tests of our times.\r\nA lot has already been achieved since the process\r\nof reform was initiated by the Secretary-General upon\r\ntaking office in 1997. The Millennium Declaration that\r\nthe Assembly adopted three years ago gives the world a\r\ncommon vision for the new century, including a set of\r\nDevelopment Goals that now serves as a template for\r\naction by the entire international system. Through the\r\nBrahimi report and other initiatives, we have made\r\nmajor improvements in our capacity to deploy and\r\nmanage complex peacekeeping and peace-building\r\noperations.\r\nWe have developed new mechanisms and\r\nprocedures to ensure that the disparate parts of the\r\nOrganization work better together both at headquarters\r\nand in the field. We have built strong new partnerships\r\nwith the private sector, civil society groups and others,\r\nbringing new energies to the pursuit of our common\r\ngoals. And we have stressed managerial reform more\r\nthan ever before in recognition of the need to\r\nmodernize our systems and our skills.\r\nLast year, the Secretary-General introduced an\r\n“agenda for further change” that sought to build on\r\nthese achievements and take into account important\r\ndevelopments in the international arena, most notably\r\nthe Millennium Declaration. The report now before the\r\nAssembly sets out what has been done to implement\r\nthe new agenda and describes the steps to be taken\r\nnext. It also, of course, reflects the guidance that the\r\nAssembly provided in last year’s resolution. Allow me\r\nto mention a few highlights.\r\nThe budget submitted this year represents a major\r\neffort to realign activities with priorities and to\r\nincrease attention to development issues, in particular\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral will offer greater details tomorrow in his\r\naddress to the Fifth Committee to introduce the 2004-\r\n2005 budget. The Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights has moved forward\r\nwith efforts to improve management and the services it\r\nprovides. Restructuring of the Department of Public\r\nInformation has taken place and the regional\r\ninformation centre for Western Europe will be fully\r\noperational next year. We have made major innovations\r\nin managing conferences and meetings, in particular\r\nthrough greater reliance on information technology.\r\nThe streamlining of reports, considered essential\r\nto better focus the work of the General Assembly, its\r\nsubsidiary bodies and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, has been initiated. A number of reports on\r\nrelated subjects were consolidated, leading to an\r\noverall reduction during this session of approximately\r\n20 reports from what was originally foreseen. Further\r\nprogress on this front will depend in large part on\r\ndecisions which the Member States can take in the\r\ncontext of the revitalization of the work of the General\r\nAssembly and the integrated follow-up to conferences.\r\nThe United Nations presence in developing\r\ncountries is being made more effective through\r\nsimplification and harmonization of procedures, joint\r\nprogramming, the pooling of resources, better\r\nknowledge management and improvements in the\r\nResident Coordinator system. A review of technical\r\ncooperation activities in key areas was carried out and\r\nis being transmitted to the Assembly in a separate\r\nreport. The review identifies the various Secretariat\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\nentities and operational agencies involved in the\r\nprovision of technical cooperation in a selected number\r\nof issues, as well as areas where further clarification of\r\nroles and responsibilities will be undertaken in order to\r\navoid duplication. It is hoped that this compendium\r\nwill be a useful source of information for programme\r\ncountries and the donor community.\r\nThe Panel Of Eminent Persons on United Nations\r\nRelations with Civil Society, which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral announced in his reform report last year, was\r\nformed last February. It is chaired by the former\r\nPresident of Brazil, Mr. Fernando Henrique Cardoso,\r\nand comprises 12 members from all regions of the\r\nworld. The Panel’s report is expected early in the new\r\nyear.\r\nWe are also continuing to make new investments\r\nin our staff through training. With the appointment of a\r\nnew Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources,\r\nrenewed impetus will be given to the implementation\r\nof the measures identified in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport last year, particularly as regards staff mobility\r\nand career prospects for General Service staff.\r\nSome of the reform activities I have just\r\nmentioned are covered in greater detail in\r\ncomplementary reports. These are identified in the\r\nreport before the Assembly today and should be read in\r\nconjunction with it. While implementation is under\r\nway on all elements of the Secretary-General’s reform\r\npackage of last year, there is one major piece of\r\nunfinished business. I refer here to the reform of the\r\nplanning and budgeting system.\r\nThe Secretary-General argued in his report last\r\nyear that the process needs to be more strategic and\r\nresults-oriented, and less time-consuming. He proposed\r\nchanges to the format and content of the budget\r\ndocument. He proposed that the strategic framework\r\nfor the Organization should consist of a medium-term\r\nplan covering a two-year period, combined with the\r\nbudget outline. He also suggested that the Committee\r\nfor Programme and Coordination shift its focus to\r\nmonitoring and evaluating the work of the United\r\nNations — critical functions that are all too often\r\noverlooked or given short shrift — rather than\r\nreplicating the reviews of plans and budgets already\r\ndone by other bodies.\r\nThe Assembly did not reach decisions on most of\r\nthose issues last year, and requested supplementary\r\ninformation. That information is contained in\r\ndocuments A/57/786 and A/58/395. The changes\r\nproposed are not dramatic, but if adopted they would\r\nsignificantly improve the quality of the budget process\r\nwhile reducing the amount of time and the quantity of\r\ndocumentation that go into it. I hope that the Assembly\r\nwill take a decision before the end of the year so that\r\nthe changes can shape the way in which the budget for\r\n2006-2007 is developed.\r\nReform is not a single, specific destination.\r\nRather, it is a wide-ranging — indeed, an all-\r\nencompassing — journey. Ultimately it is a state of\r\nmind — an openness to new ideas and partners, a\r\ncontinuous search for better ways of doing our work, a\r\ncommitment to excellence, a talent for focusing on\r\nwhat matters, an appetite for service.\r\nAll of the reforms, big and small, swift or slow,\r\ninternal or intergovernmental, that have been achieved\r\nshow not only that the United Nations can change, but\r\nthat change is an integral part of the way we do\r\nbusiness. Indeed, change has been our métier since our\r\nearliest days. We all look forward to wise decisions in\r\nthe days ahead that will enable us to keep it so for the\r\nfuture.\r\nMr. Dauth (Australia): I have the honour to\r\naddress the Assembly on behalf of Canada, New\r\nZealand and Australia. I also wish to associate my\r\ndelegation with the statement that the Foreign Minister\r\nof Fiji will deliver on behalf of the Pacific Islands\r\nForum.\r\nCanada, New Zealand and Australia are\r\nconvinced that the need for reform in the United\r\nNations is more pressing than ever before. The\r\nSecretary-General is right to say that the United\r\nNations has reached a historic fork in the road. We are\r\nencouraged by our sense that there is greater realization\r\nof this, and believe that a rare opportunity for us to act\r\nwill exist this year and perhaps next year. After that, it\r\nmay be too late.\r\nToday’s debate covers reform processes in several\r\nparts of the United Nations, and I will mention a few of\r\nthem specifically. The common problem faced by all\r\nideas for change in the United Nations is generating\r\nenough political will to overcome the inertia intrinsic\r\nto an Organization governed by 191 sovereign\r\nMembers. Certainly, there is no lack of good reform\r\nideas here. But a decade of labours towards revitalizing\r\nthe Assembly and making the Security Council more\r\nrepresentative has, frankly, produced few results.\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\nThe bright spot has been the leadership of the\r\nSecretary-General — ably assisted by the Deputy\r\nSecretary-General, Ms. Fréchette — who has achieved\r\nwelcome progress in modernizing and improving the\r\nSecretariat. The Brahimi peacekeeping reforms will\r\nstand as another of his achievements. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral recently announced a new panel that will\r\nexamine the policy challenges facing the Organization\r\nand the institutional structures needed to meet them.\r\nSuch an examination is very timely and much needed.\r\nThe panel should consult widely with Member States\r\nand be bold in its analysis and recommendations. Our\r\ndelegations stand ready to contribute, and we look\r\nforward to receiving the Secretary-General’s proposals\r\nnext year. In the meantime, however, there is plenty\r\nthat needs doing.\r\nA year ago, the Secretary-General presented the\r\nAssembly with a fresh agenda for reform (see\r\nA/57/387). This year he has given us a progress report,\r\nsubmitted several detailed reports on specific proposals\r\nand requested our approval for other reforms in the\r\n2004-2005 budget.\r\nResolution 57/300 broadly welcomed the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposals. Since then, we have\r\nbeen disappointed that, whatever reform actions have\r\nbeen discussed, there has been resistance or opposition\r\nfrom one quarter or another. For instance, in the\r\nCommittee on Programme and Coordination in June,\r\nevery one of the reform measures proposed in the\r\nbudget was criticized and efforts were mounted to\r\nblock several of them.\r\nThis year, with elaborated and refined proposals\r\nbefore it, the Assembly needs to take decisions. Our\r\ndelegations will give full support to the implementation\r\nof the Secretary-General’s measures in all\r\nintergovernmental bodies.\r\nMany proposals have now been referred to the\r\nFifth Committee. Reform must be the abiding theme of\r\ndeliberations and decisions there. The Fifth Committee\r\nhas a particular responsibility to advance management\r\nand administrative reforms that make the Organization\r\nstronger and more effective.\r\nOur delegations attach special importance to the\r\nrequest by the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights for a greater share of\r\nthe regular budget. In particular, we support the new\r\nposts to strengthen the human rights treaty bodies, in\r\nline with the Secretary-General’s recommendations.\r\nThe budget, planning and evaluation cycle is of\r\ncritical importance to the Organization. That cycle\r\nbrings together the many legislative mandates created\r\nby the Assembly and the Economic and Social Council\r\nand their subsidiaries, and it matches them with the\r\nfinite resources available to the Organization.\r\nThe two reports before us on improvements to the\r\ncurrent process of planning and budgeting (A/57/786\r\nand A/58/395) offer a compelling diagnosis of flaws in\r\nthe current process. Taken as a whole, the process is so\r\nprotracted and burdensome that it disenfranchises the\r\nmajority of Member States. The medium-term plan, as\r\nnow constructed, leads to rigidity in the Secretariat’s\r\nwork and inhibits our ability to respond to changing\r\ncircumstances. Programmes and resources are\r\nconsidered on separate tracks, undermining the\r\ndevelopment of results-based budgeting. Furthermore,\r\nprogrammatic evaluation does not feed back into the\r\nplanning and budgeting cycle.\r\nWe consider that modest refinements of the\r\nprocess could lead to significant improvements. Our\r\napproach is based on five principles. First, the process\r\nshould better support results-based budgeting;\r\nsecondly, programme and resource decisions should be\r\nintegrated; thirdly, Member States should be able to\r\ngive strategic policy direction; fourthly, evaluation of\r\nresults must be effective and affect planning; and\r\nlastly, the intergovernmental organs must spend less\r\ntime on reviewing the budget.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s proposals offer a way\r\nforward and a starting point for our discussions. But we\r\nwill take a flexible and creative approach to finding a\r\nset of reforms that serves all of us better and makes the\r\nOrganization stronger.\r\nWe welcome your efforts, Mr. President, to inject\r\nlife into the process of revitalizing the General\r\nAssembly. Our delegations believe that revitalization\r\nneeds to start with the second of the two areas that you\r\nhave identified: improved working methods. The\r\nagenda is the core of the malaise in the Assembly. It is\r\noverloaded, outdated, highly repetitive and often of\r\nmarginal relevance, even in the capitals of Member\r\nStates, let alone to their peoples. As everyone knows,\r\nthe Assembly spends most of its time negotiating the\r\nsame resolutions, year after year.\r\nWe must start with a thorough reappraisal of the\r\nagenda. We could, for example, envisage a streamlined\r\nagenda of a limited number of items relevant in terms\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\nof contemporary problems and challenges. Such an\r\nagenda would be established anew for each Assembly\r\nsession. We need to concentrate on resolutions that are\r\nmeaningful and can be implemented. At the same time,\r\nwe should evaluate the committee structure and\r\nreshape it to fit a new agenda that focuses on the major\r\nissues facing the globe today.\r\nOnly by making fundamental changes to its work\r\nprogramme and methods can we restore the authority\r\nand prestige of the Assembly. While the biennialization\r\nof some items has helped to rationalize the agenda, that\r\nis not enough to turn the Assembly into the thriving\r\ncentre of the multilateral system that it ought to be.\r\nThe revitalization process has yielded so little not\r\nbecause of a lack of good ideas, but because of a lack\r\nof political will. If the Assembly is going to be\r\nrevitalized, then all Member States need to reassess\r\ntheir positions and be prepared to adapt their\r\npreferences to accommodate those of others. Without\r\nrecognition by all parties of our shared interest in a\r\nproductive and effective multilateral system, the\r\nAssembly will continue to wither.\r\nThe common challenge facing proposals for\r\nreform is to create political will and generate\r\nmomentum. Our endeavours to make the United\r\nNations more productive and effective assume even\r\ngreater importance in this complex and daunting\r\ninternational environment.\r\nMr. Tavola (Fiji): I have the honour to speak on\r\nbehalf of the members of the Pacific Islands Forum that\r\nare represented at the United Nations: Australia, the\r\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States\r\nof Micronesia, Nauru, New Zealand, Papua New\r\nGuinea, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu,\r\nVanuatu and my own country, Fiji.\r\nThe Pacific Islands Forum comprises both\r\ndeveloping and developed countries. We are\r\npredominantly small States. We share a strong interest\r\nin making the United Nations and its processes more\r\nefficient, because we have limited resources ourselves\r\nand because a more efficient Organization will give the\r\nUnited Nations greater credibility worldwide. We share\r\na strong interest in reforms that will enhance the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations and focus the\r\nOrganization and its constituent parts on today’s\r\npriorities.\r\nThe case for reform has been made and, in our\r\nview, is widely accepted. We agree with those who\r\nsense that the prospects for reform look brighter than\r\nthey have in the past. We must seize the opportunity.\r\nOur task is to engage in processes that will deliver\r\nspecific reforms on which we can all agree. Several\r\nreforms are under way, because reform is necessary at\r\na number of levels.\r\nAt the highest level, we need to look at the role of\r\nour major governance organs and the relationship\r\namong them. Secondly, we need to continue work on\r\nstrengthening the United Nations as an organization.\r\nThirdly, we need to breathe new life into the General\r\nAssembly. Those areas of reform are closely linked; I\r\nwill comment on each.\r\nThe Pacific Islands Forum fully supports the\r\nSecretary-General’s initiative to establish a high-level\r\npanel to review the functioning of our major bodies and\r\nconsider reforms to our institutions and processes. The\r\nSecretary-General rightly places that review in the\r\ncontext of an examination of global challenges to the\r\nUnited Nations, particularly — but not exclusively —\r\nchallenges to peace and security. The panel should not\r\nshy away from difficult, fundamental questions. We\r\nurge all Member States to be open to the process.\r\nWhile many may have anxieties about the options and\r\nthe potential implications of those options, we should\r\nnot step away from exploring the possibilities. The\r\npanel will need to consult widely, and we look to it to\r\nprovide an independent, honest and fresh assessment of\r\nwhere we go from here.\r\nLast December, we adopted resolution 57/300,\r\nwhich goes some way towards strengthening the United\r\nNations. Good progress has been made, but much\r\nremains to be done. Our delegations are committed and\r\nsupportive of this ongoing process. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s progress report (A/58/351) reflects a\r\nsubstantive effort across a very broad range of United\r\nNations activities, spanning human rights, the\r\nOrganization’s outreach to civil society and the private\r\nsector, and strengthening the effectiveness of the\r\nUnited Nations presence in developing countries. Some\r\nof those proposals are well developed, and the ideas\r\nthat underpin them are not new. We support the overall\r\ndirection and leadership provided by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. We agree that the budget for 2004-2005\r\nprovides a good vehicle for implementing many\r\nproposals, and we shall follow these discussions very\r\nclosely.\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\nThe Pacific Forum group of Member States has a\r\nparticular interest in strengthening United Nations\r\noperational activities for development, and we strongly\r\nsupport the thrust of the Organization’s work in that\r\narea. The work of the United Nations Development\r\nGroup and the strengthening of the resident coordinator\r\nsystem have been positive developments. We strongly\r\nsupport continuing to improve coordination among\r\nUnited Nations funds and programmes, in particular\r\nthrough the simplification and harmonization of their\r\nwork. The aim of reducing transaction costs is a\r\nparticularly important one for developing countries in\r\nthe Pacific, given their generally small size and the\r\nconstraints on their capacity. Australia and New\r\nZealand, as regional donors, also support that aim as a\r\nmeans of ensuring that contributions to United Nations\r\ndevelopment activities are used to best effect. The\r\nappointment of lead United Nations agencies to\r\ncoordinate sector-wide inputs is another positive\r\ndevelopment. It could add welcome flexibility to\r\nenable United Nations agencies to work together\r\ncoherently in partnership with host Governments, while\r\nat the same time reducing unnecessary duplication of\r\nreporting and other activities.\r\nWe also welcome the improved focus on post-\r\nconflict transition. That is an area where United\r\nNations funds and programmes have provided useful\r\ninput in two Pacific Islands Forum member countries,\r\nthe Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. These\r\nongoing reforms are important in an increasingly field-\r\nbased Organization, and our delegations look forward\r\nto discussions during next year’s triennial policy\r\nreview of operational activities.\r\nIn the area of strengthening human rights, we\r\nwelcome the recognition in the report of the\r\nimportance of the role of national human rights\r\ninstitutions. We should also like to see better targeting\r\nof technical assistance in support of the treaty body and\r\nspecial procedures systems. We need to find pragmatic\r\nsolutions to the demands that increased treaty body\r\nreporting and compliance place on small States.\r\nMr. President, the Pacific Islands Forum\r\nwelcomes your own recent initiative to provide a\r\nframework for revitalization of the General Assembly.\r\nThe Forum fully supports proposals that will make the\r\nGeneral Assembly more efficient in its operation and\r\nmore focused and relevant in the issues it addresses.\r\nWe would emphasize that we seek changes not in order\r\nto diminish the role of the General Assembly, but in\r\norder to enhance its relevance. We recognize that, for\r\nall of us, there will be a balance between national and\r\ncollective interests. But at its heart, the United Nations\r\nis about the collective good, and achieving effective\r\ncollective action may require us at times to rise above\r\nnational interests.\r\nMr. President, your informal note usefully sets\r\nout the possible areas of reform under two broad\r\nheadings. You have highlighted a number of specific\r\nproposals. These and others will need to be developed\r\nand discussed. We look to the process being transparent\r\nand inclusive and welcome your intention to appoint\r\nfacilitators. There is also an important role for\r\nindividual committee-based discussions involving a\r\nbottom-up as well as a top-down approach.\r\nIn many ways, it is the plenary of the General\r\nAssembly that needs most attention. If debates are\r\npoorly attended and have little impact, we need to ask\r\nwhy. We need to think more about what role we want\r\nthe General Assembly to play. In the view of the\r\nPacific Islands Forum, the plenary should address key\r\ncurrent issues in a way that enhances the authority of\r\nthe General Assembly. The Assembly should provide\r\nstrategic guidance to the rest of the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nWe fully support the basic concept of the general\r\ndebate. It is the one time of the year when a large\r\nnumber of Heads of Government and ministers engage\r\nwith the United Nations and with each other. Formal\r\nstatements setting out national positions and priorities\r\nare important, but beyond this we believe that, where\r\npossible, plenary sessions should involve a much more\r\ninteractive exchange of views on priority issues. The\r\nterm “debate” should not be a euphemism. There will,\r\nof course, be differences in the priority individual\r\nMember States attach to particular issues. That should\r\nnot surprise us, but we can probably agree on many of\r\nthe priorities for discussion and find creative ways of\r\nmanaging situations where we cannot presently agree.\r\nWe also support thematic debates if they can be\r\nconstructed to encourage meaningful discussion with\r\noutcomes that enhance the role of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. President, you have rightly referred to the\r\npossibility of rationalizing existing agenda items. We\r\nthink, by way of example, that our consideration of\r\nreform itself has become somewhat splintered and that\r\na combined interactive debate on all aspects of United\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\nNations reform might be useful. It would focus on\r\nMembers’ broad views on the reforms they wished to\r\npursue, with details being discussed in more informal\r\nsettings.\r\nOn the other side, we wonder whether there are\r\nmajor current issues that this Assembly should be, but\r\nis currently not discussing. For example, peacekeeping\r\nis among the United Nations most important activities\r\nand has a high public profile. Should not the General\r\nAssembly, at its highest level, be discussing\r\npeacekeeping issues? We would envisage such a\r\ndiscussion looking at the broader process of United\r\nNations intervention, from conflict prevention through\r\npeacekeeping to the United Nations role in post-\r\nconflict situations. These issues have development as\r\nwell as political and security aspects and bridge\r\ndiscussions taking place in a number of committees.\r\nUnder the Charter, these are legitimate concerns of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nHow we discuss issues is as important as the\r\nissues we discuss. If the plenary remains no more than\r\na formal venue for delivering national statements, then,\r\nin terms of promoting the collective will of the United\r\nNations, we will not be able to make it more relevant to\r\nthe outside world.\r\nMr. Løvald (Norway): Let me begin by thanking\r\nthe Deputy Secretary-General for personally\r\nintroducing the Secretary-General’s reports on United\r\nNations reform. The Deputy Secretary-General’s\r\ncommitment and dedication to United Nations reform\r\nare truly appreciated.\r\nAllow me also to pay particular tribute to you,\r\nSir, for the work you have invested in attempting to\r\nrevitalize and improve the working methods of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. There seems to be a willingness of\r\nMember States to take a closer look at how to improve\r\nthe General Assembly, including the various\r\nCommittees. We must take advantage of this growing\r\nmomentum, and let me assure you, Sir, that Norway\r\nstands ready to support you in the weeks and months\r\nahead.\r\nIn keeping with the prevailing reform spirit, I\r\nshall limit my intervention to a few main points, while\r\ncirculating the full text of my prepared remarks.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s opening statement to the\r\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly inspired\r\nus all to take a new look at United Nations reform. We\r\nshare the Secretary-General’s vision of global\r\nsolidarity and security. Norway supports reforms\r\nleading to a more representative Security Council. We\r\nwould like to see a more effective and efficient General\r\nAssembly with a better managed and more relevant\r\nagenda. The Economic and Social Council should be a\r\nreal force in international development cooperation and\r\na true partner to the Bretton Woods institutions. After\r\nyears of discussions in working groups and other\r\nforums, we always seem to reach a stalemate. We\r\ntherefore applaud the establishment of a high-level\r\nPanel of Eminent Persons to review these issues and\r\nrecommend ways of strengthening the United Nations.\r\nWe look forward to their findings and\r\nrecommendations.\r\nWe need not wait for the recommendations of the\r\nPanel, however. There are measures that we can\r\nimplement during the current session of the General\r\nAssembly. This leads me to the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposals and recommendations, as contained in the\r\nreports prepared pursuant to last year’s resolution\r\n57/300, as well as to your concrete proposals,\r\nMr. President. They are all important building blocks in\r\nthe overarching reform of the United Nations.\r\nLet me highlight some aspects of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals and our views on them. Norway\r\nwelcomes the emphasis on human rights in the report\r\nbefore us in document A/58/351. The work of the\r\nSecretary-General and the High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights in integrating human rights into all\r\nUnited Nations activities, particularly in areas such as\r\nhumanitarian affairs, conflict prevention and\r\npeacekeeping, is of utmost importance. True respect for\r\nand protection of human rights starts at home. We\r\napplaud the concerted effort under way to provide an\r\nintegrated and consistent response to Member States’\r\nrequests for support in strengthening their national\r\nhuman rights systems. The ongoing work for enhanced\r\nimplementation of human rights treaties, as well as for\r\nimproving the system of special procedures, is both\r\ntimely and necessary.\r\nIncreasing the effectiveness of development\r\nassistance is a prerequisite for achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Improving the\r\nconsistency and coordination of United Nations\r\nactivities at the country level and increasing\r\nprogramme effectiveness is, in that respect, essential.\r\nWe thus support the Secretary-General’s proposals on\r\nstrengthening the role, authority and capacity of the\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\nUnited Nations Resident Coordinator, making the\r\nCoordinator the leader of a truly integrated United\r\nNations country team. Norway is encouraged by the\r\ncontributions and advances that the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Group is making in the area of\r\ncoordination and joint programming. A strengthened\r\nUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework\r\nand new joint programming tools are important and\r\npractical ways of moving this process ahead.\r\nCommitment to United Nations reform will be a\r\nsignificant factor in our assessment of the various\r\nagencies and a precondition for further and increased\r\nNorwegian contributions. During the triennial\r\ncomprehensive policy review next year, we will have\r\nthe opportunity to assess whether or not we are\r\nprogressing as rapidly as we would wish.\r\nThe Secretary-General has already taken action\r\nand made changes and improvements in a number of\r\nimportant fields. We note with satisfaction that these\r\nchanges and reallocations of resources are concentrated\r\nin areas where we all share the same priorities. His\r\nactions clearly show an increased attention to\r\ndevelopment issues and particularly the special needs\r\nof Africa. There is also a new emphasis on an\r\nimproved and enlightened human resources strategy\r\nand continued efforts to improve the Organization’s\r\nmanagement in general. We applaud those changes.\r\nThe revised budget format is a first important step\r\nin pursuing the Organization’s priorities as defined by\r\nthe Millennium Declaration and recent global\r\nconferences. The Secretary-General has proposed\r\nfurther improvements to the planning and budgeting\r\nsystem, including a shorter and more strategic medium-\r\nterm plan that is linked to the budget and a single-stage\r\nintergovernmental review of the budget. The\r\nNorwegian Government supports those changes.\r\nThere are other areas in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreform programme where consensus is not as apparent.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration promises to give greater\r\nopportunities to the private sector, non-governmental\r\norganizations and civil society in general to contribute\r\nto the realization of the Organization’s goals and\r\nprogrammes. The United Nations has different rules\r\nand practices for its various bodies. There is no system\r\nof accreditation to the General Assembly.\r\nWe are particularly keen on finding ways to make\r\nit easier for civil society actors and non-governmental\r\norganizations from the developing countries to play\r\ncentral roles in United Nations activities. This will also\r\nfacilitate mobilization of the enormous resources of\r\ncivil society for development cooperation. We\r\ntherefore have great expectations as regards the\r\nupcoming recommendations of the Secretary-General’s\r\nPanel of Eminent Persons on United Nations Relations\r\nwith Civil Society.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to return to your\r\nappeal, Mr. President, for concrete proposals as regards\r\nthe working methods of the General Assembly. I would\r\nlike, however, to remind the Assembly that there have\r\nindeed been improvements in our working methods in\r\nthe past few years. Agenda items and debates have\r\nbeen successfully merged, most recently during our\r\nconsideration a few days ago of issues related to Africa\r\nand the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD). Perhaps we should aim to make some\r\nconcrete improvements in the area of resolutions as\r\nwell. Resolutions and decisions are, after all, the main\r\nproducts of our work. We should look at ways of\r\nmaking them more operational and relevant. We do not\r\nneed resolutions that are lengthy documents with the\r\nsame text, year after year.\r\nPerhaps the General Assembly should consider\r\nsome limitations or guidelines on the length and\r\ncomposition of, and degree of repetition in, its\r\nresolutions. I believe that we should look to the\r\npractices of the funds and programmes in this respect.\r\nAs to our lengthy agenda, it is indeed symptomatic of\r\nthe problem that our discussions today cover four\r\nagenda items, two of them without any content or\r\nreporting requirements. Why, then, are they still on our\r\nagenda?\r\nNorway is convinced that under the leadership of\r\nthe Secretary-General, the Deputy Secretary-General\r\nand, more directly, under your leadership, Sir, Member\r\nStates will rise to the occasion and take decisive action\r\nthat will improve the efficiency of this most important\r\nof all multilateral institutions.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf the Non-Aligned Movement Working Group\r\non the revitalization of the General Assembly and the\r\nreform of the United Nations.\r\nMr. President, the main point that the Non-\r\nAligned Movement Working Group wishes to convey\r\ntoday is its strong support for your continued efforts\r\ntowards an authentic and genuine revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, so as to restore its central position\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\nas the chief deliberative, policy-making and\r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations, as set out in\r\nparagraph 30 of the Millennium Declaration.\r\nWe would like also to express our sincere\r\nappreciation to you, Sir, for having presented the non-\r\npaper that you and your competent team prepared,\r\nwhich we believe constitutes an excellent basis for\r\ntoday’s debate as well as for our future efforts aimed at\r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly.\r\nWe particularly appreciate the fact that you have\r\nindicated that you will take the lead in pursuing efforts\r\nto advance the process of revitalization. In this context,\r\nI can assure you of the full confidence of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement Working Group and its support for\r\nyour undertaking.\r\nThe Working Group attaches great importance to\r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly and to\r\nimproving its efficiency, and would like to take this\r\nopportunity to reiterate its willingness to participate\r\nactively in that important process.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement welcomes the steps\r\nyou have proposed and most of the measures outlined\r\nin the non-paper, which correspond to the position and\r\nthe approach adopted by the Working Group\r\nconcerning the issue of the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly. An assessment of the progress achieved so\r\nfar in the process of revitalizing the General Assembly,\r\nwhich started in the early 1990s, is needed before any\r\nadditional measures in this regard can be considered.\r\nSince 1993, the General Assembly has adopted\r\nseveral resolutions aimed at rationalizing its working\r\nmethods and improving its efficiency. Among those\r\nresolutions, let me recall in particular resolutions\r\n47/233 of 17 August 1993, 48/264 of 29 July 1994,\r\n51/241 of 31 July 1997, 55/285 of 10 September 2001,\r\n57/301 of 17 March 2003 and many other resolutions\r\nlisted in the background information paper that you\r\nhave circulated.\r\nThe measures outlined in the aforementioned\r\nresolutions put more emphasis on the rationalization of\r\nthe agenda of the General Assembly and its working\r\nmethods and less on the substantive aspects of the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly.\r\nThe measures taken for the rationalization of the\r\nagenda — clustering and the biennialization and\r\ntriannualization of items — and the working methods\r\nof the General Assembly and its Main Committees\r\nhave contributed, to a certain extent, to a better\r\nfunctioning of the Assembly. However, those measures\r\nhave had minimal impact in helping to achieve the\r\nmain goal set out in paragraph 30 of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nEqually important is the need fully to comply\r\nwith the relevant guidelines on the rationalization of\r\nthe agenda of the plenary and of the respective agendas\r\nof the main Committees, as outlined in annex 1 of\r\nresolution 48/264 and in the rules of procedure of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThese guidelines are the following. First, agenda\r\nitems concerning issues of closely related substance\r\ncould be merged within a single agenda item or be\r\nincorporated as sub-items where this is possible\r\nwithout any loss of focus on the items or sub-items\r\nconcerned. Secondly, items that cover related matters\r\nor issues could be considered in agreed clusters.\r\nThirdly, biennialization and triennialization of items on\r\nthe agenda of the Main Committees could be\r\nconsidered. Fourthly and lastly, the existing broad\r\ndivision of work among the Main Committees should\r\nbe maintained.\r\nThe purpose of the process of the revitalization of\r\nthe General Assembly is defined in paragraph 1 of the\r\nannex to resolution 55/285. In that paragraph, it is\r\nstated that:\r\n“The process of revitalizing the General\r\nAssembly and improving its efficiency focuses on\r\nthe implementation of existing Assembly\r\nresolutions and decisions … Improvement of the\r\nprocedures and working methods of the Assembly\r\nis only a first step towards more substantive\r\nimprovements in and revitalization of the\r\nAssembly. The goal of this ongoing process is to\r\nenable the Assembly to play its role effectively as\r\nthe chief deliberative, policy-making and\r\nrepresentative body of the United Nations”.\r\nAs you have indicated in your non-paper,\r\nMr. President, there are a number of measures\r\ncontained in various resolutions, particularly\r\nresolutions 51/241 and 55/285, which have not been\r\nimplemented. We appreciate the action you have taken\r\nso far in giving effect to some of those measures and\r\nlook forward to further action to ensure their full\r\nimplementation, including that of the measure\r\ncontained in paragraph 12 of the annex to resolution\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\n51/241, regarding General Assembly consideration of\r\nthe report of the Security Council.\r\nAs part of the efforts aimed at resolving the\r\nproblem of late issuance of documents and its negative\r\nimpact on the work of the Assembly, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in his report entitled “Strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations: an agenda for further change”\r\n(A/57/387), proposed certain measures to streamline\r\ndocumentation, such as consolidating documents on\r\nrelated subjects, requiring reports to be sharper with\r\nmore clearly defined recommendations for action, and\r\nobserving a stipulated page limit of 16 pages. These\r\nmeasures, particularly the consolidation of\r\ndocuments — mainly those to be considered by the\r\nThird Committee and the Second Committee — will be\r\nreviewed in the context of the follow-up to resolution\r\n57/300.\r\nAll these measures aimed at rationalizing the\r\nprocedures and working methods of the General\r\nAssembly have had a positive effect on the functioning\r\nof the Assembly. However, a genuine and authentic\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly can be achieved\r\nonly through additional bold and innovative measures\r\nthat address the problem of the relative marginalization\r\nof the Assembly and its relationship with the other\r\norgans of the United Nations, especially the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nDuring its last meeting, the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement working group considered the two broad\r\nareas outlined in your non-paper, Mr. President,\r\nnamely, enhancing the role and authority of the General\r\nAssembly and improving its working methods, and\r\ndiscussed some of the concrete proposals contained\r\ntherein. However, given the time constraints, the\r\nworking group was not able to consider thoroughly all\r\nthe specific measures you proposed. The Non-Aligned\r\nMovement will therefore continue to study carefully\r\nthe proposals put forward in the non-paper, so as to\r\nreflect on them in the context of the informal\r\nconsultations you intend to convene in mid-November\r\n2003.\r\nAt this stage of the process aimed at revitalizing\r\nthe Assembly, the Non-Aligned Movement would like\r\nto put on the record the following.\r\nFirst, the Non-Aligned Movement believes that\r\nthe strengthening of the Office of the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly would be a concrete measure to\r\nincrease the efficiency and effectiveness of the\r\nAssembly, and we cannot but support such a measure.\r\nA well staffed Office would provide the requisite\r\nsubstantive support to the President to enable him to\r\nplay a leadership role, would provide continuity and\r\ninstitutional memory to the Office of the presidency\r\nand would enrich the substantive content of proposals\r\nemanating from the Office of the President. The Non-\r\nAligned Movement will, in due time, articulate and\r\nsubmit a concrete proposal in that regard.\r\nSecondly, the Non-Aligned Movement supports\r\nthe proposals aimed at programming the consideration\r\nof agenda items over the full year of the session, rather\r\nthan concentrating them in the period from September\r\nto December, as is the current practice. If General\r\nAssembly agenda items could be grouped according to\r\ntheir importance and urgency, such sequencing could\r\nmake effective use of the whole year. That would\r\nreduce the burden put on small and medium-size\r\ndelegations and enable them to participate effectively\r\nin the negotiation process and in the huge number of\r\nmeetings — more than 6,000 — held each year at\r\nHeadquarters in New York.\r\nThirdly, the Non-Aligned Movement believes that\r\nMember States have an important role to play in\r\nimplementing resolutions, particularly their sponsors,\r\nwhich could take more responsibility in that regard. On\r\nthe other hand, there are some resolutions that have not\r\nbeen implemented because of a lack of resources and it\r\nis essential in those cases that adequate resources be\r\nallocated to ensure their implementation.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement welcomes the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal to establish a high-level\r\npanel for the reform of the principal organs of the\r\nOrganization and the review of their effectiveness,\r\ntheir coherence and the balance of roles and\r\nresponsibilities among them. The imminent\r\npersonalities who will be members of the panel should\r\nmeet important requirements such as high integrity,\r\ncompetence and neutrality, and should be\r\nknowledgeable about the functioning and the\r\nintricacies of the Organization.\r\nMr. Acosta Bonilla (Honduras), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nFurther, we believe that the panel should also take\r\ninto account what has been accomplished so far in the\r\nvarious processes of institutional reform. The\r\nMovement believes that the current revitalization\r\nexercise, and whatever exercise we may engage in\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\nregarding the reform of the Security Council, should at\r\nsome point converge with the new process initiated by\r\nthe Secretary-General.\r\nThose are a few of the ideas we wanted to share\r\nat this stage. The Non-Aligned Movement working\r\ngroup is still considering and working on further\r\nproposals. I intend during the coming weeks to submit\r\nto the President and to the whole membership some\r\nconcrete proposals which we hope will strengthen the\r\nefficiency of the work of the General Assembly and\r\nenhance its political role as the chief deliberative,\r\npolicy-making and representative body of the United\r\nNations. It is also our intention to fully cooperate with\r\nthe President and to interact with all groups and\r\ndelegations to achieve that goal.\r\nMr. Bennouna (Morocco) (spoke in French): I\r\nwould like to speak on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina. I am pleased to speak after my Algerian brother,\r\nAmbassador Baali, because we also hope to coordinate\r\nour efforts with the Malaysian presidency of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement in our important task of United\r\nNations reform.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to extend to\r\nthe Secretary-General the sincere congratulations of the\r\nGroup of 77 on all his efforts to foster his agenda for\r\nchange, designed to refocus United Nations activities\r\non priorities which we, as Member States, laid down in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration and in the major United\r\nNations conferences and summits held in recent years.\r\nReform is a process. This process requires a\r\nstrategy and priorities to address all the challenges of\r\nglobalization. The challenges for us in the Group of 77\r\nare, first of all, the reduction of poverty, as well as the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\r\nbecause the two go together: there can be no\r\nmaintenance of peace, strictly speaking, without\r\neconomic security. But this also pertains to all of what\r\nwe now call the new threats to peace, and especially to\r\nthe campaign to combat international terrorism.\r\nOur objective is to best serve humankind, to\r\nimprove the standard of living of millions of people\r\nwho are suffering the ordeals of poverty, illness and all\r\nthe other devastating scourges. That is the principle of\r\nour collective action, which should guide us when we\r\ntalk about reform and which must be followed with\r\nrespect for the basic values that informed the birth of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nWe are convinced that reform of the multilateral\r\ninstitutions is more necessary than ever to enable those\r\ninstitutions, under optimal circumstances, to adapt to\r\nthe new problems and new situations facing the world.\r\nThis common exercise should be accompanied by a\r\nsustained effort and by real determination to strengthen\r\nour collective action and realize the objectives of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nReform is not an end in itself. Its main objective\r\nis to strengthen international cooperation and to ensure\r\nthe fulfilment of commitments entered into during\r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits, with a view\r\nto enabling the developing countries, especially the\r\npoorest and least developed among them, to attain the\r\nMillennium Development Goals for the economic and\r\nsocial well-being of their peoples.\r\nStrengthening our Organization requires an\r\noverhaul of the architecture of the intergovernmental\r\nbodies and of their work programmes and methods —\r\nprimarily the General Assembly, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and the Security Council.\r\nRegarding the Security Council, the organ with\r\nthe primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, it is obvious that the\r\nconditions which led to agreement on its membership\r\nand functioning have changed profoundly. Therefore,\r\nthe question of Security Council reform should be on\r\nthe agenda of meetings among our leaders, so that they\r\ncan outline Council reforms that we would then refine\r\nin New York so they may then be placed in the context\r\nof a reformed Charter.\r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly is at\r\nthe heart of the necessary United Nations reform. It\r\ncannot be carried out piecemeal but must be part of a\r\nconsistent approach. All efforts must be channelled\r\ntowards the objectives which our heads of State or\r\nGovernment set out in the general debate during this\r\nsession of the General Assembly, so as to ensure the\r\npositive involvement of expertise and political will. All\r\nparties involved in international relations have\r\nexpressed their support for this reform, in the\r\nconviction that a more efficient organization better\r\nadapted to the post-cold-war world is in the interest of\r\nall members of the family of nations, whatever their\r\nsize, religion or culture.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China was created in the\r\n1960s to work together for the democratization of\r\ninternational relations by eliminating the major\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\ndisparities which divided the members of the\r\ninternational community. Strengthening the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations has thus always\r\nbeen among our priorities. It should enable us to act\r\nbetter to reduce poverty and eliminate the most serious\r\nsocial problems.\r\nSince the adoption of the Millennium Declaration\r\nwe have spared no effort towards the convening of\r\nmajor international conferences on sustainable\r\ndevelopment, financing of development or international\r\ntrade. This year, thanks to the efforts of all, we\r\nsucceeded in adopting resolution 57/270 B on the\r\nintegrated follow-up and implementation of the\r\noutcomes of those major conferences, in order to attain\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Resolution 57/270\r\nB means that the General Assembly and the Economic\r\nand Social Council can play a role in monitoring and\r\nfollowing up implementation and in the adoption of\r\nnecessary adjustment measures. To that end, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council should be more active in\r\ncoordinating the activities of the specialized agencies\r\nand in strengthening cooperation with the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions in order to give them the necessary\r\nmomentum.\r\nThe composition of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, in relation to its effectiveness increased,\r\nshould be the subject of an in-depth analysis. We hope\r\nthat this analysis will be carried out as quickly as\r\npossible. Moreover, it is important for the General\r\nAssembly to be in session throughout the year and to\r\nrespond to proposals from anywhere in the world,\r\ndirectly or via the Economic and Social Council, so as\r\nto prepare studies and react promptly to the challenges\r\nof globalization. In the same vein, the role and\r\npresence of the presidency of the General Assembly\r\nmust be strengthened and given adequate resources to\r\nthat end.\r\nThe General Assembly should be able to set up\r\nthematic groups whenever issues arise on which it must\r\ntake a stand. The membership of such groups, if they\r\nare open-ended, could work with full respect for\r\ntransparency. It is in this manner that we worked well\r\nthis year in the open-ended ad hoc working group on\r\nintegrated follow-up and implementation of the major\r\nUnited Nations conferences.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China will support all\r\ninitiatives to ensure the better effectiveness and\r\nvisibility of the work of the General Assembly. We\r\nbelieve the Assembly can make better use of its\r\ndecision-making power involving budgetary matters, a\r\npower which it has under Article 17 of the Charter. We\r\nmust continue budgetary and financial reform along the\r\nlines set forth by resolution 57/300. This means that\r\nthe General Assembly must have the resources\r\nnecessary to make strategic choices and decide on\r\npriorities when it enters into a budgetary exercise. Such\r\nan exercise cannot be only technical, and cannot lie\r\nwithin the sole purview of Fifth Committee experts. In\r\nthis connection, consideration of the future of the\r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination should go\r\nforward so that the Committee’s functions are actually\r\ncarried out.\r\nAs I just said, it would be useful to extend the\r\nwork of the General Assembly to the entire calendar\r\nyear so that we can focus on our various activities in a\r\nway that would make us as visible as possible. Work on\r\nrevitalization and reform, now begun, should certainly\r\ncontinue next year, without awaiting the report of the\r\npanel of eminent personalities to be set up by the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China attaches great\r\nimportance to preparation for the high-level meeting\r\nscheduled for 2005 on the integrated follow-up and\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nas provided for in resolution 57/270 B. We hope that\r\nthe 2005 summit will give impetus to development\r\nquestions before the General Assembly. To that end,\r\nthe summit should be prepared with all the requisite\r\nprofessionalism during the upcoming year. A\r\npreparatory committee will probably need to be set up\r\nto ensure the success of the 2005 summit, which for us,\r\nas a developing country, will provide an important\r\nstimulus.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China intend to give the\r\npresidency all cooperation necessary for the early\r\nattainment of concrete results because we believe that\r\nthis is the best way to initiate the much desired\r\ndynamic of reform.\r\nMr. Balarezo (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): It is a\r\ngreat honour to speak on behalf of the 19 member\r\nStates of the Rio Group: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil,\r\nChile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic,\r\nEcuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras,\r\nMexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Uruguay,\r\nVenezuela and my country, Peru.\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\nThe Rio Group reaffirms its full support and\r\ncooperation in the effort to revitalize the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Also, it welcomes the important\r\ndocument that has been submitted, with which it agrees\r\nin several areas. Like the President of the General\r\nAssembly, we believe that this is an opportune moment\r\nto strengthen the role of the Assembly and that it\r\nshould not be wasted because such opportunities do not\r\ncome along often.\r\nWe hope that the reform initiatives will be both\r\nbold and coherent, bold in not shirking the most\r\ndifficult issues and coherent in ensuring the promotion\r\nof multilateralism in the Organization, in particular by\r\naffirming the General Assembly’s ability to fully carry\r\nout the functions entrusted to it under the Charter.\r\nRecently, at their summit held in Cusco last May,\r\nthe heads of State or Government of the Rio Group\r\ncountries decided to employ the full capacity of their\r\ncountries to encourage the strengthening of the\r\nmultilateral system based on international law and the\r\nCharter. They determined that the General Assembly\r\nplays a fundamental role in that task.\r\nThe Rio Group is determined to make its\r\ncontribution to the Assembly’s regaining its effective\r\npolitical leadership of the Organization’s activities,\r\nwith a real capacity for action and purpose, as all the\r\nMember States of the Organization recognized in the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nIn that context, I wish to present on behalf of the\r\nRio Group some suggestions for the revitalization of\r\nthe General Assembly under the two clusters presented\r\nby the President.\r\nFirst, with respect to strengthening the authority\r\nand role of the General Assembly, the United Nations\r\nCharter conferred a broad range of functions and\r\npowers on the General Assembly to deal with all\r\nquestions related not only to cooperation for\r\ndevelopment but also the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. Therefore, the Rio Group considers\r\nthat the General Assembly, as the most democratic and\r\nrepresentative organ, must have the capacity to react\r\nappropriately and to discuss the issues of the greatest\r\nurgency and importance for the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nTo that end, it is essential to strengthen the role of\r\nthe president of the General Assembly, through the\r\ncoordinated supported and balanced work of the\r\nAssembly’s General Committee. That means that the\r\ncapacity for initiative and action should not be\r\ndelegated to individuals as such but according to an\r\nofficial working structure based on clear rules.\r\nIt is a basic requirement that such a mechanism\r\nfor management receives the necessary financial and\r\ntechnical support from the Secretariat, including the\r\nappointment of permanent officials who would be of\r\ngreat advantage because of their liaison with the\r\nSecretariat and their collective memory of the lessons\r\nlearned from the work of each session.\r\nIn addition, the provisions of resolution 51/241\r\nmust be complied with; the resolution requests the\r\nGeneral Committee of the General Assembly to prepare\r\na document containing conclusions, suggestions and\r\nrecommendations based on its experience in order to\r\nsimplify and rationalize the work of the General\r\nCommittee in the following session.\r\nIn order for the General Assembly to be relevant,\r\nit must be able to prioritize the main issues at a given\r\ntime, giving them their due attention. That does not\r\nmean creating an agenda of first and second class items\r\nbut simply identifying the interests of the international\r\ncommunity at a given moment in order to achieve\r\ntimely and concrete results.\r\nThe Rio Group also supports the proposal that the\r\nDepartment of Public Information create a plan of\r\naction for the better dissemination of the results of the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s work. That will require improving\r\nthe quality and relevance of the recommendations and\r\nconclusions adopted.\r\nIt is necessary to comply with the various General\r\nAssembly resolutions requesting the president of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to prepare an assessment of the\r\ndebate on the meetings devoted to the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization, as\r\nwell as to the report of the Security Council. The\r\nassessment of those debates should also consider\r\nwhether a more thorough examination of those reports\r\nby the Assembly is required, including through\r\ninformal consultations. The president’s assessment\r\nshould also contain proposals on ways to facilitate a\r\nmore in-depth discussion of those items, as indicated in\r\nresolutions 48/264 and 51/241.\r\nWith respect to the second cluster, working\r\nmethods of the General Assembly, the Rio Group\r\nconsiders that the work of simplifying the agenda must\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\ncontinue, starting with the selection of the priority\r\nissues, which could be done by the president of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the General Committee. That\r\ndoes not necessarily mean eliminating items currently\r\non the agenda but deciding which items should be\r\ntreated at a specific time.\r\nThe Rio Group agrees on the need for a more\r\ncoherent and balanced calendar of meetings in order to\r\navoid concentrating most of the work of the Main\r\nCommittees and the plenary of the General Assembly\r\ninto a mere three months.\r\nThe numerous formal and informal meetings,\r\npanels, presentations of reports and parallel\r\nnegotiations prevent the effective and sustained\r\ntreatment of agenda items. The president has reminded\r\nus that in order to strengthen the role of the General\r\nAssembly, all countries must adequately participate in\r\nits meetings. That is almost impossible, given the\r\ncurrent workload. This situation is incomprehensible,\r\ngiven that the length of every General Assembly\r\nsession is one calendar year — the time necessary to\r\ncover all the agenda items in a more coherent, orderly\r\nand thorough fashion.\r\nMoreover, the Rio Group believes that each Main\r\nCommittee must initiate a process of reform to\r\noptimize its work. This should include reviewing their\r\nagendas, the number of their resolutions and the\r\ndistribution of their tasks over the course of the year.\r\nThe consultations and coordination of Committees that\r\ndeal with common items must also be improved to\r\navoid duplication of efforts. And the work of others,\r\nsuch as the Fourth Committee, should be enhanced\r\nwith the addition of new items, including some\r\nconsidered in plenary meeting.\r\nWith regard to the debate already begun in the\r\nFirst Committee, the Rio Group considers that that\r\nCommittee must strengthen its work in the area of\r\ndisarmament and international security through the\r\neffective use of the powers and functions granted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly by the Charter. Furthermore, the Rio\r\nGroup considers that the First Committee must make a\r\ngreater contribution to international cooperation in the\r\npolitical field.\r\nWe must reflect on the existing decision-making\r\nprocess of the General Assembly. The rule that must\r\nguide us is to achieve the greatest common\r\ndenominator and the greatest degree of cooperation\r\nfrom all Member States. The rule of consensus is very\r\nimportant, but it must not become an instrument to\r\nimpede the consideration and the promotion of matters\r\nthat can be vital to a substantial majority of Member\r\nStates.\r\nBut the most important matter is the\r\nimplementation of the resolutions adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We must ensure that the resolutions\r\nadopted by the General Assembly are fully\r\nimplemented. Here, the Secretariat can assist us.\r\nPerhaps, at the beginning of each session, the\r\nSecretariat could submit a thorough report on\r\nresolutions that have not been implemented. It would\r\nalso be worthwhile to have a Secretariat evaluation of\r\nthe reasons why those resolutions have not been\r\nimplemented.\r\nIf it is wrong for States not to implement the\r\nrecommendations of Assembly resolutions, it is even\r\nless plausible for the Secretariat and other multilateral\r\norgans subordinate to the Organization not to carry out\r\nthe provisions of resolutions that apply to them. A\r\nstudy of that kind would also allow us to look into the\r\nimplementability of such resolutions and to adopt\r\nmeasures to deal with that problem. It is also important\r\nto encourage the submission of short and concise draft\r\nresolutions, based mainly on new elements.\r\nWe believe that it is very important to prepare a\r\nsummary identifying, from among the numerous\r\nsuggestions presented, specific substantive proposals\r\nwhich can garner the support of the majority of States;\r\nthis will allow development of this process. The Rio\r\nGroup hopes to continue participating in this important\r\neffort of revitalizing the General Assembly, which the\r\nPresident leads and in which we participate\r\nenthusiastically.\r\nThe Rio Group also attaches great importance to\r\nthe process of strengthening the Organization, initiated\r\nby the Secretary-General. In that regard, the Rio Group\r\nexpresses its satisfaction at the efforts undertaken to\r\nimplement resolution 57/300, particularly with regard\r\nto budgetary reform. In that respect, the Rio Group\r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s proposal to create a\r\nshorter, more strategic medium-term plan that takes\r\ninto consideration emerging trends and new challenges\r\nfacing the Organization, and that does not leave out the\r\npriorities set by Member States.\r\nRegarding the draft budget, the Rio Group\r\nconsiders it worthwhile for it to have a broad vision of\r\nmajor programmatic changes and variations and\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\nrequirements of resources that reflect those changes. It\r\nalso considers it necessary to strengthen the monitoring\r\nand evaluation functions through the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination, in order to determine the\r\nongoing relevancy, efficiency and impact of the work\r\nof the Organization. The Group will work\r\nconstructively during the intergovernmental debate in\r\nthe Fifth Committee.\r\nFinally, our countries will continue to participate\r\nactively in the debates and negotiations in the General\r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and the\r\nCommission on Human Rights, with a view to ensuring\r\nfull implementation of the objective of strengthening\r\nthe Organization.\r\nMr. Limon (Suriname): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the 14 States members of the\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) that are Members\r\nof the United Nations: Antigua and Barbuda, the\r\nBahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada,\r\nGuyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint\r\nLucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and\r\nTobago and my own country, Suriname.\r\nWe thank the President for convening this\r\nmeeting, and even more for his approach to the issue of\r\nrevitalizing the work of the General Assembly. In\r\nplacing this matter before the Assembly at this stage of\r\nthe fifty-eighth session, he has demonstrated not just\r\ncommitment, but also determination to move this issue\r\nto a meaningful level within the Assembly. CARICOM\r\nwelcomes his initiative and leadership and is\r\nunequivocal in its commitment to work towards\r\nmeaningful advancement in this decade-long process.\r\nOur commitment to revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly finds resonance not only in the universal call\r\nfor change among the diplomatic and intellectual\r\ncommunity, and not only in the more than 150\r\nstatements issued by our heads of State or Government\r\nor Foreign Ministers, who, from this very podium,\r\npronounced on the need for reform and revitalization of\r\nour Organization, although that in itself is a clear\r\nmandate.\r\nThe call for reform comes from the people of the\r\nworld, who increasingly sense that we, who are\r\ncharged with the task of representing their needs, have\r\nfailed to make the United Nations a more effective\r\ninstrument for pursuing the fight for development for\r\nall peoples of the world; the fight against poverty,\r\nignorance and disease; the fight against injustice,\r\nviolence, terror and crime; and the fight against the\r\ndegradation and destruction of our common home, in\r\nkeeping with our commitments in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. This is a clear mandate. What prevents us\r\nfrom responding to this call? The time has come for us\r\nto move away from simply making rhetorical calls for\r\nreform and to finally take action.\r\nOur first action must be to reaffirm the position\r\nthat the General Assembly is the principal organ of the\r\nUnited Nations, for it is in the General Assembly that\r\nwe find the universality of this Organization. Only the\r\nGeneral Assembly can speak on behalf of all the\r\npeoples of the world.\r\nCARICOM supports the proposal put forward by\r\nthe President, which groups the revitalization issue into\r\ntwo clusters — one on enhancing the authority and the\r\nrole of the General Assembly and one on improving the\r\nworking methods of the General Assembly.\r\nA number of ideas have been put forward on\r\nimproving the working methods of the General\r\nAssembly. For CARICOM, such improvements should\r\nlead to more substantive debates, more interactive\r\ndiscussions and more implementation. We\r\nacknowledge the concerns of those who worry that\r\nreform of the working methods could be used to\r\nmarginalize issues of less significance to some\r\ninfluential delegations. CARICOM will be vigilant in\r\nensuring that important issues are not marginalized, but\r\nwe also recognize the need for flexibility in finding\r\ncommon ground in fulfilling our mandate.\r\nWe believe that improving our work and ensuring\r\nthat we produce relevant and meaningful outcomes\r\nrepresents a significant contribution to the\r\nenhancement of the authority and the role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Relevant and meaningful outcomes\r\nwill be translated into positive results for those we\r\nserve.\r\nCARICOM believes that an equally important\r\ncomponent of the revitalization process is the\r\nstrengthening of the office of the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The President must have the\r\nresources to carry out the mandates entrusted to him by\r\nthe Charter, as well as those that result from the\r\ndeliberations of this body. He must also be given the\r\nresources necessary for him to take the message of the\r\nAssembly beyond the confines of this Hall. CARICOM\r\nlooks forward to working with him on this most\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\nimportant issue. We hereby express our willingness to\r\naccommodate all constructive proposals.\r\nThis conversation on reform and revitalization\r\nhas continued for over a decade. We have expressed in\r\nevery possible way our understanding of the need for\r\nreform — for change. Our level of activity aimed at\r\nachieving change, however, remains sluggish at best.\r\nAs The Right Honourable P. J. Patterson, Prime\r\nMinister of Jamaica, put it, we must resuscitate the\r\npowers of the General Assembly and assert its role as\r\nthe principal organ of the United Nations. Let us act\r\nnow.\r\nMr. Elnaggar (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): No one\r\nin this Hall is in any doubt about the urgent need for\r\nreform. That need has been evidenced by recent events\r\nand crises in the world and the failure of the\r\ninternational order to carry out its responsibilities in an\r\neffective manner so as to ensure that the foundations of\r\nthis international Organization are safeguarded and that\r\nit be allowed to confront the new challenges that it\r\nfaces.\r\nThere are many reform initiatives relating to,\r\ninter alia, the revitalization of the General Assembly,\r\nthe reform and expansion of the Security Council, the\r\nfunctioning and role of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, reconsideration of the role of the Trusteeship\r\nCouncil and the strengthening of the United Nations at\r\nthe administrative and institutional levels, as well as\r\nthe strengthening of the post of the Secretary-General\r\nand reducing the pressure on him and on his decisions.\r\nIn our view, reform in the various fields must be a\r\ncomprehensive, integral process. Our unity of purpose\r\nmust be manifested in the increase in the effectiveness\r\nand efficiency of this international Organization in all\r\nareas and the wider participation of all Member States\r\nin the decision-making process, as well as an expansion\r\nand fusion of the issues that are on the international\r\nagenda. In this respect, we believe that the process\r\nshould be based on a firm foundation and that\r\nselectivity must be avoided when determining which\r\nareas require reform and in what manner. This in turn\r\nwill require openness and transparency with regard to\r\nthe reality of the current international situation, without\r\nunjustified pessimism or exaggerated and unfounded\r\nambitions being manifested.\r\nIn this context, I would like to make some general\r\npoints, within a framework of transparency, which\r\ncould contribute to the desired goal of reform. First, we\r\nmust all agree that the institutional reform of the\r\nUnited Nations is governed by a number of factors,\r\nsome of which undermine the scope of the reform\r\neffort itself, as well as our ability to carry it out.\r\nReform at all levels is, in principle, a political process\r\naimed at enhancing the authority of the General\r\nAssembly and expanding the participation of Member\r\nStates in elaborating the objectives of the Organization\r\nand all its resolutions, including those relating to\r\ninternational peace and security and support for the\r\nrole of the Organization in the social, economic and\r\npolitical fields throughout the world, which is in our\r\ncommon interests.\r\nWe must therefore understand that an approach to\r\nreform that focuses only on the rationalization of some\r\nprocedures — despite the importance of that — will\r\nnot bring about the objective that we all seek. That is\r\nthe starting point. We would like to make clear that\r\nthere is an enormous difference in positions between\r\nthose who want to carry out a radical reform — which\r\nis required in many important fields — and amend the\r\nCharter, whether by addition or by omission, and those\r\nwho believe that the status quo should be maintained\r\nand that the role of the United Nations should be\r\nlimited to purely humanitarian work. Despite the\r\nimportance of such work, however, it cannot meet the\r\naspirations of peoples or the requirements of the\r\ncurrent international order. For example, the United\r\nNations is still far from undertaking a leading political\r\nrole in specific boiling crises or in the international\r\neconomic order, which is controlled by closed cadres\r\nof the elite.\r\nIn this respect, I believe we must thoroughly\r\nexamine the issue of General Assembly resolutions and\r\nits authority within the framework of the “Uniting for\r\npeace” resolution. That would be very useful in these\r\ndifficult times when people have lost faith in the\r\nOrganization.\r\nIf the role of the Security Council — the principal\r\norgan for maintaining international peace and security,\r\npursuant to the Charter — has been undermined, as can\r\nbe seen from many recent events, and its role limited to\r\nreforming policies that it did not draw up or set, then\r\nthe question would be: is an expansion of the Council’s\r\nmembership sufficient to increase and enhance its\r\neffectiveness and efficiency? If the answer is in the\r\naffirmative, what would then be the scope of the\r\nexpansion, and would it reflect the reality of the\r\ninternational political arena in an inclusive manner —\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\nor would it be carried out with selectivity so as to\r\nreflect only part of that reality?\r\nSecondly, there are many reform initiatives before\r\nus, some of which overlap in certain areas, and they\r\nneed to be rationalized. Discussions on the same issue\r\nare currently taking place on parallel tracks. There are\r\nalso other approaches that are trying to bring together\r\nseparate and isolated areas of reform. In this context, I\r\nwould like to note the discussions that are taking place\r\nin the General Assembly itself concerning the\r\nrevitalization and enhancement of its role. Egypt also\r\nsupports the initiative of the Secretary-General, spelled\r\nout in his statement on 23 September, to set up a high-\r\nlevel panel of eminent personalities to discuss the same\r\nissue and other matters. In this connection, a report will\r\nbe submitted to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession. Thus the General Assembly will consider the\r\nresults reached by the panel, which will examine that\r\nissue and the possibility of reaching consensus on some\r\nof the proposals in that connection.\r\nI should like to note that discussions on the\r\nrevitalization of the role and rationalization of the work\r\nof the General Assembly and its Main Committees are\r\ntaking place in parallel in several committees, each\r\nconsidering the same issue and without any unified\r\nguiding vision. I would therefore propose that the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly undertake a lead\r\nrole in the preparation of a clear programme of action,\r\nwith a specific time frame lasting through this and the\r\nnext session and ending with the sixtieth, to cover all\r\nsuch debates. In that manner, we can use the available\r\ntime with greater efficiency, avoid duplication and\r\nestablish clear benchmarks during each session,\r\nincluding specific and practical objectives.\r\nWe also note the importance of establishing an\r\nappropriate mechanism to coordinate the work of the\r\nPanel Of Eminent Persons on United Nations Relations\r\nwith Civil Society and of the General Assembly in the\r\nsame area. My delegation has already proposed that the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly assume that vital\r\ncoordinating role at this session.\r\nFinally, with respect to promoting the role of the\r\nUnited Nations and following up the implementation of\r\nresolution 57/300, I should like to note the ambiguity\r\nthat surrounds both the proposals submitted to develop\r\nthe process of adopting the United Nations programme\r\nbudget and the role of multilateral governmental\r\nframeworks in the various phases of that process. I\r\nwish to stress here the importance that Egypt, like\r\nmany other developing countries, attaches to the mid-\r\nterm planning of our Organization. We believe that,\r\nwithout such mid-term planning, it will be difficult to\r\nidentify our priorities and to assess progress made in\r\nthem. I wish once again to reiterate the importance of\r\nconsidering this matter in a comprehensive manner\r\nencompassing its various phases in order to be able to\r\ndetermine its shortcomings and to suggest remedies\r\nthereto.\r\nMr. Spatafora (Italy): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the European Union. The acceding\r\ncountries Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia\r\nand Slovenia; the associated Countries, Romania and\r\nTurkey; and the European Free Trade Association\r\ncountry member of the European Economic Area,\r\nIceland, align themselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the decision to\r\nhold today’s joint debate, as it brings together different\r\nstrands of work on United Nations reform. Through the\r\ninitiatives launched by the Secretary-General and\r\nothers, as well as thanks to the personal engagement of\r\nthe President of the General Assembly, there is an\r\nencouraging sense of momentum to take forward our\r\ncommon interest in strengthening the United Nations.\r\nThe initial reactions of Member States have been very\r\npositive and they provide an indication of their\r\ncommitment to moving the process forward. We have\r\nbefore us a common path and the European Union\r\nwants to walk it together with others.\r\nThe European Union supports the process set in\r\nmotion by the Secretary-General. We want a strong and\r\nefficient United Nations system. We believe that\r\nmultilateral institutions should be updated and\r\nstrengthened. We are ready to contribute actively to the\r\ngoal of building an international order based on\r\neffective multilateral institutions, within the\r\nfundamental framework of the United Nations Charter\r\nand our joint vision for the United Nations, as\r\narticulated by our heads of State in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. The European Union gives its support to\r\nthe establishment of a high-level Panel of Eminent\r\nPersonalities and we look forward to receiving\r\nrecommendations from the Secretary-General in 2004,\r\nbased on the work of the Panel.\r\nThe European Union further believes that reform\r\nshould extend to the main United Nations policies in\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\norder to make them more effective in the face of new\r\nand evolving global challenges. In this regard, the\r\nEuropean Union and its member States continue to\r\nwork to strengthen the coherence and consistency of\r\ntheir collective actions in principal United Nations\r\norgans with a view to ensuring greater respect for\r\nmultilateral decisions and greater determination in their\r\nimplementation. While recent improvements in the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council should be\r\nfurther developed, there is a need for a comprehensive\r\nreform that makes it more representative, more\r\neffective and more democratic.\r\nWith respect to General Assembly revitalization,\r\nthe European Union would like to express its\r\nappreciation for Mr. Hunte’s leadership and\r\ncommitment in steering the revitalization process. We\r\nwelcome his recent non-paper as an excellent basis for\r\nmaking real progress during this sessions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We share his views, both on\r\nsubstance and on process, and are heartened by the\r\npositive response they received during the first\r\ninformal consultations last week. The proposals now\r\nneed further elaboration with a view to taking decisions\r\nas soon as possible. We should be ambitious and at the\r\nsame time focus on issues where progress can be made.\r\nWe agree with the President’s proposal to hold\r\ninformal consultations grouping the issues under two\r\nheadings: first, enhancing the authority and role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, including to restore its central role\r\nin international debate and decision-making; and\r\nsecondly, improving the working methods. In this\r\nframework, we are ready to work with the President in\r\nachieving concrete decisions to be adopted at this\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nEnhancing the authority and role of the General\r\nAssembly is first and foremost a matter of political\r\nwill. It is our shared responsibility to create the\r\nconditions in which the Assembly can fulfil its role as\r\ndefined in the Charter. The General Assembly requires\r\nimprovements in its working methods, but improving\r\nthose working methods is not an end in itself. It will\r\nunderpin our efforts to enhance the General\r\nAssembly’s authority and role, as I was saying before.\r\nWe would like to highlight the following priorities.\r\nFirst, we must strengthen the role of the President\r\nand his Office. We would, for instance, welcome\r\ntemporary secondment of additional Secretariat staff to\r\nthe President’s Office. We also would suggest\r\nexploring the possibility of extending a President’s\r\nterm or of introducing the troika system in order to\r\ndraw upon experience and provide continuity.\r\nSecond, we must enhance the role of the General\r\nCommittee. We welcome the initial steps that the\r\nPresident has taken. We could envisage a bureau\r\nfunction for the Committee in support of the President.\r\nOne of the specific additional roles of the General\r\nCommittee could be to come up with recommendations\r\nto streamline the reporting requirements.\r\nThird, we must work in the Main Committees to\r\nstrengthen their functioning and encourage each\r\nCommittee to find efficient ways of organising their\r\nwork. Of course, these proposals should be consistent\r\nwith the wider context of revitalisation of the\r\nAssembly as a whole.\r\nFourth, we must develop constructive interaction\r\nwith and between the bureaux of the main Committees,\r\nfor example by joint bureaux meetings to identify\r\npotential areas of overlap and to review their respective\r\nprogrammes of work. We could also consider election\r\nof the bureaux earlier in the year, as is now the case for\r\nthe President of the Assembly, to facilitate continuity\r\nand planning.\r\nFifth, we must communicate more effectively the\r\ndecisions of the Assembly to Governments and\r\nagencies and disseminate information thereon to the\r\nbroader public.\r\nSixth, we must look again at how to do better in\r\nimplementing past General Assembly resolutions on\r\nefficient working.\r\nSeventh, we must establish a closer link between\r\nthe Assembly’s agenda and the global challenges of the\r\noutside world. Debates in the plenary and in the main\r\nCommittees should focus on a limited number of key\r\nissues of common interest. The Millennium\r\nDeclaration and the Millennium Development Goals\r\nshould provide the overarching framework in that\r\nregard. Prominent outsiders could be invited to give\r\ntheir views on these issues. The general debate could\r\nset the stage by focusing on key themes agreed on by\r\nMember States beforehand — ideally building upon\r\npriorities indicated by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport on the work of the Organization.\r\nThe European Union also believes that some\r\nitems do not require annual debate. Considering them\r\nevery two or three years would make room for more in-\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\ndepth debates as well as for topical new items. We\r\nsuggest that, under the guidance of the President,\r\nspecific ideas to that effect could be elaborated.\r\nDebates should become more interactive, for instance\r\nby using alternative formats such as high-level\r\ndialogues and panels more often.\r\nThe General Assembly should become more\r\naction-oriented. Resolutions and decisions should be\r\nshorter and less repetitive and focus on implementation\r\nwithin a given time-frame. Furthermore, their\r\nimplementation by Member States, the Secretariat and\r\nother parts of the United Nations system should be\r\nmonitored more vigorously. The European Union\r\nseconds the suggestion that Member States proposing a\r\ndraft resolution become the “focal points” for its\r\nfollow-up. My Algerian colleague, on behalf of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, has touched on this point, as\r\nhave others, with whom we fully agree.\r\nIn the same spirit, we support efforts to\r\nstrengthen the Economic and Social Council so that it\r\ncan perform its role as the central mechanism for\r\nsystem-wide coordination. A great deal has been done\r\nalready, for example to improve its methods of work.\r\nPriority should be given to implementing General\r\nAssembly resolution 57/270 B, in particular in the\r\nfollowing areas: first, to elaborate a programme of\r\nwork based on cross-cutting themes for the follow-up\r\nto major United Nations conferences and summits, in\r\nthe light of the achievement of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals; secondly, to review the methods\r\nof work of the functional commissions methods of\r\nwork before 2005, in order better to pursue the\r\nimplementation of the outcomes of the major United\r\nNations conferences and Summits, while recognizing\r\nthat there is no need for a uniform approach for all\r\nfunctional commissions; thirdly, to enhance the\r\ninteraction with its subsidiary bodies; fourthly, to\r\nreview the role of the annual spring meeting and its\r\narticulation with the biannual high-level dialogue, in\r\nrelation to the Bretton Woods institutions and the\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO).\r\nThe EU welcomes the initiative of the President\r\nof the Economic and Social Council to stimulate\r\nthinking on the functioning of the Council. An\r\nessential leadership role must be played by the\r\nPresident and the Bureau in taking forward these ideas.\r\nWe hope that this debate will address wider\r\nissues, such as, first, the articulation of the Economic\r\nand Social Council’s work with that of the General\r\nAssembly and its main committees in the economic and\r\nsocial sphere; and secondly, the Council’s interaction\r\nwith the Security Council, for example on post-conflict\r\nissues.\r\nTurning to the implementation of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals on the strengthening of the United\r\nNations, the EU fully supports the General Assembly’s\r\nresolution 57/300. We welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s analysis on a single-stage approach to\r\nbudgetary and programming decisions, to streamline\r\nbudgetary documentation and to reduce the complexity\r\nof budget procedures.\r\nWe have made clear that the European Union\r\nbelieves that the basic structure of the General\r\nAssembly’s decision-making process is valid. The\r\ndecision-making process must continue to be\r\ntransparent and representative of the full membership,\r\nallowing for full consideration of budgetary and\r\nprogrammatic issues. Within that framework, we\r\nshould be ready for a frank appraisal of how well the\r\nexisting structures operate, in order to guarantee the\r\nefficient functioning of the Committee for Programme\r\nand Coordination (CPC), the Advisory Committee on\r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ)\r\nand the Fifth Committee. The monitoring and\r\nevaluation role of the CPC could be enhanced in\r\nparallel with a more effective contribution on\r\nprogrammatic issues.\r\nThere are serious questions as to the usefulness of\r\nthe medium-term plan and the budget outline. There\r\nare any number of ways to proceed to agreed outcomes\r\nthis autumn, whether conjoining the medium-term plan\r\nwith the programme budget, as some have suggested,\r\nor harmonizing the plan more effectively with a\r\nrejuvenated budget outline as part of a dual-component\r\nstrategic framework. Both would better align\r\nprogramming and priority-setting with resource\r\nimplications, which should be one of the primary\r\nobjectives of this reform process.\r\nHow to move the process forward?\r\nStrengthening, enhancing and reforming the United\r\nNations, as the only universal Organization, is\r\nnecessary and urgent. We believe that, to ensure\r\ncontinuity of this process, there should be regular\r\noverall reviews on the progress being made in shaping\r\nthe reform.\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.43\r\nThe European Union is ready to work for more\r\nconcrete improvements in the efficiency of United\r\nNations bodies, policies and processes. We are willing\r\nto cooperate with the broader United Nations\r\nmembership, reaching out to other groups and Member\r\nStates with the aim of delivering tangible results as of\r\nthe current session of the General Assembly.\r\nLet us not put off until tomorrow what we can do\r\ntoday. The present momentum will not last forever. The\r\nyear 2005 will be the natural point for us to review\r\nmany United Nations processes. We support a\r\ncomprehensive review in 2005 of major United Nations\r\nconferences, within the overarching framework of the\r\nMillennium Declaration and the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.20 p.m.\r\n"
