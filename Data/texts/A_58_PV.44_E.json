(Saint Lucia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Lamba\r\n(Malawi), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda items 55 and 57 to 59 (continued)\r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly\r\nUnited Nations reform: measures and proposals\r\nRestructuring and revitalization of the United\r\nNations in the economic, social and related fields\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations system\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/57/786,\r\nA/58/175, A/58/351, A/58/382, A/58/395 and\r\nA/58/395/Corr.1)\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): In his address at the\r\nbeginning of this session of the General Assembly, the\r\nSecretary-General underscored the importance of\r\ncollective action in addressing global challenges. He\r\nalso emphasized the need for the effective functioning\r\nof major organs of the United Nations and the\r\nrelationship between them. We fully agree with the\r\nSecretary-General on that. The participation of the\r\nDeputy Secretary-General in this debate reflects the\r\nimportance that the Office of the Secretary-General\r\nattaches to the work of the General Assembly and to\r\nthis debate.\r\nAs a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and\r\nof the Group of 77 and China, and indeed in our\r\nnational capacity, we attach great importance to the\r\nissues under discussion. In that connection, we\r\nwelcome the President’s readiness to take the lead in\r\nimplementing the various resolutions concerning\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. Beginning with\r\nthe forty-sixth session, we have made considerable\r\nprogress, but the changes on the international scene\r\ndictate that we should continue to revitalize the\r\nGeneral Assembly and to strengthen the system as a\r\nwhole.\r\nIn the President’s informal note on the\r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly, he\r\nproposed that consideration of such revitalization be\r\nclustered under “Enhancing the authority and role of\r\nthe General Assembly” and “Improving the working\r\nmethods of the General Assembly”. Much has been\r\naccomplished in the latter category. Therefore, for the\r\npurpose of today’s debate, I shall confine my brief\r\nremarks to a number of aspects of enhancing the\r\nauthority and role of the General Assembly. I shall do\r\nso because the current international situation demands\r\nan authoritative General Assembly that commands\r\nrespect and legitimacy worldwide.\r\nThe President has made available to the\r\nAssembly a compilation that indicates the road we have\r\ntravelled and how far we still have to go in\r\nimplementing the decisions we have taken here.\r\nPerhaps we must pause and ask ourselves why\r\nresolutions of the General Assembly are not\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nimplemented by its own members, whereas those of the\r\nSecurity Council are, with the exception of a few cases,\r\nin which some members tend to ignore them. That then\r\nprompts us to ask whether we can earnestly enhance\r\nthe work of the General Assembly without looking\r\nseriously once again at the United Nations Charter.\r\nFor example, while the Security Council has the\r\nprimary responsibility of maintaining international\r\npeace and security, the General Assembly can also play\r\nan effective role. As we have it now, conflict situations\r\nare confined to the Security Council. Important issues\r\nare brought to the General Assembly when the Council\r\nfails to act. We propose that major international\r\nconflict situations be considered first in plenary\r\nmeeting, after which the Security Council should meet,\r\nhaving benefited from the views of the general\r\nmembership. That, in our view, would not contradict\r\nArticle 10 of the Charter.\r\nThe general debate is highly valued by Member\r\nStates. Hence, participation at the highest level has\r\nbeen on the increase; it gives Member States an\r\nopportunity to pronounce on many issues of national or\r\ninternational importance. The focusing of each meeting\r\nof the general debate might develop into small high-\r\nlevel meetings or special sessions. That needs to be\r\ngiven some serious thought before it is put into\r\npractice.\r\nThe voluntary 15-minute limit on statements has,\r\nno doubt, shortened the general debate. However,\r\ndisplaying the lights is perhaps less courteous to the\r\nspeaker. Our suggestion is that the lights be displayed\r\nonly to the speaker.\r\nMy delegation has always wondered what\r\ndetermines the tenure of various United Nations\r\nbodies. For example, members are elected to the\r\nEconomic and Social Council for three years, and non-\r\npermanent Security Council members serve for two\r\nyears on the Council, while the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is elected for 12 months. Having\r\nserved on the Security Council, I can say from\r\nexperience that, for non-permanent members, the first\r\nsix months are for learning the ropes. Thus it is during\r\nthe second half of the year that one begins to\r\ncomprehend fully the workings of the Council and thus\r\nto make a meaningful contribution.\r\nThe point I am making is that there is a gap\r\nbetween the assumption of office and making an\r\nimpact as far as the tenure of the office of the President\r\nof the General Assembly is concerned. For example,\r\nresolutions adopted under the current presidency will\r\nreach Member States around February. That leaves an\r\nimplementation period of about six months for Member\r\nStates, after which the Secretary-General will request\r\ninformation on implementation from Member States in\r\norder to compile his reports to the General Assembly.\r\nAnd so the cycle continues. The biennialization of\r\nitems will assist in ensuring that effective action will\r\nbe taken. However, that must be done with the\r\nunderstanding of the countries concerned.\r\nEvery year, during the general debate, the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly is congratulated on\r\nhaving assumed his or her high office. But what are the\r\nworking conditions of that office? As a country that has\r\nhad the rare honour of presiding over the General\r\nAssembly, our experience shows that we, the Member\r\nStates, must adequately equip the President’s office if it\r\nis to meet the demands placed upon it. Resources from\r\nthe regular budget must be made available to the office,\r\nand the onus must not be left on the country assuming\r\nthe presidency. The institutional memory must be\r\nextended to the substantive issues, discussions and\r\nrecommendations of General Assembly sessions.\r\nMost of the former presidents of the General\r\nAssembly have served for many years at the United\r\nNations. Others, upon their return home, have assumed\r\nhigher posts in their countries. Individually and\r\ncollectively, with their international status, they bring\r\nto the table vast knowledge and experience on issues in\r\nthe international arena. They certainly can play an\r\nimportant role as facilitators. In our view, the former\r\npresidents of the General Assembly should be engaged\r\nin leading working groups of the Assembly and should\r\nserve on panels or committees to look into specific\r\nsubjects upon which the General Assembly might\r\ndecide. That would not only elevate the office but also\r\ncontribute to raising awareness of the work and the\r\nauthority of the General Assembly.\r\nIn closing, let me say a word about the Fourth\r\nCommittee. It is through the Fourth Committee that\r\nmany of our countries were decolonized, and, as a\r\nresult, we are Members of this great Organization. The\r\nCommittee needs to be strengthened by reviewing,\r\ninter alia, progress being made with regard to the Non-\r\nSelf-Governing Territories.\r\nMr. Al-Awadi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): My\r\ndelegation would like to align itself fully with the\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nstatement delivered by the Permanent Representative of\r\nAlgeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\n(NAM). Mr. President, my delegation would like to\r\nextend its thanks for the distinguished efforts you have\r\nmade and for your insistence on and interest in the\r\nissue of enhancing the General Assembly and\r\nrationalizing and reforming its work. The unofficial\r\nNAM paper, which you have presented and which was\r\ndiscussed in informal consultations on 17 October\r\n2003, is a clear proof of your intention to bring about a\r\npositive conclusion to the issue of rationalizing and\r\nreforming the work of the General Assembly and\r\nenhancing its role, thus complementing what your\r\npredecessors have done in previous sessions. Kuwait\r\nbelieves that the NAM paper presented by you,\r\nMr. President, last week contained many practical\r\nproposals for improving the working methods of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We can, therefore, refer to it and be\r\nguided by it through the next phase in order to reach\r\nconsensus on the largest possible number of proposals\r\ncontained in it.\r\nKuwait, through its Permanent Mission here, has\r\ngiven special importance to the issue of rationalization\r\nand reform of the work of the General Assembly\r\nbecause the results would be a reflection, in the end, of\r\nour performance at this important organ of the United\r\nNations. We believe that it is important to present our\r\nremarks on this issue, which concern the general\r\nprinciples that should guide us during the reform\r\nprocess. We will thus present proposals on procedures\r\nthat we believe will bring about the desired objectives\r\nof this process.\r\nIt is essential that we use the present positive\r\nmomentum to achieve some noticeable progress in the\r\nrationalization process of the work of the General\r\nAssembly, in accordance with general principles that\r\nwill be a guide for Member States, for subsequent\r\nPresidents of the General Assembly and for the\r\nSecretariat in the implementation of any steps in this\r\narea.\r\nMy delegation has noted that the reform process\r\ncomes up every year associated with specific ideas,\r\nenthusiasm or keenness, but without setting up guiding\r\nprinciples that should be applied at the beginning of\r\nevery session. We should not repeat ourselves\r\nconcerning this issue at every session. Our objective in\r\nsetting up such principles is to protect the political\r\ninterests of any party interested in this process.\r\nThe general principles and proposals concerning\r\nwork procedures according to which we should work in\r\nthe next meeting are as follow:\r\nFirst, we must agree on the principle of continuity\r\nin the reform and rationalization of procedures, so that\r\nthe reform process is not limited to a specific session\r\nor a specific presidency but will continue, whether the\r\nresults are positive or negative, even if we have not\r\nreached agreement on a specific area of rationalization\r\nand reform.\r\nSecondly, agreement on the process of\r\nrationalization and reform of the working methods of\r\nthe General Assembly is not only related to technical\r\nmatters. It is also related to sensitive political matters\r\nand, accordingly, political dimensions should be taken\r\ninto account. We repeat what we said in our statement\r\nat the last session on the need to take into account the\r\npolitical nature of the work of the United Nations,\r\nwhich means that we will not follow the procedures\r\nused in private sector institutions.\r\nThirdly, the reform process should be fully\r\ntransparent and all States should have the right to know\r\nabout all proposals. These proposals should be\r\npresented in a fair and equal manner, taking into\r\naccount the ideas of small States and small delegations,\r\nwhich have difficulty following the sessions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and its many committees because of\r\ntheir frequency and the fact that they are held at the\r\nsame time as other meetings.\r\nWe call upon the President of the General\r\nAssembly, his successors and the Secretariat to follow\r\nclosely the ideas of Member States and to help us\r\ncrystallize all the ideas agreed upon in the area of\r\nreform of the General Assembly, particularly proposals\r\nconcerning working methods and procedures. These\r\nproposals should be submitted and adopted without\r\ndelay, so that they will not be superseded by other\r\nproposals and procedures that are not yet agreed upon.\r\nMy delegation believes that one of the most\r\nimportant procedural changes that the General\r\nAssembly has started to implement is the clustering of\r\nsimilar items for debate. We call for the continuation of\r\nthis clustering approach, particularly when discussing\r\nitems in the General Assembly.\r\nConcerning rationalization of the agenda items of\r\nthe General Assembly by biennializing or triennializing\r\ncertain ones or cancelling them, this method is a bit\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nsensitive but can be implemented if we take into\r\naccount the political aspects of those issues. In this\r\ncontext, the most important thing is consultation in two\r\nphases. First, the secretariat of the General Assembly\r\nwould, each year before starting the regular session of\r\nthe General Assembly, consult with States or with\r\nspecific States concerning a specific item that could be\r\npostponed to a coming session or a procedure that\r\ncould be adopted that would rationalize the method.\r\nThe secretariat, after completing the consultation\r\nprocess, would then submit a paper through the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly that would indicate\r\nthe items on which agreement had been reached with\r\nthe parties concerned, to rationalize those items. We\r\nemphasize here two principles: the method of\r\nconsultation and the agreement of the States parties to\r\na particular item.\r\nMy delegation supports the proposal by the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly to concentrate\r\ngeneral discussion at the beginning of the session on a\r\nspecific issue or theme; this approach has been\r\nsuccessfully used by the Non-Aligned Movement in its\r\nrecent conferences and summits. My delegation has\r\nstudied the proposal made by the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly concerning scheduling the\r\ndiscussion of the items of the General Assembly and\r\nagrees that it is an important proposal and will alleviate\r\nthe burden of many countries with small delegations if\r\nit is done in an accurate and solid manner. We call for\r\nscheduling the meetings of the Main Committees of the\r\nGeneral Assembly throughout the year so that the\r\nmeeting of a particular Committee could be held in one\r\nmonth every year or during a specific period, in\r\naccordance with the traditional method followed at the\r\ninauguration of every session, holding the general\r\ndebate in the month of September.\r\nMy delegation supports the proposal of\r\nstrengthening the capabilities and potentials of the\r\nOffice of the President of the General Assembly. We\r\nalso support what was contained in the statement of the\r\nNAM representative in this connection. We could also\r\nestablish a specific unit in the Secretariat whose staff\r\nwould help the President of the General Assembly\r\nduring each session.\r\nIn conclusion, Mr. President, my delegation\r\nwould like to emphasize that the general framework\r\nproposed in your paper must concentrate on procedures\r\nand on improving working methods, because this is the\r\nonly way to attain the principal objective of this\r\nprocess, which is to enhance the role of the General\r\nAssembly and to revitalize its role in accordance with\r\nthe Charter. My delegation will cooperate fully with\r\nyou to safeguard the success of your efforts. I would\r\nlike to express my thanks to Ambassador Abdallah\r\nBaali, the representative of Algeria, for his efforts to\r\ncoordinate the positions of the NAM States.\r\nMr. Motomura (Japan): The changes that we see\r\ntoday in the international community are frequent and\r\nincreasingly more dynamic. Every day we face new\r\nand diverse challenges. As the advancement of\r\nglobalization has led us to an increasingly more\r\ninterdependent world, we cannot fail to recognise the\r\neffectiveness of a viable multilateral framework in\r\ntaking on these challenges. The United Nations, we\r\nbelieve, is the best tool available to the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe relevance of this tool, however, depends\r\nentirely on its ability to effectively deliver its message\r\nto the real world. That is especially true with regard to\r\nthe ability of the General Assembly to make its\r\nopinions heard, as it is the most representative body\r\nwithin the United Nations in that it comprises all the\r\nMember States. The General Assembly should also\r\nplay a key role when the international community takes\r\ndecisions following legitimate avenues for action. It is\r\nagainst that background that I wish to stress how\r\nimportant it is for us to seriously seek ways and means\r\nto let the General Assembly recover the status that the\r\nCharter grants it and the role that the Millennium\r\nDeclaration clearly assigns to it.\r\nIn addition, the United Nations must enhance its\r\nability to respond to shifting priorities. The Member\r\nStates must constantly reassess whether we are meeting\r\nwith success in devoting our time, energy and\r\nresources to our highest priorities so as to produce\r\nmaximum yield within the given limitations.\r\nFirst, let me touch upon some of the matters\r\nrelated to the revitalization of the General Assembly\r\nthat we consider to be of particular importance. This\r\nmatter actually has been on our agenda since 1990 and\r\nwe have engaged in numerous discussions from a\r\nvariety of perspectives. I believe that it is high time for\r\nus to take stock of the results of those discussions and\r\nto come up with a more comprehensive approach to\r\nthis matter. In this regard, I would like to pay tribute to\r\nthe initiatives that the President of the General\r\nAssembly is undertaking.\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nToday, we are here to discuss four agenda items\r\nin this joint debate. This is quite a symbolic step\r\nforward in our effort to enhance the efficiency of our\r\nwork by clustering related items. I also would like to\r\ncommend the efforts made by the President in that\r\ndirection.\r\nAs concerns measures to enhance the authority\r\nand role of the General Assembly, we are in favour of\r\nstrengthening the Office of the President. In order to\r\nensure a smooth transfer and to accumulate\r\ninstitutional memory, the Secretariat should assign one\r\nor two persons from among its current staff members to\r\nthe Office. In our view, it is preferable that an expert\r\nwith solid knowledge of the substance and precedence\r\nof the work of the General Assembly be assigned.\r\nThis year, we elected the President in June, which\r\nis a remarkable step forward, but three months is still\r\nquite short a period in which to fully prepare oneself\r\nfor that important job and one year is still a very short\r\ntime frame for the completion of a great deal of\r\nsubstantive work. We therefore propose that we\r\nconsider the possibility of re-electing the President, as\r\nwell as the possibility of electing the President from\r\namong the Vice-Presidents of the previous year. We are\r\nalso of the view that the President should further\r\nenhance coordination with representatives of other\r\nrelevant bodies, such as the Main Committees, the\r\nSecurity Council, the Economic and Social Council,\r\nthe Secretary-General’s Office and the regional groups.\r\nThe General Assembly should also explore ways\r\nto enhance cooperation with the Security Council\r\nthrough the promotion of dialogue with it. In order to\r\nrealize that, however, it is necessary for us to make our\r\ndiscussions in the General Assembly more interactive\r\nand more focused. We must therefore direct our\r\nattention to consideration of measures to improve the\r\nworking methods of the General Assembly.\r\nThe need to further rationalize the agendas of\r\nboth the plenary and the Main Committees has been\r\nrepeatedly stressed in our discussion. It might be worth\r\ngiving serious consideration to the introduction of a\r\nrule that would enable us to streamline and consolidate\r\nagenda items as well as resolutions. For instance, those\r\nagenda items concerning which discussion is deferred\r\nfor a number of years should be deleted from the list.\r\nWe should also take a hard look at the way in which\r\nagenda items are allocated to each Main Committee,\r\nfor there must be significant room for rationalization in\r\nthis area.\r\nIn the context of agenda reform, I have been\r\npaying particular attention to the work of the Second\r\nCommittee, which, on the basis of resolution 57/270 B,\r\nis to reach a conclusion on this topic by the end of the\r\nfifty-eighth session. I have already underscored the\r\nstagnant nature of the work of the Second Committee\r\nin the statement I delivered before the Committee on\r\n6 October.\r\nThe role of the Second Committee is becoming\r\nmore and more important. In the economic, social and\r\nrelated fields, the discussions are often left stranded\r\namid ideological confrontations among groups, without\r\nallowing participants even to reach a common\r\nunderstanding of the priorities of their work. In order\r\nto produce concrete and positive results, all the\r\ncountries that take part in those forums must increase\r\ntheir efforts to reconcile their positions and work\r\ntogether.\r\nResolution 57/301 provides that the regular\r\nsession will commence in the third week of September,\r\nwhich results in a considerable time squeeze for\r\ndiscussions in the Main Committees. The Third\r\nCommittee, for example, has to deal with as many as\r\n80 draft resolutions in seven weeks, which is one week\r\nless than is allotted in a normal year. I call for the\r\nMember States to review this situation and to be\r\nflexible enough to return to the previous practice.\r\nAnother matter for consideration is the possibility of\r\ndispersing sessions of the Main Committees, which are\r\ncurrently concentrated in the period from October to\r\nDecember, throughout the year, as was proposed by the\r\nPermanent Representative of Singapore, which action\r\nwe support.\r\nNow I would like to turn to the issues related to\r\nthe reform and strengthening of the United Nations. We\r\nare glad to note that, since the General Assembly\r\nadopted resolution 57/300, those actions stipulated in it\r\nare being steadily implemented, as is indicated in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report in document A/58/351.\r\nIn the draft programme budget for the biennium\r\n2004-2005, the Secretary-General pays particular\r\nattention to resource reallocation and proposes to\r\nterminate 912 outputs. While commending his efforts,\r\nwe call for a smaller and more rationalized budget\r\nthrough more strict prioritization of activities and\r\nfurther redeployment of resources away from more\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nobsolete activities in order to produce maximum output\r\nwithin our limited financial resources.\r\nWe also appreciate the concrete initiatives taken\r\nsince last year with respect to the restructuring of the\r\nDepartment of Public Information and measures\r\nimplemented for the enhanced effectiveness of the\r\nDepartment’s information products and activities,\r\nincluding the promotion of strategic communications\r\nservices. I would like to encourage the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to continue these reforms in accordance with\r\nthe relevant resolutions and decisions already adopted\r\nconcerning public information.\r\nIn one respect, reform is the accumulation of\r\nconcrete, operational measures. Sometimes it involves\r\nour everyday behaviours. We, the delegation members,\r\nare by no means free from blame; above all, we must\r\nnot waste our precious resources. For instance, if we\r\nstart a meeting later than the scheduled time, the\r\ninterpreters can only stand by idle during that time, and\r\nstill we are paying them a considerable amount of\r\nmoney. As one hour of meeting time with interpretation\r\nin six languages and support services costs $1,875, 20\r\nminutes of delay wastes $625. Supposing we had 10\r\nmeetings in the morning and another 10 in the\r\nafternoon, all delayed for an average of 20 minutes, we\r\nwould lose $12,500 a day. If we have 22 working days\r\nin a month, the loss amounts to $275,000. We could\r\neasily end up wasting $1 million if we went on like that\r\nfor four months. Hypothetical though this may be, it\r\nclearly indicates the critical importance and urgent\r\nneed of being punctual ourselves if we wish to\r\ndemonstrate financial accountability for the further\r\npromotion of reform.\r\nIn another respect, the reform process should take\r\ninto account more long-term, strategic perspectives.\r\nThis question relates to how we construct and maintain\r\ndurable multilateral frameworks with which we can\r\ntackle the real problems of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nFirst, on the matter of Security Council reform,\r\nwe regret that the discussions in the Working Group\r\nestablished by the General Assembly 10 years ago have\r\nyet to produce any significant progress or a way out of\r\nthe deadlock.\r\nThe Secretary-General has proposed that we set\r\n2005 as a deadline for reaching agreement on the\r\nchanges that are needed in our international\r\ninstitutions. Japan takes this proposal very seriously\r\nand holds the view that a political decision should be\r\nmade at that time through the convening of a meeting\r\nof heads of States or Government regarding the reform\r\nof the United Nations, and of the Security Council in\r\nparticular, as proposed by our Foreign Minister during\r\nthe general debate.\r\nJapan also supports the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to establish a high-level panel of eminent\r\npersonalities. We will be following those developments\r\nwith great interest. Japan intends to make the\r\nmaximum contribution possible to that initiative.\r\nIn order for the legitimacy and effectiveness of\r\nthe Security Council to be enhanced, new permanent\r\nmembers need to be added that are both willing and\r\nable to shoulder global responsibility. Japan has\r\nrepeatedly expressed its intention to continue to work\r\nactively for the realization of Security Council reform\r\nand would like to assume greater responsibility as a\r\npermanent member in a reformed Council.\r\nWhen we talk about true United Nations reform,\r\nit is our strong conviction that such reform must lead to\r\na system of world governance that can provide each\r\nand every Member with a sense of legitimacy and\r\nfairness. Unless a sense of fairness is widely shared\r\namong Member States, we cannot hope for the smooth\r\nmanagement of the United Nations. Japan believes that\r\nachieving appropriate and equitable burden-sharing\r\namong Member States must be the focus of our\r\nattention.\r\nIn this regard, we believe that the scale of\r\nassessments should, at an appropriate time, be better\r\nbalanced and made more equitable, in conformity with\r\neach country’s actual economic performance, as well as\r\nwith its status and level of responsibility in the United\r\nNations. In addition, the attainment of equitable\r\ngeographical distribution among Member States with\r\nregard to the number of staff in the Secretariat is long\r\noverdue. Severe underrepresentation must be redressed\r\nas a matter of priority.\r\nWhile the deployment of peacekeeping operations\r\nshould be carried out according to the circumstances\r\nspecific to each case, we also believe that the\r\nbudgetary burden for such operations should be kept at\r\na reasonable level for Member States. Special care\r\nmust also be taken to ensure transparency —\r\nparticularly vis-à-vis major financial contributors —\r\nwhen making decisions to establish and redesign\r\npeacekeeping operations. Some form of dialogue\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nmechanism with those contributors should be\r\ndeveloped.\r\nFinally, the famous four criteria introduced by\r\nAmbassador Mahbubani of Singapore are applicable\r\nnot only to the Security Council but also to the General\r\nAssembly and the United Nations as a whole. We must\r\nbe constantly monitoring our own performance, asking\r\nourselves whether we are managing to handle issues\r\nsuccessfully, improving on procedural matters and\r\nworking methods, being transparent and open among\r\nourselves and enhancing our credibility and prestige\r\nwith the international community. Reform is a\r\ncontinuous process that requires our devotion and\r\nconstant effort. Japan is prepared to do its utmost in\r\norder to make a significant contribution to that process.\r\nMr. Akram (Pakistan): This debate on\r\nstrengthening the United Nations system and\r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly is important,\r\nessential and timely. Every institution needs to\r\ncontinue to renew itself in order to stay relevant,\r\nefficient and effective. Today, even the Organization’s\r\nstrongest detractors recognize that it is relevant if the\r\nold and new challenges which face the international\r\ncommunity are to be addressed.\r\nThe Secretary-General outlined these challenges\r\nin his opening remarks at the inauguration of the\r\nAssembly’s general debate last month. His call for\r\ninstitutional review and reform was timely. We\r\nwelcome his initiative to convene a group of eminent\r\npersonalities to deliberate and make recommendations\r\nto him for consideration by Member States. We trust\r\nthat the composition and work of those eminent\r\npersonalities will reflect the broad spectrum of views\r\nand approaches to reform which exist in this Assembly.\r\nThe statement made by Algeria today reflects the\r\nbroad approach of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nPakistan aligns itself with that approach.\r\nWe thank Deputy Secretary-General Fréchette for\r\nher statement and for her dedicated efforts to preserve\r\nand promote the institutional vitality of the United\r\nNations.\r\nPakistan greatly appreciates the vigour with\r\nwhich the President of the Assembly has devoted\r\nhimself to promoting the reform process. His informal\r\npaper of 17 October provides an invaluable framework\r\nand guide for our work on the General Assembly’s\r\nrevitalization.\r\nWe must commence by acknowledging that,\r\nthanks to the purposeful efforts of Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan, considerable progress has been made\r\nsince 1997 in improving the United Nations Secretariat\r\nand its support machinery. Pakistan has contributed to\r\nthis process, especially to human management reform,\r\nand we will continue our active participation.\r\nWe endorse the Secretary-General’s suggestion\r\nthat attention now be focused on the institutional\r\nreform of the intergovernmental organs of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Assembly discussed the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council recently, and I will not repeat our\r\nviews on that issue. But in the context of United\r\nNations reform, it is necessary to draw attention to the\r\nfollowing considerations. First, the Security Council is\r\nprogressively extending the scope of its responsibilities\r\nfar beyond the role — the central role — it was\r\nassigned in the Charter to deal with threats to\r\ninternational peace and security. New efforts to entrust\r\nthe Council with responsibilities for counter-\r\nproliferation while ignoring the goals of disarmament\r\nis a current case in point.\r\nSecondly, the deliberations of the Council lack\r\ntransparency and openness, contrary to rule 48 of its\r\nprovisional rules of procedure. This ethos of opacity on\r\nthe part of the Council must be changed. It is for the\r\nAssembly to insist on that change, here and in the\r\nconcerned capitals.\r\nWhile criticism of the Security Council’s\r\nshortcomings are subdued, assessments of this\r\nAssembly are often harsh. Inefficient, ineffective and\r\nirrelevant are often the adjectives in a description of\r\nthe General Assembly. Such harsh assessments ignore\r\nhistory and international politics. The General\r\nAssembly has registered many outstanding historic\r\nachievements. It played the leading role in enabling the\r\npeoples under colonial rule to liberate themselves\r\nthrough the exercise of the right of self-determination.\r\nThe Assembly has contributed immensely to the\r\nevolution of international law and norms. It has\r\naddressed issues of peace and security, and opposed\r\naggression and the use of force whenever the Security\r\nCouncil was paralysed by partisan vetoes. It has\r\ncreated institutions for international cooperation in\r\nvital fields and convened conferences to mobilize the\r\ninternational community on issues of global priority.\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nIt is not surprising that the Assembly’s agenda is\r\nlong and often overloaded. Each of the States Members\r\nof the United Nations has a sovereign and democratic\r\nright to bring before the Assembly its difficulties and\r\nits despair, its ideas and its initiatives.\r\nOur agenda would be shorter if the problems and\r\nissues brought before the Assembly could be speedily\r\nresolved. The much advertised irrelevance of the\r\nGeneral Assembly has, in fact, been inflicted on it.\r\nTransferring consideration of most of the burning\r\nissues of our time — terrorism, non-proliferation and\r\ndisarmament — to the Security Council sucks the\r\npolitical oxygen out of the General Assembly.\r\nEnhancing the role of the Assembly is a political, not a\r\nprocedural exercise.\r\nSadly, despite their profession of respect for the\r\nprinciple of sovereign equality, some States support\r\nproposals to create more restricted bodies — an\r\nexecutive committee, steering committee, or other\r\nselect and privileged groups — within the General\r\nAssembly, ostensibly to enhance its efficiency and\r\neffectiveness. Such bodies, like the Security Council,\r\nmay be able to adopt decisions more quickly and\r\nperhaps more clearly, but they will lack universality\r\nand legitimacy. They will deprive the majority of a\r\nvoice on the most important issues. They will increase\r\ninequality within the United Nations. They will\r\ntransform the Assembly into a rubber stamp.\r\nThis is not to say that procedural improvements\r\nshould not be made in the General Assembly’s work. A\r\nnumber of useful suggestions have been advanced\r\nwhich merit positive consideration.\r\nFirst, the rationalization of the Assembly’s\r\nagenda is a desirable objective. Similar items can be\r\namalgamated. Related items can be grouped. Some\r\nitems which are no longer of interest to any Member\r\nState can be eliminated. Several items presently taken\r\nup by the plenary could be assigned to a Main\r\nCommittee. At the same time, the agenda must remain\r\nopen to the insertion of new issues which may arise.\r\nHowever, it must be borne in mind that the\r\nrationalization of the agenda is essentially a political\r\nexercise. We should first decide who will review and\r\nrecommend the agenda’s rationalization — the General\r\nCommittee, friends of the President or a specially\r\ncreated group. Discussions will have to take place in\r\nconsultation with the States with an interest in the\r\nitems concerned. And any criteria utilized to guide\r\nthose decisions will have to be applied equitably.\r\nSecondly, the Assembly can do much to improve\r\nthe content of its resolutions. We should attempt to\r\nrestrict ourselves to shorter resolutions, at least on\r\nthose items which have been previously considered. It\r\ncould also be a requirement that draft resolutions on\r\nold items be submitted and circulated a few days before\r\nconsideration of the item, so that discussion can focus\r\non the draft resolution rather than become a repetition\r\nof general views. On new issues, debates may be\r\nnecessary before the drafting of decisions.\r\nThirdly, the Main Committees of the Assembly\r\nhave developed their own entrenched cultures. There is\r\na need to harmonize their work. There is also need to\r\nintroduce uniformity in the decision-making process in\r\nthe various Committees. Some of them work on the\r\nbasis of consensus. Others resort to voting as a norm.\r\nYet others show a mix of practices.\r\nFourthly, covering the simultaneous meetings of\r\nthe plenary and six Main Committees is beyond the\r\ncapacity of most of the smaller delegations. It also\r\nstretches the conference services. Permanent\r\nrepresentatives are unable to devote adequate attention\r\nto all the issues. As suggested by many from this\r\nrostrum, the sequential convening of the Committee\r\nmeetings, spread from the first of January to the middle\r\nof September should be seriously considered. The\r\nresults of the Committees could be collectively\r\napproved in the plenary when it convenes in September\r\nfor the general debate.\r\nThe management of the plenary and the Main\r\nCommittees through the year should be entrusted to the\r\npresident of the General Assembly. To enable him to\r\ndischarge those responsibilities, it seems essential to\r\nstrengthen the president’s executive office.\r\nAnother extremely important aspect is\r\ncooperation between the Assembly and the other main\r\norgans of the United Nations, particularly the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council. Greater\r\ncoherence in the work of the three organs will bring\r\nsynergy to our work. In that context, my delegation has\r\nproposed the idea of composite committees whose\r\nmemberships are to be drawn from the three main\r\norgans in order to address complex crises.\r\nConsiderable attention has also been devoted to\r\nthe reform and revival of the Economic and Social\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nCouncil. It cannot be revived merely by changing its\r\nname. If an Economic and Social Security Council is\r\ncreated, will it be empowered to consider and decide\r\non central issues relating to the management of\r\ninternational economic and social relations? Will its\r\ndecisions be binding on Member States like the\r\nSecurity Council’s and thus be implemented by\r\nMember States? In our view, it may be more productive\r\nto focus on ways and means to operationalize the\r\nresponsibility entrusted to the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil under the Charter and in the recent decisions\r\nfor integrated coordination and follow-up of the major\r\ninternational conferences.\r\nAside from the question of political will, the\r\ndecisions of Member States cannot be realized without\r\nadequate resources. It is ironic that parsimony is\r\npracticed only when it comes to financing the\r\noperations and actions of the United Nations. The\r\npolitical and moral justification for constraining the\r\nUnited Nations to virtually zero growth must be\r\nquestioned. The concomitant of United Nations reform\r\nmust be the political commitment by all States to fund\r\nthe approved activities of the United Nations.\r\nPakistan believes that reform of the budget of the\r\nUnited Nations and the budget formulation process will\r\nstrengthen the Organization. For us, the most important\r\nissue is the end result. We would support a formula that\r\nbetter enables the Organization to achieve its mandates\r\nand which ensures an alignment of resources with the\r\npriority activities of the Organization.\r\nHowever, some of the systemic implications of a\r\nchange in the current budgetary process need to be\r\nexamined closely.\r\nFirst, if we were to change the format of the\r\nmedium-term plan (MTP) and the role of the\r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination (CPC),\r\nthrough what mechanism will Member States ensure\r\nthat all mandates have been translated into\r\nimplementable programmes and provided the adequate\r\nfunding?\r\nSecondly, how do we handle the setting of\r\npriorities, a function that currently falls within the\r\npurview of the CPC? Thirdly, what would be the role\r\nof the MTP and who would frame and review it? And if\r\nit is to be abolished and replaced by a strategic\r\nframework, as is being proposed by the Joint\r\nInspection Unit, which inter-governmental body would\r\nframe and review the framework?\r\nWe look forward to a substantive and constructive\r\ndebate on this important item, which has far-reaching\r\nimplications for the future of our Organization and\r\nindeed for inter-State relations. We assure the president\r\nof the full cooperation of the Pakistan delegation in\r\nevolving positive and generally acceptable decisions to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations and revitalize the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Fadaifard (Islamic Republic of Iran): I wish\r\nto begin by expressing my gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for pursuing United Nations reform. I also\r\npraise him for his reports on the different aspects of\r\nUnited Nations reform and his proposals for\r\nstreamlining the work of the General Assembly and its\r\nMain Committees.\r\nI cannot fail to convey my delegation’s support\r\nfor the president’s efforts aimed at revitalizing the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and we appreciate the non-paper\r\nthat he circulated. My delegation would like also to\r\nassociate itself with the statements made by the\r\nAmbassador of Algeria as the coordinator of the\r\nworking group of the Non-Aligned Movement and the\r\nAmbassador of Morocco on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nThe General Assembly represents the principle of\r\nsovereign equality among Member States and manages\r\nto bring their representatives together on an equal\r\nfooting. As such, it offers a unique opportunity for\r\ndeliberations among all Member States and\r\nengagement in cooperation on a broad spectrum of\r\nissues at the global level. It is true that the General\r\nAssembly often can make decisions based only on the\r\nlowest common denominator, but the significance of its\r\ndecisions arises more from its legitimate and all-\r\nencompassing nature. Thus, given the central position\r\nof the General Assembly in the United Nations system,\r\nit is all the more necessary to ponder and act more\r\neffectively, with a view to bringing about appropriate\r\nand necessary changes in the way it works.\r\nIn fulfilling such a task, my delegation sees merit\r\nin grouping revitalization issues in two clusters — the\r\nfirst is on enhancing the authority and the role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the second is on improving the\r\nAssembly’s working methods. Those two clusters are,\r\nno doubt, interrelated. If Member States demonstrated\r\ntheir political commitment to strengthening the\r\nauthority and the role of the General Assembly, we\r\nbelieve that its working methods would take on more\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nimportance and could be much more easily addressed.\r\nIn our view, seeking to ensure a balanced and\r\ncomprehensive approach to such a delicate exercise\r\nrequires that such a sequence not be ignored.\r\nThe same attitude may be adopted with respect to\r\nthe reform of the Economic and Social Council.\r\nMeanwhile, we face a different set of problems when it\r\ncomes to the functioning of the Security Council and\r\ninternational financial institutions. We concur with the\r\nSecretary-General that decisions may be more easily\r\nreached in these bodies, and that in some cases they\r\nmay have a decisive impact on events in the world. But\r\nthe difficulty with those decisions is the fact that they\r\nare considered less legitimate in the eyes of many\r\nnations, especially in the developing world, which feels\r\nthat its views and interests are not sufficiently taken\r\ninto consideration in the decision-making process.\r\nWe are pleased that, following a long process of\r\nnegotiation during the fifty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Member States could adopt a\r\nresolution by consensus on the integrated and\r\ncoordinated implementation of and follow-up to the\r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits. Regardless of the complexities involved, we\r\nhope that this achievement can enable the United\r\nNations, particularly two of its important organs — the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil — to better respond to the development needs\r\nof developing countries through efficient organization\r\nof their work, in keeping with the priorities of the\r\ninternational community. In our view, that cannot take\r\nplace in isolation from past relevant General Assembly\r\nresolutions, the ongoing debate on United Nations\r\nreform, the need for reflection of macroeconomic\r\nperspectives and the strengthening of developmental\r\nissues in the work of the Main Committees of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMy delegation is also appreciative of the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the review of technical\r\ncooperation in the United Nations (A/58/382). We can\r\ngo along with his conclusions and recommendations,\r\nparticularly the one that requests the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme to undertake a review of a\r\nfew key issues on which the division of labour can be\r\nimproved. Cooperation, coordination and greater\r\ninteraction among United Nations agencies, funds and\r\nprogrammes, international financial institutions and the\r\nregional banks, for increased complementarity and\r\nbetter division of labour have been stressed in\r\nnumerous decisions of the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. The main objective of\r\nsuch coordination should be strengthening and building\r\nupon existing arrangements for support to developing\r\ncountries, in accordance with their priorities and,\r\nneedless to say, under the leadership of the national\r\nGovernment, for greater efficiency and impact.\r\nMy delegation has noted the efforts aimed at\r\nstreamlining publications and reports, as well as\r\nplanning and managing conferences and meetings. We\r\nsupport consultative processes among the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the President of the General Assembly and the\r\nChairmen of the Main Committees for consolidating\r\nreports on related topics, on the basis of decisions of\r\nthe Main Committees, as a means to facilitate debate\r\nand reduce documentation, while maintaining balance\r\namong various issues.\r\nWe support the intensified efforts for\r\nsimplification and improvement of the planning and\r\nbudgetary process of the United Nations. The budget\r\ndocument itself has been shortened and attempts have\r\nbeen made to align activities with priorities. It is hoped\r\nthat these changes, along with efforts to enhance\r\ntransparency and the quality of information contained\r\nin the budget document, will assist Member States in\r\ntheir intergovernmental discussions.\r\nAs requested in resolution 57/300, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has recently submitted a more detailed\r\nproposal on a shorter, more strategic medium-term plan\r\nthat is linked to the budget outline and a reinforced\r\nsystem of evaluation and monitoring. The proposal on\r\na single-stage intergovernmental review of the\r\nmedium-term plan and programme budget has also\r\nbeen clarified. While we look forward to examining all\r\nthe details of these crucial proposals, along with\r\nreviewing the other aspects of the planning and\r\nbudgeting process, we stress that the results of this\r\ncomprehensive exercise should ultimately contribute to\r\nthe strengthening of effective intergovernmental\r\nparticipation at all stages of the process in order to\r\nensure the best results through the effective\r\nimplementation of mandates.\r\nTo better identify and reflect priorities in\r\nprogrammes and activities, we need to ensure that all\r\nintergovernmental mandates are incorporated into the\r\nmedium-term plan as the basic strategic directive of the\r\nOrganization. Programme planning should continue to\r\nbe built on legislative mandates, as the determining\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nfactor in this regard, and, therefore, resources cannot\r\nconstitute the basis for priority setting. Efforts to\r\nsupport the existing coherence between planning and\r\nbudgeting exercises should, rather, enhance alignment\r\nof budget provisions with priorities. In this connection,\r\nincreased allocation of resources to areas that can\r\ncontribute to narrowing the widening economic gap\r\nbetween North and South is enormously fundamental.\r\nThere are compelling arguments that further negligence\r\nof such realities would pose severe threats to peace and\r\nsecurity in the world.\r\nReform of the General Assembly and its Main\r\nCommittees is not only a necessity, but an obligation,\r\nin order to rebuild the Organization into a dynamic\r\ninternational institution in the age of globalization. It is\r\na means to achieve the goal of turning the United\r\nNations into an effective universal organization, ready\r\nto address contemporary challenges. The principal\r\nobjective would be to enhance capacities and to\r\nstrengthen the capabilities of multilateral machinery for\r\ncollective action in response to global demands and\r\nconcerns. Hence, reform proposals should refrain from\r\nadopting selective approaches and instead present\r\nsolutions that will enable the United Nations to\r\nimplement the priorities identified by its Member\r\nStates.\r\nThe high-level panel of eminent personalities\r\nproposed by the Secretary-General could contribute to\r\nthese deliberations if its membership represents an\r\ninternational character and the diversified opinions\r\nprevailing within the Organization.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that only\r\nMember States can take firm and clear decisions on the\r\nrecommendations of the Panel. Therefore, the terms of\r\nreference of such a Panel should underscore the\r\nintergovernmental process of decision-making in the\r\nUnited Nations. The consideration of institutional\r\nreform as a last resort could also be included in the\r\nprogramme of work of the Panel if that is the only way\r\nto realize the aspirations of Member States, particularly\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nIn conclusion, we share the view of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the events of the last year have reinforced\r\nhis statement that\r\n“the need for a strong multilateral institution —\r\none dedicated to the service of humanity as a\r\nwhole — has never been more acutely felt than in\r\nthe current era of globalization”. (A/57/387,\r\npara. 2)\r\nMy delegation, in its turn, reiterates its readiness and\r\ncommitment to actively participating in achieving that\r\nrequirement.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): My delegation\r\naligns itself with the statement of the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Algeria on behalf of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement.\r\nDuring the Millennium Summit in 2000, the\r\nlargest number of heads of State and Government ever\r\nto assemble at the United Nations reaffirmed\r\n“the central position of the General Assembly as\r\nthe chief deliberative, policy-making and\r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations”\r\n(resolution 55/2, para. 30)\r\nand called on it to be strengthened so as to play that\r\nrole effectively. We wish to contribute three concrete\r\nproposals on how this mandate could be implemented.\r\nSouth Africa welcomes the Secretary-General’s\r\nintention to appoint a blue-ribbon panel that is\r\nexpected to review the effectiveness, coherence and\r\nbalance of roles between the principal organs of the\r\nUnited Nations. We are committed to the reform and\r\nexpansion of the Security Council and the\r\nrevitalization of the Economic and Social Council. We\r\nalso are interested in redefining the relationship of the\r\nUnited Nations system with the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, including the World Trade Organization.\r\nHowever, in this debate we wish to make specific\r\nproposals only about the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe fully concur with the President’s suggested\r\nframework for action, which will consider the issue of\r\nthe revitalization and reform of the General Assembly\r\nin two clusters. The first is on enhancing the authority\r\nand role of the General Assembly, and the second is on\r\nimproving the working methods of the General\r\nAssembly. We believe that these issues are interrelated\r\nand must be addressed in a comprehensive and\r\ncoherent manner.\r\nFrankly, the machinery of this Assembly has\r\nbecome cumbersome and overburdened with an ever-\r\ngrowing agenda. Its working methods do not allow for\r\nflexibility to address the ever-changing global agenda.\r\nThe United Nations of the twenty-first century requires\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nleadership that is allowed room to be proactive,\r\ncreative and not constrained by procedures that were\r\ndesigned for the post-Second World War period. It is\r\ntherefore not sufficient to lament the lack of authority\r\nof the General Assembly and its diminished role in\r\nrelation to the Security Council and other principal\r\norgans. We carry the solemn responsibility to restore\r\nthe General Assembly as the chief deliberative policy-\r\nmaking body of the United Nations by addressing the\r\nreasons for the erosion of its authority.\r\nMember States would have to concede that it is\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to address more than 170\r\nresolutions in a plenary session that lasts only 13\r\nweeks. After all, there are probably few, if any, of the\r\nParliaments of the Member States that address their\r\nnational priorities in sessions of less than three months.\r\nOur rules of procedure certainly do not limit the\r\nGeneral Assembly plenary session to between\r\nSeptember and Christmas Eve. My delegation is aware\r\nthat a special committee in 1971 did not endorse a\r\nsuggestion that the session of the General Assembly be\r\ndivided into two parts. However, since then the United\r\nNations has expanded and its agenda has grown\r\ntremendously. The General Assembly does meet from\r\nSeptember of one year to the following September.\r\nHowever, we would be disingenuous if we did not\r\nadmit that the real attention is paid to issues considered\r\nfrom September to December, which is the reason we\r\nall want our resolutions introduced during this period.\r\nTherefore, we agree with the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement’s working group on the revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly that we should consider dividing the\r\nAssembly’s plenary sessions into two parts. We believe\r\nthat Member States can easily dedicate a second\r\nplenary session of the General Assembly to be held in\r\nthe weeks or months beyond Christmas Eve and before\r\nthe following September. Outside of those two\r\ndedicated plenary sessions, the General Assembly\r\nwould still be available to meet in plenary and to\r\naddress any emergency issues that might arise.\r\nAnother reality we face is that more than 80 per\r\ncent of our missions have less than 10 officials,\r\nincluding administration and office staff. Therefore, in\r\nsimultaneously scheduling meetings of the General\r\nAssembly plenary, the Main Committees — as we are\r\ndoing this afternoon — the Security Council, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and even regional and\r\nother groups, we ourselves are making it impossible for\r\nthe majority of United Nations Members to participate\r\nin the business of the Organization, such as we are\r\nconducting right now. As a result, this raises questions\r\nas to whether we are able to take decisions that are\r\ninclusive and relevant to the rest of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIt is for these reasons that my delegation would\r\npropose that we consider the sequencing of Committee\r\nmeetings so as to allow as many delegations as possible\r\nto participate in the decision-making process. Having\r\ntwo dedicated General Assembly plenary sessions\r\nwould allow Committees to spread their work over a\r\nlonger period. It would also reaffirm the purposes for\r\nwhich the Main Committees were created, that is, to\r\nconduct thorough analyses and assessments of and to\r\npropose policy responses to the many complex\r\nchallenges facing the United Nations.\r\nAlso, we believe that it is essential for us to\r\nredefine the role and purpose of the plenary sessions of\r\nthe Assembly. We urge that consideration be given to\r\nholding General Assembly plenary meetings\r\ninfrequently, perhaps even a few times a month. This\r\nwould allow the plenary to be dedicated to important\r\ncurrent debates, including focusing on thematic\r\ndebates. Calling for almost daily plenary meetings to\r\ndiscuss virtually every issue on the calendar makes it\r\nhard for delegations — much less for the world at\r\nlarge — to focus on those discussions.\r\nWe can all recall the few occasions when the\r\nGeneral Assembly plenary has dedicated significant\r\ntime to an important issue and when all missions, big\r\nand small, have participated and even the world at\r\nlarge has followed our deliberations with interest. A\r\nrecent example was the resumed tenth emergency\r\nspecial session held this past week, in which, for one\r\nafternoon and late into the evening, the General\r\nAssembly discussed in plenary the issue of the\r\nseparation wall that Israel is building in Palestine. The\r\nimpact and decision of that debate was felt throughout\r\nthe world.\r\nFor us to revitalize the debates of the General\r\nAssembly plenary, we would have to agree on issues to\r\nbe scheduled for these plenary meetings. If, for\r\nexample, we agree that the Secretary-General’s report\r\non the follow-up to the Millennium Summit is\r\nimportant, we must schedule a General Assembly\r\nplenary meeting, in which everyone can have an\r\nopportunity to attend and participate. That might mean\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nthat we would agree to adjourn the work of the\r\nCommittees and of the Security Council so as to allow\r\nall Members to participate in such an important plenary\r\ndebate. That would require us to be creative and to\r\nprioritize our work if we wish to have an impact and\r\npronounce on the changing global agenda. The fact\r\nthat, right now, some of us may think that is an\r\nimpossible goal to achieve may be one of the reasons\r\nwe have failed in reforming and revitalizing the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to restate the three\r\nconcrete proposals we wish to contribute to this debate.\r\nWe should seriously consider extending the General\r\nAssembly session beyond Christmas Eve; there should\r\nbe sequencing of the work of the Main Committees so\r\nas to allow greater democratic participation and\r\ndecision-making; and we must reserve General\r\nAssembly plenary meetings for debating important\r\nglobal issues.\r\nNone of those concrete suggestions can take\r\neffect without the leadership of the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. My delegation is pleased that we\r\nelect the President two or three months before the next\r\nsession begins. Now we must look into providing the\r\nincoming President with all the necessary resources\r\nand tools — including a temporary office with\r\nSecretariat support — which would allow the incoming\r\nPresident to prepare for the upcoming session. That, we\r\nbelieve, would enable the President to hit the ground\r\nrunning.\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): We support the statements\r\nmade this morning by the representative of Algeria, on\r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement; by the\r\nrepresentative of Morocco, on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China; and by the representative of Suriname,\r\non behalf of the Caribbean Community. We wish only\r\nto emphasize a number of points that the delegation of\r\nJamaica considers to be of importance.\r\nIn the course of the general debate, concluded last\r\nmonth, a common theme was the need for a\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations. An important\r\ndimension of that is the reform and revitalization of the\r\norgans and institutional arrangements of the system.\r\nWe have already expressed our views on the question\r\nof reform of the Security Council, which is a\r\nparamount and urgent priority. Of equal importance is\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, which does not\r\nneed reform as much as a reassertion of its authority\r\nand mandate. As provided in Articles 10 and 11 of the\r\nCharter, it should play a pivotal role in the management\r\nof the international system. We do not contemplate any\r\nCharter amendment, but rather practical measures to\r\nrestore its status and role, which might require some\r\nchanges in the rules of procedure. We should like to\r\nsuggest some of those lines of action.\r\nFirst, revitalization should mean a more active\r\nAssembly. We should increase the holding of scheduled\r\nAssembly meetings throughout the year by way of\r\ndistributing the agenda over time and addressing\r\ncritical issues as they arise. That could happen at least\r\nat quarterly intervals. Those should include at least one\r\nsession devoted especially to substantive consideration\r\nof economic development issues, bringing together all\r\nrelevant agencies within the United Nations system.\r\nThat should become an occasion not just for debate and\r\nexchange of views, but also for the formulation of\r\ncommon principles to guide economic cooperation and\r\ndevelopment policy with respect to trade, finance and\r\ntechnology.\r\nIn the area of peace and security, there is room\r\nfor the Assembly to play a more active role throughout\r\nthe year in reviewing the work of the Security Council\r\nto preserve the principle of accountability, in keeping\r\nwith the provisions of Article 24 of the Charter.\r\nMeetings could be held on the basis of special reports\r\nrequested when the Council has been unable to act on\r\nmatters affecting international peace and security by\r\nvirtue of a deadlock in the decision-making process.\r\nSpecial meetings might also be necessary when the\r\nCouncil is authorizing enforcement action, since such\r\ndecisions are binding on all Member States. If that is\r\ndone, we would have a more active Assembly more\r\ndirectly involved in the management of global affairs,\r\nas envisaged in Articles 10 and 11 of the Charter.\r\nSecond, revitalization should restore the authority\r\nof the Assembly in the areas of its competence. We see\r\ntwo things that should be done. To begin with, the\r\nholding of thematic debates in the Security Council\r\nshould be discontinued. These generally concern\r\nmatters that should be left for debate and resolution in\r\nthe General Assembly. Our view is that the Security\r\nCouncil’s ambit of responsibility is generally described\r\nin Articles 34 and 39. We believe that thematic debates\r\nconstitute an encroachment on the areas of\r\nresponsibility of the General Assembly, which is\r\nempowered to decide on policies and programmes in\r\nrelation to those issues.\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nOur other concern is with respect to the\r\nassignment to international conferences of subject\r\nmatters that ordinarily have to be dealt with at special\r\nsessions of the General Assembly. What has resulted is\r\nthat, in many areas of social and economic affairs, the\r\nreference points for international policy are\r\ninternational conference decisions, not resolutions of\r\nthe General Assembly. That has weakened the\r\nAssembly’s role as the authentic voice of the\r\ninternational community in relation to such matters.\r\nThe third area of action would be in the\r\nstrengthening of the office of the presidency. That\r\nmeans incorporating the presidency into consultations\r\naffecting all important initiatives and activities within\r\nthe United Nations system. We should also be able to\r\ndeploy the President as the representative of the United\r\nNations at international consultations and meetings of\r\nvarious bodies at both the regional and specialized\r\nlevels and at meetings with world leaders. There is an\r\nopportunity to develop an outreach programme that\r\nwould bring the United Nations into closer contact with\r\nthe world outside to increase visibility and public\r\nawareness of developments in the United Nations. That\r\nwould necessarily entail the provision of greater\r\nstaffing and financial resources for the presidency. The\r\ncurrent level of resources provided from the regular\r\nbudget does not allow for any active role or much room\r\nfor outreach activities.\r\nFourth, revitalization requires more substantive\r\ndecision-making by the General Assembly. Regrettably,\r\nin recent years the decisions of the General Assembly\r\nhave become increasingly devoid of substance. That is\r\ndue largely to the tendency to seek a consensus based\r\non the lowest common denominator. The result of that\r\nis the passage of resolutions with studied ambiguity in\r\ntheir language, which fail to give a clear, positive\r\ndirection in matters of international cooperation. Very\r\noften, such decisions are patchwork formulations of\r\nwhat is called agreed language — extracted from\r\nnegotiated texts from conference outcomes — and do\r\nnot reflect the needs of a changing international\r\nsituation. Our view is that there is a need to develop a\r\nbetter approach to decision-making, in keeping with\r\nthe democratic principles of Article 18 of the Charter.\r\nFifth, revitalization should mean a greater focus\r\non implementation. We believe that there should be a\r\nspecial mechanism in the Secretariat for the monitoring\r\nof the implementation of General Assembly decisions,\r\nand special focus in the reports of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral identifying the problem areas.\r\nSixth, revitalization should bring improvements\r\nin the working methods of the General Assembly. In\r\nthis respect, we generally support two broad initiatives.\r\nFirst, we support the attempt at rationalization of\r\nthe agenda by redistributing items either through a\r\nbiennial or triennial cycle and, where necessary, by\r\nretiring items which may no longer have currency or by\r\narranging for mergers between related items, so as to\r\nrationalize the agenda.\r\nSecondly, we support arrangements for an\r\ninteractive format for debates on agenda items. We\r\nbelieve that there is a need for change from the dull\r\nmonotony of prepared statements. One strategy would\r\nbe to use structured panels, which has two advantages.\r\nIt would bring more expert information and analysis to\r\nassist Member States on particular subjects, and it\r\nwould also stimulate more interactive discussion based\r\non the material so provided.\r\nMy seventh point is the recognition that an\r\nimportant dimension of revitalization is a political\r\nrevitalization on the part of Member States, who must\r\nadhere to the obligations and commitments of the\r\nmultilateral process and participate in an open and\r\ntransparent way through a full exchange of views in an\r\natmosphere of respect, cooperation and goodwill.\r\nSuch a revitalization in participation is important\r\nto ensure that the system works for all of us. The\r\ngradual marginalization of the General Assembly over\r\nthe years is, to a large extent, the result of our own\r\nnegligence and of some degree of complacency and\r\nacquiescence. What is needed now is for a new spirit, a\r\nnew commitment and a new energy to infuse the\r\nmultilateral system. We therefore consider it important\r\nthat whatever revitalization measures we agree on be\r\naccompanied by a political declaration reaffirming\r\nmultilateralism and a commitment to energize the role\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nIn closing, I wish briefly to comment on\r\nrestructuring and revitalization in the economic, social\r\nand related fields. In our view, there is considerable\r\nscope for reform to ensure that overview, direction and\r\ncoordination in the economic fields can become more\r\neffective. We are fortunate that, under the current\r\nleadership of the Economic and Social Council, reform\r\nis being pursued. I feel, however, that we are\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nhandicapped by not having a specific mechanism to\r\nchannel and coordinate all initiatives for reform. We\r\nfeel that, in the light of all that is happening, it would\r\nbe appropriate to create an ad hoc committee to\r\nexamine and report on current initiatives for\r\nconsideration before the closure of the fifty-eighth\r\nsession.\r\nMr. Rastam (Malaysia): I should like to focus on\r\nagenda item 55, “Revitalization of the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly”. My delegation would like to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Hunte for the efforts he has made\r\nsince assuming the presidency to introduce a fresh\r\napproach and dynamism to the consideration of this\r\nitem. The resourcefulness, innovativeness and\r\ndetermination that he and his team have brought to this\r\nexercise augur well for the emergence of a dynamic\r\nand revitalized General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation is convinced that his decision to\r\nbegin consultations on this highly important question\r\nright from the very beginning of his presidency was a\r\nmove in the right direction, one that has generated a\r\nrenewed interest among delegations in coalescing\r\naround the presidency in order to achieve concrete\r\nresults aimed at revitalizing the General Assembly. We\r\nare extremely encouraged by that move.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the\r\nstatements made by the Permanent Representative of\r\nAlgeria, in his capacity as Coordinator of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement Working Group on the Reform of\r\nthe United Nations and the Revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Morocco on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China. Given the importance of this item to my\r\ndelegation, I wish to add and emphasize a few points. I\r\nshould like also to congratulate the various speakers\r\nwho took the floor earlier who made some very, very\r\npertinent points.\r\nMalaysia fully subscribes to the position of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement on the questions of\r\nstrengthening, restructuring, revitalizing and\r\ndemocratizing the United Nations, as contained in\r\nparagraphs 26 to 33 of the Final Document of the\r\nthirteenth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, held\r\nin Kuala Lumpur from 20 to 25 February 2003.\r\nMalaysia also fully subscribes to the position of the\r\nGroup of 77 on these questions, as contained in the\r\nDeclaration of its Ministerial Meeting, convened in\r\nNew York last month.\r\nIn our discussions on this very important issue,\r\nthree words and concepts are often used: revitalization,\r\nrestructuring and strengthening. I would simply like to\r\nremind myself of the meaning of these words. The\r\nOxford dictionary offers the following definitions of\r\nthese words: revitalization means “to put new life”;\r\nrestructuring means “giving a new or different structure\r\nor arrangement”; and strengthening means “causing\r\nsomething or somebody to become stronger”.\r\nI think that we all are in agreement that we need\r\nto put new life into the General Assembly. There is the\r\nview that much of the oxygen has been sucked out of\r\nit. There is also probably the view that the General\r\nAssembly has become lethargic and is losing its\r\nmemory, its hearing and its teeth. There is also the\r\nview that the General Assembly needs a new, or\r\npossibly a different structure or arrangements. What is\r\nmost important is that we are all in agreement as to the\r\nneed to prescribe the General Assembly a new blend of\r\ntonic, however bitter it might be.\r\nWe all know exactly what the problems and\r\nsymptoms are. We all have ideas on what needs to be\r\ndone. We all are fully aware of the final destination\r\nthat should be reached in this process. We have a\r\npossible road map for reaching it, in the form of the\r\ninformal note that the President has prepared, as well\r\nas other existing documents, in particular the Charter\r\nof the United Nations, the Millennium Declaration and\r\nrelevant General Assembly resolutions.\r\nMy delegation sincerely hopes that, with the\r\ncurrent momentum and under the leadership of\r\nMr. Hunte all Member States can come together to\r\nbegin a process of genuine change, revitalization and\r\nstrengthening, which would truly have an impact on\r\nmaking the work of the General Assembly more\r\nefficient and effective, so that its voice can be heard\r\nand its decisions respected and implemented.\r\nArticles 10 to 17 of the Charter of the United\r\nNations clearly outline the functions and powers of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Numerous resolutions have also\r\nbeen adopted by the Assembly over the years that are\r\naimed at enhancing its efficiency and effectiveness,\r\nincluding as concerns its methods of work. We note\r\nthat most of the provisions of those resolutions have\r\nbeen successfully implemented. However, there are\r\nsome important ones which have not. The President’s\r\nefforts to implement the relevant provisions is a good\r\nstart, and we welcome it.\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nWe have noted the background document\r\nprepared by the Secretariat on the chronology and\r\nanalysis of the relevant General Assembly resolutions.\r\nWe think that one of the immediate tasks before us\r\nshould be to review this question and find ways and\r\nmeans to ensure that past decisions and resolutions can\r\nbe implemented, taking into account the fact that it\r\nmay be necessary to make certain modifications in\r\naccordance with changing circumstances.\r\nIn this connection, my delegation would like to\r\nsuggest that the Secretariat, in particular the\r\nDepartment of General Assembly and Conference\r\nManagement, be requested to monitor the\r\nimplementation of all resolutions of the General\r\nAssembly, as well as to help ensure the application of\r\nthe relevant Articles of the Charter relating to the work\r\nof the General Assembly. We could agree on the need\r\nfor Member States to be more accountable in initiating\r\ndraft resolutions and in monitoring the implementation\r\nof resolutions once they have been adopted. It is for us,\r\nthe Member States, to ensure the effectiveness of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We have to ensure that the\r\nAssembly’s decisions and recommendations are\r\nfollowed up, complied with and implemented sincerely\r\nand wholeheartedly by all parties concerned. My\r\ndelegation believes that we would be moving in the\r\nright direction if the sponsors of resolutions played a\r\nmore responsible role in ensuring not only ownership,\r\nbut also follow up, accountability and implementation.\r\nObviously, there is a need in the revitalization\r\nexercise to examine the resolutions churned out by the\r\nGeneral Assembly annually. Between the fifty-first\r\nsession and the fifty-sixth session, the number of\r\nresolutions increased from 311 to 360. What is\r\nimportant is not the number of resolutions but the need\r\nfor them to be more concise and focused. Ensuring\r\ntheir actual implementation by Member States, the\r\nSecretariat and others should be our primary\r\nconsideration. In this regard, the experience of work\r\ndone in other international bodies and in national\r\nparliaments might be instructive for us in the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nOne of the issues that need to be looked at closely\r\nin the revitalization process is that of reports and the\r\nreporting process. Relevant General Assembly\r\nresolutions need to be reviewed in order to allow for an\r\nhonest assessment on the part of Member States with\r\nregard to, for example, whether it would be in the\r\ninterests of everyone to continue with the practice of\r\nrequesting the Secretary-General to produce more\r\nreports every year. Further improvements could be\r\nmade to the reporting process.\r\nMy delegation would like to add its voice in\r\nsupport of the view that the office of the President\r\nshould be further strengthened. We must do all we can\r\nto ensure that this can be achieved, including by\r\nensuring the provision of adequate financial and other\r\nresources. We commend the effort of the President to\r\nhave a corps of experienced diplomats and experts\r\nwithin his cabinet to assist him in his work during this\r\nsession of the General Assembly. But that, of course, is\r\nnot enough. The presidency should be supported by\r\nadequate resources and staff from the Secretariat.\r\nPrevious General Assembly resolutions, in particular\r\nresolution 51/241, need to be reviewed and\r\nre-examined in the effort to strengthen the role of the\r\nPresident of his office.\r\nOn the question of the methods of work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, my delegation welcomes the idea of\r\nhaving some of the interconnected and cross-cutting\r\nagenda items debated jointly, and agenda items\r\nbiennialized or triennialized. We should be more\r\ncircumspect, however, in promoting joint debate on\r\nitems that are considered critical, such as those we are\r\ndealing with today. We would not do justice to many of\r\nthese items by having them debated jointly, with a\r\nseven-minute time limit per speaker — especially if\r\nthose items generate wide interest and warrant specific\r\nand focused discussion with a view the adoption of\r\nimportant decisions. Having such items jointly debated\r\nmay not necessarily enhance the effectiveness of the\r\nwork of the General Assembly. What is required is\r\nwide and deep interest in those items and in the\r\nadoption of appropriate resolutions and decisions by\r\nthe General Assembly relating to them.\r\nMy delegation is supportive of the idea that the\r\nprogramme of work of the General Assembly be\r\nscheduled for the whole 12-month duration of each\r\nsession, rather than concentrating it into the period\r\nSeptember to December, as is the current practice. To\r\nrestore its central position as the chief deliberative,\r\npolicy-making and universally representative organ of\r\nthe United Nations, the General Assembly could revise\r\nits current programme of work to allow for greater\r\nparticipation by all delegations, in particular the\r\nsmaller delegations from the developing countries.\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nInstead of having one regular session, the General\r\nAssembly could be convened in two or three regular\r\nsessions throughout the year. Such an undertaking\r\ncould result in a more manageable General Assembly,\r\nincluding with regard to the work of the Main\r\nCommittees, thereby increasing and enhancing its\r\neffectiveness and efficiency. In addition, Member\r\nStates with limited human and financial resources\r\nwould be able to participate and contribute more\r\nactively and meaningfully. Such States, most of which\r\nare from the developing and least developed countries,\r\nare equally important stakeholders in the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. They should be able to participate\r\nmeaningfully and democratically in deliberations and\r\nthe adoption of decisions on a majority of the\r\nAssembly’s agenda items which are of direct and\r\nimmediate concern and interest to them.\r\nIt appears that over the years the Main\r\nCommittees have successfully transformed themselves,\r\nin a gradual manner, into individual entities in their\r\nown right — each with its own deep-rooted corporate\r\nculture and tradition. In certain instances, unwritten\r\ncustoms and traditions appear to take precedence over\r\nthe rules of procedure of the General Assembly in the\r\nwork of some Committees. In the interests of\r\npreserving the role, status and prestige of the General\r\nAssembly as a whole, in accordance with the relevant\r\nArticles of the Charter, such a development must not be\r\nallowed to continue. Any work done to revitalize the\r\nCommittees should not be a piecemeal effort. It must\r\nbe part of the comprehensive exercise which we are\r\nnow undertaking.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to\r\nreassure the President of our continued readiness to\r\nsupport him and cooperate with him, as well as with\r\nother delegations, in bringing about the much needed\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. My delegation\r\nis optimistic that under his able and proven leadership,\r\nwe will be able to achieve our objective within a clear\r\ntime frame. We count on his leadership and on the\r\npolitical will of all Member States to enable us to\r\nachieve the desired results.\r\nMr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nGuatemala aligns itself fully with the statements of the\r\nrepresentatives of Morocco, Algeria and Peru, who\r\nspoke, respectively, on behalf of the Group of 77, the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Rio Group. We need\r\nnot repeat what has already been said, and will\r\naccordingly restrict ourselves to one aspect that, in our\r\njudgement, has been insufficiently explored. I am\r\nreferring to the formal and informal links that exist\r\nbetween the three main intergovernmental organs\r\nestablished by the Charter. In this regard, it would\r\nprobably be best to consider the three agenda items\r\nwith which we are dealing at today’s meeting in an\r\nintegrated manner.\r\nIndeed, our debate would gain much if, instead of\r\nexamining the revitalization of the General Assembly\r\non the one hand and the reform of the United Nations\r\non the other, we were to approach the consideration of\r\nthe issue in a systemic manner. Much of the criticism\r\nlevelled at the General Assembly springs from the\r\nweaknesses in the way in which this body interacts\r\nwith the Security Council. In the same vein, overlap\r\nand duplication between the work of the Second\r\nCommittee and the Economic and Social Council have\r\nbeen the subject of frequent comment in this Hall.\r\nIn this regard, we applaud the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s appeal, on 23 September, for us to adapt the\r\nUnited Nations to the new circumstances being faced\r\nby humanity. The core of such reform is undoubtedly\r\nthe transformations to be made to the Organization’s\r\nsystem of governance, including the General Assembly,\r\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil.\r\nWhile the panel of eminent personalities to be\r\nappointed by the Secretary-General prepares its report\r\nfor our consideration at the fifty-ninth session, there\r\nare some concrete steps that we can take to move in the\r\ndirection that the report will most likely point. We\r\nalready have some clear, though partial, hints from the\r\nreports submitted by the Secretary-General, including\r\nhis original proposal contained in document\r\nA/57/387 — which, however, avoids the\r\nintergovernmental aspects — and the reports contained\r\nin documents A/58/351, A/58/382 and A/58/395, which\r\nwe welcome.\r\nOn the other hand, we are not starting from zero.\r\nWe should recall Assembly resolution 57/300, as many\r\npreceding speakers have done. Also on the issue of the\r\nreform of the budgetary programming process, we have\r\nthe valuable report of the Joint Inspection Unit,\r\ncontained in document JIU/REP/2003/2.\r\nIn that context — and recalling my original\r\ncomment that we need to reflect more thoroughly on\r\nthe links between the different organs — there is no\r\ndoubt that the preparation and execution of the budget,\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nwhich is the prerogative of the General Assembly, is\r\nthe single most important instrument for carrying out\r\nthe mandate contained in the Millennium Declaration:\r\n“To reaffirm the central position of the\r\nGeneral Assembly as the chief deliberative,\r\npolicy-making and representative organ of the\r\nUnited Nations ...” (resolution 55/2, para. 30).\r\nIn what other areas can we promote progress on\r\nthe revitalization not only of the General Assembly but\r\nalso of the other organs? I would like to cite several\r\nexamples that, in our view, point in the right direction.\r\nFirst, the General Assembly took an important\r\nstep in adopting resolution 57/270 B on the integrated\r\nand coordinated implementation of and follow-up to\r\nthe outcomes of the major United Nations conferences\r\nand summits in the economic and social fields. It is\r\nimportant not only because of its substantive content\r\nbut also because it offers an interesting mechanism for\r\ncooperation on this crucial issue between the General\r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council.\r\nSomething similar can be said about the follow-\r\nup activities of the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development. As will be recalled,\r\nparagraph 69 of the Monterrey Consensus entrusts very\r\nconcrete and mutually supportive roles to the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the General\r\nAssembly. This very same week, we are holding the\r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Financing for Development,\r\nwhich builds on both the Secretary-General’s report\r\nand the results of the 14 April meeting of the Economic\r\nand Social Council, the Bretton-Woods institutions and\r\nthe World Trade Organization. Only the activities of\r\nthe follow-up to conferences, in particular the\r\nMonterrey Consensus, offer the possibility of\r\nrapprochement between those two principal organs in\r\nvery concrete activities and, consequently, in the\r\nrevitalization of the Organization.\r\nSimilarly, there has recently been progress in\r\ndefining a shared working relationship between the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Security Council\r\non the issue of reconstruction and development in\r\ncountries emerging from conflict. The creation of the\r\nAd Hoc Advisory Group on African Countries\r\nEmerging from Conflict has permitted a shared effort\r\nbetween the two Councils on the question of Guinea-\r\nBissau. It is hoped that this will also take place in the\r\ncase of Burundi.\r\nOn the other hand, it is more difficult to\r\ndetermine the tasks to be shared between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council, despite the fact\r\nthat the Assembly elects the non-permanent members\r\nof the Council and that Article 24 of the Charter clearly\r\nstates that the Council acts on behalf of the Members\r\nof the General Assembly. But therein lies precisely one\r\nof the lacunae that the President of the General\r\nAssembly tried to address with the lucid proposals\r\ncontained in his informal note circulated on 15\r\nOctober, which served as the basis for our informal\r\nconsultations of 17 October. We sincerely thank him\r\nfor that. We believe that the steps already taken by the\r\nPresident, as well as the proposals he has now made,\r\ndeserve our recognition.\r\nMr. Cunningham (United States of America): I\r\nam pleased to address the General Assembly today on\r\nthe critical topic of strengthening the United Nations. I\r\njoin others in thanking the Secretary-General and\r\nDeputy Secretary-General Fréchette for their efforts to\r\npursue and implement reform of the United Nations.\r\nWe also wish to offer our appreciation to President\r\nHunte for taking the initiative on this urgent issue and\r\nfor his summary of the open-ended informal\r\nconsultations of the plenary on the revitalization of the\r\nwork of the General Assembly.\r\nThe world’s leaders created the United Nations 58\r\nyears ago out of the ashes of world war. By building on\r\nthe lessons of the past, the United Nations has become\r\nthe central multilateral institution of international\r\nrelations. Now, a new age calls for the United Nations\r\nto assume new obligations and responsibilities.\r\nHowever, like the Headquarters building itself,\r\nrenovations will be needed to make this institution and\r\nits operations a modern and effective Organization that\r\ncan fulfil its mandates in the twenty-first century,\r\nespecially implementation of the Monterrey Consensus.\r\nWe think the place to begin is with principles,\r\nsince reform for the sake of change alone is to take\r\naction without a context or framework for our work.\r\nWe believe there are seven principles that should guide\r\nour reform work.\r\nThe first principle is responsibility. Since\r\n11 September 2001 we have urged every country to\r\nconsider the future of our world if terrorism and\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction continue\r\nunabated. Every nation needs to fulfil its inherent\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nresponsibility as a member of the international\r\ncommunity to stop these global dangers.\r\nThe second principle is accountability, which\r\nmeans that membership in United Nations bodies,\r\nespecially the Security Council, should go to those that\r\nshoulder the burdens. Those nations with fiscal\r\nresponsibility should have a greater say in establishing\r\nprogrammes and budget priorities.\r\nA third principle is effectiveness. We need to\r\nconsolidate and rationalize both the structure of the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat and the intergovernmental\r\nprocess, with its maze of committees, agencies,\r\nconferences, programmes and commissions.\r\nA fourth principle entails the stewardship of\r\nfinancial resources. The intended beneficiaries of\r\nUnited Nations programmes must in fact benefit from\r\nthem. Poorly performing agencies or programmes\r\nshould improve or be ended, thus freeing up resources\r\nto be better spent on helping those in need.\r\nThe fifth principle is modernization. Nations in\r\nthe United Nations caucus by region to establish\r\ncandidacies. As the European Union expands, the\r\ncomposition of the West European and other States\r\ngroup and the East European group will change.\r\nRegional groups may need to realign, but they will also\r\nneed to respect the principle of accountability when\r\nproposing candidates for the Commission on Human\r\nRights or the Security Council, among others.\r\nThe sixth principle is credibility. Members of all\r\nUnited Nations bodies should reflect the purposes of\r\nthose bodies. Sanctions should count. States subject to\r\nthem should not be eligible to serve on the Security\r\nCouncil just as human rights abusers should not sit on\r\nthe Human Rights Commission.\r\nFinally, the seventh and perhaps most important\r\nprinciple is freedom. Advancing freedom should infuse\r\neverything the United Nations does, for liberty is\r\nessential to every significant human endeavour. United\r\nNations programmes should be designed to help\r\nindividuals secure their political and civil rights,\r\npromote the Monterrey Consensus, extend the rule of\r\nlaw and provide the benefits of economic freedom,\r\ngood governance and democracy.\r\nBearing these principles in mind, we welcome the\r\nSecretary-General’s call for a panel of eminent persons\r\nto make reform recommendations from outside the\r\nOrganization, thereby bypassing the restraints that have\r\nmade change from within more difficult. While there\r\nhave been similar efforts in the past, such as the\r\n1986 eminent persons report to the forty-ninth General\r\nAssembly, there are three new factors that make this\r\neffort more compelling now than at any time\r\nsince 1945.\r\nThe first factor is this Secretary-General’s\r\npersonal commitment to reform and reinvigorate the\r\nOrganization to meet the rapidly changing\r\ncircumstances and challenges of our times. Second is\r\nthe broad-based recognition among Member States that\r\nthe United Nations as an institution has vastly\r\nexpanded its scope, range and volume of work over the\r\npast decade and that the current intergovernmental\r\nmachinery and procedures are not able to respond\r\nquickly and effectively to the new and demanding\r\nissues before us. And third is the clear-cut\r\ndetermination of Member States to address the lack of\r\ncoordination among all of its activities as an\r\nindispensable step to reforming the United Nations\r\noverly complex structure, processes and\r\nintergovernmental machinery.\r\nAny effort to reform the United Nations should\r\ntake a comprehensive look at the Security Council, the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and the relationships among them. The\r\nSecretary-General made clear in his speech on\r\n23 September to this Assembly that a rebalancing\r\namong the United Nations pillar institutions is needed\r\nto keep them vital and effective. We agree in terms of\r\nre-evaluating the agendas of the Security Council,\r\nGeneral Assembly, and Economic and Social Council\r\nto bring them in line with the purposes and principles\r\nascribed to them in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nWhile we await the panel of eminent persons’\r\nproposals on Security Council reform, we can act now\r\nto implement some practical steps by adopting best\r\npractices that would sharpen the Security Council’s\r\nagenda and consequently reduce the number of its\r\nmeetings and possibly the number of its resolutions.\r\nWe all agree the General Assembly needs to be\r\nreformed and revitalized. But we think practical steps\r\ncan be taken now to improve its work as well. For\r\nexample, on the agenda, we call for expediting the\r\nclustering of issues, bi-annualizing and tri-annualizing\r\nitems and most importantly, giving the General\r\nCommittee and the President of the General Assembly\r\ngreater authority to propose termination of agenda\r\nitems. We also agree with some suggestions that the\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nGeneral Committee could and should function as a\r\nbureau for the General Assembly.\r\nWe believe the General Assembly should become\r\nless of a speech-making body and more of an\r\ninteractive and deliberative forum.\r\nWe also believe that incorporating the practice of\r\nthe International Labour Organization — which adopts\r\nresolutions with only action-oriented operational\r\nparagraphs and no preambular paragraphs — would\r\nsave considerable time, energy and resources.\r\nOverall, we should harmonize the culture and\r\nworking methods of all six Main Committees of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to avoid duplication and overlap.\r\nIn the First Committee, the United States has put\r\nforward an improvement initiative to infuse new\r\napproaches and working methods in the Committee that\r\nreflect the challenges of our times and cast aside the\r\nold cold war disarmament agenda.\r\nIn the Second Committee, the United States has\r\nalso proposed reforms to bring the vision and\r\ncommitments of the Millennium Summit, the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment into the programme of work.\r\nSince the Economic and Social Council, as\r\ncurrently constituted, neither effectively oversees its\r\nsubordinate institutions nor monitors implementation\r\nof its own resolutions, it too needs fundamental reform.\r\nFinally, I want to say a word on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s considerable efforts to address the United\r\nNations budgetary process in his recent reform\r\nproposal. We support his efforts to streamline and\r\nintegrate this process, which would alter the working\r\nrelationships of the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination, the Advisory Committee on\r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions, and the Fifth\r\nCommittee. While we believe the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination should be eliminated, we\r\nare prepared to discuss the idea of making it the lead\r\nbody to conduct monitoring and evaluation of\r\nprogrammes, the Advisory Committee on\r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions the primary\r\nbody to review details of the budget — and to consider\r\nstrengthening its role and scope in the budgetary\r\nprocess — and the Fifth Committee an oversight body\r\nthat would review the broad policy aspects of the\r\nSecretary-General’s biennial budgets.\r\nJust as we advocated and are working towards\r\nresults-based budgeting, we also call for results-based\r\nmanagement. We offered strong support for General\r\nAssembly resolution 57/300, which calls for\r\nimplementing the Secretary-General’s 2002 reform\r\nagenda, including important Secretariat reforms in\r\nhuman resources management. We also believe that the\r\nSecretary-General’s new report on implementation of\r\nthat resolution offers a clear-eyed assessment of the\r\nway forward in fulfilling these measures. In that\r\nregard, we urge Member States to consider giving the\r\nSecretary-General greater authority to move a fixed\r\npercentage of resources and posts among departments,\r\nthe same executive authority that any minister or\r\npresident must have to manage the administrative\r\nresources of the Governments they lead. This also\r\nmeans that the Secretary-General needs to recommend\r\na far greater number of programmes and activities to\r\neliminate under financial rule 5.6 than the 912 outputs\r\nproposed for 2004-2005, out of a total of more than\r\n40,000 outputs in the regular budget.\r\nIf we are to reform and revitalize the General\r\nAssembly and its subordinate institutions, we also need\r\nto consider the number of resolutions we adopt and the\r\nway we adopt them in this and other bodies of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. For example, there are 22\r\nresolutions on the agenda that deal with the Middle\r\nEast and Israel and additional resolutions from\r\nemergency special sessions that are becoming\r\nincreasingly routine. We vote on each and every one\r\nbecause we cannot achieve a consensus in this chamber\r\non any of them. We have often stated here and\r\nelsewhere in the United Nations that neither the\r\nSecurity Council nor the General Assembly should take\r\npositions that predetermine the outcome of peace\r\nefforts, or even worse, harm their prospects with one-\r\nsided and uneven measures.\r\nWe strongly believe that the lack of reform, not\r\nthe pursuit of reform, will harm the United Nations. If\r\nwe do not act quickly, with determination and\r\ningenuity, we will squander the opportunity to make\r\nthis Organization better. We must do it for the sake of\r\nthose in need today, but even more importantly, we\r\nmust do it for the sake of those who will need this\r\nOrganization’s help tomorrow. It will not be easy or\r\nsimple. But it will be our enduring legacy, if we\r\nsucceed in making the United Nations a more effective\r\nand dynamic institution that one day may come close to\r\nfulfilling the goals for which it was created.\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nMr. Staehelin (Switzerland) (spoke in French):\r\nRecent developments in the international situation have\r\nshown us that when it comes to certain problems, our\r\nOrganization’s Member States hold differing views and\r\ndo not adopt the same approach in resolving those\r\nissues. In the multilateral context, the role of the\r\nUnited Nations, which is the only truly universal\r\nforum, remains crucial. However, it has become clear\r\nthat in order to fully assume its role, the Organization\r\nmust rapidly adapt itself to the international\r\nenvironment of the beginning of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. The need for reform is more pressing than\r\never.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nSwitzerland warmly welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s initiative of creating a high-level panel of\r\neminent personalities to examine how to adapt the\r\nOrganization to the new reality of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. This requires an innovative spirit and the\r\ncourage to explore new paths. For our part, we would\r\nlike to see a regular dialogue established between\r\nMember States and the panel.\r\nWe welcome your efforts and personal\r\ncommitment, Mr. President, to the revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Your informal note of 15 October\r\nand the consultations you have conducted provide an\r\nexcellent basis for our work.\r\nYou, Sir, have identified two clusters. With\r\nrespect to the enhancement of the General Assembly’s\r\nrole and authority, we support the proposal for\r\nstrengthening the Office of the President, enhancing\r\nthe role of the General Assembly’s General Committee\r\nand improving the functioning of the Main\r\nCommittees.\r\nWith respect to improving the General\r\nAssembly’s working methods, my delegation supports\r\nthe vast majority of your suggestions, Mr. President.\r\nOne particularly interesting idea that you mentioned is\r\nto redistribute the Assembly’s work over the entire\r\none-year duration of the session. Furthermore,\r\nreflection on a code of conduct, which would separate\r\nthe flow of statements and the draft resolutions into\r\ngroups, could be a first step towards reducing our\r\noverburdened agenda. In brief, the concrete\r\nimplementation of those proposals will require greater\r\nself-discipline on the part of Member States and the\r\nrenunciation of narrow special interests for the sake of\r\nthe greater good.\r\nWe welcome the Deputy Secretary-General’s\r\nstatement this morning on progress on the reform\r\nmeasures proposed by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport of last year entitled “Strengthening of the United\r\nNations: an agenda for further change”, endorsed by\r\nresolution 57/300. Nevertheless, we believe that further\r\ncommon efforts must be undertaken to implement the\r\nreport.\r\nI shall limit myself to two observations on this\r\nissue. First, Switzerland supports the strengthening of\r\nthe application of human rights treaties. It finds the\r\nidea of a consolidated report to be of particular\r\ninterest; such a report would provide a better overall\r\npicture of the implementation of our legal obligations\r\non this issue. Furthermore, we deem it essential that the\r\nUnited Nations regular budget provide sufficient\r\nresources for the Office of the High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights to cover the costs incurred by the\r\nvarious bodies monitoring the treaties and the special\r\nprocedures of the Commission for Human Rights.\r\nSecondly, we support the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendations to streamline and lighten the\r\nOrganization’s planning and budgeting process. The\r\nproposed strategic framework, consisting of a two-year\r\nmedium-term plan in conjunction with an adapted,\r\nmore operational budgetary outline will make for a\r\nmore coherent and strategic cycle. We believe it is\r\nnecessary and important to establish a clear and logical\r\nlink between the medium-term plan — which should be\r\nmade a genuine plan of action — and the budget\r\noutline. That measure would, we hope, more closely\r\nlink political priorities and budgetary planning.\r\nReforming the planning and budgeting cycle\r\nshould also include the review of the tasks of the\r\nvarious bodies involved, such as the Advisory\r\nCommittee on Administrative and Budgetary\r\nQuestions, the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination and the Fifth Committee of the General\r\nAssembly. With our increasingly burdened agendas, we\r\ncannot afford to permit several committees to take up\r\nthe same question without clearly contributing added\r\nvalue.\r\nIt has been 13 years since the debate on United\r\nNations reform was launched. It is time to move\r\nforward with more thorough changes. We must take\r\nadvantage of our current momentum and show the\r\nrequired political will.\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nMr. Talbot (Guyana): I am grateful for the\r\nopportunity to share some reflections on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of Guyana in the joint debate on agenda\r\nitems 55, 57, 58 and 59. In so doing, I associate my\r\ndelegation fully with the statements made by the\r\nrepresentatives of Algeria, Morocco and Suriname,\r\nspeaking respectively on behalf of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, the Group of 77 and China and the\r\nCaribbean Community.\r\nGuyana joins in the support expressed for your\r\nefforts, Mr. President, to advance the process of\r\nrevitalizing the Assembly. We welcome the initiative\r\nyou have taken to implement those decisions of the\r\nAssembly which it is possible to advance at this time\r\nand your commitment and determination to develop, in\r\nconsultation with Member States, proposals leading to\r\nthe further revitalization of the Assembly.\r\nThe framework for action that you, Sir, have\r\nelaborated provides a sound basis for our work.\r\nConsideration of the revitalization issue has been\r\nconveniently grouped into two clusters: enhancing the\r\nrole and authority of the General Assembly and\r\nimproving its working methods. We support that\r\nframework.\r\nIn reviewing the process so far, we note that the\r\nquestion of the revitalization of the General Assembly\r\nhas been on the agenda of this body for at least the past\r\n13 years. The related questions concerning the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations system —\r\nmeasures for the restructuring and revitalization of the\r\nUnited Nations in the economic, social and related\r\nfields and United Nations reform — have also engaged\r\nour attention over the past decade. There can be little\r\ndoubt that, as a result of those efforts, progress has\r\nbeen made in enhancing the efficiency and functioning\r\nof the Organization and in improving the working\r\nmethods of its principal organs.\r\nWith respect to the General Assembly itself, more\r\nthan 15 resolutions and decisions have been adopted\r\nwhose primary aim is rationalizing its work and\r\nimproving its procedures. In spite of those\r\ndevelopments, the Assembly still struggles to answer\r\nthe charge that it is failing to fulfil the mandate\r\nenvisaged for it in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThat is the central challenge facing the revitalization\r\nprocess.\r\nThe ultimate test of our success in meeting this\r\nchallenge lies not in how well the Assembly works\r\ninternally, but rather in whether it makes a difference in\r\nthe world commensurate with its role under the Charter\r\nand with the vision of our leaders, who called in the\r\nMillennium Declaration for the restoration of the\r\nAssembly as the chief deliberative, policy-making and\r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations. Of course\r\nthose two things are not unrelated. However, as the\r\nexperience of the past 13 years shows, the attention to\r\nrationalization and improvement of working methods\r\nhas not necessarily led to an enhancement of the role\r\nand the authority of the Assembly. My delegation\r\ntherefore holds the view that the Assembly must now\r\nmake simultaneous, concerted efforts under both of the\r\nclusters that you have identified, Mr. President. And\r\nwe are encouraged to believe that, with good will on all\r\nsides, this is an undertaking well within our grasp.\r\nLet me now suggest, from the perspective of the\r\nGuyana delegation, some of the possible areas where\r\nprogress can be made during the current session. In this\r\nregard, Sir, I will focus my remarks within the\r\nframework of the two broad areas that you have set out.\r\nIn respect of efforts to enhance the authority and\r\nrole of the General Assembly, I wish to highlight the\r\nfollowing points. First, strengthening the role and the\r\nOffice of the President should be integral to the process\r\nof revitalization. My country, having once held the\r\npresidency of the Assembly, supports efforts to\r\nstrengthen the role and Office of the President,\r\nincluding by making available to it the permanent\r\nsupport of a modest cadre of professionals.\r\nSecondly, my delegation supports efforts to\r\nenhance the visibility of the General Assembly. The\r\nglobal perception of the Assembly and of its relevance\r\nis determined in large measure by the media attention it\r\nreceives. We support the initiative for more active\r\nengagement by the Department of Public Information\r\nin promoting the work of the Assembly in this domain.\r\nEqually important is the attention that needs to be paid\r\nto enhancing the substantive content of the Assembly’s\r\ndeliberations as well as the quality of its outcomes.\r\nThirdly, in our view, the relationship among the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council is critical in any effort to\r\nstrengthen the Organization as a whole. With regard to\r\nthe relationship between the Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil in particular, some have voiced concern over\r\nwhat appears to be an encroachment on the part of the\r\nCouncil on areas deemed to be within the purview of\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nthe Assembly. Others have attributed this to the\r\ninability of the Assembly to address some of the\r\nmatters on its agenda. Guyana believes that any\r\ntendency towards a culture of competition between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council is to be\r\navoided. We therefore will encourage the Assembly\r\nand its President to consider ways of further fostering\r\ngreater cooperation between the two bodies. Here, the\r\nconsideration by the Assembly of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council provides a basis for more meaningful\r\ninteraction between these two organs in accordance\r\nwith the Charter and relevant resolutions of the\r\nAssembly.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nGuyana aligns itself with the Rio Group on the\r\nnecessity of implementing what has been agreed in\r\nAssembly resolutions concerning the assessment to be\r\nmade by the President of the General Assembly on the\r\ndebate in plenary meeting on the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization and\r\nthe report of the Security Council.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe welcome the steps that you, Mr. President, have\r\ntaken in that regard.\r\nFourthly, implementation of the resolutions and\r\ndecisions of the General Assembly must be a key\r\nobjective of the revitalization of the Assembly. This\r\npresupposes necessary attention to the quality of\r\ndecisions adopted by the Assembly, including whether\r\nthey can, in fact, be implemented. The Assembly may\r\nwish to mandate a periodic review of the\r\nimplementation of its decisions with a view to\r\nidentifying the problems that hinder implementation.\r\nTurning to the second cluster of issues, my\r\ndelegation remains committed to efforts to rationalize\r\nthe agenda of the Assembly and to improve its working\r\nmethods. We are similarly committed to this exercise in\r\nrespect of the Main Committees of the Assembly, with\r\na view to enhancing the overall effectiveness of the\r\nAssembly’s work. In this context, we wish to make the\r\nfollowing points.\r\nFirst, we can support the proposal to programme\r\nthe consideration of items on the Assembly’s agenda\r\nover the full year of the session, providing it leads to a\r\nrationalization rather than a mere multiplication of the\r\nwork done over the period from September to\r\nDecember. The Secretariat may assist us with one or\r\nmore scenarios of how such a session could work.\r\nSecondly, regarding the prioritization of items for\r\nspecial attention, my delegation supports the focusing\r\nof efforts, where possible, on issues of global concern.\r\nWe share the view that plenary meetings could be\r\nbetter utilized by focusing on global priorities of the\r\nday. We look forward to further clarification of the\r\ncriteria and modalities to be applied in selecting items\r\nfor special attention.\r\nThirdly, concerning the involvement of external\r\nactors, Guyana remains supportive of efforts to involve\r\nthe wider community, including civil society, in the\r\nwork of the United Nations, and we encourage further\r\nefforts in this regard.\r\nFourthly, in respect of the role of the General\r\nCommittee, we support the formalization of the new\r\narrangements introduced by the President of the\r\nAssembly at the beginning of the fifty-eighth session.\r\nIn sharing these brief reflections at this stage of\r\nour deliberations, I wish to close, Mr. President, by\r\nonce again commending you for the initiative and\r\ndetermination you have shown on this question. You\r\nand all the members of the Assembly may be assured\r\nof the continued support and cooperation of the\r\ndelegation of Guyana.\r\nMr. Ayari (Tunisia) (spoke in French): Tunisia is\r\npleased to participate in the important debate that\r\nbrings us together today and to make its contribution to\r\ninternational efforts to enhance United Nations action\r\nand its performance in the context of the noble\r\nprinciples upon which it is based. We welcome the\r\npersonal commitment of the Secretary-General and\r\nyour determination, Mr. President, as well as the\r\ncommitment of all Member States to strengthen the\r\nrole of the United Nations and its principal organs —\r\nin particular the consolidation of the role and\r\ncredibility of the Security Council in the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security and the\r\nrevitalization and consolidation of the role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in the service of peace, security and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nToday, accelerating reform implementation is\r\nmore necessary than ever in view of the number of\r\nchallenges we all face and the need to find more viable\r\nand lasting solutions to problems related to peace,\r\nsecurity and development, which daily confront the\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nentire international community. Today’s discussion is\r\ntherefore of particular importance and should enable us\r\nto think in more depth about new approaches which\r\nwill let us regain the spirit of multilateralism that\r\ncharacterized the Millennium Summit.\r\nMy delegation completely endorses the\r\nstatements made by the representative of Morocco on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China and by the\r\nrepresentative of Algeria speaking on behalf of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement. We would like to emphasize,\r\nhowever, a few points we believe deserve particular\r\nattention.\r\nReform is a comprehensive undertaking that must\r\ninvolve all structures of the United Nations, as the\r\nSecretary-General observed in his report on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration\r\n(A/58/323) and in his speech to the Assembly (see\r\nA/58/PV.7), in which he said that the time had come for\r\nradical reform and asked Member States to delay no\r\nlonger in instituting reforms envisaged for the Security\r\nCouncil, the General Assembly, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and the Trusteeship Council. We\r\nsupport the proposals put forward by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report as well, Mr. President, as the ones\r\nin your non-paper. We give particular support to the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal to establish a panel of\r\neminent personalities to advance the reforms. We feel it\r\nis essential that the choice of those personalities reflect\r\nthe broadest possible geographical representation and\r\nrespond to the indispensable prerequisite of neutrality.\r\nWe would also like to emphasize that no reform\r\nmay be considered without being submitted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly for its prior approval. Moreover, the\r\nreforms should be fundamental in nature and in\r\nkeeping with the principles of the Charter; they should\r\ngive greater weight to the action of our Organization\r\nand its decisions and recommendations than to\r\neconomizing or to placing unjustified pressure on the\r\nagendas of the General Assembly and the other\r\nprincipal organs.\r\nThe envisaged reform must confirm our shared\r\ncommitment to promote effective multilateralism\r\nwhich will make it possible to resolve world political\r\nproblems in a more just and equitable manner, thereby\r\nensuring the advent of an economic and social order in\r\nwhich all countries can live in security and dignity and\r\nenjoy the benefits of globalization.\r\nWe would like to reiterate in particular how\r\nimportant it is to make the Security Council more\r\ndemocratic, as it is the principal organ entrusted with\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. No\r\nreform of the Organization will be complete until the\r\nmembership of the Security Council is reconfigured, its\r\nefficiency and credibility are enhanced and its working\r\nmethods and decision-making processes are improved.\r\nWith regard to the right of veto, my delegation supports\r\nthe position of the Non-Aligned Movement on\r\nrestricting the use of the veto to action undertaken\r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter. It goes without\r\nsaying that a positive and constructive attitude on the\r\npart of the permanent members of the Security Council\r\ntowards this issue will be essential.\r\nThe General Assembly is the Organization’s most\r\nuniversal organ. It must remain the central forum for\r\ndeliberations and decisions on political questions as\r\nwell as on economic, social and humanitarian issues.\r\nWe emphasize the importance of helping the General\r\nAssembly regain its full powers and attributes as\r\nrecognized in the Charter. It is certainly true that since\r\na few years ago the General Assembly has become a\r\nmore deliberative forum, and that the debates that take\r\nplace there generate insufficient interest outside of its\r\nconfines. My delegation supports the proposed reforms\r\nin the area of rationalizing the programme of work of\r\nthe General Assembly and its Main Committees and\r\nstructuring these around the Millennium Development\r\nGoals and the results of the Monterrey Conference and\r\nthe Johannesburg Summit.\r\nMy delegation equally supports the principle of\r\nclustering certain agenda items and the submission of\r\nconsolidated reports on related issues. Biennialization\r\nor triennialization of items should be carried out only\r\non a case-by-case basis, taking into account the nature\r\nof those items and the aims sought. The Department of\r\nPublic Information must obviously play a more\r\nimportant role in conveying the activities,\r\nrecommendations and decisions of the General\r\nAssembly through the media. We also support the\r\nstrengthening of the Office of the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in order to enable the President to\r\ncarry out the reform process.\r\nThe proposal to consider General Assembly\r\nagenda items throughout the year seems to be of\r\ninterest and should be given some thought. Spreading\r\nout the work of the General Assembly in this manner\r\nwould permit those delegations with limited human\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nresources to participate more actively in the work of\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nWe attach particular importance to the role of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and its impact. We\r\nwelcome the emphasis placed on the necessity of\r\nstrengthening that strategic organ mandated to promote\r\ncoordination and to ensure consistent policies and\r\nintegrated and coordinated implementation of and\r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations\r\nconferences in the economic and social fields. We also\r\nsupport efforts to intensify partnerships and\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the private\r\nsector and civil society. We also call for strengthened\r\nrelations between the Economic and Social Council\r\nand the Bretton Woods institutions.\r\nWe support the recommendations put forward in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report contained in document\r\nA/58/395 and entitled “Strengthening of the United\r\nNations: an agenda for further change”.\r\nMy delegation believes no United Nations reform\r\ncan be successful without widespread political will.\r\nThis is even truer for the General Assembly to which\r\nwe are dedicated and to the implementation of whose\r\ndecisions and recommendations we must all commit\r\nourselves in good faith.\r\nFinally, we would like to stress the importance of\r\navoiding reform being motivated only by budgetary\r\nreasons. We favour the gradual introduction and\r\nsystematic evaluation of reforms. The proposed\r\nchanges and reforms must respond to the objectives of\r\ntransparency and equity and should not ever weaken\r\nthe negotiating capabilities of any group of countries or\r\nlimit basic documentation or the prerogatives and\r\nmeans available to the Secretariat as it works to\r\npromote development.\r\nMr. Sychov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The\r\ndelegation of the Republic of Belarus views with great\r\ninterest the present format of jointly discussing four\r\nreformulated agenda items. In our view, this practice\r\nwill enable us to consider the theme in a\r\ncomprehensive and integral manner which should\r\nultimately help us to adopt balanced decisions with a\r\nview to implementing specific measures and proposals.\r\nDebates on reform of the United Nations have\r\nbeen under way for more than a decade. Our common\r\nstarting point was an understanding that the United\r\nNations was lagging behind world events and was\r\nbecoming less able to address the new realities. The\r\nlack of significant progress on reform of the\r\nOrganization over the past decade led to a further\r\ndecline of the international authority of the United\r\nNations and its credibility among Member States. As a\r\nresult, some countries have chosen to sidestep the\r\nUnited Nations and act unilaterally in solving matters\r\nof international concern. This state of affairs\r\nundermines the established system of international\r\nrelations and international law and makes the world\r\nless secure. In this regard, the issue of reform of the\r\nUnited Nations is becoming especially acute today.\r\nThe situation of United Nations reform largely\r\nreflects the existing balance of power in the world.\r\nReform of the Security Council, which is a key element\r\nof United Nations reform, might serve as a vivid\r\nexample. The Republic of Belarus does not doubt the\r\nneed to redress the imbalance in regional\r\nrepresentation on the Council, which infringes on the\r\ninterests of developing countries. We believe that\r\nallocation of additional permanent seats to States\r\nrepresenting the three developing regions of Asia,\r\nAfrica and Latin America and the Caribbean is\r\nnecessitated by contemporary geopolitical realities. But\r\nno substantial progress has been made with this issue,\r\nas not all States, primarily the most influential ones,\r\nare ready to take concrete steps to transform the\r\nCouncil. We consider the successful restructuring of\r\nthe Security Council to be very important, since  failure\r\nto reform that organ will give rise to the feeling that it\r\nis impossible to reform the United Nations as a whole.\r\nThe reform of the Organization is connected with\r\nthe strengthening of other United Nations Charter\r\nbodies, first of all the General Assembly. The main\r\nobjective in this area is to enhance the efficiency of the\r\nAssembly’s work. Unfortunately, we have observed the\r\nreverse process of late. We consider this a result of the\r\nincreasing influence of other United Nations entities,\r\nspecifically the Security Council, on matters that fall\r\nunder the jurisdiction of the General Assembly. It also\r\nhappens because the decisions of the General\r\nAssembly on both agenda items and matters related to\r\nimproving its efficiency are not implemented.\r\nIn our view, among the various ideas on the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, particular\r\nattention should be paid to proposals such as\r\nstrengthening of the Assembly’s cooperation with the\r\nSecurity Council and other United Nations bodies,\r\nincreasing the significance of the General Assembly\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\npresidency, improving the consultations of General\r\nAssembly President with regional groups and\r\norganizations and streamlining the methods and\r\nworking practices of the General Assembly.\r\nBelarus supports measures to strengthen the\r\nstatus of General Assembly and to reconsider its\r\nrelationships with other Charter bodies of the United\r\nNations. We should not forget that the General\r\nAssembly is one of the main bodies of the\r\nOrganization, in whose work all Member States take\r\npart and which has the right to adopt decisions on\r\npractically the whole range of United Nations\r\nactivities. We are convinced that it is in the interests of\r\nall countries to have an influential and effective\r\nGeneral Assembly, especially in the context of\r\nimplementing the functions and powers stated in\r\nArticle 10 of the United Nations Charter.\r\nNowadays, there is a widely held belief that not\r\nall States can benefit equally from globalization. The\r\neconomic underdevelopment, poverty, social exposure,\r\nilliteracy and perilous diseases inherent in many\r\nregions of the world are factors that create propitious\r\nbreeding grounds for the emergence of conflicts and\r\nterrorism. It would not be an exaggeration to say that\r\nfurther delay in tackling the whole range of social and\r\neconomic problems endangers international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nIn the past, the United Nations has made not a\r\nsmall contribution to the solution of development-\r\nrelated problems. We have no doubt that the United\r\nNations should continue to play such a leading role. In\r\nthis regard, the Republic of Belarus is profoundly\r\npleased that the United Nations was able to project a\r\nstrategic vision in this area. At the Millennium Summit\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals were set, major\r\ninternational forums under United Nations auspices\r\nhave been held, paths to achieve the goals have been\r\ndefined and broad international attention has been\r\nbrought to persistent problems. The next and most\r\nimportant of all steps is the realization of commitments\r\nundertaken at these conferences and events.\r\nAlthough the primary responsibility in\r\nimplementing development goals rests with the\r\nMember States, all of us are entitled to rely on the\r\nassistance of our Organization. An active and efficient\r\nUnited Nations involvement in dealing with the issues\r\nof development seems improbable without the\r\ntransformation of United Nations social and economic\r\nsectors or without the elaboration and implementation\r\nof new approaches to development.\r\nWe see one such approach deserving of praise in\r\nthe consideration this year of the issue of integrated\r\nand coordinated follow-up to the outcomes of the\r\nMillennium Summit, the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development and the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development by both the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and the General Assembly.\r\nAn important component of the reform of United\r\nNations social and economic sectors is an institutional\r\nrestructuring of relevant entities of the Organization.\r\nWe support efforts to consolidate the Department of\r\nEconomic and Social Affairs (DESA) through the\r\nprovision of the requisite organizational, technical and\r\nstaff capacity. We find interesting and are ready to\r\nconsider the proposal of the Secretary-General, made\r\nin his report on the work of the Organization (A/58/1),\r\nto establish a strategic planning capacity in DESA.\r\nOur delegation shares the opinion, suggested by\r\nsome States during the general debate of the Second\r\nCommittee, on the advisability of streamlining the\r\nwork of the Committee and removing overlapping\r\nelements in its activities.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus attaches great\r\nimportance to economic and social matters in the\r\nUnited Nations. To this end, we decided to present the\r\ncandidacy of our country to the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil at the elections to be held during the current\r\nsession. If elected to the Council, the realization of the\r\nUnited Nations vision on development, strengthening\r\nof the economic and social sector of the Organization\r\nand enhancement of the Economic and Social Council’s\r\nrole and its interaction with Bretton Woods institutions\r\nwould be the areas for our priority action in that body.\r\nI would like to dwell briefly on other reform\r\nmeasures undertaken by the Secretary-General —\r\nefforts to improve United Nations activities in the area\r\nof public information. Belarus expects that the amount\r\nof information products will be expanding and taking\r\ninto consideration regional specifics. This work should\r\nyield an increased interest in United Nations activities\r\non the part of national audiences.\r\nMeasures to engage civil society and the private\r\nsector on a broader basis in the process of United\r\nNations reform certainly deserve attention. We support\r\nmeaningful United Nations cooperation with these\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nstructures. However, we believe that this interaction\r\nshould be organized in such a manner so as not to be\r\ndetrimental to the basic principles of the United\r\nNations as a universal intergovernmental Organization.\r\nOur delegation takes a positive view of the\r\nsuggested measures to improve the Organization’s\r\nplanning and budgeting processes, including the\r\nconsideration of a strategic framework on a biennial\r\nbasis and the enhancement of the role of the Committee\r\nfor Programme and Coordination. We are ready to\r\nsupport the proposed programme budget for the\r\nbiennium 2004-2005 that reflects that reform effort.\r\nWe also take great interest in the Secretary\r\nGeneral’s intention, stated in his speech to this\r\nAssembly on 23 September, to establish a high-level\r\ngroup with a view to elaborating recommendations on\r\nUnited Nations reform. We hope that serious\r\nrecommendations on further transformation of the\r\nUnited Nations, which all of us will be implementing\r\ntogether, will be the result of that group’s work.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to mention that\r\nsuccess in reforming the Organization depends on\r\nMember States themselves. To make our planet a safer\r\nand fairer world, we, the community of nations, must\r\nagree on the future of our Organization. The Republic\r\nof Belarus, being a staunch supporter of a\r\ncomprehensive United Nations reform, is ready for\r\nconstructive cooperation with interested parties on the\r\nwhole package of United Nations reform. We see no\r\nalternatives to the United Nations central role in the\r\nsystem of international relations.\r\nAgenda item 104\r\nFollow-up to the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development:\r\n(b) High-level dialogue for the implementation of\r\nthe outcome of the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development\r\nNote by the Secretariat (A/57/CRP.5)\r\nDraft decision (A/58/L.6)\r\nThe President: On 15 September 2003, a note by\r\nthe secretariat was circulated as document A/57/CRP.5\r\nin English only, containing basic information on\r\nregional and intergovernmental organizations, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and business sector entities\r\napplying for accreditation to the high-level dialogue.\r\nMr. Andrabi (Pakistan): The list of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations that have applied for\r\naccreditation to the high-level dialogue on financing\r\nfor development was included in document A/57/CRP.5\r\nof 9 September 2003. Among them was a non-\r\ngovernmental organization called International Human\r\nRights Observers, Pakistan, which has not been\r\nincluded in the list contained in document A/58/L.6\r\nwhich is before the General Assembly for\r\nconsideration. My delegation would like to inquire\r\nabout the reasons for the non-inclusion of this non-\r\ngovernmental organization in the list before the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe President: In response to the inquiry by the\r\nrepresentative of Pakistan, may I state that document\r\nA/58/L.6 contains a list of non-governmental\r\norganizations which the President has submitted for\r\naccreditation to the High-Level Dialogue on Financing\r\nfor Development.\r\nPursuant to paragraph 15 (b) of General\r\nAssembly resolution 57/250 of 20 December 2002,\r\ninterested non-governmental organizations and\r\nbusiness sector entities that are not in consultative\r\nstatus with the Economic and Social Council or were\r\nnot accredited to the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development shall apply to the General\r\nAssembly for accreditation following the accreditation\r\nprocedure established during the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development.\r\nAs mentioned in a footnote to that resolution, the\r\naccreditation procedure for the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development is set out in\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions 55/245 B and 54/279,\r\nwhich Member States will recall was a no-objection\r\nprocedure.\r\nAs this High-Level Dialogue has neither a bureau\r\nnor a preparatory committee, the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-seventh session was\r\nobliged to provide the necessary information to the\r\nGeneral Assembly directly, which he did in his letter of\r\n7 May and 27 August 2003. In the relevant part, the\r\nPresident’s letter indicated that, in the absence of any\r\nobjection by 8 September 2003, he intended to submit\r\nthe list to the General Assembly for approval. No\r\nMember State disputed the procedure set forth in\r\nPresident Kavan’s letter. The President of the General\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session received a timely\r\nobjection from one Member State in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 57/250. The name of that\r\norganization has been removed from the list.\r\nMr. Andrabi (Pakistan): I wish to thank you,\r\nMr. President, for your explanation. My delegation\r\nwould like to know the name of the delegation and the\r\ngrounds given for the objection.\r\nThe President: The delegation of India objected,\r\nand the grounds for the objection are similar to those\r\ncontained in the document which I circulated to the\r\nAssembly. I do not have a copy with me, but I would\r\nbe quite happy to make this a document of this House.\r\nIn any event, I have been advised that I am not, in\r\nfact, required to divulge that information. But I think\r\nthat, in the interests of transparency, I have\r\ncommunicated to the delegation of Pakistan all the\r\ninformation precedent to the President’s arriving at that\r\nconclusion.\r\nMr. Andrabi (Pakistan): Mr. President, my\r\ndelegation appreciates the transparency with which you\r\nhave conducted the business of the Assembly. We take\r\nnote of the fact that the delegation of India has blocked\r\nthe inclusion of this non-governmental organization\r\n(NGO) for having held a demonstration against India’s\r\nillegal and brutal suppression of the right to self-\r\ndetermination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.\r\nThe non-governmental organization, according to news\r\nreports, had demanded that the United Nations play an\r\neffective role in the resolution of the issue of Kashmir\r\nand for peace in South Asia.\r\nWe are disappointed, but not surprised, since it is\r\nthe longstanding policy of India to stifle those voices\r\nthat question its gross violations of human rights in\r\nKashmir and elsewhere. As a matter of policy, India\r\nbars any international human rights organization from\r\nvisiting Indian-occupied Kashmir or Gujarat, where\r\nlast year the State machinery helped the ruling\r\nBharatiya Janata Party in carrying out the massacre of\r\nthousands of Muslims.\r\nLet me be clear: Kashmir is not a part of India. It\r\nhas never been. Security Council resolution 47 (1948)\r\nand 80 (1950) state categorically that the final\r\ndisposition of the state of Jammu and Kashmir will be\r\nmade in accordance with the will of the people,\r\nexpressed through the democratic method of a free and\r\nimpartial plebiscite conducted under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity recognize it as a disputed territory. The\r\nUnited Nations has a direct responsibility to help the\r\nKashmiri people realize their right to self-\r\ndetermination.\r\nAccording to operative paragraph 15 (b) of\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 57/250, the procedure\r\nadopted for accreditation of non-governmental\r\norganizations at the Monterrey Conference was to be\r\nreplicated for the participation of non-governmental\r\norganizations in the High-Level Dialogue. The\r\nprocedure for the Monterrey Conference, contained in\r\nparagraph 16 of the report of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee (A/AC.257/6) of 23 March 2003, was\r\nadopted by the General Assembly, while resolution\r\n54/279 mandated that, first, the application should be\r\nsubmitted to a committee composed of the Bureau of\r\nthe Preparatory Committee; secondly, that the Bureau,\r\nand not a Member State, would decide, on a no-\r\nobjection basis, regarding the accreditation of those\r\nnon-governmental organizations; and thirdly, that the\r\nBureau would inform only the Preparatory Committee.\r\nThat procedure did not give a Member State the\r\nright of veto. That right was limited to the Bureau of\r\nthe Preparatory Committee, while the general\r\nmembership, that is, the Preparatory Committee, was\r\nonly to be informed.\r\nIn allowing India a veto to block the Pakistani\r\nNGO, a very dangerous precedent has been created.\r\nThis can be used by any Member State in future to\r\nblock the participation of any NGO in the activities of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nMy delegation attaches great importance to the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and its follow-up process. We do not\r\nwant to undermine the high-level dialogue and will\r\ntherefore not challenge the exclusion of that NGO from\r\nthe list.\r\nThe President: I should like to make it clear,\r\nagain in the interests of transparency, that this is a\r\nmatter with respect to which the President ensured that\r\nhe consulted his legal advisers, in the absence of both a\r\npreparatory committee and a bureau, and so the\r\ndecision which was taken on the basis of the objection\r\n29\r\nA/58/PV.44\r\nthat was made was taken with the best legal advice\r\navailable to me as President.\r\nI wanted to make that point, because, as we talk\r\nabout change and as we talk about doing things in a\r\nmore transparent manner, I did not think that I should\r\njust rule this matter off without explaining to the\r\nGeneral Assembly the procedure that was adopted. The\r\ncomments made by the representative of Pakistan have\r\nbeen duly noted.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\ndecision A/58/L.6, entitled “Accreditation of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations to the High-level Dialogue\r\non Financing for Development”.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to adopt draft decision A/58/L.6?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted (decision 58/509).\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has\r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of\r\nsub-item (b) of agenda item 104.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
