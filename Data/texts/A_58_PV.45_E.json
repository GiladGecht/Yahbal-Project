(Saint Lucia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Alsaidi\r\n(Yemen), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda items 55, 57, 58 and 59 (continued)\r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly\r\nUnited Nations reform: measures and proposals\r\nRestructuring and revitalization of the United\r\nNations in the economic, social and related fields\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations system\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/57/786,\r\nA/58/175, A/58/351, A/58/382 and A/58/395 and\r\nCorr.1)\r\nMr. Ngo Duc Thang (Viet Nam): My delegation\r\nwishes to join previous speakers in commending the\r\nSecretary-General for his important and comprehensive\r\nreports on revitalization of the work of the General\r\nAssembly and strengthening of the United Nations\r\nsystem. We highly appreciate the practice of\r\nconsidering those two agenda items in this joint\r\nplenary debate. We particularly welcome the\r\nPresident’s non-paper on the same subjects, presented\r\nat the open-ended consultations held on 17 October. We\r\nbelieve that those documents can serve as a good basis\r\nfor today’s discussion. My delegation would also like\r\nto support the statements made by the representative of\r\nAlgeria, on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\n(NAM) Working Group on Reform of the United\r\nNations and Revitalization of the General Assembly,\r\nand by the representative of Morocco, on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nMy delegation has always attached great\r\nimportance to the ongoing reform process aimed at\r\nfurther strengthening the United Nations and\r\nrevitalizing the work of the General Assembly. In that\r\nspirit, we wish to express our firm support for the\r\nSecretary-General’s call for radical reform, made at the\r\nopening of the general debate, on 23 October. We thank\r\nhim for his tireless efforts devoted to that difficult task.\r\nWe believe that many measures and proposals\r\ncontained in documents A/58/395 and A/58/351\r\ndeserve our careful consideration and endorsement. We\r\nwish also to commend President Hunte for his strong\r\ncommitment in taking the lead in pursuing efforts to\r\nadvance the process of further revitalization of the\r\nwork and agenda of the General Assembly. My\r\ndelegation assures the Assembly of its consistent\r\nsupport and full cooperation in that regard.\r\nHowever, we believe that the United Nations\r\nshould undertake more effective and practical efforts to\r\nearn the confidence and meet the expectations of\r\nnations. That requires a stronger and more\r\ndemocratized United Nations and a Security Council\r\nwith better representation of developing countries and\r\nof countries that have made positive contributions to\r\nour common objectives. We are also of the view that\r\nthe current reform efforts within the Organization must\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nfocus first and foremost on enhancing the General\r\nAssembly’s authority and role as the chief deliberative,\r\npolicy-making and representative body of the United\r\nNations, in conformity with the principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nWe should like to express our serious concern\r\nover the fact that the central role of the General\r\nAssembly has been gradually eroding, with its\r\nlegitimacy being questioned owing to the preference of\r\nsome to work through the Security Council. We all\r\nbelieve that that situation should be resolved. We\r\nwelcome all measures aimed at addressing the problem\r\nof the General Assembly’s relative marginalization,\r\nwhile strengthening the cooperation and effective\r\nrelationships between the Assembly and other principal\r\norgans — particularly the Security Council. The forum\r\nof 191 Member States should be the highest authority\r\nof the United Nations and live up to the expectations of\r\nthe world’s people in responding to all important and\r\nurgent global issues. To that end, we hope that this\r\ndiscussion can help to achieve a breakthrough in our\r\nefforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of\r\nthe most important organ of the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation is of the view that enhancement of\r\nthe General Assembly cannot be complete unless we\r\nrationalize its agenda and improve its working\r\nmethods. Revitalization has been on the Assembly’s\r\nagenda since 1991 and has been strengthened by a\r\nseries of resolutions that have brought about\r\nremarkable achievements with regard to reform of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and of the Organization as a whole.\r\nThe Assembly’s agenda is now more focused on its\r\nsubstantive work, since many of its items have been\r\nregrouped by subject or are considered on a biennial or\r\ntriennial basis.\r\nHowever, there is still room for improvement.\r\nThe president is encouraged to work with the chairs of\r\nthe Main Committees to consider assigning more items\r\nto those Committees in order to preserve General\r\nAssembly plenary meetings as a forum for high-level\r\npolicy statements and for considering agenda items of\r\nspecial political importance and/or urgency. We\r\nwelcome Assembly President Hunte’s initiative in\r\nchanging the format of his monthly encounters with the\r\nchairs of the Main Committees and the Secretariat to\r\nensure a more meaningful exchange of information. In\r\nthat regard, we fully support the enhancement of the\r\npresident’s role and office to enable them to conduct\r\nthe business of the General Assembly more effectively.\r\nMy delegation would like to express its views on\r\nthe suggestions made at the informal consultations. We\r\nsupport the current practice of reserving two weeks for\r\nthe general debate, during which leaders of Member\r\nStates present their statements on global issues, and the\r\ncombining of items that concern more than one\r\nCommittee in a joint debate. We also support the NAM\r\nWorking Group’s proposal that the General Assembly\r\nagenda should be reviewed periodically to consider the\r\npossibility of deleting any item on which no resolution\r\nor decision has been adopted for a certain period of\r\ntime. Assembly resolutions should be short and\r\nfocused, with particular attention given to their\r\nimplementation. In that regard, we commend\r\nPresident Hunte for the framework of actions contained\r\nin his non-paper, and we welcome all initiatives and\r\nproposals made by other delegations to improve the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s capacity to respond effectively to\r\nthe challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nWe share the view of the Secretary-General,\r\nexpressed in his report contained in document\r\nA/58/395, that a strategic framework should be\r\ndeveloped to set a direction for the Organization’s\r\nprogrammes and budgetary planning so as to ensure a\r\nstrategic connection between programmes and resource\r\nallocation. We believe that the formulation of such a\r\nstrategic framework could be very important for an\r\neffective shift towards a results-based approach. The\r\nbiennial programme plan should be a policy instrument\r\nto translate the Organization’s legislative mandates into\r\nprogrammes. The budget outline should be more\r\ndetailed, with additional information on programmatic\r\nand resource changes.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s proposal for an\r\nimproved and renamed medium-term plan, combined\r\nwith an interlinked and expanded budget outline, will\r\nnot only reduce the time needed for their review, but\r\nalso ensure an appropriate level of resources being\r\nallocated to each programme. In order to achieve all of\r\nthe objectives and goals set out in the medium-term\r\nplan, we need to strengthen the system of monitoring\r\nand evaluation, as well as enhance the role of the\r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination. The basis\r\nof that system is self-monitoring and evaluation by\r\neach programme manager, which is crucial for the\r\nbetter implementation of the programmes. As a result,\r\nthe Secretariat would report more frequently to\r\nMember States on programme performance and\r\nevaluation. Member States would then be able to\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nprovide them with timely policy guidance for future\r\nplans, including any necessary adjustment of resource\r\nneeds, while considering the reports.\r\nMy delegation greatly appreciates the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s efforts to develop an implementation plan to\r\nstrengthen the effectiveness of the United Nations\r\nsystem in developing countries. We support his\r\nintention to strengthen the resident coordinator system\r\nand to coordinate all United Nations activities at the\r\ncountry level, as expressed in part VII of his report in\r\ndocument A/58/351. We believe that the annual global\r\nresident representative meetings will soon come up\r\nwith new initiatives to make more efficient use of the\r\nscarce United Nations resources allocated for the\r\ndeveloping countries. We are looking forward to this\r\nimplementation being discussed in 2004 at the triennial\r\ncomprehensive policy review of operational activities\r\nfor development.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation hopes that our\r\ndeliberations will result in constructive contributions\r\nthat make the United Nations a stronger and more\r\neffective international body. In this sprit, my delegation\r\nwishes to welcome the panel of eminent personalities\r\nappointed by the Secretary-General to examine the\r\ncurrent challenges and make recommendations on a\r\nbroad-based organizational reform. We fully believe\r\nthat the panel’s recommendations, to be submitted to\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, as well\r\nas those of the Non-Aligned Movement working group\r\non the reform of the United Nations and the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, will provide\r\nsound and objective inputs for the constructive and\r\nefficient reform of the Organization.\r\nMr. De La Sablière (France) (spoke in French):\r\nAmong the suggestions put forward with regard to the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly is that we\r\nshould avoid repetitive speeches. I will not, therefore,\r\nrepeat the detailed comments of the Italian presidency\r\nof the European Union. France fully associates itself\r\nwith the statement made by the representative of Italy\r\non behalf of the Union.\r\nI would simply like briefly to express France’s\r\nsupport for greater balance among the various organs\r\nof the United Nations. First, the General Assembly, a\r\nuniversal organ, needs to reassert its position and its\r\nauthority in its own domain. We believe that it would\r\nbe damaging to the United Nations system if we failed\r\nto fully count on one of its key pillars. Secondly, I\r\nwould like to refer to the resolute and encouraging\r\naction of President Hunte, who can count on the\r\nsupport of the French delegation in his efforts to\r\nrevitalize the General Assembly.\r\nChange is evident in all areas this year. The need\r\nfor change is now appreciated by everyone. The time\r\nhas come for us all to commit ourselves and to\r\nunderscore the importance we attach to the General\r\nAssembly. I have no doubt that the outside world is\r\nagain taking note of what is happening in the\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Nambiar (India): My delegation is pleased\r\nto participate in this debate. We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the various reports presented under the\r\nagenda items under consideration. We also express our\r\nappreciation to the Deputy Secretary-General,\r\nMs. Louise Fréchette, for her introductory statement\r\nyesterday.\r\nThe broader issues outlining the position of the\r\nnon-aligned countries were expressed yesterday by\r\nAlgeria, speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, and by Morocco, speaking on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77. Their statements have my delegation’s\r\nsupport.\r\nWe congratulate the President of the Assembly on\r\nhis personal commitment to the process of revitalizing\r\nthe General Assembly. In the few weeks during which\r\nhe has presided over the General Assembly, he has\r\ndemonstrated, by personal example, his determination\r\nto restore the prestige and authority of the General\r\nAssembly. We wish him every success in this\r\nendeavour and assure him of the fullest cooperation of\r\nthe Indian delegation.\r\nMy delegation has maintained that in reform and\r\nrevitalization we cannot expect to achieve remarkable\r\nresults overnight. There are no magic solutions. Where\r\nwe are called upon to deal with sensitive political\r\nquestions and issues perceived by Member States as\r\nimpinging on their core national interests, change will\r\nnecessarily be slow and measured. We need to build on\r\nareas of agreement step by step, block by block. A\r\nuseful beginning can be made by a quick review of the\r\nrevitalization exercise undertaken so far and of the\r\nstate of implementation or non-implementation of the\r\nresolutions already adopted.\r\nIndia’s broad political support for the reform\r\nprocess is premised on the objective of enhancing the\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nOrganization’s effectiveness to make it more\r\nresponsive to the priorities of Member States,\r\nparticularly for the developing countries, which\r\nconstitute the vast majority of its membership.\r\nOur support for the Secretary-General’s initiative\r\nof setting up a high-level panel of eminent personalities\r\nto report on the threats and challenges faced by the\r\nUnited Nations and the changes necessary in its\r\ninstitutions and processes is also premised on the\r\nsame objective. We hope the intergovernmental\r\nconsideration of the report and its recommendations\r\nwill provide us an opportunity to take a holistic view of\r\nthe entire process, so that reforms in different parts of\r\nthe United Nations system may move in the same\r\ndirection and prove enduring in the long run.\r\nThe litmus test of any reform exercise would be\r\nwhether it increases the Organization’s ability to assist\r\nthe developing countries in achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and other targets agreed upon at\r\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits.\r\nThe United Nations will be strengthened if and when it\r\ncontributes effectively to the efforts of the developing\r\ncountries in the implementation of those outcomes.\r\nThis must also involve monitoring the extent to which\r\ndeveloped countries are demonstrating shared\r\nresponsibility by fulfilling their commitments and\r\nobligations, especially in reaching the agreed target of\r\nofficial development assistance through provision of\r\nadditional financial resources, transfer of technologies,\r\ndebt relief, market access and movement towards a\r\ngreater voice for the developing countries in\r\ninternational, monetary and trade institutions. The\r\nother major test of the reform exercise will be greater\r\neffectiveness in the United Nations ability to deal with\r\nthe “global bads”, as it were: international terrorism,\r\nweapons of mass destruction — including the issue of\r\nnuclear disarmament — and transnational organized\r\ncrime, including the trafficking in narcotic drugs,\r\nhumans and arms.\r\nIn attempting to revitalize the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, we must underline first of all the\r\nquestion of its core competence. The General\r\nAssembly is meant to be the highest body in the\r\nOrganization to deliberate and review policy. It is not\r\nexpected to function as an executive or judiciary body.\r\nAs its presiding officer, the President must be able to\r\nenhance the effective performance of this function in\r\nthe interest of the broad membership of the Assembly.\r\nIn this era of cross-cutting concerns, we must guard\r\nagainst an overly zealous approach in which this body\r\nwould proceed intrusively into areas which are\r\nessentially the core competence of other bodies in the\r\nUnited Nations system, even as we avoid a surrender of\r\nthe General Assembly’s remit to other bodies,\r\nincluding the Security Council or the Secretariat.\r\nIn practical terms, while the interactions between\r\nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil have given rise to few difficulties, the\r\nrelationship between the Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil does occasionally give rise to anomalies in\r\nterms of issues taken up for consideration and their\r\ntreatment. Also, the relative roles of the presiding\r\nofficers of the two organs need clarification. We need\r\nto remember that the President of the General\r\nAssembly does not have the authority to represent the\r\ncollective opinion of the General Assembly except\r\nwhen he is explicitly authorized to do so by the\r\nAssembly itself. The United Nations Charter does not\r\nconfer any authority on the President in substantive\r\nmatters.\r\nWhile saying this, there is no denying the need\r\nfor the Office of the President to be strengthened for\r\nthe effective and orderly conduct of the Assembly’s\r\nbusiness. Without waiting for a lengthy and time-\r\nconsuming exercise, we could move rapidly in several\r\nareas. For example, the Office of the President could\r\neasily be strengthened by the provision of a small\r\nnumber of additional posts. The implementation of this\r\nmeasure should not depend on the relative alacrity of\r\nthe Secretariat’s response to this as compared to other\r\nmore attractive demands upon it.\r\nSimilarly, the Assembly needs to undertake a\r\nthorough review, not only of the agenda and\r\nprogramme of work for plenary meetings and of the\r\nMain Committees, but also of their methods of work,\r\nwith a view to improving them and enhancing their\r\neffectiveness. The General Committee or an equivalent\r\nbody could be entrusted with functions similar to those\r\nof the bureau of a Main Committee.\r\nIf there were consensus on reforming the agenda,\r\nMember States would be willing to explore ways in\r\nwhich discussions could be organized around particular\r\nthemes and sub-themes in the work of the Main\r\nCommittees. Similarly, Member States would be open\r\nto the idea of designating a theme for the general\r\ndebate in plenary meeting, so long as they are in a\r\nposition to address issues of concern to them.\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nThere has been some talk of rationalizing the\r\nnumber, length and language of resolutions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Since the General Assembly is the\r\nprincipal deliberative organ and fills a policy-making\r\nfunction, it is inevitable that some of its resolutions\r\nwill contain declaratory language. However, when it\r\ncomes to resolutions concerning the implementation of\r\nprogrammes of action or operational activities, it\r\nshould be possible, in our view, to rationalize the\r\nlanguage of resolutions and to simplify them so that the\r\nfocus is on their operational content. This would also\r\nhelp in overseeing and reviewing implementation of\r\nthe resolutions.\r\nAnother area that lends itself to early examination\r\nand agreement is that of the strict observance of the\r\nrules of procedure. The Main Committees seem to have\r\ndeveloped work cultures of their own and often display\r\nscant respect for the established rules of procedure.\r\nThis is not conscionable, and it is important that we\r\nlook into this area more closely. At the same time, we\r\nneed to be open to the idea of reviewing the rules of\r\nprocedure and adapting them to modern times. To\r\nillustrate this point, the General Assembly would save\r\nvaluable time and resources if we were to decide that\r\ndelegations were free to circulate a longer version of\r\ntheir statements but would read only, say, an executive\r\nsummary, so long as they were assured that the longer\r\nversion would go into the record. However, so long as\r\nthe provisional verbatim records of the General\r\nAssembly contain only the words that are actually\r\nspoken, that will not be possible.\r\nThere is often talk of the need to make General\r\nAssembly proceedings more interesting and attractive.\r\nThis goal is pursued through the organizing of several\r\nhigh-profile parallel events, such as interactive\r\ndialogues, panel discussions and seminars. One of the\r\nstated objectives of this exercise is to enhance\r\ninteraction with civil society, including non-\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs), academia and the\r\nprivate sector. While there is nothing intrinsically\r\nobjectionable in this idea — and in fact it might be\r\nuseful — we wish to underscore the intergovernmental\r\ncharacter of the Organization. Any effort to enhance\r\ninteraction with civil society should be done in a\r\nmanner that increases the quality of intergovernmental\r\ndecision-making.\r\nThe Secretariat deserves our praise for\r\nrecommending the elimination of several reports,\r\nmeetings and other activities of marginal utility. Many\r\nof the reports for the fifty-eighth session were received\r\nwell within the prescribed limit. We are grateful for\r\nthis.\r\nThere are several other areas that need to be\r\nexplored in terms of reducing the number of meetings\r\nand reports, reducing the number of resolutions and\r\nhaving sunset provisions for both new mandates and\r\nexisting activities. Without doubt, these will require\r\nfurther discussion. We would just like to underline that\r\nreducing the volume of work and managing time and\r\nresources efficiently and effectively is a task not only\r\nfor the Secretariat but also for Member States. A\r\ndegree of self-discipline has to be exercised by\r\nMember States before they rush forward with new\r\ninitiatives and resolutions every year.\r\nThe Secretary-General has outlined in document\r\nA/58/351 some of the measures being undertaken in his\r\nreport on the status of implementation of actions in\r\nresponse to General Assembly resolution 57/300.\r\nWe trust that the consultations being held by the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nwill encompass not only the members of the\r\nCommission on Human Rights but non-members of the\r\nCommission as well. We would emphasize the need for\r\nthe process to be inclusive so that no impression is\r\ngiven of agreeing on matters in exclusive groupings.\r\nWe hope the exercise will reduce the burden of\r\nreporting requirements, particularly on the developing\r\ncountries. We would be open to considering guidelines\r\nfor an expanded core document, so long as it is\r\nunderstood that such a document would reduce the\r\nreporting burden, address the issue of backlog, avoid\r\nthe repetition of details and obviate the need for\r\nreplicating the contents of the core document in\r\nindividual reports to treaty bodies, or effectively\r\nexpand the obligations of States parties to the core\r\ncovenants. We call for more consultations with\r\nMember States on the matter.\r\nThe information on improving the system of\r\nspecial procedures provided in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General raises several points of concern. It is\r\nnot clear to us whether the consultations initiated by\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Human Rights on improving the special procedures\r\nmechanisms are inclusive and wide-ranging. We\r\nbelieve that the emphasis should be on greater\r\ncoordination, avoiding duplication and overlapping,\r\nand checking the tendency of special procedures\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nmandate holders to exceed their mandates, which\r\nseems to be happening rather too frequently.\r\nWe do not favour the idea of joint initiatives,\r\nincluding joint urgent appeals, statements, press\r\nreleases and communications, by special procedures\r\nmandate holders. In our view, the special procedures\r\nmandates are each distinct and different. We also do\r\nnot see the need for a feasibility study for enhancing\r\nthe “dissemination” of findings and recommendations\r\nof special procedures mandate holders. We believe\r\nsuch dissemination should be in the form of reports to\r\nthe Commission on Human Rights. After all, the\r\nmandate holders are appointees of the Commission.\r\nAdditionally, we do not believe that any useful purpose\r\nis served by interaction between special procedures\r\nmechanisms and the Counter-Terrorism Committee of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nWe call on the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights to fully implement\r\nthe recommendations made by the Office of Internal\r\nOversight Services following their management review.\r\nIn our view, those recommendations are comprehensive\r\nand focused, and merit full and effective\r\nimplementation. Any expansion in the activities of the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights must be commensurate with its\r\nbudgetary resources, and not based on extrabudgetary\r\nfunding.\r\nWe note the ongoing work on the simplification\r\nand harmonization of programming tools and the\r\nstrengthening of the resident coordinator system and\r\nwe hope that those efforts will result in a reduction of\r\ntransaction costs for developing countries and will\r\nenhance country ownership. It is important that specific\r\nproposals based on the policy guidelines set forth in\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 57/300 be submitted to\r\nthe executive boards of the funds and programmes for\r\napproval.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General sets out the\r\nrecommendations of the Secretariat’s joint Working\r\nGroup on Transition Issues, which was charged with\r\nreviewing a range of United Nations responses in post-\r\nconflict situations. The Group recommended the\r\nfacilitation of links among the political, peacekeeping\r\nand operational wings of the United Nations in order to\r\naddress the variance in mandates for different United\r\nNations offices at a given location. The underlying\r\npremise seems to be that a United Nations response\r\ncannot be effective if it is fragmented and that,\r\ntherefore, those dealing with humanitarian assistance,\r\nthose dealing with security, those dealing with human\r\nrights and those dealing with development should\r\ndeliver an integrated response.\r\nAs we have reiterated on a number of occasions,\r\nthere are several risks associated with such an\r\napproach. There is a predisposition in some quarters to\r\nsee transition issues as opportunities to fundamentally\r\ntransform the social mores, recast the economic\r\npriorities and influence the political dynamics of post-\r\nconflict societies. We must sound a note of caution\r\nhere. If the United Nations collaborates in such efforts\r\nit could jeopardize its status as a trusted partner of\r\ndeveloping countries. It is most important that the\r\nUnited Nations respect the differences in its roles in\r\npeacekeeping, in the protection and promotion of\r\nhuman rights, in fostering economic and social\r\ndevelopment, and in the coordination of humanitarian\r\nassistance. The delivery or coordination of assistance\r\nneeds to be done in a manner that clearly conforms to\r\nthe principles of development and humanitarian\r\nassistance that have been clearly established by the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nDuring its current session, the General Assembly\r\nwill deliberate far-reaching reform of the planning and\r\nbudgetary process. There is widespread recognition\r\nthat these processes can be made more effective and\r\nefficient, with added value for both Member States and\r\nthe Secretariat. While it is important to retain the\r\nintergovernmental nature of these processes, we need at\r\nthe same time to ensure that intergovernmental review\r\nis more effective and relevant and that it provides\r\nclearer guidance to the Secretariat. This is a matter of\r\ncrucial importance. This is a matter of urgency, but,\r\ngiven the long-term implications of such an exercise\r\nfor the Organization, we must avoid hasty or half-\r\ncooked conclusions.\r\nThose are some preliminary views of India on the\r\ncluster of issues under debate today. We took forward\r\nto working with other delegations in the upcoming\r\ndiscussions and consultations under these items.\r\nMr. Kim Sam-hoon (Republic of Korea): At the\r\noutset, I would like to pay tribute to the strong\r\ncommitment that President Hunte has demonstrated to\r\nthe reform of our Organization. My delegation is\r\nencouraged by his dedication to this issue and hopes\r\nthat it will bring about real reform this year. While the\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nRepublic of Korea strongly supports the President’s\r\nleadership in guiding overall United Nations reform,\r\ntoday I would like to focus on the reform of the\r\nGeneral Assembly itself.\r\nAfter 10 years of discussing the issue of General\r\nAssembly reform in this forum, my delegation cannot\r\nhelp but express its frustration with the slow progress\r\nthat has been made thus far. Each year we have spoken\r\non this issue, and yet we are unsure to what extent this\r\nperennial debate has enhanced the authority of the\r\nAssembly. We share the concern regarding the\r\nmarginalization of the General Assembly. Before\r\nputting forward our suggestions on what should be\r\ndone to resolve this problem, however, allow me to\r\nbriefly discuss why we believe it has occurred.\r\nFirst of all, because of the nature of the decisions\r\nmade by the Security Council and the high visibility of\r\nits work, the centre of gravity of the United Nations\r\nhas been progressively shifting towards the Council\r\nsince the end of the cold war. In recent years, the\r\nSecurity Council has expanded the scope of its work\r\nbeyond direct conflict management to include related\r\nmatters such as the rule of law, justice and gender\r\nissues in the context of peacekeeping. It is notable as\r\nwell that the Security Council virtually has the power\r\nto set the level of the peacekeeping budget, which is far\r\ngreater than that of the United Nations regular budget.\r\nNot even the key financial contributors outside of the\r\nSecurity Council are consulted when new peacekeeping\r\noperations are created or existing ones expanded. Thus,\r\nsome would argue that the power left to the General\r\nAssembly does not extend far beyond its rights with\r\nrespect to the regular budget and elections to major\r\nUnited Nations organs, including the non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council.\r\nSecond, the increase in the number of Member\r\nStates has led to a greater divergence of interest and\r\nviews, divisiveness and lack of unity in the General\r\nAssembly. This is a natural corollary of the growth in\r\nmembership. Clearly, the lowest common denominator\r\namong the present 191 Member States is far lower than\r\nit was among the 51 Member States that existed at the\r\ntime of the creation of the United Nations.\r\nOn issues of United Nations reform, all\r\n191 Member States stand in agreement that the\r\nOrganization must be revitalized and strengthened.\r\nUnfortunately, that consensus has been met with\r\n191 different positions on how this reform should be\r\ncarried out. It has become extremely difficult to\r\nformulate reform that will accommodate all the\r\nindividual desires of all Member States. When Member\r\nStates put their parochial interests above the collective\r\ncommon good of the Organization, the process of\r\nGeneral Assembly reform cannot move forward.\r\nMeanwhile, there are too many sacred cows standing in\r\nthe way of General Assembly reform. However, if we\r\ndo not move forward with reform, the Organization’s\r\nintegrity, authority and relevance to the global order\r\nwill suffer.\r\nThirdly, year in and year out too many General\r\nAssembly resolutions are adopted, too few of which are\r\nremembered, cared about or heeded. Many of them do\r\nnot differ in substance from previous resolutions. As\r\nthey are merely declaratory in nature and are not\r\nlegally binding, they carry little weight. The number of\r\nagenda items never stops growing. As a result, we\r\nnotice a tendency for the domestic issues of Member\r\nStates to be brought before the General Assembly.\r\nDespite their dubious relevance, it is difficult for the\r\nother Member States not to support these resolutions,\r\nso long as they do no direct harm. However, the\r\nadoption of irrelevant resolutions does cumulative\r\nharm to the credibility of the General Assembly. The\r\nAssembly has expanded its scope of work to include\r\neven the commemoration of a national event. While\r\nthese issues may be important for specific Member\r\nStates, we must admit that they obscure the pressing\r\nglobal issues of concern to us all.\r\nAll these factors have combined to result in the\r\nweakening of the authority and relevance of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Although there are inherent\r\nconstraints stemming from the Charter that reform\r\ncannot overcome, there is still much that we, as\r\nMember States, can do to revitalize and strengthen the\r\nrole of the General Assembly.\r\nFirst, we share the view that the Assembly should\r\nfocus on issues in which the United Nations can make a\r\ndifference in the world and which the Governments and\r\npeoples we serve will care about and take note of.\r\nMore of the General Assembly’s time and resources\r\nmust be allocated to in-depth discussions on the most\r\npressing global issues of public interest. In that regard,\r\nwe support the idea of organizing the General\r\nAssembly agenda around a number of thematic issues.\r\nMoreover, certain agenda items should be considered\r\nbiannually or triannually, while the obsolete ones\r\nshould be deleted altogether. In that context, we\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nsupport the idea of avoiding repetition of the same\r\nresolutions. We must also exert greater effort to\r\nconsolidate redundant issues and to re-evaluate issues\r\nthat no longer serve their original purpose. In that\r\nregard, the Republic of Korea welcomes the initiative\r\nof the President on the regrouping or clustering of\r\nagenda items and looks forward to further progress to\r\nthat end.\r\nSecondly, with respect to the organization of\r\nmeetings, we support the idea of scheduling meetings\r\nthroughout the year so that we can make the best use of\r\nthe resources available to Missions and to the\r\nSecretariat. We see no compelling reason why all\r\nCommittee sessions should begin at the same time or\r\nwhy meetings should be concentrated in one season. If\r\nmeetings were spread throughout the year, Member\r\nStates could devote more attention to each agenda item.\r\nThirdly, the Republic of Korea agrees that there is\r\na need to strengthen the Office of the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in order to enhance the authority\r\nand the role of the Assembly. In that regard, we lend\r\nour support to the idea of using the General Committee\r\nas a bureau for the presidency. In the light of our own\r\nexperience of holding the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly in 2001, we believe the Office of the\r\nPresident would benefit from an increased number of\r\npermanent staff members drawn from the Secretariat.\r\nIn that connection, we underline the importance of the\r\nSecretary-General’s support for the Office of the\r\nPresident.\r\nFourthly, we agree that there is a need to\r\nrestructure and streamline the outdated roles of the\r\norgans so that the General Assembly can deal with\r\nsalient global issues. In that context, the Republic of\r\nKorea pledges its unswerving support for United\r\nNations reform aimed at promoting sound\r\nadministration of the Organization’s resources,\r\ntransparency, a culture of accountability and improved\r\nprogramme performance to meet the challenges of our\r\ntime.\r\nFifthly, regarding the modalities of reform,\r\ncomprehensive holistic approaches have been in\r\nfashion for quite some time now at the United Nations.\r\nNevertheless, there may be cases in which a piecemeal\r\napproach could prove more practical than a holistic\r\napproach. Thus, we see merit in employing an\r\nincremental approach in the context of attaining a\r\nholistic perspective.\r\nSixthly, we must make efforts to put the\r\ncollective interests of the global community above our\r\nparochial interests. The United Nations was created to\r\nbe greater than the sum of its parts. The lowest\r\ncommon denominator among 191 Member States with\r\ndifferent philosophies and interests is far too low to\r\neffect real change. If we allow the reform process to\r\nmove forward at the speed of those who are the least\r\nwilling to move, little can be achieved. We should\r\ntherefore not let the lowest common denominator\r\ndictate the speed and scope of reform. Real change\r\nwithin the United Nations will not happen without\r\nsome degree of sacrifice from the general membership.\r\nWhen put in a broader context, small yet meaningful\r\nconcessions from Member States will ultimately lead to\r\ntangible benefits for the entire international\r\ncommunity.\r\nFinally, my delegation wishes to stress that\r\nUnited Nations reform should be a continuous and\r\naction-oriented process. The United Nations, as a\r\nliving organism, must constantly evolve and adapt in a\r\ntimely manner to changing circumstances and to the\r\nneeds of the times. When it fails to meet this challenge,\r\nit falls into benign irrelevance. Implementing reform is\r\nthe only way to enable the Organization to overcome\r\nthe new and emerging challenges that our dynamic\r\nworld continues to pose.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has succinctly presented a most comprehensive\r\nreport on strengthening the United Nations (A/58/351).\r\nIt demonstrates his clear vision and consistent thoughts\r\non bringing it to fruition. He is deserving of our most\r\nsincere thanks. But I would be remiss were I not to\r\nmake very early reference to the commendable\r\ncommitment and bold initiatives of the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to that end. These have accorded a\r\npositive impetus to the revitalization process. His non-\r\npaper provides an excellent basis for our formal and\r\ninformal deliberations.\r\nI should also point out that we associate ourselves\r\nwith the views of the representative of Algeria,\r\nAmbassador Abdallah Baali, who spoke on\r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, and\r\nAmbassador Mohamed Bennouna of Morocco, who\r\nspoke on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Their\r\nleadership role in this regard is praiseworthy.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nBangladesh is a country which is in the midst of a\r\ntremendous societal transformation. Through a mix of\r\nappropriate macroeconomic policies, judicious use of\r\nexternal support, innovative home-grown ideas,\r\ncommitment to democracy and pluralism and ardent\r\ndedication to gender justice and women’s\r\nempowerment, peace and development have emerged\r\nas the twin supreme objectives of our nation. We see\r\nthe United Nations as also embodying these aspirations\r\nand complementing our own efforts and those of others\r\nin comparable milieux.\r\nWe see the need for better equipping this\r\ninstitution, which represents the urges of humanity. We\r\nmust, working together, enhance its capacity to realize\r\nits goals. Hence, we have consistently supported the\r\nreform efforts that we believe aim at doing just that.\r\nWe believe that reform should be a continuing process.\r\nIt should involve enhancing the efficiency of the\r\nSecretariat. It should also address itself to such\r\nintergovernmental organs as the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council.\r\nChanges sought must be aimed at the general good.\r\nThey must not bend to the will of the more powerful.\r\nThey must respond to complex global challenges posed\r\nin the areas of peace, security and development. Their\r\npurpose must be to contribute to reaffirming the United\r\nNations as the central, universal, multilateral institution\r\nof the twenty-first century.\r\nAt the heart of the reform exercise must lie the\r\ndesire to achieve all the goals set out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration as well as the implementation of all of the\r\naction plans emanating from the great conferences of\r\nthe 1990s. While combating the “hard” terror brought\r\non by irrational thought and action, the Organization\r\nshould also be adequately empowered to root out the\r\n“soft” terrors of hunger, disease, privation and\r\nenvironmental degradation. While leading and\r\ninspiring the intellectual quest for the best means to\r\nadvance human welfare, it must also function as the\r\nlocator, collator and transmitter of indigenously\r\nevolved best practices. Reforms must not perpetuate\r\ncurrent imbalances, nor must they respond only to the\r\npolitical, economic and military realities of a given\r\npoint in time, for they are only transitory.\r\nRevitalization of the intergovernmental processes and\r\ninstitutions should not be seen in a mutually exclusive\r\nand compartmentalized manner, but in a mutually\r\nreinforcing and holistic way.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s decision in this context\r\nto set up a panel of eminent personalities is most\r\nwelcome. Those selected should be representative of\r\nthe broadest spectrum of intellectual diversity as well\r\nas of equitable geographical distribution. It is\r\nimportant to ensure that they work free of external\r\ninterference and in tandem with the intergovernmental\r\nprocess. They must also be able to address the problem\r\nwithout any ideological bias or preconceived a priori\r\nnotions that would continue to be held even in the face\r\nof empirical evidence to the contrary.\r\nWe are heartened to note that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has accorded high priority to the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and to the medium-term plan in\r\nproposing a programme budget for 2004-2005. This is\r\nin line with what the General Assembly recommended\r\nlast year. We are pleased with the cultural shift in\r\npresenting the budget in a results-based format. We\r\ncommend the proposals for a shorter and more strategic\r\nmedium-term plan and for refocusing the role of the\r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination to\r\nmonitor programme performance and evaluation. My\r\ndelegation will examine these proposals with an open\r\nmind in the appropriate intergovernmental forum. We\r\nare confident that the Organization would benefit from\r\na coherent approach to further rationalization of\r\nstructures, optimal utilization of resources, elimination\r\nof duplication, reinforcement of coordination and\r\nintroduction of benchmarks for monitoring and\r\nperformance evaluation.\r\nEconomic and social development is the area to\r\nwhich my delegation attaches the highest importance.\r\nWe support the enhancement of the effectiveness of the\r\nfield presence of the United Nations in developing\r\ncountries. The proposed modalities, such as\r\nstrengthening the United Nations resident coordinator\r\nsystem, simplification and harmonization of\r\ndevelopment programmes, improving accountability,\r\njoint programming and evaluation reporting are\r\nnoteworthy. The end result of these reform efforts must\r\nensure better service delivery at the country level.\r\nNational development needs and priorities should\r\nconstitute the basis of these improved operational\r\nactivities.\r\nThe establishment of the Office of the Special\r\nAdviser on Africa should provide increased support to\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD). As the Chair of the Second Committee this\r\nyear, I would recommend and hope that the proposed\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nmeasures also contribute to the implementation of the\r\nBrussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed\r\nCountries for the Decade 2001-2010 in their\r\ndevelopment cooperation programmes. An\r\noverwhelming number of least developed countries are\r\nin Africa, a continent that confronts manifold structural\r\nimpediments to development. Those barriers must be\r\nbrought down. Africa has suffered much and long. The\r\nworld now owes it to Africa to relieve its pain.\r\nThe new budget realignment to strengthen the\r\ncapacity of the Economic and Social Council towards\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nand the Monterrey and Johannesburg decisions is a\r\ntimely initiative. We look forward to the opportunity to\r\nassess the follow-up mechanisms to the Monterrey\r\nConsensus during the intergovernmental discussions in\r\n2004. We strongly support the dialogue process\r\nestablished among the Bretton Woods institutions, the\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) and the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD).\r\nHuman rights is an area of high priority for\r\nBangladesh. We believe development can only take\r\nplace against a social matrix where values of human\r\nrights enjoy a premium. Many of the institutional\r\nreforms merit our commendation. I speak particularly,\r\nof those aimed at strengthening the Office of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, supporting national\r\ncapacity-building of strong human rights institutions,\r\nrationalizing reporting obligations to treaty bodies and\r\nimproving the special procedures system. When the\r\nHigh Commissioner prepares his report next year, we\r\nwould expect that Member States would be\r\nappropriately consulted.\r\nWe endorse the Secretary-General’s approach\r\ntowards evolving closer collaboration with civil society\r\nand the private sector. Bangladesh, as all are aware, has\r\na vibrant civil society and a burgeoning private sector.\r\nBoth are engaged in our country with the positive\r\nchanges under way in our own society. While we look\r\nforward to the report of the Panel of Eminent Persons\r\non United Nations Relations with Civil Society, we\r\ncontinue to advocate that capacity-building for\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nand the Monterrey Consensus and for globalization\r\nshould receive high priority in the role to be played by\r\nboth the sectors. Many of the pragmatic\r\nrecommendations that are emanating from the\r\ninteractions between the Second Committee and civil\r\nsociety this year merit consideration in the work of the\r\nPanel. We are hopeful that the measures undertaken\r\ninvolving new techniques and technologies will\r\nimprove the dissemination of public information,\r\narchives and documentation and also will make the\r\nvoice of the United Nations heard better, and its\r\nrelevance understood more.\r\nAs Chair of the Committee on Information this\r\nyear, I look forward to working closely with the\r\nDepartment of Public Information and Member States\r\non a systematic evaluation of the impact of all the good\r\nmeasures undertaken to strengthen a culture of\r\ncommunications in the Organization. Reallocation of\r\nresources saved from regional hubbing in Western\r\nEurope to strengthening United Nations information\r\ncentres in developing countries and to promoting\r\nmultilingualism would be of special interest to\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nBefore I conclude, let me say a word on the buzz-\r\nword in the corridors: revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly. We are confident that many of the creative\r\nand pragmatic ideas that emanated from the past few\r\nyears of work and from our recent informals with you,\r\nMr. President, will be sharpened and honed through\r\nfurther consultations. It is too early to comment on the\r\nspecifics. However, the philosophy of the revitalization\r\nprocess should first be agreed upon. The two\r\nclusters — one on improving the working methods and\r\nthe other on restoring and enhancing the authority and\r\npowers of the General Assembly, as envisaged in the\r\nCharter — should progress simultaneously.\r\nStarting immediately with the small and\r\nachievable could be a practical strategy. Proper\r\nevaluation of progress would bring greater success.\r\nDemonstration of strong political will in placing\r\ncollective interest before national interest, to prevent\r\nfurther marginalization and erosion of the General\r\nAssembly vis-à-vis the Security Council, should\r\nreceive special focus. Strengthening the Office and role\r\nof the President of the General Assembly and its public\r\noutreach should be a valid and achievable starting\r\npoint.\r\nThe Committees are key to the function of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Their revitalization must not be\r\nseen as separate from that of the Assembly. Reform and\r\nrevitalization, then, must be a continuous, holistic and\r\nseamless process, aiming at expanding the wherewithal\r\nof the United Nations and all its organs to serve\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nhumanity. Because this institution represents some of\r\nthe noblest motives of humankind, it deserves the best\r\nthat our creativity and wisdom can press into its\r\nservice. The United Nations and humanity will find the\r\nresults mutually rewarding.\r\nMr. Gatan (Philippines): The Philippines stands\r\nin solidarity with the views of the Group of 77 and of\r\nthe Non- Aligned Movement on the cluster of four\r\nimportant agenda items relating to United Nations\r\nreform.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to note that the Office\r\nof the President of the General Assembly has\r\ndemonstrated renewed interest in the subject of our\r\ncurrent joint debate. We therefore commend you, Mr.\r\nPresident, for the number of initiatives you have\r\nalready launched that are aimed at the efficient and\r\neffective management of the current and future\r\nsessions of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. President, in response to the call you made in\r\nyour informal note for delegations to contribute\r\nconstructively to this joint debate by proposing specific\r\nand concrete courses of action on both the form and\r\nsubstance of the work of the General Assembly, my\r\ndelegation will refrain from dwelling on\r\ngeneralizations.\r\nWhile our specific recommendations are directed\r\ntowards the General Assembly in relation to agenda\r\nitem 55, some may find application in the other\r\nclustered agenda items.\r\nWith regard to procedural matters, my delegation\r\nwishes, as of now, to submit only three proposals.\r\nFirst, we propose that regional or group\r\nstatements should take precedence over national\r\nstatements in their inscription for the general debate.\r\nDelegations aligning themselves with the views\r\npresented by their respective regions or groups should\r\ntry to refrain from delivering statements for the\r\npurpose of reiterating views already contained in their\r\ngroup statements. However, delegations which hold\r\nviews not espoused in their regional or group\r\nstatements may deliver brief national statements.\r\nRegional or group statements should be\r\ncomprehensive in written form for distribution, but\r\ntheir oral presentation has to be shortened, through\r\neither the presentation of an abstract or the highlighting\r\nof salient points only.\r\nSecondly, we propose that not only should related\r\nagenda items be clustered, but also that the resolutions\r\narising from them should likewise be clustered.\r\nClustering, of course, generates a holistic consideration\r\nof interrelated issues, avoids duplication and thus\r\nconserves resources. More importantly, it allows more\r\ntime for both interactive discussions and consideration\r\nof the President’s conclusions on each cluster of\r\nagenda items — the subject of our next\r\nrecommendation.\r\nThirdly, we propose that more time be given to an\r\ninteractive discussion of issues considered during the\r\ngeneral debate or of thematic issues. In this regard, it is\r\nfurther recommended that, in order to avoid an\r\nunwieldy exchange of views by all 191 States Members\r\nof the United Nations, the interactive discussion be\r\ncarried out mainly by the spokesmen for groups, spiced\r\nwith the participation of representatives of selected\r\nsectors of civil society. The President would then issue\r\nhis own assessments or conclusions on the outcome of\r\nboth the general debate and the interactive discussions,\r\nwhich may also serve as the basis for the formulation\r\nof resolutions or decisions of the General Assembly.\r\nThese three modest proposals for procedural\r\nchange could go a long way towards injecting life into\r\nthe work of the General Assembly, by giving more\r\nrelevance to the outcome of discussions in the form of\r\nresolutions and decisions and by addressing the heart\r\nof universal or global concerns rather than marginal\r\nconcerns.\r\nWith regard to substance, revitalization or reform\r\nmay be elusive if we do not identify the perennial\r\nproblems confronting the United Nations.\r\nIn terms of gravity, the foremost problem is the\r\ngeneral awareness that United Nations resolutions, with\r\nthe exception of those adopted by the Security Council,\r\nare not binding on Member States. The second problem\r\nis also the awareness that a great number of United\r\nNations bodies are no longer representative of the\r\ngeneral membership — a situation that can erode the\r\ninterest of many Member States. The third is the\r\napparent lack of strong coordination among the three\r\nimportant organs of the United Nations, namely  the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nWith regard to the first problem, my delegation\r\nproposes that an effective monitoring system be\r\ninstalled. For example, the monitoring of the\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nimplementation of General Assembly resolutions\r\nshould be delegated, whenever possible, to competent\r\nbodies such as the regional commissions. Monitoring\r\nshould be a continuing process whose results should be\r\nreported back to the General Assembly.\r\nOn the second problem, my delegation proposes a\r\nreview by, perhaps, a working group on the\r\nmembership of important United Nations bodies,\r\nstarting with the Economic and Social Council, with a\r\nview to rationalizing membership in relation to the\r\nnumber of countries represented or to group\r\nrepresentation.\r\nOn the third problem, we propose intersessional\r\nbilateral consultative meetings between the President\r\nof the General Assembly and the President of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council to coordinate their\r\nrespective work and to assess the outcome of\r\ncoordination. There should likewise be consultative\r\nmeetings between the Presidents of the General\r\nAssembly and of the Security Council, in accordance\r\nwith the relevant provisions of the United Nations\r\nCharter, particularly Articles 10, 11 and 24.\r\nFor more than 10 years, the General Assembly\r\nhas been seized with the issue of revitalization and\r\nreform. Yet the measures adopted so far have been\r\nmodest in contrast to the mounting problems of both\r\nmacro and micromanagement. My delegation is\r\nconfident that under your stewardship of the fifty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly, we will be\r\nable to register significant improvements in both the\r\nform and the substance of our multilateral work\r\nMy delegation proposes that the President once\r\nagain convene an informal working group to look into\r\nall the submissions presented during this joint debate to\r\ncoming up with an agreed improved course of action to\r\ntake effect at the earliest opportunity.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): The Libyan delegation expresses its\r\nsatisfaction at the importance attached to the reform of\r\nthe United Nations and the rationalization of the role of\r\nthe General Assembly. My delegation expresses its\r\nappreciation to you, Sir, for your initiative to study\r\nmethods of improving the work of the General\r\nAssembly and your determination to pursue this\r\nprocess within the framework of strengthening the\r\nAssembly’s role so that it can function more\r\neffectively.\r\nWe pay tribute to the Secretary-General for the\r\nreforms and for the initiative that he presented at the\r\nstart of this session, namely the creation of a panel of\r\neminent persons to study the reform of the United\r\nNations. The delegation of Algeria spoke on behalf of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, and the delegation of\r\nMorocco spoke on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina. We support their statements and wish to add a\r\nfew comments.\r\nIn evaluating the progress made to date on the\r\nrationalization of the General Assembly, Libya\r\nconsiders it a step in the right direction that the\r\nPresident and Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly\r\nand the Chairmen of the Main Committees are elected\r\nthree months before the General Assembly session\r\nbegins. However, we believe that this is merely a\r\nprocedural change, not a goal. We need measures\r\nfocussing on substantial issues in order to give real\r\nmeaning to the revitalization of the Assembly. We must\r\nreactivate the Assembly’s role so that it can be the\r\nresponsible body to which the subsidiary organs,\r\nincluding the Security Council, must be accountable. It\r\nmust carry out its work as mandated by the Charter and\r\nbe faithful to its principles, working in cooperation\r\nwith other bodies for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. Moreover we think that the General\r\nAssembly should meet whenever a crisis that threatens\r\ninternational peace arises, study the crisis and then\r\ntransmit its recommendations for study by the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nMy delegation understands the importance of\r\nencouraging Member States, as well as their national\r\ninstitutions and civil societies, to publish widely the\r\ndecisions and recommendations of the General\r\nAssembly. That would solve the dilemma that concerns\r\nus: the inability to implement the resolutions adopted\r\nby this body. We think the most effective measure in\r\nthis respect would be to create a mechanism of the\r\nGeneral Assembly that would follow up on\r\nimplementation of its decisions and recommendations\r\nand highlight successes and failures and the means of\r\nremedying them. Otherwise, we fear that some will\r\nhave the impression that this body is simply a place\r\nwhere people and countries shed tears and make\r\ncomplaints over resolutions that remain dead letters —\r\nas the Secretary-General has said, resolutions of no\r\nimportance outside the Assembly Hall.\r\nMember States are keen to be represented at the\r\nhighest level during the general debate of each session\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nof the General Assembly. The presence of heads of\r\nState and Government during this and past sessions\r\ndemonstrates the great importance that Member States\r\nattach to the Assembly as the principal forum for\r\ndeliberation and policy-making. However, we feel that\r\nthis interest starts to wane after the first two weeks of\r\nthe session. Certain items on the agenda have been\r\naddressed by speakers who find themselves practically\r\nalone in the Hall — a small handful of delegates attend\r\nsimply as a matter of courtesy. My delegation thinks\r\nthat we should reflect on how to make agenda items\r\nmore attractive, for example by encouraging interactive\r\ndebate rather than listening to previously prepared\r\nstatements. We should study the proposal on issues of\r\nspecial concern and ensure balance in the items of the\r\nagenda.\r\nThe delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\r\nexpresses its satisfaction at the practice of grouping\r\ncertain agenda items for discussion every two years.\r\nWe were among the first to act on that measure. We\r\nthink that the item under consideration is a case in\r\npoint. We are strongly opposed to what some are doing,\r\nnamely deleting certain items on the agenda that have\r\nnot been debated by the General Assembly for years.\r\nWe think that those resolutions and decisions should\r\ncontinue to be debated and that debate on those items\r\nor the lack thereof should not be made the sole\r\ncriterion for such a decision. The Libyan delegation\r\nsupports a reconsideration of the annual decisions of\r\nthe General Assembly. We believe that items of a\r\nsimilar nature should be grouped together. We support\r\nthe proposal aimed at reducing the number of\r\nresolutions adopted by the General Assembly.\r\nWith respect to the proposal to consider\r\nextending the schedule of the General Assembly\r\nsession over the entire calendar year instead of limiting\r\nit to the period from September to December, we\r\nbelieve it is an original idea. The Fifth Committee\r\nprovides an example; it convenes several time\r\nthroughout the year in order to complete its\r\nconsideration of the items that could not be heard\r\nduring its principal segment. The Libyan delegation\r\nconsiders this proposal to be positive, particularly for\r\nsmall delegations that could then participate more\r\nintensively. We think that this proposal deserves\r\nserious study.\r\nIn that context, we ask the following questions.\r\nFirst, will the meetings of the Main Committees take\r\nplace several times a year? If so, when will Member\r\nStates be informed as to which items are to be studied\r\nin each segment, in particular those items that require\r\nexperts to come from participating capitals. Secondly,\r\nif the General Assembly and the Committees hold\r\nmeetings on a continual basis, what will be the length\r\nof each committee meeting, and who decides that?\r\nThirdly, will the meetings of the Main Committees take\r\nplace continually throughout the year, and will there be\r\nsimultaneous meetings of more than one Main\r\nCommittee?\r\nWe have listened with interest to the debate and\r\nproposals for the revitalization of the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The Libyan delegation thinks that\r\nthese ideas require thorough study and examination.\r\nThat should be done in consultation with the General\r\nAssembly as a whole, as was the case on 17 October. In\r\nthat context, we support the proposal to designate\r\ncoordinators for consultations and for the study of the\r\nproposals and for preparing specific proposals to be\r\nconsidered by the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Gatilov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): Russia welcomes the report entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for\r\nfurther change” on the implementation of actions\r\n(A/57/786). We took note of the special attention paid\r\nby the Secretary-General to the issue of United Nations\r\nreform and improvement of its executive mechanisms.\r\nWe wish to note that the Secretary-General clearly\r\nunderstands the substance and the objectives of reforms\r\nand that they are implemented with high administrative\r\nefficiency.\r\nRussia supports the concept of strengthening\r\ncoordination within the United Nations system and the\r\ninterfunctioning of its key elements. We believe that\r\nefforts in this direction should be focused on\r\nformulating a joint response by the international\r\ncommunity to new challenges and threats and on joint\r\nefforts of Member States to strengthen international\r\nsecurity in all its dimensions.\r\nAs far as the report is concerned, we regard it as a\r\nwell-balanced document that objectively reflects the\r\nactive process of transformation in various areas of\r\nUnited Nations activity, in accordance with the well\r\nknown resolution on reform, General Assembly\r\nresolution 57/300. We agree with the idea that the\r\nUnited Nations regular budget for 2004-2005 should\r\nbecome the main practical instrument to bring United\r\nNations activities in line with priority objectives. In\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nother words, the main financial document of the United\r\nNations should effectively contribute to the reform\r\nprocess.\r\nIn the field of human rights, the main goal of\r\ntransformation is to strengthen national systems of\r\nhuman rights protection and to promote closer\r\ninteraction between Governments and United Nations\r\nbodies regarding implementation of core human rights\r\ntreaties. Attention has been paid to activities to\r\nimprove the system of special procedures and to\r\nenhance the degree of respective responsibilities. We\r\nrecognize the fact that work in that direction has been\r\nconducted generally in a well-balanced and conscious\r\nmanner, without attempting to sacrifice quantity at the\r\nexpense of quality.\r\nThe section of the report on United Nations\r\nactivities in the field of public information is focused\r\non the main aspects of rationalizing United Nations\r\ninformation activities. Analysis of that section of the\r\nreport shows that the transformations that had been\r\ninitiated are essentially in line with the ideas and the\r\ncomments considered during the most recent session of\r\nthe Committee on Information, as well as with the\r\nrecommendations outlined in the report entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations system: an\r\nagenda for further change” (A/57/387).\r\nWe continue to support the restructuring process\r\nof the Department of Public Information. We hope that\r\nthe new operating model of the Department, launched\r\nin November 2002, will contribute to efficient and\r\nconsistent implementation of earlier established\r\nstrategic goals for reforming and improving the United\r\nNations information branch. We consider as important\r\nthe task set out by the Secretary-General to develop a\r\nsystem for assessing the performance of the new\r\noperating model of the Department. We await the\r\nresults of the first annual programme impact review,\r\nwhich, as planned, is to be submitted for consideration\r\nby the twenty-sixth session of the Committee on\r\nInformation in 2004.\r\nWe regard as appropriate the provision of the\r\nreport regarding the consideration by the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly of the proposal to\r\ntransfer the Cartographic Section from the Department\r\nof Public Information to the Department of\r\nPeacekeeping Operations, as had been repeatedly\r\ndiscussed and provisionally approved at Committee on\r\nInformation meetings.\r\nWe support the process of rationalizing the\r\nnetwork of United Nations information centres around\r\nregional hubs, in keeping with General Assembly\r\nresolution 57/300. We believe it is important that the\r\nfunds that are thus saved should be used to address\r\nimportant and priority tasks of the Department of\r\nPublic Information.\r\nWe also continue to follow closely the efforts of\r\nthe Department to improve and optimize United\r\nNations libraries in the light of the specifics of their\r\nwork at different duty stations. We support the\r\nestablishment, in March 2003, of the Steering\r\nCommittee for the Modernization and Integrated\r\nManagement of United Nations Libraries, which is\r\ncalled upon to draft concrete recommendations with a\r\nview to increasing efficiency and accessibility of the\r\nUnited Nations library system. We await a detailed\r\nreport on the implementation process of specific\r\ninitiatives that are being worked out by the members of\r\nthe Steering Committee during their quarterly\r\nmeetings.\r\nRegarding section III, on streamlining\r\npublications and reports, we appreciate the real\r\nimprovements made in this area. Given the specifics of\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report on oceans and the law of\r\nthe sea, which actually serves as a unique reference for\r\nall issues of cooperation among States in maritime\r\naffairs over the past year, we propose to maintain the\r\npractice of publishing this report above and beyond the\r\nlimits established by the Secretariat for publishing this\r\ntype of document.\r\nAs for strengthening the effectiveness of the\r\nUnited Nations presence in developing countries, it\r\nshould be kept in mind that measures of United Nations\r\noperational agencies in this area, as reflected in the\r\nrelevant chapter of the report, are regularly examined\r\nat the sessions of the Economic and Social Council and\r\nof the executive boards of relevant programmes and\r\nfunds, such as the United Nations Development Fund,\r\nthe United Nations Population Fund and the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund, and approved by their\r\nresolutions and decisions. Agreed approaches of the\r\nMember States to these issues have been reflected\r\nparticularly in the resolutions of the operative segment\r\nof the 2003 Economic and Social Council regular\r\nsession.\r\nIt seems appropriate to continue the discussion on\r\nthese topics within that type of format. Support should\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nbe given to measures to simplify and agree on\r\nprogramming instruments aimed, inter alia, at reducing\r\ntransaction costs for recipient countries, particularly\r\nthe United Nations Development Assistance\r\nFramework results matrix, and streamlining tools for\r\nevaluation and reporting.\r\nWith respect to strengthening the resident\r\ncoordinator system, greater participation of United\r\nNations specialized and technical agencies in the\r\nfunctioning of this system is generally regarded by\r\nMember States as a step towards improvement.\r\nHowever, the task of balanced representation of United\r\nNations organizations among the posts of resident\r\ncoordinators should not become a goal in itself: the\r\ncandidature of resident coordinators, beyond the purely\r\nprofessional requirements, in terms of involvement in a\r\ngiven United Nations system agency should be\r\nconsistent with priority areas of cooperation with a\r\ngiven country and the United Nations.\r\nWith regard to strengthening the Department of\r\nEconomic and Social Affairs, we support the\r\nestablishment of the Financing for Development Office\r\nand the Office for Economic and Social Council\r\nSupport and Coordination. With regard to the proposal\r\nto divide the main divisions of the Department into two\r\nclusters, each reporting to an Assistant Secretary-\r\nGeneral, one focusing primarily on data analysis and\r\ninformation and the other on support for\r\nintergovernmental processes in the various policy\r\nareas, as well as in the context of meeting-related\r\noperational responsibilities, it is important to decide\r\nhow the coordination and interaction of these clusters\r\ncan be implemented. The intended strengthening of the\r\nDepartment could also be used to strengthen the\r\npotential of the United Nations Forum on Forests.\r\nWe welcome the establishment of the Office of\r\nthe Under-Secretary-General and Special Adviser on\r\nAfrica, and we look forward to the efficient work of\r\nthat new entity. In the area of promoting partnerships,\r\nwe support efforts aimed at expanding United Nations\r\ncooperation with the private sector, and particularly the\r\nestablishment of a partnership office, which will\r\ncomprise the Global Compact Office and the United\r\nNations Fund for International Partnerships. We\r\nwelcome cooperation between the office and the\r\nnetwork of private-sector focal points throughout the\r\nUnited Nations system. We support the active\r\npromotion of partnership initiatives at the national,\r\nregional and international levels.\r\nNevertheless, we believe it essential that our main\r\nfocus of attention be placed on practical\r\nimplementation of the outcomes of the recent United\r\nNations summits and conferences. The attainment of\r\nthose goals is the principal objective for all partners —\r\nGovernments, international organizations, business and\r\nnon-governmental organizations — and it is also their\r\ncommon responsibility, especially given their extensive\r\ninvolvement in preparing for and holding such forums\r\nand in drafting their decisions. In that regard, we\r\nbelieve it important that non-governmental\r\norganizations have an opportunity to share their\r\nexperience in participating in implementing the\r\noutcomes of those conferences and to properly evaluate\r\ntheir respective practical measures in that area. The\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat should envisage the most\r\neffective format possible for such a dialogue among\r\ncivil society representatives.\r\nWith respect to United Nations administrative and\r\nbudgetary reform, its focus will depend on Member\r\nStates’ decisions on a number of additional reports by\r\nthe Secretariat regarding changes in the United Nations\r\nplanning and budgeting process. For the time being, we\r\nshould like to assess positively the improvements\r\nalready made in the structure and format of the regular\r\ndraft budgets and the draft budgets for peacekeeping\r\noperations. Any changes in United Nations personnel\r\npolicy — inter alia, enhanced conditions of service or\r\nrevised mechanisms to promote mobility — should, in\r\nour view, be in line with relevant General Assembly\r\ndecisions in that area.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to note that the\r\nRussian Federation is prepared to participate\r\nconstructively and actively in consultations on this\r\nagenda item in order to reach agreed and balanced\r\ndecisions.\r\nMr. Apata (Nigeria): I wish to express the\r\ndelegation of Nigeria’s appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his initiatives and efforts\r\naimed at strengthening the United Nations. His efforts\r\nare consistent with the decisions and declarations of the\r\nMillennium Summit, at which our leaders pledged to\r\nmake the United Nations a more effective institution\r\nfor the promotion of world peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. We should also like to pay special tribute\r\nto the Deputy Secretary-General, Ms. Louise Fréchette,\r\nfor her outstanding work on that issue during the fifty-\r\nseventh session.\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nUndoubtedly, significant progress has been made\r\nin the area of peace and security in the past five years.\r\nAs a result, the United Nations is seen globally as an\r\nOrganization dedicated to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, and Nigeria welcomes\r\nthat. The reorganization and enhancement of the\r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations, following the\r\nconsideration and review of the Brahimi report, has\r\nresulted in improvement in the capacity of the United\r\nNations to deploy and manage complex peacekeeping\r\nand peace-building operations. In that regard, Sierra\r\nLeone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and,\r\nmost recently, Liberia — where the United Nations\r\neffectively took over peacekeeping operations from the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States — are\r\nsuccess stories. We welcome and support the\r\nintroduction of the rule of law, gender mainstreaming\r\nand a multidimensional approach to peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nGiven that the Millennium Development Goals\r\nemphasized the imperativeness of sustainable\r\ndevelopment through poverty eradication, the United\r\nNations should rededicate its energies to addressing the\r\nproblems of hunger, malnutrition and diseases,\r\nespecially the HIV/AIDS pandemic, malaria and\r\ntuberculosis. Nigeria would like the United Nations\r\nand the rest of the international community to show the\r\nsame commitment that they have demonstrated in the\r\narea of peace and security to promoting social and\r\neconomic development. The targets we set for\r\nourselves in the Millennium Declaration are very far-\r\nreaching. The year 2015 may seem far away. The\r\nreality is that, if we are to achieve the targets of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, we need to radically\r\nshift our focus and to commence the rapid\r\nimplementation of the Goals and the outcomes of the\r\nJohannesburg and Monterrey summits. That is the great\r\nchallenge facing the Organization today.\r\nSince we cannot afford a United Nations with a\r\nmajority of Members that are incapacitated by the\r\nstaggering external debt crisis, the United Nations\r\nshould explore avenues of resolving the crippling debt\r\nproblem. We observe that, in 2002, the total debt of\r\ndeveloping countries and countries with economies in\r\ntransition increased by approximately $52 billion,\r\nwhile official capital flows to developing countries\r\nhave witnessed a steady decline. It is estimated that in\r\n2003, developing countries will spend $350 billion on\r\ntheir external debt burdens. In that regard, we cannot\r\nbut agree with the Secretary-General\u0027s view that\r\n\"reaching the Millennium Development Goals requires\r\nan increase in external financing from official sources,\r\nin addition to debt relief” (A/58/290, para. 41). We\r\ntherefore urge that the problem of external debt be\r\naddressed with creativity, innovation, greater flexibility\r\nand a debt rescue strategy.\r\nAnother area where the United Nations can\r\nplay — and indeed is already playing — a\r\ncommendable role is in building strong partnerships. In\r\nthat regard, we endorse the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendation to establish a high-level panel of\r\neminent personalities that would, among other things,\r\nexamine the current challenges to peace and security,\r\nconsider the contributions that collective action can\r\nmake in addressing those challenges and review the\r\nfunctioning of the major organs of the United Nations\r\nand the relationships between them. We would consider\r\nthe establishment of the panel to be yet another\r\nmilestone in United Nations efforts to reach out to the\r\nwider society in search of solutions to strengthen the\r\nOrganization.\r\nNigeria welcomes the partnerships between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional and subregional\r\norganizations, and non-State actors, such as civil\r\nsociety organizations, interest groups, universities and\r\nindividuals. In that regard, we note with satisfaction\r\nthat individual businesses as well as business\r\norganizations were given the opportunity to be\r\nformally accredited to the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development and its Preparatory\r\nCommittee, and that business representatives made\r\npolicy proposals for discussion with Governments and\r\ninternational organizations. Exchanging policies and\r\nstrategies with the organized private sector is\r\nappropriate, correct and consistent with the objectives\r\nof the Millennium Declaration. It should therefore be\r\ncontinued. Given these positive developments, Nigeria\r\nbelieves that the United Nations has positioned itself to\r\nmonitor and follow up these partnerships.\r\nWe note that the 2004-2005 budget proposals\r\nreflected a number of measures aimed at strengthening\r\nthe Department of Economic and Social Affairs,\r\nespecially its management capacity. We welcome the\r\nproposals in the budget outlining the realignment of the\r\nentire Department in accordance with the new\r\nmandates arising from the Millennium Declaration, the\r\nMonterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nAction, taking into account the decision of the General\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nAssembly on the integrated and coordinated\r\nimplementation of the outcomes of other major United\r\nNations conferences and summits.\r\nAlthough the Office of the Special Adviser on\r\nAfrica was established last May, within the past six\r\nmonths it has made significant contributions to the\r\npromotion of the objectives of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). We commend the\r\nquality of reports that the Office presented during the\r\nGeneral Assembly debate on NEPAD, as well as its\r\nefforts at galvanizing the international community’s\r\nsupport for NEPAD. We now need to provide adequate\r\nresources to enable the Office to meet the obligations\r\nof its mandate.\r\nWe commend you, Mr. President, for having\r\ninitiated, very early in this session, the process of\r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly. Nigeria commends\r\nthe proposals in the non-paper that you submitted for\r\nthe informal consultations of the General Assembly.\r\nWe associate ourselves with the views expressed by the\r\ndelegation of Algeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement and by the delegation of the Kingdom of\r\nMorocco on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nIt is important to acknowledge that, since the\r\nfifty-fifth session, we have taken important steps —\r\nalbeit modest ones — in our collective efforts to\r\nrevamp the General Assembly. In this connection,\r\nNigeria wishes to pay special tribute to the Presidents\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth, fifty-sixth\r\nand fifty-seventh sessions and their facilitators for\r\nhaving deployed their best efforts on this very vital\r\nissue. Undoubtedly their contributions and efforts\r\ncontributed immensely to the success achieved so far,\r\nparticularly in the clustering of a number of agenda\r\nitems and the election ahead of time of the president of\r\nthe General Assembly and the principal officers of the\r\nCommittees. We now need to focus on how to\r\nstrengthen the Office of the President of the General\r\nAssembly and on the reform of our agenda.\r\nNigeria has always maintained that any Member\r\nState should be able to aspire to the highest office of\r\nthis important organ. Yet it has been consistently\r\nmanifest in the past 10 years that the holders of that\r\noffice have had to deploy enormous resources from\r\ntheir capitals to assist them in discharging their\r\nresponsibilities. The implication is that States that are\r\nnot endowed with such resources will hesitate in\r\noffering the services of their nationals for this\r\nimportant assignment. In fact, it would be difficult for\r\nmany Member States, particularly the least developed\r\ncountries — many of which are from our continent —\r\nto offer a services of their nationals for this important\r\noffice because of that constraint. Are we not by\r\nimplication disenfranchising them? Are we also not\r\npreventing the General Assembly from being a bastion\r\nof democratic ideals in which both the powerful and\r\nthe not-so-powerful have equal rights and aspirations?\r\nIt is therefore imperative for us to move rapidly at\r\nthe current session towards adopting measures that\r\nwould strengthen the Office of the President, such as\r\nby creating a number of staff positions for that Office.\r\nSuch a decision will effectively remove the need for\r\npresidents of the General Assembly to bring senior\r\nofficials from their capitals to assist them in the\r\ndischarge of their important responsibilities. That\r\nwould also enhance the institutional memory of the\r\noffice.\r\nWith respect to the issue of the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Nigeria urges the president to hold\r\nregular and intensive discussions with the chairpersons\r\nof regional groups, as well as with Member States\r\nconcerned, on how to resolve the problem. We should\r\nconsider, for example, the establishment of special list\r\nof reserve items, without prejudice to the ability of\r\nMember States to bring up issues whenever they so\r\ndesire. Another important way of strengthening the\r\nGeneral Assembly would be to ensure that its decisions\r\nare implemented. Nigeria would like the Secretariat to\r\nbe mandated to provide Member States, every four\r\nyears, with a list of the Assembly’s decisions and\r\nresolutions, and the level of their implementation. Such\r\na measure would assist us in evaluating our\r\nperformance — or, indeed, our non-performance.\r\nOn the reform and restructuring of the work of\r\nthe Main Committees, Nigeria holds the view that no\r\nCommittee should be singled out for reform, since the\r\ntasks of all the Committees are linked and interwoven.\r\nConsequently, the reform of the Main Committees\r\nshould be carried out in a holistic manner.\r\nIn conclusion, Nigeria believes that the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations and the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly should be seen\r\nas a work in progress. Nigeria reaffirms its support for\r\nefforts aimed at strengthening the entire United\r\nNations, and assures the Secretary-General of our\r\ncontinued active participation in the process.\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nMr. Mahiga (United Republic of Tanzania): My\r\ndelegation joins others in acknowledging your ongoing\r\nspirited initiative, Mr. President, to advance the debate\r\non revitalizing the General Assembly in the context of\r\nthe overarching agenda of the reform of the United\r\nNations. It is a timely and commendable initiative. My\r\ndelegation fully associates itself with the statements on\r\nthis subject made by the Permanent Representative of\r\nAlgeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, and\r\nby the Permanent Representative of the Kingdom of\r\nMorocco on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nWe attach great importance to the statements\r\nmade by regional groups on this important subject of\r\nthe reform of the United Nations and its organs. The\r\nviews expressed in those statements are a synthesis of\r\nthe views of the various groups of States and reflect the\r\nongoing thinking and perceptions of the Member States\r\nin various regions of the world with regard to this\r\nOrganization. This is a democratic method of\r\nrepresenting States and providing inputs for the reform\r\nprocess and of collating and accommodating the\r\ndiverse views of the shared vision of the 191 Members\r\nof this world body.\r\nMy country fully supports the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General to reform the United Nations and is\r\nready to provide maximum support for his endeavours.\r\nThe debate on reforms has been going on for nearly a\r\ndecade. It has gathered greater momentum in the past\r\nfive years, generating a wealth of implementable ideas.\r\nIn the meantime, new developments and trends have\r\nemerged in the international community as challenges\r\nto the United Nations that require an urgent response\r\non the part of the Organization, which is the repository\r\nof the collective will of its entire membership.\r\nThe pace of the emerging global developments\r\nand challenges is overtaking the pace of the reform of\r\nthe Organization and the capacity of this institution to\r\nadequately cope with the changes. Indeed, the reforms\r\nare long overdue and need to be effected sooner, rather\r\nthan later, so as to enable existing institutions to\r\nremain relevant and focused on the challenges.\r\nGlobalization, new conventional and\r\nunconventional methods of warfare, global epidemics,\r\nthe realization of the Millennium Declaration and other\r\ngoals that we have set ourselves, are but a few of the\r\narray of challenges which demand prompt responses by\r\nthe United Nations system and other multilateral\r\norganizations.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the initiative of the\r\nSecretary-General to establish a Panel Of Eminent\r\nPersons to make recommendations on the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations. We trust this will bring added value to\r\nexisting proposals, some of which are already\r\namenable to implementation and only require the\r\ngalvanized political will of the Member States.\r\nA key shortcoming in the revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is the delay in implementation or\r\nnon-implementation of its resolutions on revitalization\r\nthat have already been adopted, as well as of other\r\nresolutions which the Assembly, as the policy-making\r\nbody of the United Nations, has adopted in the course\r\nof its work. There is an urgent need holistically to link\r\npolicy-making, decision-making and implementation,\r\nas stipulated in Chapter IV of the United Nations\r\nCharter on the mandate of the General Assembly.\r\nEqually important is the follow-up to conferences and\r\nmeetings arising from resolutions of this Assembly,\r\nwhich ought to be centred on performance and results\r\nrather than on processes and proceedings on their\r\nreports. Such an approach would provide benchmarks\r\nfor evaluating progress and expediting the effective\r\nimplementation of General Assembly resolutions.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome your proposals, Sir,\r\non enhancing the role of the President and the\r\npresidency, the creation of the Bureau of the Assembly\r\nand giving the General Committee that role. This will\r\npermit close follow-up to and evaluation of the\r\nimplementation process, and strengthening and\r\nstreamlining the working relationship between the\r\nPresidency and the Secretariat, as well as that between\r\nthe General Assembly and other organs of the\r\nOrganization, including the Security Council, as\r\nstipulated in the Charter.\r\nIt is important, therefore, that the revitalization of\r\nthe General Assembly be accomplished simultaneously\r\nwith reforms in the other organs of the Organization in\r\norder to coordinate and synchronize the overall reform\r\nprocess in a transparent manner. Of particular\r\nsignificance in enhancing the authority of the General\r\nAssembly is making better use of its decision-making\r\npower in budgetary matters, as elaborated in the\r\nstatement of the Group of 77 and China. It is also\r\nequally essential that the relationship between and\r\nresponsibilities of the other General Assembly\r\nCommittees be reviewed to enable the Assembly to\r\nexercise its central role vis-à-vis the Committees in\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\norder to streamline the coverage of related issues and\r\nagenda items, as deemed appropriate by the presidency.\r\nConsiderable effort has been made to rationalize\r\nthe working methods of the General Assembly, such as\r\ndocumentation procedures, reorganization of agenda\r\nitems, methodology of drafting and presenting\r\nresolutions, and time allocation for debates. However,\r\nrationalization should be seen as a prerequisite to\r\nrevitalization of the Assembly, as well as an outcome\r\nof improvements in the methods of work arising from\r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly. As the\r\nrevitalization task is accomplished, the needed working\r\nmethods would be addressed accordingly. Reform has\r\nto be a continuous process. It may be necessary as an\r\noutcome of this exercise to establish a timetable for\r\ninitiating reform and revitalization measures that are\r\nevidently feasible and could proceed after receiving the\r\nendorsement of Member States.\r\nFinally, the General Assembly has the whole\r\npopulace of this globe as its constituency. With rapid\r\nadvances in information technology, more and more\r\nsectors of civil society in our respective countries are\r\nfollowing what is being done at the United Nations to\r\naddress issues of common concern and interest to them,\r\nsuch as peace, security and their overall socio-\r\neconomic well-being as citizens of this world. The\r\nreforms of the United Nations should, in collaboration\r\nwith States, also include the strengthening of outreach\r\nactivities to the peoples of the world, not only to\r\nenhance its visibility, accountability and trust by the\r\nnations of the world at large, but above all to recognize\r\nthe ownership of this multilateral body by we, the\r\npeoples of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nAt the outset, please allow me to express my\r\nappreciation to you, Sir, for holding this important\r\nmeeting and for the informal note you issued not long\r\nago. The note provides a good basis for our\r\ndiscussions. I also wish to thank Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral Fréchette for her statement.\r\nThe Chinese delegation believes that the United\r\nNations should keep pace with the times and reinforce\r\nthe reform process so as to meet the needs of the new\r\ncircumstances. We are pleased to note that the General\r\nAssembly has made reform one of its top priorities at\r\nthis session and we highly commend the active role of\r\nPresident Hunte in that regard. We also commend the\r\ninitiative of Secretary-General to establish the Panel Of\r\nEminent Persons on United Nations Relations with\r\nCivil Society. I wish to emphasize the following points\r\non the revitalization of the work of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nAccording to the Charter, the General Assembly\r\nis one of the most important organs of the\r\nOrganization. It is the main venue at which all Member\r\nStates may review and make decisions on such major\r\nissues as the maintenance of peace and security, the\r\npromotion of economic and social development and the\r\nstrengthening of the international legal system. Its\r\nimportance, broad representation and authority are\r\nindisputable.\r\nCurrently, the United Nations is facing\r\nunprecedented challenges in all fields. Terrorist threats\r\nare increasing unabated, regional conflicts are\r\nincessant, development issues remain acute and\r\nenvironmental protection still constitutes an arduous\r\ntask. Furthermore, the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, the spread of communicable diseases and\r\nother new problems also call for appropriate solutions.\r\nThe international community ardently hopes to see a\r\nstronger role of the United Nations so that it can serve\r\nas an effective mechanism in coordinating national\r\nefforts and can better respond to new threats and\r\nchallenges.\r\nA revitalized General Assembly will help\r\nstrengthen the determination of Member States to\r\npursue multilateralism, which will in turn have a major\r\nand far-reaching impact on rebuilding the authority and\r\ncredibility of the United Nations system as a whole.\r\nDiscussions on this subject have been going on for 11\r\nyears, since the forty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly, and progress has been made in some areas.\r\nHowever, frankly speaking, it still falls far short of the\r\naspirations and expectations of the vast number of\r\nMember States. The revitalization of the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly bears on the interests of each and\r\nevery Member State and on the future role of the\r\nUnited Nations. All of us must therefore have a strong\r\nsense of urgency.\r\nThe Chinese delegation fully endorses President\r\nHunte’s proposal to focus our discussions on two broad\r\nareas: enhancing the authority and role of the General\r\nAssembly and improving its working methods. We look\r\nforward to early substantial progress that will instil\r\ngreater vitality in the General Assembly and enable it\r\nto play a more effective role in maintaining peace and\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\npromoting development. To that end, it is necessary\r\nfully to solicit the views of the Member States,\r\nespecially the developing countries, and to start with\r\neasier issues in order to reach consensus.\r\nWith respect to strengthening the authority and\r\nrole of the General Assembly, the Chinese delegation\r\nholds that the relationship between the General\r\nAssembly and other principal organs, including the\r\nSecurity Council, is not one of competition and\r\nexclusion. Instead, it is one of cooperation and\r\ncomplementarity. We are in favour of enhancing the\r\ninteraction between the General Assembly and other\r\nprincipal organs such as the Security Council and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nWe embrace the idea of choosing a theme for\r\neach session of the General Assembly, on the basis of\r\nprior consultations among Member States, in order to\r\nmake the general debate more focused. We are also in\r\nfavour of launching a regular review of resolutions\r\nadopted and decisions made previously by the\r\nAssembly and of making necessary adjustments or\r\ndeletions according to the outcome of the review.\r\nWe support making earnest efforts to strengthen\r\nthe function of the Office of the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in terms of both human and\r\nfinancial resources. We believe it is necessary to\r\nestablish a contact mechanism between the previous,\r\nthe incumbent and the succeeding presidents to ensure\r\ncontinuity and consistency in the work of the\r\nAssembly. We also hope that each newly elected\r\npresident will draw up recommendations for work\r\npriorities as early as possible.\r\nWe deem it a positive suggestion that the\r\nDepartment of Public Information be authorized to\r\nprepare an annual plan of action for each session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. This should be approved and\r\nimplemented at an early date, while, at the same time,\r\navoiding redundancy and waste.\r\nOn improving the working methods of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Mr. President, you yourself,\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and representatives of\r\nMember States have put forward many constructive\r\nsuggestions. What we need now is speedy action.\r\nFirst, it is necessary to rationalize and streamline\r\nthe agenda of the General Assembly. Some items can\r\nbe considered in clusters or biannually. It is also\r\nnecessary to schedule the consideration of items in a\r\nmore balanced manner; some items can be discussed\r\nafter the September to December period.\r\nSecondly, practical solutions need to be found\r\nwith respect to the overflow of documents. On the one\r\nhand, Member States should try not to request reports\r\nfrom the Secretary-General on every single issue, and\r\non the other, the Secretariat should improve the quality\r\nof the reports with more focused analyses and more\r\noperable recommendations. The length of reports\r\nshould also be drastically reduced and we request the\r\nSecretariat to work out some effective measures in that\r\nregard.\r\nThirdly, it is necessary to cluster the agenda items\r\nof the General Assembly and the Main Committees to\r\ndefine their focus and avoid repeated deliberation.\r\nThere should be strengthened coordination in this\r\nregard among the president of the General Assembly,\r\nthe chairs of the Main Committees and the\r\nrepresentatives of the Secretary-General.\r\nFourthly, it is necessary to reinforce the function\r\nand mandate of the General Committee for a more\r\neffective operation of the General Assembly and the\r\nMain Committees. We recommend that the General\r\nCommittee, taking into account the present situation\r\nand the wishes of most Member States, adopt specific\r\nmeasures to improve the procedures for submitting and\r\nfinalizing agenda items, thus saving time and energy\r\nfor both the Member States and the Secretariat.\r\nFinally, it is necessary to proceed from actual\r\nneeds and take the initiative to enhance exchanges with\r\nother institutions and civil society in various related\r\nareas so as to make good use of their resources.\r\nAll Member States have great expectations\r\nregarding the revitalization of the work of the General\r\nAssembly, and President Hunte has demonstrated\r\noutstanding talents of leadership. We are now at a most\r\nopportune moment for making tangible progress. An\r\nancient Chinese saying declares that “The sails on the\r\nboat are all set, all we need now is the right wind.” We\r\nare confident that as long as the Member States can be\r\nguided by common interests, show strong political will\r\nand promote the reform process in a spirit of\r\ninnovation and inclusion, the revitalization effort will\r\nsoon bear fruit. Let us all join hands to this end.\r\nMr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan): Today we\r\nconsider a cluster of items dealing with the\r\nrestructuring and reform of the United Nations and the\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, which are\r\nhighly important in the context of the current global\r\nenvironment.\r\nIn his reports, the Secretary-General has\r\nconsistently pointed out that, in order to make our\r\nOrganization more effective, efficient and dedicated to\r\nworking for the benefit of the peoples of the world, we\r\nmust be well prepared to change with the times,\r\nconstantly adjusting to new realities and new\r\nchallenges. The need for a strong multilateral\r\ninstitution has never been more acutely felt than in this\r\nyear that has been characterized by continuing\r\nglobalization.\r\nWe fully support the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral concerning the establishment of a high-level\r\npanel to review the functioning of the United Nations\r\nsystem. As other delegations, we do believe, however,\r\nthat the work of revitalization and reform should be\r\ncontinued next year without waiting for the panel’s\r\nrecommendations.\r\nIt is imperative to strengthen the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the social and economic areas. In our\r\nview, reforms should help the United Nations energize\r\ninternational cooperation in the follow-up to the\r\noutcomes of the major international conferences and\r\nsummits held under its auspices. We believe that an\r\nimplementation review process should be used to\r\nreaffirm the goals and objectives agreed upon at\r\nconferences and summits and to identify obstacles and\r\nconstraints as well as actions and initiatives to\r\novercome these.\r\nIn this context, a major event in 2005 to review\r\nthe progress achieved in implementing all the\r\ncommitments made in the Millennium Declaration, as\r\nreferred to by the General Assembly in its resolution\r\n57/270 B, would hopefully contribute to that process.\r\nIn our view, coordination between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations should be\r\nreinvigorated. In this context, Kazakhstan proposes\r\nestablishing a permanent council of regional\r\norganizations under the authority of United Nations\r\nSecretary-General. We believe that in order to make\r\nour Organization stronger, we should tune up the\r\nintergovernmental machinery and improve the methods\r\nof work of, most notably, the General Assembly, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Security Council.\r\nThe revitalization of the agendas of these bodies,\r\ncoupled with better working methods, would be an\r\nessential step towards turning the United Nations as a\r\nwhole into a more efficient tool.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the initiative of the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly concerning the\r\nprovision of a framework for the revitalization of the\r\nAssembly, which is the heart of the reform of our\r\nOrganization. We must direct our attention to the\r\nconsideration of measures to improve its working\r\nmethods because we do need an Assembly that is a\r\nmore efficient, more focused and more relevant body.\r\nThe first step in this direction, according to our vision,\r\nis the strengthening of the Office of the President of\r\nthe General Assembly, whose role in the whole\r\nexercise is indispensable. We believe that these specific\r\nsteps would enhance the role of the Assembly and\r\nincrease its efficiency and effectiveness.\r\nMy delegation recognizes that some progress has\r\nbeen made in streamlining the agenda of the Assembly.\r\nWe need to optimize it still further because some items\r\ndo not require consideration on an annual basis. Also,\r\nitems on which discussion has been deferred for a\r\nnumber of years must be deleted altogether.\r\nWe believe that debates in the plenary and in the\r\nMain Committees could be more interactive if they\r\nfocused on a limited number of key issues of common\r\ninterest. We must also make practical improvements\r\nwith respect to resolutions. They could be shorter, more\r\nfocused and meaningful. Their implementation must be\r\nmonitored in an effective way.\r\nThe open-ended informal consultations on the\r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly,\r\nconvened by the President, have provided an\r\nopportunity to have an extensive exchange of views\r\nand have laid the ground for the present plenary\r\nmeeting. We agree with the proposal to hold informal\r\nconsultations, breaking down the issues into two broad\r\nsubjects — enhancing the authority and role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and improving its working methods.\r\nAs for the Security Council, it is obvious that the\r\nconditions that determined its composition and\r\nprocedures have changed dramatically. Kazakhstan\r\nsupports the proposal to convene a high-level meeting\r\nregarding the reform of that principal body responsible\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nAnother main United Nations body, the Economic\r\nand Social Council, must be more effective in the area\r\nof coordinating the activities of the United Nations\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nspecialized agencies. In this regard, it is essential to\r\ndevise clear guidelines with respect to the reform of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council could also be\r\nmore effective in strengthening cooperation with the\r\nBretton Woods institutions in order to give them an\r\nadditional impetus. It is time to combine, in practical\r\nterms, the efforts of the United Nations, the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO) and other leading economic\r\nand financial organizations to address poverty and\r\nsocial development.\r\nIntroducing a second set of United Nations\r\nreforms at the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly, the Secretary-General proposed a\r\ncomprehensive review of our programme of work,\r\ndevoting our attention to the priorities established in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration. We commend the\r\nSecretary-General for paying close attention to\r\nresource allocation. His proposal to cut the medium-\r\nterm plan to two years would enable review bodies to\r\ntake a more strategic approach to the work of the\r\nOrganization and its resources. We approach the\r\nbudgetary reform process in a positive manner and my\r\ndelegation is ready to work with other delegations in\r\norder to make sure that far-reaching decisions are\r\nadopted at the current session.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate\r\nKazakhstan’s commitment to the United Nations\r\nreform process with a view to ensuring a safer and just\r\nworld order. We fully share the Secretary-General’s\r\nsense of urgency when it comes to structural changes\r\nwithin the United Nations. The United Nations can be\r\nstrong if all Member States give their full support to\r\nthe Secretary-General’s reform initiatives. Kazakhstan\r\nstands ready to contribute to making the Organization\r\nmore responsive to the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nMr. Mahbubani (Singapore): Let me begin by\r\noffering you my congratulations on organizing this\r\njoint debate. It is clear from the speeches we have\r\nheard so far that there is new energy regarding this\r\nissue and I think you, Sir, have done more than anyone\r\nelse to revive a subject that has been drifting around\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nI want to mention in particular the speeches by\r\nAlgeria and Morocco on behalf of Non-Aligned\r\nMovement and Group of 77. I thought there were also\r\nsignificant statements made by the delegations of Japan\r\nand the United States. I want to thank my colleague\r\nfrom Japan for referring to the four criteria we had\r\nmentioned; we appreciate that.\r\nBut I want to mention in particular the statement\r\nmade by the United States delegation in which it spoke\r\nof seven principles that should guide our reform work.\r\nAnd indeed, if I may say something at the very outset\r\nto illustrate the problem that we face, we have a new\r\nstatement and new principles. It is in the nature of this\r\nroom that we do not talk to each other and do not refer\r\nto each other’s statements and that indicates the\r\nproblem that we have. But the reason why we wanted\r\nto highlight the principles mentioned by the United\r\nStates — responsibility, accountability, effectiveness,\r\nstewardship of financial resources, modernization,\r\ncredibility and freedom — is because we believe that\r\nthese are useful principles to look at. We certainly\r\nsupport the principle of accountability, and if we can,\r\nindeed, in some way embed the principle of\r\naccountability into every dimension of the United\r\nNations work, whether it is in the Secretariat, the\r\nSecurity Council, or the General Assembly, then I say\r\nhalf the problem is solved.\r\nWhat I propose to do today, in the hope of\r\nmaking a helpful contribution, is to make four points.\r\nThe first point poses the question of whether the non-\r\nrevitalized General Assembly — I am not quite sure\r\nhow you describe a non-revitalized General Assembly,\r\nperhaps a stagnant or a floundering General\r\nAssembly — is the problem, or a symptom of a larger\r\nproblem? The second point asks: what are the real root\r\ncauses, to use a favourite United Nations word, of a\r\nfloundering General Assembly? The third point asks:\r\nwhat are the real solutions for revitalizing the General\r\nAssembly? And finally, I will try to mention a few\r\npoints of detail that have come up in the debate so far.\r\nThe first point: is it the General Assembly that is\r\nlost or the United Nations as an Organization that is\r\nlost? I would like to suggest that we should consider\r\nthe possibility that perhaps it is the Organization as a\r\nwhole, and not just the General Assembly, that is lost.\r\nThe best way of illustrating this situation is to ask\r\nourselves what a visitor from another planet, from, say,\r\nMars, would see if he visited planet Earth for the first\r\ntime. If he went around the globe, he would see a very\r\ndynamic globe where change is taking place every day,\r\neven as we speak. We live indeed in one of the most\r\ninteresting moments in history. But if this visitor from\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nMars asked to be taken to the centre of global issues\r\nand was brought into this room and was told “this is\r\nthe centre of global issues,” he would be quite puzzled\r\nwith, on the one hand, the dynamism of the world out\r\nthere and, on the other, the sleepiness of this room in\r\nhere. This in some ways indicates that the Organization\r\nas whole may be part of the problem.\r\nOf course, to be fair, some parts of this\r\nOrganization are working, such as the peacekeeping\r\noperations or the norm creation exercises. There is\r\nmuch valuable work being done by the Organization.\r\nBut if you look at it objectively as an Organization\r\ncreated in 1945, and you ask yourself whether this\r\nOrganization has adapted to the year 2003, the simple\r\nand honest answer is that it has not, and that may be\r\npart of the root cause of the problem that we face.\r\nThis is why we support the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposals to set up an group of eminent persons,\r\nbecause we believe the time has come to take a\r\ncomprehensive look at the Organization as a whole and\r\nto figure out how we can make sure that it survives the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nIn the spirit of referring to other points made in\r\nthe debate, I want to say here that I thought our\r\ncolleague from Bangladesh made an important point\r\nwhen he said that the selection of the eminent person’s\r\ngroup is important. I hope that it will not be based just\r\non eminence, but also on ability to contribute\r\nmeaningfully to the discussion.\r\nSecond point: what are the root causes of the lack\r\nof vitality of this General Assembly? When I was a\r\nfacilitator, we focused on several procedure issues,\r\nsuch as electing the President earlier — and I am glad\r\nwe succeeded in doing this — trimming the agenda and\r\nclustering items. But it is quite clear that from the\r\ndiscussions that we have had, including the informal\r\ndiscussions you hosted, Mr. President, that perhaps\r\nlarger issues, and not purely procedure issues, are at\r\nstake when it comes to revitalizing the General\r\nAssembly. Let me just mention one example. In the\r\ninformal consultations that we had, one distinguished\r\nambassador said, if I remember his words correctly,\r\nthat the fundamental problem is that the Security\r\nCouncil is sucking the oxygen away from the General\r\nAssembly. I would say that that is a fair description of\r\nwhat has happened in this House. But the question is,\r\nwhy has this happened? Why has the Security Council\r\nsuccessfully sucked oxygen from the General\r\nAssembly?\r\nHere, unfortunately, I have to bring up a word\r\nthat is rarely used in this Hall but perhaps should be\r\nused more often, and this word, of course, is\r\ngeopolitics. When I served here in the 1980s, the\r\nreason why this Hall was full and why everyone would\r\ncome and listen to the debates is that the cold war was\r\non. Two super-Powers were competing for influence in\r\nthis room, and everyone was engaged.\r\nNow the cold war has ended, the geopolitical\r\nsituation has changed, and the Security Council has\r\nachieved its primacy. So in some ways the lack of\r\nvibrancy in this room is due not only to our actions\r\ninside it but also to the larger global forces that also\r\nflow through this Hall. We have to address the larger\r\ndimension.\r\nHere I want to quote from a report which I hope\r\nwill be read carefully in the context of the debate on\r\nrevitalization — I am referring, of course, to the report\r\n(A/57/836) that was circulated by the Dutch Permanent\r\nRepresentative at our meeting at the Greentree Estate\r\non 16 and 17 May 2003.\r\nRegarding the challenges faced by the General\r\nAssembly, the report states:\r\n“The General Assembly faces two primary\r\nchallenges that threaten its — and the United\r\nNations — credibility and legitimacy as global\r\narbiter and decision maker. The first, policy-level,\r\nchallenge is the chronic, and increasingly acute,\r\ngap between issues of global import and\r\nrelevance and the way they are addressed by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Since the early 1990s, it has\r\nbeen increasingly hamstrung by the inability of\r\nmember States to situate the Assembly in the\r\npost-cold-war era.” (A/47/836, p. 3)\r\nI mention this because I think that we need to do a\r\nlarger analysis if we are to figure out the root causes of\r\nwhy we have to revitalize the General Assembly.\r\nLet me now turn to my third point, about the\r\nsolutions. I want to make a very important and\r\nfundamental point. If we are looking for the real\r\nsolutions to revitalize the General Assembly, we can do\r\nso only if we first have among ourselves — all 191\r\nMember States — a clear common understanding of\r\nwhat the causes are of the situation that we are in\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\ntoday. If we do not agree on the causes, we will not be\r\nable to find the solutions.\r\nIn my case, flowing from the remarks I made\r\nearlier about the root cause, I should like to suggest\r\nfour possible elements for solutions.\r\nThe first element, as I said, is that, if geopolitics\r\nis the problem, then geopolitics has to be made part of\r\nthe solution. Here, clearly, we in the General Assembly\r\nhave to engage the major Powers of the day and make\r\nthem feel that the General Assembly is an important\r\ninstrument that should be strengthened rather than\r\nweakened.\r\nHere, hopefully, I have one little bit of good\r\nnews. As a result of globalization, we all are now\r\nsailing in the same boat. Now that we are sailing in the\r\nsame boat, I think that the great Powers are also\r\nbeginning to realize that if one just takes care of one’s\r\nown cabin on the boat, one has not taken care of one’s\r\nproblems, because there are problems on the rest of the\r\nboat, and the problems in the other cabins are coming\r\ninto one’s own cabin.\r\nThere is now a new awareness among the major\r\nPowers that they have to, in a sense, find new solutions\r\nto the global problems of the day, and, if indeed that is\r\nthe new attitude, then the General Assembly can play a\r\nmajor role for the major Powers of the day.\r\nWith respect to the second possible solution, I\r\nthink that the time has come for the General Assembly\r\nto move away from a mechanical process of going\r\nthrough its agenda every year from September to\r\nDecember without asking itself, is this the real agenda\r\nthat the world is focusing on?\r\nHere let me just give me a simple example. On 2\r\nSeptember 2003, in document A/58/323, Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan described the dire situation of the\r\nUnited Nations. He noted, in paragraph 6, that “The\r\nvery relevance of current multilateral rules and\r\ninstitutions has come into question”. He further stated,\r\nin paragraph 13, that:\r\n“The United Nations finds itself at a critical\r\njuncture: unless the Security Council regains the\r\nconfidence of States and of world public opinion,\r\nindividual States will increasingly resort\r\nexclusively to their own national perceptions of\r\nemerging threats and to their own judgement on\r\nhow best to address them.”\r\nThese very strong statements were made by the\r\nSecretary-General in September this year. But if a\r\nsurvey were to be done of all the speeches and remarks\r\nmade in this Hall since that day, one would find that\r\nvery few of them refer to the issues of the day, and one\r\nwould ask oneself, “Why has this happened?”.\r\nClearly, we must in this Hall address real issues\r\nand not issues that have come up mechanically.\r\nThirdly, I would suggest that we need to change\r\nthe corporate culture of this Hall, of the Committees\r\nand, indeed, of the whole House. Whenever we meet,\r\nwe should stop delivering speeches in this Hall and\r\nshould start talking to each other, referring to each\r\nother’s speeches, and commenting on what other\r\nrepresentatives say, in the hope of developing an\r\nunderstanding. I believe and hope that this can be done.\r\nFourthly, I also believe, as I mentioned in\r\ninformal consultations, that each one of us must make a\r\ncalculation of how we balance our national interests\r\nand our collective interests. What I said in informal\r\nconsultations was that if our real goal is to promote the\r\ncollective interests of humankind as a whole, then this\r\nmeans that each one of us will have to sacrifice a little\r\nbit of our national interests if we are to promote the\r\ncollective interest. As I said, the collective interest is a\r\ncollection of national interests minus X.\r\nAgain, I will give a simple example. The agenda\r\nof the General Assembly is creaking under — some say\r\ndrowning in — the huge load of agenda items and\r\nresolutions that come up repetitively. But every time it\r\nis suggested that an agenda item be removed, or the\r\nnon-repetition of a resolution, one country will say that\r\nit has a very important interest in that particular\r\nresolution.\r\nIf each one of us adds to the burden of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and none of us lightens it, how can\r\nwe revitalize the Assembly?\r\nMy final point — and these are points of detail on\r\nseveral issues that have been raised — is on the\r\npresidency. We need strong leadership from a strong\r\nPresident, and you, Sir, frankly, have provided it very\r\nwell. I say that, I hope, objectively, because you are the\r\nfirst President to do a report on the debate on the report\r\nof the Security Council. Even though we had taken a\r\ndecision several years ago to prepare such a report, no\r\nother President did it. This shows the difference that a\r\ngood President can make.\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nWhile we are focused on important issues such as\r\nelecting the President early, providing more resources\r\nto the President’s Office — and these all are important\r\nissues — I hope that we will also sensitively and\r\ndelicately address the core issue, which is the selection\r\nof the President of the General Assembly. We must find\r\na way to ensure that this post is not seen — as,\r\nunfortunately, some countries view it — as a way of, in\r\na sense, planting someone in a retirement post. This\r\npost should be seen as an important and dynamic post\r\nin which work is done. The principle of meritocracy, I\r\nhope, will applied to the selection of the President.\r\nThe second major theme that has come up so far\r\nis on the question of the budget, and here the usual\r\nNorth-South tensions have emerged. These tensions\r\nare, in some ways, inevitable. They are inevitable\r\nbecause, on the one hand, the major contributors feel\r\nthat they should have more of a say in deciding how\r\nthe United Nations spends its money, which seems like\r\na very reasonable demand. But if you accept that\r\nprinciple, then you undermine the principle of\r\nsovereign equality on which the United Nations was\r\nfounded. And if you undermine the principle of\r\nsovereign equality, you take away a major pillar of the\r\nUnited Nations. That is one dimension of the problem.\r\nThe other part of the problem is that, if you allow\r\nthe countries that contribute very little to decide how\r\nmuch to spend, then effectively you are allowing the\r\nsmallest countries to impose taxes on the bigger\r\ncountries. You can do that for a while, but after a while\r\nthey will stop. So what we need on all discussions of\r\nthe budget — and this is not a financial question; this is\r\na political question — is a new political compact\r\nbetween the major contributors and the other countries,\r\nwhich are the major stakeholders of the United\r\nNations. We think it can be done and that it has to be\r\ndone.\r\nI would like to end on an optimistic rather than a\r\npessimistic note, and my optimistic note is this. This\r\nHall, even when it is quiet and empty and when it\r\nsometimes seems almost devoid of activity, controls\r\none of the world’s most valuable and precious\r\nresources. That resource is legitimacy. Indeed, if you\r\nwant to legitimize any global action, only the Members\r\nseated in this Hall can do it. Frankly speaking, even the\r\nlegitimacy that the Security Council enjoys is an\r\noffshoot of the legitimacy of the General Assembly,\r\nbecause if the General Assembly goes, then the\r\nSecurity Council will also go, because it cannot survive\r\non its own. Its legitimacy comes from the fact that 191\r\nMember States have ratified the Charter and have thus\r\nagreed to abide by its provisions. We believe that this\r\nlegitimacy is a valuable commodity that can be\r\nharnessed and used to promote many good global\r\ncauses; and if we, the Members in this Hall, find ways\r\nand means of harnessing this legitimacy, then I think\r\nwe will truly revive the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Kirn (Slovenia): It is not difficult to agree\r\nwith what the preceding speaker, Mr. Mahbubani, has\r\njust shared with us in his traditional manner of\r\naddressing this audience with very original and\r\nthought-provoking ideas. I myself also intend to raise\r\nthree issues that deal not so much with concrete\r\nsuggestions and substance — to which I will refer later\r\n— because I believe that we have an excellent paper\r\nbefore us. I would like briefly to raise some general\r\nissues to reflect what I suspect is a common concern\r\nexpressed during our meetings yesterday and today.\r\nLet me start by emphasizing that Slovenia fully\r\nassociates itself with the statement made yesterday by\r\nItaly on behalf of the European Union and the acceding\r\ncountries. In my national capacity and as a Vice-\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, I wish to address\r\nthe issue of the revitalization of the General Assembly\r\nin the context of broader United Nations reform.\r\nMy delegation shares the view that there is\r\nmomentum for change and that we have to seize the\r\nopportunity. That is what I wish to talk about, sharing\r\nsome thoughts with members. To my mind, at least\r\nthree factors support the view that there is momentum\r\nfor change.\r\nFirst, a great majority of speakers, including\r\nheads of State or Government and foreign ministers,\r\nraised the need for United Nations reform during the\r\ngeneral debate. A great many expressed political will\r\nin favour of United Nations reform. We see such views\r\nas representing the broad consensus among our leaders\r\nthat emerged during the general debate. We now need\r\nto build on that consensus in our further deliberations,\r\namong ourselves and among different regional groups.\r\nSecondly, as the President of Slovenia stated in\r\nhis speech in the general debate (see A/58/PV.13), a\r\nnumber of good ideas and proposals relating to the\r\nrevitalization and reform of the General Assembly have\r\nalready been identified and have the support of the\r\nmajority. Now we have to put them into practice.\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\nThe informal note on the revitalization of the\r\nwork of the General Assembly that you, Mr. President,\r\nhave shared with us is an excellent starting point for a\r\nwork plan on which I hope that we shall agree very\r\nsoon. Your informal note was well received and\r\nsupported during the open-ended informal\r\nconsultations held on 17 October 2003, as well as\r\nduring the General Assembly debate of yesterday and\r\ntoday.\r\nOn that basis, we believe that we can already\r\nmove towards decision-making at the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, as was also stated by\r\nthe representative of Italy on behalf of the European\r\nUnion. In doing that, my delegation believes that we\r\nshould keep everybody on board; we should be aware\r\nthat everybody’s view and contribution is extremely\r\nvaluable and important.\r\nMay I add that, given the wide range of issues\r\nrelated to this process, our work should be organized\r\non two tracks simultaneously: the first track, to deal\r\nwith proposals and solutions related to improving the\r\nwork of the General Assembly that are achievable and\r\nimplementable over the short run; and the second track,\r\nto deal with proposals and solutions of a more\r\nstructural nature, which may take more of our time and\r\nour patience. This work should complement the work\r\nof the panel of eminent personalities being established\r\non the initiative of the Secretary-General.\r\nFinally, to make this happen, we need leadership,\r\nand leadership is what we have: with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his clear vision and his call for change;\r\nand with you, Mr. President, with your dedication and\r\ncommitment and your stewardship of this transparent\r\nand inclusive process. Leadership and support are also\r\nneeded on the part of all Permanent Representatives\r\nand their delegations to maintain the momentum of\r\nchange and to bring about the tangible results we all\r\ndesire.\r\nSlovenia supports you, Mr. President, in your\r\nguidance and leadership, and we shall work with you\r\nclosely.\r\nMr. Drobnjak (Croatia): Croatia strongly\r\nadvocates the reform of the our Organization,\r\nespecially with regard to the enlargement of the\r\nSecurity Council and the revitalization of the work of\r\nthe General Assembly. Along those lines, we express\r\nour firm support for the ongoing efforts to enhance the\r\nauthority of the General Assembly and to improve its\r\nworking methods.\r\nCroatia is of the opinion that the essential step\r\ntowards that paramount goal would be to replace the\r\napproach oriented towards long debates with one that\r\nwill produce tangible results. Against that background,\r\nI should like to emphasize the main points of Croatia’s\r\nposition on the subject of General Assembly reform.\r\nThe General Assembly is the only principal United\r\nNations organ in which every Member State has an\r\nequal opportunity to participate in the decision-making\r\nprocess. That well known but too often overlooked fact\r\nmust be a main guiding principle of our work.\r\nConsequently, the working groups and panels charged\r\nwith producing proposals for comprehensive reform\r\nshould be composed in a way that reflects appropriate\r\nregional and subregional representation.\r\nThe collective interest of the Organization must\r\nprevail over attempts to safeguard national interests at\r\nany cost — and to the detriment of the efficiency and\r\nthe quality of work of the General Assembly. Reform\r\nmust benefit all Member States, especially those that\r\nlack the privilege of Security Council membership. No\r\nsingle national interest — regardless of the size of the\r\nMember State — should be allowed to derail reform.\r\nThe political authority of the General Assembly\r\nshould be significantly strengthened, particularly as far\r\nas implementation of its resolutions is concerned. The\r\nrole of sponsors — as well as their responsibility for\r\nactions stemming from a particular resolution — could\r\nbe enhanced in that regard. Adopting resolutions that\r\nwe are not prepared or able to implement will lead to\r\nthe utter irrelevance of the General Assembly.\r\nTherefore, we must find a way to reverse the current\r\npractice, even if that requires amending the Charter.\r\nWe need not only shorter and more substance-\r\noriented resolutions, but also concise statements and\r\ndebates. In that regard, the idea of placing a time limit\r\non statements — depending on the issue being\r\ndebated — comes to mind, especially in cases in which\r\na Member State has already aligned itself with a\r\nstatement made on behalf of a particular organization\r\nor regional grouping.\r\nMaking the General Assembly agenda smaller in\r\nterms of the number of agenda items and clustering\r\nitems along thematic lines would not mean that certain\r\nissues would lose their substance or merit. On the\r\ncontrary, we must avoid the endless repetition of\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.45\r\ncertain resolutions year after year. In streamlining the\r\nagenda, we must respect the legitimate interests of\r\nMember States, particularly bearing in mind that many\r\nof them have no leverage on the work of the Security\r\nCouncil, and that the General Assembly therefore\r\nremains the principal body for the promotion of their\r\ngoals.\r\nIn exploring ways to revitalize the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, no stone should be left unturned,\r\nincluding the utilization of modern technologies. Word\r\nprocessing and other related technologies should not be\r\nmisused for the proliferation of documents and\r\npaperwork, but should be synergized to make our work\r\nmuch simpler and more efficient.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to emphasize that the\r\nproject of revitalization of the General Assembly is as\r\nmuch a technical as it is a political exercise. It will\r\nrequire all our expertise, flexibility, pragmatism and\r\nunderstanding. Croatia stands ready to actively\r\nparticipate along all those lines.\r\nFinally, let me express my strong support for the\r\nstatement made earlier by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Singapore.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n"
