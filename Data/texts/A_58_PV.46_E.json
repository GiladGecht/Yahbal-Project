Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Swe\r\n(Myanmar), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda items 55, 57, 58 and 59 (continued)\r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly\r\nUnited Nations reform: measures and proposals\r\nRestructuring and revitalization of the United\r\nNations in the economic, social and related fields\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations system\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/57/786,\r\nA/58/175, A/58/351, A/58/382 and A/58/395 and\r\nCorr.1)\r\nMr. Mekprayoonthong (Thailand): I should like\r\nto begin by joining previous speakers in expressing my\r\nsincere appreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport contained in document A/58/351, which\r\nprovides details of the status of implementation of\r\nactions described in last’s year report (A/57/387)\r\nentitled “Strengthening of the United Nations: an\r\nagenda for further change”, as well as for his other\r\nrelated reports. My delegation also commends the\r\nPresident of the Assembly for his determination to\r\npursue this matter further as one of his top priorities for\r\nthe current session. We keenly anticipate his pragmatic\r\napproach to making this session an action-oriented one.\r\nWe attach great importance to the strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations system and pledge our continued\r\nsupport for the initiatives put forward by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to bring about further improvements in the\r\nUnited Nations. As the sole universal multilateral\r\ninstitution, the United Nations needs to evolve with the\r\ntimes and changing geopolitical landscape and\r\ndemonstrate renewed vigour in order to remain\r\neffective and relevant.\r\nThe exercise of strengthening the United Nations\r\nsystem encompasses restructuring, reform, the\r\nrevitalization of its main bodies and organs and the\r\nmodernization of the Secretariat. We believe that the\r\nrationalization of the work of the General Assembly is\r\nat the heart of this exercise. It may be recalled that, at\r\nthe Millennium Summit in September 2000, heads of\r\nState or Government resolved to reaffirm the central\r\nposition of the General Assembly as the chief\r\ndeliberative, policy-making and representative organ of\r\nthe United Nations, and to enable it to play that role\r\neffectively. During the general debate this year, we also\r\nheard an overwhelming number of delegations\r\nunderlining the importance and urgency of the issue of\r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly. In this\r\nregard, my delegation wishes to associate itself with\r\nthe statements made yesterday by Morocco and Algeria\r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China and the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, respectively. We would also like to\r\nadd a few words of our own as our initial input to the\r\nprocess of United Nations reform. In doing so, we wish\r\nto refer to the useful note prepared by the President of\r\nthe General Assembly and the Secretariat for last\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nweek’s informal consultations on this issue as the\r\ndeparture point for our discussion.\r\nThailand supports the framework of action, as\r\nproposed by the President, to consider the revitalization\r\nissue under two clusters: enhancing the authority and\r\nrole of the General Assembly; and improving the\r\nworking methods of the General Assembly. Under the\r\ncluster relating to the authority and role of the General\r\nAssembly, my delegation fully endorses the proposals\r\nin paragraph 11 of the President’s note, especially those\r\nrelating to the enhancement of the General Assembly\r\nso that it can fulfil its role as envisaged in the Charter,\r\nas well as of the role of the President and the capacity\r\nof his Office. Under the cluster dealing with the\r\nworking methods of the General Assembly, Thailand\r\ncan go along with all proposals listed in paragraph 12,\r\nwhich will help to streamline the work of the General\r\nAssembly and lighten the workload of the Secretariat\r\nand Member States.\r\nMy delegation also supports the proposal to\r\nreprogramme consideration of agenda items in plenary\r\nmeeting in the General Assembly and in the Main\r\nCommittees over the full year of a session rather than\r\ntrying to do most of the work during the last quarter of\r\nthe year. The idea of thematic discussion on issues that\r\nare a pressing priority during the general debate also\r\nmerits further consideration.\r\nSuccess in revitalizing the work of the General\r\nAssembly hinges on a number of factors. Of paramount\r\nimportance is the political will of Member States to\r\nempower the General Assembly to play the role\r\nenvisaged and mandated by the Charter. In order for\r\nproposals for change to enjoy broad support and\r\nachieve consensus, discussions should be conducted\r\nopenly and with transparency in an atmosphere of trust\r\nand constructive criticism. Once decisions have been\r\nreached, it is equally important to ensure that they are\r\nfully implemented. The General Assembly must find\r\nways to ensure that its resolutions are taken seriously\r\nand implemented in national, as well as international,\r\ncontexts. The 36 actions outlined by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in the report (A/57/387) submitted during the\r\nprevious session should continue to serve as a road\r\nmap guiding our deliberations, and will be useful in\r\nsetting clear benchmarks for all actions requiring\r\nimplementation.\r\nReform is certainly not an indefinite process. We\r\nmust aim to deal with this daunting challenge within a\r\nspecific time frame. The reform of the United Nations\r\nmust be carried out in such a way as to enable the\r\nUnited Nations to attain the Millennium Development\r\nGoals by 2015, as intended. While there certainly is a\r\nprevailing sense of urgency with regard to the need to\r\nrevitalize the General Assembly and to reform the\r\nUnited Nations, the momentum needs to be sustained if\r\nwe are to reach the targets that we have set. My\r\ndelegation remains steadfast in its support for a more\r\neffective and relevant General Assembly and United\r\nNations. We also support the Secretary-General’s\r\ninitiative to set up a panel of eminent personalities and\r\nstand ready to provide further inputs and to play our\r\npart to achieve that end.\r\nMr. De Santa Clara Gomes (Portugal): I fully\r\nsubscribe to the statement made by the representative\r\nof Italy on behalf of the European Union. It covers all\r\nthe main points raised by the President of the Assembly\r\nin his non-paper, and by other delegations in the\r\ninformal consultations. I think that our suggestions\r\nshould be the object of a constructive dialogue with a\r\nview to strengthening the United Nations system.\r\nI would like to touch on just two points. The\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly is of immense\r\npolitical importance and is fundamental for the\r\ndevelopment of strategies aimed at achieving the goals\r\nset by the Charter.\r\nThe Assembly is the cornerstone of the\r\nOrganization. It is not always fully realized that it is\r\nthe main source of the legitimacy of the United\r\nNations. This role is more than symbolic; continued\r\nneglect of this body is damaging to the whole United\r\nNations system. The European Union points out several\r\npriorities in this matter that we must explore.\r\nBut there is one point I would stress here: the\r\nneed for our debates to be more interactive. Several\r\nthings can and should be done, but let me add a simple\r\nand rather minor one: let us hold most of our debates in\r\nanother room. Last year when, as Vice-President, I was\r\ncalled on to chair meetings, I had the sensation —\r\nwhich you may feel now — that this room looks more\r\nthan half empty and is too big to encourage true\r\ndialogue. Why not meet regularly in another room,\r\nwhen we do not expect large audiences?\r\nAnother point mentioned in the statement of the\r\nEuropean Union is the need to address the issue of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council’s interaction with the\r\nSecurity Council, for example on post-conflict issues.\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nThis touches on the way both bodies could work better\r\nand — more than that — how they could respond to a\r\nfundamental goal of the international system: conflict\r\nprevention. At present not much is done, even in the\r\ncase of countries with respect to which we all feel that\r\nthe complexity of the social situation, the\r\ninsufficiencies of the State and the economic failure\r\nshould be recognized and addressed together. It is\r\nparticularly striking in the case of countries in post-\r\nconflict situations where a peacekeeping operation is\r\nphased out and the country, sometimes still very\r\nvulnerable, is left alone.\r\nWe consider that in those pre- and post-conflict\r\nsituations there are three needs that the international\r\ncommunity must address: reinforcing the internal\r\nsecurity system; building up national institutions and\r\nmaking the State stronger and more capable of doing\r\nits job; and, finally, creating a viable economy.\r\nThe Security Council, hard pressed with the\r\nurgent and pressing needs of a large agenda, has not, in\r\nour view, been paying sufficient attention to all those\r\nneeds. And it lacks, if I may say so, the competence or\r\nthe interest in these situations to add economic\r\nassistance to State-building and security needs. The\r\nEconomic and Social Council has greater sensitivity to\r\ncertain aspects of such problems but is not equipped to\r\nwork in conflict prevention with full effectiveness.\r\nThat is why the Portuguese Prime Minister, in his\r\nintervention in the General Assembly debate, proposed\r\nthe creation of a new institutional mechanism, a new\r\ncommission with a mandate to routinely monitor cases\r\nof conflict prevention and promote conditions for peace\r\nand development. In conjunction with the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council, which\r\nwould both preserve their respective areas of\r\ncompetence, and under a mandate given by them, the\r\ncommission could identify and deal with the most\r\npressing needs. It would also draw up, for countries at\r\nrisk — and that is the case in most post-conflict\r\nsituations and in other clearly defined situations —\r\nintegrated strategies allying the objectives of security,\r\nreinforcement of institutions, namely in the justice and\r\nadministration sectors, and economic and social\r\ndevelopment. To create conditions for development,\r\nobviously, the commission would need to be closely\r\nlinked with the Bretton Woods institutions and United\r\nNations agencies.\r\nInternational and donor aid will be more\r\nforthcoming if an integrated strategy is adopted with\r\nthis kind of support. In terms of the United Nations\r\nbudget, we think existing resources should be sufficient\r\nto cover the functioning of such a commission.\r\nMr. Jenie (Indonesia): The delegation of\r\nIndonesia would like to express its appreciation to the\r\nPresident for convening this timely joint debate, which\r\nprovides an opportunity to discuss the subject of the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly in the context of\r\nthe larger question of the reform of the United Nations.\r\nIn our view, the opportunity provided by the joint\r\ndebate enables us to focus on the comprehensive nature\r\nof the issue.\r\nIn our view, reform of the United Nations is\r\njustified by the fact that it is the world’s premier\r\ninstrument for multilateral diplomacy. The\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations would, in turn,\r\nstrengthen the practice of multilateralism.\r\nIn this connection, my delegation associates itself\r\nwith the statement made earlier by Algeria on behalf of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement on the subject of the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. My delegation\r\nsupports the need to re-establish the role of the General\r\nAssembly as this Organization’s chief deliberative,\r\npolicy-making and representative organ and to ensure\r\nthat its resolutions are fully implemented.\r\nIn the effort to strengthen the United Nations\r\nsystem, we are particularly pleased that revitalization\r\nof the work of the General Assembly is a primary focus\r\nof the fifty-eighth session of the Assembly. In that\r\nregard, we find great reassurance in the President’s\r\nexpression of his readiness to take the lead in\r\nimplementing those proposals of the Assembly that can\r\nbe advanced at this time and to help develop further\r\nproposals leading to further revitalization of the\r\nAssembly. We are encouraged by his efforts and the\r\nnon-paper that he has circulated, for which we are very\r\ngrateful.\r\nSimilarly, my delegation would also like to\r\nacknowledge the recommendations contained in the\r\nnote by the former President of the General Assembly\r\non the revitalization of the General Assembly\r\n(A/57/861). We support those recommendations, in\r\nparticular, the need for the President of the General\r\nAssembly to meet more frequently with the\r\nChairpersons of the Main Committees, as well as other\r\nrelevant groups, on matters involving procedure. We\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nfurther support the recommendation for the\r\nChairpersons to bring to the attention of the President\r\nproposals for further enhancing the effectiveness of the\r\nMain Committees. Taken along with other measures\r\ncontained in existing resolutions designed to\r\nrationalize the agenda of the General Assembly, the\r\nrecommendations in this note will certainly help to\r\nimprove the work and workload of the Assembly.\r\nWith regard to specifics relating to methods of\r\nwork, we share the view that the reallocation of agenda\r\nitems that span a number of Main Committees is best\r\nhandled in the plenary. The Main Committees should\r\ncontinue to develop ways of improving their own\r\nmethods of work and to share that information with\r\nother committees that might be interested.\r\nWe welcome the advances that have been made in\r\nthe technical areas of reform, such as I have just\r\noutlined, which concern such issues as overlapping,\r\nenhancing coordination and strengthening efficiency.\r\nAt the same time, we must urge greater commitment\r\ntowards progress in the strategic areas, which affects\r\nthe capability of the United Nations system to uphold\r\nthe objectives and principles stipulated in the Charter.\r\nIn that connection, I would also like to reaffirm\r\nhow important it is for the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil to be undertaken without further delay. As we\r\nhave stated in the past, that critically important body,\r\nwhich has the primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, must\r\nbe enlarged and restructured so that it can enjoy the\r\nsupport and confidence of the international community.\r\nAs it is currently constituted, the Security Council\r\nmerely reflects the world of 50 years ago. Despite\r\nevery political advance since then, the Council lacks\r\nequitable representation, and the voices of vast\r\npopulations around the world are still not being\r\nsufficiently heard. We further believe that reform in\r\nthis body is also required in order to bolster the\r\nlegitimacy of its decision-making process.\r\nPermit me now to make similar comments about the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, which should continue\r\nto strengthen its role as the mechanism for system-wide\r\ncoordination. My delegation was pleased with the\r\nCouncil in its 2003 coordination segment, the topic of\r\nwhich was the role of the Economic and Social Council\r\nin the integrated and coordinated implementation of the\r\noutcomes of and follow-up to major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits. In this regard, the Economic\r\nand Social Council decided to establish a multi-year\r\nwork programme for the coordination segment of its\r\nsubstantive session, based on a focused and balanced\r\nlist of cross-sectoral thematic issues common to the\r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits.\r\nSimilarly, we feel that a cross-sectoral approach\r\nshould be used by the Council to review the\r\nimplementation of the outcomes of major United\r\nNations conferences and summits and their follow-up\r\nprocesses and to assess its impact on the achievement\r\nof their goals and targets. In dealing with cross-sectoral\r\nthematic issues, the Council should invite functional\r\ncommissions and other relevant follow-up mechanisms\r\nthat can contribute proposals and responses from their\r\nspecific perspectives. Regional commissions would\r\nhelp address the regional dimension of cross-cutting\r\ngoals and targets. The Council should also encourage\r\ngreater coordination among relevant organizations of\r\nthe United Nations system, including the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and the World Trade Organization.\r\nAt the end of the day, reform must be seen in\r\nterms of how well it is helping the cause of\r\ndevelopment in the Third World, because the exercise\r\nis not reform for the sake of reform, but to achieve the\r\nobjectives of development. In that connection, we share\r\nthe view of the Non-Aligned Movement that it is\r\nworrisome that the impact of the reform process in the\r\nOrganization is yet to be felt in the developing world.\r\nIt is essential that the success of United Nations reform\r\nbe judged in terms not only of the improvements in the\r\nway that the Organization functions, but also of how\r\nmuch more the developing countries can participate in\r\nits work and of the development benefits that they are\r\nenjoying as a result.\r\nLet us bear in mind that the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and the outcomes of the recent global\r\nconferences provide us with a compass by which we\r\ncan guide development. In his report on an agenda for\r\nfurther change, the Secretary-General made a case for a\r\nmore focused programme of work. He also noted that\r\nthe nature and pace of reform implementation will\r\ndepend on progress in a number of intergovernmental\r\nforums, the most significant of which is the General\r\nAssembly. The importance of the revitalization of this\r\nAssembly in taking development forward, therefore, is\r\nvery clear.\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nIn that light, while my delegation supports the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal for improving the current\r\nplanning and budgeting cycle, we would like to\r\nemphasize that this process should not compromise the\r\nability of the Organization to carry out programmes\r\nmandated by the Member States, in particular in the\r\narea of international cooperation on development. In\r\nthis regard, it is the belief of my delegation that the\r\nreform process should not be considered as a budget\r\ncut.\r\nPermit me now to recall the statement of the\r\nSecretary-General at the opening of the fifty-eighth\r\nsession, in which he indicated his intention to establish\r\na high-level panel of eminent personalities charged\r\nwith examining the current challenges to peace and\r\nsecurity; considering the contribution which collective\r\naction can make in addressing these challenges;\r\nreviewing the functioning of the major organs of the\r\nUnited Nations and the relationship between them; and\r\nrecommending ways of strengthening the United\r\nNations through reform of its institutions and\r\nprocesses.\r\nWhile we fully support this initiative, we hope\r\nthat the Panel will act as a catalyst for all of the reform\r\nand revitalization efforts of the United Nations. We\r\nfirmly believe that the Panel will be comprised of\r\ncompetent, experienced personnel with appropriate\r\nbackgrounds in management and the full commitment\r\nto multilateralism that is necessary to undertake an\r\nimportant task of this nature. My delegation eagerly\r\nlooks forward to the Panel’s recommendations, which\r\nthe Secretary-General expects to make available to this\r\nAssembly at the next session.\r\nIn conclusion, we must find the political will to\r\nreview each and every aspect of the functioning of the\r\nmain bodies of the United Nations and we must be\r\nswift in realigning and repositioning them. The United\r\nNations of 2003 bears almost no relationship to the one\r\nthat was set up over 50 years ago. Unless its growth in\r\nmembership and its shifting challenges are reflected in\r\nthe structures and mechanisms we put in place to\r\naddress them, we cannot fully fulfil the mandates of the\r\nCharter.\r\nMr. Mubarez (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): I thank\r\nyou, Sir, for your tireless efforts to advance practical\r\nsteps towards the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly that will allow it to recover its essential role\r\nas a deliberative and decision-making organ of the\r\nUnited Nations. In your leadership of the General\r\nCommittee, you have contributed to anchoring our\r\nwork.\r\nHowever, there is growing awareness of the need\r\nto exploit this heightened activity and momentum in\r\norder to achieve the objectives of reform. The\r\nSecretary-General has called for a radical reform of the\r\nOrganization and all its agencies to enhance their\r\neffectiveness and openness. We are unanimous in our\r\nendorsement of these goals and would be shirking our\r\nresponsibilities if we failed to seize this opportunity. It\r\nis very encouraging to note the stated commitments of\r\nthe participants in this debate to United Nations\r\nreform.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s efforts demonstrate that\r\nwe are on the right path. We believe that it is very\r\nimportant for United Nations reform to be exhaustive\r\nand integrated if it is to strengthen the collective work\r\nof the entire system. It is quite clear that revitalization\r\nof the General Assembly is an integral part of such\r\nreform, since the Assembly’s membership includes all\r\nMember States on an equal footing.\r\nToday more than ever, we need international\r\nconsensus to address the various challenges\r\nconfronting us. Nevertheless, in the course of recent\r\nyears the General Assembly has been extremely\r\nimbalanced, as evidenced by the major gap between the\r\nimportance of the issues it considers and its manifest\r\nfailure to resolve them — which, of course, damages\r\nits credibility and the effectiveness of its role. While\r\nmany resolutions have been adopted on this topic, most\r\nof them — as noted in the statement issued by the Non-\r\nAligned Movement — relate to the rationalization of\r\nthe agenda and the improvement of its working\r\nmethods rather than to the more fundamental issues.\r\nI support the statement made on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77, and I thank the Group for its proposals of\r\n17 November confirming its views on revitalization of\r\nthe General Assembly. General Assembly resolution\r\n55/285 provides, in paragraph 1, that\r\n“The process of revitalizing the General\r\nAssembly and improving its efficiency focuses on\r\nthe implementation of existing Assembly\r\nresolutions and decisions … Improvement of the\r\nprocedures and working methods of the Assembly\r\nis only a first step towards more substantive\r\nimprovements in and revitalization of the\r\nAssembly. The goal of this ongoing process is to\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nenable the Assembly to play its role effectively as\r\nthe chief deliberative, policy-making and\r\nrepresentative body of the United Nations.”\r\nReform should enable the Assembly to take\r\ndecisions on the most urgent issues on its agenda and a\r\nmajor commitment must be made to implementing its\r\nresolutions and decisions. Decision-making in the\r\nGeneral Assembly, which is based on unanimity in\r\nmost cases, is a real example of democracy in\r\ninternational action, since these decisions are taken by\r\na majority of those voting. This should encourage us to\r\nchoose the democratic option, given the failure of the\r\nSecurity Council as a result of the irresponsible use of\r\nthe veto, to comply faithfully with the resolutions of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nWe would like to concentrate on the most\r\nsignificant issues relating to reform. We see that the\r\nSecurity Council is going well beyond its powers and\r\nhas thus jeopardized the authority of the General\r\nAssembly. For this reason we believe we must be more\r\ncareful to divide the responsibilities of the two bodies.\r\nThe agenda of the General Assembly, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has noted, is overburdened. There are many\r\nitems which are of interest to only a handful of\r\ncountries that are addressed at the expense of items\r\nwhich are, in our opinion, much more important. The\r\nmatters which should be given priority should be\r\nchosen from those agenda items which appear on the\r\nagenda of the General Assembly. Thirdly, we fully\r\nagree with strengthening the General Committee of the\r\nGeneral Assembly so it can properly follow up the\r\nimplementation of resolutions on the revitalization of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm that the\r\nreform process of the United Nations and its agencies\r\nand organs can only be successful if other reforms are\r\nmade in tandem with improving the quality of\r\nmanagement of the Organization as a whole. Despite\r\nthe commendable efforts of the Secretary-General in\r\nthis matter, we do not notice any major change in the\r\nsituation, in particular in the use of human resources\r\nand recruitment policies. Very little has been\r\nimplemented to take advantage of the skills available in\r\ndeveloping countries for work at the Secretariat and its\r\nagencies. It would appear that transparency,\r\ngeographical balance and universality is failing in the\r\ncase of those managing the work of the Organization.\r\nMs. Bethel (Bahamas): My delegation is\r\nparticularly pleased to be participating in this important\r\ndiscussion, which is fundamental to our work here at\r\nthe United Nations. In this regard, my delegation\r\nwelcomes the ongoing efforts aimed at revitalizing the\r\nOrganization and its specialized agencies, and concurs\r\nwith the Secretary-General’s comments on the urgent\r\nneed for the United Nations to determine in which\r\ndirection it is to go in order to maximize its benefit to\r\nthe peoples of the world.\r\nMy delegation wishes to express its gratitude to\r\nthe President of the Assembly for the proposals before\r\nus dealing with enhancing the authority and role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and with improving the work\r\nmethods of the Assembly. The Bahamas delegation\r\nsupports the need for improving the capacity of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to fulfil its role as envisaged under\r\nthe United Nations Charter and the need for enhanced\r\ncooperation and more effective relationships between\r\nthe General Assembly and the principal organs of this\r\nOrganization. This is critical for the overall\r\nharmonization and coherence in the implementation of\r\ndecisions taken by the General Assembly.\r\nAlthough we would agree that the general debate\r\nprovides an opportunity for Member States to espouse\r\ntheir national positions on matters of mutual concern to\r\nthe General Assembly, the proposal that the level of\r\nrepresentation in the annual general debate, and special\r\nmeetings of the General Assembly should be at the\r\nhighest political level, may pose a difficulty to many\r\ndeveloping countries which are already hard pressed to\r\nprovide adequate representation to cover the ongoing\r\nwork of the Main Committees. Developing countries,\r\nparticularly the least developed countries, landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries and small island developing\r\nStates, now make the decision to follow only those\r\nitems which are of the greatest importance to them, as\r\nthe plethora of agenda items makes it almost\r\nimpossible to be represented in all of the Main\r\nCommittees.\r\nIn an effort to alleviate this situation, perhaps it is\r\nnecessary to expand the time allotted for the work of\r\nthe General Assembly and allow for work within the\r\nMain Committees to be distributed over a longer period\r\nrather than the current three months, from September to\r\nDecember, as has already been proposed by a number\r\nof delegations. Also in this regard, the Bahamas\r\ndelegation would support the further clustering of\r\nrelated items to decrease the time allocated to\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nindividual items in the plenary and Main Committees.\r\nWe wish, however, to caution that this merging of\r\nitems into clusters should in no way diminish or\r\njeopardize the importance of development issues as\r\nthey pertain to the economic and social well-being of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nMy delegation wishes to propose that the role of\r\nthe Department of Public Information be enhanced to\r\nassist in promoting the work of the United Nations, not\r\nonly within the Organization but even more\r\nimportantly, in ensuring that the message of the United\r\nNations is effectively disseminated to the peoples of\r\nthe world.\r\nIn this age of information technology, every effort\r\nshould be made to assist developing countries to access\r\ninformation and communications technology which\r\nwould allow them to become active participants in\r\nrelevant discussions now, as opposed to later, when the\r\nhard copy arrives. This would strengthen our efforts to\r\nhave decisions made in a timely manner and could lead\r\nto further effectiveness and efficiency within the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe time has come for a review of all matters on\r\nthe agenda of the General Assembly to determine their\r\nrelevance within the context of the existing geopolitical\r\nglobal economy. This may result in biennial\r\nconsideration of some items while others in their\r\npresent form could be removed entirely from the\r\nagenda. This pragmatic approach demands that a\r\nserious and exhaustive evaluation be undertaken of the\r\ncurrent situation with regard to the agenda items. This\r\nevaluation should, in turn, lead directly to a more\r\nefficient Organization with clear goals and objectives\r\naimed at realizing the promises and ideals delineated in\r\nthe Charter and in subsequent declarations, such as\r\nthose issuing from the Millennium Summit. My\r\ndelegation recognizes that this is a difficult process;\r\nhowever, it is one that, with the requisite political will,\r\ncan achieve the desired goal.\r\nThe Bahamas is committed to ensuring that the\r\nintegrity of the United Nations is preserved and\r\nrespected. We are committed to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of this Organization. We therefore, want to\r\nensure that the United Nations continues in its quest to\r\nmake the Organization the place where efforts are\r\nmade each day to improve the quality of life for each\r\nof the world’s citizens.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): We consider the\r\nreform of the United Nations system in general and the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly in particular as\r\nan utmost priority and indeed a necessity to give this\r\nOrganization its rightful place and function. It has been\r\nsaid many times, and never better than by the\r\nSecretary-General, who recognized the need for reform\r\na long time ago. He declared that we have reached a\r\nfork in the road, and radical reform is therefore a must.\r\nThe Secretariat depends on our continued\r\nsupport, but, more importantly, we, as Member States,\r\nmust claim ownership of this Organization, not merely\r\nby insisting on the rights assured us under the Charter,\r\nbut by assuming responsibility for its future and\r\nshowing willingness to compromise on our national\r\ninterests. More and more people turn to the United\r\nNations with high hopes and expectations, then only\r\ntoo often to turn away in bewildered frustration.\r\nWe thus welcome this debate and commend the\r\nPresident in particular for submitting a non-paper,\r\nwhich has enjoyed a very positive reception at the\r\ninformal meetings conducted on 17 October. Time is\r\nindeed of the essence, and the early convening of\r\ninformal meetings on this issue has created a very\r\npositive dynamic, which we hope will soon yield\r\nconcrete results. I wish to assure him that my\r\ndelegation will give its full support to his endeavours.\r\nFollowing his wish expressed at the end of those\r\ninformal meetings, I will make concrete points\r\nregarding the issues before us.\r\nWe were pleased to see that the proposal to\r\nstrengthen the Office of the President is finding strong\r\nsupport. A concrete measure should be the secondment\r\nof competent Secretariat personnel to the Office of the\r\nPresident, which can bring the value of institutional\r\nmemory to the Office and also the possibility of re-\r\nelection of the President. Reform is a protracted\r\nprocess, and two years still seem a very limited time in\r\nwhich to make a concrete difference.\r\nEnhancing the role of the General Committee is\r\nin fact very closely linked to the strengthening of the\r\nOffice of the General Assembly President, and it is in\r\nour view entirely up to the President to give the\r\nCommittee a meaningful role. We are just happy to see\r\nthat you have already initiated concrete changes in this\r\nrespect. The General Committee should live up to its\r\nresponsibility regarding the agenda of the General\r\nAssembly, not only regarding the question of inclusion\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nof new items, but also in dealing with the agenda as a\r\nwhole.\r\nWith regard to the agenda, the overarching goal\r\nmust be to make it more relevant, more accessible and\r\na better reflection of the challenges the United Nations\r\nis facing today. Ranking highest among these\r\nchallenges are the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nQuite a number of agenda items could simply be\r\ndeleted, as we all know. It would only require the\r\npolitical will of Member States. A case in point might\r\neven be our debate today: do we really need four\r\nagenda items on what comes together into one debate\r\non reform?\r\nWhat is even more important than the length of\r\nthe agenda, however, is the frequency with which we\r\nconsider the items that are on it. There are, in fact, few\r\nitems that merit consideration every single year. For a\r\nlot of them, consideration should take place every\r\ntwo — or sometimes even every three or five — years.\r\nThis would not only alleviate the burden that is\r\ncurrently placed on all of us, but would also leave more\r\ntime and room for implementation and thus make\r\nconsideration more meaningful. It would of course also\r\nhave an immediate effect on the issue of\r\ndocumentation, one of the biggest practical problems\r\ntoday. Again, the General Committee should act as a\r\nreal bureau and support the presidency in this respect.\r\nThe topic of the Main Committees is a\r\nparticularly vast one, and we hope it will be discussed\r\nin quite some detail. We thus only wish to point out the\r\nmain areas in which we believe consideration and\r\naction are needed. The General Assembly has in the\r\npast successfully reduced the number of Main\r\nCommittees from seven to six. It might want to have\r\nanother look to see if all of these are needed or whether\r\nthe agendas of some could not be integrated into those\r\nof other bodies, including, of course, the plenary.\r\nAs an alternative to or in combination with a\r\nreduction in the number of Main Committees, the\r\nGeneral Assembly could decide that they should meet\r\nthroughout the year in a sequenced order. The current\r\npractice seems to be carried over from the times —\r\nlong gone — when it was possible to do all the General\r\nAssembly work from September to December, and is\r\nthus obsolete.\r\nCarrying out reform and monitoring its success\r\ncan only be achieved if there is real interaction\r\nbetween the Office of the President and the Chairs of\r\nthe Main Committees. I was gratified to hear that the\r\nPresident has changed the format of the regular\r\nmeetings of the President with the Chairs, which I\r\nsuggested to your predecessor when I chaired the Third\r\nCommittee last year.\r\nThe best measure to reduce resolutions is the\r\nbiennialization or triennialization of a particular item.\r\nBut even if an item is up for consideration, it should\r\nnot be automatically assumed that a resolution should\r\nbe the necessary result. In particular, when the text of\r\nthe resolution would be pretty much identical to that of\r\nprevious years, a decision reaffirming the earlier\r\nresolution would in fact have the same effect and\r\nnegotiations could then concentrate on whether or not a\r\nreport was needed and when the item should be\r\nconsidered next.\r\nAll these comments are related to the working\r\nmethods of the General Assembly. Measures taken in\r\nthis area must, in our view, have one clear goal:\r\nenhancing the role of the Assembly, as called for most\r\nprominently in the Millennium Declaration and as\r\ncontained in the other cluster of your non-paper.\r\nWe believe that there should be a real dialogue\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly. This requires changes in the working\r\nmethods of the General Assembly in particular and also\r\nthe possibility of meeting in a more informal way.\r\nFurthermore, there is no reason in our mind that the\r\nSecurity Council submit only one annual report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly; it could be quite meaningful to\r\nhave several such reports whenever a particular\r\nsituation makes this necessary.\r\nWe would like to thank the Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the presentation of the report. We welcome\r\nthe ongoing reform process and wish to emphasize only\r\ntwo points at this juncture.\r\nFirst, we welcome the recommendations to\r\nstreamline the planning and budgeting process in order\r\nto make it less time-consuming. We hope that the\r\nOrganization will be able to achieve a closer link\r\nbetween political priorities and budgetary planning. We\r\nwelcome the presentation made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral this morning in that respect. Second, we also\r\nwelcome the strong emphasis the report places on the\r\narea of human rights, a priority area of United Nations\r\nwork that remains seriously underfunded. We will\r\ncontinue to pay special attention to the issue of treaty\r\nbody reform, on which we organized, together with the\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, an\r\nexpert meeting earlier this year.\r\nMr. van den Berg (Netherlands): The message of\r\nour political leaders during the general debate was\r\nextremely clear: there is a political will to reform and\r\nstrengthen the United Nations. A window of\r\nopportunity for badly needed change presents itself\r\nnow more than ever before and it is now our\r\nresponsibility, as our political leaders’ representatives,\r\nto act.\r\nI will focus my brief remarks on the General\r\nAssembly, first of all because the Netherlands mission\r\nwas actively involved in the so-called Greentree retreat\r\nearlier this year and secondly because I believe that\r\ndecisive steps to improve the Assembly’s functioning\r\nstand a good chance of succeeding at this session.\r\nIn brief, we are in dire need of concrete proposals\r\nto produce a more relevant and more elegant\r\nfunctioning of the General Assembly. To a large extent,\r\nthis boils down to rethinking our way of conducting\r\nbusiness in New York. The high-level panel will look\r\ninto that, but will probably not provide us with\r\nsolutions ready for adoption with regard to the\r\nworkings of the General Assembly. It rests upon us, the\r\nstewards of the General Assembly, to achieve\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly.\r\nItaly, on behalf of the European Union, has\r\nalready submitted ideas to which the Netherlands fully\r\nsubscribes. Let me add a few thoughts, focusing first\r\non the agenda of the General Assembly and secondly\r\non the role and impact of resolutions.\r\nWe suggest that the agenda of the Assembly be\r\nregrouped around major issues of global import. We\r\nthink that that would make the agenda more coherent,\r\nmore accessible and more manageable for Member\r\nStates. It would greatly help all delegations, small and\r\nlarge, to better apprehend the work of the General\r\nAssembly and would also help the general public to\r\ngain a better understanding of what is going on in the\r\nAssembly.\r\nIn our view, the eight sections of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration could provide an ideal framework for such\r\nan exercise. Those sections represent, by and large, the\r\nkey concerns in today’s world, as recognized by our\r\nheads of State just three years ago. We shall share with\r\nall Missions, as food for thought, an informal and\r\nindicative note — a non-paper that explores what the\r\nresults of such an exercise could be. In that context, we\r\nshould like to make a number of observations.\r\nThe current agenda of the General Assembly does\r\nnot completely cover the Millennium Declaration and\r\nits goals. Just one telling example: no agenda item\r\ncovers the first section of the Millennium Declaration,\r\nentitled “Values and principles”, although that section\r\naddresses fundamental issues.\r\nThe distribution of agenda items between plenary\r\nmeetings and the Main Committees seems to be to the\r\ndetriment of discussion of highly relevant topics in\r\nplenary meetings. For example, in our view, items such\r\nas the fight against terrorism, the non-proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, peacekeeping and the\r\nimplementation of the outcomes of major conferences\r\ndeserve to be considered at the plenary level. That\r\nwould immediately give plenary meetings a more\r\nprominent role and profile.\r\nQuite often, agenda items have a “micro” focus\r\non a particular subject or country. That is especially the\r\ncase in plenary meetings. We could consider addressing\r\nthe broader issues that they address by organizing our\r\ndebate around themes of broader interest, rather than\r\non specific agenda items. In doing so, of course, we\r\nshould not lose sight of specific issues of concern to\r\nsome Member States.\r\nThe distribution of work among the Main\r\nCommittees indicates that, in some instances, there is\r\nstill too much overlapping and lack of clarity in the\r\ndivision of responsibilities.\r\nMy second group of comments concerns\r\nresolutions. The Assembly produces 300 resolutions\r\nper year. Indeed, very few are read by our masters at\r\nhome, let alone by the wider public. Even we tend to\r\nforget about them, once they have been adopted. Their\r\nsheer number has reduced their relevance as the\r\nexpression of the will of the international community.\r\nOn this issue, the Netherlands is pleased to share with\r\nMember States another non-paper containing food for\r\nthought; it focuses on how to better control the number\r\nof resolutions and how to shift our debate to their\r\nfollow-up and implementation. I shall highlight two of\r\nits slightly more ambitious suggestions.\r\nSince there is a clear correlation between the\r\nnumber of agenda items and the number of resolutions,\r\nconsideration could be given to the suggestion,\r\ncontained in the Greentree report, to consider the\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nlonger-term agenda of the General Assembly as a\r\ncomprehensive list of agenda items. Each session of the\r\nAssembly could draw upon that list in compiling its\r\nyearly programme of work. The General Committee\r\ncould advise the Assembly in deciding on its\r\nprogramme of work.\r\nAnother new approach could be to agree on a\r\nreview cycle as part of adopting a resolution. That\r\nwould avoid bringing the resolution to the vote again\r\nthe following year, since the subsequent year would\r\nfocus on review. Only if new developments or fresh\r\ninsights justified substantial change would the review\r\nlead to the adoption of a substantially changed or new\r\nresolution on the item under consideration. The review\r\ncould also decide on the removal of the agenda item.\r\nOn the issue of resolutions, I should like to make\r\na final remark on consensus. Consensus can be\r\noverused and even misused as a pseudo right of veto\r\nfor the very few. The Greentree report points out that\r\nconsensus does not require absolute unanimity and that\r\nMember States should not be too reluctant to dissent\r\nfrom time to time. The following are possible elements\r\nfor debate on this topic: consensus should require at\r\nleast that there be unanimity among the majorities\r\nwithin the regional groupings or that dissenting\r\nMember States justify their positions and clarify the\r\nnational interests apparently at stake.\r\nLet me conclude by taking up a challenge\r\npresented to me by various colleagues. I concluded my\r\nstatement on the report of the Secretary-General on\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration by\r\nmaking a reference to the total weight — 3,000\r\nkilograms — of the brains available to us here in New\r\nYork. A number of colleagues wondered if I could also\r\nproduce a figure indicating the quality of those brains.\r\nI shall not venture to undertake such a hazardous\r\nenterprise. But to stimulate those brains, we need\r\npolitical will and experience in the United Nations\r\nsystem. With regard to the last variable, again, simple\r\ncalculus indicates that in our Missions in New York,\r\nwe have accumulated more than 6,000 years of United\r\nNations experience. In no other place in the world is\r\nthe potential to produce practical and innovative ideas\r\nfor revitalizing the General Assembly so high. Let us\r\nlive up to that potential.\r\nMs. Ferrari (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines):\r\nMy delegation, while aligning itself with the statements\r\nby Ambassador Bennouna on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China and by Ambassador Limon on behalf of the\r\nStates of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM),\r\nconsiders it appropriate to make some brief comments\r\non the specific concerns of the smallest Member States\r\nof the United Nations. I speak of those Missions whose\r\nstaff can be counted on the fingers of one hand.\r\nMy Government is firm in its view that it is vital\r\nto our national interests that we maintain a presence at\r\nthis forum, although the cost of establishing and\r\nmaintaining a Mission in New York puts a great strain\r\non an already overburdened economy. For that reason,\r\nit is critical that the representatives here in New York\r\nserve their country well. However, I shall try to\r\npinpoint one or two reasons why it is so very difficult\r\nfor mini-States to play the kind of role to which we\r\naspire.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nFor a start, I draw members’ attention to the\r\nJournal of the United Nations for Monday, 27 October\r\n2003, a typical day at the United Nations at this time of\r\nyear. In addition to plenary meetings of the General\r\nAssembly, there were meetings of all the Main\r\nCommittees except the Fifth — all of them discussing\r\nissues that are of vital importance to small Member\r\nStates. There was voting in the First Committee. Of\r\nparticular relevance to my Mission, there were also\r\nthree meetings of the Group of 77, a meeting of the\r\nCARICOM group, informal consultations on a variety\r\nof matters, a meeting of legal advisers, and a plethora\r\nof other events that we should have liked to attend.\r\nAdd to that nightmarish scenario the vast mountain of\r\nofficial — and unofficial — documentation that must\r\nbe tackled on a daily basis, and one will easily see that\r\na dozen or more persons would be needed for a\r\ndelegation to function in even a modest way. It is one\r\nthing for the Member States whose staff listings take\r\nup several pages of the Blue Book; it is quite another\r\nmatter for the smallest of the small.\r\nI make the point to reinforce what my delegation\r\nsaid last year when we addressed the plenary on this\r\nagenda item. The vast majority of the work of the\r\nUnited Nations is crammed into the three months\r\nbetween September and December. For the rest of the\r\nyear, while we are active, the agenda is not nearly so\r\ndemanding. Therefore we ask again: Can we not\r\nrearrange the schedule so that the work can be more\r\nevenly spread throughout the year? This does not seem\r\nto us to be such a revolutionary suggestion, but\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nwhenever we mention it we are met with raised\r\neyebrows and disapproving frowns. We have inflicted\r\nthis agenda on ourselves and we should now pause and\r\nconsider whether we cannot do better.\r\nIt also seems to my delegation that we can and\r\nshould impose self-discipline on ourselves when it\r\ncomes to addressing the General Assembly. We firmly\r\nbelieve that a more rigorous time frame for delegations\r\nshould be agreed and observed, and we suggest a limit\r\nof five minutes. Of course, we exclude from this\r\nsuggestion the general debate and other high-level or\r\nministerial meetings. We really do not see why\r\ndelegations cannot in five minutes make their points on\r\nroutine agenda items that come up for discussion every\r\nyear. Does it assist to quote from every United Nations\r\ndocument on every issue?\r\nWe believe that the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly is vital if this Organization is to stay at the\r\nforefront of serving the people of the world. At the\r\npresent time, as is well known, the Security Council\r\nmakes the decisions that are binding in international\r\nlaw on Member States. That is in line with the Charter.\r\nHowever, non-members of the Council have virtually\r\nno say in those decisions, which are not only binding\r\nbut which very often impose financial obligations on\r\nus. Quite simply, we are seldom if ever consulted. We\r\nare presented with a fait accompli and we have to\r\naccept it whether we like it or not. Unlike in this\r\nAssembly, our voice there does not count for anything.\r\nThese suggestions are made from the perspective\r\nof a very small mission and are intended to stimulate\r\ndebate on some small but significant ways in which we\r\nthink that the work of the Organization can be\r\nstreamlined to the benefit of all.\r\nMr. Leslie (Belize): Belize welcomes, Sir, your\r\nproactive approach to and interest in the reform and\r\nrevitalization of the United Nations. Such leadership is\r\nindeed exemplary and is in part fundamental if we are\r\nto achieve more than mere incremental progress in the\r\nprocess at hand. It would be remiss of me not to\r\nrecognize the efforts and achievements of former\r\nPresidents of the General Assembly, including the\r\ncurrent Foreign Minister and former Ambassador of\r\nGuyana, Mr. Insanally, in respect of the revitalization\r\nof the work of the General Assembly.\r\nAt the outset, Belize aligns itself with the\r\nstatement delivered yesterday by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Suriname on behalf of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity member States to the United Nations and\r\nunderscores, as he did, that we are unequivocal in our\r\ncommitment to working towards meaningful\r\nadvancement in this decade-long process.\r\nFor small developing countries like my own, the\r\nGeneral Assembly represents a levelled field on which\r\neach Member State can participate on an equal footing\r\nin the decision-making process of the most universal\r\npolicy-making body in the international arena. One\r\nvote per State — that is the epitome of representative\r\ndemocracy, the essence of the General Assembly and\r\nthe hallmark of the United Nations process of\r\nmultilateralism. In that regard, the people of the world\r\nhave entrusted their aspirations for universal justice\r\nand peace and the right to build better futures for their\r\nchildren to the United Nations, and more specifically to\r\nthis Assembly. In no uncertain terms, the people of the\r\nworld have given us a mandate. It behoves us to act\r\nnow to ensure that the United Nations has the\r\nnecessary effective mechanisms to fulfil those\r\naspirations of our people.\r\nThis joint debate is inclusive of several agenda\r\nitems, including that on the status of implementation of\r\nactions described in the report of the Secretary-General\r\nentitled “Strengthening of the United Nations: an\r\nagenda for further change”. We are pleased to learn of\r\nthe progress made in implementation. We note with\r\ninterest the conclusions of that report, in particular\r\nwith respect to the advantages to be had from the\r\nconfluence of the initiatives of the Secretary-General’s\r\nagenda for change and that of the General Assembly\r\nfor revitalization.\r\nFor the purposes of my delegation’s intervention,\r\nI would like to comment on three issues in the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly: the role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly; leadership, in particular the role of\r\nthe President; and media interest.\r\nWith respect to the role of the General Assembly,\r\nin your remarks at the opening of the general debate,\r\nSir, you stated that:\r\n“The General Assembly has oversight of the\r\nUnited Nations system as a whole, and hence has\r\nbefore it the full range of international issues. As\r\nadvocate, supervisor and policy-making body, it\r\nmust give the direction necessary to ensure\r\ncoherence in the system, so that the Organization\r\nmay respond in a holistic manner to the many\r\nchallenges it faces”. (A/58/PV.7, p. 1)\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nMy delegation is in full agreement with that\r\nstatement. For that reason, it is expedient, in our view,\r\nthat we revive the role of the General Assembly as the\r\nsupreme political body that addresses major\r\ninternational issues. The question is: How would we\r\nsolicit varying responses and how is this linked to other\r\nissues, including the agenda? As a preliminary answer,\r\nmy delegation would like to offer that the General\r\nAssembly may revive its role by having more\r\nmeaningful deliberations and debates, rather than the\r\nscripted and non-interactive approach, and by focusing\r\non implementation of its resolutions and decisions\r\nwithout compromising or marginalizing the issues on\r\nits agenda.\r\nOn the matter of leadership and the office of the\r\nPresident, we would further posit that the revitalization\r\nof the General Assembly, and particularly its centrality,\r\nis inextricably linked to the role of the President. As\r\nearly as its resolution 46/77 of 12 December 1991, the\r\nGeneral Assembly acknowledged that its capability to\r\nfulfil its role as prescribed under the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations was linked to the roles of the President\r\nof the General Assembly and the Secretariat in dealing\r\nwith the affairs of the General Assembly. That\r\nresolution further recognized the need to ensure the\r\nassignment of adequate staff and the provision of\r\nadequate facilities to enable the President of the\r\nAssembly to carry out his functions and\r\nresponsibilities. My delegation is of the view that the\r\ntime is opportune to revisit how the role of the\r\nPresident can be enhanced through the strengthening of\r\nthat office.\r\nWith respect to media interest, my delegation\r\nwould like to underscore the importance of the press in\r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly. That\r\ninterest may logically follow from our efforts to revive\r\nthe Assembly’s role, but it is an interest that we must\r\nnonetheless actively seek out and engage. My\r\ndelegation would like to reiterate its willingness to\r\nwork along with others in the efforts for the\r\nrevitalization and reform of the General Assembly and\r\nthe United Nations with a view to achieving concrete\r\nresults. We fully agree with the consensus that it is now\r\ntime for us to change.\r\nMr. Niang (Senegal) (spoke in French): Allow\r\nme at the outset to commend Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan on the excellent reports he has submitted to our\r\nAssembly, which testify to his ardent commitment to\r\nworking to make our Organization ever more credible,\r\neffective and thereby more capable of meeting the\r\ncomplex and most critical challenges of our time.\r\nIt is also fortunate that you, Sir, following the\r\nexample of your illustrious predecessors, from the very\r\nfirst days of your term of office have brought faith and\r\ndetermination to this extraordinary and healthy effort\r\nto invigorate the Organization by means of a\r\nrationalized approach to its actions so as to achieve the\r\naspirations of our global village.\r\nClearly, the tasks that lie ahead are important,\r\nvast and multifaceted. They will affect established\r\npractices and engrained habits related, among other\r\nthings, to the composition and functioning of organs,\r\nthe oversight of their activities and their working\r\nprocedures.\r\nNevertheless, the revitalization of this jewel is a\r\npossible undertaking, as attested to by the relevant\r\nproposals contained in the reports of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral before us for debate today. Bearing in mind the\r\ntime constraints, I shall limit myself to addressing three\r\npoints: revitalizing the General Assembly, improving\r\nthe working methods of the General Assembly and the\r\noversight of United Nations activities.\r\nIn this, Senegal fully endorses the sound\r\nobservations and proposals put forward by the\r\nAmbassador of Algeria, coordinator of the working\r\ngroup of the Non-Aligned Movement, and by the\r\nAmbassador of Morocco on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China, on the evaluation of progress achieved since\r\n1997 on the rationalization of the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and its working methods, the\r\nimplementation of resolutions and decisions, additional\r\nmeasures needed to curb and correct the relative\r\nmarginalization of the General Assembly, and urgently\r\nproviding, in accordance with resolution 57/270 B,\r\nintegrated follow-up to the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development and the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, with the aim of\r\nprogressively achieving the goals set by the\r\nMillennium Summit.\r\nIn the eyes of my delegation, the revitalization of\r\nthe General Assembly, as the privileged forum for\r\ndeliberation on questions of concern to the\r\ninternational community, should enable that body to\r\nrecover its fundamental mission of drawing on the\r\nstrengths of multilateralism by making — to use the\r\nwords of the President — strategic choices for positive\r\nachievement.\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nMore than ever, our Organization should strive to\r\nact — rather than react — diligently and pragmatically,\r\nwith realism and effectiveness, in the face of the ills,\r\nrisks and challenges confronting humankind\r\neverywhere, inexorably assailing us. From that\r\nperspective, the General Assembly would naturally be\r\nthe forum for the initiatives of the international\r\ncommunity in the context of globalization and the\r\nliberalization of the economy, when considering the\r\nravages of poverty, illiteracy and endemics.\r\nIn that context, I wish to welcome the creation of\r\nthe Office of the Special Adviser on Africa, led by\r\nUnder-Secretary-General Gambari. Among the priority\r\ntasks of the Office is to coordinate — at an appropriate\r\ntime — valuable support for the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development. No less significant are the\r\nactivities and projects of the Office of the High\r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries,\r\nAmbassador Chowdhury, who deserves our full support\r\nin implementing the Brussels Programme of Action and\r\nthe Cotonou Agreement.\r\nThe time for action has come. I would therefore\r\nlike to welcome the decision of the Secretary-General\r\nto create a high-level panel to monitor financing for\r\ndevelopment in keeping with the Millennium Goals, in\r\nthe framework of the proposed programme budget for\r\n2004-2005.\r\nIn order to be effective, the United Nations must\r\nbe wary of being caught in the tendency to drift that is\r\ninherent to bureaucracies. The bureaucracy tends to\r\ngrow constantly and become a force of inertia — which\r\nblocks the work of the Organization it is supposed to\r\nserve. To recognize this, one needs only weigh the\r\ntangible results of the endless parade of international\r\nconferences — some 15,500 over the last two years —\r\nagainst their exorbitant cost; their sheer number and\r\nlack of success undermine the value, relevance and\r\nauthority of the regular and special sessions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil.\r\nWith respect to the countless reports that few\r\ndelegations have the time to read or even glance\r\nthrough, the delegation of Senegal raises the question\r\nof the chronic problem of the quality, volume and\r\ndelays in the issue of the documentation provided,\r\nwhile deploring the fact that Member States, especially\r\ndelegations working in French, do not always receive\r\nequal treatment, despite the sacrosanct principle of\r\nmultilingualism. We therefore need to significantly\r\nreduce the number of official meetings and the\r\noverwhelming volume of documentation, while\r\nstrengthening the resources of the Department of\r\nPublic Information, in particular to update on a daily\r\nbasis the web site of the United Nations in all its\r\nworking languages.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the decision of the\r\nSecretary-General to cancel 192 reports and\r\npublications in the 2004-2005 budget. In support of\r\nthat decision, Senegal believes that it would be useful\r\nto combine reports on related issues, limit their number\r\nand set strict rules for the length of these documents.\r\nWe believe priorities should be established for the\r\nbiennialization or triennialization of draft resolutions\r\nand decisions, while ensuring, as noted by our friends\r\nfrom the Caribbean Community, that this action should\r\nnot lead to the neglect or relegation to a secondary\r\nposition of issues of primary importance to one group\r\nof States but which are deemed to be of less\r\nimportance by another, influential group.\r\nI must also address the crucial role of the\r\noversight of budgeting and administration in the\r\nfunctioning of our Organization. In that respect, the\r\nJoint Inspection Unit (JIU), which is the only\r\nindependent external oversight body responsible for\r\nevaluating the efficiency of the United Nations, should\r\nbe given means commensurate with its objective of\r\nenhancing the efficiency of the administrative and\r\nfinancial functioning of the United Nations system.\r\nThe human resources of the JIU should therefore\r\nbe bolstered by maintaining, if not increasing, the\r\nnumber of inspectors — at present a total of 11, three\r\nfrom Western European and other States and two from\r\neach of the other regions — and by increasing the\r\nnumber of research assistants, now 7, who assist\r\ninspectors in their tasks. In addition to its\r\ninvestigations, evaluations and proposals for reform, its\r\nmission should include monitoring implementation of\r\nrecommendations and responding to inspection\r\nrequests from the executive heads of the 12 bodies of\r\nthe United Nations system that have recognized the\r\nstatus of the JIU.\r\nWith respect to the status of the inspectors, we\r\nfeel it is crucial to insist on maintaining the tested rules\r\nand procedures for selection and nomination without\r\nneeding — here as elsewhere — to reinvent the wheel\r\nor to turn the inspectors into accountants or auditors-\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nverifiers competing with the existing Board of\r\nAuditors. The inspectors should possess a proven\r\nadministrative and financial background. Thus, the\r\ncomposition of the JIU should not be based solely on\r\nthe financial and budgetary criteria. Equally important\r\nare administrative and managerial skills and diplomatic\r\nand international experience grounded in first-hand\r\nexperience with the United Nations system. That is\r\nwhy the Advisory Committee on Administrative and\r\nBudgetary Questions recommends that the relevant\r\nprovisions of the JIU continue to be applied.\r\nAny change in methodology would in no way\r\nensure the enhanced functioning of the body and might\r\neven have adverse effects. Likewise, the current\r\ngeographical balance of the composition of the JIU\r\nseems acceptable, although Africa’s representation,\r\nwith just two seats, could evidently be improved. Thus,\r\nany possible process of reform for the JIU should be\r\nbased on a methodical, transparent and consensual\r\napproach resisting any precipitous change, which\r\nwould be detrimental to the functioning of the structure\r\nand to the good working order of the Organization.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to pay warm tribute to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral Louise Fréchette for the quality of their reports\r\nand the relevance of their proposals, including the\r\ncreation of a panel of eminent persons on the reform of\r\nthe organs of the United Nations. Senegal therefore\r\nhopes that a new era will dawn very soon for the\r\nUnited Nations through a synergy of effort and fruitful\r\nreflection that is shared, proactive and resolute in\r\nserving humanity.\r\nMr. Gallegos Chiriboga (Ecuador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The changes called for by the peoples of the\r\nmembers countries of this world Organization are\r\ndirectly related to its capacity to address current\r\nchallenges and needs of the international community.\r\nMy delegation wishes to recall that there are\r\nmandates stemming from the most recent summits of\r\nthe non-aligned countries, as well as of the Rio Group,\r\nto proceed with strengthening the multilateral system\r\nand with United Nations reform. I must mention the\r\nvery sound points raised by the Secretary-General to\r\nthe effect that reform of the entire international\r\nstructure is needed. It is essential that we all make\r\nefforts to make progress in the reform process of the\r\nmultilateral system.\r\nThe member countries of the United Nations\r\nshould make the Organization more democratic,\r\nrelevant and effective. That is what people are calling\r\nfor. A few days ago in this Hall, I said that, if we do\r\nnot change the multilateral structure of the United\r\nNations and its specialized agencies to make them\r\nresponsive to the needs of our peoples, we will have\r\ndoomed to failure the greatest effort of concerted\r\naction in the history of humankind.\r\nReform or change cannot be done partially. It\r\nmust be undertaken from a comprehensive approach\r\nthat includes all parts of the whole, thus making it\r\npossible to strengthen the United Nations system and\r\nthe multilateral system. An important part of this\r\nprocess is convincing the Permanent Representatives of\r\nthe importance of this issue and recruiting their efforts\r\nso that we can move diligently to achieve the reform\r\nwe want so much.\r\nOur countries are immersed in an interdependent\r\nand highly linked world, which makes necessary a\r\ntransparent and democratic international community\r\nthat is sensitive to the needs of all and is ready to seek\r\ncomprehensive solutions to common problems. No one\r\ncan be autarchic at this time in history. We need to\r\nanalyse the current state of affairs in order to find\r\navenues where mandates and consensus already exist\r\nand where we can move swiftly without the need for\r\nprotracted negotiations. I invite everyone to seek, in\r\nthe best spirit, consensus on reform. I firmly believe\r\nthat we need to unite positions and realities so that we\r\ncan agree on the changes that we all want.\r\nI have attended almost all the debates and the\r\nconsultations held on this issue. All heads of Missions\r\nand Government, including heads of State, and\r\nPermanent Representatives have expressed their\r\nsupport. We must not lose this opportunity to make\r\nprogress, under your leadership, Sir, in the purposes\r\nand principles of the Charter.\r\nWe have before us a variety of proposals that\r\nhave many merits and that deserve our close attention.\r\nLet us begin the process of change that we want so\r\nmuch.\r\nMr. Sharma (Nepal): At the outset, I commend\r\nyou, Mr. President, for taking early and serious\r\ninitiatives to advance the agenda of United Nations\r\nreform. This debate could not have been timelier, as it\r\nis taking place soon after the Secretary-General\r\nproposed to set up a blue ribbon panel to revitalize the\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nUnited Nations. You, Sir, will have our full support in\r\nyour efforts.\r\nI would like to align myself with the statements\r\nmade by Ambassador Baali of Algeria and Ambassador\r\nBennouna of Morocco on behalf of the Movement of\r\nNon-Aligned Countries and of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina respectively. I also wish to add our own thoughts\r\nto this extremely important issue before us.\r\nThe United Nations is doddering along, fragile\r\nand tired, requiring more efficiency and effectiveness\r\nto perform its tasks. Past efforts to rejuvenate it have\r\nbeen slow and largely confined to reforms within the\r\nSecretariat. Change in intergovernmental bodies has\r\nbeen partial and procedural. Sterile debate on\r\nsubstantive reforms has dragged on for a long time.\r\nThis lack of progress has emboldened people on the\r\nleft and right fringes to question the very raison d’etre\r\nof the world body.\r\nWe must not let those detractors destroy the\r\nUnited Nations. Indeed, the choice is between\r\ndesperation and determination. We can throw up our\r\nhands in desperation and join the bandwagon of those\r\nwho wish to see the demise of the United Nations,\r\nconvinced that it is beyond repair, or we can summon\r\nour determination to take resolute steps and renew and\r\nrevamp this Organization.\r\nTinkering at the margin with insignificant\r\nprocedural changes is not what the United Nations\r\nneeds now. We need real bold initiatives to change\r\nbusiness as usual and to relentlessly shape the United\r\nNations into an Organization that has the vision, means\r\nand tools to confront the emerging challenges of a new\r\nworld.\r\nNepal is committed to working with those forces\r\nthat are determined to put the United Nations at the\r\ncentre of multilateralism and to inject potent doses of\r\nreform to revive the Organization. We understand that\r\nthere will be setbacks and disappointments on this\r\npath, but this is the only practical and viable course of\r\naction to make the United Nations vibrant, efficient and\r\neffective in its service to humanity.\r\nThis is a defining moment for the United Nations.\r\nAt this juncture, reforms must be bolder in approach\r\nand more innovative in content. They must be coherent\r\nand comprehensive, as well as substantive and doable.\r\nHalf-hearted efforts along the lines of least resistance\r\nwill not be sufficient, and this debate affords us the\r\nopportunity to develop such reforms.\r\nWe have undertaken some procedural reforms, as\r\nI said. For instance, within the General Assembly,\r\nbiennializing and triennializing, as well as clustering\r\nagenda items, reducing time for the general debate and\r\neliminating conference services after hours have\r\ninstilled more discipline in us and in our work. Some\r\nchanges have taken place in the methods of work of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Security Council.\r\nThese measures have certainly been useful. They\r\nhave reduced cost and have increased efficiency, but\r\nthey have been distressingly insufficient to make the\r\nUnited Nations more effective in terms of its outputs\r\nand results. On the contrary, recent events have\r\nseriously dented the reputation and legitimacy of the\r\nUnited Nations. We must rectify that situation.\r\nIndeed, there is no panacea for fixing the\r\nproblems and lifting the stature of the United Nations.\r\nA series of actions will have to be taken and each organ\r\nwill need some common and specific steps for\r\nprocedural and structural reorganization and\r\nrevitalization.\r\nCritical to revamping the General Assembly are\r\nthe measures I have encapsulated in the acronym\r\nCAMSSIB, which stands for Cluster and consolidate\r\nthe agenda, Adapt the agenda to emerging needs,\r\nMerge and reorganize the Committees and\r\nsubcommittees, Strengthen the Office of the President,\r\nStagger the work of the General Assembly throughout\r\nthe session, Implement the resolutions the General\r\nAssembly adopts and Budget allocation should\r\nconform to priorities.\r\nFor example, there is tremendous room for\r\nclustering and consolidating a number of agenda items\r\nin virtually all Main Committees of the General\r\nAssembly. During the fifty-seventh session, the Fifth\r\nCommittee took the lead to consolidate several agenda\r\nitems into one. Similar steps can be taken in other\r\nCommittees as well, with safeguards to ensure that the\r\nimportance of any individual item is not undermined.\r\nAdaptation of agenda items to the changing needs\r\nhas become imperative. Many items have gradually lost\r\nresonance and relevance with the passage of time and\r\nothers have acquired fresh urgency with new\r\ndimensions and nuances. Some of the cold war issues\r\nhave become outdated, while HIV/AIDS, severe acute\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nrespiratory syndrome (SARS) and sustainable\r\ndevelopment have become more important global\r\npriorities.\r\nThe idea of merging the First Committee and\r\nFourth Committee is an interesting one. It makes sense\r\nin that these Committees have related agendas and\r\nmodest caseloads. Nepal is willing to consider the issue\r\nof merger if the key areas of both Committees do not\r\nsuffer neglect due to the merger.\r\nStaggering the work of the Committees\r\nthroughout the session can be a way to mitigate\r\npressure on the fall session. The Fifth Committee\r\nalready has the fall session and two resumed sessions\r\ndue to heavy workload. The Second and Third\r\nCommittees could also meet more than once, as\r\nnecessary. This will enable small delegations to better\r\nfollow the General Assembly’s work.\r\nStrengthening the Office of the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly has received short shrift so far. We\r\nmust reinforce that Office to make it more visible in\r\nstructure, more respectable in stature and more\r\nsubstantive in content. The President should have the\r\ncapacity and resources to perform his task effectively,\r\nparticularly in the area of follow-up to the General\r\nAssembly resolutions.\r\nIf there is one thing that can really revamp the\r\nGeneral Assembly and help reclaim its primacy in the\r\nUnited Nations system, it is to ensure the\r\nimplementation of its resolutions. It would be\r\ninconceivable to implement the nearly 300 resolutions\r\nchurned out every year by the General Assembly. But\r\nto start with, the Assembly can and should select five\r\nto ten non-controversial resolutions for serious\r\nimplementation and follow-up.\r\nSuch follow-up will instil self-discipline among\r\nMember States and encourage them to push through\r\nonly those resolutions that stand the chance of being\r\nfollowed-up. Only concrete results of the General\r\nAssembly’s work will create a strong constituency\r\namong peoples around the world and strengthen this\r\nmost representative body of the United Nations.\r\nNepal has welcomed the reforms undertaken\r\npursuant to the Secretary-General’s recommendations\r\nof last year and worked willingly to implement many\r\nof them. Indeed, we support efforts to link the budget\r\nwith the priorities of the United Nations. We also\r\nunderline the imperative to strike a balance between\r\nthe need for legislative control and administrative\r\nflexibility in order to optimize the output and results of\r\nUnited Nations activities.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council also needs\r\nbold reforms to make it more relevant and effective.\r\nKey again is the implementation of its resolutions and\r\ndecisions. The Council must convince people across\r\nthe globe that its work can make a real difference in\r\ntheir lives. For this, it must engage more closely and\r\nsubstantively with its implementation partners so they\r\ndevelop a sense of ownership and commitment to\r\nimplement the decisions of the Council.\r\nCoordination and coherence is equally important\r\nfor the Economic and Social Council, but it has not\r\nbeen able to coordinate its activities with that of its\r\nsubsidiary bodies and its oversight function leaves\r\nmuch to be desired. The annual interaction with its\r\ncommissions and funds and programmes is woefully\r\ninsufficient to strengthen the partnership that is vital to\r\nimplementation of the Council’s decisions.\r\nMeanwhile, the Council should strive to enhance\r\nits performance by rationalizing its work with a timely\r\nagenda and calibrated meetings. A long substantive\r\nsession is not conducive to this, as it tires out delegates\r\nand diminishes their marginal productivity. The\r\nCouncil, therefore, should meet throughout the year, if\r\nnecessary, and certainly not squeeze all segments\r\ntogether at one stretch. The idea of an economic and\r\nsocial security council deserves careful examination as\r\nwell, but such a council should come without the\r\nfetters of the Security Council.\r\nQuestions have also been raised in some quarters\r\nabout the rationale for having the Council’s meeting in\r\nalternate years in New York and Geneva. Of course,\r\nthis is a politically sensitive issue and must be visited\r\nin the context of a comprehensive reform, not in\r\nisolation.\r\nSecurity Council reform has proved a difficult\r\npill to swallow. The open-ended working group\r\nmulling over this matter has failed to make any\r\nbreakthrough for a decade. The Iraq debacle has\r\nreinforced the clarion call to make the Council’s\r\nstructure more representative and its method of work\r\nmore transparent and participatory in order to enhance\r\nits legitimacy and to ensure the support it needs from\r\nthe community of nations.\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nNepal has always supported a limited expansion\r\nof the Security Council, both in permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories of membership. But the\r\nquestions, among others, of veto power and of\r\ncandidates for the privilege have deadlocked the\r\nquestion of enlargement in the first category. To\r\nresolve these knotty issues, non-Council members\r\nshould persist in their prodding and the permanent\r\nmembers must agree on a reasonable framework for\r\nreform.\r\nThe reforms the Security Council has undertaken\r\nto make its work more transparent and participatory are\r\ndistressingly inadequate. In particular, troop-\r\ncontributing countries should have a greater role in the\r\nCouncil’s decision-making and in mission planning, for\r\nthey are the ones that put the lives of their nationals on\r\nthe line in dangerous missions.\r\nNepal welcomes the Secretary-General’s proposal\r\nto set up a blue ribbon panel to recommend reform\r\nmeasures. The panel must be small and yet reflect the\r\ndiversity of the interests and constituencies to which\r\nthe United Nations has to cater. That panel must\r\nengage in wide and meaningful consultations with\r\nMember States and other stakeholders to make its\r\nrecommendations more palatable to them.\r\nClearly, the international community has the\r\nshared obligation to make the world a more peaceful,\r\nprosperous and just place for all of us. It has\r\nrecognized this imperative in a number of global\r\ncompacts, including the Millennium Declaration. No\r\none should shy away from their commitment, including\r\ntheir commitment to revamping the United Nations.\r\nDesperation will lead us to defeat; determination,\r\nto success. We must therefore choose determination\r\nover desperation, engage in reforming the United\r\nNations and help the Organization to win the hearts and\r\nminds of ordinary people around the world and to\r\nfirmly establish itself in global public consciousness.\r\nTo do this, the world body must focus on three cardinal\r\npriorities regarding its resolutions and decisions, and\r\nthose three cardinal priorities are implementation,\r\nimplementation and implementation.\r\nMr. Severin (Saint Lucia): I have the honour to\r\npresent the views of Saint Lucia in this debate on\r\nmatters relating to the reform of the United Nations,\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations system and\r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly.\r\nThe delegation of Saint Lucia associates itself\r\nwith the statement made by Suriname, on behalf of the\r\nmember States of the Caribbean Community, but we\r\nfind it necessary to provide further insights of our own\r\non the matters before us.\r\nWhile the historical background to the debate\r\nwould be useful here, I have been careful to heed your\r\ncall, Mr. President, for the presentation of specific\r\nproposals that are focused and concise.\r\nMr. President, in your informal note of 15\r\nOctober, you had proposed that further consideration of\r\nthe matter of revitalization of the General Assembly be\r\npursued under the broad rubric of two thematic areas,\r\nnamely, enhancing the authority and role of the General\r\nAssembly and improving the Assembly’s working\r\nmethods. We believe that there is much merit in this\r\napproach, and have undertaken to offer the following\r\nproposals for consideration along those lines.\r\nIn a very real sense, the General Assembly\r\nPresident embodies the authority of the Organization’s\r\nmembership. The Office of the President should reflect\r\nand project that authority, and, in this regard, the\r\ncapacity of that Office to provide confident, competent\r\nand effective leadership to the Assembly should be\r\nenhanced.\r\nAn incoming President should not have to deal\r\nwith the obligation to staff his or her office utilizing\r\nmanpower resources from his or her country. Rather,\r\nthe Office of the President should be provided with\r\nfull-time professional support from the Secretariat. A\r\nstanding office comprising a minimum of three to five\r\nhighly experienced and competent United Nations\r\nprofessional staff should be established for this\r\npurpose. Of course, the President would be free to\r\naugment those resources, if he or she considers it\r\nnecessary, using personnel from other sources.\r\nEven before formal assumption of office, the\r\nPresident-elect should have available to him or her a\r\ntransition office with administrative and secretarial\r\nsupport from the Secretariat. It would be eminently\r\nsensible for the President and the President-elect to\r\nhold informal consultations as often as possible during\r\nthe transition period, and generally work out among\r\nthemselves mechanisms to ensure a smooth transition\r\nof presidencies, continuity in the work of the\r\nPresident’s office and overall effectiveness of the\r\nsystem.\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nIf we are ever to realize the enhancement of the\r\nrole and authority of the General Assembly that we all\r\nseek, we must ensure that we continue to work through\r\nthat body, except where the Organization’s Charter and\r\nrules dictate otherwise. In so doing, however, we must\r\nbe careful to maintain and to enhance the relationship\r\nbetween the General Assembly and other principal\r\norgans of the United Nations, in particular the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council, bearing\r\nin mind also that those organs act on behalf of the\r\ngeneral membership of the United Nations. In this\r\nregard, it appears appropriate that regular formal\r\nbriefings between the President of the General\r\nAssembly and the Presidents of the Security Council\r\nand the Economic and Social Council, as well as the\r\nSecretary-General, be institutionalized.\r\nWe all agree that there are serious flaws in the\r\nway we conduct the business of the General Assembly\r\nand that fundamental changes are required. It is my\r\ndelegation’s view that consideration should be given to\r\norganizing our work in such a manner that the work of\r\nthe six Main Committees would be extended beyond\r\nthe customary three-month period. This would bring\r\nabout a more efficient use of our resources, and\r\nfacilitate a more effective participation of all Member\r\nStates, particularly those with small missions. We\r\nmaintain that the current system, involving frenzied\r\nactivity within the six Main Committees, meeting in\r\nparallel over two and-a-half months, plus the Security\r\nCouncil, subsidiary bodies, regional bodies and plenary\r\nmeetings of the Assembly, all competing for our\r\nattention at the same time and all engaged in a mad\r\nrush to complete complex and lengthy work\r\nprogrammes by mid-December, represents a most\r\ninefficient use of our manpower resources, our time,\r\nand our taxpayers’ money. This system of operating\r\nrobs us all of the opportunity for more deliberate and\r\nmeaningful consideration of the work before us.\r\nThe general debate represents an essential\r\nelement in the life and work of the General Assembly,\r\nand the regular participation of our heads of State or\r\nGovernment should not only be welcomed but also\r\nencouraged. The United Nations is an\r\nintergovernmental body, and we would all do well to\r\nremind ourselves of the source of its authority and\r\nmandate.\r\nEvery year, our heads of State or Government\r\naddress us, issuing statements that are in essence the\r\npolicy directions that we are required to follow. The\r\nproblem, however, is that we have not been successful\r\nin building the critical linkages between these\r\nstatements and our work and between the general\r\ndebate and the work of the Assembly, the Main\r\nCommittees and the subsidiary committees.\r\nMy delegation wishes to propose that we address\r\nthis matter along the following lines: that we view the\r\ngeneral debate as the source from which we would\r\ndistil the policy elements that underlie our work. These\r\nelements would be refined and given greater definition\r\nin the Main Committees and subsidiary bodies. There\r\nthe identified issues would be debated and draft\r\nresolutions generated for consideration in the plenary,\r\nand then we would proceed to a final session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThis format would result in greater logic and\r\ncoherence in the work of the General Assembly, it\r\nwould make possible a more convenient and\r\ndelegation-friendly sequencing of our work and it\r\nwould remove the necessity for major work activities\r\ntaking place in parallel and the disruptive\r\nconsequences thereof for small delegations.\r\nMy delegation believes that the suggestions that\r\nwe offer for consideration address fundamentals. We\r\nhave chosen not to address microlevel issues such as,\r\nfor example, the redesigning of resolutions to make\r\nthem more effective. We believe that little or no\r\nprogress will be achieved unless we are able to effect\r\nprofound changes in the way we conduct our work. It is\r\nmy delegation’s hope that our small contribution to this\r\njoint debate will assist in bringing about the reform and\r\nrevitalization that has occupied our attention for so\r\nlong.\r\nMr. Gansukh (Mongolia): My delegation wishes\r\nat the outset to associate itself with the statements\r\nmade yesterday by the representative of Algeria, as\r\nCoordinator of the Non-Aligned Movement Working\r\nGroup on United Nations Reform and Revitalization of\r\nthe General Assembly, and the representative of\r\nMorocco, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nLike many others, my delegation attaches\r\nparticular importance to this joint discussion of agenda\r\nitems related to the process of reform and revitalization\r\nof the United Nations. Indeed, reform and\r\nrevitalization of our Organization — as you, Mr.\r\nPresident, rightly pointed out in your opening\r\nstatement — is key to the success of our initiatives and\r\nis, therefore, among our priorities.\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nLooking back over the past decade — with its\r\nseries of international development conferences and\r\nsummits, generating important declarations and plans\r\nof action — one might describe it as a decade of\r\ncommitment to development. But we must always\r\nremember that people in general, and those in the\r\ndeveloping world in particular, are tired of unfulfilled\r\npromises; they value deeds higher than lofty but hollow\r\ndeclarations. In this regard, Mongolia views reform as\r\nanother decisive step towards restoring confidence in\r\nour Organization.\r\nEveryone agrees that today reform is more\r\nnecessary than ever in order to enable the United\r\nNations to efficiently tackle the challenges our world is\r\nfacing. Efforts have been made continuously over the\r\npast decades, and a number of open-ended working\r\ngroups have been set up to that end. Unfortunately,\r\nlittle progress has been made in the practical\r\nimplementation of the reform process. There is,\r\ntherefore, an urgent need to speed up the reform\r\nprocess by identifying innovative approaches. We need\r\nto rethink what kind of reform is needed and for what\r\npurpose. We need to take into account the realities of\r\nthe present world and the challenges they present for\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nHere, I wish to express our support for the\r\nstatement made this morning by Ambassador\r\nMahbubani of Singapore. I am confident that the points\r\nhe raised in his statement, along with those outlined by\r\nothers, will offer important guidance in our future work\r\non this matter.\r\nWhile reaffirming Mongolia’s support for the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal to establish a panel of\r\neminent personalities, I also wish to support the view\r\nexpressed by many others, and by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Netherlands in particular, on\r\nwork in parallel, and that the panel’s work and our\r\nwork in New York should complement, rather then\r\ncompete with, each other.\r\nIt goes without saying that an important part of\r\nthe United Nations reform process is the revitalization\r\nof the General Assembly and the strengthening of its\r\nrole. Over the past decade, the General Assembly has\r\nadopted several resolutions aimed at rationalizing its\r\nworking methods and improving its efficiency. There\r\nwas resounding support during the general debate last\r\nmonth for the central role of the General Assembly as\r\nan advocate and the supervisory and policy-making\r\nbody of the Organization. In this regard, my delegation\r\nexpresses its appreciation to you, Mr. President, and\r\nyour predecessors for your untiring efforts to move this\r\nprocess forward. We believe that matters proposed\r\nunder the two broad areas of the revitalization process\r\nshould be given careful consideration and approval by\r\nMember States.\r\nWe can see from the reports submitted by the\r\nSecretary-General on the agenda items under\r\nconsideration that concrete steps have been taken to\r\nimplement the relevant resolutions of the General\r\nAssembly. But, as Ambassador Baali of Algeria,\r\nCoordinator of the Non-Aligned Movement Working\r\nGroup, emphasized earlier in his statement, the\r\nmeasures outlined in those resolutions put more\r\nemphasis on the rationalization of the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and its working methods, than on\r\nthe substantive aspects of the revitalization process.\r\nThose measures have had a minimal impact in\r\nachieving the main goal set out in paragraph 30 of the\r\nMillennium Declaration and resolution 55/285, which\r\nstates that the goal of this reform is to enable the\r\nAssembly to play its role effectively as the chief\r\ndeliberative, policy-making and representative body of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nMy delegation fully shares the view that a\r\ngenuine and authentic revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly can only be achieved through additional\r\ninnovative measures that tackle the problem of the\r\nrelative marginalization of the General Assembly and\r\nits relationship with other organs of the United\r\nNations. We hope that issues related to the\r\nrevitalization of the Assembly and specific measures\r\nthat you, Mr. President, have proposed in your non-\r\npaper will be considered in more detail during the\r\nopen-ended informal consultations of the plenary that\r\nyou intend to convene next month.\r\nTurning to the agenda item entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations system”, I wish\r\nto express our appreciation to the Secretary-General\r\nand his staff for their continuing efforts to implement\r\nthe Secretary-General’s agenda for additional change,\r\nparticularly the initiatives for improving the current\r\nbudgeting and planning process and reform of the\r\nDepartment of Public Information. My delegation\r\nexpresses its confidence that, with the support and\r\nenhanced cooperation of Member States, additional\r\nefforts will be made to fully implement the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s agenda for further change.\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nMr. Rahmatalla (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nwould like at the outset to express our appreciation to\r\nthe Secretary-General for his initiative to strengthen\r\nthe United Nations and to follow up on the\r\nimplementation of the reform measures contained in\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 57/300. We would like to\r\nassociate ourselves also with the statement by the\r\nrepresentative of the Kingdom of Morocco, speaking\r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China, as well as the\r\nrepresentative of Algeria, speaking on behalf of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement.\r\nIn his report on strengthening the United Nations,\r\nthe Secretary-General emphasized that this matter\r\ndepends on introducing appropriate modifications to\r\nthe intergovernmental bodies, starting with the General\r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and the\r\nSecurity Council. We concur with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s initiative, contained in his statement of 23\r\nSeptember to establish a high-level panel of eminent\r\npersons to put forward proposals regarding United\r\nNations reform.\r\nThat appeal was further strengthened by the\r\nDeclaration made by heads of State or Government and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs to the Assembly in the\r\ncourse of this session on the need to modify and reform\r\nthe principal organs of the United Nations — the\r\nSecurity Council, the General Assembly, the Economic\r\nand Social Council and the Trusteeship Council.\r\nReform of the United Nations to strengthen its\r\nrole and effectiveness requires that specific proposals\r\nbe put forward relating to reform and its\r\nimplementation as well as to the legal and\r\nadministrative steps that need to be taken to achieve\r\nthe hoped-for results.\r\nThe paper dated 17 October submitted by the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly under item 11, the\r\nreport of the Security Council, which lists the contents\r\nof the various statements made by States in the course\r\nof three meetings, reflects the aspirations of those\r\nStates, even if those declarations focused in the main\r\non one single question — that is, the report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly.\r\nIt goes without saying that most States have their\r\nown positions and their own proposals regarding the\r\nstrengthening of the role of the United Nations. The\r\npoint of departure could be the agenda of the General\r\nAssembly itself, which annually is encumbered by a\r\nnumber of items — well beyond the Assembly’s real\r\ncapacity. That makes it impossible for such matters to\r\nbe discussed in depth or for decisions to be taken on\r\nthem, so that they do not have to reappear once again\r\non the next agenda.\r\nIn order to achieve that result, Member States\r\nshould be keen to raise issues that are of general\r\nimportance or to give priority to issues that directly\r\ndeal with strengthening the role of the United Nations.\r\nIn that connection we would like to pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General for the steps that have been taken,\r\nwhich are described in his report (A/58/351). We\r\nbelieve that those reforms do not touch on substantive\r\nissues, but, if we are resolved to carry out the reform\r\nthat is needed and that has been demanded by States\r\nfor a decade, we can do so.\r\nWe must show the necessary political will to\r\nenter the implementation phase. The statements which\r\nhave been made on United Nations reform contain a\r\nwealth of different thoughts, proposals and views about\r\nhow this can be done. If a Committee were to take up\r\nthose suggestions, it could distil from them a document\r\nthat could be considered in some detail, so that an\r\noverall plan could be drawn up to identify what steps\r\nneed to be taken.\r\nMr. Chidyausiku (Zimbabwe): I join my\r\ncolleagues in recognizing the significance of today’s\r\nmeeting on the revitalization of the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at a time when there is a growing\r\nperception among the majority of the United Nations\r\nmembership that the General Assembly has been\r\nmarginalized and its role neglected.\r\nIn this regard, I want to associate my delegation\r\nwith the statement made on behalf of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement by Ambassador Abdallah Baali, the\r\nCoordinator of the Working Group of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement on the Revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly and United Nations Reform.\r\nMr. President, those of us with a purposeful and\r\ncreative vision and who are ready to make determined\r\nefforts to rekindle the General Assembly’s original\r\ninspiration and to imbue it with a new sense of purpose\r\nand direction accept and welcome the wisdom of your\r\ndecision to focus, in the prevailing circumstances, on\r\nmicrolevel reform as a more promising road map than\r\nmacrolevel reform.\r\nIt is often assumed that the General Assembly\r\ncould acquire greater effectiveness through far-\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nreaching amendments of the Charter. There is no doubt\r\nthat the General Assembly would benefit from such an\r\nexercise. But there is one roadblock — such\r\namendments are subject to approval by the permanent\r\nfive members of the Security Council, and they can\r\nchoose to veto them.\r\nSir, among the issues raised in your summary of\r\nthe open-ended informal consultations of the plenary\r\non the revitalization of the work of the General\r\nAssembly is the diminishing role of the General\r\nAssembly due to the preference of some Member\r\nStates to work through the Security Council. Not only\r\ndo I concur with that pertinent observation, but I am\r\nalso persuaded to add that the severe challenge to the\r\ndemocratic process at the global level is largely rooted\r\nin the division of roles and agendas between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council, and the\r\ninterrelationship between these two bodies. It is a fact\r\nthat no meaningful reform of the United Nations is\r\npossible without addressing the issue of the respective\r\nroles and mutual relationships of the General Assembly\r\nand the Security Council.\r\nA historical and empirical examination of the\r\nUnited Nations system shows that one of the primary\r\nexogenous challenges to this body was the cold-war\r\nenvironment of yesteryear. The institutional response\r\nof the United Nations to the cold-war challenge was to\r\nattempt in 1947 to shift decision-making power with\r\nrespect to security matters away from the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly, because of the\r\ndeadlock resulting from ideological differences among\r\nthe permanent members.\r\nIn those early years, when it had a pro-western\r\nmajority, the General Assembly was hailed in northern\r\ncircles as the “parliament” or the “town meeting of the\r\nworld”. But, having become a virtually universal body\r\nin the last 40 years, its new majority has been scorned\r\nas irresponsible and the Assembly as a useless talk\r\nshop. That imagery is reinforced by those who find it\r\ndifficult to sit through any significant number of\r\nspeeches in plenaries of the Assembly.\r\nAlso related to the above is the absence of any\r\nserious effort to establish annual calendars of work\r\nsuited to the needs and agenda of the new millennium.\r\nIt is thus easier for commentators eager to belittle and\r\nmarginalize the Assembly to claim that it cannot carry\r\nout its business effectively.\r\nBy every criterion of democratic constitutional\r\nlaw and actual practice, the General Assembly is the\r\nparamount organ of the United Nations, superior to the\r\nSecurity Council and central to the whole organization.\r\nBut, sadly, little is known of the General Assembly’s\r\npowers.\r\nOur debate today must of necessity be inward-\r\nlooking, as we turn to the United Nations Charter for\r\nguidance on what should be done to revitalize the work\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nBy Article 10 of the Charter, the General\r\nAssembly is expressly authorized to discuss any\r\nquestions or any matters within the scope of the present\r\nCharter or relating to the powers and functions of any\r\norgans as provided for in the Charter. That includes the\r\nSecurity Council, among other organs.\r\nOnly the General Assembly is mandated in the\r\nCharter to consider the principles involved in peace\r\nand security, and in disarmament and arms regulation,\r\nper Article 11.1, and to initiate studies and make\r\nrecommendations for the promotion of international\r\ncooperation in the political field and for the\r\nencouragement of the progressive development of\r\ninternational law and its codification, per Article 13.1.\r\nThe General Assembly is thus clearly mandated\r\nto establish the overall policies under which the\r\nSecurity Council can discharge its delegated\r\nresponsibilities. I suggest that the General Assembly\r\nadopt a declaration of principles and guidelines to\r\ncover any United Nations intervention in a grave\r\ndomestic situation within a Member State. That is in\r\nline with the recommendation by the South Centre that\r\nthe General Assembly should decide that the Special\r\nCommittee on the Charter of the United Nations and on\r\nthe Strengthening of the Role of the United Nations, in\r\nconsultation with the Sixth Committee, prepare a\r\ndeclaration of general principles and guidelines for\r\ndecisions by the United Nations on international action\r\nin grave domestic situations, including mechanisms for\r\nthe General Assembly to make determinations and,\r\nunder Article 11.3, to call the attention of the Security\r\nCouncil to such situations.\r\nAlthough it is a fact that is very little known, the\r\nSecurity Council is not exclusively responsible for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Even\r\nin the Charter, in Articles 10 to 14, responsibility for\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes is shared between\r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council.\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nFurthermore, under resolution 46/59, the General\r\nAssembly can send its own fact-finding missions. The\r\nsharing of responsibilities for international peace and\r\nsecurity are well articulated in the General Assembly\r\nresolution 47/120 entitled “An Agenda for Peace:\r\npreventive diplomacy and related matters”, adopted on\r\n18 December 1992.\r\nIt is time we ceased awaiting the convenience of\r\nthe Security Council and got the General Assembly to\r\nact, as it is the superior policy-generating and decision-\r\nmaking body in international law. The developing\r\ncountries, with the support and collaboration of\r\ninterested developed countries, should demand that the\r\nGeneral Assembly reassert its interest and role in\r\npeacekeeping, peace, security and humanitarian\r\nassistance.\r\nIn order to ensure that the appropriate structures\r\nand mechanisms are established and to improve the\r\nUnited Nations response in the situations described\r\nabove, the General Assembly should establish a high-\r\nlevel intergovernmental expert group to review the\r\ncauses of complex crises and emergencies and draw\r\nconclusions on the handling of such emergencies. The\r\ngroup should make policy and institutional and\r\noperational recommendations on how the United\r\nNations should address emergencies in the future, using\r\na more democratic, broad-based and demilitarized\r\napproach.\r\nThe Charter stipulates in Article 12, paragraph 1,\r\nthat the Assembly cannot make any recommendation\r\non a dispute or situation already being dealt with by the\r\nCouncil. But the Charter does not preclude the\r\nAssembly debating the issue, which could express as\r\nwell or even better the views of the great majority on\r\nthe action planned by the permanent members. This\r\nlatent authority has to be activated.\r\nThere is another point of critical importance that\r\nis seldom discussed. At all times the Security Council,\r\naccording to Article 24, paragraph 2, of the Charter,\r\n“shall act in accordance with the Purposes and\r\nPrinciples of the United Nations”. But if the Members\r\nof the Organization, who confer on the Council its\r\nprimary responsibility, judge that the Council is not\r\ngoing to act in accordance with the United Nations\r\npurposes and principles, that judgement on such a\r\nfundamental matter must override the procedural\r\nrestriction on the General Assembly stipulated in\r\nArticle 12, paragraph 1. Thus, the Assembly is not\r\npowerless to prevent a Security Council action that\r\nviolates the Charter.\r\nIn my closing remarks, I want to take this\r\noccasion to revisit the issue of the agenda and work of\r\nthe Main Committees, a matter that has already been\r\naddressed at great length by the Working Group of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM) on United Nations\r\nReform and Revitalization of the General Assembly.\r\nThe NAM observations on this matter, which I\r\nstrongly support, are informed by resolution 48/264\r\nand the rules of procedure of the General Assembly.\r\nOnce we adopt a resolution, we should take it upon\r\nourselves to ensure that the resolution is implemented.\r\nResolution 48/264 lays out very clear guidelines: items\r\nthat cover related matters or issues could be considered\r\nin agreed clusters. That approach allows us to address\r\nour work in a more purposeful and focused manner.\r\nRelated to that is the need on our part to adopt\r\nresolutions that are short, to the point and, above all,\r\nimplementable. We have been slack in following up on\r\nour resolutions. Unless we devote sufficient attention\r\nto the implementation of those resolutions, there is no\r\njustifiable reason for us to call for significant reform of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Aisi (Papua New Guinea): We thank you, Mr.\r\nPresident, for your dynamic leadership in ensuring that\r\nthis important debate on the question of United Nations\r\nreform remains and continues to be at the forefront of\r\nour work and in our minds.\r\nWe also thank, through you, Mr. President, the\r\nSecretary-General and Deputy-Secretary-General for\r\ntheir leadership in the constructive work in the reform\r\nprocess which continues within the United Nations\r\nSecretariat. Their efforts are being felt in many of our\r\ncountries, and I highlight the United Nations work in\r\ndeveloping countries through the simplification and\r\nharmonization of procedures, joint programming,\r\npooling of resources, better knowledge management\r\nand improvements in the development of the resident\r\ncoordinator system.\r\nWe also associate ourselves with the many\r\npositive aspects and observations already highlighted\r\nand alluded to in the statements of the Pacific Islands\r\nForum Group, the Group of 77 and China and the Non-\r\nAligned Movement.\r\nAs already noted and covered by many colleagues\r\nin their statements during this debate, the need for\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nchange is not the issue. Our challenge is how we\r\ncollectively effect that change. There is a distinct air of\r\nanticipation, and it has been stated openly, both within\r\nand outside this Hall, that at no other time in the past\r\nhas there been a better opportunity to make those\r\ncritical changes.\r\nIn participating in this important debate, we wish\r\nto limit ourselves to issues under agenda item 55 and\r\nspecifically focus on United Nations resolutions.\r\nWhen we look briefly at the history of this\r\nOrganization, especially how and why it was born, we\r\nnote that the leaders of that era saw the fundamental\r\nneed for global change. They realized that the world\r\nneeded to establish a global framework in which all of\r\nhumanity could live together and function in an orderly\r\nand peaceful manner.\r\nNotwithstanding all the criticism and negativity\r\nencountered by the United Nations since its birth, it\r\nstill stands as probably the only credible world body\r\nthat can harness the collective focus of all States of the\r\nworld under one roof on many common issues of\r\nconcern.\r\nThe United Nations has become an institution in\r\nwhich the rich and poor, the weak and powerful can, in\r\nan orderly and respectful manner, voice their opinions\r\nin debate and be heard — where debates can unite\r\nopposites and partnerships can coalesce for the\r\nbetterment of our collective humanity. It is the place\r\nfrom which the world is now waging war against\r\nhumanity’s common enemies, which include diseases\r\nsuch as HIV/AIDS and severe acute respiratory\r\nsyndrome (SARS), the devastating effects of poverty,\r\nclimate change, land degradation and desertification,\r\nterrorism, human trafficking, transnational crimes and\r\nmany other threatening scourges. But in considering\r\nhow we undertake the continuation of those battles, we\r\nneed to collectively address and continuously review\r\nthe way we deal with many global issues through the\r\nwork we do here.\r\nWhile considering the notion of change in this\r\ndebate, it is perhaps pertinent to make the observation\r\nthat the founders of the United Nations also realized its\r\nneed and, indeed, had the foresight to insert in the\r\nCharter the mechanism for effecting change. I do not\r\nwish to discuss here the technical issues relating to the\r\napplication of the provisions of Articles 108 and 109.\r\nHowever, in making reference to the two articles, I\r\nwould like to underline the fact that, when the United\r\nNations was founded, it was envisaged that it would be\r\na dynamic rather than a static body.\r\nWe are pleased that much has already been said\r\nabout the many issues that we should all be concerned\r\nabout when discussing reforms. So, rather than merely\r\nreiterating the many valuable contributions already\r\nmade, I would like to focus on the process of making\r\nresolutions as we currently practice it at the United\r\nNations.\r\nAt various times, we are reminded of the many\r\nresolutions that form part of the records of the United\r\nNations. While many remain dormant because they\r\nhave been unable to implement or do not have a\r\nrealistic purpose, others are annually rehashed to the\r\nextent that, in some cases, the original purpose is\r\nchanged, and they become irrelevant and/or obsolete.\r\nArticle 10 of the United Nations Charter does not\r\nmake specific reference to resolutions, but, rather, to\r\nrecommendations and decisions to describe the\r\nactivities of the General Assembly. What now seems to\r\nbe the accepted practice is for delegations to initiate,\r\nnegotiate and move for the adoption of resolutions.\r\nOnce adopted, the resolutions purport to reflect the\r\nexpression of the will of the General Assembly.\r\nHowever, understandably, there is a deep sense of\r\nanxiety among all of us about the annual increase in the\r\nnumber of resolutions, given that many current ones\r\nremain unattended to for a variety of reasons, including\r\nneglect.\r\nWe need to stop commenting on and complaining\r\nabout the number of resolutions and get on with the job\r\nof cleaning up United Nations documentation as part of\r\nthis reform process.\r\nSo, in the spirit of these discussions, we offer the\r\nfollowing points for consideration: first, that there be\r\nan immediate review of all current General Assembly\r\nresolutions to determine their viability and relevance;\r\nsecondly, that the process include a review of the\r\ncontents of each resolution to determine whether\r\ncertain provisions have been superseded by new\r\nresolutions; and thirdly, that we review in particular\r\nresolutions which may have been superseded by major\r\ninternational conferences and summits, such as the\r\nMillennium Summit, Monterrey, Johannesburg and\r\nothers.\r\nTurning to the question of who should review the\r\nresolutions, we favour the idea put forward by the\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nAmbassador of Malaysia that the Secretariat, or its\r\nDepartment of General Assembly and Conference\r\nManagement, should be involved in the process.\r\nPerhaps, however, more thought should be given to that\r\nparticular issue and options looked at.\r\nBut we strongly believe that whoever is charged\r\nwith the review and eventual monitoring of the status\r\nof implementation of resolutions will do the United\r\nNations system a very big favour.\r\nOn the other side of the resolution-making\r\nprocess, we should look also at enforcing certain\r\nobligations upon the proponents of resolutions and\r\ntheir sponsors. They should be obliged, when initiating\r\nresolutions, to provide an outline of an implementation\r\nplan. Therefore — simply put — there should be\r\nownership of resolutions. It seems that there is a focus\r\nonly on the content of a resolution and not on the\r\nprocess of its implementation. That is probably one of\r\nthe reasons why, year after year, there is a proliferation\r\nof resolutions — because there is no ownership. We\r\nhope that some concrete steps can be taken to address\r\nthat growing problem.\r\nIn conclusion, it is our view that the biggest\r\nproblem with change is that if we do not change, we\r\nwill be changed. The problem with being changed by\r\nother bodies or by circumstances outside our control is\r\nobvious. We need to be in control of the process of\r\nchange. We have to support the leadership of the\r\nPresident and of the Secretary-General in this\r\nimportant endeavour if we are to use the greatest\r\nopportunity since the birth of the United Nations to\r\nmake further lasting changes, as today’s custodians of\r\nthe United Nations. In doing so, we will replicate the\r\nbravery of the founders who fought those who doubted\r\nthe efficacy of the United Nations, but whose vision\r\nwas, in the end, proved right by history.\r\nLet us be a part of a continuing legacy by putting\r\nour words into action.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Mr. President, I should like at the outset to\r\nthank you for your leadership and for sharing your\r\nvision.\r\nStrengthening and reform of the United Nations\r\naim to restore the Organization’s centrality in the\r\nsystem of international relations, ensure the rule of\r\ninternational law and of the Charter, rebuild the system\r\nof collective security, and ensure the development of\r\nmultilateralism and cooperation among States.\r\nReform of the United Nations necessarily\r\ninvolves reaffirming the full validity of the Charter, as\r\nwas done three years ago in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. The purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter, including that of the sovereign equality of\r\nStates, respect for the political independence of nations\r\nand non-interference in the internal affairs of States,\r\nmust be applied without restriction.\r\nThere can be no far-reaching or meaningful\r\nreform of the United Nations unless we also prevent\r\nthe use and threat of use of force, which is an outright\r\nbreach of the principles of the Charter, which\r\nauthorizes the exercise of the inherent right to self-\r\ndefence only in response to an act of aggression.\r\nMultilateralism must be defended, because it\r\ninvolves full compliance with international law and the\r\npractice of democracy in international relations.\r\nThere is an urgent need to restore the primary\r\nresponsibility of the Security Council for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, with\r\nfull and strict respect of the Charter. Its procedures,\r\nincluding the exercise of the veto, must be subjected to\r\nintensive review, and its membership, both permanent\r\nand non-permanent, must be expanded in order to\r\naddress the inadequate representation of developing\r\ncountries.\r\nIt is vital to put an end to the double standard and\r\nfor the Council to cease serving hegemonic interests.\r\nExcesses, and, paradoxically, omissions in the context\r\nof the application of Chapter VII of the Charter must\r\nend, and Chapter VI should be used in its entirety and\r\nto its full extent. In its actions, the Council must\r\nhonour the principle of the sovereign equality of States\r\nand put an end to discrimination against the non-\r\npermanent members, whose legitimacy is rooted in\r\ntheir election by the Assembly.\r\nWe are facing a complex issue: how to strengthen\r\nthe United Nations in an age of an upsurge of\r\nunilateralism. How can we make the United Nations\r\ndemocratic in the midst of a totalitarian unipolar order?\r\nWe listened attentively to the proposal made by a\r\npermanent member which, in essence, would replace\r\nthe provisions of the Charter of the United Nations\r\nwith what he referred to as the “seven principles”. I\r\nwish to comment on them.\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nFirst, with respect to responsibility, States must\r\napply the Charter scrupulously, as well as the norms of\r\ninternational law and international humanitarian law,\r\nand fulfil in good faith all their legal obligations. The\r\ncollective interest of the membership of the United\r\nNations must prevail.\r\nSecondly, with regard to accountability, let me\r\nsay that there is nothing new about the concept of the\r\ninternational responsibility of States. States that\r\ncommit violations of the Charter, of international law\r\nor of international humanitarian law, that cause a\r\nbreach of the peace or commit acts of aggression or\r\nhuman rights violations, or impose coercive measures\r\non a unilateral basis, under any pretext, must bear the\r\nlegal and political consequences of their acts. Those\r\nwho imperil the collective security system to satisfy\r\nhegemonistic interests incur grave political and legal\r\nresponsibility. Strata of power should not be created at\r\nthe United Nations that would replace the principle of\r\nsovereign equality. We do not like the idea of “he who\r\npays the piper, calls the tune” in the context of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThirdly, with respect to effectiveness, no\r\nstreamlining of structure or function can compensate\r\nfor a lack of political will on the part of powerful\r\nStates or for the trend towards unilateralism. The\r\ndouble standard and the blocking of legitimate\r\nmandates do not serve the interests of the Powers and\r\nare extremely damaging.\r\nFourthly, with regard to stewardship of financial\r\nresources, the United Nations must once again work to\r\nensure the right to development and the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nand should cease to be an agency for the\r\nmicromanagement of the policies of the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions. A new financial architecture — or at least\r\na profound reform of the existing architecture — is\r\nnecessary. Contributions to the United Nations should\r\nbe paid on time, in full and without political\r\nconditionalities. The changes introduced in the scale of\r\nassessments should be reviewed, as decided in\r\nresolution 55/5 C, in accordance with the payment\r\nrecord of the principal debtor.\r\nFifthly, with regard to modernization, the veto\r\nmust go. Election by secret ballot of the members of all\r\nbodies should continue, as that is the fundamental\r\nprinciple of all democratic systems. It would be useful\r\nto consider ways and means of affirming the legitimacy\r\nof current and potential new permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council, as well as of revoking that status\r\nwhen their conduct is incompatible with the Charter\r\nand with international law.\r\nWe must put an end to political and financial\r\npressure for the purpose of obtaining votes. The\r\npolitical manipulation of the Commission on Human\r\nRights should cease. We are ready to discuss the\r\nquality of the membership of that Commission, which\r\nincludes former and current colonial Powers; current\r\nusurers of external debt; and those responsible for the\r\nmost serious cases of racism and xenophobia and for\r\nflagrant, massive and systematic violations of\r\neconomic and social rights, including the right to\r\ndevelopment, for corporate fraud, political corruption\r\nand even for preventing citizen participation in\r\nelectoral processes and taking part in electoral fraud.\r\nSixth, credibility is demonstrated by the voting\r\nprocess and the exercise of democracy in the United\r\nNations. Coercing third States to take certain positions\r\nby means of threats or bribery is a very serious matter.\r\nDouble standards must go, particularly in using the\r\nveto. There is a disconnect between the balance of\r\npower in the United Nations and the interests of\r\npeoples and of the majority of States.\r\nThe seventh principle is that of freedom. Respect\r\nfor the political independence and territorial integrity\r\nof States, and for the rights of peoples to self-\r\ndetermination and to struggle against foreign\r\noccupation must be universal. Hegemony must cease\r\nand democracy must be restored in international\r\nrelations.\r\nStrengthening and reforming the United Nations\r\nshould enable the Organization fully to implement the\r\nMillennium Declaration commitments as they relate to\r\nthe prohibition of weapons of mass destruction — in\r\nparticular nuclear weapons — so as to reduce the role\r\nthat they play in security doctrines and policies and to\r\ncurb their further development and stockpiling. The\r\ndevelopment of new, highly lethal conventional\r\nweapons and the use of outer space for non-peaceful\r\npurposes must be prevented.\r\nStrengthening and reforming the United Nations\r\nwill also require the Organization fully to play its\r\ncentral analytical role international economic affairs\r\nand in coordinating the development efforts of the\r\ninternational community, as well as in the creation of a\r\nmore just, inclusive, democratic and sustainable\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\ninternational economic system. That will give\r\ndeveloping countries access to the benefits of\r\nglobalization.\r\nThe functions and prerogatives that the Charter\r\nassigns, respectively, to the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council\r\nwith a view to achieving its purposes must be\r\nrespected. We must put an end to the Security\r\nCouncil’s encroachment on the jurisdiction of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, including any capricious interpretation of\r\nArticle 65 of the Charter designed to make the\r\nEconomic and Social Council subordinate to the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe strengthening and reform of the United\r\nNations must aim to promote cooperation and dialogue\r\namong Member States with a view to ensuring the\r\npromotion and protection of all human rights,\r\ninterdependent and interrelated as they are, for all\r\nhuman beings and peoples, and to take effective action\r\nto find peaceful solutions to international humanitarian\r\nproblems, with strict respect for the principles and\r\nnorms of international law, including international\r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nIn this process, the General Assembly must\r\nreassume the broad powers and attributes granted it by\r\nthe Charter — including those that might come into\r\nplay as a result of any paralysis in the Security\r\nCouncil — so as to reject the use of force to achieve\r\nhegemonic political objectives, and so as to insist that\r\nonly the peaceful settlement of disputes can lead to\r\nsecurity, stability, justice and democracy in the world.\r\nWe must ensure that the General Assembly\r\ncarries out its central functions as the main\r\ndeliberative, policy-making and representative organ of\r\nthe United Nations in an effective, dynamic and action-\r\noriented manner that is in keeping with current\r\ninternational priorities and contingencies and in\r\naccordance with the Charter.\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions are not binding —\r\nnor does the General Assembly have the means to\r\nenforce them. History, however, provides many\r\nexamples of how, after many years, the cumulative\r\neffect of their powerful political, ethical and legal\r\nmessage has had a significant impact on the\r\ninternational reality.\r\nWe consider the main problem today to be the\r\nlack of implementation of the many resolutions\r\nadopted by the Assembly. But the General Assembly\r\ncan realistically embark on a discussion of crucial and\r\npressing international issues with a view to adopting\r\nconcrete action-oriented resolutions.\r\nThe splitting up of the calendar of its Main\r\nCommittees could make a significant contribution to\r\nthe Assembly’s work. As it stands, the intensity of the\r\nwork required and the fact that so many activities take\r\nplace simultaneously in the period from October to\r\nDecember create an unbearable burden for the small\r\nmissions of developing countries.\r\nWe must rationalize the agenda of the General\r\nAssembly by means of a patient and democratic quest\r\nfor consensus. We believe, for example, that we must\r\ncontinue with the joint consideration of the four items\r\nnow before us. We would also like to propose the idea\r\nof perhaps uniting them into one single item.\r\nEfforts to revitalize the work of Main Committees\r\nshould be harmonized with the general guidelines\r\nestablished for plenary meetings. We should not\r\ndeceive ourselves, however: the effectiveness of the\r\nwork of the General Assembly and the Committees will\r\ndepend more on the political will of Member States\r\nthan on changes in their working methods.\r\nIn this process, Mr. President, you may rely on\r\nthe full willingness and constructive participation of\r\nthe Cuban delegation.\r\nMr. Stańczyk (Poland): I should like to begin my\r\nstatement with words of appreciation to Member States\r\nand to the Secretary-General for their commitment to\r\nimprove the United Nations system. I would especially\r\nlike to thank you, Mr. President, for your great\r\ndetermination and your courageous decision to take on\r\nand to accelerate the very difficult process of United\r\nNations reform and, in particular, the process of\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly.\r\nOur common objective is to make the United\r\nNations a more effective multilateral Organization.\r\nStrengthening, enhancing and reforming the United\r\nNations is therefore necessary and urgent. Poland\r\nattaches great importance to this ongoing process and\r\nto all the other proposals on United Nations reform\r\npresented so far.\r\nMy delegation fully supports the statement made\r\nby the Italian Permanent Representative, Ambassador\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nSpatafora, on behalf of the European Union (EU). I\r\nwould like in particular to emphasize the proposals\r\npresented by the EU concerning changes in the work of\r\nthe General Assembly. The revitalization of the work\r\nof the General Assembly is an ongoing duty for\r\neveryone interested in having the Assembly be a place\r\nwhere goals can be turned into reality. To achieve this,\r\nMember States must recognize their responsibility to\r\nsupport the General Assembly’s vital place at the\r\ncentre of this world Organization.\r\nPoland reaffirms its readiness to continue its\r\nactive participation in this process. With great\r\nsatisfaction we have heard all the positive responses to\r\nthe proposals presented in the informal note by the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly to the Member\r\nStates. Our substantive discussion during the first\r\ninformal consultation organized last week showed that\r\nthere is general agreement on many issues and on ways\r\nto improve our work in the Assembly and the\r\nCommittees. In our opinion we should not wait until\r\nthe end of the whole process of reform to begin\r\nimplementation of these small but important steps.\r\nLet me also emphasize, in particular, the\r\nimportance of the informal discussions undertaken by\r\nthe General Assembly Committees. Many important\r\nideas on how to improve and strengthen our work were\r\nbrought up in that context and we must take those ideas\r\ninto consideration and find proper methods for their\r\nspeedy implementation.\r\nPoland believes that reforms in the economic and\r\nsocial areas constitute an important element in the\r\nprocess of strengthening and revitalizing the United\r\nNations. To this effect, it is necessary to improve the\r\nefficiency and review the mandates of the various\r\norganizations and agencies working in these fields, and\r\nat the same time to promote more effective\r\ncoordination among them. Poland fully supports the\r\ninitiative to strengthen the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and its method of working. The effectiveness\r\nof the Economic and Social Council in performing its\r\nrole as the central mechanism for system-wide\r\ncoordination has become an issue of utmost\r\nimportance.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations in and of itself\r\nshould not, however, be our ultimate goal. We have to\r\nkeep in mind that we want to pursue this reform not\r\nonly to make our work easier, but also because we are\r\nguided by more ambitious goals. We must also\r\nremember that the process we undertook is a first step\r\non our long way to achieve a more significant goal for\r\nthe entire international community. Reform cannot\r\ncontinue without a clear vision of its directions and\r\npurposes. To reform the United Nations system, we\r\nfirst need to clearly understand what we expect from\r\nsuch reform.\r\nIn order to meet the challenges related to the\r\nchanging times and needs, it is necessary to redefine\r\nthe United Nations objectives, and where possible,\r\nimprove the Organization and reinvigorate its\r\noperations. The United Nations, if it wants to preserve\r\nits vital role as the most important multilateral\r\norganization, must adapt itself to swiftly changing\r\ninternational conditions by taking the lead in pursuing\r\ninstitutional reforms, the development of policies, and\r\nthe coordination of actions. That is why we have fully\r\nsupported the initiative of the Secretary-General to\r\nestablish the high-level panel of eminent personalities\r\nto examine the challenges facing the entire\r\ninternational community and the functioning of the\r\npresent United Nations institutions, agencies, and\r\nprogrammes. We fully agree that the panel should\r\nprepare recommendations for strengthening the\r\ninstitutional system, not at some distant time, but soon.\r\nHowever, as the Polish Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, Mr. Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, has\r\nemphasized on several occasions and as we have\r\nalready stated in the proposed Polish initiative of the\r\nNew Political Act for the United Nations, is that the\r\nhigh-level panel should also deliberate on the question\r\nof a common political framework that would form a\r\nbasis upon which the new institutional system could be\r\nbuilt. The panel’s work should not only focus on the\r\nreform of current organs and agencies, but should also\r\nembody a new reinforced basis for the United Nations\r\nmandate and delineate the functions of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn our opinion, the panel should concentrate part\r\nof its work on the creation of a new catalogue of\r\nuniversal values shared by the international\r\ncommunity. This process should prove to be of utmost\r\nimportance as a basis for further cooperation with the\r\nobjective of benefiting all humanity. This catalogue\r\nshould include the values already mentioned in the\r\nMillennium Declaration: freedom, equality, solidarity,\r\ntolerance, respect for nature and mutual responsibility.\r\nThey need, however, to be further evaluated and\r\nadjusted to present reality and broadened and clarified\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nto highlight their diverse aspects depending on the\r\ncircumstances of the contemporary world. At the same\r\ntime, the study of the question how to relate those\r\nvalues to the legal norms currently in force in the\r\nUnited Nations institutional system and how to make\r\nthem more relevant to other contemporary problems,\r\nshould also be undertaken by the panel.\r\nWe certainly expect that the report of the panel\r\nwill provide a conceptual and holistic reflection on the\r\nnature of the changes in the international system and a\r\nvision of a more effective international order. The\r\nreport should, in our opinion, contain answers to\r\nquestions posed by present challenges, including\r\nsecurity risks related to globalization and non-State\r\nactors, development gaps, international solidarity and\r\ngood governance.\r\nWe hope that the United Nations of the twenty-\r\nfirst century will remain an organization of nation\r\nStates responding to its Members’ concerns and needs\r\nand fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the people of\r\nthe world, whom it was created to serve. We cannot\r\nbuild a world without a strong commitment to act\r\ntogether through the United Nations. It is only our\r\nactions that will define the place and the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the international arena. On behalf of\r\nPoland, I can assure you that we will actively cooperate\r\nto achieve this goal.\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syria) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I would like to thank the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for the reports he has submitted and\r\nwhich are now being considered by the General\r\nAssembly. My delegation would also like to support\r\nthe statement made by the representative of Algeria on\r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). We\r\nwould also like to concur with the statement made by\r\nthe representative of Morocco speaking on behalf of\r\nthe Group of 77 and China.\r\nThese reports should be seen in the broader\r\ncontext of the reform of our Organization, which for\r\nsixty years now has proved its relevance and\r\neffectiveness. It is also true, logical and normal that\r\nthere are some aspects of this Organization that have to\r\nbe reconsidered and addressed at the appropriate time.\r\nThis involves work on advancing and consolidating the\r\nconcepts and principles of the founding fathers, which\r\nare our cultural heritage.\r\nThe philosophy of the reform should be based on\r\nan essential concept, namely that reform is a means\r\nrather than an end in itself. That being so, the Syrian\r\ndelegation, like other delegations, is convinced that\r\nstrengthening the United Nations as an international\r\nbody for deliberations should be an essential goal of\r\nreform. We welcome the constructive initiatives taken\r\nby the Secretary-General in order to achieve this\r\nobjective. Although some of those proposals will need\r\nin-depth consideration, his sincere efforts are\r\ncommendable and much appreciated. We must change\r\nthe structures of the United Nations by reforming its\r\nmain bodies. We must, in particular, reform the\r\nSecurity Council either by expanding it or by revising\r\nits procedures to ensure that it is a democratic body\r\nthat reflects faithfully the will of the international\r\ncommunity. Reform should also be aimed at enabling\r\nthe General Assembly to play its central role, which is\r\nso vital in the international arena because the Assembly\r\nis the most appropriate forum for deliberations and the\r\nsoundest of decision-making centres. Therefore, we\r\nmust develop mechanisms to implement the resolutions\r\nof the General Assembly, since these truly reflect the\r\nwill of the international community.\r\nThe General Assembly should also play its\r\nleading role as the supreme international legislative\r\nbody. In that connection, we reaffirm that all Assembly\r\nresolutions are valid and relevant and deserve to be\r\nimplemented. We should not allow people to refer to\r\nthe Assembly’s resolutions and agenda as obsolete or\r\nmeaningless. We should revitalize and implement those\r\nresolutions as a way to strengthen the legitimacy of this\r\nOrganization and as a sound step towards reforming\r\nand revitalizing it. This requires the sincere and\r\nattentive political will of all Member States.\r\nUnited Nations activities have increased over the\r\npast few years. This relates directly to the increase in\r\nmembership. But the Organization’s working methods\r\nhave not developed at the same pace and have not\r\nadapted to the growing agenda and membership. That\r\nis true also of the Main Committees and subsidiary\r\ncommittees, which means that the task facing Member\r\nStates is too great. In that connection, we wish to\r\nemphasize particularly the system of allocating agenda\r\nitems to the Main Committees. We take note of the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposals regarding the\r\nscheduling, planning and budgeting cycles.\r\nMy delegation believes that reform should be\r\nthorough and should include all aspects of budget\r\nformulation. This process should strengthen the role of\r\nthe deliberative bodies and enable them to consider all\r\n29\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nrelevant elements in order to strengthen the sovereignty\r\nof all Member States and promote their common\r\ninterests. In that connection, we wish to refer to the\r\nmedium-term plan as a strategic programming\r\ndocument that contains the operational priorities of the\r\nOrganization. We wonder if it would be possible to\r\nincorporate this strategic tool into the budgetary\r\nprocess. Every budget cycle should take into account\r\nthe mandate of the United Nations.\r\nWe also emphasize the need to provide the\r\nnecessary funding for all United Nations legislative\r\nactivities that stem from its resolutions and from\r\ninternational conferences. Lack of funding should not\r\nbe used as a pretext for not implementing those\r\nresolutions that are very important to developing\r\ncountries. We also emphasize that it is important for\r\nthe budget to be geared towards the implementation of\r\nprogrammes. It is clear that those activities need to be\r\ngreatly improved. The Syrian delegation agrees fully\r\nthat it is essential to consider in depth all aspects of the\r\nbudgetary process in order to take into account the\r\nviews of all countries and regional groups.\r\nWe need a clearer explanation of the shortened\r\nmedium-term plan and its linkage with the\r\nprogramming and budgetary process, as well as the\r\nreview of the role of the Committee on Programme and\r\nCoordination, because we do not have the information\r\nwe need to make an informed decision at this stage. We\r\nbelieve that no decision should be made until we have\r\nexamined all the relevant data. Any hastiness in this\r\nregard would be counterproductive, since the most\r\nimportant element of reform is in-depth analysis of all\r\nideas that are put forward.\r\nMy delegation assures members of our desire to\r\ncontribute effectively to all deliberations on these\r\nitems. We are a member of the Movement of Non-\r\nAligned Countries and of the Group of 77 and China,\r\nand we were among the first to advocate reform so that\r\nthe Organization could play its vital, leading role. We\r\nappeal to all our partners and to all Member States to\r\ntake these ideas into consideration so that we can move\r\nahead and achieve reform that will be in the interest of\r\nall.\r\nMr. Trautwein (Germany): Germany aligns itself\r\nwith the statement of the presidency of the European\r\nUnion and would like to add the following thoughts.\r\nGermany welcomes fully the reform initiative\r\nundertaken by the Secretary-General. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral put it (see A/58/PV.7), we do not have to\r\nchoose. The United Nations must confront threats and\r\nchallenges — new and old, “hard” and “soft”. It must\r\nbe fully engaged in the struggle for development and\r\npoverty eradication, in the common struggle to protect\r\nour common environment and in the struggle for\r\nhuman rights, democracy and good governance.\r\nRecent developments teach us that the “hard”\r\nthreats, such as terrorism and weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, are real and cannot be separated from\r\nproblems like extreme poverty and gross violations of\r\nhuman rights. Terrorism is not a problem just for rich\r\ncountries. Since this Organization was founded, States\r\nhave generally had the opportunity to deal with threats\r\nto peace through containment and deterrence, through a\r\nsystem based on collective security and the Charter.\r\nWe have to face up to the concerns that make\r\nsome States feel uniquely vulnerable, since it is those\r\nconcerns that drive them to take unilateral action. We\r\nmust show that those concerns can, and will, be\r\naddressed effectively through collective action.\r\nIn this context, the Secretary-General speaks of a\r\nfork in the road and a moment no less decisive than\r\n1945 itself, when the United Nations was founded.\r\nGermany shares that view. We should not shy away\r\nfrom questions about the adequacy and effectiveness of\r\nthe rules and instruments at our disposal. Among those\r\ninstruments, none is more important for the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security than the Security\r\nCouncil. In his recent report on the implementation of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration (A/58/323), the Secretary-\r\nGeneral drew attention to the urgent need for the\r\nCouncil to regain the confidence of States and of world\r\npublic opinion, both by demonstrating its ability to deal\r\neffectively with the most difficult issues and by\r\nbecoming more broadly representative of the\r\ninternational community as a whole, as well as of\r\ntoday’s geopolitical realities.\r\nThe Council of the future will have to find\r\nanswers with regard to the pre-emptive use of force\r\nagainst perceived threats, with regard to possible\r\ncriteria for early authorizations of coercive measures\r\nand with regard to the best way to respond to threats of\r\ngenocide or other comparable massive violations of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nThe question of the composition of the Council\r\nhas been on the agenda of the Assembly for over a\r\ndecade. Virtually all Member States agree that the\r\n30\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nCouncil should be enlarged. The German Chancellor\r\nreaffirmed that position in his statement before the\r\nAssembly on 25 September.\r\nThe Security Council is not the only institution\r\nthat needs strengthening. The Secretariat will have to\r\nfind ways to work even more effectively; the Assembly\r\nitself needs to be strengthened; the role of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, and the role of the\r\nUnited Nations as a whole in economic and social\r\naffairs, including its relationship with the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, need to be rethought and\r\nreinvigorated; and, finally, the role of the Trusteeship\r\nCouncil should be reviewed. This is all clearly\r\nreflected in the EU statement.\r\nGermany looks forward to the findings of the\r\nhigh-level panel of eminent personalities, which, we\r\nare sure, will be a vital and important guide for us in\r\nthe areas of current challenges to peace and security;\r\nthe contribution which collective action can make in\r\naddressing these challenges; the review of the\r\nfunctioning of the major organs of the United Nations;\r\nand ways of strengthening the United Nations through\r\nreform of its institutions and processes. Germany,\r\ntogether with its partners, will support this process and\r\nthe implementation of its results.\r\nMr. Tekle (Eritrea): Allow me to begin by\r\nthanking the Secretary-General for his report on the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations (A/57/59) and to\r\nexpress support for the proposals contained therein.\r\nThe Eritrean delegation associates itself with the\r\nstatement made by the Permanent Representative of\r\nAlgeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and\r\nthe statement made by the Permanent Representative of\r\nMorocco on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nHowever, I wish to make some additional observations\r\non certain issues.\r\nMy delegation also welcomes Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan’s decision to create a high-level panel of\r\neminent personalities which would make\r\nrecommendations that would enhance our\r\nOrganization’s capacity to face the realities of the new\r\ncentury.\r\nI must also seize this opportunity to thank you,\r\nMr. President, for your commitment to the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations system and for the\r\nproposals contained in the non-paper you issued.\r\nThe proposal for the strengthening, and thus the\r\nreform, of the United Nations comes during a period of\r\ntransition which witnessed the end of the cold war and\r\nthe advent of globalization, with their attendant\r\nconsequences. It also comes at an auspicious time,\r\nwhen an overwhelming number of Member States, as\r\nwell as global civil society, seem to be committed to\r\nthe establishment of an international order free of fear\r\nand want and to have created a solid consensus which\r\nrecognizes the interconnectedness of security — that is,\r\nhuman security — human development and human\r\nrights. It also comes at a time of hope and reflects a\r\nsense of optimism that the United Nations remains the\r\nonly institution that can protect and promote security,\r\ndevelopment and the rule of law.\r\nYet there are some challenges to be overcome.\r\nAmong them are the crisis of multilateralism, if only\r\nbecause some members no longer seem to have faith in\r\nthe United Nations, citing its inability quickly to adapt\r\nto new realities and an identity crisis that is rooted in\r\nwhat the United Nations can and cannot do.\r\nIn spite of this, however, there is general\r\nconsensus that the United Nations has become\r\nhumanity’s indispensable institution. This has been\r\nconfirmed by recent events and by the Organization’s\r\nproud record in the avoidance of global war, the\r\ndevelopment and refinement of international law,\r\npeacekeeping and peacemaking, the defence of human\r\nrights, and, above all, decolonization. It has also\r\ndemonstrated the usefulness of collective action on\r\nsuch global issues as the environment, population,\r\nHIV/AIDS, terrorism and other issues of common\r\nconcern to humankind.\r\nOn the other hand, the United Nations needs to be\r\nstrengthened if it is credibly to meet the demands and\r\nexpectations of a fast-changing world. It has become\r\nobvious that the United Nations and its allied\r\norganizations can no longer accomplish their missions\r\non the basis of the vision of a bygone international\r\norder and of their existing mandates and structures. It\r\nis thus imperative to dream up a new vision, to recast\r\nthe mandate and to upgrade the structure of the\r\nOrganization if it is to become an efficient and\r\nmeaningful instrument for global peace and\r\ndevelopment in the new world order.\r\nThe United Nations Charter is a magnificent\r\ndocument, and many of the current challenges and\r\nproblems facing the world can be met or resolved by\r\n31\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nfaithfully adhering to its values, norms and principles,\r\nand by revitalizing old institutions and mechanisms on\r\nthe basis of its provisions. Yet there will also have to\r\nbe some additions, to respond to new realities.\r\nTo that end, Member States must be ready to\r\naccept new realities, including globalization; new\r\nhopes and expectations on the part of peoples — all\r\npeoples — of seeing the elimination of weapons of\r\nmass destruction; new responsibilities relative to the\r\neradication of poverty, famine and plagues of biblical\r\nproportions; the speedy elimination of terrorism; the\r\ndesire of citizens to master their destinies; and the need\r\nto adopt new paradigms, including, in particular, those\r\nrelated to security and development, the relationship\r\nbetween societies as well as within societies, and the\r\nrelationship of human beings to their environment.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration is the document that\r\ncontains the essential conditions which buttress and\r\nuphold the Charter and, by enunciating clearly our\r\ncommitment to strengthen, and thereby ensure the\r\ncontinued relevance of, our organization; identifying\r\nhumanity’s common concerns; forging common goals\r\nand objectives; refining old, and formulating new\r\nprinciples, norms and values; defining our priorities;\r\nand establishing a cooperative programme of action, it\r\nwill enable us boldly to face the complex new realities.\r\nIn fulfilment of the Millennium Declaration’s\r\nmessage of goodwill and cooperation for mutual\r\nbenefit, the Organization must be able to function as an\r\nindependent, truly universal and pluralist agent and\r\nfacilitate the sharing of experiences and ideas, promote\r\ntolerance and mutual understanding through dialogue\r\namong civilizations, countries and peoples, and\r\npropose varied policy options to guide the international\r\ncommunity during these early days of the new order.\r\nThe Organization can execute its mandate\r\nfaithfully, credibly and effectively if its institutions are\r\nempowered and enabled to operate smoothly on the\r\nbasis of the tasks and duties allocated to them by the\r\nCharter and, now, the Millennium Declaration, with\r\nsome essential changes made to correct past mistakes\r\nand to respond to the exigencies of the times.\r\nThere is no denying that, in spite of the hollow\r\nmyth of an “automatic majority” of Third World\r\ncountries controlling the affairs of the United Nations,\r\nit is, in fact, the major Powers of the developed\r\ncountries which are in control of the operations of the\r\nOrganization. It is clear that the present distribution of\r\npower and influence is counterproductive. It is\r\ntherefore urgent that a new system, based on the\r\nprovisions of the Charter but reflecting the general and\r\nspecific responsibilities of countries, be created to\r\nbreak old patterns, correct imbalances and restore old\r\npowers. In effect, the United Nations must be\r\ndemocratized.\r\nIn this connection, the General Assembly — the\r\nmain deliberative organ of the United Nations, in\r\nwhich the principle of one State, one vote is\r\noperational — must be revitalized by restoring the\r\npowers and functions bestowed on it by the Charter. In\r\nthis connection, the Eritrean delegation wishes to\r\nassociate itself with the statements made by those\r\ndelegations which consider it essential to further\r\nstrengthen the office of the President of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe Security Council has made praiseworthy\r\nimprovements in its working methods. However, the\r\ncall for greater transparency and accountability has yet\r\nto elicit any meaningful response. The Eritrean\r\ndelegation is also convinced that the expansion of the\r\nmembership of the Council is essential if the Council is\r\nto reflect the reality governing current international\r\nrelations and to make it more representative. The\r\nrevitalization of the Economic and Social Council is\r\nalso essential in view of the current organizational\r\nweakness in the area of economic and social affairs.\r\nThe Eritrean delegation recognizes that public\r\nopinion plays an essential role in the strengthening of\r\nthe United Nations. Accordingly, my delegation notes\r\nwith thanks the proposals submitted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to redefine the functions of the Department of\r\nPublic Information.\r\nI would like to conclude by declaring that, in\r\nspite of the bitter experience and memory of Eritreans,\r\nthe State of Eritrea recognizes that the United Nations\r\nis humanity’s beacon of hope for a safer and better\r\nworld because, on the one hand, it symbolizes justice,\r\nfairness, the rule of law and “best practice” State\r\nbehaviour, while, on the other, it is now certain that,\r\nwithout the United Nations, no country, including the\r\nmighty, can achieve the global public good of peace,\r\nprosperity, sustainable development and good\r\ngovernance. Eritrea is therefore committed to the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations and hopes that its\r\nfaith and commitment are not misplaced.\r\n32\r\nA/58/PV.46\r\nMr. Shacham (Israel): The reports before us\r\nfollow upon document A/57/786, submitted last year\r\nby the Secretary-General, entitled “Strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations: an agenda for further change” — a\r\ndocument that was nothing less than extraordinary. It\r\nwas concise, candid and constructive. It was a work\r\nthat embodied the spirit of the agenda itself, calling for\r\nfewer reports, richer in content and shorter in length.\r\nNow that the Secretary-General’s vision is\r\nmoving into the implementation stage, I would like to\r\ncomment on four specific aspects of the programme\r\nthat are of particular interest to my delegation.\r\nFirst, regarding the work of this body, the General\r\nAssembly, the Secretary-General has suggested the\r\ncombining of duplicative discussions and the reduction\r\nof recurring agenda items. My delegation has\r\nfrequently lamented the automatic annual rehash of\r\nresolutions without regard for the relevance of their\r\ncontent or the efficiency of their treatment. A reduction\r\nin the number of overlapping resolutions could be\r\nachieved by simply merging and editing draft texts,\r\nthus creating important savings in time, money and\r\npaperwork. The pattern of recurring agenda items is\r\nparticularly annoying and wasteful. We support the\r\nSecretary-General’s call for a rigorous review of this\r\npractice and his suggestion that many issues no longer\r\nbe addressed annually. We also take note with\r\nsatisfaction of the beginnings of the implementation of\r\nthis suggestion, in the form of a growing number of\r\njoint debates. Yet even more needs to be done.\r\nSecondly, the Secretary-General’s call for\r\nrealigned priorities, including a focus on technology-\r\nbased development solutions; water issues; the\r\npromotion of good governance as the foundation for\r\npeace; and the strengthening of the capacity of the\r\nUnited Nations to fight terrorism — these are goals\r\nthat seem to my delegation to be right on target. From\r\nour perspective, those four priorities constitute the\r\nbuilding blocks for regional reconciliation and provide\r\na promise of cooperation, development and prosperity\r\nfor all peace-loving peoples.\r\nThirdly, in his report, the Secretary-General\r\nobserves that the Department of Public Information has\r\nsuffered from a fragmentation of its efforts as a result\r\nof too many mandates and missions. Our delegation\r\ncould not agree more with that statement. The valuable\r\nresources of this Organization have been squandered\r\non unnecessary and partial information efforts,\r\nperpetuated by partisan political perspectives. It is\r\nhoped that the new operating model for the Department\r\nfor Public Information proposed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral will resolve this wasteful and\r\ncounterproductive phenomenon.\r\nLastly, the Secretary-General has called for the\r\nestablishment of a panel to review the relationship\r\nbetween the United Nations and civil society and to\r\noffer practical recommendations for approved\r\nmodalities of interaction. The effort to bring about\r\nimproved engagement with civil society, based on\r\nprocedures and policies that reflect greater coherence,\r\nconsistency and predictability, is indeed welcome. The\r\nterms and conditions governing the accreditation and\r\nparticipation of non-governmental organizations in\r\nUnited Nations conferences should indeed be reviewed\r\nand improved, in order to, among other things, protect\r\nthe focus of this Organization from being appropriated\r\nby hidden agendas.\r\nIn conclusion, we sincerely welcome the efforts\r\nbegun to faithfully implement the groundbreaking\r\nreport of the Secretary-General and hope that they\r\nremain focused and on target. We stand ready to assist\r\nyou, Mr. President, in your efforts to turn this vision\r\ninto a reality.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on these items.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.30 p.m.\r\n"
