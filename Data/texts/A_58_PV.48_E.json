Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.40 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 104 (continued)\r\nFollow-up to the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development\r\n(b) High-level dialogue for the implementation of\r\nthe outcome of the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/58/216 and\r\nA/58/323)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/58/436)\r\nReport of the Economic and Social Council\r\n(A/58/3, Parts I-II)\r\nSummary by the President of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and notes by the Secretariat\r\n(A/58/77 and Add.1 and Add.2)\r\nConference Room Paper (A/58/CRP.2)\r\nThe President: The Monterrey Consensus,\r\nadopted by the International Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development reflects the critical decisions we took\r\nat the highest political level to address the challenges\r\nof financing for development around the world,\r\nparticularly in developing countries. It also lays out the\r\nobjectives we set for this purpose.\r\nMonterrey’s distinctive approach of bringing\r\ntogether all the parties involved in the financing for\r\ndevelopment process has made it possible for key\r\ncross-sectoral issues in trade, finance and development\r\nto be addressed comprehensively. The Consensus has\r\nbeen widely acclaimed as a new and workable\r\napproach to development financing, and an important\r\nguide for joint action at the national, regional,\r\ninternational and systemic levels in this critical area.\r\nThat accounts for the commitments made and the\r\npriority pledged for implementation of the courses of\r\naction of the Consensus.\r\nAt Monterrey, we ensured that implementation\r\nand follow-up of such a key document as the\r\nConsensus would not be left to chance. We must now\r\nbegin our biennial process of assessment and forward\r\nplanning in the area of financing for development at\r\nthis two-day High-level Dialogue. Our theme, “The\r\nMonterrey Consensus: status of implementation and\r\ntasks ahead”, gives us clear direction on what is\r\nexpected of us.\r\nWe have worked well in this follow-up process.\r\nReports are that all of yesterday’s ministerial round\r\ntables dealt forthrightly, frankly and effectively with\r\nthe issues at hand. I commend all the round-table\r\nparticipants. Civil society and business sector panels\r\nalso had productive sessions on 27 October.\r\nUndoubtedly, those prior deliberations will inform our\r\ndiscussions here today.\r\nI believe that pragmatism must now inform our\r\nhigh-level segment so that we may realistically assess\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.48\r\nboth the progress we have made and the urgency with\r\nwhich we must proceed with the tasks ahead. By any\r\nyardstick, our assessment report is a mixed one. On the\r\npositive — and, I must say, commendable — side, we\r\nsaw an increase of some 4.8 per cent in development\r\nassistance immediately following the Monterrey\r\nConference. Some donor countries have reached the\r\nUnited Nations official development assistance goal of\r\n0.7 per cent and have committed to reaching 1 per cent\r\nduring the period 2005 to 2006. Others have set time\r\nframes — for example, 2012 — to reach 0.7 per cent.\r\nThe European Union has decided to collectively raise\r\nofficial development assistance levels to 0.39 per cent\r\nof gross national income by 2006 as a first step towards\r\nthe 0.7 per cent United Nations goal. There are also\r\npromising signs that other countries may increase their\r\nofficial development assistance but may still fall short\r\nof the 0.7 per cent target. In that regard, it is interesting\r\nto note that it is among the same group of countries\r\nthat usually fund development activities that pledges\r\nare being made for significant increases in official\r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nThere are nascent and encouraging signs pointing\r\ntowards the resolution of the debt crisis, with ideas\r\nsuch as a comprehensive, statutory approach to\r\nrestructuring the external debt of Governments and the\r\nuse of collective-action clauses now being discussed.\r\nFor their part, many developing countries and\r\ncountries with economies in transition are working\r\ntowards creating an enabling environment at the\r\nnational level by strengthening economic governance\r\nand enhancing democratic participation, as called for in\r\nthe Monterrey Consensus.\r\nOverall, however, the other side of our report\r\ncard has not been encouraging. Net private financial\r\nflows to a significant number of developing countries\r\nhave declined or are negative. There is little change\r\nwith respect to challenges such as lack of market\r\naccess, special and differential treatment, debt, the\r\ndeteriorating situation of commodity-dependent\r\ncountries, protectionism and agricultural subsidies, and\r\nthe lack of participation by developing countries in the\r\ndecision-making of international financial institutions.\r\nFurther, much more needs to be done to reach the\r\nadditional $50 billion in official development\r\nassistance needed annually to meet the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. The failure to make tangible\r\nprogress in trade relations at Cancún put us no closer to\r\nour quest for a level playing field and enhanced\r\nopportunities for developing countries.\r\nIn some instances, special circumstances have\r\nhampered progress in meeting the objectives of the\r\nMonterrey Consensus. Civil strife and military conflict,\r\nfor example, are hindering development in a number of\r\nthe most vulnerable countries and populations. Basic\r\nhealth care also remains alarmingly inadequate in a\r\nlarge number of countries.\r\nIn this high-level segment of our Dialogue, we\r\nshould openly and frankly discuss all the issues that\r\npresent a challenge to the successful implementation of\r\ncommitments and agreements reached at Monterrey, be\r\nthey at the national, international or systemic level. If\r\nwe are to effectively use it, we must be forthright in\r\nasking ourselves pertinent questions in order to arrive\r\nat pertinent responses.\r\nFor example, is the United Nations system\r\npositioned to have an adequate impact on the\r\ndevelopment funding process? Have sufficient steps\r\nbeen taken towards improving coherency and\r\nefficiency among donor agencies? Regarding\r\npartnerships, have sufficient efforts been made to\r\nengage civil society and the private sector both\r\nnationally and internationally? And, with respect to the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, what should be their role in tracking progress\r\nmade and in proposing further steps aimed at\r\nimplementing the commitments and agreements made\r\nat Monterrey?\r\nI pose those questions because I believe that the\r\nanswers are of central importance to our tasks ahead. I\r\nalso pose them in the hope that they will assist us in\r\nidentifying some of the pertinent issues we must take\r\nup and address in our interactive discourse so that we\r\nmay move decisively forward and effectively\r\nimplement the Monterrey Consensus.\r\nI now call on Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe Secretary-General: One stark fact should be\r\non our minds throughout this timely Dialogue: in 2002,\r\nfor the sixth consecutive year, developing countries\r\nmade a net transfer of resources to other countries.\r\nMoreover, last year’s was the largest such negative\r\nresource transfer ever: $200 billion. We have just heard\r\nthe President speak about this issue.\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.48\r\nOf course, this is a complex question. Aggregate\r\nnumbers can mask varied performance, and there is\r\nsome good news here and there. But, even taking all\r\nsubtlety and nuance into account, the overall result\r\ndefies common sense. Funds should be moving from\r\ndeveloped countries to developing countries, but these\r\nnumbers tell us the opposite is happening. Funds that\r\nshould be promoting investment and growth in\r\ndeveloping countries, or building schools and hospitals,\r\nor sponsoring other steps towards the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, are instead being transferred\r\nabroad. Despite promising investment opportunities in\r\nthe developing world and improved economic policies,\r\nfear and uncertainty are keeping resources from being\r\ndeployed where they are most needed.\r\nIf what we say about financing for development\r\nis not to ring hollow, if financing for development\r\nmeans anything, we must reverse this negative balance\r\nsheet and fix the system so that all countries, and all\r\npeople — especially the poorest — can benefit.\r\nThat is the goal that brought us all together in\r\nMonterrey last year. Given the dramatic events we have\r\nlived through since then — from the war in Iraq and its\r\naftermath to the setback in trade negotiations at\r\nCancún — the Conference might seem a world away.\r\nTherefore, it strikes me as useful, amidst the current\r\nglobal divisions, to recall some of the spirit that\r\nprevailed just 18 months ago.\r\nCertainly, Monterrey was not free of tension and\r\ndisagreement, but we did achieve real breakthroughs\r\nthere. The one most people remember concerned\r\nofficial development assistance: new commitments\r\nmade in Monterrey reversed a troubling and\r\ndevastating decade of decline or stagnation. But let us\r\nnot forget Monterrey’s other messages.\r\nFirst, the process broke new ground in bringing\r\ntogether, under the umbrella of the United Nations, all\r\nthe relevant stakeholders — not the least of which were\r\ndifferent ministries within the same Government — to\r\nimprove policy coherence.\r\nSecondly, Monterrey cemented a view of poor\r\npeople and poor countries as partners in the\r\ndevelopment process, as untapped reservoirs of\r\ninitiative, not objects of pity.\r\nAnd thirdly, perhaps most important of all, both\r\ndeveloped and developing countries acknowledged\r\ntheir mutual responsibilities and mutual accountability,\r\na welcome departure from the polarizing practice of\r\npointing at what others are not doing.\r\nThe result was a new approach to dealing with\r\nissues of development finance, an approach we must\r\nsustain. My report on implementation of the\r\ncommitments and agreements made at Monterrey\r\n(A/58/216) was issued several weeks ago. I hope you\r\nare ready to improve on what is very much a mixed\r\nreport card.\r\nWhile official development assistance has\r\nincreased, it is still far short of what is required to meet\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\r\nWe have all seen what trade can do to create jobs\r\nand wealth, but we also know how subsidies and tariffs\r\nare stifling the ability of poor countries to compete\r\nfairly in the international trading system and trade their\r\nway out of poverty. Foreign direct investment in the\r\ndeveloping world, already concentrated in fewer than a\r\ndozen countries, is down. Too many developing\r\ncountries continue to carry too much debt, making it\r\nclear that the assumptions behind the Heavily Indebted\r\nPoor Countries Debt Initiative were in many ways\r\noverly optimistic and suggesting the need for an\r\ninternational framework for debt restructuring.\r\nToo many remain vulnerable to swings in\r\ncommodity and financial markets, underscoring the\r\nneed to strengthen the international financial\r\narchitecture. And too many remain excluded from\r\nmeaningful participation in the decision-making\r\nprocesses of key international bodies on economic,\r\nfinancial and trade issues — a democratic deficit that\r\nundermines confidence and impedes progress.\r\nThere is no shortage of urgent work ahead in each\r\nof these areas, and I have made recommendations to\r\nhelp point the way forward. I have also called for steps\r\nto help us get more out of the annual spring meeting\r\namong the Economic and Social Council, the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO). That meeting needs better and more focused\r\npreparation if it is to fulfil the special role given to it\r\nby the Monterrey Consensus as a guardian of\r\ncoherence, coordination and cooperation.\r\nUltimately, progress depends on leadership,\r\nleadership that can overcome domestic constraints, that\r\nrecognizes the deeply fused fates of the world’s\r\npeoples and that is committed to multilateralism as the\r\npragmatic path to shared prosperity.\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.48\r\nWe are here again in one room — ministers and\r\nsenior officials of Governments and multilateral\r\ninstitutions responsible for finance, trade, foreign\r\naffairs and development cooperation, along with\r\nrepresentatives of civil society and the private sector\r\nand other key stakeholders. We face an uncertain\r\neconomy, wide-ranging social distress and faltering\r\ntrade negotiations, which need a real jump-start at\r\nDecember’s WTO talks in Geneva. We must stay\r\ntogether, stay engaged, and make this process work.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to Mr. Gert\r\nRosenthal, President of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil.\r\nMr. Rosenthal (President of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council) (spoke in Spanish): This is an\r\nimportant event and I am very happy to be participating\r\nhere in my capacity as President of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council.\r\nThis event is important because I am convinced\r\nthat the International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment was the single most significant\r\ncontribution that the United Nations has made,\r\nthroughout its history, to the development effort. Only\r\nthe United Nations, with a little help from its friends,\r\nwould have been able to convene a meeting attracting\r\nso many heads of State or Government with a view to\r\nplacing development at the highest level of the\r\ninternational agenda. And perhaps only a United\r\nNations conference could have produced a road map\r\nfor development that was as lucid as the one contained\r\nin the Monterrey Consensus, built on the foundation of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration.\r\nNot only was great impetus given to development\r\non the international agenda but the Consensus went far\r\nbeyond rhetoric in indicating the tasks to be carried\r\nout, who should carry them out, how the responsibility\r\nof each country should interact with the responsibility\r\nof the international community and how we should\r\norganize ourselves with a view to the Consensus’\r\nrelevant implementation. The emphasis on\r\nrelationships — between Governments and civil\r\nsocieties, between the United Nations and the main\r\nmultilateral organizations and between ministries for\r\nforeign affairs and their colleagues in the economic\r\nministries — is imbued with the spirit promoted by our\r\nCharter. The Monterrey Consensus clearly offers\r\nguidance for those formulating policy at the national\r\nand international levels and establishes a follow-up\r\nmechanism. It is precisely this mechanism that we are\r\nnow seeking to perfect.\r\nIt may be recalled that paragraph 69 of the\r\nMonterrey Consensus establishes the necessary\r\nelements for monitoring and follow-up activities. The\r\nEconomic and Social Council held its first post-\r\nMonterrey spring meeting last 14 April with promising\r\nresults. You will find my report on this meeting issued\r\nas document A/58/77 of 9 May 2003. The general\r\nthrust of our dialogue, as befits the mandate of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, was to increase\r\ncoherence, cooperation and coordination of all\r\nstakeholders for the implementation of the Monterrey\r\nConsensus. Another way of describing this thrust is to\r\ndefine who does what and how to work together. We\r\nhad a fruitful dialogue, both at the level of our\r\nrespective intergovernmental representatives and\r\nbetween our respective secretariats and staff. A notable\r\ninnovation in the spring meeting was the presence, for\r\nthe first time, of an intergovernmental representation of\r\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO).\r\nWe note that, as in all complex processes, we\r\nhave experienced progress and also setbacks. Certainly,\r\nthe results of the World Trade Organization Ministerial\r\nConference in Cancún fall into the latter category, but\r\nwe must persist. If we work together, we will prevail. I\r\nam sure that I represent the feeling of all member\r\ncountries of the Economic and Social Council when I\r\npledge that, for our part, we will do all in our power to\r\nplay the role assigned to us in the Monterrey\r\nConsensus, including the possibility, when road blocks\r\nappear, to help illuminate the way forward.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to Mr. James\r\nWolfensohn, President of the World Bank.\r\nMr. Wolfensohn (World Bank): This, for the\r\nWorld Bank, is an historic occasion because I believe it\r\nis the first time that the President of the World Bank\r\nhas addressed the General Assembly on any subject. It\r\nis, of course, significant that we should be together on\r\nthe subject of financing for development, a subject that\r\nunites us and a subject on which the partnership that\r\nwe have is being tested and proven each day. We are\r\nparticularly glad to be here, and I am delighted to be\r\nhere in the presence of the Secretary-General, whose\r\nleadership in these matters is so important and so\r\ncrucial to the approach for a better world, for a\r\npeaceful world and for a world in which development\r\ncan take place.\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.48\r\nAs we review the results of the Monterrey agenda\r\nto date, we can look at, as the Secretary-General just\r\nsaid, the consensus that was reached in Monterrey and\r\nwe can address where we have progressed in terms of\r\nthe work of both the developed and the developing\r\ncountries in their undertakings given at Monterrey.\r\nLet me say by way of early observation that we\r\nare enriched in the way in which we can address how\r\nfar we have gone on development by the various\r\nmeetings that have been held by this body beyond\r\nMonterrey — the work on environment, the work on\r\ngender and the work on social issues — all of which\r\nhave given us an agenda in the international financial\r\ninstitutions that is enriched by the observations of this\r\nbody and its partners.\r\nComing to the question of where we are, we have\r\nto address rather simply the undertakings that were\r\ngiven by the developed and the developing countries.\r\nThe developed countries indicated that they would\r\nfollow the actions of the developing countries. If the\r\ndeveloping countries addressed the questions of\r\nstrengthening capacity, strengthening the legal, judicial\r\nand financial systems, and fighting corruption, all of\r\nwhich were undertakings that were given in Monterrey\r\nand reaffirmed, in the case of Africa, in the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), in\r\nreturn, the wealthy countries indicated that they would\r\nassist in capacity-building, provide additional\r\ndevelopment assistance and open their markets for\r\ntrade.\r\nSome progress has in fact been made on both\r\nsides. The countries that are developing have indeed\r\ntaken steps in terms of strengthening governance, of\r\nbuilding their infrastructure of legal and financial\r\nsystems and, to a degree, of fighting corruption. But I\r\nthink that it is not unfair to say that there is still much\r\nto be done. As I commented in my annual meeting\r\naddress, there are really no secrets in the countries\r\nrepresented here. Everyone knows the steps that need\r\nto be taken, and the issue is to take action. Everyone\r\nknows where the gaps are in structure and where those\r\nthat are corrupt are to be found, but it is difficult to\r\nmove forward. Nevertheless, it is essential to do so, if\r\nthe aims of Monterrey are to be met. The incentive is\r\nthe creation of a better world and of better\r\nopportunities, the pursuit of which need to be\r\nsupported by the wealthy countries.\r\nProgress here has at best been mixed. Yes, we\r\nhave seen and are delighted by and grateful for the $18\r\nbillion of additional funding that has been promised\r\nover the next three years. Yes, we have seen\r\ndiscussions taking place on openness of trade, but,\r\nagain, it is fair to say that with the problems of Cancún\r\nand with the reassessment of financial needs, a\r\nresponse to the questions raised in the follow-up to\r\nMonterrey is something that needs further and\r\nsignificant attention. We, in our institution, are\r\nconcerned over the imbalance that exists in terms of\r\nthe allocation of resources and the allocation of interest\r\non the development process — allocations that see us\r\nspending $800 billion on defence and $56 billion on\r\ndevelopment assistance — and which see, in terms of\r\nthe movements of people around the world, $80 billion\r\nnow in remittances for migrant workers overseas\r\ndwarfing the development assistance that is coming\r\nfrom the developed countries.\r\nIt is not a question of a lack of good will nor of a\r\nlack of intent. We have seen good progress and\r\nleadership on the part of our colleagues in the United\r\nStates and the European Union. But if, indeed, we are\r\nto address the questions of success in the Monterrey\r\nagenda, then it is necessary for each of us to improve\r\nour game — developed countries, developing countries\r\nand international institutions. We are looking at\r\nourselves, at the ways in which we can increase our\r\neffectiveness and can build a more coordinated effort\r\nand follow-up to the Rome agenda.\r\nI am delighted that within the last couple of\r\nweeks, I have had a highly constructive meeting with\r\nthe local representatives of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme. I want to assure everyone in\r\nthis Hall that the desire of our institution is to work\r\nintimately and closely with the United Nations system,\r\nbecause we believe that no results can be possible in\r\nterms of the Monterrey agenda, unless we work as\r\npartners, you and us together, with our friends in civil\r\nsociety and the private sector. I think there has been\r\nprogress, but, I must say, I think there is very much to\r\nbe done in today’s environment.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to Mr. Horst\r\nKöhler, Managing Director of the International\r\nMonetary Fund.\r\nMr. Köhler (International Monetary Fund): As\r\nwe gather here, there is important good news. The\r\nglobal economic outlook is improving. Prospects for\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.48\r\nrecovery are strengthening in the advanced economies,\r\nled by developments in the United States. This is good\r\nnews for emerging-market and developing-country\r\neconomies, which have also benefited from a\r\nsupportive financial market environment. But we know\r\nthat risks remain. Chief among these risks is the\r\nexcessive dependence of the world economy on growth\r\nin the United States and the resulting global current\r\naccount imbalances. Resolving these imbalances in an\r\norderly manner must be the primary objective of\r\ninternational economic policy. This requires a\r\ncooperative approach involving all major countries and\r\nregions. Such an approach must strengthen the\r\ndomestic forces of growth, particularly in Europe and\r\nJapan, building on the new momentum for structural\r\nreform.\r\nSound and sustained global growth remains the\r\nsingle most important condition for making decisive\r\nprogress in the fight against poverty. In the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, we now have measurable\r\nobjectives. The two pillars of the Monterrey\r\nConsensus — reflected also in Africa’s own New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development — give us a\r\ncommon policy framework defining the responsibilities\r\nof the developing countries and of the international\r\ncommunity in working towards those objectives.\r\nWith the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers\r\n(PRSP) and Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)\r\nDebt Initiative processes, we have the operational\r\nvehicles to take us to the agreed goals. Those processes\r\nare under way and, in many countries, yielding\r\nresults — albeit more slowly than many of us would\r\nlike to see. Of course, there is surely room for\r\nimprovement.\r\nBut, as we take stock, we must keep in mind the\r\nfact that progress must be achieved on the ground, in\r\neach individual country. This is the time for steadfast\r\nimplementation, not for re-embarking on a search for\r\nnew development strategies every six months.\r\nThe IMF will continue to play its role in\r\nimplementing the Monterrey Consensus. In our work\r\nwith low-income members, we are concentrating on\r\nour core areas of competence: helping them establish a\r\nframework for sound macro-economic policies and\r\ninstitutions, which is indispensable for sustained\r\ngrowth, investment and job creation. To that end, we\r\nhave reduced the scope of our conditionality by\r\nfocusing it on those areas that are central to achieving\r\nkey macro-economic objectives. We are working hard\r\nto align better the PRSP, the national budget framework\r\nand our own low-income lending facility, the Poverty\r\nReduction and Growth Facility.\r\nWe are continuing to reinforce our technical\r\nassistance and training programmes aimed at building\r\ncapacity and strong institutions in developing\r\ncountries, including through our regional technical\r\nassistance centres in the Pacific, the Caribbean and,\r\nmost recently, in East and West Africa. We are working\r\non strengthening the ability of our low-income\r\nmembers to guard against exogenous shocks and to\r\nrespond to them should they occur. Indeed, I had a very\r\nfruitful and open discussion with the “Big Table” of the\r\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Africa,\r\ntogether with Jim Wolfensohn, just yesterday.\r\nLooking ahead, we are engaged in a\r\ncomprehensive consultation with our members, donors\r\nand civil society to guide us in our future work with\r\nlow-income countries. I am really interested in this\r\nDialogue, and I am going to listen. I hope everyone\r\nalso listens to us. Our key objective is to ensure that\r\nour engagement complements that of other\r\ndevelopment partners in working towards our common\r\ngoal: decisive progress towards achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals as a concrete\r\ncontribution to the fight against poverty.\r\nBut the Monterrey Consensus extends beyond\r\npoverty alleviation. It is also about building a stronger\r\ninternational financial system that helps all countries\r\nreap the benefits of globalization. Over the past several\r\nyears, the Fund has been engaged with the international\r\ncommunity in an intensive process of reform, and I\r\nbelieve that we have made progress. We are focusing\r\nmore on vulnerabilities in financial sectors and\r\ninternational capital markets. We are strengthening the\r\nframework of rules for the global economy, in\r\ncollaboration with public- and private-sector\r\ninstitutions, by developing and implementing\r\ninternational standards and codes. We are continuing to\r\nexamine ways to improve crisis management, and crisis\r\nresolution when crises do occur. With all due modesty,\r\nI think that we have, for example, made a positive\r\ncontribution to developments in Brazil, for instance.\r\nOverall, I believe that our work has contributed to\r\nthe remarkable resilience of the international financial\r\nsystem in the face of the unprecedented shocks of the\r\npast three years. But the increasing interdependence of\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.48\r\nthe world’s economies continuously poses new\r\nchallenges for our member countries and for the IMF.\r\nThere is no room for complacency. Therefore, in our\r\nwork, we must pay even more attention to the linkages\r\nbetween countries and regions, and exercise even-\r\nhandedness, because crises can originate in mature\r\nmarkets as well as in emerging markets. Improving our\r\nability to identify risks and vulnerabilities at an early\r\nstage, and our intensified work on domestic financial\r\nsystems and international capital markets, must play a\r\ncentral role in that process. Let me add that I would be\r\nvery pleased if we could develop an early-warning\r\nsystem also in terms of political developments and\r\narmed conflicts. We are always surprised by the\r\noutbreak of armed conflict, and I think that something\r\nhas to change here.\r\nThe IMF’s effectiveness as a cooperative\r\ninstitution depends on all members’ having an\r\nappropriate voice and representation. That is agreed.\r\nWith that objective, we in the IMF have recently taken\r\nseveral steps to bolster the capacity of the offices of\r\nExecutive Directors from developing and transition\r\ncountries aimed at enhancing their effective\r\nparticipation in policy formulation and in decision-\r\nmaking. The Executive Board will continue to examine\r\nthe issues of quotas, representation and voice, and will\r\nreport next April to our Governors, with whom\r\nresponsibility for decisions lies.\r\nMore than ever before, our quest for global\r\nsolutions to global problems requires cooperation for\r\nthe global common good. The Monterrey Consensus is\r\nour joint policy framework in working towards\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. In that\r\neffort, all developments partners need to do their part.\r\nWe need to resist hypocrisy and accept our respective\r\nresponsibilities. The advanced economies need to\r\nimprove market access, reduce trade-distorting\r\nsubsidies, and provide more — and better-\r\ncoordinated — financial assistance. Developing\r\ncountries need to stay the course in strengthening\r\neconomic policies and good governance. There is still\r\ntoo much waste due to bad governance. Steadfast\r\nimplementation and improvement is the key to decisive\r\nprogress in our common fight against poverty, and the\r\nIMF stands ready to do its part.\r\nThe President: I now call on Mr. Francisco\r\nThompson-Flores, Deputy Director-General of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO).\r\nMr. Thompson-Flores (World Trade\r\nOrganization): The greatest journeys begin not with the\r\nfirst step, but with the thought, “Where are we going?”\r\nIn 2000, at the dawn of the new millennium,\r\nglobal leaders assembled in this building to set a course\r\nto a more peaceful, prosperous and just world; a safer\r\nworld; a world of less poverty, less hunger and greater\r\nopportunity in education; a healthier world that would\r\nsustain the generations to come.\r\nTwo years later, leaders gathered again — this\r\ntime in Monterrey — to decide on the tools needed to\r\nfacilitate our journey. We will arrive at our destination\r\nonly if Governments act with courage and commitment\r\nand if the international community delivers on its\r\npromise to support their efforts. Mobilizing resources\r\nfor development requires sound economic policies and\r\ngood governance at the domestic level. It requires\r\nenabling environments for foreign investment. It\r\nrequires aid and external debt relief. It also requires\r\ntrade.\r\nIn this respect, it is now recorded history that in\r\n2001 at Doha, Qatar, World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nmembers agreed to launch a new round of multilateral\r\ntrade negotiations, and further agreed that development\r\nissues and the concerns of developing countries should\r\nbe at the heart of such negotiations.\r\nThe Doha Development Agenda negotiations are\r\nextensive. They cover implementation, agriculture,\r\nmarket access for non-agricultural products, services,\r\nintellectual property, WTO rules, dispute settlement\r\nand trade and the environment. New issues are also\r\nbeing contemplated: trade and investment, competition\r\npolicy, Government procurement and trade\r\nfacilitation — the so-called Singapore issues.\r\nThe negotiations are also ambitious. They are\r\nabout locking in the tremendous gains of past rounds\r\nand making new gains. They are about improving trade\r\nconditions and market access, especially for poor\r\ncountries. And they are about refining, clarifying and\r\nstrengthening the rules that govern trading relations\r\nbetween States.\r\nThe link between trade, the Doha Development\r\nAgenda and the international community’s wider\r\nagenda for development and poverty reduction is well\r\nestablished. Poor countries need to grow their way out\r\nof poverty, and while trade can serve as a key engine of\r\nthat growth, currently the products of developing\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.48\r\ncountries face many obstacles in entering the markets\r\nof rich countries. Developing countries are further\r\nundercut by massive agricultural support in rich\r\ncountries. Thus, a broad and balanced outcome of the\r\nDoha negotiations could make a huge contribution to\r\nthe generation of resources for the financing of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nTo give perspective to this claim, according to\r\none estimate from the World Bank, a successful Doha\r\nRound could raise global income by as much as\r\n$520 billion by 2015, more than two thirds of which\r\nwill accrue to developing countries and help lift 144\r\nmillion people out of poverty. We should contrast that\r\nfigure with the $56 billion provided by rich countries\r\neach year in development assistance and relief to the\r\nheavily indebted poor countries, which is expected to\r\namount to $40 billion in present value from all\r\ncreditors.\r\nThat is, of course, just an estimate, and we could\r\nquibble about the figure. Nor do I want to understate\r\nthe importance of aid and debt relief to developing\r\ncountries; such support is vital and must continue and\r\nincrease. But realizing the Millennium Development\r\nGoals will require an estimated $50 billion a year\r\nadditional to current development assistance. Thus my\r\nbasic message is this: if Governments put their minds\r\nto it, the Doha Round could bring huge benefits —\r\nbenefits well beyond what can be delivered in any\r\nother area of international economic activity.\r\nRecently, in Cancún, our trade negotiations\r\nsuffered a setback. While a great deal of important\r\nwork was done at that meeting, assembled ministers\r\nwere unable to agree on a future agenda to bring the\r\nnegotiations to a successful conclusion by the agreed\r\ndeadline of 1 January 2005. The meeting was\r\nultimately drawn to a close on the final day when\r\nministers failed to reach consensus on the launch of\r\nnew negotiations on the Singapore issues.\r\nOf course, as the dust has settled, we have seen,\r\nin abundance, analyses and interpretations of what\r\nhappened. But members have to take collective\r\nresponsibility for the outcome of the Cancún\r\nMinisterial Conference. I do not think it would be wise\r\nor accurate to put the blame on any one country or any\r\none group of countries. Nor would it help us to move\r\nforward if we engaged in a lengthy, and ultimately\r\nuseless, process of finger-pointing and recrimination.\r\nCancún was a disappointment, but it was not a\r\ncollapse. The work programme is still in place, and\r\nWTO members are already exploring ways to move the\r\nprocess forward. The first logical step is to identify the\r\nareas of greatest difficulty in Cancún and get\r\ndelegations discussing them again as quickly as\r\npossible — in other words, get people back to work.\r\nThat is exactly what the Director-General and the\r\nChairman of the General Council are doing. Building\r\non the mandate given to officials by ministers in\r\nCancún to continue working on outstanding issues with\r\na renewed sense of urgency and purpose, Mr. Supachai\r\nand Ambassador Castillo have secured agreement\r\namong the membership to undertake new consultations\r\naimed at reinvigorating the process.\r\nIn these consultations, the focus is on the\r\ntoughest issues: the Singapore issues, agriculture, the\r\ncotton initiative and market access for non-agricultural\r\nproducts. We are hopeful that good progress will be\r\nmade by the time senior officials assemble in Geneva\r\nin mid-December.\r\nCancún has shown us, in a rather brutal fashion,\r\nthat the Doha Development Agenda is extremely\r\nambitious and complex. At the same time, by\r\nreaffirming all their Doha declarations and decisions,\r\nministers have reminded us of the importance and\r\nrelevance of those ambitions and of the fact that there\r\nis a great deal at stake in the negotiations.\r\nWe must also carry forward the lessons learned at\r\nCancún and be cognizant of the new pressures evident\r\nat the meeting. Cancún saw the emergence of new\r\ngroupings and countries banding together as never\r\nbefore to advance their common interests. These new\r\nalliances, and the simple truth of developing countries’\r\nincreasing activism in the multilateral trading system,\r\nadds greatly to the complexity of our Doha\r\nundertaking. We must recognize the increased\r\ncomplexity and ensure it is adequately accommodated\r\nin our work programme.\r\nAt the same time, we welcome the surer voice\r\nthat developing countries are finding in our\r\nnegotiations, as well as the opportunity presented to\r\nensure the round is comprehensive, in terms of both\r\nsubstance and participation.\r\nWe have a real chance to re-energize the Doha\r\nprocess by the end of the year. But success will hinge\r\non the political will of all WTO members. Let us not\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.48\r\nforget that our WTO members are, for the most part,\r\nthe same Members of the United Nations that three\r\nyears ago set the course to a new world by 2015. The\r\ndetermination that they show in our negotiations is part\r\nof a greater journey that is being made by, and on\r\nbehalf of, humanity as a whole.\r\nWe can still reach the destination established by\r\nleaders at the Millennium Summit. But we will have to\r\nmove apace. Half the world’s people are still struggling\r\nto live on less than $2 a day. We must respond to their\r\nplight.\r\nThis High-level Dialogue is a chance to remind\r\nourselves why we have set the course that we have set,\r\nand to recommit to this great journey.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to\r\nMr. Rubens Ricupero, Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development.\r\nMr. Ricupero (United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Development): The Monterrey Consensus\r\nwas a holistic approach to the problems of financing\r\nfor development. It provided a catalogue of the\r\nnecessary factors to ensure financial support for\r\nsustained and sustainable growth. However, the\r\nConsensus did not provide a blueprint that guarantees\r\neconomic growth and development. It was not a point\r\nof arrival, but a point of departure for an ongoing\r\nprocess — a work in progress that must keep abreast of\r\nrapid changes in the global economy.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) is pleased to have\r\nparticipated in the process that produced the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report that we are considering, and we stand\r\nready to continue our participation in areas where our\r\ncontributions may prove useful.\r\nThe challenge that faces us today is, first, to make\r\na clear distinction between the implementation of the\r\ncommitments made at Monterrey and the follow-up of\r\nchanges in areas in which the Consensus needs to be\r\nextended and amplified.\r\nIn assessing our progress, we should bear in mind\r\nthat the impetus for a conference on financing for\r\ndevelopment originated in the negative net transfers of\r\nreal resources sustained by many Latin American\r\ncountries in the aftermath of the 1980s debt crisis —\r\nwhat has come to be called the “lost decade” of\r\ndevelopment. As the Secretary-General noted in his\r\nremarks, the net financial flows in the recent period are\r\nstill from the developing world to the developed world.\r\nIndeed, this year — as the Secretary-General\r\nsuggested — we will in all likelihood experience the\r\nseventh year of negative net flows of financial\r\nresources from developing to developed countries. That\r\nsuggests that we may be in another “lost decade”.\r\nUnfortunately, some countries — such as\r\nArgentina and Bolivia — that were early in\r\nimplementing the measures that were eventually\r\nincluded in the Consensus are now experiencing living\r\nstandards far below those of the “lost decade” and find\r\nthemselves excluded from external financing\r\npossibilities — not because of, but despite, the\r\nindispensable reforms that they adopted. It is\r\nencouraging that the International Monetary Fund has\r\nbeen able to agree to extend its existing support\r\nprogramme to the new Argentine Government,\r\ncontributing to the programme for economic recovery.\r\nIt is even more important for the international\r\ncommunity to make a concerted and rapid effort in\r\nsupport of Bolivia in its current dire economic crisis if\r\nthat country is to avoid the decline in domestic stability\r\nthat Argentina and other Latin American countries\r\nhave experienced and that could easily spread to\r\nfurther areas if that trend is not reversed.\r\nThe one relatively bright spot in financial flows\r\nfor development is that flows of foreign direct\r\ninvestment have remained positive, despite the\r\ndownturn in other flows. Nonetheless, they have\r\ndeclined substantially, despite the steps taken by\r\ndeveloping countries in the aftermath of Monterrey to\r\nattract and absorb increased flows of foreign direct\r\ninvestment. That brings us back to the holistic nature\r\nof our discussions, for the decline in foreign direct\r\ninvestment flows appears in large part to be the result\r\nof the decline in global growth — particularly in the\r\ndeveloped countries — and suggests a direct\r\ninterrelationship between global demand and global\r\nfinancial flows. When investors are retrenching at\r\nhome, their interest in foreign ventures tends to be\r\nreduced, irrespective of the domestic policies\r\nundertaken to attract foreign investment flows.\r\nThe same process appears to be at work in the\r\nfactors determining the growth of global trade, which\r\nfor some years has surpassed the growth of global\r\nincomes. As a result of the slowdown in global\r\nexpansion, the growth in global trade has fallen, more\r\nor less in step with the decline in capital flows. That\r\nrelationship is especially important for the prices of the\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.48\r\nmajor export commodities of the most vulnerable least\r\ndeveloped counties, as well as for a majority of\r\nlandlocked economies and small island developing\r\nStates. In that regard, I should like to draw the\r\nattention of Members to the summary of the recent\r\nGeneral Assembly panel discussion on commodities,\r\nwhich the President of the General Assembly will\r\ntransmit to the Second Committee.\r\nAlthough it is true that it is global growth that\r\nwill drive trade expansion — not the other way\r\naround — it is indispensable to resume the trade\r\nnegotiations of the World Trade Organization from the\r\npoint where they were interrupted in Cancún, in order\r\nto deliver — in time and at the right level of\r\nambition — the development promises made in the\r\nDoha Declaration.\r\nThere is a very clear interrelationship between\r\nglobal growth and the growth of trade and finance,\r\nwhich the Consensus considers to be the basis for\r\nincreased financial resources for developing countries.\r\nIt is an area in which greater policy coordination and\r\nconsistency could produce more general benefits. That\r\nwould mean analysing national policies, in terms of not\r\nonly their compatibility with goals aimed at domestic\r\neconomic stability, but also their contribution to the\r\nstability of global growth.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment has been persistent in pointing out the\r\nnecessity of better policy coordination among the\r\nmajor industrialized countries in order to eliminate the\r\nmajor macroeconomic imbalances that are a major\r\ncause of volatility in exchange rates and international\r\ncapital flows, impeding sustained financing flows to\r\ndeveloping countries. As part of the partnership\r\nbetween developed and developing countries that\r\nproduced the Monterrey Consensus, we all need to\r\nwork harder to develop policies consistent with the\r\ndual goals of domestic and global stability.\r\nThe monitoring of the consistency of national\r\npolicies with respect to employment growth was a\r\nmandate that was to be given to the Economic and\r\nSocial Council more than 50 years ago under the\r\nHavana Charter, which, as the Assembly will recall,\r\nwas the outcome of the United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Employment. But the Havana Charter was\r\nnever implemented, and the Article IV surveillance\r\nprovided for in the International Monetary Fund\r\nArticles of Agreement has tended to concentrate on the\r\nappropriateness of national policies for domestic\r\nstability rather than on their compatibility with global\r\ngrowth. Given the greater participatory and universal\r\ncharacter of the United Nations process, this is indeed\r\nan area in which the Economic and Social Council —\r\nwith the support of the Financing for Development\r\nOffice — could provide an appropriate forum for the\r\ndiscussion of increased policy coherence, which could\r\nproduce a global growth environment conducive to the\r\nattainment of the domestic policy objectives set for\r\ndeveloping countries. Now that the international\r\ncommunity is reflecting on the profound reforms called\r\nfor by the Secretary-General, that could indeed\r\nrepresent a useful building block for the new\r\ninternational architecture that we all wish to see in the\r\nfuture.\r\nThe President: I now call on Mr. Mark Malloch\r\nBrown, Administrator of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, in his capacity as Chairman\r\nof the United Nations Development Group.\r\nMr. Malloch Brown (United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme): It is a great pleasure to\r\naddress this gathering and to share this platform with\r\nmy colleagues from the international financial\r\ninstitutions, as well as my United Nations colleagues.\r\nThis meeting shows that we recognize that this is a\r\ncrucial time in our effort to mobilize the domestic and\r\ninternational financial resources needed to build a more\r\njust and equitable world.\r\nToday, we must remember, the world is more\r\nunequal and more insecure than ever: we live in a\r\nworld of 6 billion people, 1 billion of whom own 80\r\nper cent of global wealth, while another billion struggle\r\nto survive on less than a dollar a day. It is that\r\ninequality that confronts us as policy makers and as\r\nhuman beings with consciences, particularly so because\r\npoverty on this scale is no longer inevitable; it does not\r\nhave to be. Unlike generations past, we now possess\r\nthe global means, the know-how and the record of\r\ndevelopment success to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals agreed by all 189 Member States\r\nat the United Nations Millennium Summit: to halve\r\npoverty, remove hunger, put every boy and girl in\r\nschool and stem the current health and environmental\r\ncrises by 2015.\r\nBut while we have the global means, the political\r\nwill can be much more erratic. Last week in Madrid we\r\nsaw an extraordinary expression of political will in the\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.48\r\nfund-raising commitment to assist the people of Iraq. I\r\nobserved at that meeting that if we could consistently\r\napply that same will, with the same urgency and focus,\r\nto the continuing needs of poor countries, then we\r\ncould put in place the resources and the policy reforms\r\nin the North and the South to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015.\r\nThe Monterrey International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development signalled a unique\r\nmoment: a new political consensus was forged on how\r\nto finance development and resolve the extremes of\r\npoverty we have now. A global deal was struck, built\r\naround a partnership where sustained political and\r\neconomic reform, more private investment and better\r\ngovernance by developing countries is matched by\r\ndirect support from the developed world in the form of\r\ntrade, aid and investment.\r\nFollowing Monterrey, the nearly decade-long\r\ndecline in official development assistance was\r\nreversed, rising from $52 billion in 2001 to $57 billion\r\nin 2002. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation\r\nand Development calculations show pledges of an\r\nadditional $16 billion by 2006, including a number of\r\nnew aid arrangements, such as the Millennium\r\nChallenge Account proposed by the United States.\r\nHowever, even if the commitments made at Monterrey\r\nare fulfilled, and I am increasingly doubtful that we\r\nwill meet the 2006 target, the total will still fall short\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals’ requirement of\r\n$100 billion a year — a calculation made by former\r\nPresident Zedillo of Mexico and former Secretary of\r\nthe United States Treasury Bob Rubin.\r\nEven assuming developing countries raise\r\ndomestic resources, pursue good macroeconomic\r\npolicies and tackle corruption, the other half of the\r\nbargain — increased international resources for\r\ndevelopment — is not yet in place. Key to the\r\ncommitments made at Monterrey was the consensus on\r\nthe importance of country ownership, reflected in\r\nnationally owned development strategies backed by\r\ninternational support.\r\nThe United Nations system, under the overall\r\ncoordination of the United Nations Development\r\nGroup, which I chair, has worked hard to implement\r\nthe Monterrey Consensus. We have made a major push\r\nto provide concrete, coordinated country assistance\r\nclearly aligned behind the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. We are also working closely with the World\r\nBank to integrate those Goals into nationally owned\r\npoverty reduction strategy papers. Strategy papers\r\ndriven by the Millennium Development Goals will\r\ngenerate the kind of pro-poor economic strategies that\r\nall of us in the United Nations and in the international\r\nfinancial institutions want to see.\r\nThe United Nations Development Group is also\r\nfollowing up on the commitments made at the High-\r\nlevel Forum on Harmonization, held in Rome in\r\nFebruary of this year, to streamline donor procedures\r\nand practices based on the principle of full country\r\nownership, which also has a vital role to play in\r\nimplementing the Monterrey Consensus and achieving\r\nan outcome-oriented development cooperation policy.\r\nBut the success or failure of the entire vision of\r\nMonterrey depends fundamentally on a larger vision of\r\nglobal partnership. The Millennium Development\r\nGoals may be the ultimate bottom-up approach to\r\ndevelopment with their clear focus on the pocketbook,\r\npeople-centred issues of health, education and a\r\nsustainable environment; but they are also part of a\r\nglobal vision that sets out a mutual commitment to\r\nprogress, struck at the highest political levels, between\r\ndeveloped and developing countries.\r\nNo matter how successful and focused on the\r\nMillennium Development Goals the reform undertaken\r\nby developing countries, no matter how coordinated the\r\nsupport of development agencies and civil society, the\r\nfirst seven Goals will simply not be achieved if donors\r\ndo not also do their part on Goal 8. Development\r\nassistance, investment and, as we have already heard\r\ntoday, trade, are all of crucial importance to developing\r\ncountries. Indeed, the failure at Cancún to agree on the\r\npolicies needed to create a pro-poor, legitimate, global\r\ntrade strategy that the Doha Development Agenda was\r\ncommitted to achieving was a disappointing step\r\nbackwards in terms of implementing the commitments\r\nmade at Monterrey. I listened carefully to what my\r\ncolleague from the World Trade Organization had to\r\nsay and hope that this can be reversed.\r\nWe must all now recommit ourselves to the spirit\r\nof that partnership between poor and rich countries that\r\nwe witnessed at Monterrey. Let’s not douse that flame.\r\nWe must forge ahead in achieving our common goal, as\r\nthe Monterrey Consensus stipulated:\r\n“to eradicate poverty, achieve sustained economic\r\ngrowth and promote sustainable development as\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.48\r\nwe advance to a fully inclusive and equitable\r\nglobal economic system”.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to Mr. John\r\nLintjer, Vice-President of Finance and Administration\r\nof the Asian Development Bank.\r\nMr. Lintner (Asian Development Bank): On\r\nbehalf of the African and Asian Development Banks,\r\nlet me first say that it is an honour and a pleasure to be\r\nhere today. We appreciate the United Nations\r\nrecognition of the importance of the regional\r\ndevelopment banks in the Monterrey Consensus and in\r\nmeeting the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nMonterrey was groundbreaking — both in achieving a\r\nconsensus on a framework for development finance and\r\nin bringing greater inclusiveness to discussions such as\r\nours today.\r\nThe special attributes of the regional development\r\nbanks provide advantages in tackling the problems of\r\nequity in development. Four of these are of particular\r\nimportance.\r\nFirst, as regional institutions, we work in close\r\npartnership with and include many representatives from\r\nour developing member countries. This has enabled our\r\ncontinuing leadership in such important areas as\r\ngovernance, the fight against corruption, and the\r\npromotion of gender-awareness in development.\r\nSecondly, we are mandated by our charters to\r\nsupport regional integration and cooperation, and\r\nsubregional trade facilitation is an important element of\r\nthe Asian Development Bank. Countries in our region\r\nhave pulled themselves out of poverty through trade —\r\nmuch of it within Asia. Our work in this area is\r\ncomplementary to and is geared towards the effort to\r\nachieve greater global integration.\r\nThirdly, we support the development of regional\r\nprojects for the public good, such as providing cross-\r\ncountry approaches for tackling AIDS, tuberculosis and\r\nmalaria in Africa and stemming the tide of the\r\ntrafficking of women and children in Asia.\r\nFourthly, the regional development banks are also\r\nmandated to give special emphasis and attention to the\r\nneeds of the smaller countries in our regions. Mostly,\r\nthese are also the poorest nations, often with the least\r\nvoice in the international system yet facing the most\r\ndifficult odds in meeting their development goals. We\r\ngive special consideration and visibility to the needs of\r\nthese countries in our programmes and strategies.\r\nWe believe that these attributes are useful not\r\nonly for the regional development banks but also for\r\nthe broader development community in implementing\r\nthe Monterrey Consensus and in achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nWith regard to the commitments we made at\r\nMonterrey, we are undertaking special steps. We are\r\nsharpening our focus on results; our country\r\nprogrammes are aligned with country-driven poverty\r\nreduction strategies that emphasize achievement of the\r\nGoals; and we are improving our systems for\r\nmonitoring and evaluation at all levels. We are actively\r\nharmonizing our operational procedures and processes\r\nwith the Bretton Woods institutions and the bilateral\r\ndonors and within the United Nations system.\r\nWe are addressing issues of development\r\nsustainability and issues of debt sustainability. The\r\nneed for external financing to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals in low-income countries, and\r\nparticularly in many countries in Africa, might result in\r\nfuture debt crises in the absence of the implementation\r\nof the Monterrey Consensus. The case here is being\r\nmade for more grant and concessional funding for\r\nthose countries, and donors have taken an important\r\nstep in the right direction by agreeing on a grant\r\nfacility in the context of the resource mobilization\r\nefforts of the African Development Fund.\r\nWe have expanding regional and country-specific\r\nagendas in the areas of domestic finance and trade.\r\nParticularly in Asia and Latin America, foreign direct\r\ninvestment, mobilization of domestic resources and\r\ngrowth through trade will be important elements of\r\nfinancing for development. Regional development\r\nbanks are working with countries to improve the\r\nbusiness environment, strengthen the rule of law and\r\nimprove tax and customs facilities. We also work to\r\nstrengthen Governments in planning, use and\r\naccountability with respect to those resources.\r\nIn recognition of the importance of all actors in\r\nachieving sustainable development, we are increasing\r\nparticipation and voice in our projects, programmes\r\nand strategies. At the country level, this means greater\r\ninclusion of civil society and concerned parties; at the\r\ninstitutional level, it means greater outreach and\r\npartnership with international and regional\r\norganizations, as well as more accessible information\r\nabout our organizations and their operations.\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.48\r\nWe are also participating more actively in global\r\nforums on financing for development. The Monterrey\r\nConsensus has helped provide a place and voice for our\r\ninstitutions. We, as regional development banks, plan\r\nto utilize that space to strengthen regional perspectives\r\nin the ongoing discussions and commitments.\r\nIn conclusion, we appreciate the leadership of the\r\nUnited Nations in development finance, and we support\r\nthe spirit of cohesion kindled at Monterrey. We hope\r\nthat these efforts will continue to pay off in resolving\r\nissues of development finance and in sustaining\r\nattention to the importance of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. We, as regional development\r\nbanks, are committed to doing our part.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to\r\nMs. Mervat Tallawy, Executive Secretary of the\r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Western Asia.\r\nMs. Tallawy (Economic and Social Commission\r\nfor Western Africa): I have the honour to make this\r\nstatement, in my capacity as the current coordinator, on\r\nbehalf of the regional economic and social\r\ncommissions of the United Nations, namely, the\r\nEconomic Commission for Europe (ECE), the\r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the\r\nPacific (ESCAP), the Economic Commission for Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the Economic\r\nCommission for Africa (ECA) and the Economic and\r\nSocial Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA).\r\nFirst, let me express my gratitude to the\r\nAssembly for inviting the regional commissions to this\r\ndebate. Indeed, the regional commissions were\r\ninvolved in the Monterrey process from the beginning\r\nand are still engaged in the follow-up to Monterrey.\r\nAs mandated by the General Assembly as well as\r\nby our respective commissions, all of the regional\r\ncommissions have been closely involved in the\r\nfinancing for development process, at both the\r\npreparatory and follow-up stages of the Monterrey\r\nConference. The commissions remain active in support\r\nof the efforts of their member States to promote\r\nsuccessful negotiations in the Doha round and to\r\nfacilitate membership in the World Trade Organization\r\nfor those developing countries that remain outside its\r\norbit. Perhaps of greater significance is the fact that\r\nbecause of their in-house multidisciplinary capacities,\r\nthe regional commissions are uniquely well placed to\r\nintegrate implementation of the Monterrey Consensus\r\nwith that of the outcomes of the other global\r\nconferences, in particular the Johannesburg Summit,\r\nand to truly treat it as a development agenda.\r\nAs members are well aware, global analyses and\r\naggregates, important though they are in their own\r\nright, often provide an incomplete picture and hide\r\nsome of the stark realities, thereby necessitating\r\nregional and subregional approaches. Proximity to the\r\nfield enables us also to undertake more in-depth\r\nanalyses and facilitates exchange of experiences, both\r\nregionally and interregionally.\r\nAs the Secretary-General’s current report on the\r\nMillennium Declaration (A/58/323) indicates, 37 of the\r\n67 countries for which data were available experienced\r\nincreased poverty rates during the 1990s. With the\r\nrecent downturn in the global economy, the situation in\r\nmany developing countries has grown worse. With the\r\nexception of East, South-East and South Asia, in every\r\nregion the poverty situation has deteriorated. Even in\r\nthose regions of Asia that have done relatively better,\r\nmany pockets remain stagnant or are worse off in\r\nabsolute terms.\r\nTrade was underlined as the engine of growth in\r\nthe Monterrey Consensus. It is of utmost importance to\r\nimprove market access for the developing countries.\r\nThis particularly requires the elimination of trade-\r\ndistorting subsidies and the reduction of support\r\nmeasures for agriculture in developed countries. As for\r\nfinancial cooperation, it is crystal clear that official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) should be increased\r\nmarkedly from current levels if we are to stand a\r\nchance of achieving the Millennium Development\r\nGoals by 2015.\r\nThe fact is that development needs financing,\r\ninvestment and, most important of all, opportunities for\r\ntrade, none of which, unfortunately, are very\r\nforthcoming in most of the developing regions.\r\nECLAC estimates that net transfer of resources for the\r\nregion of Latin America and the Caribbean will be\r\nnegative for the fifth year running. In Africa, ECA data\r\nshow that roughly 80 cents on every dollar that flowed\r\ninto Africa flowed back as capital flights in the same\r\nyear, suggesting widespread capital flight fuelled by\r\ndebt. In West Asia too, capital flight is huge. West\r\nAsia’s share of foreign direct investment in 2002\r\naccounted for a meagre percentage of the world’s total,\r\nnot quite 0.7 per cent, and this was channelled to a\r\nlimited number of sectors, namely oil, gas and tourism.\r\nNational savings and foreign investment, as well as the\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.48\r\ngrowth rate in general, have decreased due to conflict,\r\nwar and political instability in the region. Moreover, all\r\nthe developing regions have been experiencing ever\r\nhigher levels of public debt, signalling significantly\r\nless manoeuvrability in terms of public policy.\r\nThere are, however, some new positive initiatives\r\nthat are forthcoming at the regional and subregional\r\nlevels. In June 2003, 11 Asia-Pacific central banks\r\nagreed to pool $1 billion of their foreign exchange\r\nreserves to establish the Asian Bond Fund. Since then,\r\ntheir finance ministers have been busy planning for the\r\ndevelopment of local currency bond markets to harness\r\nthe vast savings for investment of that region. In\r\nAfrica, under the framework of the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD), the efforts of\r\ncountries to create an enabling atmosphere for\r\nsustainable development have received further impetus.\r\nSeveral of the African countries have also successfully\r\ninitiated capital market development.\r\nLatin America has been a pioneer in making\r\nsuccessful experiments, with innovative ways of\r\ndealing with the pension problem that looms large in\r\nmost of our countries, developed and developing alike.\r\nArab banks and development funds have increased\r\ntheir financing of infrastructure and mega-projects in\r\nthe ESCWA region.\r\nIn all the regions and subregions, economic\r\nintegration movements are gaining new momentum.\r\nThere is wide acknowledgement that a system that\r\nrelies on networks of global and regional institutions is\r\nboth more efficient and more equitable, for which the\r\nUnited Nations provides the ideal platform.\r\nWe must generate new momentum to accelerate\r\nthe pace of development at the country, regional and\r\nglobal levels, and we must keep the interests and needs\r\nof the developing countries in the forefront. We need to\r\nsignificantly increase the flow of financial resources,\r\nboth ODA and private capital, to developing countries\r\nand simultaneously remove the restrictions imposed on\r\ntheir exports, particularly of agricultural products.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to indicate that for all\r\nof us in the five regional commissions the follow-up to\r\nthe Monterrey Consensus is an area of focused and\r\nhigh priority activity in our respective work\r\nprogrammes for the 2004-2005 biennium. We in the\r\nregional commissions similarly attach high priority to\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and to regional\r\nintegration. We in the regional commissions will\r\ncontinue to work hard on all these areas and on the\r\nintegrated follow-up of global conferences through in-\r\ndepth analysis, capacity-building, sharing of best\r\npractices and exchange of experiences, providing\r\nadvisory services and promoting policy dialogue. In\r\nshort, the five United Nations regional commissions\r\nstrongly intend to remain engaged.\r\nThe President: I now invite representatives to go\r\nto Conference Room 4 for the informal interactive\r\ndialogue of the High-level Dialogue on financing for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.20 a.m.\r\n"
