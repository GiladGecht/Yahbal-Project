(Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 6.25 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 104\r\nFollow-up to the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development:\r\n(b) High-level dialogue for the implementation of\r\nthe outcome of the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/58/216 and\r\nA/58/323)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/58/436)\r\nReport of the Economic and Social Council\r\n(A/58/3, Parts I-II)\r\nSummary by the President of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council (A/58/77 and Add. 1 and 2)\r\nConference Room Paper (A/58/CRP.2)\r\nThe President: The following represents my\r\nassessment of the interactive dialogue in the General\r\nAssembly on financing for development.\r\nGovernments, international institutions and non-\r\nGovernment stakeholders who participated in our\r\ndialogue have clearly signalled their continued strong\r\nsupport for the unique Monterrey process. This is\r\ncritical for full implementation of the Monterrey\r\nConsensus. Speakers were frank in their assessment\r\nof implementation, and progress — when it had\r\noccurred — was welcomed.\r\nBut much more is required, and there has been\r\nslippage in some areas, notably in disappointing\r\ndevelopments in international trade and financial\r\ntransfers. There were many calls for a more precise\r\nmechanism for monitoring, as we go forward, the\r\nMonterrey commitments and the targets embodied in\r\nGoal 8 of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nBoth developed and developing countries should\r\nreport on actions being taken to implement the\r\nMonterrey Consensus. The essential issue in delivering\r\nthe Monterrey Consensus is political will, and many\r\nspeakers called for the need to explore ways to muster\r\nthe required political will. Certain developed countries\r\ndescribed an approach that explicitly seeks greater\r\ncoherence among Government policies and that, in so\r\ndoing, would raise the visibility of the commitment to\r\ndevelopment. In this approach, legislation would\r\nrequire that decisions taken in different policy areas\r\nshould be explicitly found consistent with development\r\ncommitments.\r\nWe also learned that parliamentarians in\r\ndeveloping countries are becoming more intimately\r\ninvolved in development and economic reform issues\r\nand that international support is engaged in indirect\r\ndiscussions with international financial institutions and\r\nbilateral donors on proposed programmes. This is a\r\npractical means for promoting “ownership” of reforms.\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.49\r\nMany called for an increase in core resources for\r\nUnited Nations development assistance. There was a\r\nuniversal concern that the international trade\r\nnegotiations in the World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nshould resume as soon as possible and work\r\nexpeditiously towards an effective development\r\nconclusion.\r\nSome Governments expressed concern about the\r\nabuse of anti-dumping measures exemplifying a\r\nconcern about how the WTO was functioning. A\r\nnumber of speakers emphasized the important role that\r\nregional cooperation can play in trade and financial\r\nissues and that it should be promoted further.\r\nConcerns were expressed about international\r\ncommodity markets, the exposure of developing\r\ncountries’ farmers to market vulnerability and to\r\nvolatile and low prices, and the need to consider this\r\nmatter at the United Nations in a more comprehensive\r\nand focused manner. One proposal was to adjust\r\ndevelopment assistance to counter the declines in\r\ncycles of commodity prices. Another idea was to\r\nconsider some mechanism for commodity price\r\nguarantees for poor countries. Some delegations called\r\nfor a more meaningful institutional relationship\r\nbetween the United Nations and the WTO. This was\r\nsuggested by civil society.\r\nWhile increases in aid were reported and\r\ncommitments to further increased official development\r\nassistance were reiterated, the large gap between\r\nexpected flows and what is needed to realize the\r\nMillennium Development Goals remained very large.\r\nNo one questioned that this was so or gave us the\r\nanswer as to how to close the gap.\r\nThe importance of increasing aid to support rural\r\ndevelopment and agriculture in developing countries\r\nwas emphasized. The need of this sector was the focus\r\nof the high-level segment of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil last summer. Speakers expressed\r\ndisappointment at how slow the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt Initiative has been to deliver relief, and\r\nquestions about the adequacy of the relief were raised.\r\nA number of creditor countries said they were willing\r\nto revisit the issue of topping-up, which is a\r\nmechanism to deepen debt relief for heavily indebted\r\npoor countries when they complete their programme\r\nand still do not have — or would not have had —\r\nsufficient relief.\r\nMore generally, there seems to be considerable\r\ninterest in undertaking further international work on\r\nhow to resolve sovereign debt crises and how to be\r\nmore successful in preventing them. It was felt by\r\nmany that the United Nations could help facilitate such\r\nconsiderations, such as through the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposed informal study group or an independent\r\ninternational arbitration group under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations. While there are common financing\r\nneeds for development, differentiated support is needed\r\nfor emerging countries, middle-income countries, least\r\ndeveloped countries and land-locked and small island\r\ndeveloping States. Some speakers focused attention on\r\nremittances as a major source of financial flows from\r\ndeveloped to developing countries. There were some\r\nefforts to make such transfers less costly and simpler.\r\nThere is a need to strengthen international cooperation\r\non tax matters, and there was strong interest in\r\npursuing the Secretary-General’s proposal to upgrade\r\nthe Ad Hoc Group of Experts on Cooperation in Tax\r\nMatters. An enhanced dialogue on tax issues should be\r\nglobal and include the full representation of small\r\nStates.\r\nThere were strong calls for additional, new and\r\ninnovative sources of financing for development. Many\r\nspeakers reiterated the need to establish and\r\nconsolidate democratic structures at the domestic level\r\nfor better governance, including through improved\r\ntransparency, anti-corruption regulations and measures\r\nto combat money-laundering. There is equal concern to\r\nstrengthen democratic processes at the global level, in\r\nparticular to enhance the participation of developing\r\ncountries and countries with economies in transition in\r\ninternational financial institutions, and in more settled\r\nand standard ways. The United Nations, through the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, could play a larger role\r\nas a forum for discussion on macroeconomic policy\r\ncoordination at the global level.\r\nSeveral countries were concerned about\r\nreforming the Economic and Social Council in order to\r\nmake it more effective in international economic and\r\nsocial affairs and, in particular, to maintain the\r\nmomentum of the financing for development process.\r\nOne specific proposal was to expand the Bureau of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. Another proposal was to\r\ncreate an Economic and Social Security Council. Yet\r\nanother was for the formation of an intergovernmental\r\nbody to adequately prepare for the Monterrey follow-\r\nup meeting.\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.49\r\nIn addition, there were proposals to form, under\r\nthe financing for development umbrella, various\r\ninformal, multistakeholder working groups to address\r\nvarious technical policy issues, such as financial sector\r\ndevelopment, financial cooperation, tax matters and\r\ndebt arbitration. A number of speakers from developing\r\ncountries described efforts in the area of South-South\r\nfinancial cooperation. That included assistance to least\r\ndeveloped regional partners and South-South debt\r\nrelief.\r\nWe have had two full days of holistic interactive\r\ndialogue on financing for development. We have\r\nreviewed all chapters of the Monterrey Consensus, and\r\nwe have heard from practically all stakeholders. I want\r\nto personally thank all of you for participating, and, in\r\nparticular, the Secretariat for their usual tremendous\r\nsupport.\r\nI have shared with you highlights of our dialogue\r\nand will submit a more comprehensive summary to the\r\nSecond Committee, as mandated. Let us leave here\r\ncommitted to act and implement what we have\r\narticulated in words over the last couple of days. It is\r\nwith pleasure — and I am sure with great relief to some\r\nof you — that I declare the High-level Dialogue on\r\nFinancing for Development to be closed.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.35 p.m.\r\n"
