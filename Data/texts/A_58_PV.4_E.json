Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 47 (continued)\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the twenty-sixth special\r\nsession: implementation of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS\r\nHigh-level plenary meetings devoted to the\r\nfollow-up to the outcome of the twenty-sixth\r\nspecial session and the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/184)\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Colin Powell, Secretary of State of the United\r\nStates of America.\r\nMr. Powell (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States Health and Human Services Secretary,\r\nTommy Thompson, and I are pleased to join in this\r\nhigh-level plenary and to reaffirm President Bush’s\r\nabiding commitment to the global fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nPresident Bush believes strongly that the advance\r\nof freedom and hope is challenged by the spread of\r\nAIDS, and all who join in the worldwide campaign\r\nagainst AIDS serve on the front lines of freedom and\r\nhope.\r\nTwo years ago, our heads of State and\r\nGovernment assembled here for a special session on\r\nthe global HIV/AIDS crisis. We solemnly adopted a\r\ncomprehensive Declaration of Commitment that could\r\nhelp turn the pandemic around. In the two years since\r\nthat special session, 6 million more people have died of\r\nAIDS, and 10 million more have been infected with the\r\nHIV virus that causes AIDS. In all, 42 million people\r\nnow live with the disease, and tens of millions are at\r\nrisk — high risk — of infection.\r\nMost of those infected are between the ages of 15\r\nand 24, and nearly half of them are women. As so\r\nmany here have done, I, too, have looked into the eyes\r\nof young mothers terminally ill with AIDS – mothers\r\nwho fear their children’s uncertain future more than\r\nthey fear their own certain death. The mothers make\r\nmemory books so that their children will have\r\nsomething to touch and hold and remind them that once\r\nupon a time there was someone who loved them.\r\nAIDS has left 15 million orphans, and, unless we\r\nstem the tide, that number will swell to 25 million by\r\nthe end of this decade. The vast majority of those\r\nchildren are likely to live without emotional support,\r\nwithout the barest of physical necessities, and without\r\nany prospects for the future. Unless we act effectively,\r\nthese precious children are likely to perish in the same\r\ncycle of disease, destitution, despair and death that\r\ntook the lives of their parents.\r\nThe appalling statistics do not begin to describe\r\nthe magnitude of the destruction wrought by AIDS.\r\nAIDS is more devastating than any terrorist attack, any\r\nconflict or any weapon of mass destruction. It kills\r\nindiscriminately and without mercy. As cruel as any\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\ntyrant, the virus can crush the human spirit. It is an\r\ninsidious and relentless foe. AIDS shatters families,\r\ntears the fabric of societies and undermines\r\nGovernments. AIDS can destroy countries and\r\ndestabilize entire regions.\r\nTwo years after the United Nations special\r\nsession, AIDS continues to present all of us with\r\nprofound moral, political, economic and security\r\nchallenges. Two years after the adoption of our\r\nDeclaration of Commitment, the international\r\ncommunity continues to face an AIDS crisis of global\r\nproportions.\r\nOur task remains enormous, yet important\r\nprogress has been made. Only two years ago, the\r\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria\r\nwas still just an idea endorsed by President Bush and\r\nSecretary-General Annan. Today it is a reality. Two\r\nyears ago President Bush pledged the founding $200\r\nmillion for the Global Fund. Our pledge has risen to\r\n$1.6 billion, out of the total of $4.7 billion in pledges\r\nmade to date worldwide. The United States proudly\r\nremains the largest single contributor to the Fund.\r\nNew contributions to the Fund are coming in\r\nfrom around the globe, and grants have been approved\r\nto more than 90 countries. The Fund is already helping\r\nto deliver lifesaving treatments and to prevent new\r\ninfections. This month the members of the World Trade\r\nOrganization agreed on a framework for implementing\r\nthe Doha Declaration on Trade-related Aspects of\r\nIntellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) and on public\r\nhealth. This will give poor countries greater access to\r\nlow-cost, high-quality medicines that are needed to\r\ntreat diseases such as HIV/AIDS.\r\nAt the same time, the vital incentives for research\r\ninto the next generation of treatments will be\r\npreserved. Since the special session two years ago, we\r\nhave also seen a change in attitudes. Like all great\r\nevils, AIDS feeds on ignorance and fear. When people\r\nlack knowledge of how infection can be prevented, and\r\nwhen those infected are stigmatized and driven into the\r\nshadows, the virus thrives and hope withers.\r\nMore and more public figures are speaking out,\r\nshattering the silence that kills. They are sending the\r\nmessage that people living with AIDS should not be\r\ntreated with cruelty and discrimination, but, instead,\r\nwith dignity and with compassion.\r\nIndeed, the Declaration of Commitment has given\r\nall of us ideas that have helped to focus our efforts. We\r\nmust keep pressing forward to achieve the\r\nDeclaration’s targets. I urge the General Assembly to\r\nadopt a resolution reaffirming the need for all nations\r\nto reach the goals outlined in the Declaration, starting\r\nwith the targets for the year 2003.\r\nFor our part, the United States will remain at the\r\nforefront of the worldwide effort to combat AIDS. As\r\nPresident Bush has said, in the face of preventable\r\ndeath and suffering, we have a moral duty to act, and\r\nwe are acting. The United State remains the largest\r\ndonor of bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance, providing\r\nalmost half of all international HIV/AIDS funding in\r\n2002. We have bilateral programmes in more than 75\r\ncountries. In January, President Bush announced his\r\n$15 billion five-year emergency plan for HIV/AIDS\r\nrelief. In May, it was signed into law with\r\noverwhelming congressional support. We are very\r\nproud of this plan, the largest single commitment of\r\nfunds in history for an international public health\r\ninitiative on a specific disease.\r\nThe President has asked Congress for over $2\r\nbillion in 2004, and under the plan we would steadily\r\nincrease our annual expenditures over the next four\r\nyears. The plan will continue our broad bilateral\r\nprogrammes, while focusing on 14 of the most affected\r\ncountries in Africa and the Caribbean. The plan will\r\ntreat 2 million people living with HIV/AIDS with\r\nantiretroviral drugs, and it will care for 10 million\r\nHIV-infected individuals and AIDS orphans. My\r\ncountry continues to be the largest donor to UNAIDS.\r\nWe will be issuing another grant for $100 million.\r\nWe are doing everything we can to support the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment. As the Declaration so\r\nstrongly underscores, Governments alone cannot begin\r\nto address the global AIDS crisis. We must make the\r\nprivate sector an integral part of our efforts. That is\r\nwhy President Bush deliberately made partnership with\r\nthe private sector a key element of our emergency plan\r\nfor AIDS relief.\r\nIn the worldwide fight against AIDS, every\r\nnation, large or small, developed or developing, must\r\nbe a leader and a partner. In the fight against AIDS, all\r\ncountries have a strong and committed ally in the\r\nUnited States of America. Together, we can help break\r\nthe vicious cycle of this devastating disease. May this\r\nhigh level plenary strengthen our resolve to fulfil the\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nDeclaration of Commitment we made two years ago.\r\nMay we work together to replace ignorance with\r\ninformation, shame with support and despair with\r\ndreams for a brighter future. All of God’s children\r\ndeserve to live in dignity and in safety, in health and in\r\nhope. By working in partnership against AIDS, we can\r\nensure that millions of children have their mothers, and\r\nnot just scrapbooks to remember them by.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Kamal Kharrazi, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\r\nMr. Kharrazi (Islamic Republic of Iran): The\r\nspread of HIV/AIDS has created a global epidemic far\r\nmore extensive than was predicted even a decade ago.\r\nIt has now become a major socioeconomic and\r\npsychological crisis, affecting all aspects of human life.\r\nThe rate of infection is increasing dramatically, and the\r\nprojection of its growth in Asia is much higher than in\r\nthe other continents.\r\nIn the Islamic Republic of Iran social traditions\r\nand religious beliefs have prevented HIV/AIDS from\r\ngrowing in a widespread manner. The cumulative\r\nfigure of 4,846 reported HIV/AIDS cases was reached\r\nby the end of 2002. The number of people living with\r\nHIV/AIDS by the end of 2002 was estimated at around\r\n20,000. Among the reported cases, drug use by\r\ninjection represents the most prevalent mode of\r\ntransmission.\r\nThe Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nhas taken several steps toward the implementation of\r\nthe Declaration of Commitment. The National\r\nHIV/AIDS Control Programme has been prepared and\r\na high-level commission consisting of a number of\r\nGovernment ministers and other Cabinet members\r\nmonitors the implementation of this Programme. In\r\naddition, there is a National HIV/AIDS Control\r\nCommittee, with the participation of all relevant\r\nstakeholders of the public and private sectors, as well\r\nas one person living with HIV. Similar structures exist\r\nat the provincial level under the responsibility of\r\ngovernors.\r\nCare and support services to infected persons,\r\nincluding medical outpatient treatment in “triangular”\r\nclinics and in-patient therapy and counselling, are\r\nprovided free of charge, mostly through Government\r\nsupport and subsidies. Furthermore, voluntary\r\ncounselling and testing facilities have been established\r\nin around 20 provinces and in 21 prisons with high\r\nprevalence.\r\nDespite all those efforts, the care and treatment of\r\nall persons in need require more financial and technical\r\nassistance.\r\nMr. Zanf (Islamic Republic of Iran), Vice\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nIt goes without saying that the care and treatment\r\nof the already infected, as well as prevention, are\r\nimperative and, therefore, should be vigorously\r\npursued. However, as stated in the Declaration of\r\nCommitment, the role of cultural, family, ethical and\r\nreligious factors and their significant role in the\r\nprevention of the epidemic and its treatment, care and\r\nsupport are of central importance to our collective\r\nefforts to fight HIV/AIDS. Therefore, the elements of\r\nmoral choice, responsible sexual behaviour and the\r\npromotion and protection of family values, as well as\r\ncombating pervasive poverty, need to be re-\r\nemphasized. Furthermore, we agree with the\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General on funding,\r\ncapacity-building and giving specific attention to\r\nwomen and girls.\r\nHowever, the issue of the affordability and access\r\nto safe and effective drugs in the international market\r\nis important, which the report has emphasized.\r\nIn conclusion, it is the continued responsibility of\r\nthe international community to advance\r\nimplementation of the Declaration by assisting\r\ndeveloping countries to fight HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Achmad Suyudi, Minister of Health and Social\r\nWelfare of Indonesia.\r\nMr. Suyudi (Indonesia): I would like, first of all,\r\nto congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President\r\nof this historic meeting. It attests to the esteem in\r\nwhich the international community holds you and your\r\ncountry.\r\nAs the challenges of HIV/AIDS continue to seize\r\nthe global community, the convening of this high-level\r\nplenary meeting and its interactive roundtable is\r\nundeniably pertinent. The forum provides us with an\r\nopportunity not only to reaffirm our commitments to\r\ncombat the epidemic, but also to exchange lessons\r\nlearned and best practices drawn from national\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nexperiences in implementing the 2001 Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS.\r\nWhile it is true that strong efforts are being made\r\nto combat the disease and restrict its spread, the grim\r\nreality presented by the ever-increasing statistics\r\nsuggests that the war is far from over. Current efforts to\r\ncombat the disease have also been hampered by the\r\ncontinuing gap between the availability of resources\r\nand the demand for effective and prompt\r\nimplementation of the AIDS commitments.\r\nEnhanced facilitation through the leadership of\r\nthe United Nations is crucial, especially for developing\r\ncountries, in areas of technical cooperation and\r\ncapacity-building programmes; the reduction of the\r\ndebt burden of poor countries, in order to boost the\r\nAIDS response in those countries; and the flexible\r\nimplementation of the World Trade Organization\r\nAgreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual\r\nProperty Rights (TRIPS), in order to enable the least\r\ndeveloped countries to provide cheap generic drugs to\r\ntheir AIDS victims.\r\nThe recent HIV situation in Indonesia is\r\nalarming, and the number of AIDS cases has increased\r\nten-fold in the past five years. The country has been\r\nable to treat just over 300 AIDS cases with\r\nantiretroviral drugs. We are committed to the goal\r\nadopted at the General Assembly special session of\r\nproviding all HIV-infected persons with access to\r\naffordable drugs, including antiretroviral treatment. It\r\nwill be a huge task for developing countries unless the\r\nright of access to affordable and cheap generic drugs is\r\nassured.\r\nWe thank the Assembly very much for the Global\r\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, set up\r\nin 2001. With its annual target of $10.5 billion, the\r\nFund is an exemplary initiative allowing developing\r\ncountries to implement their HIV prevention and care\r\nprogrammes. However, resource mobilization remains\r\ncritical. The quick outcome and release of funds at the\r\nthird-round of the Global Fund are crucial to sustaining\r\nthis momentum.\r\nMay I briefly share some information about\r\nfollow-up to the General Assembly special session in\r\nIndonesia? Indonesia has already submitted to the\r\nSecretary-General its 2003 progress report on special\r\nsession commitments. The principle achievements\r\nreported are the Combined Policy Index of 65 per cent\r\nas well as an overall Government expenditure of $3.25\r\nmillion in 2002 and $5.6 million in 2003. International\r\ndonors are providing an estimated $16.5 million in\r\n2003.\r\nA special cabinet meeting endorsed a range of\r\ntechnical strategies and guidelines consistent with the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment adopted at the special\r\nsession, giving priority to HIV/AIDS in annual\r\ndevelopment planning, mainstreaming HIV/AIDS into\r\nthe planning of all involved ministries and establishing\r\nstrong partnerships with civil society, which is viewed\r\nas a vital ally in this policy. Greater involvement of\r\npeople living with AIDS is consistent with Indonesia’s\r\nparticipation in the Paris Summit in 1994.\r\nWhile the new strategy clearly identifies\r\nprevention as the mainstay of Indonesia’s programme,\r\nit also stresses the urgent need to step up efforts to\r\nprovide treatment, care and support of those already\r\ninfected with the virus.\r\nIndonesia has coordinated a multipartner effort\r\nwith international and domestic organizations to meet\r\nthe special session targets. However, monitoring the\r\nimpact of AIDS and the programmes to confront it is\r\ncritical to sustaining successful programmes, to\r\ndemonstrating the value added of the increased\r\nresources being invested to fight AIDS and to\r\ncontinuing activities to raise funds. The United Nations\r\nmust play a key role, in the spirit of multilateralism,\r\nand use its unique position to help ensure that countries\r\nare able to programme resources in an efficient and\r\ntransparent manner, that objective monitoring and\r\nevaluation is undertaken, that data is collected and used\r\nin policy debate and that the results of this work are\r\nused to adjust programmes and mobilize further\r\nresources. Further support from the United Nations will\r\nbe needed to help with the efficient implementation of\r\nprogrammes.\r\nThe increasing number of partners and actors\r\nbecoming involved with AIDS at the country level is\r\nappropriate and welcome.\r\nIn conclusion, the General Assembly special\r\nsession process and Declaration of Commitment have\r\nhad a significant impact on leadership and policy\r\ndevelopment in Indonesia. The Declaration is indeed a\r\nblueprint for action.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Khurshid Kasuri, the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Pakistan.\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nMr. Kasuri (Pakistan): Two years ago, at the\r\ntwenty-sixth special session of the General Assembly,\r\nwe adopted the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS. Some of the Declaration’s time-bound\r\ncommitments were due to be met in 2003. It is\r\ntherefore appropriate to evaluate the level of their\r\nimplementation. The statistics, unfortunately, present a\r\ngrim picture. About 10 million people have been\r\ninfected with the HIV/AIDS virus in the past two\r\nyears. Another 6 million have died due to the\r\npandemic. Since its outbreak in 1980s, more than 26\r\nmillion people have perished, and many more are on\r\nthe verge of extinction.\r\nAround 90 per cent of AIDS victims live in\r\ndeveloping countries, with its prevalence aggravated by\r\nhunger, disease, illiteracy and underdevelopment.\r\nAIDS has not only brought development in affected\r\ncountries to a grinding halt but has in fact reversed the\r\nachievements of several decades. Combating\r\nHIV/AIDS and eradicating poverty must therefore go\r\nhand in hand. This needs the active and determined\r\ncooperation of the international community,\r\nparticularly of the developed countries, to create an\r\nenabling international economic environment through\r\nenhanced debt relief, market access and official\r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nThe establishment of the Global Fund to Fight\r\nAids, Tuberculosis and Malaria was indeed a global\r\nresponse to a global crisis. As a partnership between\r\nGovernments, civil society, the private sector and the\r\naffected communities, the Global Fund represents a\r\nnew approach to international health financing.\r\nPakistan is privileged to be on the Board of Governors\r\nof the Fund.\r\nAgainst a projected requirement of $7 billion by\r\n2007, the international donors have pledged $4.7\r\nbillion. However, the amount actually received so far\r\nhas not exceeded $1.5 billion. Unless sustained with\r\nthe requisite resources, the Fund will fail to meet its\r\nobjectives. We urge the donor community to allocate\r\nadditional resources for the Fund.\r\nHaving played havoc in Africa, Latin America\r\nand East Asia, HIV/AIDS is threatening our region,\r\nSouth Asia, with equally devastating effect.\r\nFortunately, the situation in Pakistan is not alarming.\r\nWhile the numbers of reported and estimated cases in\r\nPakistan are still relatively low, patterns of behaviour\r\nthat may contribute to an epidemic spread of the\r\ninfection are pervasive. There is therefore no room for\r\ncomplacency.\r\nConscious of that, the Government of Pakistan\r\nhas taken several steps to translate the commitments\r\nmade at the special session into action. The\r\nGovernment of Pakistan is currently providing 75 per\r\ncent of the total resources allocated for HIV/AIDS\r\nprevention in Pakistan. Our main emphasis is on\r\nincreasing mass awareness, reducing discrimination\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS victims and providing free AIDS\r\nscreening kits and voluntary counselling services. Civil\r\nsociety is supporting the Government’s efforts and\r\nseveral national and international non-governmental\r\norganizations are fully involved in this campaign. We\r\nencourage their increased involvement.\r\nThe national AIDS control programme has been\r\nintegrated into the social action programme projects\r\nwith a budget of around 900 million rupees. The\r\nenhanced HIV/AIDS prevention programme, being\r\nimplemented at a cost of about 3.6 billion rupees, is\r\naimed at controlling HIV/AIDS in vulnerable\r\npopulations and the general public. Currently, the\r\nMinistry of Health is in the process of developing an\r\nenhanced HIV/AIDS Control Programme for 2002-\r\n2007, with assistance of the World Bank, at a cost of\r\n2.2 billion rupees. The salient features of the\r\nprogramme are as follows.\r\nFirst is the development of the national guidelines\r\nfor treatment of HIV/AIDS, including treatment with\r\nantiretroviral drugs, along with a training manual on\r\nthe treatment modalities and regimens.\r\nSecond is the promulgation in October 2002 of\r\nthe blood transfusion ordinance, which requires\r\nmandatory screening of all transfused blood and\r\nregistration of blood banks in the country to prevent\r\ntransmission of HIV through blood transfusion and\r\nblood products.\r\nThird is the delivery of a defined package of\r\nservices to vulnerable groups. Service delivery\r\nincludes primary health care; ensuring access to\r\nadequate information and education; prevention and\r\ntreatment of sexually transmitted infections; skill\r\ndevelopment; and the provision of voluntary\r\ncounselling and testing facilities.\r\nFourth are research activities such as the mapping\r\nand social assessment of vulnerable groups; impact\r\nassessment and external review studies; the assessment\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nof blood transfusion services; and human resource\r\ndevelopment in areas related to HIV/AIDS, such as\r\nclinical management, counselling, health, education,\r\ncommunication and universal laboratory precautions.\r\nWe are aware of the need to take adequate\r\npreventive steps in order to prevent the epidemic from\r\nspreading and devastating people’s lives. We have put\r\nthe building blocks of a strong prevention programme\r\nin place. We are ready to accelerate and expand our\r\nefforts in concert with the international community to\r\ncope with the scourge of HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to Her\r\nExcellency Ms. Libertina Amathila, Minister of Health\r\nand Social Services of the Republic of Namibia.\r\nMs. Amathila (Namibia): Two years ago, the\r\nAssembly adopted the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS (resolution S-26/2, annex). Today, Namibia\r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s progress report on\r\nthe implementation of that Declaration (A/58/184). The\r\nreport indicates how Member States are responding to\r\nthe challenges posed by the HIV/AIDS pandemic; it\r\nalso highlights areas that require increased attention.\r\nThe Government of Namibia provides leadership\r\nin HIV/AIDS prevention and control. Ever since the\r\nlaunching of the second medium-term plan on\r\nHIV/AIDS in 1999, the President of Namibia and\r\ncabinet ministers continue to be at the forefront in the\r\nfight against this epidemic. In June this year, the Prime\r\nMinister convened a special meeting of cabinet\r\nministers on HIV/AIDS to evaluate the status of our\r\nnational response and to map out new strategies. In\r\nJuly this year, the Prime Minister launched the\r\nNamibia Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS, which\r\nfurther strengthens the response of the private sector.\r\nPrevention remains the mainstay of our expanded\r\nnational response. We have set specific targets under\r\nthe Second National Development Plan and under\r\nNamibia Vision 2030. We have established\r\nprogrammes for the general public, in particular for\r\nwomen and youth. We have also established workplace\r\nprogrammes in many sectors. Information on\r\npreventive measures is made available in all local\r\nlanguages. As a result, we are beginning to see\r\nstabilization and even reduction in the HIV infection\r\nrate, especially among youth. Last year, we established\r\na programme for the prevention of mother-to-child\r\ntransmission. That programme also provides for free\r\ntreatment of both parents, thereby preventing early\r\norphanhood.\r\nNamibia subscribes to the principle that care,\r\nsupport and treatment are fundamental elements of an\r\neffective response. The Government of Namibia has\r\ncommitted itself to providing quality comprehensive\r\ntreatment and care to its citizens. That includes the use\r\nof antiretroviral medicines. In May this year, I\r\nlaunched the National Guidelines for Antiretroviral\r\nTherapy. Since then, my Ministry has trained medical\r\npractitioners from both the public and private sectors\r\non the use of those guidelines. The Government fully\r\ncovers the cost of antiretroviral medicines for members\r\nof the Public Service Employees Medical Aid Scheme\r\nand for their dependents. Some private companies fully\r\nor partially cover the cost of antiretroviral therapy.\r\nFaith-based institutions have also taken concrete steps;\r\nrecently, one church hospital started antiretroviral\r\ntherapy.\r\nThe Constitution of the Republic of Namibia\r\nincludes a Bill of fundamental Rights. People living\r\nwith AIDS enjoy the same protection provided by the\r\nConstitution. In addition, the Government has enacted\r\na law — the National Code on HIV/AIDS and\r\nEmployment — which prohibits discrimination on the\r\nbasis of an individual’s HIV status.\r\nThe laws of the country provide for assistance to\r\norphans and other vulnerable children, who are assisted\r\nfinancially as well as with education. Additional\r\nmeasures have also been taken, including the\r\nestablishment of a special fund for orphans and other\r\nvulnerable children.\r\nThe facts about HIV/AIDS are known. The tools\r\nto arrest the further spread of infection are available,\r\nbut the resources to do so are inadequate. The\r\nchallenges of HIV/AIDS can be met with the provision\r\nof new, additional and sustained resources. We\r\ntherefore applaud the establishment of the Global Fund\r\nto Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. We also\r\nwelcome the initiative by President Bush to help fight\r\nHIV/AIDS in Africa, and we appreciate the\r\ncontribution by our development partners.\r\nIn conclusion, the Government of Namibia\r\nremains firmly committed to the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS. We shall ensure that the recommendations\r\ncontained in the Secretary-General’s report are taken\r\non board in our third medium-term plan, which is\r\ncurrently being formulated.\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Manuel Dayrit, Minister of Health of\r\nthe Philippines.\r\nMr. Dayrit (Philippines): I am honoured to\r\naddress this meeting of Member States of the United\r\nNations as we strengthen our resolve to take action\r\nagainst the scourge of HIV/AIDS.\r\nFortunately, the Philippines has so far succeeded\r\nin keeping the country’s HIV prevalence low. At\r\npresent, there are an estimated 10,000 cases of AIDS in\r\nthe country, and every year about 100 cases are\r\nreported in the AIDS registry. Yearly surveillance\r\nactivities have constantly shown a prevalence rate\r\namong our commercial sex workers of 1 per cent or\r\nbelow.\r\nEarly recognition, in 1987, of the threat of HIV\r\ninfection galvanized an early response. An enlightened\r\nnational law on AIDS prevention and control was\r\nadopted in 1998. However, to this day, risks remain\r\nhigh owing to a significant number of people engaged\r\nin commercial sex and practising high-risk sexual\r\nbehaviour.\r\nThe Philippine National AIDS Council provides\r\nthe framework for a nationwide education and\r\ninformation strategy through schools, health centres\r\nand the workplace. For our migrant worker\r\npopulation — a group known to practice high-risk\r\nbehaviour — we have been conducting pre-departure\r\norientation seminars to inform its members of the\r\nhazards of HIV/AIDS.\r\nTo date, the Philippine Government’s policy on\r\nHIV/AIDS prevention and control has proved to be\r\neffective. The Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control\r\nAct of 1998 provides a legal framework for the\r\nnational response to HIV/AIDS that is consistent with\r\ninternational best practice. The real challenge is to\r\nmake that policy continue to work effectively in the\r\nface of growing challenges.\r\nWe are also cooperating with other Governments\r\nin our region with regard to migrant populations by\r\naddressing the various stages of the migration\r\nprocess — from origin to transit, destination and\r\nreturn. In that regard, together with our partners in the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), we\r\nadopted the Seventh ASEAN Summit Declaration on\r\nHIV/AIDS in 2001. We are also fully committed to the\r\nASEAN five-year work plan on HIV/AIDS for mobile\r\npopulations, including overseas Filipino workers,\r\nseafarers, truck drivers, migrant workers and\r\nintravenous drug users.\r\nWe are acutely aware that our country’s low\r\nprevalence situation must spur us to strive for even\r\nmore effective preventive efforts, as well as to care for\r\nthose already infected. We affirm our commitment to,\r\nand express our solidarity with, all countries in\r\nstrengthening the political resolve to combat\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nWe join the call to mobilize Government and\r\nprivate-sector resources to respond to the needs of the\r\nmillions who suffer from HIV/AIDS, 95 per cent of\r\nwhom live below the poverty line. While there has\r\nalready been a substantial increase in the resources to\r\nfight the diseases, more is needed if we are to succeed\r\nin halting the spread of infection.\r\nWe commend the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria for its work in supporting\r\nHIV/AIDS control efforts in many countries.\r\nWe join the call for all States to strengthen their\r\ncapacity to combat the disease, safeguard their\r\nrespective populations and care for the affected.\r\nCapacity-building is crucial at all stages of national\r\nAIDS programmes: planning, development,\r\nimplementation, monitoring and evaluation.\r\nThe time has come for all of us to intensify the\r\nglobal will to fulfil the commitments made at the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS\r\nin June 2001 by taking the required measures and\r\ncommitting the necessary resources to enhance the\r\nglobal struggle against the pandemic.\r\nThe world looks towards us with great\r\nexpectations — particularly the nations in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica, which have been gravely affected by\r\nHIV/AIDS, and those in Asia, where the epidemic is\r\npoised to wreak even greater havoc if aggressive\r\npreventive measures are not undertaken.\r\nBy strengthening political support, mobilizing\r\nresources in our respective countries and working in\r\npartnership with international organizations, civil\r\nsociety and the private sector, we should eventually\r\ndefeat this deadly scourge.\r\nThe Acting President: I now have the pleasure\r\nof calling on a former President of the General\r\nAssembly, His Excellency The Honourable Samuel\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nRudolf Insanally, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nGuyana.\r\nMr. Insanally (Guyana): The countries of the\r\nCaribbean, including Guyana, are pleased and proud to\r\nsee a native son of Saint Lucia presiding over the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session and,\r\nparticularly, over this high-level meeting on\r\nHIV/AIDS. We offer the President our warmest\r\ncongratulations and good wishes. As has been noted,\r\nour region has recorded a rate of HIV/AIDS infection\r\nsecond only to Africa. Such is the magnitude of the\r\npandemic that we stand to lose a high percentage of our\r\nyouth and, consequently, of the human resources\r\nneeded for our future growth and development.\r\nIt is of some comfort to note that since the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly in June 2001, several\r\nsignificant additions have been made to the world’s\r\narsenal of tools and resources to fight against the\r\npandemic. We especially welcome the establishment of\r\nthe Global Fund, which, it is hoped, will make it\r\npossible for developing countries like ours to mount a\r\nmore effective campaign against HIV/AIDS. We are\r\ndisappointed, however, that the Fund has not yet been\r\nable to reach its financial targets and that many\r\ncountries that have been approved for funding have yet\r\nto receive disbursements.\r\nWe also note with satisfaction the Bush\r\nemergency plan for AIDS relief, which has been\r\nintroduced by the United States and will make\r\navailable $15 billion to fight against HIV/AIDS,\r\nincluding a major effort in the prevention of the\r\nmother-to-child transmission of the disease. Guyana\r\ncounts itself fortunate to have been identified as one of\r\nthe 14 priority countries for that initiative.\r\nAmong the daunting challenges that developing\r\ncountries like Guyana face are overwhelming poverty,\r\nsuffocating debt burdens and debt-servicing\r\nobligations. The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\r\nInitiative and poverty reduction strategy programmes\r\nhave gone some way towards providing relief. Yet the\r\nrelief processes need to be accelerated and made less\r\nrestrictive, so as to allow countries like Guyana to\r\ninvest in poverty-reduction programmes and build\r\nsocial services. These macro-development issues are at\r\nthe very heart of our ability to provide effective\r\nresponses to the HIV/AIDS crisis.\r\nWe have also been encouraged by the significant\r\nreduction in the cost of antiretroviral drugs and by the\r\nacceptance of the usefulness of generic drugs in the\r\nfight against HIV/AIDS. We must remain steadfast in\r\nour commitment to ensure that every person living with\r\nHIV/AIDS, regardless of where that person lives, is\r\nable to access effective treatment and care. We must\r\nalso accelerate our efforts to make voluntary\r\ncounselling and testing available to every citizen who\r\nwishes to have them.\r\nWhile financial resources are critical, human\r\nresources also play an important role in the response to\r\nHIV/AIDS. Guyana is now facing a major constraint in\r\nretaining its highly-trained medical personnel,\r\nespecially qualified nurses. Several developed\r\ncountries continue to aggressively rob us of our\r\nmedical personnel, especially nurses, recruiting them\r\nby offering salaries and working conditions that are far\r\nbeyond our ability to match. This problem needs to be\r\nresolved through international cooperation so as to\r\nminimize the devastating impact of the migration of\r\nskills from developing countries. At the very least,\r\nfinancial programmes to assist us to expand our\r\ntraining programmes must be explored.\r\nThe world should not underestimate the\r\nmagnitude of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. One only has to\r\nread the daily death announcements in some of our\r\ncountries to realize that the victims being claimed by\r\nthe disease are mainly the young — men, women and\r\nchildren who have been robbed of the opportunities\r\nthat life may have had to offer them. Unfortunately,\r\nbecause of the stigma that is attached to it, HIV/AIDS\r\nis very much a silent killer. Despite our best efforts,\r\nthere still appears to be a general reluctance to talk\r\nabout the disease and its consequences, as if silence\r\nwould rid us of the plague. This high-level meeting\r\nmust therefore mount a collective assault to break\r\ndown this barrier of silence so that this dreaded\r\nscourge can be fully understood and effectively\r\naddressed.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Mohamed Benaissa, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Morocco.\r\nMr. Benaissa (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nshould like at the outset to join previous speakers in\r\nwelcoming the convening of this very important high-\r\nlevel meeting on HIV/AIDS during the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nI would like to thank the Secretary-General for\r\nhis comprehensive and analytical report (A/58/184) on\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nthe progress achieved in the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, adopted\r\nduring the special session of the General Assembly in\r\nJune 2001.\r\nThe HIV epidemic is by far the deadliest disease\r\nand a major cause of mortality, particularly in the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic is\r\nparticularly felt in our African continent, where,\r\nunfortunately, the epidemic continues to spread despite\r\nthe tireless efforts of several sisterly African\r\nGovernments.\r\nAccording to the report of the Secretary-General,\r\nthere has been a delay in the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment and in the commitments\r\nundertaken. However, there have also been some\r\npositive indications, giving grounds for hope that the\r\nsituation can be reversed. We are encouraged by the\r\nefforts that have been made so far at the national,\r\nregional and international levels, which have yielded\r\nresults. International commitments have provided a\r\nglimmer of hope for controlling the virus.\r\nIn that context, we note that Morocco has\r\nfinalized a comprehensive strategy to combat AIDS,\r\nincluding a strategy for diagnosis and treatment, with\r\nthe participation of all those working in Government\r\nand civil society, using media campaigns aimed at\r\nyoung people and the most vulnerable sectors of\r\nsociety. At the same time, that strategy takes into\r\naccount the concerns contained in the June 2001\r\nDeclaration of Commitment.\r\nIt is my hope that before we gather here to assess\r\nthe situation at the end of 2005, concerted efforts will\r\nbe made by the international community, in particular\r\nby the donor countries and financial institutions.\r\nFinally, we hope that the Joint United Nations\r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS will take further measures to\r\nimplement the Declaration of Commitment.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Per Stig Møller, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Denmark.\r\nMr. Møller (Denmark): This year we have the\r\nopportunity to review the first of the time-bound\r\ntargets set out in the Declaration of Commitment of the\r\nspecial session on HIV/AIDS.\r\nI shall not dwell on how the impact of the\r\nepidemic is becoming increasingly alarming. The facts\r\nare all well known to the participants in this meeting,\r\nas are the challenges we are facing.\r\nAlong with goal 6 of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, the Declaration of Commitment\r\nserves as an important tool to strengthen and accelerate\r\nthe global fight against HIV/AIDS. The first set of\r\ntargets, the ones we are reviewing today, relate mainly\r\nto the creation of an enabling policy environment.\r\nLet me highlight a few of the many important\r\nfindings in the report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/58/184). First, with respect to the implementation of\r\nHIV/AIDS strategies and policies: in many countries,\r\nwe now have the right policies and institutional\r\nframeworks to fight HIV/AIDS. What we need is\r\nimplementation of the policies through broad-based,\r\neffective programmes. That will require political\r\nleadership. It will require a willingness to talk openly\r\nabout the epidemic and to make the fight against the\r\ndisease a political priority. Political leaders must stamp\r\nout all discrimination against and stigmatization of\r\ninfected people. Civil society must be involved, and\r\nincreased financial and human resources must be set\r\naside for the fight in each and every country.\r\nTo illustrate this point: most countries today have\r\nnational strategies for prevention, but very few people\r\nhave access to basic information and prevention\r\nservices. The report states that “the inability to deliver\r\nHIV prevention programmes on the scale required\r\nrepresents a critical missed opportunity” (A/58/184,\r\npara. 28). We must do more to provide sufficient\r\ncoverage in order to reduce the number of new\r\ninfections.\r\nSecondly, with respect to the role of women:\r\nwomen stand out as particularly vulnerable to the\r\nepidemic, not least in sub-Saharan Africa. Most\r\ncountries now have national policies to ensure equal\r\naccess to services, but plans and policies alone will not\r\nreduce the special risks women face. To fight\r\nHIV/AIDS, we need the true economic and social\r\nempowerment of women.\r\nThirdly, with respect to funding: as we broaden\r\nthe scope and add more interventions, the need for\r\nlong-term, stable funding becomes more urgent. This is\r\nmore important than ever now that care and treatment\r\nprogrammes are being scaled up. The donor community\r\nmust live up to this challenge through increased\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nfunding for HIV/AIDS activities. It is therefore\r\nencouraging to see the significant increase over the\r\npast year in resources for combating the pandemic. The\r\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria\r\nis an important new financial mechanism. Together\r\nwith partners in countries — Governments, civil\r\nsociety — the United Nations family and bilateral\r\ndonors, the Fund has the opportunity to make a real\r\ndifference. In our fight against HIV/AIDS, we need\r\ncommitted actors, closer cooperation, increased efforts\r\nand a balanced approach including prevention,\r\nawareness, enlightenment, care and treatment.\r\nDenmark has a long tradition as a substantial\r\ndonor and actor in development cooperation. We will\r\nlive up to that standing through increased funding for\r\nHIV/AIDS activities bilaterally, multilaterally and\r\nthrough national and international civil society\r\norganizations.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jón Kristjánsson, Minister for Health\r\nand Social Security of Iceland.\r\nMr. Kristjánsson (Iceland): Iceland welcomes\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on progress towards\r\nthe implementation of the Declaration of Commitment\r\non HIV/AIDS (A/58/184).\r\nIn Iceland, the fight against HIV/AIDS is\r\nintegrated into the fight against all sexually transmitted\r\ndiseases. During the last decade the incidence of HIV\r\nhas gradually been reduced among Icelanders. Contrary\r\nto the situation in most countries in the world, AIDS is\r\nrarely seen in our country nowadays as a result of\r\neffective treatment. At the same time, there has been an\r\nincrease in the proportion of HIV infection among\r\nimmigrants to Iceland. That shows clearly that no\r\ncountry is unaffected by the global burden of HIV\r\ninfection.\r\nGlobally, the HIV/AIDS epidemic is an enormous\r\nongoing burden to humanity. For the past two decades,\r\nthe epidemic has spread all across the world. The\r\nGovernments of all countries must speed up and\r\nstrengthen long-term plans designed to reduce the\r\nsocial and financial impact of the epidemic. They need\r\nto support all activities necessary to achieve the goals\r\nset out in the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS in the fight against the epidemic. They need\r\nto take steps to improve the position of social classes\r\nthat are disadvantaged and therefore at a greater risk of\r\ninfection. They need to ensure access to treatment and\r\ncare for all those who need it. They need to encourage\r\nthe development of drugs and vaccines against HIV\r\ninfection, and to ensure the availability of sufficient\r\nresources for the campaign against the AIDS epidemic.\r\nIceland will work towards the commitments set\r\nout in the Declaration of Commitment that are to be\r\nmet by the year 2005 and the year 2010. Iceland is at\r\npresent working to meet these goals through its\r\nInternational Development Agency, through its\r\nparticipation on the Executive Board of the World\r\nHealth Organization (WHO), and by supporting the\r\ninitiative of the Council of Baltic Sea States’ Task\r\nForce on Communicable Disease Control in the Baltic\r\nSea Region. Iceland has also committed itself to\r\ndonating 15 million Icelandic kronas to the Global\r\nFund on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.\r\nI believe that we can turn the tide by a combined\r\neffort of all nations in the battle against HIV/AIDS\r\nusing prevention, care and treatment for those already\r\ninfected.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jan Petersen, the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Norway.\r\nMr. Petersen (Norway): Combating HIV/AIDS\r\nrequires global leadership, partnership and action. No\r\nGovernment can deal with the challenges of the\r\npandemic on its own. We need an extraordinary\r\npartnership between political leaders, international\r\norganizations, national public health systems, civil\r\nsociety and the private sector.\r\nSignificantly reducing HIV/AIDS is a\r\nMillennium Development Goal. The Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS sets out specific and\r\nambitious, but still achievable aims. I welcome this\r\nopportunity to review achievements and reinforce\r\nefforts to reach the targets, with a sense of urgency\r\nincorporated in the timetable.\r\nPrevention, treatment and care are equally\r\nimportant to fight HIV/AIDS efficiently. Without well-\r\nfunctioning treatment and care, prevention will also\r\nfail. We must strengthen national health systems to\r\nmake them able to better develop and sustain\r\nprogrammes for treatment and care. Keeping infected\r\npeople alive and well is not only the right thing to do,\r\nbut also vital for a country’s social stability and long-\r\nterm economic future.\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nIn this context, I welcome the agreement that was\r\nreached by the World Trade Organization (WTO) to\r\nprovide developing countries with greater access to\r\ncheaper medicines, including HIV-related drugs.\r\nThis struggle requires us to apply distinct and\r\nmutually reinforcing approaches that reach out to men,\r\nwomen and children. We must promote male\r\nresponsibility in order to achieve real changes in sexual\r\nbehaviour. Norway is committed to the empowerment\r\nof women so that they can truly protect themselves.\r\nThis has been a key goal of Norwegian development\r\npolicy for many years.\r\nWe must encourage openness and dialogue\r\ntowards our children. In South Africa, the campaign\r\nmessage is “Love your children enough to talk about\r\nsex”. Moral leaders such as Nelson Mandela and\r\nDesmond Tutu are actively supporting the campaign.\r\nSuch efforts are important contributions to reducing the\r\nfurther spread of HIV/AIDS, as well as reducing the\r\nstigmatization of those who are infected.\r\nWe have learned from the humanitarian crisis in\r\nsouthern Africa, which was caused by a combination of\r\nfood shortages and HIV/AIDS, that emergency\r\nassistance and long-term assistance must be better\r\ncoordinated and combined. The Joint United Nations\r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the World\r\nHealth Organization (WHO) and the Global Fund to\r\nFight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria have\r\nimportant roles to play in assisting countries to address\r\nHIV/AIDS more effectively. We should look for ways\r\nto make multilateral efforts and other contributions\r\nfunction more effectively together.\r\nNorway is a firm supporter of United Nations\r\nefforts to halt the HIV/AIDS pandemic through\r\nUNAIDS and its co-sponsoring agencies. We have\r\ncontributed substantial funds to the Global Fund to\r\nFight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and other\r\ninternational initiatives. The fight against HIV/AIDS is\r\nan important element in our bilateral development\r\ncooperation programmes and our civil society\r\norganizations. In 2004, we plan to step up our support,\r\nincluding support through multilateral channels. We\r\nwill reward performance.\r\nI would like to conclude by paying tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General for his strong personal engagement\r\nand leadership in the fight against AIDS. He has made\r\nthis a priority issue for the whole United Nations\r\nsystem. His engagement should be an example to all of\r\nus. We can only win the fight against HIV/AIDS if we\r\nmake that fight a top priority and apply the necessary\r\nresources.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Arnold Rüütel, President of the\r\nRepublic of Estonia.\r\nMr. Rüütel (Estonia) (spoke in Estonian; English\r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): The\r\nresolution passed at the twenty-ninth General\r\nAssembly special session two years ago to annually\r\nreview the implementation of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS reflects the topicality of\r\nHIV/AIDS in today’s world. It also indicates the need\r\njointly to react to the changing situation that was\r\nanalysed in the Secretary-General’s progress report.\r\nToday we can state, on one hand, that a great deal\r\nof work has been done, and we can even talk about\r\nprogress made in the fight against HIV/AIDS. On the\r\nother hand, in many parts of the world the number of\r\ninfected people and victims is so high that the word\r\n“progress” is awkward to use in the overall context of\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nThe need to raise the political significance of the\r\nHIV/AIDS problem and to draft an aggressive strategy\r\nfor fighting the disease has been emphasized from the\r\nUnited Nations rostrum and in other international\r\nforums.\r\nI can assure you that during the period following\r\nthe General Assembly special session, awareness of the\r\nseverity of the problem has become more pronounced\r\nin our State, our region and the entire world. The\r\npeople of the world are increasingly aware that this is\r\nneither a problem concerning only the infected and\r\ntheir families, nor a problem concerning only single\r\nStates. This is a problem we must tackle together on a\r\nglobal scale.\r\nIn the fight against HIV/AIDS, prevention,\r\ntreatment, care and support are intertwined activities,\r\nall needed for comprehensive national strategies. In\r\nthis context, specifically, prevention plays a special\r\nrole.\r\nThe spread of HIV/AIDS is a serious problem for\r\nEstonia as well. In Estonia’s case, the specific\r\ncharacteristics are that it is a concentrated epidemic\r\nand that 70 per cent of those infected are young people\r\n15-to-24 years old. The first outbreak of the epidemic\r\nwas among intravenous drug users, but we have come\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nto the conclusion that it is being sexually transmitted\r\noutside the risk group as well. Therefore, we put\r\nspecial stress on our work with the young and on\r\nprevention campaigns. Through sex and health\r\neducation, we can disseminate diversified information\r\nabout the threat of HIV infection and its irreversible\r\nconsequences.\r\nIn Estonia, we have been dealing with HIV\r\nprevention for about 15 years. Presently, we are\r\nengaged in the National HIV/AIDS Prevention\r\nProgramme for 2002-2006, the third such campaign.\r\nApart from the Government sector, the non-profit and\r\nprivate sectors, as well as local authorities, should also\r\nbe involved in prevention. I would especially like to\r\nstress the role of schools and youth organizations.\r\nPrevention in institutions of detention is also\r\nimportant.\r\nEstonia is aware of the need to allocate more\r\nresources for the implementation of anti-AIDS\r\nprogrammes. In Estonia, an active network\r\nencompassing the whole country and consisting of\r\nspecialists from different levels has developed.\r\nNevertheless, tremendous efforts are still necessary for\r\nthe whole community to commit itself to the prevention\r\nof HIV infection.\r\nOne of the main risk groups in Estonia consists of\r\ndrug addicts. Therefore, I would like to stress that the\r\nfight against HIV/AIDS should go hand in hand with\r\ndrug prevention. This calls for even more aggressive\r\ninternational endeavours, especially against both drug\r\nand human trafficking.\r\nWe are very grateful for the assistance we have\r\nreceived from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria. This support helps to even\r\nfurther intensify international cooperation in the fight\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS and significantly increases the\r\nnumber of partners that we have to work with.\r\nEstonia would like to confirm, here in New York,\r\nits commitment to cooperating in the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS. As the presiding State of the Council of the\r\nBaltic Sea States (CBSS), Estonia is putting great\r\nstress on cooperative projects in this sphere. The CBSS\r\nprime ministers established in 2000 a special Task\r\nForce on Communicable Disease Control to address the\r\nproblem in that region. The Task Force is focusing\r\nespecially on cooperative efforts to prevent HIV/AIDS.\r\nI would also like to emphasize that Estonia shares\r\nthe goals set by the European Union and is increasingly\r\ninvolved in various corresponding programmes. We\r\nalso recognize the serious commitment that the World\r\nBank has made to combating HIV/AIDS.\r\nDespite the seriousness of the situation regarding\r\none of the Millennium Goals, I would like to conclude\r\non an optimistic note. I hope that, next year, we will be\r\nable to talk about the progress that has been made in\r\nincreasing both our efforts and the results of these\r\nendeavours.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nguyen Dy Nien, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Viet Nam.\r\nMr. Dy Nien (Viet Nam): The Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS, adopted by the General\r\nAssembly two years ago, is a crucial document\r\nreflecting the political commitment of world leaders in\r\nthe global struggle against this pandemic. The\r\nDeclaration established, for the first time ever, time-\r\nbound targets to which individual Governments and the\r\ninternational community may be held accountable. It\r\ncreates a key framework for cooperation at the regional\r\nand global levels to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goal of halting HIV/AIDS by 2015 and\r\nof beginning to reverse it in the following years.\r\nIn this light, our high-level meeting today is an\r\nimportant one. I wish to take the liberty of briefing the\r\nAssembly about what my Government has done\r\ntowards that end.\r\nSince the emergence of the HIV/AIDS epidemic\r\nin Viet Nam in 1990, the Government has given due\r\nattention and taken strong action to prevent it. The\r\nnational programme on AIDS prevention was launched\r\nin the early 1990s under the guidance of a deputy\r\nprime minister. Ordinances on HIV/AIDS prevention\r\nand other important documents and instructions have\r\nbeen enacted, creating a legal framework for various\r\nactivities in this regard. A technical group on\r\nHIV/AIDS has been set up to coordinate activities\r\namong donors and Governments. At the same time,\r\nconstant efforts have been made to promote public\r\nawareness of HIV/AIDS infection and preventive\r\nmeasures, to gradually improve care and treatment\r\nservices for the victims, and to maximize the\r\ninvolvement of the community and their families.\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nHIV/AIDS does not need a visa to travel. Its\r\nprevention depends on full cooperation among nations.\r\nViet Nam has therefore worked closely with other\r\ncountries within the regional and international\r\nframeworks. Our country report on the implementation\r\nof the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS was\r\nsubmitted to the Joint United Nations Programme on\r\nAIDS (UNAIDS). As HIV/AIDS brings colossal\r\nburdens in terms of finances and health care to bear\r\nupon the poor countries, Viet Nam calls on the\r\ndeveloped countries to fulfil their commitments to\r\ncontributing to the budget of the Global Fund to Fight\r\nHIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. In the same\r\nvein, big pharmaceutical corporations that hold\r\nintellectual property rights to HIV/AIDS medicines\r\nshould adopt a policy on price reduction for poor\r\ncountries and lease the patents to them so that they may\r\nproduce medicines for their own patients.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of\r\nmy Government, to register our thanks to UNAIDS, the\r\nUnited Nations and other countries for the support and\r\nassistance they have extended to Viet Nam over the\r\npast years. Viet Nam looks forward to receiving\r\ncontinued cooperation in the future.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHer Excellency Dro Manto Tshabalala-Msimang,\r\nMember of Parliament and Minister of Health of South\r\nAfrica.\r\nMs. Tshabalala-Msimang (South Africa): I am\r\nproud to report that, in South Africa, we have turned\r\nthe corner. We know that the levels of HIV and AIDS\r\nawareness have increased significantly, to higher than\r\n95 per cent. We also know that this has resulted in\r\nbehaviour change, because about 70 per cent of young\r\nwomen aged 15 to 19 years are reported to have no\r\nsexual partners in 2002, compared to 59 per cent in\r\n1998.\r\nThe nutritional status of an individual is known to\r\nplay an important role in decelerating the progression\r\nof HIV to AIDS, improving the quality of life and\r\ndecreasing the prevalence and severity of the infectious\r\ncomplication of HIV and AIDS.\r\nWe have established at our Medical Research\r\nCouncil an Indigenous Knowledge Systems Unit to\r\nassess the efficacy and safety of traditional medicines.\r\nOn 31 August 2003, we celebrated Africa Traditional\r\nMedicine Day and opened a World Health Organization\r\nCollaborating Centre on Traditional Medicines.\r\nThe policy and institutional framework are in\r\nplace. Our country’s response to the spread of HIV and\r\nthe impact of AIDS is guided by our national strategic\r\nplan. We also have a constitutional dispensation that is\r\nbased on equality before the law and therefore equity\r\nof access to all basic services is guaranteed.\r\nIn May 2002, 110 companies, which employ over\r\n500,000 employees, were sampled. It was found that 54\r\nper cent had formal HIV and AIDS policies. The\r\naverage for companies with more than 500 employees\r\nwas 84 per cent. A study of 77 medical schemes with\r\nalmost 6 million beneficiaries showed that 78 per cent\r\nhad an HIV and AIDS disease-management\r\nprogramme, but that only 0.3 per cent of beneficiaries\r\nmake use of it. This clearly illustrates the serious\r\nnature of stigmatization and discrimination in\r\ninfluencing health-seeking behaviour amongst those\r\nwho are infected and affected by HIV infection and\r\nAIDS.\r\nWe are investing in the health care infrastructure.\r\nSouth Africa ranks seventh on the list of 22 high-\r\ntuberculosis-burden countries in the world. Being a\r\ncountry in transition, we also have to address diseases\r\nboth of poverty and affluence. This calls for a major\r\ninvestment in the total health care infrastructure to\r\naddress the major natural and unnatural causes of\r\ndeath, including HIV and AIDS.\r\nIn November 2002, the Diflucan partnership with\r\nPfizer, which provides free medication for the\r\ntreatment of two AIDS-related conditions, was\r\nextended to include the whole Southern Africa\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) region. This is a\r\ngood illustration of a public/private partnership\r\ninitiative with the pharmaceutical industry.\r\nWe also provide triple therapy to survivors of\r\nsexual assault as part of a comprehensive package of\r\nsupport. The post-exposure prophylaxis programme\r\nincludes counselling on the effectiveness and risks of\r\nusing antiretroviral drugs for this purpose. We are\r\ncurrently investigating the cost and social implications\r\nof providing antiretroviral therapy in the public sector\r\nand the investment needed, over and above the existing\r\npublic health care infrastructure.\r\nAs I speak, we have 31,000 vacant nursing posts\r\nand 3,500 vacant doctors posts in the public service.\r\nThese posts are funded. We train enough doctors and\r\nnurses, but developed countries continuously poach our\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nvaluable health workers. This practice weakens health\r\ncare systems in developing countries.\r\nApproximately 90 per cent of pregnant women in\r\nSouth Africa attend antenatal clinics. Of these women,\r\nmore than two thirds have access to the programme for\r\nthe prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Our\r\nbiggest challenge is following up the baby-mother pairs\r\nin order to measure the impact of this intervention.\r\nWe have invested more than R20 million in the\r\nSouth African AIDS Vaccine Initiative.\r\nWe have political leadership. President Thabo\r\nMbeki demonstrated his leadership by establishing the\r\nfirst multisectoral partnership against AIDS in 1999,\r\nnow called the South African AIDS Council, chaired\r\nby the Deputy President. This forum includes, amongst\r\nother things, the business sector, labour unions, people\r\nliving with AIDS, traditional leaders and healers, faith-\r\nbased organizations, the Men’s Forum Against AIDS\r\nand SADC Women Unite in Partnership Against AIDS.\r\nIn health care alone, we spend approximately R6\r\nbillion annually on HIV and AIDS out of a budget of\r\nR40 billion, which amounts to 15 per cent of the annual\r\nnational health budget. We have budgeted from our\r\nown resources a further R3.3 billion for HIV and AIDS\r\nin order to ensure that we can address issues of home-\r\nbased care, voluntary counselling and other\r\nprogrammes.\r\nOur Cabinet is keeping its political commitment\r\nto allocating the necessary resources to fight HIV and\r\nAIDS. The SADC heads of State and Government\r\nrecently adopted the Maseru Declaration. The African\r\nUnion Summit, which was held in Maputo in July this\r\nyear, further committed itself to implementing the\r\nAbuja Declaration and the Millennium Development\r\nGoals.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation is satisfied that we\r\nhave put in place a coherent policy and institutional\r\nframework to make a discernible impact in the fight\r\nagainst HIV and AIDS. We must all consolidate\r\ninvestment in the health-care infrastructure. We must\r\nsustain political commitment and leadership at the\r\nnational, regional and global levels. We must avoid the\r\npractice of some international collaborating partners of\r\nparachuting programmes into developing countries\r\nwithout due consideration of the country’s national\r\nstrategic plans. We must work out a mutually\r\nacceptable arrangement and code of practice to regulate\r\nthe exchange of health personnel between developed\r\nand developing countries, because we cannot afford the\r\ndeliberate brain drain of our health personnel.\r\nWe look forward to coming back in 2005 to report\r\nto the United Nations on the programme of\r\nimplementation of the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Dr. Alvaro Vidal Rivadeneyra, Minister of\r\nHealth of Peru, who will speak on behalf of the Rio\r\nGroup.\r\nMr. Vidal Rivadeneyra (Peru) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): It is a great honour for me to speak on behalf\r\nof the members of the Rio Group on a matter of such\r\nimportance to all humanity.\r\nThe Declaration of Commitment on the subject\r\nunder consideration, adopted by the General Assembly\r\nin June 2001, was a momentous event in the struggle\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS. In Latin America, the impact of this\r\npandemic does not have the same consequences as it\r\ndoes in other parts of the world. In our region, this\r\nproblem has been concentrated in populations of\r\ngreater vulnerability and risk, posing the challenge and\r\ncreating the responsibility for making significant\r\nprogress in the search for a response appropriate to the\r\ndynamic of the epidemic and to the ecologic, social,\r\ncultural and economic factors that may contribute to\r\nspreading it.\r\nWe, the members of the Rio Group, are aware that\r\nwe are living at a difficult time, when the health and\r\nwell-being of humanity are being threatened by various\r\nfactors, which, combined with poverty indexes,\r\ngenerate a double rate of disease, disabilities and early\r\ndeath in a great number of people. It is for that reason\r\nthat, while meeting recently in Cuzco, we recognized\r\nthat threats to public health such as HIV/AIDS also\r\nconstitute a threat to the security of our peoples. The\r\nimpact of the virus is actually stronger in societies that\r\nface economic and social problems that hinder them\r\nfrom reaching sustainable levels of development,\r\nwhich expands the current economic gap that exists\r\nworldwide and within each of our societies.\r\nWe have therefore endeavoured to join our efforts\r\nto meet the commitments we entered into two years\r\nago. Those efforts can be discerned from a political\r\nframework to reduce the inequalities that variously\r\naffect the health of our peoples. That includes creating\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nprogrammes to address the problem at its different\r\nstages, namely, prevention, care, support and treatment.\r\nNevertheless, effort and political will are sometimes\r\nnot enough; more resources and additional training of\r\nqualified medical personnel are also required.\r\nIn that regard, we would like to emphasize the\r\nimportance of the establishment of the Global Fund to\r\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Fund has\r\ncontributed to the implementation of programmes and\r\nto the expansion of infrastructure to relieve pain, save\r\nlives and contribute to the fight against such diseases.\r\nIt is also necessary to find new sources of financing,\r\nwhich will help to strengthen national responses to the\r\nepidemic and make it possible for our Governments to\r\ndraft new policies in collaboration with civil society\r\nand community-based organizations for people living\r\nwith HIV/AIDS.\r\nWe must also mention the fact that efforts have\r\nbeen made at the regional level to attain a reduction in\r\nthe price of medicines in order to improve the quality\r\nof life of, and increase access to medication for, people\r\nliving with HIV/AIDS. To that end, the countries of the\r\nregion have pooled their efforts this year to find the\r\nlowest prices for antiretroviral medicines and other\r\nhealth supplies. As a result of agreements between our\r\nGovernments and pharmaceutical companies\r\ncommitted to the welfare of people, those efforts have\r\nhad positive results.\r\nOn behalf of the member countries of the Rio\r\nGroup, I would like, in this Hall, to renew the\r\ncommitment we undertook during the special session\r\nof the General Assembly that took place in June 2001.\r\nIn so doing, we reaffirm our ethical commitment to,\r\nand responsibility for, people living with HIV/AIDS in\r\norder that they may have full and safe access to the\r\ncomprehensive medical attention they need, including\r\nadequate health services and social and emotional\r\nsupport. We must work together to continue creating\r\nmechanisms to promote people’s universal access to\r\nprevention information through sex education in\r\nschools and information drives aimed at spreading the\r\nfacts about the risks of this disease in order to create\r\nawareness among the population.\r\nIn that regard, we have been working assiduously\r\nto establish the Horizontal Technical Cooperation\r\nGroup on HIV/AIDS in Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean in order to promote the exchange of\r\ninformation and, given the need to expand the scope of\r\nthe work being done in this area, strengthen local\r\ncapacity to develop basic clinical research while\r\npromoting the production of new medicines.\r\nWe will continue to work under the premise that\r\nwe must address this problem while taking vulnerable\r\ngroups into account, including gay men and other men\r\nwho have sex with men, sexual workers, drug users —\r\nparticularly intravenous drug users — orphaned\r\nchildren and migrant populations.\r\nIn closing, I would like to underscore the fact that\r\nthe work in the fight against the pandemic has not yet\r\ncome to an end. With the support of the international\r\ncommunity, we will continue to unite our efforts to\r\nachieve the eradication of a disease that affects each\r\nand every one of us in one way or another.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mustafa Osman Ismail, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Sudan.\r\nMr. Ismail (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It gives me\r\npleasure at the outset, to congratulate the President on\r\nhis election to the presidency of the fifty-eighth session\r\nof the General Assembly. We are confident that his\r\nlong experience and high professional capabilities will\r\nlead to the success of this session. I wish to assure him\r\nof the support of my country in his endeavours to\r\nachieve the desired results of our work.\r\nThe special session of the General Assembly\r\ndevoted to the issue of HIV/AIDS, which was held in\r\nJune 2001 and which focused on all vulnerable groups\r\nand sectors, took place thanks to tireless efforts and a\r\npraiseworthy initiative to draw attention to the scourge\r\nof the century. In that regard, I would like to thank\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his commendable\r\npersonal efforts. He has worked to raise the profile of\r\nthe problem of AIDS and deserves our thanks for\r\nhaving worked to establish the Global Fund to Fight\r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. In the brief period\r\nsince it was set up, the effects of the Fund have already\r\nbeen measurable. We hope there will be equal access\r\nby all affected countries to the Fund. I would like to\r\ntake this opportunity to invite donors, and the Group of\r\n8 in particular, to increase their contributions to the\r\nFund.\r\nSince the diagnosis of Sudan’s first case in 1986,\r\nthe number of declared AIDS cases in our country has\r\ngrown continuously. That increase is the result of a\r\nnumber of common factors found in most sub-Saharan\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nAfrica, including the prevalence of malnutrition,\r\npoverty and the lack of institutional capacity to\r\nconfront the disease.\r\nGiven the lack of time, I would like to briefly list\r\nthe main elements of our 2003-2007 national plan to\r\ncombat and control AIDS.\r\nThe first element of the plan is to raise awareness\r\nof AIDS, which entails disseminating information\r\nabout the disease and how it is transmitted and\r\nprevented. In particular, that information must be\r\ncirculated among the most vulnerable groups. The\r\nsecond element is to disseminate the values and the\r\nprinciples of good conduct inspired by all religions to\r\ncombat the disease directly and indirectly. The third\r\nelement is to create groups to combat and prevent the\r\ndisease throughout Sudan’s provinces.\r\nMr. Alexandre (Haiti), Vice President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe resources required to implement our plan are\r\nestimated to be $196 million. Foreign assistance and\r\nquick-impact programmes will be required from\r\ninternational organizations and funds in order to\r\nimplement the plan.\r\nAIDS is a serious threat to entire generations\r\nthroughout the world, particularly Africa. It is a new\r\nobstacle to development with a devastating economic\r\nand social impact that impedes the success of national\r\nand international development efforts. Therefore, it is\r\nimportant to coordinate our efforts and to act seriously\r\nin order to confront one of the worst scourges to have\r\never afflicted mankind.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Maria de Fátima Lima Veiga, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, Cooperation and Communities of the Republic\r\nof Cape Verde.\r\nMrs. Veiga (Cape Verde) (spoke in French): The\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the progress made in\r\nimplementing the measures set out in the Declaration\r\nof Commitments on HIV/AIDS, adopted at the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS in June\r\n2001, allows us to draw the following conclusions.\r\nWhile we can note with satisfaction the progress\r\nregarding raising awareness in affected countries about\r\nthe need for national strategies to combat AIDS up to\r\n2003 — a goal that we feel has been partially\r\nattained — it remains preoccupying to see that the\r\nresults we expected from this first phase of the\r\nimplementation of the Declaration will not be fully\r\nachieved, among other things, because of the lack of\r\nresources. There is a trend toward the spread of the\r\nepidemic at the planetary level. We must attack the\r\ncauses for this delay. Otherwise, we will frustrate the\r\nnational and international efforts aimed at eliminating\r\nand curbing the HIV/AIDS scourge.\r\nIn Cape Verde, HIV/AIDS indicators show that an\r\nincrease in the number of persons who have been\r\ninfected and affected despite the efforts made by the\r\nGovernment. The 15- to 55-year-old age group — the\r\nmost active sector of the population — has been struck\r\nmost intensely. We started fighting AIDS in the 1980s\r\nin Cape Verde, after the first case appeared in 1986. In\r\nFebruary 2002, we adopted a national strategic plan to\r\nfight AIDS for the period from 2002 to 2006. That plan\r\nwas drafted in collaboration with the Government,\r\nmunicipalities, the United Nations, non-governmental\r\norganizations and grassroots organizations. A reference\r\naction plan was also adopted.\r\nThe Cape Verde Government is resolutely\r\ncommitted to combating this terrible epidemic, which\r\nhas affected the entire planet, particularly Africa. It has\r\nestablished a committee to fight AIDS, which is a\r\nmultisectoral institution chaired by the Prime Minister\r\nhimself. The committee is composed of representatives\r\nof Government departments, civil society, the media,\r\nreligious institutions and the private sector.\r\nCombating AIDS is primarily a moral imperative\r\nand a crucial challenge for world peace and security.\r\nAll the efforts to attain the Millennium Development\r\nGoals could be frustrated by the magnitude of this\r\nscourge. It is therefore urgent to stop it through the\r\ncoordinated and focused action of the partners —\r\nGovernments, the United Nations system, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, civil society, the private\r\nsector and individuals — taking into consideration the\r\ncharacteristics and the seriousness of the situation in\r\neach area. The Joint United Nations Programme on\r\nAIDS (UNAIDS) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria are the essential tools for\r\nconcerted action.\r\nWhile commending the contributions already\r\nmade, I reiterate our appeal to the community of\r\npartners for development to be generous in contributing\r\nto the Programme and the Fund, so that they will be\r\nable to attain the set goals.\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nThe Millennium Summit and the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS have raised fresh hopes in\r\nhumanity’s tremendous effort to eliminate poverty and\r\novercome AIDS. Today we have the unique\r\nopportunity to transform those hopes into realities\r\nthrough concrete and generous commitments. The poor\r\nand those living with AIDS throughout the world are\r\nlooking to us here at this special session of the General\r\nAssembly. We cannot, and we must not, disappoint\r\nthem.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Wellington Godo, Permanent Secretary\r\nof the Minister for Health of Kenya.\r\nMr. Godo (Kenya): On behalf of my delegation,\r\nlet me congratulate the President and the Secretariat for\r\nhaving convened this very important meeting, which\r\ndiscusses a topic that is very close to the hearts of\r\nevery delegation represented in this House.\r\nMy presentation is a brief report of what the\r\nKenya Government has been able to accomplish in the\r\npast two years. As part of the political commitment,\r\nafter the formation of the new Government, a sub-\r\ncommittee of cabinet was established to mount a total\r\nwar against HIV/AIDS, which is chaired by His\r\nExcellency the President of the Republic of Kenya,\r\nassisted by the Minister for Health. He took this action\r\nbecause he wanted to be a general who leads from the\r\nfront, and not from the back.\r\nThis is also in line with the commitments that\r\nKenya made during the special session of the General\r\nAssembly on HIV/AIDS held in New York in June\r\n2001, and the African Summit on HIV/AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and other Related Infectious Diseases\r\nheld in Abuja, Nigeria, the same year. During both\r\nmeetings, the heads of State and Government\r\nundertook to provide leadership with the highest\r\npolitical commitment in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\r\nRegarding the implementation of HIV/AIDS\r\nprogrammes, we have developed and launched a\r\nnational AIDS strategic plan, and I am glad to report\r\ntoday that much progress has been made through\r\npartnerships, community-based organizations, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and faith-based\r\norganizations, which have taken on the responsibility\r\nof scaling up prevention programmes at grassroots\r\nlevels.\r\nWe are also targeting the young people, who form\r\n60 per cent of the population, in order to reduce\r\nHIV/AIDS prevalence. Such a programme will include\r\nincreased access to voluntary confidential counselling\r\nand testing, where more than 200 voluntary counselling\r\nand testing sites have been established during the past\r\ntwo years. It is expected that those sites will increase to\r\n350 in the next two years. Members of the Assembly\r\nall appreciate the emerging urgency to reduce the\r\nsuffering of our people by increasing access to\r\nessential medicines for HIV/AIDS.\r\nWe have also taken steps, in partnership with\r\nother developing partners, to expand access to\r\nantiretroviral drugs as a priority. It is expected that, by\r\nthe end of 2003, nearly 11,000 Kenyans will be on\r\nantiretroviral drugs, of which more than 3,000 will be\r\ncovered by the public sector. The rest are going to be\r\nprovided drugs through missionary health service\r\ndelivery and workplace-based antiretroviral\r\nprogrammes through employers and the private sector,\r\nas well as through private physicians.\r\nIn this regard, the Government is strengthening\r\nthe infrastructure for health-service delivery,\r\ndeveloping the capacity of health workers and\r\nimproving laboratory services to cope with the\r\nmanagement of antiretroviral programmes.\r\nIn order to reduce the proportion of infants\r\ninfected with HIV, services for the prevention of\r\nmother-to-child transmission (PMCT) have been\r\nincreased to accelerate the uptake, through\r\ncollaboration between the reproductive health and\r\nHIV/AIDS programmes. There are currently more than\r\n100 PMCT sites countrywide with adequately trained\r\nservice providers.\r\nAs a consequence of increased mortality among\r\nyoung and productive parents, Kenya has one of the\r\nhighest number of AIDS-related orphans, currently\r\nnumbering 2 million. We have therefore embarked on a\r\nprocess of formulating policies and guidelines for\r\norphans and other children made vulnerable by\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nIn partnership with members of Parliament and\r\nkey partners such as the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund (UNICEF), we have put in place measures to\r\naddress their economic hardships, education, health\r\ncare, nutrition, rights to inheritance, and protection\r\nfrom the potential dangers of drugs and HIV infection.\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nThe burden of HIV/AIDS is placing a very heavy\r\nload on health workers and having a negative impact\r\non service delivery. We have initiated measures to\r\nimprove the capacity and the working conditions of\r\nhealth-care personnel. Within the laws of the country,\r\nthe Government has also made progress in rationalizing\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms to guarantee a\r\nreduced vulnerability to AIDS through any form of\r\ndiscrimination.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to take this opportunity to\r\nthank the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\r\nMalaria for approving Kenya’s financial request. These\r\nadditional resources will enable the Government to\r\npenetrate rural areas and arid and semi-arid parts of the\r\ncountry; meet the needs of underserved communities;\r\nand scale up interventions that have proved cost-\r\neffective.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation would like to appeal\r\nto the international community, civil society and the\r\nprivate sector to continue contributing to the Global\r\nFund so that it can continue assisting those in dire\r\nstraits in order to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Kenya\r\nfully subscribes to all international efforts geared\r\ntowards reducing the burden of diseases related to\r\nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria and other related\r\ninfectious diseases, and we look forward to sustained\r\nsupport from the international community.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency to Mr. Jan Karlsson, Acting Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Sweden.\r\nMr. Karlsson (Sweden): I am addressing the\r\nGeneral Assembly at a very difficult moment. Sweden\r\nhas lost its Minister for Foreign Affairs, Anna Lindh.\r\nShe fell prey to senseless, meaningless violence. In the\r\nmidst of our grief, our determination to defend\r\ndemocracy and an open society grows stronger. Our\r\nengagement for the United Nations, for international\r\ncooperation, human rights, peace and justice remains.\r\nThis is the best way to honour the memory of Anna\r\nLindh.\r\nThe fight against HIV/AIDS can be won only if\r\nwe work together — using the experience we have and\r\nlearning from those who have succeeded in halting the\r\nspread of HIV/AIDS and those who have managed to\r\nmake life easier for people living with the disease.\r\nLet me outline five lessons learned.\r\nFirst, our worst enemy is passivity. The countries\r\nthat have succeeded in halting the spread of the\r\npandemic have one common characteristic: there has\r\nbeen a clear and strong national leadership. That has\r\nbeen the case in Uganda, Senegal and Thailand.\r\nWe also have examples to the contrary. Such\r\ncases have been partly responsible for HIV’s spreading\r\nlike wildfire. This is now changing. We are seeing\r\nstronger leadership in many stricken countries and in\r\nthe international community as a whole. I very much\r\nwelcome the South African decision to launch a\r\nnational antiretroviral treatment programme that will\r\ncontribute to a truly comprehensive response to\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nSecondly, we can win this fight only with open\r\neyes and open minds. People will continue to have sex.\r\nYoung people need our support and guidance, and it is\r\nour obligation to equip them with the necessary\r\nknowledge and services so that they can protect\r\nthemselves and their partners.\r\nIt is our obligation to empower young men and\r\nwomen, so that they have the strength to choose with\r\nwhom and when they wish to have sex — and when\r\nthey do not. Better knowledge about sex and about\r\nsexually transmitted diseases does not lead to increased\r\npromiscuity and more teen-age abortions — on the\r\ncontrary. Access to information enables the kind of\r\nresponsible behaviour that we strive for and which\r\ncontributes to reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS.\r\nThirdly, women are key. As was pointed out by\r\nmy Danish colleague, Per Stig Moeller, women carry a\r\ndisproportionate burden of the epidemic. They take\r\ncare of the sick and are responsible for the welfare of\r\nthe whole family. More women and girls are becoming\r\ninfected due to sexual harassment and violence,\r\ncoerced sex and outright rape, not seldom in their first\r\nsexual encounters and in encounters leading to\r\npregnancy.\r\nThe strengthening of the position of women will\r\nactively and forcefully contribute to the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nFourthly, we need more resources. We must treble\r\nthe expenditures being made today in order to reach the\r\nrequired level of $15 billion per year in 2007.\r\nSweden is increasing official development\r\nassistance from 0.81 per cent of gross domestic product\r\nto 0.86 per cent. This is a step towards our goal of\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nagain realizing the 1 percent target of official\r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nAn ambassador responsible for issues related to\r\nHIV/AIDS has been appointed by the Swedish\r\nGovernment. We will increase support for the Joint\r\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)\r\nfrom $7 million to $12 million, and to the United\r\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA) from $25 million to\r\n$33 million. Our support for the Global Fund next year\r\nwill be $37 million.\r\nFinally, HIV/AIDS is about power. We need to\r\nbreak traditional power structures. The right to\r\nknowledge and information, the right to health, the\r\nright to counselling and condoms, the right to control\r\nover one’s own body — these touch on sensitive issues,\r\nrelated to the balance of power in society between men\r\nand women, between children and parents, between\r\nrich and poor.\r\nThis makes HIV/AIDS prevention one of the\r\nmost controversial topics in the world today. It\r\nchallenges both patriarchal structures and dogmas. This\r\nmakes our struggle difficult, but no less important. We\r\nmust do our best to overcome our differences. We owe\r\nit to those living with HIV/AIDS and to the large\r\nnumber who are at risk of becoming infected.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Brian Cowen, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Ireland.\r\nMr. Cowen (Ireland): The fifty-eighth session of\r\nthe General Assembly opens at a time when we will be\r\nresponding to the Secretary-General’s call for a\r\nreflection on the future role of the United Nations. In\r\nlooking back at a successful United Nations global\r\nmeeting which dealt with an issue of direct relevance\r\nto millions of people, we remind ourselves of the\r\nimportance of multilateralism in the age of\r\nglobalization.\r\nI intend to use Ireland’s presidency of the\r\nEuropean Union (EU) in the first half of 2004 to drive\r\nforward the positive role the Union must play in the\r\nfight against HIV/AIDS. We will therefore prioritize\r\nwork on HIV/AIDS in the development agenda of our\r\nEU presidency. To that end, on 23 and 24 February\r\n2004, the Irish presidency of the European Union (EU)\r\nwill convene a ministerial meeting in Dublin to\r\nintensify cooperation against HIV/AIDS in Europe and\r\nCentral Asia. At that meeting, 53 Ministers\r\nrepresenting the Governments of the region will meet\r\nto decide on a workable agenda of cooperation against\r\nthis common threat. The United Nations Joint\r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund have agreed to work with us\r\nin the preparation of the Dublin conference, which will\r\nalso involve close cooperation with the European\r\nCommission.\r\nThe success of the General Assembly special\r\nsession was due in large measure to the tireless\r\ncommitment and leadership of the Secretary-General\r\nhimself. Strong and sustained political commitment\r\nfrom the top is crucial to overcome stigma,\r\ndiscrimination, fear and bureaucratic inertia.\r\nA particular challenge faces leaders in countries\r\nwhere the disease is gaining a foothold but has not yet\r\nreached epidemic levels. They are on the edge of a\r\nprecipice, and only resolute political leadership can\r\nstem the spread of the disease and prevent an economic\r\nand social catastrophe.\r\nWe must not lose our focus on strong and\r\neffective prevention programmes. These continue to be\r\nseriously underfunded, and they lack political support.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report points out that,\r\nglobally, fewer than one in four people at risk of\r\ninfection is able to obtain basic information regarding\r\nHIV/AIDS. That is a key challenge that must be\r\ntackled if we are to save the lives of millions of young\r\npeople.\r\nThe recent World Trade Organization agreement\r\non access to medicines paves the way for the provision\r\nof life-saving drugs to millions of infected people.\r\nIreland recently signed an agreement with the Clinton\r\nFoundation to cooperate with the Government of\r\nMozambique in the establishment of a national\r\ntreatment regime as part of a comprehensive approach\r\nthat also includes prevention, care and support.\r\nHow will fragile health systems in very poor\r\ncountries equitably provide life-saving drugs in a way\r\nwhich does not divert scarce resources from the\r\nprovision of basic health care services? I believe we\r\nneed a new international forum, under the auspices of\r\nUNAIDS and its sponsors, where donors, developing\r\ncountries, non-governmental organizations and the\r\npharmaceutical industry can share views and practical\r\nexperience. It is only through such international\r\ncooperation that treatment regimes can be provided in a\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nway that strengthens, rather than overwhelms, health\r\nsystems.\r\nPrevention, care and treatment cost money. It is\r\nessential that pledges to the Global Fund be turned into\r\nhard cash, and quickly. Ireland has fully paid in 20\r\nmillion euros to the Fund. Within the framework of the\r\nmassive increases in Ireland’s overseas development\r\naid spending in recent years, as we pursue the objective\r\nof achieving the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent\r\nof gross national product by 2007, the volume of our\r\noverseas development aid committed to HIV/AIDS\r\nprogrammes increased tenfold to more than 40 million\r\neuros in 2002.\r\nGiven the gravity of the challenge, it is\r\nimperative that every cent mobilized for HIV/AIDS be\r\nwell spent. We need stronger coordination at the global\r\nlevel among the relevant United Nations agencies, the\r\nWorld Bank and the Global Fund. I would like to see\r\nthe issue of HIV/AIDS as a standing item on the\r\nagendas of the executive boards of the UNAIDS\r\nsponsors and at the World Bank/International Monetary\r\nFund Development Committee.\r\nWe also need stronger coordination at the national\r\nlevel. The Governments of developing countries\r\nstruggling to contain the epidemic should not be faced\r\nwith a proliferation of donor-driven committees,\r\ncompeting agencies and endless demands for reports\r\nand assessments. HIV/AIDS should be prioritized as an\r\narea where commitments to donor harmonization are\r\nput into practice. I fully support President Chirac’s call\r\nthis morning for an annual review by the General\r\nAssembly of progress in the war against HIV/AIDS.\r\nIn addition to dealing with the present threat, we\r\nmust continue to work together to ensure that future\r\ngenerations are protected from the disease through a\r\ncheap and effective vaccine. Ireland has been a\r\nsupporter of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative\r\nfrom the outset. We continue to see that public-private\r\ninitiative as offering hope for the future through\r\nclinical trials, which are pushing forward the global\r\nsearch for a vaccine. We are also founder-members of\r\nthe International Partnership for Microbicides, a new\r\nresearch initiative which should make a major\r\ncontribution to prevention efforts.\r\nI regret to inform Members that I have exceeded\r\nmy time limit. Therefore, in finishing my statement, I\r\nwant to say that we will continue to work with\r\ninternational agencies to continue to work to try to deal\r\nwith this massive problem for the world and for the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Austria.\r\nMrs. Ferrero-Waldner (Austria): Two years\r\nafter our special session on HIV/AIDS, the disease is\r\nstill a lethal threat to millions of individuals and an\r\nimpediment for the economic development of whole\r\ncountries, regions and even continents. Increasing\r\nmobility contributes to the speedy spread of the illness.\r\nWe are talking about fellow human beings who are\r\nsuffering. We are talking about children being infected\r\nin their wombs — children without a chance to reach\r\nadulthood.\r\nThe international community is called to action. I\r\nwelcome the report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/58/184) on progress towards meeting the targets set\r\nout in the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS as an excellent basis for today’s discussion.\r\nI share his view that an effective international response\r\nto the pandemic must be grounded in respect for human\r\nrights principles, norms and standards. Many countries\r\nindicate that the linkage of human rights and\r\nHIV/AIDS is, for national policy-makers, a relatively\r\nnew concept that is not yet integrated into national\r\nlegal frameworks.\r\nPermit me to express Austria’s full concurrence\r\nwith the statement made earlier by the representative of\r\nItaly, which currently holds the presidency of the\r\nEuropean Union, as well as my country’s full support\r\nof the measures taken by the European Union in the\r\nfight against HIV/AIDS, in particular the European\r\nUnion contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria. I also fully support the\r\nstatement of the representative of Mali, which currently\r\nholds the presidency of the Human Security Network.\r\nAustria is a member of that Network and a past\r\npresident and member of the current Network troika.\r\nLet me also express my appreciation for the leadership\r\nprovided by President George W. Bush when, in his\r\n“State of the Union” message earlier this year, he\r\nearmarked $15 billion for combating HIV/AIDS.\r\nIn my statement, I wish to focus on three aspects.\r\nThe first is definitely a positive one; the second\r\nconcerns HIV/AIDS and human rights; and the third\r\nconcerns HIV/AIDS and combating poverty.\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nFirst, I want to let everyone at this meeting know\r\nthat I have not come to appear in front of them empty-\r\nhanded. I am pleased to inform them that Austria is\r\ncurrently engaged in discussions with the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) with a view to\r\nfinancing UNICEF’s project on expanded and\r\ninnovative HIV/AIDS prevention focusing on youth in\r\nEthiopia. The programme is currently scheduled for\r\ntwo years, 2004 and 2005, and the Austrian\r\ncontribution will be $400,000.\r\nSecondly, I want to address the issue of how\r\nhuman rights are inextricably linked with the spread\r\nand impact of HIV/AIDS on individuals and\r\ncommunities around the world. HIV/AIDS is more than\r\na health problem - it is a challenge to society as a\r\nwhole. In his report, the Secretary-General shows that,\r\nwhere individuals and communities are able to realize\r\ntheir rights to education, free association and, most\r\nimportantly, non-discrimination, the personal and\r\nsocietal impact of HIV and AIDS are reduced.\r\nIn this context, I would like to draw the\r\nAssembly’s attention to the importance of human rights\r\neducation. During my recently concluded presidency of\r\nthe Human Security Network, I made human rights\r\neducation a priority theme for the interregional group\r\nof countries from all five continents with the aim of\r\ncoming up with concrete results. The ministers of the\r\nNetwork stressed at their recent meeting in Graz,\r\nAustria, the importance of the struggle against\r\nHIV/AIDS and their commitment to working both\r\nindividually and collectively towards recognition of\r\nHIV/AIDS as a human security threat at national,\r\nregional and international forums and to share\r\nexperiences and best practices in addressing HIV/AIDS\r\nacross regions.\r\nHIV/AIDS was identified by the ministerial\r\nmeeting as one of the priorities of the three-year work\r\nplan of the Human Security Network alongside other\r\nissues, such as human rights education and the\r\nproblems of children in armed conflict, which has a\r\nvery strong HIV/AIDS-related component. The\r\nministers of the Human Security Network also adopted\r\na manual on human rights education. This training tool\r\nis designed for global use and adaptable to a variety of\r\ntarget groups.\r\nI now come to my third and final point.\r\nCombating HIV/AIDS must also be coordinated with\r\nour efforts to reduce poverty. The overwhelming\r\nburden today is born by developing countries, where\r\nthe disease threatens to reverse vital achievements in\r\nhuman development. HIV/AIDS and poverty mutually\r\nreinforce each other. In this context, I am happy to\r\nannounce that the budget for Austrian development\r\ncooperation will increase by 35 per cent in 2004.\r\nToday, putting human rights and the fight against\r\npoverty at the heart of the international response to the\r\nHIV/AIDS epidemic is more important than ever. We\r\ntherefore hope that the time is right to act.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Bill Graham, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Canada.\r\nMr. Graham (Canada): When we met here two\r\nyears ago to adopt the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS, we already knew that the crisis facing us\r\nwas both urgent and catastrophic. Today, the ravages of\r\nthis pandemic are affecting almost everything the\r\nUnited Nations and Member nations are trying to\r\naccomplish and threatening to subvert progress in areas\r\nsuch as development, trade and agriculture. We cannot\r\nhope to achieve any real success in our collective\r\nefforts until we address this pandemic and the\r\ndevastation it has wrought on societies around the\r\nworld.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThis is not to deny that some progress has been\r\nmade in the past two years. The United Nations has\r\nintegrated the reality of HIV/AIDS more broadly into\r\nits operations, led by the excellent work of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Annan and Peter Piot of the Joint United\r\nNations Programme on AIDS. National efforts are also\r\nbeing scaled up, with encouraging results in countries\r\nsuch as Mozambique, Thailand and Senegal. In other\r\ncountries, including Ethiopia and Uganda, the\r\npandemic is showing signs of abatement. This trend\r\nwill continue only if we succeed in breaking the cycle\r\nof transmission. This requires seriously addressing the\r\ndisproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on women and\r\ngirls, through measures including access to high quality\r\nsexual and reproductive health care and services. We\r\nmust also fight the violence inflicted on women when\r\nthey try to take preventive measures.\r\nNew approaches to the pandemic are being\r\nconsidered by groups of like-minded States and such\r\ninnovative thinking should renew our collective resolve\r\nto fight for each human life at risk.\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nFinally, some progress is being made in ensuring\r\nthat care and treatment, as well as prevention, are\r\navailable in developed and developing nations alike.\r\nThe World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-\r\nRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and\r\npublic health represents significant progress in that\r\nregard. In spite of this progress however, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral reminded us this morning that we still have a\r\nlong way to go if we want to fulfil the commitments\r\nalready made.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn Canada, we have worked hard to implement\r\nthe Declaration of Commitment and we are currently\r\nrenewing the Canadian strategy on HIV/AIDS in light\r\nof what we have learned from long years of struggle\r\nand in difficult conversations among our citizens.\r\nCanada’s approach to HIV/AIDS is a rights-based one\r\nthat embodies the principles of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment. We place the highest priority on ensuring\r\nthe protection and full enjoyment of all human rights\r\nfor everyone affected. We work to protect the human\r\nrights of the most vulnerable persons affected by\r\nHIV/AIDS, including injection-drug users, commercial\r\nsex workers, aboriginal peoples, women, children,\r\nrefugees and our gay and lesbian community. Our\r\nHIV/AIDS strategy is grounded in the Canadian\r\nCharter of Rights and Freedoms and draws on a strong\r\ninstitutional framework that backs up legal protections\r\nwith means of recourse when rights are violated.\r\nCanada’s efforts focus on preventing the spread\r\nof HIV through information and education. We know\r\nthat prevention works best where comprehensive care,\r\ntreatment and support are available; and we also know\r\nthat countering stigma and discrimination is crucial in\r\ngetting prevention messages across and in helping\r\npeople access care. We have learned that societal\r\nattitudes about sex cannot be allowed to prevent the\r\nsharing of information that saves lives.\r\nIn this context, I am proud to say that yesterday,\r\nI, like some 10,000 other citizens of my city of\r\nToronto, participated in the annual AIDS walk in that\r\ncity, an activity organized by the AIDS Committee of\r\nToronto to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS and to raise\r\nfunds for its prevention and cure. Over the past years,\r\nwe have raised some $7.5 million through the efforts of\r\nordinary citizens from every walk of life, from all the\r\nmulticultural communities of our very diverse city,\r\nwith the active participation and encouragement of\r\nlocal, provincial and federal politicians from every\r\npolitical party in our system. I am also proud to say\r\nthat similar events took place in 130 other communities\r\nacross Canada — a community response to a pandemic\r\nthat affects us all.\r\nOur strategy has also made gains by going\r\nbeyond Government to engage all sectors of society.\r\nBy working together with people living with\r\nHIV/AIDS, vulnerable social groups, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and business, we have\r\nextended our efforts into spheres that Government\r\nalone cannot reach.\r\nIn the face of this pandemic, we must ensure\r\nuniversal access to prevention, treatment and support in\r\nall nations. More than ever, it is urgent that all nations\r\nwork with their citizens at home and with each other\r\nabroad. I can assure the Assembly that Canada is\r\nwholly committed to this goal.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Alain Bédouma Yoda, Minister for\r\nHealth of Burkina Faso.\r\nMr. Yoda (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): On\r\nbehalf of Burkina Faso and its President, Mr. Blaise\r\nCompaore, who is the President of the national\r\ncampaign against HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted\r\ndiseases, it is my honour to express my great\r\nsatisfaction at the convening of this meeting and to\r\nconvey my warm congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on\r\nthe skill he has shown in implementing the decisions\r\ntaken at the Millennium Summit.\r\nFor the past two decades, the HIV/AIDS\r\nepidemic has been a subject of great concern. During\r\nour special session in June 2001, Burkina Faso, like\r\nmany countries, committed itself to making the\r\nrequired efforts to meet the objectives set. Thus, since\r\n2001, my country has strengthened its national\r\ncommitment and assessed its composite index of\r\nnational policies at 100 per cent. In terms of the\r\nfinancial index of this national commitment, Burkina\r\nFaso is proud of having invested approximately $4\r\nmillion in 2002 in various projects and programmes to\r\ncombat HIV/AIDS, including $2.5 million from State\r\nfunds and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\r\nInitiative. We hope that these figures will have risen by\r\nthe end of the year.\r\nAs for national programmes and behaviour, we\r\nnote the following points. Regarding prevention within\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nthe framework of the multisectoral campaign,\r\nministerial committees to combat HIV/AIDS were\r\nestablished and have been operating since 2002. These\r\nrepresent 18 ministries, each with a specific prevention\r\nprogramme. Of the 30 largest enterprises in our\r\ncountry, eight of them launched a specific programme\r\nin 2002 to combat HIV/AIDS and 13 others are now\r\nunder way. Thus, by the end of 2003, 50 per cent more\r\nbusinesses will be actively involved.\r\nOn the level of decentralization, 13 provinces are\r\nnow engaged in prevention activities to the benefit of\r\n4,000 villages, accounting for some 45 per cent of the\r\nBurkina Faso population. Several hundred non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and associations, along\r\nwith traditional and religious communities, are also in\r\nthe field side by side with the other actors in that\r\ncampaign.\r\nThe Burkina Faso programme for the prevention\r\nof mother-child transmission began in May 2002. As of\r\ntoday, 21 per cent of pregnant women who have tested\r\nHIV-positive have participated in the programme.\r\nRecent agreements with technical and financial\r\npartners, including the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, the World Bank and the\r\nAfrican Development Bank, will further accelerate\r\nprogress in that field.\r\nRegarding health care and treatment, for the past\r\nfive years we have been developing a far-reaching\r\nprogramme for the treatment of opportunistic\r\ninfections. On the other hand, the situation remains\r\nhighly critical regarding the use of antiretroviral\r\nmedicines. It is on that field of activity that Burkina\r\nFaso focused all its efforts since 2001, resulting in a\r\nfall in the price of these drugs following negotiations\r\nwith pharmaceutical firms and, more recently, the\r\nsigning of conventions with the Cipla laboratories and\r\nBrazil for access to generic medicines. Finally, the\r\nGovernment of Burkina Faso recently adopted a project\r\nfor the large-scale production of spirulina to combat\r\nmalnutrition in children and AIDS patients.\r\nRegarding the primary challenge of changing risk\r\nbehaviour, two specific investigations in 2001 and\r\n2002 allowed us to determine that the rate of young\r\npeople between the ages of 15 and 24 who have an\r\nunderstanding of HIV/AIDS prevention is at 60 per\r\ncent, while the figure for those who do not hold\r\n“misconceptions about the transmission of the disease”\r\nhas fallen to 46 per cent.\r\nDespite my country’s tireless efforts, we are\r\nobliged to note that, notwithstanding the fall in the\r\nprevalence rate of the disease from 7.17 per cent in\r\n1997 to 6.5 per cent in late 2001, confirmed cases\r\nremain steady at an average of 1,200 to 1,300 a year.\r\nThus, Burkina Faso reiterates its urgent appeal to the\r\ninternational community to pursue its ongoing and\r\nsubstantive efforts. These efforts should allow access\r\nfor all those who suffer from AIDS, without any form\r\nof discrimination, to treatment with antiretroviral drugs\r\nand other forms of medical care. Antiretroviral\r\nmedicines must become more financially and\r\ngeographically accessible to all. My country keenly\r\nhopes that the procedures of the Global Fund will be\r\nfacilitated for all beneficiaries, because those who have\r\nthe disease cannot continue to wait for the end of all\r\nthe tests to which the primary beneficiaries are\r\nsubjected.\r\nTwo years after the Declaration of Commitment\r\non HIV/AIDS of June 2001, have we fully kept our\r\npromises on the regional and global levels? It seems to\r\nme that a number of things remains to be done to\r\nensure that future generations will be able to judge us\r\nkindly. We are convinced that the Declaration of\r\nCommitment is well grounded and that its\r\nimplementation must be pursued so that the 2005\r\nreview will be more positive and a major step can be\r\ntaken in the campaign. The world community must\r\nmeet this challenge vigorously so that AIDS, this\r\nplague of our time, may soon be nothing but a horrible\r\nmemory to our peoples.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Dimitrij Rupel, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Slovenia.\r\nMr. Rupel (Slovenia): AIDS represents one of\r\nthe greatest dangers in today’s world. It causes human\r\nsuffering and personal tragedies. AIDS undermines the\r\neconomic and social development and security of many\r\ncountries, particularly those already weakened by\r\nunderdevelopment, poverty and hunger, or even by war.\r\nWith the adoption of the Declaration of Commitment\r\non HIV/AIDS two years ago, the international\r\ncommunity pronounced itself in favour of resolute\r\nglobal action against the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It is now\r\ntime to assess what has been achieved and where we\r\nshould direct our efforts in the future.\r\nBy convening this high-level series of meetings,\r\nthe United Nations has confirmed that the fight against\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nHIV/AIDS remains one of its priorities. Slovenia\r\nwelcomes the progress report by the Secretary-General\r\non the implementation of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment. We are glad that it has become an\r\nimportant reference for developing strategies in the\r\nfight against HIV/AIDS at all levels. All relevant\r\nprotagonists — Governments, civil society and the\r\nmedical profession — recognize that it is an important\r\ntool in the endeavours to reduce the scope and\r\nconsequences of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\r\nUnfortunately, projections show that the\r\nepidemic — particularly in countries with low- and\r\nmedium-level national incomes — will continue to\r\nspread if preventive and containment action does not\r\nimprove considerably. Countries that have not yet\r\nadopted national strategies must be encouraged to do\r\nso, since the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a global threat\r\nrequiring a global response and the cooperation of all\r\nrelevant parties.\r\nThe success of global action must be assessed in\r\nterms of success at the individual level, since the fight\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS is focused on the human being and\r\nhis/her security, well-being and dignity. One should not\r\nneglect the human rights aspect in the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS. Many individuals affected by HIV/AIDS\r\nare discriminated against, stigmatized and isolated due\r\nto a range of prejudices. The repeated discrimination\r\nthat many of those individuals infected, ill, or\r\notherwise affected face due to other personal\r\ncircumstances must be prevented.\r\nAs a new member of the European Union,\r\nSlovenia will contribute to joint efforts to the best of its\r\nabilities and within the framework of the Global Fund\r\nto Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. We\r\nbelieve that the Fund will provide those infected with\r\nHIV better access to antiretroviral drugs.\r\nSlovenia is aware of the threat. Through its\r\nsustained and consistent efforts, the number of HIV-\r\npositive individuals in my country has been kept at a\r\nvery low level. Considerably fewer than one individual\r\nper 1,000 inhabitants is living with HIV/AIDS. During\r\nthe most recent five-year period from 1998 to 2002, the\r\nannual reported incidence rates of newly-diagnosed\r\ncases have remained fairly stable.\r\nWe believe that this success is a result of a\r\nmultisectoral and comprehensive approach that was\r\nadopted with the national strategy for AIDS prevention\r\nand care. The three broadly-defined objectives of the\r\nnational AIDS Prevention and Control Programme are\r\nto prevent the spread of HIV infection, to reduce the\r\npersonal and social impact of HIV infection and AIDS,\r\nand to mobilize and unify national efforts for\r\nprevention and control.\r\nThis approach has proved to be a good model for\r\nthe control of the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\r\nOn this occasion, I would therefore like to reiterate\r\nSlovenia’s readiness to share its knowledge and\r\nexperience with other countries, as well as to\r\nparticipate in regional or global efforts for developing\r\nstrategies and effective responses to the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Dato’ Chua Jui Meng,\r\nMinister for Health of Malaysia.\r\nMr. Meng (Malaysia): Two years ago, we\r\ngathered here to commit ourselves to arresting a\r\npandemic that has not spared any country and that has\r\nraged like wildfire, fuelled by poverty, ignorance,\r\nunsafe sex and drug abuse.\r\nLong before the special session of the General\r\nAssembly in 2001, Malaysia had already taken heed of\r\nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic at our doorsteps and had taken\r\nmeasures to ensure that the safety of our people,\r\nespecially our young, was not compromised.\r\nPrevention, treatment, care and support programmes\r\nhave been in place since 1985.\r\nWe realize that, if we are to succeed against\r\nHIV/AIDS, we will need governmental commitment. In\r\nthe past two years, the Malaysian Government has\r\nmade available about $21 million for HIV/AIDS-\r\nrelated work. Of this sum, $8.3 million were spent on\r\nHIV prevention and control and $10 million on clinical\r\ncare and treatment.\r\nBecause 80 per cent of infections in Malaysia\r\noccur among young people aged 20 to 35, the\r\nGovernment has placed great priority on prevention\r\nprogrammes for our young. This includes the\r\nAnti-AIDS Program for Youth — what we call\r\nPROSTAR — which has trained 40,000 young people\r\nas peer educators on HIV/AIDS. They in turn have\r\nreached out to over 800,000 young Malaysians,\r\nempowering them with knowledge about the disease. In\r\naddition, we support other non-governmental\r\norganizations that work among our young. In 2003, the\r\nMalaysian Federation of Family Planning Associations\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nwas given $500,000 to provide sexual and reproductive\r\nhealth education, including on HIV/AIDS, via the\r\nInternet to Malaysian youth.\r\nWomen are also a priority area. Since 1998, the\r\nGovernment has provided free and voluntary HIV\r\nscreening to pregnant women at antenatal clinics and\r\nhas given free antiretroviral treatment to HIV-positive\r\nmothers to prevent transmission of the virus to their\r\nbabies. Over the past five years, 1.5 million mothers\r\nhave been screened. In 2002, only five babies infected\r\nwith the virus were born from 110 HIV-positive\r\nmothers — a low transmission rate of only 4.55 per\r\ncent compared to the expected 30 per cent if treatment\r\nhad not been given. In addition, all the HIV-positive\r\nmothers and their babies identified through this\r\nprogramme are entitled to free antiretroviral treatment.\r\nMore, however, needs to be done to address\r\nprevention of HIV infection among women and, to that\r\nend, we are assisting the Ministry of Women and\r\nFamily Development and women’s and HIV/AIDS non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in undertaking research to\r\nbetter understand the issues related to the spread of the\r\nepidemic among Malaysian women.\r\nThe Malaysian Government’s allocations for\r\nHIV/AIDS demonstrate clearly that Malaysia is taking\r\na multisectoral approach. We realize that HIV/AIDS is\r\nmore than a medical issue and that an appropriate\r\nresponse requires the joint efforts of the Government,\r\ncivil society and the private sector. For instance, in the\r\npast year we have allocated $10 million to the\r\nMalaysian AIDS Council, an umbrella body of 37 non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, to be disbursed over a\r\nperiod of 10 years to conduct prevention, care and\r\nsupport programmes, particularly for the vulnerable\r\ngroups.\r\nThe Government is also working jointly with the\r\nMalaysian AIDS Council to incorporate religious\r\nleaders into the national HIV/AIDS response in\r\nrecognition of the major role that religion plays in the\r\nlives of Malaysians and in helping to alleviate stigma\r\nand discrimination. This year, the Islamic Development\r\nDepartment of the Prime Minister’s Department and\r\nthe Malaysian AIDS Council jointly organized the\r\nsecond International Muslim Leaders’ Consultation,\r\nwhich brought together almost 200 delegates from\r\naround the world to establish guiding principles on\r\nhow Muslim communities should respond to the\r\nepidemic. In addition, the Government is also jointly\r\ncollaborating with the Malaysian AIDS Council to\r\nconduct training programmes on HIV/AIDS for\r\nMuslim leaders throughout the country. These activities\r\nillustrate that the global Muslim community is as\r\nconcerned about the HIV/AIDS pandemic as any other\r\nreligious groupings and is taking action to respond\r\nappropriately.\r\nThe private sector in Malaysia is also involved in\r\nthe national response. Spearheaded by the Ministry of\r\nHuman Resources, a Code of Practice on HIV/AIDS in\r\nthe Workplace has been formulated in consultation with\r\nnon-governmental organizations and the private sector\r\nin order to ensure an HIV-educated workforce and\r\nestablish non-discriminatory standards for the\r\nemployment and treatment of HIV-positive workers. In\r\naddition, some corporations are, on their own initiative,\r\nconducting HIV/AIDS education programmes for their\r\nemployees, with support from non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nTogether, we must prevail. There is no other\r\nalternative.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Urbain Olanguena Awono, Minister\r\nfor Public Health of Cameroon.\r\nMr. Awono (Cameroon) (spoke in French): Allow\r\nme at the outset to discharge a double duty entrusted to\r\nme by the President of the Republic of Cameroon, Mr.\r\nPaul Biya, who this morning began a State visit to\r\nChina. He requested me first to convey his\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Hunte on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly and, secondly, to\r\nexpress to Secretary-General Kofi Annan his\r\nappreciation for his kind invitation and for his\r\ndedication and commitment to the campaign against\r\nHIV/AIDS. His report and his statement this morning\r\nbear witness to that commitment.\r\nThe AIDS epidemic is a highly complex\r\nchallenge to today’s world. If we are to meet it, we will\r\nneed a great deal of political courage, humanity,\r\nrelevant strategies and the means necessary to\r\nimplementing them. In Cameroon, where,\r\nunfortunately, the infection rate rose to 11.8 per cent in\r\n2002, the response must be bold, in accordance with\r\nthe wishes of the Head of State, who has made the anti-\r\nAIDS campaign a national challenge and has instructed\r\nthe Government to draw up a national strategic plan to\r\nthat end. Adopted for the period 2000-2005 and\r\nsubmitted to the public by the Prime Minister in\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nSeptember 2000, this plan — an integral part of our\r\nanti-poverty strategy — reflects the authorities’\r\ncommitment to addressing directly the problem of\r\nHIV/AIDS and its consequences at the social and the\r\neconomic levels.\r\nOver the past two years, a strengthening of\r\ninstitutional pillars, an intensification of our prevention\r\npolicy and a gradual expansion of access to treatment\r\nhave considerably improved the quality and\r\neffectiveness of Cameroon’s response to HIV, in\r\naccordance with the options of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe emphasis on prevention as an essential pillar\r\nof our plan of action has been manifested through\r\nvarious efforts, including ongoing targeted information\r\nand education campaigns to change behaviour, the\r\npromotion of the use of condoms and the development\r\nof a network of health centres throughout the country\r\nfor the detection of HIV on a voluntary basis. In that\r\nregard, the establishment of 136 centres devoted to\r\npreventing the transmission of HIV from mother to\r\nchild has made it possible to reduce that particular rate\r\nof transmission by half, which is the most unjust type\r\nof infection given that it affects innocent people.\r\nIn a word, our strategy consists of erecting a\r\nbarrier to provide strong protection for young people\r\nand women — who pay the heaviest price — as well as\r\nto contain the epidemic among groups at risk. In that\r\nconnection, Cameroon has developed and implemented\r\nsix sectoral plans, including in the areas of education,\r\nwomen and defence. A multisectoral approach has\r\ntherefore been adopted to mobilize our plan at both the\r\nnational and grassroots levels. To the same end, our\r\nprogramme has also benefited from a participatory\r\nprocess as part of this struggle that involves thousands\r\nof communities, groups of persons living with HIV,\r\nnon-governmental organizations and other civil society\r\ngroups, including traditional leaders. Their plans of\r\naction have been supported in the field by virtue of the\r\nfact that our national programme is decentralized,\r\nwhich makes it possible to organize their work through\r\nprovincial, communal and local committees to fight the\r\ndisease.\r\nOur experience in enlisting the assistance of the\r\nvarious actors in society in the fight against HIV/AIDS\r\nhas taught us the usefulness of promoting public-\r\nprivate partnerships to make more concrete progress.\r\nThe National Committee to Combat AIDS has\r\ntherefore concluded 37 agreements with private\r\nbusinesses, as well as 17 with religious groups. That\r\nwork is continuing.\r\nWith regard to the response on the health front,\r\nour Government considers access to high-quality health\r\nservices to be a fundamental right of every citizen. The\r\npolicy we are pursuing is therefore designed to\r\npromote and expand access to treatment with\r\nantiretroviral medications. In that regard, Mr. Paul\r\nBiya, the President of Cameroon, has decided to\r\nprovide approximately $1 in annual subsidies to reduce\r\nthe cost of treatment. Thanks to those subsidies — as\r\nwell as to the agreements we have reached with\r\npharmaceutical firms and the introduction of generic\r\ndrugs — the monthly cost of treatment has been\r\nreduced to $30 per patient. Also as a result of that\r\npolicy, the number of persons undergoing treatment has\r\ngrown ten-fold: from 600 in 2001 to over 6,000 in\r\n2003.\r\nResearch has not been neglected either, and is\r\npart of a strategy being developed with various\r\ninternational institutions. In addition, Cameroon is also\r\na supporter of such regional initiatives as African\r\nSynergy, an association African First Ladies launched\r\nby Mrs. Chantal Biya in 2002. In addition, Cameroon is\r\ndrafting laws pertaining to the rights and duties of\r\npersons living with HIV/AIDS, as well as a law\r\nregarding the safety of blood transfusions.\r\nIn sum, the vision and resolute determination of\r\nCameroon’s leaders in the face of HIV/AIDS reflects\r\nour conviction that this tragedy represents a real threat\r\nto our country’s peace, social stability and prospects\r\nfor development. It is for that reason that every\r\ncontribution aimed at helping us to win this\r\nhumanitarian war is welcomed.\r\nCameroon has already devoted its own resources\r\nto this effort on a priority basis, including resources\r\nderived from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt\r\nInitiative. We welcome the assistance we have received\r\nfrom several partners, and we wish to thank them for\r\nthe various types of support they have provided.\r\nMy country appeals to rich countries to contribute\r\nto the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis\r\nand Malaria. The Fund, which was established after the\r\nholding of the special session of the General Assembly\r\ndevoted to HIV/AIDS, has made considerable progress\r\nin the 18 months since it was created as the financial\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\ninstrument most open to countries where those three\r\ndiseases are endemic.\r\nGiven the urgent humanitarian and health\r\nsituation created by HIV/AIDS, there is an imperative\r\nand ethical need for solidarity and partnership. Those\r\nduties must be a part of our common agenda as we\r\nmove towards a better and more equitable world. More\r\nspecifically, we believe that access to treatment as a\r\nfundamental human right and the goal of health as a\r\npublic good constitute the guiding principles and\r\nfoundation of a global response commensurate with\r\nthose challenges.\r\nIf sufficient resources are not mobilized to carry\r\nout our activities on a scale conducive to eradicating\r\nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic, then the noble Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, which were adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly in 2000, will never be achieved by\r\nsub-Saharan Africa. Given that danger, the time has\r\ncome for us to relaunch together a new spirit of\r\npartnership and concrete action aimed at results and\r\nsustained progress. Given that the AIDS crisis is not a\r\nshort-term problem, our efforts should be long-term in\r\nnature. As the Secretary-General emphasized this\r\nmorning, accomplishing that will require shared\r\npolitical will, mobilization of resources and specific\r\nefforts to better ensure the future of the world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Albertina Julia Hamukwaya,\r\nMinister of Health of the Republic of Angola.\r\nMrs. Hamukwaya (Angola) (spoke in\r\nPortuguese; English text furnished by the delegation): I\r\nwould like, on behalf of the Government of Angola and\r\non my own behalf, to welcome the holding of this high-\r\nlevel meeting of the General Assembly devoted to\r\nassessing the progress achieved in the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS since the adoption of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment by the special session of the General\r\nAssembly in 2001.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to decimate\r\nour populations in such a manner that many of our\r\ncountries’ development achievements since gaining\r\nindependence in the 1960s and 1970s are being\r\nseriously threatened.\r\nAngola’s HIV infection rate is about 5.5 per cent\r\nin the adult population, a relatively low rate compared\r\nto other countries of our region. That reality calls for\r\neffective support from the international community so\r\nthat we may benefit from the achievements of other\r\ncountries in order to contain the epidemic.\r\nThe impact of HIV/AIDS has been devastating,\r\nand it is felt at all levels of society, including families,\r\ncommunities, productive sectors and nations as a\r\nwhole. The consequences for families include\r\nincreased poverty, the dissolution of family groupings\r\nand increased rates of school-dropout, especially in\r\nfamilies run by orphaned children.\r\nAfter more than 30 years of war, the new\r\nenvironment in Angola includes many competing\r\npriorities. However, the issue of HIV/AIDS is at the\r\ntop of our concerns and priorities, given its negative\r\nimpact on life expectancy and at the macro-economic\r\nlevel, as well as on the quality of life of the population.\r\nTaking that into account, and in accordance with the\r\ncommitments entered into at Abuja in April 2001 and\r\nduring the special session of the General Assembly, the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Angola has assumed a\r\nleadership role in the fight against HIV/AIDS by\r\ncoordinating the activities of the National Commission\r\nto Fight HIV/AIDS and by giving it all the powers it\r\nrequires and the influence of his own name. In\r\naddition, a special fund was established to fight AIDS\r\nand other major epidemics, a step which has made it\r\npossible to update our national strategic plan to bring it\r\ninto line with the new challenges of peace.\r\nOther initiatives have also been undertaken in the\r\nframework of that same commitment, including\r\nprogrammes to halt vertical transmission of the disease\r\nand to guarantee the safety of the blood supply at the\r\nlevel of provincial capitals; mass information and\r\neducational campaigns, mainly for young people within\r\nand outside the educational system, displaced and\r\nrefugee populations, sex workers and truck drivers; the\r\nfree distribution of condoms; voluntary testing; the\r\nopening of counselling and testing centres; the\r\nestablishment of centres to evaluate and monitor the\r\ninfection; and the launching of a programme to\r\nintroduce antiretroviral therapy.\r\nExpertise, partnership, cooperation, funding and\r\nsolidarity are the essential elements of our globalized\r\nworld that must be taken into a count to implement\r\nnational plans to intensify our response to AIDS. We\r\nare all convinced that success in the fight against the\r\nepidemic will depend upon the practical, effective steps\r\nwe are called upon to implement as part of our\r\ncommitments with regard to HIV/AIDS.\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nThere have been remarkable advances in HIV\r\ntherapies with the introduction of antiretroviral drugs.\r\nHowever, taking into account the dimension of the\r\nscourge and our scarce resources, those efforts will\r\nhave a greater impact when we are in a position to\r\nobtain antiretroviral drugs and test kits on more\r\nfavourable terms.\r\nGiven the importance of human rights, these\r\nmeetings should serve to provide the masses in\r\ndeveloping countries with the same right to well-being\r\nenjoyed by peoples in developed countries.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Marcus Bethel, Minister of Health\r\nof the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.\r\nMr. Bethel (Bahamas): I am pleased to\r\nparticipate in these high-level meetings of the General\r\nAssembly devoted to the follow-up to the outcome of\r\nthe Assembly’s twenty-sixth special session, on\r\nHIV/AIDS, and the implementation of the Declaration\r\nof Commitment on HIV/AIDS. Just over two years ago,\r\nwe came together to adopt an action-oriented, time-\r\nbound set of targets and commitments in an effort to\r\ncombat the deadly HIV/AIDS pandemic, which\r\ncontinues to take its toll on individuals and on the\r\ndevelopment prospects of many of our nations. This\r\nfirst high-level review is a very timely one, given that\r\nthe first set of targets in the Declaration fell due in\r\n2002.\r\nThe Joint United Nations Programme on\r\nHIV/AIDS has described the HIV/AIDS epidemic in\r\nthe Bahamas as a mature, generalized heterosexual\r\nepidemic affecting 4 per cent of the population between\r\n15 and 49 years of age. With those facts in mind, the\r\nCommonwealth of the Bahamas has established a\r\nmultidisciplinary, integrated and comprehensive\r\nnational AIDS programme, with significant\r\ncontributions from many partners, namely the religious\r\ncommunity and corporate and civil society. The\r\nprogramme in the Bahamas is a model of success for\r\nthe Caribbean region. The care and support of patients\r\nwith HIV/AIDS has been a major component of our\r\nnational response, coupled with prevention,\r\nepidemiological surveillance and public education.\r\nThe Government of the Bahamas reaffirms its\r\nunswerving commitment to the Declaration of\r\nCommitment. In these difficult economic times, the\r\nGovernment has spent over $5 million in the past year\r\nin services to implement our HIV/AIDS strategic plan.\r\nDuring that period, the Government accelerated access\r\nto care and support and increased the availability of\r\nantiretroviral therapy to persons living with HIV/AIDS.\r\nIn that same time, we have strengthened HIV/AIDS\r\nsurveillance; expanded HIV/AIDS education and\r\nprevention activities; trained laboratory staff, with a\r\nview to establishing a specialized HIV/AIDS\r\nlaboratory; and participated in research activities to\r\npromote the establishment of a regional HIV/AIDS\r\ntraining and resource centre for the Caribbean region.\r\nIt is the intention of the Government of the\r\nBahamas to provide universal access to antiretroviral\r\ntherapy by the year 2005, provided that the cost of\r\nantiretroviral medicines continues to decrease and that\r\nnegotiations with research and development\r\npharmaceutical companies for reduced prices are\r\nsuccessful. At the special session in 2001, the Bahamas\r\noutlined several national targets to combat HIV/AIDS\r\nin our nation. It is a source of pride for us that we have\r\nstarted to meet some of those targets. To that end,\r\nantiretroviral therapy has been provided to\r\napproximately 25 per cent of the targeted population in\r\na one-year period, and all HIV-positive pregnant\r\nwomen receive full antiretroviral treatment during and\r\nafter pregnancy, which resulted in a reduction of\r\nmother-to-child transmission to 3 per cent in 2002.\r\nWith respect to prevention and education, we\r\nhave sought to target specific high-risk groups,\r\nespecially young persons, drug users and immigrants.\r\nHealth education, with an emphasis on behavioural\r\nchange, is directed at all segments of the population,\r\nincluding workers, employers, adolescents,\r\nschoolchildren and police officers and other uniformed\r\nservices. Those efforts have also been extended to our\r\ntourism sector. Tourism remains the main engine of\r\ngrowth of the Bahamas economy. At this time, 40 per\r\ncent of hotels in the Bahamas have preventive\r\nprogrammes in place, and it is our intention to raise\r\nthat number in collaboration with our partners in the\r\nindustry.\r\nI am pleased to say that due to those efforts, and\r\nothers, the prevalence rate in the Bahamas has been\r\nreduced significantly over the past seven years, and\r\ndeaths from HIV/AIDS decreased by 50 per cent in\r\n2002 as a direct result of the up-scaling of\r\nantiretroviral therapies. Paediatric and adult in-patient\r\nadmissions have been greatly reduced, as has the\r\naverage length of hospital stays.\r\n29\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nDespite our success in some areas in combating\r\nHIV/AIDS, we continue to face many challenges,\r\nparticularly in the areas of manpower and tactical\r\nfinancial resources, challenges that must be addressed\r\nif we are to sustain our HIV/AIDS programme. The\r\nsocio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS has been felt\r\nthroughout our archipelago. The resources of the\r\nMinistry of Social Services and of many other\r\nGovernment agencies have been sorely tested by the\r\nrate of infection and the growing phenomenon of HIV\r\norphans. Accordingly, the Bahamas remains committed\r\nto regional and international cooperation in the\r\nimplementation of the Declaration of Commitment and\r\nnational and regional strategies to combat HIV/AIDS.\r\nWe must never forget that our task is an urgent\r\none. Combating HIV/AIDS must remain a national and\r\ninternational priority. The direct and indirect costs of\r\nHIV to individuals, to our economies and to our\r\ndevelopment prospects have been staggering. Let us\r\nnow reaffirm our collective resolve to stem the tide of\r\nHIV/AIDS by implementing the Declaration of\r\nCommitment and by not allowing our focus or our\r\nscarce resources to be diverted from that critical task.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHer Excellency Ms. Uschi Eid, Minister of State for\r\nEconomic Cooperation of Germany.\r\nMs. Eid (Germany): The fight against HIV/AIDS\r\nis undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges of our\r\ntimes. The sad fates of HIV/AIDS patients, the misery\r\ncaused to their families and communities, and the\r\ncontinuously increasing number of infected persons\r\nworldwide command our attention and demand urgent\r\naction. As we discuss the issue today, during the five\r\nminutes of my speech alone another 50 people will\r\ncontract HIV/AIDS, adding to the burden posed by the\r\ndisease.\r\nIt is only two years since the General Assembly\r\nheld a special session on HIV/AIDS on the initiative\r\nand at the invitation of the Secretary-General. While\r\nmuch remains to be done, the emerging international\r\nconsensus has led to considerable progress, mainly due\r\nto the intensification of global response measures and\r\nenhanced coordination.\r\nAs Chancellor Gerhard Schröder’s personal\r\nrepresentative for the G-8 process in support of the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), I\r\nam very well aware of the devastating impact of\r\nHIV/AIDS in Africa.\r\nAn adequate response strategy can be framed\r\nonly in development terms. Economic development;\r\npoverty reduction; education; income generation;\r\noverall improvement of health care, including capacity-\r\nbuilding for health workers and improvements in\r\ninfrastructure and access to drugs; as well as\r\nadvancements in human rights, especially for women\r\nand girl children; these are all part of a multifaceted\r\nstrategy to fight the disease.\r\nAgainst that background, let me say a few words\r\nabout the German contribution to the international fight\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS.\r\nGermany has supported international coordination\r\nand financial mechanisms. In that context, I would also\r\nlike to commend the Joint United Nations Programme\r\non HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), under the leadership of Peter\r\nPiot, for its excellent work as resource centre, catalyst\r\nfor change and coordinator. The German Government\r\nalso supported the setting up of the Global Fund to\r\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Only recently,\r\nwe committed an additional 100 million euros, raising\r\nour total pledge to 300 million euros.\r\nThe German Government made the question of\r\nbetter access to drugs a major concern in the discussion\r\nof the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on\r\nTrade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights.\r\nWe appreciate the progress achieved. International\r\ntrade rules must support access to HIV drugs, rather\r\nthan hinder it. We trust that this crucial commitment\r\nwill not be affected by the recent stall in the trade\r\nnegotiations at Cancun. I would like to urge all\r\ninternational players to deliver on that commitment.\r\nIn our bilateral work we are active in fighting\r\nHIV/AIDS in 50 countries. In 16 of them a substantial\r\npercentage of our cooperation is focused on the health\r\nsector: supporting basic health care; building capacity\r\nin the health sector, including infrastructure; and\r\nassisting with the provision of adequate treatment, care\r\nand support for people living with HIV/AIDS. We have\r\nsuccessfully experimented with creative and innovative\r\napproaches such as the social marketing of condoms\r\nand awareness-raising through performances by\r\ntravelling theatre companies. Under our public-private\r\npartnership scheme we have intensified our\r\ncollaboration with the business world, either by helping\r\ncompanies with the introduction of HIV/AIDS\r\nworkplace policies or by forging alliances to provide\r\ndrugs free of charge. Moreover, the German\r\n30\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\nGovernment has begun to mainstream its bilateral\r\nactivities in the fight against HIV/AIDS throughout all\r\naspects of development cooperation.\r\nMindful of the urgency of the situation, we have\r\nbeen committing more and more funds to fighting\r\nHIV/AIDS. Our total commitment this year is 300\r\nmillion euros.\r\nWith a view to upholding the human dignity of\r\nthose affected by the disease, enhancing prevention\r\nshould be an international priority in the years to come.\r\nTo achieve that we need still more information,\r\nawareness-raising and education in many countries,\r\nincluding the participation of people living with AIDS.\r\nIt goes without saying that this requires an\r\nenhanced commitment on the part of the Governments\r\nof the countries affected and at risk. Just as we have to\r\nbe vigilant in Germany to maintain good overall\r\nknowledge and awareness of HIV/AIDS among the\r\ngeneral public, other countries may have to be more\r\nopen about giving problems their proper names and\r\nadvocating real solutions. It is vitally important that\r\nharmful traditional practices be publicly condemned,\r\nthat wide-scale access to protective measures be\r\nensured and that women’s rights to sexual self-\r\ndetermination be protected and promoted.\r\nHIV/AIDS is a human tragedy and a threat to\r\ndevelopment, prosperity and security. However,\r\nincreasing knowledge, emerging alliances and new\r\ninitiatives over the past few years show that it is also\r\nan opportunity to forge international and multi-donor\r\nand multi-actor cooperation for tailored responses to\r\nglobal development problems.\r\nOn that note, I would like to urge us all to renew\r\nour commitment today to prioritize the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS and to devote the necessary energy, political\r\nwill and resources to it.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Aïchatou Mindaoudou, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Republic of\r\nNiger.\r\nMrs. Mindaoudou (Niger) (spoke in French): As\r\nHeraclitus said 500 years before the birth of Christ,\r\nwhen health is gone, there is no wisdom or culture;\r\nneither is there strength to fight, and wealth is useless\r\nand intelligence pointless. In 2003, 2,500 later, that\r\naphorism retains all its accuracy and importance.\r\nUnfortunately, health is gone from Africa. The\r\nUnited Nations slogan “Health for All by the Year\r\n2000” has been a failure not just because we did not\r\nknow how to address it effectively, but also because of\r\nillnesses such as AIDS that were still unknown a few\r\nyears ago. It has now been 20 years since the AIDS\r\nepidemic exploded in the world like a bomb, bringing\r\nwith it health, demographic, sociocultural, economic,\r\npolitical, religious and legal consequences, all of them\r\nequally harmful and adding to the devastating effects\r\nof major endemic tropical diseases such as tuberculosis\r\nand malaria.\r\nTwo years after the special session of the General\r\nAssembly and the adoption by the international\r\ncommunity of the solemn Declaration of Commitment\r\non HIV/AIDS, these high-level plenary meetings are\r\nonce again placing the AIDS pandemic at the forefront\r\nof United Nations concerns and at the top of the list of\r\nmajor obstacles to development and to the human\r\nsecurity of the vast majority of the world’s population.\r\nWe are already at the end of the first series of\r\ngoals set out in the Declaration of Commitment.\r\nConsequently, it would seem to be of the highest\r\nimportance for the international community to take\r\ncareful stock of the results achieved in strengthening\r\nprevention and treatment programmes for the growing\r\nnumber of persons with AIDS. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has said, this first evaluation will enable us to\r\ndetermine whether we are on the right path to achieve\r\nthe other goals set for 2005 and 2010. Our current\r\ndeliberations are therefore of the utmost importance.\r\nIn order to keep our promise to stop the spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS and to begin to reverse the current tragic\r\ntrend by 2015, the international community — along\r\nwith the efforts made in the areas of research and, in\r\nparticular, prevention, which remain the basis for our\r\nefforts — must place special emphasis on access to\r\ndrugs in developing countries. In those countries the\r\nfrightening statistics regarding the number of people\r\nliving with AIDS, dying daily and being seropositive\r\npoint to a health crisis rarely known in the history of\r\nhumankind. Given the considerable financial needs of\r\ndeveloping countries in accessing treatment, only a\r\nsignificant increase in allocated resources and resolute\r\npolitical commitment at the highest levels in our\r\ncountries will make it possible to keep that promise.\r\nUntil recently, Niger had been relatively spared\r\nfrom the scourge of AIDS. Although the infection rate\r\n31\r\nA/58/PV.4\r\namong the general population today is over 2 per\r\ncent — from a rate of 0.7 per cent in 1990 — the\r\nnature of the epidemic itself is both complex and prone\r\nto change. We now see that there are significant\r\ndifferences in the rate of infection between rural and\r\nurban areas, as well as among very high-risk groups,\r\nsuch as sex workers, truck drivers, military personnel\r\nand young people. Most new cases are now found\r\namong persons aged between 15 and 29 living in high-\r\nmigration areas. The gender ratio in the adult\r\npopulation is estimated to be 1 male per .85 females.\r\nThat ratio has been reversed in the 15 to 19 age group\r\nduring the last two years; there are now four females\r\nfor every male.\r\nAware of the risk of the epidemic’s spread, at the\r\ntime it recorded is first case, in 1987, Niger decided to\r\nput in place an institutional framework to develop and\r\nimplement a policy to combat HIV/AIDS. A strategic\r\nplanning process was begun to draft a third-generation\r\nmedium-term plan.\r\nI should like to draw the General Assembly’s\r\nattention to a series of four important measures that\r\nhave already been put in place. First, the AIDS\r\npandemic is now being dealt with in the Office of the\r\nPresident. Secondly, a national plan to combat\r\nHIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases has been\r\ndevised for the period 2003-2006. Thirdly, there is an\r\ninitiative in place to provide access to antiretroviral\r\nmedicines. And, fourthly, we have made the fight\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS a component of every development\r\nproject.\r\nIn order to further reflect our commitment in\r\nactions, Niger has decided to improve the economic\r\nsituation of poor people by strengthening basic social\r\nservices, particularly in rural areas. To that end, and in\r\nthe spirit of the 20/20 Initiative, we have carried out a\r\nreview of public spending in the health, education and\r\nrural sectors. Moreover, aware that the problem of\r\nAIDS is also an issue of rights, dignity and\r\ndiscrimination, the Government of Niger will very soon\r\nturn to solving certain problems through legislation.\r\nOne of the most important of those laws will deal with\r\nthe rights and duties of people living with HIV/AIDS,\r\nchildren orphaned by AIDS and public health\r\npersonnel.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like strongly to emphasize\r\nthat the promise made in the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS must be kept. Failing to do\r\nso will mean increasing the number of children\r\norphaned by AIDS, a figure that is already too high.\r\nAfrica alone has over 11 million of them and will have\r\n20 million by 2010.\r\nMore than ever before, the international\r\npartnership against AIDS in Africa must be translated\r\ninto active solidarity among nations, sustained\r\nassistance from international institutions and full\r\ncommitment from the private sector, and in particular\r\nfrom the pharmaceutical industry.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to reiterate our\r\ngreat appreciation for the support of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund, UNICEF, the Joint United Nations\r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS and other development\r\npartners, which have continued to make their\r\ncontributions to the implementation of our national\r\nprogramme to combat AIDS.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate for this meeting.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to draw the attention\r\nof the General Assembly to document A/INF/58/4,\r\nwhich contains a tentative programme of work and\r\nschedule of plenary meetings for the period from\r\nSeptember to December 2003 and which has been\r\ndistributed in the Hall.\r\nI should like also to remind members that the lists\r\nof speakers for items listed in document A/INF/58/4\r\nare open. Furthermore, I should like to remind\r\nmembers that tomorrow, Tuesday, 23 September 2003,\r\nat 10 a.m., the Secretary-General will present his report\r\non the work of the Organization (A/58/1) to the\r\nGeneral Assembly prior to the opening of the general\r\ndebate.\r\nI would like to inform members that, for technical\r\nreasons, the Assembly will adjourn its 4th plenary\r\nmeeting at this time. Representatives are requested to\r\nremain seated, because the 5th plenary meeting will\r\nbegin immediately after the adjournment of this\r\nmeeting.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.\r\n"
