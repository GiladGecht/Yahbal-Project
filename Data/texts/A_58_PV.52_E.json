(Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 23\r\nSport for peace and development\r\n(a) Building a peaceful and better world through\r\nsport and the Olympic ideal\r\nDraft resolution (A/58/L.9)\r\n(b) International Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation\r\nDraft resolution (A/58/L.2)\r\nThe President: I call on Mr. Abderrahim Zouari,\r\nMinister of Sport of Tunisia, to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/58/L.2.\r\nMr. Zouari (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): It is my\r\ndistinct pleasure once again to convey to you, Sir,\r\nTunisia’s congratulations on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at this session, in\r\nwhich I wish you every success. Allow me to read out\r\nthe statement of Mr. Zine El Abidine Ben Ali,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Tunisia, to the General\r\nAssembly on the International Year of Sport and\r\nPhysical Education:\r\n“A few weeks ago, the international\r\ncommunity celebrated the United Nations\r\nInternational Day of Peace. This was an\r\nopportunity to renew our commitment to the core\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter,\r\nincluding the establishment and consolidation of\r\npeace, security and development, and to the\r\nmeans of achieving those objectives. This is\r\nparticularly true in the current sensitive\r\ninternational situation, which requires keeping the\r\nOrganization’s activities and instruments up to\r\ndate.\r\n“That is the context for the desired aspect of\r\nsport as an influential factor in the life of our\r\nsocieties, along with their political and economic\r\naspects. To be sure, sport today is a school of life,\r\nthe beneficial impact of which is not confined\r\nsolely to health and physical well-being, but\r\nextends to the acquisition of values that are\r\nnecessary to social cohesion, the establishment of\r\nrelations, the consolidation of friendships, and the\r\nenrichment of dialogue among races, cultures and\r\ncivilizations.\r\n“It is also within that context that Tunisia\r\nhas taken the initiative of submitting to the\r\nGeneral Assembly the draft resolution contained\r\nin document A/58/L.2. This debate provides us\r\nwith an excellent opportunity to convey our\r\nsincere thanks and appreciation to the General\r\nAssembly for having unanimously decided at the\r\nlast session to include on its agenda an item\r\nrelated to this draft resolution. The draft is a\r\nworking tool that will contribute to achieving\r\ninternationally-agreed development goals,\r\nincluding those set forth in the Millennium\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\nDeclaration, aimed at achieving further solidarity\r\nand cooperation and at disseminating a culture of\r\npeace.\r\n“The objectives of the draft resolution are\r\ncommensurate with Kofi Annan’s decision to\r\ncreate a position of Special Adviser to the\r\nSecretary-General on Sport for Development and\r\nPeace. The establishment of that post reflects his\r\npersonal commitment to promoting sport and\r\nphysical education and his belief in their\r\ninfluence on and importance to the growth of\r\nyoung people and the life of our societies. It also\r\nconfirms the increasing attention being focused\r\nby the United Nations on this area, as evidenced\r\nby the Millennium Development Goals and the\r\nguidelines of the United Nations specialized\r\nagencies, in particular the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,\r\nthe World Health Organization and the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund, as well as other entities.\r\nWe believe that the educational aspects of the\r\ndraft resolution before us are in keeping with the\r\ngoals established by the International Olympic\r\nCommittee when it called for the slogan ‘culture\r\nand Olympic education’ to be the watchword for\r\n2003.\r\n“We in Tunisia have always sought to\r\nensure that sport and physical education hold a\r\nfundamental place in our educational system, for\r\nthey contribute to physical, psychological and\r\nsocial balance and strengthen our country’s\r\ndevelopment process. We have also striven to\r\ninstil sporting values and the Olympic spirit in\r\nour new generations at all educational,\r\nprofessional and civil levels and to base relations\r\nbetween our athletes and others worldwide on\r\nmutual respect and harmony in order to\r\nstrengthen the bonds of mutual acquaintance,\r\nfriendship and tolerance among all humankind.\r\n“In its dedication to this approach, Tunisia\r\nis working to reify these values by adopting a\r\ncomprehensive education, social and\r\ndevelopment policy that defines sport and\r\nphysical education as useful training and\r\nsupervisory tools in the dissemination of\r\neducation, health, development and peace. This\r\nnoble concept of sport has prompted us to join\r\nour efforts to those of the international\r\ncommunity to make sport an instrument for\r\npromoting peace and development worldwide; to\r\nguarantee the right of all children and young\r\npeople of all ages and in all countries to practice\r\nsport and physical education; to help them draw\r\nthe best possible physical and mental health\r\nbenefits from this practice; and to make sport an\r\neffective tool for promoting development and\r\nconsolidating peace throughout the world,\r\nespecially in the least developed countries, where\r\nbasic infrastructure and sport facilities are\r\ninsufficiently varied and developed.\r\n“The noble education, ethical, social and\r\ndevelopment principles and goals reflected in the\r\ndraft resolution before us strengthen our belief\r\nthat it will enjoy the support of all States,\r\nreinforce the status of sport and physical\r\neducation in all countries and strengthen their\r\nrole in the consolidation of development and\r\npeace, thereby allowing us to give the world’s\r\nyouth genuine grounds for hope.”\r\nIt is now my pleasure, on behalf of its 78\r\nsponsors, to present the draft resolution entitled “Sport\r\nas a means to promote education, health, development\r\nand peace”, contained in document A/58/L.2. The draft\r\nresolution was the subject of consultations and\r\ndeliberations, beginning with the debate held by the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) on 10 January 2003. A\r\nnumber of changes have been made to the text by\r\nseveral countries and regional and subregional\r\norganizations and within the United Nations system. I\r\nthank all of them and appreciate their interest in the\r\ndraft resolution, which they have enriched.\r\nIn particular, I thank Mr. Adolf Ogi, Special\r\nAdviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for\r\nDevelopment and Peace, for his efforts to promote the\r\ndraft. Allow me also to express my sincere thanks and\r\nappreciation to Mr. Jacques Rogge, President of the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee, for his tireless\r\nefforts to support Olympic principles.\r\nThe draft resolution, in its preambular part,\r\nrecalls the goals and hopes that our countries place in\r\nsport and physical education, along with a number of\r\ntreaties, conventions and reports that highlight the role\r\nof sport and its educational and civilizational role, in\r\nparticular the Convention on the Rights of the Child\r\nand other documents of the General Assembly on\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\nchildren, the UNESCO Charter, the 2000 Dakar\r\nFramework and several other agreements.\r\nThe draft resolution calls on Governments, the\r\nUnited Nations and other relevant organizations to\r\nstrengthen the status of sport and physical education in\r\ntheir development policies and to include them as a\r\nworking tool to achieve development goals, solidarity\r\nand cooperation and to promote a culture of peace,\r\ndialogue, rapprochement and love among peoples. It\r\nalso calls on Governments, international sport bodies\r\nand sport-related organizations to elaborate and\r\nimplement partnership initiatives and development\r\nprojects to help achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. It further invites Governments to assist\r\ndeveloping countries in their capacity-building efforts\r\nin sport and physical education. The draft resolution\r\nelaborates a series of procedures whereby sport and\r\nphysical education can help to achieve a peaceful\r\nworld and the Olympic ideal. It further stresses the\r\nneed to implement international anti-doping\r\nagreements in all sporting activities.\r\nThe many positive elements of the draft\r\nresolution reflect the extreme importance of this\r\ninternational issue. That is why we have accorded a\r\nspecial place to sport and physical education in the\r\ndraft, which is a keystone document that will offer new\r\nprospects and enrich partnership and cooperation for\r\ntheir promotion. We hope that the International Year of\r\nSport and Physical Education and its broad range of\r\nactivities will help us to achieve the goals elaborated in\r\nthe draft resolution.\r\nTunisia has prepared a preliminary programme in\r\nthis context and hopes to submit it for discussion. Its\r\nelements, including an anti-doping campaign, will help\r\nus to achieve all the hopes of the international\r\ncommunity with respect to sustainable development.\r\nWe also believe that sport and physical education could\r\nbe a tool for the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme to achieve its noble goals.\r\nAllow me also to note Tunisia’s support for the\r\ninitiative on the Olympic Truce. The Tunisian and\r\nGreek delegations have closely cooperated with a view\r\nto ensuring complementarity between that initiative\r\nand our draft on the basis of our conviction that sport,\r\nphysical education and the Olympic principles also\r\nserve the same objectives.\r\nIn conclusion, on behalf of the Tunisian\r\ndelegation and all the other co-sponsors, we express\r\nthe hope that the draft resolution will enjoy the\r\nunanimous support of the General Assembly.\r\nThe President: I now call on Mr. George\r\nPapandreou, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece, to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/58/L.9.\r\nMr. Papandreou (Greece): It is a great honour\r\nfor me to take the floor on agenda item 23 (a) in order\r\nto introduce the draft resolution entitled “Building a\r\npeaceful and better world through sport and the\r\nOlympic ideal”.\r\nThe responsibility for this draft resolution\r\ntraditionally lies with the country hosting the Olympic\r\nGames. As members know, less than a year from now\r\nGreece will have the privilege of celebrating the\r\nhomecoming of the greatest peace gathering of our\r\ntime. The occasion of the 2004 Athens Olympics\r\nprovides a unique opportunity to rekindle the ancient\r\nGreek tradition of Olympic Truce. We want to\r\nencourage the notion that it is possible to create lasting\r\npeace from a pause in hostilities.\r\nPromoting peace was, in fact, the actual reason\r\nwhy the Olympic Games were originally established. In\r\nantiquity, the implementation of the Olympic Truce\r\nentailed a cessation of all hostilities in order to allow\r\nthousands of athletes, pilgrims and spectators to travel\r\nto Olympia to attend this sacred celebration of human\r\nachievement and then return home in safety and\r\nsecurity. The Olympic Truce was upheld for over 1,000\r\nyears, making it the longest peace treaty in history.\r\nBringing the Olympic Truce back to life offers a\r\nconstructive new approach to conflict resolution. The\r\nUnited Nations, and in particular Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan, have long championed the value of\r\npeaceful cooperation through sport. Since 1993, this\r\nAssembly has unanimously adopted six resolutions\r\nchampioning the cause of the Olympic Truce. In that\r\nspirit, the Millennium Declaration, adopted in New\r\nYork in September 2000 by more than 150 Heads of\r\nState and Government, included a paragraph on the\r\npromotion of peace and mutual understanding through\r\nthe Olympic Truce. Today’s draft resolution, like those\r\nbefore it, calls upon all Member States to observe the\r\nOlympic Truce. It is a symbolic call to break the cycle\r\nof violence for 16 days during the Olympics and,\r\nhopefully, beyond.\r\nToday, that message could not be more relevant,\r\ngiven the current climate of global insecurity. In our\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\nincreasingly interdependent yet fractured world, violent\r\nconflicts in another part of the world can have serious\r\nrepercussions in our own neighbourhood. The path to\r\npeace must be through mutual understanding, respect\r\nand cooperation between cultures, religions and\r\ncivilizations. The Olympic Truce not only embodies all\r\nthese values, it provides a means of putting them into\r\npractice at the global level. Truce can be a useful tool\r\nfor diplomacy by providing a vital opportunity for the\r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts and the promotion of a\r\nculture of peace through dialogue and education.\r\nMaking the Olympic Truce a reality in the\r\nmodern world is a challenging endeavour. To some, it\r\nmay even seem like a utopian dream. These are\r\ndifficult times — times of instability and injustice. We\r\nhave no illusions as to what we can achieve through the\r\nOlympic Truce; it is not a universal remedy that will\r\nmiraculously heal the rifts that ravage so many regions\r\nof the world, but surely, if we can stop even a single\r\nconflict, it is worth the effort. While limited in\r\nduration, the Olympic Truce can offer an invaluable\r\nopportunity for reconciliation, as well as provide\r\nrespite for the suffering populations in the world’s\r\nmany war zones. By bringing people together across\r\nborders and beliefs, regardless of race or creed, it\r\nopens up the prospect for longer-lasting peace.\r\nIt is an honour that the President of the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee (IOC), Mr. Jacques\r\nRogge, is with us today and will give us an address at a\r\nlater stage in the debate. He and his predecessor, Juan\r\nAntonio Samaranch, and the IOC in its totality have\r\ncontinuously promoted the ideal of the Olympic Truce,\r\nbecoming an inspiration for us all. Here in this Hall, I\r\nwould also like to thank all the countries that have so\r\nenthusiastically embraced this initiative and expressed\r\ntheir support by sponsoring the draft resolution. By this\r\nmorning, the number of sponsors had reached 189, but\r\nthe final country, Kiribati, has signed on and we have\r\nnow reached the unprecedented number, as I am told,\r\nof 190 sponsors. This means that the draft resolution is\r\nendorsed by the totality of the States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAllow me also to thank the many personalities\r\nfrom around the world — 400 in all — who, in their\r\npersonal capacities, have signed a special statement on\r\npromoting the Olympic Truce. Amongst them are\r\nworld leaders, heads of State and Government, foreign\r\nministers, religious leaders, leaders from the business\r\ncommunity and, of course, leaders from the Olympic\r\nmovement itself. Only yesterday and the day before,\r\nthe two latest signatures came from President Lula of\r\nBrazil and President Toledo of Peru.\r\nA few moments ago, my colleague, the Minister\r\nof Sport of Tunisia, took the floor to introduce the draft\r\nresolution entitled “Sport as a means to promote\r\neducation, health, development and peace”. Greece has\r\nwholeheartedly co-sponsored that draft resolution. It is\r\nvital for the international community to recognize the\r\nrole sport can play in all dimensions of development.\r\nAs host of the 2004 Olympics, Greece has an\r\nacute sense of its responsibility to promote the\r\nOlympic ideals. We hope that, next summer, Athens\r\nwill be a beacon of world peace. To meet that\r\nchallenge, we look to all of Members for not only for\r\nsupport, but also for guidance. We can be educators by\r\nexample, so let us reaffirm our commitment to the\r\nspirit of peaceful cooperation upon which the Olympics\r\nwere founded. Let us lay the building blocks of peace\r\none by one, with patience, perseverance and great care.\r\nLet us send a symbolic message from this international\r\nbody of peace to our citizens and the younger\r\ngenerations of the world for a peaceful Olympics and,\r\nultimately, for a more peaceful world. Let us prove that\r\nit is possible. For, while conflicts in the world will not\r\ncease overnight, if we could have peace for 16 days,\r\nthen maybe — just maybe — we could have it forever.\r\nCrown Prince Albert (Monaco) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly today is jointly\r\nconsidering two issues that are particularly dear to my\r\nheart: “Building a peaceful and better world through\r\nsport and the Olympic ideal” and “Sport as a means to\r\npromote education, health, development and peace”.\r\nThe Monaco delegation is a co-sponsor of the two draft\r\nresolutions on these topics.\r\nOn 25 October 1993, at the initiative of Egypt —\r\nat that time chairing the Organization of Africa\r\nUnity — the General Assembly adopted resolution\r\n48/11 by which it revived the ancient Greek tradition of\r\nthe Olympic Truce. I call this to mind because Africa\r\ncontinues to offer the world many of its greatest\r\nathletes and because it can demonstrate that sport has a\r\nfundamental role to play in the service of development\r\nand peace.\r\nI was privileged to participate as an athlete in five\r\nWinter Olympic Games. The most accomplished\r\nathletes recognize that the Olympic competition is\r\nquite distinct. In addition to striving in an exemplary\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\nmanner for one’s best performance, one has the honour\r\nof representing one’s country in the world’s greatest\r\npeaceful, sporting and cultural gathering. In the age of\r\nthe information society, the Olympic Games represent a\r\nshowcase open to the entire world. The memory of\r\nKorean athletes parading under the single flag of the\r\nKorean peninsula at the Sydney Games in 2000 gives\r\nus hope for an entire nation and for all the champions\r\nof peace.\r\nTunisia’s initiative “Sport for peace and\r\ndevelopment: International Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation” is especially timely. Indeed, the Inter-\r\nagency Task Force on Sport for Development and\r\nPeace — mandated by the Secretary-General in 2002 to\r\nreview activities involving sport within the United\r\nNations system and to promote the more systematic\r\nand coherent use of sport in development and peace\r\nactivities — released the report on its work in August. I\r\npay tribute to the work of the Task Force, which\r\npresents sport as a human right and highlights it as a\r\ndriving force for development and peace and a key\r\nelement in achieving the Millennium Development\r\nGoals.\r\nThe report confirms, perhaps redundantly, that the\r\npractice of sport is essential to the development of the\r\nindividual. It should be part of a health regime and a\r\nphilosophy of life. The practice of sport, however, is\r\nmuch more than that. Sport erases social barriers by\r\nmaking us equal in the face of physical effort. It brings\r\ndifferent languages and cultures into contact and brings\r\nhuman beings together, becoming a means of\r\ncommunication and exchange of such essential values\r\nas tolerance and perseverance.\r\nPhysical education should be accorded its rightful\r\nplace in educational systems so as to teach boys and\r\ngirls alike, at the earliest possible age, to relate to\r\nothers, respect rules and value effort. Disabled athletes,\r\nthrough their resolve, perseverance and performance,\r\nteach us the same lesson. At the same time, we must\r\nensure that the United Nations Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child is applied to young athletes whose\r\nphysical and psychological fragility must be duly taken\r\ninto account.\r\nThe quest to go beyond oneself, in fraternity and\r\nwith respect for others, is truly a school of life. The\r\nrecently established International Olympic Truce\r\nFoundation and the International Olympic Truce Centre\r\ncan and should contribute to disseminating those\r\nvalues. This formidable potential must be exploited. At\r\na time when conflicts persist and the world is\r\ndisoriented by terrorism, sporting activities can serve\r\nas a bridge between peoples, permit dialogue among\r\ndiverse cultures and rekindle hope.\r\nSport is also the mirror of our societies. The\r\nCommission on Human Rights Special Rapporteur on\r\ncontemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination,\r\nxenophobia and related intolerance recently denounced\r\nthe rise of racist physical and verbal violence in sport.\r\nWe must unite against such unacceptable attitudes,\r\nwhich are contrary to the spirit of sport. In that regard,\r\nthe initiative of the Union of European Football\r\nAssociations to distribute an anti-racism guidebook to\r\nhelp the football community to counter that evil should\r\nbe welcomed.\r\nAnother scourge undermining the practice of\r\nsport is doping. Like narcotic drug use, doping is a\r\ngangrene that must be fought energetically and in\r\nexemplary fashion in every sporting activity. On 10\r\nSeptember, the Principality of Monaco signed the\r\nCouncil of Europe’s anti-doping Convention and its\r\nadditional protocol, as well as the European\r\nConvention on Spectator Violence and Misbehaviour at\r\nSports Events. It also signed the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration on Anti-Doping in Sport, whereby the\r\nmain sporting federations and almost 80 Governments\r\napproved the World Anti-Doping Code on 5 March. We\r\nfervently hope that the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization will be able to\r\nadopt the draft international anti-doping convention for\r\nall sporting activities before the twentieth Winter\r\nOlympic Games, to take place in Turin in 2006.\r\nWhen the States Members of the United Nations,\r\nat the initiative of the International Olympic\r\nCommittee, called 10 years ago for the revival of the\r\nOlympic Truce, we committed ourselves to promoting\r\npeace and dialogue. That tradition had been respected\r\nfor more than 1,200 years in the ancient world. I\r\ntherefore call on all combatants, whatever their\r\nunderlying motives, to lay down their weapons and to\r\nwork together with their enemies to find peaceful ways\r\nto end their disputes so that the twenty-eighth\r\nOlympiad, to take place in August in Athens,\r\nGreece — the cradle of the Olympic movement — can\r\nmark the rebirth of that tradition.\r\nThe almost unanimous sponsorship of the appeal\r\nfor the Olympic Truce by the States represented in the\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\nGeneral Assembly commits us, above and beyond its\r\nsymbolism, to uniting in order to not to disappoint the\r\npeoples of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Staehelin (Switzerland) (spoke in French):\r\nAllow me to begin by expressing my delegation’s\r\npleasure at seeing the issue of sport as a means to\r\npromote education, health, development and peace\r\nbeing debated by the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\neighth session. My country also welcomes the fact that\r\nthe draft resolution on that issue is being discussed in\r\nparallel with the draft entitled “Building a peaceful and\r\nbetter world through sport and the Olympic ideal”.\r\nThose two texts are complementary and in the\r\nsame spirit. If Member States encouraged their citizens\r\nto take a greater part in physical activities, not only\r\nwould humanity be in better physical condition, but the\r\nworld would certainly be a more peaceful place. Sport\r\nactually offers an ideal means for developing\r\ndiscipline, self-confidence and the qualities of\r\nleadership. Sport also teaches the fundamental\r\nprinciples of humanity, such as tolerance, cooperation\r\nand respect.\r\nAt the initiative of Mr. Adolf Ogi, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Special Adviser on Sport for Development\r\nand Peace and former President of the Swiss\r\nConfederation, who is here with us today, my country\r\norganized the Macolin Conference last February. It\r\nmobilized key partners from different sectors\r\nsupporting the new notion of “sport for development”\r\nand increased public awareness of the important role\r\nthat sport can play in cooperation towards development\r\nand peace. The Macolin Declaration was adopted by\r\nover 380 representatives of 55 countries.\r\nSwitzerland welcomes the Declaration as an\r\nappeal to Governments, the United Nations system,\r\nsport-related institutions, non-governmental\r\norganizations, the sporting industry, the media and\r\npublic at large to encourage human, social, political\r\nand economic development through sport.\r\nThe Macolin Declaration and its\r\nrecommendations have been a source of inspiration for\r\nthe United Nations Inter-agency Task-Force on Sport\r\nfor Development and Peace, led by Mr. Ogi and the\r\nExecutive Director of the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund, Ms. Carol Bellamy. Last September, the working\r\ngroup presented the Secretary-General with its final\r\nreport, entitled “Sport for Peace and Development:\r\nTowards Achieving the Millennium Development\r\nGoals”.\r\nThe facts highlighted in the report are evident. On\r\na global scale, physical inactivity directly accounts for\r\n1.9 million deaths and indirectly contributes to\r\nsickness and death due to arterial hypertension, high\r\ncholesterol levels and obesity. It is estimated that every\r\ndollar spent towards physical activity could save\r\n$3.20’s worth of medical expenses. Sport is a catalyst\r\nfor economic development. On a global scale, the\r\nsporting industry is valued at about $36 billion, with an\r\nestimated annual increase of 3 to 5 per cent.\r\nOn the other hand, it also tells us that children\r\naged 6 to 12 who take part in at least five hours of\r\nphysical activity per week get better grades than those\r\nwho take part in less than one hour per week. Studies\r\nin 126 countries show physical education’s nearly\r\nuniversal marginalization. Why? Physical education is\r\noften considered to be a non-productive or non-\r\nintellectual activity and, consequently, not essential to\r\neducation.\r\nSports can also contribute to breaking down\r\nsocial barriers and can serve as an effective tool in\r\nconflict prevention, thereby contributing to peace.\r\nConsequently, sports should be better integrated into\r\ndevelopment programmes.\r\nThe aim of the draft resolution being discussed\r\ntoday is to encourage Governments, sports-related\r\norganizations and non-governmental organizations to\r\nstrengthen their cooperation in the areas of sports and\r\ndevelopment and also to encourage the United Nations\r\nto develop strategic partnerships with all actors in this\r\nfield, including with sports associations and bodies and\r\nthe private sector, in order to contribute to the\r\nimplementation of sports programmes for development.\r\nAs host to the International Olympic Committee\r\nand several other world sports associations\r\nheadquarters, Switzerland fully supports the idea of an\r\ninternational year for sport and physical education.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nSport, being a common language of humankind, is an\r\nimportant factor in the promotion of peace and\r\ndevelopment. Since ancient times, sport has\r\ntranscended racial and cultural differences and has\r\ngiven expression to humankind’s aspiration to, and\r\npursuit of, a peaceful and better world, as evidenced in\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\nthe Olympic spirit, which came into being more than\r\n2,000 years ago.\r\nSince Mr. Pierre de Coubertin founded the\r\nmodern Olympic Games at the end of the 19th century,\r\nthe peoples of the world have remained unshaken in\r\ntheir resolve to pursue the Olympic ideal. The founding\r\nof the United Nations and the establishment of the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United\r\nNations, while contributing to the maintenance of\r\nworld peace and social development, also facilitated\r\nthe spread and further development of the Olympic\r\nspirit.\r\nThe Chinese delegation believes that in the\r\ntwenty-first century, countries of the world should\r\ncontinue to uphold the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and actively advocate the\r\nOlympic spirit, so as to enhance dialogue and\r\nexchanges among civilizations and to promote steady\r\nglobal economic and social progress.\r\nSport and physical education are activities\r\nundertaken in the context of humankind’s ceaseless\r\npursuit of the Olympic ideal. Sport not only builds\r\none’s physique but also teaches communication,\r\ncooperation, respect for others and acceptance of\r\nfailure. As such, it is an important medium for\r\nstrengthening ties among different civilizations as well\r\nas their common values.\r\nWe support consideration of sub-item (b) of\r\nagenda item 23 entitled “International Year of Sport\r\nand Physical Education” during this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and would like to thank the\r\nPermanent Mission of Tunisia for its initiative in this\r\nregard.\r\nThe Government and the people of China have\r\nalways admired the purposes and principles of the\r\nOlympic spirit and supported the efforts made in the\r\ncontext of the Olympics to promote world peace. Even\r\nas we speak, the Chinese Government and the Chinese\r\npeople are doing their utmost to prepare for the 2008\r\nOlympics in Beijing, in hopes of making it a grand\r\ngathering that will carry forward the Olympic spirit,\r\npromote world peace and enhance friendship among\r\npeoples of the world, so that the Olympic spirit will\r\nflourish once again, this time in China, an oriental\r\ncountry with an ancient civilization.\r\nThe XXVIII Olympiad will be held next year in\r\nAthens, Greece. It is of great significance that the\r\nOlympic Games will be returning to their place of\r\norigin after more than 100 years. We wholeheartedly\r\nwish the Athens Olympics every success.\r\nFinally, allow me to conclude my statement with\r\na quotation from the address by Foreign Minister\r\nPapandreou of Greece in this year’s general debate:\r\n“Let us reaffirm our commitment to the spirit of\r\npeaceful cooperation upon which the Olympics\r\nwere founded. Let us send a symbolic message\r\nfrom this international body of peace for a\r\npeaceful Olympics and, ultimately, for a more\r\npeaceful world.” (A/58/PV.13, p. 28)\r\nMr. Mekel (Israel): The Government of Israel is\r\nproud to lend its support to the draft resolution entitled\r\n“Building a peaceful and better world through sport\r\nand the Olympic ideal”, and would like also to take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate Greece, the host country of\r\nthe 2004 Olympic Games.\r\nIsrael is of the view that athletic competition,\r\nundertaken in a spirit of mutual respect, fairness and\r\ngood sportsmanship, is an ideal way to foster goodwill\r\nand good relations between peoples. The values of\r\nsports are universal and transcend national boundaries;\r\nthey provide a medium through which diverse peoples\r\ncan interact and promote greater understanding of one\r\nanother.\r\nIn our own region, we have tried to harness the\r\npower of sports to forge relationships and to build\r\nbridges across the dark waters of conflict. We hope that\r\nthese types of competitions will continue to develop\r\nand expand in the future.\r\nThe Olympic Games, as the world’s premier\r\nsporting event, have long been one of the primary\r\nmeeting points for nations divided by politics or\r\ngeography. In that respect, we support the observance\r\nof the Olympic Truce, as an expression of our common\r\nyearning for peace and reconciliation, and we hope that\r\nall Member States will join together in ensuring that\r\npeace and security prevail for the duration of the\r\nGames.\r\nUnfortunately, for the people of Israel, the idea of\r\nthe Olympic Games cannot be separated from the\r\nmemory of the horrific act that tarnished the 1972\r\nGames in Munich, when gunmen from the terrorist\r\ngroup Black September broke into the Olympic Village\r\ndisguised as athletes and killed 11 Israeli athletes,\r\ncoaches and referees.\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\nThat disgraceful act of terrorism and murder,\r\nunprecedented in the annals of Olympic history, is the\r\nvery antithesis of the Olympic ideal. The Games, rather\r\nthan being allowed to transcend politics and conflict,\r\nwere used as a vehicle for the expression of hatred and\r\nthe perpetration of murder.\r\nThat blemish on the history of the Games must\r\nnot be forgotten, as we strive to ensure that future\r\nOlympic events serve to broaden understanding,\r\ndeepen tolerance and respect, and promote peace. The\r\nprominence of a movement is reflected not only in its\r\nendeavours but also in its capacity to mourn those of\r\nits members who have perished for the principles it\r\nwishes to promote. It is therefore unfortunate that, still\r\ntoday, the International Olympic Committee has not\r\nfound an appropriate manner to officially observe the\r\nmemory of the fallen Israeli athletes.\r\nIsrael reaffirms its support for the noble\r\nobjectives of the draft resolution and for the\r\nobservance of the Olympic Truce. The Olympic Games\r\nis one of the world’s only truly global events, and as\r\nsuch presents us with an extraordinary opportunity to\r\nfocus the world’s attention and utilize the good will\r\nthat the Games inspire to build a more peaceful and\r\nmore harmonious world.\r\nMr. Mavroyiannis (Cyprus): It gives me great\r\npleasure to address the Assembly today on the issue of\r\nthe Olympic Truce, that is to say, the idea that\r\nhumankind can achieve a universally conflict-free\r\nenvironment, even for a limited period of time. The\r\nwarmest congratulations must be extended to the\r\nimpressive and laudable efforts made by the Foreign\r\nMinister of Greece, Mr. George Papandreou, and the\r\nPresident of the International Olympic Committee,\r\nMr. Jacques Rogge, to make this endeavour a reality.\r\nI wish very briefly to reiterate Cyprus’s strong\r\nsupport for the concept of the Olympic Truce, which\r\ncould be the prelude to a world free of hate, armed\r\nconflict and acts of aggression, as described in the\r\ncomprehensive draft resolution (A/58/L.9) that has\r\nbeen introduced by Greece and will serve as a decisive\r\nmilestone in our efforts to move in that direction.\r\nIn the same spirit, we welcome the draft\r\nresolution (A/58/L.2) submitted by Tunisia under the\r\nsame agenda item, which appropriately draws attention\r\nto the intimate link between sport, peace and\r\ndevelopment. Particularly auspicious are the references\r\nto the contribution of physical education to the welfare\r\nof children and to the need to intensify efforts to\r\ncombat doping on an international level and utilize\r\nsport as a means to enhance health awareness and build\r\na culture of peace.\r\nSport, peace, culture, humanism and respect for\r\nuniversal ethical principles are indeed the\r\nquintessential ideals of Olympism. The invaluable\r\ncontribution of the Olympic Games to the human spirit\r\nand to civilization has been evident since the Games\r\nwere first held in 776 BC at the sacred site of Olympia\r\nin honour of the Olympian God Zeus. Cyprus is proud\r\nto have been part of the Olympic ideal since its\r\ninception, with Cypriot athletes consistently competing\r\nin the Games at Olympia.\r\nThe sacred tradition of ekecheiria, or Olympic\r\nTruce, was also born in the eighth century BC and\r\nlasted for twelve centuries. It was observed for 7 days\r\nbefore the beginning, and 7 days after the end, of the\r\nGames, in order to allow athletes, spectators and all\r\nothers to safely travel to and from Olympia. The\r\nOlympic Truce was the incarnation of the lofty ideals\r\nenshrined in the Olympic Games.\r\nI would like unreservedly to support the appeal\r\nenshrined in the Millennium Declaration to observe the\r\nOlympic Truce as a matter of tradition. In that way,\r\neach country organizing the Olympic Games in the\r\nfuture could make it an imperative for the Truce to be\r\nhonoured in every Olympiad by introducing the present\r\ndraft resolution into the General Assembly on a\r\nbiennial basis before the holding of both the winter and\r\nsummer Games.\r\nWhile the rationale for the excellent draft\r\nresolution we have before us has to do with conflict\r\nconditions significantly different from those that\r\nprevailed in antiquity, the aspiration of humankind\r\nremains remarkably similar, namely, the termination of\r\nall acts of hostility as well as the peaceful settlement of\r\ninternational conflicts. What has eluded us for so long\r\nis achievable, even if briefly, and, even under hostile\r\ncircumstances, what unites us can be stronger than the\r\nreasons for fighting each other. This first step can\r\ngreatly contribute to the creation of an irresistible\r\ndynamic for peace and reconciliation and for the search\r\nof means other than war and violence to resolve\r\ndifferences. Indeed, the educational value of teaching\r\nthrough good example is at the very heart of the\r\nphilosophy of Olympism.\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\nAs a demonstration of our inherent belief in the\r\nunifying power of all manifestations of culture, and\r\nespecially sports, I would like, on behalf of my\r\nGovernment, to wish the very best to everyone\r\ninvolved in the realization of this ambitious project.\r\nMr. Aguilera (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation is honoured to welcome the two draft\r\nresolutions (A/58/L.2 and A/58/L.9) being considered\r\nby the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session\r\nunder sub-items (a) and (b) — entitled “Building a\r\npeaceful and better world through sport and the\r\nOlympic ideal” and “International Year of Sport and\r\nPhysical Education”, respectively — of agenda item\r\n23, entitled “Sport for peace and development”.\r\nTo everyone’s satisfaction, the draft resolution\r\n(A/58/L.9) entitled “Building a peaceful and better\r\nworld through sport and the Olympic ideal”, which was\r\nintroduced by the representative of Greece, as the\r\ncountry hosting the next Olympic Games, restores the\r\nessential element removed from the previous resolution\r\non the subject by urging all Member States to observe\r\nthe Olympic Truce during the Games that will be held\r\nfrom 13 to 29 August 2004 and to use the Truce as an\r\ninstrument to promote peace, dialogue and\r\nreconciliation during the Games and thereafter. We are\r\npleased that 190 countries have now become sponsors\r\nof the draft resolution.\r\nThe second draft resolution (A/58/L.2), entitled\r\n“Sport as a means to promote education, health,\r\ndevelopment and peace”, which was introduced by the\r\nrepresentative of Tunisia, focuses on the importance of\r\nphysical education and sport as ways of promoting\r\npeace, development and friendly relations among\r\nnations. At the same time, the draft resolution aims at\r\naccelerating the drafting of an international anti-doping\r\nconvention and proclaims the year 2005 the\r\nInternational Year of Sport and Physical Education as a\r\nmeans of promoting peace and development.\r\nMy delegation reaffirms that sport and the\r\nOlympic ideal undoubtedly contribute to strengthening\r\nfriendship and brotherhood among peoples, which are\r\nvital elements in the promotion of development, peace\r\nand cooperation among nations.\r\nCuba welcomes the fact that the 2004 Olympic\r\nGames will be held in Athens, Greece, where the\r\nOlympiad originated and where the tradition of\r\ndeclaring the Olympic Truce began. The delegation of\r\nCuba trusts that those Olympic Games will follow the\r\npath of comradeship in sport in a spirit of healthy\r\ncompetition devoid of cheating, excessive\r\ncommercialization, doping or the kidnapping of\r\nathletes. My delegation hopes that this event will mark\r\nan important step forward in the history of the\r\ninternational sports movement. Cuban athletes are\r\nworking with rigour and dedication to prepare\r\nthemselves for participation in this new Olympic cycle,\r\nin keeping with the high level that Cuban sport has\r\nachieved in recent years.\r\nIt is regrettable that some of our athletes will not\r\nbe able to go to Athens for reasons having nothing to\r\ndo with sport. This is true of the Cuban national\r\narchery team, which was prevented from taking part in\r\nthe world championship of that discipline in New York\r\nin July of this year — a classifying competition for the\r\ngreat event — when visas were denied to two members\r\nof the group in outright violation of the Olympic\r\nCharter. This is not an isolated event.\r\nI would remind you that in just under 11 months,\r\nUnited States visas have been denied to 39 Cuban\r\nathletes who were due to participate in various\r\ninternational events, including the World Cup\r\nWrestling Championship held in Boise, Idaho in\r\nApril 2003. The sporting sphere has not escaped being\r\ncaught in the net of measures that make up the\r\neconomic, trade and financial blockade imposed by the\r\nUnited States on Cuba, something that has been\r\nvigorously rejected by the international community.\r\nSport in Cuba is a right of the people and is free\r\nof charge. Today more than 1.5 million citizens\r\nregularly engage in sports or physical exercise under\r\nthe guidance of a professional. More than 2 million\r\nchildren, teenagers and young students are taught\r\nphysical education and sports by their teachers. For the\r\nelderly, pregnant women and other groups of citizens,\r\nphysical exercise means good health, a longer life and\r\na better quality of life.\r\nIn our country over the years, more than 30,000\r\npeople have earned a degree to teach physical\r\neducation and sports. Eight thousand Cuban sports\r\nprofessionals and trainers have provided services in\r\ndozens of countries, whose athletes have, on occasion,\r\nthen competed and won against our athletes. Moreover,\r\nthe Cuban Government is helping to bolster sports in\r\ncountries of the third world. Evidence of this is\r\nprovided by the International School of Physical\r\nEducation and Sport, whose students are young people\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\nfrom more than 50 such countries and who will\r\ngraduate as qualified professionals in various areas of\r\nsport.\r\nPresident Fidel Castro has said,\r\n“Sport is well-being. It is a standard of\r\nliving, it is health, it is joy and honour for the\r\npeople, and is perhaps the most effective\r\ninstrument to combat criminal tendencies, drugs\r\nand many other vices that beset modern\r\nsocieties.”\r\nIn the sphere of sport, cooperation, respect and\r\nequality must prevail, and not the globalization of\r\ninjustice and inequality. Given this, we shall be able to\r\nadvance towards the genuine Olympic idea.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nMankind needs today, more than ever before, to make\r\nstrenuous efforts to achieve harmony among peoples\r\nand international peace and security based on justice\r\nand equality in rights and duties.\r\nIn the context of this constant effort, we must\r\nhave recourse to history to inform us and prove to us\r\nthe possibility of conciliation and harmony among all\r\npeoples on Earth.\r\nThe Greeks and all other ancient civilizations,\r\nincluding the Egyptians, Romans and Arabs, have\r\noffered enriching contributions to our world. I mention\r\nin particular the philosophy of unifying people through\r\nan organized Olympics, under a flag whose circles\r\nsymbolize peace and unity among all peoples and\r\ncontinents.\r\nToday, more than ever, we need to promote the\r\nvalue of peace. The world is divided between\r\nopponents and supporters of wars and conflicts that\r\naffect all continents and races. The gap is increasing\r\nbetween the rich and the poor; diseases are devastating\r\nthe poor, who have no one to help them, and\r\ncivilizations and religions are not converging, but\r\ndiverging. In the midst of all of this, sports will remain\r\nthe single most ideal environment where barriers can\r\nbe ignored and hatred among enemies can be left\r\nbehind.\r\nEvery four years, the world is united during the\r\nOlympics and everyone perceives the lack of\r\ndifferences among people. The new generation is\r\noptimistic, owing to the spirit of tolerance that prevails\r\nduring the month when the Olympic flame is visible as\r\na symbol of the ability of man to realize peace and to\r\ndefy all negativity. At that time, tears of victory mingle\r\nwith feelings of defeat and everybody feels proud of\r\nthe humanity that has brought them together and has\r\ndeepened in them a love of life and construction and\r\nhas urged them to abandon killing and destruction.\r\nGiven our belief in these ideals and values and given\r\nour ancient civilization based on peace and justice,\r\nEgypt has co-sponsored the Greek draft resolution on\r\nthe Olympic ideal, which embodies all the noble\r\nobjectives. Egypt also supports the Tunisian draft\r\nresolution on the International Year of Sport and\r\nPhysical Education. We note that these draft\r\nresolutions are in conformity with the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations.\r\nWe call on all peoples of the world to be inspired\r\nby the objectives of the Olympics and sports as a way\r\nto realize permanent peace, justice, equality, universal\r\nwell-being and freedom from wars and conflicts that\r\nhave left a legacy of feelings of deprivation and hatred.\r\nWhen competition increases and records fall and\r\ncountries pursue athletic glory and strive only for the\r\nsymbols of the fittest, the strongest, the fastest runner\r\nand the highest jumper, eventually the value of peace\r\nbecomes entrenched and continuity among peoples and\r\ngenerations prevails.\r\nMr. Ekua Avomo (Equatorial Guinea), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nMr. Gilman (United States of America): Building\r\na peaceful and better world is the underlying principle\r\nof the United Nations Charter. Usually, the United\r\nNations does that by considering issues related to peace\r\nand security, sustainable development, human rights\r\nand humanitarian assistance. Today, we are considering\r\nhow to build a peaceful and better world through sport\r\nand the Olympic ideal.\r\nMy name is Benjamin Gilman. During my 30\r\nyears of service in the United States House of\r\nRepresentatives, I was able to serve as Chairman of our\r\nCommittee on International Relations for some six\r\nyears. I have the honour of serving on the United States\r\ndelegation to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nsession from the public at large. One of the purposes of\r\nsuch a role — according to Eleanor Roosevelt, who\r\nestablished the tradition — is to bring the perspective\r\nand experience of the American public directly to the\r\nAssembly’s consideration of matters that affect us all.\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\nThe United States delegation is honoured to note\r\nthe presence today of the Foreign Minister of\r\nGreece, Mr. George Papandreou; the President of\r\nthe International Olympic Committee (IOC),\r\nMr. Jacques Rogge, and other members of the IOC; the\r\nPresident of the United States Olympic Committee,\r\nMr. James Scherr; the Minister for Sport of Tunisia,\r\nMr. Abderrahim Zouari; other key figures of the\r\nOlympic movement; distinguished colleagues from\r\nMember States; and other dignitaries. We are grateful\r\nfor their participation in today’s activities. I should also\r\nlike to note that there are several Olympians in this\r\nHall today.\r\nAs all Olympic competitors recognize, records\r\nare meant to be broken. The number of sponsors of the\r\nworthy draft resolution (A/58/L.9) before us — 191 —\r\nalso breaks a record, exceeding the number of sponsors\r\nof its predecessors and indeed of any other draft\r\nresolution in the Organization’s history. That is truly an\r\nOlympic feat of the first order.\r\nAlthough in its modern form, the Olympic Truce\r\ninitiative is only 10 years old, it revives the ancient\r\nprinciple honoured among States of ensuring the safe\r\npassage of all concerned to Olympia and their\r\nparticipation in the Games. The United States\r\ndelegation has joined in sponsoring the Assembly’s\r\nadoption of five previous draft resolutions in this vein:\r\nprior to the Olympic Games held at Lillehammer,\r\nAtlanta, Nagano, Sydney and Salt Lake City. My\r\ncountry’s delegation enthusiastically joins in the\r\nconsensus today, on the eve of the Athens Olympics.\r\nAthletes pledge their honour to uphold the values of\r\nfair play and honest competition. The draft resolution\r\nbefore us and today’s consensus are fostering a similar\r\npledge: to reinforce the scope and the power of the\r\nOlympic movement, linking athletes of the twenty-first\r\ncentury with those of ancient Greece.\r\nThe United States is highly pleased about the\r\nreturn of the Olympic Games to Athens. Since the\r\nrevival of the modern Olympic Games, in Athens\r\nin 1896, the United States has hosted the Olympics on\r\neight occasions. The Olympic ideal is realized visibly\r\nin the spirit of goodwill. For example, some 27,000\r\nvolunteers made the Salt Lake City Olympics a\r\nsuccess. In a similar expression of goodwill, the United\r\nStates looks forward to hosting the Olympic movement\r\nin the future. In the year 2012, New York City will\r\nhave served as host city to the United Nations for\r\nnearly 67 years. Our hopes are high that at that time,\r\nNew York City will also host the Games of the thirtieth\r\nOlympiad. Excitement is running high about its bid,\r\nand particularly about the fact that, on 19 June 2004,\r\nthe Olympic torch will pass through the streets of this\r\ncity and in front of United Nations Headquarters en\r\nroute to Athens.\r\nHowever, what precisely has been the Olympic\r\nideal? The Olympic ideal goes beyond victories and\r\nrecords to fair play, friendship and, ultimately, peace.\r\nThe Olympic ideal connotes international\r\nunderstanding among our young people through sport\r\nand culture. It goes beyond sports competition to\r\nembrace intercultural and humanitarian activities as\r\nwell. The goal of Olympism is to place sports at the\r\nservice of man’s harmonious development everywhere,\r\nwith a view to encouraging the establishment of a\r\npeaceful society that is concerned with the preservation\r\nof human dignity. It was in 1894 that Baron Pierre de\r\nCoubertin, founder of the International Olympic\r\nCommittee, predicted that the new modern Olympics\r\nwould eventually become both a symbol and the\r\ncentrepiece of a new global era of unity among all\r\nnations. Today’s reaffirmation of the Olympic Truce\r\nrecommits the nations of the world to that global\r\naspiration at the heart of the Olympic ideal.\r\nIn that spirit, the people of the United States\r\nknow and daily live out the positive role that sports can\r\nplay towards a peaceful and better world. We believe in\r\nthe Olympic ideal, and we encourage those — the\r\nathletes, the coaches, the families and the\r\norganizations — who work daily to make it a reality.\r\nThrough sports, one learns about fair play, mutual\r\nunderstanding, solidarity and friendship. Those are the\r\nvery virtues that the United Nations strives to embody\r\nin its work and as an example to the world community.\r\nBut let us be more specific. What are the\r\nsignificant benefits of sports for the youth of the\r\nworld? People who are involved in sports better\r\nthemselves and their societies. It has been proved that\r\nyoung people who engage in sports are more likely to\r\njoin an athletic team than to join a gang; they are more\r\nlikely to stay in school; they are more likely to make\r\nresponsible decisions in favour of clean lives and away\r\nfrom drugs and other dangers; and they are more likely\r\nto go on to higher education. The results are solid and\r\nimpressive.\r\nSports help us to meet the human-centred\r\ndevelopment goals proposed by recent United Nations\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\nglobal conferences. A symbolic reminder of that is the\r\nflying of the United Nations flag at the Olympic\r\nGames. But there are more concrete aspects. The\r\nUnited Nations system has worked in partnership with\r\nthe IOC on many humanitarian fronts to promote,\r\nthrough sports, the quality of life and well-being of\r\nthose living in the most disadvantaged circumstances.\r\nThere are children in refugee camps, in displacement,\r\nin onerous labour conditions, in wars and other\r\nconflicts, in severe poverty and urban violence.\r\nThe IOC’s International Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment Department has initiated programmes\r\nworldwide for the world’s young people. For example,\r\nthey address stress in refugee camps through organized\r\nbasketball tournaments. With IOC charitable\r\nassistance, war-ravaged sports facilities are rebuilt;\r\ncoaching clinics teach the rules of fair play, tolerance\r\nand understanding; and equipment is provided to those\r\nwho are in need. Much is done in cooperation with,\r\ninter alia, the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme.\r\nNotably, the Olympic Solidarity Fund established\r\nby the IOC is spending over $0.2 billion between 2001\r\nand 2004 for the development of sport scholarships for\r\nunderprivileged athletes in developing countries.\r\nToday’s adoption of this Greek-initiated draft\r\nresolution is a solemn moment in that it is essentially a\r\nhumanitarian action.\r\nThe United Nations increasingly attests to the\r\nunifying power of sport. When the family of nations\r\nsometimes finds agreement difficult, it is nonetheless\r\nable to agree to come together in peaceful competition.\r\nFor example, just two days ago on its lawn outside of\r\nthis Hall, thousands of marathoners arrived for a\r\nspirited rally and friendship run to Central Park as a\r\nwarm-up to Sunday’s New York City Marathon, which\r\nincluded more than 30,000 athletes.\r\nThe Olympic Truce goes right to the heart of the\r\nphilosophy of the Olympic Movement. The\r\nInternational Olympic Truce Foundation and its Centre,\r\nlocated in Athens, are the nexus for promulgating\r\nOlympism to mean more than just a medal count. I am\r\npleased to recall that in 2001 my colleagues in the\r\nUnited States Senate adopted a resolution supporting\r\nthe Olympic Truce with the same spirit that animates\r\nsupporters of the Foundation. Through American\r\nphilanthropy, a 22-foot-tall bronze statue entitled “The\r\nOlympic Truce” is being planned for presentation in\r\nAthens early next year. Since Olympism seeks to\r\neducate youth through sports and culture, that artistic\r\ngift will become an icon to that end.\r\nWhether as athletes or spectators, when we meet\r\nat and participate in international sporting events, we\r\nshare in the glow of world-class competition, whether\r\nit be in the heartbreak of losing or in the glory of\r\nwinning, but most importantly, in the goodwill of\r\nparticipation. Sports are truly global activities that\r\nextend into the lives of all people, whether they be rich\r\nor poor, at peace or at war. International competitions,\r\nsuch as the Olympic Games, encourage all of our\r\nnations to set aside their differences in the spirit of fair\r\nplay. They provide everyone with a venue for cultural\r\nexchange and an opportunity to share national\r\ntraditions and customs. Today’s draft resolution enables\r\nour General Assembly to underscore the fact that good\r\nsportsmanship promotes a worldwide culture of peace,\r\ntolerance and understanding, particularly among our\r\nyoung people. As Member States, we set a powerful\r\nexample to the youth of the world in swearing this\r\nOlympic Truce today.\r\nThe United States would like to note its thoughts\r\nconcerning the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/58/L.2 on the International Year of Sport and\r\nPhysical Education. Concerning the reference to the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, we should like to note\r\nthat world leaders at the Millennium Summit, the\r\nMonterrey International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the Johannesburg World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development agreed to support the\r\ninternationally-agreed development goals, including\r\nthose contained in the Millennium Declaration. Those\r\ninternationally-agreed goals articulate a balanced\r\npartnership for development that is missing in the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nHowever, while we do support Tunisia’s worthy\r\ngoals with reference to the proposed anti-doping\r\nconvention, our nation does have some reservations\r\nwith regard to references to that proposed convention.\r\nWe believe that it would be far better to approach that\r\nissue with care in order not to undermine or duplicate\r\ncurrent efforts against the abuse of drugs in sports.\r\nAs I am learning from my colleagues here today,\r\nboth sports and diplomacy seek to reinforce friendship\r\nbetween peoples, and fair play means involving players\r\nwith various interests and abilities on a level playing\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\nfield. In closing, let me note that, indeed, the Olympic\r\nideal is a hymn to tolerance and understanding between\r\nall peoples and cultures. It is an invitation to\r\ncompetition, but competition with respect for others. In\r\nits ideals, Olympism is a school for democracy.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate on this item.\r\nThe General Assembly will now take decisions\r\non the draft resolutions contained in documents\r\nA/58/L.2 and A/58/L.9.\r\nWe turn first to draft resolution A/58/L.2, entitled\r\n“Sport as a means to promote education, health,\r\ndevelopment and peace”. I am pleased to announce that\r\nthe following countries have joined the list of sponsors\r\nof the draft resolution: Angola, Armenia, Austria,\r\nBahrain, Brunei Darussalam, Burundi, Canada, the\r\nCentral African Republic, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nCroatia, Cyprus, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Djibouti, the Dominican Republic, Equatorial\r\nGuinea, France, Guinea, the Islamic Republic of Iran,\r\nIreland, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Liberia, Liechtenstein,\r\nLuxembourg, Malaysia, Mali, Mauritius, Monaco,\r\nMongolia, Namibia, Niger, Peru, Portugal,\r\nthe Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation,\r\nSierra Leone, Sudan, Swaziland, Timor-Leste and\r\nTogo.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/58/L.2?\r\nDraft resolution A/58/L.2 was adopted\r\n(resolution 58/5).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We\r\nturn now to draft resolution A/58/L.9, entitled\r\n“Building a peaceful and better world through sport\r\nand the Olympic ideal”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/58/L.9?\r\nDraft resolution A/58/L.9 was adopted\r\n(resolution 58/6).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): May I\r\ntake it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda\r\nitem 23?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We\r\nhave thus concluded this stage of our consideration of\r\nsub-item (a) of agenda item 23.\r\nAgenda item 14\r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nreport of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (A/58/312)\r\nDraft resolution (A/58/L.10)\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency, to introduce\r\nthe report of the Agency for the year 2002.\r\nMr. ElBaradei: The past year has been a time of\r\nsignificant challenges and achievements for the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In the\r\narea of nuclear non-proliferation, the Agency has been\r\nat the centre of attention and has demonstrated its\r\nability to perform objective and credible verification,\r\nbut we continue to face a number of difficult and\r\nunresolved situations. In the area of nuclear safety and\r\nsecurity, our work is making a difference and we see\r\noverall improvement, but much remains to be done. In\r\nthe nuclear technology field, the Agency is\r\ncontributing to sustainable development through its\r\ntechnical cooperation programme, with the benefits of\r\nnuclear applications increasingly recognized. And,\r\nwhile nuclear power continues to hold great potential\r\nas an environmentally clean source of energy, it\r\nremains in a holding position due to a number of\r\nassociated concerns. Today is an opportunity for me to\r\nreview in more detail some of the Agency’s activities\r\nin each of these areas.\r\nIn the field of nuclear power, the urgent need for\r\nsustained human development will clearly necessitate\r\nincreases in the supply of energy in the coming\r\ndecades. In recent years, nuclear power has supplied\r\nabout 16 per cent of world electricity production and it\r\nremains the only energy source that can provide\r\nelectricity on a large scale with comparatively minimal\r\nimpact on the environment.\r\nOf the 33 power reactors currently under\r\nconstruction, 20 are in Asia. In other regions, the more\r\nimmediate focus is on power upgrades, restarts of\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\npreviously shutdown reactors and license extensions.\r\nFor example, in the United States of America, 16\r\nreactors have had their operating licenses extended to\r\n60 years and many more applications are under review.\r\nThe long-term prospects for nuclear power,\r\nhowever, will depend on the industry’s success in\r\naddressing concerns associated with waste disposal,\r\nproliferation, safety and security, while also improving\r\nthe economic competitiveness of future reactors.\r\nNearly 20 IAEA member States are currently involved\r\nin projects to develop reactor and fuel cycle designs\r\nthat would address some of these concerns, and a\r\nnumber of countries are also exploring the nuclear co-\r\ngeneration of hydrogen to address demands for cleaner\r\nenergy in the transportation sector.\r\nUnder the technical cooperation programmes of\r\nthe IAEA, nuclear applications are gaining increasing\r\nimportance as tools for social and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn the field of human health, the number of new\r\ncancer cases per year in the developing world is\r\nexpected to double to 10 million by 2015 as life\r\nexpectancy increases and lifestyles change. However,\r\nmost developing countries do not have sufficient\r\nnumbers of health professionals or radiotherapy\r\nmachines to treat their cancer patients effectively.\r\nIndeed, some 15 African nations and several countries\r\nin Asia lack even one radiation therapy machine. The\r\nAgency has been working with key partners, such as\r\nthe World Health Organization, to provide training,\r\nexpert missions and equipment to support national and\r\nregional radiotherapy programmes, as well as projects\r\nin nuclear medicine, nutrition studies and many other\r\nhealth-related areas. A highly visible result of Agency\r\nsupport across Africa has been an increase of\r\napproximately 35 per cent over the past five years in\r\nthe number of cancer patients receiving treatment in\r\nparticipating countries of the African Regional\r\nCooperative Agreement — an increase of\r\napproximately 6,500 patients per year.\r\nIn the field water resources management, more\r\nthan one sixth of the world’s population lives in areas\r\nwithout adequate access to safe drinking water, a\r\nsituation that is expected to worsen significantly unless\r\nthe international community takes prompt and effective\r\naction. Isotope hydrology is being used in more than 80\r\nAgency projects to map underground aquifers, manage\r\nsurface water and groundwater, detect and control\r\npollution, and monitor dam leakage and safety. For\r\nexample, an ongoing regional isotope hydrology\r\nproject in Latin America has brought together more\r\nthan 30 water institutes to address water shortages,\r\nwith the successful completion of conceptual models\r\nfor a total of seven aquifers in Chile, Colombia, Costa\r\nRica, Ecuador and Peru.\r\nFor many years, the Agency has been working\r\nwith Member States on mutation breeding of major\r\nfood crops that yield very well in different ecological\r\nconditions. One example is the improvement in rice\r\nvarieties in the Asia and Pacific region. In a harvesting\r\nceremony in August, the Indonesian Government gave\r\nrecognition to the positive and sustained economic\r\nimpact of a variety of rice with higher yield and better\r\nquality, produced using gamma rays, which has\r\nsuccessfully been introduced in 20 Indonesian\r\nprovinces. We anticipate the release of at least seven\r\nnew varieties of rice in the region during the next three\r\nto five years.\r\nThe Agency’s technical cooperation programme\r\nprovides about $80 million of assistance per year and\r\ncontinues to be a principal mechanism for\r\nimplementing the Agency’s basic mission: “Atoms for\r\npeace”. The Secretariat continues to work on measures\r\nto ensure that technical cooperation projects such as\r\nthose I have just mentioned achieve lasting and\r\nconcrete benefits to recipient member States. Efforts\r\nare proceeding to improve the planning of national\r\ntechnical cooperation strategies through early and\r\ndirect dialogue with member States, to ensure strong\r\nGovernment commitment and to focus on fewer but\r\nhigher quality projects. We have expanded our\r\nmonitoring of the impact of technical cooperation\r\nprojects in order to increase project quality, relevance,\r\neffectiveness and sustainability, and we continue to\r\nbuild and expand partnerships with other international\r\norganizations and development partners with a view\r\ntowards leveraging the Agency’s limited resources,\r\nattracting greater attention to the benefits of nuclear\r\ntechnologies, and, in some cases, drawing on the\r\ntechnical expertise of other organizations to enhance\r\nthe impact of a nuclear technique.\r\nThe safety and security of nuclear activities\r\naround the globe remain a key factor for the future of\r\nnuclear technology. It is gratifying to note that nuclear\r\nsafety continues to improve at nuclear power plants\r\nworldwide, that more countries are raising their\r\nstandards of performance in radiation protection and\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\nthat significant steps have been taken in the past two\r\nyears to improve nuclear security.\r\nOne area that still needs improvement involves\r\nlearning from past experience. When events occur at\r\nnuclear facilities, it is essential that such operating\r\nexperiences — the lessons learned — be properly\r\ncommunicated to other relevant nuclear facilities and,\r\nas applicable, be incorporated into their operational\r\npractices. This remains an area of current focus.\r\nThe development and adoption of legally-binding\r\nnorms has proven to be a powerful mechanism for\r\nenhancing safety worldwide. The Conventions on Early\r\nNotification of a Nuclear Accident and Assistance in\r\nthe Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological\r\nEmergency continue to serve as mechanisms for\r\nAgency response missions to States parties during\r\nemergencies. The Agency is increasing its involvement\r\nin the Convention on Nuclear Safety by reporting, as\r\nrequested, on the trends and issues observed during our\r\nvarious safety missions, and the Joint Convention on\r\nthe Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the\r\nSafety of Radioactive Waste Management has now\r\nbeen in force for over two years. However, many States\r\nare not yet party to these conventions and certain key\r\nareas of the nuclear fuel cycle are still not subject to\r\nconventions.\r\nOne convention that has gained increased\r\nattention recently is the 1979 Convention on the\r\nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material. In the past\r\ntwo years, 20 additional States have become parties to\r\nthe Convention, reflecting the importance of the\r\ninternational nuclear security regime. States are now\r\nworking on a much-needed amendment to broaden the\r\nscope of the Convention, that I hope will be adopted\r\nsoon.\r\nI am also pleased to report good progress in the\r\ncontinuing revision and updating of international\r\nnuclear safety standards. Upgrades to all existing\r\nAgency standards should be completed by late next\r\nyear. Over the next three to four years, we hope to fill\r\nin the remaining gaps in coverage — such as safety\r\nstandards on geological waste repositories — and to\r\nimplement a more coherent structure for the body of\r\nIAEA standards. Those standards should be accepted\r\nand implemented worldwide as the global reference for\r\nnuclear and radiation safety.\r\nThe Agency’s safety review and appraisal\r\nservices assist member States in the application of\r\nIAEA safety standards and provide useful feedback on\r\ntheir effectiveness. These services originated\r\npredominantly in the field of nuclear installation safety,\r\nbut now extend to cover many areas of radiation,\r\nradioactive waste and transport safety as well. I should\r\nnote that, in particular, safety services and assistance to\r\ncountries of Central and Eastern Europe operating\r\npower reactors have been at the centre of the technical\r\ncooperation programmes of those countries for the past\r\ndecade, resulting in a broad and significant positive\r\nimpact on the operational safety of those facilities.\r\nDemand for Agency services continues to be very\r\nstrong. The Agency’s annual report for 2002 lists more\r\nthan 60 safety missions of various types to 29 States.\r\nCollectively, the results of the services constitute a\r\nsubstantial body of safety experience from around the\r\nworld.\r\nAgency efforts to help member States improve\r\ntheir protection against nuclear and radiological\r\nterrorism are continuing at an exceptionally fast pace\r\non multiple fronts. Since September 2001, working in\r\nEurope, Asia, Latin America and Africa, we have\r\nconducted nearly 40 advisory and evaluation missions\r\nand convened more than 50 training courses,\r\nworkshops and seminars. The IAEA also has\r\nstrengthened its cooperation on nuclear security issues\r\nwith other international organizations, including the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies, Interpol,\r\nEuropol, the Universal Postal Union and the European\r\nCommission.\r\nDespite the increased attention given to the\r\nsecurity of radioactive sources since 11 September\r\n2001, some deficiencies remain. Information in the\r\nAgency’s database of illicit trafficking, combined with\r\nreports of discoveries of plans for radiological\r\ndispersal devices — so-called dirty bombs — make it\r\nclear that a market continues to exist for obtaining and\r\nusing radioactive sources for malevolent purposes.\r\nAgency evaluation missions have been held throughout\r\nEastern Europe, Africa and Central America to assess\r\nmember States’ capabilities to detect nuclear and other\r\nradioactive material at their borders and to help them\r\nrespond to illicit trafficking. In the past year, IAEA\r\nmissions to a number of States have assisted in the\r\nrecovery, characterization and securing of radioactive\r\nsources seized in trafficking incidents. The Agency\r\nwill continue its efforts to improve source safety and\r\nsecurity.\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\nEvents of the past year have placed the nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation regime under stress on multiple fronts\r\nand have made it clear that concrete steps to strengthen\r\nthe regime are urgently required. The Agency’s role as\r\nan independent, objective verification body remains\r\ncentral to the effectiveness of the regime.\r\nThe IAEA’s verification activities are designed to\r\nprovide assurance that nuclear material and facilities\r\nare used exclusively for peaceful purposes. In the early\r\n1990s, after the discovery of the clandestine nuclear-\r\nweapons programme in Iraq, the international\r\ncommunity committed itself to providing the Agency\r\nwith the authority to strengthen its verification\r\ncapability — specifically, its ability to provide\r\nassurance not only that declared nuclear material has\r\nnot been diverted for non-peaceful purposes, but,\r\nequally important, that no undeclared nuclear material\r\nor activities exist.\r\nThis broader authority, however, is still far from\r\nuniversal. Regrettably, 46 States have yet to fulfil their\r\nlegal obligations under the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to bring\r\nsafeguards agreements with the Agency into force and,\r\nmore than six years after the IAEA Board’s approval of\r\nthe Model Additional Protocol, over 150 countries still\r\ndo not have an additional protocol in force. I strongly\r\nurge all States that have not done so to conclude and\r\nbring into force the required safeguards agreements and\r\nadditional protocols at an early date. As I have\r\nrepeatedly stated, if the Agency is to provide the\r\nrequired assurances, it must have the required\r\nauthority.\r\nThe situation in the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea continues to pose a serious and\r\nimmediate challenge to the nuclear non-proliferation\r\nregime. Since December 2002, the Agency has not\r\nperformed any verification activities in the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and cannot therefore\r\nprovide any level of assurance about the non-diversion\r\nof nuclear material. We have continued to emphasize\r\nthe need for a comprehensive settlement of the Korean\r\ncrisis through dialogue, and it is my hope that the six-\r\nparty talks will lead to such a settlement. I trust that\r\nany future settlement will ensure, inter alia, the return\r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to the\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime and that the Agency\r\nwill be given the necessary authority and resources to\r\nbe able to fulfil its responsibilities under the NPT in a\r\ncredible manner.\r\nAfter an interruption of nearly four years, last\r\nNovember the Agency resumed verification activities\r\nin Iraq under the mandate provided by Security Council\r\nresolution 687 (1991) and related resolutions. Between\r\nNovember 2002 and March 2003, the Agency sought to\r\ndetermine what, if anything, had changed in Iraq over\r\nthe previous four years relevant to Iraq’s nuclear\r\nactivities and capabilities. At the time the Agency\r\nceased its Security Council verification activities in\r\nIraq, we had found no evidence of the revival of\r\nnuclear activities prohibited under relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. However, considering our four-\r\nyear absence, the time available for the renewed\r\ninspections was not sufficient for the Agency to\r\ncomplete its overall review and assessment.\r\nThe Agency’s mandate in Iraq under various\r\nSecurity Council resolutions still stands. In May, the\r\nSecurity Council adopted resolution 1483 (2003) in\r\nwhich, inter alia, it expressed its intention to revisit the\r\nmandates of the IAEA and the United Nations\r\nMonitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission.\r\nWe are awaiting the results of that review and further\r\nguidance from the Council. Given the situation in Iraq,\r\nI believe it would be prudent for the United Nations\r\nand IAEA inspectors to return to Iraq, to bring the\r\nweapons file to a closure and, through implementation\r\nof a Security Council-approved plan for long-term\r\nmonitoring, to provide ongoing assurance that\r\nactivities related to weapons of mass destruction have\r\nnot been resumed. In the meantime, I trust that the\r\nAgency will be kept informed of the outcome of any\r\ncurrent inspection activities in Iraq relevant to our\r\nmandate, pursuant to Security Council resolution 1441\r\n(2002).\r\nPursuant to the mandate given to me by the IAEA\r\nGeneral Conference, I have continued to consult with\r\nthe States of the Middle East region on the application\r\nof full-scope safeguards to all nuclear activities in the\r\nMiddle East and on the development of model\r\nagreements relevant to the establishment of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free-zone in the region. I regret to report that,\r\ndue to the prevailing situation in the region, I have not\r\nbeen in a position to make any progress on the\r\nimplementation of this important mandate, which is of\r\ndirect relevance to non-proliferation and security in the\r\nMiddle East. With the active cooperation of all\r\nconcerned, I hope to move this mandate forward in the\r\ncoming year. It is essential, in my view, that a\r\ncomprehensive settlement in the Middle East be\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\naccompanied by a regional security structure that\r\nincludes the establishment of the Middle East as a zone\r\nfree from weapons of mass destruction. In my view, a\r\ndurable peace will not be attained without an adequate\r\nsecurity structure, which in turn is difficult to achieve\r\nwithout a peaceful settlement. The two must go hand in\r\nhand.\r\nThe Board of Governors this year has given\r\nconsiderable attention to the implementation of the\r\nNPT safeguards agreement in the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran. In September, the Board adopted a resolution\r\nurging Iran to show proactive and accelerated\r\ncooperation and to demonstrate full transparency by\r\nproviding the Agency with a declaration of all its\r\nnuclear activities. The Board made clear that it was\r\nessential and urgent for all outstanding issues to be\r\nbrought to closure as soon as possible in order to\r\nenable the Agency to provide the required assurances.\r\nRecently, we have received what the Iranian\r\nauthorities have said is a full and accurate declaration\r\nof Iran’s past and current nuclear activities and are in\r\nthe process of verifying that declaration. Iran has also\r\nexpressed its intention to conclude an additional\r\nprotocol to its safeguards agreement, which is key to\r\nour ability to provide comprehensive assurances. I will\r\nreport to the IAEA Board later this month on the status\r\nof our implementation of safeguards in Iran.\r\nLooking forward, it is clear that the Agency must\r\nhave the required authority, information and resources\r\nto be able to provide the international community with\r\nthe credible non-proliferation assurances required\r\nunder the NPT. In that context, the international\r\ncommunity must work hard to achieve the universality\r\nof the regime. We must also be more assertive in\r\nresolving the root causes of global insecurity — such\r\nas long-standing regional conflicts and other causes of\r\ninstability — which provide incentives for the\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of\r\nmass destruction. And we must work together to\r\ndevelop and establish a system of collective security\r\nthat does not depend on nuclear weapons and\r\naccelerate the process of nuclear disarmament.\r\nRecent events have made it clear that the non-\r\nproliferation regime is under growing stress. The\r\ncurrent world situation is different in many respects\r\nfrom that of the late 1960s, when the NPT was being\r\nnegotiated. A key difference is that information and\r\nexpertise on how to produce nuclear weapons has\r\nbecome much more accessible. This places extra\r\nemphasis on the importance of controlling access to\r\nweapon-usable nuclear material.\r\nIn light of the increasing threat of proliferation,\r\nboth by States and by terrorists, one idea that may now\r\nbe worth serious consideration is the advisability of\r\nlimiting the processing of weapon-usable material —\r\nthat is, separated plutonium and high enriched\r\nuranium — in civilian nuclear programmes, as well as\r\nthe production of new material through reprocessing\r\nand enrichment, by agreeing to restrict those operations\r\nexclusively to facilities under multinational control.\r\nSuch limitations would naturally need to be\r\naccompanied by appropriate rules of assurance of\r\nsupply for would-be users.\r\nWe should equally consider multinational\r\napproaches to the management and disposal of spent\r\nfuel and radioactive waste. Over 50 countries currently\r\nhave spent fuel stored in temporary locations, awaiting\r\nreprocessing or disposal. Not all countries have the\r\nappropriate geological conditions for such disposal\r\nand, for many countries with small nuclear\r\nprogrammes, the financial and human resources\r\nrequired for the construction and operation of a\r\ngeological disposal facility are simply daunting. Taken\r\ntogether, these proposals, in my view, would provide\r\nenhanced assurance to the international community that\r\nthe sensitive portions of civilian nuclear fuel-cycle\r\nprogrammes are not vulnerable to misuse.\r\nThe Agency continues to play a key role in\r\nensuring that the benefits of nuclear technology are\r\nshared globally for economic and social development,\r\nthat nuclear activities are conducted safely, that nuclear\r\nand radioactive materials and facilities are adequately\r\nprotected, and that a credible inspection regime exists\r\nto verify compliance with non-proliferation\r\ncommitments.\r\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\n“Atoms for peace” speech delivered before this body\r\nby President Eisenhower, in which he articulated a\r\nvision, shared by many world leaders, that would\r\nenable humanity to make full use of the benefits of\r\nnuclear energy while minimizing its risk. That vision\r\nled to the establishment of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency. Much has changed since that time and\r\nI believe it is appropriate for us to take stock of our\r\nsuccesses and failures and to resolve to pursue\r\nwhatever actions are required, including new ways of\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\nthinking and unconventional approaches, to ensure that\r\nnuclear energy remains a source of hope and prosperity\r\nand not a tool for self-destruction.\r\nLet me conclude by expressing my continuing\r\ngratitude to the Government of Austria, which has now\r\nserved for over four decades as a most gracious and\r\nwelcoming host to the IAEA.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I call\r\non the representative of Spain to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/58/L.10.\r\nMr. Nuñez García-Saúco (Spain) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): As the representative of Spain and Chairman\r\nof the Board of Governors of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), I am honoured to introduce\r\ndraft resolution A/58/L.10 on the annual report of the\r\nIAEA. The following countries, along with Spain, are\r\nsponsors of the text: Argentina, Australia, Austria,\r\nBelgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus,\r\nthe Czech Republic, Denmark, the Dominican\r\nRepublic, Ecuador, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France,\r\nGermany, Greece, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland,\r\nItaly, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Latvia, Lithuania,\r\nLuxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway,\r\nParaguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of\r\nKorea, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, South Africa,\r\nSweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Uganda, the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the\r\nUnited States of America.\r\nSince the document was first circulated, the\r\nfollowing have joined the list of sponsors: Albania,\r\nAndorra, Angola, Armenia, Belarus, Bolivia, Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, the Central African\r\nRepublic, Costa Rica, Guatemala, India, Kazakhstan,\r\nKenya, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, New Zealand,\r\nPakistan, the Philippines, the Republic of Moldova,\r\nSlovakia, Thailand, the Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia, Ukraine, Uruguay and Venezuela. I hope\r\nthat the new sponsors can be incorporated into the list\r\nbefore we adopt the draft resolution.\r\nI wish to thank the Director General of the IAEA,\r\nMr. ElBaradei, for the statement he has just made,\r\nwhich supplements the information contained in the\r\nannual report. All of this highlights the scope and\r\nimportance of the results achieved by the Agency over\r\nthe past year.\r\nThe draft resolution before the General Assembly\r\nthis year incorporates a significant change in format\r\nfrom that of earlier years. The change is due to an\r\nattempt to further rationalize our work and that of our\r\ncolleagues in Vienna, while preserving the essence of\r\nthe message which the General Assembly’s adoption of\r\nthe draft resolution sends to the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe are all aware that, since 1990, the year in\r\nwhich the General Assembly adopted the last of the so-\r\ncalled procedural resolutions on the IAEA, the length\r\nof such resolutions has undergone rapid and\r\nunnecessary growth. The expansion reflected the\r\nunderstandable concern of some Members to highlight\r\nin the resolution those aspects of the Agency’s work\r\nthat were of the greatest importance to them. The\r\ngreater length of the text was inevitably accompanied\r\nby a lengthier and more difficult drafting process,\r\nfrequently including the discussion of issues that had\r\nalready been negotiated and decided upon at the IAEA\r\nGeneral Conference.\r\nGiven those developments, and so as to enhance\r\nthe efficiency of our efforts, we have decided this year\r\nto introduce a draft resolution that strikes a middle\r\nground between the procedural resolutions of the past\r\nand the substantive appeal of recent years. By\r\ncomparison with last year, we shall have a markedly\r\nshorter resolution — perhaps well less than half as\r\nlong — which nonetheless retains the essential of the\r\nsubstance.\r\nIn any event, the draft resolution and the annual\r\nreport together provide sufficient information to give\r\nan overall picture of the recent work of the Agency and\r\nto give a detailed account of activities in areas of\r\nspecific interest. So as to focus the attention of the\r\nAssembly on the most significant activities of the\r\nAgency, the draft resolution does not refer to\r\nresolutions and decisions adopted at the most recent\r\nIAEA General Conference related to budgetary or\r\nprocedural issues. This means that, of the 22\r\nresolutions and 5 decisions adopted, only 14\r\nsubstantive resolutions and 3 substantive decisions are\r\nmentioned. By paragraph 2 of the draft resolution, the\r\nGeneral Assembly would take note of each of those\r\nresolutions and decisions, which, with the exceptions\r\nthat I shall describe shortly, relate to one of the three\r\npillars of the Agency’s activities: nuclear safety,\r\ntechnology transfer and verification of peaceful use.\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\nSpecifically, in the area of nuclear safety, which\r\nincludes protection from nuclear terrorism, four IAEA\r\nresolutions were adopted: a resolution on cooperation\r\nin radiological material, transport and waste\r\nmanagement (GC(47)/RES/7A); a resolution on the\r\ncode of conduct on radioactive sources\r\n(GC(47)/RES/7B); a resolution on transport safety\r\n(GC(47)/RES/7C); and a resolution on progress on\r\nmeasures to protect against nuclear and radiological\r\nterrorism (GC(47)/RES/8).\r\nIn the area of technology transfer, six resolutions\r\nwere adopted: on strengthening of the Agency’s\r\ntechnical cooperation activities (GC(47)/RES/9); on\r\nstrengthening the Agency’s activities related to nuclear\r\nscience, technology and applications\r\n(GC(47)/RES/10A); on nuclear knowledge\r\n(GC(47)/RES/10B); on the development of innovative\r\nnuclear technology (GC(47)/RES/10C); on the use of\r\nisotope hydrology for water resources management\r\n(GC(47)/RES/10D); and on a plan for producing\r\npotable water economically using small and medium-\r\nsized nuclear reactors (GC(47)/RES/10E).\r\nIn the area of verification, three resolutions were\r\nadopted: on strengthening the effectiveness and\r\nimproving the efficiency of the safeguards system and\r\napplication of the Model Additional Protocol\r\n(GC(47)/RES/11); on the implementation of the\r\nAgreement between the Agency and the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea for the application of\r\nsafeguards in connection with the Non-Proliferation\r\nTreaty (GC(47)/RES/12); and on the application of\r\nAgency safeguards in the Middle East\r\n(GC(47)/RES/13).\r\nAdditionally, there were two presidential\r\nstatements: one on the implementation of United\r\nNations Security Council resolutions relating to Iraq\r\n(GC(47)/DEC/12); and another on Israeli nuclear\r\ncapabilities and threat (GC(47)/DEC/13).\r\nAs I indicated earlier, the draft resolution that we\r\nare introducing before the General Assembly also\r\nmentions two resolutions and a decision that are not\r\nsubstantive in nature, but which refer to topical issues:\r\nresolutions GC(47)/RES/14A and B on staffing of the\r\nAgency’s secretariat and on women in the secretariat,\r\nrespectively, as well as the General Conference\r\ndecision amending article VI of the Agency’s statute\r\n(GC(47)/DEC/14).\r\nAs a final comment, I would like to note that all\r\nthe resolutions and decisions adopted at the most recent\r\nGeneral Conference were a result of the constructive\r\nclimate of dialogue that prevails in IAEA, and were\r\nadopted by consensus.\r\nIt only remains for me to thank Member States\r\nfor the broad support that this new approach and\r\nparticularly the text of draft resolution A/58/L.10 have\r\nreceived over the course of the informal consultations\r\nthat I chaired in Vienna, which resulted in broad and\r\nsolid consensus. The consultations I have been holding\r\nover the past week in New York have also revealed\r\nwidespread support for the initiative. At the time, I\r\nasked States present in the consultations not to reopen\r\nissues already negotiated and agreed upon in Vienna.\r\nAt this stage, I would like to repeat that appeal to all\r\nStates, and to express my confidence that draft\r\nresolution A/58/L.10 will be adopted by a broad\r\nmajority and, if possible, by consensus.\r\nMr. Trezza (Italy): I have the honour to speak on\r\nbehalf of the European Union (EU). The acceding\r\ncountries Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia\r\nand Slovenia, the associated countries Bulgaria,\r\nRomania and Turkey and the European Free Trade\r\nAssociation countries that are members of the\r\nEuropean Economic Area Iceland and Norway align\r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nFirst of all, I would like to thank Mr. Mohamed\r\nElBaradei, Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his statement on\r\nthe Agency’s 2002 report and for providing the General\r\nAssembly with additional information on the main\r\ndevelopments in IAEA activities during 2003. The\r\nEuropean Union commends the secretariat of the IAEA\r\nand its Director General for the excellent work done by\r\nthe Agency and for the importance of the results\r\nachieved last year.\r\nThe States members of the European Union,\r\nwhich were among the most active participants in the\r\nforty-seventh IAEA General Conference, held in\r\nVienna from 15 to 19 September 2003, welcome the\r\noutcome of the Conference and the 15 resolutions and\r\n5 decisions that were adopted there.\r\nThe European Union member States and acceding\r\ncountries are all sponsoring the draft resolution on the\r\nreport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(A/58/L.10) and fully support its content. They also\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\nwish to thank the Chairman of the Board of Governors\r\nof the IAEA, Ambassador Núñez García-Saúco, for his\r\npresentation. The draft resolution reflects broad\r\nagreement among IAEA member States and is the\r\nresult of intense consultations in Vienna. We commend\r\nthe Chairman of the IAEA Board of Governors for his\r\nefforts and hope that the present draft resolution will be\r\nadopted by consensus.\r\nAt the European Council held in Thessaloniki in\r\nJune this year, the heads of State or Government of the\r\nEU reiterated their commitment to counter the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and to\r\nthe objective of deterring, halting and, where possible,\r\nreversing the expansion of proliferation programmes\r\nworldwide. The European Union believes that a nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation regime of universal character,\r\nsupported by a strong system of international\r\nsafeguards, is an essential prerequisite for collective\r\nsecurity. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) is the cornerstone of this\r\nglobal non-proliferation regime, and the IAEA\r\nsafeguards system is its essential international\r\ninstrument. The Union is fully committed to the NPT\r\nand will continue its efforts to maintain the authority\r\nand integrity of the Treaty.\r\nThe universal adoption and implementation of\r\nsafeguards agreements and additional protocols to them\r\nis definitely the key to an effective and credible\r\nsafeguards system. The EU considers that the IAEA\r\ncomprehensive safeguards, including the additional\r\nprotocols, constitute the verification standard. The\r\nmeasures contained in the additional protocols are\r\nespecially crucial to strengthening the IAEA’s ability to\r\ndetect possible undeclared nuclear material and\r\nactivities and to provide assurances about the absence\r\nof such activities.\r\nThe European Union wishes to recall its concern\r\nregarding the continued existence of unsafeguarded\r\nnuclear facilities and material in States not parties to\r\nthe NPT. The EU calls upon those States to accede to\r\nthe NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States and to place all\r\ntheir nuclear activities under IAEA safeguards.\r\nThe fight against terrorism and the proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction represents a challenge\r\nof paramount importance for the international\r\ncommunity. The European Union member States\r\nstrongly support all measures aimed at preventing\r\nterrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons. While the\r\nprimary responsibility for the necessary nuclear\r\nsecurity rests with member States, the Agency clearly\r\nhas an essential role to play in combating nuclear\r\nterror. After 11 September 2001, the IAEA moved\r\nrapidly to reorient and reinforce its activities relevant\r\nto protections against nuclear terrorism. We support the\r\nwork of the IAEA in this field and we welcome\r\ncontributions provided by member countries to the\r\nNuclear Security Fund.\r\nThe IAEA General Conference approved its\r\nprogramme and budget for 2004-2005. The European\r\nUnion is well aware of the difficult context in which\r\nthe Agency has to finance its statutory obligations\r\nunder its regular budget. It was in fact mainly due to\r\nthe unavoidable and exceptional future needs of the\r\nIAEA’s verification activities that the EU member\r\ncountries were able to accept the compromise package\r\nthat led to the substantial increase in the budget for\r\n2004-2005.\r\nThe European Union fully supports the IAEA\r\nDirector General in his continued efforts to improve\r\nthe effectiveness of the Agency. A results-based\r\napproach to budgeting requires strong management and\r\na clear definition of cross-cutting activities. Enhanced\r\ncooperation and coordination between departments\r\nshould be encouraged, leading to greater synergy and\r\nthe better use of resources — human as well as\r\nfinancial.\r\nNuclear safety is an ongoing concern of the\r\ninternational community, and its continuous\r\nimprovement is the goal of all IAEA member States.\r\nThe responsibilities of the States engaged in nuclear\r\nactivity with respect to their own population, their\r\nneighbours and the international community cannot be\r\noveremphasized. The European Union member States\r\nand acceding countries closely cooperate to maintain a\r\nhigh level of nuclear safety in the Union, including\r\nduring the decommissioning of nuclear installations\r\nand the management of radioactive wastes.\r\nTechnical cooperation, together with international\r\nsafeguards and nuclear safety, are the three pillars of\r\nthe Agency’s activities. The European Union has\r\nalways played an instrumental role in the IAEA’s\r\ntechnical cooperation and development. The level of\r\nvoluntary contributions provided by EU member States\r\nto the Technical Cooperation Fund in 2003 will, in fact,\r\namount to well over 35 per cent of total contributions.\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\nThe European Union supported the decision\r\nreached at the General Conference on technical\r\ncooperation funding for the near future. On this matter,\r\nthe Union wishes to underline that the funds must be\r\nused in the most cost-effective, efficient and\r\ntransparent way.\r\nThe IAEA’s indispensable role as the competent\r\nauthority for the verification of compliance with the\r\nsafeguards agreements covering the non-proliferation\r\nof nuclear weapons has proved to be worthy of the\r\ninternational community’s trust. The Agency also plays\r\nan essential role in promoting the safe usage of nuclear\r\ntechnology for peaceful applications in those member\r\nStates which use that technology. Finally, the IAEA,\r\nthrough its technical cooperation programmes,\r\ncontributes to the achievement of tangible social and\r\neconomic benefits and to the scientific advancement of\r\nmember States.\r\nThe most recent European Council meeting\r\nreiterated its grave concern about Iran’s nuclear\r\nprogramme and gave its full support to the IAEA\r\nBoard of Governors’ resolution of 12 September. The\r\nEuropean Union expects Iran to cooperate fully with\r\nthe IAEA in its implementation and welcomes the\r\nresult of the talks held in Tehran on 21 October,\r\naccording to which Iran will sign and continue to apply\r\nthe Additional Protocol, allowing unrestricted access to\r\ninspectors and voluntarily suspend all uranium\r\nenrichment and reprocessing activities. The EU\r\nbelieves that the full implementation of Iran’s decisions\r\nwill open the way to dialogue on the basis of longer-\r\nterm cooperation, which will provide all parties with\r\nsatisfactory assurances relating to Iran’s nuclear-\r\npower-generation programme. The full resolution of\r\ninternational concerns would create conditions for\r\ndeveloping cooperation with Iran in a range of areas.\r\nThe European Union is alarmed about the fact\r\nthat it has still not been possible for the IAEA to verify\r\nthe degree of completeness and correctness of the\r\ninitial report by the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea of its nuclear materials. The European Union\r\ncommends the Agency for its efforts since last\r\nSeptember, and supports efforts by the Director\r\nGeneral to seek dialogue with the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea in order to find a solution for the\r\nimplementation of safeguards. Furthermore, since\r\nDecember 2002 the IAEA has been unable to confirm\r\nthe non-diversion of nuclear material to non-peaceful\r\nuses. The EU notes that the IAEA Board of Governors\r\nhas reported to the Security Council on further non-\r\ncompliance by the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea with its safeguards agreement.\r\nThe European Union supports the continuation of\r\nthe dialogue among all interested parties. For that\r\nreason it welcomes the two meetings held in Beijing\r\nwith a view to finding a possible negotiated solution to\r\nthe question, and encourages all the parties involved in\r\nthose meetings to pursue negotiations actively and in\r\ngood faith. We strongly urge the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea to come unconditionally into full\r\ncompliance with all of its relevant international\r\ncommitments, in particular its IAEA safeguards\r\nagreement under the NPT.\r\nThe European Union commends the work done by\r\nthe IAEA in Iraq since last year’s General Conference.\r\nThe EU supports all efforts made by the IAEA to\r\ncontinue to verify the nuclear material in Iraq, and\r\nwelcomes the IAEA’s mission, which focused on\r\nverification of the material subject to safeguards in\r\nTuwaitha, where looting had reportedly taken place.\r\nAlthough the Agency’s mandate in Iraq under various\r\nSecurity Council resolutions still stands, the Council\r\nstated in resolution 1483 (2003) that it will revisit that\r\nmandate. The EU looks forward to such a review.\r\nNonetheless, the Union wishes to recall that,\r\nirrespective of the mandate under Security Council\r\nresolutions, the Agency has the continuing obligation,\r\nunder Iraq’s NPT safeguards agreement, to ensure the\r\nnon-diversion of nuclear material declared and placed\r\nunder its safeguards in Iraq.\r\nThe European Union and the acceding countries\r\nreiterate their full support for the Agency and their\r\ncommitment to the full realization of its statutory\r\nfunctions and renew the appeal for the prompt and\r\nunanimous adoption of the draft resolution under\r\nconsideration.\r\nMr. De Rivero (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nreport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA) tells us that the greatest challenges currently\r\nfacing the Agency relate to strengthening safeguards\r\nand ensuring the effectiveness of the non-proliferation\r\nregime. We are therefore concerned about the fact that\r\nthe report also states that progress in establishing a\r\nsafeguards system is continuing to be discouragingly\r\nslow, in particular as concerns the number of States\r\nwith additional protocols in force. The situation is\r\ncompounded by the nuclear situation on the Korean\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.52\r\npeninsula, which can jeopardize international stability.\r\nWe hope that the diplomatic consultations under way\r\ncan turn that dangerous situation around. In light of the\r\nlack of progress on the safeguards issue, we appeal\r\nonce again to all States to sign and implement\r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreements and additional\r\nprotocols and to comply strictly and transparently with\r\nthe recommendations that the Agency makes in that\r\nregard.\r\nWith respect to the challenge of non-proliferation,\r\ntoday we wish to announce that, with Cuba’s\r\nratification of the Treaty of Tlatelolco and the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT),\r\nas well as its decision to conclude a safeguards\r\nagreement and an additional protocol, Latin America\r\nhas consolidated its status as the first nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zone in the world. However, the exemplary\r\nsituation in Latin America is the exception to the rule\r\ntoday in terms of non-proliferation.\r\nSince the 1960s, my country has participated\r\nactively in creating and strengthening the NPT. Indeed,\r\nI myself was President of one of the NPT Review\r\nConferences. However, today, in the light of that\r\nexperience, we believe that the existing non-\r\nproliferation regime is being overwhelmed by the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. We must\r\nacknowledge today that it is increasingly clear that the\r\nnuclear-non-proliferation regime of the past century is\r\nfailing. The temporary asymmetry accepted in the\r\n1960s between NPT nuclear and non-nuclear-weapon\r\nStates has been perpetuated because nuclear\r\ndisarmament has not been carried out in keeping with\r\nthe requirements of the NPT. Moreover, there has been\r\na proliferation of more nuclear States; today we can\r\ncount perhaps nine such States.\r\nControlling access to nuclear-weapons\r\ntechnology has become increasingly difficult. Almost\r\nall nuclear technological development today is of dual\r\nuse. It may be peaceful and military at the same time.\r\nToday one can easily find available literature with\r\nformulas for the manufacture of explosive nuclear\r\ndevices. Today we also have nuclear scientists who are\r\nunemployed or poorly employed, who can offer their\r\nservices not only to States that aspire to become\r\nnuclear States, but also to terrorist groups.\r\nGiven these new challenges, we believe that the\r\ntime has come to envisage a new international non-\r\nproliferation regime which would limit the processing\r\nof weapon-usable nuclear material in civilian nuclear\r\nprogrammes, control the production of new nuclear\r\nmaterial by enrichment, administer the disposal of fuel\r\nand radioactive waste and, finally, ban the production\r\nof fissile material for military use with a view to\r\nbeginning the reduction of nuclear weapons.\r\nWe need to be realistic and reduce nuclear-\r\nweapon stocks, because these weapons fulfil no\r\nstrategic function in the face of the challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century. What can nuclear weapons do to\r\ncounter terrorism, except encourage their own\r\nproliferation? What can nuclear weapons do about civil\r\nwars of national disintegration that are ravaging the\r\nworld? What can they do about financial crises or\r\ntrafficking in drugs, persons and small arms? What can\r\nthey do against global pollution, poverty and major\r\nhuman migrations?\r\nI have the impression that the globalization of\r\nhuman contacts in the twenty-first century will change\r\nour perception about the relevance of nuclear weapons.\r\nThe development of air transport and digital\r\ntelecommunications will produce increasing\r\nconnectivity among individuals, among non-State\r\nentities and among cultures, giving rise to the\r\nperception that we are a single human civilization with\r\ndiverse cultures. This new perception will prevail over\r\nthe obsolete, ethnocentric and nationalistic perception\r\nof the past century, which was the basis of State and\r\nideological rivalries and nuclear deterrence.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
