Hunte. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 14 (continued)\r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nreport of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (A/58/312)\r\nDraft resolution (A/58/L.10)\r\nMr. Zarif (Islamic Republic of Iran): Allow me,\r\nat the outset, to express our gratitude to Mr. Mohamed\r\nElBaradei, for his tireless efforts and for his report to\r\nthe General Assembly, in which he has provided\r\nadditional information on the main developments in the\r\nactivities of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA) during 2002.\r\nThe objectives of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency, as set out in article II of its statute,\r\ninclude the Agency’s seeking to\r\n“accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic\r\nenergy to peace, health and prosperity throughout\r\nthe world.”\r\nThat objective emanates from an important pillar\r\nof the non-proliferation regime enshrined in legally\r\nbinding provisions of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In accordance\r\nwith article IV of the Treaty, States parties undertook\r\nto facilitate the fullest possible exchange of equipment,\r\nmaterials and scientific and technological information\r\nfor the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Indeed, the\r\ninalienable right of all States parties to nuclear\r\ntechnology for peaceful purposes without\r\ndiscrimination constitutes the very foundation of the\r\nTreaty.\r\nThis inalienable right in itself emanates from two\r\nbroader propositions. First, scientific and technological\r\nachievements are a common heritage of mankind. They\r\nmust be used for the improvement of the human\r\ncondition and not abused as instruments of terror and\r\ndomination. The IAEA, in its resolution\r\nGC(43)RES/14 of 1 October 1999, has recognized that\r\n“many countries consider nuclear power, being a\r\nclimatically benign source of energy, to be an eligible\r\noption under the Clean Development Mechanism of the\r\nKyoto Protocol.” In this context, the IAEA General\r\nConference requested the Director General to pursue\r\nefforts to strengthen the technical cooperation activities\r\nof the Agency aimed at improving the scientific,\r\ntechnological and regulatory capabilities of developing\r\ncountries and by continuing to assist them in first, the\r\npeaceful applications of atomic energy and nuclear\r\ntechniques in the fields of inter alia food and\r\nagriculture, human health, industry, water resource\r\nmanagement, and environment; and secondly, in\r\nnuclear energy production for those States pursuing it\r\nas a component of their energy mix in the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.53\r\nMy delegation welcomes the report of the\r\nDirector-General in which he has outlined the activities\r\nof the Agency in these important areas.\r\nThe second general proposition is the requisite\r\nbalance between rights and obligations, which is the\r\nbasis of any sound legal instrument. This balance\r\nguarantees the longevity of the legal regime by\r\nproviding incentives for membership and compliance.\r\nThe provisions of the NPT and IAEA Statute on the\r\nright to nuclear technology and the imperative of\r\ncooperation and sharing of the technology among those\r\nwho have accepted the obligations of non-proliferation\r\ntestify to the wisdom and understanding of the drafters.\r\nHowever, in practice, we must guard against further\r\nentrenchment of the impression that membership in the\r\nNPT and the IAEA safeguard regime in fact constitutes\r\nan impediment to peaceful use, while non-membership\r\nis rewarded by acquiescence, as in the case of the\r\ndevelopment of one of the largest stockpiles of nuclear\r\nweapons in the Middle East. If anything, failure to\r\naccept the NPT and the safeguard obligations of IAEA\r\nshould have made the only outsider to the NPT in the\r\nMiddle East the subject of most severe restrictions and\r\nnot provide it with impunity.\r\nThe international community as whole has a right\r\nto be assured that the nightmare visited upon the\r\npeople of Hiroshima and Nagasaki will never happen\r\nagain. The only guarantee of this, obviously, is the total\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons, as stipulated by the\r\nNPT and the advisory opinion of the International\r\nCourt of Justice. But as an interim measure, the\r\ninternational community must take all necessary steps\r\nto ensure the universality of the non-proliferation\r\nregime and the IAEA safeguard mechanisms. The\r\nIAEA can play a decisive role through vigorously\r\npursuing a balanced and non-discriminatory application\r\nof the provisions of the NPT and IAEA safeguards.\r\nYet it must be emphasized that arbitrary and often\r\npolitically motivated limitations and restrictions will\r\nonly impede the ability of the IAEA to conduct its\r\nverification responsibilities in an orderly fashion. The\r\nlogic is simple: such restrictions will not lead to the\r\ntargets’ abandoning of their inalienable right to nuclear\r\ntechnology and accepting marginalization in this\r\nimportant field of human achievement. In all\r\nlikelihood, it will lead, as it has, to acquisition of the\r\nsame peaceful technology from unofficial channels and\r\nin a less than fully transparent fashion, thus\r\nexacerbating mutual suspicions and mistrust.\r\nLike all other members of the NPT, Iran considers\r\nthe pursuit and development of nuclear technology for\r\npeaceful purposes to be its inalienable right, and has\r\nthus invested extensive human and material resources\r\nin the field. At the same time, as repeatedly stated,\r\nnuclear and other weapons of mass destruction have no\r\nplace in Iran’s defence doctrine, not only because of\r\nour commitment to our contractual obligations under\r\nthe NPT and other relevant conventions, but in fact\r\nbecause of a sober strategic calculation.\r\nYet, illegitimate sanctions have targeted not only\r\nIran’s legitimate nuclear programme but in fact the\r\nentire industry and all possible sources of supply of\r\nmaterial and equipment. What Iran has been able to\r\nachieve is primarily the result of the intellect and hard\r\nwork of Iranian scientists. Regrettably, a politically\r\ncharged atmosphere of concern was orchestrated\r\nconcerning this limited peaceful capability, an\r\natmosphere that has little to do with the objectives of\r\nnon-proliferation.\r\nFollowing consultations with the Director\r\nGeneral of the IAEA and the Foreign Ministers of\r\nBritain, France and Germany, possibilities for a\r\ndifferent approach emerged, an approach in which\r\nIran’s right to peaceful use was recognized and future\r\ncooperation in the area of material and technology\r\nthrough confidence-building and transparency\r\npromised to replace the past practice of limitations and\r\ndenials.\r\nIran therefore decided to take yet other measures\r\nin order to remove any doubts about its intentions and\r\nto set the stage for mutual confidence and cooperation.\r\nOn 23 October, we provided a full and consistent\r\npicture of Iran’s activities in the past, which will\r\ncertainly enable the Agency to verify not only that all\r\nIranian activities are exclusively in the peaceful\r\ndomain, in compliance with the NPT, but also that\r\nnecessary corrective measures have additionally been\r\ntaken in order to meet every technical requirement of\r\nthe safeguard system. This will enable us to put the\r\npast behind us, to put to rest all the concerns,\r\nmisplaced as they may have been from the beginning,\r\nfrom our perspective.\r\nAs further confidence-building measures for the\r\npresent, Iran has voluntarily decided to suspend\r\nuranium enrichment activities, sign the Additional\r\nProtocol and continue to cooperate with the IAEA in\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.53\r\naccordance with the Protocol, pending its ratification,\r\nwhich will have to be done by the Iranian parliament.\r\nWe continue in this trend and are pleased to see\r\nthat this process has begun to bear fruitful results. We\r\nexpect that, as we proceed on this track, reciprocal\r\nsatisfaction of commitments in good faith will open yet\r\nfurther horizons for confidence and cooperation.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nwish to express the Egyptian delegation’s appreciation\r\nfor the statement of Mr. ElBaradei, Director General of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The\r\nstatement highlighted the Agency’s distinguished\r\ncontribution to main activities during 2001-2002 and\r\ninformed us of major future challenges that we must be\r\nprepared to face.\r\nWhile Egypt recognizes the Agency’s tangible\r\ncontribution to the system of safeguards and\r\nverification and to enhancing sustainable development\r\nactivities through the transfer of technology, know-how\r\nand technical cooperation, we also wish to commend\r\nthe effort made during the past two years to update and\r\ndevelop a technical cooperation strategy to serve the\r\ndevelopmental priorities of member States and to\r\ndefine vital activities, to which the Agency will\r\ncontribute concretely in the near future. Hence, the\r\nimportance of achieving stability and certainty in\r\nfinancing the Agency’s activities in the fields of\r\ntechnical cooperation and technology transfer, as those\r\nactivities are among the pillars of the organization’s\r\nwork, inasmuch as they contribute directly to\r\nenhancing the well-being of peoples, particularly in the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nOn that basis, Egypt has participated in and\r\ncontributed to achieving consensus on the Agency’s\r\nprogramme budget for the 2004-2005 biennium\r\nbecause we are convinced of the need to realize a real\r\nincrease in budget resources in a way that will ensure\r\nthat the Agency’s secretariat can carry out its\r\nresponsibilities, as stipulated by its Statute, particularly\r\nin the field of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and\r\nin enhancing the regime of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). At the same\r\ntime, we are conscious of the need to strike a balance\r\nbetween the various activities of the Agency,\r\nparticularly those related to safeguards and technical\r\ncooperation and the need to ensure that the resources\r\nfor technical cooperation will be sufficiently stable and\r\npredictable.\r\nUndoubtedly, increasing the Agency’s budget by\r\nup to 6 per cent would reflect member States’\r\nappreciation for the importance of its work and\r\nactivities in the area of nuclear non-proliferation and\r\nnuclear technology transfer for peaceful uses and for\r\nthe realization of the goals of sustainable development.\r\nWith regard to verification and safeguards\r\nactivities, we take note of the efforts made by the\r\nIAEA secretariat to complete the conceptual\r\nframework of integrated safeguards. At the same time,\r\nwe reaffirm that the effectiveness of safeguards will\r\nnot be achieved unless we attain universal application\r\nof comprehensive safeguards. We take this opportunity\r\nto reiterate once again that, without continuing efforts\r\nto realize universal application of the Agency’s\r\ncomprehensive safeguards, any efforts to enhance the\r\nsafeguards regime will not yield results in terms of\r\neliminating threats of nuclear proliferation.\r\nComprehensive safeguards constitute the major pillar\r\nof the nuclear non-proliferation regime and it is\r\ntherefore important to work to achieve their universal\r\napplication.\r\nEgypt has put forward a number of initiatives at\r\nthe regional and international levels to face threats\r\nstemming from nuclear proliferation. For more than a\r\nquarter of a century we have called for the\r\nestablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the\r\nMiddle East. President Hosni Mubarak has also called\r\nfor the establishment of a zone free of all weapons of\r\nmass destruction in the Middle East. Egypt, through the\r\nIAEA, calls for the implementation of the Agency’s\r\ncomprehensive safeguards on nuclear installations in\r\nthe Middle East region, without discrimination.\r\nDespite all the initiatives to achieve security and\r\nstability in the countries of the region, Israel, one of\r\nthe countries of the region, has shown no desire to\r\ninteract seriously to deal with the threat of nuclear\r\nproliferation in the Middle East. It continues to refuse\r\nto make progress in applying the comprehensive\r\nsafeguards of the Agency to all its nuclear installations.\r\nThis affects adversely efforts aimed at confronting the\r\nnuclear non-proliferation issue in general, and in the\r\nMiddle East in particular.\r\nThis situation imposes a double responsibility on\r\nthe international community to eradicate and eliminate\r\nall threats to international peace and security stemming\r\nfrom nuclear proliferation, and to endeavour to\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.53\r\nimplement the Agency’s comprehensive safeguards in\r\nthe entire Middle East region.\r\nWith regard to nuclear security, the events of 11\r\nSeptember 2001 have underscored the dire need to\r\nenhance and strengthen the Agency’s activities and\r\nprogrammes to protect nuclear material and\r\ninstallations and other radioactive material from the\r\nthreat of nuclear terrorism. Egypt considers that, as\r\nlong as nuclear material not subject to any international\r\nmonitoring or verification controls exists, then the\r\nthreats and risks of such materials falling into the\r\nhands of terrorists will continue to exist.\r\nEgypt has participated effectively in the Agency’s\r\nefforts to develop a perception concerning proposed\r\nadditional activities and measures to protect against\r\nnuclear terrorism. Egypt considers that an ideal\r\nimplementation of the Agency’s proposed activities\r\nmust include a number of basic criteria, including that\r\nsuch activities not be a substitute for national measures\r\nand that they not lessen the responsibility of countries\r\nin dealing with security-related matters. Another\r\ncriterion is that the activities should be financed\r\nthrough a voluntary mechanism. In that context, Egypt\r\nhopes that proposed additional measures and activities\r\nin this area will supplement technical cooperation\r\nprogrammes and activities without detracting from\r\nthem.\r\nWe call for the experts’ panel established by the\r\nIAEA Director General to carry out and complete its\r\nwork as quickly as possible.\r\nWe reaffirm once again that our position on the\r\nproduction of fissile material is based on the fact that\r\nall nuclear material, including stockpiles, should be\r\nsubjected to the safeguards and verification regime,\r\nwhich must be in keeping with the objectives of any\r\nconvention concluded in this regard.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to confirm that Egypt\r\nwill always support the activities of the IAEA and will\r\nstrengthen its capabilities to face future challenges in\r\nthis context. We thank once again Mr. ElBaradei,\r\nDirector General of the IAEA, for all his efforts\r\ntowards realizing the purposes and principles of the\r\nAgency.\r\nMr. Kim Sam-hoon (Republic of Korea): My\r\ndelegation also thanks Mr. ElBaradei, Director General\r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),\r\nfor his informative report on IAEA activities. We also\r\ncommend the Director General and his staff for the\r\ndedication and professionalism with which they\r\ncontinue to carry out their responsibilities.\r\nThe Republic of Korea attaches the utmost\r\nimportance to the work of the Agency and actively\r\nparticipates in all areas of its activities. The Agency’s\r\nrole in verifying the non-proliferation commitments of\r\nStates parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and other bilateral and\r\nregional non-proliferation arrangements is instrumental\r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe past year has been a time of unprecedented\r\nchallenges for the global nuclear non-proliferation\r\nregime based on NPT. Accordingly, it has been a trying\r\nyear for the IAEA. The Agency’s ability to perform its\r\nduties as the guardian of the non-proliferation regime\r\nhas been sorely tested. North Korea and Iran present\r\nthe most pressing proliferation concerns for the\r\ninternational community today. We believe that the\r\nAgency has thus far dealt with these two cases in a\r\nmost appropriate and professional manner. However,\r\nthere is still a long way to go, if the spectre of\r\nproliferation on these two fronts is to be eliminated\r\nonce and for all. How these concerns are resolved will\r\nhave a decisive bearing on the future of the nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation regime, as well as the broader\r\ninternational security landscape.\r\nWith respect to the North Korean nuclear issue,\r\nwe believe that resolution GC(47)/RES/12 adopted by\r\nthe forty-seventh regular session of the IAEA General\r\nConference last September, conveys the clear message\r\nof the international community. We reiterate our\r\nposition that Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons programme\r\ncannot be tolerated under any circumstances and that\r\nthere is no substitute for North Korea’s complete,\r\nirreversible and verifiable dismantling of its nuclear\r\nweapons programme. The Republic of Korea is\r\ncommitted to a diplomatic and peaceful resolution of\r\nthe issue through the Six-Party Talks. We look forward\r\nto an early resumption of and smooth progress in the\r\nTalks.\r\nTurning to Iran’s nuclear issue, we welcome\r\nIran’s recent decision to cooperate with the IAEA and\r\nits intention to sign the Additional Protocol as a\r\nsignificant step in the right direction. We also take\r\npositive note of Iran’s decision to voluntarily suspend\r\nall uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities. In\r\nour view, regaining the confidence of the international\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.53\r\ncommunity in Iran’s sincere commitment to non-\r\nproliferation is central to the resolution of all\r\noutstanding concerns about Iran’s nuclear programme.\r\nHowever, this may take more than Iran’s technical\r\ncompliance with its legal obligations under NPT and\r\nthe safeguards agreement.\r\nNuclear terrorism is another challenge that\r\nrequires the resolute and coordinated response of the\r\ninternational community. We support a comprehensive\r\nnuclear security approach with a view to preventing\r\nnuclear and other radioactive materials from falling\r\ninto the wrong hands. We recognize the Agency’s\r\ncentral role in coordinating international efforts to\r\ncombat nuclear terrorism, and we appreciate its\r\ncontributions to providing training, advisory services\r\nand databases in the area of nuclear security. My\r\nGovernment looks forward to a timely conclusion of\r\nthe amendment to the Convention on the Physical\r\nProtection of Nuclear Material under the auspices of\r\nthe IAEA.\r\nThe recent challenges to the global non-\r\nproliferation regime have demonstrated the inherent\r\nlimitations of the existing regime and the inadequacies\r\nof legalistic approaches alone in dealing with\r\ndetermined proliferators. The Agency should be better\r\nequipped with both the resources and the strengthened\r\nmandate necessary to deal with challenges from\r\nmultiple sources. To this end, we attach great\r\nimportance to strengthening the existing safeguards\r\nsystem through the universalization of the Additional\r\nProtocol.\r\nMy Government has recently completed its\r\ndomestic preparations for the implementation of the\r\nAdditional Protocol. We expect that the ratification\r\nprocess will be completed by the end of this year. We\r\nalso underscore the vital role of the export control\r\nregimes led by the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the\r\nZangger Committee in supplementing the NPT system.\r\nThe Republic of Korea strongly supports the\r\nAgency’s work in the promotion of the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy and its applications through its\r\ntechnical cooperation programme and its normative\r\nactivities to enhance global nuclear safety standards.\r\nWe agree with Director General ElBaradei’s view that\r\nnuclear power, which currently meets about 16 per cent\r\nof the world’s demand for electricity, remains the only\r\nenergy source that can supply electricity on a large\r\nscale with minimal impact on the environment. We\r\nencourage the Agency to enhance its role in promoting\r\nwider recognition of the potential that nuclear power\r\nholds for sustainable development.\r\nThe Republic of Korea views the promotion of\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy, particularly in the area\r\nof power generation, as an integral part of its\r\nsustainable development strategy. Our 18 nuclear\r\npower reactors currently in operation meet more than\r\n40 per cent of our electricity demand. If the same\r\namount of electricity were generated by coal-fired\r\npower plants, our total greenhouse gas emissions would\r\nbe at least 20 per cent higher than they are now. We are\r\nready to share our own experiences with respect to the\r\nplanning, construction and operation of nuclear-power\r\nplants with all countries in good standing under the\r\nNPT.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to draw the\r\nattention of the IAEA member States to resolution\r\nGC(43)/RES/19, adopted by the 43rd IAEA General\r\nConference in 1999. That resolution approved the\r\namendment to article VI of the Agency’s Statute to\r\nexpand the membership of the Board of Governors\r\nfrom 35 to 43.\r\nFour years have passed since the amendment to\r\nthe Statute was approved by the General Conference,\r\nyet we note that only 34 of the 137 IAEA member\r\nStates have so far ratified the amendment. We believe\r\nthat the expansion of the Board membership will make\r\nthe composition of the Board more representative of\r\nthe underlying international realities and thus will\r\nstrengthen the authority, effectiveness and relevance of\r\nthe Agency in dealing with the new challenges the\r\nAgency faces today. The Republic of Korea therefore\r\ncalls upon all member States of the IAEA which have\r\nnot yet done so to ratify the amendment without further\r\ndelay, so that it may come into effect at the earliest\r\npossible date.\r\nMr. Konuzin (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): the Russian Federation extends its greetings\r\nto the Director-General of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), Mr. ElBaradei, and thanks him\r\nfor introducing the annual report of the Agency.\r\nRussia is an active member of the IAEA. We are\r\nsatisfied with the Agency’s work and recognize the\r\ngrowing importance of its role in strengthening the\r\ninternational regime governing non-proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons and in ensuring the required level of\r\nconfidence for cooperation in the peaceful uses of\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.53\r\natomic energy and for developing safe nuclear-power\r\nproduction.\r\nWe wish to reaffirm that there is a need further to\r\nstrengthen and enhance the efficiency of the IAEA\r\nsafeguards system as the basis for the nuclear-weapon\r\nnon-proliferation regime.\r\nThe terrorist acts that have taken place in Russia,\r\nthe United States and other countries; the recent\r\ndramatic developments in the Middle East; and the\r\ncritical situation in Iraq are clear demonstrations of the\r\ndanger posed by international terrorism to the entire\r\nworld community. This requires that we strengthen our\r\nefforts to establish a global system to counter new\r\nchallenges and threats, including nuclear ones.\r\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) has a key role to play in ensuring\r\ninternational security. It is our hope that preparations\r\nfor the 2005 NPT Review Conference will help to\r\nconsolidate the positions of as many States as possible\r\nin favour of the main goals and objectives of that\r\nTreaty.\r\nThe Russian-American Strategic Offensive\r\nReductions Treaty, which has now entered into force,\r\nwas an important contribution on the part of Russia to\r\nthe strengthening of strategic stability and was\r\nevidence of Russia’s compliance with its obligations\r\nunder the NPT. We are convinced that the Treaty goes\r\nbeyond the framework of bilateral relations and meets\r\nthe interests of all countries.\r\nMr. Alexandre (Haiti), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWe believe that one substantial element of\r\nnuclear disarmament is the disposition of excessive\r\nweapons-grade materials and the reduction of nuclear\r\nweapons. We are implementing the agreement between\r\nthe Governments of the Russian Federation and the\r\nUnited States of America of 18 February 1993, which\r\ndealt with the disposition of highly enriched uranium\r\nextracted from nuclear weapons.\r\nWe support the IAEA Project on Innovative\r\nNuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles, which is being\r\nimplemented under the auspices of the Agency and\r\nwithin the context of the General Conference’s\r\nresolution, adopted in 2000, on strengthening the\r\nAgency’s activities related to nuclear science,\r\ntechnology and applications. That Project is a practical\r\nstep towards implementation of the initiative by the\r\nPresident of the Russian Federation, Mr. Putin, which\r\nwas announced at the Millennium Summit, on\r\ndeveloping proliferation-safe nuclear technologies.\r\nWe note also that in September, the IAEA\r\nGeneral Conference approved the resolution proposed\r\nby Russia on the Agency’s activities in this area.\r\nRecently Russia has been devoting increasing attention\r\nto research and development on new nuclear\r\ntechnologies. In accordance with our strategy for\r\nnuclear-power development in Russia in the first half\r\nof the twenty-first century, we have initiated a number\r\nof innovative projects using thermal reactors and fast\r\nneutron reactors. The goal is to address, inter alia, the\r\nissue of how to ensure the safe use of weapons-grade\r\nand energy plutonium and of how to prepare for the\r\ntransition to a totally closed fuel cycle.\r\nLet me turn now to some aspects of the Agency’s\r\nactivities on which the international community’s\r\nattention has been focused. We are following\r\ndevelopments related to Iran’s nuclear programme, and\r\nwe welcome the steps taken by that country to develop\r\na dialogue with the IAEA in order to resolve pending\r\nissues.\r\nWe appreciate the work being done now by\r\nTehran and by IAEA experts, which represents\r\nprogress in the right direction. We believe that in future\r\nany problem between the IAEA and Iran should be\r\nresolved through cooperation.\r\nIt is our expectation that Iran will fully comply\r\nwith the provisions of the September resolution\r\nadopted by the IAEA Board of Governors. We believe\r\nthat that resolution offers a work plan for the IAEA and\r\nIran to clarify pending issues as soon as possible. We\r\nhope that by the next meeting of the Board of\r\nGovernors, substantial progress will have been made in\r\nthe implementation of those measures contained in the\r\nSeptember resolution, and it is our hope also that this\r\nmatter will be shifted back from political debate to the\r\nmore routine track of work between the Agency and a\r\nmember State.\r\nWe welcome Iran’s declared readiness to sign the\r\nprotocol additional to safeguards agreements with the\r\nAgency and to refrain from operations involving\r\nsensitive elements of the nuclear fuel cycle, especially\r\nuranium enrichment experiments. We regard these\r\ndecisions as a major step forward by the Iranian\r\nleadership. It is our feeling that, today, the issue of\r\nIran’s nuclear programme is excessively politicized.\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.53\r\nWe hope that it will be possible to move it back within\r\nthe area of regular International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) inspection activities.\r\nAt present we see no reason to reduce our\r\ncooperation with the Islamic Republic of Iran in the\r\nnuclear field, which is fully transparent and does not\r\nviolate international obligations, either those of Russia\r\nor of Iran.\r\nAs to the nuclear programme of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, we would like to say that\r\nRussia has made political and diplomatic efforts with a\r\nview to an early resumption of talks to settle the North\r\nKorean nuclear problem within the six-party format.\r\nWe welcome the agreement, in principle, on a new\r\nround of multilateral talks within the framework of the\r\nBeijing process. A comprehensive solution must be\r\nfound to this problem, which should include measures\r\nto make the Korean Peninsula a non-nuclear area, stop\r\nPyongyang’s military nuclear programme, get the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea back into the\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and into cooperation\r\nwith the IAEA, and take due account of the legitimate\r\ninterests of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nby, for example, guaranteeing its security and creating\r\na favourable environment for its normal economic\r\ndevelopment. We consider Pyongyang’s decision to\r\nwithdraw from the NPT reversible.\r\nIn conclusion, let me express our support for the\r\nconsensus resolution on the IAEA report drafted by our\r\nSpanish colleagues. Russia appreciates the work done\r\nby the IAEA and is a sponsor of the draft resolution\r\n(A/58/L.10).\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to invite\r\nrepresentatives of the Member States to the meeting\r\nbeing held to address United States-Russian non-\r\nproliferation measures to meet global security\r\nchallenges that will be co-hosted by the Russian\r\nMinister of Atomic Energy, Mr. Rumyantsev, and\r\nUnited States Secretary of Energy, Mr. Abraham. The\r\nmeeting will be held in the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil Chamber at 4 p.m. on 5 November.\r\nMr. Akram (Pakistan): I join other speakers\r\nin extending our gratitude to our dear friend\r\nMr. ElBaradei for presenting the annual report of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The\r\ndynamic leadership provided by Mr. ElBaradei is\r\nemblematic of the commendable work being performed\r\nby the Agency, at times in very difficult circumstances.\r\nThe IAEA is a unique international forum whose\r\nstatutory obligations are designed for promoting\r\ndevelopment through the peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy. Its technical expertise is unmatched, and its\r\ngoals and objectives are equitable.\r\nThe fast depletion of fossil resources has revived\r\nthe demand for nuclear energy. We are encouraged to\r\nsee that the Agency’s report has highlighted the\r\ngrowing demand for nuclear energy during 2002. The\r\npace of the construction of various reactors, especially\r\nin Far East and South Asia, could be further increased\r\nif States were not subjected to undue restrictions. With\r\ninnovative technologies, safe nuclear power plants are\r\na reality and could be constructed in energy deficient\r\ncountries. In this regard, the IAEA’s role in the transfer\r\nof safe technology to developing countries has assumed\r\nadded significance. We hope that the Agency will\r\nformulate a comprehensive policy for this purpose.\r\nThe Agency’s development role has been duly\r\nacknowledged in the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment as promoting specific action for sustained\r\nenergy development through peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy. Additionally, the Agency’s role in the\r\npromotion of the linkages between peace, economic\r\ngrowth and technology needs to be emphasized.\r\nThe safety and verification aspects of the IAEA\r\nmandate remain import pillars of the Agency’s\r\nmandate. The Agency has initiated action with regard\r\nto the safety of nuclear materials. There is a need to\r\nfocus attention on securing so-called “orphan” sources\r\nof such materials, which pose an immediate danger of\r\nfalling into the wrong hands. The Agency’s report\r\nhighlights this aspect and we fully agree with the\r\nremedial measures that have been suggested.\r\nAs regards the strengthening of the Agency’s\r\nsafeguards system, Pakistan believes that the\r\nmaintenance of a proper balance between the\r\npromotional aspect and safety and security related\r\nconcerns of the Agency’s functions is essential. The\r\nAgency’s safeguards should not be used to serve\r\npartisan political objectives. Its verification regime can\r\nremain credible only if it is applied on a non-\r\ndiscriminatory basis, as stipulated by the Agency’s\r\nStatute.\r\nThe Government of Pakistan attaches the highest\r\nimportance to the IAEA’s Technical Cooperation\r\nProgramme, which offers unique opportunities to\r\ndeveloping countries. In view of Pakistan’s limited\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.53\r\nfossil fuel resources, nuclear power generation has\r\nbecome an indispensable element of our national\r\nenergy strategy. We are also extremely sensitive to the\r\nrisk of industrial pollution expected as a result of our\r\neconomic growth. This obligates us to promote nuclear\r\npower generation in the coming years. Pakistan’s\r\nexcellent operational and safety record for its two\r\nnuclear power plants and the existence of a reliable\r\ninfrastructure have encouraged us to acquire another\r\nnuclear power station similar to the Chashna Nuclear\r\nPower Plant.\r\nPakistan’s future nuclear power generation\r\nactivities will not be limited merely to the installation\r\nof more power plants, but extend to the utilization of\r\nsome of these facilities for the powering of desalination\r\nplants. We are working on a first demonstration\r\ndesalination unit at the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant.\r\nPakistan is also applying nuclear science for the\r\ndevelopment of agriculture, health and wasteland\r\nreclamation. We appreciate the growing cooperation\r\nbetween the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and\r\nthe IAEA in these fields. Pakistan is also interested in\r\nplaying a serious role in international efforts to\r\npromote the International Project on Innovative\r\nNuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles, to enable Pakistan\r\nto benefit from safe, cost effective and proliferation-\r\nresistant nuclear power plants in the future.\r\nWe are highly sensitive to the safety and security\r\nof our nuclear installations, particularly when Pakistan\r\nis extending its nuclear power generation for economic\r\ndevelopment. We have successfully established a\r\nstrong safety culture in our nuclear activities and are\r\nadhering diligently to the principles of the Convention\r\non Nuclear Safety. We have further strengthened\r\nsecurity measures around our nuclear installations to\r\navoid any possibility of nuclear terrorism or of illicit\r\ntrafficking of nuclear material. Our active participation\r\nin the Agency’s initiative to strengthen the Convention\r\non the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material will be\r\ncontinued.\r\nWe all have great expectations from the IAEA in\r\nthe promotion of socio-economic development of its\r\nmember States. The Agency’s technical cooperation\r\nrequires a reassessment of its current framework\r\nwhereby it can render assistance to member States on a\r\nnon-discriminatory and equitable basis. The following\r\nmeasures can help in enhancing the Agency’s\r\ncooperative role. First is the need to preserve the\r\ntechnical nature of the IAEA and to ensure its\r\nfunctioning according to its statutory mandate, without\r\nany politicization of its agenda. Second is the\r\nimperative of maintaining balance between the\r\nAgency’s promotional aspects and its functions related\r\nto verification, safety and security. Third is the\r\nsignificance of the Agency’s technical cooperation\r\nactivities and the role that those activities can play in\r\nassisting in the development and practical application\r\nof atomic energy for peaceful uses and in technology\r\ntransfer to developing countries. Fourth is the\r\nprovision of more assured resources for technical\r\ncooperation activities, technology transfer and training\r\nfacilities for developing countries. And fifth is greater\r\ninvolvement by developing countries in the design and\r\nimplementation of technical cooperation projects, as\r\nwell as increased outsourcing to developing member\r\nStates for technical cooperation programmes.\r\nFinally, we are pleased that this year’s draft\r\nresolution on the IAEA report has taken into account\r\nthe concerns of all Member States. The new text\r\nexcludes the controversial elements that have impeded\r\nthe adoption of a consensus resolution on the subject in\r\nthe past. We have joined the consensus, and we would\r\nbe pleased to be a sponsor the draft resolution.\r\nMr. Motomura (Japan): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment of Japan, I should like to express my\r\ngratitude to Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General\r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),\r\nfor his statement as well as for preparing the report of\r\nthe Agency, contained in document A/58/312.\r\nThe regime of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) has been a key element in\r\nworld peace and stability, and serves the common\r\ninterest of all of us. In the light of the current situation,\r\nI should like to reaffirm my country’s unshakeable\r\ncommitment to the NPT regime.\r\nJapan’s basic atomic energy law strictly limits the\r\nuse of nuclear energy to peaceful purposes. Japan, the\r\nonly country to have suffered nuclear devastation,\r\nfirmly adheres to the long-standing policy of the three\r\nnon-nuclear principles. Those principles state that we\r\nwill not possess or produce nuclear weapons or permit\r\nthe introduction of such weapons into Japan. That\r\npolicy will not change: Japan will never possess\r\nnuclear weapons. Japan will fulfil its obligations under\r\nits safeguards agreement with the IAEA and its\r\nAdditional Protocol to attain full transparency in its\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.53\r\nnuclear activities, including the utilization of\r\nplutonium.\r\nThe peaceful, appropriate use of nuclear energy\r\ngreatly contributes to the welfare of mankind and to\r\nsocial and economic development worldwide. It also\r\nminimizes the burden on the environment. The nuclear\r\nenergy option is therefore of vital importance for\r\nmankind. Under the present circumstances — in which\r\nchallenges to the NPT regime and to the IAEA\r\nsafeguards have surfaced — the IAEA’s activities for\r\nthe purpose of strengthening and promoting the\r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy and non-proliferation\r\nare all the more relevant and noteworthy.\r\nIn view of recent challenges to the NPT regime,\r\nthe IAEA safeguards system must be strengthened. To\r\nthat end, we must promote universalization of the\r\nAdditional Protocol. Currently, 78 States have signed\r\nthat Protocol, but only 37 of them, including Japan,\r\nhave brought it into force. Those figures are far from\r\nsatisfactory. My Government would like to request\r\ncountries that have not yet done so to sign and\r\nconclude the Additional Protocol.\r\nIn cooperation with the IAEA, the Japanese\r\nGovernment hosted in Tokyo last December the\r\nInternational Conference on Wider Adherence\r\nto Strengthened IAEA Safeguards. The Tokyo\r\nConference — which aimed to consolidate the\r\noutcomes of the preceding regional seminars — was\r\nvery successful, with 82 participants from 36 countries\r\nthroughout the world. The participants reaffirmed the\r\nimportance of the Additional Protocol, and the\r\nChairman’s summary of the Conference put forth a\r\nseries of proposed actions to encourage adherence to\r\nthe Additional Protocol. In keeping with the outcomes\r\nof the Conference, we shall continue to undertake\r\nefforts aimed at universalization of the Additional\r\nProtocol, building on our extensive experience in its\r\nimplementation.\r\nSince the terrorist attacks on 11 September two\r\nyears ago, nuclear security has become an important\r\nissue for the international community. The IAEA plays\r\na vital role in this area. It is worth noting that\r\nparticipants in the International Conference on Security\r\nof Radioactive Sources, held in Vienna last March,\r\nagreed on the importance of the security of radioactive\r\nsources in the context of the fight against nuclear\r\nterrorism. Moreover, at the Group of Eight (G-8) Evian\r\nSummit, held this year, the G-8 leaders reached an\r\nagreement on a statement and an action programme for\r\nsecuring radioactive sources. Japan, as a member of the\r\nG-8, continues to take appropriate measures in that\r\narea and also expects the international community to\r\nwork on improving the management of radioactive\r\nsources and to support the IAEA’s role in that regard.\r\nThe North Korean nuclear issue has heightened\r\ninternational tension since October last year. It is\r\nregrettable that North Korea remains in non-\r\ncompliance with its safeguards agreement with the\r\nAgency and is proceeding with nuclear weapons\r\ndevelopment. That is a very serious issue for the peace\r\nand stability not only of the region, but also of the\r\ninternational community as a whole.\r\nThe basic positions of my Government with\r\nregard to the North Korean nuclear issue are as\r\nfollows. First, North Korea’s development of nuclear\r\nweapons and its possession and transfer of such\r\nweapons are totally unacceptable. Secondly, North\r\nKorea must come into compliance with all international\r\nobligations related to the nuclear issue, including the\r\nNPT. Thirdly, North Korea must immediately dismantle\r\nits nuclear weapons programme and its nuclear\r\ndevelopment programme in a complete, verifiable and\r\nirreversible manner.\r\nMy Government aims to achieve a peaceful and\r\ndiplomatic solution of the nuclear issue through the\r\nprocess of the six-party talks. My Government urges\r\nNorth Korea to take positive and responsible measures\r\naimed at resolving that issue. Japan believes that the\r\nIAEA can play an important role in the verification of\r\nthe North Korean nuclear issue, and we shall continue\r\nto support the Agency’s efforts for the peaceful\r\nsolution of this matter.\r\nAs regards the recent decisions made by the\r\nIranian Government on its nuclear programme —\r\nwhich are for the most part in line with the\r\nrequirements enumerated in the September IAEA\r\nBoard of Governors resolution — Japan views such\r\ndevelopments as a positive step. It is important,\r\nhowever, that Iran act in accordance with its own\r\ndecisions and also that it comply fully with the IAEA\r\nBoard of Governors resolution. Japan will be closely\r\nwatching Iran’s actions, and we shall pay close\r\nattention to the upcoming report by the Director\r\nGeneral, while cooperating closely with the\r\ninternational community and the IAEA in the efforts to\r\nresolve this issue.\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.53\r\nIn closing, I should like to reiterate my\r\nGovernment’s strong commitment to and support for\r\nthe activities of the IAEA so that it may fulfil its noble\r\nmission under the leadership of its Director General.\r\nMr. Oyugi (Kenya): Allow me to commend the\r\nPresident on behalf of my delegation for the able\r\nmanner in which he has continued to guide the\r\ndeliberations of the Assembly. I wish to reassure him\r\nof my delegation’s support and cooperation.\r\nI also wish to commend the Director-General\r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency,\r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, for his comprehensive report\r\nfor the year 2002 and the additional information on the\r\nmajor activities of 2003.\r\nKenya has been, and continues to be, a firm\r\nsupporter of the Agency’s endeavours to strengthen the\r\nnon-proliferation regime and the peaceful use of\r\nnuclear energy in the context of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. I would like to express the support and\r\ncommitment of the new Government of Kenya to the\r\nindispensable contribution that the Agency continues to\r\nmake in these important fields.\r\nMy delegation attaches great significance to the\r\nAgency’s cardinal responsibility to provide Member\r\nStates with definitive and independent assurances on\r\nthe safety and proper use of all nuclear materials\r\naround the world, in accordance with international\r\nobligations and commitments. In that regard, I would\r\nlike to express my delegation’s satisfaction with the\r\nAgency’s conclusion that, in the main, all nuclear\r\nmaterials and other items placed under safeguards\r\nremained consigned to peaceful activities and were\r\nadequately accounted for during 2002.\r\nNuclear non-proliferation, as enshrined in the\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), goes beyond requiring\r\nStates to relinquish their right to develop nuclear\r\nweapons: it is also about requiring those States already\r\nin possession of nuclear weapons to give them up. The\r\ncommitment on nuclear disarmament given by the\r\nnuclear-weapon States at the NPT Review Conference\r\nof 2000 ought therefore to be respected. Calls by\r\nnuclear-weapon States for other States to abandon their\r\nnuclear ambitions would carry more weight and moral\r\nauthority if they were accompanied by their own\r\ndemonstration of greater commitment to nuclear\r\ndisarmament.\r\nIt is disappointing that some nuclear-weapon\r\nStates are instead pursuing research into new types of\r\nnuclear weapons and are developing strategic plans to\r\ninclude the possible use of such weapons. Those\r\ndevelopments are a serious affront to the NPT\r\ncommitments and grossly undermine efforts at\r\nachieving the universality of the Non-Proliferation\r\nTreaty. My delegation is equally disheartened that the\r\nlatest Article XIV Conference of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) held in Vienna in\r\nSeptember 2003 ended without any significant progress\r\ntowards ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty by the remaining Annex II countries,\r\nyet early entry-into-force of the Treaty was the first of\r\nthe 13 practical steps to disarmament agreed at the\r\n2000 NPT Review Conference. Pending the entry into\r\nforce of the Treaty, it is paramount that the moratorium\r\non nuclear-test explosions or explosions of any other\r\nnuclear device be maintained.\r\nThe Kenya delegation welcomes the Agency’s\r\ndetermination, as emphasized in the Director General’s\r\nreport, to continue with the development of the ever-\r\nincreasing number of peaceful nuclear applications\r\nsuch as sea water desalination, sterile insect\r\ntechniques, the mutation and breeding of food crops\r\nand other applications in the field of nuclear medicine.\r\nThose activities, which the Agency has continued\r\ncommendably to advance within its technical\r\ncooperation framework, are of special significance to\r\nthose of us from the developing countries.\r\nI am pleased to report that valuable achievements\r\nhave been made in the Agency’s technical cooperation\r\nactivities in Kenya. Current agency activities include\r\nthe use of nuclear techniques to enhance crop\r\nproduction and improve the diagnosis and control of\r\nlivestock diseases. For instance, we have been\r\nsuccessful in developing an improved variety of wheat\r\nthat has greater resistance to drought and pests.\r\nOne of the greatest obstacles to increased food\r\nand agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa is\r\nthe tsetse fly infestation and trypanosomiasis. We are\r\ntherefore pleased that the sterile insect technique (SIT)\r\ndeveloped by the Agency, whose effectiveness has\r\nalready been demonstrated in the eradication of the\r\ntsetse fly, has been expanded to several African\r\ncountries including Kenya. In recognition of the\r\nmagnitude of the tsetse fly problem, African leaders\r\ninitiated the Pan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis\r\nEradication Campaign (PATTEC), known as the\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.53\r\nPATTEC Plan of Action. It is gratifying to note that the\r\nAgency and the PATTEC Coordinating Office within\r\nthe Commission of the African Union have agreed on\r\nmodalities for incorporating PATTEC activities in the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)\r\nagenda.\r\nThe Agency’s human health programme in Kenya\r\nincludes the improvement of the national healthcare\r\ndelivery system, particularly in the area of diagnostics\r\nand radiotherapy. We shall soon be requesting the\r\nAgency to consider new project proposals for\r\nassistance in establishing two radiotherapy centres,\r\nwhich would benefit patients in rural areas. In the light\r\nof the demonstrated success of the sterile insect\r\ntechnique in tsetse eradication, we are confident that\r\nthe inauguration of the SIT research project on the\r\neradication of malaria-causing mosquitoes at the\r\nAgency’s Seibersdorf laboratory will play a leading\r\nrole in the Roll Back Malaria Programme.\r\nKenya is also involved with the Agency in the\r\nimplementation of a regional project in the water sector\r\non isotope hydrology integration. The project aims at\r\nredressing water inadequacy in our region through the\r\napplication of nuclear techniques. We believe that the\r\nAgency is well endowed to make a greater contribution\r\ntowards providing durable solutions in this field.\r\nThe flourishing of peaceful nuclear techniques in\r\nthe twenty-first century calls for a stringent safety\r\nculture as an indispensable component of any\r\nsuccessful peaceful nuclear technology programme.\r\nMy delegation is therefore appreciative of the Agency’s\r\nsupport, within the model project on radiation\r\nprotection infrastructure, given to the Kenya Radiation\r\nProtection Board to improve radiation safety. The\r\nAgency has provided support in the form of equipment\r\nfor the Radiation Protection Board and in the\r\nestablishment of a system for occupational exposure\r\ncontrol. The Government is also in the process of\r\nrevising the Radiation Protection Act in order to make\r\nit basic-safety-standard compliant.\r\nAs Kenya and, indeed, many developing\r\ncountries continue to integrate modern nuclear\r\ntechniques in technological development, the need for\r\nhighly competent personnel in nuclear science assumes\r\ngreater significance. We therefore appreciate the\r\nAgency’s efforts to provide training opportunities for\r\nour scientists, and we encourage the Agency to widen\r\ncooperation in that important area of human resource\r\ndevelopment. We also note with pleasure the launch of\r\nthe World Nuclear University, and it is our hope that\r\nthis initiative will go a long way towards redressing the\r\nproblem of the shortage of nuclear scientists,\r\nparticularly in developing countries.\r\nKenya recognizes the daunting challenges facing\r\nthe Agency as the only competent and specialized body\r\nof the United Nations family charged with the vital role\r\nof advancing the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It is a\r\nrole that the Agency has continued to fulfil admirably.\r\nHowever, the Agency can continue to fulfil that role\r\nonly if Member States support its work programme by\r\nmaking the necessary financial resources available. It is\r\nmy delegation\u0027s hope that member countries will heed\r\nthe Director General\u0027s call for sustained and predictable\r\nfunding.\r\nLet me once again thank the Director General of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency and his staff\r\nfor their good work over the past year. My delegation\r\nis confident that they will continue to meet the\r\nchallenges ahead with the same professionalism that\r\nthey have shown to date.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 4.25 p.m. and\r\nresumed at 4.45 p.m.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nAddress by Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President\r\nof the Republic of Uganda\r\nThe President: We are honoured to have in the\r\nAssembly His Excellency the President of Uganda,\r\nwho has graciously consented to address us on the\r\nissue of “Commodities and development: the\r\nexperience of Uganda”. Mr. President, I welcome you\r\nto the General Assembly and express our profound\r\nappreciation for your presence here.\r\nThe issue you will address is one that the\r\ninternational community has discussed and debated for\r\nmany years — how to respond to the problems of\r\ncommodity-dependent economies. This is a particularly\r\ncritical issue for the overwhelming majority of\r\ndeveloping countries. Indeed, the declining and volatile\r\ncommodity prices, combined with trade policy\r\npractices in the developed world, including tariff\r\nescalation and tariff peaks, have been among the\r\nfactors significantly impeding the development efforts\r\nof commodity-dependent countries.\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.53\r\nIt is understandable, therefore, that commodities\r\nshould and must be a key issue for the United Nations.\r\nYour visit here today, Mr. President, not only\r\nunderscores this, but also provides us with another very\r\nimportant opportunity to spotlight many of the issues\r\nconcerning commodities.\r\nWe have also received invaluable assistance in\r\naddressing the commodities issue and in reviewing\r\nactions for further progress from the report of the\r\nMeeting of Eminent Persons on Commodity Issues.\r\nThat report is the outcome of the General Assembly’s\r\nrequest to the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) to convene a Meeting of\r\nEminent Persons, which was held in Geneva on 22 and\r\n23 September 2003. The now completed Eminent\r\nPersons report was the subject of discussion at the\r\nrecent meeting of the UNCTAD Trade and\r\nDevelopment Board.\r\nOver the past week, we have had the opportunity\r\nto review many of the issues concerning commodities,\r\nparticularly during the High-level Dialogue on\r\nFinancing for Development, as well as in the Open-\r\nended Panel of the General Assembly on Commodities,\r\nconvened on 27 October to consider the report of the\r\nEminent Persons.\r\nWe have addressed in a frank and forthright\r\nmanner issues including dependence on commodities,\r\nthe impact of the free market on that dependence, the\r\nuse of commodities as vehicles for investment and\r\nspeculation in deregulated and free capital markets and\r\nthe impact of those phenomena on the natural volatility\r\nof commodity earnings.\r\nThe meeting of Eminent Persons, in particular,\r\nhas made important recommendations for consideration\r\nby the General Assembly in areas including market\r\naccess, oversupply of commodities, compensatory\r\nfinancing and the strengthening of capacity and\r\ninstitutions. The point has also been made that a long-\r\nterm solution might be to take a new look at the\r\nestablishment of an international export diversification\r\nfund. Further consideration of the commodities issue is\r\nnow proceeding in the Assembly’s Second Committee.\r\nThere is an important message conveyed in the\r\nreport of the meeting of Eminent Persons and in the\r\ndiscussions of the commodities issue, including by the\r\nOpen-ended Panel: it is that the time is now overdue\r\nfor decisive action to be taken to assist commodity-\r\ndependent countries in achieving a higher level of\r\ngrowth, employment and income.\r\nAll initiatives in the commodities area stand to\r\nbenefit immensely from the address today by the\r\nPresident of Uganda. Uganda in many ways typifies the\r\nexperience of commodity-dependent poor countries. It\r\nhas faced development challenges due to commodity\r\nprice volatility, a secular decline in commodity prices\r\nand the trade policies of the developing world. There\r\nare encouraging signs that an environment more\r\nconducive to growth and development for Uganda and\r\nother commodity-dependent developing countries is\r\nnow taking shape.\r\nPresident Museveni is well placed to share with\r\nthe General Assembly the particular challenges Uganda\r\nhas faced and continues to face as a commodity-\r\ndependent developing country. We would also welcome\r\nthe President’s views on the efforts his Government is\r\nmaking to position Uganda to take full advantage of all\r\navailable opportunities for growth and development.\r\nMr. President, we very much look forward to the\r\nimportant address you will make to this Assembly.\r\nI now give the floor to Ms. Louise Fréchette,\r\nDeputy Secretary-General of the United Nations.\r\nMs. Fréchette: Let me first join in welcoming\r\nPresident Museveni to the Assembly. It is a real\r\npleasure to have him with us today, and I look forward\r\nto his address explaining the experience of Uganda and\r\nthe very important subject of trade and commodities.\r\nThe world economy has gone through enormous\r\nchanges over the last few decades. But one fact has\r\nchanged very little: a large number of developing\r\ncountries remain greatly dependent on the export of\r\nprimary commodities.\r\nOut of 141 developing countries, 95 depend on\r\ncommodities for more than half of their export\r\nearnings. For 70 of them, those revenues were\r\ngenerated by only three commodities. That makes those\r\ncountries very vulnerable to price declines and\r\nvolatility.\r\nAnd, indeed, commodity prices have declined\r\nover the long term, especially after 1980. Between\r\n1980 and 2002, agricultural prices have declined by 47\r\nper cent relative to manufacturing prices, and the prices\r\nof metals and minerals have declined by 35 per cent\r\nrelative to manufacturing prices. For some individual\r\ncommodities, the price declines are even larger. For\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.53\r\ninstance, coffee producers now receive roughly a third\r\nof the price that prevailed in the mid-1990s.\r\nThe price declines can be explained by factors\r\nsuch as little growth in demand, technological\r\nadvances that have led to synthetic substitutes and\r\noversupply, for example as a result of subsidies or\r\nmisguided policies.\r\nNeedless to say, that has deprived both\r\nGovernments and the people of developing countries of\r\nlarge amounts of revenue, contributing to poverty and\r\nmaking it more difficult to reach the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. For a group of 81 mostly small\r\ndeveloping countries, the foreign exchange loss\r\namounted to more than $6 billion per year on average\r\nduring the period 1995 to 2000, according to one\r\nestimate.\r\nLower export revenues have also endangered the\r\nsuccess of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\r\nInitiative. Eight heavily indebted poor countries have\r\nreached the completion point, but some of them have\r\nexperienced worsening debt indicators owing to lower\r\ncommodity prices.\r\nLittle has been done about these long-standing\r\nproblems. Old instruments such as contingency lending\r\nand buffer stocks have faded into history. Recently,\r\nthere seems to be, as President Chirac has put it, a\r\nconspiracy of silence.\r\nThe Monterrey Consensus highlighted the need to\r\nmitigate the consequences of low and volatile revenues\r\nfrom commodity exports. Where do we go from here?\r\nFirst, market access needs to be improved. It is\r\ndeplorable that cocoa beans enter the major developed\r\nmarkets largely unhindered, while final products can\r\nenter only at tariffs of 15 to 30 per cent, with maximum\r\ntariffs even higher. The Doha Development Round of\r\ntrade negotiations should address those issues for all\r\ncommodities.\r\nSecondly, developing countries themselves can\r\nimplement policies that reduce their vulnerability.\r\nEspecially important are medium-term fiscal\r\nframeworks, social safety nets and well-managed\r\nreserve funds to smooth large swings in public\r\nrevenues. The latter also improve accountability and\r\ntransparency in the public management of receipts\r\nfrom the exploitation of natural resource endowments,\r\nwhich in several cases has been a source of conflict.\r\nThirdly, dormant international financing\r\nmechanisms that compensate for fluctuations in export\r\nrevenues, such as the International Monetary Fund’s\r\nCompensatory and Contingency Financing Facility,\r\nshould be revived.\r\nFourthly, new market-based approaches could be\r\nexplored. That would include insurance schemes and\r\nrisk management tools. Technical assistance in this\r\narea is needed.\r\nFinally — and perhaps most important of all — is\r\ndiversification. Many developing countries have made\r\ngreat progress in the diversification of exports, thanks\r\nto policy reforms and investments in skills, education,\r\ninfrastructure and technological capabilities. Uganda,\r\nfor example, has significantly increased exports of\r\nitems such as fish and cut flowers. I am sure that\r\nPresident Museveni will provide some valuable\r\ninsights on his country’s efforts.\r\nIf we are to have any chance of halving poverty\r\nand meeting the Millennium Development Goals by\r\n2015, we need to address the fundamental problem of\r\ncommodities that many developing countries face. I\r\nurge you all to give this issue your urgent attention and\r\nthank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts\r\nwith you.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to Mr. Sha\r\nZukang, President of the Trade and Development\r\nBoard of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment.\r\nMr. Sha Zukang (United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Development): It is an honour for me to\r\naddress the Assembly, in my capacity as President of\r\nthe Trade and Development Board of the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD), on the very important and pressing issue\r\nof commodities.\r\nThe difficulties faced by commodity-dependent\r\ndeveloping countries has regained centre stage because,\r\nover the past two decades, commodities in general have\r\nlost more than a half of their purchasing power relative\r\nto manufactured goods. That problem is compounded\r\nby the endemic volatility in commodity prices, which\r\neffectively compromises long-term planning in those\r\ncountries. According to UNCTAD, the average\r\nmonthly fluctuations in the prices of bananas, cocoa,\r\ncotton, hides and skins, nickel, petroleum, sugar, tea\r\nand most vegetable oils have been more than 10 per\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.53\r\ncent, which has made it impossible for countries that\r\ndepend on the export of those products to have a\r\nreasonable predictability in their incomes. Moreover,\r\ncommodities form the backbone for most industries in\r\nthose countries, with the effect that the collapse in\r\nworld commodity prices has been accompanied by de-\r\nindustrialization, with very negative implications for\r\nemployment and well-being.\r\nAgainst that background, it is clear that dealing\r\neffectively with the problems of commodities is crucial\r\nin the quest for sustained economic growth and\r\nsustainable development in commodity-dependent\r\ndeveloping countries. The objective of achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals by the year 2015 adds\r\na strong sense of urgency to that task, which should\r\nenable us to summon the political will to push the\r\ncommodity agenda forward.\r\nLast year, the General Assembly requested the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Development to designate independent\r\neminent persons to examine and report on commodity\r\nissues, including the volatility in commodity prices, the\r\ndeclining terms of trade and the impact that these have\r\non the development efforts of commodity-dependent\r\ndeveloping countries. That group of 15 members from\r\ndiverse backgrounds and with diverse affiliations has,\r\non the basis of frank, open and in-depth analysis and\r\ndiscussion, come up with 15 realistic, practical and\r\nfocused recommendations. The recommendations — in\r\nthree broad categories, dealing with short-term,\r\nmedium-term and long-term solutions, and addressed\r\nto clearly identified audiences and institutions —\r\nhighlight the following priorities: first, enhanced,\r\nequitable and predictable market access for\r\ncommodities of key importance to developing\r\ncountries, which has much to do with trade\r\nnegotiations; secondly, addressing the problems of\r\noversupply, which include not only subsidies, but also\r\ngains in productivity; thirdly, making compensatory\r\nfinancing schemes user-friendly and operational;\r\nfourthly, strengthening capacity and institutions; and\r\nfifthly, pursuing possibilities for the creation of a new\r\ninternational diversification fund so as to address that\r\nproblem with adequate financing.\r\nThe Trade and Development Board of UNCTAD\r\nconsidered the report of the independent eminent\r\npersons on 17 October 2003. In the debate, there was\r\ncomplete unanimity of views on the urgent need to\r\nreach a solution to the commodities problem. Many\r\nspeakers also felt strongly that that issue deserved the\r\nattention of the World Trade Organization and that an\r\nearly resumption of the Doha round could offer a\r\nconcrete opportunity to deal with the commodities\r\nquestion, especially in areas such as the removal of\r\ntrade-distorting subsidies and other trade practices that\r\nadversely affect agricultural market access. It was also\r\nrecognized that the work required to effectively address\r\nthe commodity question involves many institutional\r\nplayers, including UNCTAD, on analysis of commodity\r\ntrends and capacity development; the International\r\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank, on compensatory\r\nfinancing; the Food and Agricultural Organization of\r\nthe United Nations, the Common Fund for\r\nCommodities and the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization, on diversification; the\r\nInternational Trade Centre, on export promotion; and\r\nthe major private-sector players in commodity markets,\r\non issues of fair trade.\r\nThis morning, I reported to the Second\r\nCommittee on all those aspects and emphasized the\r\nneed to maintain high visibility and a high profile for\r\nthe commodities issue until lasting solutions are found.\r\nI stressed that action on the recommendations of the\r\nindependent eminent persons group should be initiated\r\nimmediately and that the forthcoming UNCTAD XI\r\nshould be utilized to add impetus to that work and to\r\nfurther strengthen UNCTAD’s capacity to fully\r\nimplement the aspects of the recommendations that fall\r\nunder its mandate.\r\nIn conclusion, I urge the Assembly to help in\r\nevery way possible to break what has been called the\r\nconspiracy of silence on the long-time suffering of\r\ncommodity-dependent countries. It is easy to advise\r\nthose countries simply to allow the forces of the market\r\nto take their course. That type of attitude would,\r\nhowever, not be consistent with the realities of policies\r\nthat many countries apply, wrongly or rightly, to their\r\nown commodity sectors. The reason why we insist on a\r\nquest for solutions to the problems of commodity-\r\ndependent countries is that it is an international issue,\r\nand the countries concerned do not have the capacity to\r\nmake the painful adjustments that are required to\r\nrestructure their economies without international\r\nsupport. Therefore, this is an issue on which especially\r\ndeveloped countries must muster the political will to\r\nact in good faith. The report of the independent\r\neminent persons group represents innovative and fresh\r\nproposals — drawing on long experience and recent\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.53\r\ntrends in the multilateral trading system — that should\r\nform the bedrock of such action.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Uganda.\r\nMr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the\r\nRepublic of Uganda, was escorted into the\r\nConference Room.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Uganda, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Museveni: My presence here is a\r\nhappy accident; I was here for another purpose, and it\r\nwas suggested that I might like to address this powerful\r\nbody. I had not prepared a written speech, but, since\r\nthis a topic with which I am very familiar, I quickly\r\njotted down a number of points that I will share with\r\nthe Assembly. Furthermore, I recently addressed a\r\nconference in Tokyo, Japan, on a topic similar to that\r\nwhich the Assembly is discussing, and that statement\r\nwill be distributed to members.\r\nI understand that commodities have a Christian\r\nname. The Christian name is “raw materials”.\r\nNormally, in our part of the world, you have a surname,\r\nand then there is a Christian name, or a Muslim name if\r\nyou are a Muslim. That is why I am called\r\nYoweri Museveni. My surname is Museveni, Yoweri is\r\nthe Christian name. So, the Christian name of\r\ncommodities is “raw materials”, because I do not see a\r\npeople referring to fabric as commodities.\r\nWhen we talk of textiles, the word “commodities”\r\nis not used. When we talk of cars, we do not use the\r\nword commodities. That word mainly refers to\r\nminerals and other natural products, which are not\r\nprocessed. Now I have not read the report of the\r\neminent persons, so I do not know how they define\r\ncommodities, but my understanding of commodities is\r\nunprocessed raw materials to be used in manufacturing.\r\nProducing raw materials is not a mistake. The\r\nmistake is to rely solely on raw materials for your\r\nfuture — that is where the mistake is. Raw materials\r\nare necessary, they are precious, they are the\r\nbasis of industrialization, but the mistake of those\r\n95 countries — the examples that were talked about,\r\nincluding mine — is to rely solely on exporting raw\r\nmaterials. That is where the mistake is.\r\nThe mistake is in two parts: first, to depend solely\r\non exporting raw materials and secondly, not to add\r\nvalue to them. When you make the two mistakes, what\r\nhappens? You suffer in four ways. First, you get a tenth\r\nof the value of your product. Uganda produces most of\r\nthe raw materials we are talking about: cotton, coffee,\r\ntea, tobacco, minerals — we produce all that.\r\nLet us take the example of cotton. There are\r\nmany stages in cotton production. First you grow the\r\ncotton. Once you have harvested it, the next stage is to\r\ngin it. Ginning means you remove the seeds from the\r\ncotton, and you have what is called lint cotton. The\r\nnext stage is spinning, to turn the cotton into yarn.\r\nAfter that is weaving, to produce a fabric. The next\r\nstage is finishing, making printings and all that. The\r\nnext stage is tailoring to produce a garment like those\r\nall of us here are wearing.\r\nUganda, in the past, has ended its contribution to\r\nthe cotton product at ginning. So Uganda has been\r\nexporting lint cotton, the cotton after the seeds are\r\nremoved. What does that mean? I normally hear people\r\nare talking of donor countries, and I do not know what\r\nis the opposite of donor. The opposite of donor must be\r\n“donee”, the one who gets donations. Because if there\r\nis a donor, there must be a “donee”.\r\nAs a matter of fact, the “donees” are actually the\r\ndonors. African countries, including my own, are big\r\ndonor countries, but they are donors in ignorance; they\r\ndo not know that they are donors. How are they\r\ndonors? How is my country a donor?\r\nIf, as we have been doing much of the time, we\r\nexport the cotton in the lint state, after the seeds are\r\nremoved, according to present-day prices, we get $1.20\r\nper kilogram. If that kilogram is turned into yarn, if\r\nsomeone does the spinning, the value goes up three\r\ntimes. So, if we got $1.20, we would now get $3.60. If\r\nthat yarn is woven, the value goes up six times. If it is\r\ntailored to produce a garment, the value goes up ten\r\ntimes. So while we get $1.20 by exporting the lint\r\ncotton, if we process it through all stages to produce a\r\ngarment, we get $12 or $15 from the same cotton.\r\nSo therefore, when we export cotton as lint, what\r\nare we doing? We are a donor, a mega-donor — not\r\neven a small one, a mega one. We are donating, I think,\r\nthree or four things. First, we are donating $9 or $10\r\nfor every kilogram of cotton we export. We are\r\ndonating it to other people, those who do the value\r\naddition. We get one tenth of the value of our\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.53\r\nproduct — that is number one — so we are a donor of\r\nmoney.\r\nAll those African countries, many of them are\r\ndonors. They are donating money. Not only that, they\r\nare donating jobs, because if we export cotton as lint,\r\nwho will do the spinning? It will not be my sister, it\r\nwill not be my son; it will be somebody else. Who will\r\ndo the weaving? It will be somebody else. Who will do\r\nthe finishing of the cotton? It will be somebody else.\r\nWho will do the tailoring? It will be somebody else. So\r\nthose countries are actually donors of money and\r\ndonors of jobs. That is why there are no jobs in Uganda\r\nor all these other countries. That is the reality.\r\nCoffee is the same story. In 1986, Uganda was\r\none of the four biggest exporters of coffee in the whole\r\nworld, after Brazil, Viet Nam and Colombia. In 1986,\r\nwe were exporting 2 million 60-kilogram bags of\r\ncoffee. At that time in 1986, we were earning $500\r\nmillion from the 2 million bags. We are now exporting\r\n4 million bags, so we have doubled our export volume.\r\nBut we are getting $126 million. The harder we work,\r\nthe less we get. That is the law of raw materials —\r\nwhat you call commodities. Yes, the harder we work,\r\nthe less we get. But is the price of coffee in the world\r\ngoing down? Is the person in New York paying less for\r\ncoffee? Not at all. The price for the final consumer is\r\ninstead going up.\r\nWhat proof do I have? Five years ago, the world’s\r\ncoffee business totalled $55 billion. Out of that\r\n$55 billion, the coffee-exporting countries — the\r\nUgandas, the Brazils and the Viet Nams — were\r\ngetting $8 billion. The total business was worth\r\n$55 billion, but the ones growing the coffee were\r\ngetting $8 billion. That was about five years ago.\r\nWhat is the situation now? The coffee business in\r\nthe world is now $71 billion. It has gone up. But how\r\nmuch are the Ugandas getting? They are getting\r\n$5 billion. The price to the consumer is not going\r\ndown; it is going up. The one who is getting less is the\r\nprimary producer.\r\nWho, then, is the donor, and who is the recipient?\r\nUganda is, in fact, among the donors, and has been\r\npersistently, but ignorantly, donating money and jobs to\r\nother people.\r\nOf course, we also donate taxes, because, if\r\nspinning is done in Uganda, that would mean that my\r\npeople were employed in spinning. Others might be\r\nemployed in weaving. Once they are employed, they\r\nget income. Once they get income, they can be taxed,\r\nin the form of income tax. My girls will buy more\r\nperfume and shampoo, and each of those canisters of\r\nshampoo has a tax on it — so the Uganda Government\r\nwould get more taxes if the spinning were done in\r\nUganda.\r\nI do not know what the Eminent Persons\r\nrecommended. I have not yet read their report. But I do\r\nnot like sentimentalism. Sentimentalism will not help\r\nus. Raw materials must go down in price no matter\r\nwhat. That is a law of nature. There is nothing we can\r\ndo with regard to raw materials; they will continue to\r\ngo down in price. Why? There are three reasons.\r\nThe first reason is that, as technology changes,\r\nsome of those raw materials are no longer needed or\r\nare needed in smaller quantities. One example is\r\ncopper. In the 1960s, a number of African countries,\r\nincluding Uganda, were very prosperous, thanks to the\r\nhigh price of copper; they were getting a great deal of\r\nmoney from copper. At that time, copper was being\r\nused to make telephone wires and electric equipment.\r\nThen technology changed, and telephones could be\r\nmade with less copper. Demand declined, and the price\r\nof copper collapsed.\r\nWhat to do, then, if technology has changed and\r\nthere is not so much demand for copper? Are you going\r\nto arrest people and force them to use copper, even\r\nwhen they no longer need it? Who needs to change?\r\nThe users of copper or you? You are the producer of\r\ncopper, and you should be the one to change, to adjust,\r\ninstead of just sitting down and thinking that the world\r\nowes you a living. That is one reason why the prices of\r\nwhat you call commodities go down. They go down\r\nbecause science and technology change, and therefore\r\nthere is either no demand, or less demand, for a\r\nparticular commodity.\r\nThe second reason is oversupply. It so happens\r\nthat these commodities, as you call them, are low-\r\ntechnology products. Anyone in the tropics can\r\nproduce coffee, from Colombia to Viet Nam, to Uganda\r\nand through much of Africa. There is therefore an\r\noversupply because coffee is very easy to produce.\r\nThere is a third reason, and maybe that is where\r\nthe United Nations could help us. The third reason is\r\nthe subsidies of the United States, the European Union,\r\nand Japan.\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.53\r\nAs you can see, I am not very young. I have been\r\naround for some time. In 1955, when I was in third\r\ngrade, I was told that the greatest exporter of beef in\r\nthe world was Argentina, and that the greatest exporter\r\nof wheat in the world was Argentina. What happened\r\nto Argentina as a major beef exporter? Protectionism in\r\nEurope, the United States and Japan has closed us out\r\nof those markets. I produce a lot of beef myself — very\r\ngood beef, very healthy — but I cannot export it to\r\nmany of those countries because of their protectionism.\r\nIf, therefore, the third-world countries cannot\r\nexport beef, milk or sugar because of protectionism,\r\nwhat do they do? They all crowd into the export of\r\ncoffee, because coffee is the only product with respect\r\nto which there is no rivalry between us and the\r\ncountries of the North. That is one of the reasons for\r\nthe overcrowding in the coffee business, because coffee\r\nis the only window — one of few windows; I think the\r\nother one might be tea — where there is no competition\r\nbetween what we export and what is produced in the\r\nEuropean Union and the United States.\r\nMaybe, from this angle, if there were no subsidies\r\nfor products in the United States, Europe and Japan, it\r\nwould be possible for us to spread out. Instead of all of\r\nus crowding into coffee, we could go to beef, and\r\nothers could go elsewhere. There would be more\r\nspreading out.\r\nWhat is the solution? I see two.\r\nI heard what the Assistant Secretary-General\r\nsaid — diversification. As a number of people have\r\nnoted, it is true that Uganda has diversified. We\r\nproduce a lot of things — fish, cotton, and, of course,\r\nflowers. I did not know that people exported flowers,\r\nbecause we in the tropics take flowers for granted. One\r\ndoes not bother with flowers. But when we heard that\r\nflowers were an export, we started to export them.\r\nIndeed, although we are in all those sectors, we\r\nget very little in each one — except for flowers and\r\nfish, because there we have a direct link with the final\r\nconsumer. We process the fish and sell it to the\r\nsupermarket — and we get a reasonable price. But we\r\ndo not get much for the other products, which we\r\nexport as raw materials — even if we diversify. So is\r\ndiversification the answer? Perhaps it is a partial\r\nanswer. The real answer involves not only\r\ndiversification, but also transformation — another\r\nword that I would like to introduce. Instead of just\r\ndiversifying, I say we should transform our economy\r\nso that it adds value to the raw materials. We should\r\ncut out the middleman and link up with the consumer.\r\nIf I add value to coffee — if, instead of just\r\nexporting the berry after removing the husk, I roast and\r\ngrind it — I will get six, seven, eight — even 10 —\r\ntimes as much as I get for just removing the husks. My\r\nproposal, therefore, is that countries should add value\r\nto their products. They should stop exporting materials\r\nin their raw form and should add value. The fund that\r\nis being talked about should be a fund aimed at\r\ntransforming the problem, not just at ensuring\r\ndiversification so that we get richer in cotton, in coffee\r\nor in leather. No — we should transform, and add\r\nvalue. That is my own view.\r\nBut how would that be possible? It would be\r\npossible if we gained access to the big markets of the\r\nWest. The West has big markets. There are 290 million\r\npeople in the United States; we Africans are 800\r\nmillion. Our population is about three times the size of\r\nthe population of the United States. But what is the\r\nmarket of the United States? It is $11 trillion. What is\r\nthe market of the whole of Africa? It is $500 billion. In\r\nother words, those 290 million people consume 21 or\r\n22 times as much as the 800 million people of Africa.\r\nWhy are we consuming so little? Because we have no\r\nmoney in our pockets. It is not that we do not the\r\nstomach — we have the stomach to eat. But we do not\r\nhave the money to buy. Why does someone not have\r\nmoney to buy what he wants, or to buy it in sufficient\r\nquantities? Because he has no job, he is not working.\r\nRemember, the job was donated. If you donated a job,\r\nyou now do not have a job. Since you do not have a\r\njob, you have no money — and if you have no money,\r\nyou cannot consume. So it is a vicious circle. You\r\ncannot consume, because you have no job.\r\nBut what do we do to create jobs for these\r\npeople — for these 800 million Africans? If you buy\r\nwhat they produce, especially if you buy — not the raw\r\nmaterial, but the finished product — you will be\r\nhelping Africans in a number of ways. First, they\r\nwould get jobs — spinning or weaving, to refer to my\r\nearlier example of cotton, although that model can be\r\nreplicated across the board. Once they had jobs, they\r\nwould have money; and once they had money, they\r\nwould consume. You would find that the African\r\nmarket was also empowered, and that would be\r\nadvantageous to the United States, Europe and Japan,\r\nbecause they would then export back to Africa, and\r\nAfrica would be a very big market for them. In fact, it\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.53\r\ncould be said that Africa is the last emerging market.\r\nWe have been talking about emerging markets. All\r\nthose 800 million people are waiting to buy on a big\r\nscale — to buy televisions, more textiles, more food\r\nfor themselves.\r\nI would like to provide an example of what I am\r\ntalking about. Uganda produces a lot of milk from\r\ncows. In fact, we now have an over-supply of milk, and\r\nnowhere to send it. According to the World Health\r\nOrganization, each one of us is supposed to drink 200\r\nlitres of milk per annum to take care of our bones and\r\nto make sure that our teeth do not fall out. But how\r\nmuch milk are Ugandans currently consuming? They\r\nare consuming only 30 litres per annum. That is why\r\nwe have a number of dental problems — because we do\r\nnot drink enough milk. Why are Ugandans drinking\r\nonly 30 litres of milk? It is not that they do not like\r\nmilk, but that they do not have the money to buy it. So\r\nwe have a problem. There is over-supply and under-\r\nconsumption of milk in the same country. All of that is\r\nbecause there are no jobs.\r\nI apologize for coming here in such an impromptu\r\nmanner — but no harm done. It has been good to have\r\na chat. I would like to conclude by saying that, in my\r\nview, the way to solve the problem of raw materials is\r\nto transform the economies that depend on raw\r\nmaterials so that they become industrial economies.\r\nBefore coming here, I tried to remind myself of my old\r\neconomics studies and the evolution of economic\r\nthought. Many years ago — about three centuries\r\nago — there was a school of economic thought, in\r\nFrance in particular, known as the physiocrats. This\r\nwas at a time when economic thought was evolving.\r\nOriginally, there were the bullionists, who believed in\r\namassing gold and so forth, and the mercantilists, who\r\nbelieved in trade. Then a school of thought emerged in\r\nFrance called the physiocrats, and for some time they\r\nwere in competition with the mercantilists — until\r\nAdam Smith came along and helped to advance the\r\nknowledge of economics when he pointed out the need\r\nfor, in particular, specialization and the division of\r\nlabour.\r\nNow it seems that we in Africa are still behaving\r\nas if we were the physiocrats of 300 years ago — a\r\nlong time ago. Because you cannot have an economy\r\nthat is based on agriculture alone — on raw materials,\r\nagriculture and, to some extent, minerals. That is a big\r\nmistake. We must have an integrated economy based\r\non industry, agriculture and mining, linked together and\r\nproducing for the export of goods and services. That is\r\nwhat we need. We need diversification, but that\r\ndiversification must lead to the transformation of our\r\neconomies.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Uganda for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the\r\nRepublic of Uganda, was escorted from the\r\nConference Room.\r\nThe President: I sincerely wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Uganda for his\r\nenlightening and thought-provoking presentation on the\r\nissue of commodities, which is so critical to the well-\r\nbeing of the developing world. He spoke eloquently,\r\nopenly and frankly about the vicissitudes and changes\r\nthat commodity-dependent countries face. But\r\nimportantly, he also commented on what was needed to\r\nredress the situation.\r\nThe President made an interesting point which\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly small countries like\r\nmine, need to take into consideration: diversification\r\nalone, can get us nowhere. Diversification with a view\r\nto transforming an economy is what will eventually\r\nlead us out of the box that we find ourselves in. He also\r\nmade an interesting point that it is about time that we\r\nsaw ourselves differently. He pointed to the concept of\r\nvalue-added and what that means, which, to our peril,\r\nis something we have ignored for years — even\r\ncenturies.\r\nAs we discuss this issue at this particular time,\r\nwe must go beyond traditional ways of thinking about\r\nsolutions to the problem; we must think more\r\nindependently in terms of how we can take ourselves\r\nout of this morass.\r\nI am certain the United Nations will remain\r\nseized of this issue to ensure that developing countries\r\nwill not be compelled to continue to run faster and\r\nfaster in order to remain in the same place, to remain at\r\nthe same level, or rate of development, due to factors\r\nbeyond their control.\r\nLet me thank other members of the panel, the\r\nDeputy Secretary-General and the President of the\r\nTrade and Development Board of the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development for their\r\ninvaluable contributions. I would also like to thank the\r\nChairman of the Second Committee for being present\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.53\r\nat these proceedings and commend him for the\r\ncontinued valuable work that he is doing in the\r\nCommittee.\r\nThank you all very much for your presence, and\r\nGod bless.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.45 p.m.\r\n"
