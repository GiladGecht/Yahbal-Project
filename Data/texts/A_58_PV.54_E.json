Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 29\r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/287)\r\nDraft resolution A/58/L.4\r\nMr. De Alba (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nMexico comes to this highest international forum to\r\nreiterate its rejection of the application of unilateral\r\nlaws or measures imposing an economic blockade\r\nagainst any nation. My country, moreover, has always\r\nrejected the use of coercive measures as a means of\r\napplying pressure in international relations.\r\nMexico bases its foreign relations on the\r\nprinciples of international law that govern the\r\nfellowship among nations, and which are also\r\nenshrined in our Constitution. These principles include\r\nthe self-determination of peoples, non-intervention, the\r\npeaceful resolution of disputes, the prohibition of the\r\nthreat or use of force, the legal equality of States,\r\ninternational cooperation in development and the\r\nstruggle to achieve international peace and security.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Mexican\r\nGovernment has unequivocally voiced its rejection of\r\nthe imposition of political, economic or military\r\nsanctions that have not been explicitly approved by the\r\nSecurity Council or by the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation has rejected the economic, trade\r\nand financial blockade imposed unilaterally against\r\nCuba and has for more than a decade now consistently\r\nsupported all resolutions adopted by the General\r\nAssembly regarding the need to end that blockade.\r\nMy country believes that the Helms-Burton Act is\r\ncontrary to the norms of international law, a position\r\nthat is in full accord with the opinion of the Inter-\r\nAmerican Juridical Committee of the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, issued on 4 June 1996.\r\nFor that reason, Mexico promulgated an Act to\r\nprotect trade and investment from foreign norms that\r\ncontravene international law, which came into force on\r\n24 October 1996, in order to check the adverse\r\nextraterritorial impact of foreign norms that impinge\r\nupon Mexico’s free trade with other countries and\r\nwhich violate international law to the detriment of any\r\nState.\r\nIn August 1999, Mexico supported Cuba’s\r\nmembership in the Latin American Integration\r\nAssociation and, in May 2001, signed an agreement\r\nwith that country for the promotion and reciprocal\r\nprotection of investments, among other measures.\r\nMore recently, at a meeting on joint cooperation\r\nfor development between Mexico and Cuba, held on 14\r\nand 15 October in Mexico City, a programme of\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\ntechnical and scientific cooperation was established for\r\nthe period 2003 to 2005.\r\nThe blockade against Cuba must be brought to an\r\nend. Over the last decade, the General Assembly has\r\nexhorted Member States on repeated occasions to\r\nrefrain from promulgating and applying laws and\r\nmeasures of an extraterritorial nature. At the current\r\nsession of the General Assembly, Mexico, for the\r\ntwelfth time, will renew its support for the resolution\r\ncalling for the lifting of the blockade against Cuba, as\r\nunilateral measures adversely affecting the sovereignty\r\nand trade freedom of States are in contravention of my\r\ncountry’s foreign policy and the spirit of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations. In accord with our steadfast\r\nposition of principle, and as we have been doing since\r\n1992, Mexico will vote in favour of draft resolution\r\ncontained in document A/58/L.4.\r\nMr. Aboutahir (Morocco) (spoke in French):\r\nThe Group of 77, at their first summit in Havana in\r\n2000, called for the end of the economic embargo\r\nagainst Cuba. In this context, I would like, on behalf of\r\nthe Group of 77 and China, to reiterate the position of\r\nthe Group of 77 on the agenda item before us today,\r\nentitled “Necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”.\r\nWe have read the report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/58/287) on this item. As already emphasized at past\r\nsessions of the General Assembly by the Chairman of\r\nthe Group of 77, it is important to highlight the fact\r\nthat the economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nimposed against Cuba is a unilateral act, the\r\nextraterritorial effects of which have no validity in\r\ninternational law. It is therefore necessary that the\r\nembargo be lifted to allow a free flow of international\r\ntrade.\r\nThe South Summit of the Group of 77 held in\r\nApril 2000 expressed its conviction that national laws\r\nshould not have extraterritorial applicability. While\r\nunderlining the importance of North-South relations,\r\nthe Group of 77 and China would like to reiterate the\r\nfollowing points made at the South Summit.\r\nFirst, that the elimination of laws and regulations\r\nwith adverse extraterritorial effects and other forms of\r\nunilateral economic coercive measures is imperative, as\r\nthey are inconsistent with the principles of\r\ninternational law, the United Nations Charter and the\r\nprinciples of the multilateral trading system.\r\nSecondly, the Group of 77 reiterates its concern\r\nabout the impact of economic sanctions on the civilian\r\npopulation and the development capacity of targeted\r\ncountries. It therefore calls on the international\r\ncommunity to exhaust all possible peaceful methods of\r\ndialogue before resorting to sanctions, which should\r\nonly be considered as a last resort. If there is no\r\nalternative to sanctions, then sanctions may only be\r\nimposed in strict conformity with the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. In addition, sanctions must contain\r\nclear objectives, time frames and provisions for regular\r\nreview, along with precise conditions for their lifting,\r\nand must never be used as punishment or other form of\r\nretribution.\r\nThirdly, the Group of 77 would like to recall the\r\nSouth Summit’s sincere appeal to the Government of\r\nthe United States of America to lift the economic\r\nembargo imposed on the Republic of Cuba since 1960.\r\nThat embargo, which has gone on far too long, serves\r\nno other purpose than to preserve a state of tension\r\nbetween two neighbouring countries and to impose\r\nuntold hardship and suffering on the people of Cuba,\r\nespecially its women and children.\r\nFinally, the South Summit emphasized its\r\nconviction that replacing the embargo with renewed\r\ndialogue and cooperation would undoubtedly\r\ncontribute not only towards the removal of tension\r\nbetween the two countries, but would also promote\r\nmeaningful exchanges and partnerships between those\r\ncountries, already closely linked by history and\r\ngeography and a common destiny.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nResolutions have been adopted by the General\r\nAssembly for 11 consecutive years urging all countries\r\nto comply with the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nthe principles enshrined in international legal\r\ninstruments by repealing or invalidating all laws and\r\nmeasures with extraterritorial effects that impinge on\r\nthe sovereignty of other States, the legitimate interests\r\nof entities or persons under their jurisdiction and\r\nfreedom of trade and navigation. Regrettably, the\r\ncountry concerned, continuing to ignore the just\r\ndemand of the international community, has failed to\r\nimplement those resolutions.\r\nTo force a country to give up its independently\r\nchosen road of development, even attempting to\r\noverthrow its Government by means of embargoes and\r\nsanctions, runs counter to the purposes and principles\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the\r\nbasic norms guiding international relations. It is also a\r\ndistortion and violation of the principle of democracy.\r\nThe embargo and sanctions imposed by the\r\nUnited States against Cuba have been going on for\r\nmore than 40 years. The United States claims that these\r\nmeasures are designed to improve so-called democracy\r\nand human rights. In reality, those measures have\r\nseriously constrained Cuba in its nation-building\r\nefforts to eradicate poverty, improve the living standard\r\nof its people and promote economic and social\r\ndevelopment. The result is a grave violation of the\r\nfundamental freedoms and human rights of the Cuban\r\npeople, including the right to life and development.\r\nThe extraterritorial effects of the financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States against Cuba\r\nviolates international law and the principles, objectives\r\nand rules of international trade. It also runs counter to\r\nthe principle of free trade encouraged by the United\r\nStates itself. Currently, 78 countries have suffered\r\neconomic losses as a result of the embargo. The\r\ninternational community should be seriously concerned\r\nabout the embargo and sanctions and demand their\r\nimmediate end.\r\nThe sovereign equality of States and the principle\r\nof non-interference in their internal affairs are at the\r\nheart of the norms guiding present-day international\r\nrelations. It has been the consistent position of the\r\nChinese Government that the purposes and principles\r\nof the Charter of the United Nations must be adhered to\r\nin efforts to promote the democratization of\r\ninternational laws. Acts such as the rich bullying the\r\npoor and the strong bullying the weak are certainly not\r\nacceptable to the international community.\r\nWe believe that it is the inviolable sovereign right\r\nof all countries to choose their political and social\r\nsystems and mode of development and to administer\r\ntheir internal affairs in accordance with their national\r\nsituation. Differences between States should be\r\nresolved through dialogue and cooperation on the basis\r\nof equality and mutual respect. For this reason, the\r\nChinese Government opposes the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States against Cuba. We support the Cuban\r\nGovernment and people in their endeavour to safeguard\r\nnational independence and State sovereignty.\r\nWhile it claims to be a democratic country that\r\nlistens to the will of the people, in fact, for 11 years the\r\nUnited States has acted against the will of the people\r\nand the will of the international community. It is our\r\nhope that the United States will keep pace with the\r\ntimes, replacing confrontation with dialogue, embargo\r\nand sanctions with communication and exchange, and\r\nearnestly implement the relevant resolutions of the\r\nUnited Nations. China supports the draft resolution\r\nsubmitted by Cuba under the current agenda item.\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): I have the honour to speak\r\ntoday on behalf of the 14 member States of the\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) that are members\r\nof the United Nations, namely, Antigua and Barbuda,\r\nBahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada,\r\nGuyana, Haiti, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and\r\nTobago and my own country, Jamaica. We join with\r\nthose who have spoken before in supporting the need to\r\nbring to an end the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States against Cuba.\r\nWe are greatly concerned at its detrimental effects on\r\nthe Cuban people.\r\nThe CARICOM States wish to reaffirm the\r\nimportance that we attach to the strict observance of\r\nthe principles of international law and to freedom of\r\ntrade and navigation. We remain opposed to the\r\nextraterritorial application of national legislation that\r\nseeks to impose artificial barriers to trade and\r\ncooperation, and which is contrary to the principle of\r\nthe sovereign equality of States.\r\nOur member States, in keeping with our policy of\r\nmutual respect, good-neighbourliness and respect for\r\nthe principles of the United Nations Charter, maintain\r\nfriendly relations with Cuba and with the United States\r\nof America, with whom we have mutually beneficial\r\nprogrammes of cooperation and trade.\r\nIn accordance with the fundamental principles\r\nthat guide the foreign policy of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity, the foreign ministers of CARICOM, at\r\ntheir meeting in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in\r\nMay 2003, reaffirmed that engaging Cuba and pursuing\r\ndialogue with its Government at the highest level are in\r\nthe best interests of the Cuban people.\r\nAccordingly, we reiterate our call for a\r\nconstructive process of dialogue and normalization of\r\nrelations, which we believe would be in the interests of\r\nall parties. For us in the Caribbean, it would remove a\r\nsource of tension and conflict and improve the climate\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nfor peaceful development and cooperation in our\r\nregion.\r\nThe CARICOM delegations support the contents\r\nof the draft resolution that is before the General\r\nAssembly in A/58/L.4 and we will vote in favour of its\r\nadoption.\r\nMr. Rastam (Malaysia): Malaysia is\r\nfundamentally opposed to all forms of unilateral\r\neconomic, commercial and financial sanctions and\r\nembargoes. Malaysia therefore joins the rest of the\r\ninternational community in calling, yet again, for an\r\nimmediate end to the embargo imposed by the United\r\nStates on Cuba and its people.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General entitled\r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba”, contained in document\r\nA/58/287, has clearly shown that many countries do\r\nnot agree with the policy carried out by the United\r\nStates. Malaysia shares their views.\r\nFor many years now, this Assembly has\r\nconsistently adopted, by an overwhelming majority,\r\nresolutions calling for an immediate end to the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States against Cuba. The adoption of\r\nsuch a resolution has clearly and unambiguously shown\r\nthe international community’s total rejection of the\r\nunilateral action taken by the United States against\r\nCuba. The policy adopted by the most powerful nation\r\nin the world against its small neighbour is most\r\nperplexing. This policy is said to be intended to bring\r\nabout a peaceful transition to democracy. Yet the\r\nprolonged economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo has caused untold suffering to the Cuban\r\npopulation, particularly the elderly, women and\r\ninnocent children. In spite of Cuba’s well-known\r\nresilience and valiant efforts at ensuring its survival as\r\nan independent and sovereign nation, the sanctions\r\nhave seriously impeded Cuba’s socio-economic\r\ndevelopment potential. It has affected the Cuban\r\npeople’s material, social and cultural well-being.\r\nThis unilateral policy of the United States runs\r\ncounter to the spirit of the Charter of the United\r\nNations. It has completely ignored the current trend\r\ntowards calls for increased understanding and dialogue\r\namong nations and civilizations. Malaysia reiterates its\r\nstrong belief that, even in the most difficult of\r\nsituations, differences among nations could be better\r\nresolved through dialogue and negotiations, rather than\r\nthrough isolation and direct confrontation. Therefore,\r\nwe urge the United States to end the policy and engage\r\nin serious dialogue to resolve its problems with Cuba.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) has also\r\nconsistently reiterated the developing countries’\r\ncollective rejection of this policy. NAM has expressed\r\nits deep concern at the extraterritorial application of\r\nlaws, in particular the Helms-Burton Act of 1996, on\r\nCuba and the other legislative measures designed to\r\nintensify the blockade. Consistent with this position,\r\nMalaysia joined other NAM member countries at the\r\nthirteenth Conference of Heads of State or Government\r\nof NAM in Kuala Lumpur in February 2003 to call\r\nupon the Government of the United States of America\r\nto put an end to the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba.\r\nThe application of laws by the United States,\r\nwhich are intended to, inter alia, restrict Cuba’s access\r\nto much-needed markets, capital, technology and\r\ninvestment, in order to exert pressure on Cuba to\r\nchange its political and economic system or\r\norientation, is not consistent with the universally\r\naccepted principles of international law, the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations, World Trade Organization\r\nprinciples and relevant United Nations resolutions. It is\r\ndiscriminatory in nature and undermines the principles\r\nof sovereign equality of States, fundamental human\r\nrights and good-neighbourliness among States.\r\nThe economic blockade against Cuba is indeed a\r\nviolation of international law. It also violates the right\r\nof the people of Cuba to life, to well-being and to\r\ndevelopment. The embargo has no doubt caused\r\ntremendous economic damage and aggravated the\r\nplight of the Cuban people.\r\nMalaysia once again reaffirms its commitment to\r\nthe respect for fundamental principles of sovereign\r\nequality among States, non-interference in their\r\ninternal affairs and freedom of international trade and\r\nnavigation. My delegation urges the international\r\ncommunity to continue with its efforts to bring about\r\nan early end to the unilateral economic, commercial\r\nand financial embargo against Cuba. We sincerely\r\nappeal to the United States to heed the voice of many\r\nnations, which do not favour its unilateral policy and\r\naction.\r\nIn support of the principles of international law,\r\nthe United Nations Charter and the promotion of\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nfreedom of trade, Malaysia, as in the previous years,\r\nwill vote in favour of the draft resolution that will be\r\nintroduced by His Excellency the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Cuba.\r\nMr. Siv (United States of America) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): As it has done in past years, the Government\r\nof Cuba has introduced a draft resolution on the trade\r\nembargo of the United States against Cuba whereby it\r\nintends to affix blame upon the United States for the\r\neconomic difficulties Cuba has encountered and to\r\ndistract attention from its deplorable track record in\r\nhuman rights.\r\nWe stand firmly opposed to this resolution.\r\nWhatever opinion one may have about the embargo, it\r\nmust be clear that this is a bilateral issue between the\r\nUnited States and Cuba. It is important to bear in mind\r\nthat the embargoes were imposed after the illegal large-\r\nscale expropriation of United States properties for\r\nwhich the Cuban Government has never offered any\r\nindemnification whatsoever. This embargo has been\r\nreaffirmed by successive United States Administrations\r\nwith a view to keeping the pressure on for restoring\r\ndemocracy in Cuba. This is not a blockade, as Havana\r\nasserts in its official pronouncements, inasmuch as it\r\ndoes not affect trade with other nations. Cuba is free to\r\ntrade with any other country in the world, a freedom\r\nwhich, indeed, it is exercising. Moreover, over 175,000\r\nUnited States citizens travelled legally to Cuba last\r\nyear, using regular airline services linking the United\r\nStates and Cuba.\r\nThe truth is that what adversely affects Cuba’s\r\ntrade with other countries is not the embargo, but its\r\nlack of credit solvency, which in turn stems from the\r\nfact that it does not pay its debts and owes billions of\r\ndollars in loans and arrears. It is not the embargo, but\r\nrather the failed economic policy of the communist\r\nregime that has brought trouble to Cubans and has\r\ndestroyed what used to be one of the most advanced\r\neconomies in the region.\r\nA study carried out jointly with the Cuban\r\nResearch Institute and the Economic Commission for\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) has reached\r\nthe conclusion that Cuba, to restore its battered\r\neconomy, must relax the restrictions it is imposing on\r\nsmall businesses. In order to achieve effective growth,\r\nCuba must deregulate, something Castro cannot do\r\nwithout giving up his authority over decision-making.\r\nWe have offered to modify the embargo in exchange\r\nfor reforms. In May 2002, the United States challenged\r\nCastro’s Government to undertake political and\r\neconomic reform, particularly to permit free and fair\r\nelections to the National Assembly. We also are urging\r\nthe Cuban Government to dare to open its economy, to\r\nallow independent trade unions, and to put an end to\r\npractices that discriminate against Cuban workers.\r\nPresident Bush has stated clearly that, if these\r\nspecific reforms were to be carried out, he would\r\nprevail upon Congress to alleviate restrictions on trade\r\nand travel between the United States and Cuba. Far\r\nfrom initiating a political opening, however, the Cuban\r\nGovernment carried out a brutal repression in March\r\n2003, sentencing 75 opposition militants, including\r\nrepresentatives of the independent media, economists,\r\ntrade union members and human rights activists, to\r\nsentences ranging up to 28 years in prison.\r\nA variety of acts of political repression have\r\nstruck down those who have militated for peaceful\r\nchange throughout the period of this Cuban\r\nadministration. Havana has shown no interest in\r\ncarrying out the necessary economic and political\r\nreforms. Castro remains obstinately opposed to any\r\npolitical opening and continues to deprive the Cuban\r\npeople of the most elementary of human rights as\r\nrecognized in the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights.\r\nThe Cuban Government characterizes support for\r\nthis draft resolution as tantamount to support of its\r\nregime and repressive policies, as it has done during\r\npast years. For all these reasons, the United States\r\nstands firmly opposed to this mistaken draft resolution.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn the 1980s, President Reagan reflected on\r\nUnited States — Soviet relations by using a Russian\r\nsaying “trust, but verify”. On Communists and\r\ndictators like those in Havana, I say “never trust,\r\nalways verify”. The best day for Cuba is the day when\r\nthe Cuban people open their ears and hear the truth,\r\nwhen they open their eyes and see freedom, when they\r\nopen their mouths and say “Viva Cuba libre”. Cuba’s\r\nbest day is when the Cuban people have terminated\r\nCastro’s evil communist dictatorial regime and said to\r\nhim “hasta la vista, baby”.\r\nMr. Nguyen Thanh Chau (Viet Nam): The\r\nGovernment of Viet Nam consistently pursues a\r\nforeign policy based on the principles of respect for the\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nindependence, sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity\r\nand national identity of all nations. We support the\r\nlegitimate right of every State to exist, free from\r\nexternal interference, subversion or coercion. We stand\r\nfor non-interference in the internal affairs of one\r\nanother, settlement of differences or disputes by\r\npeaceful means and renouncing the threat or use of\r\nforce.\r\nIn this spirit and from our firsthand experience,\r\nthe delegation of Viet Nam has frequently joined others\r\nin this forum and elsewhere in voicing our consistent\r\nand vehement opposition to the use of sanctions for\r\nwhatever reason or pretext against any sovereign State.\r\nThe political motive of undermining a State is legally\r\nand morally wrong, and more often than not proves to\r\nbe a failure. Sanctions, blockades and embargoes only\r\nbring suffering to bear upon innocent people,\r\nparticularly old people, women and children.\r\nWhile welcoming the recent lifting of sanctions\r\nagainst other countries, we cannot help wondering why\r\nthe unilateral embargo against Cuba has not been\r\nlifted? If economic damage was the intention, the\r\nobjective has been achieved. The embargo continues to\r\naffect the economic development and social well-being\r\nof the Cuban people and has caused significant losses\r\nof approximately $72 billion in all sectors of the Cuban\r\neconomy. After more than four decades of existence, it\r\ncould be entered in the Guinness Book of Records as\r\nthe longest-lasting embargo in human history.\r\nAgain the question is why? Is the Republic of\r\nCuba a security threat to its big neighbour? Are the 11\r\nmillion Cuban people on that tiny island able to do\r\nharm to the world’s hyper-Power? The answer is\r\nobviously “no”. In 1959, the Cuban people stood up as\r\none and rid themselves of foreign domination. They\r\ntook their destiny in their own hands and exercised\r\ntheir right to self-determination. Through the long\r\nyears of hardships, attacks — a total of 700 in the 14\r\nmonths from November 1961 to January 1963 —\r\nthreats and harassment from the outside, the Cuban\r\npeople have stayed the course of development, holding\r\ntheir heads high, building a system of which they can\r\nbe proud. Cuba has 70,000 doctors, of which more than\r\n3,000 famous ones are helping other developing\r\ncountries. Child mortality has been reduced from the\r\nrate of 60 per 1,000 before 1959 to 6.5 per 1,000.\r\nEducation is free and universal. We warmly salute the\r\nachievements that they have recorded in the last 40\r\nyears.\r\nAll the peace-, freedom- and justice-loving\r\npeoples in the world whole-heartedly support the\r\npeople and Government of Cuba in their national\r\nconstruction and defence. The most eloquent evidence\r\nof that is manifested by the fact that the item entitled\r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba” has been on the working\r\nagenda of the General Assembly every year since its\r\nforty-sixth session and has consistently received the\r\nsupport of the overwhelming majority of Member\r\nStates, as well as that of many other international\r\norganizations and agencies, as reflected in the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General (A/58/287). Recently, at the\r\nXXV Assembly of the Latin American Council of\r\nSocial Sciences, which ended on 31 October 2003, 25\r\nmember States of the Council addressed an open letter\r\nto Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressing their\r\ndemand that the blockade and embargo against Cuba\r\nshould be put to an immediate end. We share the view\r\nthat this 43-year-long embargo, with the extraterritorial\r\napplication of domestic law against the tiny island, not\r\nonly contravenes international law and the most basic\r\nnorms of international relations but flagrantly violates\r\nthe fundamental purposes and principles enshrined in\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations as well.\r\nViet Nam holds the view that the dispute between\r\nthe United States of America and the Republic of Cuba\r\nshould be resolved through dialogue and negotiations\r\non the basis of mutual respect, respect for\r\nindependence and sovereignty and non-intervention\r\nand non-interference in the internal affairs of States.\r\nAlthough, as the old saying goes, “thick ice is not due\r\nto just one cold day”, the dispute and mistrust between\r\nthe two countries cannot simply be allowed to wait to\r\nbe resolved; it requires goodwill and, above all,\r\ndetermination on the part of the United States\r\nAdministration. In that vein, we welcome every effort\r\nto that effect by the parties concerned.\r\nI wish to reiterate my Government’s continued\r\nand unwavering support, cooperation and solidarity\r\nwith the people and Government of Cuba. We will vote\r\nin favour of the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/58/L.4 and hope that the United Nations will\r\nundertake concrete measures and initiatives so that the\r\nadopted resolution will be implemented in order to put\r\nan end to the hostile policies and acts against the\r\nRepublic of Cuba. The longer the embargo goes on, the\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nmore suffering the people of Cuba must bear. Not a\r\nsingle person of conscience can accept that prospect.\r\nTo this day, I remember my father’s words spoken\r\nmore than 50 years ago. He said, “Son, if you cannot\r\nlove, do not just hate because hate brings mutual\r\nsuffering — but you are the first to suffer”. I wish to\r\nshare this in the spirit of the commandment to love thy\r\nneighbour, drawn straight from the Holy Bible, as I\r\nbelieve love is always reciprocal.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Cuba, Mr. Felipe Pérez Roque,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/58/L.4.\r\nMr. Pérez Roque (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade imposed\r\nby the United States of America against Cuba must be\r\nlifted. Under the 1948 Geneva Convention, the\r\nblockade against Cuba qualifies as a crime of genocide.\r\nThe blockade is a legal aberration. It violates the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. It is detrimental to\r\ninternational trade and hinders free navigation. It goes\r\nso far as to penalize entrepreneurs from other countries\r\nfor investing in Cuba.\r\nThe crude and disrespectful tone used in this Hall\r\njust minutes ago by the representative of the United\r\nStates compels me to depart from my text. I can\r\nunderstand the murmuring in the Hall that followed his\r\ncrude remarks. I believe that so low and disrespectful\r\nan attack can only be the result of the desperation and\r\nisolation of the Government of the United States in its\r\npolicy towards Cuba. The representative of the United\r\nStates showed a lack of respect and indulged in\r\npersonal attacks. But Cuba does not emulate such\r\nmethods. It does not try to hide the lack of arguments\r\nby using disrespectful adjectives. It does not use empty\r\nepithets in place of arguments. I must therefore assure\r\nthe Assembly that the representative of the United\r\nStates has lied, and I will prove it. It is my duty to\r\ndenounce those lies because the Assembly has the right\r\nto know the truth. The Assembly deserves respect,\r\nwhich means that the representatives of countries\r\nshould behave in the Hall in accordance with the\r\nminimum rules of respect and good manners. I counted\r\n15 lies or disrespectful attacks, on which I will\r\ncomment briefly. I cannot fail to take the opportunity to\r\nreject them.\r\nFirst, the representative of the United States has\r\nsaid that the embargo against Cuba is justified on the\r\nbasis of what he has called Cuba’s regrettable human\r\nrights record. That is a lie. The United States does not\r\nhave the moral authority or the right to judge the\r\nhuman rights situation in Cuba. It should attend to its\r\nown situation. It should deal with the human rights\r\nviolations that take place in its own country and the\r\nones it provokes outside its border.\r\nSecondly, he has said that the embargo against\r\nCuba is a bilateral affair. That is a lie. The embargo\r\nimpedes business with and investments in Cuba around\r\nthe world through the application of the Torricelli and\r\nHelms-Burton Acts, which I will address later in my\r\nstatement.\r\nThirdly, he has said that the embargo was\r\nestablished after the expropriations. That is a lie. The\r\nmeasures of the economic embargo and other forms of\r\neconomic war against Cuba date back before the\r\nnationalization that was justly undertaken by the Cuban\r\nrevolution.\r\nFourthly, he has said that Cuba did not offer\r\ncompensation. That is a lie. The Cuban nationalization\r\nlaws established compensation. In fact, that\r\ncompensation was accepted by all foreign owners in\r\nCuba, including Europeans, Canadians and Latin\r\nAmericans; everyone except for citizens of the United\r\nStates, whose Government prohibited them from\r\naccepting compensation.\r\nFifthly, he has said that the embargo is aimed at\r\nbringing freedom and democracy to Cuba. That is a lie.\r\nThe embargo is aimed at turning Cuba back into a\r\ncolony of the United States.\r\nHe has also said that last year, 175,000 United\r\nStates citizens travelled legally to Cuba. That is a lie. A\r\nmajority of them did so in violation of their own\r\ncountry’s laws. Moreover, if the United States is not\r\nafraid of them travelling to Cuba — because the\r\nGovernment does not allow it — then why are there\r\nnow more than 2,000 American citizens facing legal\r\nproceedings?\r\nHe has said that Cuba does not pay its debts. That\r\nis a lie.\r\nHe has said that the poverty of the Cuban people\r\nis not a result of the embargo, and that the embargo is\r\nnot an obstacle. He has lied. On the other hand, it is\r\ntrue that we are a poor third-world country, but there is\r\nnot one Cuban citizen who lacks medical care, as is the\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\ncase in the United States, where there are 44 million\r\npeople who have no right to health-care services.\r\nHe has said that brutal repression was imposed in\r\nCuba. In keeping with Cuban laws, mercenaries who\r\nreceive money from the United States and who work\r\nthere for the embargo and to promote subversion have\r\nbeen punished.\r\nHe has referred to the President of Cuba, the\r\nleader Fidel Castro, as a dictator. This Assembly knows\r\nvery well that the Government of the United States and\r\nPresident Bush are attempting to impose a fascist\r\ndictatorship on a global scale.\r\nFinally, he has referred to the Cuban Government\r\nas an evil and dictatorial regime, to which it wanted to\r\nsay “Hasta la vista, baby”. Never have such\r\ndisrespectful words been heard in this Assembly. Cuba\r\naccepts the possibility of differences of opinion,\r\ndiffering arguments and different ideologies. But it\r\nbelieves there should be a minimum of respect shown\r\nto the delegates and countries represented here.\r\nI regret that the representative of the United\r\nStates will not have in his entire lifetime the right or\r\nthe slightest opportunity to say “Hasta la vista, baby”\r\nto the people of Cuba. It is the people of Cuba, with the\r\nsupport of the international community, who will say\r\n“Hasta la vista to the blockade; hasta la vista to\r\ngenocide”. And in response to his disrespectful\r\ncomments, we are not going to say “Hasta la vista” to\r\nour leader, our President; what we are going to say to\r\nhim is “Patria o muerte; venceremos”.\r\nI will continue my statement to state that the\r\nembargo is a flagrant, massive and systematic violation\r\nof the human rights of the Cuban people. The only\r\nhuman rights violations committed in Cuba are the\r\nones generated and provoked against our people by the\r\nembargo and the ones committed by the United States\r\nat the Guantanamo Naval Base, which it occupies\r\nagainst our will on our territory. It is also deleterious to\r\nthe rights of United States citizens, the rights of\r\nCubans living in the United States and the rights of\r\nnationals of other countries who wish to trade with and\r\ninvest freely in Cuba.\r\nI am not saying a single word from this rostrum\r\nagainst the people of the United States, who we\r\nconsider as friends, who we do not blame. We believe\r\nthat the people of the United States are also victims,\r\nlike us, of a cruel, senseless policy pursued by its\r\nGovernment. I do not blame the people; I blame their\r\nGovernment, which subordinates its policy on Cuba to\r\nthe corrupt interests of a minority of Cuban-born\r\nmobsters living in the city of Miami.\r\nThe embargo is the greatest obstacle to Cuba’s\r\nsocial and economic development, and I reaffirm that\r\nhere, refuting the claims of the representative of the\r\nUnited States. It has caused our country the loss of\r\nmore than $72 billion, no less than $1.6 billion per\r\nyear, in addition to the aggression, the invasions and\r\nthe more than 600 assassination plots against our head\r\nof State. How many shortages and hardships would we\r\nhave been spared without the embargo? How much\r\nfarther would Cuba have gone in its noble endeavour of\r\nequality and social justice had it not had to deal with\r\nthis ruthless and relentless blockade for more than four\r\ndecades?\r\nIf the Government of the United States is so\r\ncertain that the Cuban Government and authorities —\r\nthe historic leadership of the Cuban Revolution — do\r\nnot have the support of the people, then why does it not\r\nlift the embargo? If it says that we are using it as a\r\npretext, then why does it not take that pretext away\r\nfrom us? Why does it not lift the embargo? Why does it\r\nnot allow United States citizens to visit Cuba?\r\nThe embargo is a cruel and absurd policy that has\r\nno support within or outside the United States. Last\r\nyear, 173 Member States voted against the embargo in\r\nthe General Assembly. They understand that the crime\r\nbeing committed against Cuba today could very well be\r\ncommitted against any other country tomorrow.\r\nThe notion that the Cubans who are living in the\r\nUnited States support the embargo is erroneous; I state\r\nthat here. Only a corrupt and greedy minority that has\r\nnot hesitated to organize and carry out terrorist actions\r\nagainst our people is interested in keeping the embargo\r\nin place. This minority dreams of Cuba’s return to the\r\nhands of United States troops; it dreams of revenge and\r\npillage. President Bush — and the truth must be told in\r\nthis Hall — is hostage to the spurious interests of that\r\nCuban minority living in Miami. He owes them the\r\npresidency, controversially won in 2000 by the close\r\nmargin of one vote in the United States Supreme Court.\r\nThe President of Cuba was re-elected in our\r\nNational Assembly, made up of representatives elected\r\nby direct and secret ballot, throughout the entire\r\ncountry, in elections in which more than 95 per cent of\r\nthe population participated. The President of the United\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nStates was declared President by the Supreme Court in\r\nthe midst of a scandal that left the country leaderless\r\nfor more than a month.\r\nHowever, a growing mass — increasingly less\r\nsilent and more active — objects to this policy that\r\ncurtails normal relations with their families and with\r\nCuba.\r\nThe United States must recognize that the\r\nembargo is morally and ethically unjustifiable. It must\r\nrecognize that it is a failure, that it causes its own\r\nisolation. We Cubans, far from surrendering, are more\r\nsteadfast and independent; far from dividing, we have\r\nunited; far from feeling discouraged, we have found\r\nnew strength to defend our sovereignty and our right to\r\nfreedom.\r\nThe United States must repeal the Helms-Burton\r\nAct. It has no right to impose its laws on the rest of the\r\nworld. It has no right to dictate to Cubans how their\r\ncountry should be organized. It has no right to finance\r\nand organize subversion in Cuba. It has no right to\r\nsanction entrepreneurs from other countries for having\r\nties with Cuba.\r\nThe United States must repeal the Torricelli Act.\r\nIt has no right to prevent vessels from other countries\r\nfrom calling on Cuban ports. It has no right to prohibit\r\nthe subsidiaries of United States companies based in\r\nthird countries from trading with Cuba, especially since\r\nthat prohibition is in violation of the laws of those\r\ncountries in which the companies are domiciled.\r\nThe United States must allow Cuba to export to\r\nits territory. There is no reason for closing off our\r\nexports of sugar, nickel, tobacco, seafood, vaccines and\r\nbiotech products, computer software and other Cuban\r\nproducts.\r\nThe United States must allow Cuba to import\r\nfreely from its territory, and not only foodstuffs, but\r\neverything else as well, except for weapons in which\r\nwe are not interested. It must eliminate the absurd\r\nrestrictions that currently hinder and considerably\r\nrestrict the sales of farm produce to Cuba.\r\nThe United States must allow its citizens to travel\r\nfreely to Cuba. Why is the United States\r\nAdministration chasing after them? Is it by any chance\r\nafraid that they may learn the truth? It is not ridiculous\r\nto go after a grandmother going to Cuba to ride on her\r\nbicycle? Why does the representative of the United\r\nStates not explain in this Hall the case of Mrs. Joan\r\nSlote, age 74, fined $8,500 for having gone to Cuba?\r\nWhat really is democratic, to respect the clear and\r\nmajority-based vote of both the House and the Senate,\r\nor stubbornly and shortsightedly to defend vulgar\r\nelectoral interests?\r\nThe United States must stop preventing the free\r\nexchange of ideas. It must stop hindering visits by\r\nCuban scientists, athletes and artists to this country. It\r\nmust allow Cuba to acquire top-of-the-line equipment\r\nand technology for Internet access.\r\nThe United States must allow Cuba to use the\r\ndollar for its external trade and other commercial\r\ntransactions. By what right does it seize Cuba’s\r\npayments to companies or Governments of third\r\ncountries?\r\nThe United States must eliminate the absurd\r\nprohibition preventing the import into its territory of\r\nproducts manufactured in third countries if these\r\nproducts contain Cuban raw materials. It must allow\r\nthe World Bank and the Inter-American Development\r\nBank to grant credits to Cuba. In this hemisphere, often\r\nthose credits were stolen in the past by corrupt\r\npresidents and then later on deposited in American\r\nbanks. That has not happened and never will happen in\r\nthe case of Cuba!\r\nThe United States must authorize its banks to\r\nmake loans to Cuba and allow its enterprises to trade\r\nwith and freely invest in our country. Are these not\r\nprivate banks and enterprises?\r\nThe United States Government must prevent the\r\nBacardi company from stealing the Havana Club rum\r\nbrand name. Its Government should not act as an\r\ninterested party, and I spell that out clearly, in a\r\nconflict involving trademarks and patents with Cuba.\r\nThe United States must return the frozen assets to\r\nCuba and prevent Cuban money that is being frozen in\r\nbanks in this country from being stolen by influential\r\ntraffickers and greedy, petty lawyers from Miami.\r\nThe United States must return to Cuba the\r\nterritory it is currently occupying against our will,\r\nnamely the Guantanamo naval base. It must repeal the\r\nCuban Adjustment Act and accept our proposal to\r\nengage in extensive cooperation to eliminate smuggling\r\nof aliens.\r\nThe United States must release the five young\r\nCubans who are unjustly imprisoned, violating their\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nmost basic human rights in this country, and go after\r\nthe terrorists roaming the streets of Miami.\r\nFinally, the United States must cease its\r\naggression against Cuba. It must recognize Cuba’s\r\nright to self-determination, free self-determination. It\r\nmust let Cubans live in peace. It must recognize that\r\nfrom 1 January 1959 on — soon that will make 45\r\nyears — Cuba has been a free and independent country.\r\nPresident Bush said a few days ago that Cuba is\r\nnot going to change on its own. He is mistaken. Cuba is\r\nchanging every day. There is no more profound and\r\npermanent change than that of a revolution. Cuba will\r\nchange, yes, but increasingly towards more revolution\r\nand more socialism, towards more equality, more\r\njustice, more freedom and more solidarity. And so it\r\nwill be over President Bush’s objection because, as was\r\nsaid over 123 years ago by the apostle of our\r\nindependence, José Martí: “Before relinquishing the\r\nendeavour to make our homeland free and prosperous,\r\nthe southern sea will merge with the northern sea, and a\r\nsnake will be born out of an eagle’s egg.”\r\nThe President of the United States went on to say:\r\n“but Cuba must change”. I must pause at that phrase,\r\nbecause it entails an inherent threat of new sanctions\r\nagainst our country, as Cubans have understood it. The\r\ndistinguished President of the United States must recall\r\nthat he is the tenth to make such threats over these four\r\ndecades of blockade and aggressions that Cuba has\r\nmanaged to overcome.\r\nHe should also know that his current difficulties\r\npale against those that he would have had if he had\r\nmistakenly gotten into a tango with Cuba. He should\r\nknow there is no human or natural force capable of\r\ncausing the Cubans to give up their dreams of justice\r\nand freedom.\r\nOur being noble must not be mistaken for\r\nweakness. Our absence of hatred must not be confused\r\nwith fear. Our willingness to engage in dialogue must\r\nnot be mistaken for the illusion of a surrender by a\r\npeople that has not been defeated. There should be no\r\nmistake that Cuba could at any time be dominated. It\r\nwould be very costly, indeed, for the aggressor.\r\nFinally, I ask the Assembly, on behalf of the\r\ngenerous and courageous people back home in my\r\ncountry who are closely following what you all will\r\ndecide today, to vote in favour of the draft resolution in\r\nA/58/L.4, entitled “Necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”.\r\nI am asking you to forgive the words full of\r\nhatred and bereft of respect pronounced here by my\r\nadversary and I reiterate my respect to you and my\r\nthanks and those of my people.\r\nI ask you to vote in favour of Cuba’s rights, that\r\nis, the right of Cuba, which today is also everyone’s\r\nright. I thank you.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): My delegation\r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Morocco, on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China. When the General Assembly adopted\r\nresolution 47/19 in 1992 on the “Necessity of ending\r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nimposed by the United States of America against\r\nCuba”, Member States did so in recognition of the fact\r\nthat the embargo violates the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter and the freedom of trade and\r\ninternational navigation. Thus, those States which had\r\nsuch laws or measures were urged to take the necessary\r\nsteps to repeal or invalidate them as soon as possible.\r\nHowever, it is disheartening to note that to date no\r\nsignificant measures have been taken towards lifting\r\nthe embargo. Instead, in recent years we have\r\nwitnessed the strengthening of the embargo and the\r\nbroadening of its extraterritorial implementation, as\r\ninstitutionalized by the Torricelli and Helms-Burton\r\nActs, which in addition to violating the sovereignty of\r\nthird-party States and international law, are continuing\r\nto cause serious damage to the Cuban economy.\r\nThe adverse effect on the population of Cuba\r\ncannot be overemphasized. The embargo has caused,\r\nand continues to cause, major damage to the Cuban\r\npeople’s material and spiritual welfare, imposing\r\nserious obstacles on their economic, cultural and social\r\ndevelopment. It has affected the Cuban people’s full\r\nrealization of their basic human rights, including the\r\nright to health and education, sectors that have been\r\nseriously affected by embargo regulations. Indeed, the\r\nembargo has made it extremely difficult for the country\r\nto purchase the food and medicines needed to sustain\r\nthe lives of the Cuban people. It has deprived the\r\nCuban people of the opportunities and benefits derived\r\nfrom free trade and peaceful coexistence.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration, world leaders,\r\namong others, resolved to create an environment at\r\nboth the national and global levels which is conducive\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nto economic development and to the fight against\r\npoverty. In order to live up to the expectations of the\r\nDeclaration, we, the Member States, must make sure\r\nthat no country is left behind in the fight to eliminate\r\npoverty.\r\nClearly, the embargo is an obstacle to Cuba’s\r\nefforts to implement the Millennium Declaration. The\r\nnew world order cannot be built on a cold war mind-set\r\ncharacterized by confrontation and economic blockade.\r\nThere is no place for that in today’s world of\r\ncooperation and free trade. Namibia therefore reiterates\r\nits call for the immediate and unconditional lifting of\r\nthe unjust and unprovoked embargo imposed against\r\nCuba. It is in this context that my delegation will vote\r\nin favour of the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/58/L.4, entitled “Necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”, which is\r\nbefore us today.\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the\r\nnext speaker, I should like to propose that, in the\r\nabsence of objection, the list of speakers in the debate\r\non this item now be closed.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMs. Ndhlovu (South Africa): My delegation\r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his report\r\non the necessity of ending the economic, commercial\r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba, as contained in document\r\nA/58/287. We also welcome the Foreign Minister of\r\nCuba, His Excellency Mr. Felipe Pérez Roque.\r\nMy delegation regrets the fact that we again have\r\nto address the item on the necessity of ending the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America against Cuba. Peaceful\r\ncoexistence between and among nations requires that\r\nall civilized States observe international law. In this\r\nregard, the international community has repeatedly and\r\nconsistently called for the lifting of the United States\r\nembargo against Cuba, and South Africa reaffirms its\r\nbelief that that is the right thing to do. Those measures\r\nhave caused untold suffering to the people of Cuba. It\r\nis therefore no wonder that the overwhelming majority\r\nof Member States are here today to continue to rally\r\nsupport for the draft resolution before us.\r\nAt the thirteenth Summit Conference of Heads of\r\nState or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement,\r\nheld in Kuala Lumpur in February, leaders expressed\r\ntheir rejection of unilateralism, which is increasingly\r\nleading to the erosion and violation of international\r\nlaw. They also expressed their firm opposition to\r\ncoercive and unilateral measures as a means of exerting\r\npressure on developing countries, as such measures are\r\ncontrary to international law, including international\r\nhumanitarian law, the United Nations Charter and the\r\nnorms and principles governing peaceful relations\r\namong States. The heads of State or Government also\r\nagain called upon the Government of the United States\r\nof America to put an end to the economic, commercial\r\nand financial embargo against Cuba, which, in addition\r\nto being unilateral and contrary to the Charter,\r\ninternational law and the principle of good-\r\nneighbourliness, is causing huge material losses and\r\neconomic damage to the people of Cuba.\r\nThe heads of State or Government further\r\nexpressed deep concern about the widening of the\r\nextraterritorial character of the embargo against Cuba\r\nand the continual new legislative measures geared\r\ntowards intensifying it, which clearly contradict the\r\nexpressed will of the international community.\r\nMy delegation fully associates itself with the\r\nviews expressed my many speakers, and calls upon all\r\ncountries to reject the unilateral, extraterritorial\r\nmeasures imposed against Cuba, as they stand in stark\r\ncontrast to international law, which guides all civilized\r\nStates. My delegation also firmly believes in a strong\r\nmultilateral system, based on clear and mutually\r\naccepted rules and principles, in which small and big\r\nnations are treated as equal sovereign States. The\r\nUnited Nations Charter embodies the vision, mission,\r\nprinciples and obligations that all signatories to the\r\nCharter must abide by. South Africa views the\r\ncontinued imposition of the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo against the Republic of Cuba as a\r\nflagrant violation of the principles of the sovereign\r\nequality of States and non-intervention and non-\r\ninterference in the domestic affairs of foreign\r\nsovereign States, in this case Cuba.\r\nWe are guided by the basic norms of international\r\nconduct in our principled support for the need to\r\neliminate economic coercive measures as a means of\r\npolitical and economic compulsion.\r\nIn line with previous United Nations resolutions\r\non this item, among others, South Africa believes that\r\nconstructive dialogue can foster mutual trust and\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nunderstanding, as well as engender harmony and\r\npeaceful coexistence between the two nations.\r\nFurthermore, we welcome attempts by all countries\r\naimed at easing the economic strangulation of Cuba\r\nand at contributing to an improved quality of life for\r\nthe people of Cuba.\r\nSouth Africa will once again support the draft\r\nresolution to be considered by the General Assembly\r\nunder this item. This, we believe, will be our humble\r\ncontribution to the rule of international law and the\r\nstrengthening of multilateralism.\r\nMr. Mahiga (United Republic of Tanzania):\r\nTanzania is addressing the Assembly once again this\r\nyear to join the international plea to the United States\r\nof America to end the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba, which is entering its\r\nforty-fifth year. This is the twelfth successive year that\r\nthe item is being deliberated in this Assembly.\r\nThe imposition of the embargo against Cuba over\r\nfour decades ago seriously violates not only the\r\nfundamental principles of the United Nations Charter\r\nand of international law, but also the freedom of\r\ninternational trade. The situation was made worse by\r\nthe passing of the Torricelli Act in 1991 and of the\r\nHelms-Burton Act in 1996, meant completely to isolate\r\nCuba from international trade.\r\nThe extraterritoriality of the embargo, as\r\ninstitutionalized by the Torricelli and Helms-Burton\r\nActs, in addition to breaching the sovereignty of third-\r\nparty States as well as international law, has caused\r\nfurther severe damage to the economy of Cuba over the\r\npast 10 years. The effects are damaging to trade\r\nrelations between Cuba and third-party nations and\r\ntheir private companies. The embargo has seriously\r\naffected Cuba’s economic and social sectors, and it is\r\nestimated that in the past 44 years Cuba has lost more\r\nthan $72 billion. We pay tribute to the dignified\r\nresilience and courage of the Cuban people in facing,\r\nand bracing against, these punitive measures.\r\nWe have expressed concern at the adverse effects\r\nof the economic embargo on the Cuban population,\r\nparticularly its most vulnerable segments. One of the\r\nsectors hardest hit is the agricultural sector, whose\r\ndevelopment is key to food production and hence to the\r\nnutritional standards of the Cuban people. The embargo\r\nhas generated conditions that lead to hardships for\r\nordinary people. This is a violation of the Cuban\r\npeople’s right to food — one of the fundamental rights\r\nprovided in various international Conventions on\r\nhuman rights. The embargo measures affect imports of\r\nfood — products destined for the Cuban population, for\r\nboth consumption in homes and social consumption in\r\nschools, senior facilities, hospitals and day-care\r\ncentres.\r\nIt is very encouraging and praiseworthy to note\r\nthat, despite all these odds, and under very difficult\r\nconditions, Cuba has managed to develop world-class\r\nhealth and educational systems, which it has\r\ngenerously shared with other developing countries. My\r\ncountry, Tanzania, has benefited from the excellent\r\ntraining in those fields provided to many Tanzanians\r\nover the years. Those world-class accomplishments\r\nhave survived and flourished despite the very high\r\ncosts of the embargo inflicted on Cuba. It is our\r\nconviction that Cuba’s achievements in the fields of\r\nhealth and education would have been greater if no\r\nembargo had been imposed and that Cuba would have\r\nbecome a more prosperous nation.\r\nThe wholesale nature of the embargo, its\r\nlongevity — over four decades — and its\r\nindiscriminate effects on infirm and innocent citizens,\r\nyoung and old alike, raises moral and ethical concerns\r\nover the issue of sanctions. The embargo has created a\r\npermanent state of siege and of belligerency, which\r\nforecloses meaningful options for resolving the issue.\r\nCoping with and surviving the embargo has become the\r\nsingular preoccupation of the entire nation. We believe\r\nthat the untried path of easing the sanctions and\r\nembarking on a dialogue could end the persistent\r\nstalemate and bring a new logic to an international\r\nenvironment, dominated by the politics of\r\nconfrontation.\r\nThe Government of the United Republic of\r\nTanzania has consistently called for the lifting of the\r\neconomic embargo against the Republic of Cuba. and\r\nits position on the issue remains unchanged this year.\r\nAgain, we appeal to all States to refrain from applying\r\nlaws and measures and to lift such laws which infringe\r\non freedom of trade and navigation, in accordance with\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. Tanzania will once\r\nagain vote in favour of the draft resolution.\r\nMr. Alcalay (Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela, I should like to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his report entitled “Necessity of ending the\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”.\r\nAllow me at the outset to endorse fully the\r\nstatement made by the representative of Morocco, who\r\nspoke on behalf of the Group of 77, whose position my\r\ncountry is in full agreement with. With respect to the\r\nembargo against Cuba, our position has been one of\r\nsteadfast and firm rejection of the application of\r\ncoercive measures in contravention of the fundamental\r\nprinciples of international law and, in particular, in\r\nviolation of the provisions enshrined in the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations, as stated in plenary this morning\r\nby the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, Mr. Felipe\r\nPérez Roque.\r\nMy country, Venezuela, over the 12 years that the\r\nGeneral Assembly has been considering this item, has\r\ntime after time voted in favour of resolutions asking for\r\nthe lifting of the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States against Cuba,\r\nand, on this occasion, will reiterate its position.\r\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, like most\r\nof the States Members of the United Nations,\r\ncompletely rejects the promulgation and application of\r\nlaws and regulatory provisions with extraterritorial\r\neffects, because they violate the sovereignty of other\r\nStates and run counter to the legitimate interests of\r\njuridical entities and of the natural persons under their\r\njurisdiction and have a negative impact on the freedom\r\nof international trade and navigation.\r\nVenezuela takes the view that the application of\r\nnational laws and regulatory provisions such as the\r\nHelms-Burton or the Torricelli Acts, given their\r\nextraterritorial effects, adversely affects the\r\nsovereignty of States and constitutes a flagrant\r\nviolation of the human rights of the Cuban people. We\r\nhave seen with growing concern how those measures\r\nhave been intensified and how their extraterritorial\r\napplication has widened. My country therefore\r\nrequests, through the worthy intermediary of the\r\nSecretary-General and of the President of the\r\nAssembly, that the necessary measures be adopted to\r\nrepeal those measures and to render them null and\r\nvoid.\r\nIn accordance with that position, we have\r\nsupported declarations adopted at a variety of\r\ninternational forums, such as the Ibero-American\r\nSummit, the Summit of the Movement of Non-Aligned\r\nCountries, the Group of 15 and the Group of 77,\r\ninasmuch as illegal and discriminatory measures such\r\nas those that have been applied against Cuba produce\r\neffects harmful to the Cuban people. Moreover, they\r\nseriously jeopardize multilateralism.\r\nThe international community has consistently\r\nrepudiated such extraterritorial laws, which infringe on\r\nthe sovereignty of other States, which in turn maintain\r\ndiplomatic, trade and all other kinds of ties with the\r\nCuban Government. This is incompatible with the\r\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States, because\r\nillegal measures of this kind impede the social and\r\neconomic development of the Cuban people, striking\r\nhardest at the most vulnerable among them, such as\r\nchildren and the elderly. By the same token, they also\r\nadversely affect housing, education and health and food\r\nprogrammes, to mention just a few of the social sectors\r\ninvolved.\r\nIn conclusion, we believe that conflicts and\r\nproblems between States must be resolved through\r\nconstructive dialogue and negotiation designed to\r\nfoster confidence, peace and integration in the region.\r\nWe have, as I have already said, once again decided to\r\nvote in favour of draft resolution A/58/L.4.\r\nMr. Erwa (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): Respect for\r\nthe principles enshrined in the Charter is one of the\r\nmost important obligations incumbent upon members\r\nof the international community in order to promote\r\nbrotherhood, cooperation, justice and equality among\r\nStates and respect for the choices of peoples. Thus, the\r\ninternational community should have evolved beyond\r\nthe stage when the law of the strongest and most\r\ndominant prevailed and should have reached a stage\r\nwhere human development is measured by respect for\r\nthe law and for the rights and choices of others.\r\nFor the twelfth consecutive year, the General\r\nAssembly is considering the item entitled “Necessity of\r\nending the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America\r\nagainst Cuba”. Over the course of those 12 years the\r\nAssembly has constantly reiterated its belief in the\r\nright of peoples to self-determination — by adopting\r\ndraft resolutions like the one before us — and has\r\nmade an appeal to all States not to accept or implement\r\nunilateral national decisions with negative\r\nextraterritorial effects, which are a clear violation of\r\nthe principles of international law.\r\nToday, we are once again considering agenda\r\nitem 29 on the need to end the embargo against Cuba.\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nThe General Assembly voted in favour of resolution\r\n57/11 last year, with 173 votes in favour, which reflects\r\na growing awareness of the danger inherent in unfairly\r\nimposing sanctions against Member States. In addition,\r\nwe can see that danger in their harsh effects on all\r\naspects of life and infrastructure in the countries\r\nconcerned.\r\nOne can imagine the damage inflicted upon Cuba\r\nover the past four decades and the unspeakable\r\nsuffering that is daily visited upon its people, who have\r\nbeen deprived by the embargo of even the basic\r\nnecessities.\r\nMy country has also suffered from unilateral\r\nsanctions like those imposed on Cuba, imposed by the\r\nsame country. That country has renewed its sanctions\r\nagainst Cuba for another year. Furthermore, other\r\ncountries suffer from the same unwarranted policies,\r\nmost recently the brotherly State of Syria, which is\r\nthreatened with the imposition of sanctions.\r\nOur position on this issue is principled and firm.\r\nWe are against policies of exclusion and coercion, and\r\nimposition of hegemony upon other peoples.\r\nFinally, we appeal to all States to vote in favour\r\nof the draft resolution introduced by Cuba on this item,\r\nthereby strongly rejecting these unilateral acts, which\r\nare undoubtedly a violation of international law and the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Kazemi Kamyab (Islamic Republic of Iran):\r\nLet me start by expressing our appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on the agenda item\r\nentitled “Necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America against Cuba” (A/58/287)\r\nand by expressing my deep disappointment over the\r\nongoing embargo against that country.\r\nThe use of unilateral measures as a means of\r\npolitical and economic coercion against developing\r\ncountries has been condemned by decisions and\r\nresolutions of various bodies of the United Nations,\r\nparticularly the General Assembly and the Economic\r\nand Social Council. The international community\r\nshould become more vocal about the need to repeal\r\nsuch measures and prevent similar actions.\r\nThe adoption and application of unilateral\r\ncoercive measures impedes full achievement of\r\neconomic and social development by the populations of\r\nthe affected countries, particularly children and\r\nwomen. It hinders their well-being and creates\r\nobstacles to sustainable development and the full\r\nenjoyment of their human rights, including the right of\r\nall individuals to a standard of living adequate for their\r\nhealth and well-being and their right to food, medical\r\ncare and necessary social services. It must be ensured\r\nthat food and medicine are not used as tools for\r\npolitical pressure.\r\nResort to unilateral economic coercive measures\r\njeopardizes the legitimate economic interests of the\r\ntargeted developing countries. The United Nations\r\nsystem and other relevant international and multilateral\r\norganizations are redoubling their efforts to create and\r\nstrengthen a conducive international economic\r\nenvironment capable of providing equal opportunities\r\nfor all countries to benefit from international economic,\r\nfinancial and trade systems. It is also necessary that the\r\ninternational community consider ways and means of\r\ncompensating the losses of targeted countries caused\r\nby those who resort to such unilateral measures.\r\nMr. Sow (Guinea) (spoke in French): Guinea\r\nfully associates itself with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of the Kingdom of Morocco on behalf of\r\nthe Group of 77 and China.\r\nWe also note with regret, as other Member States\r\nhave, that the item that we are dealing with this\r\nmorning has been a fixed item on the General\r\nAssembly agenda for more than a decade. However, the\r\ninternational community’s position on the matter is\r\nclear. The constancy and the solidarity that have\r\ncharacterized it throughout the years are symbolic of\r\nMember States’ strong opposition to the unilateral\r\nembargo imposed on Cuba. Bearing eloquent witness to\r\nthat position is also the fact that 173 countries voted in\r\nfavour of the resolution at the last session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThis is an occasion for me to reiterate my\r\ncountry’s unswerving commitment to the principles of\r\nthe Charter that enshrine the sovereign equality of\r\nStates, non-intervention and non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of States, as well as freedom of trade\r\nand international navigation.\r\nIt is our belief that disputes among States should\r\nbe resolved through dialogue and negotiation on the\r\nbasis of mutual respect and the principle of equality.\r\nMy delegation believes that promulgating and\r\nenacting extraterritorial unilateral coercive measures is\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nunacceptable. For that reason, it reiterates its solidarity\r\nwith the Cuban people and expresses its profound\r\nconcern over the persistence of legislation that\r\njeopardizes both the letter and the spirit of the Charter.\r\nMy country, which is linked to Cuba by excellent\r\nties of friendship, regards the lifting of sanctions as\r\nextremely urgent in order to relieve the suffering of its\r\npeople, particularly children, women and the elderly.\r\nAs in previous years, my delegation will vote in\r\nfavour of the draft resolution before us.\r\nMr. Mpundu (Zambia): My delegation has taken\r\nthe floor to express Zambia’s view on this annual draft\r\nresolution on the subject of the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport, namely the necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America against Cuba (A/58/287). The\r\nreport has provided a clear and objective analysis of\r\nthe negative impact arising from the blockade. This\r\nembargo has aggravated the plight of ordinary Cuban\r\npeople, especially vulnerable groups such as children,\r\nwomen and the elderly.\r\nOver the years, this Assembly has adopted\r\nnumerous resolutions demanding the lifting of the\r\neconomic embargo against Cuba, with the\r\noverwhelming support of Member countries. Zambia’s\r\nforeign policy is based, inter alia, on the principles of\r\ninternational law governing relations among States, the\r\nself-determination of peoples, non-interference in the\r\naffairs of other States, the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes, the prohibition of the threat or use of force in\r\nthe international relations, the legal equality of States,\r\ninternational development cooperation and the search\r\nfor international peace and security.\r\nMy Government does not support the use of\r\ncoercive measures as a means of exerting pressure in\r\ninternational relations, as the use of such measures is\r\ncontrary to the practice of international law and the\r\nprinciple of peaceful coexistence among nations. The\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Zambia has repeatedly\r\nexpressed its opposition to the imposition of economic\r\nor political sanctions that do not have the blessings of\r\nthe Security Council and any other measures that are\r\nnot sanctioned by the General Assembly. It is for that\r\nreason that Zambia is opposed to the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba\r\n40 years ago.\r\nZambia believes that the embargo against Cuba is\r\na breach of international law and a departure from the\r\nprinciples of the Charter. We also regard the\r\nextraterritorial nature of the Helms-Burton Act as an\r\ninfringement on the territorial integrity of States. It is\r\nalso an impediment to international navigation and free\r\ntrade, as embodied in the World Trade Organization\r\nFinal Act. The principles of free navigation and trade\r\nare welcomed by all freedom-loving nations.\r\nZambia’s relations with Cuba are based on mutual\r\nrespect and the principle of non-interference in each\r\nother’s internal affairs. My Government, therefore,\r\ncalls upon this Assembly to support this draft\r\nresolution, which is designed to enhance the social and\r\neconomic development of the Cuban people.\r\nAs a landlocked developing country, Zambia has\r\nconsistently affirmed the right of access of both\r\nlandlocked and transit countries to and from the sea by\r\nall means of transportation, in accordance with\r\ninternational law. In pursuit of those lofty objectives,\r\nmy delegation wishes to reaffirm its support for the\r\ndraft resolution. Accordingly, my delegation will vote\r\nin favour of the draft resolution before us. Our vote\r\nwill be based on our adherence to the principles of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation once again appeals\r\nto all Member States to support the call for a complete\r\nlifting of the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo against Cuba. Lifting the embargo will go a\r\nlong way towards strengthening freedom of trade and\r\nof navigation in the Caribbean and in other areas of the\r\nworld, and in particular towards alleviating the\r\nsuffering of the Cuban people.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): Once again the General Assembly is\r\nconsidering the item entitled “Necessity of ending the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”, despite\r\nthe vast number of resolutions adopted by many\r\nregional and international bodies, including the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and despite the fact that the United\r\nStates should have implemented those resolutions.\r\nBut the reality is quite different. We all can see\r\nthat the laws governing the embargo against Cuba are\r\nbeing enhanced and expanded, especially the Helms-\r\nBurton Act, which prohibits all entities and third\r\ncountries from engaging in free trade with Cuba.\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nThe United States of America has imposed\r\nembargoes not only on Cuba but on many other\r\ncountries as well, including Libya, in an attempt to\r\nforce those countries to follow policies that run counter\r\nto their own choices and convictions. The embargo\r\nagainst Cuba has had an extremely adverse impact, in\r\nparticular in the area of health care. But that has simply\r\nhelped to strengthen the determination of the people of\r\nCuba to build their country and to defend it.\r\nThe policy of drawing up lists of so-called outlaw\r\nor rogue States should be denounced quite firmly. The\r\nembargo policies that have been imposed by the United\r\nStates against many countries, which stand in the way\r\nof freedom of trade and navigation, are detrimental to\r\nthe people of targeted countries — including the\r\nAmerican people. It should also be borne in mind that\r\nthe United States, as a permanent member of the\r\nSecurity Council, has the responsibility to lift the\r\ncommercial, financial and economic embargo against\r\nCuba and other countries. The embargo has been\r\nrepeatedly denounced by the international community,\r\ngiven that it contravenes all relevant treaties and\r\nprovisions of international law.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations and\r\ninternational law lay down mechanisms for the\r\nresolution of disputes among countries. My country\r\nhopes that those two neighbouring countries — Cuba\r\nand the United States — will find a peaceful solution to\r\ntheir disputes. States want to see the dispute resolved\r\nby peaceful means, as repeatedly called for by the\r\ninternational community and by regional organizations,\r\nas enshrined in the provisions of international law.\r\nIndeed, it will not be possible to establish global\r\npeace, restore friendly relations among countries or\r\npromote development in the absence of international\r\ncooperation based on mutual understanding and respect\r\nfor the sovereignty and political and economic choices\r\nof all countries, large and small.\r\nMr. Swe (Myanmar): My delegation would like at\r\nthe outset to associate itself with the statement made by\r\nthe delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco on behalf of\r\nthe Group of 77 and China.\r\nMy delegation is taking the floor once again this\r\nyear to express our concern over the continued\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America against Cuba. Since\r\n1991, when a resolution on this item was first adopted\r\nat the forty-sixth session, successive General Assembly\r\nresolutions have continued to give further support, with\r\nan overwhelming majority calling on the United States\r\nto end the embargo against Cuba. The United States\r\nhas yet to heed the wishes of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nMy delegation concurs with the view that\r\nMember States have the right to adopt policies of their\r\nchoice to promote their own national interests. My\r\ndelegation firmly believes that, in the conduct of\r\nrelations among sovereign nations, we should uphold\r\ninternational law and the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. The Millennium\r\nDeclaration, while reaffirming the sovereignty of all\r\nStates, called for an open, equitable, rule-based,\r\npredictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading\r\nand financial system. Embargoes run counter not only\r\nto the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations but also violate fundamental\r\nprinciples of international law.\r\nMy delegation considers that normalization of\r\nrelations between the United States of America and\r\nCuba through dialogue and cooperation is in the best\r\ninterest of the peoples of both countries. In this regard,\r\nmy delegation welcomes the recent move by the United\r\nStates Congress to lift travel restrictions on United\r\nStates citizens who wish to visit Cuba. My delegation\r\nviews it as a step in the right direction and hopes that\r\nincreased interaction will promote better understanding\r\namong the peoples of both countries and eventually\r\nlead to the lifting of the embargo.\r\nThe Government of the Union of Myanmar\r\ncontinues to maintain its consistent policy of strict\r\nadherence to the principles of the Charter of the United\r\nNations and to the view that the promulgation and\r\napplication by Member States of laws and regulations\r\nwhose extraterritorial effects affect the sovereignty of\r\nother States and the legitimate interests of entities or\r\npersons under their jurisdiction, as well as freedom of\r\ntrade and freedom of navigation, violate the universally\r\nadopted principles of international law.\r\nAs a reaffirmation of our consistent policy, my\r\ndelegation will vote in favour of draft resolution\r\nA/58/L.4, submitted by Cuba.\r\nMr. Chidyausiku (Zimbabwe): Like many others\r\nwho have spoken before me, my delegation firmly\r\nrejects the imposition of laws and regulations with\r\nextraterritorial impacts and all other forms of coercive\r\neconomic measures — including unilateral sanctions\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nagainst Cuba — and reaffirms the urgent need to\r\neliminate them immediately. Zimbabwe emphasizes\r\nthat such actions not only undermine the principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and\r\ninternational law, but also severely threaten freedom of\r\ntrade and investment.\r\nWe therefore call on the international community\r\nneither to recognize such measures nor to apply them.\r\nIn the spirit of fostering North-South relations, we\r\nunderline the need for developed countries to eliminate\r\nlaws and regulations with adverse extraterritorial\r\neffects and other forms of unilateral economic coercive\r\nmeasures, which are inconsistent with the principles of\r\ninternational law, the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nthe principles of the multilateral trading system.\r\nZimbabwe will vote in favour of the draft\r\nresolution entitled “Necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America against Cuba” (A/58/L.4).\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): The Charter of the United Nations, in its\r\nprinciples and purposes, reaffirms the right of States to\r\nexercise sovereignty over their territory and to non-\r\ninterference in their internal affairs. All Members of\r\nthe United Nations — particularly the great Powers —\r\nare obliged to respect the Charter, which is the\r\nOrganization’s constitution and its first and last frame\r\nof reference. The embargo that has been imposed on\r\nCuba for more than 40 years has caused all kinds of\r\neconomic, social and political damage to that country.\r\nIt has deepened the suffering of the Cuban people —\r\nparticularly children and the elderly — and it has\r\nnegatively affected the Cuban people’s tireless efforts\r\nto achieve well-being and prosperity.\r\nMy delegation appreciates Cuba’s constant\r\nendeavour to conduct a constructive dialogue with the\r\nUnited States to settle all differences between the two\r\nparties on the basis of equal sovereignty, mutual\r\nrespect, non-interference in the internal affairs of both\r\nStates and respect for the principles and purposes of\r\nthe United Nations Charter, as well as the principle of\r\ngood-neighbourliness. My delegation believes that the\r\nnormalization of relations between the United States\r\nand Cuba would serve the interests of the peoples of\r\nboth countries.\r\nThe international community’s increased support\r\nfor the necessity of ending the embargo against Cuba is\r\nan affirmation of the need to respect the political,\r\neconomic and social systems chosen by people as an\r\nexpression of their will and in the light of their national\r\ninterests. In that respect, we should like to draw\r\nattention to the positions of the heads of State and the\r\npresidents of the Non-Aligned Movement and the\r\nGroup of 77 and China calling for an end to the\r\nembargo against Cuba. My delegation hopes that all\r\nforms of sanctions imposed by the United States\r\nagainst Cuba will be lifted, including the new\r\nlegislation that has expanded the embargo under the\r\nHelms-Burton Act. We hope that the international\r\ncommunity’s voice will be heeded by the Government\r\nof the United States.\r\nTherefore, the Syrian Arab Republic will vote in\r\nfavour of the draft resolution (A/58/L.4) submitted to\r\nthe General Assembly today.\r\nMr. Jenie (Indonesia): Since the forty-seventh\r\nsession of the General Assembly, Member States have\r\nincreasingly rejected the deployment of unilateral trade\r\nmeasures by any Member State to attempt political\r\nreforms in another Member State. Given that fact and\r\nthe events of the past few years, my delegation sees no\r\nreason to believe that there will not be a resounding\r\nrejection of the unilateral embargo against Cuba during\r\nthe fifty-eighth session. In our view, we must\r\ncollectively find a way to bring that unfair embargo to\r\nan end. Within the United Nations, Member States and\r\nrelevant organs and agencies continue to ask for that\r\nstep to be taken, and it is the right step to take.\r\nWe are of the view that embargoes imposed\r\nthrough unilateral trade measures run counter to the\r\nspirit of the Charter of the United Nations and must\r\ntherefore come to an end. In our view, the economic\r\nblockade against Cuba violates the right of every\r\nCuban man, woman and child to life, to well-being and\r\nto development without distinctions of any kind.\r\nIndeed, it is known that among the hardest hit are the\r\nchildren of Cuba. The embargo — which extends to\r\nfood, medicine and other forms of humanitarian aid —\r\nis extreme, discriminatory and prejudicial. It has\r\ninflicted the most pernicious economic damage on the\r\nnation and multiplied the difficulties of the Cuban\r\npeople; it cannot be defended under the pretext of\r\ntrying to protect those same people.\r\nIn the light of that continued and collateral\r\ndamage, Indonesia calls for a review of the current\r\npolicy in favour of one based on dialogue and\r\nnegotiation — a policy that is more likely to receive\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nthe backing of the international community. Indeed, we\r\nrecognize that in recent years, the United States has\r\ngranted some American companies licences to supply\r\nmedicines and foodstuffs to Cuba on purely\r\nhumanitarian grounds. While we welcome such\r\ndevelopments, we cannot fail to believe that nothing\r\nwill suffice but a complete removal of the embargo,\r\nwith a view to permitting normal international trade.\r\nGiving medicine to a malnourished child when food\r\nwould have prevented his condition in the first place is\r\nquite unfortunate and illogical.\r\nIndonesia would like to reaffirm its commitment\r\nto respect for the fundamental principles of sovereign\r\nequality among States, non-interference in their\r\ninternal affairs and freedom of international trade and\r\nnavigation. We commend the international\r\ncommunity’s efforts to uphold those principles and to\r\nput an end to the unilateral economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba.\r\nFinally, therefore, in strong support of those and\r\nrelated principles of international law, the United\r\nNations Charter and the promotion of the freedom of\r\ntrade, Indonesia will again vote in favour of the draft\r\nresolution (A/58/L.4).\r\nMr. Kittikhoun (Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic) (spoke in French): More than four decades\r\nof economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nagainst the Republic of Cuba by the Government of the\r\nUnited States of America have gone by. The embargo\r\nstill remains in effect and has been tightened even\r\nfurther. Moreover, it has caused great suffering among\r\ninnocent Cuban people and continues to create needless\r\ntension between neighbouring countries.\r\nIn today’s world, marked by many types of\r\ncooperation between and among States, it is\r\ndisappointing to see the continued existence of\r\nunilateral discriminatory trade practices. As we see it,\r\nthe extraterritorial application of the domestic laws of\r\none country clearly runs counter to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter. In accordance with relevant\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions, a Member State must\r\nneither promulgate nor apply rules, regulations or\r\nmeasures, the extraterritorial effects of which would\r\nharm the sovereignty of other Member States, as well\r\nas to free trade.\r\nAs a matter of sovereignty, each nation is entitled\r\nto participate freely in the international financial and\r\ntrading systems. Mindful of the internationally\r\nrecognized principles of national sovereignty, no\r\ncountry has the right to interfere in the domestic affairs\r\nof another, despite the fact that the other has a different\r\neconomic and social system. As a sovereign and\r\nindependent nation, the Republic of Cuba has the right\r\nto choose its own political system, as well as its own\r\ndevelopment model. To reduce poverty and achieve its\r\nsustainable development, Cuba should be empowered\r\nto maintain and promote trade ties with all countries of\r\nthe world.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic, together\r\nwith the majority of Member States, shall continue to\r\nstrive to put an end to the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba. This policy,\r\nunprecedented in international law, has thus far\r\nbenefited neither of the two parties. The Republic of\r\nCuba is a Member of the United Nations, and as\r\nMembers ourselves, we must do all within our power to\r\nhelp that country regain its legitimate right to be a full-\r\nfledged member of the global economy.\r\nIt is in that context that my Government shall\r\nvote in favour of the draft resolution contained in\r\ndocument A/58/L.4.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on this item. The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on draft resolution A/58/L.4.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola,\r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia,\r\nAustralia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain,\r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize,\r\nBenin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nBotswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria,\r\nBurkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon,\r\nCanada, Cape Verde, Central African Republic,\r\nChad, Chile, China, Colombia, Comoros, Congo,\r\nCosta Rica, Côte d’Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus,\r\nCzech Republic, Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea, Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nDenmark, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican\r\nRepublic, Ecuador, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea,\r\nEritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France,\r\nGabon, Gambia, Georgia, Germany, Ghana,\r\nGreece, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-\r\nBissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary,\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nIceland, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic\r\nof), Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan,\r\nKazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kyrgyzstan, Lao\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, Latvia, Lebanon,\r\nLesotho, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Liechtenstein,\r\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi,\r\nMalaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania,\r\nMauritius, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia,\r\nMozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nauru, Nepal,\r\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Nigeria,\r\nNorway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New\r\nGuinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland,\r\nPortugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of\r\nMoldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Rwanda,\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent\r\nand the Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, Sao\r\nTome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia\r\nand Montenegro, Seychelles, Sierra Leone,\r\nSingapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands,\r\nSomalia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan,\r\nSuriname, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland,\r\nSyrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-\r\nLeste, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago,\r\nTunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, Uganda,\r\nUkraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom\r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania, Uruguay, Vanuatu,\r\nVenezuela, Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst:\r\nIsrael, Marshall Islands, United States of America\r\nAbstaining:\r\nMicronesia (Federated States of), Morocco\r\nDraft resolution A/58/L.4 was adopted by 179\r\nvotes to 3, with 2 abstentions (resolution 58/7).\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to\r\nspeakers in explanation of vote after the vote, may I\r\nremind delegations that explanations of vote are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Isakov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The Russian Federation, like the\r\noverwhelming majority of Member States of the United\r\nNations, firmly rejects the United States embargo\r\nagainst Cuba and favours its repeal. Our position on\r\nthis matter has been steady and consistent: at sessions\r\nof the General Assembly, the Russian Federation has\r\nvoted in favour of draft resolutions calling for an end\r\nto the economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nimposed by the United States against Cuba.\r\nThe Russian Federation believes that the\r\ncontinuation of the United States embargo against\r\nCuba is incompatible with today’s requirements or with\r\nmodern international relations. It is a relic of the cold\r\nwar that creates an artificial impediment to the\r\nestablishment of a world legal order based on the\r\nprovisions of the Charter and the principles of\r\ninternational law and justice.\r\nAlong with other States, the Russian Federation\r\nhas thus repeatedly expressed its disagreement with\r\nUnited States attempts to tighten the embargo and to\r\nexpand the extraterritorial implementation of the\r\nHelms-Burton Act. In our view, this Act is rightly\r\ndescribed as discriminatory and contrary to the Charter\r\nof the United Nations and norms of international law,\r\ninsofar as its extraterritorial effects impinge on the\r\nsovereignty of other States, the legitimate interests of\r\nentities or persons under their jurisdiction and the\r\ngenerally recognized freedom of trade and navigation.\r\nFavouring all realistic steps aimed at normalizing\r\nUnited States-Cuban relations, the Russian Federation\r\nnotes with regret that the tone of American statements\r\non key aspects of its policy towards Havana reveals\r\nthat the United States continues to rely on the sanctions\r\nmethod for bringing pressure to bear on the Republic of\r\nCuba. The Russian Federation is seriously concerned\r\nby United States attempts to strengthen the sanctions\r\nregime against Cuba and to exert pressure on third\r\ncountries and various international organizations, with\r\nthe aim of making them limit their cooperation with\r\nCuba.\r\nAt the same time, we note with satisfaction the\r\napproval by the United States Senate of the legislation\r\nto ease travel restrictions on Americans seeking to visit\r\nCuba. The Russian Federation is convinced that lifting\r\nthe commercial, economic and financial embargo\r\nagainst Cuba would represent a major step towards\r\nnormalizing relations between Havana and Washington,\r\nwould be in the interest of the peoples of Cuba and the\r\nUnited States, and have a beneficial effect on the\r\noverall situation in the Central American and\r\nCaribbean region.\r\nIn keeping with the principles of sovereign\r\nequality of States, non-interference in their internal\r\naffairs and freedom of trade and international\r\nshipping — referred to in the resolution — the Russian\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nFederation reaffirms its intention to continue furthering\r\nnormal trade and economic ties with Cuba, based on\r\nmutual interest and mutual advantage, without\r\ndiscrimination or detriment to the legitimate rights and\r\ninterests of the two countries.\r\nGuided by the fundamental principles of the\r\nCharter concerning the inadmissibility of\r\ndiscriminatory measures or interference in the affairs\r\nof sovereign States, the Russian Federation deemed it\r\nnecessary to vote at the present session as it has at\r\nprevious sessions of the General Assembly, namely, in\r\nfavour of the draft resolution (A/58/L.4) calling for the\r\nembargo to be lifted. We express the hope that the\r\nnormalization of Cuba-United States relations, which\r\nthe international community has consistently\r\nadvocated, will enable the situation in the region to\r\nimprove radically and enable relations between the\r\nUnited States and Cuba to develop on a basis of mutual\r\nunderstanding and close cooperation and in the interest\r\nof the well-being and prosperity of the peoples of both\r\ncountries.\r\nMr. Mantovani (Italy): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union. The acceding\r\ncountries Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia\r\nand Slovenia, the associated countries Bulgaria and\r\nRomania and the European Free Trade Association\r\ncountry member of the European Economic Area\r\nIceland, declare that they align themselves with this\r\nexplanation of vote.\r\nI have the honour to take the floor on behalf of\r\nthe European Union with reference to the resolution\r\nentitled “Necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America against Cuba” (resolution\r\n58/7). The European Union believes that the United\r\nStates trade policy towards Cuba is primarily a bilateral\r\nissue. However, the European Union has to reiterate its\r\nopposition to the extraterritorial aspect of the United\r\nStates embargo that has been implemented in\r\naccordance with the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992\r\nand the Helms-Burton Act of 1996.\r\nThe European Union cannot accept that its\r\neconomic and commercial relations with third countries\r\nbe restricted through unilateral measures imposed by\r\nthe United States on specific countries, in this case\r\nCuba. Therefore, in November 1996, the Council of\r\nMinisters of the European Union adopted a regulation\r\nand a joint action aimed at protecting the interests of\r\nnatural or legal persons from the European Union\r\nagainst the extraterritorial effects of the Helms-Burton\r\nAct.\r\nIt was encouraging that, during their summit in\r\nLondon in 1998, the European Union and the United\r\nStates agreed on a package of measures involving, inter\r\nalia, agreement by the United States to suspend Titles\r\nIII and IV of the Helms-Burton Act and to not adopt\r\nany further extraterritorial legislation of that kind, as\r\nwell as agreement on both sides to increase investment\r\nprotection. The European Union trusts that the United\r\nStates Government will continue to act in accordance\r\nwith the commitments made.\r\nThe European Union’s policy towards Cuba is\r\nclear and coherent with its principles. The Union\r\nadopted its common position on Cuba in December\r\n1996, a position that is still in effect. The main\r\nobjective of the European Union in its relations with\r\nCuba is to encourage a process of peaceful transition to\r\na pluralistic democracy and respect for human rights\r\nand fundamental freedoms, as well as improvement in\r\nthe living standards of the Cuban people. We want this\r\nprocess to move forward as quickly as possible.\r\nThe European Union strongly condemns the\r\nserious deterioration of the human rights situation in\r\nCuba. The increase in violations of human rights has\r\nraised an international wave of protests and\r\ncondemnations and has increased the European Union’s\r\nconcern about the political situation in Cuba.\r\nHowever, constructive engagement still remains\r\nthe basis of the European Union’s policy towards Cuba\r\nand we call upon the Cuban authorities to respond\r\naccordingly. The European Union urges the Cuban\r\nauthorities to bring about speedy, lasting and\r\nsubstantial improvements in the situation, in particular\r\nwith a view to ensuring the full respect for all human\r\nrights. In that connection, the European Union calls for\r\nthe immediate release and full reintegration into\r\nsociety of all prisoners of conscience. We appeal to the\r\nCuban authorities to cooperate fully with international\r\nhuman rights bodies and mechanisms.\r\nThe European Union reaffirms its declaration\r\nmade by the Presidency on 5 June 2003.\r\nThe European Union rejects the restrictions\r\nimposed on the embassies of most European Union\r\nmember States by the Cuban authorities, which\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nconstitute a de facto violation of the Vienna\r\nConvention on Diplomatic Relations.\r\nOn the economic side, the European Union\r\nconsiders that opening up of the Cuban economy to the\r\noutside world continues to be necessary. Economic\r\ngrowth is essential in order to address poverty\r\nalleviation in the country. In that respect, the negative\r\nconsequences of the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica and the severe limitations caused by the\r\ncentralized economic system are working contrary to\r\nthe economic development of the island.\r\nFor all those reasons and in spite of its serious\r\ncriticism of Cuba, the European Union unanimously\r\nvoted in favour of the resolution that has just been\r\nadopted.\r\nMr. Ishikawa (Japan): Japan shares the concerns\r\nexpressed by many delegations today regarding the\r\nextraterritorial application of jurisdiction arising from\r\nthe Helms-Burton Act of the United States, which is\r\nlikely to run counter to international law. My\r\nGovernment has been closely following the\r\nimplementation of the legislation, as well as the\r\ncircumstances surrounding it, and its concerns remain\r\nunchanged. For this reason, my delegation voted in\r\nfavour of draft resolution A/58/L.4.\r\nWhile Japan supported the draft resolution, it has\r\nsome questions as to whether the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly is in fact the most suitable forum in\r\nwhich to address the very complex issue of the United\r\nStates embargo against Cuba. Japan believes that it is\r\ndesirable for both countries to seek a solution through\r\nbilateral dialogue, and thus calls upon them to\r\nstrengthen efforts towards that end.\r\nMs. Rivero (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation has the honour of speaking on behalf of the\r\nmember countries of MERCOSUR, Argentina, Brazil,\r\nParaguay and Uruguay and the associated States Chile\r\nand Bolivia. As in past years, MERCOSUR and\r\nassociated countries voted in favour of the resolution\r\njust adopted by the General Assembly on the necessity\r\nof ending the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America\r\nagainst Cuba.\r\nOur countries, faithful since the very inception of\r\nthis Organization to upholding the objectives and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter, rejected the\r\nextraterritorial application of domestic laws that\r\nbelittles the principle of non-intervention in domestic\r\naffairs and assaults the sovereignty of States.\r\nDisputes between States must be resolved through\r\ndialogue, solidarity and mutual understanding.\r\nCoercive measures are a last resort and can be used\r\nonly in line with the parameters laid down in\r\ninternational law. The application of unilateral coercive\r\nmeasures contradicts the norms of international law,\r\nand at the same time hurts the interests of third\r\ncountries, raises international tensions and weakens the\r\nfight against shared threats.\r\nAs emerges from the responses our countries\r\nhave sent to the Secretary-General in connection with\r\npreparing the report requested in resolution 57/11, we\r\nare convinced that the application of unilateral coercive\r\nmeasures does not contribute to promoting the\r\ndemocratic system and respect and protection of human\r\nrights.\r\nMERCOSUR and its associated countries have\r\nrepeatedly rejected the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica on Cuba in the United Nations General\r\nAssembly, as well as in other international forums,\r\nsuch as the General Assembly of the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, the Ibero-American Summit within\r\nthe Latin American Economic System and the Summit\r\nConference of the Rio Group. The embargo also\r\ncontravenes the juridical obligations incumbent upon\r\nmembers of the World Trade Organization.\r\nFor all of the foregoing reasons that our countries\r\nhave joined in the virtually unanimous rejection\r\nexpressed once again by the international community.\r\nMr. Tesch (Australia): Australia shares the\r\nwidespread concerns about the state of human rights\r\nand political freedoms in Cuba, but we do not consider\r\nthat isolating Cuba through economic sanctions is an\r\neffective means of achieving human rights and political\r\nreform. As a matter of principle, Australia has\r\nconsistently expressed its opposition to the\r\npromulgation and application by Member States of\r\nlaws and measures whose extraterritorial effects\r\nimpinge on the sovereignty of other States, the\r\nlegitimate interest of entities or persons under their\r\njurisdiction, as well as freedom of trade and navigation.\r\nIn Australia’s view such laws and measures are not\r\njustified by the principles of international law and\r\ncomity. Australia is therefore concerned about the\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nunilateral, extraterritorial aspects of the Helms-Burton\r\nAct of 1996 and has therefore again voted in favour of\r\nthe resolution submitted under this item.\r\nMr. Paulovich (Belarus) (spoke in Russian):\r\nDuring the previous session Belarus, together with the\r\noverwhelming majority of Member States, voted in\r\nfavour of resolution 57/11 to end the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America against Cuba. At the same\r\ntime, our delegation is concerned that, since that\r\ndocument was adopted, the situation has not altered\r\nsubstantially. The discussion of this matter at the\r\nAssembly’s current session has given us an opportunity\r\nonce again to confirm the commitment of Belarus to\r\nrespect for the central principles of the sovereign\r\nequality of States, non-intervention in the internal\r\naffairs of States and freedom of international trade and\r\nnavigation.\r\nBelarus has always favoured the abrogation of\r\nunilateral legislation by Member States the\r\nextraterritorial nature of which affects the sovereignty\r\nof other States, as well as the legal and financial\r\ninterests within their jurisdiction and freedom of trade\r\nand navigation. In accordance with the fundamental\r\nprinciples of international law, including the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations, Belarus has not applied, nor has it\r\nany intention of applying in future, any measures of\r\nthat kind. My delegation believes that international\r\ndisputes should only be resolved through negotiations\r\non the basis of respect for the principles of equality and\r\nmutual benefit.\r\nMy Government is convinced that the conditions\r\nare ripe for the gradual resolution of the dispute\r\nbetween the United States and Cuba, and it calls upon\r\nthe parties to step up their efforts in that regard. As this\r\nis our position, Belarus supported the draft resolution\r\nwhich was tabled for consideration before today’s\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Strømmen (Norway): The Norwegian\r\nGovernment believes there is a clear distinction\r\nbetween unilateral measures, on the one hand, and\r\nsanctions adopted by the international community,\r\nthrough the United Nations, on the other. In our view,\r\nno country should impose its legislation on third\r\ncountries. Norway has, therefore, once again voted for\r\nthe resolution.\r\nThe embargo cannot, however, in any way justify\r\nthe lack of civil and political rights in Cuba, and the\r\ncurrent persecution of peaceful dissidents, writers and\r\njournalists that take place in that country.\r\nThe President: One representative has requested\r\nthe right to exercise the right of reply. May I remind\r\nmembers that statements in the exercise of the right of\r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention\r\nand to 5 minutes for the second intervention, and\r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Requeijo Gual (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nMy delegation wishes to intervene to express its\r\nsurprise at the statements just made in explanation of\r\nvote by the representative of Italy, on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union and various associated States, and by\r\nthe representative of Norway.\r\nThese statements are vivid proof of the European\r\nUnion’s hesitation in the face of United States pressure,\r\nand in asking Cuba what they do not dare ask the\r\nUnited States they betray their dependence and total\r\nhypocrisy. My delegation regrets the fact that Italy’s\r\nstatement went beyond the scope of the discussion on\r\nitem 29, which is clearly spelled out on the agenda of\r\nthe current session of the Assembly and, instead,\r\nmoved into areas recalling the old, exhausted\r\narguments of the past that for almost 45 years have\r\nserved as the basis for the genocidal policy pursued by\r\nsuccessive United States Administrations to bring Cuba\r\ndown by hunger and disease.\r\nThe attack against the Cuban social order, which\r\nthe Cuban people have chosen in free exercise of their\r\nright to self-determination, sovereignty and\r\nindependence, is rejected by my delegation in the name\r\nof the more than 11 million Cubans who,\r\nnotwithstanding blockades and semi-blockades, stand\r\nfirm and hold up the banners of dignity and valour. Our\r\npeople reject those fallacies and distortions, coming\r\nfrom the most reactionary and backward circles still\r\nsuffering from outdated colonial-era syndromes which\r\nhave been happily overcome for all time within Cuba\r\nitself.\r\nIn Cuba no one is arrested or tried for his or her\r\nreligious beliefs or for voicing their opinions. The\r\nrepresentative of Italy must know that those individuals\r\nhe mentions worked for years as employees of a\r\nforeign and hostile Power, receiving specific\r\ninstructions as to what to do and how to act, as well as\r\nmaterial and financial backing from the United States\r\nGovernment and from extreme right-wing Cuban-\r\nAmerican groups based in North American territory.\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.54\r\nThese individuals’ sole objective was to subvert Cuba’s\r\ndomestic order and harm its economic, political and\r\nsocial system, with the goal of re-establishing the\r\nsituation of dependency and subordination vis-à-vis the\r\nUnited States that it suffered under for over half a\r\ncentury.\r\nThe individuals in question blatantly violated\r\nCuban law and acted on behalf of a foreign Power, thus\r\ncontravening the most basic interests of their country\r\nby favouring its annexation by this foreign Power. The\r\nrepresentative of Italy must know that those individuals\r\nimplicated in those offences were tried by established\r\ncourts, enjoying all guarantees and due process, in\r\nconformity with our Constitution and our domestic\r\nlegislation. These individuals enjoyed full freedom to\r\nappoint their own attorneys and freely voiced whatever\r\nthey wished to say in oral public hearings. They had\r\nthe opportunity to call witnesses and produce evidence\r\nand benefited from their right to make their final\r\nstatements as provided under the law. The punishments\r\nimposed upon those accused were in accordance with\r\nCuba’s Criminal Code, which guarantees the right to\r\nthose accused to appeal before a superior court\r\nestablished for that purpose.\r\nIt is surprising to hear the distinguished\r\nrepresentative of Italy show such keen interest in the\r\nfull reincorporation of so-called prisoners of\r\nconscience within Cuban society, when the European\r\nUnion has not shown any similar concern over the trial\r\nbrought in Miami against five young Cubans for having\r\nfought against the terrorism occurring daily against\r\nCuba from the United States, and who were sentenced\r\nto long and harsh sentences, including life sentences,\r\nfollowing a spurious trial bereft of any such rights.\r\nWe still remember Favio di Celmo, a young\r\nItalian who died in 1997 as a result of a bomb placed in\r\na hotel in Havana by mercenary hands paid by the very\r\nsame terrorists. Yet despite the European Union’s\r\nalleged concern for the lot of its nationals, it has never\r\nissued a declaration. It is regrettable that some member\r\ncountries of the European Union should have endorsed\r\nthe subversive provocative activities perpetrated by the\r\nUnited States Interests Section in Cuba, in pursuit of\r\nthe hostile policies that this august Assembly has just\r\nnow all but unanimously repudiated. These provocative\r\nand subversive activities are the ones that violate all\r\nthe norms and conventions governing regulations\r\nbetween States, in particular the Vienna Convention on\r\nDiplomatic Relations of 1961. The strong repudiation\r\nby the Cuban people of such actions is the basis for the\r\nrepeated reference to this Convention by Cuban\r\nauthorities when addressing representatives of the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nMy delegation regrets the path being followed by\r\nsome members of the European Union in their ties with\r\nCuba, not in terms of the dialogue they propose but in\r\nterms of their confrontational stance, including the\r\nsuspension of cooperative programmes, an action taken\r\nby the Italian Government at the beginning of this year\r\nin a sort of laughable caricature of the United States\r\nblockade they had just claimed to denounce.\r\nMy delegation, together with other delegations\r\ngathered here, voices its full repudiation of the decision\r\nadopted this year by the European Union to suspend all\r\ncultural ties with Cuba. This not only adversely affects\r\nthe Cuban people and their cultural efforts, but also\r\nkeeps the peoples of the European Union from gaining\r\naccess to an autonomous and vibrant culture which,\r\ndespite over 40 years of isolation and blockade, has\r\nmanaged to maintain itself.\r\nIt is inconceivable that the European Union\r\nshould have resorted to political indecision and\r\nobscurantism here at the threshold of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, when they talk about communication and\r\ndialogue among civilizations and the globalization of\r\nculture. The Cuban delegation reaffirms that,\r\nnotwithstanding the well-known blockade and those\r\nlesser-known forms of blockade that others would seek\r\nto impose upon the Cuban people through coercive\r\nmeasures based upon a moral double standard and\r\nhypocrisy, the independence that has cost us so much\r\nto obtain and to keep, will be preserved and indeed\r\nstrengthened even if this displeases certain reactionary\r\nand backward circles.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda\r\nitem 29?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n"
