Hunte. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Alimov\r\n(Tajikistan), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 14 (continued)\r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(a) Note by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nreport  of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (A/58/312)\r\n(b) Draft resolution (A/58/L.10)\r\nMr. Kmoníček (Czech Republic): At the outset, I\r\nwould like to thank Mr. ElBaradei, Director-General of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for\r\nhis informative and comprehensive opening statement\r\nhighlighting the Agency’s achievements during the\r\nperiod under consideration.\r\nI would like to reaffirm that the Czech Republic\r\nassociates itself with the statement delivered by\r\nrepresentative of Italy on behalf of the European\r\nUnion. Allow me, however, to make some additional\r\nobservations regarding the latest developments in my\r\ncountry, mainly in the area of technology and safety\r\nand concerning Czech involvement in international\r\ncooperation in the field of the peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy.\r\nThe main issues in the area of the peaceful uses\r\nof nuclear energy relate to global security and to the\r\nrole of nuclear energy in sustainable development.\r\nThere is no doubt that it is in the common interest of\r\nhumankind to maximize the benefits and minimize the\r\nrisks emanating from nuclear sciences and their\r\napplications. The Czech Republic expects that the\r\nIAEA will continue to serve the needs of the\r\ninternational community while endeavouring to\r\nachieve that paramount objective.\r\nThe commissioning of two Temelin nuclear-\r\npower plants has been a prominent issue in the past few\r\nyears with respect to the use of nuclear energy in the\r\nCzech Republic. We welcome the fact that the\r\nexcitement has died down and that the issue can now\r\nbe dealt with on its own merits by experts.\r\nBoth Temelin units are operating at 100 per cent\r\npower, and the trial operation phase is continuing. Of\r\ncourse, there is still quite a challenge facing the plant\r\noperator to complete transfer of the units from the\r\nconstruction and commissioning phase to the mode of\r\nstandard operation and to establish the highest possible\r\nstandards of operational safety while maintaining\r\nsufficient operational efficiency. But this is usual for\r\nany new unit at the start of its operational life.\r\nAlready, a considerable amount of experience has\r\nbeen gained with the Temelin nuclear power plant. We\r\nare prepared to share it with all who may be interested.\r\nBut I would like to mention here at least one of the\r\nlessons learned. The Temelin plant could not have been\r\ncompleted without the broad use of international\r\ncooperation by all parties involved in the project.\r\nVendors from more than 10 countries were represented\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\non the side of the construction licence holder, most of\r\nthem taking part in significant safety improvements to\r\nthe original project.\r\nClose cooperation by the  national regulatory\r\nauthority with its partners in several countries and with\r\nvarious international agencies allowed for an\r\nindependent peer review during the different phases of\r\nthe authorization process and, last but not least,\r\ncontributed to the high level of transparency. The\r\ncriticism by some of an unfeasible mix of technologies\r\nand approaches proved unjustified in the end. The clue\r\nto success was the ability to integrate and coordinate\r\nthe project.\r\nMoreover, any new project, today or in the future,\r\nwill have to be designed on such a cooperative basis.\r\nWe have to take note of that fact and review and\r\nmodify our networks and platforms of cooperation in\r\nline with this trend without delay. It does not matter if\r\nwe speak about other issues such as knowledge\r\nmaintenance, common safety standards and fuel cycle\r\nback-end. The subject remains the same, and working\r\ntogether we have a better chance to control the\r\nsituation and influence the result. In that regard, we\r\nshould further explore how to better use the assets we\r\nhave in the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA).\r\nThe Czech Republic is prepared to actively\r\ncontribute to any efforts that could lead to an increase\r\nin capacities and experience sharing in the safe use of\r\nnuclear energy. In that respect, allow me to use this\r\nopportunity once again to express words of\r\nappreciation to the Agency for its prompt and\r\nprofessional response to our requests for an\r\nindependent third-party peer review of various phases\r\nof the construction of the Temelin nuclear power plant.\r\nIn that context, the Czech Republic recognizes\r\nthe importance of technical cooperation among IAEA\r\nmember States. With the aim of supporting such\r\nendeavours, a number of Czech organizations and\r\nindividual experts have actively taken part in the\r\ntechnical cooperation programme and other Agency-\r\nsponsored activities. In addition, as in previous years,\r\nthe Government of the Czech Republic offered\r\nadditional financial resources for extrabudgetary\r\nsupport of various Agency activities.\r\nIn the framework of the IAEA technical\r\ncooperation programme the Czech Republic\r\ncontributed to four projects in countries of the former\r\nSoviet Union in 2003. Themes of these projects vary\r\nfrom nuclear power plant safety in Armenia and\r\nUkraine, to radiation protection issues and medical\r\napplications in Moldova, to the safety of the research\r\nreactor in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The Czech Republic\r\nhas co-sponsored the training of more than 80 experts\r\nfrom around the world in the area of radiation\r\nprotection and radioactive waste safety. Furthermore,\r\nthe Czech Republic has supported, through in-kind\r\ncontributions, seven training courses and workshops\r\norganized in the Czech Republic by the IAEA since\r\nlast September.\r\nSecurity issues are of utmost importance in\r\ntoday’s world. In addition to a variety of actions inside\r\nthe country, the Czech Republic decided to contribute\r\nto the IAEA Nuclear Security Fund. That is in line with\r\nour long-term strategy to support concerted actions in\r\nreaction to common problems.\r\nLast but not least, in spring of this year the Czech\r\nRepublic joined the IAEA Safeguards Support\r\nProgramme by signing the relevant cooperative\r\narrangement. In the midterm plan worked out by Czech\r\nand Agency experts, specific areas have been identified\r\nwhere the Czech Republic can join the efforts of the\r\nother 16 participant States and contribute to further\r\nenhancement of the Agency’s safeguards. By that step,\r\nthe Czech Republic shows clear evidence of our full\r\ncommitment to the global process of securing nuclear\r\nweapons non-proliferation.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reassure the Assembly of\r\nmy Government’s continued commitment to supporting\r\nand expanding the Agency role in international\r\ncooperation and in the peaceful and safe use of nuclear\r\nenergy and ionizing radiation for the benefit of all\r\nMember States.\r\nMr. Kryzhanivsky (Ukraine): It is with great\r\ninterest that Ukraine acknowledges the report of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the\r\nyear 2002. We welcome the statement of the Director\r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in\r\nwhich he provided additional information on the main\r\nactivities of the Agency during 2003. Using this\r\nopportunity, I would like to congratulate the IAEA\r\nsecretariat and Director General Mohamed ElBaradei\r\non the excellent work done by the Agency.\r\nThe draft resolution on the report of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (A/58/L.10),\r\nwhich Ukraine welcomes, represents a broad agreement\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nreached among Member States in Vienna, and we hope\r\nit can be adopted by consensus. We welcome the\r\noutcome of the forty-seventh session of the IAEA\r\nGeneral Conference held in Vienna from 15 to 19\r\nSeptember 2003.\r\nUkraine is strongly committed to the three\r\npillars — nuclear safety, technology and verification\r\nand security — which form the basis of the Agency’s\r\nmandate. Ukraine believes that global implementation\r\nof an effective system of strengthened safeguards will\r\ndeliver universal security benefits. In Ukraine’s view,\r\nthe Agency’s verification and promotional activities are\r\nmutually reinforcing in nature. Strengthening the\r\ncredibility of the Agency’s verification system\r\npromotes confidence in nuclear science and\r\ntechnology.\r\nThe comprehensive nuclear non-proliferation\r\nregime, of a universal character and backed by a strong\r\nsystem of international safeguards requiring States to\r\nproperly account for and control nuclear materials,\r\nforms an essential basis for international efforts to\r\nmaintain collective security. We are convinced that it is\r\nthe responsibility of Member States to promote the\r\nuniversality of the non-proliferation regime and to\r\nensure compliance with international instruments in\r\nthat field.\r\nIn that connection we would like to express our\r\ndeep concern over the decision of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea to withdraw from the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) and to renounce its obligations under the\r\nsafeguards agreement. We regard such actions as\r\njeopardizing the global non-proliferation regime. We\r\nbelieve that North Korea should relinquish its nuclear\r\nambitions and readmit IAEA inspectors as soon as\r\npossible so as to finally enable the Agency to verify the\r\ncorrectness and completeness of the initial declaration\r\nof nuclear material made by the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea.\r\nUkraine continues to consider the Additional\r\nProtocols as an integral part of the IAEA safeguards\r\nsystem; adherence to them is an essential means of\r\nproviding strict fulfilment of the obligations under\r\narticle III of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. We fully\r\nendorse measures envisaged by the Additional\r\nProtocol.\r\nAs of today, preparatory activities for the\r\nratification of the Additional Protocol signed by\r\nUkraine in 2000 are under way. Sharing concerns\r\nexpressed by the Director General, we call upon States\r\nparties to the NPT which have not yet entered into\r\nsafeguards agreements to fulfil their obligation under\r\narticle III of the Treaty to conclude comprehensive\r\nsafeguards agreements.\r\nUkraine also wishes to recall its concern\r\nregarding the continued existence of unsafeguarded\r\nnuclear facilities and materials in States that are not\r\nparties to the NPT or equivalent treaties. Ukraine calls\r\nupon those States to place all their nuclear activities\r\nunder IAEA safeguards.\r\nThe Agency has an essential role to play in\r\ncombating the threat of terrorism. We commend the\r\nIAEA Director General and the Agency’s secretariat\r\nfor quickly responding to this challenge by reinforcing\r\nand re-orienting some of its ongoing activities and then\r\nby presenting plans for activities aimed at helping\r\nmember States secure a nuclear security framework for\r\nnuclear installations. We believe that an enhanced\r\nphysical protection regime, the safe storage of nuclear\r\nmaterials, the prevention of their illegal trafficking, the\r\nimprovement of their record-keeping and control,\r\ncombined with other measures to increase the\r\nefficiency of the IAEA control system, will make it\r\npossible to deny terrorists and their accomplices access\r\nto hazardous materials.\r\nThe primary responsibility for ensuring necessary\r\nnuclear security clearly rests with member States. The\r\nactivities of the Agency can only support national\r\nmeasures to counter nuclear terrorism. Technical\r\ncooperation programmes are already playing an\r\nimportant role in upgrading safety and security and, in\r\nthat context, will also be a valuable instrument.\r\nThe 1995 and 2000 NPT Review Conferences\r\nidentified the conclusion of a Fissile Material Cut-Off\r\nTreaty as one of the most urgent disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation steps the international community should\r\ntake. We commend the Agency for its ongoing\r\ncontribution to the dialogue on possible verification\r\nrequirements for that Treaty.\r\nAs a full-fledged State party to the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, Ukraine joins\r\nin the call for its swift entry into force.\r\nWe welcome the Agency’s progress in\r\nstrengthening the Code of Conduct on the Safety and\r\nSecurity of Radioactive Sources. There is an obvious\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nneed to further improve controls of high activity\r\nsources to protect against the risk of radiological\r\nterrorism.\r\nUkraine supports the work of the Agency to\r\namend the Convention on the Physical Protection of\r\nNuclear Material. We call on all delegations\r\nparticipating in this process to work constructively to\r\nachieve consensus on outstanding issues.\r\nMy country ranks among those that operate\r\npeaceful nuclear facilities. According to its national\r\nenergy strategy plan, nuclear energy will remain, in the\r\nmedium term, a substantive source of our energy\r\nproduction. The safe operation of nuclear facilities\r\ncontinues to be our utmost priority. With that in mind, I\r\nwould like to emphasize the very important role of the\r\nIAEA in providing technical assistance to member\r\nStates and to note considerable progress in increasing\r\nthe efficiency of technical cooperation programmes.\r\nUkraine actively participates in the Agency’s national\r\nand regional technical cooperation projects, giving\r\nhigh priority to projects related to nuclear safety, the\r\nmanagement of resources and the extension of life\r\ncycles of Ukrainian nuclear reactors. We also pay due\r\nattention to issues of application of nuclear\r\ntechnologies in industry, medicine and agriculture.\r\nMy delegation expresses its appreciation to the\r\nIAEA and the United Nations for their initiative in\r\naddressing the Chernobyl problem, in the context of\r\nefforts to resolve issues connected with the\r\ntransformation of the “shelter” into an ecologically\r\nsecure system, and the minimization of nuclear and\r\nradioactive risks from the destroyed fourth nuclear\r\nreactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. Ukraine\r\nis deeply convinced that the work of the established\r\npanel of experts to discuss existing modalities and\r\nconcerns of the Chernobyl problem will provide\r\nvaluable guidance for adopting practical measures as\r\nan integral element of the regional sustainable\r\ndevelopment plan.\r\nUkraine is well aware of the increasingly difficult\r\ncontext in which the Agency must finance its statutory\r\nobligations under the regular budget. Every effort\r\nshould be made to ensure that the IAEA has adequate\r\nfinancial resources. The Agency’s safeguards budget\r\nneeds to be increased so that it can implement the\r\neffective safeguards we need.\r\nThe Ukrainian Government fully supports the\r\nDirector General in his continued efforts to improve\r\nthe Agency’s effectiveness. A results-based approach\r\nto budgeting requires strong management and a clear\r\ndefinition of cross-cutting activities. Enhanced\r\ncooperation and coordination should be encouraged\r\nbetween departments, leading to greater synergy and\r\nbetter use of resources — human as well as financial.\r\nFinally, let me assure the Assembly that Ukraine\r\nfully supports the role the IAEA plays as the competent\r\nauthority for the verification of compliance with the\r\ninternational nuclear non-proliferation regime, as well\r\nas its role in promoting the safe usage of nuclear\r\ntechnologies for peaceful application in member States\r\nthat have chosen to use that technology. It is of critical\r\nimportance that member States maintain the\r\nmomentum of the Agency’s work on strengthened\r\nsafeguards and other verification activities.\r\nNana Effah-Apenteng (Ghana): At the outset,\r\nallow me to express my appreciation to Mr. Mohamed\r\nElBaradei, Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his introduction of\r\nthe report of the Agency for 2002, and especially for\r\nhis lucid account of other major developments since\r\nthe date of issuance of the report.\r\nThe IAEA, as the world’s foremost\r\nintergovernmental forum for scientific and technical\r\ncooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear technology,\r\nhas displayed admirable steadfastness in the wake of\r\ndiverse challenges and its apt responses to pertinent\r\nneeds arising from the harnessing of this technology.\r\nPresently, the Agency’s broad spectrum of\r\nservices, programmes and activities, based on the needs\r\nof its 136 members, has contributed its share in\r\npromoting sustainable development. My delegation is\r\npleased to note that it has been unwavering in fostering\r\nworldwide cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear\r\ntechnology and in promoting global nuclear safety\r\nthrough its verification activities. Peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear technologies, particularly in helping fight\r\ndisease, enhancing agricultural production, the\r\npreservation of food, managing water resources and\r\nmonitoring the environment, are key in global\r\ndevelopmental efforts.\r\nThe annual report for 2002 gives a clear\r\nindication of how the Agency actively continued to\r\npromote research and development on innovative\r\nnuclear reactors and fuel cycles, which injected new\r\nvitality into the development and peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy. The Agency has invested considerable\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nresources in the establishment and improvement of\r\nsafety criteria to cover all kinds of nuclear activities.\r\nFurthermore, through technology transfer and capacity-\r\nbuilding, the Agency has forged strategic technical\r\ncooperation partnerships, which are needs-driven and\r\ntherefore focus on the demands of member States.\r\nGhana, through its Atomic Energy Commission\r\n(GAEC), has attempted to encourage and promote the\r\ncommercialization of research and development results\r\nby aligning the Commission’s research activities with\r\nthe needs of the country. This has called for close\r\ncollaboration between the GAEC on the one hand, and\r\nindustry and the other productive and social sectors on\r\nthe other. Under the auspices of the three main\r\noperational institutes set up by the Commission -the\r\nNational Nuclear Research Institute, the Radiation\r\nProtection Institute and the Biotechnology and Nuclear\r\nAgriculture Research Institute — a number of research\r\nactivities were undertaken during the year with the aim\r\nof having a positive socio-economic impact. These\r\nincluded projects related to animal nutrition,\r\nproduction and health research, radiotherapy, nuclear\r\nmedicine, gamma irradiation of food and medical\r\nproducts.\r\nIn addition to these activities and as part of\r\nefforts to harness nuclear and biotechnology techniques\r\nfor socio-economic advancement and self-reliance, the\r\nCommission has established a business development\r\nunit to identify demand-driven research and\r\ndevelopment activities and services and prepare\r\nbusiness plans to address such activities and services in\r\na cost-effective manner. To enable it to achieve these\r\nobjectives, the unit has also been assigned the\r\nresponsibility of planning and coordinating all capital\r\nmobilization activities, introducing nuclear\r\ntechnologies to the public, negotiating the sale of\r\ntechnologies and arranging partnerships with relevant\r\nstakeholders.\r\nFinally, under the framework of the African\r\nRegional Cooperation Agreement for Research,\r\nDevelopment and Training related to Nuclear Science\r\nand Technology, the facilities and equipment of the\r\nGhana Atomic Energy Commission have been used for\r\nthe training of students from Ghana’s universities and\r\nof researchers from Ghanaian and other African\r\ninstitutions through regular training programmes\r\nsponsored by the Agency. Ghana is especially\r\ncommitted to the latter project, in view of the\r\ndifficulties it has been experiencing with the retention\r\nof trained personnel.\r\nAt this juncture, my delegation would like to\r\npoint out that those activities could not have been\r\nsuccessfully carried out without the help of the Agency,\r\nwhich has consistently promoted programmes aimed at\r\ntransferring mature and established technologies from\r\ndeveloped countries to less developed ones, through its\r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme. I therefore wish to\r\nplace on record Ghana’s appreciation for the technical\r\nassistance provided by the Agency and look forward to\r\nfurther fruitful cooperation in the years ahead. It is for\r\nthis reason that the Ghana delegation urges all member\r\nStates and donor organizations to pay their\r\ncontributions on time, so that the Agency will be\r\nfinancially able to continue with this much needed and\r\ngreatly appreciated programme.\r\nOne of the most pertinent issues facing the IAEA\r\ntoday is the need to strengthen the Agency’s safeguards\r\nsystem for verification, which increases the likelihood\r\nof detecting any clandestine nuclear weapons\r\nprogramme in breach of international obligations.\r\nAdherence by all States to the strengthened safeguards\r\nsystem is a crucial component of this endeavour. It is\r\nonly through the widest possible application of the\r\nstrengthened safeguards system, based on relevant\r\nagreements and additional protocols, that the full\r\npotential of the system will be realized. In this\r\nconnection, I am pleased to state that the Parliament of\r\nGhana has now ratified a number of IAEA protocols.\r\nHowever, it should be noted that, even before\r\nratification, Ghana had been complying fully with the\r\nprovisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and its Additional Protocols.\r\nWe would like to encourage all Member States who\r\nhave yet to do so to conclude the relevant safeguards\r\nagreements and additional protocols with the Agency.\r\nIt is the firm conviction of my country that\r\nnuclear disarmament is still a priority issue in\r\ncontemporary international relations. That is why we\r\nview with great concern the fact that progress on\r\nnuclear disarmament and on the programme of work of\r\nthe Conference on Disarmament has been rather slow.\r\nNuclear weapons are weapons of mass destruction. All\r\nnuclear weapons must therefore be decommissioned\r\nwith a view to creating a peaceful and a safer world. It\r\nis our duty to humanity to increase nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree-zones in all regions of the world. Non-nuclear-\r\nweapon States must also be assured that they will not\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nbecome victims of nuclear-weapon strikes. We do not\r\nsubscribe to the view that there are some “highly\r\nresponsible” States that deserve to have a monopoly\r\nover nuclear technology. Such a policy — bordering on\r\nthe unbridled use of a double-standard — will\r\nundermine the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons and the nuclear safeguards regime of\r\nthe IAEA, thereby fuelling the ambitions of certain\r\nStates to join the ranks of the nuclear-weapons elite.\r\nMy delegation wishes to reiterate its principled\r\nposition that, although the primary responsibility for\r\nnuclear safety rests with national Governments,\r\ninternational cooperation in this area is vital. Ghana\r\nwelcomes the Agency’s attempts to help Member\r\nStates to reinforce nuclear safety infrastructure\r\nfacilities, as well as to improve related laws and\r\nregulations. The preparation of a code of conduct and\r\nthe exploration of possible means of strengthening the\r\nsystem for monitoring the safety of research reactors is\r\na step in the right direction. Ghana also calls for the\r\nuniversal application of the Agency’s safety standards\r\nand their incorporation into national rules and\r\nregulations.\r\nWith the ever-increasing threat of nuclear\r\nterrorism in the world, the importance of IAEA\r\nactivities aimed at protecting States against such\r\ndespicable conduct is well noted. Attention has rightly\r\nbeen given to concrete and practical steps that would\r\nprovide for the enhanced protection of nuclear\r\nmaterials and their safe and secure storage. We\r\nwelcome, in particular, the preparation of an action\r\nplan for the prevention of nuclear terrorism. However,\r\nin seeking to mitigate this threat, equal emphasis must\r\nbe placed on the three main pillars of the Agency’s\r\nactivities. Efforts in this regard must equally be\r\nmatched by efforts to promote non-proliferation and\r\nthe developmental activities of the IAEA, especially in\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nIn conclusion, years of experience have shown\r\nthat nuclear technology can play an important role in\r\nour quest to achieve sustainable development. Through\r\nthe various peaceful uses of nuclear technology,\r\ncountries can increase social welfare and alleviate\r\npoverty, which will, in turn, help us to meet the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Ghana looks forward\r\nto enhanced cooperation with the IAEA in the coming\r\nyears.\r\nMr. Ismail (Malaysia): I join others in thanking\r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his\r\npresentation to the General Assembly of the annual\r\nreport of the Agency for 2002. Allow me also to thank\r\nAmbassador Antonio Núñez Garcia-Saúco of Spain,\r\ncurrent Chairman of the Board of Governors, for\r\nintroducing draft resolution A/58/L.10.\r\nMalaysia recognizes the value of nuclear\r\ntechnology for the achievement of sustainable\r\ndevelopment and the process of nation-building. We\r\nreaffirm our support for the IAEA in its mission to\r\npromote and facilitate the development of nuclear\r\ntechnology for peaceful uses, as embodied in article II\r\nof its statute. In our view, the Agency’s Technical\r\nCooperation Programme remains a crucial component\r\nof its mandate and activities. Malaysia is a beneficiary\r\nof this programme, and we commend the Department\r\nof Technical Cooperation of the IAEA for its\r\ncontinuous efforts in discharging its statutory mandate\r\nfor the benefit of the recipient member States and for\r\nits creditable achievements.\r\nWe are gratified that in 2002, there was an\r\nincrease in the budget of the technical cooperation\r\nprogramme to an all-time high of $98.1 million.\r\nHowever, we note with great concern that payments to\r\nthe Technical Cooperation Fund (TCF) fell below the\r\n85 per cent rate of attainment set for 2002. We hope\r\nthat this situation will not repeat itself in the future. We\r\ntrust that Member States, especially the major donors,\r\nwill continue to support the inalienable right of\r\ncountries to develop peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nMalaysia attaches great importance to the issue of\r\nnuclear safety, including the issue of the shipment of\r\nhigh-level nuclear waste. The risk posed by such\r\nshipments to coastal States is immensely hazardous and\r\ncould have potentially fatal consequences. This must\r\nalso be given due recognition by the international\r\ncommunity in accordance with the relevant provisions\r\nof international law. Malaysia therefore values the\r\nopportunity for further dialogue on this issue. The\r\nInternational Conference on the Safety of Transport of\r\nRadioactive Material, held in Vienna from 7 to 11 July\r\n2003, provided a good forum for such a dialogue. In\r\nthat connection, Malaysia welcomes IAEA General\r\nConference resolution GC(47)/RES/7A concerning\r\nmeasures to strengthen international cooperation in\r\nnuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety, including\r\nthose aspects relating to maritime safety and the\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nrequest to develop an action plan based on the results\r\nof the Conference.\r\nLike others, Malaysia recognizes the threat posed\r\nby nuclear terrorism to public safety and the security of\r\nStates. We agree that the international community must\r\ncollectively work out and implement new and stronger\r\nmeasures to prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear\r\nweapons and using them to achieve their objectives. In\r\nthat regard, we welcome the Agency’s efforts in\r\npromoting nuclear security, in particular in providing\r\nassistance and technical support to States. We\r\nespecially welcome the efforts to improve and\r\ninnovate, and to design new IAEA services provided to\r\nStates to upgrade nuclear security, including the\r\nInternational Physical Protection Advisory Service, the\r\nInternational Nuclear Security Advisory Service and\r\nthe International State System of Accounting and\r\nControl Advisory Service.\r\nWhile measures to promote nuclear security and\r\ncombat nuclear trafficking should be stepped up,\r\nserious efforts should also be made towards achieving\r\nthe total elimination of nuclear weapons to provide an\r\nabsolute guarantee against the use of such weapons in\r\nterrorist activities. The intrinsic link between this\r\nquestion and the larger question of terrorism as a whole\r\nmust also be addressed.\r\nThe IAEA is also entrusted with the mandate of\r\nverifying that peaceful nuclear technology is not\r\ntransformed to fulfil military purposes. Its safeguards\r\nsystem is a major element of the nuclear non-\r\nproliferation regime. Malaysia supports the verification\r\nactivities of the Agency in accordance with article III\r\nof the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT). As a State party to the NPT, Malaysia\r\nmaintains the conviction that the continued existence\r\nof nuclear weapons poses a threat to mankind and that\r\ntheir use would have catastrophic consequences for our\r\ncivilization. In that connection, Malaysia is committed\r\nto pursuing the non-proliferation and total ban of\r\nnuclear weapons, including new types of nuclear\r\nweapons. We strongly believe that the absolute goal of\r\na nuclear-free world must remain high on the\r\ninternational disarmament agenda. The continued\r\npossession, proliferation and improvement of nuclear\r\nweapons should be a source of great concern to the\r\ninternational community in the light of the grave\r\ndanger that they pose to international peace and\r\nsecurity. We believe that the States parties to the NPT\r\nmust genuinely revisit the issue of compliance by both\r\nnuclear and non-nuclear weapon States at their 2005\r\nreview conference and in that conference’s preparatory\r\nprocess.\r\nThe nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula is of\r\nconcern to Malaysia. We support efforts to address the\r\nissue peacefully among the concerned parties. In that\r\nconnection, we welcome the recent efforts to resume\r\nthe six-party talks in the near future. We hope\r\ncontinued dialogue among the parties will result in a\r\nnuclear-free Korean peninsula.\r\nMalaysia welcomes the submission of Iran’s\r\ndeclaration to the Agency with regard to its nuclear\r\nprogramme and its decision to complete an additional\r\nprotocol. We note that the Agency has started its\r\nintensive verification process and is making good\r\nprogress. We look forward to the Director General’s\r\nsubmission of the next report to the Board of\r\nGovernors in November. We encourage Iran and the\r\nIAEA to continue to strengthen the cooperation\r\nbetween them to resolve the issue amicably.\r\nMalaysia keenly looks forward to the resolution\r\nof another issue that is on the agenda of the Agency:\r\nthe verification of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction,\r\nincluding its alleged nuclear weapons programme.\r\nMalaysia is of the view that a resumption of the\r\nmandate of the IAEA and the United Nations\r\nMonitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission\r\n(UNMOVIC) in Iraq could help in allowing the two\r\nbodies to conclude their work of verifying and making\r\nan independent assessment of the existence of Iraqi\r\nweapons of mass destruction. We note that the Agency\r\nhad recently made an appeal for it to be given the\r\nopportunity to resume its mandate.\r\nThe three main pillars of the IAEA’s mandate and\r\nactivity are verification, technical cooperation and\r\nsafety and security. In discharging its statutory\r\nmandate, the Agency has to preserve the balance\r\nbetween prohibiting the diversion of peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear technology to military purposes and the\r\nlegitimate right of States to exploit the benefits of\r\nnuclear technology for peaceful uses to achieve\r\nsustainable development. The Agency’s vitality will\r\ndepend on how it meets the expectations of all its\r\nconstituents. Malaysia reaffirms its commitment to\r\ncooperate with the IAEA to achieve those objectives.\r\nMr. Hu Xiaodi (China) (spoke in Chinese): At\r\nthe outset, I would like to thank Mr. ElBaradei,\r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nAgency (IAEA), for introducing the report on the work\r\nof the Agency in 2002.\r\nOver the past year, with the concerted efforts of\r\nthe IAEA secretariat and member States, the Agency\r\nhas done a remarkable job towards realizing the two\r\nmajor objectives of its Statute: preventing nuclear-\r\nweapon proliferation and promoting peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy. We are satisfied with the overall efforts\r\nof the Agency, and we would like to congratulate its\r\nsecretariat on the achievements made under the\r\nleadership of Director General ElBaradei. We hope that\r\nthe Agency will further strengthen its technical\r\ncooperation activities and adopt effective measures to\r\npromote peaceful uses of nuclear energy in all areas.\r\nAs a member of the IAEA, China has actively\r\nsupported the Agency’s work in all areas. In the sphere\r\nof non-proliferation, China has supported the Agency\r\nin strengthening safeguards and consolidating the\r\ninternational non-proliferation machinery. In March\r\n2002, China completed the legal procedure for the\r\nentry into force of an Additional Protocol between\r\nChina and the Agency, the first among the five nuclear-\r\nweapon States to do so, and has since presented\r\nrelevant declarations to the Agency. We call on all\r\ncountries with major nuclear activities to sign and\r\nratify additional protocols as soon as possible. The\r\nChinese Government and the Agency have agreed to\r\nopen a training course in China early next year on\r\nnuclear-material accountancy and control.\r\nChina fully endorses the Agency’s efforts to\r\nenhance the physical protection of nuclear material. In\r\ncollaboration with the Agency, a training programme\r\non the physical protection of nuclear material facilities\r\nwas successfully held in China at the end of last year.\r\nChina contributed $100,000 in kind to that event.\r\nAs a developing country, China has taken an\r\nactive part in the Agency’s promotional activities. We\r\nhave contributed $1.09 million to the Technical\r\nCooperation Fund and $110,000 to activities of the\r\nRegional Cooperative Agreement for the Asia-Pacific\r\nregion. Every year, China hosts dozens of training\r\ncourses, seminars, academic conferences and other\r\npromotional activities and receives experts sent by the\r\nAgency for further training. We stand ready to continue\r\ncontributing, within our capacity, to all activities of the\r\nAgency.\r\nNow, I wish to speak briefly on the position of\r\nthe Chinese Government on the Korean peninsula\r\nnuclear issue and the implementation in Iran of the\r\nsafeguards agreement under the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\r\nChina’s consistent position is that the Korean\r\npeninsula should be nuclear-weapon free, that peace\r\nand stability there should be maintained, and the issue\r\nshould be resolved peacefully through dialogue.\r\nThanks to the joint efforts of China and other parties\r\nconcerned, six-party talks were held in Beijing from 27\r\nto 29 August this year, following the three-party talks\r\nin Beijing in April. That marks an important step\r\ntowards a peaceful solution. Important consensus was\r\nreached during the talks, and the parties agreed to\r\nresolve the nuclear issue through peaceful means and\r\ndialogue. They maintained that the Korean peninsula\r\nshould be nuclear-weapon free and that the security\r\nconcerns of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nshould be taken into consideration. The parties agreed\r\nin principle that an overall solution should be sought in\r\na simultaneous and incremental manner.\r\nIn the negotiating process, all actions or words\r\nthat might aggravate the situation should be avoided.\r\nDialogue should continue so as to enhance trust, reduce\r\ndifferences and broaden common ground. The parties\r\nagreed to further talks and agreed that the specific date\r\nand venue should be decided through diplomatic\r\nchannels as soon as possible. China believes that, as a\r\nresult of the six-party talks, the objective of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free Korean peninsula has been set. The\r\nprocess towards a peaceful resolution has begun and\r\nthe principle of simultaneous and incremental\r\nresolution has been extensively recognized. At present,\r\nall parties concerned should exercise restraint so as to\r\ncreate an atmosphere and conditions that are conducive\r\nto continued talks. While having one’s own concerns in\r\nmind, it is important to pay attention to and address the\r\nother parties’ legitimate concerns. China is now\r\nworking with all other parties for an early opening of\r\nthe next round of six-party talks. We hope that the\r\nparties concerned will demonstrate a spirit of\r\nconducting consultations as equals and of\r\nreconciliation for an early and peaceful settlement\r\nthrough dialogue, thus laying a good foundation for\r\nlasting peace and stability in North-East Asia.\r\nWith regard to the implementation of the NPT\r\nsafeguards agreement in Iran, China has stood all along\r\nfor the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and has\r\nheld that all non-nuclear-weapon States parties to the\r\nNPT must not develop or possess nuclear weapons, in\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nstrict observance of the Treaty. Meanwhile, States\r\nparties are entitled to the right of peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy under strict IAEA safeguards. We\r\nalways maintain that Iran should fully cooperate with\r\nthe Agency, make all its nuclear activities transparent\r\nto the Agency and sign an additional protocol at an\r\nearly date.\r\nWe are pleased to note that Iran has recently\r\ncooperated with the Agency more closely. It has\r\nsubmitted all documents concerning its nuclear\r\nactivities and has expressed willingness to sign and\r\nratify an additional protocol and to suspend uranium\r\nenrichment and reprocessing activities. China\r\nwelcomes and appreciates those positive measures. We\r\nhope to see Iran’s early fulfilment of its relevant\r\ncommitments. We appreciate the efforts made by the\r\nFrench, German and British foreign ministers and by\r\nother countries in seeking a solution to this issue. It is\r\nour hope that this will lead to a timely and appropriate\r\nresolution of this issue within the framework of the\r\nIAEA.\r\nMr. Tesch (Australia): I would first like to thank\r\nDirector General ElBaradei for his comprehensive\r\nstatement on the achievements of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and his preview of the\r\nchallenges the Agency will face over the coming year.\r\nWe would also like to register our appreciation for his\r\nfocused leadership throughout this challenging year for\r\nthe Agency. Australia is strongly committed to the\r\nthree pillars which form the basis of the Agency’s\r\nmandate: safety and security, science and technology,\r\nand safeguards and verification. Australia believes that\r\nthe global implementation of an effective system of\r\nstrengthened safeguards will deliver substantial\r\nsecurity benefits. In Australia’s view, the Agency’s\r\nverification and promotional activities are mutually\r\nreinforcing in nature. Strengthening the credibility of\r\nthe Agency’s verification system promotes confidence\r\nin nuclear science and technology.\r\nA priority for Australia is achieving the widest\r\npossible application of the IAEA’s additional protocol\r\non strengthened safeguards. The additional protocol\r\nrepresents the new verification standard for safeguards\r\nunder the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT). This means that the IAEA safeguards\r\nsystem should come quickly to be regarded as\r\ncomprising both classic safeguards and the additional\r\nprotocol. Australia urges States that have yet to sign\r\nand ratify an additional protocol to do so as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nAustralia was the first Member State to ratify an\r\nAdditional Protocol, and is pleased to be the first\r\ncountry in which integrated safeguards are being\r\napplied. Australia welcomes the application of\r\nintegrated safeguards in Norway and in Indonesia.\r\nThe safety and security of nuclear and radioactive\r\nmaterials must be a priority for all countries. Australia\r\nhas contributed to regional and international efforts to\r\nenhance the understanding of how a safety culture can\r\nbe implemented in nuclear organizations. A particular\r\nfocus for Australia is promoting improvements in the\r\ninternational safety regime for research reactors.\r\nAustralia continues as well to promote constructive\r\ndialogue between shipping and coastal States on the\r\nsafe transport of radioactive material. And Australia\r\nhas contributed to the review of the Convention on the\r\nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material.\r\nThe International Conference on the Safety of\r\nTransport of Radioactive Material saw very\r\nconstructive discussion of issues affecting transport.\r\nThe development of an action plan flowing from the\r\nConference will help build confidence further and\r\nensure the continuation of what has been an excellent\r\nsafety record in this field.\r\nAustralia welcomes the adoption of the Code of\r\nConduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive\r\nSources. The Code establishes the basis for countries to\r\ncommit themselves to international best practice in\r\nthese areas, integrating the traditional issues of safety\r\nwith the increased importance of security.\r\nIt is gratifying to see the very strong level of\r\nsupport for technical cooperation across the Agency’s\r\nmembership. Australia is pleased to contribute A$2\r\nmillion to the Technical Cooperation Fund for 2004. In\r\naddition, Australia continues to provide strong support\r\nto the Agency’s Regional Cooperative Agreement\r\n(RCA) for the Asia-Pacific region. Since 1979,\r\nAustralia’s overseas aid programme has provided more\r\nthan A$10 million in support of RCA project packages.\r\nAustralia is currently funding a new phase of the\r\nIAEA/RCA project on improving regional radiological\r\nsafety capabilities, which aims to improve regional\r\ncapacity to respond to radiological risks, including\r\naquatic environmental risks and radiological\r\nemergencies.\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nRecently, the international community has been\r\nfaced with significant and worrying challenges to the\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime. Like other countries,\r\nAustralia expressed deep concern at the announcement\r\nby the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea of its\r\nwithdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\r\nand its removal of its nuclear facilities from Agency\r\nsafeguards. We noted that continued pursuit by the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea of nuclear\r\nweapons in the face of concerted international\r\nopposition would serve only to isolate that country\r\nfurther from the international community and from the\r\neconomic and other benefits it so desperately needs.\r\nNuclear weapons will diminish, not enhance, the\r\nsecurity of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nAustralia strongly supports efforts to reach a\r\npeaceful, diplomatic solution to the North Korean\r\nissue. We welcome the process of multi-party dialogue\r\nthat began in Beijing in August this year and appreciate\r\nthe positive role played by China in helping bring that\r\ndialogue into being. In Australia’s view, such talks hold\r\nthe key to progress towards a peaceful resolution.\r\nSimilarly, we have been encouraged by recent\r\ndevelopments in respect of Iran’s nuclear activities,\r\narising from the agreement reached among the foreign\r\nministers of Iran, Britain, France and Germany late last\r\nmonth. Iran’s declared willingness to conclude a\r\nsafeguards-strengthening additional protocol with the\r\nIAEA and to suspend uranium enrichment and\r\nreprocessing activities are important and welcome. But\r\nmore important, and more welcome still, will be\r\ndetermined action on Iran’s part to fulfil its\r\nundertakings. It is in Iran’s own interests to heed the\r\nclear message from the international community and\r\ncooperate fully with the IAEA.\r\nAt this critical point in history, Member States\r\nmust maintain the momentum for the Agency’s work\r\non strengthened safeguards and other verification\r\nactivity. The Agency can count on Australia’s\r\ncontinuing strong support as it implements its programs\r\nand adapts to meet new challenges.\r\nMr. De Alba (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): May I\r\nreiterate Mexico’s appreciation for the work done by\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and\r\nin particular, by its Director General, Mr. Mohamed\r\nElBaradei, and the secretariat staff of the IAEA. The\r\nrelevance of this Agency and its contribution to\r\ninternational peace and stability have been seen once\r\nagain in recent situations in Iraq, North Korea and Iran.\r\nThe report that the Agency has submitted this\r\nyear appropriately reflects its achievements in\r\npromoting international cooperation for the peaceful\r\nuses of nuclear technologies, in improving the system\r\nof nuclear security and in making the verification\r\nsystem more effective. The pillars on which the\r\nAgency’s activities are based — in other words, the\r\noptimal use of nuclear technology with the highest\r\nlevels of security possible as well as the role of\r\nverifying non-proliferation commitments — correspond\r\nto the principles that Mexico upholds.\r\nIn that context, Mexico believes that, while it is\r\nimportant to continue a review of the criteria and the\r\nway in which verification activities should be\r\nconducted, there can be no doubt whatsoever regarding\r\nthe current credibility and the legitimacy of the\r\nAgency’s safeguards system. We reiterate our\r\nappreciation for the IAEA’s inspection work, in\r\nparticular, its joint work with the United Nations\r\nMonitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission\r\n(UNMOVIC) in Iraq. We especially hail the\r\nprofessionalism and sense of commitment that its\r\nDirector General and his team displayed at all times. In\r\nthat regard, Mexico supports Mr. ElBaradei’s proposal\r\nto complete the work of verification in Iraq.\r\nIn connection with the implementation of the plan\r\nof action against nuclear terrorism, submitted by the\r\nDirector General, Mexico reiterates its support for\r\nmeasures to improve the physical security of all\r\nnuclear materials. Mexico is participating actively in\r\nthe group of legal and technical experts convened by\r\nthe Director General to develop a draft amendment to\r\nthe Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear\r\nMaterials. In that context, we reaffirm our agreement\r\nwith what other delegations have said about reaching\r\nthe necessary consensus on outstanding issues before\r\nconvening a diplomatic conference to amend the\r\nConvention.\r\nSince the Agency’s establishment, Mexico has\r\nattached high priority to the technical cooperation\r\nprogramme. We believe that the three basic tools of the\r\nIAEA’s technical cooperation strategy — the central\r\ncriterion, the national programme structure and the\r\nthematic plans — are elements that have helped to\r\nimprove the process of designing cooperation projects.\r\nWe recognize the IAEA’s secretariat’s effort to meet\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\ndeveloping countries’ needs by flexibly applying the\r\ncentral criterion, and we encourage the Department of\r\nTechnical Cooperation to continue to use the criterion\r\nas a tool to support member States in improving the\r\ndesign of their technical cooperation projects on the\r\nbasis of national development priorities.\r\nMexico notes with satisfaction that the Technical\r\nCooperation Report for 2002 refers to a series of\r\nactivities — aimed at expanding the spheres of action\r\nof the so-called thematic plans in areas such as food\r\nirradiation, rainwater basin management and infectious\r\ndisease control — as ways to address problems that\r\naffect developing countries in a very particular way.\r\nWe reiterate the request that the secretariat continue to\r\nsupport member States in the process of identifying\r\nareas of sustainable development in which nuclear\r\ntechnologies are the best option, in order to ensure\r\nproper coherence among the current technical\r\ncooperation strategy’s three tools.\r\nWithin that framework, Mexico views with\r\ninterest the secretariat’s efforts to obtain additional\r\nfinancial resources for the technical cooperation\r\nprogramme. That is why Mexico congratulates the\r\nsecretariat on signing memorandums of understanding\r\nand on its joint activities with international\r\ncooperation, research and development organizations to\r\nbenefit developing countries. We encourage it to\r\ncontinue on that path.\r\nLast July, the IAEA Board of Governors adopted\r\na package proposed by the Co-Chairs of the Working\r\nGroup on the Agency’s programme and budget for the\r\nnext biennium. After arduous negotiations, a consensus\r\nwas achieved on a number of mechanisms to defer\r\nincreases in member countries’ contributions resulting\r\nfrom the draft budget submitted by the Director\r\nGeneral for the biennium 2004-2005. We believe that,\r\nto some extent, that will alleviate the increases\r\nproposed for developing countries. However, Mexico\r\nbelieves that we should conduct a careful analysis of\r\nthe operation and application of international\r\nsafeguards — particularly their financing — in order to\r\nachieve an appropriate cost level and a differentiated\r\ndistribution of related financial burdens.\r\nGiven the drastic increase in verification costs,\r\nfor Mexico it is not enough to postpone the entry into\r\nforce of the protection mechanism’s second phase for a\r\nfour-year period. In the light of the current conditions\r\nin the budget proposed for the biennium 2004-2005,\r\nMexico supports complete re-establishment of the\r\nprotection mechanism. It is important to bear in mind\r\nthat, if proposals are submitted in the near future for an\r\nincrease in that area, it will be essential once again to\r\nreview application of the mechanism.\r\nAlthough current international circumstances\r\nhave shown the fragility of the balance among the\r\nAgency’s statutory activities — giving greater weight\r\nto its verification activities — Mexico considers it\r\nnecessary to seek appropriate formulas to ensure that\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency’s three\r\npillars — security, verification and promotion of the\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy — have secure,\r\npredictable resources that can respond to the needs of\r\nmember States.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to indicate that\r\nMexico has consistently advocated that States parties\r\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) comply with their disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation obligations. I refer in particular to the\r\nactions agreed upon at the 2000 NPT Review\r\nConference, as regards both nuclear-weapon and non-\r\nnuclear-weapon States. The international community\r\nmust remain alert to ambiguous signals that foster\r\nnuclear proliferation, whether vertical or horizontal.\r\nMexico will continue to be vigilant so that, in the\r\nframework of the NPT review process at the 2005\r\nreview conference, initiatives aimed at disarmament\r\nand nuclear non-proliferation will be strengthened.\r\nMs. Corkery (United States of America): On\r\nbehalf of my Government, I should like to thank Mr.\r\nElBaradei for his presentation.\r\nThe task of managing nuclear materials safely\r\nand securely will be with the international community\r\nindefinitely. One of the essential tools on which we\r\nhave long relied to deal with that fundamental reality\r\nand to protect and promote our common interests is the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The\r\nIAEA has served us well in that task, and we shall\r\ncontinue to rely on it.\r\nIn the early years of the IAEA, it was common to\r\nhear references to the notion of balance between its\r\npromotional and verification functions. After the mid-\r\n1980s, it became common to hear more about the three\r\npillars of its work: safety, technical cooperation and\r\nverification. As the 2002 annual report documents, the\r\nIAEA’s work today has become even more complicated\r\nand diverse. Today, countries encounter IAEA\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\npersonnel pursuing programmes in areas as wide-\r\nranging as water management, cancer treatment, border\r\nsecurity, research reactor safety, nuclear material\r\naccountancy, animal health and many others. The\r\nbreadth and diversity of that work reflect both the\r\nmultifaceted character of nuclear technology and the\r\ngrowing dependence of States around the globe on the\r\nIAEA to help use and manage that technology.\r\nThe international community’s reliance on the\r\nIAEA was never more apparent than in 2002. Rarely\r\ndid a day go by that nuclear issues were not mentioned\r\nin the headlines of major newspapers worldwide. The\r\n2002 events generating those headlines demonstrated\r\nunambiguously the critical need to know how our\r\nworld is using nuclear materials and technology.\r\nRegrettably, a few States seemed determined to misuse\r\nnuclear materials, in violation of their nuclear non-\r\nproliferation commitments. Concerns about nuclear\r\nterrorism escalated. Support intensified for measures to\r\nverify how nuclear materials were being used. To deal\r\nwith those and other related issues, the world again\r\nturned to the (IAEA).\r\nSome of the most contentious issues of 2002\r\narose because a few countries opted to pursue nuclear\r\nactivities in violation of their nuclear non-proliferation\r\ncommitments, including those under the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). While\r\nonly a few among the more than 180 NPT parties were\r\nengaged in such activities, the implications of their\r\nsuccessful acquisition of nuclear weapons would be\r\nenormous in terms of regional and international peace\r\nand stability and of the viability of the NPT itself.\r\nBeginning in May 1994, the IAEA maintained a\r\ncontinuous presence in North Korea at its Yongbyon\r\nnuclear site to monitor the freeze under the Agreed\r\nFramework. It turned out that, for years, while the\r\nfreeze was supposedly in place, North Korea was\r\npursuing a clandestine uranium enrichment route to\r\nnuclear weapons, an activity it acknowledged last\r\nOctober. North Korea then rapidly escalated its\r\nbrinkmanship, which culminated in the expulsion of\r\nIAEA inspectors at the end of 2002. Since then, North\r\nKorea has announced its withdrawal from the NPT and\r\nhas failed to respond to calls by the international\r\ncommunity to abandon its nuclear weapons\r\nprogrammes. The Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea’s contravention of the NPT and its other nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation commitments has led to one of the\r\nmost serious threats to international security that we\r\nface today.\r\nFor 12 years, Saddam Hussein defied the\r\nresolutions of the Security Council. Today, the threat of\r\na nuclear-armed Iraq has been removed, and efforts to\r\npromote peace in that region can move forward, free\r\nfrom the need to address that threat. The IAEA’s\r\ndiverse role over the years in dealing with the Iraqi\r\nnuclear issue has been commendable.\r\nIran’s nuclear weapons ambitions became far\r\nmore visible in 2002. As evidence mounted confirming\r\nIran’s illicit nuclear-related procurement and numerous\r\nnuclear-related activities, which Iran failed to declare\r\nto the IAEA as required by its Safeguards Agreement,\r\nthe world has become increasingly alarmed. Recent\r\ndevelopments give some grounds for hope that Iran\r\nwill be responsive to the concerns of the international\r\ncommunity. We are hopeful but remain sceptical. There\r\nis a long way to go before this hope can be transformed\r\ninto reality. Iran must completely and verifiably\r\nabandon its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons.\r\nAs regrettable as the actions of North Korea, Iraq\r\nand Iran are, we should not overlook the important\r\nlessons we have learned in dealing with their actions\r\nthat have violated the NPT. The world community must\r\nconfront promptly and firmly any activities that raise\r\nquestions about an NPT party’s obligation not to\r\nmanufacture or acquire nuclear weapons. Cheating\r\ncannot be tolerated and must be addressed without\r\ndelay and with conviction. There must be real\r\nconsequences. Any State tempted to violate its nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation commitments needs to know it will\r\nbe quickly detected and firmly confronted. Failure to\r\ndo so affects us all.\r\nIn response to the tragic events of 11 September\r\n2001, the IAEA moved quickly to establish an\r\nexpanded programme for nuclear material security.\r\nThat programme was approved by the IAEA Board of\r\nGovernors in March 2002, and work under the nuclear\r\nsecurity Action Plan is ongoing. The Plan is subdivided\r\ninto eight programme areas, providing a\r\ncomprehensive approach to material security.\r\nMy Government is pleased to support this\r\nimportant work with both funding and expert services,\r\nand we urge all IAEA member States to contribute\r\ngenerously in whatever way they can. The fact that\r\nboth developing and developed States have requested\r\nthe IAEA’s assistance in nuclear security reflects broad\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\ninternational recognition that this work is both essential\r\nand urgent.\r\nPermit me to highlight in particular the IAEA’s\r\nwork in improving the security and safety of radiation\r\nsources worldwide. The widespread use of such\r\nsources and the prospect that terrorists could seek to\r\nuse some of them to make so-called dirty bombs\r\nunderscores the need to enhance their security in all its\r\naspects, including transport, use, storage and\r\ndisposition.\r\nIn 1997, the IAEA Board of Governors approved\r\na new model Additional Protocol to expand safeguards\r\nactivities and to give the IAEA important new tools for\r\ndetecting undeclared or secret nuclear activities. This\r\nProtocol is the culmination of several years of\r\nintensive efforts to devise ways to strengthen the\r\ninternational safeguards system and make it even more\r\neffective as a tool for enhancing confidence in the\r\nIAEA’s ability to detect diversion and other violations\r\nof the NPT.\r\nEvery State that concludes its own additional\r\nprotocol based on the model agreement makes a\r\ncontribution to international security. I am very pleased\r\nto recall that on 9 May 2002 President Bush\r\ntransmitted the proposed United States Additional\r\nProtocol to our Senate for its advice and consent to\r\nratification. We are working hard to complete all the\r\nsteps necessary for Senate consideration of the\r\nproposed Protocol, and we urge all States that have not\r\nyet done so to conclude and implement an additional\r\nprotocol. We also urge those States that have not\r\ncompleted a safeguards agreement to do so as soon as\r\npossible. Effective safeguards offer a critical means to\r\npromote nuclear transparency and provide essential\r\nassurances that States are using nuclear material solely\r\nfor peaceful purposes.\r\nIncluded in the extensive media coverage of\r\nnuclear issues in 2002 were repeated references to the\r\nIAEA. Behind the headlines are men and women in the\r\nIAEA secretariat who are dealing directly with some of\r\nthe most sensitive nuclear proliferation issues of our\r\ntime. We are indeed grateful for their commitment and\r\nprofessionalism in confronting those difficult issues.\r\nI would be remiss not to highlight the dedicated\r\nwork within the IAEA secretariat of the men and\r\nwomen who each day help make available to IAEA\r\nmember States, in a safe and efficient manner, the\r\nbeneficial applications of nuclear technology. It is less\r\ncommon to see major headlines about improved\r\ngroundwater supplies in South America or Asia, or use\r\nof radiotherapy to treat cancer in Africa. Yet on a daily\r\nbasis IAEA staff are working in those areas and many\r\nothers to make our world a better and safer place.\r\nWhatever and wherever the nuclear challenge\r\nconfronting the IAEA is, the organization can be only\r\nas effective as its member States want it to be. As the\r\n2002 IAEA annual report demonstrates, the world\r\ncommunity is well served by this organization. Those\r\nof us who are members of the IAEA will continue to\r\nsupport its important work.\r\nMr. Sriwidjaja (Indonesia): My delegation has\r\nlistened with great enthusiasm and taken due note of\r\nthe comprehensive statement made by the Director-\r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA), highlighting the work and the development of\r\nthe IAEA during the period 2002-2003. The Indonesian\r\ndelegation would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress its continued appreciation to the Director-\r\nGeneral and the secretariat of the IAEA for their\r\nsignificant and valuable work in fulfilling the\r\nrequirements of the IAEA’s three-pillar mandate, in the\r\nareas of technology, safety and verification. Indonesia\r\npledges its full support and is firmly convinced that the\r\nIAEA, as an agency of the United Nations system,\r\nmust continue to play its central and universal role in\r\naddressing the enormous challenges ahead.\r\nIn the light of the technical cooperation report for\r\n2002, as well as the Agency’s underlying mission to\r\npromote the Atoms for Peace concept and its\r\ncommitment to expand the contribution of nuclear\r\ntechnologies to enhancing peace and development, our\r\ndelegation appreciates the efforts made not only with\r\nrespect to the Technical Cooperation Fund, but also to\r\nareas such as the nuclear sciences and applications\r\nprogramme. In this regard, the Agency commits around\r\n50 to 60 per cent of its resources, directly and\r\nindirectly, to technical cooperation. We note with\r\nsatisfaction that 87 country programme frameworks,\r\nutilized as planning tools to design technical\r\ncooperation projects within the context of national\r\npriorities, are now in place.\r\nMy delegation wishes to express its satisfaction at\r\nthe Agency’s efforts to expand and intensify the\r\napplication of nuclear science and technology, with a\r\nview to promoting the quality of life of peoples, in\r\nparticular those of the developing countries. We\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nwelcome the technical cooperation programmes, which\r\nhave provided significant assistance to member\r\ncountries in the development of human resources and\r\ntechnical facilities, with the goal of fostering capacities\r\nin various important areas.\r\nIt is also essential to reiterate the importance of\r\ninternational cooperation in the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy, which is one of the fundamental pillars\r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT). The validity of article VI of the NPT\r\nand the inalienable right of all States parties to the\r\nunimpeded and non-discriminatory transfer of nuclear\r\ntechnology and materials to the developing countries\r\nare indispensable elements in meeting the requirements\r\nof national development. This is in line with the role of\r\nthe Agency in assisting States parties to formulate\r\ninternational cooperative projects within the framework\r\nof the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, through the\r\ndevelopment of effective programmes aimed at\r\nimproving their scientific, technological and regulatory\r\ncapabilities, based on each country’s priority needs and\r\ndecisions.\r\nIndonesia notes the progress made in the field of\r\nnuclear verification. Based on the IAEA 2002\r\nSafeguards Implementation Report, 145 States now\r\nhave safeguards agreements in force, and the nuclear\r\nmaterial and other items placed under safeguards\r\nremained in peaceful nuclear activities or are otherwise\r\nadequately accounted for.\r\nIndonesia also notes the progress made by the\r\nAgency in approving the Additional Protocol, which\r\nwill involve approximately 80 member States.\r\nHowever, Indonesia is concerned by the fact that only\r\n35 States have brought the additional protocols into\r\nforce and that 46 States parties to the NPT still do not\r\nhave the required safeguards agreements with the\r\nAgency.\r\nTherefore, in line with GC(47)/RES/11, on\r\nstrengthening the effectiveness and improving the\r\nefficiency of the safeguards system and application of\r\nthe model Additional Protocol, Indonesia calls upon all\r\nStates to conclude and bring into force their respective\r\nlegal instruments in order to enable the Agency to give\r\ncredible and comprehensive assurances regarding all\r\nStates that have made non-proliferation commitments,\r\nincluding conclusions on the absence of undeclared\r\nnuclear material and activities.\r\nTo that end, Indonesia has enforced both the\r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreement and the\r\nAdditional Protocol, and it now is in the process of\r\nimplementing the framework for integrated safeguards.\r\nWe strongly believe that those measures will strengthen\r\nthe effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the\r\nsafeguards system and the application of the model\r\nAdditional Protocol, as well as the verification system\r\nof the Agency.\r\nIn the field of nuclear security and safety,\r\nIndonesia commends the Agency’s effort to assist\r\nmember States in increasing their nuclear security, and\r\nthe high priority placed by the Agency on the\r\nelaboration of measures to prevent the theft of nuclear\r\nmaterial and the sabotage of nuclear facilities. The\r\nAgency’s shared concern over the risk of radiological\r\nterrorism has led to greater emphasis on improving the\r\nsecurity of other radioactive material, in order to\r\ncounter illicit trafficking.\r\nIndonesia stresses the importance of the\r\ncontinuation of the activities proposed by the Director-\r\nGeneral in his report to the Board of Governors entitled\r\n“Protection Against Nuclear Terrorism: Specific\r\nProposals” (GOV/2002/10). In that connection,\r\nIndonesia reiterates its shared view that nuclear\r\nsecurity must be one of the world’s priorities and\r\naccordingly calls upon all concerned parties to do their\r\nutmost to support efforts to strengthen international\r\ncooperation in nuclear, radiation, transport and waste\r\nsafety, as highlighted in the resolutions adopted at the\r\nforty-seventh session of the General Conference —\r\nGC(47)/RES/7A and GC(47)/RES/8, on nuclear and\r\nradiological security and progress on measures to\r\nprotect against nuclear and radiological terrorism.\r\nGiven the geographic conditions of its territory,\r\nIndonesia requested the Agency and its member States\r\nto assist it in enhancing its capacity to develop\r\nmeasures against nuclear terror, emergency actions and\r\nrecovery measures in case of nuclear terror. In that\r\nlight, and in anticipation of some uncertainties with\r\nrespect to nuclear security, Indonesia also shares some\r\nconcerns of coastal States on nuclear transport\r\nsafety — namely the increasing danger of accidents\r\ncaused by nature or human error, or of criminal or\r\nterrorist acts.\r\nIndonesia commends the Agency for having\r\nconvened the International Conference on the Safety of\r\nTransport of Radioactive Material, which was held in\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nVienna from 7 to 11 July 2003, and it welcomes the\r\nconstructive discussions at the Conference as well as\r\nthe President’s summary and findings. In line with\r\nGC(47)/RES/7C, Indonesia supports the requests that\r\nthe Agency develop an action plan, in consultation with\r\nmember States, on the safe transport of radioactive\r\nmaterial.\r\nMr. Mahtab (India): The Indian delegation has\r\ntaken note of the report of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), presented by the Agency’s\r\nDirector General, Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei.\r\nAccording to the World Bank’s World\r\nDevelopment Report 2003, the population of the world\r\ncrossed the 6-billion mark in the year 1999. Most\r\ncurrent estimates suggest that approximately 2 billion\r\nmore people will be added over the next 30 years, with\r\nanother 1 billion in the following 20 years. Virtually all\r\nthe increase will be in the developing countries, with\r\nthe bulk in urban areas. The core challenge for\r\ndevelopment is thus to ensure the availability of\r\nproductive work opportunities and access to basic\r\namenities for those people.\r\nAt present, however, there are wide disparities.\r\nThe average income in the richest 20 countries is now\r\n37 times that in the poorest 20 countries, and that ratio\r\nhas doubled in the past 40 years. Putting energy within\r\nthe reach of everyone could significantly correct the\r\nsituation. Energy is the engine for empowerment and\r\ngrowth. It multiplies work done through human labour\r\nand increases productivity. The availability of energy\r\nthus leads to an enhanced livelihood and access to\r\nbetter amenities. With sustainability issues staring at\r\nus, achieving that is possible only if the energy supply\r\nbecomes abundant and is within the reach of all. Only\r\nthe power of the atom can make it happen.\r\nAs we commemorate the Atoms for Peace\r\ninitiative launched 50 years ago and take stock of the\r\nachievements — which are indeed very impressive\r\nboth in terms of the share of nuclear electricity in total\r\nelectricity production and in terms of other, non-\r\nelectricity applications — we see that the barriers to\r\nthe growth of this important technology for the benefit\r\nof the larger part of humanity are yet to be addressed.\r\nThat were better done before it is too late as, otherwise,\r\nthe threat to the global climate, as well as the tensions\r\nof inequality, could assume unmanageable dimensions.\r\nClear signals of those threats are already visible.\r\nCombating the dangers of the malevolent use of\r\nnuclear and radioactive material by unscrupulous or\r\nterrorist elements has emerged as a new challenge. We\r\nare glad to see that this issue is receiving due attention\r\nfrom the Agency. In collaboration with the IAEA, we\r\nrecently conducted an international training course on\r\nsecurity for nuclear installations. The course was well\r\nreceived, and the feedback has been encouraging. It has\r\nbeen suggested that the course could serve as a model\r\nfor courses to be conducted on a regular basis. We\r\nwelcome the Group of Eight statement on the safety\r\nand security of radioactive sources. India has\r\nparticipated actively in discussions on developing the\r\nIAEA Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of\r\nRadioactive Sources. India has in place appropriate\r\nlegislative and regulatory infrastructure to achieve the\r\nobjectives of the Code of Conduct.\r\nIndia’s atomic energy programme, which is in its\r\nfiftieth year, has come a long way on its march to serve\r\nour people. Today, we are on fast-track growth, backed\r\nup by a strong research and development programme\r\nand industrial and safety infrastructure. Approximately\r\nfour years from now, we will reach an installed\r\ngenerating capacity of approximately 4,500 megawatts\r\nof electricity from pressurized heavy water reactors –\r\nthe mainstay of the first stage of our indigenous\r\nnuclear power programme – and another 2,320\r\nmegawatts from light water reactors, making a total of\r\napproximately 6,800 megawatts, compared to the\r\npresent capacity of 2,720 megawatts. The Government\r\nof India has approved the construction of a 500-\r\nmegawatt prototype fast breeder reactor. This\r\nindigenously-developed technology can enhance the\r\ninstalled power generation capacity to well over\r\n300,000 megawatts, even with our modest uranium\r\nresources.\r\nNuclear electricity generation of 19.358 billion\r\nunits was realized during the year 2002-2003, with the\r\nNuclear Power Corporation of India, Limited (NPCIL),\r\nachieving an annual overall capacity factor of 90 per\r\ncent, which is among the highest in the world. The\r\nKakrapar Atomic Power Station-1 was judged to be the\r\nbest performing unit in the pressurized heavy water\r\nreactor (PHWR) category during the rolling 12-month\r\nperiod from 1 October 2001 to 1 September 2002. For\r\nthe 2002 calendar year, the three NPCIL PHWR units\r\nwere judged to be among the five best PHWR units in\r\nthe world. As well, all operating nuclear power stations\r\nare now ISO-14001-certified.\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nThe growth of nuclear energy in the developing\r\ncountries, particularly in fast growing economies with\r\nlarge populations, should be a matter of global interest\r\nin the light of its potential to protect the Earth from\r\nirreversible climate changes. Wherever there are no\r\ngenuine concerns, barriers to the deployment of nuclear\r\nenergy technologies need to be examined and brought\r\ndown through a pragmatic approach. We must move\r\ntowards a more peaceful and prosperous world on the\r\nbasis of placing abundant energy within the reach of\r\nall. Mindless controls that do not address the core issue\r\nof meeting the development aspirations of the needy do\r\nnot help the situation. Rather, they make matters worse.\r\nThe IAEA International Project on Innovative\r\nNuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INOPRO) for the\r\ndevelopment of the next generation of nuclear reactor\r\nand fuel cycle technologies is important in this context.\r\nIt has the potential of providing a technological\r\nsolution to address the barriers to the deployment of\r\nnuclear power worldwide. Development of the\r\nadvanced heavy water reactor in India, which would\r\nmore than meet the INPRO objectives in terms of\r\nsustainability, economy, safety and proliferation\r\nresistance, is progressing according to plan. In\r\naddition, this reactor system would enable us to get\r\nstarted with large-scale energy production using\r\nthorium.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nWe are conscious of our responsibilities arising\r\nfrom the possession of advanced technologies in the\r\nnuclear field. We have a commitment to and an interest\r\nin contributing as a partner against proliferation. Even\r\nas we move forward towards developing and using\r\nproliferation-resistant nuclear technologies, we must\r\nshed the baggage inherited from the past, which still\r\nrestricts the flow of equipment and technologies related\r\nto the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nFrom the perspective of a large and growing\r\neconomy like India, with its small hydrocarbon\r\nreserves and with coal reserves that are being depleted,\r\nthe development of nuclear energy based on a closed-\r\ncycle approach enabling us to make fuller use of\r\nuranium and thorium is the only way to meet the\r\ndevelopment aspirations of more than a billion people.\r\nWe are, therefore, pursuing a comprehensive research\r\nand development programme to explore newer\r\ntechnologies to widen the scope of nuclear energy use.\r\nThe technical cooperation programme of the\r\nAgency has been playing a valuable role in\r\ndevelopment activities using nuclear techniques. We\r\nhave a comprehensive domestic programme on\r\napplications in agriculture, health, water resources and\r\nindustry. We have been and will continue to be active\r\nin sharing our experience with other countries. We will\r\ncontinue our strong support to IAEA activities. We\r\nhave been consistently pledging and paying our\r\ncontribution to the Technical Cooperation Fund in full.\r\nWe are doing so this year too.\r\nThe Agency’s programme on managing and\r\npreserving knowledge is timely, and is relevant to the\r\nnuclear industry. In India, we are in a fortunate position\r\nwith respect to our very capable human resources,\r\navailable in large numbers. It may also be worthwhile\r\nat this stage to mention that Indian scientists have\r\nmade perhaps the largest contribution to scientific\r\npublications on pressurized heavy water reactors.\r\nLooking at the present scenario in which nuclear\r\ntechnology finds itself, we need a proactive two-\r\npronged strategy which safeguards the development\r\naspirations that can inevitably be met by nuclear\r\ntechnology and at the same time prevents the\r\nmalevolent use of that technology. This is an important\r\nchallenge, as ignoring either dimension could lead to\r\ndisastrous consequences. With science- and\r\ntechnology-based collective wisdom at its command,\r\nwe feel that the United Nations in general, and the\r\nIAEA in particular, are in a unique position to find new\r\npaths that could significantly contribute to world peace\r\nand prosperity. We all need to work together in this\r\nimportant task. We owe it to humanity and to future\r\ngenerations.\r\nMr. Osman (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nassociate myself with preceding speakers in thanking\r\nMr. ElBaradei, Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his excellent\r\npresentation of the Agency’s comprehensive report. My\r\ndelegation expresses its appreciation for the Director\r\nGeneral’s tireless efforts to improve the Agency’s\r\nefficiency, enhance its effectiveness and expand the\r\nsphere of activities and programmes in the service of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) and the signing and ratification of\r\nadditional protocols are among the most important\r\nsubjects on the agenda of the Agency. But here, the\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nsituation in the Middle East requires a comprehensive\r\napproach and careful attention, because the only\r\nnuclear entity in the region, Israel, persists in its refusal\r\nto sign the Treaty or an additional protocol — on the\r\nbasis of a series of unacceptable pretexts and\r\njustifications.\r\nWe particularly appreciate the technical\r\ninformation and other assistance given to developing\r\ncountries. The growing number of developing\r\ncountries, and their urgent need for the programmes of\r\nthe Agency require an increase in the budget of the\r\ntechnical assistance programme, so that it can be made\r\na permanent element of the main budget instead of\r\ndepending on contributions from donors. However, this\r\nshould not prevent donor countries from making\r\nfurther contributions to the Technical Cooperation\r\nFund. It is also our hope that the Agency will receive\r\ngreater contributions from regional and international\r\nfunds in order to support its projects, activities and\r\nprogrammes for developing countries.\r\nThe technical cooperation programme remains the\r\nproper instrument to help developing countries improve\r\ntheir national capacities in the areas of medicine,\r\nhealth, water, environmental safety and nuclear and\r\nradiological safety, especially now that major regional\r\nefforts are being made throughout Africa to eradicate\r\nthe tsetse fly and sleeping disease, and to control\r\ninsects that transmit malaria. We hope that progress\r\nwill be made towards eradication of the malaria-\r\ntransmitting mosquito because of the negative impact\r\nof that disease on the economic and social development\r\nof developing countries in general, and African\r\ncountries in particular.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish the Agency and its\r\nDirector General, Mr. ElBaradei, and his team all the\r\nbest in their efforts to work towards a better world free\r\nof weapons of mass destruction.\r\nMr. Loedel (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nStates members of the Common Market of the South\r\n(MERCOSUR) — Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and\r\nUruguay — on whose behalf I have the honour to\r\nspeak today, welcome the report introduced by the\r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA), Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei.\r\nUnfortunately, today’s world is characterized by\r\nserious challenges to the nuclear non-proliferation\r\nregime. In the sphere of the IAEA we consider it\r\nnecessary to continue to develop consensus among the\r\nlargest possible number of countries in order to\r\ndevelop an atmosphere of confidence and legitimacy in\r\ndecision-making. It is a priority to preserve and\r\nconsolidate multilaterally negotiated international\r\nnorms.\r\nWe reiterate our active and ongoing commitment\r\nto the objectives of the international community in\r\nfavour of non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament and\r\nthe promotion of the peaceful uses of atomic energy,\r\npreserving the right of all States to engage in research,\r\nproduction and use of nuclear energy for peaceful\r\npurposes.\r\nIn that regard, we attach great importance to the\r\nIAEA technical cooperation programme, and we\r\nsupport actions to ensure an exchange of materials,\r\nequipment and technology for the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy.\r\nMERCOSUR and its associated States also\r\nunderscore their commitment to enhancing the\r\neffectiveness of safeguards, since these have a clear\r\nrole in achieving transparency and mutual confidence\r\namong countries. To that end, efforts to introduce\r\ngreater efficiency and savings must be redoubled\r\nwithout reducing effectiveness. Here, we recommend a\r\ndeepening of cooperation between the IAEA and other\r\nverification entities, such as the Brazilian-Argentine\r\nAgency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear\r\nMaterials.\r\nFurthermore, we cannot fail to mention our\r\nposition in favour of zero-growth programmes and\r\nbudgets; however, this year — given the need to\r\nachieve a balanced compromise beneficial to all in\r\norder to meet the statutory obligations of the Agency,\r\nand in an international context of challenges and\r\nresponsibilities — the members and associated\r\ncountries of MERCOSUR which are members of the\r\nBoard of Governors agreed to the draft programme and\r\nbudget for the next biennium. That decision was taken\r\non the basis that it would be considered an exceptional\r\nmeasure, given the current economic and financial\r\nconstraints confronting our subregion.\r\nOn a different subject, we wish to reiterate our\r\nappreciation for IAEA efforts to preserve a security\r\nsystem that protects the environment and people from\r\nharm caused by radiation. It is for that reason that we\r\nbelieve there should be due balance in considering the\r\nquestion of security in the transport of radioactive\r\nmaterial. We believe the IAEA can play a crucial role\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nas the facilitator of a dialogue among the countries\r\nidentified in the important conclusions presented by the\r\nPresident of the International Conference on the Safety\r\nof Transport of Radioactive Material, held last July.\r\nIn the same spirit, another important event was\r\nthe International Conference on Security of\r\nRadioactive Sources held in March this year; its plan of\r\naction constitutes a fundamental contribution to the\r\ndevelopment and coordination of international efforts\r\nin this area.\r\nFinally, we reiterate our resolute support for the\r\nactivities undertaken by IAEA for the protection of\r\nnuclear materials in order to prevent their falling into\r\nthe hands of non-State actors.\r\nThe President: We shall now consider draft\r\nresolution A/58/L.10. I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea, who wishes to speak in explanation of vote\r\nbefore the voting. May I remind delegations that\r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and\r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Kim Chang Guk (Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea): The delegation of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea would like to clarify its\r\nposition on draft resolution A/58/L.10, entitled “Report\r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency”.\r\nFirst, it is totally irrelevant for the draft\r\nresolution on the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA) report to include a reference to the IAEA\r\nresolution on the implementation of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\r\nsafeguards agreement between the Agency and the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea — a resolution\r\nwhich we flatly rejected earlier — even though my\r\ncountry is not a State party to NPT. My Government\r\nwithdrew from the NPT in order to defend its supreme\r\ninterests while labouring under the abnormal situation\r\ncreated by the United States nuclear threat and IAEA\r\npartiality. The withdrawal of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea from the NPT was a legitimate\r\nexercise of its sovereign right under the relevant\r\nprovisions of that Treaty. In that regard, my delegation\r\nwishes to remind the sponsors of the draft resolution\r\nthat the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is no\r\nlonger a State party to NPT.\r\nSecondly, the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea does not recognize the annual report submitted\r\nby the IAEA to the General Assembly. The annual\r\nreport states that my country was in non-compliance\r\nwith its existing safeguards agreement pursuant to the\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty and that it had admitted to\r\nhaving a uranium enrichment programme inconsistent\r\nwith international agreements. That is contrary to the\r\nfacts. My country implemented its obligations under\r\nNPT and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea-\r\nUnited States Agreed Framework in good faith up until\r\nthe time we declared our decision to withdraw from the\r\nTreaty.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has\r\nnever admitted that it has a uranium enrichment\r\nprogramme. The argument that my country has\r\nadmitted to having a uranium enrichment programme is\r\npart of a foolish scheme to mislead public opinion and\r\nto shift the responsibility for the destruction of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea-United States\r\nAgreed Framework onto my country. Nevertheless,\r\nwith no rhyme or reason, the IAEA claims that my\r\nGovernment is in violation of international agreements.\r\nThis clearly proves that IAEA is a tool of the United\r\nStates.\r\nThirdly, the position of my country on the nuclear\r\nsituation between the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea and the United States is fair and principled. The\r\nnuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is the product of\r\nthe hostile policy of the United States towards my\r\ncountry. It is not a case that the Agency can resolve\r\nthrough interference and pressure so long as the United\r\nStates continues its hostile policy towards the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. It is dastardly\r\nfor the IAEA to connive in the United States hostile\r\npolicy and nuclear threats against the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea; it does so because the\r\nUnited States is a super-Power while it puts pressure\r\non the victim because it is a small country.\r\nAnd here I am compelled to make an aside in\r\norder to express my regret at having to do what the\r\nrepresentative of Japan did yesterday when he referred\r\nto my country by an incorrect name, with sinister,\r\nulterior political motives and demonstrates disdain for\r\nmy country. I ask for the understanding of Member\r\nStates.\r\nFourthly, certain countries that are eager to put\r\npressure on the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea, in particular the Japanese, are not in a position\r\nto contribute positively to the process of the settlement\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nof the nuclear issue because they are misusing it for\r\ntheir own political and military purposes. The Japs are\r\nnow shifting their whole society towards the right,\r\ntrying to resurrect militarism and fascism with a view\r\nto reinvading Korea. How can we slacken — even for a\r\nmoment — our preparedness against the Japanese when\r\nthe Government and parliament of the Japs are talking\r\nabout imposing sanctions on the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea and the Defence Minister and other\r\nhigh-ranking officials of the Japs are clamouring for a\r\npre-emptive strike against the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea, just as the United States is doing?\r\nFor all those reasons, the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea will vote against draft resolution\r\nA/58/L.10, as it will not help settle the issue.\r\nThe President: We have heard the only speaker\r\nin explanation of vote before the voting.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/58/L.10. Before doing so, I would like to\r\nannounce that since the introduction of the draft\r\nresolution, the following countries have become\r\nsponsors of A/58/L.10: Papua New Guinea, Sudan,\r\nNicaragua, Panama, Liechtenstein.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAlbania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Argentina,\r\nArmenia, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Bahrain,\r\nBelarus, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bolivia, Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam,\r\nBulgaria, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Cape\r\nVerde, Central African Republic, Chile, China,\r\nColombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech\r\nRepublic, Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nDenmark, Dominican Republic, Egypt, El\r\nSalvador, Eritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland,\r\nFrance, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Greece,\r\nGuatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland,\r\nIndia, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of),\r\nIreland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan,\r\nKuwait, Lao People’s Democratic Republic,\r\nLatvia, Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,\r\nLiechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia,\r\nMaldives, Mali, Malta, Mexico, Monaco,\r\nMongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar,\r\nNepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua,\r\nNigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Papua\r\nNew Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland,\r\nPortugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Russian\r\nFederation, San Marino, Senegal, Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore,\r\nSlovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan,\r\nSuriname, Sweden, Switzerland, Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic, Tajikistan, Thailand, the former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Togo, Tonga,\r\nTunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates,\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern\r\nIreland, United Republic of Tanzania, United\r\nStates of America, Uruguay, Venezuela, Viet\r\nNam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst:\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted by 129 votes to\r\n1 (resolution 58/8).\r\n[Subsequently the delegation of Romania\r\ninformed the Secretariat that it had intended to\r\nvote in favour.]\r\nThe President: A representative has asked to\r\nspeak in right of reply.\r\nMay I remind Members that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, statements in\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and to 5 minutes for the\r\nsecond and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Motomura (Japan): My delegation would\r\nlike to take this opportunity to exercise its right of\r\nreply to the points raised by the delegate from the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. First, quite a\r\nnumber of points have been raised by the North Korean\r\ndelegate concerning their objections to this draft\r\nresolution that are not particularly relevant to its\r\ncontents.\r\nSecondly, the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea used the term “Japs”. This is derogatory and we\r\nwould like to ask the North Korean delegate to retract\r\nthis derogatory comment. We use the term “North\r\nKorea”. Sometimes we use the term “South Korea”. It\r\nis a geographical concept and we have no intention of\r\nusing a derogatory term in this particular sense. But\r\nactually, the term “Jap”, in the English sense of the\r\nword, is regarded as derogatory and I would therefore\r\nlike to ask the delegate from the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea to refrain from using this word.\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nThirdly, in democratic societies, a variety of\r\npoints are raised in legislative bodies, and Japan is no\r\nexception. Sometimes when there is talk of the threat\r\nfrom North Korea, especially in terms of their nuclear\r\ndevelopment programmes, as a democratic State we\r\nmay raise all sorts of points since all sorts of arguments\r\nare possible. We have no animosity towards the North\r\nKorean State. As has been mentioned in the Pyongyang\r\nDeclaration, signed by Japan and North Korea, we are\r\nprepared to discuss a wide range of issues, including\r\nnuclear issues, to enable the forthcoming six-party\r\ntalks on nuclear issues concerning the North to be\r\nresolved within the framework of these talks.\r\nThe President: I would like to state and to make\r\nit very clear that there have been instances since I have\r\nassumed the presidency when I have been very alarmed\r\nat the level of the debate in terms of name-calling. The\r\npresidency wishes to associate himself with any\r\ncomments which seek to avoid a situation where we go\r\nbeyond a certain level. In this respect, I would wish\r\nthat on the issue of the matter dealing with references\r\nto the Japanese as “Japs” that the representative of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea would take this\r\ninto account and I hope he would, in future, desist from\r\nusing this kind of language in this honourable House.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item\r\n14?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 26\r\nThe situation in Central America: progress in\r\nfashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy\r\nand development\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/58/262,\r\nA/58/267 and A/58/270)\r\nMr. Stagno Ugarte (Costa Rica) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): It is an honour for me to speak on behalf of\r\nthe countries of the Central American Integration\r\nSystem: Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,\r\nNicaragua, Panama, Dominican Republic and my own\r\ncountry Costa Rica.\r\nPlease allow me first to congratulate you on your\r\nelection as President of the fifty-eighth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and above all for the effort and\r\ndedication with which you have met this challenge.\r\nOn this occasion, I also wish to express our\r\ngratitude to the Secretariat for all of the assistance\r\ngiven to the countries of the Central American isthmus\r\nand the Dominican Republic since 1983, the year when\r\nthe General Assembly examined for the first time the\r\nsituation of the region. We also want to thank all of the\r\nsponsors. All, to one extent or another, have been\r\nsteadfastly committed to the development of our region\r\nsince the implementation of the working framework of\r\nthe cooperation agreement, which lead to concrete\r\naction in the area of regional integration and in such\r\nsectors of health, education and environmental\r\nprotection.\r\nI want to take this opportunity to express warm\r\ncongratulations to Panama upon the celebration of the\r\n100th anniversary of its independence. The\r\nconsolidation of peace and democracy in Central\r\nAmerica has been the result of a long and arduous\r\npolitical process which has succeeded in overcoming\r\nmany obstacles, thanks to the shared efforts of the\r\npeoples and Governments of the region and which\r\ncontinues to make progress towards sustainable\r\neconomic growth with the united support of the\r\ninternational community. At present, all countries of\r\nthe region have freely-elected democratic\r\nGovernments.\r\nOn 16 March 2003, municipal and legislative\r\nelections were held in El Salvador, and the electoral\r\nprocess was peacefully conducted without any major\r\nincidents, thus demonstrating the country’s progress\r\ntowards full democratization and its firm commitment\r\nto complete the National Registry of Natural Persons\r\nand create a unique identity document for the 2004\r\nelections. As well, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal will\r\nbe able to organize the vote using place of residence\r\ncriteria.\r\nIn Guatemala, presidential elections will be held\r\non 9 November. They will be the most closely observed\r\nelections in the political history of that country. In the\r\nlight of the coming event, on 10 July representatives of\r\nthe political parties signed an ethical and political\r\nagreement on the electoral process and a declaration of\r\ncommitment to the peace agreements. In order to\r\nensure a clean, transparent process, electoral observer\r\nmissions of the Organization of American States and\r\nthe European Union have joined efforts with the\r\nElectoral Observer 2003, a coalition of three local\r\ninstitutions, in order to deploy independent observers\r\nthroughout the country.\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nIn our region, special attention needs to be given\r\nto the serious problem of low voter turnout in elections\r\nand citizens’ apathy born of mistrust as a result of a\r\nlack of transparency and the need for electoral and\r\njudicial reform and greater participation of civil society\r\nin decision-making.\r\nIn our region, there are several serious problems\r\nwith respect to human rights and citizen security.\r\nHowever, we must point out that each country’s\r\nproblems are different. There is a clear need for real\r\ncommitment on the part of local authorities to fund the\r\nmain national institutions for the defence of human\r\nrights, tackling the issue of crime and creating or\r\nstrengthening civil police forces.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General is clear about\r\nthe efforts being made by Governments and civil\r\nsociety to eradicate bad practices. New officials have\r\nbeen appointed for that purpose, and there are\r\nencouraging signs of reorganization and strengthening,\r\nwith the assistance of the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of American States, among others. But it\r\nis also clear that the reform process has been hindered\r\nby the international community’s meagre budgetary\r\nallocations for the financing of needed reforms. The\r\nreport also details the work done by Nicaragua,\r\nHonduras and El Salvador in the reform of judicial\r\nstructures and the rule of law, which will enable those\r\ncountries to work towards the ultimate objective of\r\nhaving a transparent judicial system.\r\nCurrently, Nicaragua is making major efforts to\r\nimprove the management of public affairs with the\r\ncreation of an Office of Ethical Policy, using resources\r\nreceived from seven countries and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme. There is also the ambitious\r\nplan of the Office of the Comptroller General of the\r\nRepublic to improve national auditing capacities. In El\r\nSalvador, the Legislative Assembly has adopted a law\r\nto reform the Government’s auditing agency. In\r\nHonduras, the Comptroller General and the Office of\r\nAdministrative Probity were replaced by the Superior\r\nCourt of Accounting. Guatemala’s budget law of 2003\r\nshowed slight progress in budget allocations for the\r\nministries, secretariats and other governmental\r\ninstitutions in charge of implementing the peace\r\nagreements. But the problem of corruption in the\r\nregion continues to be serious. It undermines\r\nconfidence in the political and institutional system and\r\nhinders good governance in the public sector.\r\nIn the area of trade, during the last year, the\r\nCentral American economies recovered somewhat from\r\nthe effects of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001\r\nand the global recession. The Common Market became\r\nmore dynamic as a result of negotiations on the United\r\nStates-Central American free trade agreement and the\r\nCanadian-Central American free trade agreement and\r\nthrough the entry into force of the new Uniform\r\nCustoms Code (RECAUCA) and its Regulations, in\r\nwhich a good percentage of the common external tariff\r\ncategories have been harmonized. A free trade\r\nagreement with the European Union is planned for\r\nnegotiation. Unfortunately, everything gained through\r\nthe efforts of the textile industry, exports and the\r\nincrease in export revenue was lost owing to the low\r\ncoffee prices.\r\nIn the social sector, the Central American Policy\r\non Health and the Environment was adopted, which\r\nmakes us the only subregion of the Americas with a\r\nshared cross-sector agenda of this kind.\r\nA strategic framework was adopted for dealing\r\nwith food and nutritional security, called for by the\r\nprevailing drought conditions and climatic change.\r\nThat framework is being implemented by the Social\r\nIntegration Council.\r\nWith respect to other issues, El Salvador hosted\r\nfrom 22 to 24 January 2003 the third regular session of\r\nthe Inter-American Committee against Terrorism\r\n(CICT) of the Organization of American States. During\r\nthe meeting, El Salvador ratified the Inter-American\r\nConvention against Terrorism, Nicaragua acceded to\r\nthe Convention, and Costa Rica and Peru signed a\r\nletter of understanding on the inter-American fight\r\nagainst corruption.\r\nOn 12 March in Panama City, the XIX Ministerial\r\nConference on Political Dialogue and Economic\r\nCooperation was held between the member countries of\r\nthe European Union and the Central American\r\nIntegration System (SICA). In that meeting,\r\nparticipants recognized the importance of the\r\nparticipation of civil society in order to strengthen\r\nrelations between the two organizations, and they\r\nagreed to instruct their respective missions to the\r\nUnited Nations to work on establishing international\r\nforums and mechanisms for consultation on issues such\r\nas the peaceful settlement of conflicts, the fight against\r\ndrugs and terrorism.\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nFurthermore, on 2 June 2003, delegates of eight\r\ncountries participated in a meeting on the Puebla-\r\nPanama Plan, a comprehensive initiative for integration\r\nand regional development backed by the Inter-\r\nAmerican Development Bank, for the purpose of\r\nlaunching the Mesoamerican Initiative for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, whose objective is to ensure that the\r\nprojects of the Puebla-Panama Plan comply with the\r\nappropriate environmental norms.\r\nDespite all this progress in various areas, we are\r\nstill concerned because levels of poverty continue to be\r\nsimilar to those of the 1980s. The campaign to improve\r\nthe well-being of the Central American peoples\r\ncontinues every day because our peoples have a\r\nfighting spirit and deserve the best quality of life, as do\r\nall inhabitants of the planet.\r\nMr. Mantovani (Italy): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union. The acceding\r\ncountries Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia,\r\nand Slovenia, the associated countries Bulgaria,\r\nRomania, and Turkey and the European Free Trade\r\nAssociation country member of the European\r\nEconomic Area, Iceland, declare that they align\r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union wishes to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his very comprehensive reports\r\non the situation in Central America, which provide us\r\nwith an overall picture so that we can assess progress\r\nthere and consider common future initiatives.\r\nAfter more than two decades of civil wars and the\r\nsigning of several peace agreements starting in the\r\n1990s, Central America is now consolidating its\r\ndemocratic institutions. Nevertheless, there are still\r\nmany obstacles on the road to peace, freedom and\r\neconomic development in the region.\r\nDespite the important steps that have been taken,\r\nthere is a continued risk of serious setbacks in the\r\ndemocratic process. Some of the greatest risks stem\r\nfrom the long shadows of internal conflicts, the\r\ndifficulties in making the transition to a system of\r\ndemocratic pluralism and the challenges of equitable\r\nand sustainable development. In addition, social\r\ninequality and high poverty rates are a major challenge\r\nthat can seriously inhibit active participation in the\r\ndemocratic process. And, despite the efforts of Central\r\nAmerican Governments to fight corruption, drug\r\ntrafficking and weapons smuggling, these evils\r\ncontinue to undermine internal security and slow\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe European Union reaffirms its commitment to\r\nthe promotion of human rights, fundamental freedoms\r\nand cultural diversity, which should also be realized\r\nthrough the contributions of civil society. The\r\nEuropean Union appreciates the progress achieved by\r\nCentral American Governments in consolidating\r\ndemocracy and good governance. Further progress\r\nshould be made in terms of transparent political\r\nelections, fair administration of justice, decentralized\r\nand efficient management of public affairs, the fight\r\nagainst corruption and participation by civil society in\r\npublic affairs. We call upon Central American\r\nGovernments to better guarantee internal security,\r\nwhich has deteriorated in recent years.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the important\r\ndecision of Central American countries to accelerate\r\ntheir regional integration as a vehicle for sustainable\r\ndevelopment. We recognize the substantial progress\r\nachieved in Central America’s modernization and\r\ntransformation in terms of regional economic\r\nintegration: the establishment of a customs union, the\r\nentry into force of the Settlement of Commercial\r\nDisputes Mechanism and the signing of the Central\r\nAmerican Treaty on Investment and Trade of Services.\r\nThe San José dialogue is still the main instrument\r\nfor political cooperation between the European Union\r\nand Central America, which has brought peace,\r\nsecurity and democracy to the region for the past 20\r\nyears. Through that dialogue, we also stress the\r\nimportance of regional integration for the Central\r\nAmerican countries, and we suggest that it be\r\naccelerated. At the second Summit of Heads of State\r\nand Government of the European Union, Latin America\r\nand the Caribbean, held in Madrid on 22 May 2002, the\r\ndecision was made to negotiate a political dialogue and\r\ncooperation agreement. We are thus extremely pleased\r\nabout the success of the two rounds of negotiations,\r\nheld in Panama last May and in Brussels on 3 October.\r\nWe expect the agreement to be signed in December\r\n2003, paving the way for future cooperation between\r\nthe two regions.\r\nThe European Union is following closely the\r\npolitical situation in Guatemala. In the wake of the\r\nviolence last July, the upcoming elections are\r\nespecially important. We reaffirm the need for fair and\r\npeaceful elections, and we call on the Guatemalan\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nauthorities and all the political parties involved to\r\nensure that appropriate measures are adopted for the 9\r\nNovember elections. The European Union welcomes\r\nthe positive response of the Guatemalan Government\r\nand civil society to its decision to send an electoral\r\nobserver mission to cooperate with the missions\r\norganized by the Organization of American States\r\n(OAS) and other organizations and with national\r\nobservers. By sending that electoral mission to\r\nGuatemala, the European Union is showing its\r\nwillingness not only to monitor the electoral process\r\nbut also to be present — as in the past — at a crucial\r\nmoment in the country’s democratic life.\r\nWe appreciate the recent initiative signed by 20\r\npolitical parties in Guatemala for a shared national\r\nagenda, coordinated by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme. That is an important step\r\ntowards a national pact for the enhancement of\r\ngovernance in Guatemala.\r\nWe call on the Government of Guatemala to\r\ncontinue to strengthen the justice system in order to\r\nprevent illegal forces from undermining State\r\ninstitutions and providing fertile ground for corruption,\r\norganized crime and drug trafficking. We applaud the\r\nhuman rights ombudsman’s request for OAS support to\r\nparticipate in the Commission to Investigate Illegal\r\nGroups and Clandestine Security Apparatuses.\r\nThe European Union continues to assess\r\npositively the United Nations Verification Mission in\r\nGuatemala (MINUGUA), which has helped to\r\nconsolidate the gains of the peace agreements, and\r\nsupports the extension of MINUGUA’s mandate into\r\n2004.\r\nThe European Union congratulates the\r\nGovernment of Nicaragua for its efforts to build a\r\nfuture based on good governance, sustainable\r\neconomic policies and greater integration at both the\r\nregional and global levels. We are concerned by the\r\ncontinued high poverty rate in Nicaragua, and we stress\r\nthe need for greater social equality and for a fair\r\ndistribution of resources. At the same time, we reaffirm\r\nour commitment to fostering development in that area.\r\nWe congratulate the Nicaraguan Government on the\r\nsteps it has taken to implement the national poverty\r\nreduction strategy, to strengthen its financial system\r\nand to design policies that favour sustainable economic\r\ngrowth.\r\nRegarding El Salvador, the European Union\r\nappreciates the Government’s efforts to strengthen\r\ndemocratic institutions, in particular through its\r\nappointment of an ombudsman, who plays a key role in\r\nprotecting the rights of indigenous and poor people. We\r\nexpect the Government to facilitate the ombudsman’s\r\nwork.\r\nThe European Union commends the President of\r\nHonduras for his efforts to meet the challenges of\r\npoverty and corruption in that country. However,\r\nhuman rights safeguards there are still weak and\r\nrequire strengthening.\r\nThe European Union reaffirms its full support for\r\nthe various initiatives undertaken by the OAS to find\r\nsolutions to border disputes and to guarantee that the\r\npolitical elections in Central American countries take\r\nplace in a safe environment. We welcome and\r\nencourage the moderating role of the OAS in the\r\nterritorial disputes between Guatemala and Belize, and\r\nwe urge all States in the region to settle the remaining\r\nborder disputes peacefully. We express our\r\nappreciation to the OAS for its cooperation with the\r\nEuropean verification mission that we sent to\r\nGuatemala to monitor the elections. We also express\r\nour appreciation for OAS initiatives in sectors of\r\npriority for the international community, such as mine\r\nclearance programmes in Central America, the fight\r\nagainst terrorism and drugs and efforts to create human\r\nrights safeguards, security and peace.\r\nThe European Union continues to pay close\r\nattention to the situation in Central America. Our\r\ncommitment is focused mainly on the fight against\r\npoverty and the adoption of measures to guarantee the\r\nrule of law, in compliance with international human\r\nrights and humanitarian law. The implementation of\r\nsuch measures will smooth the path to peace, free\r\nmarkets and sustainable development in Central\r\nAmerica.\r\nMr. De Alba (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nshould like at the outset to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor the reports that he has submitted to us on the\r\nsituation in Central America (A/58/270), the functions\r\nof the United Nations Verification Mission in\r\nGuatemala (MINUGUA) (A/58/262) and the situation\r\nin that country (A/58/267). We have studied them\r\nattentively.\r\nAs we indicated earlier, Mexico attaches high\r\npriority to its relations with Central America, with\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nwhich it shares historical, cultural and geographical as\r\nwell as economic ties. That is why the Government of\r\nMexico has consistently supported the peace processes\r\nin Central America and the efforts undertaken by the\r\nregion’s peoples and Governments to consolidate their\r\ndemocratic institutions, to achieve respect for human\r\nrights and to attain their economic and social\r\ndevelopment goals in the post-conflict stage. That\r\nsupport has been reflected in bilateral and regional\r\ncooperation activities in the political, scientific,\r\ntechnical, cultural, educational and economic areas and\r\nin humanitarian assistance in emergency situations.\r\nThe broadest expression of such cooperation is the\r\nPuebla-Panama Plan.\r\nWe are pleased at the conclusion of the peace\r\nprocess verification process that the United Nations\r\nhad undertaken since the signing of the peace\r\nagreements in that country. Undoubtedly, the presence\r\nand support of the United Nations were fundamental to\r\nthe building of the peace in El Salvador, as was the\r\npolitical will of the parties to the agreements and the\r\naspiration of the Salvadoran people to build that peace.\r\nWe also consider as very positive the recent submission\r\nby the Government of El Salvador of the inventory of\r\narms of its armed forces, a decision that contributes to\r\nstrengthening the climate of confidence within the\r\ncountry and in the region. The recognition by the\r\nFarabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) of\r\nthe present role of the armed forces, and its decision to\r\nwithdraw its reservation regarding their permanent\r\nnature, also constitute important progress.\r\nThe presence of MINUGUA has been very\r\npositive in giving reliability and certainty to the\r\nprocess of consolidating peace, and has been\r\nparticularly necessary insofar as the reports of the\r\nSecretary-General show mixed results regarding\r\nimplementation of commitments stemming from the\r\nagreements.\r\nThe Guatemalan Government and civil society\r\nrecognize the work of the Mission, and it is for that\r\nreason that last year they requested that it be retained\r\nbeyond December 2003, by virtue of the elections and\r\nthe change of government scheduled for the end of\r\n2003 and the beginning of 2004, respectively, and the\r\npossibility of their being gaps created in this transition\r\nstage.\r\nAs part of the friends of the peace process in\r\nGuatemala, which annually submits the draft resolution\r\non MINUGUA, Mexico fully supported that request,\r\nwhich was reflected in General Assembly resolution\r\nA/57/161. This resolution not only renewed the\r\nmandate of the Mission for one more year, until 31\r\nDecember 2003, but also left open the possibility of the\r\nmission’s supporting the process beyond that date.\r\nIn the coming days, with the support of Member\r\nStates, and in particular that of the friends of\r\nGuatemala, we shall submit a draft resolution for the\r\nrenewal of MINUGUA’s mandate for one more year, in\r\nother words, from 1 January to 31 December 2004, in\r\nwhich account is taken of resolution 57/161, and the\r\nrecommendation of the Secretary-General contained in\r\nhis report on MINUGUA in document A/58/262. We\r\nhope that this draft resolution will be adopted without a\r\nvote, as was the case in past years.\r\nSo that the continuation of the Mission for one\r\nmore year will make sense, I wish to emphasize the\r\nfundamental importance for those elected in Guatemala\r\nto endorse the commitment undertaken by the main\r\npolitical parties on 11 July of this year, under the\r\nauspices of the Organization of American States\r\n(OAS) — a commitment to recognize the peace\r\nagreements as agreements of the State, in order to\r\nenable those agreements to be fully incorporated into\r\nthe programmes of the new Government.\r\nIt is essential that all the political players reject\r\nthe use of violence so that the elections can be\r\nconducted in a climate of peace and tranquillity. It is\r\nalso important that the Government which is elected\r\ndeal with any failings in the implementation of the\r\npeace agreement, in particular, as regards human rights\r\nand the process of demilitarization, as well as the\r\nstrengthening of civil authority. These will also be the\r\nprincipal tasks of MINUGUA in 2004.\r\nLastly, as regards the possible establishment of a\r\ncommission of investigation of illegal groups and\r\nclandestine security forces, known as CICIACS, which\r\nhas the support of the United Nations and of the OAS,\r\nwe await the report that Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\nwill be submitting to this General Assembly regarding\r\nthe results of the mission that he sent to Guatemala in\r\nJuly of this year, as well as the reaction of the\r\nGuatemalan Government to the commission model\r\nproposed by the United Nations. To a great extent, the\r\ndecision of my Government regarding that commission\r\nwill depend on the report and on the reaction of the\r\nGuatemalan Government.\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nMr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nWe wish, first of all, to thank the Secretary-General for\r\nhaving submitted to us his reports on the situation in\r\nCentral America (A/58/270), the United Nations\r\nVerification Mission in Guatemala: renewal of mandate\r\n(A/58/262) and the eighth report on the United Nations\r\nVerification Mission in Guatemala (A/58/267). We are\r\nalso grateful to the Group of Friends of the peace\r\nprocess in Guatemala, which has accompanied us on\r\nthe long road towards following up on the situation in\r\nCentral America in general, and that in Guatemala in\r\nparticular. Our special thanks go to the Mexican\r\ndelegation, which, year after year, has facilitated the\r\npreparation of a draft resolution on this subject. Of\r\ncourse, we associate ourselves with the statement made\r\nby the distinguished delegate of Costa Rica, who spoke\r\non behalf of all the countries of Central America.\r\nI am taking the floor on a very specific matter,\r\nand that is the fact that, for a number of years now —\r\nand more or less at this very same time — we have\r\nbeen dealing with the agenda item on the situation in\r\nCentral America, including the situation in Guatemala.\r\nAs you know, since 1994, a United Nations Verification\r\nMission has been operating in our country. Its original\r\npurpose was to verify compliance with an agreement\r\non human rights. In December of 1996, however, its\r\nmandate was expanded to help the parties to the peace\r\nagreements by carrying out tasks of verification,\r\nfacilitation, provision of information to the public and\r\ngood offices. These agreements continue to be works in\r\nprogress, marked by advances as well as inadequacies\r\nand even setbacks, all of which are described in the\r\nreports to which I have referred.\r\nI might add that, lately, the Secretary-General’s\r\nreports have described more setbacks than advances.\r\nThis is not the right place to go into the question of\r\nwhether the right balance has been struck; for our part\r\nwe do feel that there has been a tendency to\r\nunderestimate the positive developments. We can,\r\nhowever, agree that the tasks which are still pending\r\nare numerous. Nor is this the right time to assign\r\nresponsibilities for the less-than-fully-satisfactory\r\noverall situation that we face. There can be no doubt\r\nthat the Government headed by President Alfonso\r\nPortillo has recognized its share of responsibilities, not\r\nso much in the sphere of its intentions, but rather in the\r\nimplementation of the commitments. The fact is that\r\nsince the process is as yet uncompleted, this would not\r\nbe the appropriate time for withdrawing the\r\nVerification Mission.\r\nThis is why, in September 2002, as the\r\ndistinguished representative of Mexico just recalled,\r\nPresident Portillo observed the following, and I quote:\r\n“My Government’s term of office will\r\nexpire in a little over a year, by which time the\r\nUnited Nations Verification Mission in\r\nGuatemala (MINUGUA) will be planning to\r\nwithdraw. The Mission has played a fundamental\r\nrole as the critical conscience of the State and has\r\nactively supported the changes that have taken\r\nplace. We appreciate the work it has\r\naccomplished and we wish here to request the\r\nextension of the mission’s mandate to the end of\r\n2004, so that it may accompany us as we make a\r\ntransition to a new administration. Our hope is\r\nthat MINUGUA will hand its functions over in an\r\norderly way to national bodies and, where\r\nappropriate, to the programmes and agencies of\r\nthe United Nations system.”\r\nIt was pursuant to that request, which, at that\r\ntime, was supported by many countries, including the\r\nGroup of Friends of the Guatemalan peace process, that\r\nthe General Assembly, in renewing the mandate of the\r\nMission for a further year through its resolution\r\n57/161, asked the Secretary-General\r\n“to submit, as early as possible, an updated report\r\nto the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nsession, together with his recommendations\r\nregarding the best way to accompany Guatemala\r\nin its peace-building process beyond 31\r\nDecember 2003.”\r\nThe Secretary-General, for his part, recommends\r\nin his report A/58/262, that the mandate of MINUGUA\r\nbe extended for the period 1 January to 31 December\r\n2004. He does so in view of the difficulties that\r\ncontinue to hobble the peace process and in order to\r\ncooperate with the new authorities, which, as a result\r\nof the electoral process to be held next Sunday, will\r\ntake office in mid-January 2004. The intention of the\r\nextension is to ensure their commitment to the peace\r\nagreements. At the same time, the Secretary-General,\r\nhaving in mind the gradual transfer of functions from\r\nMINUGUA to government bodies and other United\r\nNations agencies, proposes a significant reduction of\r\nthe staff of MINUGUA.\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nThe Government of Guatemala concurs fully with\r\nthe Secretary-General’s recommendations and requests\r\nall other Members of the Organization to do likewise.\r\nWe believe that MINUGUA’s continued presence in\r\nGuatemala for an additional year is indispensable for\r\nthe reasons eloquently described in the report. We\r\nintend to strengthen the national bodies that will take\r\nover the functions that are still being performed by\r\nMINUGUA. We are also in the process of upgrading\r\nthe status of the office in Guatemala of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nFurthermore, as the representative of Mexico also\r\nindicated, we are in consultations with the Secretariat\r\nregarding a new activity that would involve the United\r\nNations in a new initiative being taken by the\r\nGovernment aimed at combating organized crime\r\nthrough a Commission for the Investigation of Illegal\r\nBodies and Clandestine Security Apparatuses in\r\nGuatemala.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish to reiterate what was said\r\nhere last year: we seek not to perpetuate but rather to\r\nextend the presence of MINUGUA in Guatemala. It is\r\nour hope that the members of the Assembly will join us\r\nin this endeavour, which will allow us to capitalize on\r\nthe considerable investment in efforts and resources\r\nthat has been made by the United Nations in helping\r\nGuatemalans to consolidate their process toward\r\nattaining peace, democracy and development.\r\nMr. Laurin (Canada): Canada congratulates the\r\ncountries of Central America for their achievements in\r\nthe pursuit of peace and democracy and for putting an\r\nend to the civil conflicts that had so severely affected\r\nthe region. The celebration earlier this year of the tenth\r\nanniversary of the peace accords in El Salvador is an\r\nexcellent reminder of how innovative approaches to\r\nending civil conflicts can succeed by addressing the\r\nroot causes of such conflicts and by transforming the\r\ninstitutions that had served to preserve the status quo.\r\nThrough the Canadian International Development\r\nAgency, Canada has targeted its development\r\nassistance to Central America over the past few\r\ndecades towards addressing the root causes of the\r\nconflict, which include poverty, lack of access to basic\r\nsocial services, environmental degradation, agrarian\r\nreform, and the marginalization of women and\r\nindigenous groups. Canada recognizes that the\r\ncountries of Central America continue to struggle with\r\npolitical, social and economic challenges that are often\r\nmagnified by the vulnerability of the region to natural\r\ndisasters. We commend their efforts to address many of\r\nthese challenges, including measures that have been\r\ntaken to strengthen economic cooperation, to open\r\neconomies, to increase transparency and to strengthen\r\npolitical and social inclusiveness.\r\nWhile there has undoubtedly been progress on\r\nmany fronts, Canada remains concerned by evidence of\r\ncontinuing human rights abuses and the impunity with\r\nwhich these abuses continue to be committed. More\r\nwork clearly needs to be done. For example,\r\ndemilitarization remains as an important and necessary\r\nobjective. In this regard, we welcome Guatemala’s\r\ndefinitive demobilization of its Presidential General\r\nStaff, as well as the support the region gave to the\r\nproject on preventing and combating the illegal\r\ntrafficking of small arms and light weapons, which was\r\napproved in June 2003 during the XXVI Central\r\nAmerican Security Commission meeting in Panama.\r\nCanada is supportive of the Government of\r\nGuatemala’s request to extend the United Nations\r\nVerification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) for\r\none more year, given that Guatemala will hold\r\nelections this month and that a new Administration is\r\nexpected to take office in January 2004. It is Canada’s\r\nhope that the incoming Government, as well as those\r\nState and non-governmental organizations involved in\r\nthe implementation of the peace plan, will remain fully\r\ncommitted to meeting Guatemala’s obligations under\r\nthe 1996 Peace Accords. We do, however, expect that\r\nthis will be the last extension of the Mission’s mandate.\r\nCanada therefore encourages MINUGUA to work\r\nclosely with Guatemalan State and civil society\r\ninstitutions to enhance their capacity to assume the\r\nroles and responsibilities of the Mission by the end of\r\nnext year. In this regard, we welcomed the October\r\n2002 signature of a memorandum of understanding\r\nbetween MINUGUA and the Guatemalan Special\r\nProsecutor for Human Rights, in which they outlined\r\nthe transition process ahead. Recognizing the\r\ndetrimental impact that the existence of illegal armed\r\ngroups and their links to organized crime has had on\r\nGuatemala’s security and economic situation, Canada\r\ncommends both Guatemala and the United Nations for\r\ntheir joint efforts to elaborate a mechanism to address\r\nthese problems. We hope that such a mechanism can be\r\nfinalized as soon as possible.\r\nFinally, Canada shares the concerns outlined by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his report on MINUGUA of\r\n11 August 2003. In that report, the Secretary-General\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nemphasized the continuing deterioration of public\r\nsecurity, the persistence of a culture of impunity, and a\r\nworsening climate of intimidation that includes attacks\r\nagainst human rights defenders, journalists and social\r\nand political activists. We urge the Government of\r\nGuatemala to take resolute steps in addressing these\r\nissues and to ensure that the upcoming elections take\r\nplace in a safe and secure environment where all\r\nGuatemalans will feel free to exercise their vote\r\nwithout fear of intimidation or manipulation.\r\nMr. Løvald (Norway): In the years that have\r\npassed since the end of the armed conflicts in Central\r\nAmerica, the main challenges facing the countries of\r\nthat region have been the eradication of poverty and\r\nthe protection of human rights. The key issues in that\r\nstruggle, both past and present, are good governance,\r\nsustainable economic development, an end to impunity\r\nand the strengthening of civilian police structures.\r\nAs regards good governance, I would like to note\r\nthat this is one of the main areas of Norway’s\r\ncooperative efforts in the region. My Government fully\r\nendorses the conclusions of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that significant efforts have already been made\r\nin tackling the problem of corruption. The recently\r\nconcluded Consultative Group meeting held in\r\nManagua demonstrated broad and unanimous support\r\nfor the Nicaraguan Government’s impressive efforts in\r\nfighting corruption.\r\nAnother important aspect of governance is the\r\nneed to depoliticize government agencies and the\r\njudicial system. Elections have taken place in an\r\norderly and transparent manner over the past year, as\r\nwas the case in El Salvador. In a few days, elections\r\nwill be held in Guatemala and we are confident that the\r\nelections will be carried out in an orderly and\r\ntransparent way, allowing all Guatemalan citizens to\r\nexercise their democratic rights without undue\r\ninterference or pressure. We commend the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations agencies and of the Organization of\r\nAmerican States (OAS) in the preparations for the\r\nelections, and have supported these efforts through our\r\ncooperation with Guatemala. We also support the\r\nmonitoring and verification of the election results by\r\nOAS and the Supreme Electoral Tribunal’s voter\r\nregistration campaign.\r\nIt is of paramount importance that the new\r\nGuatemalan Government, which will take over next\r\nJanuary, continues to work actively for the\r\nimplementation of the peace accords, important\r\nelements of which still need to be fulfilled. That is not\r\nto say that significant progress has not been made in a\r\nnumber of areas, such as anti-discrimination legislation\r\nand the development of a national reparations\r\nprogramme for the victims of human rights violations\r\nduring the armed conflict. We are, however, concerned\r\nabout some of the information contained in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report in regard to the human\r\nrights situation in Guatemala. It is important that the\r\nnecessary steps be taken to improve that situation. For\r\nthat reason, we support the extension of the mandate of\r\nthe United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala\r\nfor one more year.\r\nIt is an encouraging development that the\r\nGovernments of Central America are now making use\r\nof international instruments adequate to resolve their\r\nborder disputes in a peaceful manner. We fully support\r\nthe call of the Secretary-General for the Governments\r\nof Belize and Guatemala to give serious consideration\r\nto the proposals made last year to end their border\r\ndispute.\r\nMr. Sevilla Somoza (Nicaragua) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): First, I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his very complete report on the situation in\r\nCentral America (A/58/270). This report provides a\r\nsummary of the developments in the past year in\r\nCentral America, in particular, efforts to overcome the\r\naftermath of the conflicts of the 1980s and to build\r\nequitable, democratic and peaceful societies.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of\r\nthe Central American Group and we want to take this\r\nopportunity to comment on specific activities\r\nundertaken by Nicaragua in that regard.\r\nThe fight against impunity remains one of the\r\ncentral challenges confronting our region. The\r\nNicaraguan Government recognizes that courageous\r\nand decisive action must be taken to combat the\r\nscourge of corruption, which is promoted by impunity.\r\nCorruption destroys the credibility of democratic\r\ninstitutions, it jeopardizes political stability and is\r\ndangerously linked to other dimensions of organized\r\ncrime, such as drug trafficking, which undermines any\r\nsociety.\r\nThe Nicaraguan Government of President Enrique\r\nBolaños has ambitiously undertaken one of the most\r\nambitious tasks undertaken by Nicaragua to date: to\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nestablish a new ethics and a new culture in public\r\nadministration — one of probity, honesty and correct\r\nand efficient management of public funds — in order\r\nto confront and overcome the endemic evil of\r\ncorruption. The policy seeks to ensure that government\r\nleaders and public officials live up to their\r\nresponsibilities and behave in accordance with the\r\nexpectations of our citizens — in other words, that they\r\nbe honourable public servants and not potentates who\r\ntake public resources for themselves.\r\nFurther to this effort, in order to promote the\r\ninstitutionalization of transparency, Nicaragua has\r\nestablished policies and systems for the control and\r\nauditing of public finances. Nevertheless, we do\r\nrecognize that a great deal remains to be done to\r\nachieve the promise of expeditious and due justice. A\r\nfunctional judiciary can only be achieved by\r\nmodernizing the whole system, giving judges and\r\nmagistrates the proper tools to fulfil their mandate.\r\nThat requires changes in existing legislation, reform of\r\nthe current legal codes, training of legal personnel,\r\nestablishment of a judicial career path and investment\r\nin physical infrastructure.\r\nWe appreciate the international community’s\r\nsupport for our resolve to make civil service ethical\r\nand to organize the institutions of the State so that they\r\nrespond to professional, non-partisan criteria. That\r\nsupport was evident at the Consultative Group meeting\r\nlast month in Managua, which enjoyed broad\r\nparticipation by friendly countries and cooperating\r\nagencies.\r\nNicaragua has also undertaken initiatives to\r\ntransform its military and security forces in accordance\r\nwith democratic principles. At the meeting of Central\r\nAmerican Presidents in Guatemala on 17 July of this\r\nyear, President Bolaños presented a draft programme\r\nfor the limitation and control of weapons in Central\r\nAmerica, designed to achieve a reasonable balance of\r\nforces in the region and to promote stability, mutual\r\nconfidence and transparency. His proposal was\r\nenthusiastically and unanimously welcomed by his\r\nCentral American counterparts and was subsequently\r\nsubmitted to the Central American Security\r\nCommission for implementation. That Commission, at\r\nits twenty-seventh meeting held last month in El\r\nSalvador, complied with the request of the Presidents\r\nof the region to set a timetable for the implementation\r\nof the programme within a 14-month period.\r\nIn this way — following up effectively on the\r\nUnited Nations Programme of Action to Prevent,\r\nCombat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\r\nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects — Nicaragua\r\nwill serve as the headquarters of the Central American\r\nproject for the control of the illicit trade in small arms\r\nand light weapons, thus implementing the Inter-\r\nAmerican Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing\r\nof and Traffic in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives\r\nand Other Related Materials.\r\nWhile the fragmentation and the cult of\r\npersonality that characterize Central American political\r\nparties can yield political gains in the short term, in the\r\nlong term they discourage political participation by the\r\npeople, undermine the credibility of democratic\r\ninstitutions and hamper the progress of the country.\r\nRecognizing the fact that sustainable development\r\nrequires long-term planning, the Nicaraguan\r\nGovernment presented the National Development Plan\r\nto the political, economic and social stakeholders in\r\nNicaragua and to the international community. It is our\r\nhope that, having been enriched by the input of all\r\nsectors of Nicaraguan society throughout the country,\r\nthe Plan will serve as a map and a compass to guide us,\r\nso that Nicaragua can achieve long-term sustainable\r\ndevelopment at the social, economic, environment and\r\norganizational levels.\r\nMr. Lagos Pizzati (El Salvador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I should like at the outset fully to associate\r\nmyself with the statement made by Ambassador Bruno\r\nStagno Ugarte, the Permanent Representative of Costa\r\nRica, who addressed the plenary this afternoon on\r\nbehalf of all the members of the Central American\r\nIntegration System, of which we are a member.\r\nDuring most of the 1980s, my country, El\r\nSalvador, was involved in an internal crisis, in a\r\nCentral America characterized by dangerous upheaval.\r\nBut today, El Salvador is a transformed society that\r\nlooks to the future with optimism as a result of the\r\nhistoric commitments that made that transformation\r\npossible.\r\nWe Salvadorans are extremely proud of the\r\ncourage and determination that led us to adopt, through\r\ndialogue and cooperation, the important covenants that\r\nnot only put an end to war but that also have made us\r\ninto a new and peaceful society that has once again\r\nembarked on the path towards development. In this\r\nnew society, day by day we are witnessing the further\r\n29\r\nA/58/PV.55\r\nconsolidation of what once was only an aspiration —\r\nfull respect for human rights, democratization and our\r\nreconciliation.\r\nAll of those lofty aspirations have now been\r\nachieved, but we Salvadorans are aware that we have\r\nthe obligation daily to continue to build on the\r\nachievements recorded, and that the task of\r\nconsolidating them can never be considered complete.\r\nIt is on the basis of that firm and unswerving\r\nconviction that we envisage El Salvador’s future in\r\nterms of the democratic and equitable nation to which\r\nwe aspire.\r\nThe achievements registered by the Salvadoran\r\npeople and the commitments undertaken by our\r\nGovernment prompted the Secretary-General to report\r\nto the General Assembly that the role of verification of\r\nthe United Nations in El Salvador had at last been\r\ncompleted. That was a source of deep satisfaction for\r\nus, and we wish to reiterate our deep appreciation to\r\nthe entire international community for having helped us\r\nthroughout this successful process.\r\nWe wish to thank in particular all those countries\r\nthat are members of the Group of Friends for the peace\r\nprocess in El Salvador, the Secretary-General and all\r\nSecretariat personnel who were directly or indirectly\r\ninvolved in the exercise of building a new El Salvador.\r\nTo each and every one, we wish to say that future\r\ngenerations in EL Salvador will always be profoundly\r\ngrateful to them and will hold them in the deepest\r\nesteem.\r\nEl Salvador has now begun a new chapter in its\r\nhistory, and we are tackling, in a spirit of optimism, our\r\ngreatest challenge: the comprehensive development of\r\nour Salvadoran and Central American society. Since we\r\nabandoned the use of weapons as a means of\r\nexpressing our views, we have succeeded in recovering\r\nmuch of what was lost during all those years of\r\nviolence and destruction. We all are involved in that\r\nprocess, despite having had to contend with destructive\r\nnatural disasters that might well have laid waste to\r\nmore than one region or country with characteristics\r\nlike ours.\r\nWe are aware, however, that much remains to be\r\ndone, and that we are facing major threats that could\r\nlead to setbacks. In that context, we welcome the report\r\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General on the situation in\r\nCentral America, in which he highlights some of the\r\nchallenges that we are now confronting. Indeed, we\r\nagree that we must now redouble our efforts in order to\r\nmeet those challenges successfully.\r\nWe are also grateful for the offers made by some\r\nmembers of the international community and by the\r\nUnited Nations to continue to support us in our\r\nprocess. In a world of upheaval threatened by irrational\r\nviolence and terror, we cannot afford to forget about\r\npast successes or to overlook those achievements that\r\nmake clear, more than ever before, the importance of\r\ntackling our problems in a collective and united\r\nmanner, with the firm conviction that we are building a\r\nbetter world.\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has this\r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item\r\n26.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.\r\n"
