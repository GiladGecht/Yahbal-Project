Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 160 (continued)\r\nGlobal road safety crisis\r\nDraft resolution (A/58/L.3/Rev.1)\r\nThe President: Members will recall that the\r\nAssembly held the debate on this agenda item at its\r\n41st and 42nd plenary meetings, on 21 and 22 October\r\n2003.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution\r\nA/58/L.3/Rev.1. I give the floor to the representative of\r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMs. Kelley (Department for General Assembly\r\nand Conference Management): I should like to inform\r\nMember States that, under the terms of operative\r\nparagraph 4 of draft resolution A/58/L.3/Rev.1, the\r\nGeneral Assembly would request the Department of\r\nPublic Information to organize a meeting of experts,\r\nthe private sector, relevant non-governmental\r\norganizations, members of civil society and other\r\ninterested parties, including the media, on the morning\r\nof 15 April 2004, in conjunction with the plenary\r\nmeeting, to raise awareness and exchange information\r\non best road practices.\r\nAdvice was provided to the Secretariat by the\r\nsponsor of operative paragraph 4 that the content of the\r\nparagraph would be provided within the framework of\r\nthe weekly non-governmental organization briefings\r\nthat the Department of Public Information organizes\r\nroutinely on Thursday mornings. On the basis of that\r\nclarification, no additional appropriations would be\r\nrequired in the biennium 2004-2005 as a result of the\r\nadoption of draft resolution A/58/L.3/Rev.1.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on draft resolution A/58/L.3/Rev.1. Before\r\ngoing further, I should like to announce that since the\r\npublication of the draft resolution, the following\r\ncountry has become a sponsor of A/58/L.3/Rev.1: Viet\r\nNam.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/58/L.3/Rev.1?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution\r\n58/9).\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has thus\r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item\r\n160.\r\nAgenda item 27\r\nZone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/265)\r\nDraft resolution (A/58/L.12)\r\nMr. Cappagli (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nam honoured to introduce draft resolution A/58/L.12 on\r\nbehalf of the African and Latin American member\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nStates of the Zone of Peace and Cooperation of the\r\nSouth Atlantic, which are the following: Benin, Brazil,\r\nCape Verde, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Ghana,\r\nGuinea, Liberia, Namibia, Nigeria, Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo,\r\nUruguay and Argentina, and now Angola has joined.\r\nEighteen years ago, the countries of the South\r\nAtlantic decided to create an innovative mechanism for\r\nongoing consultations on issues of mutual interest and\r\nto develop closer, more active and dynamic relations.\r\nTo that end, we established the Zone of Peace and\r\nCooperation of the South Atlantic, which is the sole\r\ninterregional forum of its kind, grouping together\r\nStates of South America and Africa.\r\nSince the establishment of the Zone, we have\r\nbeen able to make tangible progress towards the\r\nachievement of the objectives set forth in 1985, having\r\ndeveloped in particular mechanisms to cooperate in the\r\nfields of economic and social development,\r\nenvironmental protection, preservation of marine living\r\nresources and the maintenance of peace throughout the\r\nregion.\r\nWhile reaffirming the importance of the Zone as a\r\nbasis for the development of cooperation among the\r\ncountries that share the South Atlantic, Argentina also\r\nbelieves that it is necessary to renew and strengthen the\r\ncontent of that cooperation. My country firmly believes\r\nthat the objectives of peace and cooperation for which\r\nthe Zone was established will be attained only when\r\nthe institutions of representative democracy are fully\r\noperative and respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms is attained in the member\r\ncountries of the Zone.\r\nIn 1998, Argentina assumed coordination of the\r\nStanding Committee of the Zone in its capacity as host\r\nof the most recent conference and in view of its special\r\ninterest in strengthening peace and security and\r\npromoting a cooperative relationship among the States\r\nof the South Atlantic. My country has proposed a series\r\nof actions and initiatives with the aim of making\r\nprogress in the various areas set forth in the Final\r\nDeclaration and the Plan of Action adopted at the fifth\r\nministerial meeting of the Zone, held in Buenos Aires\r\nin October 1998.\r\nWith this in mind, we pointed out, inter alia, the\r\npotential of holding political consultations among the\r\nStates members on issues of mutual interest addressed\r\nby the United Nations, and we proposed that the Zone\r\nbe transformed into a valuable forum for support and\r\npromotion of democracy in our respective regions.\r\nTaking into account that one of the objectives of\r\nthe Zone is the peaceful and negotiated solution of\r\nexisting disputes, we call on all States, both members\r\nand non-members of the Zone, to pledge to peacefully,\r\njustly and definitively solve all disputes in the South\r\nAtlantic, in accordance with the principles and\r\npurposes of the Charter of the United Nations and the\r\nrelevant resolutions of this Organization.\r\nIn this connection, it is worth recalling that when\r\nthe General Assembly established the Zone of Peace\r\nand Cooperation of the South Atlantic, it called on all\r\nStates to cooperate in the elimination of all sources of\r\ntension, to respect the national unity, sovereignty,\r\npolitical independence and territorial integrity of every\r\nState of the South Atlantic and to strictly observe the\r\nprinciple that the acquisition of territories by force is\r\ninadmissible.\r\nI would not like to conclude without expressing\r\nour appreciation for the generous offer of Benin to host\r\nthe sixth high-level meeting of the States members of\r\nthe Zone of Peace and Cooperation of the South\r\nAtlantic. We hope that it will be possible to hold that\r\nmeeting sometime in 2004 and strengthen even further\r\nthe relations of friendship and cooperation among the\r\n24 countries of Latin America and Africa that are\r\nmembers of that forum.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to request all\r\ndelegations present in this Hall to bear in mind the\r\nnoble goals of the Zone of Peace and Cooperation of\r\nthe South Atlantic and to extend their support to draft\r\nresolution A/58/L.12.\r\nMr. Adekanye (Nigeria): The initiative taken in\r\n1986 by the 24 member States from the two shores of\r\nthe South Atlantic to create the Zone of Peace and\r\nCooperation of the South Atlantic and approved by the\r\nGeneral Assembly in its resolution 41/11 of 27 October\r\n1986 remains a landmark achievement in the sphere of\r\nmultilateral efforts to promote regional peace,\r\ninternational security and cooperation. It established a\r\nvaluable framework for cooperation whose objectives,\r\nincluding the complete denuclearization of the region,\r\nprotection of the marine environment, promotion of\r\neconomic cooperation, trade and investment and the\r\nfight against drug trafficking remain valid today.\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nAs an earnest indication of Nigeria’s commitment\r\nto the pursuit of these objectives, we, in 2001, ratified\r\nor acceded to the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone\r\nTreaty — the Treaty of Pelindaba — the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and\r\nthe Ottawa Convention on landmines. Similarly, in\r\nconsultation with concerned member States of the\r\nZone, Nigeria is actively seeking the required number\r\nof ratifications for the entry into force of the Treaty of\r\nPelindaba. A draft resolution to that effect is being\r\npresented at the current session of the General\r\nAssembly. When adopted, the draft resolution will\r\nenhance the shared objectives of the Zone.\r\nThe delegation of Nigeria is equally gratified to\r\nnote that, Cuba’s ratification last year of the NPT and\r\nthe Treaty of Tlatelolco, all member States of the Zone\r\nare now irrevocably committed to a nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree South Atlantic.\r\nNigeria remains concerned with the continued\r\nincidence of transboundary movement of wastes and\r\ntransportation of radioactive materials that could\r\nconstitute a threat to marine life of coastal States and\r\nthe ecosystem of the entire region. We reiterate\r\nNigeria’s commitment to the Bamako Convention on\r\nthe Ban on the Import into Africa and the Control of\r\nTransboundary Movement and Management of\r\nHazardous Wastes within Africa. We also support the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency’s Code of\r\nPractice on the International Transboundary Movement\r\nof Radioactive Waste, aimed at protecting all States\r\nfrom the dumping of radioactive wastes on their\r\nterritories.\r\nThe latest challenge to the peace and security of\r\nthe Zone is the illicit circulation of small arms and\r\nlight weapons. It has fuelled conflicts and hampered\r\npeace, security and development of some of the\r\ncountries of the Zone. The active participation of\r\nmember States of the Zone in the 2001 United Nations\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects, as well as the first\r\nBiennial Meeting of States to Consider the\r\nImplementation of the 2001 Programme of Action on\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects,\r\nwhich took place in New York last July, is indicative of\r\nour desire to confront the problem. We call on the\r\ninternational community to give support to this desire\r\nthrough implementation of the Programme of Action\r\nagreed to at that Conference.\r\nLast year, the Assembly adopted a resolution of\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) as the main platform of Africa’s\r\ndevelopment. This decision, in our view, strengthens\r\ninternational support for Africa. The faithful\r\nimplementation of NEPAD objectives will therefore\r\nreinvigorate cooperation in our Zone.\r\nOut of the conviction that corruption constitutes\r\none of the biggest obstacles to development, Nigeria\r\nplaced the issue of an international legally binding\r\ninstrument to control corruption on the global agenda\r\nin 1999. For us, tracing and repatriating funds of illicit\r\norigin to their countries of origin was of crucial\r\nimportance. Happily, this Assembly last Friday adopted\r\na resolution approving the draft United Nations\r\nConvention to Combat Corruption. Undoubtedly, this\r\nimportant decision will further accelerate cooperation\r\nin our Zone. We therefore urge all States in the Zone,\r\nindeed all Member States of this Organization, to\r\nsubscribe to this Treaty at the High-level Political\r\nSigning Conference, scheduled to be held in Mérida,\r\nMexico, next month, as well as to initiate the process\r\nfor its early ratification.\r\nFinally, the Nigerian delegation expresses its\r\nconcern over the increase in drug trafficking and\r\nrelated crimes. We call on the international community\r\nand members of the Zone to promote regional and\r\ninternational cooperation to combat all aspects of the\r\nproblem of drugs and related offences.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/58/L.12. May I take it that the Assembly\r\ndecides to adopt draft resolution A/58/L.12?\r\nDraft resolution A/58/L.12 was adopted\r\n(resolution 58/10).\r\nThe President: I thank everyone for the excellent\r\ncooperation on this particular matter. May I take it that\r\nit is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 27?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nAgenda item 32\r\nQuestion of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)\r\nThe President: I should like to inform\r\nrepresentatives that, following consultations regarding\r\nagenda item 32, on the question of the Falkland Islands\r\n(Malvinas), and taking into account General Assembly\r\ndecision 57/511 of 11 November 2002, it is proposed\r\nthat the General Assembly decide to postpone\r\nconsideration of this item and to include it in the\r\nprovisional agenda of its fifty-ninth session.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly, taking into\r\naccount decision 57/511, wishes to defer consideration\r\nof this item and to include it on the provisional agenda\r\nof the fifty-ninth session?\r\nIt is so decided.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 32.\r\nAgenda item 22\r\nAssistance in mine action\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/260 and\r\nAdd.1)\r\nMr. Mantovani (Italy): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union. The acceding\r\ncountries Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia\r\nand Slovenia, the associated countries Bulgaria,\r\nRomania and Turkey, and the European Free Trade\r\nAssociation country member of the European\r\nEconomic Area Iceland align themselves with this\r\nstatement.\r\nAt the outset, allow me to pay tribute to the\r\ncourage of de-miners and of all those involved in mine\r\naction, whose dedication to the cause of a world free\r\nfrom anti-personnel landmines and unexploded\r\nordnance (UXO) often exposes them to the most\r\nserious dangers. I would also like to commend efforts\r\nby the affected communities themselves, the Standing\r\nCommittees and States parties to the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction, the United Nations Mine Action Services\r\nand all relevant United Nations agencies, the Mine\r\nAction Support Group, the International Campaign to\r\nBan Landmines and its many affiliated non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross, the Geneva International\r\nCentre for Humanitarian Demining and all other\r\ninstitutions and organizations committed to the\r\ncommon goal of reducing human suffering and\r\nincreasing human security.\r\nWe cannot ignore that the unwavering endeavour\r\naimed at eradicating anti-personnel landmines and\r\nUXOs worldwide is still required. Reliable figures\r\nindicate that in 2001-2002 landmine casualties were\r\nreported in 70 countries around the world. The total\r\nnumber of new victims is estimated at between 15,000\r\nand 20,000 per year. It is appalling that approximately\r\n70 per cent of reported casualties were civilians,\r\nespecially women and children, often well after the end\r\nof armed conflicts. Furthermore, anti-personnel mines\r\nand UXOs have severe economic and social\r\nconsequences. The mutilation of victims places a heavy\r\nburden on afflicted countries already struggling to\r\nrebuild their societies and overcome severe financial\r\nconstraints. Moreover, situations in which refugees are\r\nprevented from returning to their homes because of\r\nanti-personnel mines pose a recurrent challenge. Post-\r\nconflict reconstruction, economic recovery, social\r\nrehabilitation and development are thereby seriously\r\nhampered.\r\nThat is why support for international mine action\r\nranks today among the political priorities of the\r\nEuropean Union. The European Union was among the\r\nfirst to condemn the indiscriminate character of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines, and to recognize the unbearable\r\nsuffering they impose on civilian populations and to\r\ntake concrete action to alleviate it.\r\nWhile the primary responsibility for the problem\r\nof landmines and unexploded ordnance in affected\r\ncountries lies with national authorities, the acquisition\r\nof the institutional and technical means needed to\r\ntackle it is often hindered by lack of financial\r\nresources. The United Nations can contribute to\r\naddressing such challenges through an integrated\r\napproach based on humanitarian assistance and\r\ndevelopment strategies.\r\nI would like to commend the Secretary-General\r\nfor his report on assistance in mine action (A/58/260),\r\nwhich represents an important step towards\r\nstreamlining and enhancing international coordination\r\nin this field. The European Union welcomes the\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nprogress indicated in the report and notes with great\r\ninterest its conclusions and recommendations. The\r\nresults achieved in the implementation of the six\r\nstrategic goals of the 2001-2005 United Nations mine-\r\naction strategy are particularly important. Among\r\nthem, it is worth mentioning the increased data\r\nprovided through the electronic mine information\r\nnetwork; the ongoing support for relevant research and\r\ndevelopment activities; the testing in Iraq of the United\r\nNations operational framework for rapid response; the\r\ndevelopment of a common format for gathering\r\nemergency assessment data on mine and unexploded\r\nordnance hazards; the ongoing efforts to build national\r\nand local mine-action capacities in over 30 countries;\r\nthe drafting of initial guidelines for transition strategies\r\nfor United Nations-supported mine-action programmes\r\nat the national and local levels; the agreement to\r\ndevelop guidelines for the integration of a gender\r\nperspective into mine-action programmes; and\r\nstrengthened management and oversight of the\r\nInternational Mine Action Standards.\r\nIt is encouraging to note that the international\r\ncommunity agrees on a set of basic principles\r\nunderpinning mine-action programmes, including the\r\nneed to promote the further involvement of mine-\r\naffected communities when determining mine-action\r\npriorities and to integrate mine action into\r\nhumanitarian and development planning and\r\noperations.\r\nThe European Union agrees that mine action must\r\nbe an integral part of the consolidated appeals process\r\nand welcomes the inclusion of mine-action\r\nrequirements in peacekeeping mission planning and\r\nstructures, as appropriate.\r\nAlthough the Secretary-General’s report indicates\r\nthat progress has been achieved, it also points out that\r\nfurther work needs to be done. In that respect, it is\r\nimportant that the United Nations mine-action strategy\r\nfor the period 2005-2009 be elaborated in 2005.\r\nThe European Union is convinced that a\r\nprecondition for effective mine action is a\r\ncomprehensive and balanced approach combining mine\r\nclearance, stockpile destruction, victim assistance,\r\ncapacity-building and mine-risk education. An\r\nadequate level of funding for international mine action\r\nought to be maintained over the coming years,\r\nespecially in those areas, such as victim assistance, that\r\nrepresent a long-term concern for affected countries. In\r\nthat respect, sustainability and local ownership of\r\nhumanitarian mine action should be promoted.\r\nEnhanced cooperation among donor and recipient\r\ncountries remains a key factor for the success of\r\ninternational mine-action activities. In this context, I\r\nwish to commend the United Nations Mine Action\r\nService, the International Committee of the Red Cross,\r\nthe Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian\r\nDemining and the International Campaign to Ban\r\nLandmines for the coordinating role they are playing.\r\nThe European Union is firmly convinced that the\r\nappalling impact of landmines and unexploded\r\nordnance on civilian populations needs to be dealt with\r\nthrough an undiminished level of financial support for\r\nmine action and through a consistent political\r\ncommitment to the universalization and full\r\nimplementation of the relevant multilateral framework\r\nof humanitarian law.\r\nAs far as the first aspect is concerned, the\r\nunwavering commitment of the European Union is\r\nshown by its ongoing financial assistance for\r\ninternational mine action. In 2002, overall European\r\nUnion funding — earmarked for mine action by\r\nmember States and the European Community (EC) —\r\namounted to 145 million euros.\r\nIn a broader perspective, it is worth recalling that\r\nthe European Community pledged 240 million euros\r\nfor the period 2002-2009, matching the standards of\r\nmajor donor countries. Following two ad hoc\r\nregulations adopted in 2001, the EC Mine Action\r\nStrategy and multi-annual programming for 2002-2004,\r\nendorsed last year, represent the appropriate mid-term\r\noperational framework to coordinate and prioritize\r\nEuropean-financed projects in this specific field. As\r\nalready indicated, this effort is complemented by\r\nnational funding by European Union member States. In\r\nparticular, by focusing on five mutually reinforcing\r\ncomponents — advocacy to stigmatize the use of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines and support for their total ban;\r\nmine-risk education; mine clearance; victim assistance;\r\nand stockpile destruction — the EC Mine Action\r\nStrategy is fully consistent with the United Nations\r\nmine-action strategy.\r\nI wish to reaffirm that the European Union will\r\nprioritize its financial aid towards those countries that\r\nadhere to the principles and obligations of the Mine\r\nBan Convention. Membership of the Mine Ban\r\nConvention and strict compliance with all its\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nprovisions remain crucial element in directing relevant\r\nEuropean Union funding. However, the European\r\nUnion may also consider providing financial support to\r\nStates not party to the Mine Ban Convention, should\r\nhumanitarian emergencies arise. As in the past, that\r\nsupport will be contingent upon proven political will\r\nby the recipient country to move towards accession to\r\nthe Convention.\r\nThe European Union will spare no effort to\r\npromote the universal and full implementation of the\r\nMine Ban Convention. As of today, 141 States have\r\nratified or acceded to the Convention, and an additional\r\n9 States have signed but not yet ratified.\r\nIn the framework of the Convention on\r\nProhibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain\r\nConventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be\r\nExcessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate\r\nEffects, the European Union will continue to support\r\nthe adoption of legally binding instruments on\r\nexplosive remnants of war and on mines other than\r\nanti-personnel mines.\r\nThe negative humanitarian impact of landmines\r\non the social and economic fabric of several countries\r\nworldwide has been substantially reduced over recent\r\nyears. Nonetheless, the ongoing widespread suffering\r\nof many innocent people clearly shows that we have no\r\nreason to be fully satisfied. Therefore, the European\r\nUnion — which remains in the forefront of assistance\r\nfor mine action — is ready to join its efforts with those\r\nof the rest of the international community in the\r\ncommon endeavour to free the world from the scourge\r\nof anti-personnel landmines and unexploded ordnance\r\nand of their indiscriminate effects.\r\nMr. Duclos (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): In recent\r\nyears, we have noted with satisfaction the development\r\nof a true international political will to eradicate anti-\r\npersonnel landmines — damaging, insidious and\r\nindiscriminate weapons whose use has ethical\r\ndimensions both for States and for civil society as a\r\nwhole. The resulting effort, imagination and political\r\ncommitment that has propelled the issue of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines to the top of the multilateral\r\nagenda is an acknowledgement of the fact that the\r\nexistence of these weapons represents an ongoing\r\nviolation of humanitarian law and that their use flies in\r\nthe face of the principles and norms of human rights.\r\nPeru, which has been and remains a stalwart\r\nstandard-bearer in the cause of prohibiting anti-\r\npersonnel landmines, welcomes the report contained in\r\nA/58/260, which provides an overview of the strategies\r\nof the Organization on this issue. The report informs us\r\non the efforts made this past year aimed at increasing\r\ninformation on problems stemming from mine-related\r\nactivities, strengthening the capacity for action of\r\nStates, implementing international norms and seeking\r\nincreased available resources, among other things. My\r\ncountry shares that vision and aspires to continue to\r\nconsider it a political priority, not only at the national\r\nlevel, but also at the regional level.\r\nIn August this year, the regional seminar entitled\r\n“Toward a hemisphere free of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines” was held in Lima under the sponsorship of\r\nthe Governments of Peru and Canada and the\r\nOrganization of American States. That meeting\r\nprovided a valuable opportunity achieve an overall\r\nbalance in anti-personnel mine action in the Americas\r\nand in the goals envisaged for the region in 2004.\r\nThe meeting adopted a Lima Declaration,\r\n“Toward a hemisphere free of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines”, which reaffirms the need to fulfil the goals\r\nof worldwide elimination of landmines and encourages\r\nthe political impetus and the resources necessary to\r\nmaintain regional leadership in that regard.\r\nThose results, including the working groups’\r\nconclusions on items such as awareness-raising on and\r\nassistance to victims in the region, were presented at\r\nthe fifth Review Conference of States Parties to the\r\nOttawa Convention, held in Bangkok, Thailand, last\r\nSeptember.\r\nAnti-personnel landmines as weapons of\r\ndestruction have been used in almost all inter-State\r\nwars or internal conflicts and have claimed thousands\r\nof lives in recent years. Peru, not having been spared\r\nfrom this scourge, has acted on its commitment to the\r\nobjectives and purposes of international instruments,\r\nwhich have been a part of the progress it has made in\r\nthe past year in areas such as the following:\r\nhumanitarian mine clearance activity along its northern\r\nborder, together with mine clearance personnel from\r\nEcuador; and mine clearance around high-tension\r\nelectricity towers in the interior of the country,\r\nresulting in the removal of more than 36,548 mines\r\nfrom 953 towers. At the same time, innovative projects\r\nare being carried out to use technology in humanitarian\r\nmine clearance activities.\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nOther activities include implementation of a\r\nparallel task of education on the dangers of mines,\r\nincluding training, awareness-raising, evaluation and\r\nmonitoring. The educational programme on the dangers\r\nof anti-personnel mines — Sierra Central 2003 — has\r\nbeen carried out in more than 50 communities of\r\nvarious departments of Peru. The Government has also\r\nestablished a Peruvian anti-personnel mine action\r\ncentre, CONTRAMINAS, which is responsible for\r\nproposing State policy on anti-personnel mines.\r\nIn the legal area, which is another strategic\r\nobjective of the United Nations, Peru has drafted a\r\npenal code that prohibits action that contravenes the\r\nspirit of the Ottawa Convention. It has also joined the\r\ncampaign of the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross and other concerned States, aimed at adopting\r\nlegislative measures by States parties to the Ottawa\r\nConvention.\r\nPeru understands that all strategic action against\r\nanti-personnel mines places the individual at its core,\r\nmaking it essential to offer the individual\r\ncomprehensive assistance that includes measures of\r\nprevention, physical and psychological rehabilitation\r\nand economic and social reintegration. My country is\r\ndesigning strategies in this area, which will require\r\ngreater financial and technical assistance from friendly\r\nStates and international organizations to enable it to\r\ndeal with this vital aspect of the issue of anti-personnel\r\nmines.\r\nMy country hopes to continue to make progress\r\ntowards achieving the ultimate objective of the full\r\nelimination of anti-personnel landmines, through a new\r\nform of global coexistence based on the\r\nacknowledgement of shared larger interests. That is all\r\nthe more urgent since these weapons continue to be the\r\ndirect source of death, mutilation and threats to the\r\nlives of thousands of innocent civilians.\r\nMr. Løvald (Norway): Anti-personnel landmines\r\nremain a serious cause of human suffering in many\r\nparts of the world. Since the entry into force of the\r\nMine Ban Convention four and a half years ago, much\r\nhas been achieved to relieve this suffering, but much\r\nstill remains to be done.\r\nNorway believes that, in order to properly address\r\nthe problems caused by anti-personnel mines, the\r\nfollowing principles are important. Sensible resource\r\nutilization requires that States be committed to the\r\nobligations of the Mine Ban Convention. National\r\nownership of mine action and mine victim assistance is\r\ncrucial. Mine-affected countries must assess their own\r\nneeds and define their own priorities. Sharing of\r\nknowledge and experience among mine-affected\r\ncountries constitutes a resource in itself and should be\r\nfurther enhanced.\r\nTo make better use of resources, mine action\r\nneeds to be coordinated at the country level.\r\nCooperation between national and local authorities,\r\nfield operators and donors should be enhanced. In order\r\nto make mine action sustainable and effective, the\r\nprimary responsibility needs to be with the mine-\r\naffected countries themselves.\r\nMine action should be further integrated into the\r\nbroader development agenda. In mine-affected areas,\r\nmine action must be an integral part of efforts towards\r\npoverty reduction and sustainable development.\r\nFor Norway, the Mine Ban Convention is the\r\nprimary framework for mine action. The Convention\r\ncontains provisions not only for a total ban on anti-\r\npersonnel mines, but also on international cooperation\r\nand assistance in mine action. The intersessional work\r\nprogramme of the Convention constitutes an important\r\narena for discussions related to mine action. Within\r\nthat framework, Norway is coordinating the work of a\r\nResource Mobilization Contact Group, which aims at\r\npromoting adequate funding for mine action and, in\r\nparticular, the best possible utilization of resources\r\navailable for mine action. These discussions take place\r\nbetween all actors involved — mine-affected States,\r\nother States, the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross, various non-governmental organizations and\r\noperators in the field, as well as regional organizations\r\nand, of course, the United Nations system.\r\nClearly, the United Nations has a role to play in\r\nmine action. The implementing agencies of the United\r\nNations should continue to include mine action in their\r\nregular activities when that is relevant. For example,\r\nboth the United Nations Development Programme and\r\nthe United Nations Children’s Fund have demonstrated\r\nthat that is possible when relevant mine action should\r\nbe part of the United Nations consolidated appeals and\r\nUNDP needs assessments. In that respect, the most\r\nimportant task of United Nations Mine Action Service\r\nis to support the necessary coordination within the\r\nUnited Nations system and to ensure that mine action is\r\npart of United Nations discussions and strategies where\r\nrelevant.\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nThe best possible utilization of resources\r\navailable for mine action can only be achieved if\r\nefforts are properly coordinated at the field level. This\r\nis why we attach crucial importance to national\r\nownership of mine action programmes.\r\nMs. Knowles (Australia): As a strong supporter\r\nof the Mine Ban Treaty, Australia is pleased to note the\r\nrecent accession of Belarus, Serbia and Montenegro,\r\nTimor-Leste and Turkey to the Treaty, and ratification\r\nby Burundi, Ghana, Greece, Lithuania and Sudan. We\r\nwelcome the significant show of support for the Mine\r\nBan Treaty and its goals, and we look forward to the\r\nstrong involvement of these countries in mine action\r\nissues in the future.\r\nUniversalization of the Convention is a primary\r\ngoal for the Australian Government. We will continue\r\nto work closely with other States parties to encourage\r\nStates not parties to the Convention to take steps\r\ntowards accession.\r\nAustralia recognizes that many non-signatory\r\ncountries have practical resource pressures and\r\ncompeting priorities. In that regard, we are pleased to\r\nnote in the Landmine Monitor report that donor\r\nfunding towards mine action has increased by more\r\nthan 30 per cent in the past year. We must all continue\r\nto look for ways to provide support to those countries\r\nthat wish to become party to the Convention.\r\nWe welcome the good progress that has been\r\nmade in stockpile destruction in the past year, with 18\r\ncountries reporting the completion of the destruction of\r\ntheir stockpiles of anti-personnel landmines. The\r\ndiminishing stockpiles are concrete steps towards\r\nreducing the potential use of mines in times of conflict\r\nand unrest.\r\nWith A$88 million expended on mine action\r\nactivities since January 1996, the Australian\r\nGovernment expects to fully meet its pledge of A$100\r\nmillion for mine action activities by December 2005.\r\nAustralia’s mine action assistance has focused on\r\nbuilding indigenous capacity for mine clearance,\r\nassisting landmine victims and promoting mine\r\nawareness.\r\nConsistent with the overall priorities of\r\nAustralia’s aid programme, the majority of Australia’s\r\nhumanitarian mine clearance activity is focused on\r\ncountries in our region, many of which suffer the\r\nhighest burden of mines and unexploded ordnance in\r\nthe world. For example, in 2002 and 2003, we provided\r\nmore than A$5 million to mine action programmes in\r\nCambodia alone, focusing on demining, mine risk\r\neducation, victim assistance and integrated\r\nprogrammes.\r\nHowever, we have not focused solely on our\r\nregion. Australia announced in May 2003 a\r\ncontribution of A$1.5 million to demining activities in\r\nIraq through the United Nations Mine Action Service\r\n(UNMAS). Of that amount, A$1.2 million has enabled\r\nUNMAS to undertake a rapid assessment of mine and\r\nunexploded ordnance hazards, while A$300,000 will\r\npermit the placement of an Australian mine clearance\r\nexpert with the mine action coordination team.\r\nAustralia has also contributed A$2.5 million to\r\nUNMAS in Afghanistan in 2003.\r\nThose country-specific contributions to UNMAS,\r\nalong with our core contributions, are an\r\nacknowledgement of the significant role of UNMAS\r\nglobally and, more specifically, of the effective\r\nassessment, coordination and resource mobilization\r\nfunction they have performed in Iraq and in\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nAs I have demonstrated, Australia remains firmly\r\ncommitted to the goal of a comprehensive and lasting\r\nsolution to the global landmines problem. As co-Chair\r\nof the Standing Committee on Victim Assistance and\r\nSocio-Economic Reintegration, Australia will seek to\r\npromote awareness and encourage support for activities\r\nthat address victim needs. In addition, we shall\r\ncontinue to support international action to halt the use\r\nof landmines through promoting universalization and\r\neffective implementation of the Treaty.\r\nThe collective efforts of Governments and civil\r\nsociety have brought us a long way. Australia is proud\r\nto be playing a significant role in this important area of\r\nhumanitarian concern.\r\nMr. Heig (Switzerland) (spoke in French): The\r\nentry into force of legal instruments such as the Ottawa\r\nConvention and the 1980 Convention on Certain\r\nConventional Weapons has enabled us to make\r\nsignificant progress in protecting civil populations in\r\nconflict areas. Thanks to the measures adopted, the\r\nnumber of accidents and that of accident victims have\r\ndecreased. However, significant efforts are still\r\nnecessary. We must redouble our commitment to\r\nuniversalizing the ban on the use, stockpiling,\r\nproduction and transfer of anti-personnel mines and to\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\ntheir destruction. More particularly, we must urge those\r\nStates that have not yet done so to accede to the\r\nrelevant conventions and their protocols as soon as\r\npossible. Only the joint efforts of international\r\norganizations, Governments and civil society, as well\r\nas those of non-governmental organizations, experts\r\nand directly affected populations, will enable us to\r\neradicate the problem of mines and unexploded\r\nordnance.\r\nSwitzerland believes that the United Nations\r\nMine Action Service (UNMAS) has an important role.\r\nIt must shoulder a core responsibility in coordinating\r\nand defining policies and in public relations activities.\r\nIts action supplements the significant contributions to\r\nanti-mine action made by other United Nations\r\nprogrammes and agencies such as the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund and the World Health Organization.\r\nThe terrible attacks in Baghdad against the United\r\nNations and the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross remind us in the most tragic way of how difficult\r\nthat task can be. In that context, Switzerland would like\r\nto reaffirm its full support for the efforts led by\r\nUNMAS and other United Nations agencies to rid the\r\nworld of anti-personnel mines.\r\nThe universalization of treaties is a key element\r\nof our efforts to attain the objective of a world\r\nliberated from the scourge of anti-personnel mines.\r\nSince the Ottawa Convention’s entry into force, States\r\nparties have realized that the success of such efforts\r\nand the implementation of the Convention involve\r\ntaking all factors into account, including the use of\r\nmines by non-State actors. Switzerland believes it is\r\nhigh time for serious and in-depth analysis and\r\ndiscussion of that issue. Given the subject’s\r\ncomplexity, Switzerland intends to create in the coming\r\nmonths an informal open-ended group to consider the\r\nquestion of non-State actors. We invite all interested\r\nStates to participate constructively in that process.\r\nMines kill and mutilate; they cause unspeakable\r\nsuffering. Moreover, they hamper reconstruction and\r\nthe returning of land to cultivation, and they\r\ncomplicate the task of peace missions. And this\r\nscourge particularly affects the poorest countries,\r\nwhich are not in a position to fully clear their lands of\r\nmines without external aid. That is why Switzerland\r\nwill continue to contribute approximately $10 million\r\nper year to humanitarian mine clearance and to creating\r\nanti-mine action capacities at the national or local\r\nlevel.\r\nThe mine clearance and prevention projects\r\nfinanced by Switzerland are closely coordinated with\r\nthe relevant peace-building, humanitarian aid and\r\ndevelopment aid activities of our country. Switzerland\r\nis making available to United Nations mine clearance\r\nprogrammes and various non-governmental\r\norganizations logistics and information technology\r\nexperts as well as project leaders and experts.\r\nFurthermore, Switzerland supplies material assistance\r\nand technical expertise, in particular for the destruction\r\nof booby traps and mines. Switzerland will step up its\r\ndemining efforts during 2004 in the countries where it\r\nis already active. We will emphasize in particular the\r\nrelationship between development and efforts to\r\neradicate landmines and unexploded war ordnance.\r\nProviding assistance to victims and reintegrating\r\nthem into society have been, and will continue to be,\r\npriority obligations. My country has always believed\r\nthat such assistance should be provided through an\r\nintegrated approach that makes the best possible use of\r\nsynergies. More specifically, there is a convergence of\r\ninterests and objectives between mine-action measures\r\nand those carried out in the wider context of human\r\nsecurity. With regard to mine action efforts, it is\r\nimportant that we take advantage of the work carried\r\nout by the Human Security Network. One of the goals\r\nof this informal Network — which consists of 13\r\ncountries, including Switzerland — is to provide\r\nassistance to victims. It is also active in the fight\r\nagainst AIDS and on the issue of child soldiers. My\r\ncountry will commit itself to ensuring that the issue of\r\nanti-personnel mines remains one of the Network’s\r\npriorities.\r\nGeneva has become the centre of international\r\nmine action. To date, Switzerland has hosted two\r\nmeetings of States parties to the Ottawa Convention, as\r\nwell as several intersessional meetings. I would also\r\nlike to mention the Geneva International Centre for\r\nHumanitarian Demining, which in recent years has\r\nbecome an internationally recognized centre for know-\r\nhow and documentation. Switzerland invites States to\r\ncontinue to make use of Geneva’s infrastructure and to\r\ndraw on the wealth of knowledge located in the city.\r\nAt the heart of banning the use, stockpiling,\r\nproduction and transfer of anti-personnel mines and of\r\nlimiting the use of certain conventional weapons is the\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nhumanitarian belief that innocent civilians should be\r\nprotected from the insidious and uncontrollable danger\r\nposed by those weapons. Even in times of conflict,\r\ncivilians deserve a modicum of human security. But\r\nthat principle, and the activities to which it gives rise,\r\nalso provide us with opportunities that go beyond the\r\npurely humanitarian dimension. Demining projects can\r\nin fact also be used for general peace-building\r\npurposes — for example, by forming mixed mine-\r\nclearing groups from former enemy entities as a means\r\nof promoting reconciliation. Mine clearance campaigns\r\nand working jointly to identify areas to be cleared can\r\nalso help to restore confidence among parties to a\r\nconflict. In the search for a settlement, a demining plan\r\ncan serve as an easily negotiable element that is of\r\ninterest to all parties in a peace process. It is up to us to\r\ncome up with possible ways by which the fight against\r\nlandmines can be made to benefit peace — over and\r\nabove its humanitarian role and its impact on\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe fight against landmines and unexploded war\r\nordnance is a superb example of joint international\r\neffort, which is the only way to improve human\r\nsecurity in the world. It is therefore all the more\r\nimportant not to waver in our efforts.\r\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia) (spoke in French): My\r\ndelegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral contained in document A/58/260, which is\r\nentitled “Assistance in mine action” and which is now\r\nbefore the General Assembly. That report attests to the\r\nremarkable progress that has been achieved with regard\r\nto the six strategic goals set out in the United Nations\r\nmine-action strategy for the period 2001-2005 —\r\nespecially with respect to employing information\r\ntechnology, emergency-response capability,\r\nstrengthening national mine-action capabilities and\r\nmobilizing resources.\r\nMine action is the best response to the\r\ndevastating scourge of mines, which — in addition to\r\ntheir disastrous effects on the human level — also pose\r\nenormous socio-economic consequences to post-\r\nconflict development and to the restoration of normal\r\nsocial conditions. The five elements comprising mine\r\naction are complementary and address the issue in a\r\ncomprehensive manner. Warning people about mines,\r\neducation and raising awareness about the danger\r\nposed by mines are all fundamental steps in that\r\nconnection. Mine clearance — including the detection\r\nof minefields, mapping and marking — is also vital,\r\nand must be a priority in the environs adjacent to\r\npopulated areas. Providing assistance to victims,\r\nespecially in helping to reintegrate them into society, is\r\nalso an important component of mine action requiring\r\nsupport.\r\nAll of those efforts should be carried out while\r\npromoting the destruction of stocks of anti-personnel\r\nmines. In that regard, my delegation recognizes the\r\nvital role played by the Mine Action Service in\r\nfocusing mine action within the United Nations system,\r\nespecially with regard to coordination, devising\r\npolicies in order to take action, and evaluating the\r\nthreat posed by this scourge in numerous countries. We\r\nalso duly appreciate the roles played by the United\r\nNations Development Programme, UNICEF and other\r\nUnited Nations bodies and non-governmental\r\norganizations active in mine action.\r\nTunisia reaffirms its commitment to the\r\nimplementation of the Convention on the Prohibition of\r\nthe Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\r\npersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction. My country\r\nwas one of the first to sign the Convention and to begin\r\nto implement its provisions well before they entered\r\ninto force. We are determined to continue to comply\r\nwith our obligations in that regard.\r\nTunisia is also determined to pursue efforts, along\r\nwith all other States, to completely eliminate anti-\r\npersonnel landmines throughout the world. In that\r\nconnection, my country encourages all States to\r\nparticipate actively in the Mine Ban Convention’s\r\nintersessional mechanism in Geneva. My delegation\r\nwelcomes the ever growing number of States to\r\nbecome parties to the Convention, which today number\r\n141. The fifth Meeting of States Parties, which took\r\nplace in Bangkok from 15 to 19 September 2003, was\r\nan opportunity once again to reaffirm the commitment\r\nof all States parties to eradicate these cruel weapons as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\nMy country continues to suffer from the\r\naftermath of the Second World War, part of which took\r\nplace on Tunisian soil. Some of our territory is still\r\ninfested by unexploded ordnance and anti-personnel\r\nlandmines that are so deeply buried that they do not\r\nlend themselves to conventional detection methods. In\r\nthat regard, an inter-agency, multisectoral mission took\r\nplace in Tunisia from 20 to 24 January 2003 at the\r\nrequest of the Government in order to evaluate the\r\nnature and scope of the problem of landmines and\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nunexploded ordnance. The exercise made it possible to\r\nidentify the obstacles that must be overcome and to\r\nmake recommendations about possible steps to be\r\ntaken in this area.\r\nOn 4 September 2003, Tunisia completed the\r\ndestruction of its stocks of anti-personnel mines held\r\nby the national army. It did so in compliance with\r\narticle 4 of the Ottawa Convention, and in advance of\r\nthe 10 January 2004 date set for our country by the\r\nConvention. During that operation, at which the United\r\nNations Resident Coordinator in Tunis, the Secretary\r\nGeneral of the Tunisian Red Cross and representatives\r\nof the national media were present, 2,331 anti-\r\npersonnel landmines were destroyed, bringing the total\r\nnumber of stockpiled mines destroyed to 17,575. It is\r\nimportant also to note that Tunisia has already\r\ntransmitted its national report as well as annual updates\r\nto the United Nations Secretary-General, in conformity\r\nwith the transparency measures provided under article\r\n7 of the Convention.\r\nFinally, in the context of Tunisia’s commitment to\r\nthe application of all the provisions of the Mine Ban\r\nConvention, a national committee to follow up the\r\nimplementation of the Convention has been set up that\r\nincludes representatives from the principal Tunisian\r\nministries concerned.\r\nAllow me to conclude by paying tribute to all\r\nthose who are involved, in one manner or another, in\r\nthe fight against the scourge of anti-personnel mines\r\nand who are working with the Governments of States\r\nMembers of the United Nations and with international\r\nand non-governmental organizations, for their courage\r\nand for the sacrifices they have made in the service of\r\nthis lofty cause. They all deserve the support of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Karanja (Kenya): I am pleased to take the\r\nfloor to make some remarks on item 22 of our agenda,\r\nentitled “Question of assistance in mine action”.\r\nMy delegation has taken note of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on assistance in mine action. The\r\nreport brings to light several important initiatives and\r\nsteps already undertaken in that domain under the six\r\nstrategic objectives.\r\nOne of the objectives is the gathering of\r\ninformation or data on all aspects of the mine problem\r\nin various countries. The web-based databank and the\r\nInformation Management System for Mine Action\r\nresulting from this effort are commendable. They are a\r\nrich source of information on global resources\r\navailable for mine action. We encourage mine-affected\r\ncountries and mine-action partners alike fully to exploit\r\nthat system.\r\nAnother vital area addressed by the report is that\r\nof developing indigenous capacity. The availability of\r\nadequate local skilled personnel is a key factor in the\r\nsustainable success of any project. That step is thus\r\nlaudable. Equally promising is the endeavour to build\r\npartnerships with other development agencies, as is the\r\ncase between the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) and the World Bank in some\r\ncountries. We hope that this initiative has now been\r\nextended to more countries and agencies, as had been\r\nintended.\r\nThe availability of adequate funds is a sine qua\r\nnon for mine action. We note with appreciation that,\r\nbetween 2001 and 2002, donor countries and other\r\npartners contributed some $28 million, which was used\r\nin 16 mine-affected countries. This amount has,\r\nhowever, not been adequate for the envisaged\r\nactivities. It is hence crucial for the United Nations\r\nMine Action Services to attract adequate resources and\r\nto ensure their rational utilization. We hope that\r\nassistance will continue to be extended in a transparent\r\nand balanced manner and in accordance with the\r\nrespective needs of mine-affected countries.\r\nOverall, the objectives and sub-objectives of the\r\nUnited Nations mine action strategy are numerous and\r\nextensive. It is therefore important to guard against\r\noverlapping or duplication in the process of pursuing\r\nthe goals that have been set. Given that implementation\r\nof the objectives has been going on for some time now,\r\nit might be useful to review or refine them in light of\r\nexperience gained. For instance, greater emphasis\r\ncould be placed on selected activities targeted at, or\r\nlimited to, immediate or urgent issues, such as rapid\r\nresponse, development of local capacity and\r\nmobilization of resources.\r\nThe question of assistance in mine action is a\r\ncrucial aspect of the whole issue of anti-personnel\r\nmines, as underlined in article VI of the Convention on\r\nthe Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction.\r\nAssistance is indispensable, especially in areas\r\nmost directly linked to the core humanitarian\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nobjectives of the Convention. These are: the\r\ndestruction of existing stockpiles of mines, clearing\r\nmined areas, helping landmine survivors, and\r\npromoting the universal acceptance of the Mine Ban\r\nConvention.\r\nDemining and providing assistance to landmine\r\nsurvivors are probably the most challenging of the\r\nhumanitarian dimensions of the Convention. Clearing\r\nmines has proved to be a most tedious and costly affair.\r\nOngoing demining work is thus proceeding at a snail’s\r\npace in most mine-affected countries. At that rate,\r\ndemining will continue for many more years —\r\nperhaps for generations to come. For those countries —\r\nmost of which are poor — this will mean, among other\r\nthings, continued denial of access to large tracts of\r\nland, an indispensable resource for national\r\ndevelopment. Slow demining, in turn, inevitably means\r\nmore casualties and leads to situations in which\r\nsurvivors must fend for themselves, thus increasing\r\ndependency.\r\nVarious countries and organizations have\r\nregularly provided assistance to demining efforts all\r\nover the world. They have donated, inter alia,\r\nequipment, sponsored training of deminers, and\r\nparticipation of representatives from mine-affected\r\ncountries in activities of the Convention. We therefore\r\ncommend all countries which have actively provided\r\nassistance for mine action.\r\nIn the same breath, it is important to emphasize\r\nthat the current level of assistance is inadequate. It is\r\nimperative that those countries which are able but are\r\nnot yet doing so urgently make their contribution.\r\nThose already providing assistance should consider\r\nincreasing their contribution. It is important for all\r\ncontributors to also engage in closer dialogue with\r\nmine-affected countries and to involve the United\r\nNations as well as other relevant major international\r\norganizations in their mine-action projects. Such\r\ncooperation would help ensure that resources are\r\ndeployed in an optimal manner.\r\nThe Mine Ban Convention is approaching a\r\ncrossroads in its implementation. Its first Review\r\nConference will be held from 29 October to 3\r\nDecember 2004 in Nairobi, Kenya. My delegation\r\nattaches considerable importance to this Conference as\r\nit will enable us to review our achievements, assess\r\nwhere we stand vis-à-vis the requirements of the\r\nConvention, and chart the way forward. We thank all\r\nthose delegations that have already emphasized their\r\ncommitment to ensuring a successful 2004 Review\r\nConference in Nairobi, and invite all States and\r\norganizations to participate at the highest possible\r\nlevel.\r\nThe African region has some of the most mine-\r\naffected countries in the world. Left on their own, these\r\ncountries are unlikely to live up to their obligations,\r\nnotably, completion of mine clearance within the\r\ndeadlines set by the Convention, in addition to\r\nextending adequate care to landmine survivors. Their\r\nefforts will have to be supplemented in this regard. The\r\nquestion of assistance in mine action should, therefore,\r\nbe substantively addressed at the Review Conference.\r\nThe conclusions or outcome of the Conference should\r\ninclude a clear strategy on an enhanced framework for\r\nassistance to mine-affected countries. For its part, the\r\nUnited Nations could review its strategic objectives in\r\nmine action operations within the context of the\r\nforthcoming Review Conference.\r\nMr. Kryzhanivsky (Ukraine): Allow me to begin\r\nby paying tribute to all those involved in combating\r\nanti-personnel landmines and unexploded ordnance\r\naround the world, in particular, to commend the\r\nrelentless efforts by the Standing Committees and\r\nStates parties to the Ottawa Convention, the United\r\nNations Mine Action Service and all relevant United\r\nNations agencies, institutions and organizations united\r\nin their common cause to decrease human suffering and\r\nincrease human security.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report in document\r\nA/58/260 constitutes an important element towards a\r\nmore systematic and coordinated approach to\r\ninternational assistance in mine action. Ukraine\r\nacknowledges the progress described in the report and\r\nwelcomes the revised United Nations mine action\r\nstrategy for 2001-2005 proposed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nThe readiness by the United Nations to\r\nimplement suggestions by Member States regarding\r\ncoordination, integration and prioritization, scope of\r\nmine action, political commitment and information\r\nsharing is particularly praiseworthy. The progress in\r\nimplementation of strategy objectives includes\r\nsubstantial improvements in information management,\r\nfinalization of a rapid response plan, development of\r\nnational mine action plans, implementation of surveys\r\nand steps towards improved institutional coordination\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nand integration of mine action into overall assistance\r\nand development schemes. We call for the continuation\r\nof the efforts of the United Nations to foster the\r\nestablishment of mine action capacities in those\r\ncountries where unexploded ordnance and stockpiles\r\nconstitute a serious threat to the safety, health and lives\r\nof the local population. This is of significant\r\nimportance for Ukraine.\r\nUkraine recognizes the key role of the United\r\nNations Mine Action Service, especially in the fields of\r\npolicy-making, coordination and advocacy.\r\nFrom our perspective it is important at this stage\r\nthat national mine action strategies are set up with a\r\nview to ensuring effective decision-making about\r\nshort-, medium- and long-term priorities. National and\r\ninternational support for mine action must be\r\nsustainable and must encourage and support national\r\ninitiatives and institutions. The needs of the mine-\r\naffected community must set the basic parameters for\r\nassistance in mine action. At the same time the allure\r\nof operational mine clearance should not deflect\r\nattention from other aspects of mine action, such as\r\nvictim assistance.\r\nWhile important progress has been made in mine\r\naction during the past years, the number of countries\r\nand areas that require and request assistance also\r\ncontinues to increase. The need to obtain adequate\r\nresources remains a constant challenge for the United\r\nNations. Therefore, the timely mobilization of\r\nresources from donors is essential to the success of\r\nmine action programmes.\r\nUkraine is convinced that the prohibition of\r\nproduction, use, stockpiling and transfer of anti-\r\npersonnel mines should become the ultimate goal of the\r\ninternational community. At the same time we are\r\nconfident that this goal should be pursued gradually\r\nwhile ensuring the largest possible participation of\r\nStates in Protocol II of the Convention on Certain\r\nConventional Weapons of 1980.\r\nIt is not by from secondary sources that Ukraine\r\nknows the problems and sufferings resulting from the\r\nuncontrolled use of mines. Despite the fact that more\r\nthan a half century has passed since the end of the\r\nSecond World War, every year our specialists\r\nneutralize tens of thousands of pieces of ammunition\r\nand unexploded ordnance.\r\nOn 27 May this year, Ukraine completed the first\r\nsignificant destruction project, which allowed us to\r\ndestroy 400,000 anti-personnel landmines of various\r\ntypes. We commit ourselves to continue the destruction\r\nprocess to get rid of Ukraine’s six million landmines in\r\nstockpiles. In this regard, we deeply appreciate the\r\ncommitment and the generosity demonstrated by\r\nCanada, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union,\r\nas well as by numerous organizations inside and\r\noutside the United Nations system, to assist us with the\r\nimplementation of the Ottawa Convention obligations.\r\nUkraine will continue its support for a universalization\r\nof the Ottawa Convention, and the work relating to\r\nProtocol II of the Convention on Certain Conventional\r\nWeapons. To date the preparatory activities for the\r\nratification of the Ottawa Convention have been under\r\nway in my country. We also continue actively to work\r\non the establishment of a national mine action centre.\r\nMine action is one of the priorities of Ukraine’s\r\npeace and security policies. We acknowledge that\r\nresponsibility for addressing the problem of landmines\r\nand unexploded ordnance rests with the authorities of\r\nmine-affected countries. But we believe also that when\r\nnational resources are lacking, the suffering caused by\r\nanti-personnel landmines and unexploded ordnance\r\nneeds to be addressed within a humanitarian and\r\ndevelopment framework. We are convinced that the\r\nUnited Nations can and should play an important role\r\nin both.\r\nDespite the difficulties we experience, Ukraine\r\nhas extensive experience in modern mine clearance\r\ntechnologies, and its advanced logistics base allows for\r\nthe training of highly skilled specialists within a short\r\nperiod of time. Ukrainian mine clearance engineers are\r\nwidely recognized in various regions of the world,\r\nincluding the former Yugoslavia, Angola, Sierra Leone\r\nand Lebanon. Ukrainian units operate under United\r\nNations standards and operational procedures and we\r\nare ready to provide technical support to and share our\r\nexperience with United Nations missions in various\r\ncountries. Ukraine’s participation in demining\r\nactivities is a demonstration of our commitment to\r\ninternational obligations in the field of anti-personnel\r\nmines.\r\nIn closing, I should like to emphasize that\r\ntremendous humanitarian and development problems\r\ncaused by the presence of mines and other unexploded\r\nordnance continue to constitute an obstacle to the\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\ndevelopment of many States and have serious and\r\nlasting social and economic consequences, first of all,\r\nfor their populations. From this rostrum, I reaffirm my\r\ncountry’s firm resolve to cooperate with United\r\nNations assistance programmes to eliminate mines and\r\nunexploded ordnance in Ukraine and throughout the\r\nworld and call upon all Member States to assist mine-\r\naffected countries in developing relevant national\r\nprogrammes in accordance with the provisions of the\r\nOttawa Convention.\r\nMr. Ozawa (Japan): Japan attaches great\r\nimportance to mine-action assistance and continues to\r\nplay an active role in this field. We believe that in\r\nmany post-conflict situations, addressing the landmine\r\nproblem is a precondition for consolidating peace and\r\ncommencing with reconstruction. Our recently revised\r\nOfficial Development Assistance Charter gives priority\r\nto mine-related assistance, as this enhances the\r\nnecessary stability and security of local communities in\r\npost-conflict situations.\r\nWith regard to the conceptual framework of\r\nhuman security, it goes without saying that mine action\r\npromotes human security. Furthermore, the\r\nGovernment of Japan is working actively, together with\r\ncivil society and the international community, to\r\nachieve the objectives of the Zero Victims Initiative.\r\nAs a dedicated actor and contributor in the field\r\nof mine-action assistance, the Government of Japan is\r\nencouraged by the recent report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/58/260), which focused on the progress\r\nachieved in implementing the strategic goals and\r\nrelated objectives enumerated in the United Nations\r\nmine-action strategy. Progress in information\r\ntechnology and resource mobilization is particularly\r\nappreciated, as the Government of Japan has\r\nemphasized on several occasions that a more\r\nsystematic approach is desirable in order for mine-\r\naction activities to be conducted as effectively and\r\nefficiently as possible.\r\nMuch remains to be done and we need to strive\r\nfurther to achieve our goal of zero victims, but the\r\nprogress achieved to date gives us hope and\r\nconfidence. We are assured that the revised strategy\r\nwill again serve as valuable guidance for the United\r\nNations entities involved in this field and will further\r\nfoster coordination and accountability throughout the\r\nmine-action community.\r\nJapan has provided assistance to more than 25\r\naffected countries and areas to enable them to carry out\r\nmine-action activities, including mine clearance, victim\r\nassistance, and mine-awareness training and education.\r\nMy Government fulfilled its pledge for financial\r\nassistance totalling 10 billion yen, roughly $90 million,\r\nin the five years following 1998, reaching the target\r\nfigure by the end of last October. I am also pleased to\r\nnote that as of October of this year, Japan’s total\r\ncontribution to the Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance\r\nin Mine Action, managed by the United Nations Mine\r\nAction Service, stood at about $23.7 million, which is\r\none of the largest sums contributed by any donor.\r\nIn addition to financial contributions and\r\ntraditional types of assistance for mine-clearance\r\nactivities, the Government of Japan recently took the\r\ninitiative of applying Japan’s technological expertise to\r\nthe development of more advanced and efficient\r\nequipment for the detection and clearance of mines, in\r\ncooperation with private companies and researchers,\r\ntaking into account the advice and opinions of\r\ndeminers in the field. We expect that these new\r\ntechnologies will enhance the good work being done in\r\nthe field.\r\nVictim assistance and mine awareness are also\r\nimportant. We are making efforts to prevent any\r\nincrease in the number of landmine victims and to\r\nprovide assistance to those already victimized. It is also\r\nnoteworthy that non-governmental organizations have\r\nbeen making a substantial contribution to a range of\r\nmine-action activities. The Government of Japan will\r\nstrive to increase the effectiveness of its assistance to\r\nmine action by strengthening dialogue and coordination\r\nwith non-governmental organizations, as well as by\r\nsupporting their work through grants and subsidies.\r\nLet me share with you some information and\r\nsome of our concrete efforts and ideas regarding\r\nassistance for mine action. With regard to assistance to\r\nSouth-East Asia, which accounts for 38 per cent of our\r\ntotal mine-action aid, the Government of Japan is\r\ncurrently consulting with the Geneva International\r\nCentre for Humanitarian Demining on the\r\nestablishment of a regional support centre for the\r\nInformation Management System for Mine Action. We\r\nhope this initiative will facilitate development and\r\nimprovement in information management regarding\r\nmine action in South-East Asia.\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nWe are also strongly committed to mine-related\r\nassistance in Afghanistan. Japan has contributed over\r\n$50 million to aid mine-action activities in that\r\ncountry, a sum that includes grants to a mine-clearance\r\nprogramme carried out as part of the Afghan New\r\nBeginnings Programme for the employment of\r\ndemobilized ex-combatants. Japan will continue to\r\nsupport the efforts of Afghanistan to consolidate peace\r\nand enhance nation-building in cooperation with\r\nUnited Nations missions and other donors.\r\nJapan’s contribution to mine action extends to\r\nAfrican countries including Angola, Mozambique,\r\nSudan, Zambia, Rwanda, Chad, Ethiopia and Eritrea.\r\nWe sincerely hope that our assistance will contribute to\r\nrealizing peace and security, which are prerequisites for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nRegarding the situation in Iraq, we are concerned\r\nabout the threat of mines and unexploded ordnance in\r\nthat country, especially since United Nations assisted\r\noperations were largely suspended due to security\r\nconstraints. The Government of Japan is exploring the\r\npossibility of supporting programmes related to mine\r\nrisk education, mine awareness campaigns, and a mine\r\nand unexploded ordnance survey through the Voluntary\r\nTrust Fund for Assistance in Mine Action of the United\r\nNations Mine Action Service.\r\nI would like to conclude my statement by\r\nreaffirming the determination of the Government of\r\nJapan to continue its endeavours, in collaboration with\r\nother stakeholders in this field, towards overcoming\r\nlandmine problems on a global scale and thus making\r\nour world a safer place for us all.\r\nMr. Shore (Canada): As we approach the fifth\r\nanniversary of the Ottawa Convention’s entry into\r\nforce, it remains from Canada’s perspective the\r\ndefinitive international framework for ensuring that the\r\nhuman tragedy caused by anti-personnel landmines is\r\ntruly and permanently addressed. It also represents a\r\nremarkable success and a model of what Governments,\r\ncivil society and multilateral institutions can achieve\r\nwhen they work together towards a common cause.\r\nThe role of the United Nations in mine action\r\nremains absolutely central. Canada applauds and\r\nsupports the activities of the United Nations Mine\r\nAction Service (UNMAS) in its important coordinating\r\nrole and in assessing the threat of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines throughout the world. We thank the United\r\nNations Department for Disarmament Affairs for its\r\nwork in support of the Ottawa Convention’s meetings\r\nof States Parties and in ensuring the effective\r\ndissemination of reports submitted under article 7 of\r\nthe Convention.\r\nWe extend our appreciation to the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) for its commitment\r\nto develop long-term capacity to manage and\r\nimplement mine action programmes and we thank the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for its\r\nspirited promotion and delivery of mine risk education.\r\nWe also acknowledge and appreciate the important role\r\nplayed by other United Nations agencies in efforts to\r\novercome the insidious effects of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines.\r\nOur success in advancing the Convention’s core\r\nhumanitarian objectives is clear. The number of States\r\nusing or producing anti-personnel mines continues to\r\ndecrease, global trade has essentially ceased and\r\nstockpiles are being progressively eliminated by the\r\nmillions. Support for the Convention, which now\r\nincludes 141 States, continues to grow at a steady pace.\r\nConsiderable resources are being deployed to clear\r\nmore valuable land and assist victims in a larger\r\nnumber of countries. Most importantly, of course,\r\ncasualty rates continue in an overall downward trend.\r\nBut clearly the job is not yet done. There are still\r\nsome 200 million mines stockpiled globally, 15 States\r\nare still listed as producers of these weapons, four\r\nUnited Nations Member States openly acknowledged\r\nusing anti-personnel mines last year, the development\r\nof countless communities is restricted by mines that\r\nremain in the ground in over 80 countries and between\r\n15,000 and 20,000 people still fall victim to these\r\nindiscriminate weapons every year, the majority of\r\nwhich, of course, are civilians.\r\nSo the urgent need to address this humanitarian\r\nimperative remains. As we seek new and innovative\r\nways to promote a broader understanding and\r\nacceptance of international mine action norms, we must\r\nfocus our attention on securing an ever increasing —\r\nand ultimately universal — acceptance of our common\r\ngoals. The United Nations has always been an essential\r\npartner in this regard and will no doubt continue to\r\nplay a central role as we collectively face the\r\nsignificant challenges that remain.\r\nA very concrete step in this regard was the\r\nSecretary-General’s recent review this past summer of\r\nthe United Nations mine action strategy for 2001-2005.\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nWhile the strategy achieved a number of measurable\r\nsuccesses in its first two years, this review takes into\r\naccount new challenges that have emerged, reflects\r\nnew priorities and establishes new timetables. Canada\r\nis therefore very pleased that the United Nations\r\ncontinues to place a priority on the global eradication\r\nof anti-personnel mines and is fully supportive of this\r\nendeavour.\r\nCanada is also committed to meeting its article 6\r\nobligations in support of the universalization and\r\nimplementation of the Ottawa Convention. This\r\ncommitment was affirmed in concrete terms last winter,\r\nwhen Prime Minister Chrétien announced the decision\r\nto renew the Canadian Landmine Fund for an\r\nadditional five years, beginning in 2003, which will\r\neventually lead to the integration of mine action\r\nprogramming into core departmental budgets, in\r\nparticular, our development budget. This will ensure\r\nthat the humanitarian objectives of the Convention are\r\nachieved, and that its sustainability over the longer\r\nterm is assured.\r\nWe also support the view vigorously advanced by\r\nthe United Nations that mine action in severely mine-\r\naffected developing countries is a fundamental\r\nprecondition for sustainable development and we were,\r\ntherefore, pleased to see it included in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s review of the United Nations mine action\r\nstrategy. It is clear that the presence of these weapons\r\nin many situations presents a major obstacle to post-\r\nconflict recovery, peace and security. We support\r\nUnited Nations efforts in this regard and agree that\r\nmine action must be an integral component of national\r\ndevelopment priorities and poverty reduction strategies\r\nfor mine-affected States. We also strongly urge the\r\ninternational development community to respond\r\npositively to requests from developing countries when\r\nmine action is put forward in these terms.\r\nFinally, in the same vein, Canada believes it is\r\ncrucial for the United Nations and its Member States to\r\nacknowledge the critical role mine action has to play in\r\nadvancing the Organization’s broader purposes of\r\npeace, security and development throughout the world.\r\nOne way in which this reality could be given concrete\r\nrecognition is through the dedication of a more\r\nappropriate share of regular budget resources to core\r\nmine action operations such as those of UNMAS,\r\nUNDP and UNICEF.\r\nAn essential ingredient in ensuring our collective\r\nsuccess, which is well understood and exemplified by\r\nthis forum, is the spirit of shared responsibility and\r\ngenuine partnership that has characterized the global\r\ncampaign against anti-personnel landmines from the\r\noutset. The first Review Conference of the Ottawa\r\nConvention, which will be held in Nairobi from 29\r\nNovember to 3 December 2004, will serve as a very\r\nprominent example of this major achievement.\r\nFuture progress will clearly require that we\r\nsustain and strengthen these partnerships and, as we\r\nforge new ones, that we coordinate our various\r\ninterests and initiatives into a coherent framework and\r\ncomprehensive action plan in preparation for the\r\nReview Conference. This will ensure that we arrive\r\nwith a detailed understanding of the progress made to\r\ndate and the challenges that remain and that we are\r\nprepared to collectively reaffirm our commitment to\r\nmeeting these challenges head on. The United Nations,\r\nits Member States, regional organizations and, of\r\ncourse, our non-governmental organization partners\r\nwill all be indispensable in this regard.\r\nWe strongly encourage each of these actors to\r\nsend representation from the highest possible level\r\nduring the high-level segment planned for the end of\r\nthe Review Conference, and we encourage Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan to personally attend. His profile,\r\nand that of the other leaders, will send a strong\r\nmessage to the international community and will make\r\na significant difference in energizing our collective\r\nefforts.\r\nFrom Canada’s perspective, it is fitting that the\r\nReview Conference will be held on the most mine-\r\naffected continent on earth, a continent which played a\r\npivotal role in the creation of the Convention and\r\nwhich has done so much to see it implemented across\r\nAfrica. Canada would like to extend our\r\ncongratulations to Kenya for hosting this important\r\nevent, which will also serve to underline the key role\r\nthe United Nations plays in mine action.\r\nFinally, we would also like to pledge our full\r\ncooperation to all those who share our conviction that\r\nthe Review Conference will provide an ideal\r\nopportunity to reaffirm our collective commitment to\r\nfinishing a job in which has achieved so much already.\r\nMr. Lew Kwang-chul (Republic of Korea): At the\r\noutset, I would like to express my appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report on the\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nprogress made on the implementation of the United\r\nNations mine action strategy for 2001-2005.\r\nAs indicated by the Secretary-General’s report\r\ncontained in A/58/260, the six strategic goals and\r\nrelated objectives laid out in the five-year strategy have\r\nprovided an effective framework for steadily achieving\r\nand monitoring progress in the field of mine action.\r\nSince the issue of mine action was adopted as an\r\nagenda item of the General Assembly in 1993, the\r\nefforts of the international community to tackle that\r\nproblem have brought greater public and political\r\nawareness to the issues surrounding landmines. As a\r\nresult, we have seen a decrease in the production and\r\nuse of anti-personnel landmines, a de facto moratorium\r\non the transfer of such weapons, the clearing of many\r\nmined areas and the destruction of millions of\r\nstockpiled landmines. Most importantly, in recent years\r\nthere has been a significant decline in the number of\r\nmine-related casualties.\r\nWhile this progress is laudable, we must not lose\r\nsight of the many formidable tasks that remain before\r\nus. Landmines continue to pose a deadly threat to\r\ninnocent civilians in conflict and post-conflict areas,\r\nnot only claiming lives, but also impeding socio-\r\neconomic development, reconstruction efforts and\r\nhumanitarian aid operations. In response, the five-year\r\nmine-action strategy employs a comprehensive\r\napproach to coordinate progress in mine awareness,\r\nemergency assistance, mine clearance and resource\r\nmobilization, all of which are essential to counter this\r\nthreat. We hope that the strategy will help us to make\r\ngreat progress towards achieving those goals in the\r\ncoming years.\r\nLet me take a few moments to comment on some\r\nof the latest developments in mine action that my\r\ndelegation believes are of particular importance.\r\nFirst, we were particularly pleased to see the\r\nrapid-response framework designed to bolster\r\nemergency response capabilities put into effect in Iraq\r\nin early 2003. We commend the collaborative efforts of\r\nthose United Nations bodies that worked with non-\r\ngovernmental organizations to deploy a mine-action\r\ncoordination team to Iraq. We hope that the work of\r\nthis team will have a positive impact. In the same vein,\r\nthe progress made by the Mine-Action Programme for\r\nAfghanistan has been significant. Not only has the\r\nProgramme doubled in size in response to the\r\nincreasing need for mine-action involvement in\r\nhumanitarian, development and reconstruction\r\ninitiatives, but it has made improvements in its\r\noperating procedures and outreach activities and has\r\ncleared a substantial number of high-priority mine-\r\naffected areas. In addition, my delegation welcomes the\r\nadvances that have been made in mine action in other\r\nafflicted areas of the world, including in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia,\r\nMacedonia, Lebanon and Sudan.\r\nSecondly, recognizing that the comprehensive\r\ncollection and management of information is essential\r\nfor effective mine action, my delegation commends the\r\ncontinued work of the inter-agency and multisectoral\r\nmissions undertaken by the United Nations Mine\r\nAction Service in conjunction with the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund and other agencies to assess the needs\r\nof mine-affected countries. We further welcome the\r\ncontinued development and maintenance of the\r\nE-MINE information network as it becomes the centre\r\nfor mine-related information on the Internet. We were\r\npleased to see the expansion of the site to include 800\r\nnew items and access to a database of individual\r\ncountries progress in destroying their stockpiles of\r\nmines. In that context, my delegation looks forward to\r\nthe further development and utilization of technology\r\nfor the detection, removal and destruction of mines and\r\nunexploded ordnance.\r\nThirdly, as highlighted in the Secretary-General’s\r\nconclusions, efforts to build effective partnerships with\r\ninternational organizations, with a view to integrating\r\ntheir mine-action activities into humanitarian and\r\ndevelopment efforts, are crucial to the success of the\r\nfight to eliminate landmines. Close cooperation among\r\nall stakeholders remains indispensable, not only in\r\ncoordinating activities and sharing best practices, but\r\nalso in mobilizing resources. In that regard, my\r\ndelegation would like to stress the importance of the\r\ncentral coordinating role of the United Nations in\r\ngenerating synergy among diverse actors. In particular,\r\nwe would like to commend the efforts of the United\r\nNations Mine Action Service, which has served as the\r\nfocal point for international mine-action activities.\r\nThe Republic of Korea is committed to the global\r\neffort to protect civilians from the scourge of\r\nlandmines. Since 1997, the Korean Government has\r\nfaithfully enforced an indefinite extension of its\r\nmoratorium on the export of anti-personnel mines. In\r\n2001, my Government acceded to the Convention on\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nCertain Conventional Weapons and its Amended\r\nProtocol II, which became effective on 9 November\r\n2001. Since its accession, my Government has actively\r\nparticipated in the relevant discussions within the\r\nframework of that Convention.\r\nIn closing, the Republic of Korea recognizes that\r\none of the prerequisites for effective action is a\r\nsubstantial resource base, and it has, therefore,\r\nprovided support to various United Nations-led mine\r\nassistance programmes. My Government has made\r\nannual contributions to the Voluntary Trust Fund for\r\nAssistance in Mine Action and remains an active\r\nparticipant in the Mine Action Support Group. We\r\nshare the Secretary-General’s view that the United\r\nNations should secure sound funding to meet the\r\ngrowing requests from mine-affected countries. With\r\nthat in mind, the Korean Government will continue to\r\nmake due contributions to this noble cause.\r\nMr. Assaf (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I would like to express our gratitude and\r\nappreciation to the Secretariat for its reports on this\r\nsubject and for its efforts in affirming the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the fight against mines.\r\nLandmines are a universal human tragedy. They\r\nare discreet killers: the victim comes to the mine, the\r\nmine does not go to the victim. Mines are patient\r\nkillers; they can lie in wait for their victims for\r\ndecades, haunting people even after wars and conflict\r\nare over, threatening the lives of civilians and impeding\r\neconomic and social development.\r\nThe international dimension of the mine scourge\r\nis reflected in a simple statistic: the number of existing\r\nmines is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions;\r\nthey are deployed in some 90 countries and claim the\r\nlives of about 15,000 victims annually, most of them\r\ncivilians.\r\nLebanon is among those States victimized by the\r\npresence of mines. The Israeli occupation left behind a\r\nlarge number of them — some 450,000, according to\r\nUnited Nations estimates. Of these, the Israeli anti-\r\npersonnel mine known as Mine No. 4 makes up 90 per\r\ncent. Today, those mines are deployed along the Blue\r\nLine and the neighbouring villages, from Naqoura in\r\nthe west to Kfarshoba in the east, over an estimated\r\narea of over 100 square kilometres. This has led to the\r\ndeaths of scores of civilians and the wounding and\r\ndisabling of over 200 others, and has impeded\r\ngovernmental development efforts by effectively\r\nremoving a large area from agricultural or industrial\r\nexploitation.\r\nThe mine clearance process in Lebanon has been\r\nguided by the six main goals and the 48 subsidiary\r\nobjectives defined by the United Nations mine action\r\nstrategy for the period 2001-2005, as is evident from\r\nthe following. First, the United Nations has played a\r\nmajor role in highlighting the problem of mines in\r\nsouthern Lebanon. In his most recent report to the\r\nSecurity Council on the United Nations Interim Force\r\nin Lebanon (UNIFIL) (S/2003/728), the Secretary-\r\nGeneral noted that the mines were a source of great\r\nconcern. Moreover, Security Council resolution 1496\r\n(2003) urged donor States to increase their\r\ncontributions to mine clearance activities and called on\r\nIsrael, which is still withholding mine maps for 20 per\r\ncent of the relevant areas, to give those maps to the\r\nLebanese Government.\r\nSecondly, donor States responded to the request\r\nof Lebanon and the United Nations for assistance.\r\nContributions both in cash and in kind were provided,\r\nmost notably by the United States, the European Union,\r\nFrance, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia and others.\r\nIn that connection, I would like to single out the United\r\nArab Emirates for its contribution of $50 million.\r\nThirdly, Lebanon established the Lebanese\r\nNational Demining Office and in cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations and the United Arab Emirates, the\r\nMine Action Coordination Centre of Southern Lebanon\r\nwas established. Contracts were signed with two\r\ncommercial mine clearance companies employing some\r\n317 mine experts. Furthermore, a forestation project\r\nwas launched, with the motto “a tree for every mine”.\r\nFourthly, a Ukrainian UNIFIL contingent is\r\nundertaking mine clearance in an area bordering the\r\nBlue Line, where it plans to clear some 1,000 fields\r\ncontaminated by more than 250,000 mines. The process\r\nis expected to take a long time — possibly seven years.\r\nFifthly, the National Demining Office, with the\r\nassistance of a number of non-governmental\r\norganizations, is educating the local population about\r\nmine risks. That education programme has reached\r\n500,000 of the 800,000 inhabitants of the area. Also,\r\nthe Mine Action Coordination Centre publishes\r\nperiodic reports detailing the achievements made and\r\nthe challenges that remain, and its web site will soon\r\nbe operational.\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nThose measures have led to a decrease in the\r\nnumber of mine victims, from 14 deaths and 71 injuries\r\nin 2001, to 4 deaths and 38 injuries in 2002. Also,\r\napproximately 60,000 mines and unexploded ordnance\r\nhave been cleared from land and fields that were then\r\nreturned to their owners. In that context, we reaffirm\r\nthat Israel, which planted the mines in southern\r\nLebanon, should take responsibility for the mine\r\nclearance costs and compensate Lebanon for the\r\ndamage inflicted.\r\nFinally, Lebanon, which appreciates the solidarity\r\nof the international community with respect to its mine\r\nproblem, reaffirms its cooperation, in turn, with the\r\ninternational community to eliminate that scourge and\r\ncreate a world free of mines.\r\nMr. Pavlovich (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): We\r\nare entering a very important juncture in the Ottawa\r\nprocess. In a year’s time, Nairobi will host the first\r\nReview Conference of the States Parties to the Mine\r\nBan Convention, which will take stock of what has\r\nbeen achieved so far and introduce mechanisms to\r\nensure the broader universality of the Convention.\r\nIt is my pleasure to update members on Belarus’s\r\nparticipation in the Ottawa process. The Republic of\r\nBelarus is a State party to almost all international\r\nagreements in the field of international security, non-\r\nproliferation and arms control. In implementing those\r\nagreements, Belarus contributes to strengthening\r\nregional and global security and stability.\r\nOn 3 September 2003, Belarus deposited with the\r\nSecretary-General its instrument of accession to the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and\r\non Their Destruction.\r\nAt the national level, we have conducted an in-\r\ndepth study of the provisions of the Convention and the\r\ninternational commitments stemming from it.\r\nAccording to that study, even under the most\r\nfavourable conditions, Belarus will need substantial\r\nfinancial and technical resources to carry out the\r\ndestruction of its stockpiles of more than 4 million\r\nanti-personnel mines — our unwanted heritage from\r\nthe Soviet Union. Of those, 3.6 million are of the PFM\r\ntype — mines containing liquid explosives. There are\r\nstill a number of technical issues with respect to the\r\nsafe and secure destruction of the stockpiled PFM-1\r\nand PFM-1S mines for which the international\r\ncommunity as a whole needs to find answers.\r\nAccording to the provisions of the Ottawa\r\nConvention, our country must eliminate its mine\r\nstockpiles within a four-year period. Last year, we\r\ndestroyed more than 22,000 anti-personnel mines. This\r\nyear, before joining the Convention, Belarus destroyed\r\nmore than 100,000 mines. While non-PFM mines can\r\nbe destroyed through open burning or open detonation,\r\nthose destruction techniques cannot be used with\r\nPFM-1 and PFM-1S mines for ecological reasons.\r\nUnder those circumstances, we appeal to\r\nGovernments, international agencies and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations to assist the Republic of\r\nBelarus in its stockpile elimination efforts. All kinds of\r\ntechnical, technological and financial assistance would\r\nbe warmly welcomed.\r\nIn that context, the Republic of Belarus welcomes\r\nthe mechanism incorporated in the Ottawa Convention\r\nfor international cooperation and financial and\r\ntechnological assistance among parties for mine\r\nclearance and the destruction of stocks of anti-\r\npersonnel mines.\r\nBelarus welcomes the positive and important role\r\nplayed by non-governmental organizations in the\r\ninternational movement to ban anti-personnel\r\nlandmines. During the process of acceeding to the\r\nOttawa Convention, we found the Belarus branch of\r\nthe International Campaign to Ban Landmines to be a\r\nreliable partner.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus supports the practice of\r\nproviding annual reports on landmines, and supplies\r\nthe necessary information for such reports. We believe\r\nthat that process represents a unique civil society\r\ncontrol mechanism to ensure that all States comply\r\nwith existing international agreements in dealing with\r\nmine-related problems.\r\nThe first years since the implementation of the\r\nOttawa Convention have revealed a number of\r\nproblems, but we share the view that any undertaking\r\nof that type will encounter difficulties. I hope that in\r\nfuture a positive approach will be taken to resolving\r\nsuch difficult issues in accordance with the strict\r\nimplementation of the provisions of the Convention.\r\nThe Ottawa Convention has become a powerful tool\r\nand provides us with an opportunity to complete a\r\nnoble mission — the total prohibition and elimination\r\nand anti-personnel landmines, which have caused\r\nenormous suffering on all continents.\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nMr. MacKay (New Zealand): The legacy of war\r\nis not easily overcome, and that is especially true in\r\nthose countries where many landmines and large\r\namounts of unexploded ordnance remain. In response\r\nto the humanitarian crisis caused by mines and\r\nunexploded ordnance, New Zealand has been active on\r\na number of fronts.\r\nNew Zealand supports mine action in a variety of\r\nways in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Iraq, Laos,\r\nMozambique and Sri Lanka. These include the\r\nprovision of mine-clearance personnel in Cambodia\r\nand Mozambique and support for the United Nations\r\nMine Action Service (UNMAS) in New York, as well\r\nas for non-governmental organizations involved in\r\nmine clearance and mine-awareness programmes.\r\nIn countries such as Afghanistan and Cambodia,\r\nthe area of land to be cleared of mines and unexploded\r\nordnance is overwhelming, and success will be\r\nachieved only over a number of years. We believe that\r\nfurther work needs to be carried out on establishing\r\nfirmer estimates on the extent of the mine problem\r\nglobally. For New Zealand’s part, where possible we\r\nhave focused on capacity-building within the affected\r\ncommunity as one way of assisting mine-affected\r\ncountries in the long term. Mine action should be part\r\nof a comprehensive strategy towards reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment in the aftermath of conflict.\r\nNew Zealand strongly supports the work of\r\nUNMAS, a focal point for mine action within the\r\nUnited Nations system playing an important role as a\r\ncoordinator of mine activities with non-governmental\r\norganizations and regional authorities. We welcome the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, which reviews the progress\r\nof United Nations mine-action strategy for the period\r\n2001-2005. There have clearly been a number of\r\npositive steps since 2001, including the development of\r\nan operational framework for rapid response and the\r\nMine-Action Guidelines for Ceasefire and Peace\r\nAgreements.\r\nThe Ottawa Convention banning the use,\r\nstockpiling and production of anti-personnel mines\r\ncontinues to be a successful and constructive forum for\r\nmine action. New Zealand continues to be a steadfast\r\nsupporter of the Ottawa Convention, not only as an\r\ninstrument of disarmament significance but, more\r\nimportantly, as a precedent-setting humanitarian\r\ninstrument. We call on those States outside the Ottawa\r\nConvention to respect the now firmly established norm\r\nagainst the use of anti-personnel mines and to join the\r\nConvention without delay. Next year New Zealand will\r\nbe taking up a position on the Bureau as co-rapporteur\r\nof the Standing Committee on General Status and\r\nOperation of the Convention. We look forward to\r\nworking with partners in the lead-up to next year’s\r\nReview Conference, to be held in Kenya.\r\nStates parties to the Convention on Certain\r\nConventional Weapons (CCW) will arrive at a critical\r\njuncture this month when we find out whether a legally\r\nbinding instrument addressing the humanitarian impact\r\nof explosive remnants of war and providing a mandate\r\nfor anti-vehicle mines can be achieved. At that\r\nmeeting, the credibility of the CCW forum will be on\r\nthe line, as the dreadful toll of deaths and injuries\r\ncaused by explosive remnants of war and anti-vehicle\r\nmines is well known. The proposal for an instrument\r\non explosive remnants of war has the potential to assist\r\nmine-clearance operations in carrying out demining\r\nwork more expeditiously and effectively and to prevent\r\ncasualties and injuries from explosive remnants of war.\r\nThat potential will be realized only through a legally-\r\nbinding instrument which unambiguously sets out the\r\nobligations on States parties to firmly establish a strong\r\nnorm on clearance and underlines the importance of\r\nmeasures to protect civilians.\r\nFinally, we wish to express our appreciation for\r\nthe non-governmental organizations that work on mine-\r\naction issues, in particular the International Campaign\r\nto Ban Landmines, which continues to successfully\r\nmobilize support for the Ottawa Convention, and the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross, whose\r\nefforts in the field and in the area of international\r\nhumanitarian law are invaluable. The New Zealand\r\nnon-governmental organization Campaign Against\r\nLandmines continues to pursue the full universalization\r\nand implementation of the Ottawa Convention in the\r\nPacific region; those efforts are also greatly\r\nappreciated by the New Zealand Government.\r\nWe welcome the opportunity provided by this\r\ndebate, because mine action requires all of our\r\ncollective efforts to build a more secure and stable\r\nfuture for those unfortunate communities affected by\r\nmines.\r\nMr. Khan (Pakistan): The nature and scope of\r\nthe problem created by the irresponsible use of\r\nlandmines is enormous. Almost 40 per cent of United\r\nNations Member States face the problem of landmines\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nin one form or another. The victims are mostly\r\ninnocent civilians, women and children, both during\r\nand after conflicts.\r\nThe latest figures show that an estimated 110\r\nmillion anti-personnel mines are scattered around 70\r\ncountries. This alarming situation requires immediate\r\nremedial measures to be taken.\r\nIn our neighbourhood, Afghanistan has to cope\r\nwith the scourge of over 10 million landmines, which\r\ncause hundreds of casualties every month. Added to\r\nthis problem is the existence of unexploded ordnance.\r\nTwo decades of foreign occupation and internecine war\r\nhas left the entire country infested with landmines and\r\nunexploded ordnance. Despite the paucity of Pakistan’s\r\nmedical facilities, hundreds of Afghan mine victims are\r\nbeing treated in our hospitals and health centres. Many\r\nhave been provided with artificial limbs in order to\r\nhelp them to rehabilitate their lives and regain their\r\nlivelihood.\r\nEncouragingly, there is today greater international\r\nrealization of the need to address the problems posed\r\nby landmines and unexploded ordnance. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report entitled “Assistance in mine action”\r\n(A/58/260) and his report on the third-year review of\r\nthe five-year United Nations mine strategy\r\n(A/58/260/Add.1) reflect these positive trends. The\r\nsuccesses noted in the Secretary-General’s report are\r\nworth recounting.\r\nThere is now greater awareness of mine-action\r\nproblems through the use of information technology.\r\nThere is also an improved capacity to respond to\r\nemergencies. In this regard, the emergency mine action\r\nprogramme in Iraq and in seven other priority\r\ncountries, including Afghanistan, have received greater\r\nattention from the United Nations agencies.\r\nCapacity-building has been undertaken in 30\r\nnations to enable them to cope with emergencies\r\nrelating to landmines and unexploded ordnance.\r\nEnhanced resource mobilization has had a positive\r\nimpact on increasing the mine-action coverage area. As\r\ncompared to the donation of $28 million received by\r\nthe United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) last\r\nyear, $67 million has been mobilized this year. This is\r\ntruly commendable.\r\nHowever, there are four areas which need\r\nimmediate and concerted efforts. First, there is a need\r\nto increase the programme outreach of UNMAS\r\nthrough electronic and print media. Radio and\r\ntelevision can play a vital role in raising awareness\r\namong people living in mine-infested regions and in\r\nsensitizing the donor countries at the popular level so\r\nthat they remain engaged in mine-action efforts.\r\nSecondly, there is a need to increase the\r\nparticipation of national authorities in mine action\r\nprogrammes by providing equipment and training to\r\nthe local people. This can further decrease the time\r\nrequired for demining operations.\r\nThirdly, modern demining technologies should be\r\nmade available to the affected countries, so that\r\ndemining operations can gather momentum and\r\nenhance the safety of the personnel involved in such\r\noperations.\r\nFourthly, demining operations should be\r\nsupplemented with rehabilitation programmes, such as\r\nthose providing artificial limbs to mine victims and\r\naffording them job opportunities closer to their homes.\r\nPakistan is committed to the peace and prosperity\r\nof humanity. In that regard, apart from being the largest\r\ntroop contributor to United Nations-led peacekeeping\r\noperations, Pakistan has in the past actively contributed\r\nto demining operations in several affected countries.\r\nPakistan has participated actively in demining\r\noperations in Kuwait, Cambodia, Angola, Bosnia and\r\nthe Western Sahara. We are also helping in demining\r\noperations in Sierra Leone and in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo. We are ready to provide\r\ntraining facilities to all mine-affected countries.\r\nPakistan is against the irresponsible use of\r\nlandmines, which have caused so much destruction,\r\npain and misery. Pakistan remains committed to\r\nensuring the highest standards of responsibility in the\r\nuse of these defensive weapons. Pakistan is a party to\r\nthe Amended Protocol II of the Certain Conventional\r\nWeapons Convention (CCW), which regulates the use\r\nof landmines in both internal and external conflicts, to\r\nprevent civilians from falling victim to landmines. We\r\nare continuing to implement the Protocol with the\r\ngreatest earnestness.\r\nPakistan enjoys a unique record: clearing all its\r\nminefields following the three wars in South Asia. No\r\nhumanitarian problem has ever been caused by the use\r\nof those mines. We remain committed to ensuring that\r\nthe mines in our military inventory will never become a\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\ncause of civilian casualties in Pakistan or elsewhere in\r\nthe world.\r\nChurchill once said: “The United Nations is not\r\nto take us to heaven, but to save us from hell.” That is\r\nvery true. Let us together save the world from the hell\r\nof landmines and of war. Let us work for peace for us\r\ntoday and peace for our children tomorrow.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): In considering the item entitled “Assistance in\r\nmine action”, the General Assembly is once again\r\nreaffirming the importance that the international\r\ncommunity attaches to the threat posed by landmines,\r\nwhich are deployed in more than 60 countries. Every\r\nyear mines kill or maim thousands of people in those\r\ncountries and cause vast economic losses and\r\nenvironmental damage, which hamper those countries’\r\nefforts to create conditions conducive to sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn his report submitted to the Assembly under the\r\nprovisions of resolution 57/159, the Secretary-General\r\nfocuses on the progress made in implementing the six\r\nstrategic objectives of the United Nations mine action\r\nstrategy for 2001-2005.\r\nLibya notes that the United Nations system has\r\nplayed a significant role in the implementation of those\r\nobjectives. The United Nations has already provided\r\nassistance and advice to a number of countries with a\r\nview to putting an end to the tragedies resulting from\r\nthose weapons.\r\nAs Libya stated at the previous session, we hope\r\nthat, for the duration of the five-year strategy and\r\nbeyond, such assistance will be provided to all\r\ncountries in order to enable them to rid themselves of\r\nthese weapons with indiscriminate effects, which\r\ndevastate the lives of innocent people and cause\r\ntremendous damage.\r\nIn document A/58/260/Add.1, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral states that, as a result of the 2003 review of the\r\nUnited Nations mine-action strategy, a number of the\r\nplan’s objectives have been modified. Of course, we\r\nsupport the determination of the United Nations to\r\nencourage all countries to accede to international\r\nhuman rights instruments and to abide by international\r\nhumanitarian law with respect to the rights of\r\nindividuals affected by mines or unexploded ordnance.\r\nWe know that one of the goals of the\r\nOrganization is to achieve the universality of the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and\r\non Their Destruction, since it is one of the major pillars\r\nof international efforts to put an end to this devastating\r\nscourge. However, it is doubtful that this goal can be\r\nachieved if the views and concerns of many countries,\r\nincluding mine, are not taken into account.\r\nWe have certain reservations on the Convention\r\nas concerns national security, in particular with respect\r\nto countries whose territories include vast areas that\r\ncannot be otherwise protected. The Convention ignores\r\na very important issue — that is to say, the legal\r\nresponsibility of the colonial countries, which planted\r\nmines on the territory of other countries — although\r\nthis is a very important aspect of international\r\nrelations.\r\nThat responsibility has been reaffirmed in a\r\nnumber of resolutions adopted by regional and\r\ninternational organizations. At the Summit of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China, which was held at Havana, a\r\nnumber of resolutions were adopted by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity that make explicitly\r\nclear the responsibility of those countries that planted\r\nmines on the territories of others during colonial wars\r\nand call on those States to allocate funds from their\r\nmilitary budgets for demining and to provide\r\ninformation about mines and assistance to the victims\r\nof mines.\r\nIn the final document of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement Summit, held in Kuala Lumpur last\r\nFebruary, heads of State or Government expressed their\r\nconcern about the remnants of the Second World\r\nWar — particularly mines — which have claimed lives,\r\ncaused material damage and hampered development.\r\nThey called upon countries responsible for planting\r\nmines to cooperate with the affected countries by\r\nsubmitting the needed information, including maps of\r\nmine sites; by providing technical demining assistance;\r\nand by paying compensation for any losses incurred.\r\nMy country, Libya, continues to suffer from the\r\nproblem of mines and other remnants of war that were\r\nplanted on its territory during the Second World War.\r\nReports by the United Nations and other organizations\r\nhave verified that Allied and Axis Powers planted\r\nmillions of mines and other ordnance in North Africa,\r\nwhich have claimed the lives of thousands of innocent\r\ncivilians and permanently disabled many others, in\r\naddition to hampering our development in our efforts to\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nfight desertification, build roads, utilize our natural\r\nresources and expand our agriculture.\r\nAlthough more than half a century has now\r\nelapsed since the war ended and both defeated and\r\nvictorious forces withdrew, mines and unexploded\r\nordnance are still buried in our territory. They are\r\nsometimes accidentally detonated by development\r\nworkers, herders or hikers who can become\r\npermanently disabled as a result. That tragedy\r\ncontinues because the warring parties at the time did\r\nnot place markers clearly indicating minefield\r\nlocations. As a result, innocent civilians have perished,\r\nand we still have not received any maps providing\r\ninformation on this matter that would enable us to\r\neradicate the weapons buried in Libyan territory.\r\nIn 1998, Libya and Italy signed an agreement to\r\ncooperate in mine clearance efforts in Libya, to provide\r\ntreatment and compensation for affected victims, to\r\nestablished a joint fund to finance the rehabilitation of\r\nmine-affected areas and to establish a medical centre\r\nfor treating people maimed as a result of mines. Italy\r\nhas partially implemented the agreement in Benghazi.\r\nWe should like to reiterate that the agreement is a very\r\nwelcome precedent. We hope that the other two\r\ncountries that planted mines in Libya during the\r\nSecond World War — the United Kingdom and\r\nGermany — will follow Italy’s lead and respond to our\r\nlegitimate request by agreeing to assist the Libyan\r\nauthorities in putting an end to this problem and to\r\ncompensate the Libyan people for the losses and\r\ndamage caused by mines that were planted in our soil\r\nmore than half a century ago.\r\nThe great number of both new and old mines that\r\nremain buried in many countries’ territories reminds us\r\nthat the international community has a long way to go\r\nbefore innocent civilians are fully rid of this lethal\r\nweapon. However, the efforts made thus far are\r\nencouraging. It is essential that all United Nations\r\nMember States renew their commitment to clearing\r\nmines and other explosive remnants of war from the\r\naffected areas — not merely discussing the issue, but\r\ntruly eliminating new and old mines. The Libyan\r\ndelegation affirms that that will be one of the goals of\r\nthe remaining period of the current five-year mine\r\naction strategy and of the new strategy proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General for the five-year period 2005-2009.\r\nWe believe it is very important that all relevant\r\nefforts by the international community, including my\r\ncountry, focus on finding a solution that will address\r\nreservations with regard to the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction. We can do that by annexing a protocol to\r\nthe Convention that would provide for countries’\r\nsecurity interests while helping us to remove old\r\nmines, which — like new ones — are wreaking havoc\r\non people’s lives and property and hampering efforts to\r\nend desertification and to achieve and enhance\r\nsustainable development.\r\nMr. Castellón Duarte (Nicaragua) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\ncountry members of the Central American Integration\r\nSystem: Belize, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic,\r\nGuatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama and my\r\nown country, Nicaragua.\r\nAt the outset, I wish to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report, “Assistant in mine action”\r\n(A/58/260 and Add.1), which contains very important\r\ndata on the activities being carried out in that sphere\r\nthroughout the world. The report focuses on progress\r\nmade in attaining the six strategic goals and related\r\nobjectives listed in “United Nations mine action: a\r\nstrategy for 2001-2005” (A/56/448/Add.1). That\r\nprogress, according to the report, has been achieved in\r\nthe following areas: greater information and improved\r\ninformation technology; improved emergency response\r\ncapacity; sustained efforts to strengthen national mine\r\naction capacity; significant improvement in\r\nmanagement quality; satisfactory resource\r\nmobilization; and greater promotion of relevant legal\r\ninstruments.\r\nAll of our countries are States parties to the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and\r\non Their Destruction, known as the Ottawa\r\nConvention. It is a response by the international\r\ncommunity aimed at achieving a total ban on such\r\ntreacherous weapons. Likewise, none of the countries\r\nthat I represent has produced or imported into its\r\nterritory anti-personnel mines since signing the\r\nConvention.\r\nMine clearance operations in Central America\r\nhave been of great importance in the past five years,\r\nbecause thousands of anti-personnel mines and other\r\nexplosive devices were planted indiscriminately during\r\nthe conflict years of the 1980s until the beginning of\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nthe 1990s. A mine removal programme requested of the\r\nOrganization of American States by Costa Rica,\r\nHonduras and Nicaragua in 1991 has successfully\r\ncontinued in operation, having accomplished its\r\npurpose in the first of the countries mentioned.\r\nUntil their deactivation — which frequently\r\noccurs many years after they were planted — anti-\r\npersonnel mines, in addition to causing loss of human\r\nlife and leaving survivors disabled, pose a threat to the\r\ncivilian population, preventing fertile lands from being\r\nused for agriculture, making regional development\r\nimpossible and limiting job opportunities — not to\r\nspeak of the health and rehabilitation costs involved in\r\nproviding assistance to mine victims. Those tasks lead\r\nto a diversion of the resources that are so necessary for\r\nthe development of our peoples.\r\nI shall now provide a brief description of the\r\nprogress that has been achieved in our countries in\r\ndealing with the mine problem.\r\nCosta Rica was declared a mine-free zone at a\r\nceremony on 10 December 2002. Mines on Costa\r\nRican territory resulted from a domestic conflict in\r\nNicaragua during the 1980s and were planted along the\r\nborder shared with that country. Costa Rica has never\r\nhad any stockpiled mines.\r\nIn El Salvador, mine clearance concluded in\r\n1994. It had been carried out by the International\r\nDanger Disaster Assistance company from Belgium,\r\nwhich had been contracted by the Government to\r\nperform this task. El Salvador was subsequently\r\ndeclared 97 per cent free of anti-personnel landmines.\r\nHowever, due to accidents that have taken place since\r\nthen, local authorities, with the assistance of the\r\nInternational Demining Group, a British non-\r\ngovernmental organization, identified 33 areas\r\nsuspected of containing unexploded ordnance in the\r\nformer areas of conflict. Most of these devices were\r\nhome made. The Government undertook actions to rid\r\nitself of those devices. The destruction of stockpiled\r\nmines in El Salvador concluded on 20 February 2003.\r\nIn Guatemala, the executive coordinating unit set\r\nup in 1997 prepared a national plan for mine clearance\r\nand the destruction of unexploded ordnance. It was\r\noriginally scheduled to conclude its work in 2005 but\r\noperations were stepped up thanks to assistance\r\nreceived from donor countries and the conclusion of\r\noperations is now set for 2004.\r\nMines in Honduras were sown all along the\r\nHonduras-Nicaragua border by participants in the\r\nNicaraguan conflict. The mine-clearance programme\r\nwas scheduled to conclude in 2002 but a series of\r\ntechnical problems involving metal detectors,\r\ncommunications and other issues made it impossible to\r\ncomplete it on time. In May 2003, the last mine-\r\nclearance operation began in the department of El\r\nParaiso. Mine clearance will thus conclude and\r\nHonduras will be declared to be free of mines by the\r\nend of this year. Honduras destroyed its stockpiled\r\nlandmines on 2 November 2000.\r\nThe Dominican Republic, Panama and Belize\r\nhave never used, manufactured, imported or stockpiled\r\nany anti-personnel landmines, nor have they used them\r\nfor training. They are thus not affected by mines. But\r\nin Panama contamination of military stores resulted\r\nfrom military exercises and weapons field testing in the\r\ncanal zone during the three decades that preceded\r\n1997. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF),\r\nthe ministries of health, education and foreign relations\r\nand non-governmental organizations are preparing an\r\neducation plan for awareness-raising on unexploded\r\nmilitary equipment that has been found among the\r\npopulation living around the affected areas. This\r\nproject has been extended until 2004.\r\nIn Nicaragua, some 9,000 anti-personnel mines\r\nwere deactivated by the middle of this year, leaving\r\napproximately 46,000 mines that must be cleared in an\r\narea covering 135,500 square metres in the north of the\r\ncountry. Due to various problems, such as a lack of\r\nemergency transport aircraft for medical evacuations,\r\nthe topography of the terrain and the difficulty in\r\nlocating mines because of the lack of precise reference\r\npoints, displacement of mines from their original\r\nlocation as a result of rain or water flows, and plant\r\ngrowth in mined areas, landmine removal operations in\r\nNicaragua will have to conclude in 2005 rather than in\r\n2004 as had originally been scheduled. Nicaragua\r\ndestroyed its stockpiled mines some time ago.\r\nIn view of the experience acquired by\r\nNicaraguan, Honduran and Salvadoran sappers, the\r\nGovernments of those countries decided to send some\r\nof these forces to Iraq to assist in mine clearance\r\nefforts in that country. In this way, we are showing\r\nsolidarity with that country and are helping it eradicate\r\nthis plague.\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nCentral Americans have always worked together\r\nto achieve our objectives in mine clearance, and this is\r\npart of a strategy to entirely eradicate this threat from\r\nthe region. The Central American Security Commission\r\nis preparing an integral regional programme for the\r\neducation, medical care, rehabilitation and reinsertion\r\ninto productive society of survivors of accidents caused\r\nby mines and unexploded ordnance in Central America.\r\nThis will provide a comprehensive solution to the\r\nsituation with preventive, educational and corrective\r\ncriteria in order to improve the quality of life of those\r\nwho survive anti-personnel landmine accidents.\r\nWe want the future generations of all parts of the\r\nworld to live free from the suffering incurred by this\r\nplague of anti-personnel mines. We appeal to States\r\nthat are not yet parties to the Ottawa Convention to\r\nadhere to it and to comply with its provisions. Their\r\npeoples and peoples throughout the world will thank\r\nthem.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate for this meeting.\r\nOne representative has requested to exercise the\r\nright of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in the\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and to 5 minutes for the\r\nsecond intervention and should be made by delegations\r\nfrom their seats.\r\nMr. Shacham (Israel): I am taking the floor\r\ntoday in order to briefly clarify certain inaccuracies in\r\nthe statement just made by the representative of\r\nLebanon.\r\nOn 24 May 2000, Israeli forces completely\r\nwithdrew from southern Lebanon in full and confirmed\r\ncompliance with United Nations Security Council\r\nresolution 425 (1978). Five days later, on 29 May,\r\nIsrael Defence Force liaison officers held a series of\r\nmeetings with the senior command of the United\r\nNations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and\r\ntransferred detailed maps previously used by the Israel\r\nDefence Force regarding the location in southern\r\nLebanon of minefields and areas suspected of\r\ncontaining mines and other explosive devices. This\r\nalso included all information regarding mines and other\r\nexplosive devices planted by other elements operating\r\nin the area.\r\nUpon receiving the Israeli maps and files,\r\nUNIFIL’s senior command signed official\r\nconfirmations of transfer of this information. Israel\r\nremains willing to assist, should any further\r\nclarifications be required with regard to the\r\ninformation it has transferred. Indeed, Israel’s\r\nwillingness to cooperate in mine clearance has already\r\nbeen demonstrated elsewhere in the world.\r\nDuring the period of 1995 to 2001, Israel, in\r\nconjunction with the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF), conducted a mine-awareness project in\r\nAngola, which was aimed at educating the local\r\npopulation about the hazards of mines. Additionally,\r\nIsrael conducted a joint mine clearance project with\r\nJordan in the Arava Valley in order to enable the\r\nagricultural utilization of that area. Similarly, Israel,\r\nJordan, Canada and Norway joined in a quadrilateral\r\nproject aimed at Jordan Valley mine clearance and\r\nmedical rehabilitation for Jordanian mine victims.\r\nAs is widely known, southern Lebanon has served\r\nas a breeding ground for terrorist activity for many\r\nyears, in violation of international law including\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001). Throughout\r\nthis period, large quantities of mines, booby traps and\r\nother devices have been laid by terrorist groups and\r\nindividual terrorists. These mines and explosive\r\ndevices were never marked, mapped or reported, nor\r\nwere the areas fenced off in order to avoid civilian\r\ncasualties. Today, these mines and booby traps\r\ncontinue to pose a serious threat to the population.\r\nPursuant to United Nations Security Council\r\nresolution 425 (1978) and subsequent Security Council\r\nresolutions, and in accordance with international law, it\r\nis the responsibility of the Government of Lebanon to\r\nestablish effective control and authority in the area and\r\nrestore peace and security to southern Lebanon.\r\nClearly, the failure to fulfil these responsibilities with\r\nrespect, inter alia, to minefields, endangers the civilian\r\npopulation in the area. Let me cite one example. About\r\none month ago, Israel detected a cluster of roadside\r\nmines which had been recently set up a few metres\r\ninside Lebanese territory, adjacent to the border fence\r\nin the central Gallilee sector, in the same area from\r\nwhich, last spring, terrorists infiltrated into Israel from\r\nLebanon and carried out an attack on civilian vehicles\r\nnear Kibbutz Matsuba, killing five Israelis. These\r\nexplosive devices, ready to be triggered against any\r\nvehicle moving along the border road, prevent Israeli\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\npatrols from effectively doing their job protecting the\r\nlives of civilians in our northern communities.\r\nOut of respect for Lebanese sovereignty, and in\r\ncompliance with Security Council resolution 425\r\n(1978), Israel forces have refrained from crossing the\r\nBlue Line, even the few metres necessary, in order to\r\nremove these charges. Consequently, Israel turned to\r\nthe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)\r\nto request their assistance, which in turn presented the\r\nmatter to the Lebanese authorities. However, although\r\nclearly informed of the presence of these explosive\r\nbooby traps, Lebanese authorities did nothing to\r\nremove them, in clear violation of their legal\r\nresponsibilities. Instead, they reported to UNIFIL that\r\nthe terrorist elements which had originally planted the\r\nbooby traps had now dismantled them. Needless to say,\r\nthe mines are still there waiting to explode, preventing\r\nfree movement on the Israeli side of the border and\r\nmaking it very difficult for us to protect our civilians\r\nfrom the terrorist threat continuing to emanate from\r\nLebanese territory.\r\nRegarding the last point raised by the Lebanese\r\nrepresentative on the issue of compensation, I would\r\nlike to state that we have yet to hear about any\r\nLebanese willingness to compensate Israel and its\r\ncitizens for the colossal damage caused by the\r\nterrorism emanating from Lebanese territory for over\r\nfour decades. Israelis have also been killed, maimed\r\nand wounded and some have been kidnapped and are\r\nstill missing. What about compensation for these\r\nvictims and for the colossal economic burden upon\r\nIsrael’s citizens due to the need to defend themselves\r\nfrom the terrorism that is allowed free reign against us\r\nfrom Lebanese territory? In accordance with United\r\nNations Security Council resolutions and international\r\nlaw, the Government of Lebanon is fully responsible\r\nfor that terrorism.\r\nWhere there is good will and a willingness to\r\ncooperate, much good can be accomplished in the area\r\nof mine clearance. However, when these are absent, the\r\nresult is a perpetuation of the threat to the well-being\r\nof innocent civilians.\r\nThe President: Another representative has\r\nrequested the exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMr. Assaf (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): I would\r\nlike to give some advice to the representative of Israel.\r\nHe should read the General Assembly’s rules of\r\nprocedure which state that when exercising the right of\r\nreply, a delegation has to limit the scope of its\r\nstatement. I did not mention every topic referred to by\r\nthe representative of Israel. The representative of Israel\r\nshould not have wasted the time of this Assembly by\r\nbringing up points I did not refer to at all.\r\nI will respond solely to those points that were\r\ncontained in my statement. First, the representative of\r\nIsrael said a moment ago that Israel transferred to\r\nLebanon all the mine maps. He said “all information\r\nregarding mines”. If this is true, I wonder why the\r\nSecurity Council, and not Lebanon, in Security Council\r\nresolution 1496 (2003), required that the remaining\r\nmaps be given to Lebanon. This was not only\r\nLebanon’s position; it was also the position of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Security Council. The Israeli\r\nrepresentative’s problem obviously is not with\r\nLebanon, but is with the Security Council. As is\r\ncustomary, and as is the case with all United Nations\r\norgans and the Security Council, the representative of\r\nIsrael should go to the Security Council and ask it why\r\nIsrael was asked to hand over all the maps relating to\r\nmines in Lebanon. To confirm what I have just said, we\r\nhave Security Council resolution 1496 (2003), where\r\nthe Security Council confirmed the need to provide\r\nLebanon and the United Nations Interim Force in\r\nLebanon (UNIFIL) with all the maps and documents\r\nrelating to the location of the mines. That is what the\r\nSecurity Council said, not what Lebanon said.\r\nFurthermore, the representative of Israel\r\nannounced that he is prepared to cooperate on the\r\nquestion of mines. We hope that Israel would give us\r\nthe remaining 20 per cent of the maps because without\r\nthem it will take us seven years to eliminate all the\r\nmines. The representative of Israel said that Israel has\r\nprovided assistance to Africa for mine removal. I\r\nwould say that before going to Africa you should hand\r\nover the maps of the mines you have planted in\r\nLebanon, to Lebanon.\r\nIn conformity with the principle of international\r\nresponsibility and law, when a country commits certain\r\nacts, that country is responsible for such acts and\r\nshould pay compensation for damages and losses\r\nincurred.\r\nFinally, there is a proverb that says that if you\r\nhave committed sins, then go hide. But instead of\r\nhiding, Israel announces arrogantly to the world that it\r\nis helping to remove mines in the Congo. Before going\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.56\r\nto the Congo, Israel should try to remove the mines\r\nwhich it has buried in Lebanese territory.\r\nMr. Shacham (Israel): I will be brief. I would\r\nlike to refer to the statement that I made in my first\r\nintervention in exercise of the right of reply regarding\r\nthe question of the maps of the mines.\r\nThe information that we transferred included all\r\ninformation regarding mines and other explosive\r\ndevices planted by other elements operating in the area,\r\nand those that we found it necessary to place in the\r\narea due to the terrorist activity emanating from\r\nLebanon against Israel. I would also like to note that\r\nthe question of the maps of the mines was not even\r\nmentioned in the most recent report of the United\r\nNations Interim Force in Lebanon that covered the\r\nperiod up to July 2003.\r\nMr. Assaf (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): In\r\naddition to responding verbally, I would like to draw\r\nthe attention of members to a document — not a\r\nLebanese document, but a United Nations document.\r\nThe Israeli representative has just said that the report\r\nof the Secretary-General did not touch upon this\r\nquestion. Earlier, I quoted from Security Council\r\nresolution 1496 (2003), and I will not repeat what I\r\nquoted. But I would like to draw the attention of\r\nmembers to the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, contained in\r\ndocument S/2003/728. The Israeli representative said\r\nthat the Secretary-General did not touch upon this issue\r\nin that report. However, paragraph 11 of that report,\r\nwhich is a United Nations, not a Lebanese, report\r\nstates:\r\n“The presence of a large number of\r\nminefields in the UNIFIL area of operation ...\r\nremained a matter of serious concern.”\r\nThe representative of Israel should read the report\r\nbefore coming here to tell us that the Secretary-General\r\ndid not touch upon this question.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to announce that at\r\n10 a.m. on Thursday, 6 November 2003, there will be\r\nan informal consultation of the General Committee in\r\nthe Economic and Social Council Chamber, open to all\r\ndelegations on the subject of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development, followed by the 4th meeting of\r\nthe General Committee. Mr. Ibrahim Gambari, Under-\r\nSecretary-General and Special Adviser on Africa, will\r\nmake a presentation.\r\nI should also like to inform members that, at the\r\nrequest of the Francophone countries, consideration of\r\nagenda item 61, “Multilingualism”, originally\r\nscheduled for the morning of Monday, 10 November\r\n2003, is now postponed to March 2004.\r\nRepresentatives are requested to consult the Journal of\r\nthe United Nations for the announcement of the time\r\nand date in March 2004.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
