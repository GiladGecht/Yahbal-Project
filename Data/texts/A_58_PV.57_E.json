Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 17\r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs\r\nand other appointments\r\n(h) Appointment of a member of the Joint\r\nInspection Unit\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/58/108)\r\nThe President: As indicated in document\r\nA/58/108, the General Assembly is required, during the\r\nfifty-eighth session, to appoint a member to fill the\r\nvacancy in the Joint Inspection Unit that will arise\r\nfrom the expiration of the term of office on 31\r\nDecember 2004 of Mr. Sumihiro Kuyama of Japan.\r\nAs indicated in document A/58/108, in\r\naccordance with article 3, paragraph 1, of the Statute of\r\nthe Joint Inspection Unit, the President of the General\r\nAssembly shall consult with Member States to draw up\r\na list of countries — in this case, one country — which\r\nwould be requested to propose a candidate for\r\nappointment to the Joint Inspection Unit.\r\nAfter holding the necessary consultations, I\r\nshould like to communicate to the Assembly that the\r\ninformation that I have received from the Chairman of\r\nthe Group of Asian States is that for one vacancy from\r\nthe Asian States, there are two candidates, namely\r\nJapan and Pakistan.\r\nSince there are two candidates for one vacancy, I\r\nshould like, in accordance with past practice, to consult\r\nwith Member States through the procedure of holding\r\nan advisory vote by secret ballot to select one country\r\nfrom among the Asian States to be requested to\r\npropose a candidate for appointment to the Joint\r\nInspection Unit. Although this advisory vote would not\r\nbe an election, we would follow the rules of procedure\r\nof the Assembly governing elections.\r\nIf there is no objection, may I take it that the\r\nGeneral Assembly agrees to that procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with existing\r\npractice, the country receiving the greatest number of\r\nvotes, and not less than a majority of the votes of those\r\npresent and voting, shall be requested to propose a\r\ncandidate for appointment to the Joint Inspection Unit.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that\r\nprocedure also?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In the case of a tie vote, there\r\nwill be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates\r\nthat have obtained an equal number of votes — which\r\nis not a problem in this case. May I take it that the\r\nAssembly agrees to that procedure also?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Also in connection with this\r\nselection process, I would like to remind members that\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\nin accordance with Article 19 of the Charter and\r\nresolution 58/1 of 16 October 2003, two Member\r\nStates will not be given ballot papers.\r\nMay I remind members that the Assembly is not\r\nappointing members to the Joint Inspection Unit at this\r\ntime. It is only selecting one country, which will be\r\nrequested to propose a candidate. Therefore, only the\r\nname of a country, and not the name of an individual,\r\nshould appear on the ballot paper.\r\nI should like now to repeat the names of the two\r\ncountries from among the Asian States that wished to\r\npropose a candidate: Japan and Pakistan.\r\nI should further like to point out that from the\r\nAsian States, China already has a national serving on\r\nthe Joint Inspection Unit. The name of that State\r\nshould therefore not appear on the ballot paper.\r\nThe Assembly will now proceed to the selection\r\nof one country from among the Asian States, which\r\nwill be requested to propose a candidate to fill the\r\nvacancy in the Joint Inspection Unit.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like\r\nto remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules\r\nof procedure of the General Assembly, no\r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a\r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process.\r\nBallot papers marked “B” will now be\r\ndistributed. May I request representatives to write on\r\nthe ballot paper the name of the one State for which\r\nthey wish to vote. Ballot papers bearing the name of\r\nmore than one State will be declared invalid. A ballot\r\ncontaining the name of a Member State that does not\r\nbelong to the relevant region or the name of an\r\nindividual shall not be counted at all.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Stoev\r\n(Bulgaria), Mr. Villacis (Ecuador), Ms. Kiel\r\n(Germany) and Mrs. Faye (Senegal) acted as\r\ntellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 3.25 p.m. and\r\nresumed at 3.45 p.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 185\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 2\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 183\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting: 183\r\nRequired majority: 92\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nJapan 101\r\nPakistan 82\r\nHaving obtained the required majority, Japan\r\nwas selected to be requested to propose a\r\ncandidate for appointment to the Joint Inspection\r\nUnit.\r\nThe President: I thank members for their advice,\r\nand I thank the tellers for their assistance.\r\nIn accordance with article 3, paragraph 1 of the\r\nstatute of the Joint Inspection Unit, Japan will be\r\nrequested to submit the name of a candidate and a\r\ncurriculum vitae highlighting the candidate’s relevant\r\nqualifications for the tasks ahead.\r\nAfter holding the appropriate consultations\r\ndescribed in article 3, paragraph 2, of the statute of the\r\nJoint Inspection Unit, including consultations with the\r\nPresident of the Economic and Social Council and with\r\nthe Secretary-General in his capacity as Chairman of\r\nthe United Nations System Chief Executives Board for\r\nCoordination, the President of the General Assembly\r\nwill propose a qualified candidate to the Assembly for\r\nappointment to the Joint Inspection Unit.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of sub-item (h) of agenda item 17.\r\nAgenda item 20\r\nSupport by the United Nations system of the efforts\r\nof Governments to promote and consolidate new or\r\nrestored democracies\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/58/392)\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Luvsangiin Erdenechuluun, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Mongolia.\r\nMr. Erdenechuluun (Mongolia): It is a distinct\r\nhonour and privilege for me in my capacity as\r\nPresident of the Fifth International Conference of New\r\nor Restored Democracies to report to the present\r\nsession of the General Assembly on the outcome of the\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\nConference held from 10 to 12 September this year in\r\nthe city of Ulaanbaatar. While the first Conference,\r\nheld in 1988 in Manila, was attended by the\r\nrepresentatives of 13 countries, the delegates of 119\r\ncountries from around the world, a host of international\r\norganizations, including the United Nations, and about\r\n100 non-governmental organizations participated in the\r\nUlaanbaatar Conference.\r\nThat testifies to the dynamic expansion of the\r\nmovement embracing both young and mature\r\ndemocracies. It is of special significance to my country,\r\nMongolia, that this conference on global democracy\r\nhas taken place in the heart of Asia, where empires\r\nwere born and crumbled, where unprecedented social\r\nexperiments had taken place and where we now see the\r\nemergence of a new global commitment to democracy\r\nand good governance.\r\nFor Mongolia to host that prestigious global\r\nassembly was a matter of great honour. We saw it also\r\nas a great responsibility. Today I am happy to report to\r\nthe Assembly that the Conference has been a success,\r\nand that is a conclusion shared by all the participants. I\r\navail myself of this opportunity to thank all the\r\ncountries for their active participation in the work of\r\nthe Conference. My special appreciation goes to\r\nAustralia, Canada, Cyprus, Germany, Japan, Italy,\r\nLuxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of\r\nKorea, Qatar, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United\r\nKingdom, the United States of America, the European\r\nCommission, Canada Fund and the organizations of the\r\nUnited Nations system for their valuable assistance and\r\nsupport in organizing this important event.\r\nA record number of States — as I said 119, with\r\nsome 30 of them at the ministerial or equivalent\r\nlevels — participated in the Fifth International\r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies, thus\r\nregistering the highest proportion of high-ranking\r\nofficials at a gathering of the International Conference\r\nof New or Restored Democracies.\r\nAn innovation in the Conference was a parallel\r\nParliamentary Forum, organized jointly by the\r\nParliament of Mongolia and the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion. It brought together 120 members of parliament\r\nfrom 47 countries. A highly interactive civil society\r\nforum, with 240 participants from 64 countries,\r\npreceded the Conference. Both forums presented their\r\nresults to the Conference. In addition, the Governments\r\nof participating countries were encouraged to include\r\nin their national delegations members of parliament\r\nand representatives of civil society. That was also the\r\ncase with most of the delegations represented at the\r\nConference.\r\nThis three-tiered format was introduced for the\r\nfirst time at the Fifth International Conference of New\r\nor Restored Democracies, and I believe that future\r\nconferences should continue this practice, as it proved\r\nits usefulness and relevance in Ulaanbaatar.\r\nThe main theme of the Fifth International\r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies was\r\n“Democracy, good governance and civil society”. The\r\nagenda reflected the most pressing and critical issues of\r\ndemocracy around the world. The discussion was\r\nstructured around the three main areas of concern:\r\nstrengthening democratic governance and cooperation\r\nwith civil society, challenges to and opportunities for\r\ndemocracy and partnership and participation in poverty\r\nreduction and the attainment of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nThe delegates engaged in a fundamental debate\r\non how to consolidate the political choice of\r\ndemocracy and sustain it both by the people’s own\r\nefforts politically, economically and intellectually, and\r\nby global commitments to democracy by nations both\r\nlarge and small. In the words of Mongolia’s President,\r\nMr. Natsagiyn Bagabandi, democracy is not a fairy\r\ntale — neither is it a gift from someone. Democracy, as\r\nan outstanding achievement of humanity, makes it a\r\nduty for everyone committed to it to strengthen its\r\npolitical institutions and safeguard it against any risks.\r\nThe delegates to the Fifth International\r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies received\r\na message from Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in\r\nwhich he noted the progress made in democratic\r\ndevelopment but cautioned against triumphalism, given\r\nthe setbacks around the world, including the weakening\r\nof the substance of democracy, the abuse of electoral\r\nsystems and the alienation of a growing number of\r\npeople who felt marginalized and excluded.\r\nSome 70 heads of delegations spoke in the\r\nplenary, exchanging experiences in promoting\r\ndemocracy and good governance, as well as identifying\r\nthe manifold challenges facing democracy in both\r\nnational and international contexts, along with ways\r\nand means to address them. The keynote address to the\r\nConference was delivered by Prime Minister\r\nEnkhbayar, who presented an in-depth analysis of\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\nMongolia’s democratic movement in its historical\r\nperspective and offered specific ideas and suggestions\r\naimed at strengthening the movement of new or\r\nrestored democracies in the evolving globalizing\r\nenvironment in which we live.\r\nThe Fifth International Conference of New or\r\nRestored Democracies focused on the following\r\nqualitative and substantive issues of democracy and\r\ntheir solutions: the rule of law, improvement of\r\ndemocratic constitutional arrangements, democratic\r\npolitical and electoral systems, the threat of electoral\r\nfundamentalism and the need for electoral reforms,\r\ncivil and political rights of citizens, accountability and\r\ntransparency of government, the dangers of\r\nbureaucracy and corruption, consolidation of multi-\r\nparty systems, the role of a free media, civil society\r\norganizations as vehicles of democracy, institutional\r\narrangements for State-civil society partnerships, the\r\nability of local communities to participate in decision-\r\nmaking, inclusiveness of the democratic process and\r\nthe representation and participation of citizens. The\r\ndelegates were unanimous in their belief that\r\ndemocracy should not be taken for granted and that it\r\ncould only be strengthened through a wide and\r\ninclusive discussion of the issues just outlined and the\r\nmustering of the requisite political will and solidarity.\r\nThey also noted that democratic reforms were a\r\ncontinuous process with no one-size-fits-all solutions.\r\nNevertheless, the basic values and principles as well as\r\nthe normative dimensions of democracy embodied in\r\nthe basic human rights instruments serve as the\r\nessential guidelines to be respected by all democracies,\r\nboth young and old.\r\nThe leitmotif of the deliberations at the Fifth\r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies was the need for a higher quality of\r\ndemocracy, its entrenchment, and the internalization of\r\na democratic culture. One of the most important\r\naspects of democracy is good governance. The\r\ndelegates concentrated on ways to make governance\r\nmore effective and participatory, more transparent and\r\njust, more responsive and responsible.\r\nDuring the discussions at the Fifth International\r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies strong\r\nconcern was voiced that globalization has been largely\r\ndetrimental to democracy, as it has caused increased\r\npoverty and marginalization, especially among the\r\nmost vulnerable. While globalization was seen to\r\npresent a number of opportunities, it was emphasized\r\nthat in order to mitigate the negative effects of\r\nglobalization various international regulatory\r\nframeworks needed to be put in place.\r\nThe delegates unanimously condemned terrorism\r\nand upheld the central role of the United Nations in\r\nfighting that scourge. The deliberations also called for\r\nglobal democratic multilateralism to strengthen\r\nstrategic partnerships for democracy, development and\r\nsocial progress. The attainment of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and the elimination of poverty,\r\nunemployment and social exclusion also required a\r\ngenuine partnership for development at national,\r\nregional and international levels.\r\nAt the end of deliberations, the Fifth International\r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies adopted\r\ntwo major documents reflecting the core principles and\r\nundertakings discussed by the participants and charting\r\nthe future for democratic development. The\r\nUlaanbaatar Declaration and Plan of Action will guide\r\nthe activities of the Conference in the coming years.\r\nBoth documents serve to preserve the continuity of the\r\nideas of previous Conferences and at the same time to\r\nfind new ways to strengthen democracy and the\r\ninternational democratic movement.\r\nThe Ulaanbaatar Declaration of the International\r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies sets forth\r\nsix key principles of democratic society: they are just\r\nand responsible; they are inclusive and participatory;\r\nthey promote and protect the rights and freedoms of all\r\ntheir members; they are open and transparent; they\r\nfunction under agreed rules of law and accountability,\r\nregardless of the challenges they may face; and they\r\nshow solidarity towards others. The participants agreed\r\non a total of 52 commitments based on the six\r\nprinciples; the Plan of Action outlines ways in which\r\nthose commitments can be implemented at the national,\r\nregional and international levels. In this respect, on\r\nbehalf of my Government, I wish to commend the\r\nSecretary-General for his report under the agenda item\r\nbefore us (A/58/392), which, in addition to outlining\r\nthe work and results of the Fifth Conference, provides\r\nan analytical description of the activities carried out by\r\nthe United Nations system in recent years in the area of\r\nassistance to democracy and good governance.\r\nHaving ensured that democracy is at the heart of\r\nall the measures laid out in the Declaration and the\r\nPlan of Action, our primary responsibility now is to see\r\nthat those measures are fulfilled. The Plan of Action\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\nstrongly recommends strengthening the Follow-up\r\nMechanism to promote and implement the measures\r\nendorsed at the Ulaanbaatar Conference. Proceeding\r\nfrom this premise, I would like to share with the\r\nAssembly some preliminary ideas on how to ensure an\r\neffective follow-up.\r\nFirst, as recommended by the Ulaanbaatar\r\nConference, the President of the Conference, with the\r\nassistance of the United Nations, is asked to establish a\r\nworking group to examine the conclusions of the Fifth\r\nConference, as well as the proposals made in\r\nbackground papers and interventions, in order to make\r\nfollow-up more effective and efficient and to draw up a\r\npractical programme of work. The working group is to\r\noperate within a defined time frame and come up with\r\nspecific proposals on guiding the implementation of the\r\nfinal documents of the Fifth Conference and\r\nmonitoring its progress. I believe that the group of the\r\nfriends of the Chair informally established at the end of\r\nthe Ulaanbaatar Conference will be formalized shortly\r\nand serve as a core of this working group. I understand\r\nthat informal consultations are under way to find an\r\nacceptable solution to that issue.\r\nThe Plan of Action calls for the development of\r\nnational plans to strengthen democracy, the preparation\r\nof country information notes outlining the prospects of\r\nadvancing and deepening democracy in a given country\r\nand the development of nationally owned democratic\r\nindicators databases so as to better track the progress of\r\ndemocratic development. Apart from helping national\r\nconsensus-building by engaging all stakeholders, in our\r\nview this exercise will also contribute to further the\r\nnational consolidation of democracy. The Plan of\r\nAction also recommends that the development of\r\nnationally owned democratic indicators should benefit\r\nfrom the current work being done in other multilateral\r\nforums. The experience and expertise of ongoing\r\npractices could prove useful in developing a\r\nmethodology to be pursued in national exercises.\r\nSecondly, I intend to conduct consultations with\r\nthe chairs of relevant regional organizations on\r\npossible avenues of cooperation to advance the\r\nimplementation of activities identified in the Plan of\r\nAction for regional action.\r\nThirdly, I would like to suggest a regular meeting\r\nschedule for the Follow-up Mechanism, so that it may\r\nbetter sustain and monitor the International Conference\r\nof New or Restored Democracies process. This will be\r\nespecially helpful as we tend to be distracted by the\r\ndaily affairs of diplomacy in which we are immersed.\r\nHowever, the role that we have chosen demands that\r\nwe, as diplomats, work as both leaders and guardians\r\nof the spirit of the International Conference of New or\r\nRestored Democracies.\r\nFourthly, in pursuit of the Plan of Action of the\r\nConference, I intend to initiate discussions with the\r\nChair of the Community of Democracies to exchange\r\nviews on ways that the two movements can be brought\r\ncloser together and complement one another.\r\nFifthly, I will conduct consultations with\r\ninterested countries on the venue, timing and the theme\r\nof the next International Conference of New or\r\nRestored Democracies. So far, the State of Qatar has\r\nmade an official offer to host that Conference in Doha,\r\nwhich was duly noted at the Ulaanbaatar Conference.\r\nSixthly, my delegation has prepared a draft\r\nresolution under this agenda item, reflecting the\r\nproceedings and outcome of the Fifth International\r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies. I am\r\npleased to inform you that as a result of consultations,\r\nMongolia, together with 76 sponsors, has submitted a\r\ndraft resolution, which I hope will command the widest\r\npossible support of this august Assembly. We also hope\r\nthat many more countries will join the draft resolution\r\nas sponsors in the days ahead.\r\nAlthough the lights at the Conference podium are\r\nnow dimmed, the International Conference of New or\r\nRestored Democracies process should go on, and our\r\nwords need to be backed by action, action that is united\r\nand focused on essentials. Let us therefore move\r\nforward, shoulder to shoulder and in a concerted way,\r\nto strengthen democracy and good governance in the\r\nworld at large. As was eloquently said in the song\r\ndevoted to the Fifth International Conference of New\r\nor Restored Democracies, let us all stand tall together\r\nfor democracy and peace: the movement for the people;\r\nthe movement for the free.\r\nMr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I would like to extend my sincere\r\ncongratulations to you, Mr. President, on your\r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-eighth session. We have no doubt that —\r\nwith your experience, diplomatic skill and great\r\npatience — you will leave a distinct imprint on the\r\nwork of this session. We wish you every success.\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\nDemocracy, development and respect for human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms are interrelated and\r\nmutually reinforcing elements provided for by the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and other\r\ninternational human rights instruments. They are also\r\namong the principles and foundations underpinning any\r\ndemocratic society. Democracy is the aspiration of\r\npeople to choose their own cultural, social, economic\r\nand political systems and to participate fully in all\r\nwalks of life. While acknowledging the importance for\r\ndemocracy of free and fair periodic elections,\r\ndemocracy itself must be viewed as a process whose\r\nrequirements exceed the mere holding of elections.\r\nAny democratic system must provide its citizens with\r\nopportunities for full participation in all aspects of\r\nsociety while taking into account the primacy of law.\r\nDemocracy must include commitment to the principles,\r\nrules, institutions and actions that guarantee\r\nrepresentation and accountability and protect\r\nindividuals and groups from arbitrary conduct,\r\ninjustice or oppression by the State or by any other\r\nparty.\r\nWell-established democracies have undergone a\r\ngreat variety of experiences before arriving at their\r\ncurrent stage of intellectual maturity and their\r\nacceptance of the opinions of others. There is no single\r\nuniversal model of democratic practices in the world,\r\nbut, rather, there are many features common to all\r\ndemocratic States. Most models include political\r\nparticipation, joint decision-making and public\r\nfreedoms. Emanating from his belief in those great\r\nprinciples, His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa\r\nAl-Thani, the Emir of the State of Qatar, has exerted\r\nmajor efforts to achieve the social, political and\r\neconomic objectives of the State of Qatar through the\r\nestablishment of democracy, the reform of the economy\r\nand insuring a quiet transformation to a modern and\r\ndemocratic State.\r\nQatari society has experienced a major\r\ntransformation that includes all aspects of a modern\r\nState and assumes responsibility for the welfare of its\r\npeople. The first such step was the abolition of the\r\nMinistry of Information and Culture, in an effort to\r\nenhance the role of a free press, and the\r\nimplementation of numerous United Nations human\r\nrights conventions and protocols to which Qatar had\r\nacceded. Among other major steps was the holding of\r\nfree municipal elections on 8 March 1999 in which\r\nwomen were candidates and voted on an equal footing\r\nwith men. Moreover, in 2000 the State of Qatar\r\nembarked upon a new democratic political experiment\r\nbased on popular participation in public affairs through\r\nelected bodies and councils and on the establishment of\r\nforums for freedom of expression.\r\nThose steps culminated in the drafting of the\r\nConstitution, which represents a very important\r\ndevelopment. The date of 29 April 2003 marked a\r\nmilestone in our lives, both as a people and as a State.\r\nAfter 30 years under an amended provisional statute\r\nthat was no longer consistent with the requirements of\r\nthe times, we now have a permanent Constitution. The\r\nConstitution guarantees personal freedom and equal\r\nopportunity for citizens and protects private property. It\r\nalso provides equal rights and duties for citizens and\r\nprohibits the deportation of any citizen or preventing\r\ncitizens from returning to the country. The Constitution\r\nhas created a climate that accommodates all kinds of\r\nexpression, broadens the scope of the freedom of the\r\npress and publishing and allows everyone freedom of\r\nreligion, worship and belief. The Qatari people have\r\nbecome the source of authority and legislation is the\r\nprerogative of an elected legislature.\r\nThe elections served as a referendum on an\r\nextremely important document that will open up great\r\nprospects for an honourable future for our country.\r\nGiven that 96.6 per cent of voters supported the\r\nConstitution, the results confirmed the people’s\r\ngenuine desire for democracy and freedom of opinion,\r\nwhatever those opinions might be. Of course, that\r\npercentage also lent credibility to the results, which\r\ngarnered international appreciation and respect and\r\nunderscored the seriousness of the democratic process.\r\nThe great level of participation was a response to the\r\ncall made by the Emir of the State of Qatar in a speech\r\naddressed to the people of Qatar. The Emir said,\r\n“I urge you to vote on the Constitution\r\ntoday because it is of you and from you, heeding\r\nthe words of Allah the Almighty — ‘Consult\r\nthem in their affairs and let their affairs be the\r\nsubject of consultation among them’ — and\r\nemanating from our belief in the importance of\r\nyour views for the present and for the better\r\nfuture of the country, the citizens and new\r\ngenerations.”\r\nIn that regard, I would like to point out that the\r\nState of Qatar participated at a high level in the Fifth\r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\nDemocracies, which was held from 10 to 12 September\r\n2003 in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. The head\r\nof the delegation of Qatar, reflecting the belief of the\r\nState of Qatar in democracy and its support for its\r\nexercise at every international and domestic level, as\r\nwell as its support for international cooperation,\r\nexpressed in his statement before the Conference the\r\nhope of the State of Qatar to host the Sixth\r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies in Doha in 2006. That initiative was\r\nsupported by many of the States participating in the\r\nConference, including the Arab States. The last\r\nparagraph of the final report of the Ulaanbaatar\r\nConference also referred to the generous offer by the\r\nState of Qatar. While reaffirming its initiative to host\r\nthe next Conference, the delegation of the State of\r\nQatar urges all delegations to respond positively to that\r\nrequest and to support it, because that would be a\r\npositive step in supporting the Government and people\r\nof the State of Qatar in consolidating democratic ideals\r\nin the State and in the region.\r\nAs a modern democracy, the Government of the\r\nState of Qatar has affirmed at all levels in international\r\nforums its total and equal commitment both to its\r\npolitical responsibility and its national interests. It has\r\nalso stressed that it has consistently pursued a clear\r\nforeign policy based on respect for the sovereignty,\r\nindependence and national interests of States, and\r\nbased on friendship and mutual respect. Moreover, we\r\nhave underscored our belief in democratic international\r\ncooperation, as well as our strong support for\r\ninternational efforts aimed at the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes and crises within the framework of\r\ninternational legitimacy. Qatar adopted that democratic\r\napproach in order to establish a system based on strong\r\nconstitutional institutions.\r\nMr. Adechi (Benin) (spoke in French): The\r\naccession of a growing number of countries to the\r\nideals of democracy has become a basic characteristic\r\nof the new era that has emerged in the world since the\r\nmajor political and social changes of the end of the\r\n1980s. The Secretary-General’s exhaustive report\r\n(A/58/392) on the support by the United Nations\r\nsystem of the efforts of Governments to promote and\r\nconsolidate new or restored democracies makes it\r\npossible to measure both the progress made and the\r\nscope of this socio-economic phenomenon that aims to\r\npromote the establishment of a framework conducive\r\nto the development of humankind. We should welcome\r\nthe diverse work done by the United Nations system to\r\nsupport that process and to contribute to the\r\nstrengthening of governance.\r\nThe series of International Conferences of New or\r\nRestored Democracies has served as a manifestation of\r\nthat support. The Secretary-General’s report also\r\nallows us to appreciate the multidimensional character\r\nof that process and the intrinsic link that exists between\r\ndemocracy and the aspirations of peoples to live and\r\nprosper in peace, security and social justice. From\r\nManila to Ulaanbaatar, the International Conferences\r\nof New or Restored Democracies have made\r\nconsiderable progress. At each stage, they have dealt\r\nwith issues that are crucial to our peoples. Three years\r\nago, my country hosted the Conference on behalf of\r\nAfrica, at which the new or restored democracies and\r\ntheir partners considered the subjects of peace,\r\nsecurity, democracy and development. Asia is now\r\ncarrying the torch, and has injected new momentum\r\ninto this great movement by focusing attention on the\r\nissues of democracy, good governance and civil\r\nsociety. I would like to warmly congratulate the people\r\nand Government of Mongolia for all their efforts to\r\norganize and ensure the success of the Fifth\r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies.\r\nAt Ulaanbaatar we once again saw that\r\ndemocracy is a great cause to which our peoples are\r\ncommitted. But the debate has once again outlined the\r\nchallenges faced by democracy in our countries. Those\r\nchallenges — international terrorism, transnational\r\ncrime, corruption, unemployment and poverty — are\r\ngreatly jeopardizing the very nature of the rule of law\r\nand democracy. They can only be definitively dealt\r\nwith through the sustained and concerted mobilization\r\nof all national and international stakeholders. At\r\nUlaanbaatar, civil society emerged as a decisive player\r\nand essential component in the building of democracy\r\nand the rule of law. In that regard, the Fifth\r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies expanded the debate by establishing a\r\ndialogue between civil society actors, parliamentarians\r\nand Governments, all of which are both actors and\r\npromoters of democratic life in our countries.\r\nMy delegation therefore welcomes the particular\r\nattention that the Secretary-General has paid to the\r\nrecommendations of the Fifth International Conference\r\nof New or Restored Democracies in his report, which is\r\nthe subject of our debate this afternoon. My delegation\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\nalso supports the proposal to transform the follow-up\r\nmechanism into a formal structure that can better\r\nensure follow-up to the implementation of the\r\nConference’s Plan of Action, as well as the\r\ncontinuation of thinking and exchanges of experiences\r\non this issue.\r\nBenin has therefore become a sponsor of the draft\r\nresolution entitled “Support by the United Nations\r\nsystem of the efforts of Governments to promote and\r\nconsolidate new or restored democracies”.\r\nMr. Balarezo (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I am\r\nspeaking on behalf of the 19 member States of the Rio\r\nGroup, namely, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,\r\nColombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic,\r\nEcuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras,\r\nMexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Uruguay,\r\nVenezuela, and my own country.\r\nThe Rio Group has on numerous occasions\r\nreaffirmed its commitment to consolidate and\r\nstrengthen democracy, to exercise its values and to\r\ndefend its institutions. The Rio Group believes that\r\ndemocracy is the right of every people, and that it is\r\nthe only way to effectively exercise basic freedoms and\r\nhuman rights.\r\nIt is for those reasons that the Rio Group has from\r\nthe beginning followed with interest the development\r\nof the International Conferences of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies, including the Conference recently held in\r\nUlaanbaatar, Mongolia, which adopted a Plan of Action\r\nand a Declaration on Democracy, Good Governance\r\nand Civil Society. Those conferences are important\r\nforums for reflection and the exchange of ideas on the\r\nstrengthening, promotion and consolidation of\r\ndemocracies as an essential means of guaranteeing the\r\nsocial, political and economic development of peoples.\r\nLast May, the Presidents of the Rio Group\r\napproved in the Cuzco Consensus a series of measures\r\naimed at promoting democratic governance and\r\nstrengthening the rule of law. Those principles, which\r\nare based on the progress made in the region, represent\r\nimportant guidelines applicable to all of the world’s\r\ndemocracies due to the fact that they are all based on\r\nthe same principles and values and try to fulfil the\r\nlegitimate social needs of their peoples.\r\nIn that regard, the Rio Group resolved, first of all,\r\nto continue to carry out effective State reform in order\r\nto promote citizen participation and education, combat\r\ncorruption and strengthen public authorities. In order to\r\npromote citizen participation, special attention has\r\nbeen paid to the system of political parties, movements\r\nand groups.\r\nIn that regard, the countries of the Rio Group\r\nhave agreed to assume the following commitments.\r\nFirst, they have agreed to expand the participation of\r\npolitical parties, movements and groups by putting\r\nforth legislation that provides them with incentives.\r\nSecondly, the Group will also seek to ensure that\r\npolitical parties, movements and groups are\r\nindependent from economic powers by means of\r\nproviding equal access to communication media.\r\nThirdly, the Group will strengthen financial\r\ntransparency and promote internal democracy among\r\npolitical parties, movements and groups. Fourthly, the\r\nGroup will aim to promote equal opportunity within\r\npolitical parties, movements and groups by supporting\r\npolitical training programmes, especially for women,\r\nyoung people, ethnic groups and marginalized\r\npopulations.\r\nAnother aspect pertains to the fact that the\r\ncountries of the Rio Group have endorsed the need to\r\nestablish innovative financial mechanisms to\r\nstrengthen democratic governance and contribute to\r\novercoming poverty by raising new resources for\r\nproductive investment and creating decent jobs. That\r\nproposal is in response to the low economic growth\r\nrates of many developing countries, which impede the\r\nfulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals and\r\naffect the democratic governance of those countries.\r\nThose countries are forced to confront the immediate\r\nsocial demands of their peoples while there continue to\r\nbe restrictions on external financing, high external\r\nindebtedness, trade protectionism and inequitable\r\nglobalization.\r\nInnovative financial mechanisms would primarily\r\nseek to find additional new resources, increase the use\r\nof already available resources and diversify options\r\nand financial policies in order to create macroeconomic\r\nstability that has a direct impact on people’s standard\r\nof living and makes it possible to strengthen\r\ndemocratic systems and their institutions. The\r\ncountries of the Rio Group are working on concrete\r\nproposals that will soon be introduced for the\r\ninternational community’s consideration.\r\nIn order to bolster the Rio Group’s effort, it will\r\nbe important for the Secretary-General to draw up a\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\ncomprehensive report, with the support of international\r\nfinancial institutions and the regional development\r\nbanks, to consider proposals from various regions and\r\ncountries regarding possible innovative financial\r\nmechanisms to strengthen democratic governance in\r\nsuch areas as public investment, infrastructure, fiscal\r\nmanagement and external debt management.\r\nIn conclusion, the countries of the Rio Group\r\nhope to continue to contribute actively to this effort,\r\nalong with all States committed to this cause, in order\r\nto promote and strengthen democracy and its values.\r\nMr. Mantovani (Italy): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union. The acceding\r\ncountries of Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia\r\nand Slovenia, the associated countries of Bulgaria,\r\nRomania and Turkey and the European Free Trade\r\nAssociation country of Iceland align themselves with\r\nthis statement.\r\nThe outcome of the Fifth International\r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies, which\r\nwas held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, from 10 to 12\r\nSeptember 2003, proved that there is growing support\r\nfor strengthening democracy in all the regions of the\r\nworld as a system of government that is based on the\r\nrule of law, allows free expression of political opinions\r\nthrough electoral and other participatory mechanisms\r\nand guarantees the independence of the judiciary, the\r\nfreedom of the media and the promotion of human\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe Conference also addressed the question of\r\nthe many challenges to democracy, including poverty,\r\ninternational terrorism, transnational economic crime,\r\nHIV/AIDS and blatant disregard for human rights. It\r\nwas agreed that while it is crucial to fight those threats\r\neffectively, that must be done without eroding human\r\nrights or resorting to repression. Democracy and the\r\nprotection of human rights are inseparable. We cannot\r\nprotect democracy while at the same time undermining\r\nhuman rights. It was also noted that building up\r\ndemocracy is a long and difficult process, and that it\r\nshould not be allowed to compromise on issues such as\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. The\r\nparticipants recognized that even though democratic\r\nprocesses can benefit from external supports, a\r\ndemocratic system must have the support of the people\r\nconcerned. Nonetheless, it was acknowledged that\r\nthere is no universal recipe for democracy, as\r\ndemocracy can take different forms in different\r\ncountries.\r\nThe European Union believes firmly that\r\ndemocracy is a prerequisite for the respect of human\r\nrights, as well as for prosperity, progress and\r\nsustainable development. It is for that very reason that\r\nthe protection and advancement of democracy and the\r\nrule of law are among the top priorities of the\r\ninternational community. The European Union is\r\nstrictly committed to the implementation and\r\npromotion worldwide of democratic principles such as\r\nthose endorsed at the Conference in Ulaanbaatar.\r\nPeace and security also depend on the spread and\r\nconsolidation of democracy. A well-coordinated policy\r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations can help to\r\nachieve peaceful solutions to the conflicts that are\r\nthreatening stability in different areas of the world. But\r\nthat is not enough in itself. We also have to promote\r\nthe right conditions across the world that will enable\r\ndemocracy to take root where it has never existed\r\nbefore, or where it has been eliminated by war,\r\ndictatorship or the breakdown of civil society. It is\r\nequally necessary to shore up democratic institutions in\r\ncountries in transition and to support democracy in all\r\ncountries that have recently moved to a democratic\r\nsystem. In that context, it is important to emphasize\r\nthat the equal participation of women and men in\r\npolitical life and decision-making and the enjoyment of\r\nhuman rights by both genders on equal terms are\r\nprerequisites for genuine democracy.\r\nThe European Union is convinced that all\r\ndemocratic countries must join forces in order to\r\nadvance democracy and freedom and to make them a\r\ncredible model for all countries that, for one reason or\r\nanother, have not yet achieved democratic standards.\r\nSharing common democratic values brings about the\r\nneed to actively confront violations of human rights\r\nwhenever they occur in the world. In that light, it is\r\nalso important to promote democracy-building\r\nprogrammes, making every effort to encourage\r\ndialogue and to overcome traditional North-South\r\ndivisions.\r\nIn the view of the European Union, regional\r\ncooperation is an essential tool to promote democracy\r\nand human rights in every area of the world. The\r\nEuropean Union itself can serve as a successful\r\nexample of such cooperation. In fact, democracy and\r\nfundamental freedoms are the main pillars of the\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\nEuropean Union. To that end, the Amsterdam Treaty of\r\nthe European Union includes respect for democratic\r\nprinciples among the essential conditions that must be\r\nmet by any country seeking admission to the Union.\r\nFurthermore, any European Union member country\r\nfailing to honour that commitment might even be\r\nsuspended from membership.\r\nThe European Union fully supports, and will\r\ncontinue to support, the efforts of all States in the\r\nprocess of democratization. Consolidating democracy\r\nis one of the key objectives of the European Union’s\r\nCommon Foreign and Security Policy. Through its\r\ncooperation programmes, the European Union\r\nconcretely supports other States to promote\r\ndemocratization in several areas. Those include the rule\r\nof law — with special attention given to the field of\r\njustice — the effective participation of people in the\r\ndemocratic process, the role of civil society and the\r\ndevelopment of a consistent human rights culture.\r\nCooperation in the electoral process also represents a\r\nconsiderable share of the European Union’s overall\r\ncontribution to democratization and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in third countries.\r\nAt the same time, as a result of its tangible\r\ncommitment to support the growth of democratic\r\ninstitutions — particularly in countries where the\r\nconstruction of a democratic society confronts major\r\ndifficulties — the European Union attaches the utmost\r\nimportance to the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to devise and implement assistance and\r\neducational programmes for democracy.\r\nYet, democracy has to be built on the basis of\r\nuniversally acknowledged rules and practices, even\r\nthough we think that historical or cultural regional\r\nidentities should not be affected by interregional\r\ndialogue. Actually, neighbouring countries that have\r\nalready reached satisfactory standards of democracy\r\ncan make an extremely important contribution to all\r\ncountries that are trying to build up new domestic\r\ndemocratic institutions. It is therefore important that\r\nthe international community as a whole encourage and\r\nsupport all those countries as they move along that\r\nvery demanding route.\r\nToday many new democracies are making\r\nimpressive strides. They need our help in order to\r\ncontinue down that route. The European Union does\r\nnot seek to impose any particular model of democracy.\r\nWe recognize the unique political, social and cultural\r\nbackground of each country. If our efforts are to be\r\ntruly successful, we have to support those moving\r\ntowards democracy by giving the highest prominence\r\nto the essential role played by civil society. We must\r\nnot forget, furthermore, that without the stability\r\nafforded by democracy and the rule of law, we are\r\nunlikely to succeed in our struggle for a safer and more\r\nprosperous world.\r\nThe European Union would like to take this\r\nopportunity to thank Mongolia and its Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs for successfully arranging the Fifth\r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies, as well as to welcome Mongolia’s work\r\nin the follow-up to the Conference and the planning of\r\nthe next international conference.\r\nMr. Ismail (Malaysia): Allow me, at the outset,\r\nto express once again Malaysia’s appreciation to the\r\nGovernment of Mongolia for hosting the Fifth\r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies, which was held in Ulaanbaatar last\r\nSeptember. We congratulate it for the excellent\r\npreparation and conduct of the meeting, which\r\ncontributed to the successful outcome of the\r\nConference. Malaysia is pleased to have participated in\r\nthe Conference.\r\nThe world has changed greatly in the brief span\r\nof time between the holding of the Fourth Conference,\r\nin Benin in 2000, and the holding of the Fifth\r\nConference, in Ulaanbaatar. Certainly, the events of 11\r\nSeptember 2001 and subsequent related events have\r\nmarked and marred the world in a manner that could\r\nnot have been predicted earlier. The current\r\ninternational landscape has been further swept by the\r\nwinds of change and uncertainty, not least by the\r\nprospect of another country, Iraq, and its people\r\nmoving towards democracy. However, Iraq has shown\r\nus that trying to impose democracy by force is not an\r\neasy task. While the United Nations is recognized by\r\nmany as having an important role in promoting and\r\nstrengthening democracy in Iraq, the security situation\r\non the ground has not made it possible for the United\r\nNations to play that role effectively. My delegation\r\nsincerely hopes that a time will soon come that will\r\nenable the United Nations to make an important\r\ncontribution to the process of democratization in Iraq.\r\nThe international community must draw lessons\r\nfrom that. Whatever we do must be based on the model\r\nthat none of us has a monopoly on wisdom. We should\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\nkeep an open mind to different ways of addressing\r\nproblems. Furthermore, we must not be judgmental.\r\nMy delegation makes this point coming from a nation\r\nthat recognized early in its nationhood the virtues of\r\ndeveloping a democratic system that suits our national\r\ncircumstances. Like all former colonies, Malaysia and\r\nits people cherish our independence and the democratic\r\nsystem that we have developed in our own way while\r\nfollowing our history, customs and traditions and\r\ntaking into account the composition and cultural\r\ndiversity of our society.\r\nSince 1955 Malaysia has had 10 general\r\nelections. We have been fortunate that our successive\r\nGovernments have been elected by universal suffrage\r\nthrough a process of free, fair and peaceful elections.\r\nNotwithstanding a brief period of one and a half years,\r\nwhen the Parliament was suspended as a result of racial\r\nriots in 1969, democratic rule has flourished in\r\nMalaysia because early in our history we accepted that\r\nthere is no better method of governance than\r\ndemocracy, despite its pitfalls and imperfections.\r\nEqually important, it has flourished because we have\r\nshaped the democratic system to suit our national\r\ncircumstances. A few days ago, Malaysia and the world\r\nsaw the peaceful transition of leadership from a retiring\r\nPrime Minister to a new one. The Honourable Dato’\r\nSeri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, who led the\r\ndemocratically elected Government for 22 years,\r\nhanded over the premiership to his deputy, The\r\nHonourable Dato’ Seri Abdullah Haji Ahmad Badawi\r\non 31 October 2003.\r\nBased on Malaysia’s experience, my delegation\r\nwishes to emphasise that whatever the strengths of\r\ndemocracy, no one unique model of democracy can be\r\napplied in all situations and for all time. Most\r\nimportantly, we have also learned in Malaysia that\r\ndemocracy must be viewed as a means of achieving\r\nsocial justice and equity, and not as an end in itself.\r\nOne of the pillars of our democratic system is the\r\ndifferent roles played by the three branches of\r\ngovernment, as well as other actors, including the\r\nmedia and civil society. However, in certain societies\r\nthat hold the view that a robust democracy requires\r\nsocial relations to be competitive rather than\r\ncooperative, and where argument is prized over\r\nconsensus, there is a risk that the notion of competition\r\nis promoted to extremes. As a result, the spirit of give-\r\nand-take is weakened. When that happens, effective\r\ngovernance becomes impossible, particularly in\r\ncountries with complex ethnic and religious make-ups,\r\nresulting in social imbalance and instability.\r\nDeveloping countries, and especially new democracies,\r\ncan ill afford such imbalance and instability.\r\nIn order for a democratic system to flourish in\r\nthese trying times, it is essential that due attention be\r\npaid to the issue of social inclusion, not only through\r\naccess to the ballot box when elections are held\r\nperiodically but also through addressing issues such as\r\neconomic opportunity, measures to promote national\r\nintegration and the recognition of the interests of\r\nminority groups.\r\nIn an interconnected world, we must all recognize\r\nthe importance of having an enabling international\r\nenvironment in which democracy can really be\r\npromoted. There has to be a more equitable and just\r\ninternational system, as well as a more peaceful world\r\nfor democracies to thrive. Any attempt to impose\r\ndemocracy or any particular model of democracy from\r\noutside will not work. The difficulties that the world\r\nhas experienced since the end of the cold war have\r\nmeant that the democratic dividend for the vast\r\nmajority of countries involved in the transition to\r\ndemocracy has not yet arrived. The situation in some of\r\nthese countries presents a threat to international\r\nstability as they slide into anarchy and chaos. At the\r\nsame time, it seems grossly unfair that those members\r\nof the international community who have encouraged\r\nthese countries to adopt rapid measures towards\r\ndemocracy have failed to meet their commitments.\r\nThe international community must therefore do\r\nmore to ensure that an enabling environment is created\r\nfor new and restored democracies to progress further,\r\nboth in terms of their political and socio-economic\r\ndevelopment. For this to be achieved, it is imperative\r\nthat, among other things, adequate resources be given\r\nin order to ensure the realization of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, which provide a good framework\r\nfor creating that positive environment. Assistance and\r\ncooperation is vital, including from the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nWhen we get down to brass tacks, democratic\r\nsystems cost money. Elections, transparent\r\nadministration and an effective legislative\r\nframework — all the requisites and accoutrements of\r\ndemocracy — cost money. An effective democratic\r\nsystem, which brings about social justice, development\r\nand equity, costs even more. Resources should be\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\ndevoted to programmes geared towards building\r\nnational capacities, rather than merely on monitoring\r\nand administrative activities. But most importantly, we\r\nmust address not only issues of form of democratic\r\ninstitutions, but also the broader issues of social justice\r\nand equity.\r\nAt the heart of a democratic order is the principle\r\nof rule of law. By the same token, an international\r\nsystem that is just and democratic must be one in\r\nwhich international law is respected. To violate that\r\ncardinal principle would mean that the legitimacy of\r\nthe democratic system that is to be established is\r\nquestionable. Recent events have demonstrated that\r\noutside intervention to establish a democratic system is\r\nfraught with danger and uncertainties. The importance\r\nthat we accord to promoting democracy at the national\r\nlevel must be matched by ensuring democracy at the\r\ninternational level. Failure to do so will put into\r\nquestion the sincerity of those who only promote\r\ndemocracy at the national level.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate that a\r\ndemocratic system that is sustainable must take into\r\naccount national circumstances, provide for social\r\ninclusion and be supported by an enabling international\r\nenvironment. In this regard, we hope that the\r\nMalaysian experience for the last 46 years is of some\r\nuse and relevance to those countries which are new and\r\nrestored democracies.\r\nMr. Oyugi (Kenya): I thank you for giving me\r\nthis opportunity to address the Assembly. I would also\r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for his report\r\nA/58/392 on “Support by the United Nations system of\r\nthe efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate\r\nnew or restored democracies”.\r\nKenya appreciates the efforts of the United\r\nNations system in recent years to support and give\r\nassistance on democracy and good governance. Indeed,\r\nover the past decade, the United Nations has increased\r\nits support for new and restored democracies in Eastern\r\nEurope, Africa, Latin America and Asia. Many of those\r\ncountries have emerged from civil war and other forms\r\nof conflicts. The increase in support is commendable\r\nand we urge the Secretary-General to quantify it and\r\nmake it systematic.\r\nThe resolutions adopted during the recent Fifth\r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, from 10\r\nto 12 September 2003, were a clear indication of the\r\ndesire by new and emerging democracies to forge new\r\nfrontiers for democracy and good governance. The\r\nfinal report, in the form of a Declaration and Plan of\r\nAction, defined benchmarks for democratic governance\r\nand committed the 119 States which participated in the\r\nmeeting to implement comprehensive plans at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels.\r\nFor peace, stability and sustainable development\r\nto flourish, good governance is a prerequisite. This\r\nchallenge is one that Kenya has taken seriously. The\r\nDecember 2002 elections in Kenya were an indication\r\nof the people’s resolve to build a free and democratic\r\ncountry. During the elections, all citizens of Kenya\r\nwere provided with the opportunity to have a voice in\r\ndetermining their government. This is strong evidence\r\nthat Africans can and will embrace democracy and are\r\nready to determine their own destiny.\r\nKenya believes in good-neighbourliness and non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of other States. We\r\nrecognize the need to forge closer ties with our\r\nneighbours within the region and the world in general.\r\nAt the regional level, Kenya is a member of many\r\norganizations including the East African Community,\r\nwhose constitution encourages good governance and\r\ndemocracy. Kenya was also among the first African\r\ncountries to accede to the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) African Peer Review\r\nMechanism. The goal of this Mechanism is to get\r\nAfrican leaders to subject their Governments to\r\nexamination by fellow African leaders in such priority\r\nareas as peace and security, democracy and political\r\ngovernance and economic corporate management.\r\nWe consciously entered into this innovative\r\narrangement knowing that the process was meant to\r\nimprove human rights standards, economic\r\nmanagement, conflict resolution and, above all,\r\ndemocratic decision-making within the continent.\r\nAt the national level, the Government of Kenya is\r\ncommitted and has the political will to fight corruption\r\nso as to achieve zero tolerance for this scourge. The\r\nHead of State is personally leading the Government’s\r\nefforts in the fight against corruption. To that end, the\r\nGovernment recently enacted the Anti-Corruption and\r\nEconomic Crimes Act of 2003. The Act provides for\r\nthe prevention, investigation and punishment of\r\ncorruption, economic crimes and related offences, as\r\nwell as the establishment of special anti-corruption\r\ncourts.\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\nThe magistrates designated to head those special\r\ncourts have already been appointed. The law replaces\r\nthe Anti-Corruption Police Unit with the Kenya Anti-\r\nCorruption Commission, the latter having a wider\r\nmandate to investigate and prosecute corruption cases\r\nand to initiate and implement special anti-corruption\r\nprogrammes.\r\nFurther, pursuant to the law, the Kenya Anti-\r\nCorruption Advisory Board, comprised of Kenyans of\r\nhigh moral integrity, was recently commissioned to\r\nadvise the Government on issues relating to corruption\r\nand to supervise the work of the Commission. The Act\r\nalso provides for compensation and the recovery of\r\nimproper benefits resulting from corruption or\r\neconomic crime.\r\nThe Government of Kenya has also recently\r\npassed into law the Public Officer Ethics Act of 2003.\r\nThe Act seeks to safeguard the ethics of public officials\r\nby providing a code of conduct aimed to ensure that\r\npublic officials carry out their work with integrity and\r\ndiligence. The law, among other things, makes it\r\ncompulsory for all public officials to declare their\r\nincome, assets and liabilities annually.\r\nIn that connection, Kenya warmly welcomes the\r\nadoption by this plenary only last Friday, 31 October\r\n2003, of the United Nations Convention against\r\nCorruption. We look forward to its signing in Mexico\r\nlater this year. Undoubtedly, the Convention will\r\nsupplement our national efforts in the fight against\r\ncorruption and strengthen the international\r\ncommunity’s global fight against corruption.\r\nKenya supports the Secretary-General’s efforts in\r\npeace-building and peacekeeping. That contribution is\r\nborne out of the understanding that States emerging\r\nfrom conflicts need to establish necessary institutions\r\nbut, above all, need to establish peace, as a major\r\ningredient for democracy.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate that democracy\r\nand good governance form the basis for a peaceful\r\nworld. If those cardinal tenets are upheld, the United\r\nNations will be able to devote more resources to its\r\ndevelopment agenda. Poverty, unemployment and\r\nsocial exclusion have been identified as threats to\r\ndemocracy. We call upon donors and international\r\nfinancial institutions to increase support to developing\r\ncountries in order to enable them to enhance\r\ndemocracy and address the major socio-economic ills\r\nas part of the drive towards the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nWe therefore support the suggestion of the\r\nSecretary-General that the General Assembly, at its\r\ncurrent session, give support to the recommendations\r\nof the Fifth International Conference of New or\r\nRestored Democracies.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): May I\r\ncongratulate you most warmly, Mr. President, on your\r\nskilful stewardship of our proceedings. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s very succinct report on this agenda item\r\n(A/58/392) reaffirms that the United Nations stands\r\nfirm as a strong pillar of support to the ideal and\r\ninstitution of democracy worldwide. I place on record\r\nhere our high commendations to the Government of\r\nMongolia for successfully hosting the Fifth\r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies in Ulaanbaatar last September. Our\r\ncommitment to the process was amply demonstrated by\r\nour representation at the ministerial level at the\r\nmeeting.\r\nI take the floor as the voice of a vibrant,\r\npluralistic and liberal democratic society of 130 million\r\npeople. We in Bangladesh enjoy, advocate and promote\r\ndemocracy and freedom. Democracy for us is the\r\nreflection of the will of the governed — the people —\r\nto determine their own political, economic, social and\r\ncultural ethos. It is our firm conviction that democracy\r\nis the best governance practice for ensuring\r\nfundamental freedoms and human rights. It upholds the\r\nrule of law, makes government accountable and makes\r\ndecision-making transparent. It empowers people and\r\nprevents the abuse of power by authority through\r\nchecks and balances. It guarantees equality,\r\nrepresentation and the participation of all.\r\nIt is a democratic society that promotes genuine\r\nfreedom of human thought and speech and fosters\r\npartnership between the Government and civil society.\r\nIt is democratic polity that can best own its national\r\npolicies to achieve poverty eradication through social\r\ninclusion and the people’s ownership of the process.\r\nDemocracy, education and economic emancipation help\r\ndispel extremism and violence, foster cultural harmony\r\nand tolerance and promote sustainable peace and\r\ndevelopment. These fundamental values are vital to the\r\nstability, progress and prosperity of all societies\r\nemerging from conflict, suppression or oppression.\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\nOne of the most profound changes in the post-\r\ncold-war era has been that more and more societies and\r\npeoples have overwhelmingly opted for a democratic\r\nform of governance. However, the greatest challenge to\r\nthe consolidation of those new or restored democracies\r\nis not a political one but the lack of international\r\nsupport to sustain their socio-economic development\r\nand overcome the downside of globalization. A\r\nparadigm shift in institutional and behavioural\r\npatterns — inculcating a culture of democratic politics\r\nand practices — is vital to their success. Equally vital\r\nis the sustained socio-economic empowerment of their\r\npeoples, capacity-building for the liberalization of\r\nmarkets and buttressing trade as the engine of growth.\r\nHard terrors such as terrorism, extremism and\r\nintolerance can threaten the fragile security and\r\nsovereignty of nascent democracies. Equally\r\ndestabilizing can be soft terrors such as hunger,\r\ndisease, privation and environmental degradation.\r\nToday, Bangladesh is in the midst of tremendous\r\nsocietal transformations under the dynamic leadership\r\nof Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia. Democracy,\r\nfreedom, pluralism and liberalism are the ethos close to\r\nevery Bangladeshi heart and are an integral part of our\r\npolitical culture. Our Constitution, embodying the\r\nprinciples and provisions of the Universal Declaration\r\nof Human Rights, is the supreme law of the land, from\r\nwhich emanates all statutory and special laws for the\r\nprotection of human rights and the fundamental\r\nfreedoms of our people.\r\nGender justice, gender mainstreaming and\r\nwomen’s empowerment are at the heart of our\r\ndemocratic aspirations. Minorities and other vulnerable\r\ngroups enjoy special rights with consistent political,\r\nsocial and economic support from the Government.\r\nThose elements have gone a long way towards\r\ncontaining extremist and irrational thought and action.\r\nThey have helped to make moderation and tolerance\r\nthe twin characteristics of Bangladeshi society.\r\nWe are convinced that, without people’s effective\r\nparticipation, human rights — in particular the right to\r\ndevelopment — will remain unrealized. Through a mix\r\nof appropriate macroeconomic polices, the judicious\r\nuse of external support and innovative home-grown\r\nideas such as microcredit and primary education —\r\nformal and non-formal — we have made peace and\r\ndevelopment the twofold supreme objective of our\r\nnation.\r\nAs key to the success of our democratization\r\nprocess, we have institutionalized a neutral and\r\ntransparent electoral process. A non-partisan caretaker\r\nGovernment oversees our parliamentary elections to\r\nensure fairness and impartiality. A democratically\r\nelected Parliament, thriving with the representation of\r\nall major political parties, is at the centre of our\r\nnational decision-making process. An independent law\r\nreform commission is dedicated to modernizing and\r\nharmonizing laws with international legal obligations,\r\nwhile rural courts have been established to decentralize\r\njustice.\r\nA national human rights commission and an\r\nombudsman’s office are in the offing to enhance\r\naccountability of governance. Freedom of the press has\r\nbeen the hallmark of our democratic practices, while\r\nclose development collaboration with a vibrant civil\r\nsociety has been a matter of national pride. Through\r\nour civil society practitioners, we endeavour to spread\r\ndemocratic values — such as women’s\r\nempowerment — and socio-economic programmes —\r\nlike microcredit and non-formal primary education —\r\nin many post-conflict societies in Africa, Asia and\r\nLatin America. Our armed forces impart those ideals as\r\nUnited Nations peacekeepers in distant parts of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe twin challenges posed by globalization and\r\ninternational terrorism seriously undermine efforts in\r\nour countries to enjoy the fruits of democracy and\r\nliberty. While globalization offers significant\r\nopportunities, it also gives rise to inequalities,\r\ndiminishing market access and causing economic\r\nstagnation. Terrorism, on the other hand, threatens\r\ndemocracy, human security and social harmony and\r\nbreeds hatred. The success of our democracies,\r\ntherefore, will depend largely on our ability to provide\r\nour peoples a secure and prosperous world where they\r\ncan fully enjoy their freedom without any\r\ndiscrimination or deprivation. The fulfilment of\r\ncommitments undertaken in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, at the Monterrey and Johannesburg\r\nsummits and at other global conferences is critical to\r\novercome these challenges.\r\nAs many of the nascent democracies march\r\nforward on the path of peace, stability and\r\ndevelopment, let us hope that critically needed\r\ninternational support will be forthcoming to\r\ncomplement their national efforts. The United Nations\r\npromotes the best of human endeavours. We fully\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\nendorse the coherent and multidimensional support\r\nprovided by the United Nations during the past years to\r\nmany of those countries to consolidate the rule of law\r\nand to improve governance. United Nations assistance\r\nin electoral processes, post-conflict peacekeeping and\r\npeace-building, the disarmament, demobilization and\r\nreintegration of ex-combatants and the strengthening of\r\nlaw enforcement, legal, judicial and human rights\r\ninstitutions in post-conflict societies is noteworthy.\r\nBangladesh is proud to have been closely associated\r\nwith those United Nations efforts worldwide.\r\nThe Fifth International Conference of New or\r\nRestored Democracies provided an excellent\r\nopportunity to share national experiences in deepening\r\nthe roots of democracy. The Ulaanbaatar Plan of\r\nAction is an important follow-up mechanism for all\r\nconcerned to stay the course in promoting democracy\r\nglobally, regionally and nationally. We must, however,\r\nrecognize that democracy is an evolving process. It is\r\nnot a panacea for all that is ill. It cannot be imposed or\r\nprescribed. Neither should it be restrained or\r\nconstrained. Every nation enjoys its sovereign national\r\nideals and its ethos for democracy and governance.\r\nThese should be respected.\r\nLet me conclude by reaffirming that we are ready\r\nto share our best practices in upholding the ideals of\r\ndemocracy, liberty and pluralism with societies\r\nenjoying new or restored democracies.\r\nMr. Mubarez (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nToday’s meeting is taking place immediately after the\r\nholding of the Fifth International Conference of New\r\nor Restored Democracies, which demonstrated the\r\ncommitment of the participating States to democracy as\r\nan ideal way to overcome the difficulties they\r\nencounter, both nationally and internationally. The\r\noutcomes of the Conference — particularly the\r\nDeclaration and Plan of Action — provide criteria for\r\nthe establishment of an agreed framework to evaluate\r\nthe democratic process in those countries and outline\r\nactions aimed at achieving democratic government\r\nduring the second stage.\r\nWe commend the Secretary-General for his report\r\non this issue (A/58/392), which contains a detailed\r\nassessment of the Conference and its outcome. My\r\ndelegation also commends the recommendations in the\r\nreport that support the efforts of Member States. As a\r\nparticipant in the Conference, Yemen has always\r\ndemonstrated the importance of cooperation among all\r\nMember States as a way to promote democracy, given\r\nthat democracy is a choice for construction and\r\ndevelopment. Democracy, in our case, was an\r\nirreversible national decision and was synonymous\r\nwith unity. Democracy was a sure guarantee of the\r\ncontinuity and strength of the unity of the State that\r\nwas established on 29 May 1990. Realities have shown\r\nthat the democratic process and commitment to its\r\nideals have made us overcome the various challenges\r\nthat we have faced in the last 13 years.\r\nWe are proud of what our country has already\r\nachieved in building a democracy, whether it be\r\nestablishing democratic institutions or disseminating\r\ndemocratic concepts. We witness that ongoing\r\ndemocratic process through the media, with their\r\nvarious voices and opinions, and the participation of\r\ncivil society and political parties and parliamentary and\r\npresidential elections.\r\nThe Ulaanbaatar Conference considered all the\r\nissues being addressed by new or restored democracies\r\nand the principles of democratic governance have been\r\ndetailed and refined. Moreover, the parliamentary and\r\ncivil society forums demonstrated the commitment of\r\ntheir States to greater participation in the democratic\r\nprocess, and its deliberations and statements revealed\r\nadditional challenges facing us in the implementation\r\nof democracy in various situations.\r\nWe strove to reach consensus on the Declaration\r\nand Plan of Action and find ways for democracies to\r\nachieve peace, social progress and development.\r\nAmong these ways are the following. First, democracy\r\nis a style, a means and not an end in itself — a means\r\nfor achieving social peace, stability and well-being. As\r\nsuch, it can develop according to the characteristics,\r\npriorities and circumstances of a given society.\r\nConsequently, democracy is not one single form and\r\ncannot be applied as a uniform formula. Secondly, the\r\nchallenges that the new and restored democracies face\r\ndiffer greatly, but the biggest challenge is development\r\nin its universal sense.\r\nPolitical stability is vital for democracy and\r\neconomic growth. We need to encourage participation\r\nand eliminate all feelings of injustice, oppression and\r\nmarginalization. That is the best way to prevent all\r\ndestructive acts, such as terrorism and coups d’état.\r\nThirdly, my country reaffirms the importance of\r\ninternational cooperation to support new and restored\r\ndemocracies and their efforts for democratic\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\ndevelopment. Needless to say, spreading and\r\nimplementing democratic principles helps further the\r\nrational process of decision-making. Democracy\r\npromotes healthy, peaceful, balanced relations of\r\nmutual respect between States. No one can deny that\r\ndemocratic forums for expressing public opinion and\r\ncontributing to general policies make an important\r\ncontribution to meeting various challenges.\r\nThe Fifth International Conference emphasized\r\nthe importance of civil society’s role in the democratic\r\nprocess. We believe it is important to create a regional\r\nassociation bringing together civil society\r\norganizations. The exchange of ideas and experiences\r\nwill have positive results for all, especially in our Arab\r\nregion, where countries share a similar political,\r\nhistorical and cultural experience.\r\nIn conclusion, we are satisfied with the Plan of\r\nAction put forward by the Fifth International\r\nConference. We support it and believe that it should be\r\nimplemented, no matter how ambitious it might appear.\r\nIts implementation will further our common aspirations\r\nto strengthen democracy, not only in the relationship\r\nbetween the governed and the governing, but also in\r\nrelationships among all human beings.\r\nMr. Sevilla Somoza (Nicaragua) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): It is an honour to speak on behalf of the\r\ncountries of the Central American Integration System,\r\nBelize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,\r\nPanama, Dominican Republic and my own country,\r\nNicaragua. I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\r\noutstanding work as you preside over the work of this\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nFirst, I wish to thank the Secretary-General for\r\nhis comprehensive report on the question under\r\nconsideration, contained in document A/58/392. We\r\nalso thank the Government of Mongolia and the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Mongolia,\r\nMr. Luvsangiin Erdenechuluun, President of the Fifth\r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies, for the excellent manner in which the\r\nConference was conducted, in Ulaanbaatar from 10 to\r\n12 September this year.\r\nI wish to underline the enormous growth of the\r\nmovement of new and restored democracies over the\r\n15 years since the first Conference in Manila, which\r\nwas attended by only 13 States. Participation at the\r\nManagua Conference increased to 77 States, and an\r\nunprecedented 119 States attended the Fifth\r\nConference. That gives us an idea of the importance\r\nGovernments the world over attach to democracy.\r\nThe Fifth International Conference of New or\r\nRestored Democracies established an ambitious follow-\r\nup plan for the implementation of its recommendations\r\nat the national, regional and international levels and\r\nprovided for the decisive role in future work of the\r\nfollow-up mechanism established at the third\r\nConference in Bucharest.\r\nThe Declaration of Ulaanbaatar contains a set of\r\nrecommendations on democracy, good governance and\r\ncivil society. It covers a set of steps for Governments to\r\nfollow with respect to checks and balances on authority\r\nin order to prevent abuse and strengthen the promotion\r\nand protection of human rights, equality of men and\r\nwomen and respect for the rule of law. The Declaration\r\nalso calls for international compliance with\r\ninternational instruments for human rights and\r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nGovernment actions are legitimate when they are\r\nbased on the will of the citizens, seek their active\r\nparticipation, foster human security and provide\r\nopportunities to express dissent by non-violent means.\r\nThe Declaration also condemns all acts of\r\nterrorism, recommends strengthening international\r\nefforts to combat international terrorism and underlines\r\nthe need to reinforce international cooperation to\r\nprevent and combat terrorism, including measures to\r\nalleviate factors fostering and supporting extremism\r\nand violence.\r\nDemocracy must be a source for unity, not for\r\ndivision. Because of its evolving nature, we cannot\r\nexpect the implementation of democracy to take place\r\nin conformity with a universal model. However, every\r\nnation has the responsibility to act according to a set of\r\nshared common values, such as freedom of\r\nrepresentation, respect for human rights and respect for\r\nthe principles contained in the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights.\r\nThe Declaration of Ulaanbaatar supports six basic\r\nprinciples of democracy, which are to be applied in\r\naccordance with international and national plans of\r\naction adopted at the Conference. Those principles\r\ninclude a set of norms to ensure their implementation.\r\nWe, the countries of the Central American\r\nIntegration System wish to underline the importance of\r\nthe United Nations system’s support for the countries\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\nbelonging to the movement of new or restored\r\ndemocracies in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia\r\nand Africa, many of which have recently emerged from\r\ncivil war or internal conflict. The assistance of the\r\nUnited Nations and donor countries encompasses\r\nvarious aspects, from the reform of the State and its\r\ninstitutions, with particular emphasis on the holding of\r\nfree elections and respect for human rights, to the\r\nconstruction of a dynamic civil society based on\r\nfreedom of expression and organization and a political\r\nculture encouraging participation and political debate.\r\nThe link between democracy and development\r\nhas been given broad recognition through time. The\r\nmarch of democracy, just like the reduction of poverty,\r\nhas been a long process. But we believe that democracy\r\nmust be a tool for the reduction of poverty, and this is\r\nwhy we urge all the nations of the world to endeavour\r\nto reach the goals of the Millennium Declaration.\r\nOne question of particular concern to the\r\ndeveloping countries is the link between globalization\r\nand democratization, because globalization, while\r\nproviding new opportunities, also has negative effects\r\nthat are especially magnified in the poorest countries. It\r\nis worrisome that in the past 10 years, the share of\r\nglobal wealth that corresponds to the poorest fifth of\r\nthe world’s population has declined from 2.3 per cent\r\nto 1.4 per cent of total global wealth. From a political\r\nstandpoint, we are concerned about the effects of\r\nglobalization on the sovereignty of States, on\r\ndemocracy and on developing countries’ citizens.\r\nDemocracy is a process of painstaking and\r\nconstant effort and constitutes the form of government\r\nthat, to date, has best responded to the needs of peoples\r\nand that most adequately helps fulfil their development\r\npotential. This is why we must seek a new regulatory\r\nframework for economic relations that mitigates the\r\nnegative effects of globalization on the developing\r\ncountries. This would help us avoid the difficulties and\r\nobstacles that weaken the consolidation of democratic\r\nprocesses.\r\nIn spite of all the adversities on the road to\r\ndemocracy, we know that we are not alone in our\r\nstruggle. Let us be guided by our shared objective of\r\ngood governance in the twenty-first century, ensuring\r\nthat by exercising democracy we can build a better\r\nworld.\r\nMr. Gatan (Philippines): The agenda item before\r\nus has always been of special importance to the\r\nPhilippines, not only because it was the first country to\r\norganize and host the International Conference of New\r\nor Restored Democracies, but, more importantly,\r\nbecause it recognizes that a lack of external support for\r\nthe new and restored democracies can aggravate the\r\ncontinuing threats of destabilization that face them.\r\nMy delegation is heartened to note that, from the\r\nhandful of countries that participated in the Conference\r\nin Manila in June 1988, the number of participants has\r\nincreased to 119 countries at the Conference held in\r\nUlaanbaatar, Mongolia, last September. The\r\nConference was also attended by a number of United\r\nNations agencies, as well as non-governmental groups.\r\nThis universal participation in the Conference\r\nattests to the growing importance the international\r\ncommunity has given to promoting and consolidating\r\nnew or restored democracies. We therefore commend\r\nthe Government and the people of Mongolia for the\r\nsuccessful management of the Fifth Conference, which\r\nwas marked by two parallel events: the civil society\r\nconferences and the conferences of the international\r\nparliamentarians.\r\nMy delegation further commends the Government\r\nof Mongolia for bringing together partners from civil\r\nsociety at the Fifth International Conference. My\r\ndelegation is likewise pleased by the positive report of\r\nthe Secretary-General (A/58/392) on the recently\r\nconcluded Conference and its themes: democracy, good\r\ngovernance and civil society.\r\nIt may be recalled that the origin of this\r\nconsultative process among new or restored\r\ndemocracies was precipitated by the need to share\r\nexperiences in the management of Governments\r\nheretofore inexperienced in democratic processes with\r\nfledgling democratic institutions.\r\nAs the consultative process progressed, until the\r\nlast Conference in Mongolia, like-minded countries\r\nhave realized that self-help is not sufficient to ensure\r\ntheir long-term stability. The Ulaanbaatar Conference\r\nhas demonstrated the urgency of involving non-\r\ngovernmental partners to strengthen new or restored\r\ndemocratic Governments. Civil society, international\r\nparliamentarians, donor Governments and the United\r\nNations system are indeed vital partners in this\r\ncollective endeavour.\r\nThe Philippines strongly endorses the adoption by\r\nconsensus of the draft resolution to be presented by\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\nMongolia under agenda item 20. As it has done in the\r\npast, it will again sponsor this draft. As spelled out in\r\nthe operative part of the draft resolution, the\r\nPhilippines will again invite the Secretary-General to\r\nexamine options for strengthening the support provided\r\nby the United Nations system to the efforts of Member\r\nStates to consolidate democracy, including by setting\r\nup a working group to explore ways to make the\r\nConference and its follow-up more effective and\r\nefficient.\r\nIn conclusion, conferences may become academic\r\nexercises if their recommendations are not acted upon\r\nor if their agreed commitments not carried out. In this\r\nlight, my delegation welcomes the initiative mentioned\r\nearlier by His Excellency the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Mongolia for inter-conference follow-up\r\nactivities, in which the Philippines will actively\r\nparticipate.\r\nIt would also be extremely useful if the outcome\r\nof the Ulaanbaatar Conference, consisting of the\r\nUlaanbaatar Declaration and Plan of Action on\r\nDemocracy, Good Governance and Civil Society, could\r\nbe disseminated to Governments and concerned sectors\r\nof civil society through the existing information and\r\ncommunication resources of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Mekprayoonthong (Thailand): My\r\ndelegation wishes to thank the Secretary-General for\r\nhis report on the support by the United Nations system\r\nof the efforts of Governments to promote and\r\nconsolidate new or restored democracies. We have\r\nlearned with appreciation that the support provided has\r\nbeen increased over the years. This necessary support\r\nhas contributed to the promotion of the core values of\r\ndemocracy, good governance, the rule of law,\r\naccountability and participation of the people at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels.\r\nWe also acknowledge with appreciation the\r\nincreasingly important role of the United Nations in\r\nproviding assistance to States, especially in the area of\r\nelectoral processes and institution-building in post-\r\nconflict situations.\r\nMy delegation wishes to express our appreciation\r\nto the host Government of Mongolia for its warm\r\nhospitality accorded to delegations participating in the\r\nFifth International Conference of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies, held in Ulaanbaatar from 10 to 12\r\nSeptember 2003. We wish also to commend the\r\nGovernment of Mongolia for its excellent organization\r\nof the Conference.\r\nThe fact that the Conference attracted 119\r\nparticipating countries and a large number of\r\nrepresentatives of civil society as well as\r\nparliamentarians proves that democracy is indeed the\r\nmost widely accepted form of governance for\r\nguaranteeing an inclusive and participatory society\r\nwhich promotes and protects the human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms of peoples.\r\nThailand is among the 30-odd countries that had\r\nministerial-level representation at the Fifth\r\nInternational Conference. The President of the Thai\r\nParliament also led a group of parliamentarians who\r\nparticipated in the Parliamentary Forum, held in\r\nparallel with the Conference. We believe that,\r\nconsidering the particularities inherent in different\r\nsocieties, it would be beneficial for countries to share\r\nbest practices in order to enrich the democratization\r\nprocess. My delegation therefore finds the innovations\r\nproposed by both the Parliamentary Forum and the\r\ninteractive civil society forum highly constructive,\r\nespecially in promoting greater understanding and\r\npartnership among Governments, parliaments, civil\r\nsociety and the United Nations system. We support the\r\ncontinuation of those innovative arrangements at future\r\nConferences.\r\nMy delegation believes that democracy is only a\r\nmeans to an end — the well-being of our peoples. The\r\nconsolidation of democracy would have a direct impact\r\non the promotion of human rights and of human\r\nsecurity for peoples, which would enable them to\r\nachieve both freedom from want and freedom from\r\nfear.\r\nGood governance is an essential element of a\r\ndemocratic society. All sectors of society should strive\r\nto cultivate a culture of accountability, transparency\r\nand respect for the rule of law in all their undertakings.\r\nBased on our experience, the Thai Government\r\nplaces a strong emphasis on the “outside-in” approach\r\nin its policy formulation and implementation. That\r\ncitizen-centred approach integrates the wishes of the\r\npeople “outside” the Government into its policy\r\nplatform and the implementation thereof. Moreover, it\r\nis consistent with our national economic and social\r\ndevelopment policies, which place people at the centre\r\nof development. Transparency and an approach that\r\nencourages participation by the people have proved\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\neffective in better serving the interests and needs of the\r\npeople, thereby contributing to the country\u0027s economic\r\nprosperity and social stability.\r\nAt the international level, Thailand has been\r\nactively involved in laying a strong foundation for a\r\ndemocracy based on a pluralistic political system by\r\nplaying host to the Second International Conference of\r\nAsian Political Parties, held in Bangkok in November\r\n2002. The Conference successfully brought together\r\nboth government and opposition parties from most\r\nAsian countries to share their views, experiences and\r\nbest practices in addressing the needs of peoples.\r\nMy delegation attaches great importance to the\r\nfinal report, Declaration and Plan of Action which were\r\nadopted by consensus during the Fifth International\r\nConference. We are fully committed to implementing\r\nthe measures and actions contained in the Declaration\r\nand the Plan of Action.\r\nAs the promotion of democratization and good\r\ngovernance would reinforce national efforts towards\r\nsocial and economic development and contribute to\r\ninternational peace, security and stability, it is crucial\r\nfor all parties concerned to devote particular attention\r\nand redouble their efforts to follow up on what was\r\nagreed by consensus at the Fifth International\r\nConference.\r\nMr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan): My delegation\r\nattaches great importance to the agenda item under\r\nconsideration today. Since the First International\r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies, held at\r\nManila, a unique and substantive contribution has been\r\nmade towards the building of democratic societies.\r\nKazakhstan commends the Governments of Benin,\r\nMongolia, Nicaragua, Romania and the Philippines for\r\nhaving organized the International Conferences on\r\nNew or Restored Democracies. Those forums have\r\nprovided the opportunity for an extensive exchange of\r\nviews and have laid the groundwork for the further\r\nconsolidation of new or restored democracies.\r\nKazakhstan believes that peace, democracy and\r\ndevelopment are fundamentally linked, and that the\r\nrespect of human rights, equality between men and\r\nwomen, and the fight against all forms of\r\ndiscrimination are inalienable elements of democracy.\r\nMy delegation fully supports the view expressed by\r\nother delegations that there is no alternative to\r\ndemocracy if the rule of law and respect for human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms are to be maintained.\r\nWe thank the Government of Mongolia for its\r\nsuccessful hosting of the Fifth International Conference\r\nof New or Restored Democracies in Ulaanbaatar from\r\n10 to 12 September 2003. The wide, high-level\r\nrepresentation at that Conference demonstrated the\r\nglobal commitment to promote the democratization\r\nprocess at the national, regional and international\r\nlevels.\r\nThis is clear evidence of the aspiration of all\r\npeoples to an international order which is based on the\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter. We hope that\r\nthe General Assembly will give its support to the\r\nrecommendations of the Fifth International Conference\r\nin order further to consolidate democracy nationally,\r\nregionally and internationally.\r\nWe wish to express our appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/58/392), which\r\nprovides a comprehensive overview of the efforts of\r\nthe United Nations system in that field. We recognize\r\nthe multifaceted assistance provided by the United\r\nNations to new or restored democracies.\r\nFor a number of years the Organization has been\r\nhelping to build and reform national institutions and to\r\nstrengthen the capacity of legislatures in new or\r\nrestored democracies. Many activities have been\r\ncarried out by the United Nations in the area of State\r\nreform, focusing on human rights protection. Attention\r\nalso has been given to democracy as a key component\r\nof United Nations peace missions.\r\nHowever, despite the encouraging efforts made in\r\nthat field, we are facing new challenges in promoting\r\ndemocracy worldwide. The terrorist attack on the\r\nUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad on 19 August\r\n2003 has once again demonstrated how vulnerable and\r\nfragile the world is.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations must play an\r\neffective role in promoting and strengthening\r\ndemocracies worldwide and in creating a security\r\nenvironment for democracies in which peace,\r\nprosperity and sustainable development are guaranteed.\r\nIn the 12 years of Kazakhstan’s independence,\r\nsome dramatic changes have taken place.\r\nAccomplishments in economic and political areas\r\ndetermine the present and future of our State. But the\r\ngreatest accomplishment has been in the changed\r\nmentality of people who have embraced democratic\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\nreforms, have put their trust in those reforms and have\r\nbecome their active promoters.\r\nUnlike many other countries where democracy\r\nhas been built on the basis of a developed civil society,\r\nwe are building, all at once, democracy, civil society\r\nand the State. Along with economic reforms, we have\r\nbeen changing the political system. The role of civil\r\nsociety institutions has been enhanced considerably.\r\nPolitical parties and movements and independent media\r\nhave become important actors in the social life of our\r\ncountry.\r\nActivities of non-governmental organizations to\r\npromote democratic principles in society deserve\r\nspecial mention. To a large extent, their activities\r\ncontribute to the promotion of liberal values, improved\r\npolitical education of the population and the\r\ndevelopment of democracy. International and foreign\r\norganizations that supported Kazakhstan during the\r\ndifficult early years of our independence and continue\r\nto support it now should be given a lot of credit.\r\nKazakhstan has been implementing a\r\ndemocratization programme to ensure full respect of\r\nhuman rights and personal freedoms and prevent any\r\nforms of discrimination. A permanent conference to\r\ndraft proposals on further democratization and\r\ndevelopment of civil society has contributed to the\r\nenhancement of democratic processes in the country.\r\nTo find the right balance in the relationship\r\nbetween institutions of State power and the individual,\r\nan office of Ombudsman was established in\r\nKazakhstan. In other words, liberal reforms and\r\ndemocratic processes in Kazakhstan have become\r\nirreversible. The political course of our country is well-\r\ndefined and clear: sustained growth of the market\r\neconomy, internal stability, democracy and the rule of\r\nlaw.\r\nWe will be able to achieve our strategic\r\nobjectives along the road to the prosperity of our\r\ncountry and well-being of our people only through\r\njoint and well-focused efforts based on a continued\r\ndialogue between all members of society enjoying\r\nequal rights.\r\nThe United Nations system provides an excellent\r\nopportunity for Member States to work together in\r\ncreating a genuine democratic culture. Kazakhstan is\r\ndedicated to a coordinated strategy of the United\r\nNations for promoting democracy, development and\r\npeace and stands ready to contribute to this process.\r\nMr. Requeijo Gual (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nFirst, we want to express our thanks to and\r\ncongratulate the Government of Mongolia for having\r\norganized the Fifth International Conference of New or\r\nRestored Democracies and for its endeavour to ensure\r\nthe broadest possible participation in that event. It was\r\nMongolia’s intention to organize a pluralistic, inclusive\r\nand participatory event and this is why an\r\nunprecedented number of States attended in\r\nUlaanbaatar — 119 in all. It is a fact that this\r\nmovement has been gaining in maturity. Its main\r\naccomplishment has been its increasingly inclusive\r\nnature, making it very different from other processes of\r\ndubious origin that are selective and exclusive in\r\nnature.\r\nThe movement of new or restored democracies\r\nhas not endeavoured to impose any dogma or single\r\nvision of democracy. On the contrary, it has been a\r\nplace to meet for debate and reflection on a topic that,\r\nsince the days of ancient Greece, has aroused the\r\ninterest of men and women.\r\nThe Ulaanbaatar Conference discussed, inter alia,\r\ntwo topics of particular importance and timeliness —\r\nunilateralism as a threat to democracy and the\r\noligopolistic control of the information media. The\r\nConference discussed the appropriateness of the\r\nestablishment of an alliance among Governments, civil\r\nsociety and the United Nations to counteract any new\r\ntendency towards unilateralism. There is no task more\r\nurgent or more important than the democratization of\r\ninternational relations if we really want to help the\r\nefforts of many peoples to consolidate their democratic\r\nsystems.\r\nThe movement of the so-called new or restored\r\ndemocracies can be an opportunity for an exchange of\r\nviews and to support the efforts of many peoples to\r\nconsolidate their democratic systems, if broad\r\nparticipation and a plurality of viewpoints in the debate\r\non democracy is ensured, and if unrestricted respect for\r\nthe principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter\r\nis preserved.\r\nAs Cuba sees it, the very essence of democracy is\r\nthe power of the people. This encompasses the exercise\r\nof authority and decision-making in the political\r\nsphere, as well as in the economic, social and cultural\r\nspheres. Nonetheless, at the international level there\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.57\r\nhas been a strong attempt to establish a single pattern\r\nof democracy and governance. The so-called bourgeois\r\nliberal democracy that would seem to have functioned,\r\nwith grave limitations, in the Western countries, has\r\nproven its inoperability in other contexts. It would not\r\nbe possible to successfully defend the hypothesis of its\r\nuniversal superiority. Today, as in the times of the\r\ngreatest obscurantism in the history of humankind, an\r\nattempt is being made to condemn and punish all of\r\nthose who will not tolerate and who dissent from its\r\ndogmas. In attempts to impose and restrict civil and\r\npolitical rights as the foundations of democracy, it has\r\nbeen forgotten that democracy is, first and foremost,\r\ngovernment by the people, for the people and of the\r\npeople. Democracy means real and daily participation\r\nin the exercise of power and in decision-making in all\r\nspheres of society. It cannot exist without freedom and\r\nwithout participation of the people, without social\r\njustice, without individual and collective well-being or\r\nwithout human solidarity. Sovereignty resides in the\r\npeople and without national independence there is no\r\nsovereignty. Without the exercise of economic and\r\nsocial rights, there can be no democracy. A genuine\r\ndemocracy should not institutionalize the defence of\r\nthe wealthiest and the most privileged to the detriment\r\nof those who are most in need.\r\nA multi-party system does not mean democracy,\r\nnor does democracy require, as a prerequisite, the\r\nexistence of a multi-party system. There are quite a few\r\ncases where political parties abound, and yet there is no\r\ndemocracy and no participation by the people — where\r\nabstention is the main elector. In such a model,\r\npatronage, tyranny, vote-buying, electoral fraud,\r\ncorruption, profiteering and favouritism, among other\r\nevils, have spread.\r\nWithin the industrialized and wealthy world,\r\nthere are many citizens who call into question the\r\nmodel of liberal democracy that some wish to impose.\r\nThey feel they have no participation in the decision-\r\nmaking processes, that they are manipulated by\r\ncampaigns and by the communications media, and that\r\nthe model is elitist and the political parties and\r\npoliticians are of poor calibre and do not fulfil their\r\nelectoral promises.\r\nWe are also concerned about the growing\r\nlimitations that are being imposed on the exercise of\r\nthe most fundamental civil and political rights of a\r\nlarge group of countries of the first world under the\r\npretext that these are part of the fight against terrorism.\r\nThis was a particularly important concern in the\r\nframework of the Conference.\r\nCuba is proud that it has a profoundly popular\r\nand participatory democracy, without electoral parties\r\nas political intermediaries. It is a democracy in which\r\nthe people exercise power and in which individual and\r\ncollective well-being and solidarity are fundamental. In\r\nmy country, governmental institutions were established\r\nwith the broadest possible popular participation and\r\ncontrol. Our own experience is the result of our history.\r\nIn Cuba all citizens over the age of 16 have the\r\nright to vote and thus to elect and be elected to office.\r\nThe nomination of candidates is made directly by the\r\nvoters in public assemblies instead of through political\r\nparties. There are no discriminatory million-dollar,\r\ndefamatory, manipulated electoral campaigns. There is\r\ntotal honesty and transparency in elections, and this\r\nincludes the public tallying of votes, with the possible\r\nparticipation of the national and foreign press, of\r\ndiplomats, tourists and whoever wishes to observe. All\r\nthose elected must be elected by a majority. Elections\r\nare free, equal and secret. All representatives of the\r\nState are elected for renewable terms. All those elected\r\nare held accountable for their actions, and can be\r\nrecalled at any time. Deputies and delegates earn no\r\nsalaries. Historically, as much as 95 per cent of the\r\nelectorate have participated in elections.\r\nOn a final note, we must observe that the\r\nlimitations, problems and challenges of democracy are\r\npresent in one form or another in both the North and in\r\nthe South.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
