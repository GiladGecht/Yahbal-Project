Hunte. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by the President\r\nThe President: This general debate of the fifty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly takes place at a\r\ntime of enormous challenges for the United Nations.\r\nThe participation of a significant number of heads of\r\nState and Government in the debate sends a strong\r\nmessage of support for the United Nations and\r\nreaffirms to the people of the world that their leaders\r\nare at the forefront of international efforts to address\r\nthe broad range of issues of importance to them. As\r\nPresident of the fifty-eighth session, the presence of\r\nworld leaders here is encouraging to me.\r\nSome 58 years on, recent unfolding, and often\r\ntragic, developments worldwide pose a serious\r\nchallenge for the United Nations, and particularly for\r\nthe General Assembly. That is particularly so in the\r\nareas enshrined in the Charter as the Organizations\r\nprimary objectives: the promotion of economic and\r\nsocial advancement, tolerance and peace and the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\r\nincluding collective security. Lately, we have engaged\r\nin a process of self-searching and re-examination,\r\nlooking, for example, at the goals we have set for\r\nourselves in the economic and social fields and at our\r\nefforts to keep peace in the world. Reform and\r\nrevitalization of our Organization is key to the success\r\nof our initiatives, and thus is among the issues we are\r\nreviewing.\r\nThe safety and security of United Nations\r\npersonnel has high priority, and has taken on renewed\r\nurgency following yet another attack on the United\r\nNations in Baghdad. As we express our sympathy over\r\nyet more loss of life and injury, I wish to assure the\r\nSecretary-General of our continuing support for his\r\nefforts to protect United Nations staff.\r\nOur achievements over the past decade are\r\nunquestionable, but many of our initiatives are useful\r\nonly if they lead to concrete action. We the Member\r\nStates of the General Assembly are partners, and must\r\nwork cooperatively to ensure that urgent and necessary\r\naction is taken to implement those initiatives, if we are\r\nto remain relevant. In doing so, I believe it to be in our\r\nbest interests to be consistent in our respect for the\r\nCharter and for international law, to demonstrate by our\r\naction that the General Assembly has not only the\r\ncapacity but also the political will to constructively\r\naddress and resolve the complex problems of the world\r\nand to close the gap between our agreed objectives and\r\nthe resources needed to implement them.\r\nThe General Assembly has oversight of the\r\nUnited Nations system as a whole, and hence has\r\nbefore it the full range of international issues. As\r\nadvocate, supervisor and policy-making body, it must\r\ngive the direction necessary to ensure coherence in the\r\nsystem, so that the Organization may respond in a\r\nholistic manner to the many challenges it faces. Heads\r\nof State and Government must bring new dynamism to\r\nthe General Assembly during this session. The political\r\ndirection that they will provide will be key to enabling\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nthe Assembly effectively to address critical issues such\r\nas sustainable development, poverty alleviation,\r\nviolation of human rights and fundamental freedoms,\r\nterrorism, and United Nations reform. This is the\r\ndirection we need for the entire year of this session,\r\nincluding from January to September 2004, for it is\r\nduring this less intensive second part of the session, so\r\nto speak, that we can look more reflectively at the\r\ndecisions we have taken in the fall and begin the\r\ncritical task of implementation and other aspects of the\r\nAssemblys work.\r\nWe all know the problems. I will be looking to\r\nheads of State and Government and to other high-level\r\nparticipants in this general debate for their advice on\r\nhow best we may arrive at the solutions.\r\nIn accordance with the decision taken at its 2nd\r\nplenary meeting, on 19 September 2003, the General\r\nAssembly will hear a presentation by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of his annual report on the work of the\r\nOrganization under agenda item 10 of the provisional\r\nagenda.\r\nI give the floor to the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General (spoke in French): The\r\nlast 12 months have been very painful for those of us\r\nwho believe in collective answers to our common\r\nproblems and challenges.\r\nIn many countries, terrorism has once again\r\nbrought death and suffering to innocent people. In the\r\nMiddle East, and in certain parts of Africa, violence\r\nhas continued to escalate. On the Korean peninsula and\r\nelsewhere, the threat of nuclear proliferation casts an\r\nominous shadow across the landscape. And barely one\r\nmonth ago, in Baghdad, the United Nations itself\r\nsuffered a brutal and deliberate assault, in which the\r\ninternational community lost some of its most talented\r\nservants. Yesterday the United Nations was again\r\nattacked, and it was only because of prompt action by\r\nthe Iraqi police that another major disaster was averted.\r\nUnfortunately, an Iraqi policeman lost his life.\r\nOn this occasion, I wish to convey my most\r\nsincere condolences to the family of that brave police\r\nofficer. But I am thinking also of the 19 people,\r\nincluding local United Nations staff, who were injured\r\nin the attack. I wish them all a swift recovery, and I\r\nhope that all those who have been injured or were\r\nkilled in the war  soldiers and innocent civilians \r\nwill remain in our prayers.\r\nIn this context, I deplore  as all present here do\r\nas well, I am sure  the brutal attack that nearly killed\r\nMs. Akila al-Hashemi, a member of the Governing\r\nCouncil. I pray, too, for her swift recovery.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nExcellencies, the United Nations is you. You are\r\nthe United Nations. The staff who were killed or\r\ninjured in the attack on our Baghdad headquarters were\r\nyour staff. You had given them a mandate to assist the\r\nsuffering Iraqi people and to help them recover their\r\nsovereignty.\r\nIn future  not only in Iraq but wherever the\r\nUnited Nations is engaged  we must take more\r\neffective measures to protect the security of our staff. I\r\ncount on your full support  legal, political and\r\nfinancial.\r\nMeanwhile, let me reaffirm the great importance I\r\nattach to a successful outcome in Iraq. Whatever view\r\neach of us may take of the events of recent months, it is\r\nvital for all of us that the outcome be a stable and\r\ndemocratic Iraq, at peace with itself and with its\r\nneighbours, and contributing to stability in the region.\r\nSubject to satisfactory security considerations,\r\nthe United Nations system is prepared to play its full\r\nrole in working for a satisfactory outcome in Iraq, and\r\nto do so as part of an international effort  an effort by\r\nthe whole international community  pulling together\r\non the basis of a sound and viable policy. If it takes\r\nextra time and patience to forge a policy that is\r\ncollective, coherent and workable, then I, for one,\r\nwould regard that time as well spent. Indeed, this is\r\nhow we must approach all the many pressing crises that\r\nconfront us today.\r\nThree years ago, when you came here for the\r\nMillennium Summit, we shared a vision of global\r\nsolidarity and security, expressed in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. But recent events have called that\r\nconsensus into question.\r\nAll of us know that there are new threats that\r\nmust be faced  or, perhaps, old threats in new and\r\ndangerous combinations: new forms of terrorism and\r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nBut while some consider these threats as self-\r\nevidently the main challenge to world peace and\r\nsecurity, others feel more immediately menaced by\r\nsmall arms employed in civil conflict, or by so-called\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nsoft threats such as the persistence of extreme\r\npoverty, the disparity of income between and within\r\nsocieties, the spread of infectious diseases, or climate\r\nchange and environmental degradation.\r\nIn truth, we do not have to choose. The\r\nUnited Nations must confront all these threats and\r\nchallenges  new and old, hard and soft. It must\r\nbe fully engaged in the struggle for development and\r\nfor poverty eradication, starting with the achievement\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals; in the joint\r\nstruggle to protect our common environment; and in\r\nthe struggle for human rights, democracy and good\r\ngovernance.\r\nIn fact, all these struggles are linked. We now see,\r\nwith chilling clarity, that a world in which many\r\nmillions of people endure brutal oppression and\r\nextreme misery will never be fully secure, even for its\r\nmost privileged inhabitants.\r\nYet the hard threats, such as terrorism and\r\nweapons of mass destruction, are real and cannot be\r\nignored. Terrorism is not a problem only for rich\r\ncountries. Ask the people of Bali, Bombay, Nairobi or\r\nCasablanca. Weapons of mass destruction do not\r\nthreaten only the western or northern world. Ask the\r\npeople of Iran, or of Halabja, in Iraq.\r\nWhere we disagree, it seems, is on how to\r\nrespond to these threats. Since this Organization was\r\nfounded, States have generally sought to deal with\r\nthreats to the peace through containment and\r\ndeterrence, by a system based on collective security\r\nand on the United Nations Charter. Article 51 of the\r\nCharter prescribes that all States, if attacked, retain the\r\ninherent right of self-defence. But until now it has been\r\nunderstood that when States go beyond that and decide\r\nto use force to deal with broader threats to international\r\npeace and security, they need the unique legitimacy\r\nprovided by the United Nations.\r\nNow, some say this understanding is no longer\r\ntenable, since an armed attack with weapons of mass\r\ndestruction could be launched at any time, without\r\nwarning, or by a clandestine group. Rather than wait\r\nfor that to happen, they argue, States have the right and\r\nobligation to use force pre-emptively, even on the\r\nterritory of other States, and even while the weapons\r\nsystems that might be used to attack them are still\r\nbeing developed. According to this argument, States\r\nare not obliged to wait until there is agreement in the\r\nSecurity Council. Instead, they reserve the right to act\r\nunilaterally, or in ad hoc coalitions.\r\nThis logic represents a fundamental challenge to\r\nthe principles on which, however imperfectly, world\r\npeace and stability have rested for the last fifty-eight\r\nyears. My concern is that, if it were to be adopted, it\r\nwould set precedents that resulted in a proliferation of\r\nthe unilateral and lawless use of force, with or without\r\njustification.\r\nBut it is not enough to denounce unilateralism,\r\nunless we also face up squarely to the concerns that\r\nmake some States feel uniquely vulnerable, since it is\r\nthose concerns that drive them to take unilateral action.\r\nWe must show that those concerns can, and will, be\r\naddressed effectively through collective action.\r\nWe have come to a fork in the road. This may be\r\na moment no less decisive than in 1945 itself, when the\r\nUnited Nations was founded. At that time, a group of\r\nfar-sighted leaders, led and inspired by President\r\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, were determined to make the\r\nsecond half of the twentieth century different from the\r\nfirst half. They saw that the human race had only one\r\nworld to live in, and that unless it managed its affairs\r\nprudently, all human beings might perish. So they drew\r\nup rules to govern international behaviour and founded\r\na network of institutions, with the United Nations at its\r\ncentre, in which the peoples of the world could work\r\ntogether for the common good.\r\nNow we must decide whether it is possible to\r\ncontinue on the basis agreed then, or whether radical\r\nchanges are needed. And we must not shy away from\r\nquestions about the adequacy and effectiveness of the\r\nrules and instruments at our disposal.\r\nAmong those instruments, none is more important\r\nthan the Security Council itself. In my recent report on\r\nthe implementation of the Millennium Declaration, I\r\ndrew attention to the urgent need for the Council to\r\nregain the confidence of States and of world public\r\nopinion  both by demonstrating its ability to deal\r\neffectively with the most difficult issues and by\r\nbecoming more broadly representative of the\r\ninternational community as a whole as well as the\r\ngeopolitical realities of today.\r\nThe Council needs to consider how it will deal\r\nwith the possibility that individual States may use force\r\npre-emptively against perceived threats. Its members\r\nmay need to begin a discussion on the criteria for an\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nearly authorization of coercive measures to address\r\ncertain types of threats  for instance, terrorist groups\r\narmed with weapons of mass destruction. And they still\r\nneed to engage in serious discussion of the best way to\r\nrespond to threats of genocide or other comparable\r\nmassive violations of human rights  an issue which I\r\nraised myself from this podium in 1999. Once again,\r\nthis year, our collective response to events of this\r\ntype  in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nin Liberia  has been hesitant and tardy.\r\nAs for the composition of the Council, which has\r\nbeen on the agenda of the Assembly for over a decade,\r\nvirtually all Member States agree that the Council\r\nshould be enlarged, but there is no agreement on the\r\ndetails.\r\nI respectfully suggest to you, Excellencies, that in\r\nthe eyes of your peoples the difficulty of reaching\r\nagreement does not excuse your failure to do so. If you\r\nwant the Council and the Councils decisions to\r\ncommand greater respect, particularly in the\r\ndeveloping world, you need to address the issue of its\r\ncomposition with greater urgency.\r\nBut the Security Council is not the only\r\ninstitution that needs strengthening. As you know, I am\r\ndoing my best to make the Secretariat more effective,\r\nand I look to this Assembly to support my efforts.\r\nIndeed, in my report I also suggested that this\r\nAssembly itself needs to be strengthened, and that the\r\nrole of the Economic and Social Council  and the\r\nrole of the United Nations as a whole in economic and\r\nsocial affairs, including its relationship to the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions-needs to be rethought and\r\nreinvigorated. I even suggested that the role of the\r\nTrusteeship Council could be reviewed, in the light of\r\nnew kinds of responsibility that you have given to the\r\nUnited Nations in recent years.\r\nIn short, I believe the time is ripe for a hard look\r\nat fundamental policy issues and at the structural\r\nchanges that may be needed in order to strengthen\r\nthem. History is a harsh judge: it will not forgive us if\r\nwe let this moment pass.\r\nFor my part, I intend to establish a high-level\r\npanel of eminent personalities to which I will assign\r\nfour tasks: first, to examine current challenges to peace\r\nand security; second, to consider the contribution\r\nwhich collective action can make in addressing these\r\nchallenges; third, to review the functioning of major\r\norgans of the United Nations and the relationship\r\nbetween them; and fourth, to recommend ways of\r\nstrengthening the United Nations, through reform of its\r\ninstitutions and processes. The panel will focus\r\nprimarily on threats to peace and security. But it will\r\nalso need to examine other global challenges, insofar\r\nas these may influence or connect with those threats.\r\nI will ask the panel to report back to me before\r\nthe beginning of the next session of the General\r\nAssembly so that I can make recommendations to you\r\nat that session. But only you can take the firm and clear\r\ndecisions that will be needed. Those decisions might\r\ninclude far-reaching institutional reforms. Indeed, I\r\nhope they will.\r\nBut institutional reforms alone will not suffice.\r\nEven the most perfect instrument will fail, unless\r\npeople put it to good use.\r\nThe United Nations is by no means a perfect\r\ninstrument, but it is a precious one. I urge you to seek\r\nagreement on ways of improving it, but above all of\r\nusing it as its founders intended: to save succeeding\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war, to reaffirm faith\r\nin fundamental human rights, to re-establish the basic\r\nconditions for justice and the rule of law, and to\r\npromote social progress and better standards of life in\r\nlarger freedom.\r\nThe world may have changed, but those aims are\r\nas valid and urgent as ever. We must keep them firmly\r\nin our sights.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General for\r\nhis presentation.\r\nAgenda item 9\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the\r\nfirst speaker for this morning, I should like to remind\r\nmembers that the list of speakers was created on the\r\nbasis that statements will have a time limit of up to 15\r\nminutes per statement. In the light of that given time\r\nframe, I should like to appeal to speakers to deliver\r\ntheir statements at a normal speed so that interpretation\r\nmay be provided properly.\r\nI also should like to draw the General Assemblys\r\nattention to the decision taken by the Assembly at\r\nprevious sessions, namely, that the practice of\r\nexpressing congratulations inside the General\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nAssembly Hall after a speech has been delivered is\r\nstrongly discouraged.\r\nIn that connection, I should like to suggest that\r\nspeakers in the general debate, after delivering their\r\nstatements, should leave the General Assembly Hall\r\nthrough room GA-200, located behind the podium,\r\nbefore returning to their seats.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to\r\nproceed in the same manner during the general debate\r\nof the fifty-eighth session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAddress by Mr. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, President\r\nof the Federative Republic of Brazil\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Federative Republic of\r\nBrazil.\r\nMr. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, President of the\r\nFederative Republic of Brazil, was escorted into\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva,\r\nPresident of the Federative Republic of Brazil, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Da Silva (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): Let my first\r\nwords before this world parliament be of confidence in\r\nthe human capacity to overcome challenges and to\r\nmove towards higher forms of partnership, both within\r\nand among nations. On behalf of the Brazilian people, I\r\nreaffirm our belief in the United Nations. Its role in\r\npromoting peace and social justice remains\r\nirreplaceable.\r\nI pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for\r\nthe leadership that he has shown in defence of a world\r\nunited through respect for international law and\r\nsolidarity among nations.\r\nThe Assembly convenes under the impact of the\r\nbrutal attack on the United Nations Mission in\r\nBaghdad, which took the life of its head officer, the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, our compatriot\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello. Sergios renowned competence\r\nwas nurtured by the only weapons in which he\r\nbelieved: dialogue, persuasion and, above all, concern\r\nfor those who are most vulnerable. On behalf of the\r\nUnited Nations, he showed a tolerant, peace-loving and\r\ncourageous humanism that mirrors Brazils libertarian\r\nsoul. Sergios sacrifice, and that of his colleagues, must\r\nnot be in vain. We can best honour his memory by\r\nredoubling our efforts to protect human dignity\r\nwherever it is threatened.\r\nI warmly greet Mr. Julian Hunte, who was elected\r\nPresident of the Assembly at a particularly grave\r\nmoment in the history of the United Nations. The\r\ninternational community faces enormous political,\r\neconomic and social challenges requiring an\r\naccelerated pace of reform. Only thus will our\r\ncollective decisions and actions be truly respected and\r\neffective.\r\nIn my nine months as President of Brazil, I have\r\nconferred with leaders of all continents, and I have\r\nsensed in them a deep concern to defend and strengthen\r\nmultilateral institutions. The improvement of the\r\nmultilateral system is a necessary counterpart to\r\ndemocratic practice within nations. Every nation that\r\npractices democracy must strive to ensure that in\r\ninternational affairs, decision-making is equally open,\r\ntransparent, legitimate and representative. The\r\ntragedies that have befallen Iraq and the Middle East\r\ncan be overcome only within a multilateral\r\nframework  one in which the United Nations is given\r\na central role.\r\nIn Iraq, the prevailing climate of insecurity and\r\ngrowing tension makes national reconstruction an even\r\nmore complex task. That impasse can be overcome\r\nonly under the leadership of the United Nations \r\nleadership not only in re-establishing acceptable\r\nsecurity conditions, but also in guiding the political\r\nprocess towards the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty as\r\nsoon as possible. We must not shy away from our\r\ncollective responsibilities. A war can perhaps be won\r\nsingle-handedly, but peace  lasting peace  cannot\r\nbe secured without the support of all.\r\nTwo years later, the images of the barbaric attack\r\non 11 September still haunt us. There is a\r\ncommendable willingness today to adopt more\r\neffective measures to deal with terrorism, with\r\nweapons of mass destruction and with organized crime.\r\nUnfortunately, there are also worrisome signs of an\r\nattempt to discredit the Organization and even to divest\r\nthe United Nations of its political authority. Let there\r\nbe no ambiguity on this subject: no matter how\r\ninvaluable its humanitarian work, the United Nations\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nwas conceived to do more than simply to clear away\r\nthe rubble of conflicts that it was unable to prevent.\r\nOur central task is to preserve people from the scourge\r\nof war, to negotiate settlements inspired by the\r\nprinciples and objectives of the San Francisco Charter.\r\nLet us not place greater trust on military might than on\r\nthe institutions we created with the light of reason and\r\nthe vision of history.\r\nReform of the United Nations has become an\r\nurgent task, given the present risks to the international\r\npolitical order.\r\nThe Security Council must be fully empowered to\r\ndeal with crises and threats to peace. It must therefore\r\nbe equipped with the tools for effective action. Above\r\nall, its decisions must seen as legitimate by the\r\ncommunity of nations as a whole. Its composition, in\r\nparticular as concerns permanent membership, cannot\r\nremain unaltered almost 60 years later. It can no longer\r\nignore the changing world. More specifically, it must\r\ntake into account the emergence on the international\r\nscene of developing countries. They have become\r\nimportant actors that often exercise a critical role in\r\nensuring the pacific settlement of disputes.\r\nBrazil believes that it has a useful contribution to\r\nmake. It seeks not to advance an exclusive conception\r\nof international security, but rather to give expression\r\nto the perceptions and aspirations of a region that today\r\nis a hallmark of peaceful coexistence among its\r\nmembers and that is a force for international stability.\r\nGiven the support we received in South America and\r\nbeyond, Brazil is encouraged to continue advocating\r\nfor a Security Council that better reflects contemporary\r\nreality.\r\nWe also favour an Economic and Social Council\r\ncapable of bringing about a fair and just economic\r\norder. It is crucial that the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil regain the role bestowed upon it by the\r\nfounding fathers of the Organization. We wish to see\r\nthe Economic and Social Council cooperate actively\r\nwith the Security Council in preventing conflicts and in\r\nnation building.\r\nThe General Assembly, in turn, must be\r\nstrengthened politically so as to focus on priority issues\r\nand avoid duplication of effort. The General Assembly\r\nhas fulfilled a historically important role by convening\r\nmajor conferences and other meetings on human rights,\r\nthe environment, population, womens rights, racial\r\ndiscrimination, AIDS and social development.\r\nHowever, the General Assembly should not hesitate to\r\nassume its responsibilities for maintaining international\r\npeace and security. Our Organization has shown that\r\nthere are legal and political alternatives to a veto-\r\ninduced paralysis and to actions lacking multilateral\r\nendorsement.\r\nPeace, security, development and social justice\r\nare indivisible. Brazil has endeavoured to practice with\r\nutmost consistency the principles for which it stands.\r\nThe new relationship we are forging with our South\r\nAmerican neighbours is founded on mutual respect,\r\nfriendship and cooperation.\r\nWe are moving beyond our shared history and\r\ngeography to create a unique sense of kinship and\r\npartnership. In this context, our relationship with\r\nArgentina remains crucial.\r\nSouth America and Latin America are\r\nincreasingly seen as a region of peace, democracy and\r\ndevelopment that aspires to become a new outpost for\r\ngrowth in a stagnating world economy.\r\nWe are deepening the already significant ties with\r\ntraditional partners in North America and Europe,\r\nbut we also seek to widen and diversify our\r\ninternational presence. Our relations with China and\r\nthe Russian Federation have revealed unexpected\r\ncomplementarities.\r\nWe are proud to be the country with the second\r\nlargest population of African descent in the world. In\r\nNovember, I will be travelling to five countries in\r\nSouthern Africa to foster economic, political, social\r\nand cultural cooperation. With the same goal in mind,\r\nwe will also host a summit meeting between South\r\nAmerican countries and the member States of the\r\nLeague of Arab States. With India and South Africa we\r\nhave established a trilateral forum for political\r\nconsultations and joint projects.\r\nThe protectionism practised by rich countries\r\nunfairly penalizes efficient producers in developing\r\ncountries. Today this is the greatest obstacle to\r\nlaunching a new era of economic and social progress.\r\nBrazil and its partners in the G-22 maintained during\r\nthe World Trade Organization summit meeting at\r\nCancun that the crucial goal of effectively opening\r\nmarkets is achievable through pragmatic and mutually\r\nreinforcing negotiations that bring about an effective\r\nopening of markets. I reaffirm our willingness to travel\r\nalong a path that converges towards solutions that\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nbenefit all countries, taking into account the interests\r\nof developing countries.\r\nWe are entirely in favour of free trade as long as\r\nwe can all compete on a level playing field.\r\nLiberalization should not require countries to abandon\r\nthe prerogative of formulating industrial, technological,\r\nsocial and environmental policy. In Brazil we are\r\nengaged in setting up a new framework that balances\r\neconomic stability and social inclusion. From that\r\nstandpoint, trade negotiations are not an end in\r\nthemselves, but rather a means to foster development\r\nand overcome poverty. International trade should be a\r\ntool not only for creating wealth, but also for its\r\ndistribution.\r\nI reaffirm before this truly universal Assembly\r\nthe appeal I launched at the Davos and Porto Alegre\r\nforums and at the Enlarged Summit of the G-8 at\r\nEvian. We must wage  both politically and\r\nmaterially  the only war from which we will all\r\nemerge victorious: the war against hunger and extreme\r\npoverty.\r\nThe eradication of hunger in the world is a moral\r\nand political imperative. And we all know that it is\r\npossible. What is truly required is political will.\r\nI do not wish to dwell on indications of\r\nbarbarism. I would rather acknowledge ethical and\r\nsocial progress, no matter how modest. Yet we cannot\r\ndismiss the statistics that expose the terrible scourge of\r\nextreme poverty and hunger in the world. Hunger today\r\ntouches a fourth of the worlds population, including\r\n300 million children. Daily, 24,000 people fall victim\r\nto malnutrition-related diseases.\r\nNothing is more absurd or intolerable than the\r\npervasiveness of hunger in the twenty-first century, this\r\ngolden age of science and technology.\r\nWith each passing day, human intelligence\r\nenlarges the horizons of the possible and achieves\r\nprodigious feats. Yet, hunger persists and, what is\r\nworse, it is spreading throughout various regions of the\r\nplanet.\r\nThe more we seem to approach the divine through\r\nour creative abilities, the more humanity betrays its\r\naspirations through our inability to respect and protect\r\nour fellow creatures. The more we celebrate God by\r\ngenerating riches, the more we hurt our ideals by not\r\nminimally sharing them.\r\nWhat is the use of all our science and technology,\r\nof all the abundance and luxury that it has generated, if\r\nwe do not put it to use, guaranteeing the most sacred of\r\nrights: the right to life?\r\nI recall the penetrating warning, made by Pope\r\nPaul VI 36 years ago, but which is still surprisingly\r\nrelevant: The starving people of the world\r\ndramatically address their plea to the wealthy.\r\nHunger is an emergency, and it should be dealt\r\nwith as such. The eradication of hunger is a\r\ncivilizational challenge that requires that we seek a\r\nshortcut to the future. Will we act to eliminate hunger\r\nor will we forsake our credibility through omission?\r\nWe no longer have the right to allege that we were not\r\nhome when they knocked at our door asking for\r\nsolidarity. We have no right to say to the famished who\r\nhave waited for so long: come back next century. The\r\ntrue path to peace is to fight hunger and extreme\r\npoverty to the end, in a campaign of solidarity that\r\nunites the planet rather than deepening the divisions\r\nand the hatred that inflame people and sow terror.\r\nDespite the failure of systems that favour the\r\ngeneration of wealth without reducing extreme poverty,\r\nmany people still persist in their short-sightedness and\r\ngreed.\r\nSince my inauguration as President of Brazil on 1\r\nJanuary, significant progress has been made on the\r\neconomic front. Stability is back and the groundwork\r\nfor a renewed cycle of sustained growth has been laid.\r\nWe will continue to work hard to balance public\r\naccounts and to reduce external vulnerability. We will\r\nspare no effort to increase exports, raise the savings\r\nrate, attract foreign investment and start growing again.\r\nYet at the same time we must strive to cope with\r\nthe need for food, jobs, education and health services\r\nfor millions of Brazilians living below the poverty line.\r\nWe are committed to bringing about major social\r\nreform in the country.\r\nHunger is the most dramatic and urgent\r\nexpression of a structural imbalance requiring\r\ncorrection through integrated policies that foster full\r\ncitizenship. That is why I launched the zero hunger\r\nprogramme in Brazil. It seeks to eradicate hunger and\r\nits root causes in the shortest possible time by\r\npromoting major solidarity and wide-ranging\r\nprogrammes bringing together Government, civil\r\nsociety and the private sector. The results of those\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nemergency and structural measures are already\r\nbenefiting 4 million individuals who were previously\r\ndenied the right to a daily meal. The goal of this\r\nprogramme is to guarantee that no Brazilians will go\r\nhungry.\r\nThe United Nations adopted the highly acclaimed\r\nMillennium Development Goals. The Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization has at its disposal outstanding\r\ntechnical and social expertise. But we need to make a\r\nqualitative leap in the global endeavour to fight hunger.\r\nThat is why I proposed setting up a global fund to fight\r\nhunger and suggested means to make it operational.\r\nOther proposals have been put forward as well, some\r\nalready integrated into existing United Nations\r\nprogrammes.\r\nWhat has been lacking until now is the\r\nindispensable political will of us all, especially of those\r\ncountries in a position to contribute most. Creating new\r\nfunds is of no use if no resources are committed to\r\nthem. The Millennium Development Goals are very\r\nworthy, but if we remain passive, if our collective\r\nbehaviour remains unchanged, those Goals may never\r\nmaterialize, and the ensuing frustration will be\r\nimmense.\r\nNow more than ever, good intentions must give\r\nrise to concrete gestures. We must put commitments\r\ninto practice. We must practice what we preach  with\r\naudacity, good sense and our feet firmly on the ground,\r\nyet boldly, and with new methods, solutions and\r\nintense social participation.\r\nFor this reason, I am submitting a proposal for\r\nconsideration by the General Assembly to establish a\r\nworld committee within the United Nations itself to\r\nfight hunger. It would be made up of heads of State or\r\nGovernment from all continents with the purpose of\r\nunifying and operationalizing proposals. We hope to\r\nattract donations from developed and developing\r\ncountries according to their capacities, as well as from\r\nlarge private enterprises and non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nMy life experience and political history have\r\ntaught me to believe above all in the power of\r\ndialogue. I will never forget Gandhis invaluable lesson\r\nthat when out of violence something good appears to\r\nresult, this good is at best short-lived, while the evil\r\nthat it produces is enduring. Democratic dialogue is the\r\nmost efficient of all tools for change. With the same\r\ndetermination that goes into my endeavours and those\r\nof my partners to make Brazilian society more just and\r\nhumane, I will invest in the establishment of\r\ninternational partnerships that foster equitable\r\ndevelopment and a more peace-loving, tolerant and\r\nunified world.\r\nThis century, so full of technological and material\r\npromise, must not be allowed to slide into political and\r\nspiritual decline. It is our obligation to mould, under\r\nthe reinvigorated leadership of the United Nations, an\r\ninternational climate of peace and conciliation. True\r\npeace will bloom from democracy, from respect for\r\ninternational law, from the dismantling of deadly\r\nweapons arsenals and, above all, from the final\r\neradication of hunger in the world.\r\nWe cannot afford to frustrate such high hopes.\r\nThe greatest and noblest challenge facing humanity is\r\nprecisely that of becoming more humane. It is time to\r\ncall peace by its true name: social justice. I am\r\nconvinced that together we shall be able to grasp this\r\nhistoric opportunity to bring about justice.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nFederative Republic of Brazil for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nMr. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, President of the\r\nFederative Republic of Brazil, was escorted from\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. George W. Bush, President of the\r\nUnited States of America\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency the President of the United\r\nStates of America.\r\nMr. George W. Bush, President of the United\r\nStates of America, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. George W. Bush, President\r\nof the United States of America, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Bush: Twenty-four months ago, and\r\nyesterday in the memory of America, the centre of New\r\nYork City became a battlefield, and a graveyard, and\r\nthe symbol of an unfinished war. Since that day,\r\nterrorists have struck in Bali, in Mombassa, in\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nCasablanca, in Riyadh, in Jakarta, in Jerusalem,\r\nmeasuring the advance of their cause in the chaos and\r\ninnocent suffering they leave behind.\r\nLast month, terrorists brought their war to the\r\nUnited Nations itself. The United Nations headquarters\r\nin Baghdad stood for order and compassion. For that\r\nreason, the terrorists decided it must be destroyed.\r\nAmong the 22 people who were murdered was Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello. Over the decades, that good and brave\r\nman from Brazil gave help to the afflicted in\r\nBangladesh, Cyprus, Mozambique, Lebanon,\r\nCambodia, Central Africa, Kosovo and East Timor, and\r\nwas aiding the people of Iraq in their time of need.\r\nAmerica joins you, his colleagues, in honouring the\r\nmemory of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and the memory\r\nof all those who died with him in the service of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nBy the victims they choose and by the means they\r\nuse, the terrorists have clarified the struggle we are in.\r\nThose who target relief workers for death have set\r\nthemselves against all humanity. Those who incite\r\nmurder and celebrate suicide reveal their contempt for\r\nlife itself. They have no place in any religious faith,\r\nthey have no claim on the worlds sympathy, and they\r\nshould have no friend in this Hall.\r\nEvents during the past two years have set before\r\nus the clearest of divides: between those who seek\r\norder and those who spread chaos, between those who\r\nwork for peaceful change and those who adopt the\r\nmethods of gangsters, between those who honour the\r\nrights of man and those who deliberately take the lives\r\nof men, women and children without mercy or shame.\r\nBetween those alternatives there is no neutral\r\nground. All Governments that support terror are\r\ncomplicit in a war against civilization. No Government\r\nshould ignore the threat of terror because to look the\r\nother way gives terrorists the chance to regroup, recruit\r\nand prepare. All nations that fight terror as if the lives\r\nof their own people depended on it will earn the\r\nfavourable judgement of history.\r\nThe former regimes of Afghanistan and Iraq knew\r\nthose alternatives and made their choices. The Taliban\r\nwas a sponsor and servant of terrorism. When\r\nconfronted, that regime chose defiance, and that regime\r\nis no more. Afghanistans President, who is here today,\r\nnow represents a free people who are building a decent\r\nand just society. They are building a nation fully joined\r\nin the war against terror.\r\nThe regime of Saddam Hussain cultivated ties to\r\nterror while it built weapons of mass destruction. It\r\nused those weapons in acts of mass murder and refused\r\nto account for them when confronted by the world. The\r\nSecurity Council was right to be alarmed. The Security\r\nCouncil was right to demand that Iraq destroy its\r\nillegal weapons and prove that it had done so. The\r\nSecurity Council was right to vow serious\r\nconsequences if Iraq refused to comply. And because\r\nthere were consequences  because a coalition of\r\nnations acted to defend the peace and the credibility of\r\nthe United Nations  Iraq is free, and today we are\r\njoined by the representatives of a liberated country.\r\nSaddam Hussains monuments have been\r\nremoved, and not only his statues. The true monuments\r\nof his rule and his character  the torture chambers,\r\nthe rape rooms and the prison cells for innocent\r\nchildren  are closed. And as we discover the killing\r\nfields and mass graves of Iraq, the true scale of\r\nSaddams cruelty is being revealed.\r\nThe Iraqi people are meeting hardships and\r\nchallenges, like every nation that has set out on the\r\npath of democracy. Yet, their future promises lives of\r\ndignity and freedom, and that is a world away from the\r\nsqualid, vicious tyranny they have known. Across Iraq,\r\nlife is being improved by liberty. Across the Middle\r\nEast, people are safer because an unstable aggressor\r\nhas been removed from power. Across the world,\r\nnations are more secure because an ally of terror has\r\nfallen.\r\nOur actions in Afghanistan and Iraq were\r\nsupported by many Governments, and America is\r\ngrateful to each one. I also recognize that some of the\r\nsovereign nations of the Assembly disagreed with our\r\nactions. Yet, there was and there remains unity among\r\nus on the fundamental principles and objectives of the\r\nUnited Nations. We are dedicated to the defence of our\r\ncollective security and to the advance of human rights.\r\nThose permanent commitments call us to great work in\r\nthe world, work that we must do together. So, let us\r\nmove forward. First, we must stand with the people of\r\nAfghanistan and Iraq as they build free and stable\r\ncountries. The terrorists and their allies fear and fight\r\nthis progress above all because free people embrace\r\nhope over resentment and choose peace over violence.\r\nThe United Nations has been a friend of the\r\nAfghan people, distributing food and medicine, helping\r\nrefugees return home, advising on a new constitution\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nand helping to prepare the way for nationwide\r\nelections. NATO has taken over the United Nations\r\nmandated security force in Kabul. American and\r\ncoalition forces continue to track and defeat al Qaeda\r\nterrorists and the remnants of the Taliban. Our efforts\r\nto rebuild that country go on. I have recently proposed\r\nto spend an additional $1.2 billion for the Afghan\r\nreconstruction effort, and I urge other nations to\r\ncontinue contributing to that important cause.\r\nIn the nation of Iraq, the United Nations is\r\ncarrying out vital and effective work every day. By the\r\nend of 2004, more than 90 per cent of Iraqi children\r\nunder age five will have been immunized against\r\npreventable diseases such as polio, tuberculosis and\r\nmeasles, thanks to the hard work and high ideals of\r\nUNICEF. Iraqs food distribution system is operational,\r\ndelivering nearly a half million tons of food per month,\r\nthanks to the skill and expertise of the World Food\r\nProgramme.\r\nOur international coalition in Iraq is meeting its\r\nresponsibilities. We are conducting precision raids\r\nagainst terrorists and holdouts of the former regime.\r\nThose killers are at war with the Iraqi people. They\r\nhave made Iraq the central front in the war on terror.\r\nAnd they will be defeated. Our coalition has made sure\r\nthat Iraqs former dictator will never again use\r\nweapons of mass destruction. We are now interviewing\r\nIraqi citizens and analysing records of the old regime\r\nto reveal the full extent of its weapons programmes and\r\nits long campaign of deception. We are training Iraqi\r\npolice, border guards and a new army so that the Iraqi\r\npeople can assume full responsibility for their own\r\nsecurity.\r\nAt the same time, our coalition is helping to\r\nimprove the daily lives of the Iraqi people. The old\r\nregime built palaces while letting schools decay, so we\r\nare rebuilding more than a thousand schools. The old\r\nregime starved hospitals of resources, so we have\r\nhelped to supply and reopen hospitals across Iraq. The\r\nold regime built up armies and weapons while allowing\r\nthe nations infrastructure to crumble, so we are\r\nrehabilitating power plants, water and sanitation\r\nfacilities, bridges and airports. I have proposed to\r\nCongress that the United States provide additional\r\nfunding for our work in Iraq, the greatest financial\r\ncommitment of its kind since the Marshall Plan.\r\nHaving helped to liberate Iraq, we will honour\r\nour pledges to Iraq, and by helping the Iraqi people\r\nbuild a stable and peaceful country we will make our\r\nown countries more secure.\r\nThe primary goal of our coalition in Iraq is self-\r\ngovernment for the people of Iraq, reached by an\r\norderly and democratic process. That process must\r\nunfold according to the needs of Iraqis, neither hurried\r\nnor delayed by the wishes of other parties. And the\r\nUnited Nations can contribute greatly to the cause of\r\nIraqi self-government.\r\nAmerica is working with friends and allies on a\r\nnew Security Council resolution, which will expand the\r\nUnited Nations role in Iraq. As in the aftermath of\r\nother conflicts, the United Nations should assist in\r\ndeveloping a constitution, training civil servants and\r\nconducting free and fair elections. Iraq now has a\r\nGoverning Council, the first truly representative\r\ninstitution in that country. Iraqs new leaders are\r\nshowing the openness and tolerance that democracy\r\nrequires, and they are also showing courage. Yet every\r\nyoung democracy needs the help of friends. Now the\r\nnation of Iraq needs and deserves our aid, and all\r\nnations of good will should step forward and provide\r\nthat support.\r\nThe success of a free Iraq will be watched and\r\nnoted throughout the region. Millions will see that\r\nfreedom, equality and material progress are possible at\r\nthe heart of the Middle East. Leaders in the region will\r\nface the clearest evidence that free institutions and\r\nopen societies are the only path to long-term national\r\nsuccess and dignity. And a transformed Middle East\r\nwould benefit the entire world by undermining the\r\nideologies that export violence to other lands.\r\nIraq as a dictatorship had great power to\r\ndestabilize the Middle East. Iraq as a democracy will\r\nhave great power to inspire the Middle East. The\r\nadvance of democratic institutions in Iraq is setting an\r\nexample that others, including the Palestinian people,\r\nwould be wise to follow. The Palestinian cause is\r\nbetrayed by leaders who cling to power by feeding old\r\nhatreds and destroying the good work of others. The\r\nPalestinian people deserve their own State. They will\r\ngain that State by embracing new leaders committed to\r\nreform, to fighting terror and to building peace.\r\nAll parties in the Middle East must meet their\r\nresponsibilities and carry out the commitments they\r\nmade at Aqaba. Israel must work to create the\r\nconditions that will allow a peaceful Palestinian State\r\nto emerge. Arab nations must cut off funding and other\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nsupport for terrorist organizations. America will work\r\nwith every nation in the region that acts boldly for the\r\nsake of peace.\r\nA second challenge we must confront together is\r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nOutlaw regimes that possess nuclear, chemical and\r\nbiological weapons and the means to deliver them\r\nwould be able to use blackmail and create chaos in\r\nentire regions. Those weapons could be used by\r\nterrorists to bring sudden disaster and suffering on a\r\nscale we can scarcely imagine. The deadly combination\r\nof outlaw regimes, terror networks and weapons of\r\nmass murder is a peril that cannot be ignored or wished\r\naway. If such a danger is allowed to fully materialize,\r\nall words, all protests, will come too late.\r\nNations of the world must have the wisdom and\r\nthe will to stop grave threats before they arrive. One\r\ncrucial step is to secure the most dangerous materials at\r\ntheir source. For more than a decade, the United States\r\nhas worked with Russia and other States of the former\r\nSoviet Union to dismantle, destroy or secure weapons\r\nand dangerous materials left over from another era.\r\nLast year in Canada, the G-8 nations agreed to\r\nprovide up to 20 billion dollars, half of it from the\r\nUnited States, to fight this proliferation risk over the\r\nnext ten years. Since then, six additional countries have\r\njoined the effort. More are needed, and I urge other\r\nnations to help us meet this danger.\r\nWe are also improving our capability to interdict\r\nlethal materials in transit. Through our Proliferation\r\nSecurity Initiative, eleven nations are preparing to\r\nsearch planes, ships, trains and trucks carrying suspect\r\ncargo and to seize weapons or missile shipments that\r\nraise proliferation concerns. These nations have agreed\r\non a set of interdiction principles consistent with\r\ncurrent legal authorities, and we are working to expand\r\nthe Proliferation Security Initiative to other countries.\r\nWe are determined to keep the worlds most destructive\r\nweapons away from all our shores and out of the hands\r\nof our common enemies.\r\nBecause proliferators will use any route or\r\nchannel that is open to them, we need the broadest\r\npossible cooperation to stop them. Today I ask the\r\nUnited Nations Security Council to adopt a new\r\nantiproliferation resolution. That resolution should call\r\non all Members of the United Nations to criminalize\r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to\r\nenact strict export controls consistent with international\r\nstandards and to secure any and all sensitive materials\r\nwithin their own borders. The United States stands\r\nready to help any nation draft these new laws and to\r\nassist in their enforcement.\r\nA third challenge we share is a challenge to our\r\nconscience. We must act decisively to meet the\r\nhumanitarian crises of our time. The United States has\r\nbegun to carry out the Emergency Plan for AIDS\r\nRelief, aimed at preventing AIDS on a massive scale\r\nand treating millions who have the disease already. We\r\nhave pledged 15 billion dollars over five years to fight\r\nAIDS around the world.\r\nMy country is acting to save lives from famine as\r\nwell. We are providing more than 1.4 billion dollars in\r\nglobal emergency food aid, and I have asked our\r\nUnited States Congress for 200 million dollars for a\r\nnew famine fund so that we can act quickly when the\r\nfirst signs of famine appear. Every nation on every\r\ncontinent should generously add their resources to the\r\nfight against disease and desperate hunger.\r\nThere is another humanitarian crisis, spreading,\r\nyet hidden from view. Each year, an estimated eight to\r\nnine hundred thousand human beings are bought, sold\r\nor forced across the worlds borders. Among them are\r\nhundreds of thousands of teenage girls and others as\r\nyoung as five who fall victim to the sex trade. This\r\ncommerce in human life generates billions of dollars\r\neach year, much of which is used to finance organized\r\ncrime. There is a special evil in the abuse and\r\nexploitation of the most innocent and vulnerable. The\r\nvictims of the sex trade see little of life before they see\r\nthe very worst of life  an underground of brutality\r\nand lonely fear. Those who create these victims and\r\nprofit from their suffering must be severely punished.\r\nThose who patronize this industry debase themselves\r\nand deepen the misery of others, and Governments that\r\ntolerate this trade are tolerating a form of slavery.\r\nThis problem has appeared in my own country\r\nand we are working to stop it. The Protect Act, which I\r\nsigned into law this year, makes it a crime for any\r\nperson to enter the United States or for any citizen to\r\ntravel abroad for the purpose of sex tourism involving\r\nchildren. The Department of Justice is actively\r\ninvestigating sex tour operators and patrons, who can\r\nface up to 30 years in prison. Under the Trafficking\r\nVictims Protection Act, the United States is using\r\nsanctions against Governments to discourage human\r\ntrafficking.\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nThe victims of this industry also need help from\r\nMembers of the United Nations. This begins with clear\r\nstandards and the certainty of punishment under the\r\nlaws of every country. Today, some nations make it a\r\ncrime to sexually abuse children abroad. Such conduct\r\nshould be a crime in all nations. Governments should\r\ninform travellers of the harm this industry does and the\r\nsevere punishments that will fall on its patrons. The\r\nAmerican Government is committing $50 million to\r\nsupport the good work of organizations that are\r\nrescuing women and children from exploitation and\r\ngiving them shelter, medical treatment and the hope of\r\na new life. I urge other Governments to do their part.\r\nWe must show new energy in fighting back an old\r\nevil. Nearly two centuries after the abolition of the\r\ntransatlantic slave trade and more than a century after\r\nslavery was officially ended in its last strongholds, the\r\ntrade in human beings for any purpose must not be\r\nallowed to thrive in our time.\r\nAll the challenges I have spoken of this morning\r\nrequire urgent attention and moral clarity. Helping\r\nAfghanistan and Iraq to succeed as free nations in a\r\ntransformed region; cutting off the avenues of\r\nproliferation; abolishing modern forms of slavery \r\nthese are the kinds of great tasks for which the United\r\nNations was founded. In each case, careful discussion\r\nis needed and, also, decisive action. Our good\r\nintentions will be credited only if we achieve good\r\noutcomes. As an original signer of the United Nations\r\nCharter, the United States of America is committed to\r\nthe United Nations and we show that commitment by\r\nworking to fulfil the United Nations stated purposes\r\nand by giving meaning to its ideals.\r\nThe founding documents of the United Nations\r\nand the founding documents of America stand in the\r\nsame tradition. Both assert that human beings should\r\nnever be reduced to objects of power or commerce,\r\nbecause their dignity is inherent. Both recognize a\r\nmoral law that stands above men and nations, but\r\nwhich must be defended and enforced by men and\r\nnations. And both point the way to peace  the peace\r\nthat comes when all are free. We secure that peace with\r\nour courage and we must show that courage together.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the United\r\nStates of America for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. George W. Bush, President of the United\r\nStates of America, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alejandro Toledo Manrique,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Peru\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Peru.\r\nMr. Alejandro Toledo Manrique, President of the\r\nRepublic of Peru, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Alejandro Toledo\r\nManrique, President of the Republic of Peru, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Toledo Manrique (spoke in Spanish):\r\nPeru has no doubt that multilateralism is the best\r\ninstrument for confronting global challenges, as well as\r\nfor guaranteeing peace and international security. For\r\nthat reason, the United Nations is indispensable. All\r\nMember States must have the conviction to strengthen\r\nit, to contribute to its institutional regeneration and to\r\nreform it. With a reformed United Nations, we will\r\ncontinue our struggle against poverty; we will maintain\r\nthe world development agenda; we will assure\r\ndemocracy; and we will fight decisively against drug\r\ntrafficking and international terrorism.\r\nThe terrorist attacks taking place in different\r\nareas of the world and the threats to peace in several\r\nregions create an international climate of instability\r\nand insecurity that calls for urgent solutions. Terrorism\r\nconspires against the democracies of the world.\r\nTerrorism conspires against the health of the world\r\neconomy. Terrorism contributes to making the poor\r\neven poorer. Peru strongly condemns the terrorist\r\nattack on the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad\r\nand wishes to pay sincere tribute to all the victims, in\r\nparticular to Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General.\r\nWe cannot accept terrorism as a political tool. In\r\nour case, the 20 years of violence bequeathed by the\r\nSendero Luminoso is a hard lesson to cope with.\r\nAccording to the final report of the Truth and\r\nReconciliation Commission, recently submitted to my\r\nGovernment, thousands of lives were lost and more\r\nthan $30 billion in losses were reported. This report is\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nthe result of a resolute political decision of our\r\nGovernment to make sure that Peru never again has to\r\nface irrational acts of terror.\r\nTruth must also be a means to prevent impunity\r\nand to lead us to reconciliation with justice. My\r\nGovernment is firmly struggling against impunity. That\r\nis why we consider that the fugitives who fled Peru\r\nwhen the corrupt regime of the past decade was\r\noverthrown should answer to justice for the gravity of\r\nthe crimes they committed. We will insure these people\r\na fair trial and all the guarantees of due process, within\r\nthe framework of the Inter-American Convention on\r\nHuman Rights and Peruvian law.\r\nThat is why we hope that our requests for\r\nextradition will be taken into account. Democratic\r\nStates have the responsibility to avoid impunity. In this\r\nregard, the Peruvian State wishes in this Assembly to\r\nthank the 20 friendly countries that have announced\r\ntheir decision to detain anyone on the list of\r\nextraditables if they enter their territories.\r\nPoverty, social exclusion and fundamentalist\r\nideologies are among the causes of the current crises.\r\nThe hopes of our countries to be part of an inclusive\r\nglobalization are not bearing fruit. Despite some\r\nachievements at the national level, there is a wide\r\nchasm to bridge if we are to build such an inclusive\r\nglobalization. For example, in the case of Peru, despite\r\nan unfavourable international environment the\r\neconomy grew by 5.2 per cent last year, one of the\r\nhighest rates in Latin America. Inflation was below 1\r\nper cent, international reserves rose to their highest\r\nlevel yet, and exports reached unprecedented figures.\r\nHowever, we must concede that all these\r\nindicators are not enough to make the common people\r\nfeel the benefits of such macroeconomic achievements\r\nin their own pockets. Today, it is necessary for the\r\nglobal economy to reach an annual average growth of 7\r\nto 8 per cent if we wish to reduce poverty and to create\r\nemployment. If we in the developing world,\r\nparticularly in Latin America, grow by 6 or 7 per cent,\r\nit will barely be enough to recover the per capita\r\nincome of 1970. We have to achieve adequate growth\r\nas soon as possible. The poor cannot wait another 15\r\nyears for their economies to grow in a sustained\r\nmanner that will reduce poverty.\r\nDemocratic governance in Latin America is at\r\nrisk. There is no doubt that there is a correlation\r\nbetween the health of the world economy, social\r\ninclusion and democratic governance. World leaders\r\ncannot close their eyes. There is no possible\r\ngovernance without a reduction of poverty. We must be\r\ncreative and courageous in order to ensure that Wall\r\nStreets macroeconomic requirements meet the\r\nexpectations of Main Street.\r\nLast year before this Assembly, I highlighted the\r\nneed to defend democracy from market turbulence by\r\ncreating innovative financial mechanisms. We said that\r\nthe time had come to build a new global consensus to\r\nreaffirm democracy and re-evaluate development with\r\nsocial equity. Since then, Peru has been working on a\r\nseries of initiatives in this regard. Last May, 19\r\ndemocracies of Latin America and the Caribbean,\r\nmembers of the Rio Group  over which I have the\r\nhonour to preside  approved a key document that we\r\ncall the Cusco Consensus. This document comprises\r\nfour Peruvian initiatives on innovative financial\r\nmechanisms that allow us to finance democratic\r\ngovernance in the region; to increase public investment\r\nin roads, hospitals and schools; to create jobs; and to\r\nsupplement private investment.\r\nIn relation to one of these proposals, last August,\r\njointly with the President of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da\r\nSilva, we decided to work together on the\r\nestablishment of the South American Infrastructure\r\nAuthority project, which will operate as a fiduciary\r\nagency to facilitate the financing of investment projects\r\nfor the integration of South America. I am sure that\r\nthat experience can be duplicated in other parts of the\r\nworld.\r\nLikewise, we have signed a memorandum of\r\nunderstanding on physical and economic integration to\r\nset into motion three axes of development\r\nintegration  in Peru, Bolivia, Brazil and Ecuador \r\non the road to South Americas integration.\r\nAccordingly, Peru signed an agreement that will lead to\r\nthe creation of a free trade zone with MERCOSUR.\r\nFrom this international forum, we would like reiterate\r\nthat those efforts and achievements in the area of\r\nintegration constitute decisive steps on the path\r\ntowards building a South American community of\r\nnations. However, I wish to point out that, beyond the\r\ndecisions that two or more countries of the subregion\r\nmay take, it will be essential for the international\r\ncommunity to commit itself to the initiatives emanating\r\nfrom an exercise in collective reflection.\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nDeveloping nations are concerned about the\r\nalarming increase in external vulnerabilities resulting\r\nfrom instability in financial flows and their impact on\r\ninvestment levels and economic growth in our region.\r\nThose countries also perceive the presence of\r\nprotectionism in the area of trade, in particular on the\r\npart of certain industrialized nations. I would like to be\r\nfrank in this connection: we ask developed countries\r\nnot to demand that we open our markets while they\r\nprotect their products with billions of dollars in\r\nsubsidies every year, especially in the agricultural\r\nsector. Our countries can no longer withstand\r\nasymmetrical relations in the area of trade. The time\r\nhas come to build a two-way business highway that is\r\nmore transparent and predictable. We are being asked\r\nto open up our markets in the agricultural sector while\r\nthere are still countries that are investing billions of\r\ndollars every day to subsidize their own products. Do\r\nnot ask us to practice something that you do not\r\npractice yourselves. Our countries are aware of the fact\r\nthat we have to be competitive, but we must build that\r\ntwo-way commercial highway.\r\nPeru is especially concerned about the negative\r\nresults of the recently held ministerial conference of\r\nthe World Trade Organization in Cancun, which,\r\ndespite some progress, was unable to reach consensus.\r\nThere is a continuing desire for multilateralism and\r\nfree trade in Peru. We therefore trust that there will be\r\na return to negotiation in the next few months so as to\r\nrealize the goals set out at Doha, which placed\r\ndevelopment foursquare on the agenda of the WTO.\r\nWe have an obligation to build a more just, secure\r\nand humane world. That is why today I ask the United\r\nNations and our great friend of peace, Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan, to exercise their great authority\r\nand prestige to promote within the World Bank, the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund, the Inter-American\r\nDevelopment Bank and the member countries of the\r\nGroup of 8 a wide debate on the innovative financial\r\nmechanisms that will make it possible to finance\r\ndemocratic governance in the region; increase public\r\ninvestment in schools, hospitals and roads; generate\r\njobs and promote private investment. That is the only\r\nway by which globalization can be inclusive, and by\r\nwhich governance can be strengthened. May God bless\r\npeace in the world.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Peru for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alejandro Toledo Manrique, President of the\r\nRepublic of Peru, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jacques Chirac, President of the\r\nFrench Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the French Republic.\r\nMr. Jacques Chirac, President of the French\r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Jacques Chirac, President\r\nof the French Republic, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Chirac (spoke in French): Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello was the pride of the United Nations.\r\nMurdered on 19 August along with his colleagues, he\r\nwill remain in our memories. Let us dedicate this\r\nsession to that great servant of the world and of peace.\r\nThe United Nations has just emerged from one of\r\nthe most serious challenges in its history. Respect for\r\nthe Charter and the use of force were at the heart of the\r\ndebate. The war, which was launched without the\r\nSecurity Councils authorization, has undermined the\r\nmultilateral system.\r\nHaving come to terms with that crisis, our\r\nOrganization can now continue to move forward; for it\r\nis above all in this forum  the melting pot of the\r\ninternational order  that we must exercise our\r\nresponsibilities to the world of today as well as to\r\nfuture generations.\r\nIn an open world no one can live in isolation, no\r\none can act alone in the name of all and no one can\r\naccept the anarchy of a society without rules. There is\r\nno alternative to the United Nations. But in order to\r\nmeet todays challenges, this fundamental choice,\r\nexpressed by the Charter, requires a far-reaching\r\nreform of our Organization.\r\nMultilateralism is crucial, because it ensures the\r\nparticipation of all in the management of world affairs.\r\nIt is a guarantee of legitimacy and democracy,\r\nespecially when decisions must be made with respect to\r\nthe use of force or to the laying down of universal\r\nnorms.\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nMultilateralism is effective. In Monterrey and\r\nJohannesburg, it allowed us to transcend North-South\r\nconfrontation and to open the way to promising\r\npartnerships, in particular with the African continent.\r\nMultilateralism is modern, because it alone makes\r\nit possible to comprehend contemporary problems\r\nglobally and in all of their complexity.\r\nFirst, let me touch on the settlement of conflicts\r\nthat threaten international peace and security.\r\nIn Iraq, the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqis,\r\nwho must have sole responsibility for their destiny, is\r\nessential for stability and reconstruction. It is up to the\r\nUnited Nations to lend its legitimacy to that process. It\r\nis also up to the United Nations to assist with the\r\ngradual transfer of administrative and economic\r\nresponsibilities to the Iraqi institutions, according to a\r\nrealistic timetable, and to help the Iraqis draft a\r\nconstitution and hold general elections.\r\nFinally, it is up to the United Nations to entrust a\r\nmandate to a multinational force, commanded,\r\nnaturally, by the main troop contributor  that is, the\r\nUnited States  in order to ensure the security of Iraq\r\nand of all those helping to rebuild the country.\r\nThus the international community and the Iraqi\r\npeople, united around a common project, will together\r\nput an end to the tragic decades of that great countrys\r\nhistory.\r\nIn the Middle East, ravaged by despair and\r\nhatred, only strong political will on both sides to\r\nimplement the law as stipulated by the United Nations\r\ncan pave the way for a just and lasting solution.\r\nThe international community must restore a\r\ndynamic for peace. It must involve itself in the\r\nimplementation of the road map. That should be the\r\nobjective of the upcoming meeting of the Quartet, to be\r\nheld at the ministerial level. France believes that the\r\nidea of a monitoring mechanism is as relevant as ever,\r\nand that the convening of an international conference is\r\na goal to be attained as quickly as possible.\r\nGiven the present tense situation, France calls on\r\nthe parties not to succumb to the temptation of a test of\r\nstrength and of a futile radicalization.\r\nAnother major challenge is the fight against\r\ninternational terrorism. This fight is well under way,\r\nunder the auspices of the Security Council and within\r\nthe context of our treaties. The horror of 11 September\r\ncemented our common resolve. This threat strikes at\r\nthe very heart of our democracies and our societies. We\r\nare using force to combat terrorism, but that is not\r\nenough. It will re-emerge again and again if we allow\r\nextremism and fanaticism to flourish  if we fail to\r\nrealize that it seeks justification in the worlds\r\nunresolved conflicts and economic and social\r\nimbalances.\r\nGiven the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, we reject the policy of fait accompli. We\r\nmust stand united to guarantee the universality of\r\ntreaties and the effectiveness of non-proliferation\r\nregimes. In order to ensure compliance, we must also\r\ndevelop our means of action. France has proposed the\r\ncreation of a permanent corps of inspectors under the\r\nauthority of the Security Council. Let us give fresh\r\nimpetus to this policy. Let us convene a summit\r\nmeeting of the Security Council to outline a true plan\r\nof action of the United Nations against proliferation.\r\nAt this time, let us demand that North Korea\r\ncompletely, verifiably and irreversibly dismantle its\r\nmilitary programme. Let us demand that Iran sign and\r\nimplement, unconditionally and without delay, a\r\nstrengthened nuclear safeguards agreement with the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\r\nSustainable development poses yet another\r\nchallenge, because half of humankind is living in\r\nconditions of insecurity or extreme poverty. Will we be\r\nable to globalize solidarity, as our peoples demand, in\r\nresponse to the inevitable globalization of the\r\neconomy?\r\nWe agree on the objectives. We are bound by the\r\nMillennium Goals. But, in order to attain those goals,\r\nstrong political impetus remains necessary. I propose\r\nthat heads of State and Government meet in New York\r\nin 2005 for a preliminary progress review. I hope that\r\nthis session of the General Assembly will confirm the\r\ndetermination of States to overcome the failure of\r\nCancun and to ensure the success of the Doha\r\nDevelopment Round.\r\nIn order to carry out the missions entrusted to it\r\nand to remedy its blatant shortcomings, the United\r\nNations must evolve. Three watchwords, I believe,\r\nmust guide us: democracy, authority, effectiveness.\r\nThanks to the Secretary-General, progress has been\r\nmade, and new avenues are opening up. It is now up to\r\nStates to move forward without further ado and to put\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nan end to the adverse consequences of the stalemate\r\nover reforms.\r\nThe United Nations is suffering from the current\r\nweakness of the General Assembly. And yet, it is here\r\nthat a debate should be organized and a consensus\r\ncrafted regarding solutions to major problems. A\r\nculture of confrontation must give way to a culture of\r\naction aimed at achieving our common goals, which we\r\nshould determine together.\r\nThe primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\npeace and security rests with the Security Council. It is\r\ntherefore essential to its legitimacy that its composition\r\nreflect the state of the world. It must be expanded to\r\ninclude new permanent members, because the presence\r\nof major countries is necessary. France, naturally, is\r\nthinking of Germany and of Japan, but also of some\r\nleading countries of Asia, Africa and America. We also\r\nneed new elected members, to make the Council even\r\nmore representative. With the decisive impetus of the\r\nfive permanent members, we all need to resume\r\ndiscussions, mindful of the general interest.\r\nSuch reform should be accompanied by a\r\nstrengthening of the Councils authority. It is the\r\nCouncil that should set the bounds with respect to the\r\nuse of force. No one can claim the right to use force\r\nunilaterally and preventively. Conversely, in the face of\r\nmounting threats, States must be assured that the\r\nCouncil has at its disposal the appropriate means of\r\nevaluation and of collective action, and that it has the\r\nwill to act.\r\nWe all are very committed to the sovereignty of\r\nStates. But its scope can and should be limited in the\r\ncase of serious violations of human rights and of\r\nhumanitarian law. The Security Council is taking steps\r\nin that direction, and France supports this development.\r\nMeanwhile, crimes against humanity are being\r\nsuppressed more effectively with the establishment of\r\nthe International Criminal Court, whose jurisdiction is\r\nuniversal. This historic step forward must be\r\naccompanied by a strengthening of the Office of the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, under a\r\ncommission equipped to discharge its duties and its\r\nmission.\r\nWe now realize that globalization demands\r\nstronger economic, social and environmental\r\ngovernance. To that end, France proposes the creation\r\nof a new political forum representative of the present\r\neconomic state of todays world in all its diversity.\r\nThat council would be responsible for providing the\r\nnecessary impetus to international institutions, for\r\nimproving their coordination and for anticipating and\r\ntackling global problems more effectively.\r\nEffectiveness also depends on increased financial\r\nresources. France calls for two changes.\r\nFirst, the trend towards increasing voluntary\r\ncontributions at the expense of mandatory\r\ncontributions must be reversed. Failing that, we will\r\nend up with a pick-and-choose United Nations, which\r\nis an outdated vision and a harmful one.\r\nSecondly, we need to make progress in\r\nmobilizing funds for development and development\r\nassistance. France wants to meet the official\r\ndevelopment assistance target of 0.7 per cent by the\r\nyear 2012. But this effort, together with that of the\r\nEuropean Union, will obviously not suffice to release\r\nthe necessary funds needed to finance the Millennium\r\nGoals each year. France therefore supports the\r\ninnovative concept of an international financial facility.\r\nI would also like us to give pragmatic, speedy\r\nconsideration to international solidarity levies, a kind\r\nof tax on the wealth generated by globalization and\r\ngiven over to development.\r\nTo advance on these issues, I completely approve\r\nof the Secretary-Generals intention to gather around\r\nhim a committee of independent wise men and women\r\nresponsible for submitting proposals.\r\nAgainst the risk of a world without order\r\ndelivered up to violence, let us work to establish the\r\nrule of international law. Against the injustice and\r\nsuffering of a world of widening inequalities  even\r\nthough it has never been so rich  let us choose\r\nsolidarity. Against the chaos of a world shaken by\r\necological disasters, let us call for a sharing of\r\nresponsibility around a United Nations environmental\r\norganization. Against the barbarity of a world in which\r\nfundamental rights are all too often held up to ridicule,\r\nwhere the integrity of mankind is under threat, where\r\nindigenous peoples  the heirs to an irreplaceable\r\nheritage  vanish amid silence and indifference, let us\r\nuphold the demands of ethics. Against the peril of a\r\nclash of civilizations, finally, let us insist on the equal\r\ndignity of cultures, respect for diversity and the value\r\nof dialogue.\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nWith the Charter adopted in the name of the\r\nPeoples of the United Nations, the founders proclaimed\r\ntheir faith in these ideals. Let us seek to be worthy of\r\nthem. Let us establish the United Nations at the heart\r\nof this planetary democracy that is so vital in our day\r\nand age.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the French\r\nRepublic for the statement that he just made.\r\nMr. Jacques Chirac, President of the French\r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Joseph Urusemal, President of the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia.\r\nMr. Joseph Urusemal, President of the Federated\r\nStates of Micronesia, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Joseph Urusemal,\r\nPresident of the Federated States of Micronesia, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Urusemal: I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\r\nelection. My Government is deeply gratified by the\r\nrecognition of your accomplishments, especially given\r\nthat you are a fellow islander. We are confident you\r\nwill lead the work of this body with the same high\r\ncompetence as your distinguished predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Jan Kavan of the Czech Republic.\r\nBefore going further I must pause in respectful\r\nremembrance of the second anniversary of the terrorist\r\nattacks of 11 September 2001. We honour the memory\r\nof all who were lost. I must also express our sincere\r\ncondolences over the great loss of life recently at the\r\nUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad.\r\nI am grateful for the privilege of appearing before\r\nthis body for the first time, as President of the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia. We feel a deep sense of\r\nresponsibility in joining with nations present here to\r\nwork toward a better world for all peoples.\r\nFor the past several years, much of the discussion\r\nhere and elsewhere has focused on political challenges\r\naround the world. After 11 September, it is not at all\r\nsurprising that these challenges have commanded the\r\nlions share of everyones attention. We in the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia remain committed to\r\nthe eradication of terrorism in all its forms, and will\r\ncontinue to play the role open to us as the world strives\r\nto reach this goal.\r\nHowever, the challenges of the environment and\r\nof sustainable development that occupied so much of\r\nour attention during the 1990s have not gone away.\r\nDespite the immediacy of so many pressing demands\r\ntoday, those remain challenges that the international\r\ncommunity cannot afford to put on hold. We cannot put\r\nthem on hold because they are part and parcel of the\r\nworldwide security challenge, especially over the\r\nlonger term.\r\nNo part of our world is immune to the wide range\r\nof fundamental security threats. War and terrorism are\r\nonly consequences of their deeper root causes: poverty,\r\nhuman injustice and, more recently, environmental\r\ndegradation. These are most often discussed in the\r\ncontext of the more populous regions of the world, but\r\nI ask the Assembly not to overlook the fact that they\r\nalso present themselves to the small island developing\r\nStates.\r\nThe unique vulnerability of our island States to\r\nall those scourges is widely recognized. Even so,\r\nglobal threat assessments most often are not followed\r\nup by a realistic allocation of resources to the more\r\nremote  yet also more vulnerable  places, where\r\nthreats to global security often find their origin or seek\r\nrefuge. I submit to the Assembly that the region of the\r\nPacific islands has for too long been overlooked in that\r\nway.\r\nWe welcomed the initiative of the international\r\ncommunity to address those and related development\r\nproblems during the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. But we returned home, and we still find\r\nourselves struggling just as much as ever with\r\nfundamental needs. As memories of Johannesburg are\r\npushed into the background by seemingly more urgent\r\ncrises, our people are beginning to ask questions about\r\nthis process. They are asking whether repetitious\r\ndiscussion of traditional development strategies at a\r\nlengthening string of summit venues offers the most\r\nproductive avenue for achieving real development\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\ngoals. We must consider these things with a broader\r\nconsciousness. The challenges are enormous, and they\r\nare immediate. I say to the Assembly respectfully that\r\nbusiness-as-usual multilateralism is not getting the job\r\ndone.\r\nBefore proceeding, I should say that todays\r\nMicronesians do enjoy a much-improved standard of\r\nliving in comparison with the conditions that existed\r\nwhen we were introduced to the world economy less\r\nthan 50 years ago. However, we still have very far to\r\ngo before we can reach the levels of even the\r\nmoderately successful developing countries, let alone\r\nof the industrialized world.\r\nIn saying what I do here about my own countrys\r\ndifficulties, I must add that we are by no means alone.\r\nTherefore, we stand with developing countries\r\neverywhere, and we fully support the positions to be\r\nexpressed here by His Majesty the King of Morocco on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, and by His\r\nExcellency the Prime Minister of Mauritius on behalf\r\nof the Alliance of Small Island States.\r\nWe must all do more. For our part, the small\r\nisland developing States need to ensure that we meet\r\nour obligations and fulfil our undertakings to the global\r\ncommunity. We are not just supplicants; we have roles\r\nto play. My country has made commitments to\r\nenvironmental responsibility in line with our capacity.\r\nWe have pledged increased accountability and\r\noversight of development assistance. We have resolved\r\nto build our capacity to govern more effectively and to\r\nincrease regional interaction.\r\nI believe that all developing countries should\r\nexplore how we can mobilize our limited resources,\r\nindividually and collectively, even as we seek\r\nassistance. In that regard, I commend to the\r\nAssemblys attention the communiqué of the Pacific\r\nIslands Forum issued this year at Auckland, New\r\nZealand. It is illustrative of the kind of regional\r\ncollaboration I encourage here. For example, we in the\r\nForum agreed this year to an important and\r\ncomprehensive statement of principles fundamental to\r\ngood governmental leadership and recognized by all. I\r\nthink that it deserves close study by the Assembly.\r\nSerious attention was also given by the Forum leaders\r\nto the challenges presented by international criminal\r\nelements attracted to our region. They are attracted in\r\npart by our out-of-sight, out-of-mind status. It was\r\nrecognized at the Forum that, given our limitations\r\nindividually, we can confront those challenges only\r\nthrough regional, collective action.\r\nWe are also now seeing, more than ever before,\r\nentire regions of the world marginalized in the global\r\neconomy, as witness the sad breakdown of the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO) meetings recently. Some\r\ncountries have been virtually ignored until social and\r\npolitical conditions have severely deteriorated.\r\nWe are hearing more frequently the term failed\r\nState. It has no clear definition, but it has been used\r\non occasion to justify outside intervention. That may\r\nbe necessary under certain circumstances, but it is in\r\nthe interests of all that such conditions should not\r\ndevelop in the first place. I submit that the causes of\r\nany such so-called failure can be traced far beyond the\r\nborders of the unfortunate country that is so labelled.\r\nThe time is ripe for a new way of looking at\r\ninternational peace and security. No longer can\r\neconomic, social and environmental issues exist in a\r\nparallel universe, divorced from geopolitical\r\nconsiderations. The linkages are becoming all too clear,\r\nas the alarming findings of this years United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) report on\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nconfirm.\r\nDespite our best efforts, we still face the full\r\nrange of threats to our natural environment. Those\r\nthreats are not diminishing. In fact, on a global scale,\r\nprogress by the world community has been glacial in\r\nthe face of ever more pressing demands for action. We\r\nmay say to ourselves that any disastrous outcomes lie\r\nwell in the future, but we can act only in the present.\r\nWe are literally making  or failing to make  life\r\ndecisions for the yet-unborn.\r\nOne of the most clear and present emergencies\r\nhas figured prominently in our statements in the\r\ngeneral debate every year since our country became a\r\nUnited Nations Member; I refer to the need for\r\nimmediate international action to combat climate\r\nchange. Regrettably, I cannot speak with any less\r\nconcern this year. If anything, our appeals must\r\nbecome more urgent. At a time when we speak of many\r\nwars, there is also the war against climate change  a\r\nwar that mankind cannot afford to lose.\r\nI know you can appreciate better than most,\r\nMr. President, that, for my family and me, the issue of\r\nclimate change is a present reality. My island, Woleai,\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nin Yap State, is an atoll with no point higher than two\r\nmeters above sea level. The frequency and the intensity\r\nof storms in our region have been increasing for some\r\ntime.\r\nDuring the last year we experienced three major\r\ntyphoons, as well as other destructive storms. One of\r\nthem triggered massive mudslides on the state of\r\nChuuks higher islands, and 50 people died. In Yap\r\nstate, a recent storm washed away a large and very old\r\ncemetery. These and similar recent events in our other\r\nstates are unprecedented. Everything we are, and hope\r\nto achieve as a people, is under grave threat because of\r\nglobal climate change.\r\nHaving confirmed that the climate change crisis\r\nis real, the entire world also now possesses\r\nindisputable evidence that its steady progression can be\r\nlaid at the doorstep of human activity. Yet some of the\r\nworst polluters among the industrialized countries see\r\nit as their top priority to protect vested interests. They\r\nare purposely delaying the immediate action that is\r\nrequired to begin to turn the tide of destructive climate\r\nalteration.\r\nIn the Framework Convention, it was agreed by\r\nall that those bearing the responsibility for causing this\r\nproblem must take the lead in resolving it. Yet, I must\r\nask today, where is that leadership?\r\nIt is very sad that the Kyoto Protocol, which is a\r\npositive achievement, has been converted by some\r\nGovernments into a political target  a rallying cry for\r\nthe worst polluters. In fact, it represents nothing more\r\nthan a small first step that must be followed up by\r\nstrong subsequent actions if the war against climate\r\nchange is to be at all effective. The scornful attitude\r\ntoward the Protocol shown by some countries will\r\ndoom the entire Framework Convention to utter failure\r\nif the current situation remains unchanged. The Kyoto\r\nProtocol must be brought into effect without further\r\ndelay. The industrial Powers cannot continue to make\r\nthe plea of Saint Augustine, Lord, make me thy\r\nservant, but not yet awhile.\r\nSince our people live in such close harmony with\r\nthe natural environment, we also face a host of other\r\npressing environmental issues. Our coral reefs are\r\ngetting a great deal of international attention partly\r\nbecause of their potential for commercial exploitation.\r\nWe appreciate those possibilities and are determined to\r\npreserve our legal rights in any exploitation that takes\r\nplace.\r\nBut we also appreciate the reefs as our natural\r\nbuffers against the sea and the hosts for marine\r\nresources far beyond the regular bounty of present-day\r\nfishing. This is more than a resource; it is a lifeline for\r\nmany island countries. The serious decline in the health\r\nof coral reefs all over the world must be reversed.\r\nStocks of our only substantial economic\r\nresource  tuna  have seen a marked decline in\r\nrecent years. Other species and key elements of the\r\nocean ecosystem are also now imperilled as never\r\nbefore. The Federated States of Micronesia will be\r\nlobbying for an aggressive oceans resource protection\r\npolicy in both the regional and international arenas.\r\nWater itself, and access to it, is very much a\r\nthreatened resource in our country, where we are\r\nsurrounded by the ocean but have limited fresh water.\r\nWe rely upon rainwater and its collection in the lenses\r\nthat lies beneath our atolls. Every drop is precious. We\r\nsay that a vulnerable life, such as that of a child, is like\r\nmorning dew on a taro leaf, to be handled with care so\r\nthat it does not slip away.\r\nMembers may be surprised to learn that islands in\r\nthe Pacific Ocean, so often pictured in everyones\r\ndream of paradise, are more concerned about drought\r\nthan any other natural threat, including typhoons. Not\r\nonly do we experience the salt-water corruption of our\r\nfresh water and our food crops, as a result of increased\r\nstorm activity and sea-level rise, we also now must try\r\nto cope with droughts brought on by increasingly\r\nunpredictable El Niño activity linked to climate\r\nchange.\r\nFortunately, the world in general seems to be\r\nwaking up to the universal human requirement for\r\naccess to adequate, clean water. The special exposure\r\nof island countries received welcome attention at the\r\nrecent Third World Water Forum in Kyoto. In addition,\r\nI wish to point to a very important, first-ever\r\ninterregional collaboration on this vital subject, in the\r\nform of a Memorandum of Understanding recently\r\nconcluded between our South Pacific Applied\r\nGeoscience Commission and the Caribbean\r\nEnvironmental Health Institute.\r\nI have spoken much about my countrys concerns\r\nbut, of course, we are not alone in these concerns. The\r\nworlds small island developing States face largely the\r\nsame set of issues in different degrees.\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nFor that reason, we were grateful for the\r\ninternational attention generated by the first United\r\nNations Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, held\r\nin Barbados in 1994. The Barbados Programme of\r\nAction, which was the product of that Conference, has\r\nbeen a limited success. The Conference succeeded in\r\nfocusing attention on the unique set of problems our\r\nsmall island nations face. However, it seems that the\r\ninternational community has to some extent been\r\ncontent to raise awareness of the issues, while showing\r\na waning interest in implementing specific measures\r\nduring the years following the Conference itself.\r\nWe applaud the decision to hold a follow-up\r\nconference in Mauritius in 2004, and we look forward\r\nto a frank evaluation of the progress, or lack thereof, in\r\nimplementing the Barbados Plan of Action during the\r\npast 10 years. It is my hope that the Mauritius\r\nconference will afford an opportunity to regain lost\r\nmomentum.\r\nThis is a landmark year for my nation. We have\r\ncompleted 17 years in a post-trusteeship political\r\nrelationship with the United States. By all accounts,\r\nthis has been a success. Never before has free\r\nassociation been attempted on this scale.\r\nI am pleased that both my country and our\r\ndevelopment partner, the United States, have seen fit to\r\ncontinue this relationship into the future by amending\r\nthe treaty between us known as the Compact of Free\r\nAssociation. As we celebrate the success that this\r\nrenewal represents, it is proper to recall the long and\r\neffective stewardship of our region by the United\r\nNations Trusteeship Council.\r\nWe are grateful for the lasting contribution of the\r\nUnited Nations system to the history of Micronesia,\r\nand we look forward to continuing to work in this body\r\nand others in the United Nations system to reach our\r\ncollective goals.\r\nIn closing, I would like to refer to the words of\r\nthe American President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who\r\nonce said,\r\nIf I were asked to state the great objective which\r\nchurch and state are both demanding for the sake\r\nof every man and woman and child in this\r\ncountry, I would say that the great objective is a\r\nmore abundant life.\r\nI believe that the President was speaking of true\r\nabundance, not only in a material sense, but also in the\r\nsense of the security of mind and body that comes with\r\nfreedom, opportunity and human fulfilment.\r\nWe must ask ourselves whether what we are\r\nstriving for here at the United Nations is faithful to that\r\nlofty ideal. This Organization is the greatest forum ever\r\ncreated on this planet. It cannot afford to allow its\r\nimportant role in conflict management to push aside\r\nthe even greater task of managing the conditions that\r\nproduce those conflicts. We bring together here, under\r\nthe guidance of the Charter, for the first time in human\r\nhistory, all kinds of resources necessary to lead\r\nmankind to a more abundant life. Let it not be said of\r\nus later that we failed in that task.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nMr. Joseph Urusemal, President of the Federated\r\nStates of Micronesia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Pascal Couchepin, President of the\r\nSwiss Confederation\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Swiss Confederation.\r\nMr. Pascal Couchepin, President of the Swiss\r\nConfederation, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Pascal Couchepin,\r\nPresident of the Swiss Confederation, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Couchepin: In 2000, at the dawn of\r\nthe new millennium, the heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the Member States met here to reaffirm\r\ntheir shared goals. Three years later, that international\r\nconsensus has eroded. Member States perceive threats\r\ndifferently, and they do not share the same priorities.\r\nSome States emphasize the fight against terrorism and\r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In\r\nother regions in the world, civil wars, small arms,\r\npoverty, hunger and AIDS are the main dangers.\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nCan the international community reach a\r\nconsensus on the objectives to be attained and the way\r\nto achieve them? What importance should we give to\r\nmultilateral cooperation? Has the time not come to\r\nreview the system of collective security inherited from\r\nthe Second World War? Could it be that the United\r\nNations is due for far-reaching reform?\r\nThe fact that so many heads of State and\r\nGovernment have responded to the Secretary-Generals\r\ninvitation is a preliminary answer. It is an encouraging\r\nsign. The Member States look to the United Nations to\r\nseek solutions. We must seize the opportunity of this\r\ndebate to reaffirm our commitment to multilateral\r\ncooperation and the goals of the United Nations.\r\nLife in society demands a minimum of order,\r\nrules and solidarity. That also applies to international\r\nrelations. Switzerland attaches great importance to\r\nrespect for international law, which explains its\r\ncommitment to humanitarian law or to the International\r\nCriminal Court. Without international law, many\r\ncountries would feel themselves at the mercy of the law\r\nof the mightiest. The great powers, like the smaller\r\nones, need a multilateral framework to resolve their\r\ndifferences.\r\nThe time has come to rethink the role of the\r\nUnited Nations. Almost 60 years after the foundation\r\nof the Organization, the threats have changed, as have\r\nthe geopolitical realities. Terrorism and the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction have\r\ntaken on more threatening dimensions. Civil wars have\r\nmultiplied. AIDS has become the most deadly\r\nepidemic in the history of humankind. Poverty is far\r\nfrom being eradicated.\r\nSecurity can no longer be addressed in purely\r\nmilitary terms. We need to review our vision of\r\nsecurity by focusing greater attention on individuals.\r\nBy broadening our approach to security and by placing\r\nfresh emphasis on human security, we can overcome\r\nsome of the current differences between the North and\r\nthe South.\r\nTogether with other countries, Switzerland is\r\nendeavouring to promote the idea of human security.\r\nThis year it will commit itself to the issues of the\r\nproliferation of light weapons and anti-personnel\r\nmines. We hope the General Assembly will establish a\r\nworking group to develop an instrument for marking\r\nand tracing small arms. If the Members of the\r\nOrganization concur, Switzerland is ready to take the\r\nchair.\r\nThe Swiss Government also takes an active\r\ninterest in the issue of migration. We are working with\r\nother countries to establish a global commission on\r\ninternational migration, which will be asked to make\r\nrecommendations.\r\nIn order to promote human security, we must also\r\nkeep the promises made in the field of development. In\r\nthe Millennium Declaration we have undertaken to\r\nensure that globalization becomes a positive force for\r\nall humankind. To that end, we have adopted a series of\r\nclear objectives, and deadlines to meet them have been\r\nset. But merely proclaiming goals is not enough; we\r\nmust now fulfil them. If the rich countries  and my\r\ncountry is among them  do not keep their promises,\r\nthey will end up causing poor countries to lose hope.\r\nIn Cancun, the members of the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) tried to revive trade liberalization.\r\nAlthough positions converged somewhat,\r\ndisagreements persist and there is a risk of lasting\r\nfailure. That would result in weakened growth at the\r\nglobal level, to the detriment of all countries. We need\r\nto give negotiations another chance and, above all,\r\navoid the lure of protectionism.\r\nTo affirm a belief in the multilateral system\r\nshould not blind us to its weak points. The United\r\nNations needs more thorough reform.\r\nSwitzerland considers that the role of the United\r\nNations in the economic and social fields must be\r\ndefined. We must better take account of the links\r\nbetween international security and economic\r\ndevelopment. Relations between the United Nations,\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions and WTO should also be\r\nreconsidered by a group of independent eminent\r\npersons.\r\nWe must also focus our attention on the\r\nfunctioning of the Organization itself. In the General\r\nAssembly, resolutions that are adopted are too often\r\nreduced to the lowest common denominator or to a\r\nlong, vague wish list, with no real impact. The\r\nAssembly must be revitalized. There is a need to\r\nreduce the number of agenda items, limit the length of\r\ntexts and avoid the proliferation of resolutions on\r\nissues that overlap.\r\nWith regard to the Security Council, a consensus\r\nalready exists on the fact that its composition no longer\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nsufficiently reflects contemporary geopolitical realities.\r\nSwitzerland supports the idea of enlarging the Council.\r\nThat could be done without harming its effectiveness as\r\nlong as the increase in the number of members remains\r\nwithin reasonable bounds and takes into account the\r\nvarious regional sensibilities.\r\nIn the last few years, countries not members of\r\nthe Council have been given more opportunities to\r\nparticipate in the Councils work. Switzerland\r\nwelcomes those efforts. However, the crucial decisions\r\ntoo often remain confined to the restricted circle of the\r\nfive permanent members. All members of the Security\r\nCouncil should be permanently involved in the\r\ndecision-making process. It is also important to\r\ninstitutionalize the modalities of participation for the\r\nother Member States. For example, consultation\r\nmechanisms with those States most directly affected by\r\nconflict areas should be strengthened. It should be\r\nnecessary for non-permanent members of the Council\r\nto feel a greater responsibility to represent the views of\r\nthose who elected them.\r\nThe right of veto is a privilege involving special\r\nresponsibilities. It should be used only in exceptional\r\ncircumstances. When a permanent member exercises its\r\nright of veto, would it not be desirable for it then to\r\nexplain its action to the General Assembly? That way,\r\nthat member could make its position better understood\r\nby the international community.\r\nAnother goal is to open the United Nations to\r\ncivil society. Switzerland welcomes the decision of the\r\nSecretary-General to set up a panel of experts to\r\nconsider the possible ways to achieve that.\r\nIt is in this spirit of openness towards civil\r\nsociety that preparations are being carried out for the\r\nWorld Summit on the Information Society, due to take\r\nplace in Geneva in December. More than half of the\r\nworlds population does not have access to a telephone.\r\nThe use of Internet is even more limited. The goal of\r\nthe Summit, a part of the larger framework of the\r\nMillennium Goals, is to discuss ways to narrow the\r\ndigital divide between the rich and poor countries. New\r\ntechnologies must be placed at the service of\r\ndevelopment, human rights and democracy.\r\nI invite all Member States to participate actively\r\nin the Summit. Many heads of State and Government\r\nhave announced their intention to attend, which gives\r\nme great pleasure. I must address, above all, my\r\ncolleagues of the industrialized countries: we must\r\nshoulder our responsibilities. I appeal to them not to\r\nmiss that important appointment. We need a North-\r\nSouth dialogue at the highest level. As I have already\r\nsaid, we must keep our promises.\r\nIn recent months, Iraq has made visible some\r\ninternational tensions. We must now search together to\r\nfind solutions for the future. We all face the same\r\ndanger: that of Iraq falling prey to disorder and\r\ninstability. The United Nations must be given its place\r\nin Iraq and must receive a clearer mandate from the\r\nSecurity Council. At the same time, determined\r\nprogress must be made towards restoring Iraqi\r\nsovereignty.\r\nIn its national history, Switzerland has a long\r\ntradition of harmonious coexistence among its different\r\ncommunities. We well understand that no single\r\npolitical model fits all situations. Nevertheless,\r\nSwitzerland is ready to share its experience and to\r\nprovide support for the process of drawing up a new\r\nconstitution in Iraq.\r\nSwitzerland joined the United Nations as a\r\nneutral country. That does not prevent it from\r\ndefending the universal values to which it is attached.\r\nIn this, Switzerland wishes to collaborate with the\r\nother Member States, drawing on the strength of the\r\nOrganization. At this point, I would like to pay tribute\r\nto the United Nations and all its staff, who have just\r\nsuffered a deadly attack in Baghdad. Every day,\r\nthroughout the world, the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies do irreplaceable work.\r\nThe Secretary-General has spoken of peace as a\r\ndream in suspense. I believe that this also applies to the\r\nother ideals for which the United Nations stands:\r\njustice, solidarity and respect for human dignity.\r\nDreams are an essential part of the vision of the United\r\nNations, but so are action, realism, courage and\r\nperseverance.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Swiss\r\nConfederation for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Pascal Couchepin, President of the Swiss\r\nConfederation, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nAddress by Mr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the\r\nRepublic of South Africa\r\nThe President: The Assembly will hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of South\r\nAfrica.\r\nMr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the Republic of\r\nSouth Africa, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Thabo Mbeki, President of\r\nthe Republic of South Africa, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mbeki: May I congratulate you, Sir,\r\nfor assuming the mantle of the presidency for this\r\nsession of the Assembly and thank the outgoing\r\nPresident, Mr. Jan Kavan. I would also like to echo\r\nwhat other speakers have said about the death of the\r\ndedicated United Nations workers who lost their lives\r\nin the bombing of the United Nations headquarters in\r\nBaghdad last month, including Sergio Vieira de Mello,\r\nan outstanding international civil servant.\r\nWhen we met here last year, we were all\r\nconcerned about what would happen in Iraq. At the\r\nsame time, we were concerned about what role the\r\nUnited Nations would play in the resolution of the Iraq\r\naffair. Dramatic events since then have provided\r\nanswers to those questions. However, those dramatic\r\nevents have raised important and disturbing questions\r\nabout the very future of the United Nations. Central\r\namong them is the question, does the United Nations\r\nhave a future as a strong and effective multilateral\r\norganization enjoying the confidence of the peoples of\r\nthe world and capable of addressing the matters that\r\nare of concern to all humanity?\r\nQuite correctly, as we meet here this time, while\r\nstill preoccupied by the issue of the future of Iraq, I am\r\ncertain that none of us wants to rehash the debate that\r\ntook place on this matter in the period following the\r\nlast general debate in the General Assembly. While for\r\nsome time after that general debate we were concerned\r\nto provide answers to questions about the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in Iraq, today we have to answer\r\nquestions about the impact of the Iraq affair on the\r\nfuture of the United Nations. Matters have evolved in\r\nsuch a manner that to our limited understanding it\r\nseems extremely difficult to resolve the issue of the\r\nrole of the United Nations in Iraq, unless we answer\r\nthe question about the future of the United Nations as a\r\nlegitimate expression of the collective will of the\r\npeoples of the world and the principal guarantor of\r\ninternational peace and security, among other global\r\nissues.\r\nMr. Kirn (Slovenia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nPut differently, we could say that what is decided\r\nabout the role of the United Nations in Iraq will at the\r\nsame time decide what will become of the United\r\nNations in the context of its Charter and of the\r\nimportant global objectives that have been set since the\r\nCharter was adopted.\r\nThis is not a case of the tail wagging the dog;\r\nrather, history has placed at our feet an urgent and\r\npractical test case that obliges us to answer the\r\nquestion: what do we, collectively, want the United\r\nNations to be? What do we do to distinguish the trees\r\nfrom the forest? In that regard we must make the point\r\ndirectly, that as South Africans, we are partners and\r\nactivists who campaign in favour of a strong and\r\neffective United Nations. We do so because of the\r\nplace our country and people occupy in the\r\ncontemporary world.\r\nWe believe that everything that has happened\r\nplaces an obligation on the United Nations to reflect on\r\na number of fundamental issues that are of critical\r\nimportance to the evolution of human society. We are\r\nconvinced that this General Assembly would\r\ndisappoint the expectations of the peoples of the world\r\nand put itself in jeopardy if, for any reason whatsoever,\r\nit did not address these issues.\r\nWe speak as we do because we represent the\r\npeople who are more sensitive to the imperatives of\r\nwhat the world decides, given our experience during a\r\nperiod when apartheid South Africa was correctly a\r\nmatter of focused and sustained interest by the United\r\nNations and the peoples of the world, including\r\nordinary folk, even in the most marginalized areas of\r\nour globe.\r\nThis Organization, and all of us singly and\r\ncollectively, has spoken and frequently speaks about\r\nthe phenomenon of globalization. Correctly, we speak\r\nof a global village driven by recognition of the fact of\r\nthe integration of all peoples within a common and\r\ninterdependent global society.\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nCertainly, humanity is more integrated today than\r\nit was when the United Nations was established more\r\nthan fifty years ago. However, many have drawn\r\nattention to the fact that, whereas objective social\r\nprocesses have led to the emergence of the global\r\nvillage, all of our political collectives have not yet\r\nsucceeded in designing the institutions of governance\r\nmade necessary by the reality of the birth of this global\r\nvillage.\r\nCorrect observations have also been made that the\r\nuse of the image and concept of the village does not\r\nimply that the residents of this village are equal. The\r\nreality is that the same processes that bring all of us\r\ncloser together in a global village are simultaneously\r\nplacing the residents of the global village in different\r\npositions. Some have emerged as dominant, and the\r\nrest as the dominated, with the dominant being the\r\ndecision makers and the dominated being the recipients\r\nand implementers of those decisions.\r\nTo the same extent that our political collectives\r\nhave not designed the institutions responsive to the\r\nevolution of the global village, so have they failed to\r\nrespond to the imbalance in the distribution of power\r\ninherent in contemporary global human society. We\r\nspeak here of power in all fields of human activity. Left\r\nto its internal and autonomous impulses, the process of\r\nglobalization will inevitably result in the further\r\nenhancement of the domination of the dominant and\r\nthe entrenchment of the subservience of the dominated,\r\nhowever much the latter might resent such domination.\r\nThis will include the perpetuation of the\r\ndominant positions by those who are dominant to\r\nensure the sustenance of their capacity to set the\r\nagenda of the global village in the interest of their own\r\nneighbourhoods within that village. Inherent within\r\nthis is, necessarily, reliance on the use of superior\r\npower, of which the dominant dispose, to achieve the\r\nobjective of the perpetuation of the situation of an\r\nunequal distribution of power.\r\nIn this situation, it is inevitable that the pursuit of\r\npower in itself will assert itself as a unique legitimate\r\nobjective, apparently detached from any need to define\r\nthe uses of such power. This also signifies the\r\ndeification of force in all its forms as the final arbiter\r\nin the ordering of human affairs.\r\nHowever, from the point of view of the\r\ndisempowered, the struggle to ensure the use of such\r\npower to address their own interests becomes a\r\nstrategic objective they cannot avoid. Necessarily this\r\nmeans that power would have to be redistributed. That\r\nwould be done to empower the disempowered and to\r\nregulate the use of power by those who are powerful.\r\nThus we come back to what I said earlier.\r\nBecause we are poor, we are partisan activists for a\r\nstrong, effective and popularly accepted United\r\nNations. We take those positions because there is no\r\nway in which we could advance the interests of the\r\npeople, the majority of whom are poor, outside the\r\ncontext of a strong, effective and popularly accepted\r\nUnited Nations. An autonomous process of\r\nglobalization, driven by its own internal regularities,\r\ncan only result in the determination of our future\r\nwithin the parameters set by those who enjoy the\r\nsuperiority of power. The powerful will do this in their\r\nown interests, which might not coincide with ours.\r\nWhen this Organization was established 58 years\r\nago, its objectives and institutions necessarily reflected\r\nboth the collective global concerns as then perceived\r\nand the then balance of power.\r\nAmong other things, our esteemed Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, has drawn attention to the\r\nfact that the United Nations started off as an\r\nOrganization of 51 States and is now composed of 191\r\nStates. Undoubtedly, the perceived and real collective\r\nglobal concerns of our day are, to some extent at least,\r\ndifferent from those that prevailed more than 50 years\r\nago, when the Organization was about a quarter of its\r\npresent size.\r\nFor more than a decade, this Organization has\r\nbeen involved in discussions about its transformation.\r\nOnce more, the Secretary-General has reflected on this\r\nchallenge. The truth is that our discussions have gone\r\nnowhere. Earlier this morning the Secretary-General\r\nannounced steps he will take to facilitate the adoption\r\nof decisions that will help all of us to effect the\r\nnecessary and inevitable transformation of the United\r\nNations. We support the decisions he announced.\r\nThe global resolve to defeat such organizations as\r\nal Qaeda has emerged out of our understanding that\r\ninternational aggression should not necessarily be\r\nexpected to come from formal and recognized State\r\ninstitutions. We have all come to understand that such a\r\nthreat coming from non-State institutions would\r\nexpress itself as the most inhumane and despicable\r\nterrorism, as was most painfully demonstrated on 11\r\nSeptember 2001.\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nOur collective experience  stretching from New\r\nYork and elsewhere in the United States on 11\r\nSeptember 2001; and reaching back to Nairobi and\r\nDar es Salaam, in Africa, earlier still; and, more\r\nrecently, to Bali, Indonesia; to Morocco; to the conflict\r\nbetween Israel and Palestine; to Algeria, India, Russia\r\nand elsewhere; and even our own country  tells us\r\nthat the United Nations, working in defence of the\r\ncollective interests of the peoples of the world, must\r\nensure that we act together to defeat the threat of\r\nterrorism, collectively defined.\r\nAt the same time, we have to take on board the\r\nconviction among some of our Member States that they\r\nconstitute special and particular targets of global\r\nterrorism. Understandably, the argument is advanced\r\nthat it would be unreasonable and irrational to expect\r\nsuch States not to act to deter such terrorist actions\r\nagainst themselves. None of us can defend\r\ninternational rules that prescribe that any one of us\r\nshould wait to be attacked knowing in specific ways\r\nthat we were going to be attacked by identified\r\nterrorists, and then act against those who had attacked\r\nus, with such horrendous costs as were experienced by\r\nthe United States during the 11 September attacks. I do\r\nnot imagine that any one of us would seek to impose\r\nsuch a costly and unsustainable burden on any of our\r\nMember States, which would also violate the self-\r\ndefence provisions of Article 51 of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe also have no choice but to deal with the brute\r\nreality that the reform process of the United Nations\r\nand all its bodies, and other multilateral organizations,\r\nhas got to recognize the reality of the imbalance of\r\npower, as represented by different countries and\r\nregions. At the same time, we must proceed from the\r\nposition that such distribution of power is not\r\nnecessarily in the interests of the peoples of the world,\r\nor even in the interests of those who today have the\r\npower to determine what happens to our common\r\nworld. That includes acceptance of the fact that,\r\ndepending on the place we occupy in the global\r\ncommunity, we have different priorities. Among other\r\nthings, the rich are concerned about ways and means to\r\nmaintain the status quo, from which they benefit. In\r\npractical terms that means that all matters that threaten\r\nto destabilize the status quo must necessarily be\r\nanathema to such people. Such matters will therefore\r\nbe an issue of principal concern to them. Necessarily\r\nand understandably, they will then seek to get the rest\r\nof the world to accept their assertion that the\r\nmaintenance of the status quo must be a universal\r\nhuman preoccupation, precisely the kind of issue on\r\nwhich the United Nations must take a united position.\r\nOn the other hand, the poor are interested in\r\nchanging their conditions for the better. Accordingly,\r\nthey will not accept the maintenance of the status quo,\r\nwhich perpetuates their poverty. Accordingly, among\r\nother things, the poor billions of the world will argue\r\nfor action by the United Nations to ensure the transfer\r\nof resources to themselves, which will enable them to\r\nextricate themselves from their condition of poverty\r\nand underdevelopment, consistent with the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nthe objectives of the Johannesburg World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development and other international\r\nagreements. Inevitably, that will run counter to the\r\npropositions of those who are more powerful than the\r\npoor, namely, the Governments, peoples and countries\r\nthat keep them afloat with development assistance.\r\nThat will require  whether it is stated or not  that\r\nthe recipients of that assistance understand that such\r\nassistance can dry up.\r\nImportant shifts in the global balance of power\r\nand global objectives have taken place since the United\r\nNations was established, 58 years ago. The\r\nOrganization has not substantially changed, in terms of\r\nits structures and mode of functioning, to reflect those\r\nchanges. That has served as a recipe for an inevitable\r\ncrisis, a disaster waiting to occur. And so as we meet\r\ntoday we are confronted by global challenges that the\r\nglobal Organization cannot solve. Impelled by the\r\nurgent issues of the day, some of the powerful will not\r\nwait for all of us to respond to the problems we have\r\nraised, and which they face. They will act to solve\r\nthose problems; their actions will make the statement\r\nthat they do not need the United Nations to find\r\nsolutions to those problems. Simultaneously, that will\r\nmake the practical statement that the United Nations is\r\nirrelevant to the solution of the most pending problems\r\nof our day. The disempowered will continue to look to\r\nthe Organization, understanding, correctly, that they are\r\ntoo weak to advance their interests singly outside the\r\ncollective voice of the United Nations. In that regard,\r\nthey expect that the United Nations will be informed by\r\nits founding documents and other solemn decisions it\r\nhas taken since it was established, all of which have\r\nbeen approved by successive sessions of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nGlobal poverty and underdevelopment are the\r\nprincipal problems that face the United Nations.\r\nBillions across the world expect that the General\r\nAssembly will address that challenge in a meaningful\r\nmanner. The masses of people of our world expect that\r\nthe statements we will make at this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly as representatives of various\r\nGovernments will indicate a serious commitment to\r\nimplement what we say. The poor of the world expect\r\nan end to violence and war everywhere. They want an\r\nend to the killing that is taking too many Israeli and\r\nPalestinian lives. They want Africans to stop killing\r\none another, continuing to convey the message that we\r\nare incapable of living in peace among ourselves. They\r\ndesire the realization of the democratic objective\r\nuniversally: that the people shall govern. They believe\r\nthat we are seriously committed to the objective of the\r\neradication of poverty and the provision of a better life\r\nfor all. They think that we mean it when we say that we\r\nwill not allow the process of globalization to result in\r\nthe further enrichment of the rich and the\r\nimpoverishment of the poor within and between\r\ncountries. They believe us when we say that our\r\ncollective future is one of hope, and not despair. They\r\nare keenly interested to know whether our gathering,\r\nthe United Nations General Assembly, will produce\r\nthose results.\r\nTo collectively meet those requirements will\r\nrequire that each and every one of us  both rich and\r\npoor, the powerful and the disempowered  commit\r\nourselves practically to act in all circumstances in a\r\nmanner that recognizes and respects the fact that none\r\nof us is an island sufficient unto ourselves. That\r\nincludes the most powerful. The latter face the\r\ninteresting challenge, important to themselves in their\r\nnational interests, that the poverty and\r\ndisempowerment of the billions will no longer serve as\r\na condition for their success and their possibility to\r\nprosper in conditions of peace.\r\nWhat we have said today may not be heard,\r\nbecause we do not have the strength to have our voice\r\nheard. Tomorrow we may be obliged to say, No more\r\nwater; the fire next time. As the fires burn, the United\r\nNations will die, consumed by the flames. So will the\r\nhopes of the poor of the world die, as they did at\r\nCancun, Mexico, not so long ago. We must act together\r\nto say in our words and in our actions, as countries and\r\nas the United Nations, that there will be water next\r\ntime, and not fire.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nSouth Africa for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the Republic of\r\nSouth Africa, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Stjepan Mesić, President of the\r\nRepublic of Croatia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of\r\nCroatia.\r\nMr. Stjepan Mesić, President of the Republic of\r\nCroatia, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Stjepan Mesić, President\r\nof the Republic of Croatia, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Mesić (spoke in Croatian; English text\r\nprovided by the delegation): Seldom has the worlds\r\nattention been so focused on the United Nations;\r\nseldom has so much been expected of this\r\nOrganization. The question now being asked\r\nthroughout the world is: Is the United Nations\r\nexperiencing the deepest crisis in its history, and does\r\nit still play a fundamental role in international\r\nrelations?\r\nToday, at the beginning of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, the main reason for the existence of our\r\nOrganization is the same as it was 60 years ago: to\r\nmaintain world peace, reached at the cost of millions of\r\nlives; and to contribute, in an ongoing manner, to the\r\nwell-being of humankind all over the world.\r\nWe live in a world where no one can go it alone,\r\nwithout the help of others, however big and powerful\r\nthey may be. Global solutions require the concerted\r\nand united efforts of all countries and of all the\r\ninhabitants of our planet.\r\nOur Organization is a joint effort by the world\r\ncommunity that is persistently searching for solutions\r\nto the ever-growing problems of our time. I emphasize\r\nthe phrase our Organization, for sometimes it seems\r\nthat we expect the United Nations administration alone\r\nto solve our problems. We tend to forget that the\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nUnited Nations is not some abstract institution with a\r\nwill of its own  one that we depend on  but that the\r\nUnited Nations is the will of each and every one of its\r\n191 Member States. We alone are responsible for the\r\nwill, the decisions, the work and the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThere is no doubt whatsoever that the United\r\nNations needs to be reformed. In this connection,\r\nCroatia welcomes and fully supports the Secretary-\r\nGenerals September report on the implementation of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration. When discussing our\r\nOrganizations reform, especially reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, but also that of the General\r\nAssembly, we must be aware that this is a matter of our\r\nown political will and readiness to accept change.\r\nUnfortunately, and this should be openly stated,\r\nso far there has not been enough political will to move\r\nfrom debates on the subject to actual reform. Croatia is\r\nconvinced that reform of the Security Council is\r\nnecessary and should no longer be put off. In fact, we\r\nourselves decided in the Millennium Declaration that\r\nwe would intensify joint efforts to achieve\r\ncomprehensive reforms of the Security Council in all\r\nits aspects. We have an opportunity to do this at this\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nCroatia has never been a member of the Security\r\nCouncil. However, in the 1990s Croatia acquired\r\nconsiderable experience in the work of that organ and\r\nlearned about its good points and its shortcomings, its\r\nimportance and its true scope. Therefore, unless it\r\nadapts to the new realities in international relations, the\r\nCouncil will not be able to maintain its credibility and\r\nauthority in all parts of the world. What is required is\r\nadherence to the principle of equitable representation\r\nof all United Nations Members in the Security Council.\r\nCroatia is prepared further to intensify its\r\nactivities as an active promoter of regional and world\r\npeace. With this in mind, Croatia has presented its\r\ncandidacy for membership in the Security Council for\r\nthe 2008-2009 mandate. Croatias membership in the\r\nSecurity Council would represent a great tribute to my\r\ncountry and a recognition of all that has been achieved\r\nin bringing peace to South-eastern Europe, which has\r\nfound the strength, after many years of war, to embrace\r\nthe path of good-neighbourly relations.\r\nThe fight against international terrorism is high\r\non Croatias list of priorities. Two years after the 11\r\nSeptember terrorist attacks on the United States, we\r\nstand firmly by our American allies and all those who\r\nrefuse to accept terror, fanaticism and killing as a\r\nmeans of resolving problems between peoples and\r\ncountries. Our collective duty to maintain international\r\npeace and security, which stems from the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, provides an international framework\r\nfor a decisive response to terrorism in the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nCroatias forces are participating in bringing\r\npeace and stability to Afghanistan. Croatia is aware of\r\nthe fact that concerted action by all democratic\r\ncountries is the best response to terrorism. The fight\r\nagainst terrorism requires not only action by the\r\ndemocratic coalition at a global level, but also that of\r\neach of its members at the national and regional levels.\r\nIt is equally important that we intensify our activities\r\nto assist countries lagging behind in economic\r\ndevelopment and other areas. Inequality, injustice and\r\nignorance are fertile breeding grounds for the seeds of\r\nterrorism.\r\nCroatia is still dealing with the consequences of\r\nthe war imposed on it and does not have the economic\r\nresources to participate as a donor in the action for the\r\nreconstruction of Iraq. However, Croatia stands ready\r\nto offer its wealth of experience in post-war\r\nreconstruction, especially in construction work, as well\r\nas the knowledge and operative capacities required for\r\ndealing with post-war confidence-building,\r\nstrengthening the countrys stability, normalizing life,\r\nand mending the tears left by the war in the fabric of\r\ncivil society. I am thinking in particular of the\r\nknowledge and experience acquired in civil police\r\ntraining and activities.\r\nEvents in the Middle East confirm that greater\r\ncourage is required to reach a compromise and ensure\r\ncoexistence than to wage battles; Croatia knows this all\r\ntoo well. We are also aware of the importance of timely\r\nresolutions of the Security Council and General\r\nAssembly, which must be fine-tuned to meet the\r\nchallenges and needs of the peace process, keeping\r\nabreast of realities in the field and encouraging a\r\ngreatly needed agreement. We hope that in its\r\nforthcoming work the General Assembly will take this\r\ninto account when adopting new resolutions on the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nThe importance of United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations has been recognized on many occasions.\r\nThe mandate and character of peacekeeping operations\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nhave been significantly transformed, from operations\r\naimed primarily at disengaging warring parties into\r\ncomplex missions for building democratic systems,\r\nprotecting and promoting human rights, strengthening\r\ncivil society and establishing the groundwork for the\r\nsustainable development of independent States.\r\nThis complexity, and the frequent overlapping of\r\nmandates, requires a high degree of expertise in\r\nvarious areas: from holding democratic elections and\r\ndeveloping judicial systems to establishing police and\r\nmilitary forces that meet international standards and\r\nbasic international legal regulations.\r\nThe United Nations is the only global institution\r\nthat can respond to the challenges of simultaneously\r\nestablishing regional stability, introducing post-war\r\nreconstruction and building a democratic society.\r\nThe United Nations has paid a high price in its\r\npeace efforts. I would like to take this occasion to once\r\nagain express Croatias condolences to the families of\r\nthe victims of the recent barbaric attacks on United\r\nNations headquarters in Baghdad, and to re-emphasize\r\nthat such attacks strengthen our belief that the\r\ndevelopment of collective security systems and global\r\nsolidarity must continue.\r\nCroatia is currently participating in five United\r\nNations peacekeeping missions  in Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea, India and Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Timor-Leste\r\nand Western Sahara.\r\nWe are determined to further intensify our\r\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping missions,\r\nin line with our physical and financial capabilities\r\nregarding the composition and number of troops\r\ndeployed, as well as theatres of operation. Croatia feels\r\nthat as a country that received United Nations\r\npeacekeeping forces at a time when its sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity were attacked, and as a country\r\nwhich hosted one of the United Nations most extensive\r\noperations, it now has a moral obligation to contribute\r\nthis experience to securing peace and prosperity in\r\nother parts of the world.\r\nI would particularly like to stress the importance\r\nof closer cooperation between the Security Council and\r\ntroop contributing countries. We welcome the positive\r\nchanges that have so far occurred in this respect. It is\r\nalso important to ensure the necessary exchange of\r\nviews between the Security Council and the countries\r\non whose territory the peacekeeping operations are\r\nbeing conducted. This is not only a question of due\r\nrespect of those countries sovereignty, but it is also a\r\nway of acquiring full insight into its needs and\r\npriorities.\r\nI also believe that there is the need for the\r\nestablishment of closer links and better coordination in\r\nthe work of the United Nations main bodies, especially\r\nbetween the Economic and Social Council and the\r\nSecurity Council. The Economic and Social Council\r\nand its commissions possess exceptional knowledge\r\nand experience important for the building of post-\r\nconflict societies, something we were able to see for\r\nourselves last year when Croatia presided over this\r\nbody. The establishment of working groups for Guinea-\r\nBissau and for Burundi were steps in the right\r\ndirection, and we hope that this experience will be used\r\nto further the involvement of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil in processes of maintaining and building\r\npeace.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration, this joint vision of\r\nall United Nations members for a more just and better\r\nworld, is a beacon we must follow. Not only must we\r\nfollow it, we must ensure that its goals are fully\r\nimplemented. In this context, Croatia would like to see\r\nthe Economic and Social Council play a greater role in\r\nthe general implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. Therefore, Croatia supports the idea of a\r\nhigh-level dialogue on the achievement of the Goals set\r\nout in the Millennium Declaration taking place at the\r\nnext General Assembly session.\r\nAs a member of the United Nations Commission\r\non Human Rights, Croatia supports the universal\r\nratification of international instruments in the field of\r\nhuman rights. The Commission should continue\r\nunhindered in its activities while carrying out its\r\nmandate. In an effort to promote and protect the human\r\nrights of all people, Croatia is devoting special\r\nattention to the human rights of women, children,\r\nrefugees and disabled persons, and to the human rights\r\nof members of national minorities.\r\nAlthough much has been done in the past period\r\nto improve the position of women in society and\r\npromote principles of gender equality, the international\r\ncommunity still has an obligation to intensify efforts to\r\nprevent all forms of violence against women, and must\r\ntry to include women in decision-making processes,\r\nensuring empowerment of women at all levels. Against\r\nthis background I am proud to say that Croatia has\r\n29\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nprovided the first woman participant in the United\r\nNations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan.\r\nApart from terrorism, one of the biggest security\r\nthreats in the world is the proliferation of nuclear and\r\nother weapons of mass destruction. The\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is, we\r\nbelieve, particularly important in ensuring that the goal\r\nof nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament is\r\nattained. We are concerned by the fact that although the\r\nTreaty was opened for signature and ratification seven\r\nyears ago, it still has not entered into force. The\r\nuniversal character of this Treaty is of great\r\nsignificance and we call on all States that have not\r\nacceded to the Treaty to do so as soon as possible.\r\nCroatia welcomes the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the United Nations to raise the level of\r\nawareness throughout the world of the importance of\r\nthe rule of law and of acceding to international\r\ninstruments in this area. As a member State of the\r\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court,\r\nCroatia has actively participated in the pioneering\r\nendeavour of setting up a new international order\r\nsymbolized by the International Criminal Court, which\r\nhas rightly been termed the embodiment of our\r\ncollective conscience.\r\nCroatia is firmly set on the path of accession to\r\nthe European Union. Croatia, whose strategic national\r\ngoal is to join the European Union, remains dedicated\r\nto the continual promotion of friendly relations with all\r\nits neighbours and to the policy of open borders,\r\nallowing the flow of people, goods and services, but\r\nalso to that of keeping its borders firmly closed to all\r\nforms of transnational crime and illegal migration.\r\nCroatia will continue to actively participate in\r\nregional, European and worldwide initiatives and\r\norganizations, respecting all its international\r\nobligations. For us, the United Nations remains a\r\ncentral point for resolving problems in international\r\nrelations and for promoting the interests of mankind. I\r\nam certain that this years General Assembly session\r\nwill reconfirm the importance of the United Nations\r\nand open a new chapter in our organizations activities\r\nin building peace and security.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Croatia for the statement just made.\r\nMr. Stjepan Mesić, President of the Republic of\r\nCroatia, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by His Majesty King Mohammed VI\r\nof Morocco\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will hear\r\nan address by His Majesty King Mohammed VI of\r\nMorocco.\r\nKing Mohammed VI of Morocco was escorted\r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Majesty King Mohammed VI of Morocco,\r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nKing Mohammed VI (Morocco) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I would like first of all to congratulate you,\r\nSir, on being unanimously elected to chair the fifty-\r\neighth session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly. On behalf of the Kingdom of Morocco and\r\nof the Group of 77 and China, I wish to assure you of\r\nour full support for making a success of this important\r\nsession.\r\nRealizing what a delicate phase our Organization\r\nis going through, many heads of State and Government\r\nhave accepted the invitation extended to them by\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary-General.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to express my\r\nappreciation to him, once again, for the relentless\r\nefforts he is making to shore up the efficiency of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThis is an emotionally charged moment for me, as\r\nI stand on this prestigious rostrum and recall the appeal\r\nand initiatives launched by my late grandfather and\r\nfather, Their Majesties King Mohammed V and King\r\nHassan II, urging concerted action by the international\r\ncommunity to speed up decolonization, especially in\r\nthe Arab Maghreb and on the African continent, and to\r\nuphold the principles of peace, coexistence, openness\r\nand tolerance.\r\nWhat we have done, at the international level, has\r\nalways been guided by the same ideals that inspired the\r\nfounders of our Organization. It seeks to contribute to\r\nthe significant cultural accomplishments made by\r\nmankind thanks to this institution, to preserve human\r\ndignity, and to ensure equality in rights and\r\nobligations, not only between men and women, but also\r\namong nations, large and small, in full respect of\r\ninternational legality, and in a spirit of freedom and\r\nsolidarity.\r\n30\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nWe certainly value the positive and concrete\r\nachievements of the Organization. However, in keeping\r\nwith our firm commitment to its noble mission, we ask\r\nourselves: to what extent has the Organization\r\nmanaged to make peace prevail and to contribute\r\nsignificantly to sustainable development and to the\r\nsettlement of conflicts arising, more often than not,\r\nfrom colonization, which tore apart entire peoples and\r\nnations, especially across our African continent?\r\nMoreover, I should like to assure our brothers and\r\nsisters from African States of Moroccos constant and\r\nunwavering solidarity as well as of its determination to\r\nfurther expand cooperation with them on political,\r\neconomic, social and security matters and to support\r\nconstructive African initiatives. In that context, the\r\ninternational community is called upon to provide\r\ntangible support to the African strategy, the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development, which targets\r\nthe sustainable development of the African continent,\r\nmostly through interaction on the part of its\r\nsubregional entities.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration marked a turning\r\npoint in carrying out the mission unanimously\r\nentrusted to the United Nations in the area of\r\nsustainable development. Indeed, for the first time,\r\nheads of State and Government agreed on specific\r\nobjectives and targets in the social, economic and\r\neducational fields up to the year 2015. As early as\r\nJanuary this year, I made a point of assigning to the\r\nChair of the Group of 77 and China the priority task of\r\nensuring follow-up to those commitments and\r\nmonitoring their integrated implementation. On our\r\nGroups initiative, the General Assembly unanimously\r\nadopted a resolution to that effect last June, pending a\r\nglobal assessment in 2005.\r\nAlthough the Group of 77 and China has sought\r\nto keep development issues high on the Organizations\r\nagenda, one must admit that the main thrust of our\r\nefforts has focused on the serious threats posed to\r\nworld peace in the Middle East region. Despite the\r\nefforts undertaken for the settlement of the Palestinian\r\nquestion  whether by the United Nations or by the\r\ninternational Quartet, through the road map  the\r\nlogic of violence and intransigence continues to\r\nhamper the restoration of peace. The sufferings,\r\ndeprivations and injustices endured daily by the\r\nbrotherly Palestinian people call for stronger\r\ncommitment on the part of the international community\r\nto achieving irreversible implementation of the road\r\nmap.\r\nAs Chairman of the al-Quds Committee, I wish to\r\nsay that I am fully prepared to help to find a just and\r\nfinal solution leading to the establishment of a viable\r\nPalestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,\r\nliving side by side with the State of Israel, in a just,\r\ncomprehensive and lasting peace. With the settlement\r\nof that issue  which is contingent upon the\r\nwithdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab\r\nterritories  the region will regain its original status as\r\na land of religious and cultural coexistence.\r\nSimilarly, Morocco calls for concerted\r\ninternational action that would enable the brotherly\r\nIraqi people to live in security, stability and freedom\r\nand to rebuild their country, while ensuring that their\r\nchoices are fully respected and that their States\r\nsovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity are\r\npreserved.\r\nThe Mediterranean region is particularly affected\r\nby the crises I have just mentioned. We therefore\r\nbelieve that the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue is an\r\nelement that is key for the regions stability, security\r\nand development. In that context, the Kingdom of\r\nMorocco has made the strategic choice of opting for\r\nthe construction of the Arab Maghreb as a region\r\nwhere peace and development may be fostered for the\r\nbenefit of its members, where there must be no\r\ntendency towards balkanization and where the\r\nfundamental national attributes of each Member State\r\nare fully respected.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco, guided by that\r\nMaghreban ideal and committed to safeguarding its\r\ngood-neighbourly relations, has agreed to ease the\r\ntension fomented on its borders and is endeavouring in\r\nall good faith to find an international consensus on the\r\nissue of the Moroccan Sahara. The attempts that have\r\nbeen made thus far to reach a solution show that the\r\nonly way to resolve the issue once and for all is to\r\ncome up with a realistic and final political solution in\r\nkeeping with democratic principles, while fully\r\nrespecting the Kingdom of Moroccos sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity, as the United Nations itself\r\nrecommended in June 2001. In that connection, I\r\nshould like once more to officially proclaim Moroccos\r\npledge to cooperate with the United Nations to bring\r\nabout such a political solution.\r\n31\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nEver since the tragic events of 11 September, the\r\ninternational community has been involved in a\r\nresolute fight against international terrorism, which\r\nposes a threat to mankinds most sacred values. Last\r\nMay, the Moroccan nation was itself the target of the\r\nodious plague of terrorism in a desperate attempt to\r\nchallenge the democratic model that Morocco has\r\nchosen and to undermine its strong commitment to the\r\nvalues of freedom, tolerance and openness. We should\r\ntherefore like to insist on the need for intensified\r\ninternational cooperation to eradicate this scourge.\r\nHere, I should like to strongly denounce the\r\nconfusion deliberately created by those who\r\npersistently associate terrorism with Islam, thus\r\nchoosing to ignore the fact that Islam advocates peace\r\nand respect for human life and flatly rejects injustice\r\nand aggression.\r\nThe United Nations system is now confronted\r\nwith a deeply troubled international environment and\r\nfaces new and major challenges. If the United Nations\r\nis to play its role as the sole regulator of relations\r\nbetween and among States, it is imperative that we\r\nrestore to the concept of universalism its original\r\nmeaning: the obligation shared by all to comply with\r\nthe same ethics and rules of law and with effective\r\nsolidarity among all peoples and nations. To attain that\r\nobjective, mankind must find new reasons to rekindle\r\nhope. We must also have faith and confidence in the\r\nUnited Nations to help it recover its standing and its\r\neffectiveness. Let us therefore make a common pledge\r\nto build up its resources and to strengthen its action.\r\nThe Assembly may count on the help and support of\r\nthe King of Morocco so that, together, we may build a\r\nsafer, more equitable and more humane world.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the King of Morocco for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nHis Majesty Mohammed VI, King of Morocco,\r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Silvio\r\nBerlusconi, President of the Council of\r\nMinisters of the Republic of Italy\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Council of Ministers of\r\nthe Republic of Italy.\r\nMr. Silvio Berlusconi, President of the Council of\r\nMinisters of the Republic of Italy, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Silvio Berlusconi,\r\nPresident of the Council of Ministers of the Republic\r\nof Italy, and invite him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Berlusconi (spoke in Italian; English text\r\nprovided by the delegation): I have the honour to\r\naddress the fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly on behalf of the European Union, over which\r\nItaly presides until 31 December 2003. The associated\r\ncountries, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak\r\nRepublic and Slovenia, align themselves with this\r\nstatement.\r\nOn this occasion, I cannot forget the sacrifice of\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello and the other United Nations\r\nofficials who recently fell victim to blind,\r\nindiscriminate hatred in Baghdad. Allow me also to\r\npay a tribute to the memory of the Foreign Minister of\r\nSweden, Anna Lindh, the victim of a brutal act of\r\nviolence. In their memory and in the memory of all\r\nthose who gave their lives in the service of freedom,\r\ndemocracy and human rights, the European Union pays\r\na heartfelt tribute.\r\nTwo weeks ago, we commemorated the second\r\nanniversary of 11 September. The European Union\r\nremembers with great sorrow the victims of those\r\nattacks, when the horror of terrorism struck this city,\r\nthe United States and the world.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGenerals recent report on the implementation of the\r\ndevelopment goals indicated in the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration and its conclusions. We share\r\nhis view that the multilateral institutions should be\r\n32\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nupdated and strengthened, and we are ready to\r\ncontribute actively to the goal of building an\r\ninternational order based on effective multilateral\r\ninstitutions and within the fundamental framework of\r\nthe Charter.\r\nWe are all convinced that two of the greatest\r\nthreats to peace and security today are terrorism and\r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe European Union condemns all acts of\r\nterrorism, which are threats to democracy, human\r\nrights and economic and social development. We must\r\nbe firm in our determination to destroy this virus and\r\nfree present and future generations from its attacks.\r\nEfforts to combat terrorism must respect human rights\r\nand the fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and\r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nIn this struggle, we are working in close\r\ncollaboration with and give our full support to the\r\nUnited Nations. It is a battle that must be conducted for\r\nthe sake of freedom and democracy  the universal\r\nvalues enshrined in the Charter, which should be\r\ndeeply rooted in the lives of all the peoples of this\r\nglobalized world.\r\nWe must show the same commitment to stop the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their\r\nvectors. We cannot shirk our responsibilities. The\r\nEuropean Union has doubled its efforts to put an end to\r\nthis threat to international peace and security. After\r\nhaving recently agreed to an action plan, we are now\r\nbusy with its implementation. Universal subscription to\r\nthe main multilateral agreements is at the heart of the\r\nEuropean Unions policies.\r\nWorld peace and security are indivisible. The\r\npeoples of Europe are well aware of the need to\r\naddress both the military and the humanitarian aspects\r\nof the North Korean situation. The European Union is\r\nclosely watching the six-party talks aimed at resolving\r\nthe current crisis relative to North Koreas nuclear\r\nprogramme. The European Union sends a firm appeal\r\nto North Korea to completely dismantle its nuclear\r\nprogramme in a prompt transparent, verifiable and\r\nirreversible manner, in compliance with the obligations\r\nderiving from international non-proliferation\r\nagreements.\r\nThe European Union reiterates its request to India\r\nand Pakistan to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to act in\r\ncompliance with Security Council resolution 1172\r\n(1998). We forcefully encourage India and Pakistan to\r\npursue a process of political dialogue that will lead to\r\nan agreement that is satisfactory to all the parties on all\r\nthe controversial points, including Kashmir: a problem\r\nthat cannot be resolved through violence or terrorism.\r\nThe European Union expresses its growing\r\nconcern over the development of the Iranian nuclear\r\nprogramme and the risks of proliferation that it\r\ninvolves. We reiterate our expectation that Iran will\r\ndemonstrate accelerated cooperation and full\r\ntransparency with the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) by acceding to its requests. Urgent and\r\nunconditional acceptance, signature and the\r\nimplementation of an IAEA additional protocol on\r\nsafeguards are of the utmost importance. The\r\ninternational community would consider it a sign of\r\nIrans commitment to the non-proliferation framework\r\nand a step toward the desired reforms.\r\nThe non-proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction is a priority. It requires constant political\r\npressure and the use of every political and diplomatic\r\ninstrument available as the first line of defence. We\r\ncannot allow weapons of mass destruction to end up in\r\nthe hands of terrorists or regimes that represent a threat\r\nto world peace.\r\nIn that context, another grave danger is\r\nrepresented by the increasing spread of light and\r\nportable weapons and by the expansion of armed\r\norganized violence, whose toll in human lives has\r\nbegun to exceed the lives lost in wars.\r\nWith regard to non-proliferation, the European\r\nUnion is firmly committed to supporting the United\r\nNations, particularly the Security Council, in pursuit of\r\nthe following common objectives: strengthening\r\ninternational agreements; increasing support for the\r\nmonitoring agencies; and intensifying controls over\r\nillegal trafficking. Finally, should all political and\r\ndiplomatic measures fail, recourse to coercive\r\nmeasures provided for by the Charter cannot be ruled\r\nout.\r\nHowever, recourse to force can be avoided if all\r\nthe instruments of international law, including human\r\nrights safeguards, come to prevail in all their effects.\r\nWe are all persuaded that that is the proper thing to do.\r\nTo that end, the European Union considers the\r\nInternational Criminal Court a new instrument with\r\n33\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\ngreat powers of deterrence and reiterates its full\r\nsupport for the Court and its universalization.\r\nThe EU is and will always remain committed to\r\nthe promotion and protection of all human rights and\r\nall fundamental freedoms. In that context, we reiterate\r\nour strong support for achieving universal abolition of\r\nthe death penalty. In recent years, important progress\r\nhas been made in that direction, thanks in part to civil\r\nsociety. Abolition is our primary goal. Where capital\r\npunishment continues to exist, however, we are\r\nrequesting that its application be impeded through a\r\ngeneral moratorium on executions.\r\nConflict prevention and crisis management are\r\nessential components of the EUs contribution to\r\nsafeguarding international peace and security. More\r\nthan 40,000 men and women of the European Union\r\nare currently deployed on United Nations-led\r\nor -authorized peace operations in the world.\r\nThe Union is directly involved in missions in the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and, until a few days ago, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, where it demonstrated its will\r\nto contribute to the international communitys efforts to\r\nrestore peace and stability in Africa, including by\r\nmilitary means.\r\nIn light of this concrete commitment, the\r\nEuropean Union reaffirms its support for reforming and\r\nstrengthening United Nations peacekeeping activities.\r\nThe decision by the Council of the European\r\nUnion to strengthen cooperation between the European\r\nUnion and the United Nations in the area of crisis\r\nmanagement reaffirms the Unions strategic relations\r\nwith the Organization. The Union is now drafting\r\nguidelines on the protection of civilians in Union-led\r\npeacekeeping operations that will fully reflect United\r\nNations principles.\r\nDemocracy is the only system of government that\r\ncan fully guarantee respect for human rights while\r\nfostering development, prosperity and peace. The\r\nEuropean Union plans to increase cooperation with\r\ncountries that share the values of freedom and\r\ndemocracy. In a spirit of openness towards the entire\r\ninternational community, the European Union states its\r\nwillingness to give support to all States that intend to\r\ncomply with those principles.\r\nThe European Union continues to consider its\r\nrelations with Africa a priority and recalls the common\r\ncommitment to strengthen this dialogue. The European\r\nUnion has expressed a special interest in strengthening\r\nAfrican peacekeeping and conflict-resolution\r\ncapacities, and has also targeted its initiatives in those\r\nfields on Africa. We are committed to supporting the\r\nefforts of the African Union to establish a regional\r\nsecurity mechanism.\r\nThe European Union will continue to work for\r\ninter-African peace and will support the efforts of\r\nAfrican States to end the many conflicts that afflict the\r\ncontinent. Stable conditions for peace cannot be\r\ncreated, however, without a strategy to eradicate the\r\ncauses of poverty and the social exclusion that fuel so\r\nmany conflicts in Africa and other regions of the\r\nworld.\r\nOn the long road towards managing globalization\r\nand spreading its benefits to all, Europe will remain\r\nfirmly committed to Africa, and the European Unions\r\nprivileged partnership with African countries shall\r\ncontinue. In this framework, we reiterate our support\r\nfor the New Partnership for Africas Development and\r\nfor the hopes that it represents for African\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe European Unions special commitment to\r\nAfrica should also be seen in the framework of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, primarily designed to\r\neradicate poverty, hunger, disease, social and gender\r\ninequality and environmental degradation. In this\r\nregard, we reaffirm our commitment to fight AIDS,\r\ntuberculosis and malaria with a view to eradicating\r\nthem.\r\nThe European Union expresses its deep regret\r\nover the failure to achieve substantial progress at the\r\nCancun Conference organized by the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO), especially with regard to\r\nagricultural products. We remain convinced that\r\nincreased liberalization of world trade, together with\r\ndevelopment cooperation activities, can play a crucial\r\nrole in achieving the Millennium Development Goals\r\nfor a better world. This is why the European Union\r\nbelieves that it is important to continue the negotiations\r\nin the WTO framework with the determination and\r\nflexibility needed to honour the commitments\r\nenshrined in the Doha Development Agenda.\r\nThe European Union has made a financial\r\ncommitment, in line with the Monterrey objectives, to\r\nincrease official development assistance to 0.39 per\r\ncent of gross national product by 2006.\r\n34\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nOur commitment does not stop at financial\r\ncontributions. We also intend to join our development\r\npartners in a process that integrates the fight against\r\npoverty and disease with progress in the field of\r\nsafeguarding human rights and fundamental freedoms,\r\ngood governance and environmental protection. The\r\nprotection of our environment, including through\r\nimplementing the commitments undertaken by signing\r\nthe Kyoto Protocol, is the benchmark of our ability to\r\nfoster sustainable development that reconciles the\r\ndemands of economic and social progress with the need\r\nto protect natural resources. Those two goals are not\r\nalternatives but rather the pillars of the Johannesburg\r\nDeclaration.\r\nThe European Union appreciates the progress\r\nmade since the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly following the presentation of the Secretary-\r\nGenerals report on reform, Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations: an agenda for further change\r\n(A/57/387 and Corr.1). It continues to support the\r\nSecretary-Generals efforts to implement the reforms\r\nneeded to bring about efficient management capable of\r\nachieving the objectives established for the United\r\nNations by the international community. We will work\r\nfor the adoption of a budget plan for the 2004-2005\r\nbiennium that supports the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration and the reform process begun\r\nduring the Assemblys fifty-seventh session.\r\nSafeguarding international peace and security\r\nrequires a strong commitment to address regional\r\nconflicts. A lack of such a commitment could entail\r\nincreased destabilization, to the detriment of the entire\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn the Middle East, the European Union is deeply\r\nconcerned by the deterioration of relations between the\r\nState of Israel and the Palestinian Authority and\r\nreiterates its strong support for the road map, the only\r\nhope for lasting peace and for paving the way towards\r\nstability and development in the region. The European\r\nUnion will lend its efforts to this end within the\r\nQuartet. To implement the road map, it is also\r\nimportant that the European Union and the Group of\r\nEight countries have a specific and generous\r\ncommitment to a plan for the comprehensive economic\r\nreconstruction of the area. Both Israel and the\r\nPalestinian Authority must act urgently to implement\r\nthe commitments contained in the road map.\r\nIn Iraq, the European Union has welcomed the\r\nend of Saddam Hussains regime, whose power was\r\nbuilt on fear and the violation of human rights. The\r\nformation of the Iraqi Governing Council was the first\r\nmajor step towards a representative government of the\r\nIraqi people. The European Union stresses the\r\nimportance of the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty and\r\nthe establishment of a fully representative Iraqi\r\nGovernment through democratic elections. The United\r\nNations has a vital role in this process. The upcoming\r\ndonors conference in Madrid provides a welcome\r\nopportunity for all those who share our concern for\r\nIraqs future to make a positive contribution to the\r\npolitical and economic regeneration of Iraq. We\r\nrecognize that, for the reconstruction process to be\r\nsuccessful, it will need to be accompanied by\r\nimprovements in the security situation.\r\nIn Afghanistan, the European Union wishes to\r\nexpress its full appreciation for the work done by the\r\nUnited Nations within the framework of the Bonn\r\nprocess.\r\nWe will continue to assure our support for the\r\nprocess of democratization also through assistance to\r\nthe reconstruction of the country. The European Union\r\nunderlines the importance of an effective reform in the\r\narea of security as the basis for lasting security and\r\nstability in Afghanistan and throughout the region. The\r\npreparations for the 2004 elections to choose a\r\ngovernment and parliament that are representative of\r\nall components of Afghan society are of primary\r\nimportance.\r\nIn accordance with the conclusions of the\r\nEuropean Council of Thessaloniki, the European Union\r\nwill continue to work tirelessly in support of the\r\nSecretary-Generals efforts to achieve a\r\ncomprehensive, just, viable and functional solution to\r\nthe Cyprus problem, consistent with the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nRelations between the countries of Europe and\r\nLatin America are rooted in history and provide the\r\nbasis for intense collaboration and for the European\r\nUnions strong interest in the region. The European\r\nUnion is committed to further improving the overall\r\narrangements of its relations with the countries of\r\nCentral and South America.\r\nLastly, the European Union will continue to\r\nsupport the processes of stabilization, democratization\r\nand development in the western Balkans. At the\r\n35\r\nA/58/PV.7\r\nEuropean Union-Balkan Summit in Thessaloniki, the\r\nEuropean Union reaffirmed its full consensus on the\r\nfuture European perspective of the region. The\r\nrealization of those hopes will depend on the ability of\r\nthe individual countries in the region to implement\r\ninstitutional, governmental and economic reforms, and\r\non the fulfilment of the political criteria of the\r\nEuropean Union, including full cooperation with the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia and progress in the field of respect for the\r\nrights of minorities.\r\nThe events of recent decades have profoundly\r\nchanged the world order. Today the conditions exist for\r\nthe democracies of the world to unite in order to spread\r\nthose values that are the unavoidable premise for all\r\nothers: freedom and democracy.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration we promised food,\r\nwater, health and education to the greatest possible\r\nnumber of citizens. Now the democracies must commit\r\nthemselves to providing, also and above all, the\r\nintangible values from which the other, more tangible\r\nones spring, because without the prerequisites of\r\nfreedom and democracy there can be no hope for\r\nlasting peace and development, nor can there be an\r\nultimate defeat of the challenge of poverty.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Council\r\nof Ministers of the Republic of Italy for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Silvio Berlusconi, President of the Council of\r\nMinisters of the Republic of Italy, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the general debate for this meeting.\r\nThe meeting rose at 2.05 p.m.\r\n"
