(Saint Lucia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mrs. Veiga (Cape\r\nVerde), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, President of\r\nthe Republic of Latvia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the President of\r\nthe Republic of Latvia.\r\nMrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, President of the\r\nRepublic of Latvia, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, President of the Republic of\r\nLatvia. I invite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Vike-Freiberga: I would like to begin\r\nby extending Latvia’s heartfelt congratulations to\r\nMr. Julian Hunte on his appointment as President of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly. Latvia highly values\r\nhis extensive experience and is confident that he will\r\nsucceed in his efforts to hasten the pace of reforms\r\nwithin the Assembly. I am pleased that a broad\r\nconsensus on the main goals of these reforms was\r\nachieved during the previous session, and I wish him\r\nsuccess in his responsible duties.\r\nThree days ago, the people of Latvia made a\r\nhistorical decision that will influence their country’s\r\ncourse of development over the next foreseeable\r\ndecades, or even centuries. On 20 September 2003, the\r\npeople of Latvia decided, in a referendum, to join the\r\nEuropean Union. In voting for accession to this\r\ninfluential body of free and democratic nations, my\r\ncountry became the last of 10 candidate States to\r\nconfirm its commitment to a strong and united Europe\r\nand to the extension of a growing family of secure and\r\nprosperous nations.\r\nIt is our hope that this extended Union of 25\r\nmember States will serve not only to promote the\r\nwelfare of its citizens, but also to become an even more\r\nsignificant contributor to international stability and\r\nworldwide prosperity. The European Union is already\r\nthe world’s largest provider of development assistance\r\nand Latvia looks forward to undertaking the\r\nresponsibilities and commitments that this entails. This\r\nincludes taking an active part in the formulation of\r\npriorities to ensure that the assistance provided by the\r\nEuropean Union reaches those who need it most.\r\nLatvia and her Baltic neighbours reappeared on\r\nthe international stage only twelve short years ago,\r\nfollowing half a century of totalitarian rule under Nazi\r\nGermany and Soviet Russia. Our success story of\r\nrebirth and renewal testifies to the fact that through\r\nhard work and dedicated effort the re-establishment of\r\ndemocratic societies and functioning market economies\r\ncan be realized within a relatively short period of time.\r\nMany other nations in transition are now\r\nundertaking similar paths of development and reform.\r\nLatvia is already sharing its experiences with other\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\ndeveloping countries, and will continue to do so in the\r\nfuture.\r\nTwelve years ago, when Latvia became a member\r\nof the United Nations, the Soviet Union was in the\r\nprocess of breaking up and the Cold War was coming\r\nto an end. As the threat of a nuclear conflagration\r\nbetween two mutually hostile superpowers receded,\r\nnew challenges to world security were coming to the\r\nfore, and older ones were showing no sign of going\r\naway.\r\nPerhaps humanity’s greatest problem lies in its\r\npropensity for violence, which manifests itself in all\r\nlevels of society, starting with the abusive individual in\r\nthe family household and ending in armed conflict in\r\nthe international arena. Even peaceful countries with\r\nlengthy traditions of non-intervention and domestic\r\ntranquillity are finding themselves faced with tragic\r\nacts of senseless violence that include the beating and\r\nkilling of immigrants and political assassinations.\r\nThe unrest and turmoil in the Middle East, which\r\nhas lasted for well over five decades, shows no sign of\r\nabating and can only come to an end once violence is\r\nfirmly forsaken as a means for obtaining political ends.\r\nLatvia views the road map for peace, which foresees a\r\nfree and secure State of Israel living in peace alongside\r\nan independent Palestinian State as the only feasible\r\nmeans for ending the dangerous impasse that both sides\r\nhave now reached. The alternative is a continuing\r\nescalation of bloodshed, a never-ending cycle of killing\r\nand mounting mutual hostility.\r\nLatvia is ready to promote the establishment of a\r\nlasting peace in the region, under the auspices of both\r\nthe United Nations and the European Union. We\r\nencourage the interested parties to do everything within\r\ntheir means to de-escalate tensions and put the peace\r\nprocess back on track.\r\nThe establishment of a genuine and lasting peace\r\nbetween the Israelis and the Palestinians would also\r\nhave an additional benefit. It would remove the\r\nPalestinian cause as an excuse for terrorists to justify\r\ntheir actions of murder and destruction. As the events\r\nof the last few years so poignantly reveal, terrorism and\r\narms proliferation have become two of the largest\r\nthreats to world security today.\r\nCurrently, the international community is deeply\r\ndivided about the ethics and feasibility of\r\nimplementing direct military action against\r\nGovernments that are deemed to support and sponsor\r\nterrorism. In the case of Afghanistan and Iraq, where\r\nundeniably repressive regimes were removed by force\r\nthrough outside intervention, the military measures\r\nundertaken by the United States and its allies will have\r\nto be followed by comprehensive international efforts\r\nto help those countries rebuild their societies and their\r\neconomies. I am certain that most of us would agree on\r\nthe need for reconstruction and security regardless of\r\nour opinion about the foreign military presence in these\r\ntwo countries.\r\nWithin the limited means at its disposal, Latvia\r\nhas sent humanitarian assistance and military medical\r\npersonnel to Afghanistan and has dispatched a military\r\ncontingent to help maintain order in post-war Iraq.\r\nAs we collectively seek to avoid a clash of\r\ncivilizations between different societies in the world,\r\nso we must seek to reduce the growing discrepancies\r\nbetween the rich and the poor. Poverty afflicts every\r\nsingle member country of the United Nations. About\r\nthree billion people, or half the world’s population,\r\nstruggle to subsist on the equivalent of less than two\r\ndollars a day. Seventy per cent of the world’s poorest\r\npeople live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for\r\ntheir subsistence. The Millennium Goal of reducing\r\npoverty and of halving the proportion of people earning\r\nless than one dollar a day can be achieved only by\r\nimproving the plight of poor farmers and creating\r\nviable agricultural communities. Poor farmers in\r\ndeveloping countries cannot compete with products\r\nsubsidized by the treasuries of the world’s richest\r\ncountries.\r\nAt this month’s World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nMinisterial Conference in Cancún, Mexico, United\r\nNations Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged the WTO\r\nmember States to say no to trade policies that\r\naggravate poverty and to say yes to bold and sensible\r\nsteps that will revive the global economy and set the\r\nnew course for development.\r\nPoverty also provides fertile ground for modern-\r\nday slavery and the trafficking of humans, which\r\ncontinues to occur in nearly all regions of the globe. At\r\nthe beginning of the twenty-first century, an estimated\r\n27 million people are still being bought, sold, held\r\ncaptive, brutalized and exploited for profit. Together\r\nwith non-governmental organizations that are working\r\nto stop slavery, and through international organizations\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nsuch as the United Nations, our Governments must\r\nhelp those slaves break free from their chains.\r\nWe all live in a world where such deadly diseases\r\nas HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and, lately, SARS,\r\nto name a few, know no borders. It is only through the\r\ncontinued vigilance of our countries’ health officials\r\nand through close international cooperation that we\r\nwill ever be able to keep those mortal dangers in check.\r\nI hope that yesterday’s AIDS conference has\r\nstrengthened the resolve and confidence of participants\r\nto overcome this great affliction.\r\nThe Government of Latvia is actively pursuing its\r\ncommitments under the Millennium Declaration to\r\nattain the Millennium Development Goals. For\r\nexample, it has prepared a national action plan to\r\naddress the needs of children in consultation with local\r\nauthorities, non-governmental organizations and the\r\nchildren themselves. In cooperation with the United\r\nNations Development Programme office in Riga, it has\r\nalso established a working group that is devoting\r\nparticular attention to the reduction of child mortality\r\nand the improvement of mothers’ health.\r\nDuring the twentieth century, mankind inflicted\r\nmore environmental damage on our planet than during\r\nall of the previous centuries combined. If we do not\r\ndevote greater efforts to reducing environmental\r\npollution, including greenhouse gas emissions, then\r\nfuture generations stand to inherit a planet with\r\nincreasingly destructive climate change and with a\r\nforest cover that is restricted to scattered nature\r\nreserves. We must avoid reaching the stage at which\r\nthe Earth’s energy and food resources become\r\nirreversibly depleted. People and Governments must be\r\nwilling to make difficult economic sacrifices for the\r\nsake of a cleaner environment.\r\nSince its foundation in 1945, the United Nations\r\nhas seen the number of its Member States increase\r\nalmost fourfold. It has seen European colonialism, the\r\nCold War and apartheid come to an end. It has\r\nsuccessfully brokered the cessation of hostilities in\r\nCyprus, East Timor and other countries. It has provided\r\ntrillions of dollars of development assistance to\r\nnumerous countries. Latvia believes that the United\r\nNations should remain the principal world body for the\r\nmediation of international disputes and for the\r\nformulation of universal rules of conduct that all abide\r\nby.\r\nHowever, the United Nations has also been\r\ncriticized for being slow, unwieldy and ineffectual.\r\nFew would disagree that it has reached a point where\r\nchanges within its structure are required so that it can\r\neffectively deal with the new challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. Let us recall that a working group on the\r\nreform of the Security Council was created already ten\r\nyears ago, shortly after the collapse of the bipolar\r\nworld that had dominated international relations for\r\ndecades. At that time there were hopes that an\r\nunprecedented degree of unity might be reached within\r\nthe United Nations community. For the moment,\r\nhowever, it appears that any substantial changes within\r\nthe United Nations will have to await a renewed\r\nclimate of consensus, which is not likely to precede the\r\nresolution of the crisis in the Middle East, the settling\r\nof trade disputes and the establishment of greater unity\r\nabout agricultural subsidies, arms proliferation and\r\nenvironmental issues.\r\nLatvia firmly believes in the universal ideals that\r\nthis Organization embodies and is ready, within the\r\nlimited means at its disposal, to contribute to their\r\nrealization. The United Nations presents our 191\r\nMember States with the unique opportunity to work\r\ntogether for the benefit of humanity. Let us hope that\r\nour efforts will be coordinated and constructive, so that\r\nwe may make the twenty-first century one of security,\r\npeace, and continued development.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I would like to thank\r\nthe President of the Republic of Latvia for the\r\nstatement she has just made.\r\nMrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, President of the\r\nRepublic of Latvia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos, President of\r\nthe Republic of Paraguay\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of\r\nthe Republic of Paraguay.\r\nMr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos, President of the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, it is my honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nMr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos, President of the Republic\r\nof Paraguay, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Duarte Frutos (spoke in Spanish):\r\nTwo hundred years after the first cry of freedom in\r\nLatin America, our peoples are propelled by new winds\r\nof emancipation. A fresh generation of leaders has\r\ntaken up the old flags of our heroes to demand real\r\nglobal interdependence through an economic order\r\ninspired by solidarity and by the building of a lasting\r\npeace.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nfor the commendable work that he has done to uphold\r\nand promote the principles that were enshrined in the\r\nCharter 58 years ago.\r\nFor too long, Latin America had been on the\r\nmargins of history. It had been reduced to playing the\r\npart of providing inexpensive labour and raw materials\r\nto more developed economies, while its most brilliant\r\nminds were lured away and absorbed by large urban\r\nmarkets. Our region has also fallen victim to\r\nmercenaries, soldiers of fortune and heartless people\r\nrepresenting dehumanizing and destructive transnational\r\ncorporations that overthrew Governments, provoked\r\nwars between friendly countries and squandered our\r\ncountries’ resources.\r\nNevertheless, we are not here to complain about\r\nthose ignominious days. Nor are we here to cling to the\r\nglories of the past. On the contrary, we have come to\r\nexpress our firm will to work together for a dignified\r\npresent and a secure future for those who are now\r\ndying from hunger, thirst, cold and easily preventable\r\nand treatable diseases. Our voices today arise from our\r\nroots, cultures and traditions, and proclaim a Latin\r\nAmerica that is integrated into the world, with a fresh\r\nsense of fraternity, to make the lives of our peoples\r\nmore humane and enriching.\r\nWe must seek a multipolar world in which\r\ncultures enhance rather than confront one another and\r\nregional production promotes peace and prosperity in\r\nthe world to save present and future generations from\r\nthe terrible scourge of new major conflicts. Let us\r\nmake a renewed commitment, without scepticism and\r\nwith the intrinsic dignity that God has bestowed on\r\nevery human being.\r\nIn Paraguay, a small but dignified country, we are\r\nmaking a major effort at capacity-building with respect\r\nto national and international communities. A sine qua\r\nnon is to revive production, attract investors back and\r\nsell our products on world markets.\r\nAlthough our peoples have suffered long years of\r\nrecession and deprivation because of the foreign debt\r\nburden, my Government has managed to redirect public\r\nresources towards education and to coordinate the\r\nefforts of civil society and the State to democratize\r\nyoung people’s access to the world of knowledge. Only\r\neffective human capital, with ethical principles, will\r\nenable us to survive and grow in a climate of\r\nglobalization. Towards that end, we fervently hope for\r\na globalization that involves not simply economics but\r\nalso justice, science, technology and development. Our\r\nchallenge is to achieve global progress.\r\nI come from an island surrounded by land, as\r\nParaguay’s renowned writer Augusto Roa Bastos so\r\naptly described the country. But with the advent of\r\ndemocracy, to the credit of the people’s self-sacrifice,\r\nour country has restored its identity, memories and\r\ndreams. We Paraguayans accept our geographical\r\ndisadvantage as an opportunity to be creative and\r\nindustrious, as our development requires. For this\r\nreason, we appeal for international solidarity to help to\r\nimplement the plan of action of Almaty, which is\r\ndesigned to overcome the limitations of landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries, including Paraguay.\r\nWe have a strong ethical belief in this historic\r\nobjective. The inequality that impoverishes most of the\r\nworld is immoral. There is not a trace of Christianity in\r\nthe lack of solidarity with the destitute. In that regard,\r\nthe individual must be treated as a whole person, so\r\nthat he may in turn bring well-being to his family, for\r\nthe sake of all society. If leaders do not provide a moral\r\nexample, it will not be possible to advance towards a\r\ndemocracy that is embraced by the people and fosters\r\ntrue participation in a society that is distinguished by\r\nits moral capital, the essential basis of a humanistic and\r\nhumanizing economy. A world in crisis requires\r\nhumanism, not humanitarianism. The world seeks\r\nsolidarity, and not mere charity.\r\nWe must understand that the impoverishment of a\r\nlarge share of humankind jeopardizes world balance. It\r\nis true that many countries have become impoverished\r\nnot simply as a result of outside influences but also\r\nbecause of corruption and impunity on the part of local\r\nleaders. But it is equally true that without an ethical\r\nbelief in the international order and the strong will of\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nleaders to praise God and renounce historical patterns\r\nof greed of rich countries, the world that we leave to\r\nour children will not be fit for living.\r\nUnfortunately, while we are shaping a future\r\nbased on ideals and utopias in this hallowed chamber\r\nof world peace, we have not figured out how to end\r\nwar, since in various parts of the world the arms race\r\ncontinues, as does growing poverty. It bears repeating\r\nthat, as leaders of our respective countries, we must\r\ncease speaking in terms of friends and enemies, which\r\nhas a weakening and destructive effect. We must use\r\nthat energy and those resources to ensure just social\r\ndevelopment in economically less-developed countries.\r\nWithout pluralistic and equitable participation in\r\ncrucial international policy decisions discussed here in\r\nour Organization and a commitment to multilateralism,\r\nthe United Nations and, in particular, the Security\r\nCouncil, will inevitably fail in its noble objective of\r\nmaintaining peace in the world.\r\nIn this context, Paraguay supports the aspirations\r\nof Latin America and other continents to be\r\nrepresented in the Security Council, where the presence\r\nof Brazil as a permanent member would fulfil the great\r\nand legitimate interests of our region.\r\nParaguay would like to reiterate here its full\r\nsupport for the efforts and aspirations of the Republic\r\nof China on Taiwan to become a fully-fledged member\r\nof the international community through the United\r\nNations. In this regard, we appeal to the principles of\r\nuniversality contained in the Charter so that this long-\r\noverdue and heartfelt desire of the sister Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan may be fulfilled.\r\nAs I said some weeks ago in my own country —\r\nand as I reaffirm here — the ethics of fraternity and\r\nmutual respect must govern international relations\r\ntoday if humanity is to make progress towards lasting\r\npeace inspired by the rule of law and reason.\r\nWith the same vigour with which we advocate\r\nworldwide peace, we condemn terrorism in all its\r\nmanifestations and sources. In Paraguay, we have\r\npledged — a pledge we are resolutely fulfilling — to\r\ncombat the breeding grounds of terrorism and its\r\nfinancial support, drug trafficking. We shall not deviate\r\nfrom that commitment. Likewise, we energetically\r\ndenounce the terrorist action against the United\r\nNations headquarters in Baghdad that occurred\r\nyesterday and that of 19 August. We mourn the death\r\nof outstanding United Nations staff members, including\r\nthe distinguished Brazilian and Latin American citizen,\r\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. In that same line of\r\naction, in Paraguay we are dismantling organized crime\r\nand money-laundering, regardless of who promotes,\r\nconceals or commits those crimes.\r\nI reiterate that our country will no longer be a\r\nbridge, corridor or end point for such criminal\r\noperations. With the same energy with which we\r\ncombat crime and illegality, we reaffirm our\r\nunwavering commitment to respecting human rights,\r\nwhich is an increasingly important part of our domestic\r\nand foreign policies, promoting full enjoyment of\r\npublic and individual freedoms for the peoples of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe fight for freedom, democracy, social equity\r\nand world peace will be of no avail if we do not more\r\nresponsibly face the challenges for the preservation of\r\nour environment. Let us seek the well-being of our\r\npeoples today but not forget that our children will live\r\non this planet tomorrow. In Paraguay and Latin\r\nAmerica, we are determined to be the protagonists and\r\narchitects of a shared destiny of responsibility, justice\r\nand equality.\r\nFinally, may the new global order be more\r\nhuman, supportive, responsible and participative, and\r\nmay its essential purpose be to promote development,\r\nprogress and the well-being of all the peoples of the\r\nEarth in an environment that is truly more just, fair and\r\nbalanced. May God bless us and may we build together\r\nthe peace that our children and future generations need.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Paraguay for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos, President of the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hâmid Karzai, President\r\nof Afghanistan\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The\r\nAssembly will hear an address by the President of\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nMr. Hâmid Karzai, President of Afghanistan, was\r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency\r\nMr. Hâmid Karzai, President of Afghanistan, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Karzai: There is no reality more\r\noppressive than the silence of a nation. For too long,\r\nAfghanistan was a silenced nation, a country without a\r\nvoice. After decades of being suppressed into silence,\r\nour nation is beginning to have a voice of its own.\r\nRecovering from the tragedy of war and destruction,\r\nAfghanistan is determined to reverse the effects of the\r\nsuffering it has long endured.\r\nA lot has changed in Afghanistan over the last\r\ntwo years. But no change is so critical and pervasive as\r\nthe animated response of the people of Afghanistan to\r\nthe recent developments in our country. I find no sight\r\nmore rewarding than that of our young girls and boys\r\nflocking to schools every morning. I find few things\r\nmore engaging than the company of elderly\r\nrepresentatives who come to Kabul from far-flung parts\r\nof the country to discuss their priorities for\r\nreconstruction. And, in the same order, there is nothing\r\nmore enthusing than the active participation of Afghan\r\nmen and women in the process of public consultation\r\nfor the new constitution.\r\nFrom the public consultations conducted in\r\nconnection with the constitution drafting process, we\r\nknow that the people of Afghanistan want a modern,\r\nunitary State that is committed to Islamic values and\r\nthe preservation of peace and national unity, a State\r\nthat ensures security for all its citizens, enforces justice\r\nand the rule of law and promotes prosperity. As in any\r\npost-war society, the need for security and for\r\nremoving the threat of arms and armed factions is a\r\ncompelling issue for all Afghans. Our people demand\r\nthe establishment of truly national and competent\r\ninstitutions, notably the army and the police. Afghans\r\nwant State institutions that are professional and\r\nrepresentative and an administration that is efficient\r\nand free of corruption. The Afghan people want\r\ntolerance for other religions, protection of human rights\r\nand affirmative action to promote the rights of women.\r\nSince I addressed the Assembly in September of\r\nlast year, Afghanistan has taken significant strides in\r\nthe path of post-war reconstruction. While total\r\nstability may not have been achieved yet, today\r\nAfghanistan is more stable and peaceful than in any\r\nother period in its recent history. The International\r\nSecurity Assistance Force (ISAF), to the credit of the\r\nparticipating countries, has done a tremendous job of\r\nsecuring the nation’s capital. That is partly the reason\r\nthat people from other parts of the country have\r\ndemanded that ISAF be expanded to their areas, too.\r\nWe see NATO’s decision to take over the command of\r\nISAF in Kabul as a positive development. The Afghan\r\npeople have also welcomed the provincial\r\nreconstruction teams that are supported by the coalition\r\nmember States. Reconstruction and security are tied to\r\none another, and we are absolutely certain that no\r\nmatter what flag they fly, forces that ensure stability\r\nwill be welcomed throughout Afghanistan.\r\nHowever, we recognize that providing security to\r\nthe people of Afghanistan is ultimately our own\r\nresponsibility. We are grateful to the international\r\ncommunity, the United States and Germany in\r\nparticular, for making a determined effort to help us\r\nembark on a process of reforming and rebuilding our\r\nsecurity institutions, namely the Afghan National Army\r\nand the national police.\r\nAfter an arduous process of restructuring, we\r\nhave just completed the reform of the Ministry of\r\nDefence. That step is now paving the way for the\r\nimplementation of the nation-wide programme on\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration, which\r\nwill begin in earnest in mid-October with assistance\r\nfrom Japan.\r\nA Constitution is the bedrock of the modern\r\nState. Under the Bonn Agreement, my Government\r\nwas assigned the historic task of giving Afghanistan its\r\nnew Constitution. The commission assigned that task\r\nhas just finished the draft Constitution. The draft will\r\nbe submitted in December for approval to a\r\nconstitutional grand council of the Afghan people,\r\nwhich in our language is called a Loya Jirga. Work on\r\nthe reform of the judicial system and on drafting new\r\nsecondary laws has also continued, with notable\r\noutcomes achieved in recent months. The laws on\r\npolitical parties and banking have now been officially\r\nadopted.\r\nHaving started from a below-zero baseline, the 30\r\nper cent economic growth rate that Afghanistan\r\nenjoyed last year is a promising start. Committed as we\r\nare to an open-market economy, and seeing the private\r\nsector as the true engine for growth, we have moved\r\naggressively to create the legal and financial\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nframeworks needed for a positive environment for the\r\nprivate sector. Our newly adopted laws governing\r\ninvestment, banking and property rights, the new stable\r\ncurrency and the bureaucratic reforms we have enacted\r\nprovide a liberal and conducive underpinning for rapid\r\neconomic growth. Like never before, Afghanistan is\r\nopen to business.\r\nOnce, in the past, Afghanistan was at the centre\r\nof a global threat, that of terrorism. Our vision for the\r\nfuture is that Afghanistan should be a centre for\r\neconomic opportunity. We do not call ourselves a land-\r\nlocked country; rather, we are a land-bridging country.\r\nAfghanistan connects South Asia, Central Asia and the\r\nMiddle East, a fact to which geo-strategists have long\r\nbeen attracted. But it is time that Afghanistan’s vast\r\npotential for facilitating trade and economic activity is\r\nexploited.\r\nThrough such nationwide programmes as the\r\nNational Solidarity Programme, the Government aims\r\nto take reconstruction to the villages and households of\r\nAfghanistan. Perhaps no other priority features more\r\nwidely in the demands of the Afghan people than the\r\nprovision of education. Today, fortunately, almost 40\r\nper cent of the students and teachers in primary and\r\nsecondary education are female. That is a huge increase\r\nfrom the close to zero percentage that we inherited\r\nfrom the Taliban. Millions of textbooks have been\r\npublished, and schools are being built at a higher rate\r\nthan ever. However, in other areas of service-provision\r\nthe need is much greater than our capacity to deliver.\r\nThe struggle against the production of, and\r\ntrafficking in, narcotics continues. We see a direct\r\nconnection between narcotics and terrorism, and it is in\r\nour absolute national interest to fight both. Both are\r\ntransnational challenges. We in the region and in the\r\ninternational community must take the strategic\r\ndecision, in the spirit of true partnership, to fight\r\nagainst both menaces.\r\nAs we acknowledge that the road ahead for\r\nAfghanistan is long and tortuous, we appreciate the\r\nfact that significant achievements have been made over\r\nthe last two years. The people of Afghanistan are\r\ngrateful to the international community for its crucial\r\nsupport. While countries that have extended a friendly\r\nhand to Afghanistan are far too many to thank\r\nindividually, it would be unfair not to single out the\r\nUnited States, the European Union and Japan for\r\nspecial thanks. The United States of America has led\r\nthe international community by example in offering\r\nsupport for Afghanistan. The additional assistance\r\nprovided to us under the Accelerated Success Initiative\r\nwill go a long way towards rebuilding our country. The\r\nneighbours of Afghanistan also have a special place in\r\nour hearts. Our people will always remember the warm\r\nwelcome they received from their brothers and sisters\r\nin Pakistan and Iran. In addition, Afghans hold\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and his Special\r\nRepresentative Lakhdar Brahimi in very high esteem.\r\nTheir kind-hearted attention to Afghanistan is highly\r\nappreciated.\r\nCognizant of our new situation and the emerging\r\nopportunities that exist today, we are determined to\r\nbuild friendly, civil and constructive relationships with\r\ncountries of the world. We continue to extend a sincere\r\nhand of friendship to Pakistan and all our other\r\nneighbours on the basis of the requirements of a\r\ncivilized relationship. We will never permit our\r\nterritory to be used against any other country, and\r\nexpect the same in return.\r\nWe are deeply concerned about the loss of\r\ninnocent lives in Palestine and Israel. We support the\r\nrealization of the right to self-determination for our\r\nPalestinian brothers and sisters.\r\nWe are fully committed to remaining a resilient\r\npartner with the international community in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nAll the achievements I have just noted amount\r\nonly to a good beginning. Our challenge is to stay the\r\ncourse. That will depend not only on the resolute\r\ndetermination of the Afghan people, but also on the\r\ncontinued engagement of the international community.\r\nWhile the achievements are significant, and\r\nalthough challenges are inevitable, today, in this forum,\r\nI wish to point to what can potentially amount to a\r\ncritical threat, namely, the ongoing threat of terrorism.\r\nThe crisis in Afghanistan may well be over, but the\r\nforces of violence continue to threaten. Embodied in\r\nvarious manifestations, from militant infiltrations to\r\nhateful teachings at places disguised as madrassas,\r\nterrorism continues to make inroads into the space of\r\npeace and prosperity that we want to secure for our\r\nnation.\r\nIslam, our universalist religion, has absolutely no\r\nplace for terrorism. The apostles of hatred who preach\r\nmurder in the name of religion and who abuse the name\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nof Islam and the sanctity of madrassas are the enemies\r\nof Islam. They act against all that Islam teaches,\r\nnamely, peace, tolerance, compassion, social justice\r\nand the good of humanity.\r\nTerrorists aim to harm the nation of Afghanistan,\r\na deeply believing Muslim nation that is averse to\r\nextremism. They pose a threat to the process of\r\nreconstruction in Afghanistan. Terrorists see their\r\nlasting defeat in the success of reconstruction. They are\r\ntherefore maliciously intent on derailing the process of\r\nreconstruction in Afghanistan. That must stop. We\r\nmust defeat the forces and ideas of violence in the\r\nregion. Today terrorism is a liability to the\r\nGovernments in the region. Governments must stop\r\nusing extremism as an instrument of policy. As long as\r\nterrorism survives in this part of the world, neither\r\nAfghanistan nor our neighbours, nor indeed the rest of\r\nthe world, can be safe.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of Afghanistan for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Hâmid Karzai, President of Afghanistan, was\r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Vladimir Voronin, President of the\r\nRepublic of Moldova\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of\r\nthe Republic of Moldova.\r\nMr. Vladimir Voronin, President of the Republic of\r\nMoldova, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency\r\nMr. Vladimir Voronin, President of the Report of\r\nMoldova, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Voronin (spoke in Romanian; English\r\ntext provided by the delegation): Allow me at the outset\r\nto congratulate the Honourable Julian Hunte on the\r\noccasion of his election to the important position of\r\nPresident, at the fifty-eighth session, of the General\r\nAssembly — the most representative and prestigious\r\norganization in the world. I am convinced that his\r\nelection is recognition of both the achievements of the\r\ncountry he represents and his personal merits.\r\nAllow me also to express my gratitude to Mr. Jan\r\nKavan for the responsibility he showed in carrying out\r\nhis duties as President at the previous session.\r\nI also must point out the remarkable role played\r\nby the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in\r\nenhancing the authority and efficiency of the United\r\nNations, particularly in the context of the dramatic\r\nevents that the international community faced during\r\nthe past few years. For the entire world, the United\r\nNations was and continues to be an organization\r\nserving the noble ideals of peace, equality and\r\neconomic prosperity of the peoples on our planet.\r\nThe international community has undertaken\r\nenormous efforts to ensure that phenomena alien to the\r\nspirit and aspirations of the contemporary world such\r\nas poverty, oppression, terrorism and the dangers of\r\necological disaster are perceived as reasons for general\r\nconcern that have in turn led to mobilization of all\r\nnations’ forces. We are aware of how the international\r\ncommunity has gone beyond adopting emotive\r\nhumanitarian declarations to establish institutions and\r\norganizations that are not only actively analysing\r\nvarious problems, but are also working to correct\r\neconomic, social and political developments, wherever\r\nthey occur.\r\nGlobal threats are being given a global rebuff,\r\nand the chaos of destruction is ever more strongly\r\nopposed by integrated ethics and new technology for\r\nstructuring international relations based on\r\nsupranational values of human civilization, the\r\nuniversality of the principles of democracy, civil\r\nfreedoms and life itself.\r\nThe epochal Millennium Summit and the summits\r\nheld at Rome, Monterrey, Doha and Johannesburg\r\nmarked the foreshadowing of a new system of global\r\npriorities aimed at preventing and neutralizing possible\r\nthreats. Clearly, that system is leaving less and less\r\nroom for resolving the individual problems of\r\nsovereign States and is increasingly opening the way\r\nfor making use of international mechanisms to that end.\r\nThat system, which has been increasingly gaining in\r\nmodern politics, is now determining the new context of\r\nthe relationship between States and international\r\ninstitutions, excluding the dependent attitude of trivial\r\nprofiting assumed by national elites towards\r\ninternational assistance and requiring a responsible and\r\ndecisive approach to the issue of reforming our own\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\neconomies and establishing modern social and political\r\nstandards.\r\nUndoubtedly, we are currently entering a century\r\nof integration, an era in which traditional inter-State\r\nbarriers are coming down. Yet, it is an era in which the\r\nlocal interests of some countries may in fact lead to\r\nbenefits for the entire community. Therefore, it is\r\nextremely important to be aware that the current stage\r\nof globalization will not disappoint us, only if, on the\r\nway to integration — the integration of values and\r\nstandards — the initiative for taking the first step\r\nbelongs to the States themselves. That is a task that in\r\nprinciple is new for all us — heads of State and\r\npoliticians.\r\nIt is not gratuitous that I began my speech with\r\nthese considerations. I did so at the outset because only\r\nsuch an approach can provide for the success of the\r\nState I represent to significant extent.\r\nMoldova embarked on the path of independent\r\ndevelopment 12 years ago. The chronic Transnistrian\r\nproblem, de-industrialization and economic recession,\r\npoverty, nationalism and separatism served for a\r\ndecade as the calling card of our country.\r\nThe “first step” policy is being implemented in\r\nMoldova in two areas of the utmost importance. First,\r\nthere is the problem of the Transnistrian settlement. We\r\nare aware of the fundamental character of the motives\r\nthat are at the core of this 10-year-old conflict. As the\r\nprimary way to resolve these contradictions, we have\r\nproposed that a new State constitution be drafted and\r\nadopted through joint efforts. In the draft that currently\r\nis being elaborated, we are insisting on giving up the\r\nstatus of unitary State, which does not take into\r\naccount the profound specific characteristics of the\r\nTransnistrian region. We are laying as the basis of the\r\nnew State draft the principles of the federative\r\norganization of our country, which take into\r\nconsideration the long-term interests of all the regions\r\nof Moldova.\r\nIn eliminating the effects of the nationalistic\r\nhysteria characteristic of the early 1990s, which\r\ndivided both the society and the country, Moldova has\r\ndeclared itself determined to build a harmonious multi-\r\nethnic society, based on principles of ethnic and\r\nlinguistic liberalism and pluralism. I believe that it is\r\nprecisely this policy that corresponds to those\r\nintegrationist trends that are replacing isolationism and\r\nsecessionism.\r\nUnity in diversity — that is the principle of our\r\npolicy today, and that is the motto of the Moldovan\r\nchairmanship in the Council of Europe. We are firmly\r\nconvinced that only those transformations will be able\r\nto serve as the proper basis for resolving both the\r\ndomestic problems of the Moldovan State and the\r\nproblems concerning regional security.\r\nIn the second place, the Republic of Moldova has\r\nproclaimed the path of European integration a priority\r\nnational strategy of the State. We are well aware of\r\nhow difficult that path is, and of the responsibility it\r\nrequires, but at the same time we firmly state that it\r\nrepresents first and foremost an internal political and\r\neconomic option for Moldova. We know that this\r\noption requires effective and comprehensive\r\nconsolidation of the market economy institutions,\r\nfurther advancement of democratic reforms and the\r\ndevelopment of civil society and the social sphere. Yet\r\nhowever difficult the task before us may be, we hope\r\nthat in time our decision will lead to the establishment\r\nof a national consensus.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nPeace and security on our planet may constitute\r\nthe guarantee that all States will adopt a joint position\r\nregarding the acknowledgement of modern social,\r\neconomic, political and legal standards. It is clear that\r\nthere is no other way. Humankind is currently more\r\nvulnerable than ever to crises and disasters of every\r\nscope and degree. That is why civilization today does\r\nnot have, and should not have, any local problems; nor\r\ndoes it, or should it, have any dark corners where, as in\r\na hothouse, terrorism, repression and defiant disdain\r\nfor the opinion of the international community can\r\nflourish.\r\nIn developing such a position, the most important\r\nrole lies with the Security Council. In that context, I\r\nexpress my support for the idea of making the Security\r\nCouncil more representative. The Republic of Moldova\r\nstands for a reasonable increase in the number of\r\npermanent and non-permanent members in the Security\r\nCouncil, which would further ensure the principle of\r\nequal geographic representation and would reflect the\r\ninterests of all regional groups. Fully aware of the\r\ndifficulty of reaching consensus on that issue, I call\r\nupon all Members of the United Nations to make every\r\neffort to adopt a definitive decision to that end.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova also supports the idea\r\nof restoring the role of the General Assembly as the\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nmost important, representative and deliberative body of\r\nthe United Nations. Along the same lines, I think there\r\nis a need to consolidate further the capacity of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council as the coordinator of\r\nUnited Nations funds and programmes. I am sure that\r\nthe further development of United Nations institutions\r\nand structures will be the best proof of the viability of\r\nthe principles of the Organization, its growing prestige\r\nand its leading role in the world. I express the hope that\r\nthe United Nations will know how to place itself at the\r\nvanguard of current positive developments.\r\nI am firmly convinced that the proceedings of the\r\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly will take\r\nplace in a spirit of sincere cooperation and solidarity,\r\nso that the representatives of all States will make\r\nsustained efforts to achieve the noble goals of peace,\r\nstability and prosperity.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Moldova for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Vladimir Voronin, President of the Republic\r\nof Moldova, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Francisco Guillermo Flores Pérez,\r\nPresident of the Republic of El Salvador\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of El\r\nSalvador.\r\nMr. Francisco Guillermo Flores Pérez, President\r\nof the Republic of El Salvador, was escorted into\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome His\r\nExcellency Mr. Francisco Guillermo Flores Pérez,\r\nPresident of the Republic of El Salvador, and to invite\r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nPresident Flores Pérez (spoke in Spanish):\r\nBefore addressing the pressing issues before the\r\ninternational community and expressing our position\r\non the issues that have been discussed here, I would\r\nlike to begin by referring to the concrete example of\r\nmy own country.\r\nOn 6 January 2003, the people and Government\r\nof El Salvador received an official communication\r\nfrom the Secretary-General informing us of the\r\ncompletion of the verification function of the United\r\nNations vis-à-vis the Peace Agreement that ended 13\r\nyears of war in our country. Eleven years have elapsed\r\nsince that historic Peace Agreement put an end to an\r\narmed conflict that had been destroying our country for\r\nover a decade.\r\nBefore the war we were a poor country. Sixty-per\r\ncent of our fellow citizens lived under the poverty line.\r\nOur country has also been dealt a harsh blow by nature.\r\nEvery generation of Salvadorans has had to rebuild\r\ntheir lives due to the fact that, throughout our history,\r\nthere has never been a twenty-five-year period without\r\nthe occurrence of a natural disaster of enormous\r\nproportions. We are also an overpopulated country,\r\nwith over 6 million inhabitants sharing 21,000 square\r\nkilometres. That makes us one of the most densely\r\npopulated countries of the American continent. Being\r\ncompletely dependant on agriculture, fluctuations in\r\nthe prices of coffee and sugar have always determined\r\nour prospects for development.\r\nA little over a decade ago we stood no chance of\r\nmeeting our financial commitments. Our debts far\r\nexceeded our ability to pay. Poor, small, overpopulated,\r\nindebted, dependent upon agriculture, afflicted by\r\nnatural disasters and immersed in a widespread armed\r\nconflict, El Salvador appeared not to have a future\r\nbarely 12 years ago. Violence, coupled with the harsh\r\nrealities of underdevelopment, appeared to have\r\ndoomed us to a vicious circle devoid of hope.\r\nWe are a different country today. We view the\r\nfuture with confidence, for we have discovered our\r\ncapacities. In just 12 years we have reduced poverty by\r\nhalf, from 60 per cent of our population, in 1991, to 33\r\nper cent today. Over 30 per cent of our population had\r\nbeen living in extreme poverty. Today only half as\r\nmany, 15 per cent, live in that distressing situation. Our\r\nefforts have had a direct impact on the standard of\r\nliving of all of our citizens. Twelve years ago 25 per\r\ncent of Salvadorans did not know how to read or write.\r\nThat figure is only 13 per cent today. The child\r\nmortality rate, which had been at 45 per thousand\r\nbirths, stands at 25 per thousand today.\r\nWe have accomplished all that by dedicating\r\nourselves to the most pressing needs of our people. In\r\norder to connect our most isolated towns, we have built\r\none kilometre of road every day for the last four years.\r\nWe have also built three schools every day in the same\r\nperiod, so as to educate our poorest children. Similarly,\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nwe have built 106 houses every day for low-income\r\nfamilies. And every five days we have built a new\r\nhealth centre.\r\nHaving once been completely dependent on\r\nagriculture, today we rank number 3, out of 24 Latin\r\nAmerican countries, in terms of export growth. During\r\nthe difficult decade of the 1990s we managed to grow\r\nat a much faster rate than our region at large. We have\r\nnow become the second-ranking country in Latin\r\nAmerica in economic growth.\r\nDespite the immense burden posed by\r\nreconstruction after the earthquakes of 2001, year after\r\nyear we have reduced our budget deficit, bringing it to\r\nunder 1 per cent in 2004. This has allowed us to control\r\ninflation, lowering it from 30 per cent to 2 per cent this\r\nyear, and thus to avoid a decline in family income. We\r\nhave zero risk of devaluation and today, after having\r\nseen interest rates of 30 per cent, we have the lowest\r\nbank interest rates of our region — 6.8 per cent. For 11\r\nyears now, we have had no fluctuation in exchange\r\nrates, allowing us to acquire a rate of investment that is\r\nmatched in Latin America only by Chile, Mexico and\r\nmy country.\r\nThe living conditions of Salvadorans have\r\nchanged considerably. Rates of unemployment have\r\nfallen from 13 per cent to 6.8 per cent. Having had\r\nonly 250,000 telephone lines in 1992, we now have 1.6\r\nmillion. It is less expensive to make a telephone call\r\nfrom El Salvador to United Nations Headquarters than\r\nit is from Headquarters to El Salvador. In just over a\r\ndecade, the number of automobiles has grown by a\r\nfactor of four. We have managed to increase the supply\r\nof drinking water and electrification in rural areas by\r\n50 per cent. We have achieved peace. We have devoted\r\nour energies to economic development and our\r\nresources to the poorest among us.\r\nI have elaborated on developments in my country\r\nin recent years because it seems to me that we in El\r\nSalvador have discovered an effective way not only of\r\nresolving violent conflict, but also of combating\r\npoverty. Such means, which the international\r\ncommunity is seeking to confront the complexities of\r\nour world, are based on universally valid principles.\r\nThus, to understand the case of El Salvador is to\r\nunderstand new possibilities for other nations and\r\nsolutions to other problems.\r\nThe two most important challenges for a nation\r\nare learning how to live and understanding why we are\r\nalive. The former is an entirely practical matter,\r\nrequiring knowledge of the workings of the modern\r\nworld — how it works and what opportunities are\r\navailable to a poor country in a world that is rapidly\r\nevolving. The second is an entirely abstract matter, but\r\nit is all the more important for that, because only when\r\nwe are clear about the meaning of our shared lives can\r\nwe develop a sense of purpose that allows us to\r\nchannel the energies of a community towards a national\r\nobjective.\r\nIt is a paradox rich in significance that we\r\nSalvadorans, in order to find our commitment to the\r\nfuture, had to delve into the traditions that gave us our\r\nidentity in the past. When we found ourselves in the\r\ndead end of war, we had to rethink our destiny. In spite\r\nof our suffering, we had all the resources we needed to\r\nmove ahead: talent, energy, experience, faith and will.\r\nWe had the prudence to avoid future dangers and the\r\ncourage to confront present challenges.\r\nThe basic principle on which we have built our\r\ncountry is that every Salvadoran has access to the truth.\r\nIn every part of our land, it is possible for every\r\nSalvadoran to speak out, to express himself or herself\r\nwithout any constraint based on status. It is on the basis\r\nof the views of our compatriots that we have built the\r\nnew El Salvador. We decided that, if this were to\r\nbecome a reality, three principles were needed:\r\nfreedom, justice and the inalienable right to life. The\r\nconcrete manifestations of these values are democracy,\r\neconomic freedom and the rule of law. This applies not\r\nonly to El Salvador and Salvadorans, but equally to all\r\nthe inhabitants of our world. Every human being has\r\naccess to the truth. It is in the human capacity for\r\nreason that we find our moral potential. That is why we\r\nmust be free.\r\nAt a time when we wonder about the role of the\r\nUnited Nations, we must recall that the Organization\r\nwas born to ensure those fundamental rights. This\r\nforum cannot be paralysed in debates when freeing a\r\nnation from tyranny is at issue. We must all act in the\r\nface of oppression. Terrorism is a negation of all the\r\nvalues we share. We need a consensus on the values\r\nthat unite us and a renewed will for action.\r\nWe can debate interminably here the issue of Iraq\r\nand the current circumstances of the Iraqi people, but\r\nwhat brooks no debate is the fact that this forum has\r\nnot acted in a way commensurate with the demands of\r\nan increasingly complex world. The United Nations\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nmust be rethought and restructured so that it can meet\r\nthe objectives for which it was created.\r\nWe Salvadorans speak with the solidity that we\r\nhave gained from having fully shouldered our\r\nresponsibilities towards the international community.\r\nWe are participants in the reconstruction of Iraq. We\r\nspeak with the legitimacy of having been ourselves the\r\nbattleground of the last conflict of the cold war and we\r\nunderstand how the mediation of the international\r\ncommunity can help to find a solution to a conflict and\r\ngive hope to a desperate nation.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish to express our sorrow at\r\nthe death of United Nations staff members in Baghdad.\r\nWe reaffirm the right of all nations to have a voice in\r\nthis forum. The absence of the Republic of China in the\r\ndeliberations of this forum represents a rejection of the\r\nlegitimate aspirations of a nation that should speak in\r\nits own voice, just as we do, in this body and the\r\ncommunity of nations.\r\nThe liberator of the Americas summarized, in\r\nwords far more eloquent than mine, the values that\r\nmust inspire this forum and our discussions here. He\r\nsaid:\r\n“Peoples, no one can take possession of\r\nyour sovereignty, unless it be violently and\r\nillegitimately. Flee that country where one person\r\nalone seeks to exercise all powers. That will be a\r\ncountry of slaves.”\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof El Salvador for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Francisco Guillermo Flores Pérez, President\r\nof the Republic of El Salvador, was escorted from\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alfonso Portillo Cabrera, President\r\nof the Republic of Guatemala\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Guatemala.\r\nMr. Alfonso Portillo Cabrera, President of the\r\nRepublic of Guatemala, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Alfonso Portillo Cabrera,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Guatemala, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Portillo Cabrera (spoke in Spanish): I\r\ncome before this parliament of humankind to present\r\nmy final report as a Head of State who believes in\r\ninterdependence and for whom sovereignty is not a\r\nclosed door separating nations, but rather an open\r\nwindow affording a glimpse into the identity of each\r\none, furthering the respectful interchange of\r\nexperiences and the quest for understanding and\r\nsolidarity among peoples.\r\nMy presence here reflects Guatemala’s\r\ncommitment to the United Nations, whose presence in\r\nmy country has been crucial to the implementation of\r\nthe Peace Agreements concluded in 1996. It also gives\r\nme the opportunity to participate in the debate\r\nconcerning the main subjects that make up the\r\ninternational agenda, while at the same time allowing\r\nme once again to express our solidarity with the\r\ninhabitants of the great city of New York over the\r\ntragic events of two years ago.\r\nI wish to reiterate our energetic repudiation of the\r\ntreacherous attack against United Nations headquarters\r\nin Baghdad that took place just a few weeks ago. We\r\nespecially regret the loss of valuable officials of the\r\nOrganization, including the esteemed Sergio Vieira de\r\nMello.\r\nI also wish to express our gratitude to Mr. Jan\r\nKavan, of the Czech Republic, for his enlightened\r\nleadership of the previous session. At the same time, I\r\nwould like very sincerely to congratulate Mr. Julian\r\nHunte on having assumed the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session. We are pleased to see\r\na distinguished representative of our own region\r\noccupy such an important post. We have no doubt that,\r\nwith his proven abilities and his well-known\r\nexperience, he will be quite successful in conducting\r\nour deliberations.\r\nGuatemala, just like its brotherly countries in\r\nLatin America, has experienced a dramatic period at\r\nthe close of the twentieth century. That time has been\r\ncharacterized by a complex agenda involving various\r\nchallenges, including those of entering into the\r\nglobalization process, building peace with justice and\r\nconsolidating democracy in a way that includes good\r\ngovernance.\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nIn that regard, during the last four years we have\r\nsought to make progress in opening up Guatemala to\r\nthe world and in making it part of globalization’s\r\ntechnological, financial and cultural currents. We\r\npromoted the democratization of institutions,\r\nmechanisms, practices and values capable of\r\ncommingling freedom with authority and effectiveness\r\nwith equality. We have also nurtured the concept of\r\npeace based on justice and respect for human rights.\r\nGuatemala is a country where several historical\r\ntasks remain to be completed or have been permanently\r\npostponed. When I assumed the presidency, in January\r\n2000, I resolved to thoroughly address some of those\r\npending issues. We have freed our country from its\r\ncaptivity by powerful economic interests. There are no\r\nlonger tax exemptions that favour individuals. Trade\r\npolicy is no longer manipulated to the detriment of the\r\nproduction of small farmers. Economic policy is now\r\nseen as an instrument of social development. After a\r\ncentury of captive markets, local monopolies are now\r\nexposed to competition.\r\nThe Peace Agreements bestowed on Guatemala a\r\nprogramme for democratization. With an eye towards\r\nthe twenty-first century, the Agreements constitute a\r\nproposal for a wide-ranging reinvigoration of\r\ncoexistence between Guatemalans. But the Agreements\r\nhave also presented us with the challenge of\r\nsimultaneously completing various tasks pertaining to\r\ndifferent historical processes that other societies have\r\ncarried out in stages.\r\nI am pleased to say that we have made progress in\r\nvarious substantive areas. However, I must also admit\r\nthat we have fallen short, or inadequately addressed,\r\nother areas.\r\nAgainst the opposition of powerful interests, we\r\nmade a determined effort to increase the tax rate. We\r\nachieved a historical level in the collection of taxes,\r\nbut without attaining the goal that had been set.\r\nWe carried out the most significant financial\r\nreform since 1945 in order to modernize the banking\r\nsystem, reduce the risks of speculation and restore to\r\nthe system its true mediation function.\r\nWe modernized the labour law, which since 1944\r\nhad suffered a series of setbacks. We consistently\r\nraised the minimum wage in real terms at an\r\nunprecedented pace. On average, workers in the\r\ncountryside now earn 50 per cent more than they did\r\nfour years ago.\r\nOur illiteracy rate has historically been shameful.\r\nWe therefore adopted plans that made it possible to\r\nreduce that rate by almost half. Special attention has\r\nbeen devoted to young girls. Through scholarships and\r\nschool feeding programmes, we have removed tens of\r\nthousands of children from child labour. We have also\r\nreformed curricula to include the philosophy of the\r\nPeace Agreements. And we have considerably\r\nincreased school enrolment.\r\nWith regard to basic health care, we have\r\nconfronted structural weaknesses in the critical areas of\r\nchild and maternal mortality rates and nutrition.\r\nHowever, much more remains to be done. We are\r\nin an unfavourable economic environment. The\r\ntraditional engines of growth and employment have\r\nweakened, and the necessary changes in production are\r\ntaking place slowly. We have therefore undertaken a\r\nmassive effort to stabilize the economy and have\r\nimplemented emergency measures, such as providing\r\nsmall farmers with agricultural supplies so that they\r\ncan sustain their productive capacity.\r\nThe issue of transforming the production process\r\nis so sensitive that it was a contributing factor in the\r\ncivil war that raged for almost 40 years during the last\r\ncentury. Recognizing the urgency of the issue, I\r\nintroduced reconciliation mechanisms in which all\r\nsectors participate in an effort to define the country’s\r\nstrategic policies, including in the areas of economic\r\nand rural development.\r\nOur people have made significant advances in the\r\narea of participation in the past three years. We have\r\ncarried out the country’s most significant reform by\r\ndecentralizing our institutions, strengthening local\r\ndevelopment councils and granting greater powers and\r\nfunctions to municipal governments. Indigenous\r\npeoples are now recognized as such and are able to\r\nparticipate in defining a new institutional landscape\r\ngrounded in their own cultures. Women also have an\r\nincreased public role and are developing innovative\r\nways of organizing.\r\nAll those efforts are aimed at reweaving our\r\nsocial fabric, which had been torn apart by the war.\r\nReconciliation is an essential task in that regard, and\r\nthe Government must foster a favourable climate for it\r\nto take place. That is why I assumed international\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\ncommitments to counter violations of human rights.\r\nThat is also why we have begun a national\r\ncompensation programme that includes reparations for\r\nthe families of the more than 200,000 victims of the\r\nwar, most of whom were indigenous persons. We also\r\ntrust that the High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nwill establish an Office in Guatemala.\r\nNevertheless, impunity continues to be a difficult\r\nissue to overcome. Judicial bodies continue to be weak,\r\nwhich is what led me to put forward an unprecedented\r\ntemporary measure to strengthen local institutional\r\ncapacity. I asked for the support of the United Nations\r\nin immediately establishing a commission to\r\ninvestigate illegal groups and clandestine security\r\nmechanisms, as several repressive groups of the past\r\nthat are now in league with organized crime are\r\nthreatening and intimidating human rights activists,\r\njudges and journalists.\r\nCivilian authority must be strengthened if we are\r\nto restore all aspects of democracy. Our efforts in that\r\nregard have been clear. We have established a civilian\r\nnational intelligence agency, as well as a civilian body\r\nresponsible for presidential security. We now have a\r\ndefence policy in keeping with the principles of\r\ndemocratic security that was the product of an open\r\ndebate among the members of our society. We have\r\ndesigned laws to provide for free access to information,\r\nthe declassification of secret State archives and the\r\nestablishment of civilian controls over security\r\nfunctions, which includes an advisory council on\r\nsecurity. Those efforts are well under way and should\r\nbe fully implemented during the next few years.\r\nPromoting a culture of peace has not been easy.\r\nThe trauma of war continues to hamper trust in our\r\nsociety. Political polarization also exists, as a result of\r\npowerful economic and military groups defending their\r\nprivileges. However, human life is less endangered and\r\nthe democratization process continues to move\r\nforward.\r\nI will fulfil two other basic commitments in the\r\nremaining 114 days of my presidency. One of them will\r\nbe to ensure that Guatemalans are able to take part in a\r\nfree and transparent electoral process that is closely\r\nmonitored by the international community and in\r\nwhich all political forces participate without exception.\r\nSuch an event will be taking place for only the second\r\ntime in our history during the past century.\r\nThe second commitment involves carrying out an\r\norderly transition of power that safeguards the reforms\r\nbegun in the context of the Peace Agreements. To that\r\nend, I have worked with my Government team to come\r\nup with a basic transition agenda that includes\r\nproviding for continuity in programmes and policies\r\nand the strengthening of institutions involved in the\r\npeace process.\r\nI would now like to turn briefly to some of the\r\nissues we will be dealing with during this session. In\r\nparticular, I would like to respond to the challenge that\r\nthe Secretary-General put before us this morning,\r\nnamely, how to rethink the United Nations in these\r\ntimes of fundamental changes.\r\nAs I have already said, we fully support the\r\nUnited Nations as the highest proponent of\r\nmultilateralism. We also firmly support the stewardship\r\nof Secretary-General Kofi Annan. We concur with his\r\nview that it is imperative that we adapt the\r\nOrganization to the exigencies of globalization. We\r\nwill also support efforts aimed at improving the\r\nmanagerial capacities of the Secretariat and at\r\npromoting the reform of intergovernmental bodies.\r\nWe therefore believe that we should not delay our\r\nefforts to make the Security Council more\r\nrepresentative, and its procedures more transparent.\r\nMoreover, we think that it is necessary to strengthen\r\nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil in order that the three principal organs of our\r\nOrganization mutually support one another.\r\nWe reiterate our opposition to all forms of\r\nterrorism and we support the collective efforts of the\r\ninternational community to combat that scourge.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations should\r\ncontinue to give priority to the essential issue of\r\ndevelopment. Along with multilateral financial\r\norganizations, our Organization should dedicate itself\r\nto the task of ensuring that the benefits of globalization\r\nare widely shared among all the inhabitants of the\r\nworld. We also stress the singular importance of the\r\nMonterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nAction.\r\nWe express our disappointment at the lack of\r\nprogress made at the recent meeting of trade ministers\r\nheld in Cancún. As part of the G-21, we commit\r\nourselves to working constructively to bring together\r\nthe positions of all parties to produce a more open and\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\ntransparent international trade regime that provides\r\nmore opportunities for developing countries.\r\nWe also underscore the need to give greater\r\nimportance in the international agenda to the situation\r\nof immigrants and migrant workers while focusing on\r\nundocumented immigrants, who constitute a vulnerable\r\ngroup vis-à-vis the need to protect human rights.\r\nI would especially like to refer to the subject of\r\nchildren and to the obligation of States to guarantee\r\ntheir rights and protection. A case in point is the effort\r\nthat is taking place in the context of the Convention on\r\nthe Rights of the Child to re-establish links between\r\nthree Guatemalan children and their mother, Gabriela\r\nArias.\r\nWe support all efforts to put an end to the tragic\r\nspiral of violence afflicting the Middle East and to\r\nachieve a just and lasting peace in that long-suffering\r\nregion.\r\nWe associate ourselves with efforts aimed at\r\nrestoring peace, security and the rule of law in Iraq, as\r\nwell as to reinstate that country’s sovereignty. We share\r\nthe view that the United Nations should play a\r\nsignificant role in that undertaking.\r\nWe support the heartfelt aspiration of the 23\r\nmillion citizens of the Republic of China on Taiwan to\r\nbe represented in international organizations such as\r\nthe United Nations. Guatemala, like all of Central\r\nAmerica, believes those aspirations to be a positive\r\nforce for peace and democracy in the world.\r\nWe are making our best effort to strengthen the\r\nbonds of friendship and neighbourliness with Belize,\r\nwithout prejudice to the search for ways to peacefully,\r\nhonourably, equitably and permanently resolve our\r\nterritorial dispute. We express our complete willingness\r\nto continue to seek a negotiated solution to that dispute\r\nwithin the framework of the Organization of American\r\nStates.\r\nWe reiterate our devotion to, and support for,\r\nCentral American integration, as well as our solidarity\r\nwith, and commitment to, all of Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean.\r\nWe live in exceptional times that affect each and\r\nevery one of our countries, as well as the United\r\nNations as a whole. Such critical moments create\r\nopportunities for re-evaluation and change. I hope that\r\nGod will grant us the wisdom to take advantage of\r\nthose opportunities, thereby making it possible for us\r\nto overcome the obstacles that have served to distract\r\nhumankind from a future of solidarity and common\r\nwelfare.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Guatemala for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alfonso Portillo Cabrera, President of the\r\nRepublic of Guatemala, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Ms. Megawati Soekarnoputri, President\r\nof the Republic of Indonesia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Indonesia.\r\nMs. Megawati Soekarnoputri, President of the\r\nRepublic of Indonesia, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations Her Excellency Ms. Megawati Soekarnoputri,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Indonesia, and to invite\r\nher to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Soekarnoputri: Allow me to begin by\r\ndrawing the General Assembly’s attention to the fact\r\nthat, despite all its deficiencies and weaknesses, it must\r\nbe admitted that the United Nations has demonstrated\r\nits merits and contributions, not only for humanity in\r\ngeneral but also, in particular, for its Member States.\r\nThis world body has maintained minimum standards\r\nthat every State must meet regarding the protection and\r\npromotion of the human rights of all its citizens. The\r\nUnited Nations has developed, and strived to\r\nimplement, international laws binding upon each and\r\nevery member. It has also instituted and put into\r\npractice an array of legal instruments that are very\r\nuseful in preventing and settling conflicts among\r\nStates, as well as in promoting a framework of\r\ncooperation among nations.\r\nI would therefore like to take this opportunity to\r\nconvey the gratitude and appreciation of my country to\r\nthe United Nations for the invaluable work it has done\r\nfor our benefit. The contributions of the Organization\r\nto our political and economic development are well\r\nrecorded in our history. Those contributions range from\r\nits mediating role during the period of our struggle to\r\npreserve our national independence, from 1945 to\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\n1949, to its active participation in our efforts to employ\r\nour independence wisely in our pursuit of national\r\ndevelopment.\r\nOur national State — which may not only be the\r\nmost heterogeneous but also the largest archipelagic\r\nState in the world — is built upon racial, ethnic,\r\nreligious and cultural pluralities. Our people still live\r\npredominately traditional lives, dispersed along the\r\nequator throughout over 17,000 islands. The most\r\ndevastating financial crisis in Indonesia’s history not\r\nonly ignited conflicts between ethnic groups, but also\r\nrevived separatist movements in several regions. We\r\nare doing all we can to contain and defuse those\r\nseparatist movements. In the process, we have\r\ndiminished our capacity to strengthen our economic\r\nrecovery.\r\nBeginning in 2002, while we were contending\r\nwith those difficulties, terrorism began to inflict its\r\nbrutality upon our homeland. We believed for quite\r\nsome time that international terrorism would spare\r\nIndonesia because we had a tradition of tolerance for\r\nhuman differences. However, we must now face the\r\nreality that Indonesia has become a target of terrorism,\r\nand as a result has suffered enormous losses in human\r\nlives. We have been wondering why those terrifying\r\nacts were carried out. What were the underlying\r\nreasons, motives and arguments for them? How were\r\nthey related to international terrorist networks? What\r\ncourse of action should be adopted to effectively\r\nprevent, deter and eradicate them?\r\nWe have adopted a strong set of laws to prevent\r\nand eradicate the threats posed by terrorism. Equipped\r\nwith those reinforced legal instruments, we have\r\ndismantled terrorist cells in the country, and\r\nprosecutors have brought members of those cells to\r\njustice. Several of them have already been handed\r\nsentences that befit their crimes.\r\nThe people of Indonesia, who are predominantly\r\nof the Islamic faith, support that national policy. Large\r\nand active Islamic organizations, such as\r\nMuhammadiya and Nahdlatul Ulama, as well as the\r\nIndonesian Ulemas Council and prominent Islamic\r\nfigures, are one in condemning those terrorist acts. It\r\nshould be noted that the terrorists — who are few in\r\nnumber, but fanatical — often claim that they are\r\nfighting in the name of Islam. They must be a mere\r\nminority, as Islam — which teaches equality, justice\r\nand the kinship shared by all humankind — cannot\r\npossibly endorse the indiscriminate killing of innocent\r\nindividuals. As in other Muslim countries, adherents of\r\nmainstream Islam in Indonesia practice moderation and\r\nare strongly opposed to violence. Although they are a\r\nsmall splinter group in the large Indonesian community\r\nof Muslims, the perpetrators of those terrorist acts\r\nrepresent a branch of international terrorism. The\r\nmotives and justifying arguments of their movement\r\napparently stem from the prolonged unjust attitude\r\nexhibited by big Powers towards countries whose\r\ninhabitants profess Islam, particularly as regards\r\nresolving the Middle East conflict.\r\nWe should truly be prudent and sensible in the\r\nface of such a long-outstanding issue. It is difficult to\r\nrefute the impression that the policy on conflict\r\nresolution in the Middle East is not only unjust but also\r\none-sided. Clearly, the Middle East problem is not a\r\nconflict of religions or of religious adherents, although\r\nsome religious nuances may be part of the issue.\r\nWe are very much aware of the background of\r\nthat situation. Whatever the reasoning espoused by any\r\none of us, we must all admit that the absence of a just\r\nattitude, exacerbated by a feeling of being sidelined\r\nand ignored, in addition to the lack of a formal means\r\nto channel aspirations, has fostered a climate for\r\nviolence and made it grow. In our view, those are\r\nactually both the seeds and roots of a problem that has\r\na tendency to grow and expand. Among other things,\r\nthat problem has also even led to devastating and tragic\r\nacts of terror.\r\nAt this distinguished forum, I would like to\r\nappeal to world leaders to open the doors of their hearts\r\nin dealing with that issue, which is crucial to world\r\npeace, the welfare of humankind and the destiny of the\r\nhuman race. I believe we will be able to carry out that\r\nnoble task if we are prepared to look into the problem\r\nwith clear hearts and minds. Indeed, we cannot be the\r\n“most just”; but it is necessary to have a just mind and\r\nattitude.\r\nIt is depressing to observe that we have been very\r\nslow in understanding the root causes of the problem.\r\nThe war in the Middle East a few months ago is just\r\nanother reflection of the situation. The war has created\r\nmany more problems than it was supposed to solve. I\r\ndo believe that a great many lessons can be learned\r\nfrom the Iraq war.\r\nIn order to prevent, deter or eradicate the problem\r\nof international terrorism, I should like to propose that\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nthe countries whose citizens have been the main targets\r\nof terrorist groups should review their conventional\r\nanti-terrorism policies, particularly in dealing with the\r\nArab-Israeli conflict. They should adopt a policy that\r\nensures that all parties involved are given just and\r\nequal treatment. Indeed, many eminent Muslims in\r\nIndonesia believe that once the major Powers behave in\r\na more just manner and make clear their impartiality in\r\nthe Middle East, most of the root causes of terrorism\r\nperpetrated in the name of Islam — which cannot be\r\njustified under any circumstance — will be resolved.\r\nAs the Head of State of the largest Muslim country in\r\nthe world, I sincerely invite all world leaders to pay\r\nparticular attention to that issue.\r\nLet us prevent the root causes of terrorism from\r\nspreading and triggering the emergence of other\r\nunsatisfactory aspirations, including in the social and\r\neconomic spheres. The failure to reach consensus at the\r\nrecent meeting of the World Trade Organization and\r\nthe continued slow progress — not to say stalemate —\r\nin the implementation of various social and economic\r\nglobal agendas will only complicate and proliferate\r\nexisting global problems.\r\nWe are all interested in making the world a more\r\npeaceful, stable, prosperous, just and humane place.\r\nWere those not the noble objectives explicitly\r\nstipulated in the Charter of the United Nations at the\r\ninception of the Organization, in June 1945? We are all\r\naware that the world has undergone rapid changes.\r\nTechnology has transformed the world and turned it\r\ninto an open and almost borderless place. Human life\r\nand its inherent value system have been developing\r\nvery fast, and any institutional and procedural regimes\r\nand instruments require adjustment and improvement.\r\nForty-three years ago, in 1960, our first President,\r\nMr. Soekarno, spoke clearly about that issue. In his\r\naddress to the General Assembly entitled “To build the\r\nworld anew”, he referred to the need to reform both the\r\ninternational order and relations among nations of the\r\nworld. We now all realize and recognize the truth of his\r\ncall. We are indeed in need of fundamental reform. If,\r\nto that end, the performance of the Organization\r\nrequires improvement to enable it to contribute more\r\nconstructively to the attainment of a more peaceful,\r\nstable, just, prosperous and humane world, then we\r\nmust have the courage to review, revitalize and\r\nempower its institutions and working methods.\r\nWe must strengthen international cooperation and\r\nreinforce regional engagement. In South-East Asia, we\r\nare continuing to enhance the role of the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Next month, at\r\nthe ASEAN summit that Indonesia will host in Bali, we\r\nexpect to take concrete steps towards forming an\r\nASEAN security community that will support and\r\ncomplement our efforts at becoming an ASEAN\r\neconomic community. I believe that a stable, peaceful\r\nand prosperous ASEAN will significantly contribute to\r\nthe realization of the objectives of the United Nations.\r\nThere are no easy tasks. But building a better\r\nregion and a more democratic world is worth all our\r\npatience and hard work. After all, that is our basic\r\nresponsibility. From Indonesia’s own experience in\r\nstriving to become a more fully democratic country, I\r\nknow how difficult that kind of work can be. We are\r\ntherefore aware that building a more democratic world\r\nis even more difficult. Nevertheless, I wish to reiterate\r\nthat my country remains committed to fulfilling its\r\ninternational obligations and that we will continue to\r\nwork with other members of the United Nations to\r\nbuild the new world we dream of.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Indonesia for the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Megawati Soekarnoputri, President of the\r\nRepublic of Indonesia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo, President of the\r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Federal Republic of\r\nNigeria.\r\nMr. Olusegun Obasanjo, President of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Nigeria, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo,\r\nPresident of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Obasanjo: On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of Nigeria, I would like to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as the President\r\nof the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nassure you of the cooperation and support of my\r\ndelegation in ensuring a successful outcome to this\r\nsession. Permit me also to acknowledge the excellent\r\nwork done by your predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan. I also\r\nwish to commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for his tireless efforts, vision and leadership,\r\nand for his inspiring address to the General Assembly\r\nthis morning.\r\nIn recent months, many voices inside and outside\r\nof Governments have questioned the utility, relevance\r\nand efficacy of the United Nations, the only universal\r\nmultilateral tool at our disposal. Even more tragically,\r\nsinister forces have taken aim at the United Nations\r\nand its dedicated staff, as demonstrated by the\r\nsenseless attack on the United Nations compound in\r\nBaghdad. My Government once again joins the\r\ninternational community in condemning that heartless\r\naction, which claimed the lives of so many talented and\r\ndedicated staff members. We share the sorrow of the\r\nSecretary-General and his staff, and extend our\r\nheartfelt condolences to the bereaved families. In that\r\nconnection, I wish to reaffirm my country’s total\r\ncommitment to, and support for, our Organization.\r\nMy Government is deeply concerned about the\r\npersistence of conflicts in many regions of the world,\r\nand in particular in our subregion of West Africa. The\r\nconflict in Liberia has again tested the will of the\r\ninternational community to respond proactively to\r\nconflicts and to the humanitarian catastrophes they\r\nleave in their wake. The decision of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) to\r\ndeploy troops to Liberia in the face of obvious\r\nhesitation by the international community and despite\r\nthe strain it placed our resources was therefore\r\nindicative of our determination to show that we will\r\nnot stand by wringing our hands when such\r\ncatastrophic events occur in our neighbourhood. We are\r\ngreatly relieved that our forward deployment of troops\r\nand the initiative to remove the former Liberian\r\nPresident from the scene have had such an immediate\r\ncalming effect, which will hopefully be further\r\nreinforced by the deployment of a United Nations\r\npeacekeeping force.\r\nI therefore wish to assure the General Assembly\r\nthat Nigeria appreciates the decision taken by the\r\nSecurity Council in resolution 1509 (2003), of 19\r\nSeptember 2003, to authorize a multisectoral\r\npeacekeeping mission in Liberia in order to continue\r\nthe achievement of the ECOWAS initiative. I should\r\nlike to emphasize the fact that if regional organizations\r\nare to play the lead role that the United Nations is\r\nincreasingly demanding, the international community\r\nwill not be able to escape its own responsibility to do\r\nmuch more to strengthen the requisite capacities of\r\nsuch organizations.\r\nLet me now turn to another subject that is closely\r\nrelated to the conflicts in Africa. The proliferation of\r\nsmall arms and light weapons has been identified as\r\none of the major factors fuelling conflicts. An effective\r\nstrategy to deal with that proliferation entails\r\ncontrolling the illicit trade in that category of weapons\r\nemanating from the countries where they originate, as\r\nwell as controlling their transfer to intermediaries and\r\narms merchants. We therefore call for an early\r\nconclusion of negotiations on a legally binding\r\ninternational instrument to control the indiscriminate\r\nsupply of small arms and light weapons, especially to\r\nnon-State actors. In keeping with our commitment to\r\nthe eradication of those weapons, ECOWAS has\r\nalready established and renewed a moratorium on the\r\nimportation of small arms and light weapons. To make\r\nthat moratorium as effective as intended, we call for\r\neffective cooperation on the part of all producing\r\ncountries.\r\nIn April 2003, the people of Nigeria reaffirmed\r\ntheir commitment to good governance and democracy\r\nby holding successful elections. Following our 1999\r\nelections, which marked the transition from military to\r\ncivilian Government, last April’s election represented\r\nboth our first civilian-to-civilian transition and a\r\nconsolidation of our democratic process. I consider my\r\nre-election to a second — and under our Constitution,\r\nmy last — term of office not only as a vote of\r\nconfidence but also as a great challenge to deliver the\r\ndividends of democracy to our citizens. To meet that\r\nchallenge, my Government has developed a programme\r\nof economic reforms, the National Economic\r\nEmpowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS).\r\nThe programme, which places people first, is aimed at\r\nlaying a solid foundation for sustainable socio-\r\neconomic transformation and poverty eradication. By\r\nits design, it will strengthen governance, enhance\r\ntransparency, intensify the fight against corruption and\r\ndevelop infrastructure — especially in the areas of\r\nelectricity, water and roads. It also places high priority\r\non food security, agricultural development and the\r\npromotion of small- and medium-scale enterprises.\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nI believe that that ambitious economic reform\r\nwill constitute an important national contribution to the\r\nattainment of the targets of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and of the objectives of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). In that\r\nconnection, my Government’s new reform programme\r\nis a clarion call to national mobilization and re-\r\norientation. However, it also envisages active\r\ncooperation by our multilateral and bilateral partners.\r\nWe are all too well aware that the development of our\r\nagricultural sector, by which the majority of our people\r\nstill earn their living, cannot be successful as long as\r\nhuge subsidies to agriculture in the developed countries\r\ncontinue. My Government, therefore, wishes to use this\r\nforum to call again for the reform of the system of\r\nsubsidies to agricultural production, which is\r\nstrangulating agriculture in developing countries.\r\nIn this connection, it is regrettable that the\r\nreasonable proposals made by the group of developing\r\ncountries at the recently concluded World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Cancún\r\nwere rejected by their negotiating partners, leading to\r\nthe collapse of the Conference. Creating conditions of\r\nfair and undistorted trade would be the most effective\r\nway of providing additional resources to developing\r\ncountries. This is particularly urgent in light of the low\r\nlevels of official development assistance and the recent\r\nsharp decline in the flow of foreign direct investment.\r\nOther areas that we hope the international\r\ncommunity will address with determination include the\r\nproblem of external debt. This continues to be a major\r\nobstacle to the development of my country and many\r\nother African countries. It is evident that the various\r\ninitiatives by the international community on debt\r\nrelief and debt management have been able neither to\r\naddress nor solve the problems.\r\nWhile appreciating the efforts by the international\r\ncommunity in the context of the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries (HIPC) initiative, we must observe that these\r\nefforts have not provided adequate responses or\r\nsolutions to the problems. This is even more true in the\r\ncase of the heavily indebted middle-income countries,\r\nlike Nigeria, for whom no special debt relief\r\nmechanism exists, although such machinery was\r\nsuccessfully established for countries in Eastern and\r\nCentral Europe, for instance.\r\nNigeria believes, therefore, that bolder steps must\r\nbe taken to resolve the heavy debt burden, which for a\r\nlarge number of countries has become unsustainable\r\nand a hindrance to development. I am afraid that we\r\nhave no effective mechanism in place to tackle this\r\nproblem. Neither the Bretton Woods institutions nor the\r\nParis and London Clubs alone can provide lasting\r\nsolutions and relief. I therefore believe that this issue is\r\nof such significance for the peace and development of\r\nsuch a large portion of the world community that we\r\nneed to create a mechanism within the United Nations\r\nto address the problem in its full scope, based on the\r\nprinciple of the joint responsibility of debtors and\r\ncreditors alike.\r\nWe welcome the ongoing negotiations for a\r\nlegally binding instrument on the repatriation of\r\nillicitly acquired funds stashed away in foreign\r\ncountries. We call for the early conclusion of the\r\nConvention on that issue. This Convention is expected\r\nto make more resources available for development and\r\nshow concretely the global commitment to eradicating\r\nlarge-scale corruption, which is at the origin of the\r\nfunds. In this connection, I must say that the\r\nexperience of my country has been one of only\r\nlukewarm cooperation by most countries where our\r\nlooted funds have been traced. Our partners among the\r\ngreat banking nations should recognize that it is\r\ncontradictory to condemn corruption on the one hand,\r\nand, on the other, to hinder us in the recovery of the\r\nplundered funds. For our economic and social reform\r\nprogrammes, the funds to be recovered can make a\r\nhuge difference in meeting our national objectives. I\r\nearnestly appeal through this forum for maximum\r\ncooperation in repatriating the looted funds. I take this\r\nopportunity to thank those countries that have matched\r\ntheir words with actions in assisting us in repatriating\r\nlooted funds.\r\nLast year, this Assembly endorsed the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) as the\r\nframework for development of the continent. We\r\ncommend the Group of 8 for their Africa Action Plan\r\nto support the implementation of NEPAD and hope that\r\nthis will soon be translated into cooperation on specific\r\nprogrammes and projects. In addition, we hope that the\r\ndeveloped countries will also concretely demonstrate\r\ntheir support for NEPAD.\r\nFor our part in Nigeria, the Government’s\r\neconomic reform programme is a commitment to\r\ncontinue to make our contribution to an African\r\nrenaissance, which will underpin NEPAD.\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nWe welcome the establishment by the United\r\nNations of the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa\r\nand urge that adequate resources be provided for its\r\nmandate to be discharged effectively.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to ravage our\r\ncontinent, affecting most of all the productive segment\r\nof the population. To combat the epidemic, my\r\nGovernment has embarked on a major national\r\nprogramme of action, the highlight of which consists of\r\na nationwide public enlightenment campaign and mass\r\nmobilization to deepen awareness and understanding of\r\nthe disease, the prevention and control of its spread and\r\nmodalities for providing care and support for people\r\nliving with the virus. To contribute to the global\r\nprogramme on HIV/AIDS, Nigeria has redeemed its\r\npledge of $10,000,000 to the Global Fund.\r\nLet me urge all countries that have not yet made\r\npledges to the Global Fund to do so urgently. Those\r\nthat have made pledges should kindly redeem them\r\nearly. I wish to acknowledge with gratitude, the efforts\r\nso far deployed by the international community on the\r\npandemic, and to thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\nfor convening yesterday the high-level plenary meeting\r\ndevoted to HIV/AIDS. However, a lot still needs to be\r\ndone in a more concerted way to address all aspects of\r\nthe problem, including the issue of more international\r\nfunding and access to affordable drugs. These actions\r\nmust be taken urgently if the Millennium Development\r\nGoal of halting and reversing the spread of this dreaded\r\ndisease by 2015 is to be achieved.\r\nThe issue of terrorism has been of great\r\npreoccupation to our Organization in the past few\r\nyears. Several instances of terrorist attacks continue to\r\nsurface in different parts of the world, involving the\r\nloss of innocent lives and vast destruction of\r\nproperties.\r\nNigeria reiterates its condemnation of terrorism in\r\nall its manifestations, and joins other Member States in\r\nthe global determination to combat this veritable threat\r\nto national and international security. We support the\r\nwork of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, and\r\nreaffirm our conviction that a comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism will constitute an\r\nimportant instrument for the protection of the\r\nindividual and collective rights to life.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East, which we had\r\nhoped would improve with the adoption of the road\r\nmap for a peaceful settlement of the conflict, has again\r\ndeteriorated. We call on the parties to halt the new\r\ncycle of violence — a cycle from which neither side\r\nstands to gain. We believe that any violation of the\r\nterms of the peace plan by either side does a great\r\ndisservice to the Palestinians, as well as to the Israelis.\r\nWe therefore appeal to both sides to demonstrate their\r\nfull commitment to the implementation of the plan so\r\nas to create conditions for the peaceful coexistence of a\r\nPalestinian State, side by side with the State of Israel.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to comment briefly on\r\nthe issue of the reform of our Organization so as to\r\nmake it more responsive to contemporary global needs\r\nand challenges. Nigeria has noted with dismay that\r\nobstacles continue to be placed in the way of the\r\nadoption of any of the constructive proposals for the\r\nreform of the Security Council. The changes that are\r\nbeing made in the Council’s working methods to make\r\nit more open to non-members are appreciated; however,\r\nthese are no more than marginal. I wish again to\r\nreiterate Nigeria’s long held conviction that what is\r\nrequired is a more fundamental reform that would\r\ndemocratize the Security Council and thus reposition it\r\nto enable it to respond to issues of international peace\r\nand security in a more comprehensive, objective and\r\neffective manner. The overwhelming membership of\r\nour Organization demands no less in the interest of its\r\ncontinued relevance.\r\nWe cannot preach and endeavour to practise\r\nparticipation and inclusiveness at the national level\r\nwhile denying it at the global level of the United\r\nNations, and expect that all will be well. Yet we have\r\nno substitute for this universal Organization. That point\r\nis now becoming evident in the context of the current\r\nsituation of Iraq. Whatever the circumstances in which\r\nthe Iraqi war occurred, the role played by the United\r\nNations will be decisive in resolving the present\r\nimpasse. Our Organization has now established itself in\r\nthe post-conflict pacification of States. We can use that\r\nvast United Nations experience to our advantage in\r\nmanaging the current post-conflict situation in Iraq. We\r\nnow have the possibility of an independent democratic\r\nIraq, and we must not waste this opportunity.\r\nOne obvious point of disagreement relates to the\r\nissue of decision-making, both prior to and after the\r\nIraqi war. This may be symptomatic of the\r\ndeficiencies — to which I alluded — that are not\r\nconducive to the well-being of our Organization. Let us\r\ntherefore undertake the necessary reforms in order to\r\nmake our Organization work for all of us so that we\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\ncan deal effectively and adequately with the pressing\r\nissues of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Nigeria for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Olusegun Obasanjo, President of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Nigeria, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Right Honourable Jean\r\nChrétien, Prime Minister of Canada\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Canada.\r\nMr. Jean Chrétien, Prime Minister of Canada,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Right Honourable Jean\r\nChrétien, Prime Minister of Canada, and inviting him\r\nto address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Chrétien (Canada) (spoke in French): It is a\r\ngreat pleasure for me to address this important\r\ngathering. I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on\r\nyour assumption of the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly and to wish you well.\r\nAs is well-known, Canada has always believed in\r\na multilateral approach to global issues — not for\r\nideological reasons, but because it is a proven way to\r\nenhance security and to resolve those over-arching\r\nproblems that transcend national frameworks.\r\nThe present era provides us with enormous\r\nopportunities for action. We can improve health and\r\nextend life expectancy, especially in poor countries; we\r\ncan safeguard security and the rights of citizens; and\r\nwe can increase access to education and help people to\r\nfulfil their aspirations.\r\nThe present era also presents us with urgent\r\nchallenges: protecting the environment; rolling back\r\ndiseases such as AIDS and malaria; preventing conflict\r\nand ending impunity for crimes against humanity;\r\nputting a stop to terrorism and organized crime; and\r\ncontrolling weapons of mass destruction.\r\nEach Government is responsible for taking action\r\nwithin its own borders. In this global era, however,\r\nsuch issues cannot be successfully addressed by States\r\nacting alone. Multilateral cooperation is indispensable\r\nto ensure the well-being of citizens and to protect them\r\neffectively from harm. We need only consider the fight\r\nagainst terrorism. None of us has ever believed that\r\nterrorism could be controlled, let alone stopped,\r\nwithout the cooperation of all of us. The task of drying\r\nup the sources of terrorist funding also requires\r\ncoordination and effective legal regimes. Information-\r\nsharing is imperative if attacks are to be prevented.\r\nThe United Nations has been playing an\r\nextremely useful role in this fight. Since the tragic\r\nevents of 11 September 2001, the Security Council has\r\nbeen undertaking an extensive effort in support of the\r\nfight against international terrorism.\r\nWe could also consider the issue of health.\r\nDistance from the source of new viruses no longer\r\nprovides us with protection. The next virus may be just\r\nan aeroplane flight away. Multilateral cooperation is\r\nessential for the management of health threats. We risk\r\ndisaster if we do not share with each other all\r\ninformation that is are available to us and if we do not\r\ncoordinate efforts to combat epidemics. Coordinated\r\naction is also required for development in poor\r\ncountries and to ensure reasonable access to health\r\ncare.\r\nWe need only consider, furthermore, the ongoing\r\nproblem of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.\r\nThe proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction\r\namong States and terrorist groups represents a growing\r\nthreat. Such proliferation must be prevented through\r\ncoordination, the strict application of export controls,\r\nrigorous verification, the enforcement of multilateral\r\ntreaties and other forms of collective action under\r\ninternational law.\r\nWe all recognize that the United Nations has\r\nenabled us to successfully address many international\r\nchallenges. But we also recognize that we have failed\r\nin certain other cases. We have been slow to adapt the\r\nUnited Nations to changing circumstances. The time\r\nhas come to begin bold renewal at the United Nations.\r\nThis morning, the Secretary-General set out\r\nproposals that are timely, necessary and courageous. I\r\ncongratulate him on his remarkable statement, and I\r\ncan reaffirm that Canada subscribes fully to the\r\nobjectives that he proposes.\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nThe United Nations remains the principal\r\ninstrument for effective multilateral action. I call on\r\nmy fellow leaders to make meaningful United Nations\r\nreform a priority.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe should not be pessimistic about our ability to\r\nsucceed. Consider some United Nations successes: the\r\n2000 Millennium Summit and, in Monterrey, Mexico,\r\nthe 2002 International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment. We created a shared framework on\r\nsetting priorities for more effective aid; we set targets\r\nand key principles; we spelled out mutual\r\naccountabilities for developed and developing\r\ncountries. That spirit of accountability and shared\r\nresponsibility also lies at the heart of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development and of the Group\r\nof Eight Africa Action Plan. And it has led to policy\r\ninitiatives with respect to market access and the\r\navailability of pharmaceutical drugs to poor countries.\r\nFor instance, this year Canada eliminated virtually all\r\ntariffs and quotas on products from least developed\r\ncountries.\r\nAt the same time, the outcome of the World Trade\r\nOrganization meeting in Cancún is very, very\r\nworrisome. Agricultural subsidies of developed\r\ncountries must be radically reduced to give developing\r\ncountries — particularly in Africa — the chance to\r\nprosper. The developed world has an obligation to act,\r\nand to act quickly.\r\nColleagues, on no issue is progress more\r\nnecessary or more urgent than on the protection of the\r\ninnocent. Canada, in partnership with others, advocates\r\nputting the protection of people at the heart of the\r\nmandate of the Organization. Too often, conflicts are\r\nallowed to start, even when the whole world can see\r\nwhat the dreadful consequences will be. Too often,\r\ninnocent civilians are left to their fate.\r\nNext year will mark the tenth anniversary of the\r\ngenocide in Rwanda. In all conscience, we must ask\r\nourselves: are we any more ready now than we were\r\nthen to respond to another Rwanda? I fear the answer,\r\nunfortunately, is no.\r\nIt was with our collective failures in Bosnia and\r\nRwanda in mind that Canada sponsored the\r\nInternational Commission on Intervention and State\r\nSovereignty. The Commission has done excellent work,\r\nand in its report, it argues that sovereignty entails\r\nresponsibility as well as rights.\r\nThe most fundamental duty of a State is to protect\r\nits people. When a Government cannot or will not do\r\nso, the responsibility to protect them becomes\r\ntemporarily a collective international responsibility.\r\nSome question that idea because they fear intervention\r\non slight pretexts or with motives other than human\r\nprotection. Others, owing to their own tragic\r\nexperience, fear that there would be too little outside\r\ninvolvement. We need to reconcile those two concerns.\r\nWe believe — as does the Commission — that, in\r\nthe face of great loss of life or ethnic cleansing, the\r\ninternational community has a moral responsibility to\r\nprotect the vulnerable. The primary purpose must be to\r\navert and end human suffering. No entity is more\r\nappropriate than the Security Council to authorize\r\nmilitary action to protect the innocent. But the member\r\nStates of the Council have sometimes failed the\r\ninnocent. Past failures must motivate us to prepare\r\nbetter for future crises. We can reform how this place\r\nworks, improve its effectiveness, enhance its relevance\r\nand inspire its participants.\r\nBefore closing, I wish to comment on some of the\r\nchallenges to peace and security that we face. In\r\nAfghanistan, much has been achieved and much\r\nremains to be done. For our part, Canada has been\r\nengaged in the war on terrorism from the outset. We\r\nare the largest current military contributor to the\r\nInternational Security Assistance Force. We have\r\npledged 250 million Canadian dollars for humanitarian\r\nassistance and reconstruction. We are committed to\r\nhelping the Afghani people build a democratic,\r\npluralistic society. In Iraq, we have also joined the\r\ninternational effort to help the Iraqi people. We have\r\ndecided to contribute 300 million Canadian dollars, one\r\nof the largest single-country pledges we have ever\r\nmade. We are encouraged that the members of the\r\nSecurity Council are exploring how to elaborate upon\r\nthe United Nations role in the reconstruction and in\r\nprogress towards Iraqi self-government.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East preoccupies us,\r\nas it does the entire international community. Innocent\r\nlives on both sides are being lost. Israeli families and\r\nPalestinian families fear for their children and for their\r\nfuture. Terrorism and violence — in whatever form, to\r\nadvance whatever cause — simply creates more\r\nviolence and takes even more innocent life.\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nFor the international community, as for Israelis\r\nand Palestinians, despair is not an option. Our goal\r\nmust remain a political solution based on two viable\r\nStates, Israel and Palestine, within secure and\r\nrecognized borders. We need to support Palestinian\r\nefforts to develop modern, transparent and responsible\r\ngovernment. We need also to support those seeking to\r\npromote dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians in\r\nthe search for practical solutions to the core issues. It is\r\nour responsibility to help those who are preparing for\r\npeace, which must one day come.\r\nWhen the time is right, the international\r\ncommunity must be able to offer a robust international\r\npresence that will guarantee the safety and security of\r\nIsrael and of a Palestinian State, and we should be\r\ngetting ready to do so now. In addition, we should be\r\nlooking for lessons on how the international\r\ncommunity has acted in other places to stop\r\nviolence — as, for example, in Cyprus and in Kosovo.\r\nRegional tensions, the war on terror and efforts at\r\nreconstruction in recent hot spots must, nevertheless,\r\nnot distract us from continuing to help Africans realize\r\ntheir goals for trade and investment, democracy, human\r\ndevelopment and good governance.\r\nIn summary, multilateral cooperation remains\r\nindispensable. The United Nations remains at the heart\r\nof the multilateral system. New challenges demand\r\nnew structures, and a historic opportunity has emerged.\r\nLet us seize it, and let us realize the powerful\r\nidea that created the United Nations — the idea that\r\nnations can unite to save their people from the scourge\r\nof war. Let future generations say of us that we did not\r\nbetray that idea — that we realized the potential of this\r\ngreat body, supported it, renewed it and re-energized it\r\nto better serve humanity.\r\nMr. Jean Chrétien, Prime Minister of Canada,\r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. José Durão Barroso, Prime\r\nMinister of the Portuguese Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Portuguese\r\nRepublic.\r\nMr. José Durão Barroso, Prime Minister of the\r\nPortuguese Republic, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. José Durão Barroso,\r\nPrime Minister of the Portuguese Republic, and\r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Durão Barroso (Portugal) (spoke in\r\nPortuguese; English text provided by the delegation):\r\nIn September of each year the Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations politically rediscover the Organization\r\nof which they are shareholders and beneficiaries.\r\nThe practice of business as usual should not mark\r\nthis session of the General Assembly. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral suggested that the heads of State and\r\nGovernment come to New York to make their\r\ncontribution towards the strengthening of the United\r\nNations. Portugal, as a committed member of this\r\nOrganization, wishes to take part in this debate with a\r\nclear objective: to recognise, as does Kofi Annan, that\r\nthe United Nations is an indispensable tool, and also to\r\nrecognise that we must re-examine our practices and\r\nour working tools. Inactivity is not an option that this\r\nOrganization should contemplate.\r\nRethinking the United Nations means, first of all,\r\nreaffirming and rethinking its Charter. Maintaining\r\npeace and international security will continue to be our\r\nmain objective. But the reaffirmation of our faith in\r\nfundamental rights, in the dignity and worth of human\r\nbeings, in equality between men and women and in\r\nequality between nations, is also part of our vision for\r\nthe United Nations, as is the determination to promote,\r\ntogether, social progress and better living conditions\r\nfor our peoples.\r\nThese objectives must not be overlooked when\r\nthe Organization faces crises of confidence from time\r\nto time. The Secretary-General is correct in his\r\nencouragement to us to persevere. But a positive\r\nmental attitude is not enough. It is also essential that\r\nwe do not ask more of the Organization than it can\r\nprovide at any given moment. Otherwise, great\r\nexpectations will lead to great disappointments.\r\nRealism and pragmatism are necessary, but we\r\nmust not lose sight of the ambitious objectives that this\r\nOrganization is intended to serve. It is time for us to\r\nlook at the United Nations as a reflection of what we\r\nare collectively, and not as a convenient scapegoat to\r\nmask the incapacity that the Member States sometimes\r\nstill reveal when we should, but are unable, to act\r\ntogether.\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nWe are also bound to understand, sooner or later,\r\nthat we are facing common threats that require\r\ncommon responses. At the forefront of these threats is\r\nterrorism. In fact, a new type of terrorism has emerged:\r\nthe terrorism of mass destruction that constitutes a\r\ncrime against humanity; the terrorism that kills blindly\r\nand indiscriminately in New York, in Bali, in\r\nCasablanca and in Nairobi, in the name of non-values\r\npresented as values on ideological and religious\r\ngrounds; and the terrorism that did not spare the United\r\nNations itself, as we so tragically witnessed in\r\nBaghdad.\r\nThe crime which claimed the lives of Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello and his collaborators was an attack on\r\nall of the values which the United Nations represents. It\r\nwas an attack against us all. If there were still lingering\r\ndoubts or illusions when some thought that terrorism\r\nwas aimed essentially at some States, they disappeared\r\nin Baghdad.\r\nIt was not the Iraqi people who murdered Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello and United Nations personnel.\r\nTerrorists are responsible for that crime. It is not the\r\nIraqi people who are opposed to the United Nations\r\npresence in their country. Again, it is the terrorists. The\r\nUnited Nations must not bow to terrorism.\r\nPortugal believes that the United Nations should\r\nhave a central role in the definition of a global strategy\r\nfor fighting terrorism, largely because maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security depends on the\r\noutcome of this fight. It is a fight we must undertake\r\nwithout losing our souls, that is to say, the values on\r\nwhich this Organization is built. It is for this reason\r\nthat more security is necessary, but also more\r\ndemocracy, more dialogue between cultures and\r\ncivilizations, more development, more and better\r\nenvironmental protection measures and a drastic\r\nreduction in poverty.\r\nIt is also vital that this fight be undertaken in the\r\nname of, and with respect for, our law — international\r\nlaw. The concept of the rule of law should have real\r\nglobal resonance. This is why we defend the\r\nimprovement of the laws in force, namely through the\r\nnegotiation of a global convention on international\r\nterrorism. But we must also bear in mind that\r\ninternational law will be irrelevant without the\r\nimposition of its norms, by force if necessary.\r\nNew challenges and new threats require\r\ninnovative responses from the United Nations. It seems\r\nblatantly obvious that the composition and decision-\r\nmaking process of the Security Council are obsolete.\r\nBut changes are also needed in this Assembly, which\r\neach year automatically re-adopts hundreds of\r\nresolutions instead of adopting only those that are\r\nstrictly necessary. As for the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, the most that can be said is that the external\r\nimpact of its actions is not perceptible, while the\r\nTrusteeship Council is nothing more than a relic devoid\r\nof any relevant objective.\r\nIn his report on the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration (A/58/323), the Secretary-\r\nGeneral focused on this point with particular insight.\r\nThe proposals that he put forward should guide our\r\nthinking and joint action. But there is a particularly\r\nworrying aspect, on which we can, and indeed must,\r\nact without delay.\r\nI am referring to the need for the establishment of\r\na real preventive culture by the United Nations in\r\nmatters of armed conflict. In this context, we agree\r\nwith the relevance that the Secretary-General attributes\r\nto preventive diplomacy, to disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation measures, to peace-building, to respect for\r\nhuman rights, to good governance and to the\r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nIn the final analysis, we must be fully aware that\r\nthe usefulness of the United Nations will always be\r\njudged as a function of its capacity to avoid and handle\r\nconflicts. In the implementation of that mission, the\r\nfundamental role lies with the Security Council, which\r\nhas, over the years, authorized various peacekeeping\r\noperations. The overall result has been positive.\r\nPortugal has contributed significantly to those\r\noperations and remains available to continue to\r\ncollaborate with the United Nations.\r\nBut conditions on the ground are not always\r\nclear-cut, and it is not always possible to separate what\r\nis and what is not a conflict, and what would justify or\r\nnot an intervention by the Security Council. There is an\r\nimmense grey area that can be perilous in pre-conflict\r\nand post-conflict situations.\r\nWe must also create the tools for dealing with\r\ncountries and situations that do not need support in\r\nterms of security, namely through a peacekeeping\r\noperation. The intervention of the United Nations at the\r\ncritical phase of a conflict, followed by a premature\r\nwithdrawal, may well end in failure, which will\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nessentially lead to the waste of the investment made by\r\nthe international community up to that point.\r\nThis assessment recommends, for example, that\r\nthe United Nations continue to monitor closely the\r\nsituation in East Timor. It is a country whose\r\ndemocratic institutions are still in the consolidation\r\nphase. Without a tradition of self-government, it has\r\nmade uncommonly rapid progress in several areas but\r\nis still in need of our help and attention. If we truly\r\nwant East Timor to be a real success story for the\r\nUnited Nations, it is important to give the people of\r\nEast Timor time to consolidate their institutions.\r\nHowever, in other cases in which a peace\r\noperation is not yet justified and where State\r\ninstitutions are fragile, where there is an enormous lack\r\nof basic services and development has not taken off, it\r\nis advisable to have a strong United Nations presence,\r\ncoordinated on the ground by the Secretary-General.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nmention Guinea-Bissau, which is frequently\r\noverlooked and which once again requires our\r\nattention. Having avoided falling into a destructive\r\nspiral as has happened to so many countries in the\r\nregion, that country is still fighting to recover. It must\r\nbe helped, not ignored. They are a people who can and\r\nshould be helped by the international community —\r\nand indeed deserve to be. For that reason, we support\r\nthe efforts of the Secretary-General on behalf of\r\ndemocracy and development and applaud the original\r\ncontribution of the Economic and Social Council.\r\nUnder the present conditions, the Security\r\nCouncil does not take into account all the factors\r\ninvolved in prevention: security, nation building and\r\ndevelopment. Each one follows a more or less\r\nindependent path.\r\nThere is one other factor to add: the Council is\r\nfully absorbed with the management of the most\r\npressing matters on the international agenda and at\r\ntimes demonstrates a notorious lack of attention to\r\nsome countries in pre- or post-conflict situations.\r\nWe believe there is a solid case for advocating the\r\ncreation of a new institutional mechanism: a new\r\ncommission with the mandate to routinely monitor\r\ncases of conflict-prevention and the creation of\r\nconditions for peace and development. In conjunction\r\nwith the Security Council and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, which would both preserve their respective\r\nareas of competence, this commission could identify\r\nand deal with the most pressing needs. For each of the\r\ncountries in situations of risk, it would draw up\r\nintegrated strategies allying the objectives of security\r\nand strengthening institutions and economic and social\r\ndevelopment. While other decisions of great importance\r\nare being prepared, we can — and should — begin here\r\nto deal with pre- and post-conflict situations.\r\nIt is not enough for the United Nations to affirm\r\nits relevance. It is absolutely indispensable that the\r\nOrganization is seen as relevant by the Member States\r\nand that States act accordingly. The credibility of the\r\nOrganization must not be questioned. Otherwise its\r\nfunctioning and effectiveness may be severely\r\ncompromised.\r\nIraq is undoubtedly the case that requires of us\r\nall, in particular the members of the Security Council,\r\nthat we carefully evaluate the Organization’s capacity\r\nfor action. A collective turn of the page is necessary,\r\nsince there is no valid alternative to a policy that\r\nenables the Iraqi people to freely define their system of\r\nGovernment and political leadership and that maintains\r\nthe country’s political and territorial integrity. To build\r\na democratic society on the ruins of one of the most\r\nviolent dictatorships of the past century is a challenge\r\nthe international community must not shrink. It is a\r\ntask that demands much realism with respect to the\r\ndifficulties to be confronted.\r\nFor that very reason, Portugal has always been in\r\nfavour of the progressive involvement of the United\r\nNations in Iraq’s stabilization process, with a\r\ncorresponding gradual transfer of power to Iraqi\r\nrepresentatives. We also encourage the Security\r\nCouncil to come to a rapid understanding on this\r\nmatter. For our part, we are already taking concrete\r\nsteps, including in the security field, to support all\r\nthose that are already locally assisting the Iraqi people\r\nto live in freedom.\r\nA larger commitment by the international\r\ncommunity is indispensable for resuming the Middle\r\nEast peace process. The road map cannot be shelved. It\r\nis up to us to demand a proactive attitude from all\r\ninterested parties. Also, we should not be indifferent to\r\nthe Palestinian people’s legitimate desire for liberty\r\nand self-determination. Israel and Palestine will have to\r\ncoexist in peace and in security, within recognized\r\nborders. But here again, terrorism, which only benefits\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nthe enemies of peace, must be condemned without\r\nambiguity.\r\nGreat challenges generate great opportunities. It\r\nis up to us, the Members of the United Nations, to\r\ncreate the conditions that will allow this Organization\r\nto function in accordance with its potential and the\r\nideas that were an integral part of its creation. Those\r\nideas remain valid, and Portugal stands ready to give\r\nits contribution.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nPortuguese Republic for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. José Durão Barroso, Prime Minister of the\r\nPortuguese Republic, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Kenny Davis Anthony, Prime\r\nMinister, Minister for Finance, Planning,\r\nInformation and the Public Service of\r\nSaint Lucia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister, Minister for Finance,\r\nPlanning, Information and the Public Service of Saint\r\nLucia.\r\nMr. Kenny Davis Anthony, Prime Minister of\r\nSaint Lucia, Minister for Finance, Planning,\r\nInformation and the Public Service, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency the Honourable Kenny\r\nDavis Anthony, the Prime Minister, Minister for\r\nFinance, Planning, Information and the Public Service\r\nof Saint Lucia, and in inviting him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Anthony (Saint Lucia): It is neither pride nor\r\nthe prospect of privilege that moves us to assume the\r\nPresidency of the United Nations General Assembly\r\nbut a certain determination that is the unspoken\r\nstrength of islands. Nor is it merely that we are\r\nhonoured — though indeed we are — but that we also\r\nfeel worthy, as worthy as any other member of this\r\ncommunity and determined to make our contribution to\r\nthe progress of humanity and the welfare of the world.\r\nSaint Lucia recognizes and appreciates that this\r\nPresidency became a reality only with the support of\r\nthe Latin American and Caribbean family.\r\nOur preoccupation is not with size, sovereignty or\r\npower but with people, and by this measure we are not\r\nsmall, nor are we just an island, for we do not stand\r\nalone. We stand as one Member of this Organization,\r\nproud of the legacy and the vision that we can offer the\r\nworld. We assume this role because we wish to offer\r\nthat vision to the world — because it is larger than our\r\n238 square miles and larger than our population of\r\n159,000 people. It is a vision we wish to place at the\r\nservice of humanity.\r\nIt is our hope that Saint Lucia’s presidency will\r\noffer a fresh perspective, an alternative view, and a\r\ndifferent, but not discordant, voice to the heart of the\r\nAssembly. As such, the people and the Government of\r\nSaint Lucia express both their appreciation and their\r\ndetermination to the members of this international\r\ncommunity — appreciation for the faith and trust\r\nbestowed upon us with the presidency of this\r\ninstitution, and determination that we shall not fail it,\r\nbut be judged equal to the task before us. If it is a task\r\nof Herculean proportion, then we will face it with equal\r\nconfidence, certain that the rebuilding of our broken\r\nhumanity is a matter which we encounter in the\r\ncompany of equally resolute and undaunted partners.\r\nSince the end of the cold war, the legitimacy,\r\ncredibility and relevance of this time-honoured\r\ninstitution have never been so questioned as they are\r\ntoday. The United Nations Millennium Declaration was\r\ndesigned to revive the dying pulse of all humanity but\r\nhas itself become comatose. Indeed, Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan was moved to state that:\r\n“It is uncertain whether the consensus and\r\nthe vision that the Millennium Declaration\r\nexpressed are still intact.”\r\nSaint Lucia therefore calls on the international\r\ncommunity to heed the appeal of our Secretary-General\r\nto seek balance between the imperatives of military\r\nsecurity and human security. In the interest of\r\nredistributive justice, global peace and security, the\r\ndeveloped countries must not renege on their\r\ncommitments to the developing world in the areas of\r\ntrade, debt relief and aid.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration goal of halving\r\nglobal poverty is receding into nothingness, but it can\r\nbe rescued if developed countries make good on their\r\npledges. Moreover, we might challenge ourselves\r\nbeyond merely halving global poverty, by aspiring to\r\nits virtual elimination. By now, it should be clear to us\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nall that poverty issues are inseparable from human\r\nrights issues, as are environmental issues from\r\neconomic and political development issues. National\r\nsecurity and international stability can be realized only\r\nwhere there is justice.\r\nIt was the prophet Isaiah who reminded us that if\r\nmankind is brought low, everyone will be humbled. Yet\r\nif we, the international community, retreat from the\r\nideals of the creation of a greater humanity, we would\r\nalso be retreating from the core values and principles\r\nenshrined within the United Nations Charter. More\r\nimportantly, we would be tacitly endorsing the return\r\nand consolidation of a global uncivil society — the\r\nsymptoms of which are already manifest within our\r\nglobal society. Religious intolerance, tribal aggression\r\nand civil war continue to ravage many parts of our\r\nplanet. Among the victims are the poor, the\r\nmarginalized and the vulnerable — often women and\r\nchildren, who play no part in the making of war but\r\nfind themselves stripped of their human dignity and\r\nbasic human rights. Terrorist attacks in Bali, Kenya,\r\nSaudi Arabia and Baghdad add to our symptoms of\r\nimpending rupture.\r\nThe arteries of conscience are becoming hardened\r\nby the frequency of wanton violence, yet on occasion\r\nthere are incidents that shock our sensibilities. The\r\nmurder of Sergio Vieira de Mello and other United\r\nNations colleagues reminds us of the mindless horror at\r\nthe heart of that darkness. Saint Lucia joins the\r\ninternational community in expressing sympathy to\r\ntheir families, and we reiterate our profound respect to\r\nthose international workers who are so willing to make\r\nthe ultimate sacrifice to extend humanitarian\r\nassistance, security and comfort to those in peril and in\r\nneed.\r\nIn this environment, it is essential that we\r\nmaintain a United Nations which steadfastly adheres to\r\nits original core values. Saint Lucia will resist any\r\nattempt to de-legitimize the United Nations system.\r\nAny strategy which claims to embrace peace, security\r\nand justice and yet excludes the United Nations belies\r\na flawed and unreal conception of world affairs. This\r\nOrganization has been instrumental in the preservation\r\nof the nation-State within a framework of binding\r\nrelationships among Governments. More importantly,\r\nthe United Nations has been a devoted guardian of\r\nindividual rights and freedoms. Saint Lucia maintains\r\nthat the United Nations, precisely because of its\r\ndiversity, is the only organization with the political and\r\nmoral legitimacy to deal adequately with global issues.\r\nThis universal body — this United Nations — has\r\nno other choice but to heed the lessons of the past and\r\nthe wisdom of the ages in its attempt to better serve\r\nhumanity. When our predecessor organization, the\r\nLeague of Nations, was discarded as irrelevant, we\r\nwitnessed the advance of disorder and human\r\ncatastrophe on a scale never before envisioned. If we\r\nstand idly by now, while this time-honoured institution\r\nis rendered irrelevant and toothless, we will have\r\ncommissioned an epitaph for humanity.\r\nSaint Lucia therefore calls for the completion of\r\nthe efforts at reforming the Security Council to better\r\nreflect the realities of this new century and to make it\r\nmore representative — more democratic, legitimate\r\nand transparent. The existing veto system is too easily\r\ninfluenced by national interests to address serious\r\nissues afflicting humankind. If a coalition of the\r\nwilling could be assembled for war, then surely we can\r\nalso gather a coalition of the willing to address the\r\nproblems of poverty, disease, illiteracy, hunger, and\r\ntrade imbalances. There can be no sanitizing of one\r\ncorner of the globe while contagion, despair and\r\ndesperation fester elsewhere. There is no security for\r\nthe one while insecurity plagues the other.\r\nBut, ultimately, the strength of the United Nations\r\nmust come from the political will of the Member\r\nStates — a political will that must accept that everyone\r\nshould adhere to, abide by, and implement all the\r\ndecisions taken and resolutions adopted by the\r\nOrganization. We cannot, in the name of national\r\ninterest, observe only some resolutions and expect to\r\nhave a strong United Nations.\r\nThe United Nations cannot be strengthened if we\r\ndo not have the political will to accept that its activities\r\ncannot be dictated by the agendas of a few powerful\r\nStates. It must embrace, in equal measure, the concerns\r\nof the small and the weak that are the majority of its\r\nMembers. No single State, by virtue of its economic or\r\nmilitary might, should determine, on its own, the\r\nobligations and responsibilities of the rest of humanity.\r\n“Muscular unilateralism” and the emerging\r\ndoctrine of diplomatic unilateralism cannot be the\r\npreferred approach to serious global issues.\r\nExceptionalism within the international system is\r\ncertain to fragment international cooperation, making it\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nless likely that countries will forgo aspects of national\r\nsovereignty in the interest of the common good.\r\nIt has become abundantly clear that the\r\ninternational community will not succeed in its war\r\nagainst terrorism if it fails to address root causes. The\r\ncurrent war on terrorism is designed to capture, confine\r\nor eliminate existing terrorist networks without\r\naddressing the causes of terrorism. Terrorism does not\r\nstem simply from the arrogance and madness of a few\r\ndictators and misguided fanatics; it is also the result of\r\ndeep-seated inequity and, sometimes, bigotry. If the\r\nstatus quo denies opportunity, freedom and fulfilment\r\nto those who hunger and dwell in despair, the appeal of\r\nchaos and extremism as an avenue to change becomes\r\nthat much more attractive. If, on the other hand, we\r\nperceive that the world order works in the interests of\r\nall of us, there will be a universal commitment to\r\nsustain that order. Consequently, it is imperative that\r\nthe international community jointly address economic\r\ninjustice and political exclusion as common enemies of\r\nus all.\r\nYour assumption, Sir, of the presidency of this\r\ninstitution at this time, as a representative of a small\r\nisland developing State — one of the smallest\r\nMembers of the United Nations — is both a tribute to\r\nthe democratic principles of the United Nations and a\r\nsignal of the need to conclude the process of\r\nrevitalizing the work of the General Assembly. We\r\nmust conquer delay, procrastination, repetition and\r\ninaction.\r\nMany years have passed since deliberations on\r\nthe reform of the Security Council began; and yet there\r\nis no end in sight. Consultations on the revitalization of\r\nthe General Assembly first began 13 years ago, and on\r\nthat issue, too, there is no end in sight.\r\nFor some reason, the United Nations seems to\r\nenjoy operating in decades. We create decades for our\r\nprogrammes, and when we fail to take action in a\r\nparticular decade, we simply declare another decade.\r\nAnd so the cycle continues — for decades. This body\r\ncan no longer afford the luxury of “decade syndrome”,\r\ncompounded as it is by bureaucratic operations bound\r\nby tradition and habit.\r\nWe must be extremely proactive on the question\r\nof the revitalization of the General Assembly. Saint\r\nLucia therefore wishes to propose that during this\r\nsession we review all the draft resolutions before us,\r\nand determine which need to be consigned to the\r\nrecord books and which merit the continued attention\r\nof the Assembly. We need to restructure the time\r\nframe, as well as the working methods, of the\r\nAssembly and its Main Committees, so as to make\r\nmore productive use of an entire year, rather than\r\nengaging in a three-month frenzy of activities.\r\nFurthermore, we should consider making the agendas\r\nof the Main Committees and the Assembly more\r\nrelevant to the general debate. It is our view that these\r\nshould flow from the themes enunciated at the general\r\ndebate.\r\nThe United Nations must not compromise its role\r\nin global economic governance and development. Saint\r\nLucia calls for Members to resist attempts to dilute the\r\ndevelopment agenda through cuts and freezes of\r\nregular and core budget allocations.\r\nSaint Lucia reiterates the need for reform of the\r\nsystem of global economic governance so as to allow\r\nfor fair trade and special and differential treatment for\r\ndeveloping countries. The current global governance\r\nsystem has failed many small States by eliminating\r\ncommodity protocols and the quota and price\r\npreferences that sustain small economies.\r\nUnfortunately, they have been replaced by the\r\nconspicuous indifference of neo-liberal economic\r\npractice. This has contributed to the decimation of\r\nmany Caribbean economies. It is Saint Lucia’s earnest\r\nplea that the distortions in farm trade about which —\r\ndespite their prevalence — discussion is conspicuously\r\navoided, will be treated in a manner reflective of the\r\nredistributive priorities of this Organization. We are\r\ntherefore determined that a more inclusive and\r\ntransparent global governance system should hold as\r\nsacred the goals and aspirations of those of us in the\r\ndeveloping world who strive against all odds.\r\nAmong the most vulnerable countries in the\r\nworld today are some of the territories that are on the\r\nUnited Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.\r\nThese countries, the majority of which are small island\r\nStates in the Caribbean and the Pacific, have yet to\r\nexercise the right to self-determination. In the words of\r\nthe Secretary-General, it is time for the United Nations\r\nto bring to a close this colonial chapter of history.\r\nWe therefore welcome the cooperation that the\r\nSpecial Committee of 24 on decolonization has\r\nrecently been receiving from the administering Powers\r\nof those Territories and the advances that have\r\nconsequently been made in the work of the Committee.\r\n29\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nWe further welcome the negotiations that have just\r\nbegun, for the first time, between the Special\r\nCommittee and the United Kingdom on the process of\r\ndecolonization in the Caribbean. We look forward to\r\ncontinued cooperation with the administering Powers\r\nso that the goal of self-determination for all of these\r\nTerritories can be achieved in less than a decade.\r\nWe believe that this General Assembly\r\npresidency is both symbolic and strategic — not just\r\nfor ourselves, but for this Organization and the\r\nrevitalization of its development agenda. That a small\r\ndeveloping country should aspire to and attain such\r\nhigh office is a testament to the magnanimity of this\r\nnoble institution. It is an opportunity to demonstrate\r\nthat global equity and universal democracy remain\r\nmeaningful constructs of the world community.\r\nOur voice can be ignored or it can be heeded, but\r\nit will not be silenced. The choice of an appropriate\r\nresponse rests with this community. Our presence here,\r\nhowever, is a manifestation of our belief that humanity\r\ndemands conscious renewal — renewal to guarantee\r\nthat the international community resists war,\r\nremembers the poor and is prepared to give tangible\r\nmeaning to the Charter, to which we all subscribe as\r\nresponsible members of the world community.\r\nBut there can be no renewal if faith in the United\r\nNations system is not also restored and retained. The\r\nUnited Nations must remain as the moral epicentre of\r\nworld politics. Any re-conceptualization of the\r\narchitecture of global governance that excludes the\r\nUnited Nations will leave the world weaker, more\r\ndivided, vulnerable and less secure. This cannot and\r\nshould not be our legacy to future generations, who\r\nwill judge us not by our words or espoused principles,\r\nbut by the actions we employ to render this world fit\r\nfor human habitation.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister, Minister\r\nfor Finance, Planning, Information and the Public\r\nService of Saint Lucia for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Kenny Davis Anthony, Prime Minister,\r\nMinister for Finance, Planning, Information and\r\nthe Public Service of Saint Lucia, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nMr. Chimunthu Banda (Malawi), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nAddress by His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad\r\nAl-Jaber Al-Sabah, Prime Minister of Kuwait\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Kuwait.\r\nSheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah,\r\nPrime Minister of Kuwait, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-\r\nSabah, Prime Minister of the State of Kuwait, and\r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nSheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah\r\n(Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): It gives me pleasure to\r\nbegin my statement by congratulating the President,\r\nboth personally and as representative of his country,\r\nSaint Lucia, on his election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. Given his skills\r\nand experience, we are confident that he will\r\ncompetently lead our deliberations as we consider the\r\npressing global issues that face the Organization at this\r\ncritical time. He may be assured of my delegation’s\r\nreadiness to fully cooperate with him in order to ensure\r\nthe successful fulfilment of his mandate. I wish also to\r\npay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for his\r\nactive and positive role and for his remarkable\r\ncontribution to the promotion of international\r\ncooperation.\r\nIn addition, I wish to express once again our\r\nappreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless efforts to bring peace\r\nand stability to the various troubled regions throughout\r\nthe world. Mr. Annan deserves special tribute for his\r\nextraordinary performance in maintaining the integrity\r\nof the United Nations and its leading role in moving\r\nthe global agenda forward, despite the enormous\r\nchallenges and high risks facing the Organization and\r\nits personnel. The terrorist attack against the United\r\nNations office in Baghdad last month, which claimed\r\nthe lives of the Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and of a number of his\r\ncolleagues, is yet further clear testimony of those\r\nchallenging difficulties and immense dangers. Another\r\nsimilar terrorist attack occurred two days ago, and\r\nagain the target was the United Nations presence in\r\nIraq.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I reiterate our condemnation\r\nof that terrorist act and of all other similar acts that\r\n30\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nhave occurred in the cities of Baghdad and Najaf.\r\nThose attacks claimed the lives of highly respected\r\nreligious leaders and symbols and other innocent\r\nvictims. We believe that such acts are aimed not only at\r\nthe underpinnings of security, of stability and of the\r\npeople’s sense of confidence, but also at the noble\r\nvalues that we all seek to restore and consolidate in\r\nbrotherly Iraq.\r\nPerhaps the most appropriate and resolute\r\nresponse to such criminal acts is a two-track approach.\r\nThe United Nations, together with the international\r\nPowers interested in the Iraqi question who are also\r\nseeking to establish security and stability in Iraq,\r\nshould stay the course and resolutely face the\r\ncontinuing violence there. In the meantime, further\r\nefforts should focus on enabling the Iraqi people to\r\nconsolidate national legitimacy and to develop national\r\ninstitutions. In parallel, efforts for Iraq’s reconstruction\r\nshould be intensified in order to make up for many\r\nlong years of deprivation, oppression, destruction and\r\nmismanagement painfully endured by the Iraqi people\r\nunder the now-defunct regime that was removed by\r\nconcerted international action anchored in Security\r\nCouncil resolutions related to Iraq’s liberation.\r\nKuwait strongly condemns the inhuman crimes\r\nand practices perpetrated by the previous regime in\r\nIraq. The most recent manifestation of those atrocities\r\nwas the discovery of numerous mass-grave sites in\r\nvarious parts of the country. Those graves contained\r\nthe remains of thousands of innocent human beings —\r\nparticularly those of Kuwaitis and third-country\r\nnationals — among which 33 were identified by\r\nforensic experts as having been prisoners who were\r\nexecuted by shooting in 1991 and 1992. That is further\r\nproof of the regime’s brutality and of its total disregard\r\nfor international treaties and for the norms of\r\ninternational humanitarian law. Above and beyond the\r\ncrimes themselves, for the past 13 years the regime\r\npersistently denied any knowledge of those prisoners’\r\nwhereabouts. It also ignored relevant decisions of the\r\nSecurity Council and of other international and\r\nregional organizations calling for its cooperation in\r\ndisclosing the fate of those victims, only aggravating\r\ntheir relatives’ anguish.\r\nHaving said that, I should like to add that Kuwait\r\nwill pursue its efforts, in coordination with the United\r\nNations, the International Committee of the Red Cross,\r\nthe Tripartite Commission, the interim Coalition\r\nAuthority and the citizens of Iraq, to determine the fate\r\nof the remaining Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners\r\nand detainees. Furthermore, we shall help in hunting\r\ndown the perpetrators in order to bring them to justice\r\nfor the crimes they committed against those innocent,\r\ndefenceless victims.\r\nResponding to its national and legal obligations,\r\nKuwait joined the coalition forces in their endeavour to\r\nenforce Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.\r\nThus, we provided all possible facilities within the\r\nframework of that legal structure, which eventually led\r\nto Iraq’s salvation from an oppressive, tyrannical\r\nregime. Let me take this opportunity to say that we\r\nwelcome that regime’s removal from Iraq. We\r\ncongratulate the brotherly people of Iraq on their\r\nliberation, and we wish them prosperity in a secure and\r\nstable Iraq.\r\nIn addition, Kuwait welcomes the Security\r\nCouncil’s adoption of resolutions 1483 (2003) and\r\n1500 (2003), on Iraq. We also invite United Nations\r\nMember States to join the ongoing international efforts\r\nto restore security and stability to Iraq. That will help\r\nthe people of Iraq to rebuild their homeland and to re-\r\nestablish the political and constitutional institutions of\r\na national Government. In that regard, we emphasize\r\nthe central and significant role of the United Nations in\r\nthis political process.\r\nImmediately after the collapse of the former\r\nregime in Iraq, Kuwait reached out to the brotherly\r\npeople of Iraq with a wide array of humanitarian\r\nassistance. Our response came in the spirit of our\r\ncommon Arab and Islamic heritage. Kuwait rushed\r\nmaterial and financial aid to several local and\r\ninternational organizations, as well as to the United\r\nNations specialized agencies operating in Iraq. We also\r\ncontributed directly to the restoration of electrical\r\npower, health care, educational services and water\r\nsupplies to various areas in the country. In addition,\r\nKuwait set up a humanitarian operations centre to\r\nfacilitate and coordinate relief aid activities and\r\ninternational emergency relief efforts to deliver aid to\r\nIraq. Kuwait will continue its efforts to ensure the\r\ndelivery of all kinds of assistance, which we hope will\r\nalleviate the suffering of the brotherly people of Iraq.\r\nNow it is our fervent hope that Iraq will safely\r\ncross the dire straits through which it is passing and\r\nthat it will recover its security and stability and will\r\nsafeguard its independence and territorial integrity. All\r\nthat will enable the people of Iraq to recommit their\r\n31\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nresources and energies to their country’s reconstruction\r\nso that Iraq will reclaim its legitimate and natural\r\nstatus in the region and in the world. Indeed, we are\r\nfully confident that Iraq will overcome the challenges\r\nof this critical stage of its history, because it is\r\nendowed with enormous natural riches, a profound\r\ncultural heritage and skilled human resources.\r\nThe Government and people of Kuwait will stand\r\nwith Iraq at this stage and we look forward to enjoying\r\ngood, brotherly relations with a free and united Iraq.\r\nWe hope that our bilateral relations will be\r\ncharacterized by mutual trust, respect and good-\r\nneighbourliness, and governed by established treaties\r\nand United Nations resolutions. This will help us leave\r\nthe past behind and shift our focus onto building a\r\nbetter future that will contribute to enhancing security\r\nand stability in the region.\r\nSince the tragic events of 11 September 2001 that\r\nstruck the United States, the phenomenon of terrorism\r\nhas dominated the global agenda. Kuwait strongly\r\ncondemned those terrorist acts and all similar crimes\r\ncommitted in other countries. These are horrendous\r\nacts of terrorism that have created new realities on the\r\ninternational scene, including a universal conviction\r\nthat terrorism in its pernicious manifestations is\r\nactually an evil not exclusively associated with one\r\nnation, religion or culture. All of us also realize that\r\nthe fight against this evil is an international\r\nresponsibility to be borne by all Member States, not\r\njust one State or a certain group of States. Therefore,\r\nwe maintain that the United Nations remains the most\r\nappropriate forum for examining this issue and\r\ndeveloping the most effective means to combat and\r\neventually to stem it. To that end, the universal\r\nsignature, endorsement and enforcement by all Member\r\nStates of the 12 international agreements relating to\r\nterrorism would represent a real breakthrough in\r\nensuring the deployment of the most effective means to\r\ncontain and eliminate this pandemic.\r\nAs Kuwait firmly reiterates its categorical\r\nrejection of terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations, as well as its renunciation of all acts of\r\nviolence and extremism, it condemns the vicious\r\norchestrated campaign being waged against a sister\r\nState — the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia — by some\r\nAmerican media agencies. Instead, we commend Saudi\r\nArabia for its concrete and significant contributions to\r\nthe global campaign against terrorism, bearing in mind\r\nthe fact that Saudi Arabia itself has been the target of\r\nterrorists and has suffered as a result. Kuwait fully\r\nendorses all measures taken by the Saudi Government\r\nin its drive to eliminate terrorism and to consolidate\r\nregional security and stability.\r\nIn the same context, Kuwait will maintain its\r\nefforts, in coordination with the States of the region\r\nand the United Nations, to fight terrorism and to\r\nfurther strengthen the measures it has enforced in order\r\ncompletely to fulfil its international obligations,\r\nespecially those set forth in Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001).\r\nThirty-six years have passed since the oppressive\r\nIsraeli occupation of the land of the Palestinian people,\r\nwho continue to suffer an ongoing decline in their\r\neconomic and social living conditions as a result of\r\nIsrael’s policies and practices, which contravene\r\ninternational and humanitarian laws and norms. Kuwait\r\nis following with grave concern the recent escalation in\r\nthe occupied Palestinian territories. Despite the intense\r\ninternational efforts led by the Quartet, which yielded\r\nthe road map for the settlement of the conflict within a\r\nspecific time frame with a view to the attainment by\r\nthe Palestinian people of their legitimate political\r\nrights, Israel persists in its policy of backtracking on its\r\ncommitments. In fact, it deliberately undermines every\r\npromising initiative while paying no heed to the\r\npotential consequences of the perpetuation of the cycle\r\nof violence, rising tension and instability throughout\r\nthe region. Against this backdrop, the question of\r\ndeploying an international monitoring force to ensure\r\nscrupulous compliance with ceasefire arrangements is\r\nmore pressing than ever.\r\nWhile Kuwait renews its commitment to fully\r\nsupporting the struggle of the Palestinian people to\r\nattain all their full legitimate political rights, including\r\nthe establishment of their independent State on their\r\nnational territory, with Jerusalem as its capital, we\r\ndemand that the Israeli Government commit itself to\r\nimplementing the resolution adopted last Friday by the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its tenth emergency special\r\nsession and reverse its decision to remove the President\r\nof the Palestinian Authority. In the same context, we\r\ndemand that the Israeli Government fulfil its\r\nobligations and pledges set out in relevant United\r\nNations resolutions, primarily Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973); the land for\r\npeace formula; the bilateral accords signed with the\r\nPalestinian Authority in the context of the peace\r\n32\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nprocess; and the road map in all its provisions and\r\nrequirements.\r\nIn addition, Israel must abandon forthwith its\r\npolicies of isolating local communities and denying\r\nthem food supplies, incursions, destruction of physical\r\ninfrastructures, demolition of homes and arbitrary\r\nround-ups and arrests. Israel must also stop its\r\nconstruction of the separation wall and of settlements.\r\nIt should also release all Palestinian detainees. Recent\r\ndevelopments on the ground prove that these policies\r\nand practices will not fulfil Israel’s goals. Rather, they\r\nwill fuel the sentiments of hostility towards Israel.\r\nThey will also reinforce the sense of despair and\r\nundermine the Palestinians’ prospects for living in\r\nfreedom and dignity, thus forcing them to pursue the\r\ncourse of national struggle and resistance of\r\noccupation. Furthermore, Israel must ultimately\r\nwithdraw from all the Arab territories it occupied in\r\n1967 as a prerequisite for building the just, permanent\r\nand comprehensive peace for which we all yearn.\r\nAt the regional level, and in line with Kuwait’s\r\ncompliance with the principles of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, especially Article 2, which stresses the\r\nprinciple of peaceful settlement of disputes, we call on\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran and the United Arab\r\nEmirates to maintain their mutual visits and to deepen\r\nbilateral talks with a view to resolving their dispute\r\nover the three islands. It is our hope that the resolution\r\nof the current dispute will strengthen relations between\r\nthe two countries and the consolidation of security and\r\nstability in the region. In this regard, Kuwait, in its\r\nforthcoming chairmanship of the Gulf Cooperation\r\nCouncil, will spare no effort to strengthen all aspects of\r\npolitical, security and economic cooperation among the\r\nStates of the region. Furthermore, Kuwait, in\r\ncooperation and coordination with the United Nations\r\nand the regional players, will explore the activation and\r\ndevelopment of regional security arrangements with\r\ninterested countries of the region.\r\nToday’s world is different in many ways from the\r\nworld of several years ago. The trade and economic\r\nboundaries of States are rapidly disappearing. Cultural\r\ninteraction and relations among various societies is\r\nexpanding as a result of the immense achievements in\r\ninformation and communications technologies.\r\nHowever, such technologies have had some negative\r\nimplications that cannot be brushed aside. Thus, we are\r\nnow seeing an increasing marginalization of the\r\nmajority of the developing countries, whose economies\r\nnow suffer from a growing set of problems that\r\njeopardize their prospects for meaningful development.\r\nIn an attempt to face up to these challenges,\r\nwhich hamper world economic growth, a series of\r\nUnited Nations meetings were convened to address the\r\nimpediments to global economic growth. Thus, the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development, held in\r\nSouth Africa, and the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development, held in Mexico, developed\r\na framework of action for ensuring equity and fair\r\ninterdependence and cooperation between the North\r\nand the South. Also, specific guidelines and obligations\r\nwere set for all stakeholders to achieve a more\r\nequitable balance in economic relations. At this\r\njuncture, we would therefore call on the developed\r\nnations to meet their partnership obligations. These\r\ninclude, inter alia, adequate flows of financial and\r\ntechnical aid to the developing countries; the\r\nalleviation of the debt burden and cancellation of the\r\ndebts of the least developed countries; the removal of\r\ncustoms restrictions on flows of goods from the\r\ndeveloping countries into world markets; and an\r\nexchange of information and expertise that would help\r\ndeveloping countries to build and modernize their\r\nnational institutions.\r\nTo this end, Kuwait, for its part, reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to continue to provide development and\r\nfinancial assistance to developing countries. Our\r\nchannels will either include the United Nations\r\nprogrammes, funds, agencies and other multilateral\r\norganizations or the Kuwait Fund for Economic\r\nDevelopment, which has a sterling track record of\r\naiding and financing a wide range of development\r\nprojects and programmes in more than 100 developing\r\ncountries across the globe.\r\nAs we are still in the early years of a new century,\r\nit is our hope that all of us will draw the right lessons\r\nfrom our collective experiences of the past. Only\r\nthrough common action can humankind face the\r\nchallenges of the present in order to fashion a better\r\nfuture that offers future generations the hope of living\r\nin freedom and dignity.\r\nLet us join hands to fulfil our common vision of a\r\nlife in which law and order prevail — a life governed\r\nby the values and principles of freedom, justice and\r\nequality for all; a life that upholds the concept of\r\npartnership and cooperation as the shortest path to\r\nsecurity, stability and peace in the world.\r\n33\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber\r\nAl-Sabah, Prime Minister of Kuwait, was\r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency, Mr. Louis Michel, Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium.\r\nMr. Michel (Belgium) (spoke in French): I would\r\nlike at the outset to extend my sincerest congratulations\r\nto you, Sir, on your accession to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. It comes at a particularly difficult\r\ntime, which I might even describe as painful, in the\r\nhistory of our Organization.\r\nIndeed, the past year has gravely challenged the\r\ncapacities of the United Nations to manage the crisis in\r\nIraq to its conclusion, a country to which it was\r\naccountable. It saw the pre-eminent role for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security of this\r\ninstitution, symbol of multilateralism and stability,\r\ncalled into question.\r\nYet, it is not our institution’s intrinsic capacity\r\nthat is the cause of its powerlessness. It is essentially\r\nits Members’ lack of political determination. We\r\ncannot elude this vital debate for a peaceful, more\r\nharmonious and more just future indefinitely. Sooner or\r\nlater, we must answer the essential question: How can\r\nwe ensure that all Member States of the United Nations\r\nwill be prepared to accept the binding nature of\r\nSecurity Council endorsements of military action prior\r\nto engaging in it?\r\nTo make myself perfectly clear, and to avoid any\r\nmisunderstanding, the question that I ask is as follows:\r\nWhat reforms need to be made to the Organization’s\r\noperations to placate the often-understandable\r\napprehension or reticence of those who, because they\r\nassume specific political responsibilities, refuse to\r\nsubmit their geostrategic options to the rules of our\r\nOrganization? As long as we remain unable to answer\r\nthat question, we will continue to live in doubt and\r\nuncertainty, if not in helplessness. It is not a question\r\nof advocating an institutional shake-up of the\r\nOrganization; rather debate should enable us to\r\novercome the all-too-many misunderstandings that\r\nundermine the credibility of our shared instrument, and\r\nfrom which we can draw conclusions that will help us\r\nto make the Organization’s mechanisms more credible\r\nand up to date. The Security Council was founded on\r\nthe recognition of the particular responsibility and role\r\nof some of our Members, and I fully subscribe to it.\r\nBut should we not integrate new perspectives into this\r\nstate of affairs, such as the regional dimension, present\r\ngeopolitical facts and also new threats?\r\nThis is in no way meant to contest the specific\r\ninfluence of some of those involved in international\r\npeace and security management. Rather, our concerted\r\nsupport could help accompany, legitimize and\r\nstrengthen their approach and their effectiveness,\r\nthanks to the indisputably added value of multilateral\r\ndynamics. In many cases, this would avoid taking\r\nunnecessary risks and misunderstandings. In that\r\nregard, I think that, given its role as a global actor, the\r\nEuropean Union greatly deserves a permanent seat on\r\nthe Security Council on its own behalf.\r\nIt is this conviction that has inspired my country’s\r\nposition on the Iraq crisis. But now is not the time to\r\ndetermine who was right or who was wrong. All sides\r\nclearly had their reasons. One can only respect them\r\nfor it.\r\nBut it is now necessary to contribute to the re-\r\nestablishment of stability and ensure Iraq’s\r\nreconstruction. That is the responsibility of us all, for it\r\nconcerns a region neighbouring Europe, and we cannot\r\ntolerate, if only for the sake of our own security,\r\nincreased instability or the persistence of an\r\nuncontrolled spiral of violence that feeds resentment\r\ntowards the international community, which, as history\r\nhas taught us, constitutes the principal breeding ground\r\nfor terrorism.\r\nIt is thus necessary to stop the violence as quickly\r\nas possible. To this end, I share the opinion of the\r\nSecretary-General and of many among us. It is\r\nnecessary to restore as quickly as possible\r\nresponsibility for governing Iraq to the people of Iraq.\r\nThe return to sovereignty, under the watchful eye of the\r\nUnited Nations and of the international community as a\r\nwhole, is capable of providing the salutary shock\r\nneeded to reverse the current trend. We must convince\r\nthe Iraqi people that national union, the\r\nre-establishment of State authority and economic\r\nrecovery are accessible and at hand. This of course\r\ndoes not imply that the international community should\r\ndemobilize. A strong military force in Iraq will still be\r\nnecessary for some time to guarantee stability. It is of\r\ncourse up to the United States to assume its\r\nmanagement. But from now on this presence must not\r\nbe regarded as designed to occupy the country, but\r\nrather as a way to assist in the reconstruction process\r\n34\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nfor the sake of the Iraqi people. The Security Council\r\nresolution that is currently under discussion must\r\ncreate this prospect so as to insure broad participation\r\nby the international community.\r\nThe United Nations has a central role to play in\r\naccompanying the political reconstruction process in\r\nIraq, even if the tragic events of August have shown\r\nhow risky and vulnerable that process is. However,\r\nsuch a role requires a clear mandate and sufficient\r\nmeans.\r\nI wish to renew my sincerest condolences to the\r\nSecretary-General, to the bereaved families and to\r\ncolleagues, and express my high regard and admiration\r\nfor all the United Nations staff members for their\r\ninvolvement, their selflessness and the sacrifices that\r\nthey accept so steadfastly.\r\nThe principal security threat is the uncontrollable\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their\r\npotential use by some States in breach of minimal\r\nethical standards or by certain terrorist movements.\r\nThat threat is serious. We must each confront the threat\r\ntogether, by shouldering our fair share of the actions\r\nundertaken.\r\nThe European Union and its member States\r\ncurrently possess an essential document which deals\r\nwith the European security strategy. It should enable\r\nus, as Javier Solana quite recently reminded us in\r\nBrussels, to plot a European chart of the challenges\r\nfacing this world to better guarantee the effectiveness\r\nof our collective security system. Belgium will actively\r\nparticipate in this endeavour.\r\nFurthermore, we fully share the international\r\ncommunity’s concerns about the nuclear programme of\r\nNorth Korea. We strongly call upon North Korea to\r\nabide by its previous international commitments. We\r\nare grateful to China for having offered a useful format\r\nfor discussion in this respect.\r\nAs for Iran, I trust that through a sustained and\r\nconstructive dialogue it will meet the expectations of\r\nthe international community and respond to the\r\nrequests of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\r\nBelgium will continue to participate in a\r\ndetermined and proactive way in the international\r\nefforts that were initiated two years ago to track down\r\nterrorism. In Belgium, there is no sanctuary for\r\nterrorism, nor will there ever be. Nevertheless, the fight\r\nagainst terrorism should not be used as an abusive\r\njustification for actions that would undermine the\r\ndemocratic quality and the sacred principles of the rule\r\nof law.\r\nFurthermore, I am not one of those who believe\r\nthat the military option is the exclusive answer,\r\nalthough obviously it should not be excluded. Much\r\nmore fundamentally, we need to systematically attack\r\nthe root causes of a phenomenon that is often rooted in\r\nthe feeling of powerlessness or in feelings of real or\r\nperceived injustice.\r\nFor this reason, Belgium will also continue to\r\nsupport, together with its European partners, the action\r\nof the Quartet for the re-establishment of peace\r\nbetween Israel and the Palestinian Authority. To\r\nachieve that goal, it is necessary that Palestinians\r\ndecide unambiguously to renounce the toleration of\r\nblind violence and that Israel, in the same spirit, stop\r\nfavouring the use of force.\r\nOne has the impression that, as difficulties pile\r\nup, we have fallen back into the traps of Oslo: a\r\ngradualism of small steps and a too-pronounced\r\nreliance on sequencing. The road map prescribes\r\nparallel advances on the security, political and\r\neconomic paths. From each side, we need to obtain\r\nbolder measures and the acceptance of the risks these\r\nimply. There is no alternative to the road map. It has\r\nnot yet been implemented seriously. We believe it is\r\nparticularly urgent to create a credible, on-site\r\nverification mechanism.\r\nIt is in Africa, particularly in Central Africa, that\r\nmy country commits itself in the most determined way\r\nto the restoration of peace and stability. We are\r\nencouraged by the successful installation of a\r\ntransitional Government in Kinshasa that now brings\r\ntogether all the parties. Now, State structures have to\r\nbe restored and good governance has to be introduced\r\nin order to allow for the return of foreign aid and\r\ninvestment. The persisting violence in the east of the\r\ncountry must end.\r\nIn this context, I wish to mention the remarkable\r\nefforts by the United Nations Organization Mission in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC). I\r\nam particularly happy about the success of Operation\r\nArtemis. Apart from restoring security in Bunia, this\r\noperation has given MONUC the thrust it needed to be\r\nable to face up to the challenges of its new mandate.\r\n35\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nNow, priority must be given to the preparation of\r\nelections in order to grant the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo a new start on a solid basis and to\r\nconsolidate its restored territorial integrity. Belgium\r\nwill be present at all levels and in every phase of this\r\nprocess. But I wish to insist on the fact that the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo needs the\r\ndetermined commitment of all the instruments of our\r\ncommunity. It would be unforgivable not to forge, here\r\nand now, the conditions for a complete stabilization of\r\nthe entire region.\r\nWe also need to help Rwanda to continue its\r\nnational reconciliation efforts, which are indispensable\r\nin order to guarantee sustainable stability in that fragile\r\ncountry. I am convinced the recent elections will\r\ncontribute to this goal.\r\nAs for Burundi, the implementation of the Arusha\r\nAgreements must continue, and the rebels have to be\r\nconvinced that they should join this process. My\r\ncountry looks forward to participating actively in the\r\nnew action on Burundi decided by the Economic and\r\nSocial Council. We hope that will help Burundi to\r\nbreak through its isolation within the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nFinally, my country closely follows the efforts by\r\nthe United Nations to reactivate the project for a Great\r\nLakes conference, which should seal the re-\r\nestablishment of peaceful relations and the\r\ndevelopment of cross-border cooperation among the\r\ncountries of the region.\r\nThe credibility of the United Nations does not\r\ndepend only on its willingness and capacity to manage\r\ncrises. It also depends on its capacity to respond to the\r\nexpectations of men, women and children all over the\r\nworld, who are directly or indirectly confronted with\r\nimbalances and injustice whose causes and solutions\r\nboth are found only at the global level. It is essential to\r\nmaster globalization, develop the promises it offers and\r\ncorrect its excesses.\r\nIt is clear that, in accordance with the analysis of\r\nthe Secretary-General, this challenge requires\r\nfundamental reflection on the architecture of the major\r\ninstruments of development. That demands openness of\r\nmind and should not exclude any option from the start.\r\nHas not the time come to reinforce the capacity of the\r\nUnited Nations to act effectively in this field? I wish to\r\nrepeat a question that I raised at the World Trade\r\nOrganization Ministerial Conference in Cancún.\r\nShould we not, for example, create a real Economic\r\nand Social Security Council, which would derive its\r\nlegitimacy and efficiency from law and which would\r\nhave the same power in the management of economic,\r\nsocial and environmental policies as the Security\r\nCouncil has on issues of peace? That is my conviction,\r\nespecially since those fields form the requisite\r\nbackdrop to achieving stability and security.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council needs to be\r\nreformed to give it a more decisive operational role in\r\nthe control of a world organization based on universal\r\nprinciples of equity. This goal should lead to broad and\r\nbalanced synergies between international organizations\r\nsuch as the World Bank, the International Monetary\r\nFund, the World Trade Organization and the\r\nInternational Labour Organization, which should really\r\nbecome instruments of the same project.\r\nThe founding principles of such a concept exist\r\nalready and are being applied in certain countries, such\r\nas in mine. I am referring more specifically to\r\nfundamental labour standards such as the freedom of\r\nunions, the prohibition of child labour and forced\r\nlabour and the right to quality employment, as well as\r\nenvironmental obligations, which are vital for\r\nsustainable development. I am also thinking of the need\r\nto exclude services of general interest from the market\r\nsphere.\r\nTo conclude, it seems to me that such an ambition\r\nwould opportunely translate the tremendous hope\r\ngenerated by the Millennium Summit. The Millennium\r\nDeclaration clearly defined the goals at our level. I am\r\npleased with the decision of the General Assembly to\r\nmake the five-year review of the Millennium Summit\r\nin 2005 into an important event, which I think should\r\nbe a summit of heads of State and Government. That\r\nsummit should assess the implementation not only of\r\nthe Millennium Goals, but also of the goals of all the\r\nmajor United Nations conferences.\r\nBut the success of that summit implies going\r\nfurther. It should at last boldly lay the foundation for a\r\nworld in which inequalities between poor and rich\r\ncountries can be filled in a sustainable way. It should\r\nnourish, in an irreversible way, the indispensable\r\nconfidence the world needs to be safer, more human\r\nand more brotherly.\r\n36\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nAddress by Mr. José María Aznar, President of\r\nthe Government of the Kingdom of Spain\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will hear\r\nan address by the President of the Government of the\r\nKingdom of Spain.\r\nMr. José María Aznar, President of the\r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Spain, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. José María Aznar,\r\nPresident of the Government of the Kingdom of Spain,\r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Aznar (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): It is\r\nalways a special opportunity for the leader of his\r\ncountry to speak to this General Assembly. My speech\r\nwill be brief and may be summed up at the very outset\r\nin very few words as follows: I am speaking to you as\r\nthe President of a European democratic country\r\ninvolved in sustainable development. My compatriots\r\nespecially value the existence of freedom and respect\r\nfor the law as factors for progress in Spain. We think\r\nthese two values, freedom in all areas of life and\r\ncompliance with the law comprise the best recipe for\r\nprogress among peoples.\r\nThe last twenty-five years of progress in my\r\ncountry have fortunately coincided with the change in\r\nthe millennium. Freedom of opinion, peaceful political\r\nchoice and the broadening of fundamental rights have\r\nbecome values which enhance us. Of course, this has\r\nnot been accomplished without effort and risks along\r\nthe way. However, I now have the satisfaction of\r\nspeaking of that progress. The culture of community\r\nupon which this democracy is based is openly\r\nexpressed by the Spanish people of the Iberian\r\nPeninsula and we are celebrating this during the\r\ncommemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of our\r\nConstitution. We are an open country, trusted\r\nthroughout the world, and we wish the same principles\r\nand situation for others. The determination to increase\r\nfreedom throughout the world and the concern to\r\nensure that laws of the international community are\r\ncomplied with are values that guide our international\r\npolicies. We share this position with many countries\r\npresent here.\r\nThe world would be a better place if the rules we\r\nmake for ourselves are complied with and if those who\r\nbreach them know that their non-compliance will not\r\nprevail. The United Nations embodies international\r\nlegality. Compliance with its resolutions is in the\r\ninterest of all. This is the best way to build a world in\r\nkeeping with law rather than tyranny, with freedom\r\nrather than oppression.\r\nIt is probably for this purpose that the Security\r\nCouncil and the Organization require reform. Without\r\ndoubt, this is a complex issue and we support efforts\r\nbeing made in this connection by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. In any case, we bear in mind that increasing\r\nthe number of Security Council Members will not\r\nnecessarily increase the effectiveness of the Council.\r\nBut above all, the United Nations needs its own\r\nMembers to respect its resolutions. A resolute effort on\r\nthe part of all countries is necessary to ensure a more\r\nsecure, yet freer world.\r\nAlthough violations of Security Council\r\nresolutions exist, all of us must ensure that the\r\nresolutions are complied with. All of us must lend a\r\nhand because it is in the interest of all for the ideals of\r\nthe United Nations to become a reality. Thus, we are\r\ncommitted to security, stability and the reconstruction\r\nof Iraq. We also are committed to returning sovereignty\r\nto the Iraqi people. We spare no effort and do not wish\r\nto dwell on the past. We believe that successful results\r\nin Iraq will be due to the efforts of the entire\r\ninternational community. We think that the pledging\r\nconference to be held in Spain on 23 and 24 October\r\nwill be a big stride. I would like, from this rostrum, to\r\ninvite all of you to participate in that conference.\r\nAllow me to present some more concrete ideas.\r\nOur efforts must be directed towards restoring the\r\nsovereignty of the Iraqi people in a way which will\r\nenable them to freely enjoy their own resources. For\r\nthat purpose there should be an agreement reached to\r\nestablish a multinational force with the clear mandate\r\nof guaranteeing peace and security. Given the situation\r\ntoday in Iraq with its high risk of terrorism, this task\r\ncannot be entrusted to a mere interposed force, but\r\nrather to one that will specifically ensure peace,\r\nsecurity and stability.\r\nAn additional agreement on the civil\r\nadministration of Iraqi resources and public services\r\nfor the people would be easier to obtain after that. I am\r\nreferring to a civil administration directed by the\r\nUnited Nations with the participation of the new\r\nleaders who would be representing a peaceful and\r\npluralistic Iraq.\r\n37\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nPeace, security and freedom have always had\r\nenemies and we cannot close our eyes where such\r\nthreats exist. We have been the victims of blind\r\nterrorist violence in this Organization. We cannot\r\nforget that vile and cowardly attack in Iraq by which\r\nterrorists hoped to expel the United Nations from Iraq\r\nand close it off from the world. The States who flout\r\ninternational law are threatening what is dearest to us,\r\nour lives and our freedom.\r\nProliferation of weapons of mass destruction\r\nwould be even more dangerous. I firmly believe that\r\ncommitment and true cooperation between all States\r\nwill make it possible to win victory over terror. Last\r\nMay, Members of the Security Council shared some\r\nconsiderations concerning the fight against terrorism to\r\nwhich I refer now. We will continue to work on\r\npreparing a list of terrorist organizations — things\r\nshould be called by their proper names — and there\r\nshould be no political or moral quarter given to\r\nassassins. Our priorities must be set. We will shut down\r\nthe sources of financial support to terrorists and will\r\nprevent their access to weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe treaties on disarmament with regard to nuclear,\r\nchemical and biological weapons will help with this\r\ntask. To prevent and intercept the trafficking of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, a group of countries has\r\nimplemented the Proliferation Security Initiative whose\r\nfirst meeting took place in Madrid last June. I invite\r\nyou also to join that Initiative.\r\nWe would like to give a voice to the victims of\r\nterrorism and for this, three things are required. We\r\nmust restore truth, regain dignity and pay tribute to the\r\nvictims of terrorism. If terrorists have sometimes used\r\npublic tribunals, it is a moral necessity to give an\r\ninstitutional forum to the victims where they can be\r\nheard. We must unmask the terrorists and truly listen to\r\nthe victims.\r\nIt has been rightly said, Sir, that the United\r\nNations has not been established to create paradise in\r\nthe world, but rather to keep the world from falling into\r\nan abyss. There is no paradise on earth. Efforts are\r\nbeing made to ensure that the world will be freer and\r\nmore peaceful and to distance us from the abyss,\r\nefforts which make it possible for this Organization to\r\nmake its lofty ideas a reality. It is hoped that no effort\r\nwill be spared in this undertaking.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Spain for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. José María Aznar, President of the\r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Spain, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Yoriko Kawaguchi, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Japan.\r\nMs. Kawaguchi (Japan): I would like to extend\r\nmy heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Julian Robert\r\nHunte, Foreign Minister of Saint Lucia, on his\r\nassumption of the office of President for the fifty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly. I would also\r\nlike to commend Mr. Jan Kavan, former Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and former Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nCzech Republic, for his devoted efforts during his\r\ntenure as President of the fifty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nFirst of all, I would like to touch upon the terrible\r\ntragedy that occurred last month. Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General Mr. Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello and other United Nations staff,\r\nworking diligently to facilitate the reconstruction and\r\nstabilization of Iraq, sacrificed their lives as a result of\r\nthe cowardly bomb attack in Baghdad. On behalf of the\r\nGovernment of Japan, I take this opportunity to pay\r\ntribute to Mr. Vieira de Mello and his colleagues.\r\nMuch of our time and energy since the general\r\ndebate last year have gone into the discussion of the\r\nIraq situation. In that process, questions have been\r\nasked about the role of the Security Council and the\r\nUnited Nations with respect to the Organization’s\r\nprimary role of maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity. On the occasion of this general debate, we\r\nonce again need to earnestly explore the meaning of\r\nthis matter.\r\nThere is no organization on earth more universal\r\nthan the United Nations. No other organization\r\naddresses so many diverse issues as comprehensively\r\nas it does. I strongly believe that the United Nations\r\nwill continue to play an important role that no other\r\ninternational organization can fulfil. The United\r\nNations role should be enhanced through reform in\r\norder to restore the confidence that was shaken in the\r\nIraq situation. All Member States are called upon in\r\nour joint effort to strengthen the Organization.\r\n38\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nToday, we face a situation in which the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the\r\nthreat of terrorism affect not only particular countries\r\nor regions but the world as a whole, presenting a new\r\nthreat to our lives and our livelihood. It is imperative\r\nfor each country to regard the issue as its own and to\r\ntake action in concert with the countries facing such\r\nimminent threats.\r\nIn order to establish an Iraqi Government run by\r\nthe Iraqis themselves as soon as possible, the\r\ninternational community must join hands for securing\r\npeace and promoting reconstruction, and the United\r\nNations must play an even more prominent role in\r\nthose efforts. Japan strongly expects that a new\r\nSecurity Council resolution will be adopted, that the\r\npath towards Iraqi self-governance will be clarified and\r\nthat the international partnership will be strengthened\r\nto promote reconstruction and security. Together with\r\nthe international community, Japan continues to make\r\nevery effort towards the restoration of security and the\r\nreconstruction of Iraq and in particular towards the\r\nsuccessful conclusion of the Madrid donors conference\r\nfor the reconstruction of Iraq to be held next month.\r\nWith respect to peace in the Middle East, I am\r\ndeeply concerned that the road map has reached a\r\ncritical stage. I call upon both sides to exercise the\r\nutmost restraint in order to restore calm on the ground.\r\nThe Palestinian Authority must resolutely disavow the\r\nuse of terror, work expeditiously to establish a new\r\ncabinet and take action to control the extremist\r\nfactions. Israel, in turn, must act with prudence and\r\ncaution, mindful of the consequences of its own\r\nactions. In particular, the expulsion of Chairman Yasser\r\nArafat can only result in a deterioration of the\r\nsituation. Japan once again urges Israel not to proceed\r\nwith the implementation of measures which would\r\nresult in Chairman Arafat’s removal.\r\nFrom the perspectives of peace and security in\r\nNorth-East Asia and international non-proliferation, the\r\ndevelopment and possession of nuclear weapons by\r\nNorth Korea must never be tolerated. Japan once again\r\nurges North Korea to immediately and completely\r\ndismantle all of its nuclear development programmes in\r\na verifiable and irreversible manner. This issue should\r\nbe resolved peacefully by diplomatic efforts including\r\nthe six-party talks process. Based on the Pyongyang\r\nDeclaration between Japan and North Korea, Japan\r\nseeks the resolution of various outstanding issues\r\nbetween Japan and North Korea, including the nuclear\r\nissue, the missile issue and the abduction issue, which\r\nwas addressed explicitly by the Assembly last\r\nDecember in its resolution on the question of enforced\r\nor involuntary disappearances (57/215). Upon the\r\ncomprehensive resolution of those issues, Japan is\r\nlooking to effect the normalization of its diplomatic\r\nrelations with North Korea.\r\nWith regard to Iran, Japan calls upon Iran to take\r\nseriously the resolution adopted at the 12 September\r\nmeeting of the Board of Governors of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Iran must appease the\r\nconcerns of the international community regarding the\r\nnuclear issue. It must comply immediately with all\r\nmeasures prescribed in the resolution, which include\r\ncooperating fully with IAEA to rectify problem points\r\nby the end of October of this year. Iran must also ratify\r\nthe IAEA Additional Protocol immediately and\r\nunconditionally and implement it in its entirety.\r\nThe very urgency of those issues reminds us of\r\nthe importance of the crossroads at which we now\r\nstand with respect to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation\r\nTreaty regime. The horror and devastation caused by\r\nnuclear weapons should not be repeated. Japan is\r\nredoubling its efforts to maintain and fortify the\r\nnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime,\r\nwith this treaty as its core. At the fifty-eighth session\r\nof the General Assembly, Japan will submit a draft\r\nresolution entitled “Path to the total elimination of\r\nnuclear weapons” and aim to secure adoption of the\r\nresolution by an overwhelming majority of Member\r\nStates. Furthermore, Japan considers the early entry-\r\ninto-force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty to be of extreme importance as a concrete means\r\nof strengthening the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\r\nregime.\r\nDespite the serious efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to combat terrorism in the wake of the\r\nterrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, precious lives\r\ncontinue to be lost by terrorist attacks in Jakarta,\r\nBaghdad and many other locations around the globe.\r\nInsofar as improvements in the terrorism-related\r\nresponse capabilities of all nations are required for the\r\neradication of international terrorist organizations,\r\nJapan continues to provide capacity-building assistance\r\nto developing countries, with special emphasis on\r\nAsian countries. In addition, Japan calls upon all\r\nMember States to work to bring about the early\r\nconclusion of the counter-terrorism conventions as well\r\nas the implementation of Security Council resolution\r\n39\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\n1373 (2001) in order to deprive terrorists of the means\r\nfor their activities and safe havens.\r\nIn the twenty-first century, we cannot address the\r\ndangers and threats now confronting the world with\r\nmilitary and political measures alone.\r\nOur responses must be well thought out, detailed\r\nand sustained, addressing every facet of the issues we\r\nface, including the social aspect, humanitarian and\r\nhuman rights concerns, and the question of economic\r\nreconstruction. Furthermore, we must strive to\r\nguarantee human rights, democracy and good\r\ngovernance by creating a social environment that\r\nenables each and every human being to realize his or\r\nher maximum potential.\r\nOn the basis of this realization, Japan has made\r\nthe consolidation of peace and nation-building one of\r\nthe pillars of its diplomacy and its international\r\ncooperation efforts, and it is contributing actively in a\r\nvariety of areas, including peacekeeping operations.\r\nMoreover, in the conceptual framework of human\r\nsecurity, Japan has made efforts to enhance both\r\nprotection and capacity at the individual, human level.\r\nJapan will continue to work for the realization of the\r\nrecommendations made in the report submitted by the\r\nCommission on Human Security in cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations, Member States and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, through diplomatic\r\nmeasures such as official development assistance.\r\nSpecific examples of Japan’s efforts include\r\nassistance in nation-building, such as the deployment\r\nof Japan’s Self-Defence Forces in Timor-Leste; the\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration\r\nprogramme it is now implementing jointly with the\r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan; and\r\nsupport for the peace process and for reconstruction\r\nand development in the form of efforts such as the\r\nTokyo Conference on Reconstruction and Development\r\nof Sri Lanka.\r\nMeasures against infectious diseases are also\r\ncrucial in ensuring human security. The example of\r\nSARS demonstrated to the world yet again the\r\nimportance of international cooperation in the\r\nmitigation of such diseases. Japan welcomes the results\r\nof yesterday’s General Assembly High-level Meeting\r\non HIV/AIDS, which reconfirmed both the\r\ncommitment of every nation to the goals set forth in the\r\nPolitical Declaration and the importance of the Global\r\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\r\nWith regard to Africa, Japan has been cooperating\r\nfor its development on the basis of the principles of\r\nownership and partnership, aiming at poverty\r\neradication through economic growth, as well as\r\nproviding assistance in conflict prevention in order to\r\nsecure the peace and political stability which are\r\nprerequisites to development. The Tokyo International\r\nConference on African Development (TICAD) process\r\nis now in its 10th year. TICAD III will convene on 29\r\nSeptember. In response to the ownership of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD),\r\nTICAD III intends to expand partnerships with\r\ninternational organizations and the countries\r\nconcerned, and particularly with civil society and\r\nAsian countries which have successfully realized\r\ndevelopment, in order to share the wisdom and\r\nexperiences of the international community in the area\r\nof African development.\r\nAs the representative of an Asian country, I\r\nwould like to take this opportunity to highlight two\r\nissues that relate to peace and security in the Asian\r\nregion.\r\nThe first is the detention of Daw Aung San Suu\r\nKyi by the Government of Myanmar. Japan is\r\ncontinuing to make serious diplomatic efforts to bring\r\nabout the expeditious resolution of this worrisome\r\nsituation and to facilitate concrete progress towards\r\nnational reconciliation and democratization.\r\nThe second issue concerns the Khmer Rouge\r\ntrials in Cambodia. Japan believes that it is necessary\r\nfor each country to extend considerable cooperation in\r\norder to ensure that these trials take place and that they\r\nexhibit an unswerving application of the principles of\r\nlaw and justice of the international community.\r\nIn the community of nations, diversity is both\r\nrespected and cherished. For that reason, the\r\nformulation of a set of common rules under which the\r\nentire global community can act as one is of extreme\r\nimportance. The United Nations has made significant\r\nprogress in this area to date. I would like to explain\r\nsome of the agenda items which Japan will be pursuing\r\nat the United Nations, here in the General Assembly\r\nand elsewhere, in order to formulate such rules. Such\r\nrules will constitute the basis for well-thought-out,\r\ndetailed and sustained responses to a broad spectrum of\r\nissues, including socio-economic, environmental and\r\nhuman rights issues.\r\n40\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nIn the field of the environment, it is imperative\r\nthat the international momentum for climate change\r\nnegotiations be maintained. I appeal to the\r\nrepresentatives of all nations who are gathered here to\r\nrecognize the importance of the early entry into force\r\nof the Kyoto Protocol and of the formulation of\r\ncommon rules which will facilitate participation by all\r\ncountries, including the United States of America and\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe protection and promotion of the rights of\r\ndisabled persons is also of great importance. Japan\r\nwelcomes the decision taken in June of this year to\r\nestablish a working committee which will draft an\r\ninternational convention on the promotion and\r\nprotection of the rights of persons with disabilities;\r\nJapan will actively participate in this process.\r\nWith regard to the United Nations Decade of\r\nEducation for Sustainable Development, Japan looks\r\nforward to the adoption of a resolution promoting the\r\ncreation of an implementation plan in which the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) serves as the lead agency.\r\nDisaster prevention is an indispensable element\r\nfor a safer world in the twenty-first century, not merely\r\nbecause of its role in the follow-up to the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, but also as an\r\nessential prerequisite for achieving much of the\r\nsustainable development agenda. Japan proposes to\r\nhost the World Conference on Natural Disaster\r\nReduction in order to develop new strategies on\r\ndisaster prevention.\r\nFor the United Nations to fulfil the role of\r\nbringing about a world of peace and prosperity based\r\non common rules embraced by the entire international\r\ncommunity, the reform of the United Nations,\r\nparticularly that of the Security Council, as its core,\r\nmust be urgently addressed.\r\nToday’s conflicts have become more diversified\r\nand increasingly complex, as evidenced in cases where\r\na civil war escalates due to the dysfunctional condition\r\nof a State. To respond to these new challenges, the\r\nSecurity Council has taken on new tasks, such as the\r\ndeployment of multinational forces, when necessary, to\r\nrestore order. Such tasks also include the expansion of\r\nthe role of peacekeeping activities from military and\r\npolice activities such as ceasefire monitoring to\r\nhumanitarian activities, including assistance for the\r\nrepatriation of refugees, as well as assistance for\r\ndemocratic elections and reconstruction efforts. The\r\nSecurity Council must take on a variety of these tasks\r\nin working for the resolution of today’s conflicts.\r\nFor the Security Council to address these\r\nchallenges comprehensively, there is a need to\r\nstrengthen the functioning of the Council by including\r\ncountries that are both willing and able to shoulder\r\nresponsibilities at the global level as permanent\r\nmembers. Japan continues to work diligently for the\r\nrealization of Security Council reform and would like\r\nto assume greater responsibility as a permanent\r\nmember in a reformed Council.\r\nThe issues about which I am speaking today are\r\nhardly new. Discussions on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil have been under way for 10 years now. Yet,\r\ndespite a series of exhaustive discussions about how\r\nthe Council should be reformed, we are still unable to\r\nsee progress in any concrete terms.\r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that, if we continue\r\nalong this path, the ability of the United Nations to\r\nrespond adequately to new and complex challenges\r\nwill be seriously brought into question. We must take\r\nconcrete action now. The Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, makes a strong case for United Nations reform\r\nin his report (A/58/323) entitled, “Implementation of\r\nthe United Nations Millennium Declaration”. He\r\nproposes that we set 2005 as a deadline for reaching\r\nagreement on the changes that are needed in our\r\ninternational institutions if we are to meet the new\r\nchallenges, because 2005 not only marks the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations but\r\nis also the year in which a review of progress on the\r\nMillennium Declaration will take place. I am of the\r\nview that a political decision should be taken on the\r\noccasion of that review at a meeting of heads of State\r\nor Government regarding the reform of the United\r\nNations, in particular the Security Council.\r\nWith regard to the “enemy State” clauses in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, a General Assembly resolution\r\nwas adopted in 1995, recognizing them to be obsolete.\r\nThose clauses have not yet, however, been deleted\r\nfrom the Charter. This is an extremely regrettable\r\nsituation. Japan will work to find appropriate solutions\r\nto this issue, in view of the progress on United Nations\r\nreform.\r\nAdministrative and budgetary reform of the\r\nUnited Nations is also necessary in order to increase\r\nboth its effectiveness and its efficiency. With regard to\r\n41\r\nA/58/PV.8\r\nthe size of the United Nations budget, it is necessary to\r\ngive careful consideration to the financial burden on\r\nMember States. Japan calls on the United Nations both\r\nto conduct a strict prioritization of its activities and to\r\neliminate those activities which are neither essential\r\nnor urgent. We must also consider appropriate methods\r\nto make the scale of assessments for all Member States\r\nmore balanced. Finally, equitable geographical\r\ndistribution among Member States for the number of\r\nstaff members of the Secretariat has yet to be attained.\r\nThe present situation is of concern and needs to be\r\nimproved.\r\nJapan believes that international peace and\r\nprosperity can be achieved only through cooperation\r\namong nations, with the United Nations playing an\r\nimportant role. Japan has used all means at its disposal\r\nto contribute to United Nations activities, so that the\r\nobjectives contained in the United Nations Charter may\r\nultimately be realized. Let me make it clear that Japan\r\nwill continue to be actively engaged in United Nations\r\nactivities. However, the perpetuation of the same basic\r\nSecurity Council structure of 60 years ago leads many\r\nto question the legitimacy of the system under which\r\nthe United Nations operates. The legitimacy of the\r\nUnited Nations is at stake.\r\nIn closing, I would like once again to urge all\r\nMember States to take concrete actions to strengthen\r\nthe functions of this Organization and restore its\r\nlegitimacy in the eyes of the nations and citizens of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate for this meeting.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.25 p.m.\r\n"
