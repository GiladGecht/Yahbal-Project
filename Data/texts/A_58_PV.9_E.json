"United Nations A/58/PV.9\r\n \r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nFifty-eighth session\r\n9th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 24 September 2003, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of\r\nspeeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original\r\nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature\r\nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room\r\nC-154A. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n03-53005 (E)\r\n*0353005*\r\nPresident: The Hon. Julian R. Hunte. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nThe President: I need to get the cooperation and\r\nsupport of delegations, and not only with regard to\r\nstarting the meeting on time. I have observed that while\r\nspeakers are at the rostrum, a lot of discussion takes\r\nplace that causes some disturbance. The old saying that\r\nurges you to do unto others as you would like them to\r\ndo unto you is pertinent: when you are at the rostrum,\r\nyou would not want discussion to be taking place in the\r\nform of a sidebar. I would therefore be really grateful if\r\nsome attention could be paid to this matter.\r\nIn addition, I would appreciate it if, at the\r\nconclusion of a speaker’s presentation, there would be\r\na little order in leaving the Hall without making it\r\ndifficult for the next speaker to get the attention of the\r\nHall. People have travelled great distances to be here,\r\nand we owe them the courtesy of listening to them in\r\nsilence and paying some attention to what they have to\r\nsay. I really wish to thank you in anticipation for your\r\ncooperation and support in this matter.\r\nAddress by Mr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President\r\nof the Republic of Mozambique\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of\r\nMozambique.\r\nMr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President of the\r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Mozambique, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Chissano: Allow me, at the outset, to\r\njoin previous speakers in congratulating you, Sir, on\r\nyour election as President of the fifty-eighth session of\r\nthe General Assembly. We would also like to commend\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for the manner in\r\nwhich he guided the proceedings of the Assembly\r\nduring the previous session. I would likewise like to\r\ncommend the Secretary-General for his relentless\r\nefforts to turn the United Nations into an effective\r\ninstrument for international cooperation in the search\r\nfor, and the preservation of, peace and security.\r\nThe United Nations family has recently lost some\r\nof its best servants. We mourn, in particular, the tragic\r\ndeath of Sergio Vieira de Mello, a dedicated servant of\r\nour Organization. We would like to reiterate our\r\ndeepest condolences to the United Nations, the\r\nGovernment of Brazil and Sergio’s family.\r\nWe also mourn the passing away of Anna Lindh,\r\nSweden’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was an\r\noutstanding diplomat and defender of the United\r\nNations. Her departure is a major loss for humankind,\r\nas she fought for a world order in which every nation\r\ncould live in peace, harmony and prosperity. We wish\r\nto reiterate our heartfelt condolences to the people and\r\nGovernment of Sweden, as well as to her bereaved\r\nfamily.\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nI have come to this session of the General\r\nAssembly as a messenger of the peoples of\r\nMozambique, and of Africa as a whole — a messenger\r\nof peoples who are engaged in consolidating political,\r\neconomic and social reforms. Today more than ever\r\nbefore, the peoples of Africa believe in the strength of\r\ntheir will, cohesion and unity. They believe in realizing\r\nthe potential of their human and natural resources and\r\ncapacities. They believe in learning from past\r\nexperiences, good and bad, to restore peace and\r\nstability and to generate wealth and prosperity\r\nthroughout the continent. The peoples of Africa are\r\nemulating the experiences of countries like my own,\r\nMozambique, where after years of armed conflict a\r\nnew era of peace and gradual, but steady, development\r\nhas been taking place during the past 11 years. During\r\nthose 11 years, we have made continuous progress in\r\nconsolidating peace and democracy. We are now\r\nengaged in the process of preparing for our second\r\nmunicipal elections, which will be held on 19\r\nNovember 2003. In 2004 Mozambique will hold its\r\nthird general and multiparty elections to elect the\r\nPresident as well as members of Parliament. The peace\r\nand socio-economic stability that prevail in our country\r\nhave created an enabling environment for domestic and\r\nforeign investment, which are pivotal for the\r\ngeneration of employment and for the reduction of\r\npoverty.\r\nThe gross domestic product of Mozambique’s\r\neconomy grew at an encouraging rate of 7.7 per cent\r\nlast year, which has resulted in increased social-service\r\nallocations in the national budget. That is all the more\r\nimportant given the fact that Mozambique, like many\r\nother countries in southern Africa, is still facing a\r\nhumanitarian crisis that is the result of continuing\r\nunfavourable weather patterns that have stricken the\r\nentire region for several years. We urge the\r\ninternational community to respond favourably to the\r\nrecently launched appeal for humanitarian assistance\r\nfor southern Africa.\r\nAs part of its efforts to fight poverty, the\r\nGovernment is implementing a plan of action for the\r\neradication of absolute poverty, which aims to maintain\r\nthe current average economic growth rate of 8 per cent\r\nand to reduce absolute poverty to below 50 per cent by\r\n2010. With the objective of creating a national vision\r\nfor development in the next 25 years, the Government\r\nof Mozambique has launched its Agenda 2025, a\r\nnational strategy for the future of the country based on\r\na constructive dialogue with all political parties and\r\nstakeholders.\r\nLast July, Mozambique had the honour of hosting\r\nthe Second Assembly of the Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the African Union. During that\r\nAssembly, we took important decisions that laid down\r\nthe foundations of the African Union and that will\r\ncontribute to the effective implementation of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). As\r\nexpressed in the Maputo Declaration, the commitment\r\nand political will of African countries to take effective\r\nand concrete measures towards the implementation of\r\nNEPAD reflects the recognition of the fact that the\r\nprimary responsibility for the implementation of that\r\ninitiative rests with the peoples and Governments of\r\nAfrica.\r\nIn the course of the past two years, in order to\r\ngive coherence to NEPAD matters within African\r\nGovernments, we have emphasized the creation of an\r\ninstitutional framework to oversee the implementation\r\nof NEPAD at the regional level so as to integrate\r\nNEPAD priorities into our national development\r\nprogrammes and create institutions to manage those\r\npriorities. In that connection, we must also highlight\r\nthe fact that NEPAD includes an African Peer Review\r\nMechanism, whose objective is to foster the adoption\r\nof policies, standards and practices conducive to\r\npolitical stability, high economic growth, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and accelerated regional and continental\r\nintegration. We have already assembled a “panel of\r\nwise persons” to lend its assistance to the review\r\nprocess that will soon be under way.\r\nInternational support for the implementation of\r\nNEPAD is essential. NEPAD should be the framework\r\nwithin which the international community, including\r\nthe United Nations system, concentrates its efforts on\r\nAfrica’s development. In that connection, Africa’s\r\ndevelopment partners are urged to continue to lend\r\ntheir assistance, with a view to translating into reality\r\ntheir pledges of support to NEPAD.\r\nThat is the main agenda of the African Union,\r\nwhich seeks to build a strong foundation for\r\ndemocracy, good governance, peace, stability and\r\nsustainable development, as well as to create better\r\nliving conditions for all of Africa’s peoples. We\r\nrecognize that that represents a colossal challenge for\r\npresent and future generations of African leaders, as it\r\nwas when we created the Organization of African\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nUnity (OAU) 40 years ago and committed ourselves to\r\nliberating Africa as our main goal.\r\nIn Maputo we have also dealt with the issues of\r\npeace and security, for they continue to be the major\r\nchallenge in Africa. It is for that reason that we have\r\nreiterated the importance of the entry into force of the\r\nPeace and Security Council, which will be an important\r\nbody of the African Union that will deal with issues\r\nrelated to conflict prevention, management and\r\nresolution.\r\nStep by step, and with the continued support of\r\nthe international community, Africa is steadily\r\ndischarging its responsibilities for the maintenance of\r\npeace and stability in the continent.\r\nIn keeping with the OAU Algiers Summit\r\ndecision of 1999 on unconstitutional change of\r\nGovernment, the coordinated action of the African\r\nUnion, the Community of the Portuguese-Speaking\r\nCountries, the Economic Community of Central\r\nAfrican States, Nigeria, South Africa and other key\r\nplayers, enabled President Fradique de Menezes of Sao\r\nTome and Principe to return to power, foiling an\r\nattempted unconstitutional change of Government.\r\nThe recent positive developments in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, including the\r\nformation of the Transitional Government and the\r\nParliament, the appointment of army command\r\nstructures and the deployment of the forces of the\r\nUnited Nations Organization Mission in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) in\r\nBunia, have lent new momentum to the peace process\r\nin that country. We must not allow that process to be\r\nderailed. All of us, including neighbouring countries,\r\nhave an obligation to support the Congolese people and\r\nits Government in their long struggle for peace and\r\nstability.\r\nFollowing the departure of President Taylor from\r\nLiberia, on 18 August 2003, we witnessed the signing\r\nat Accra, Ghana, of the Comprehensive Peace\r\nAgreement. That Agreement covers a wide range of\r\nissues, including the cessation of hostilities. More\r\nimportantly, it provides for the establishment of a\r\ntransitional Government that will assume its\r\nresponsibilities on 14 October 2003 until the holding of\r\ncredible general elections in October 2005.\r\nAllow me pay well-deserved tribute to President\r\nKufuor of Ghana and President Obasanjo of Nigeria,\r\nand indeed to all the member States of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), for\r\ntheir critical role in that process. Regional leadership\r\nand international support for the peace process in\r\nLiberia will be meaningless if Liberians themselves fail\r\nto meet their obligations regarding peace and stability\r\nin their country. We would also like to commend the\r\nSecurity Council for its action on Liberia in support of\r\nECOWAS efforts. We welcome the adoption of\r\nresolution 1509 (2003), which established the United\r\nNations Mission in Liberia.\r\nWith respect to Burundi, we Africans have\r\ndischarged our responsibilities by establishing an\r\nAfrican mission in Burundi. In that context, I am happy\r\nto inform the General Assembly that, prior to my\r\ndeparture from Maputo, I bid farewell to the\r\nMozambican contingent of peacekeepers to be\r\ndeployed to Burundi. They are joining South African\r\nand Ethiopian forces in a clear demonstration of our\r\ncommitment to peace and stability in Burundi and in\r\nthe subregion. In that regard, I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to express our gratitude to the British\r\nGovernment for the assistance it has extended to us.\r\nWe appeal to the Security Council to adopt a\r\nresolution formally endorsing that mission, and to take\r\nthe necessary measures to provide political, financial\r\nand logistical support to it. Failure to act decisively\r\nwill lead to a deterioration of the situation, with serious\r\nimplications for the stability of Burundi and the\r\nsubregion.\r\nThe African Union and ECOWAS took prompt\r\nmeasures after the recent coup d’état in Guinea-Bissau\r\nto help the people of that country to return to\r\nconstitutional legality. We are pleased to inform the\r\nAssembly that they have already selected by consensus\r\na President and Prime Minister, who are going to lead a\r\ntransitional Government. They have also developed\r\nother bodies to prepare the country for elections, which\r\nare to be held soon. We appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to render its valuable assistance to Guinea-\r\nBissau so that it will be able to overcome its dramatic\r\nsocial and economic situation as soon as possible.\r\nIn the Horn of Africa, we must continue to\r\nencourage Ethiopia and Eritrea to work together, with\r\nthe support of the United Nations, to strengthen peace,\r\nstability and good neighbourliness and to overcome the\r\ndifficulties that continue to exist. The ongoing peace\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nprocesses in Sudan and Somalia raise our hopes that\r\nlasting peace will soon be achieved in the region.\r\nWe welcome the lifting of sanctions against Libya\r\nand the settlement reached between all parties\r\nconcerned, which will enable us to bring that issue to a\r\nclose.\r\nThe stabilization of the situation in Angola,\r\nComoros and Sierra Leone are clear signs that, despite\r\nthe difficulties, Africa is making strides towards the\r\nattainment of lasting peace, stability and socio-\r\neconomic development.\r\nThe peoples of Africa are fully engaged in\r\nbuilding a continent of hope. The African Union, along\r\nwith the regional economic communities, is committed\r\nto addressing the challenges faced by the continent.\r\nAfrica is endowed with human and natural resources\r\nthat can contribute decisively to African development.\r\nWhat we need is an opportunity to integrate ourselves\r\ninto the world economy; an opportunity to benefit from\r\nglobalization and increased interdependence; an\r\nopportunity to benefit from liberalized trade, finance\r\nand investment, instead of suffering from\r\nmarginalization and exclusion; and an opportunity for\r\naccess to science and technology, in particular\r\ninformation technology.\r\nThat will be possible if, among other things, the\r\ninternational community continues to seek viable and\r\neffective ways and means to address the debt burden,\r\nthe low levels of official development assistance and\r\nforeign direct investment and the issue of market\r\naccess for African products in developed countries.\r\nWith regard to the latter, we are disappointed that the\r\nCancún conference failed to produce positive results.\r\nThe recent tragic events that have claimed so\r\nmany innocent lives are a painful reminder of the fact\r\nthat international terrorism continues to represent a\r\nserious threat to peace and security in the world. Those\r\nevents have also further demonstrated that no country\r\nis immune from the scourge of terror and that we will\r\nhave to take concerted action to effectively address that\r\nissue. The United Nations remains the most appropriate\r\nforum to find the best ways and means to combat\r\nterrorism.\r\nIn recent times, some sceptical people have\r\nwondered whether the United Nations has lost its\r\ncredibility and relevance. The answer is clear: the role\r\nof the United Nations as the main instrument for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security has\r\ntoday been vindicated more than ever before. As the\r\nSecretary-General has correctly pointed out, it is\r\nthrough the United Nations that we can all find the\r\nmuch-sought legitimacy of action in tackling issues of\r\ncommon concern, including threats to peace and\r\nsecurity, and in addressing the challenges of\r\nsustainable development and HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis,\r\nmalaria and other infectious diseases.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals remain the\r\nmost significant targets agreed by the international\r\ncommunity, as they cover the major areas of concern to\r\nthe peoples of the world.\r\nSince the adoption of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, experience has shown that attaining its\r\ngoals requires greater international solidarity and\r\ncooperation.\r\nBy virtue of its universality, the United Nations\r\nhas shown that it has the political and moral authority\r\nto tackle not only the issues I have outlined, but also all\r\nother issues of concern to mankind. The Organization\r\nmust therefore be strengthened, safeguarded and\r\nadequately funded. It is for those reasons that we must\r\ncontinue to support the Secretary-General and the\r\nUnited Nations as they shoulder their responsibilities in\r\nlaying the foundations for a just and lasting peace and\r\nfor socio-economic development worldwide. We in\r\nAfrica reiterate our firm commitment to make our\r\ncontribution to the United Nations.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Mozambique for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President of the\r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Enrique Bolaños Geyer, President of\r\nthe Republic of Nicaragua\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Nicaragua.\r\nMr. Enrique Bolaños Geyer, President of the\r\nRepublic of Nicaragua, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Enrique Bolaños Geyer,\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nPresident of the Republic of Nicaragua, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Bolaños Geyer (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nwould like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of the fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly. I would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nacknowledge the fine work done by your predecessor,\r\nMr. Jan Kavan.\r\nAll of us were shocked by the terrorist attacks on\r\nUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad. In last\r\nmonth’s attack the precious lives of several innocent\r\nUnited Nations staff members were lost, including that\r\nof Sergio Vieira de Mello, the High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights. The world must not be intimidated by\r\nterrorism. The role of the United Nations as a guarantor\r\nof collective security is irreplaceable. Global security\r\nis the responsibility of all nations, just as we are all\r\nequally bound by international law.\r\nNicaragua has come to the General Assembly to\r\nmake suggestions with regard to the building of a new\r\nworld order and to cooperate actively within the\r\nmultilateral system to combat, among other scourges,\r\nterrorism, corruption, drug trafficking, the illegal\r\ntrafficking in arms and persons, and transnational\r\ncrime, all of which are harmful to strengthening\r\ndemocracy and the progress of the world.\r\nThat is why we have begun a new era in Central\r\nAmerica, in which the region will be more united than\r\never before and serve as a model for democratic\r\nsecurity that includes an innovative strategy to\r\novercome both traditional challenges and modern\r\nthreats.\r\nAt the meeting of Central American Presidents\r\nthat took place in Guatemala on 17 July 2003, I made a\r\nproposal for a programme for arms limitation and\r\ncontrol in Central America to achieve a reasonable\r\nbalance of forces and to foster stability, mutual trust\r\nand transparency. The idea behind my Government’s\r\nproposal is to establish the necessary controls to\r\nachieve a reasonable balance in defence forces; to put\r\nin place modern policies for regional defence and\r\npublic security while strengthening mechanisms for the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. The Central American\r\nPresidents meeting in Belize at the beginning of this\r\nmonth enthusiastically approved that plan. I am also\r\npleased to inform the General Assembly that technical\r\nteams have already begun to work to implement the\r\nplan.\r\nIn the current situation, the subject of\r\ninternational trafficking in small arms and light\r\nweapons is equally worthy of our attention. Nicaragua\r\nwill soon be the site of a major project to achieve\r\nprogress in that area.\r\nDrug trafficking is global threat that constitutes\r\nan assault on democracy and its institutions and\r\nimperils comprehensive human development. Due to\r\nour privileged geographical position, international\r\norganized crime is continuing to attempt to make\r\ninroads into our region in order to make it a gateway\r\nbetween producers and consumers of illicit substances.\r\nWe have cut off its advance in Nicaragua, a country\r\nthat enjoys high levels of domestic security. However,\r\nit is essential that we strengthen the cooperation of all\r\ninternational actors on the basis of shared\r\nresponsibility to prevent the expansion of organized\r\ncrime and increased drug use.\r\nMy country’s commitment to democratic security\r\nis consistent with the struggle for peace and the\r\nestablishment of a just international order. A country\r\nthat has experienced war, like Nicaragua, is in a better\r\nposition to make a more effective contribution to\r\npreventing war than countries that have not. We\r\nNicaraguans have suffered the horrors and the\r\naftermath of war. It is for that reason that Nicaragua\r\nhas the ability to make a contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nIt is also for that reason that I have come to\r\nGeneral Assembly, namely, to convey to the Assembly\r\nthe resolute desire and just aspirations of my\r\nGovernment and people to be elected as a non-\r\npermanent member of the Security Council for the\r\n2006-2007 term. Our candidacy has garnered\r\nincreasingly strong support, which we hope to\r\nstrengthen decisively in the coming months.\r\nThe fight against corruption is an unrelenting\r\nundertaking for my Government. We have achieved\r\nmajor successes and are proud to know we have set an\r\nexample that is already being emulated by some of our\r\nsisterly countries. I wish to express my gratitude for\r\nthe support of the international community, which\r\nunderstood our desire to bring morality to public\r\nadministration. Corruption is the cause of many evils,\r\nand it takes a huge toll on the economy, in addition to\r\nundermining public and private institutions.\r\nNicaragua greatly appreciates efforts to develop a\r\nUnited Nations convention against corruption. In that\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nregard, we also welcome the progress made during the\r\nsixth round of meetings in Vienna, which will provide\r\na solid foundation for the establishment of international\r\nlegal norms to help combat that scourge, thereby\r\nstrengthening political stability in our countries.\r\nHowever, the fight against corruption in my country\r\nalso requires a strengthening of the judicial and\r\nelectoral systems.\r\nResistance to change makes it difficult to make\r\nprogress in those areas at the pace and scope required\r\nto meet my country’s needs. I therefore recently\r\npresented to Nicaragua’s political, economic and social\r\nactors my proposal for a national development plan, in\r\norder to obtain the input of all segments of Nicaraguan\r\nsociety. That plan also specifies the actions to be taken\r\nby every State entity in evaluating and modifying the\r\nplan to achieve the country’s comprehensive\r\ndevelopment.\r\nNicaragua needs foreign assistance. That\r\nassistance should be coordinated in a manner that takes\r\ninto account national plans and strategies pertaining to\r\nhow assistance is utilized. The quality, effectiveness\r\nand impact of such cooperation should be improved by\r\nemploying new ideas that lead to tangible results in the\r\narea of sustainable development. Additional new\r\nresources will also be necessary to fulfil the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nWe appreciate the United Kingdom’s proposal for\r\nan international financing facility as a way to increase\r\nthe flow of short-term resources by issuing negotiable\r\ninstruments backed by future assistance.\r\nCooperation in solidarity by the international\r\ncommunity has been particularly meaningful in the\r\narea of mine clearance in my country, where substantial\r\nprogress has been made, thanks both to the fine work\r\nof national and international institutions participating\r\nin that humanitarian endeavour and the professionalism\r\nof the our army’s sappers.\r\nNicaragua is also a thankful country. On several\r\noccasions, we have received significant amounts of\r\nhumanitarian assistance from many countries. As a\r\ntoken of our gratitude, we have made our small, but\r\nfull, contribution of humanitarian assistance to\r\nneighbouring countries in need. We are now taking part\r\nin the purely humanitarian mission involving mine\r\nclearance and the provision of medical support for the\r\ncivilian population in Iraq.\r\nHowever, international cooperation alone is not\r\nenough to achieve economic development. We must\r\npromote a more equitable international trade system\r\nthrough the World Trade Organization. In other words,\r\nwhat good is cooperation for productive development\r\nwhen there are tariff and non-tariff restrictions on\r\ntrade? We want fair treatment. That is the issue, and we\r\nhope the developed countries will support us in\r\nbringing about a new trade relationship with\r\ndeveloping countries — such as Nicaragua. With fair\r\ntreatment and with markets for our products, we will\r\nhave a more competitive Central American market and\r\nwill attract greater investment in order to generate\r\nmore jobs at fair wages, reaping the benefits of the\r\nregion’s strategic geographic location.\r\nThe Central American integration process has\r\nmade much progress and has been one of the pillars of\r\nmy foreign policy. We have achieved our most notable\r\nresults in economic integration, and we have paved the\r\nway for successful negotiation of free-trade treaties\r\nwith other countries and regions, such as the one we\r\nare currently working out with the United States.\r\nNicaragua will insist on preferential treatment in our\r\nnegotiations because our economy is less developed,\r\nvery open and highly dependent on trade and external\r\nfinancing. With greater development and wealth\r\ngeneration, we will keep our citizens from migrating to\r\nthe North or to other countries.\r\nPeace is still only a hope in some regions of the\r\nworld. Nicaragua advocates multilateral action to find\r\npeaceful solutions in keeping with international law.\r\nWe are concerned at the escalation of the situation in\r\nthe Middle East and its consequences, which is why we\r\nbelieve that the international community must\r\ncontribute, through the United Nations, to finding a\r\njust and lasting peace in the region. My Government\r\nsupports an immediate resumption of the peace process\r\nbegun this year through the peace plan known as the\r\nroad map.\r\nWe confirm our commitment to strengthening the\r\nuniversal vocation of the United Nations so that all\r\npeoples of the world, without exception, can be fairly\r\nrepresented in it. That is why I reaffirm before the\r\nAssembly the importance of considering the desire of a\r\npeople with legitimate representation — the Republic\r\nof China — to participate as a full-fledged member of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nNicaragua recognizes its responsibility in the\r\nbuilding of a new international order that is more\r\nhumane, more just and more secure. It has been our lot\r\nto live through difficult times since that fateful day of\r\n11 September. Let us be capable of building a different\r\nworld, so that future generations will not blame us for a\r\nlack of consensus on humanity’s problems requiring\r\nurgent action. Nicaragua is aware of that responsibility,\r\nand therefore we pledge to work with other Member\r\nStates to defend multilateralism and to overcome\r\ncurrent security problems, remaining united in the\r\nspirit of the Charter of the United Nations and in strict\r\nadherence to and respect for international law.\r\nMay God bless the Assembly, may God bless the\r\nUnited Nations, may God bless all peoples of the\r\nworld, and may God always bless Nicaragua.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Nicaragua for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Enrique Bolaños Geyer, President of the\r\nRepublic of Nicaragua, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Arnold Rüütel, President of the\r\nRepublic of Estonia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Estonia.\r\nMr. Arnold Rüütel, President of the Republic of\r\nEstonia, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Arnold Rüütel, President\r\nof the Republic of Estonia, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Rüütel (spoke in Estonian; English\r\ntext provided by the delegation): Allow me to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. That is\r\na significant tribute to you and to Saint Lucia. Estonia,\r\nlike Saint Lucia, is a small State, and together we can\r\nadmit that the United Nations is an Organization that\r\nallows small States to participate on equal footing with\r\nlarge ones in influencing global processes. I also\r\ncommend your predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for his\r\naccomplishments in presiding over the fifty-seventh\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I am particularly\r\npleased to do so in the light of the similar histories of\r\nEstonia and the Czech Republic and of our common\r\nendeavours to join the family of democratic nations,\r\nthe European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nAlliance.\r\nThe fifty-eighth regular session is the first since\r\nthe outbreak of the war in Iraq. This year has been a\r\ndifficult one, both for the United Nations and for the\r\nentire world. Long and emotional debates in the\r\nSecurity Council preceded the Iraq crisis. Many think\r\nthat the war, rising tensions among States and the\r\ncountry’s post-war reconstruction have tested the\r\nOrganization’s capabilities, its credibility and its role in\r\nthe world. I should like to believe, not that the past\r\nyear has undermined the Organization’s morale, but the\r\ncontrary. Those ordeals and the Iraq war have served as\r\na lesson and have deepened our conviction that the\r\nUnited Nations should be even more decisive and\r\nefficient in the future than it is today.\r\nUnfortunately, the crisis in Iraq has affected more\r\nthan the morale of the United Nations. Although the\r\nOrganization has been the target of terrorist attacks\r\nbefore — such an attack was planned against United\r\nNations Headquarters many years ago — the terrorist\r\nbombings of the United Nations headquarters in Iraq a\r\ncouple of days ago and on 19 August — which claimed\r\nmore than 20 lives — were unprecedented. Terrorism\r\nand violence never choose their victims and it is\r\nsignificant that the United Nations, as an Organization\r\nfor global peace and stability uniting all States of the\r\nworld, was targeted.\r\nI would like to emphasize that Estonia has\r\nresolutely condemned the terrorist attack on the United\r\nNations mission in Baghdad. Together with all\r\nrepresentatives here, the people of Estonia and I are in\r\ndeep morning over the tragic murder of Sergio Vieira\r\nde Mello, Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, and others. I deeply sympathize with their\r\nrelatives and colleagues.\r\nA terrorist act against people who are committed\r\nto assisting the people of Iraq is a painful blow to the\r\nUnited Nations and a crime against the people of Iraq\r\nand the international community. However, it cannot\r\nserve as an impetus for the United Nations to withdraw\r\nfrom hot spots. Estonia welcomes the statement made\r\nby Secretary-General Kofi Annan that, despite the\r\nattacks, the United Nations will continue its activity in\r\nIraq. Terrorists should not determine the future of Iraq\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nor make the people of that country and the international\r\ncommunity withdraw from the goal of building up a\r\nsovereign, democratic and prosperous Iraq.\r\nRecent events have even more clearly\r\ndemonstrated the need for the presence of stabilization\r\nforces in Iraq. In order to enforce peace and stability in\r\nthe Persian Gulf region, enhanced cooperation between\r\ncoalition forces, the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community is necessary. Despite its small\r\nsize and moderate resources, Estonia is also actively\r\ninvolved. In May 2003, the Estonian Parliament\r\napproved the deployment of a unit of the Estonian\r\nDefence Forces to peace enforcement operations in\r\nIraq and Estonian servicemen joined the mission in the\r\nPersian Gulf region in June. Estonia has acceded to all\r\n12 United Nations anti-terrorist conventions and is\r\nactively cooperating with many States and international\r\norganizations.\r\nNow I will proceed to a central topic of my\r\naddress — the environment and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. I consider a sustainable approach to the\r\nenvironment and sustainable development to be one of\r\nthe most significant commitments, both for the United\r\nNations and for States. In the long term, the welfare\r\nand conditions of peoples will depend primarily on our\r\nability or will to use wisely and sparingly the limited\r\nresources of our planet and to shape the environment\r\nwe live in. With respect to the ever-growing population\r\nof the world, increased production and consumption, as\r\nwell as the resulting pollution, the pressure of human\r\nactivity on our living environment is continuously\r\nbuilding. In the circumstances, environmental\r\nprotection and ensuring the welfare of mankind and\r\nwildlife are becoming an ever-more important and\r\ndifficult task. It is not by chance that the United\r\nNations proclaimed the year 2003 as the International\r\nYear of Fresh Water and that the year 2002 focused on\r\neco-tourism and mountain regions.\r\nTwenty years ago, the General Assembly adopted\r\na resolution establishing the World Commission on\r\nEnvironment and Development to define global\r\nproblems and to find ways of solving them. Gro\r\nHarlem Brundtland headed the Commission. The report\r\nentitled Our Common Future, completed in 1987,\r\ndefined sustainable development. The main message of\r\nthe report was that economic growth and increased\r\nwelfare of the people should not compromise the\r\nability of future generations and the environment to\r\nmeet their own needs. Global economic development\r\nshould take into consideration the tolerance thresholds\r\nof the environment and the need to preserve natural\r\nresources.\r\nSustainable development, as a cohesive\r\ndevelopment of the socio-economic field and the\r\nenvironment, has become a priority of most\r\ndemocracies throughout the world, especially after the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. As the head of\r\nthe Estonian delegation to the Conference, I signed\r\nAgenda 21 and the Framework Conventions on Climate\r\nChange and Biological Diversity.\r\nEleven years have passed since the Rio de Janeiro\r\nConference. Considering developments since then, we\r\nsee that some progress in global environmental\r\ncooperation among States has taken place. New goals\r\nwere set and interim conclusions made at the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly in New York in 1997\r\nand at the World Summit on Sustainable Development\r\nin Johannesburg in 2002. The General Assembly\r\nsession in 2000 agreed on the Millennium Declaration,\r\nwith the main goal set as environmental sustainability.\r\nHowever, we must note that the world’s\r\npopulation has grown by 1 billion since the Rio de\r\nJaneiro Conference in 1992. In the 1990s, the world\r\ngross domestic product grew by an average of 2.6 per\r\ncent a year. No doubt, sooner or later these processes\r\nare going to influence the living environment of us all.\r\nAlthough we cannot as yet define the actual\r\nrelationship between human activity and the climate of\r\nour planet, a glimpse into the climate changes of the\r\nlast decade is worrying. Natural phenomena like El\r\nNiño and La Niña have had a lasting impact on human\r\nlife. Floods, droughts, tornadoes and extreme\r\nfluctuations of temperature have become nearly daily\r\nrealities on our planet. European States have not\r\nremained untouched by the climate changes. In 1997,\r\nfloods devastated Eastern Europe; last summer,\r\nWestern and Central Europe were hit by a heat wave.\r\nThese facts should convince us that environmental\r\nprotection is a matter of common concern for all\r\nmankind.\r\nCooperation readiness is extremely important and\r\nEstonia has done its best to collaborate. We have\r\nacceded to all essential environmental conventions and\r\nwish all other States in the world to do the same.\r\nEstonia ratified the Framework Convention on Climate\r\nChange on 27 July 1994 and acceded to the Kyoto\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nProtocol on 17 November 1998. In unison with the\r\nEuropean Union, Estonia expresses its clear\r\ndetermination to enforce the Kyoto Protocol as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nEstonia is a small State with moderate resources,\r\nplaying a small role in the world economy and the\r\nenvironment. Nevertheless, we adhere to the principle,\r\n“act local, think global”. Environmental protection is\r\nextremely important. Estonia has a long tradition of\r\nnature conservation. As early as in 1297, King Erik\r\nMenved of Denmark banned cutting forests on several\r\nEstonian islands. In 1995, four years after regaining\r\nindependence, Estonia adopted its Sustainable\r\nDevelopment Act. In 2001, at the recommendation of\r\nthe Committee on Sustainable Development, the\r\nGovernment of Estonia approved a strategy of\r\nsustainable development — Sustainable Estonia 21.\r\nMore than in any other field, inter-State\r\ncooperation is important in environmental protection,\r\nand regional organizations play a substantial role in\r\nthis regard. The Baltic Sea States have displayed\r\nremarkable initiative, which other regions of the world\r\nwould find worth following. The Baltic Sea regional\r\nsustainable development process was launched in 1996.\r\nIt is unique in the world — an Agenda 21 for the Baltic\r\nSea States — Baltic 21. The parties to the process\r\ninclude all Baltic Sea States and the European\r\nCommission. The process targets the elaboration and\r\nthe implementation of sustainable development visions\r\nand an action plan for the entire region and key sectors.\r\nThe Baltic Sea joins the members of the Council\r\nof the Baltic Sea States (CBSS). It is especially\r\nappropriate to speak about the protection of the Baltic\r\nSea in the International Year of Fresh Water. Currently,\r\nEstonia holds the CBSS presidency, and the protection\r\nof the environment, first and foremost of the Baltic\r\nSea, is among the top priorities of the presidency.\r\nDuring our presidency, we would like to focus on new\r\nhazards arising from the intensifying marine traffic on\r\nthe Baltic Sea. Estonia is targeting its efforts towards\r\nachieving an agreement between member States to\r\nreduce the oil-tanker-pollution hazard to a minimum.\r\nEstonia supports the initiative of the European Union\r\nto ban the traffic of single-hull tankers on the Baltic\r\nSea, and is committed to having the Baltic Sea\r\nclassified as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA).\r\nI would like to conclude by stressing that,\r\nalthough I have touched only upon terrorism and the\r\nenvironment, Estonia fully shares all the priorities of\r\nthe European Union (EU) at the fifty-eighth session of\r\nthe General Assembly, particularly, the non-\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\r\npeacekeeping, the protection of human rights and\r\ncombating the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\r\nThe future of the United Nations is also important\r\nfor Estonia. The United Nations needs to be improved\r\nand restructured. Estonia has favoured the overall\r\nstrengthening of our common Organization and\r\nwelcomes the efforts of Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\nto revitalize the United Nations, primarily the General\r\nAssembly. In our opinion, reform of the Security\r\nCouncil should enable the United Nations to participate\r\nmore efficiently in problem-solving and crisis\r\nresolution throughout the world.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s recent report on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration is a\r\nsignificant and important document that deserves\r\ndetailed analysis and serious consideration. Isn’t it time\r\nfor the United Nations family to support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his concern about the Organization now and\r\nabout its future? Let us agree — both the large and the\r\nsmall Member States — upon what we would like to\r\naccomplish and when, and let us move steadily ahead.\r\nOnly a strong United Nations, with efficient decision-\r\nmaking mechanisms, can ensure global welfare and\r\nbalance. Let that be a goal for us.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Estonia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Arnold Rüütel, President of the Republic of\r\nEstonia, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President of\r\nthe Republic of Ghana\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Ghana.\r\nMr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President of the\r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nPresident Kufuor: The past two years have been\r\nyears of near apocalyptic ordeal for the world and this\r\ngreat Organization. In rapid succession, the world and\r\nthis Organization have been caught in what can only be\r\ndescribed as a crossfire of terrorism, violence and wars.\r\nThe uncertainties resulting from these situations are yet\r\nto be dispelled. Much of the world is still in the dark,\r\ngroping for a glimpse of what the future direction of\r\ninternational relations and this Organization will be.\r\nThe recent unwarranted attacks against the United\r\nNations headquarters and personnel in Baghdad, Iraq,\r\nshould be roundly condemned. They should not break\r\nthe will of this Organization to continue to provide\r\nhumanitarian assistance and relief to the people of Iraq.\r\nWe in Ghana still believe in the United Nations as\r\nthe global repository of humankind’s aspiration. We\r\nbelieve that the problems of the twenty-first century\r\ncannot be addressed without universal commitment to\r\nmultilateralism spearheaded by the United Nations. We\r\nrecommend, however, that fairness, firmness, humanity\r\nand a sense of balance must characterize United\r\nNations responses to all events of a similar nature,\r\nirrespective of where such events occur, if this\r\nOrganization is to enhance its credibility and ensure its\r\nrelevance in a sustained manner.\r\nLiving in the West African subregion, which has\r\nexperienced more than its fair share of conflicts, my\r\ncountrymen are familiar with the negative effects of\r\nconflicts, and the pain of insecurity. They also know\r\nthe importance of multilateral efforts in conflict\r\nmanagement. Hence, for more than 40 years, Ghana\r\nhas demonstrated commitment to international conflict\r\nprevention and resolution and peacekeeping missions\r\naround the world, under the auspices of the United\r\nNations, and now the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS). The latest is the country’s\r\nparticipation in the ECOWAS Peace Force\r\n(ECOFORCE), in Côte d’Ivoire and Liberia.\r\nAfrica accepts its responsibility for resolving the\r\ncontinent’s internal conflicts. Today, there is no doubt\r\nthat the nations of Africa are rising to this challenge.\r\nBut there is also no doubt that the continent suffers\r\nmassive shortcomings in financing and technological\r\nresources. This is why the international community,\r\nespecially the United Nations, under its Charter\r\nobligations, must continue to support Africa in its\r\nefforts to maintain peace. It is therefore hoped that\r\nSecurity Council consideration of Africa’s conflicts\r\nwill yield adequate, practical and timely support to\r\nresolve them.\r\nIn my current capacity as Chairman of ECOWAS,\r\nI wish to acknowledge the valuable support of the\r\nvarious Governments as well as international\r\norganizations, which have contributed to the efforts of\r\nthe Community to achieve peace and stabilize the\r\nsubregion. With this help, the Community is\r\nsucceeding in resolving conflicts that have engulfed\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and other nations.\r\nAll of them are now, thankfully, on the way to stability\r\nand normality. I therefore seize this opportunity to\r\nexpress the appreciation of the Community and myself\r\nto France, the United Kingdom and the United States of\r\nAmerica, as well as the European Union and the United\r\nNations, under the leadership of the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, to name just a few of those who have\r\nprovided substantial assistance.\r\nWhile ECOWAS fully appreciates the support of\r\nour friends, it must nevertheless appeal for some more\r\nresources from this Organization and the international\r\ncommunity to enable it to consolidate the peace and\r\nnormalization process. It might be necessary to stress\r\nthat, in some instances within the subregion, post-\r\nconflict peace-building efforts have failed, mainly\r\nbecause the problems involved were not addressed in a\r\nsystematic, sustained and holistic manner. In the main,\r\nsuch problems include the disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and reintegration of combatants into\r\nregular society. ECOWAS therefore appeals for the\r\nassistance needed for their effective management.\r\nYet another serious continuing menace is the\r\nprevalent illicit trade in small arms and light weapons\r\nin the subregion. In this regard, we note the\r\ncommendable progress made by the international\r\ncommunity in addressing this menace through the\r\nUnited Nations Programme of Action to Prevent,\r\nCombat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\r\nand Light Weapons. The truth, however, is that more\r\nvigorous and resourceful effort is needed to succeed.\r\nThe Human Development Report 2003 exposes\r\nthe tragedy that besets sub-Saharan Africa, and this is\r\nthe most suitable platform to highlight it. The report\r\nstates that the rest of the world has left sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica behind, and that it will take 150 years for our\r\nregion to achieve the Millennium Development Goals\r\nthat Member States of this Organization had hoped to\r\nachieve by 2015. The report indicates that: “Unless\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nthings improve, it would take sub-Saharan Africa until\r\n2129 to achieve universal primary education, until\r\n2147” — more than a century later than hoped — “to\r\nhalve extreme poverty, and until 2165 to cut child\r\nmortality by two thirds. For hunger, no date can be set\r\nbecause the region’s situation continues to worsen.”\r\nThis is the century of the global village. How can\r\nsub-Saharan Africa, with more than 400 million\r\npeople, be condemned to such a fate? Clearly, this must\r\nnot be acceptable for the globalization process. This is\r\nwhy the international community, particularly the\r\nindustrialized nations, should appreciate the urgency of\r\nthe situation and offer commensurate partnership and\r\nassistance to the African Union and its initiative, the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD),\r\nto relaunch the continent’s development.\r\nThe current leadership of the continent has\r\nresolved to nurture Africa back to prosperity within the\r\nframework of the NEPAD. Good governance —\r\ncharacterized by democratic constitutional rule; the\r\nrule of law; respect for human rights and property\r\nrights; accountable government and its recognition and\r\nintercourse with civil organizations; freedom of\r\nexpression; private-sector promotion; religious\r\ntolerance; eradication of illiteracy; and promotion of\r\ngender balance and children’s rights — is fast\r\nbecoming the order of the day throughout Africa.\r\nIndeed, good governance is an article of faith of the\r\nAfrican Union today.\r\nEconomically, the African Union is calling for\r\npartnerships, both within and outside the continent, to\r\npool capital, technological and managerial ideas, and\r\nalso markets, to promote and fast track the\r\ndevelopment of Africa into the mainstream of the\r\nglobal market.\r\nAt this stage, may I be permitted to express some\r\nreservations on the topical issue of world trade? It must\r\nbe recognized that even as globalization is engulfing all\r\nthe corners of the world, in such a manner that no part\r\ncan opt out, free trade and competition, which are the\r\nhallmarks of the global market, can prove inimical and\r\ndisastrous to most nations, particularly the developing\r\nand least developed countries. This will be so unless\r\nthe process of globalization is properly and sensitively\r\nmanaged.\r\nThe reality of the situation is that most of the\r\nleast developed countries are in Africa, especially sub-\r\nSaharan Africa. At the current stage of development,\r\nmost of Africa is limited to exporting raw minerals and\r\nagricultural commodities. This means that unless the\r\ndeveloped parts of the world remove subsidies for their\r\nagricultural and mineral sectors, Africa cannot be\r\ncompetitive. Indeed, Africa’s equivalent sectors may be\r\ndestroyed with dumping from the advanced parts of the\r\nworld. It is also being seriously suggested that, even as\r\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) recognizes that\r\nAfrica must be accorded a status of transition, or a\r\nspecial status for a carefully calculated period, the\r\nWTO does not seem to be propagating this necessity\r\nenough to give practical effect to it. The failure of\r\nCancún bears witness to this. The World Trade\r\nOrganization must, therefore, do its homework well to\r\ncarry the poor nations with it. A combination of trade\r\nand aid must be used to assist the African Union and its\r\ncomponent nations and to nurture their economies into\r\ncompetitive resourcefulness. This is the way to\r\nempower Africa and get it into the mainstream of the\r\nworld market, without adding to the hardships of the\r\nalready marginalized people of the continent.\r\nThis being a session devoted to the consideration\r\nof the biennial budget for 2004-2005, we hope that all\r\nMember States will work together positively to ensure\r\nthat adequate funding is provided for all prioritized\r\nmandates for implementation, including those for the\r\ndevelopment and stability of Africa. In this regard, we\r\nwelcome the recent establishment of the Office of the\r\nSpecial Adviser on Africa to the Secretary-General,\r\nand look forward to the positive contribution which the\r\nOffice will make to meet the numerous challenges on\r\nthe continent.\r\nMy delegation is happy with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s renewed efforts to reform aspects of this\r\nOrganization’s operations and appreciates his challenge\r\nto Member States to make a bold effort towards this\r\nend. In this regard, we assure him of our full support\r\nduring this session for the adoption and implementation\r\nof his renewed vision, and we endorse his report\r\nentitled “Strengthening the United Nations: an agenda\r\nfor further change” (A/57/387 and Corr.1).\r\nWe also wish to reiterate the imperative need for\r\nthe Security Council to be reformed, in order to ensure\r\nthat it carries out its Charter obligations more\r\neffectively in the full confidence of Member States. In\r\nthis regard, we subscribe wholly to the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement’s position on the question of an increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council. We also\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nendorse Africa’s claim to have at least two permanent\r\nseats.\r\nWe sincerely hope that the Organization will be\r\nempowered to assume a central role in the current\r\nefforts to normalize the situation in the Middle East,\r\nespecially in Iraq and Palestine. The strengthening of\r\nthe Organization to provide this leadership will\r\nreinvigorate it to survive this century and promote the\r\ncause of peace and security in the world.\r\nLet me conclude by thanking your predecessor\r\nfor having ably guided the deliberations of the General\r\nAssembly through what was by all accounts a\r\nparticularly difficult year. We are also happy to see you\r\nin the Presidency. We are confident that the General\r\nAssembly could not be in more competent hands and\r\nwe wish you well.\r\nI thank you and may God bless us all.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Ghana for the statement just made.\r\nMr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President of the\r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of\r\nthe People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of the\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic of Algeria and former\r\nPresident of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of the\r\nPeople’s Republic of Algeria, was escorted into\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika,\r\nPresident of the People’s Democratic Republic of\r\nAlgeria and former President of the General Assembly,\r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Bouteflika (spoke in Arabic):\r\nMr. President, I would like to congratulate you most\r\nwarmly on your election as President of the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, whose proceedings\r\nwill undoubtedly benefit from your personal qualities\r\nand your skills and experience in international\r\nrelations. I am also certain that you are an excellent\r\nsuccessor to an excellent predecessor.\r\nI would like also to pay tribute to our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, for his determined efforts and dedication to\r\nthe service of world peace and the fulfilment of the\r\npurposes of the United Nations.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly\r\ntakes place in a complex international situation\r\ncharacterized by mounting threats that imperil the\r\npurposes and role of our Organization.\r\nIndeed, recent developments have marked the\r\nopening of a new phase of instability, uncertainty and\r\napprehensiveness, highlighting the dangers arising\r\nfrom the side-stepping of our Organization in the\r\nconduct of world affairs. More than ever before, the\r\nOrganization’s irreplaceable role is brought to the fore,\r\nas a universal forum responsible for maintaining an\r\ninternational order based on peace, security and\r\ncooperation for development.\r\nThe international community finds itself squarely\r\nfaced with the duty to restore its cohesion and mobilize\r\nits means and energy towards full rehabilitation of the\r\nUnited Nations, through the upholding, by all, of the\r\nCharter’s purposes and principles, which constitute the\r\nindispensable foundations for a civilized international\r\nsociety.\r\nWe have to revive the strong momentum gained\r\nas a result of the Millennium Summit and further\r\nenhanced and carried forward through the role played\r\nby the United Nations in organizing a collective\r\nresponse against terrorism in the wake of the wanton\r\nattacks of 11 September 2001. Those attacks were truly\r\nbarbaric.\r\nPeace, security, and development issues are at the\r\ncore of the mission of our Organization. Today, they\r\nrequire a renewal of our commitment to international\r\ncooperation, especially since we live in an increasingly\r\ninterdependent world, where problems are also closely\r\ninterrelated.\r\nWe strongly support the view that the United\r\nNations remains the best place where Member States\r\nshould join in collective endeavours in their quest for\r\nthe common good. We should cooperate within the\r\nframework of our Organization and work together to\r\npromote development and compliance with\r\ninternational law, in order to lay the foundations for a\r\nstable and secure world rooted in solidarity.\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nTherefore, strengthening our Organization and\r\nimproving its effectiveness stands as a collective task,\r\na top priority and a shared responsibility of all Member\r\nStates that seek to prevent crisis situations, address\r\nthreats to international peace and security, and ensure\r\nnecessary conditions for sustainable development.\r\nAmong the challenges that should be confronted by the\r\ninternational community, I will dwell on terrorism first,\r\nbecause preventing and combating terrorism still\r\nrequires a high level of vigilance, mobilization and\r\nmultifaceted cooperation at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels.\r\nAt the risk of repeating ourselves, we will\r\ncontinue to warn against all misconceptions and the\r\ntendentious association of terrorism with a particular\r\nreligion, civilization or geographical area. Equally, we\r\nneed to agree upon an accurate definition of terrorism,\r\nso as not to affect national liberation struggles and the\r\nlegitimate right of peoples to self-determination. Such\r\na clarification should be provided as part of the draft\r\nglobal convention against terrorism, currently on the\r\ninternational agenda. Launching a genuine dialogue\r\namong cultures and civilizations will be helpful in\r\nfostering rapprochement and understanding among\r\npeoples, by combating prejudiced viewpoints and\r\nnarrow-minded perceptions. Situations will still be\r\ntense wherever peoples are deprived of their rights, and\r\ndenied freedom and dignity.\r\nThis is the case in Palestine, where the\r\nPalestinian people are still denied the enjoyment of\r\ntheir right to exist, despite the universal recognition of\r\ntheir national rights today. The prevarication, delaying\r\ntactics and systematic repression used by Israel for\r\ndecades to defer the settlement of the Palestinian\r\nproblem, have now led to an explosive situation that\r\nseriously threatens regional and global peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe international community should become\r\ninvolved in a more decisive manner to put an end to\r\nthis spiralling situation, and firmly urge Israel to fully\r\ncooperate for a global, just and lasting solution which\r\nnecessarily includes the establishment of an\r\nindependent and fully sovereign Palestinian State, with\r\nAl-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, and the withdrawal\r\nfrom the Lebanese and Syrian territories remaining\r\nunder occupation.\r\nIn this same sensitive region, the Iraqi people’s\r\ntragic predicament endures. We must emphasize the\r\nurgent need to help them establish their own\r\nindependent institutions, to exercise unhindered control\r\nover their economy and natural resources and to\r\nmaintain their unity and territorial integrity. In our\r\nopinion, only the United Nations can legitimately and\r\neffectively accompany the institution-building and\r\nreconstruction of the country, and its role in these\r\nprocesses is of paramount importance.\r\nIn our immediate region, in Western Sahara, the\r\npeople of this territory, 28 years after withdrawal of the\r\nformer colonial Power, are still waiting for the right to\r\nexercise in freedom, and without constraint, their\r\ninalienable right to self determination in compliance\r\nwith international legality. Algeria has consistently lent\r\nits support to the efforts of the Secretary-General and\r\nhis personal envoy, as evidenced by its support of the\r\nSettlement Plan and the Huston Agreements, signed\r\nand accepted by the parties to the conflict, the\r\nKingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front.\r\nBy accepting the peace plan for self-\r\ndetermination of the people of Western Sahara,\r\nunanimously endorsed by the Security Council last\r\nJuly, and submitted by the Special Representative of\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. James Baker, Algeria has\r\nonce again shown its availability to fully contribute to\r\nthe settlement of this conflict. This settlement must\r\ncomply with the right of the people of the Western\r\nSahara to decide, in sovereignty, on their destiny\r\nthrough a fair and free referendum of self-\r\ndetermination, to be organized and monitored by the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe challenges facing the world in the fields of\r\npeace, security and economic and social development\r\nare particularly acute in Africa. This continent has\r\nendeavoured over the last few years, with resolve and\r\ndetermination, to settle the conflicts affecting several\r\nof its regions, thus generating and encouraging a peace\r\ndynamic.\r\nIn order to achieve its peace and developmental\r\ngoals, Africa must, above all, rely on the support and\r\nenhancement of African endeavours. No doubt,\r\nhowever, it also needs increased international\r\ncooperation and support. The strategy of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) aims\r\nspecifically at an optimal mobilization of both African\r\nand international resources, and the harmonization of\r\nthese contributions through a partnership based on\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nmutual commitments and balanced interests and\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nThe G-8 countries and European Union member\r\nStates, as well as other countries and organizations that\r\nare partners of Africa, have already taken steps to focus\r\ntheir Africa-related policies and programmes in support\r\nof NEPAD. Such a partnership should be intensified to\r\nhelp Africa, which is still lagging behind, to increase\r\nthe pace of its development, to catch up in achieving\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, particularly that\r\nof reducing poverty to half its present level by the year\r\n2015.\r\nEnhancing international cooperation is also an\r\nurgent task, in order to ensure the bases for sustained\r\ngrowth of the world economy, and actual integration of\r\ndeveloping countries into the fields of production,\r\ntechnology and trade. Basically, there is a need to\r\nensure the necessary conditions so that globalization\r\nwill offer genuine opportunities for all. This implies\r\npromoting equitable rules of the game to advance trade,\r\nfinance, investments and technology transfer.\r\nIn this connection, we are concerned that the\r\nrecent World Trade Organization Ministerial\r\nConference, held in Cancún, did not manage to draw a\r\nframework for negotiations to revitalize the Doha\r\nmeeting, which was already well behind schedule. We\r\nare still convinced that the reactivation of these\r\nnegotiations and their successful completion, in\r\nconformity with the development agenda, holds to a\r\nlarge extent the key to the growth prospects of the\r\nworld’s economy.\r\nIt is therefore of critical importance to overcome\r\nthe remaining difficulties on the basis of an approach\r\nthat takes into account the interests and concerns of all\r\nparties, as well as the need to restore the multilateral\r\ntrading system’s integrity, and effectively implement\r\nthe special and differential treatment afforded to\r\ndeveloping countries. Adequate international action is\r\nalso required to address growing phenomena that are\r\nbecoming more pronounced, such as speculative flows,\r\nmoney-laundering, financing of terrorism, illicit\r\npayments and bribery, as well as harmful practices in\r\nthe field of corporate governance. This is needed to\r\nstimulate productive investment and ensure sustained\r\nlong-term growth. It is therefore important to tap the\r\nhuge investment opportunities available in the\r\ndeveloping world, in particular, which eventually will\r\nbenefit the world economy as a whole.\r\nSignificantly increasing official development\r\nassistance and acting with greater resolve to find\r\nsolutions to the problem of the external debt burden of\r\ndeveloping countries, as well as improving access to\r\nworld markets for the products of the countries of the\r\nSouth would all go a long way towards enhancing the\r\ninvestment climate in those countries and towards\r\nincreasing their share of world trade, which remains\r\nthe ultimate goal for achieving sustained financing for\r\ndevelopment. At stake is the establishment of a new\r\ninternational partnership based on the equitable sharing\r\nof responsibilities and benefits.\r\nTo conclude, let me once again put on record our\r\nfull confidence in our Organization, whose mission in\r\nfavour of world peace and economic and social\r\ndevelopment for all peoples, remains more valid than\r\never. We shall therefore continue to call on all Member\r\nStates without exception to contribute to enhancing the\r\nOrganization’s authority and to provide it with the\r\nmeans necessary to fulfil its responsibilities.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic of Algeria for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of the\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic of Algeria, was\r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Lucio Gutiérrez Borbúa, President of\r\nthe Republic of Ecuador\r\nThe President: The Assembly will hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Ecuador.\r\nMr. Lucio Gutiérrez Borbúa, President of the\r\nRepublic of Ecuador, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Lucio Gutiérrez Borbúa,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Ecuador, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Gutiérrez Borbúa (spoke in Spanish):\r\nEcuador, a country profoundly committed to peace,\r\nreaffirms its most categorical condemnation of\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Terrorist\r\nviolence can never be justified for any reason and must\r\nbe fought with firmness, using all legal measures at the\r\ndisposal of States to counter this global threat. The\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\naction of terrorist organizations and networks respect\r\nno national or regional borders. The successful\r\neradication of terrorism depends on international\r\ncooperation and the concerted action of States in\r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nSince I assumed the presidency of my country,\r\nand now the presidency of the Andean Community, the\r\nissue of Colombia has been at the top of my agenda.\r\nMy Government, on behalf of the Ecuadorian people,\r\nhas expressed its concern at that conflict because we\r\nare linked to our neighbour Colombia by great ties of\r\nfriendship and deep historical roots.\r\nBecause of the serious threat that conflict poses\r\nfor the entire region, at the summit of the Presidents of\r\nthe Rio Group, held in Cusco in May of this year, I\r\nmade the following proposal. I urged Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan to employ his good offices to give\r\na decisive boost to the peace process in Colombia. I\r\ncalled on the guerrilla movements operating in that\r\ncountry to sign a ceasefire agreement and to join an\r\nopen and transparent dialogue, accompanied by a\r\ntimetable with definite deadlines to be discussed and\r\napproved by the parties, in order to reach a lasting and\r\npeaceful solution to the Colombian conflict. That\r\nproposal was enthusiastically embraced by all the\r\npresidents of the Rio Group.\r\nThat unnecessary, fratricidal bloodshed is no\r\nlonger a problem limited to Colombia or even the\r\nAndean nations. It is a conflict that increasingly\r\nthreatens the peace and stability of the entire world. We\r\nmust take care and act immediately before the monster\r\nbecomes uncontrollable. Therefore, at this global\r\nforum, I ask for all free nations of the world not to\r\nremain passive but decisively to support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations in the search for lasting\r\npeace in Colombia.\r\nThe issue of external debt should cease to be\r\ntreated as a purely economic matter or as cold\r\nstatistics. It must be seriously examined for what it is, a\r\ngenuine human and social tragedy resulting from the\r\nimmense suffering it causes among innocent people. It\r\nis too heavy a burden, preventing the progress of poor\r\nbut serious countries such as Ecuador, which manages\r\nits public expenditures with great austerity and fiscal\r\ndiscipline at a very great social cost, in order to comply\r\nwith its international financial commitments. These\r\npoor but serious countries are making profound\r\nstructural reforms to bring order to salary, labour and\r\ntax arrangements. These poor but serious countries are\r\ncombating corruption, social injustice and impunity.\r\nThey are working tirelessly to put an end to the\r\nprivileges of a gilded bureaucracy and striving to\r\nmodernize their public corporations. But it is not\r\nenough: their merciless external debt absorbs the larger\r\npart of those efforts and savings.\r\nWe are not asking for gifts. We are people of\r\nhonour, and we will continue to honour our obligations.\r\nWe are only asking for the opportunity to grow, to\r\nbecome developed at a faster pace and to pay our debt,\r\nwhich otherwise could be perpetuated for eternity.\r\nHow can we achieve the minimum standards for\r\neducation, health, growth and social welfare that are\r\ncontained in the manuals of the United Nations if my\r\ncountry, Ecuador, must divert more than 40 per cent of\r\nits budget to servicing its foreign debt?\r\nExternal debt must be dealt with urgently and\r\nseriously; the alarming figures in that respect make this\r\nclear. It is imperative that a comprehensive, historic\r\nand humanitarian agreement be reached among debtors\r\nand creditors alike to reduce the burden on the budgets\r\nof our countries, so as to increase the availability of\r\nfunds for social investment, to overcome the obstacles\r\nand budget restrictions that are preventing us from\r\nmoving forward with social infrastructure projects.\r\nWe will continue to meet our external debt\r\npayments; we cannot speak of true democracy if we do\r\nnot pay the social debt. This is a tragedy and a source\r\nof weakness for democracy in poor but seriously\r\ncommitted countries such as Ecuador. This reality\r\nundermines democracy and democratic stability.\r\nOn the subject of migration, something important\r\nneeds to be said. Migratory flows along natural\r\nsurvival lines cannot be halted by physical or legal\r\nbarriers. In recent centuries, marked by colonialism,\r\nand during the first half of the twentieth century,\r\nmarked by wars, millions of people left their homes\r\nand went elsewhere to seek refuge in new lands, among\r\ngenerous people. That is why they came to America,\r\nand America lovingly opened its arms to them.\r\nLet me say to the people of the First World: now\r\nthat the flow is the other way around, now that your\r\nchildren and grandchildren are going elsewhere, we are\r\nwondering why you are not opening your doors to\r\nimmigrants. I would ask: if history, with its mysterious\r\ndeterminism, is carrying them again to other lands, will\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nthey able to cite humanitarian reasons, or the need for\r\nreciprocity, in order to be welcomed? On behalf of\r\nAmerica, let me say that we will once again receive\r\nothers.\r\nMy Government, through our Foreign Ministry, is\r\ncommitted to preparing the groundwork and creating\r\nconducive conditions for the thousands of Ecuadorians\r\nwho want to return home. They will be protected by\r\nbroad-based programmes that serve returnees. With\r\nrespect to those who decide to remain outside the\r\ncountry, we are endeavouring to secure temporary\r\nprotected status for the undocumented, allowing them\r\nto lead a life in conditions of normalcy and dignity.\r\nMy Government also is making tremendous\r\nefforts to secure capital and foreign investments in\r\norder to generate jobs and prevent our citizens from\r\nhaving to leave their country, while at the same time\r\nprotecting family unity.\r\nI have the honour of presiding over a Government\r\nthat is implementing a strategic plan that will allow\r\nEcuador to achieve and consolidate sustained economic\r\ngrowth. One of the fundamental tasks of my\r\nAdministration is the uprooting of corruption, because\r\nthat phenomenon has been enemy number one of\r\ndemocracy, and therefore of development and\r\nprosperity, for many people in our region.\r\nThe fight against corruption is priority number\r\none for my Administration’s plan. That is what I said\r\nduring my electoral campaign, and I am fulfilling my\r\npromise.\r\nA handful of people devoid of morals, taking\r\nadvantage of political and bureaucratic opportunities,\r\nseized Government funds and bank deposits. Now,\r\nusing their political connections, protected by\r\nprestigious, well-paid attorneys, and abusing the\r\ngenerosity of the countries giving them shelter, they are\r\nenjoying with impunity the money they stole from my\r\ncountry — a theft that destroyed not only our nation’s\r\neconomy but also shattered illusions and crushed\r\ndreams and self-esteem, as well as the right to a life in\r\nconditions of dignity for millions of Ecuadorians.\r\nTherefore, from this rostrum of honour and\r\nfreedom, of equality and democracy, I ask all nations\r\nthe world over and the judicial systems of those\r\ncountries where those people have taken shelter for\r\ntheir unconditional and immediate support in bringing\r\nabout the extradition of individuals wanted by\r\nEcuador’s judicial system, so that they can be tried\r\nfairly and transparently. I ask also for support in\r\nreturning to Ecuador those ill-gotten funds.\r\nWithin my country, 13 million Ecuadorians have\r\nmobilized to move forward and, under my leadership,\r\nhave, in eight months, made spectacular strides, as\r\nreflected by economic indicators. We have managed to\r\ncontrol inflation, ratcheting down inflation from 12.5\r\nper cent to 7.3 per cent a year, with forecasts for next\r\nyear of 4 per cent. The trade balance deficit has been\r\nreduced by 62 per cent when comparing the period\r\nJanuary-July 2002 with the relevant period for this\r\nyear.\r\nWe signed an agreement with the International\r\nMonetary Fund that opened to us the doors to\r\nmultinational credit organizations, and we have\r\nmanaged to open the nation to the world, with the\r\nresult that foreign direct investment increased 70 per\r\ncent between January and July 2003 over the same\r\nperiod in 2002. Oil exports have grown by 25 per cent,\r\nand non-oil exports by 12 per cent.\r\nConfidence in our country is evident because the\r\nfinancial system is functioning more smoothly. Total\r\ndeposits are steadily climbing, registering an increase\r\nof 6 per cent over the past six months. International\r\nmonetary reserves recorded a 35 per cent increase.\r\nExternal public debt, which amounted to 82 per cent of\r\ngross domestic product in 1999, has been reduced by\r\n41 per cent in 2003. Our country’s rating as a risk-\r\nfraught country has been significantly reduced. This is,\r\nwithout question, an achievement for my\r\nAdministration, because, through this indicator, the\r\ninternational economic community as a whole is thus\r\nshowing confidence in Ecuador.\r\nEcuador has great energy potential, with\r\nremaining reserves amounting to some 1.5 billion\r\nbarrels and in situ reserves amounting to approximately\r\n8.9 billion barrels.\r\nEcuador is opening itself to the world for\r\ninvestment in the energy sector. We are working on a\r\nvariety of large-, medium- and small-scale\r\nhydroelectric projects to double our current energy\r\npotential.\r\nThe current Administration is working for the\r\nfuture — not just for the period of my presidential term\r\nbut for the next 50 years. The mining sector has been\r\nextensively studied in recent years by the world’s\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nmajor mining companies, which reached the\r\ndetermination that Ecuador has vast potential.\r\nNow that my country is regaining its economic\r\nstability, my Administration has turned its attention to\r\nsocial development. This is an Administration that will\r\npay not only its external debt, but also the social\r\ndebt — the one that has struck hardest at our own\r\npeople.\r\nEcuador is a country of many resources, natural\r\nand human. It is opening itself to the world, to foreign\r\ninvestment. Indeed, investment is on the rebound,\r\nbecause foreign capital flows into our nation during the\r\nperiod January-July 2003 grew by 189 per cent over\r\nthe same period of the previous year. We need more\r\ninvestment in the oil, mining, hydroelectric, agro-\r\nindustrial, and tourist sectors.\r\nEcuador is a country with a touch of magic, with\r\nstunning natural panoramas, cultural diversity and\r\nvaried customs. Located at the centre of the world, in\r\nnorth-west South America, Ecuador has natural\r\ntreasures such as the Galapagos Islands, the exotic\r\nAmazon jungle and majestic volcanoes such as\r\nChimborazo and Cotopaxi.\r\nFinally, let me say that Ecuador’s international\r\npolicy is focused on working for sovereignty and is\r\nbased on the interests of the people whom I have the\r\nhonour to represent, in the framework of unswerving\r\nsupport for the rule of law.\r\nThe future of global society cannot be separated\r\nfrom the well-being of each of the peoples of the\r\nworld. If our global society is not just and equitable, if\r\npeople are not free to fight for their legitimate rights\r\nand to realize their aspirations, there will be no peace\r\nand we will be unable to defeat terrorism or to\r\neliminate poverty — the worst of human rights\r\nviolations.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Ecuador for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Lucio Gutiérrez Borbúa, President of the\r\nRepublic of Ecuador, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by General Pervez Musharraf, President of\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Islamic Republic of\r\nPakistan.\r\nGeneral Pervez Musharraf, President of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan, was escorted into\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency General Pervez Musharraf,\r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Musharraf: It is with great pleasure\r\nthat I extend to you, Mr. President, our warmest\r\nfelicitations on your election. I also congratulate your\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan, for his\r\neffective leadership during the previous session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe support Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s\r\nefforts to infuse a new sense of mission into the United\r\nNations and maintain the centrality of its role in the\r\npromotion of global peace and security. We pay tribute\r\nto the memory of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and the\r\nother United Nations officials who sacrificed their lives\r\nin the service of peace.\r\nWhen the Berlin Wall collapsed, hopes revived\r\nfor a new age of cooperation and peace, free from\r\nideological confrontations. Sadly, those hopes were\r\ndashed — by ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, and then in\r\nKosovo; by the failure to end the occupation of\r\nPalestine, leading to the revived intifada against Israeli\r\noccupation; by the brutal suppression of the Kashmiri’s\r\ndemand for self-determination and freedom from\r\nIndian occupation; by the unending war in Afghanistan\r\nand the international neglect which created a climate in\r\nwhich extremism and terrorism could breed; and by the\r\nseries of international financial crises and the rise of\r\npoverty as a consequence of unequal economic\r\nglobalization.\r\nThe terrible terrorist atrocity of 11 September\r\n2001 jolted the foundations of the international system.\r\nThe response has weakened al Qaeda, but it has not\r\neliminated its associates. Terrorists have struck\r\nrepeatedly around the world — in Indonesia, Tunisia,\r\nMorocco, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kenya and my country,\r\nPakistan.\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nThe tragedy of 11 September 2001 transformed\r\nsecurity policies and changed geopolitical calculations.\r\nPakistan took a strategic decision, based on our\r\nprinciples of humanity and national interest, to support\r\nthe war on terrorism. There should be no doubt\r\nwhatsoever about intentions. Our actions speak louder\r\nthan words. Our capabilities were limited, but they\r\nhave been progressively improved. We are acting\r\nagainst al Qaeda and its associates very effectively. We\r\nhave also acted against other organizations or groups\r\ninvolved in any form of terrorism. Pakistan will remain\r\nat the forefront of the war on terrorism.\r\nThe war against terrorism must be fought\r\ncomprehensively, on a global front, with vision and\r\nunderstanding. It should not erode the moral values of\r\nour societies. It must not be hijacked by those who\r\nseek to use it as an excuse to suppress other peoples.\r\nIt must not be allowed to engender a clash of\r\ncivilizations — a clash between Islam and the West.\r\nIt is unfortunate that great religions — which\r\nshould be a source of hope, tolerance and peace — are\r\nseen as being pitted against each other. Many Muslims\r\nbelieve their eternal faith is being demonized. They see\r\nMuslim peoples being cruelly suppressed for\r\ndemanding freedom and equality, or targeted for\r\ndiscrimination and worse. On the other hand, the West\r\nperceives the Islamic world as volatile and hostile, bent\r\nupon striking at Western values. Muslims are often\r\nseen as fanatics, extremists and terrorists.\r\nAgainst the background of this volatile milieu,\r\nthe recent war in Iraq evoked negative reactions in\r\nmost Arab and Islamic countries.\r\nThis moment in history calls for reflection,\r\nintrospection and action. The thesis of a clash of\r\ncivilizations is a travesty. We must bridge the gulf of\r\nmisunderstanding between Islam and the West. We\r\nmust be the catalysts of change, not the prophets of\r\ndoom.\r\nIslam is a faith of peace, harmony and justice.\r\nIslam is democracy in action. It upholds human rights,\r\nsocial equality, non-discrimination and freedom of\r\nspeech. The protection of minorities is an article of\r\nfaith in Islam. It does not discriminate on the basis of\r\ncolour, caste, creed or religion. Our faith is dynamic,\r\npromoting constant renewal and adaptation, through\r\nthe process of ijtihad — interpretation through\r\nconsultation. Islam’s vision is not trapped in any one\r\nperiod of history; it is modern and futuristic. Islam\r\nmust not be confused with the narrow vision of a few\r\nextremists.\r\nI believe the way forward is to adopt a two-\r\npronged — or double-pincer — strategy to build\r\nharmony, promote moderation, oppose extremism and\r\nensure justice. I call this the strategy of enlightened\r\nmoderation.\r\nOn the one hand, Muslim nations must assume\r\ntheir responsibility for internal reform and renewal.\r\nThey are at the crossroads. They must eschew\r\nextremism and confrontation. They must embrace the\r\nmarch of human civilization. They must address the\r\ndeficits in their social and economic development.\r\nThey must seek science and technology, higher\r\neducation and human resource development.\r\nThe international community — especially the\r\nadvanced countries of the West — must deliver the\r\nother pincer in this strategy of enlightened moderation.\r\nThey can do so by helping to resolve political disputes\r\nand situations in which Muslim peoples are being\r\nsuppressed, such as in Palestine and Kashmir; by\r\nrejecting attempts to equate terrorism with Islam; and\r\nby assisting the Muslim world in poverty alleviation\r\nand in socio-economic development. The United\r\nNations itself has a crucial role to play in the\r\nconception and execution of the strategy of enlightened\r\nmoderation.\r\nIn that context, it is clear that a consensus must\r\nbe quickly developed at the United Nations on ways to\r\nrestore Iraq’s stability, security and sovereignty. Iraq\r\ncannot be allowed to remain an open wound. That\r\nwould have an impact on the region and could inject a\r\nnew dimension into the campaign against terrorism and\r\nextremism. The consensus that is developed must\r\nenable the Iraqi people, through an inclusive political\r\nprocess, to determine the sequence of steps leading to a\r\nfully representative Iraqi Government and to an end to\r\noccupation. The Iraqi people should assume control of\r\ntheir resources and of their political destiny as soon as\r\npossible. They must receive the full support of the\r\ninternational community, including Iraq’s neighbours\r\nand the Arab and the Islamic countries, in building\r\nsecurity and in reconstructing their country. Pakistan\r\nwould be prepared to help in a collective United-\r\nNations-sanctioned Arab and Islamic effort to help the\r\nIraqi people, if they themselves wish us to do so.\r\nEndeavours to stabilize Iraq will be enhanced by\r\nprogress in promoting peace with justice in the Middle\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nEast. Hopes for a just and comprehensive peace were\r\naroused earlier this year by the Quartet’s road map;\r\nthose hopes have been progressively dimmed. But\r\nfailure is not an option at all. The fate of the\r\nPalestinian people is the principal factor in determining\r\npublic and political perceptions in the entire Islamic\r\nworld. It is only progress towards a just peace that can\r\nmarginalize the extremists. Therefore, we must revive\r\nfaithful implementation of the road map and must\r\nrealize the vision of two States, Palestine and Israel,\r\nliving side by side in peace within recognized\r\nboundaries.\r\nWe must ensure successful implementation of the\r\nBonn process in Afghanistan. The international\r\nstabilization force should be expanded and enlarged to\r\nensure security and control over all parts of\r\nAfghanistan by President Karzai’s Government.\r\nPakistan will continue to contribute to interdicting and\r\narresting al Qaeda and associated terrorists. We will\r\nfurther intensify our economic cooperation with\r\nAfghanistan. It is essential that Afghanistan’s territory\r\nnot be used by third countries for interference or for\r\nterrorism against Afghanistan’s neighbours.\r\nJammu and Kashmir has been rightly described as\r\nthe most dangerous dispute in the world. A just\r\nsolution of that dispute holds the key to peace and\r\nsecurity in South Asia. I am glad that India has stepped\r\nback from its dangerous and failed experiment in\r\ncoercive diplomacy last year. Despite some\r\nimprovement in the political atmosphere, India\r\ncontinues to suppress the legitimate struggle of the\r\nKashmiri people to exercise their right of self-\r\ndetermination, in accordance with Security Council\r\nresolutions. It refuses Pakistan’s offers of dialogue to\r\naddress and resolve the Kashmir dispute once and for\r\nall.\r\nIndia cites cross-border terrorism in order to\r\nreject dialogue. It knows full well that the Kashmiri\r\nstruggle is indigenous. India seeks to exploit the\r\ninternational anti-terrorist sentiment after 11 September\r\nto delegitimize the Kashmiri freedom struggle. On the\r\ncontrary, it is India which violates international law by\r\nrefusing to implement Security Council resolutions and\r\nby perpetrating gross and consistent violations of\r\nhuman rights in Kashmir.\r\nOnce again, from this rostrum, I invite India to\r\njoin Pakistan in a sustained dialogue to resolve the\r\nKashmir dispute. I am convinced that, with goodwill,\r\nwe can find a just solution which is acceptable to India,\r\nto Pakistan and, above all, to the people of Kashmir. I\r\nalso invite India, jointly with Pakistan, to observe a\r\ncomplete ceasefire along the Line of Control in\r\nKashmir.\r\nPakistan would also be prepared to encourage a\r\ngeneral cessation of violence within Kashmir involving\r\nreciprocal obligations and restraints on Indian forces\r\nand on the Kashmir freedom movement. And, may I\r\nadd, if India is genuinely concerned about infiltration\r\nacross the Line of Control, we ask that it agree to a\r\nviable mechanism to monitor such infiltration on both\r\nsides of the Line. The United Nations Military\r\nObserver Group in India and Pakistan could be\r\nenlarged for that very purpose.\r\nApart from addressing Kashmir, sustainable\r\nsecurity in South Asia requires India and Pakistan to\r\ninstitute measures to ensure mutual nuclear restraint\r\nand a conventional-arms balance. Unfortunately, India\r\nhas embarked on a massive build-up of its conventional\r\nand non-conventional military capabilities — advanced\r\noffensive aircraft, ballistic and cruise missiles, anti-\r\nballistic-missile systems, nuclear submarines and an\r\naircraft carrier. That will destabilize South Asia and\r\nerode strategic deterrence. Those Powers which desire\r\npeace, stability and security in South Asia, and oppose\r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, must\r\nreview their decisions to offer such major strategic-\r\nweapons systems to India. They must contribute to\r\nmaintaining arms restraint and a military balance in\r\nSouth Asia.\r\nThe crises and conflicts of the past decade have\r\nenhanced, not diminished, the relevance of the United\r\nNations. The United Nations remains the central forum\r\nfor dialogue and diplomacy, and it must be\r\nstrengthened. The Security Council must be made more\r\nrepresentative by increasing the number of non-\r\npermanent members. New permanent members will\r\nonly expand inequality. States which occupy and\r\nsuppress other peoples, and defy the resolutions of the\r\nCouncil, have absolutely no credentials to aspire to\r\npermanent Security Council membership.\r\nWe are on the cusp of a new millennium. It is a\r\ndecisive moment in history. We must decide whether to\r\nflow with the currents that threaten confrontation and\r\nthe collapse of civilizations, or to muster the collective\r\nwill to chart the course of history towards a peaceful\r\nand cooperative global society. The leaders assembled\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nhere bear an enormous responsibility to rescue our\r\nworld from war and violence, poverty and pestilence;\r\nto redress inequity and impoverishment, which breed\r\ndespair and destruction; and finally, to collectively\r\nconstruct a new global architecture of peace and\r\nprosperity for all peoples and all nations.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Pakistan for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Pervez Musharraf, President of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Pakistan, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Vicente Fox, President of the United\r\nMexican States\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the United Mexican States.\r\nMr. Vicente Fox, President of the United Mexican\r\nStates, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Vicente Fox, President of\r\nthe United Mexican States, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Fox (spoke in Spanish): Allow me at\r\nthe outset to express my pleasure at seeing in the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly a representative of\r\nthe Group of Latin American and Caribbean States. I\r\nwould ask you, Sir, to extend my greetings to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, along with our full\r\nrecognition of his leadership, which has given this\r\ninstitution of ours a new impetus. I would also ask you\r\nto convey to him and to the entire staff of the United\r\nNations our condolences over the death of Mr. Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello.\r\nWe live in a world of fragile and perilous\r\nbalances, the result of our collective inability to\r\nachieve genuine peace and shared well-being in the\r\ncontext of international legality. We are confronting\r\ntoday an economic globalization that is triggering\r\nimbalances to the detriment of developing countries,\r\nparticularly the poorest. We are also confronting a\r\nglobalization of violence, suffering the threats of\r\nterrorism as well as the war against it, and international\r\norganized crime that weakens public security and\r\njeopardizes world peace.\r\nWe share these problems along with the\r\nresponsibility to find a solution to them. No country,\r\nlarge or small, can overcome alone either the\r\nchallenges of the present or those that will have to be\r\nmet successfully in the future. The attitude that will be\r\nessential in the face of threats to international peace,\r\nsecurity and development is that of responsibility\r\nshared among all nations.\r\nMexico knows that we, the peoples of the United\r\nNations, can together ensure that hunger, intolerance,\r\nexclusion, crime and illegitimacy are banished once\r\nand for all. Together, we can guarantee every\r\nindividual the right to live in human dignity and the\r\nright of future generations to grow, develop and\r\ncontribute to the history of human civilization. In our\r\nMillennium Declaration, we have an irreplaceable\r\nguide on how to meet the challenges of the present and\r\nthe future.\r\nMexico has made significant progress in terms of\r\ndemocracy, freedoms, gender equity, respect for\r\nminority groups, health and education, and particularly\r\nin reducing poverty and improving income distribution,\r\nas reflected in the resolute and rapid advances we have\r\nmade towards the attainment of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. We have come one third of the\r\nway towards achieving those goals in the past two\r\nyears alone and we shall have essentially attained them\r\nby 2010, well before the target date of 2015.\r\nThough Mexican men and women will not be\r\nsatisfied merely by achieving those goals, we know we\r\nare on the right track. Now is the time not for us to\r\nshrink from challenges, but rather to be hopeful about\r\nour joint labours and our work as a team. We feel the\r\nsame about the international situation as we do about\r\nthe national context.\r\nConvinced therefore of the validity, usefulness\r\nand relevance of our Organization, Mexico appeals\r\nfrom this supreme global forum for shared international\r\nresponsibility. This Assembly, the most representative\r\nbody of humankind, is the most appropriate forum in\r\nwhich to call for collective action. Here the major\r\ninternational problems have been discussed, and here\r\ndialogue has been made the cornerstone of the effort to\r\nfind solutions. Here, therefore, we must focus our\r\nefforts on achieving shared peace, security and\r\ndevelopment.\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nThis is the first general debate of our Assembly\r\nsince the Iraq war. Our Organization is at a critical and\r\ncrucial juncture. The attacks on the United Nations in\r\nBaghdad have harmed our Organization and hurt us all.\r\nAn attack on the United Nations is an attack on all its\r\nMembers. The events in Iraq sparked a debate that\r\nranks among the most far-reaching in the life of the\r\nUnited Nations. As a non-permanent member of the\r\nSecurity Council and, above all, assuming its\r\nresponsibility as a member of the world community,\r\nMexico has been faithful to the principle of seeking the\r\npacific settlement of disputes, in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter.\r\nWe have been actively and constructively\r\ninvolved in negotiating resolutions and are convinced\r\nthat they will lead to the swift restoration of full\r\nsovereignty and independence for the Iraqi people. One\r\nof the top priorities of our Organization is to give\r\nimpetus to the process of restoring sovereignty,\r\nresulting in the establishment of a representative\r\nGovernment for Iraqi men and women.\r\nThe debate over the issue of Iraq requires us to\r\nact upon our commitments and change the way we\r\nthink about when the use of force is legitimate, in\r\naccordance with the Charter. It is vitally important that\r\nwe review States’ commitments to abide by\r\ninternational law and the existing machinery to ensure\r\ncompliance with Security Council resolutions. The\r\nagreements reached and reforms achieved will greatly\r\nand profoundly determine the future effectiveness of\r\nthe United Nations and proper functioning of the\r\ncollective decision-making processes that underpin the\r\nmultilateral approach.\r\nAbove and beyond Iraq, the world is closely\r\nfollowing many other major challenges. As we have\r\nnoted today, the unfinished job of peace-making in the\r\nMiddle East, Afghanistan, Africa and the Balkans\r\nimplies new threats and challenges to international\r\nsecurity. A particular source of concern is the increase\r\nin tensions in Asia, in light of the development of\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nWe have always been a nation committed to\r\npeace, convinced that dialogue, negotiation and the law\r\nare effective conflict-resolution instruments. Today, we\r\nreaffirm that it is time to give special emphasis to\r\ndiplomatic action and to work together to meet\r\ncommon challenges. In view of the world’s present\r\npotential for destruction, it is time for us to ensure that\r\ndiplomacy and negotiation get priority attention with\r\nregard to international disputes. Reaffirming the\r\nprinciples and values that govern our actions on the\r\ninternational scene, Mexico is appealing for peace and\r\nglobal cooperation so that, together, we can effectively\r\nfoster international peace, security and development.\r\nHistory teaches us that, unless great economic\r\nand social disparities, injustice, discrimination,\r\nintolerance and lack of international cooperation are\r\naddressed, we will continue to endure current threats\r\nsuch as terrorism. Mexico is unequivocally committed\r\nto combating terrorism. Combating it effectively\r\nrequires not only better and more intense international\r\ncooperation but also new approaches to international\r\nlegality. The fight against terrorism will not be\r\neffective without a new recognition of international law\r\nand a United Nations system that has sufficient\r\ncapacity to ensure compliance with it.\r\nWe must confront this and other challenges by\r\nadopting a holistic view of our responsibility for\r\nmaintaining and restoring peace in the world today,\r\nwhile tackling the structural causes of conflicts. To\r\nmeet those challenges will require sustained conflict-\r\nprevention capacity, the mobilization of political will\r\nand a strategically targeted commitment of resources.\r\nSuch a perspective can be contributed only by\r\nthis universal Organization, the only such body with\r\nthe legitimacy, experience, capacity to convene peoples\r\nand the moral force to concert our efforts for the sake\r\nof peace and universal well-being. The response to the\r\nglobal challenges facing us requires a robust political\r\neffort on the part of all nations — an effort that is\r\npossible solely from within these halls.\r\nAs a nation that has always done its utmost to\r\nattain the noble objectives of the United Nations and\r\nconvinced of the relevance of the principles and values\r\nthat gave rise to this Organization, Mexico renews its\r\nfirm commitment to the United Nations and its ideals.\r\nSecurity cannot be built based on barriers or\r\nignorance. True security and lasting peace among\r\nnations is based on mutual understanding and a\r\ndemonstrated belief in equal treatment for all\r\nnations — ideals that have developed over time within\r\nthis Organization.\r\nThe relevance of this Organization is undeniable.\r\nMexico reaffirms its confidence in multilateral\r\narrangements. We have associated ourselves with the\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nappeal by the Secretary-General to put forward\r\ninnovative ideas and approaches geared towards\r\nreforming the United Nations. We agree with the\r\nSecretary-General’s view that the international system\r\nis in crisis and with his appeal for fundamental reform\r\nof the United Nations. Members can rest assured that\r\nMexico will make every diplomatic effort to reform\r\nand update our Organization, which the international\r\nsituation necessitates. Mexico considers that real\r\nreform must be based on five specific guidelines.\r\nThe first is to strengthen our collective security\r\nsystem to ensure rapid responses to crises and\r\ntransparent collective decision-making. The second is\r\nto guarantee support for economic and social\r\ndevelopment of States, particularly for the least-\r\ndeveloped. The third is to guarantee respect for the\r\nsovereignty and independence of States while assuring\r\nat the same time the legitimacy and legality of\r\ninternational efforts to combat impunity. The fourth is\r\nto promote and protect human rights. The fifth is to\r\nincrease the effectiveness of decision-making.\r\nWe must revitalize the commitment that States\r\nand nations make to observing universal norms.\r\nReforms must concentrate on the performance of our\r\nmultilateral system. The work of the Security Council\r\ndemonstrates this need. Without question, debate over\r\nits composition involves the need to make it more\r\nrepresentative and thus increase its legitimacy.\r\nAlthough the central issue is the functioning of the\r\nSecurity Council and respect for its resolutions, the\r\ndiscussions of the past decade have focused on\r\nexpanding the membership and selecting new\r\npermanent members.\r\nThere is little worth in considering a Council with\r\na larger membership if the resolutions that it issues are\r\nnot respected or if they lack a common interpretation\r\nof the scope of their provisions. We must ensure the\r\nright kind of representativeness, limit and regulate the\r\nright of veto and call for greater transparency and for\r\ncreating a more balanced relationship with the other\r\norgans of the United Nations system, particularly the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe must ensure that the Council does not exceed\r\nits competencies or shirk its responsibilities. Let us\r\nthink democratically. Let us seek a balance between the\r\nmain organs of the United Nations. Let us dare to\r\nachieve a reform of the General Assembly that will\r\ninclude safeguarding its quality as a universal,\r\nparliamentary forum, without abandoning its ability for\r\ndecision-making and acting in a timely manner. Let us\r\nthink of a new type of collective security system that is\r\neffective and balanced, which would function under the\r\nguidance of our democratic body par excellence — the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nInertia has caused each main organ of our\r\nOrganization to act in a manner that is removed from\r\nthe main purposes and objectives of the United\r\nNations. The development agenda must be better linked\r\nto conflict prevention and peace-building activities\r\nmust include mechanisms to ensure economic and\r\nsocial development. For that reason, we must also think\r\nabout how to strengthen the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and about whether we can and should turn it\r\ninto an economic and social security council.\r\nMexico believes that reform should bring the\r\nUnited Nations into line with the requirements of an\r\never-changing world, in order to help us to overcome\r\nthe existing gaps and fresh challenges. Today, faithful\r\nto the principles, values and ideals of our Organization,\r\nwe have the obligation to build a new international\r\narchitecture, which, with a vision for the future, leaves\r\nfratricidal conflicts and struggles behind, opens new\r\navenues of understanding and international cooperation\r\nand forges new paths towards peace, international\r\nsecurity and development.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the United\r\nMexican States for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Vicente Fox, President of the United Mexican\r\nStates, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nMr. Acosta Bonilla (Honduras), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Gerhard Schroeder, Chancellor\r\nof the Federal Republic of Germany\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by Mr. Gerhard\r\nSchroeder, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of\r\nGermany.\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nMr. Gerhard Schroeder, Chancellor of the\r\nFederal Republic of Germany, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency the Chancellor of the\r\nFederal Republic of Germany, Mr. Gerhard Schroeder,\r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Schroeder (Germany) (spoke in German;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I wish to\r\nbegin by congratulating the President, on his election\r\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nsession and wish him every success with his work. I\r\nalso wish to thank his predecessor, President Kavan,\r\nfor the dedication with which he presided over the\r\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\r\nI also wish to endorse the statements made by the\r\nItalian presidency on behalf of the European Union.\r\nThis year is a special one for Germany’s work\r\nwithin the United Nations. History is both a reminder\r\nand a guide for us. Thirty years ago, on 18 September\r\n1973, the United Nations welcomed Germany back into\r\nthe fold of the family of nations. My predecessor,\r\nFederal Chancellor Willy Brandt, paved the way for\r\nthat move. His standing as an anti-fascist inspired\r\nconfidence for Germany. His passionate commitment to\r\ninternationalism went far beyond the policy of détente\r\nin the then East-West conflict.\r\nIn 1980 he made an urgent appeal to the\r\ncommunity of States with a report entitled “North-\r\nSouth, A Programme for Survival”. He wrote:\r\n“The globalization of the dangers resulting from\r\nwars, chaos and self-destruction calls for a\r\ndomestic policy that goes far beyond national\r\nborders.”\r\nWe are strongly committed to this task, and I\r\nthink that we Germans are not the only ones who are\r\ncommitted to it, because, as I said, history is our guide.\r\nIt guides us towards intensive international\r\ncooperation, of course under the auspices of the United\r\nNations, that we must strengthen through courageous\r\nreforms. It guides us towards a universal order based\r\non the rule of law and human dignity, on good,\r\nresponsible governance and prosperity that is truly\r\nshared by all people. It also guides us towards security\r\nand peace through comprehensive prevention. We must\r\nact resolutely by pursuing an effective multilateral\r\nstrategy wherever peace is threatened and human rights\r\nare violated. But we must act just as resolutely to\r\nprevent conflict and create stable structures so that\r\npeople can lead their lives in freedom and tolerance\r\nwith one another.\r\nThirty years ago, Germany was a country with\r\nlimited sovereignty, divided by the Iron Curtain. Today,\r\nGermany is a sovereign nation, a civil Power in the\r\nheart of a united Europe. We live in a common area of\r\nfreedom, the rule of law, prosperity and social\r\nresponsibility. This goes to show that development\r\ntowards justice and peace is indeed possible and we\r\nshall not cease to support endeavours to that end\r\nanywhere in the world, be it in the Middle East, in\r\nAfrica or in any other crisis area. Bearing in mind our\r\nown history, we are indeed assuming responsibility for\r\na cooperative policy of peace. This we do by\r\nemploying economic, political and humanitarian\r\nmeans.\r\nBut we are also assuming military responsibility,\r\nshoulder to shoulder with our partners in NATO and\r\nthe European Union, where there is absolutely no other\r\nway to secure peace and protect human beings. Today,\r\nmore than 9,000 members of the German armed forces\r\nand police are deployed on international peace\r\nmissions. Our top priority is our commitment to peace\r\nin Afghanistan. Germany is willing to maintain its\r\ncommitment there in the long term and we are ready to\r\nincrease it beyond its present scope. The basis for such\r\ncommitment is the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nIn the Unification Treaty, Germany vowed that it\r\nwould only deploy its armed forces within the\r\nframework of this Charter. The Charter provides us\r\nwith “the necessary building blocks to ensure that our\r\ncommon humanity is an inclusive one, built on values\r\nsuch as tolerance and dignity”. These were the words\r\nof Sergio Vieira de Mello, who on 19 August 2003 fell\r\nvictim to an underhanded criminal attack in Baghdad.\r\nHe was killed along with 22 others, including many\r\nmembers of the United Nations staff working for the\r\npeople of Iraq and their hopes of a better future.\r\nWe are deeply affected by their deaths and must\r\nhonour them by taking on their legacy. Our response\r\nmust be to strengthen the role and commitment of the\r\nUnited Nations in Iraq. Only the United Nations can\r\nguarantee the legitimacy required to enable the people\r\nof Iraq to speedily rebuild their country under an\r\nindependent, representative Government. Germany\r\nstands ready to support such a process. We are ready to\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nprovide humanitarian, technical and economic\r\nassistance and could also train Iraqi security personnel.\r\nInternational terrorism, failing States and the\r\ndangers posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction all threaten our joint security. The obvious\r\nquestion is: What must be done to truly enhance\r\nsecurity? We must capture the terrorists and their\r\nmasters and destroy their infrastructure. There can be\r\nno doubt that we must prevent any further proliferation\r\nof nuclear weapons. We must strengthen the\r\ninspections regimes and pursue a policy of controlled\r\ndisarmament.\r\nBut as we know from history, as well as our own\r\nexperience, to follow any strategy focused narrowly on\r\nthe military and the police would be a recipe for\r\nfailure. Rather, what is needed is to address the root\r\ncauses of terrorism and insecurity. To combat\r\nfanaticism, we must ensure social and material as well\r\nas cultural security. That can only be achieved on the\r\nbasis of a broad concept of security. If we want to\r\noutlaw infamy we must put an end to lawlessness. That\r\nis the core task, indeed, of the international courts of\r\njustice and especially the International Criminal Court.\r\nIn order to win hearts and minds for freedom,\r\npeace and an open society, we must help people to\r\nacquire a greater stake in society, build better lives for\r\nthem and provide them with a secure environment.\r\nAfghanistan is a good example of this. There, the\r\ninternational community succeeded in liberating the\r\nAfghan people from the scourge of the Taliban and\r\nal Qaeda.\r\nAt the same time, the Petersberg Conference on\r\nAfghanistan, held in Bonn under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations, created a political framework for\r\nrebuilding the country. This process needs our\r\ncontinued support. There must also be sustained\r\ninternational commitment to the task of strengthening\r\nsecurity. In the long run, the fight against terrorism can\r\nbe won only if people see that it produces tangible\r\nbenefits in their everyday lives. They need to\r\nexperience at first hand that being once again part of\r\nthe international community means not only greater\r\nfreedom and more security, but also entails better\r\ndevelopment opportunities and a greater stake in\r\nsociety.\r\nThere is no doubt that we have already made\r\nmajor strides towards realizing our common goals\r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. More\r\ncountries than ever before now have democratic\r\nGovernments. Our concerted efforts have enabled more\r\npeople than ever before to put poverty behind them.\r\nBut we must note that the gap between the world’s rich\r\nand poor has still not been closed and the fight against\r\nhunger, injustice and oppression is still far from won.\r\nFor this reason, eradicating poverty remains an\r\nimperative of our policy for peace and stability.\r\nThere has been a drastic reduction in the number\r\nof wars fought between States. In the Balkans, for\r\nexample, resolute action by NATO and the United\r\nNations enabled us to put an end to certain wars and\r\nprevent others from breaking out in the first place.\r\nNevertheless, our world has become — and not just\r\nsince the barbaric terrorist attacks in New York and\r\nWashington or indeed Bali, Casablanca, Moscow or\r\nDjerba — a dramatically more insecure place. New\r\nthreats that no country in the world can tackle\r\neffectively on its own, make international cooperation\r\nmore vital than ever before. Such threats also require\r\nnew strategies and that is why we are all called upon to\r\nreview whether the instruments available to the United\r\nNations are still appropriate for tackling these new\r\nchallenges. We all have a responsibility to ensure that\r\npeople and their rights are also protected in situations\r\nother than inter-State wars. They must be protected\r\nfrom genocide and the consequences of random\r\nviolence as well. A political commitment to\r\ncomprehensive prevention must further strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations monopoly on the use of force as well as\r\nthe institutions of international law.\r\nWithin the United Nations we need to muster the\r\nstrength to launch overdue institutional reforms. My\r\nGovernment fully and wholeheartedly supports the\r\nproposals made by the Secretary-General. We must\r\nagree how to ensure in the future an even better\r\nallocation of abilities, skills and scarce resources. I\r\nalso share the view of the Secretary-General that the\r\nlegitimacy of the Security Council depends on how\r\nwell it represents all nations and all regions. It is true\r\nthat the Council must be reformed and enlarged. First\r\nand foremost, it must also include more representatives\r\nof the developing countries. Let me reiterate that in the\r\ncontext of such reform Germany is ready to assume\r\ngreater responsibility.\r\nThe world of the twenty-first century offers us, its\r\ninhabitants, ample scope for change, for better or\r\nworse. Given the wealth of opportunities and the\r\nimmense dangers ahead, we have no choice but to\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nstrive for greater international partnership and expand\r\nand strengthen multilateralism. We will only be able to\r\nmake our world a more secure place if we can also\r\nmake it more fair and equitable. It was for that very\r\npurpose, after all, that the international community\r\ncreated the United Nations. That is its mandate. Let us\r\njoin together to make the United Nations even stronger.\r\nLet us make sure that it can fulfil its mandate to\r\nmaintain international peace and security and that it\r\ncan achieve greater justice for all.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nChancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Gerhard Schroeder, Chancellor of the\r\nFederal Republic of Germany, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Carlos Mesa Gisbert,\r\nConstitutional Vice-President of the Republic\r\nof Bolivia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the\r\nConstitutional Vice-President of the Republic of\r\nBolivia.\r\nMr. Carlos Mesa Gisbert, Constitutional Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Bolivia, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Carlos\r\nMesa Gisbert, Constitutional Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic of Bolivia, and inviting him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Mesa Gisbert (Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAllow me to congratulate the President on his election\r\nas President of this session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe wish him every success.\r\nAt the same time, it is a pleasure to greet the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, whose efforts for\r\npeace and cooperation between nations we highly\r\nvalue. For that reason, I take this opportunity to\r\nexpress, on behalf of the people of Bolivia and my\r\nGovernment, our sorrow and solidarity in the face of\r\nthe terrorist attacks against the United Nations\r\nheadquarters in Baghdad, which once again\r\ndemonstrates intolerance for and lack of understanding\r\nof a peacekeeping mission, which is the only possible\r\npath in our search to resolve conflicts.\r\nThis attempt strengthens our resolve to fight\r\nwithout giving any quarter against terrorism in any of\r\nits forms, but, at the same time, it shows us the need to\r\nsupport the joint efforts of the nations of the world\r\nwith policies that are debated and adopted at the United\r\nNations. This Organization and its bodies are a\r\nfundamental forum where our voice and that of all\r\ncountries of the world can be heard. For that reason, we\r\nalso believe that reforms are required to give the\r\nSecurity Council more flexibility and balance in order\r\nto guarantee greater participation in the decision-\r\nmaking process.\r\nThe terrible episodes that we have recently\r\nexperienced have forced us once again to reconsider\r\nthe path that many nations have set for themselves in\r\ntheir vision for development. It is a dangerous mistake\r\nto believe that we can coexist in a world of isolated and\r\nclosed compartments. It is not possible to generate\r\ngrowth and well-being for a privileged few and expect\r\nthat the excluded great majority will look on silently\r\nfrom the fringes of that reality. In our opinion, the only\r\npossible path to confront the future is the paradigm of\r\nequity.\r\nFor over a half century, Bolivia has been opening\r\ndemocratic and participative spaces for its people. A\r\nnation such as ours, where 62 per cent of the citizens\r\nidentify themselves as indigenous, must do away with\r\nthe social, economic and ethnic exclusion that has been\r\na historic millstone that our elite refused to eliminate.\r\nThe process begun by us with the revolution of 1952\r\nwith its successes and set-backs of greater or lesser\r\nmagnitude is part of our challenge today. This vision is\r\nalso essential to defending the human rights of those\r\ncitizens who have been marginalized throughout the\r\ncourse of our history.\r\nFor one year now, under the administration\r\nheaded by President Sanchez de Lozada, within the\r\nframework of a pluralistic Congress with a very\r\nsignificant percentage of indigenous representatives\r\nand of very different ideological positions, we are\r\nworking to overcome levels of poverty that are\r\nthreatening to break down the buttresses of order and\r\nthe population’s faith in democracy, which has been\r\nachieved with great sacrifice by the people of Bolivia.\r\nOur Government has broadened its political base\r\nby integrating another political party, Nueva Fuerza\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nRepublicana, into the alliance between the Movimiento\r\nNacionalista Revolucionario and the Movimiento de la\r\nIzquierda Revolucionaria in an effort to face an acute\r\neconomic crisis that has taken the form of a persistent\r\nrecession, which, fortunately, is beginning to reverse\r\nitself.\r\nWe have implemented a programme that\r\ncombines efforts to increase State revenues through an\r\nincrease in public investment in order to stimulate the\r\neconomy and improve private contribution, create jobs\r\nand decrease social inequality. We have given priority\r\nto the most vulnerable sectors of our society with\r\nmeasures such as an annual solidarity bonus for all\r\ncitizens over age 65 and the consolidation of free\r\nmedical insurance covering mothers and children under\r\nthe age of five. This task is linked to achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, to which we are\r\ndeeply committed.\r\nIn February of this year and a few days ago, my\r\ncountry lived through serious episodes of violence,\r\nwhich have forced us to reflect. We are aware of the\r\nfact that the last 21 years of democracy — the longest\r\nuninterrupted period in our history — are at stake as\r\nwe face the legitimate pressure exercised by the\r\nmarginalized sectors of our society, who deserve our\r\nattention. Unfortunately, in spite of the new democratic\r\nparliamentary participation, we have not yet been able\r\nto sustain a real and enriching dialogue about our most\r\nsevere problems. I am convinced that one of our\r\nprincipal tasks is to generate a fundamental change in\r\nthe behaviour of political parties and of every\r\npolitician, but a less radical and more rational attitude\r\nof the social sectors in their relationship with the State\r\nis also indispensable.\r\nWe are going through a very difficult time, when\r\ncompliance with the law and respect for the authority\r\nof the State threaten to collapse. Loss of trust in these\r\nessential elements of democracy is one of the greatest\r\ndangers to the future of our society, which will only\r\nachieve its goals if it has a credible and legitimate\r\nadministration that acts with authority. We are\r\nassuming our responsibility in this area. It is the only\r\nway we can be tolerant of the ideas of others. Our aim\r\nis the urgent search for a true national encounter\r\nthrough national dialogue, an issue that we are deeply\r\ncommitted to, despite the difficulties that must be\r\novercome.\r\nOne year ago, in this very forum, I said that our\r\nGovernment would make the fight against corruption a\r\nState policy. Today I am proud to say that we are\r\nfulfilling that commitment. We have established the\r\nSecretariat to Combat Corruption, whose tasks are\r\ncarried out from within the very core of the State, with\r\nbroad participation from all levels of society, through\r\ncitizen networks and mobile brigades. In one year of\r\nwork, we have made public cases of corruption\r\ninvolving State authorities. Corrupt civil servants have\r\nbeen given prison sentences and others are currently on\r\ntrial for illicit acts. Furthermore, we have expanded the\r\nprogrammes for better management of public entities.\r\nWe are launching a reform of the judiciary,\r\nstrengthening a culture in which the rule of law is\r\nbased on the concept of justice for all. We are also\r\npromoting a strategy that will transform political and\r\nproductive institutions, especially those of the informal\r\nsector, and promoting governance that is compatible\r\nwith fair human development opportunities.\r\nOur commitment to fighting illicit drug\r\ntrafficking remains unchanged. For our country, this\r\ntask has meant high social, political and economic\r\ncosts, paid for with the blood of the Bolivian people.\r\nThe support of the international community in this\r\nfight has been an incentive and a security factor.\r\nHowever, our efforts require further support,\r\nproportional to the scope of its effect, in Bolivia as\r\nwell as in those societies where drug consumption\r\nremains a priority problem to be solved. We shall\r\ncontinue to honour our commitments, but we shall also\r\ncontinue to insist that the international community\r\nfully assume the concept of shared responsibility.\r\nFor Bolivia, international assistance represents an\r\ninvaluable support. From this rostrum, I wish to thank\r\nthe nations and organizations that offer their\r\ncooperation, but I emphasize the fact that the most\r\neffective assistance is that which respects the decisions\r\nand plans of those countries that receive it. Imposing\r\nrigid and unilateral prescriptions often generates more\r\nproblems than it solves.\r\nOur continent, Latin America, has seen its role in\r\nthe international concert diminished. The continent\r\nfaces several core problems, one of which is the siege\r\nof its own democracy by poverty, corruption, inequality\r\nand a globalization process of which it is part, but that\r\nhas not always generated positive results for the area.\r\nIntegration is the only possible solution if we wish to\r\nface the future with optimism. Bolivia is working\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\ndiligently in this direction, not only because it is a part\r\nof subregional blocs, such as the Andean Community\r\nand the Common Market of the South — of which it is\r\nan associate member — but also because it promotes\r\nthe integration of both regional groups into one South\r\nAmerican body that will provide greater benefits and\r\ntargeted influence in the region. As hosts for the\r\nthirteenth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State\r\nand Government, Bolivia is working for the genuine\r\nstrengthening of that mechanism, which unites the\r\nheads of State and Government of a group of countries\r\nwhose cultural, political and economic importance\r\nthroughout the world is continuously growing.\r\nIn this context, the decisions that will be made to\r\nestablish the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas\r\nmust seek a still uncertain balance for the group of\r\nmember countries, taking into account the enormous\r\ngap between the first Power in the world and the\r\npoorest nations of the continent, in a way that will truly\r\nbenefit everybody. This will be possible if and when,\r\nbeyond trade issues, we prioritize the transport and\r\ncommunications infrastructures, science, the transfer of\r\ntechnology and education.\r\nThe difficulties emerging from the worldwide\r\ndebate on international trade are proof once again of\r\nthe gap to be closed between rich and poor nations. If\r\nequity is the foremost exigency of mankind, the only\r\ntrue and effective response in order to achieve it is a\r\nfair trade agreement. Poor countries demand access for\r\nour products to wealthy countries under fair conditions.\r\nThis urgent claim is linked to a sustained policy of\r\nsubsidies and protectionism for key production sectors\r\non the part of the most developed nations. Herein lies\r\none of the basic causes of poverty and social tensions\r\nin the least favoured societies.\r\nThe issue of anti-personnel mines is a very\r\nsensitive one for Bolivia, not only as a matter of\r\nprinciple — inasmuch as these lethal artefacts continue\r\nto kill or permanently maim people throughout the\r\nworld — but also because many such mines have been\r\nplanted along our borders. We vehemently request the\r\nGovernments responsible for planting these mines to\r\ncontinue their removal and destruction until the areas\r\ninvolved are totally free of mines.\r\nToday, more than ever, I wish to confirm before\r\nthis Assembly that Bolivia will never waive its just\r\nclaim of sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean,\r\ninasmuch as we were established as an independent\r\nrepublic with a sea coast. This claim, which we have\r\nbeen making for over a century, is a product not of\r\nstubbornness or caprice, but of the lack of economic\r\nresources and huge geographic obstacles that\r\nundermine our ability to compete. Our landlocked\r\ncondition is a deterrent to our growth and the well-\r\nbeing of our citizens, as proven by the analysis of the\r\nchallenges faced by all landlocked countries.\r\nReintegration of our condition as a maritime nation is a\r\nmatter of justice and we cannot set it aside. We will\r\ntherefore continue to call for solidarity and support\r\nfrom the community of nations. Our vocation and our\r\ndestiny to be integrated with and economically\r\ncomplemented by our neighbours compels us to exhort\r\nthe Government and people of Chile to act with a view\r\nto the future and to repair a historical wrong that has\r\nanchored Bolivia to the past century.\r\nWe are living through difficult times, complex\r\nand full of uncertainty. It is our obligation to stop and\r\nquestion the validity of many of the premises in which\r\nwe believe. No question and no form of questioning is\r\nsuperfluous at a time such as this, in which the search\r\nfor a clearer and fair horizon is a life or death necessity\r\nfor our planet.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nConstitutional Vice-President of the Republic of\r\nBolivia for his statement.\r\nMr. Carlos Mesa Gisbert, Constitutional Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Bolivia, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Li Zhaoxing,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of China.\r\nMr. Li Zhaoxing (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nPlease allow me warmly to congratulate Mr. Hunte, on\r\nhis assumption of the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. I would also like\r\nto thank Mr. Jan Kavan for his valuable contribution as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its last session.\r\nI also take this opportunity to express my\r\nheartfelt condolences on the recent tragic deaths in\r\nBaghdad of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, and\r\nother United Nations staff members.\r\nThe twenty-first century is about to complete its\r\nthird year, with hope and distress coexisting side by\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nside. Peace and development remain the overriding\r\nthemes of the times and the shared aspirations of\r\npeople of all races, colours and nationalities. The\r\nconcept of democracy and equality has planted deep\r\nroots in the hearts of the people. The shared\r\nconfrontation of global challenges through stronger\r\ncoordination and cooperation has become the\r\nconsensus of the international community.\r\nCountries are increasingly closer in their\r\neconomic relations. Advanced means of\r\ncommunications have made it possible to share\r\ninformation in real time. With their interests closely\r\nconnected and intertwined, countries are finding\r\nthemselves more and more like passengers in the same\r\nboat. Regional cooperation has grown substantially in\r\nboth depth and scope, with cooperation mechanisms\r\ntaking shape at various levels. Regional economic\r\nintegration is forging ahead in many parts of the world.\r\nThere are, however, many worrisome aspects of\r\nthe international situation. Local wars and conflicts\r\ncontinue to emerge sporadically. Although the Iraq war\r\nis over, peace remains elusive, with no end of suffering\r\nin sight for the Iraqi people. With the situation between\r\nIsrael and Palestine still experiencing ups and downs,\r\nthe Middle East peace process remains a long, uphill\r\njourney. In Africa, wars are still raging in some\r\ncountries.\r\nNon-traditional security concerns such as\r\nterrorism, drug-trafficking, arms proliferation, the\r\nspread of diseases and environmental degradation have\r\nbecome more pronounced. Given modern conditions,\r\nthey can easily spread within regions or even across the\r\nworld, making the security situation of human\r\ncommunities even more complicated.\r\nHumankind still confronts severe challenges in its\r\ndevelopment. In the past 30 years, the number of least\r\ndeveloped countries has doubled, reaching 50, which\r\naccounts for one quarter of the United Nations\r\nmembership. The ever-widening gap between the North\r\nand South and the aggravated disparity between the\r\nrich and the poor have become a major factor breeding\r\nnew conflicts and wars and undermining regional\r\nstability.\r\nAt a moment like this, people are inevitably\r\npondering the same question: in the interest of world\r\npeace and common development, what kind of new\r\nworld order should we establish in the twenty-first\r\ncentury?\r\nChina is of the view that the future well-being of\r\nhumankind hinges on closer international cooperation\r\nand a multipolar world. We should promote democracy\r\nin international relations. Multipolarization does not\r\nmean back-pedalling into the age of spheres of\r\ninfluence or a replay of the now long-gone rivalry of\r\nmajor Powers. It simply means bringing about a new\r\nregime of international relations under which all\r\ncountries — big or small, rich or poor, strong or\r\nweak — are treated as equals, and under which no\r\ncountry has the right to impose its will on others.\r\nWe should cultivate a new security concept based\r\non the principles of mutual trust, mutual benefit,\r\nequality and cooperation. Security should be\r\nmaintained through cooperation, and disputes should\r\nbe resolved peacefully through dialogue. The frequent\r\nuse of force and the threat of its use should be avoided.\r\nThe practice of building one’s own security at the\r\nexpense of others should be rejected.\r\nWe should support diversity in the process of\r\ndevelopment. Our world is a place of many colours and\r\nstyles. A single musical note cannot make a melody,\r\nnor does a phonetic alphabet make a language. Human\r\nwisdom has produced so many civilizations, allowing\r\nus to follow different paths of development and a\r\nvariety of values. It is through the exchanges,\r\nemulations and integrations of diverse cultures that\r\nhuman reason and wisdom shine brilliantly.\r\nWe should dedicate ourselves to the\r\nempowerment of developing countries in their large\r\nnumbers. The developing countries, which make up\r\nthree quarters of the world’s population, should\r\nbecome a key pillar of a multipolar world. Without\r\ntheir extensive participation on an equal footing, there\r\nwill be no democracy in international relations or a fair\r\nand rational world order. Without their economic\r\nrevitalization, there can be no common development of\r\nall humankind to speak of.\r\nWe should step up multilateral cooperation.\r\nMultilateral cooperation in various forms should\r\nbecome the principal vehicle in the handling of\r\ninternational affairs. Countries should join hands in\r\ntaking on global challenges through globalized\r\ncooperation.\r\nIn a multipolar world, countries should respect\r\nand consult with one another politically, strive for\r\ncommon development by helping one another\r\neconomically, prosper together by drawing on one\r\n29\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nanother’s cultural strengths and jointly maintain\r\nsecurity through mutual trust, thus working hand in\r\nhand to realize the peace and prosperity of humankind.\r\nMore than half a century ago, our forefathers\r\ngathered to give birth to the United Nations. The past\r\n58 years have seen the Organization’s notable\r\naccomplishments in preserving peace in regions and\r\naround the world and in promoting human development\r\nand progress. The spirit of the United Nations\r\nCharter — characterized by such words as “to live\r\ntogether in peace with one another as good neighbours”\r\nand “to promote social progress and better standards of\r\nlife in large freedom” — has been widely accepted in\r\nthe international community.\r\nThe United Nations has become the most\r\nuniversal, most representative and most authoritative\r\ninternational organization in the world today. This is\r\nwhat history affirms and what reality mandates.\r\nChina maintains that in the current situation the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\r\nshould be adhered to and earnestly abided by with a\r\nview to realizing democracy, the rule of law in\r\ninternational relations and the mutually advantageous\r\ncoexistence of the countries of the world.\r\nIn handling affairs affecting regional or\r\ninternational peace, all Member States are obliged to\r\nmaintain the leading role and authority of the United\r\nNations and its Security Council. China is in favour of\r\nan important role for the United Nations in Iraq’s post-\r\nwar arrangements and reconstruction and supports the\r\nrestoration of sovereignty to the Iraqi people at an early\r\ndate.\r\nChina also supports the United Nations carrying\r\nout the necessary reforms to enhance its role and\r\neffectiveness in the light of changing circumstances.\r\nThe United Nations is a microcosm of our world.\r\nThe world’s hope rests on a strong United Nations. In\r\norder to build a better future for humankind, it is\r\nincumbent upon us first to turn the United Nations into\r\na forum for cooperation instead of an arena of\r\nrecrimination. No country is entirely populated by\r\nsaints and therefore no country should have the right to\r\nthrow the stones of prejudice.\r\nTo that end, we should forsake all the old\r\nbaggage of arrogance, estrangement and narrow-\r\nmindedness and let harmony, understanding and\r\ntolerance ring out loudly as the undiminished themes of\r\nthis great Hall. The ocean is made great by all the\r\nrivers it takes in. Let that be the motto of all Member\r\nStates.\r\nDevelopment is the foundation for world peace\r\nand human progress. We stand for stronger\r\ninternational cooperation and the achievement of\r\ncommon development.\r\nThe current state of affairs — in which the gap\r\nbetween the North and the South has been widening\r\nwithout pause, with some countries of the South\r\nlanguishing in dire poverty — must be changed without\r\nfurther delay. The key lies in establishing a fair and\r\nequitable new world economic order in response to the\r\nrequirements of economic globalization.\r\nAn open and fair multilateral trading regime\r\nshould be established and improved. The principles of\r\nmutual understanding and mutual accommodation\r\nshould be followed to bring about due progress in\r\nmultilateral trade talks. Close attention should be given\r\nto reforming and improving the international financial\r\nsystem, setting up a financial early-warning mechanism\r\nand enhancing the capacity of countries to prevent and\r\ndeal with financial crises.\r\nStronger South-South cooperation and North-\r\nSouth exchanges should be promoted. The developing\r\ncountries should step up their cooperation and\r\ncoordination and gradually change their\r\ndisadvantageous position in the economic globalization\r\nprocess. This coming December, the second ministerial\r\nconference of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum\r\nwill be held in Addis Ababa, where the two sides will\r\nwork together to deepen their equality-based and\r\nmutually beneficial cooperation and open up a new\r\nhorizon in South-South cooperation.\r\nThe developed countries should also shoulder\r\ntheir duties and responsibilities by giving greater\r\nsupport to the developing countries in the areas of\r\nmarket access, funding, technology transfer, debt relief\r\nand trade terms.\r\nAll human communities make an organic whole\r\nwhen it comes to development. When hundreds of\r\nmillions of fellow human beings are suffering from\r\ncold and hunger, the rich countries should not nor\r\ncannot enjoy their riches by themselves for long. The\r\nstriking contrast in wealth is eroding the very dignity\r\nthat all human beings share. Upon the monstrous gap\r\n30\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nbetween the North and South cannot stand the great\r\nedifice of future prosperity.\r\nWhile addressing the development issue, it is\r\nnecessary to highlight the need for a harmonious\r\ndevelopment of the economy and society.\r\nAt present, humankind’s further development is\r\nbeing increasingly hampered by excessive population\r\ngrowth, environmental degradation, energy depletion,\r\nthe decline and demise of indigenous cultures, and\r\nother constraints. Sustainable development can be truly\r\nrealized only when there is harmony, mutual\r\ncomplementarity and mutual promotion between the\r\neconomy and society, and between their development\r\nand nature.\r\nIn the first half of the year, SARS struck a\r\nnumber of regions and countries, which testifies yet\r\nagain to the crucial importance of public health in the\r\ncontext of development. While countries should\r\nstrengthen their public health systems, the world in\r\ngeneral should enhance its capacity to deal with major\r\ndiseases and disasters through an improved globalized\r\ncontingency response mechanism.\r\nThe Chinese Government supports the proposal\r\nmade by the World Health Organization (WHO) and\r\ncertain countries at the fifty-sixth World Health\r\nAssembly for the establishment of a global fund\r\nagainst SARS and is ready to contribute to it. We call\r\non all countries to support the United Nations in its\r\nrelevant activities, including incorporating public\r\nhealth into United Nations development programmes\r\nand other action plans and promoting regional and\r\ninternational cooperation in this regard.\r\nLast fall, the Communist Party of China convened\r\nits 16th National Congress, which called for the\r\nbuilding, during the first two decades of the twenty-\r\nfirst century, of a society that is well off in all respects.\r\nThis past spring, a new Chinese Central Government\r\nwas elected at the 10th National People’s Congress —\r\nthus a smooth leadership transition was realized.\r\nIn the first half of the year, the people of China\r\nput up a heroic fight against SARS and won a\r\nresounding victory. Many friendly countries and\r\npersonalities in the world, together with the World\r\nHealth Organization and other United Nations\r\nagencies, have rendered us valuable support and\r\nassistance, for which I wish to express our heartfelt\r\ngratitude.\r\nChina has kept its economic growth in high gear.\r\nThe first two quarters saw the nation’s gross domestic\r\nproduct grow by 8.2 per cent over the corresponding\r\nperiod of last year, and foreign trade grow by 39 per\r\ncent. China’s economic efficiency has improved\r\nmarkedly, and its reforms on all fronts are progressing\r\nin an orderly way.\r\nNeedless to say, China is a developing country. It\r\nstill has a long way to go before all its citizens can live\r\na comfortable, even affluent life. Development,\r\ntherefore, remains China’s top priority.\r\nChina’s development requires a peaceful\r\ninternational and surrounding environment. We will\r\ncontinue to pursue an independent foreign policy of\r\npeace and will seek to play a constructive role in\r\nregional and international affairs.\r\nChina will continue to push for friendship and\r\ngood-neighbourliness in the interest of peace and\r\ntranquillity in the region. Based on our support for a\r\nnuclear-free Korean peninsula on which peace and\r\nstability should be maintained, we initiated and\r\nsponsored the three-party Beijing talks and the first\r\nround of six-party talks. China remains committed to\r\nresolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula\r\npeacefully through dialogue and the building of a\r\nlasting peace there.\r\nTo develop, China needs the world, and a\r\nprosperous world also needs China. The market and\r\ncooperation potential unleashed by a rapidly\r\ndeveloping China could bring fresh and immeasurable\r\nopportunities to the region and to the world at large.\r\nWe desire peace, stability and development. We\r\naspire to equality, mutual benefit and a win-win result\r\nfor all. Conforming to the tide of history, China has\r\nopted for the path of peaceful development, linking its\r\nrejuvenation with that of the region, with the interests\r\nof the majority of countries, and with the lofty cause of\r\npeace and development for humanity. We hereby\r\npledge our continued and ever-greater contribution to\r\nworld prosperity and progress.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Alexander\r\nDowner, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia.\r\nMr. Downer (Australia): To stand again at this\r\npodium today, representing Australia as its Foreign\r\nMinister, entering into the great conversation of\r\nnations, is an unsettling experience. Seldom has this\r\n31\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nforum been confronted with so many dimensions of\r\nuncertainty, so many challenges to global peace,\r\nsecurity and orderly economic reform. Seldom has its\r\nown capacity for regeneration to deal with them been\r\nso insistently put to the test.\r\nConor Cruise O’Brien, one of Ireland’s finest\r\nwriters, an official and later ambassador here, famously\r\nremarked:\r\n“The cynicism necessary in the approach to\r\nthe United Nations must at some point be made to\r\nyield to reverence: the reverence which is\r\nappropriate to ... an institution which is\r\nhumanity’s prayer to itself to be saved from\r\nitself.”\r\nRecently one of Australia’s foremost novelists,\r\nFrank Moorhouse, wrote a meditative essay on this\r\ntheme. In it he discerned a new pair of parallel world\r\norders:\r\n“For the first time in our lives, there are two\r\nvery powerful agents in world affairs … the\r\nUnited Nations Security Council … and the\r\nUnited States.”\r\nHe noted that “for all the cynicism about the\r\nfutility of international intervention, pragmatically,\r\npeople are being helped daily by the United Nations”\r\nand that “visionary and innovative international\r\nmissions” continue to be conceived and achieved\r\nwithin it.\r\nMoorhouse’s estimation of the significance of the\r\nUnited Nations is debatable. But a combination of\r\npragmatism, vision and reforming innovation is\r\nnecessary if, as I have already warned, this\r\nOrganization is to avoid frittering away its credibility\r\nand influence by failing to exercise its power\r\neffectively.\r\nIn the words of Secretary-General Annan, we\r\nshould not shy away from the need to improve and,\r\nwhere necessary, change the structure and function of\r\nthe United Nations and other international institutions\r\nto make sure they remain effective in promoting\r\nsecurity and peace.\r\nI alluded to the global challenges which confront\r\nus. First among them is the emergence of the “age of\r\nterror”. Where once it was possible to view terrorism\r\nas the lamentable legacy of a few unsafe regions, today\r\nalmost no country has been left untouched. Despite the\r\nwar on terror — a war we are winning — terrorism\r\ncontinues to be a scourge to which neither age,\r\nnationality, religion or political affiliation provides\r\nimmunity. It takes a considerable act of imaginative\r\nengagement to see these new forms of nihilism for\r\nwhat they really are. They are a negation of civilization\r\nand of the discourse that sustains it.\r\nI referred earlier to the visionary and innovative\r\nwork which sometimes only the United Nations can do.\r\nIn that context, I want to pause to pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General’s senior representative in Baghdad,\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello, well known to many of you\r\nhere. That such a man, engaged in such vital tasks —\r\nalong with so many of his colleagues — should have\r\nbeen swept by a terrorist bomb into the silent\r\ndemocracy of death epitomizes the struggle between\r\ncivilization and the unthinkable alternative.\r\nWe cannot allow terrorists to succeed in\r\ndetermining the course of world events. We must\r\noverwhelm their efforts to disrupt global security and\r\nprosperity, to undermine democratic countries or\r\ndestabilize nation-building.\r\nTerrorism has also created a new urgency in\r\nsolving a more familiar problem — the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. Efforts by rogue States to\r\ndevelop and traffic in weapons of mass destruction\r\nmaterials underpin the priority we give to non-\r\nproliferation. The possibility that weapons of mass\r\ndestruction might fall into the hands of terrorists makes\r\nit an absolute imperative. Terrorism and proliferation\r\ndo not occur in a vacuum — except, of course, a moral\r\nvacuum. It is no longer open to us to ignore the failed\r\nStates which have become their incubators or the\r\ntransnational crime on which they depend. The\r\npromotion of good governance and democratization are\r\nimperatives both morally and pragmatically. They have\r\nbecome preconditions for international security.\r\nGood governance serves both global and national\r\ninterests, as improved governance will fortify the\r\nUnited Nations itself. Without it, developing States will\r\nnever be able fully to realize the opportunities that\r\nglobalization presents: chiefly, the potential to erase\r\ndivisions between themselves and the developed world.\r\nThat can occur only if we are all prepared to accept the\r\ndisciplines that global trade liberalization imposes.\r\nWhile the prospects, post-Cancún, do not seem\r\nparticularly favourable, pursuing the Doha objectives\r\n32\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nremains the best way to alleviate poverty and its\r\nattendant ills in the developing world.\r\nIn confronting these challenges — such as\r\nsecurity, governance, poverty, terrorism and\r\npandemics — collective action is likely to yield the\r\nbest results, since not even the most powerful among\r\nus can bear the burden alone. Effective regional action\r\nalso remains important. Australia has built, with its\r\nneighbours, a network of bilateral counter-terrorism\r\narrangements. These enhance practical, operational-\r\nlevel liaison among regional security, intelligence and\r\nlaw enforcement agencies that have seen terror attacks\r\nprevented, networks disrupted and terrorists arrested.\r\nSimilarly, we are developing regional approaches\r\nto confront the dangers of State failure. Together with\r\nour Pacific Island Forum partners, we are restoring\r\nhope for a better future to the people of Solomon\r\nIslands. This Regional Assistance Mission has already\r\nmade excellent progress in its efforts to restore law and\r\norder and to rebuild the institutions of governance.\r\nRequested by the Government of Solomon Islands and\r\nsupported and implemented by Pacific island nations,\r\nthe Mission is consistent with the United Nations\r\nCharter’s original vision of strong regional efforts to\r\nmaintain international peace and security. Indeed, we\r\nwill continue to concentrate on improved standards of\r\ngovernance, which are central to our assistance in our\r\nown region. The Pacific Island Forum leaders recently\r\nendorsed efforts to promote more effective regional\r\ninstitutions and, where appropriate, the pooling of\r\nresources to ensure that services are both deliverable\r\nand sustainable.\r\nThe virtues of collective action are self-evident.\r\nBut collectivity ought not serve as a mantra which is an\r\nobstacle to effective action. Sometimes the most\r\neffective means of preserving security — and indeed\r\ninternational law — occur alongside the traditional\r\nmechanisms of multilateral diplomacy. Australia is a\r\nstrong supporter of multilateral institutions and\r\nprocesses, but only insofar as they are a means to an\r\neffective end.\r\nThe major global disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation treaties remain critical to setting norms of\r\ninternational order. But ultimately, those instruments\r\nmust be enforced. States are not merely entitled, but\r\nobliged, to take action to uphold those norms,\r\nespecially when the transfer of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction outside internationally agreed frameworks\r\nis involved. The conviction that States must uphold\r\ninternational norms — particularly in relation to\r\nweapons of mass destruction — led Australia to join\r\nthe coalition to disarm Iraq, and, in the same way, we\r\nrecently joined with others in what is known as the\r\nProliferation Security Initiative.\r\nAustralia believes the United Nations has a\r\ncritical role in promoting international peace and\r\nsecurity. First-hand experience in East Timor reminds\r\nus of that fact, and we look to the United Nations for\r\ncontinuing contributions to ensuring its stability.\r\nAustralia also appreciates the work of the United\r\nNations in rebuilding civil society in Iraq. Of the $100\r\nmillion Australia has committed to humanitarian and\r\nreconstruction assistance in Iraq, much has been\r\ndirected through United Nations agencies. Those are\r\ntwo examples in which the United Nations is playing a\r\npositive role.\r\nNevertheless, the role of the United Nations in\r\ninternational affairs is under critical scrutiny, and with\r\ngood reason. The United Nations, through its Member\r\nStates, needs to do much more to adapt to the evolving\r\nglobal environment. Australia has long been an\r\nadvocate of a more focused, efficient United Nations\r\nsystem. The Secretary-General’s reforms to date — in\r\nparticular the Brahimi peacekeeping changes — have\r\nbeen a valuable start.\r\nRadical and fundamental change is now needed.\r\nThe Secretary-General rightly states that the General\r\nAssembly is bogged down with an unwieldy agenda\r\nand repetitive and sterile debates. We need to ask\r\nourselves, if much of the activity of the General\r\nAssembly — or indeed of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil — did not occur, what practical difference\r\nwould it make, and would anyone notice?\r\nAgain, as Australia has long argued, the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council is out of step with\r\ngeopolitical realities. The permanent membership of\r\nthe Security Council should be expanded to reflect the\r\ncurrent realities — with the addition of countries such\r\nas Japan, India, Brazil, Indonesia and an African\r\nnation.\r\nWe support an overhaul of the United Nations\r\narchitecture, particularly in the light of new security\r\nthreats. The functioning of all the major United\r\nNations organs needs to be re-examined, as does the\r\ninter-relationship among them. Old shibboleths — such\r\nas the excessive homage to sovereignty, even at the\r\n33\r\nA/58/PV.9\r\nexpense of the preservation of humanity and human\r\nvalues — should not constrain us. We must end absurd\r\nduplication of effort. We should refocus the United\r\nNations on areas where it can and should make a very\r\nreal difference. But we must be imaginative and bold.\r\nThe group system, for example, needs\r\nmodernization. Australia could become part of an East\r\nAsia and Pacific grouping, and the old divide of\r\nEastern and Western Europe should be dispensed with\r\nto reflect the new, converging European reality. That\r\nwould form the basis for greater regional cooperation\r\nwithin the United Nations system, for greater\r\nengagement and problem-solving on a regional scale.\r\nIn short, we must work urgently on a bold\r\nblueprint for revitalization, which we should consider\r\nby the summer of next year. That is why we welcome\r\nthe Secretary-General’s proposal for a high-level\r\nreview panel. Real commitment to change — which\r\ncan be endorsed at a second San Francisco\r\nConference — will be necessary if the United Nations\r\nis to rediscover its credibility and its promise.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker in the general debate for\r\nthis meeting.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.50 p.m.\r\n"
