(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Pedro Verona Rodrigues Pires,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Cape Verde\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Cape Verde.\r\nMr. Pedro Verona Rodrigues Pires, President of\r\nthe Republic of Cape Verde, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Pedro Verona\r\nRodrigues Pires, President of the Republic of Cape\r\nVerde, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rodrigues Pires (spoke in\r\nPortuguese; English interpretation from a French text\r\nprovided by the delegation): I should like at the outset,\r\nMr. President, to hail your election to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I would\r\nalso like to extend to you our best wishes for success in\r\ncarrying out your mandate, a mandate which reflects\r\nthe honour bestowed on your country, the Republic of\r\nGabon, by the international community.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to pay\r\ntribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\r\nKofi Annan, for his selfless commitment to the causes\r\nof the United Nations and of Africa in particular.\r\nI believe this is also an appropriate time to pay\r\ntribute to and commend the actions of the former\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. Julian Hunte,\r\nfor his considerable contribution to promoting the\r\nuniversality of the United Nations.\r\nMy country, the Republic of Cape Verde, is\r\namong the small island States. We believe that our\r\nStates, as a result of their specific characteristics,\r\ndeserve a special hearing from the international\r\ncommunity. In the economic, social and ecological\r\nspheres, those States are confronting shortcomings and\r\nrestrictions specific to them, and these must be duly\r\ntaken into account.\r\nThrough its own efforts, but also through the\r\nnecessary contribution of the international community,\r\nCape Verde is now preparing to better itself and its\r\ncondition as a least developed country (LDC). My\r\ncountry continues to suffer from a precarious situation\r\nwhich cannot be ignored or minimized. In addition, the\r\nsmall island States often represent unique physical and\r\nhuman realities which form a genuine heritage of\r\nmankind. For these and other reasons, I would like here\r\nto launch an appeal in favour of the small island States.\r\nThe international community is going through a\r\nparticularly complex period marked by challenges of\r\nmany kinds. We are aware that it is only by focusing on\r\npeace, stability, security, dialogue and respect for\r\ndiversity of interests and cultures, in an atmosphere of\r\nfreedom, that we can create an international\r\nenvironment conducive to the just settlement of the\r\nserious problems we are encountering today.\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nWar does not have to be inevitable. Moreover,\r\ngiven the very advanced stage of civilization which\r\nmankind has achieved, I think it would be relevant to\r\nask whether it is time to leave behind the concept\r\nformulated by the outstanding nineteenth-century\r\nGerman military theoretician Clausewitz, who stated\r\nthat war is a continuation of policy through other\r\nmeans. I think, rather, that it is by relying on\r\nnegotiations, dialogue and the acknowledgement of the\r\nlegitimacy of the interests and rights of all parties, that\r\nwe can tap the potential for avoiding the need for war\r\nas a means of resolving national or international\r\ndisputes.\r\nFinally, it is with respect for international law,\r\ndrawn up with the participation of all and equally\r\nshared and respected by all — a respect which\r\npermeates the principles and purposes of the United\r\nNations — that we can find a response leading to a\r\npeaceful, prosperous and just world: the world which\r\nmankind clearly wishes to see.\r\nI would like to reiterate here and now our\r\nabsolute rejection of the unwarranted use of violence\r\nand our unequivocal condemnation of the use of\r\nterrorism as a way of resolving political disputes. The\r\ntrivialization of life and death, which is utterly\r\ncondemnable, also dehumanizes its proponents and\r\nopens the way to the worst kinds of wrongs in relations\r\nbetween human communities. This is why the struggle\r\nfor peace cannot be halted, and why everyone,\r\nespecially the United Nations, has the imperative duty\r\nto contribute to breaking the cycle of violence and\r\nopening the way to peaceful coexistence among nations\r\nand human communities.\r\nAmong the other social ills afflicting our planet\r\nwhich can be effectively combated are hunger and\r\npoverty. Their eradication is in fact one of the\r\nobjectives of the Millennium agenda. I am convinced\r\nthat success in combating hunger and poverty will have\r\nunquestionably positive global effects that would\r\npromote unity and harmony within the human family,\r\nand would strengthen human rights, including the most\r\nsacred and vital right — the right to life. It would also\r\npromote the material and moral enrichment of all of\r\nhuman society. It would contribute to the creation of\r\nconditions that are a prerequisite for improving\r\ninternational security by lessening migration and\r\nbridging the gap between rich and poor, thus\r\neliminating the reasons for the frustration of millions\r\nof poor and hungry individuals throughout today’s\r\nworld.\r\nAnother tragedy that requires action is HIV/\r\nAIDS, which is mortgaging the future of many\r\ncountries, particularly in Africa. There is an urgent\r\nneed to advance and guarantee effective international\r\nsolidarity in order to root out from the daily lives of\r\nmillions of human beings the spectre of hunger,\r\npoverty and pandemic illnesses. It is my belief that\r\nmankind has the resources and potential which will\r\nallow us to realize this marvellous dream.\r\nThe African continent, of which my country and\r\nyour country, Mr. President, are a part, continue to be\r\nfaced with enormous and varied challenges. Regarding\r\nthe critical issue of peace and political stability, we\r\nalso note a genuine commitment on the part of African\r\nStates to resolve conflicts and eliminate hotbeds of\r\ntension. But the political will of States, regional\r\norganizations and the African Union is not enough, and\r\nthe international community’s commitment and its\r\nindispensable contribution in the form of adequate\r\nresources are necessary for peace and security to\r\nbecome a reality for all our peoples within a reasonable\r\nperiod of time.\r\nPeace is not merely the absence of war. Genuine\r\npeace requires sufficient time and confidence-building\r\namong parties, as well as a strategy for building peace.\r\nSo too, peace and stability within States require\r\ninstitutions and policies that are inclusive and that\r\nrespect and engage all sectors of nations and meet their\r\nlegitimate political and economic aspirations, while at\r\nthe same time ensuring the protection of their cultural\r\nidentity.\r\nThere can be no doubt that, owing to profound\r\nchanges in the scientific, technological and socio-\r\npolitical fields, a huge movement of democratization of\r\nhuman societies is under way, backed by the\r\ninstitutions of the rule of law. However, mere political\r\ndemocracy is not sufficient. The ordinary citizen must\r\nbe guaranteed participation in public affairs and a\r\ndecent, worthy and dignified life, since there can be no\r\nfreedom without dignity.\r\nIt must also be recognized that there are still\r\ntenuous vestiges of the old orders, which must once\r\nand for all be rooted out and eliminated from\r\nrelationships between individuals and communities,\r\nsuch as racism, religious and cultural discrimination,\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\ngender inequality, and scorn for the fundamental rights\r\nof indigenous human communities in various countries.\r\nWe must also ask whether democracy within\r\nStates is reflected in relations among States,\r\nparticularly when we note the existence of an\r\nimbalanced world in which the inequality of power\r\nbetween the haves and the have nots continues to grow\r\nday by day. Therefore, there is a critical need to\r\npromote the democratization of international relations\r\nby seeking better balance in relations among States.\r\nInternational democracy based on dialogue and\r\ncooperation among States and among cultures, on\r\ntolerance and respect for cultural diversity among\r\ncommunities and on human solidarity and respect for\r\nthe legitimate political and material interests of all\r\nparties, of nations large and small would show itself in\r\nthe implementation of genuine multilateralism in\r\nglobal governance. Herein undoubtedly lie the\r\nfoundations for triumph over today’s challenges and\r\nthe assurance of a safe, peaceful, predictable and\r\nprosperous future for humanity.\r\nIn several months, the United Nations will mark\r\n60 years of rich and intense life that has been filled\r\nwith challenges, upheavals and extremely complex\r\nproblems, but that has also been marked by\r\ninnumerable victories and hopes for humanity. My\r\ncountry joined the community of nations in large part\r\nbecause of the intervention of the United Nations to\r\npromote the freedom and human rights of colonial\r\npeoples, for which we shall always be grateful. I\r\nbelieve that, in the light of the profound changes that\r\nhave occurred over the past six decades in all areas of\r\nthe international arena and the emergence of a new\r\nbalance of forces and extremely complex challenges\r\nrequiring urgent and immediate responses, it is\r\nbecoming clear that we need to move forward with\r\nreform of the United Nations, particularly the Security\r\nCouncil. In my view, the planned reform should, in\r\naddition to reflecting new global geopolitical realities,\r\nguarantee representativity and appropriate intervention\r\nand participation for all continents and all\r\ncommunities. From that perspective, we would then\r\nhave a more balanced international community and a\r\nmore equitable sharing of responsibility in the building\r\nof humanity’s future.\r\nBefore concluding, I should like to highlight the\r\nsuccessful actions carried out in the past few years by\r\nthe United Nations under the leadership of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who has enabled\r\nus to keep on the international agenda substantive\r\nissues that confront many societies daily, which has\r\nenabled this universal institution to be in direct contact\r\nwith concerns and challenges that are worrisome to all\r\nmembers of the human family.\r\nHere, I should also like to honour the memory of\r\nall those who have served the United Nations and\r\nfallen victim to senseless acts resulting from\r\nintolerance and the terrorism of radical movements. I\r\nemphasize the need for all countries and all formal and\r\ninformal institutions to guarantee and respect the\r\nsecurity of such noble men and women, for they are on\r\na mission to serve all of us.\r\nI hope, Sir, that this fifty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, which is taking place under your\r\npresidency, will provide new gains for peace, justice,\r\nsocial progress and global stability.\r\nFinally, I should like to reiterate the words of\r\nPope John Paul II, the unquestionable moral authority\r\nof our time, in his appeal to world leaders on 1 January\r\nthis year:\r\n“The United Nations ... needs to rise more and\r\nmore above the cold status of an administrative\r\ninstitution and to become a moral centre where\r\nall the nations of the world feel at home ...”\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of Cape Verde for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nMr. Pedro Verona Rodrigues Pires, President of\r\nthe Republic of Cape Verde, was escorted from\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Honourable Tuilaepa Sailele\r\nMalielegaoi, Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Trade of the Independent\r\nState of Samoa\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the\r\nIndependent State of Samoa.\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nThe Honourable Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi,\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nand Trade of the Independent State of Samoa, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I have great\r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Tuilaepa Sailele\r\nMalielegaoi, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Trade of the Independent State of Samoa,\r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Malielegaoi (Samoa): Samoa warmly\r\ncongratulates you, Mr. President, on your election to\r\nsteer the course of the Organization’s work at this\r\ncritical time in its 59-year history. I know that you will\r\ncontinue the good work of your predecessor in\r\nhighlighting the multidimensional nature of\r\ninternational security and the need to reform the United\r\nNations so that our Organization responds more\r\neffectively to the current and emerging challenges\r\nfacing our world.\r\nHardly a week goes by without an act of\r\nterrorism somewhere in the world assailing our senses.\r\nSuch murderous acts, regardless of the cause or\r\ngrievance advanced by their perpetrators, are utterly\r\nindefensible. Many innocent lives continue to be\r\nwasted, with people killed or maimed and multitudes\r\ndisplaced by heinous acts designed to undermine and\r\ndestabilize the collective efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to achieve peace and security for our\r\nsocieties. Samoa condemns, in the strongest terms, all\r\nacts of terrorism and will continue to take actions and\r\ncontribute our support to the campaign against it.\r\nBesides terrorism, other scourges to world peace\r\nand to the stability of our nations persist. The threat of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, poverty and hunger,\r\nenvironmental degradation, the trafficking and\r\nsmuggling of human beings, HIV/AIDS, malaria and\r\ntuberculosis are becoming perennial major threats to\r\nglobal security.\r\nThe campaign against terrorism can still be\r\nsuccessful, but not merely by force of arms. Preventing\r\nsafe havens for terrorists and closing off their sources\r\nof financing are just as crucial. But no less important is\r\nthe necessity of addressing the root causes that feed\r\nterrorism.\r\nNo sensible administration can fail to be moved\r\nby the tragedy of Beslan and the humanitarian\r\ncatastrophe of Darfur. The imperatives for action by\r\nthe Organization and the international community to\r\naddress those events and their causes have been\r\neloquently articulated by leaders who have spoken\r\nearlier from this rostrum. I wish only to recall and\r\nemphasize that actions to arrive at solutions to those\r\nevents and others like them must be carried out in\r\naccordance with the rule of law.\r\nWith regard to Iraq, Samoa deplores the daily\r\nviolence that has killed and maimed so many people\r\nand the circumstances that have brought it about. We\r\nfully support the re-establishment of Iraq’s sovereignty,\r\nand we pray for the success of a credible election\r\nprocess to create an Iraqi Government with a popular\r\nmandate.\r\nLikewise, we can only pray and hope that a\r\nworkable solution will be found soon for the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict, before many more lives are lost on\r\nboth sides.\r\nLast month, Samoa hosted, in the capital, Apia,\r\nthe annual Pacific Islands Forum Summit of leaders.\r\nAs the representative holding the current chairmanship\r\nof that group, I wish to inform the Assembly that the\r\nPacific leaders again noted the dangers to the world of\r\nterrorism, and — to the Pacific region, in particular —\r\nof transnational crime, illicit drugs and the spread of\r\nsmall arms assault weapons. Consequently, the Pacific\r\nIslands Forum countries have strengthened their\r\ncooperation in counter-terrorism measures, as well as\r\nemphasized national efforts and regional cooperation in\r\ncombating transnational organized crime and in\r\nbuilding border-control capacities.\r\nThe Pacific Islands Forum is also committed to\r\ncollective arrangements and mechanisms to assist\r\nregional Governments to recover from national\r\nconflicts and crises. The success of these arrangements,\r\nundertaken with the support of the United Nations, is\r\nalready evident in the positive results of the Regional\r\nAssistance Mission to Solomon Islands. While much\r\nmore remains to be done, Solomon Islands is making\r\ngood and steady progress, and the Forum will remain\r\nengaged in sustaining the mission.\r\nSimilarly, peace has been achieved in\r\nBougainville, with elections for an autonomous\r\nBougainville Government to be held by the end of the\r\nyear. The roles of the Governments of Papua New\r\nGuinea, Australia and New Zealand, with the support\r\nof the Pacific Islands Forum, working together with the\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nUnited Nations Observer Mission, is critical in guiding\r\nBougainville during this important period.\r\nAn important feature of the response mechanism\r\nput in place by the Pacific Islands Forum to assist\r\nregional Governments is its flexibility. The Pacific\r\nIslands Forum is now in the process of responding to a\r\ncrisis in one of our member countries resulting from\r\ncauses quite different from those in Solomon Islands\r\nand Bougainville.\r\nIn recognition of the importance of good\r\ngovernance for economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, the Pacific Islands Forum has invited its\r\nmembers to become parties to the United Nations\r\nConvention against Corruption. In strengthening\r\nfurther the institutions of good governance in Pacific\r\nnations, the important role of non-State actors and civil\r\nsociety was highlighted by the Pacific leaders.\r\nOne issue that the Pacific islands have brought to\r\nthe attention of the United Nations over the years that\r\nremains relevant — not only for the Pacific — and\r\nthat, very importantly, is advancing the cause of\r\nnuclear non-proliferation, is that of the South Pacific\r\nNuclear-Free-Zone Treaty. The Pacific Forum has\r\nagain called on the United States to ratify the Protocols\r\nto the Treaty.\r\nAlthough the Pacific Islands Forum has been\r\nheavily engaged in overcoming crises with which some\r\nof the regional Governments are grappling, several\r\nPacific island nations, in addition to Australia and New\r\nZealand, have nevertheless been contributing in ways\r\nwe can to the United Nations peacekeeping efforts. As\r\nfor my own country, we provide police to the United\r\nNations peacekeeping missions in Timor-Leste and\r\nLiberia, in addition to those we have committed to\r\nSolomon Islands.\r\nClearly, our small nations are trying hard to\r\ncontribute to the security and peace initiatives of the\r\nUnited Nations. However, national obligations —\r\nincluding reporting obligations for the various\r\nconventions and United Nations resolutions on security\r\nand terrorism — place an onerous burden on the\r\ninfrastructure and administrative capacity of small\r\nStates. We therefore seek the understanding of the\r\nOrganization and encourage the appropriate United\r\nNations bodies to explore innovative ways to help\r\nsmall States meet their commitments.\r\nMr. Spencer (Antigua and Barbuda), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nThe challenges to and special needs of small\r\nisland developing States are well known, and are\r\nreflected in the Barbados Programme of Action for the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, which has been in place for the past 10 years.\r\nSadly, despite the commitments made 10 years ago at\r\nBarbados and during the 1999 mid-term review in this\r\nHall, the achievement of those goals continues to elude\r\nus.\r\nIt is our fervent hope, however, that the\r\nInternational Meeting due to take place in Mauritius\r\nnext January to comprehensively review the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action will provide an opportunity for\r\nthe international community to demonstrate the\r\npolitical will and commit sufficient resources to allow\r\nour small island developing nations to overcome the\r\nunique challenges we face.\r\nThe series of hurricanes that wrought massive\r\ndevastation in some island nations of the Caribbean\r\nand in the United States is a stark reminder of the\r\nextreme challenges faced by small island developing\r\nStates and of their vulnerability to disasters. Our\r\nPacific island nations, including my own country,\r\nknow from our bitter experience of cyclones that\r\nregularly batter our region about the disheartening\r\neffect of such disasters in setting back, in a matter of\r\nhours, the hard-earned development achievements of\r\nmany years.\r\nThe concerns and the vulnerability of our nations\r\nare therefore quite real. While we accept the primary\r\nresponsibility for achieving the goals of the\r\nProgramme of Action, the reality is that the support of\r\nthe international community is indispensable to its\r\nsuccess. We therefore call on the United Nations\r\nsystem and the international community to provide the\r\nnecessary support to complement ongoing and future\r\nprogrammes, as well as for the implementation and\r\nmonitoring of the Mauritius outcomes for the\r\nsustainable development of small island developing\r\nStates.\r\nLikewise, the importance of multilateral\r\ninstitutions such as the Global Environment Facility\r\n(GEF) in this process cannot be overemphasized. We\r\ntherefore urge GEF to apply its rules of access and to\r\nsimplify its disbursement procedures in order to take\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\ninto account the special circumstances of small island\r\ndeveloping States.\r\nTrade is a vital component of sustainable\r\ndevelopment, especially for small island developing\r\nStates. We therefore continue to urge that the\r\nvulnerabilities of small States be taken fully into\r\naccount in the World Trade Organization negotiations,\r\nparticularly with regard to special and differential\r\ntreatment for small economies.\r\nThe review of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals next year will provide an opportunity for the\r\ninternational community to take stock of progress and\r\nto identify remedial strategies and commitments for the\r\nfurther realization of those Goals. Samoa remains\r\ncommitted to the achievement of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nThe election of the second Deputy Prosecutor of\r\nthe International Criminal Court just two weeks ago\r\ncompletes the process of the full institutionalization of\r\nthe Court. Samoa warmly welcomes the broad\r\ncomplement of judges and officers of the Court and\r\nadds its voice in urging other United Nations Members\r\nto accede to the Rome Statute for the establishment of\r\nthe Court. Given its role in upholding international\r\nhumanitarian standards and in protecting human rights,\r\nthe Court deserves the support of the international\r\ncommunity to give it the full universality it requires.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General and the previous\r\nPresident of the Assembly for their very commendable\r\nwork in advancing the revitalization and reform of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nTo this end, Samoa fully supports the work of the\r\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change,\r\nand looks forward to its report at the end of the year.\r\nWe believe that the outcome of United Nations\r\nreform should include the restoration of the primacy of\r\nthe role of the General Assembly and the attainment of\r\na more effective and efficient Secretariat.\r\nIn particular, we support the enlargement of the\r\nSecurity Council and strongly recommend the\r\ninclusion of Japan and Germany as permanent\r\nmembers.\r\nFinally, I offer Mr. Ping my delegation’s full\r\nsupport in the discharge of his numerous\r\nresponsibilities, and I wish him well in his presidency.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the\r\nIndependent State of Samoa for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nThe Honourable Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi,\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nand Trade of the Independent State of Samoa, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by The Honourable Patrick Manning,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Trinidad\r\nand Tobago\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Trinidad and Tobago.\r\nThe Honourable Patrick Manning, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Honourable Patrick\r\nManning, Prime Minister of the Republic of Trinidad\r\nand Tobago, and inviting him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Manning (Trinidad and Tobago):\r\nMr. President, on behalf of the Government and the\r\npeople of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, I\r\nextend congratulations to Mr. Ping on his election to\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nninth session. We are confident that his experience and\r\ndiplomatic skills will enable him to discharge fully the\r\nweighty responsibilities of his office.\r\nPermit me to convey to his predecessor, The\r\nHonourable Julian Hunte, Minister of Foreign Affairs\r\nof Saint Lucia, our deep appreciation of his efforts\r\ntowards revitalization of the General Assembly.\r\nI wish also to convey to our Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, the full support of the Government\r\nand the people of Trinidad and Tobago as he continues\r\nthe global initiatives of the United Nations towards\r\nmaking the world better and safer for all humanity.\r\nToday Trinidad and Tobago is celebrating its\r\ntwenty-eighth anniversary as a republic. Over our 42\r\nyears as an independent country, we have made\r\nsignificant strides in the development of our nation. We\r\nhave maintained a strong tradition of democratic\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\ngovernance through an increasingly inclusive and\r\nmultiparty political system; by respecting fully the\r\nconstitutionally entrenched and internationally\r\nrecognized fundamental human rights and freedoms of\r\nthe individual; and by ensuring strict adherence to the\r\nrule of law.\r\nWe have sought increasingly to diversify our\r\neconomic base. Through consistent and sound macro-\r\neconomic policies, together with prudent management\r\nand use of our resources, we have sustained more than\r\na decade of positive economic growth, which last year\r\nwas of the order of 13.2 per cent.\r\nOur country has made significant strides in\r\nadvancing the capabilities of our people through\r\nuniversal access to primary and secondary education.\r\nWe have gone further through our State-sponsored\r\npreschool programme, which targets universal early\r\nchildhood education by 2010, and by fully opening the\r\ngateway to tertiary education through support for every\r\nstudent, enhanced funding for deserving ones, and our\r\nrecently established University of Trinidad and\r\nTobago.\r\nOur archipelagic Republic, populated by 1.3\r\nmillion people of African, Indian, European, Chinese,\r\nMiddle Eastern and mixed ancestries, constitutes a\r\nveritable microcosm of the people of the world.\r\nHowever, we have been able to foster racial harmony\r\nand religious tolerance through the collective embrace\r\nof the diversity of our people.\r\nThat approach, together with adherence to\r\nintegrity and transparency in public affairs and equality\r\nof opportunity for all, has been essential to the\r\ncontinued peace, stability and progress we enjoy as we\r\npropose to make Trinidad and Tobago a beacon of\r\nintegrity in the world.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago has demonstrated\r\nremarkable strength and resilience in the face of a\r\nglobal environment characterized by rapid economic,\r\nsocial and other changes; this has mobilized us to\r\nembark on the realization of a bold new vision in the\r\npursuit of our developmental agenda. In that respect,\r\nour Government and people are currently engaged in a\r\nhighly participatory consultative process aimed at\r\nformulating a National Strategic Development Plan to\r\nguide Trinidad and Tobago towards becoming a\r\ndeveloped nation by the year 2020 or earlier.\r\nIt is called Vision 2020, and its agenda includes\r\nhuman capital development; the evolution of a\r\ntechnologically driven, knowledge-based society; the\r\ndevelopment of a highly productive and globally\r\ncompetitive economy; and, by the year 2020, the\r\nprovision for all our citizens of a standard of living\r\ncomparable to that enjoyed in developed countries.\r\nOur achievements stand in indisputable testimony\r\nto what a small, independent nation such as ours can do\r\nin that regard. There is an instructive link between two\r\nof the features that today define and distinguish our\r\ncountry among others in the region. One is our oil and\r\nnatural gas resources — the foundation and mainstay\r\nof our economy; the other, the steelpan, our creation\r\nderived from heating and tuning the top of discarded\r\noil drums.\r\nThe steelpan is one of the most important musical\r\ninstruments invented during the last century. We are\r\nproud to have created it, and equally so of its growing\r\ninternational recognition and popularity, which is an\r\napt reflection of the phenomenal ingenuity of the\r\npeoples of developing countries.\r\nThe same holds true in respect of achievements in\r\nour energy sector. At just over 130,000 barrels of oil\r\nper day, Trinidad and Tobago’s production is not\r\nsignificant by international standards. Our natural gas\r\nproduction, however, stands at 2.9 billion cubic feet\r\nper day, and that has propelled my country to become\r\ntoday the world’s largest exporter of methanol and also\r\nof ammonia. We are currently supplying 80 per cent of\r\nUnited States liquid natural gas imports out of our\r\nthree trains, and we propose to leverage that fact\r\ntowards Caribbean regional development. We are also a\r\ncritical supplier of energy to our Caribbean neighbours.\r\nTo further facilitate this, we are exploring the\r\nfeasibility of several energy-related projects, including\r\nthe establishment of a natural gas pipeline through the\r\neastern Caribbean. We have also entered into a joint\r\nventure with neighbouring Venezuela to liquefy that\r\ncountry’s natural gas in Trinidad and Tobago.\r\nMeanwhile, our iron and steel production\r\nfacilities are being expanded. Several new production\r\nfacilities are in train, among them an ethylene\r\nproduction complex, an aluminium smelter project, and\r\nothers for expanded ammonia and methanol production\r\nas well as other downstream petrochemical products.\r\nThe combination of an attractive and enabling\r\ninvestment climate, available and affordable energy, a\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nstrategic location vis-à-vis the North, Central and\r\nSouth American and European markets, a population\r\nliteracy level of over 90 per cent, and a sound work\r\nethic, as well as a good communications infrastructure,\r\ncontinue to make Trinidad and Tobago one of the\r\nlargest per-capita recipients of foreign direct\r\ninvestment in the hemisphere. Indeed, last year we\r\nwere the second-largest recipient after Canada.\r\nLike other countries we, too, have our fair share\r\nof challenges. For example, our strategic location —\r\nless than nine miles off the South American coast and\r\nto the south of the Caribbean island chain, with\r\nexcellent air and sea transport links to major North\r\nAtlantic cities — renders Trinidad and Tobago highly\r\nvulnerable to trade in illegal drugs and firearms.\r\nCombating narco-trafficking, drug-related crimes and\r\nthe spread of HIV/AIDS is among our greatest\r\nchallenges, but the Government of Trinidad and\r\nTobago remains resolute in its determination to\r\neradicate those scourges. We continue to implement the\r\nmeasures necessary to fight them and are confident that\r\nwe shall win the battle.\r\nOur development agenda is not centred solely on\r\nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. It is part and\r\nparcel of a pan-Caribbean agenda to which we are\r\nirrevocably and solidly committed, and which takes\r\ninto consideration the fullest development of the\r\ncountries of our region. Many historical and other ties\r\nbind our Caribbean nations and we understand that the\r\nfundamental basis for our development lies in being\r\nable to work more closely together to exert a greater\r\ninfluence on our own as well as global development,\r\nwhich for centuries have been dictated by others.\r\nToday, our level of functional cooperation in the\r\nregion has increased over a range of areas and Trinidad\r\nand Tobago continues to play a central role at all\r\nlevels. We therefore look forward to the\r\noperationalization of our newest Caribbean institution,\r\nthe Caribbean Court of Justice, which will serve as the\r\narbitral body for the soon-to-be-established CARICOM\r\nSingle Market and Economy, as well as the region’s\r\nfinal appellate Court, and will be headquartered in Port\r\nof Spain.\r\nThe development of Trinidad and Tobago and\r\nCARICOM are intertwined. CARICOM is our second\r\nlargest export market after the United States of\r\nAmerica, absorbing close to 20 per cent of our exports.\r\nOur share of regional trade grew to 80 per cent in\r\n2001. Since 1996, we have contributed approximately\r\nUS$ 1.4 billion in assistance to Caribbean States\r\nthrough a variety of mechanisms including capital\r\nmarket activities, foreign direct investment, debt relief,\r\nand direct assistance. Last year we provided US$ 505\r\nmillion in loans to companies and Governments in the\r\nregion, some of whom have difficulty in borrowing on\r\nthe international market. In addition, we have recently\r\nestablished a new grant facility, to be based on sales of\r\npetroleum products to the region, which will be\r\ndedicated to poverty eradication within CARICOM.\r\nMy country sees the development of the\r\nCaribbean, our second largest market, as integral to the\r\ndevelopment of Trinidad and Tobago. Even so, our\r\nnational and regional development efforts require an\r\ninternational economic environment of greater\r\nsensitivity, one facilitating a more beneficial\r\nintegration of developing countries into the world\r\neconomy. In that regard, as sanguine as we are about\r\nthe future of Trinidad and Tobago, I must on this\r\noccasion take a stand in the interest of the beleaguered\r\nnations of the Caribbean. How often have small\r\nindependent States preached from this very\r\nmountaintop of the need for multilateral trading\r\narrangements that take into account the inherent\r\nvulnerabilities of small island developing States, and\r\nconsequently the need to be accorded special and\r\ndifferential treatment? There is a notable reluctance of\r\nsome partner countries to respond accordingly, and that\r\ncontinues to have negative consequences, especially\r\nfor the small economies of the Caribbean.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago therefore stands resolute\r\nwith our developing country partners in calling for\r\nwhat must be conceived of as the application of a\r\nsocial conscience within the management of\r\nglobalization and its processes. As capital importing\r\neconomies, the developing countries of the Caribbean\r\nare only too well aware, sometimes painfully so, of the\r\nimplications of capital shortage for the generation of\r\nemployment and the provision of housing, education\r\nand health care for our citizens. And perhaps I speak\r\neven for those yet unborn.\r\nIt is through softer trading arrangements,\r\nincreased financial flows and the consequent\r\nempowerment of our citizens that we will be able to\r\nrealize the most central of all the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, the eradication of poverty. The\r\nimplications are clear. The course on which some of\r\nour European Union (EU) country partners are\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nembarked will render the achievement of our\r\nMillennium Development Goals more difficult.\r\nIn speaking of those goals our attention is now\r\ndrawn to Haiti, our newest CARICOM member, where\r\nover 1,000 people died from the onslaught of\r\nHurricane Jeanne, further aggravating the tremendous\r\nproblems that that nation already suffers. Trinidad and\r\nTobago therefore welcomes the decision taken by the\r\nSecurity Council in its resolution 1542 (2004) of 30\r\nApril 2004 to establish the United Nations Stabilization\r\nMission in Haiti. We also support the recent decision\r\nby the Economic and Social Council to reactivate its\r\nAd Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti to promote the\r\ncoordination and development of a long-term\r\nprogramme of assistance to that country. We believe\r\nthat those efforts by the international community will\r\ncontribute significantly to the stability and urgently\r\nneeded development of Haiti.\r\nAt this juncture, however, Haiti needs a\r\ntremendous outpouring of international humanitarian\r\nassistance. The same holds true for Grenada and\r\nseveral other Caribbean States whose misfortune it was\r\nto have been visited by “Ivan, the Terrible”. On\r\n8 September, Hurricane Ivan descended on Grenada. In\r\nless than two hours it had completely destroyed the\r\neconomy and infrastructure of Grenada, ravaging that\r\ncountry beyond description. Ninety percent of the\r\nbuildings on the island were damaged or destroyed. A\r\nprimarily agricultural economy, dependent also on\r\ntourism, all of Grenada’s crops disappeared with the\r\nstrong wind. CARICOM leaders were recently advised\r\nby a Grenadian representative that today Grenada has\r\nno gross domestic product.\r\nBefore visiting Grenada, Hurricane Ivan —\r\nsowing varying amounts of disruption and\r\ndestruction — visited Tobago and Barbados. After\r\nGrenada, it proceeded to Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Cuba,\r\nBahamas and the southern United States. Everywhere\r\nthere was considerable damage, but Grenada and the\r\nCayman Islands were the hardest hit.\r\nBefore Ivan, there was Charley and Frances.\r\nAfter Ivan came Jeanne, with death and destruction for\r\nPuerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. A\r\nnumber of CARICOM countries are now saddled with\r\nthe immense challenge of trying to restore normalcy.\r\nPermit me to ask, to what extent have these\r\nobvious climate changes been influenced by incursions\r\ninto space from planet Earth, or for that matter by\r\necological imbalances caused by industrialization?\r\nIn the aftermath of the devastation visited on\r\nGrenada, CARICOM countries have been rallying to\r\nthe assistance of that island, and must be applauded for\r\ntheir massive outpouring of humanitarian aid that\r\ncontinues to flow to Grenada. In that regard, permit me\r\nto recognize and applaud the most appropriate response\r\nof the Secretary-General.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago pledges its support to our\r\nbeleaguered Caribbean neighbours, and we have thus\r\ncommitted ourselves through direct financial and other\r\nassistance. But what Grenada and Haiti require is well\r\nbeyond the region’s capacity to deliver. I urge the\r\nwider international community and donor agencies to\r\nrespond adequately and to play their part. Help is\r\nneeded and needed now.\r\nThe catastrophic events of the present hurricane\r\nseason bring into sharper focus yet another dimension\r\nof the vulnerability of Caribbean countries. The\r\nJanuary 2005 International Meeting in Mauritius to\r\nreview the implementation of the Barbados Programme\r\nof Action must seek to comprehensively address the\r\nnew and emerging threats to the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of small island developing States. The\r\ninternational community should take note that a whole\r\nnew set of security issues have now arisen in the\r\nCaribbean as a result of those developments.\r\nThe answer to so many of our problems lies in\r\nmultilateralism, if approached the right way. Belief in\r\nand respect for multilateralism led to Trinidad and\r\nTobago’s respect for all major global and regional\r\nforums. Today, we are active participants in the\r\ncreation of the free trade area of the Americas, which,\r\nwhen realized, will stretch from Alaska in the north to\r\nTierra del Fuego in the south, creating a market of\r\nmore than 800 million consumers and generating\r\ntremendous opportunity for economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nOur region’s commitment to that hemispheric\r\nintegration process has led Trinidad and Tobago and its\r\npartners in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to\r\npropose our capital city, Port-of-Spain, as the ideal\r\nlocation for the seat of the proposed permanent\r\nsecretariat of the free trade area of the Americas.\r\nUnanimous regional support for this CARICOM\r\nproposal would demonstrate the hemisphere’s\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nsolidarity with one of its smaller members and give\r\ntrue meaning to the principle of the sovereign equality\r\nof all States. It would further decentralize the\r\nheadquartering of major international and regional\r\norganizations and enable a small island developing\r\nState to place its resources at the service of the\r\nhemispheric community. Accordingly, we look forward\r\nto receiving the support of all our neighbours in the\r\nhemisphere.\r\nWe remain pleased with the progress of certain\r\nmultilateral initiatives, including the New African\r\nPartnership for Development, which I urge CARICOM\r\nand African countries to support by exploring\r\nopportunities to develop investment, trade, tourism and\r\nregular transport routes between our region and the\r\nAfrican continent.\r\nWe also consider the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court to be a major\r\nachievement, and we urge partner countries to uphold\r\nthe integrity of the Rome Statute. The commission of\r\nwar crimes, genocide and other such crimes against\r\nhumanity has been facilitated by a global culture of\r\nimpunity. The people of the world will be safe only\r\nwhen the perpetrators of such crimes know that\r\npunishment is inescapable.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago condemns all forms and\r\nmanifestations of terrorism, wherever and by\r\nwhomever they are committed. We are already a party\r\nto the principal international legal instruments against\r\nterrorism, and the Government will shortly take\r\nparliamentary action to enact legislation honouring our\r\nobligations with respect to the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism.\r\nAs the international community continues to\r\nconfront the many threats to the survival of mankind,\r\nthe world’s political leadership must unequivocally\r\nreaffirm its commitment to the United Nations so that\r\nthe United Nations can continue its role in fighting\r\ninjustice, inequality, inequity and intolerance\r\nworldwide through resolute and speedy action, in\r\nrespect of its commitment to the ideals for which it was\r\nfounded.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago is of the view that the issue\r\nof United Nations reform takes on even more urgency\r\nas the institution approaches the sixtieth anniversary of\r\nits founding in 1945. We therefore look forward to\r\ndiscussion of the Secretary-General’s recommendations\r\nbased on the report of the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change, chaired by former Prime\r\nMinister Anand Panyarachun.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to propose that on 24\r\nOctober, 2005, United Nations Day, a special\r\ncommemorative meeting of the General Assembly be\r\nheld in San Francisco, where our Charter was signed,\r\nto reaffirm our commitment to the lofty ideals\r\nenunciated some 50 years ago, which are still valid\r\ntoday.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Trinidad and Tobago for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nThe Honourable Patrick Manning, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ayad Allawi, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Iraq\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Iraq.\r\nMr. Ayad Allawi, Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Iraq, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Ayad Allawi, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Iraq, and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Allawi (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): It is with\r\npleasure that I congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nassumption of the presidency at the fifty-ninth session\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nIt is also a pleasure to speak to the Assembly\r\ntoday as the Prime Minister of a fully sovereign State\r\nthat seeks to recover its place among the community of\r\nnations. Iraq has been isolated from the international\r\ncommunity for a very long time. It was deprived of the\r\nvery important role it should play in the community of\r\nnations. The Iraqi people aspire to recover that role\r\ntoday.\r\nIraq is a nation rich in cultural heritage and\r\nhistory, as the cradle of civilization. But the oppressive\r\nregime of Saddam Hussein cast a long, sinister shadow\r\nover Iraq. It traumatized and suppressed the people of\r\nIraq for decades. With the fall of Saddam Hussein’s\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\noppressive regime, our country and the world have\r\nbeen made safer. New horizons for fruitful and\r\nconstructive cooperation with the world have emerged.\r\nA new situation has emerged in Iraq, which is\r\nnow experiencing a conflict of far-reaching\r\nconsequences for the country’s future and its relations\r\nwith the world. It is the struggle of the Iraqi people —\r\nand its vision for future peace and democracy —\r\nagainst the terrorists and extremists and the remnants\r\nof Saddam Hussein’s regime, who are targeting that\r\nnoble dream long nurtured by our people. It is the\r\nstruggle of all civilized nations against those working\r\nto destroy civilization and world culture. I therefore\r\nappeal to the representatives of the countries assembled\r\nhere to help Iraq to defeat the forces of terrorism and to\r\nbuild a better future for its people.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe brutal dictatorship imposed by Saddam\r\nHussein on Iraq brought destruction to Iraq and\r\nbrutalized and traumatized the Iraqi people. The regime\r\nkilled hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens. It\r\narrested and tortured many thousands more and drove\r\nmillions of Iraqis to leave their country after depriving\r\nthem of the most fundamental human and civil rights.\r\nIt also ruined relations among Iraqis by sowing the\r\nseeds of religious, ethnic and other divisions.\r\nMy words today cannot adequately convey the\r\noppression and suffering endured by the Iraqi people\r\nover three decades. We have discovered 262 mass\r\ngraves, and we continue to find more; they prove the\r\ncorruption of the Saddam regime and its lack of\r\ncompassion and respect for life.\r\nDuring the brutal era of Saddam Hussein, the\r\ndream of the Iraqi people was to build a democratic,\r\nfederal and free Iraq that would ensure a dignified life\r\nfor its citizens. Today, we have a genuine opportunity\r\nto make that dream come true. Iraq has now become a\r\ncountry of laws that ensure respect for human rights\r\nand freedoms. It has a Government that embodies the\r\ndiversity of the Iraqi people within the framework of\r\ngenuine national unity.\r\nToday, we are also preparing to hold democratic\r\nelections next January under the timeline set in the\r\nLaw of Administration of the State of Iraq for the\r\nTransitional Period and in Security Council resolution\r\n1546 (2004). We are committed to that timeline despite\r\nthe complexities and difficulties involved, and, with\r\nthe Assembly’s help, we can meet the deadline.\r\nHolding elections is a vital and necessary step towards\r\nimproving the security situation in Iraq. We hope that\r\nall Iraqis will participate in the elections and contribute\r\nto the completion of the political process.\r\nNonetheless, there is a tiny extremist minority\r\nthat seeks to deprive Iraqis of the opportunity to fulfil\r\ntheir dream of building a democratic future in Iraq.\r\nLike all terrorists everywhere in the world, those who\r\nare responsible for terrorism in Iraq hate democracy,\r\nfreedom and humanity. They are abetted in their\r\ncriminal endeavours by a number of foreigners who\r\nhave infiltrated Iraq from neighbouring countries.\r\nThere are also criminals from the previous regime, who\r\naim at destroying our country and impeding progress.\r\nThey are not freedom fighters, as is claimed by some\r\nbiased circles. They do not mean to liberate our\r\ncountry; rather, they want to spread chaos, violence\r\nand terror and jeopardize the security of citizens and of\r\nthe country. They target the dreams and aspirations of\r\nthe Iraqi people.\r\nIn fact, our goal in the ongoing conflict is to\r\nrestore stability and the rule of law and to enable the\r\nmen, women and children of Iraq to live free from fear.\r\nThe aim of the terrorists, on the other hand, is to\r\ndestroy the aspirations and will power of our people\r\nthrough mass killings and the destruction of Iraq’s\r\ninfrastructure, and to stop economic life in Iraq and\r\ncreate a state of tension, panic and instability in order\r\nto undermine peace and security. They want to destroy\r\nhuman civilization in our region and, indeed,\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nFor all those reasons, my Government’s top\r\npriorities are to defeat the terrorists’ schemes, to\r\nestablish security throughout Iraq and to hunt down the\r\nterrorists and bring them to justice. We have developed\r\nplans to promote security as a vital precondition for the\r\nreconstruction of Iraq, the restoration of economic\r\nprogress, the completion of the political process, the\r\nachievement of national reconciliation and the\r\npromotion of a culture of tolerance among all citizens\r\nof Iraq.\r\nPerhaps members now appreciate the daunting\r\ntask we are facing. We look forward to assistance from\r\nour neighbours and all of our friends in the\r\ninternational community in order to achieve security\r\nand stability in Iraq. I recognize that some countries\r\nhere objected to the war that brought down the\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\noppressive regime of Saddam Hussein and liberated the\r\npeople of Iraq. And that is their right. However,\r\ndifferences over this issue should not remain an\r\nobstacle to establishing new cooperative relationships\r\nthat would allow Iraq to receive serious international\r\nsupport to consolidate security, freedom and\r\ndemocracy in our country and to forge ahead on the\r\npath of development and progress.\r\nIraq welcomes international support for the\r\nobjectives of the Iraqi people as outlined in Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1546 (2004), which was adopted\r\nunanimously. That resolution reaffirms the sovereignty\r\nand territorial integrity of Iraq and endorses the\r\nformation of the national Government. It also affirms\r\nthe international community’s commitment to support\r\nthe Government in fulfilling the will of the Iraqi people\r\nby holding elections and establishing the proper legal\r\nframework for political parties and civil society. In\r\naddition, it places emphasis on the re-establishment of\r\nan effective governmental structure, the application of\r\nthe principle of social justice, and the promotion of a\r\nclimate of tolerance, dialogue and human rights.\r\nWe need more assistance from our neighbours\r\nand from the international community as a whole to\r\nmeet all those objectives and to translate the\r\naspirations of the Iraqi people into realities after so\r\nmany decades of suffering under the oppression of the\r\nprevious regime and its excessive practices. We are\r\nproud of our membership of the League of Arab States,\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and the\r\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and\r\nwe have started a fruitful dialogue with the European\r\nUnion. We hope that all that will lead to concrete\r\npositive results in the near future.\r\nAlso, I am pleased to announce here that the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has agreed\r\nto assist Iraq in the training of its security forces. I\r\nespecially welcome the upcoming conference of\r\nneighbouring countries and other friendly countries,\r\nwith the objective of empowering the Iraqi people to\r\nface its challenges and dangers and of establishing\r\nstability in Iraq.\r\nIt is our duty to coordinate our efforts in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism and to exchange information. It is\r\nalso our duty to ensure that our national borders are\r\nmore secure, so that we can halt the infiltration of\r\nterrorists into Iraq and put an end to their destructive\r\nactivities. In that context, we call upon all friendly and\r\npeace-loving nations to stand by Iraq; we need their\r\nimmediate assistance. We need more assistance from\r\nthe multinational force, and we need a broadening of\r\nthe base of countries contributing troops to that force,\r\nso that it will be better equipped and more determined\r\nto confront terrorism and to provide security protection\r\nfor the United Nations and its agencies when they\r\nreturn to Iraq.\r\nMy Government is committed to the\r\nreconstruction and development of the national\r\neconomy and is working with the World Bank, the\r\nUnited Nations system and the International Monetary\r\nFund to complete the reforms under way and enhance\r\nIraq’s prospects for welfare and prosperity, so that it\r\ncan become effective as a trading partner of other\r\nnations. The problem of foreign debt has emerged as\r\nthe most serious obstacle on that road. Our debts\r\namount to billions of dollars, which is beyond our\r\ncapacity to repay. This places an unjust burden on the\r\nIraqi people, since those debts arose from the\r\nprohibitive costs improperly incurred by the former\r\nregime in its unjustified wars, its support for\r\ninternational terrorism, its acquisition of weapons of\r\nmass destruction and its plunder of our national\r\nresources.\r\nWith good intentions and rational management,\r\nIraq hopes to reach agreement with the Paris Club by\r\nthe end of this year in order to achieve substantial\r\nreductions in our debts. Here, I would like to express\r\nour gratitude to those countries that have decided to\r\nwrite off their loans to Iraq, and I appeal to other\r\ncreditor nations to show the same generosity. Without\r\ntheir assistance, we will not be able to reconstruct Iraq\r\nand attract the foreign investment that would enhance\r\nour ability to defeat terrorism and improve security for\r\nthe Iraqi people, ensuring increased economic benefits\r\nfor the region and entire world. Also, I appeal to donor\r\ncountries that have pledged generous financial\r\nassistance to fulfil their obligations in order to help us\r\nreconstruct our country. We welcome the meeting of\r\ndonor countries scheduled to be convened next month\r\nin Tokyo. Such financial assistance will create an\r\natmosphere of optimism that will allow us to leave the\r\npast totally behind and will help us finance reforms and\r\ndevelopment projects on the ground. In addition, we\r\nhope that Iraq’s friends will provide financial\r\nassistance to ensure the success of our democratic\r\nelections.\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nWe seek international assistance from the United\r\nNations for the special Iraqi court in order to ensure\r\nthat all defendants, whatever serious crimes they may\r\nbe charged with, receive fair trials within the justice\r\nsystem. That would help Iraq free itself from the\r\npernicious shackles of the past.\r\nWe stress that the efforts and resources\r\ncommitted by the international community to promote\r\nIraq’s democracy and revive its economy shall not have\r\nbeen committed in vain. They may even have a\r\npositive impact on the entire region and the world as a\r\nwhole, creating a climate conducive to peace, security\r\nand international and regional cooperation on the basis\r\nof respect for mutual interests.\r\nWe highly appreciate the role and good offices of\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan in helping us lay the\r\nfoundations of freedom and democracy. We also pay\r\ntribute to Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, former Personal Envoy\r\nof the Secretary-General, for his work on the\r\nconstitution of the interim Iraqi Government. We also\r\nwelcome the appointment of Mr. Ashraf Qazi as\r\nMr. Brahimi’s successor. We further welcome the\r\nassistance team dispatched by the United Nations to\r\nhelp us meet our obligation to convene general\r\nelections in January.\r\nWe look forward to welcoming United Nations\r\npersonnel in Iraq to help see us through an effective\r\npolitical process and reconstruction. We warmly look\r\nforward to the return of all United Nations agencies to\r\nfulfil their noble mission in Iraq.\r\nOn this occasion, I wish to recall with deep\r\nanguish and sorrow the destruction of the United\r\nNations headquarters in Baghdad just over a year ago\r\nin a brutal and barbaric terrorist attack that claimed the\r\nlives of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, a brilliant\r\ninternational figure, and of other United Nations staff\r\nmembers in the international compound. Their memory\r\nwill remain a vivid testimony for the promotion of\r\ndemocracy and stability in Iraq. I stress our\r\ndetermination to defeat the cowardly terrorists who\r\ntarget the lives of foreign workers who come to Iraq to\r\nhelp us fulfil our noble mission.\r\nIraq follows closely the challenges that face the\r\ncountries of the world, including the emergence of new\r\nforms of terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction, the need to reduce poverty, the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nrespect for human rights and the consolidation of\r\ndemocracy and equality. In that regard, Iraq appeals to\r\nthe United Nations in particular to strive even harder,\r\nto combat and eradicate the horrendous scourge of\r\nterrorism. That struggle calls for new ideas and firmer\r\nresolve to implement the existing agreements. It is\r\nimportant that we affirm the commitment of the\r\nGovernment and people of Iraq to succeed in this\r\nbattle.\r\nTerrorism is a disease that is spreading\r\nthroughout the world, employing misleading slogans.\r\nTerrorists have killed numerous people in the name of\r\nIslam in New York, Turkey, the Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia, Bali, Madrid, Baghdad and elsewhere. They\r\nare criminals who commit their evil acts without mercy\r\nand evince only a taste for barbarism and bloodshed.\r\nToday, they have chosen Iraq as their battleground\r\nbecause they fear the success of the Iraqi experience\r\nand the restoration of Iraq’s stability, development and\r\ndemocratic institution-building. They will reap nothing\r\nbut failure and total defeat.\r\nThus, our struggle is the United Nations struggle,\r\nour victory will be its victory and our defeat will be its\r\ndefeat. Indeed, the values of democracy, freedom,\r\njustice and equality for all, irrespective of gender,\r\ncolour, faith or race, are common human values. There\r\nis no room or excuse for those who seek to divide our\r\nworld by making a distinction of Muslims, which is\r\nextremely damaging to the unity of human society,\r\npeace and security.\r\nFurthermore, we believe in the importance of\r\nconsolidating peace and stability in the Middle East on\r\nthe basis of United Nations resolutions, of respect for\r\nmutual rights and of a just and comprehensive peace.\r\nLet me appeal today before the international\r\ncommunity, both to those who supported the war in\r\nIraq and to those who opposed it, as well as to the\r\nUnited Nations itself, not to remain neutral or idle in\r\nthe struggle, but to join us for our sake as well as for\r\ntheir own. The fulfilment of the Iraqi people’s dream of\r\na free, stable and prosperous Iraq, with good standing\r\nin the family of peace-loving nations, will strengthen\r\nour capacity and resolve to achieve justice and peace,\r\nto defeat terrorism and violence, and to end all forms\r\nof division and hatred among nations. Let us stand side\r\nby side as one international family in order to achieve\r\nour noble cause.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nMinister of the Republic of Iraq for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Ayad Allawi, Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Iraq, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jean Asselborn, Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nImmigration of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\r\nMr. Asselborn (Luxembourg) (spoke in French):\r\nIt is a special honour for me, as a member of the new\r\nGovernment of Luxembourg and its Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Immigration, to take the floor for\r\nthe first time before this gathering of the nations of the\r\nworld.\r\nYou, sir, have acceded to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at a time when decisions fraught\r\nwith consequences for the future of our Organization\r\nmust be prepared and discussed. Our Secretary-General\r\nhas reminded us that the United Nations is at a\r\ncrossroads. I have no doubt that, under your skilled and\r\nwise leadership, our General Assembly will be able\r\neffectively and decisively to provide constructive and\r\nconsensual responses to the great issues of our time.\r\nThe session ahead, leading us to the\r\ncommemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations, must be one of\r\nrenewal for multilateralism. I can assure you, Sir, that\r\nmy country — a founding Member of the United\r\nNations — intends to contribute actively to that crucial\r\nwork, in particular within the presidency of the Council\r\nof the European Union, to which Luxembourg will\r\naccede on 1 January 2005, following the current\r\npresidency of the Netherlands. It goes without saying\r\nthat I fully subscribe to the statement made by my\r\ncolleague, Mr. Bernard Bot, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Netherlands, before this Assembly.\r\nFrom this moment until the sixtieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, three themes will be the focus of\r\nour attention: issues linked to the maintenance of peace\r\nand security; the complex question of development and\r\nits financing; and United Nations reform.\r\nWe must begin this genuine relaunching of\r\nmultilateral cooperation first of all in the area of the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security, basing our action\r\non the United Nations Charter. While regional crises\r\nand civil wars have multiplied in various areas of the\r\nglobe, in particular on the African continent over the\r\npast year, history has taught us, often tragically and\r\npainfully, that peace and stability can only be\r\nmaintained and guaranteed within the framework of an\r\ninternational order based on the rule of law and shared\r\nstrong and effective institutions based on fundamental\r\nshared values. This has been stated in our superb\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the\r\nsubsequent normative instruments that supplemented it.\r\nThis is also the lesson learned from the fratricidal\r\nhorrors and conflicts of the past century between\r\nmember States of the European Union, which now we\r\nare gratified to see expanded to 25 members.\r\nIn that context, we look with concern toward the\r\nMiddle and Near East, where situations of tension and\r\nof open conflict seem to be worsening. Regarding the\r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, we must emphatically\r\nrecall here, given a situation characterized by\r\nnumerous impasses on all sides, that the path of\r\nnegotiation and compromise remains the only\r\nreasonable path and that the road map remains the only\r\nway to achieve a negotiated solution between the\r\nparties, based on the coexistence of two States, namely,\r\nan independent and viable Palestinian State, living in\r\npeace next to Israel, within secure and recognized\r\nborders. This was also vigorously reaffirmed by the\r\nQuartet the day before yesterday. In the same way, any\r\nwithdrawal by Israel from the Gaza Strip must take\r\nplace within the context of the political process\r\ndescribed by the road map.\r\nThe unanimous adoption of Security Council\r\nresolution 1546 (2004) on the situation in Iraq and the\r\nsubsequent restoration of Iraqi sovereignty constitute\r\nan important stage in the process of political, social\r\nand economic reconstruction of this battered country.\r\nThe European Union, for its part, adopted in early\r\nSeptember a set of measures designed to further\r\nstrengthen the European commitment to Iraq. We hope\r\nthat conditions will soon be such that the United\r\nNations will be able to fully play its proper role, in\r\nparticular regarding the political process, the\r\npreparation for elections, humanitarian assistance and\r\nreconstruction.\r\nLuxembourg has also been following with the\r\ngreatest attention developments in the situation in the\r\nGreat Lakes region, the Western Balkans, and, in\r\nparticular, in Kosovo, as well as in Darfur in Sudan.\r\nMy country fully associates itself with the positions\r\npresented here by my Dutch colleague on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nThe preservation of peace, crisis prevention and\r\nmanagement and peacekeeping are among the noblest\r\ntasks of our Organization. The Security Council has an\r\nimportant role to play here. We should not hesitate to\r\nconsider innovative solutions in defining new\r\napproaches and institutional processes to strengthen\r\nour collective capacity for prevention and action on the\r\nbasis of the Charter.\r\nHere I would like to welcome the measures taken\r\nby the Secretary-General regarding the prevention of\r\ngenocide. I would venture to hope that the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change will be able\r\nto put before us proposals to both improve our capacity\r\nfor shared action and cope with the new threats to\r\npeace and security, among which, first and foremost,\r\nare terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. United Nations instruments in fighting\r\nterrorism were recently enhanced by the adoption of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1535 (2004) and the\r\nimplementation measures which flow from it.\r\nHowever, the recent report of the Analytical Support\r\nand Sanctions Monitoring Team of the Security\r\nCouncil Committee established pursuant to resolution\r\n1267 (1999) concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban and\r\nAssociated Individuals and Entities reminded us that a\r\ngreat deal still remains to be done to put an end to\r\nthese despicable and unacceptable practices which\r\nleave so many families throughout the world in\r\nmourning.\r\nThe fight against terrorism cannot be won solely\r\nthrough the use of military and police means. We must\r\nstrike at its roots, which spawn hate, brutality and the\r\nsenseless destruction of human lives. The core of any\r\nmultilateral system is the right of all peoples and every\r\nhuman being to live in peace and dignity.\r\nThe threat of weapons of mass destruction also\r\nremains a concern of highest priority. While significant\r\nprogress has been made, disturbing news has reached\r\nus over the last few months from other regions of the\r\nglobe, in particular from Iran and from the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. In each of these cases, the\r\nnecessary clarifications and full guarantees must be\r\nprovided, particularly within the framework of strict\r\nrespect for the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA) regimes. Here, I would like to emphasize that\r\nthe 2005 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons must provide an\r\nopportunity for reaffirming the validity and relevance\r\nof the shared quest for solutions to the complex issues\r\nof non-proliferation.\r\nRegarding all of these cases linked to the\r\nmaintenance of peace and international security, the\r\nUnited Nations will find a reliable and committed\r\npartner in the European Union, which has made the\r\nemergence of effective multilateralism one of its\r\npriorities for the security strategy it adopted in\r\nDecember 2003. It is, indeed, with pride that I add that\r\nLuxembourg has also been shouldering its\r\npeacekeeping responsibilities by contributing military\r\ncontingents to the Kosovo Force and to the\r\nInternational Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan,\r\nwhich are now under the command of the European\r\nCorps.\r\nThe issue of development is and must remain the\r\nfocus of the international community’s attention. This\r\nis the most important point in this context. While\r\nmillions of human beings continue to live in\r\nunacceptable conditions, our rallying around the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nmust be constant and indeed stepped up, given the fact\r\nthat many States, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa,\r\nstill experience extreme difficulty in making progress\r\nto meet the 2015 deadline.\r\nFor its part, Luxembourg is ready to shoulder its\r\nduties in the indispensable joint international efforts. In\r\n2003, our official development assistance (ODA) in\r\nLuxembourg reached 0.81 per cent of our gross\r\nnational product and the goal of having this figure\r\nreach one per cent in the years to come is part of the\r\nprogramme of the new Government that was formed in\r\nJuly of this year. The struggle against poverty and the\r\ncommitment to sustainable development on the global\r\nlevel are also major objectives of the policy of\r\ncooperation in Luxembourg, the policy that we are\r\nimplementing together with our partners in a spirit of\r\npartnership and participation. In our actions to ensure\r\ncooperation, particular emphasis must be placed on the\r\ncontinuation of international efforts targeting\r\nreproductive health, in particular, combating the\r\nhorrendous scourge of HIV/AIDS.\r\nIn addition to an increase in ODA on the global\r\nscale, other sources of financing can be used, and the\r\ninitiative of Presidents Lula and Chirac has charted the\r\nway for a number of interesting ideas in this respect.\r\nWe believe that it is critical to maintain the Monterrey\r\nConsensus as a whole. Any effective development\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nstrategy in the medium- and long-term must be based\r\non a proper combination of elements such as ODA,\r\ninternational trade, direct foreign investment and the\r\ndomestic efforts of the countries involved, particularly\r\nregarding capacity reinforcement, strengthening of\r\ngovernance and the rule of law. In this regard, I am\r\nconvinced that all efforts must be further developed to\r\nachieve a positive conclusion to the Doha development\r\nround.\r\nAs Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration,\r\nI must mention an innovation in our national political\r\ncontext, as did our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\non 29 January 2004, in an inciteful speech to the\r\nEuropean Parliament in Brussels regarding the growing\r\nimportance of the problem of migration, particularly\r\nfor Europe. This issue must be addressed through a\r\ncareful management of migration flows by focusing on\r\nintegration and international cooperation. Decisive\r\naction against organized crime, in particular crime\r\nlinked to any kind of trafficking in human beings, is an\r\nindispensable corollary to this.\r\nWe are called upon to step up our efforts during\r\nthe year to come to prepare for a significant event,\r\nnamely, the September 2005 summit, and which, in\r\nUnited Nations jargon, is being called the “major\r\nevent”. Five years after the Millennium Summit, this\r\nmeeting of the highest political leaders on the planet\r\nshould provide an opportunity to define a new\r\nsynthesis — a new global agenda — at the dawn of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nIndeed, we face many significant challenges.\r\nTogether, we must review all of the commitments\r\nundertaken in the Millennium Declaration and at the\r\nmajor conferences of the 1990s, assess their\r\nimplementation and, within the Organization, make\r\nany adjustments and adaptations that a changing global\r\ncontext requires — all without compromising the level\r\nof the shared ambitions that inspire us. We must see to\r\nit that the new global agenda expresses the hopes and\r\naspirations of the entire international community. In\r\nparticular, development must continue to be a focus of\r\nthe attention it deserves. There is also a need to open\r\nour Organization up to the new debates and the new\r\nissues that are emerging in the area of the maintenance\r\nof peace and security.\r\nNone of the foregoing issues are fiefdoms of a\r\nparticular State or group of States. Rather, they are\r\nconcerns shared by all Member States and, as such,\r\nmust be managed jointly within the multilateral\r\ninstitutions that form our common heritage. The\r\nvitality and relevance of our Organization is the key to\r\nthe effort to redefine the terms of the international\r\nagenda by giving priority to the concepts of\r\ninterdependence and solidarity. While the goals are\r\nvital, the risks are significant, and, together, we must\r\nchart a coordinated, inclusive and balanced path that\r\nwill allow each and every one of us to participate fully\r\nand to express our aspirations and expectations.\r\nTo achieve those lofty goals we need, first of all,\r\nto promote the development of a new mindset in our\r\ndeliberations. After the divisions and controversies of\r\nrecent years, the international community must once\r\nagain come together and close ranks around shared,\r\njoint objectives. In that way the United Nations will\r\nremain the pre-eminent seat of international legitimacy\r\nand a vital centre for multilateral action, as the\r\nSecretary-General recently said. It is that new mindset\r\nthat must inspire our shared activities as we move\r\ntowards next year’s major event.\r\nWe also need to agree on a procedure that will\r\nensure the participation of all, guarantee the necessary\r\nbalance among the various aspects of the process and\r\nguide us towards greater coordination on the substance\r\nof the political messages to be formulated. In all\r\nevents, rest assured that my country and its partners in\r\nthe European Union are ready to participate fully in\r\nthat debate.\r\nIn the context of a renewal of multilateralism, as I\r\nhave tried to outline it here, reform of the United\r\nNations has pride of place. Our institutions must be\r\nbetter adapted to meet new challenges, as well as to\r\nfulfil their present mandates. The genuine renewal of\r\nthe United Nations system must be reflected in a\r\npalpable strengthening of the tools for analysis,\r\ndecision and action available to us. Effective\r\nmultilateralism must be expressed through the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations system as a whole.\r\nBy adopting a more global approach, we see\r\nreform not as a zero-sum game, but as a positive-sum\r\ngame, in which each player and each institution\r\nbenefits from the new impetus thus provided.\r\nSignificant progress was already made in the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly during the fifty-\r\neighth session, under the leadership of the former\r\nPresident, Mr. Julian Hunte. Those efforts now remain\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nto be translated into action as well as continued and\r\nintensified.\r\nSecurity Council reform, which has been in\r\ndiscussion for more than a decade, must be carried out,\r\nso that that vital body can better reflect the realities of\r\ntoday’s world; indeed, it is both a prerequisite for the\r\nCouncil’s legitimacy and a guarantee for the\r\neffectiveness of its action. More active interaction\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly and a better coordination of their roles, as\r\nwell as enhanced transparency regarding States not\r\nmembers of the Security Council, should form the\r\nframework of any future enlargement of the Council.\r\nThe restructuring of the work of the Economic\r\nand Social Council and the Main Committees of the\r\nGeneral Assembly should be conducted with\r\ndetermination and courage so that more focused and\r\nbetter organized activities can gain greater relevance\r\nand have greater political impact on the substantive\r\nproblems being addressed.\r\nThe strengthening of the rule of law on a global\r\nscale, as called for by the Secretary-General, and, in\r\nparticular, the consolidation and ultimate\r\nuniversalization of the International Criminal Court,\r\nshould be among our highest priorities, along with the\r\nprotection of human rights — the vital importance of\r\nwhich I would like to emphasize once again.\r\nFinally, I would be remiss were I to fail to\r\nmention the Secretariat staff and other United Nations\r\npersonnel, who are carrying out an extraordinarily\r\ndifficult mission with courage and dedication, and\r\nindeed sometimes, as we know, risking their very lives.\r\nIt is crucial that we be able, within the framework of\r\nthis year’s budgetary discussions for the year, to\r\nprovide the Organization with the resources,\r\nparticularly the financial resources to fulfil the\r\nmandates that we have conferred upon it, especially in\r\nregard to peacekeeping operations. It is also vital that\r\nthe Organization adopt a rigorous policy regarding the\r\nprotection of United Nations personnel, who are acting\r\non our behalf in often dangerous conditions in all\r\ncorners of the globe.\r\nIt seems that to put a curse on someone, one has\r\nonly to wish for them to live in interesting times. I do\r\nnot know if we are living under a curse, but I do know\r\nthat we are living in an interesting time: a time of\r\ndebate, a time of restructuring, a time of choice and of\r\nthe relaunching of international cooperation. Let us\r\nseize this opportunity and breathe new life into the\r\nUnited Nations, which has been proven itself to be\r\nindispensable. But let us also admit that the choice of\r\nmultilateralism is a demanding one, and one that\r\nrequires of us all an increased readiness to call into\r\nquestion our old certainties and to accept new\r\napproaches within a renewed institutional framework.\r\nOn the path towards that renewal, let us draw\r\ninspiration from the magnificent lines of the Spanish\r\npoet, Antonio Machado, and I quote:\r\n“Traveller, your footsteps\r\nAre the road, and nothing else;\r\nTraveller, there is no road.\r\nThe road is made by walking;\r\nWalking makes the road”.\r\nI am confident that together we will have the\r\nvision and the courage to take that first step, and the\r\nsteps that follow, on that ambitious path.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Ahmed Aboul Gheit,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Egypt.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): It is\r\na great pleasure to have Mr. Jean Ping presiding over\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I am\r\nconfident that his wealth of experience and the friendly\r\nties that his sisterly country enjoys with all countries of\r\nthe world will be a major asset for the Assembly as it\r\ndischarges its tasks.\r\nThe success of the present session will build upon\r\nthe accomplishments of the fifty-eighth session under\r\nthe leadership of the previous President, Mr. Julian\r\nHunte, who made an important contribution to the\r\nrevitalization of the role of the General Assembly in\r\nvarious fields.\r\nI would also like to express our appreciation to\r\nthe Secretary-General for his tireless efforts to enhance\r\nthe status of the Organization and to strengthen its role\r\nin the international arena, in particular in the area of\r\nregional and national development.\r\nAt the outset of the fifty-ninth session we must\r\nscrutinize the international environment in which it is\r\nbeing held. We have to consider world events to\r\ndetermine their direction, to decide where we stand on\r\nthem and to understand their impact, whether positive\r\nor negative, on the achievement of our shared goal: the\r\npromotion of international peace and security.\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nIndeed, we need to pause to see where this world\r\nand this international community are heading. Is it and\r\nare we ascending towards upholding the values of\r\ndemocracy, justice and the rule of law, or are we\r\ndescending into tyranny, the law of the jungle and the\r\nimposition of the policies of fait accompli? Can it be\r\nsaid that events in the world today emanate from a\r\ngenuine belief in the might of right, or do they, most\r\nregrettably, represent a consolidation of the arrogance\r\nof power?\r\nThe events witnessed by the world today are a\r\ncause of grave concern to all those who believe in the\r\ntenets and principles on which the international system\r\nwas established. We are witnessing the collapse of\r\nnoble values and the disintegration of principles once\r\nthought unassailable. National sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity are no longer sufficient to prevent\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of States. Indeed,\r\nthose internal affairs have themselves become pretexts\r\nfor those who wish to impose their policies on others.\r\nThe international situation forces us to consider\r\nthe critical question of what we seek from this world\r\nand what we have offered in return. We claim that we\r\nwant a world free from conflict and wars, but what\r\nhave we done to create such a world? We claim that we\r\nwant an international community governed by legality\r\nand the rule of law, as the Secretary-General said on\r\nTuesday, but are we seriously upholding the values of\r\nlegality and law? We claim that we wish to see all\r\npeoples enjoying democracy, but should States not\r\npractice democracy in the conduct of their foreign\r\nrelations as well?\r\nRelations among States are by nature volatile and\r\neasy to break, but they are reparable. It may be difficult\r\nat times to repair them, but the calculations pertaining\r\nto constantly changing interests will eventually make it\r\npossible to do so. Relations among peoples, however,\r\nare different. Their wounds are readily inflamed and\r\nheal slowly or hardly at all. It is therefore incumbent\r\nupon us, in our feverish attempts to achieve our own\r\ninterests, to take special care to avoid flashpoints\r\nbetween peoples, civilizations and cultures. Their\r\nmemories store all of their experiences and\r\ntribulations. Nothing stored in their collective memory\r\nfades or disappears with time.\r\nFor more than a decade now, Egypt has called\r\nand continues to call for the convening of an\r\ninternational conference under United Nations auspices\r\nto consider the phenomenon of terrorism and to agree\r\non means to combat it through effective collective\r\ninternational efforts. Proceeding from our belief in the\r\nimportance and centrality of the role of the United\r\nNations in the coordination of international efforts to\r\ncombat terrorism, as exercised through the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council, we propose that\r\nthe Assembly establish an open-ended working group\r\nto consider proposals to increase the effectiveness and\r\nefficiency of the United Nations and its ability to\r\nachieve international anti-terrorism goals. That could\r\nbe accompanied by the convening of regional\r\npreparatory meetings to catalogue regional needs and\r\nareas conducive to international cooperation, which\r\ncould in turn ultimately lead to the adoption at an\r\ninternational summit of a draft comprehensive\r\nframework convention to combat terrorism.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to describe\r\nthe situation in our part of the world and the threats\r\nand challenges it faces.\r\nThe main threat to the Middle East flows from\r\nthe continued acquisition by some of nuclear weapons.\r\nWhile we all agree on the dangers posed by those\r\nweapons and on the need to halt their proliferation as\r\none step towards eliminating them and freeing\r\nhumanity from the threat they represent, the\r\ninternational community continues to address the\r\nquestion of weapons of mass destruction selectively.\r\nWhile the international community seeks to impose a\r\nstrict system to monitor the imports of all Member\r\nStates within the non-proliferation regime — which,\r\nincidentally, includes all Arab States — it turns a blind\r\neye to the ongoing stockpiling of nuclear capabilities\r\nby one party in the region.\r\nI invite all to question whether it is acceptable for\r\nthe threat of nuclear proliferation to continue to loom\r\nover the Middle East. I leave it to all to decide whether\r\nthe international approach to the question is fair or is\r\none of double standards; whether it is capable of\r\naddressing those dangers and threats, or whether we\r\nare in need of urgent radical change. The ongoing\r\napplication of double standards will not only\r\nexacerbate the risks of nuclear proliferation and\r\nweaken the belief in the credibility and centrality of the\r\nrelevant international regime, but also aggravate the\r\ntense situation in the Middle East. In order to ease that\r\ntension and to avert those dangers, in 1990 President\r\nMubarak launched the Egyptian initiative to create a\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nzone free from weapons of mass destruction in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nIn the year that has elapsed between the opening\r\nof the fifty-eighth and the fifty-ninth sessions, the\r\nsuffering of the Palestinian people has continued. The\r\nPalestinian people has been subject to acts of\r\naggression and its legitimate rights have continued to\r\nbe violated. The tragedies visited upon Palestinians\r\nhave become a permanent item of newscasts and\r\nnewspaper headlines. A new report emerges every day\r\nof the demolition of homes, the destruction of\r\ninfrastructure, the targeting of unarmed civilians,\r\nassassinations, collective punishments, and the\r\nimposition of curfews and closures. There is no end in\r\nsight to such policies. All this suffering has been met\r\nby an inexplicable international silence, with the\r\nexception of some timid expression of dissatisfaction\r\nor, at best, displeasure at events unfolding there. Such\r\nresponses entrench, rather than change, the situation of\r\nfait accompli.\r\nIsrael also continues to build the separation wall\r\non Palestinian lands. The wall separates students from\r\ntheir schools, workers from their factories and farmers\r\nfrom their fields. Had Israel’s objective in the\r\nconstruction of the wall truly been to ensure its own\r\nsecurity, it would have built it on its own land. The\r\nadvisory opinion of the International Court of Justice\r\ndeclared the wall’s construction illegal and called for a\r\nhalt to construction activities and for the removal of\r\nthe sections already constructed. The opinion sent a\r\nstrong message to the international community in\r\ngeneral, and to Israel in particular, to the effect that the\r\ntorch of justice still burns bright. It may have seemed\r\nto flicker, but it has not been extinguished. The scales\r\nof justice still prevail. They may seem to have been\r\nupset, but they have neither fallen nor been tipped.\r\nOur region needs the construction of bridges that\r\nconnect, not walls that separate. Our region needs a\r\nchannel for the hopes for a promising future, not\r\nbarriers that hold the region captive to the past and its\r\ntribulations. Our region needs the serious action and\r\nsincere cooperation of all in order to dislodge the\r\npolitical peace process from its current impasse and put\r\nit back on track.\r\nThe way out of this bloody dilemma is well\r\nknown. It was laid down by the international Quartet in\r\nthe road map that enjoys the support of the entire\r\ninternational community. The ultimate destination of\r\nthat path is also well known. It was enunciated by\r\nUnited States President George Bush in his vision of\r\nthe establishment of two independent States, Palestine\r\nand Israel, living side by side in peace and security.\r\nThat is the road before us; those are its landmarks\r\nand its goals. There is neither time for waiting nor\r\nroom for foot-dragging. Prompt and effective action is\r\nneeded to break the cycle of violence, to restore calm\r\nand to resume the process of political negotiations.\r\nSuch negotiations are the one and only way to end the\r\nArab-Israeli conflict.\r\nIn that regard, Israel’s intended withdrawal from\r\nthe Gaza Strip could be a significant step. If the\r\nwithdrawal takes place in a rational, disciplined and\r\norderly manner, it could enable us to begin to\r\novercome the crisis and to put the peace process back\r\non track. However, if it is carried out in an attitude of\r\nstubbornness and short-sightedness, it will lead only to\r\ntension and further violence.\r\nIn order to achieve the goal of an Israeli\r\nwithdrawal, a number of elements must be ensured. In\r\nparticular, the withdrawal must take place as an\r\nintegral and clear part of the road map, and it must be\r\nfull and complete. The withdrawal must include all\r\ncrossing points, the seaport and the airport; otherwise,\r\nit will be just another way to impose a blockade on and\r\nconfinement of the Palestinian people. A complete\r\nIsraeli withdrawal means not only the departure of\r\noccupation forces from the Gaza Strip, but also an end\r\nto the policy of incursions, raids and assassinations,\r\nwhich must be followed by a withdrawal from all the\r\noccupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank.\r\nDespite all the efforts and appeals for peace, the\r\nbloodshed continues unabated in the Middle East. We\r\nhad pinned our hopes on the transfer of sovereignty to\r\nthe Iraqi people at the end of June and on the formation\r\nof an Iraqi Government and National Council. It was\r\nhoped that those would be the first steps towards the\r\nrestoration by the Iraqis of their full sovereignty on\r\ntheir own national soil and towards ending the foreign\r\npresence in that long-suffering country. However, the\r\nevents of recent months and days have shown — and\r\ncurrent events continue to show every day — that the\r\nIraqi people continue to live in conditions that are far\r\nfrom stable.\r\nWe wonder whose interests are served by the\r\nevents in Iraq. Who is to benefit from the destruction\r\nof that country, with its age-old civilization? Will the\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nevents taking place in Iraq remain confined to that\r\ncountry, or will they spread beyond its borders like\r\nfire, causing destruction and desolation in the region as\r\nthey have done in Iraq?\r\nWe call upon all parties to respect Iraq’s\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. The people and the\r\nState of Iraq desperately need a breathing space for\r\ncalm reflection on the best way to bring the country out\r\nof the devastating spiral of violence. We call upon the\r\nUnited Nations to continue its pivotal role in helping\r\nthe people of Iraq to rebuild their constitutional and\r\nlegislative institutions as a first step towards the\r\nrebuilding of Iraq by the Iraqis themselves.\r\nMoreover, there is an urgent humanitarian\r\nproblem in Darfur — indeed, a real humanitarian\r\ntragedy that requires urgent international action to\r\ncontain it. But is it inevitable that such an effort take\r\nthe form of interference in the Sudan’s internal affairs\r\nand violation of its sovereignty? Can we not provide\r\nhumanitarian assistance and relief to Darfur’s\r\ninhabitants without encroaching upon the Sudan’s\r\nnational sovereignty? Are there enough military forces\r\nin the world to be dispatched as invaders to every area\r\nthat is afflicted by a humanitarian crisis?\r\nThe affairs of the Sudan, with its ethnic\r\ncomposition and its religious and cultural heritage, are\r\nby nature complex. It is our duty to help solve those\r\ncomplex and difficult problems, not to make them\r\nmore so.\r\nThe Sudan has signed, with the United Nations, a\r\nframework for cooperation to solve the problem in\r\nDarfur and to ensure humanitarian access to the\r\ncivilians in the region. That augurs well for the early\r\nalleviation of this humanitarian tragedy, which\r\nthreatens to have dire consequences for the entire\r\nregion. We call upon the international community not\r\nto confine itself to criticizing one party or another and\r\nnot to lay the blame on one set of policies or another.\r\nWhat is more important and useful is serious action to\r\nhelp the Sudanese people to overcome the crisis.\r\nEgypt believes that, in order to effectively face\r\nthe challenges and threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity, we must improve the working methods of the\r\nUnited Nations. Therefore, we have participated\r\nseriously — and will continue to do so — in the\r\nexercise of strengthening and revitalizing the United\r\nNations and its organs. It is our hope that that exercise\r\nwill be comprehensive, balanced and transparent and\r\nthat it will be carried out in full respect for the\r\nmandates that established the various organs of the\r\nUnited Nations. In that context, we need to reaffirm the\r\nneed to revitalize the role of the General Assembly and\r\nto ensure respect for and implementation of its\r\nresolutions by establishing an effective follow-up\r\nmechanism.\r\nI now turn from the wider context of United\r\nNations reform to the most sensitive reform issue:\r\nreform and expansion of the Security Council. The\r\nsensitivity of that issue clearly stems from the\r\nCouncil’s increasing role in international affairs and its\r\neffect on many vital interests and on the international\r\nbalances of power.\r\nHere, I should like clearly to state Egypt’s\r\nposition, which is based on our membership in the\r\nGroup of African States and the fact that we have the\r\nhonour to coordinate the Non-Aligned Movement\r\n(NAM) working group on this issue. Egypt hopes that\r\nthe deliberations on this subject will result in both\r\nreform of the Council and expansion of its\r\nmembership. The United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity as a whole will not gain much if the\r\nprocess is limited to expanding the Council’s\r\nmembership without truly improving its working\r\nmethods so that it can better represent the general\r\nmembership of the Organization and have greater\r\ncapacity to maintain international peace and security.\r\nEgypt is fully committed to the Declaration of the\r\n1997 Harare Summit of the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU), which affirmed Africa’s right to two\r\npermanent seats and three non-permanent seats on an\r\nexpanded Security Council. We are also committed to\r\nthe positions of the Non-Aligned Movement with\r\nregard to increasing the membership of the Council to\r\nat least 26 member States. Such an expansion could be\r\nconfined to the non-permanent category should the\r\nexpansion of both membership categories prove\r\ndifficult.\r\nWhat about the composition of the Council? We\r\ncall for guaranteed representation of all cultures and\r\ncivilizations in an expanded Security Council on the\r\nbasis of the current geographical distribution in the\r\nUnited Nations. We believe that the Council will not be\r\nable to effectively carry out its duties in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security unless\r\nit is more aware of the nature and circumstances\r\nprevailing in all societies and of the cultural and\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nhistorical heritage on which they base and formulate\r\ntheir policies.\r\nHere, we must reaffirm the legitimate right of\r\nmore than 1 billion Muslims and more than 300 million\r\nArabs to be represented in the Council on an equal\r\nfooting with those who represent other cultures and\r\ncivilizations. In that context, I wish to recall the\r\nsignificant contributions made by Egypt at the regional\r\nand international levels and its central role in the\r\nAfrican, Arab and Islamic spheres. Also noteworthy is\r\nEgypt’s role in the Middle East and among developing\r\nand emerging economies. As a founding Member of the\r\nUnited Nations, Egypt has made well-known\r\ncontributions to the implementation of the purposes\r\nand principles of the Organization and to United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations. Egypt also played a\r\npivotal role in establishing the League of Arab States,\r\nthe OAU, the African Union, NAM and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. In addition, I\r\nwish to recall that Egypt possesses the components of a\r\nregional Power in its comprehensive sense, be it\r\neconomic, military or human. Egypt also enjoys social\r\nand political stability. Its diplomatic outreach is among\r\nthe largest, and over the years it has developed strong\r\ninternational ties throughout the world.\r\nEgypt has in the past expressed its conviction that\r\nit is eminently qualified to assume the responsibility of\r\na permanent seat in an expanded Security Council, on\r\nthe basis of the Harare Declaration. We reiterate that\r\nthe considerations to which I referred demonstrate that\r\nEgypt is clearly eligible, and has the capacity, to take\r\non the responsibilities of membership of the Security\r\nCouncil, in accordance with Article 23 of the Charter.\r\nWe believe that such membership could be based on a\r\nsystem of rotation with our African brothers, whereby\r\nwe would fill the additional seats that would be\r\nallocated to our continent, in accordance with any\r\nnewly established status in the Council and with the\r\ngeographic distribution as would be worked out by the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Jan Petersen, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Kingdom of Norway.\r\nMr. Petersen (Norway): When we met here in\r\nthe General Assembly last year, it was against the\r\nbackdrop of the terrible and devastating attack on the\r\nUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad. This year we\r\nare meeting after a number of terrorist attacks, most\r\nrecently the gruesome terrorist attack on children on\r\ntheir very first day of school in Beslan, Russia.\r\nTerrorism is not a new threat. But the scale and\r\nbrutality of recent terrorist operations have altered our\r\nlives and our thinking and forced us to take new\r\nmeasures to protect ourselves against this threat.\r\nTerrorism can strike anywhere and at any time.\r\nTerrorism is a threat to our security; it creates fear and\r\nwant, and severely hampers economic and social\r\ndevelopment. No cause, however legitimate, can justify\r\nacts of terrorism.\r\nThe fight against terrorism must continue to be a\r\ntop priority for the United Nations and the world\r\ncommunity. We must act in accordance with\r\ninternational law and human rights. Democratic values\r\nand the rule of law are our strongest cards in the fight\r\nagainst terror.\r\nWe, the Members of the United Nations, have a\r\nresponsibility to make the Organization robust enough\r\nto address the many tasks we have assigned it. The\r\nchallenges are many. Unified efforts are needed to\r\nbring peace and stability to Iraq. Security Council\r\nresolution 1546 (2004) stresses that the international\r\ncommunity must help the new Iraqi Government in its\r\ncurrent effort to create a better future. However,\r\nfunctional national democracies and constitutional\r\ninstitutions are not created by United Nations\r\nresolutions. In Iraq, they can be created only by the\r\nIraqis themselves. The international community and\r\nthe United Nations can, and should, facilitate and assist\r\nin this process, provided that the necessary security is\r\nensured. Our Government fully supports the efforts of\r\nthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General,\r\nAshraf Qazi, and his team of dedicated women and\r\nmen.\r\nAfghanistan is at a critical juncture. More than\r\n1,000 people, both Afghans and internationals, have\r\nbeen killed there so far this year. Reconstruction efforts\r\nand efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the\r\nmost vulnerable are being hampered. Development\r\nactivities are key elements in ensuring stability and\r\nsecurity. Without security there will be no progress,\r\nand without progress there will be no security. There is\r\na continued need for international security forces. The\r\npolitical process leading to elections is another\r\nessential requirement for stability. The United Nations\r\nmust continue to play an important role.\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nWhile the world is waiting for a political solution\r\nto the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, the\r\nsituation continues to worsen. The construction of the\r\nseparation barrier and the expansion of settlements are\r\nserious threats to the two-State solution.\r\nThe Israeli plan to withdraw from Gaza and four\r\nsettlements in the West Bank could be a step in the\r\nright direction if it is implemented in accordance with\r\nthe road map and Security Council resolutions, and in\r\nkeeping with the vision of a two-State solution.\r\nA viable and well-functioning Palestinian\r\nAuthority is critical to a peaceful solution to the\r\nconflict. The Palestinian leaders themselves must\r\ncontribute by implementing reforms as set out in the\r\nroad map. The Palestinian Authority has a clear\r\nresponsibility to fight Palestinian terrorism.\r\nIn my capacity as Chairman of the Ad Hoc\r\nLiaison Committee for Assistance to the Palestinian\r\nPeople, I am encouraged by the many statements that I\r\nhave heard to the effect that the international\r\ncommunity stands ready to assist in the implementation\r\nof the planned withdrawal. However, key issues must\r\nbe addressed. Most importantly, withdrawal from Gaza\r\nmust be carried out in a way that is conducive to the\r\nnormalization of the Palestinian economy.\r\nNorway, together with other partners in the Ad\r\nHoc Liaison Committee, will host a donor conference\r\nbefore the end of the year. I appeal to the States\r\nMembers of the United Nations to support the\r\nPalestinian Authority.\r\nIn Darfur we are facing another crisis, which is\r\nfirst and foremost a question of the safety and security\r\nof the civilian population, humanitarian access and the\r\nprovision of food, medicine and shelter. The concern of\r\nthe international community was expressed in Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1564 (2004), adopted on Saturday.\r\nAll armed groups must cease the violence. The\r\nNorwegian Government expects the Sudanese\r\nauthorities to fully comply with Security Council\r\nresolutions.\r\nThe Darfur crisis makes it even more important to\r\ncontinue the Naivasha peace process. A comprehensive\r\npeace agreement for southern Sudan will lay the\r\nfoundation for a national solution to the political issues\r\nin Darfur. We welcome the decision to resume the talks\r\nbetween the Government of the Sudan and the Sudan\r\nPeople’s Liberation Army in Kenya. We urge them to\r\nwork without delay to conclude a comprehensive peace\r\nagreement.\r\nTargeting humanitarian personnel in conflict\r\nareas is absolutely unacceptable. Such acts of violence\r\nconstitute grave breaches of international humanitarian\r\nlaw. We are being forced to rethink our approach to\r\nsecurity. It is important, however, to avoid a situation\r\nwhere overly strict security measures prevent the\r\nUnited Nations from acting effectively on the ground.\r\nSuch rules might further distance the civilian\r\npopulation and therefore result in a loss of legitimacy\r\nand local support.\r\nProviding security for United Nations personnel\r\nis not without costs. When we ask the United Nations\r\nto carry out difficult tasks in unsafe environments, we\r\nmust also be willing to cover the expenses involved.\r\nWe look forward to the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendations on the basis of the report of the\r\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change.\r\nThat report will come at a crucial point in time for the\r\nUnited Nations. The United Nations needs to take\r\nearlier and more coordinated action as threats to peace\r\nand security emerge. Such action also needs to be\r\nsustained in a coordinated and effective fashion.\r\nWe agree that our collective security system\r\nneeds reform. Such reform must include, among other\r\nissues, the sensitive question of Security Council\r\nenlargement. We hope that a broad set of concrete\r\nrecommendations by the High-level Panel will enable\r\nus to agree on measures to better meet current and new\r\nthreats and challenges. The Panel should take care to\r\nensure that both hard and soft security issues are\r\naddressed, as well as the linkages between them.\r\nMember States have the responsibility to ensure that\r\nthe Secretary-General’s recommendations, based on the\r\nreport of the Panel, are actively followed up.\r\nThe resolution of armed conflicts is not solely the\r\nprovince of the United Nations. Regional organizations\r\nalso have significant contributions to make — and their\r\ncapacities should be strengthened. The United Nations\r\nis indispensable in delivering legitimacy. Regional\r\norganizations, with their local knowledge, are well\r\nplaced to meet challenges on the ground. Yet the\r\ninstitutional mechanisms for ensuring effective\r\npartnership and real burden-sharing between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations are not in place.\r\nThis situation must be rectified.\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nA case in point is the involvement of the African\r\nUnion (AU) in Sudan. Norway welcomes the response\r\nto the Darfur crisis by the AU and its member States.\r\nThe AU mission must be enhanced both by becoming\r\nmore pro-active and by increasing the number of\r\nparticipants. Norway has supported the AU and the\r\nUnited Nations in providing security and humanitarian\r\nrelief in Darfur. We stand ready to continue to support\r\nthose efforts.\r\nI believe that strengthening Africa’s capacity for\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building is essential if we are\r\nto deal with the challenges that United Nations\r\npeacekeeping is facing. For nearly ten years, Norway\r\nhas contributed to peacekeeping through our Training\r\nfor Peace in Southern Africa Programme. We plan to\r\nexpand that programme to West Africa.\r\nIt is uplifting to see the progress being made in\r\nmany African countries. We applaud the basic\r\nprinciples and political priorities being addressed by\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development and\r\nwelcome last week’s inauguration of the Pan-African\r\nParliament. This strengthening of the political\r\ndimension of regional cooperation testifies to the\r\ndedication of African leaders and holds promise of an\r\neven more active and efficient role for the AU in the\r\nyears to come.\r\nWithout economic growth there will be no\r\nimprovement in welfare and wealth distribution, and\r\nlittle hope of peace and security. International trade\r\nmay be an important engine for creating growth and\r\nwelfare. However, this will not happen by itself. A\r\nsound basis for growth and welfare that benefits all\r\ncountries can be created only by means of fair trade\r\nrules developed through international cooperation. In\r\nthis respect, the World Trade Organization framework\r\nagreement reached in Geneva in July is a milestone.\r\nWe avoided any deadlock or setback, and now we can\r\nrenew our efforts to achieve substantial progress on the\r\nDoha Development Agenda. I noted that in his speech,\r\nPresident Lula da Silva said that “If successful, the\r\nDoha Round could lift more than 500 million people\r\nout of poverty”. This certainly shows the opportunities\r\nof globalization. However, ensuring that economic\r\ngrowth actually improves the livelihoods of ordinary\r\npeople requires adequate domestic policies.\r\nIn an ever more globalized world, we need\r\nforums to develop the international guidelines\r\nnecessary to facilitate cooperation. However, we all\r\nneed to do our part. It has been 10 years since the\r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate\r\nChange entered into force. More than 120 countries\r\nhave ratified the Kyoto Protocol, and we are now\r\nawaiting the ratification that will allow it to enter into\r\nforce. I welcome the news that Russia is seriously\r\nconsidering the ratification of the Protocol, but I regret\r\nthat some countries have not yet been willing to join\r\nforces in facing one of the most serious global\r\nchallenges of our time.\r\nFulfilling the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol\r\nis a first step towards coming to grips with the\r\nchallenge of climate change. The entire international\r\ncommunity, and notably the largest emitters, must\r\nmake a much more ambitious commitment in this field;\r\nwe have no time to lose. In the Arctic region we are\r\nalready experiencing the effects of climate change as\r\nseen in a temperature rise that is substantially greater\r\nthan the global average.\r\nNext year we will take stock of developments\r\nsince the Millennium Declaration was adopted. This is\r\nan opportunity to review progress and, where\r\nnecessary, intensify efforts to fulfil our commitment to\r\nreducing poverty and achieving development. True\r\ngender equality and education for all stand out as\r\ncrucial in this regard. The Summit in 2005 should also\r\nfocus on international efforts to promote peace-\r\nbuilding, reconciliation, global security and respect for\r\nhuman rights. We must take decisive steps during the\r\nnext General Assembly to meet development targets\r\nand create a safer and more peaceful world.\r\nThe United Nations is indispensable as our most\r\nuniversal and representative organization. Norway has\r\ndevoted a great deal of effort to building the\r\nmultilateral system. We are proud of our political and\r\nfinancial contributions to the United Nations system.\r\nWe are eager to see the United Nations strengthened\r\nand reshaped, so that it can remain our most important\r\ninstrument for addressing global challenges. Norway\r\nremains committed to supporting the United Nations in\r\nmeeting those challenges.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ernst Walch, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Principality of Liechtenstein.\r\nMr. Walch (Liechtenstein): The United Nations\r\nfaces unprecedented challenges: the recent past has\r\nbrought about a worrisome erosion in the standing and\r\ncredibility that this great Organization has enjoyed\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nworldwide. Use of military force without prior\r\nauthorization by the Security Council and increasingly\r\ndifficult and dangerous conditions under which United\r\nNations personnel operate in many places are but two\r\nexamples illustrating this trend.\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has given a two-\r\ntiered response. First, he issued a call for an\r\nunequivocal commitment to the principle of\r\nmultilateralism, upon which this Organization is built.\r\nAnd secondly, he commissioned a report from eminent\r\nand highly experienced personalities on how the\r\nOrganization should address new threats and\r\nchallenges.\r\nLiechtenstein believes that this was the right\r\nresponse. An unequivocal and unwavering commitment\r\nfrom all of us is the basis for collective action and for\r\nobserving the rules we have set for ourselves. Only this\r\ncommitment can give meaning to our decisions to\r\ntackle new challenges, and only this can enable us to\r\nfurther develop a rules-based framework in order to\r\nlook confidently into the future.\r\nWe must acknowledge the fact that the challenges\r\nwe are facing today were not foreseeable when the\r\nfounding fathers agreed on the terms which guide the\r\nwork of this Organization. At the same time, we must\r\nalways recognize the Charter of the United Nations as\r\nthe unique achievement that it is and examine our\r\ncurrent ways of applying this great tool that was passed\r\ndown to us. It is therefore our obligation to conduct an\r\nin-depth and sober analysis of these new challenges in\r\norder to make an informed decision about how best to\r\naddress them within the framework of the United\r\nNations system. Changes and creative approaches will\r\nbe needed.\r\nWe therefore very much look forward to\r\nreceiving and considering the report of the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change established\r\nby the Secretary-General. But however insightful their\r\nfindings and however visionary their recommendations\r\nmay be — and we have high hopes that they will be —\r\nthe necessary decisions to expand the existing\r\nmultilateral architecture will have to be made by us,\r\nthe States gathered in this Assembly on the threshold\r\nof the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations. Not\r\nin 10 years. Now. The time is right.\r\nIn a globalized world, collective action is the\r\nnecessary response to a great number of challenges.\r\nEffective measures in numerous areas — the\r\nenvironment, HIV/AIDS, poverty-reduction, the fight\r\nagainst terrorism, to name but a few — can only be\r\ntaken on the basis of genuine and efficient global\r\ncooperation. Such cooperation can only be successful\r\nif it is based on a set of transparent and clear rules\r\napplied in the same manner to everybody who\r\nparticipates in it. International law is clearly the\r\nprimary instrument in this respect. However, we have\r\nwitnessed contradictory tendencies in the area of\r\ninternational law, especially in the recent past.\r\nOn the positive side, there have been landmark\r\nachievements, most notably the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. For the first time in the\r\nhistory of mankind, there is an independent Court,\r\nbased on a Statute negotiated by the international\r\ncommunity at a diplomatic conference, that has the\r\ncompetence to try individuals responsible for the worst\r\ncrimes when States themselves fail to do so. We are\r\nsadly reminded every day how much such an\r\ninstitution is needed. On the negative side, we have\r\nobserved a dangerous erosion in the application of\r\nlong-standing international law standards, most notably\r\nin the field of international human rights and\r\ninternational humanitarian law. The stage we have\r\nreached is critical and there can be only one response:\r\nWe must urgently reverse this trend and uphold the\r\nprimacy of the rule of law, both nationally and\r\ninternationally.\r\nWe firmly believe that the rule of law is an\r\nindispensable element of sound domestic policies —\r\noften referred to as good governance — and an\r\nindispensable part of sustainable development\r\nworldwide. International organizations, including the\r\nUnited Nations, are called upon to continue their\r\nefforts to assist States in establishing and applying the\r\nrule of law. We strongly support the efforts made over\r\nthe past year to strengthen the role of the United\r\nNations in that respect.\r\nThe rule of law at the domestic level must be\r\ncomplemented at the international level through full\r\nand unconditional respect for internationally\r\nrecognized standards and transparent and fair rules in\r\ninternational decision-making. We have been very slow\r\nin dealing with the changes in the world and its\r\nconsequences, most notably with regard to non-State\r\nactors who fall outside the framework of international\r\nlaw as we have known it in the past. We must ensure\r\nthat all those individuals and groups that play a\r\nsignificant role in the international arena are not\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nallowed to move in a legal vacuum and we must clarify\r\nwhich rules apply to them. That, however, we can do\r\ncredibly and thus effectively only if we, the\r\nGovernments representing States, continue to respect\r\nthe standards we have created for ourselves.\r\nThe one body that is particularly called upon in\r\nthat respect is the Security Council — to many, the\r\nepitome of the United Nations as a whole. The Council\r\nmust meticulously observe the mandate given to it\r\nunder the Charter and ensure transparency and clarity\r\nin its decision-making. That is of special importance\r\nwhere the Council’s decisions directly affect the rights\r\nand obligations of individuals who are not entitled to\r\nindividual legal remedies — a situation which can be\r\ndifficult to reconcile with the rule of law.\r\nA strong momentum is gathering for reform of\r\nthe Security Council after more than 10 years of\r\ndeliberations on that very complex topic. In light of the\r\nchallenges before the Council and the open questions\r\nconcerning its role, in particular with regard to\r\nincreasing legislative activities, successful reform must\r\naddress all aspects. Enlargement to make that body\r\nmore modern and representative is one such aspect. We\r\nbelieve that it is not sound for a universal Organization\r\nto have its major decisions in a truly vital area taken by\r\nonly a handful of States.\r\nFurthermore, the working methods of the\r\nCouncil, its accountability to the membership as a\r\nwhole and its mandate must also be addressed.\r\nLiechtenstein, and its delegation in New York in\r\nparticular, will continue to stand ready to make their\r\ncontribution to that end.\r\nIn accordance with the Charter, the Council acts\r\non behalf of the entire membership in carrying out its\r\nduties, and its decisions are binding on all Member\r\nStates. All States should therefore take a strong interest\r\nin its work and make use of their opportunities to\r\ninteract with and express their views to the Council,\r\nwhether they are members or not. More openness and\r\ninclusiveness in the Security Council are still both\r\ndesirable and feasible. The question remains, however:\r\nIs the Security Council too powerful or do we simply\r\nlack the necessary system of checks and balances? We\r\nsupport a dynamic and strong Security Council and\r\ntherefore tend to the latter view, with a clear focus on\r\nan enhanced role for the General Assembly, the only\r\nuniversal organ of the United Nations. The measures\r\non revitalization upon which we were able to agree\r\nduring the last session show us how far we still have to\r\ngo. It must be our goal to make this Assembly an\r\nefficient and effective body that can act and react\r\nquickly and with resolve.\r\nWe are still very far away from that goal. The\r\nmomentum gathered over the past year must be\r\ntranslated into further, bold measures and trigger a\r\nprocess that is not reversible. This is no time for\r\ncomplacency and no time for indifference. This\r\nAssembly has historical tasks before it. We must leave\r\nlethargy and short-term national interests behind in the\r\ninterest of the greater good. Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan put it very aptly in his speech this past Tuesday:\r\nIf we cannot reach agreement on the way forward,\r\nhistory will make the decisions for us. We must set a\r\nvision for the future and live up to our responsibility.\r\nWe owe this to all future generations and to ourselves.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Julian Robert Hunte,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, International Trade and\r\nCivil Aviation of Saint Lucia and former President of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Hunte (Saint Lucia): Saint Lucia supported\r\nyour unanimous election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session, Sir, as it shares the\r\nview of Member States that you will provide important\r\nleadership to this General Assembly. I extend sincere\r\ncongratulations to you and to the Government and\r\npeople of your country, Gabon, on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of Saint Lucia, and on my own behalf, and\r\npledge to work cooperatively with you in our common\r\nendeavour.\r\nThere is a personal note to my pledge of support\r\nand cooperation. Just one year ago, this Assembly\r\nhonoured my country and me by entrusting the\r\nleadership of the fifty-eighth session of this body to\r\nme. I am fully aware, therefore, of the tremendous\r\nresponsibility that falls to you as President, and OF the\r\ndemands and pressures of leadership of this, the United\r\nNations sole universal organ. In a relay of leadership\r\nthat began some 59 years ago, I have passed the baton\r\nto you, assured that this will be a productive and\r\nsuccessful fifty-ninth session.\r\nMy year as President of the General Assembly\r\ngave me a keener appreciation of the myriad tasks\r\nwhich the Secretary-General performs in the service of,\r\nand to inspire confidence in, the United Nations. The\r\nGovernment and people of Saint Lucia support him in\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nhis continuing contribution to our efforts to address the\r\ncritical issues facing our Organization and our world.\r\nThe picture of our twenty-first century world is\r\nfar different from that envisaged in the United Nations\r\nCharter. Instead of a world of peace, security and\r\neconomic and social progress, in which human rights,\r\nfundamental freedoms and international law are fully\r\nrespected, today our world is buffeted by poverty;\r\nhunger; the spread of endemic disease, including HIV/\r\nAIDS; conflicts; war; terrorism, and other grave\r\nproblems.\r\nThis is so despite the combined effort of the\r\nUnited Nations system and the enormous potential of\r\nthe Organization to live up to the ideals, principles and\r\npurposes of the Charter.\r\nThe United Nations is passing through a period of\r\nintense questioning and doubts as to its capacity and\r\nrelevance. It is the view of my Government that many\r\nof the doubts and questions stem from the continuing\r\nchallenge posed to the Organization to transform the\r\nideals of the Charter into action. Those questions and\r\ndoubts have been intensified by the concern that some\r\nof the Organization’s most influential and powerful\r\nMember States might turn away from\r\nmultilateralism — the very foundation of the United\r\nNations — and follow the path of unilateral action.\r\nWe can and we must, stop our unique and\r\nindispensable Organization from being battered by the\r\ntides of these turbulent times. We must better enable it\r\nto address the myriad problems with which peoples and\r\nnations are grappling. And we must reaffirm its status\r\nas the world’s foremost multilateral organization. But\r\nwe can only do so through our full commitment and\r\nresolve to ensure that the Organization and its Member\r\nStates live up to the ideals of the Charter.\r\nWe know that the Charter charges the United\r\nNations to achieve the solution of economic problems\r\ncooperatively. That puts the Organization on the front\r\nline of what, for many States, particularly those in the\r\ndeveloping world, appears to be a very long road to\r\nsustainable development. Nowadays, it is a road\r\nconstructed primarily around globalization and trade\r\nliberalization, which have mostly delivered on their\r\npromises of economic advancement to developed\r\ncountries, but have yet to deliver on those promises to\r\nmany others, mostly developing countries.\r\nIt cannot be disputed that current inconsistencies\r\nand inequities in the global trading system are\r\nwidening the gap between rich and poor, haves and\r\nhave-nots. It is not surprising, therefore, that\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly in the framework of\r\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO), are asserting\r\nthat globalization and trade liberalization should not\r\nundercut their sustainable development prospects, and\r\nthat there ought to be a fair and equitable global\r\ntrading system.\r\nAgricultural subsidies, market access, non-tariff\r\nbarriers to trade, low or falling commodity prices and\r\nspecial and differential treatment — all those issues\r\nbeg for constructive dialogue and decisive action,\r\nparticularly in the interest of the developing world.\r\nSpecific mandates for trade and development issues\r\nmay reside in other organizations, including the WTO,\r\nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\r\nBut the United Nations has a leading role to play in\r\nbringing coherence — here I underscore the word\r\ncoherence — to debate and policy-setting on those\r\nissues, in line with its Charter mandates. Its efforts in\r\nthat area have the full support of my Government.\r\nThe spate of deadly hurricanes that continue to\r\ntraverse the Caribbean region, have brought sharply\r\ninto focus the issues on which small island developing\r\nStates (SIDS), including Saint Lucia, have urged the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community to act.\r\nWe have reiterated, for example, that SIDS are\r\nvulnerable and that special and differential treatment,\r\nfair prices for commodities and development financing\r\nare essential to their sustainable development.\r\nIn just a few short weeks, hurricanes have\r\nbrought death and destruction throughout the\r\nCaribbean region, and, indeed, also to the Bahamas and\r\nthe United States. There was tragic loss of life in our\r\nsister Caribbean countries and territories — 37 in\r\nGrenada, 20 in Jamaica; and even now, Haiti is still\r\ncounting the cost in lives lost. Property and\r\ninfrastructural damage was immense, particularly in\r\nGrenada. Hurricane “Ivan the terrible” destroyed 90\r\nper cent of that country’s physical infrastructure. I say\r\nto this Assembly that when a small island developing\r\nState loses 90 per cent of its physical infrastructure in\r\nthe space of a few hours, the challenge to that country\r\nis formidable.\r\nFor Grenada, it is like starting over. Grenada\r\nmust rebuild its infrastructure, economy,\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\ncommunications systems, hospitals and schools,\r\neverything from the ground up to restore the quality of\r\nlife for its people. But how, and with what resources\r\nwill it rebuild? The member States of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) have made a commitment to\r\nGrenada, but can only assist to the extent that their\r\nmeans allow. Given their own resource constraints,\r\nhow far can that assistance be expected to go? The\r\nGovernment and people of Grenada and of CARICOM\r\nare highly appreciative of the condolences expressed in\r\nthis Hall, and for offers of assistance. But Grenada\r\nneeds much more. The Government of Saint Lucia\r\ncalls upon the international community to make a\r\ncommitment, as a matter of urgency, to the\r\nreconstruction of Grenada. We urge the convening, at\r\nan early date, of an international donor conference for\r\nthe purpose of mobilizing the resources required for\r\nthe reconstruction effort.\r\nIn keeping with the international commitment to\r\npromote the sustainable development of SIDS, Saint\r\nLucia calls upon the development partners and the\r\ninternational donor community to work together with\r\nSIDS to address their vulnerability and other critical\r\nissues frontally. The International Meeting for the 10-\r\nYear Review of the Barbados Programme of Action for\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States, to be convened in Mauritius in\r\nJanuary 2005, gives everyone yet another opportunity\r\nto do so. Saint Lucia urges all States, developed and\r\ndeveloping, and particularly partners and donors, to be\r\nrepresented at the International Meeting at the highest\r\nlevel. In particular, we urge that commitments to\r\nprovide resources for the implementation of the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action, are kept.\r\nIndeed, this fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly will be a pivotal one in respect of\r\ncommitments made internationally, including those\r\nmade in the critical area of HIV/AIDS. The session is\r\nalso crucial to positioning us for the 2005\r\ncomprehensive review of commitments made in\r\nfurthering the United Nations development agenda,\r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals. Even as\r\nwe prepare for the High-level Plenary that will\r\nexamine the successes and failures in implementing the\r\noutcomes of more than a decade of United Nations\r\nconferences and summits in the economic and social\r\nfields, the disjuncture between what we have agreed\r\nand what we have done in the interest of the peoples of\r\nthe world becomes self-evident.\r\nWe must ask ourselves why it is that we continue\r\nto fail the poor, the hungry, the sick and the\r\ndisenfranchised among us, despite the numerous\r\nspecialized, high-level meetings we have convened to\r\naddress their condition? And why is it that we appear\r\nincapable of meaningful action beyond the boundaries\r\nof those meetings? If we cannot bring relief to the vast\r\nnumbers of marginalized and disadvantaged among us,\r\nif we cannot advance growth and development,\r\nparticularly for developing countries, we can rest\r\nassured that we will lose, or continue to lose, the\r\nconfidence of the people of the world. There is\r\ntherefore one message we must take into the 2005\r\nhigh-level event: agreement on outcomes is\r\nmeaningless if it is not followed by practical and\r\neffective implementation. We must act to implement\r\nand we must act now.\r\nIt is asserted that peace and security are not\r\npossible without development and that development is\r\nnot possible without peace and security. Saint Lucia\r\nagrees with this point; both are central to the purposes\r\nand principles of the Charter. We must, however,\r\nremain vigilant that our development agenda is not\r\neclipsed by a single-minded focus on conflict and war,\r\nwhich continue to cast a giant and deadly shadow over\r\nour world.\r\nThe function given to the United Nations — and\r\nparticularly to the Security Council — for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security is an\r\nexceptional one. How effectively the Organization\r\ncarries out that function is an important determinant of\r\nits standing in the eyes of the people who need it most\r\nand of world public opinion. Therefore, we must be\r\nconsistent in our global strategy for world peace and\r\nsecurity. Importantly, the United Nations must not be\r\nseen as an Organization so mesmerized by crises that it\r\nis slow to act decisively to address critical issues of life\r\nand death. The action we take, after all, should present\r\nour best hope for a more peaceful and more secure\r\nworld.\r\nWe know that conflict and war have costs that are\r\nincalculable, particularly in human lives, and can have\r\nno happy ending. Today, Iraq remains an unsettled,\r\nfractured country. The United Nations has a\r\nresponsibility to the people of Iraq to work with them\r\nto restore peace, security and prosperity to their\r\ncountry. In this, the Organization must ultimately take\r\nits lead from the people of Iraq; it is only they who can\r\ndevise uniquely Iraqi solutions to Iraqi problems and\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\ndetermine the kind of future to which they are\r\ncommitted.\r\nRegarding another crisis, my Government is\r\ndisappointed that the road map to peace in the Middle\r\nEast appears to have been put aside, and hopes that\r\nnew initiatives will be undertaken urgently towards\r\nsettling that long-standing situation, which continues to\r\ncause so much grief.\r\nEvery day, news stories and commentaries in the\r\nmedia remind us of the level of violence and perils in\r\nour world. The complex and uncertain threat of\r\nterrorists and terrorism constitutes a critical factor\r\ncontributing to the rising tide of violence, death and\r\ndestruction. Recently, terrorism became a reality for\r\nhundreds of victims in the Russian Federation. My\r\nGovernment extends its sympathy to the Government\r\nof Russia and to all victims of terrorism and their\r\nfamilies worldwide. Even with our best efforts, it is not\r\nalways possible to know where or when terrorists will\r\nstrike again, nor can we say with any certainty that\r\ncurrent efforts against terrorism have made the world a\r\nless dangerous place.\r\nWe can say, however, that the root causes of\r\nterrorism are symptomatic of problems, some\r\nseemingly intractable, around the globe; that terrorism\r\nis global in its impact; and that its solution must be\r\nglobal. In addressing the problem of terrorism, we\r\nmust also look to dealing with the hunger, poverty and\r\ninequities spoken of by President Lula da Silva of\r\nBrazil and many other concerned leaders, which are\r\ngiving rise to the hopelessness and despair being\r\nexperienced by millions and millions of people all over\r\nthe world. Greater efforts must be made to resolve\r\nthose critical problems.\r\nAs we survey the enormity of the challenges the\r\nUnited Nations and the global community face today,\r\nwe must ask ourselves: Is our 59-year old Organization\r\nequipped to confront those challenges? There is a\r\ncurrent of reform within the Organization. A series of\r\nprogressive steps were taken during the fifty-eighth\r\nsession, in particular, to advance revitalization of this\r\nAssembly. However, the Assembly still has to\r\ndemonstrate its ability to reconcile the interests of its\r\nmember States and to take action to implement the hard\r\nchoices which revitalization of this important universal\r\nforum requires. We must ensure that the gains made are\r\nnot reversed.\r\nDuring the fifty-eighth session, the debate was\r\nalso opened on Security Council reform, and some\r\nprogress was made to lift this matter out of its\r\nmoribund state. The Security Council must indeed be\r\nreformed, so that its actions can carry more weight and\r\nacceptance internationally. The Council must be\r\nexpanded to make it more representative of the\r\ngenerality of the membership, and a way must be found\r\nto address the serious concerns surrounding the veto\r\nprivilege. Recent reform initiatives should impact\r\nprocesses under way and practical recommendations\r\naimed at ensuring that the Security Council is adequate\r\nto its mandates, including those that might be taken up\r\nat the 2005 high-level plenary meeting.\r\nSince the establishment of the United Nations,\r\nnon-governmental organizations and civil society have\r\nworked constructively with this Organization to\r\naddress pressing global problems. We now have a\r\nreport on how the relationship might be made more\r\nbeneficial. It is our hope that the Assembly will\r\ncarefully consider this matter, as the support of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and civil society is too\r\nimportant to be taken for granted.\r\nThe Government and people of Saint Lucia\r\nbelieve that confidence in the United Nations is being\r\nrestored. We believe that the world’s people expect the\r\nOrganization to take a leading role in resolving their\r\nmost pressing problems. We believe that the United\r\nNations can be many things to many people. The\r\nOrganization has been sorely challenged in recent\r\nyears, but has shown resolve in rising to the challenge.\r\nWith an abundance of political will, the principles and\r\npurposes of the United Nations Charter can triumph.\r\nThe Government and people of Saint Lucia are inspired\r\nby that prospect.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kassymzhomart Tokaev, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\r\nMr. Tokaev (Kazakhstan): First of all, Sir, let me\r\nadd my voice to the congratulations on your election to\r\nthe high office of President of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-ninth session and express confidence that,\r\nunder your leadership, it will be successful and fruitful.\r\nI would like to begin by supporting the statement\r\nof Secretary-General Kofi Annan concerning the\r\ncrucial importance of fostering the rule of law, both at\r\nhome and in the framework of international relations,\r\n29\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nfor the solution of the topical issues of the modern\r\nworld.\r\nToday, the whole system of international relations\r\nis under vicious attack. We are witnessing the growing\r\nreach and brutality of international terrorism and\r\norganized crime, the alarming degradation of our\r\nenvironment and the spread of poverty, misery and\r\ndisease.\r\nEvery year, we keep repeating that the challenges\r\nand threats to humanity have become global and that\r\nthe international community should make joint efforts\r\nto address these challenges effectively and with\r\ndetermination. But, with our words still resonating in\r\nthe air, these problems continue to place a heavy\r\nburden on human beings.\r\nFor years, the international community has been\r\nignoring the most burning problems of social and\r\neconomic development and has failed to address\r\npoverty, misery, illiteracy and various forms of\r\ndiscrimination. As a result, we are faced with an\r\nunprecedented threat of international terrorism, which\r\nundermines the pillars of the world economy and\r\nsecurity. Nevertheless, we have not yet done anything\r\nmeaningful to get a detailed analysis of the ideology\r\nbehind international terrorism, its institutional base and\r\nits sources of financing. In other words, the central\r\nnature of international terrorism remains terra\r\nincognita for all of us; we are familiar only with its\r\nugly manifestations.\r\nRecent alarming developments in the world,\r\nespecially the massacre in Beslan, have again\r\nhighlighted the urgent need to reform the United\r\nNations. We cannot meet new challenges and address\r\ntoday’s acute problems if we continue to rely on old\r\napproaches. The central issue of international security\r\nis turning the United Nations into an effective tool\r\ndesigned to strengthen regional and global security\r\nsystems, the regime of non-proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction and management of globalization\r\nprocesses.\r\nAs a matter of principle, we consider it important\r\nto ensure balance in the functioning of the General\r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, as envisioned in the Charter of this\r\nOrganization. We insist on the need to strengthen the\r\nrole of the General Assembly in the settlement of the\r\nmost important issues facing humanity today. In our\r\nview, the international community’s efforts to combat\r\nterrorism and to settle armed conflicts can be more\r\neffective only on the basis of such an approach.\r\nKazakhstan has supported the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s decision to establish a high-level panel on\r\nUnited Nations reform. We believe that this panel, with\r\nits broad mandate and wide-ranging powers, should\r\narrive at an acceptable solution to this present crucial\r\nissue. Kazakhstan holds the view that, in its current\r\nform, the Security Council no longer reflects the\r\nrealities of our world. I share the opinion of the Prime\r\nMinister of Japan, Mr. Junichiro Koizumi, that the\r\n“enemy State” clauses in the United Nations Charter\r\nare obsolete. The Security Council should be\r\nrevitalized by the addition of new permanent and non-\r\npermanent members. Asia, Africa and Latin America\r\nshould have a wider representation in the Security\r\nCouncil and should be directly involved in the search\r\nfor solutions to the important problems facing the\r\ninternational community.\r\nKazakhstan calls for the establishment of a\r\ncouncil of regional organizations under the auspices of\r\nthe United Nations Secretary-General. Close attention\r\nshould be paid to the proposal to establish an economic\r\nand social security council. We believe that these\r\nproposals reflect the need to strengthen global\r\nmultilateral cooperation.\r\nOur country continues to believe that the United\r\nNations is the only genuinely universal international\r\norganization responsible for the issues of war and\r\npeace, acting as a guarantor of international law.\r\nIt is encouraging that the reform of the United\r\nNations Security Council Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee is gaining momentum. With the current\r\nescalation of international terrorism, the role of this\r\nCommittee should become more important; otherwise,\r\nglobal counter-terrorism efforts to address new\r\nchallenges and threats will not be so effective, and this\r\nruns counter to the wishes of the peoples of the world.\r\nMr. Belkhadem (Algeria),Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nOur country supports the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping effort and the continued strengthening of\r\nits capacity in this area. With escalating humanitarian\r\ncrises and armed conflicts, as effectively demonstrated\r\nby the developments in Darfur, the United Nations\r\nshould pay special attention to the possibility of\r\nbroader participation by authoritative regional and\r\n30\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nsubregional organizations in peacekeeping operations,\r\nwhich would allow a more effective and timely\r\nresponse to emerging threats.\r\nYet, one key issue is the prevention of conflicts\r\nand crises. For this reason, Kazakhstan is a firm\r\nsupporter of preventive diplomacy and continues to\r\nbelieve that the establishment of a Central Asian\r\npreventive diplomacy centre is a timely initiative.\r\nIn our view, there is an urgent need to coordinate\r\nthe efforts of the entire international community in the\r\narea of disarmament and arms control. We call for an\r\nearly entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty and urge the Governments of those\r\nStates that have not yet ratified this instrument to\r\ndisplay political will and genuine commitment to\r\nnuclear disarmament.\r\nAs one of the few States that have voluntarily\r\ngiven up their nuclear weapons, Kazakhstan is\r\nconcerned by the current status of the Nuclear Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty. This important treaty has been\r\nseriously eroded because of destructive actions on the\r\npart of a number of known States. We should recognize\r\nthat the non-proliferation regime faces a formidable\r\nthreat, and there is a real possibility of an uncontrolled\r\nspread of weapons of mass destruction and, most\r\nimportant, of terrorists getting hold of them. In view of\r\nthis, we consider the establishment of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone in Central Asia to be a very\r\nimportant and timely proposal.\r\nWe believe that the negotiation process within the\r\nConference on Disarmament in Geneva should be\r\nreactivated. In our view, the potential of this important\r\nforum is far from being tapped to its full extent.\r\nThe Government of Kazakhstan attaches great\r\nimportance to the consistent implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action to Prevent, Combat and\r\nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light\r\nWeapons, as discussed at a regional conference in\r\nAlmaty in March of 2004.\r\nFor us, it is very important that the Iraqi issue is\r\nagain in the political realm of the United Nations.\r\nEmphasizing the need to ensure the independence,\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq, Kazakhstan\r\nwelcomes the transfer of authority and responsibility\r\nfor the administration of the country to the Interim\r\nGovernment of Iraq and calls on the Iraqi people to\r\ncome together in the name of national unity and\r\nconciliation.\r\nThe participation of a unit of the armed forces of\r\nKazakhstan in the multinational force in Iraq is a\r\ndemonstration of our country’s commitment to the\r\nimplementation of its obligations towards the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nContinued instability in the Middle East is a\r\nmatter of grave concern to Kazakhstan. From our point\r\nof view, the resumption and advancement of the peace\r\nprocess, on all tracks, and the implementation by all\r\nparties to the conflict in the Middle East of their\r\ncommitments, as reflected in the road map and relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, should remain the main\r\ngoal of all those concerned.\r\nKazakhstan supports the efforts of the current\r\nGovernment in Afghanistan to consolidate peace and\r\nsecurity in the country and address social, economic\r\nand humanitarian issues. We expect that the\r\ninternational community, starting with all the\r\ndeveloped countries, will live up to their commitments\r\nwith regard to the rehabilitation of Afghanistan. As for\r\nour country, we are ready to contribute to the process,\r\nwithin our means.\r\nWe believe that the well-being of the Central\r\nAsian region is largely dependent on the normalization\r\nof the situation in Afghanistan. We have every reason\r\nto be concerned by such problems as the increasing\r\nspread of drugs, illegal migration and surging religious\r\nextremism. Together with poverty, ecological\r\ndegradation and the lack of water resources, these\r\nphenomena provide a breeding ground for international\r\nterrorism, which is gaining force in our region.\r\nIn view of that, Kazakhstan supports the activities\r\nof the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime in\r\nCentral Asia, particularly the adoption of a regional\r\nplan of action to control the illicit spread of drugs in\r\nthe States neighbouring Afghanistan and the\r\nestablishment of a security belt around that country.\r\nWe believe that the deployment in Afghanistan —\r\nunder the auspices of NATO — of the International\r\nSecurity Assistance Force is an important factor in the\r\nrestoration of peace and security in the country.\r\nKazakhstan’s initiative regarding the Conference\r\non Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in\r\nAsia (CICA) — already a fact of international life — is\r\nan effective tool designed to strengthen confidence and\r\n31\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nsecurity in Asia. The first CICA summit, held in June\r\nof 2002, became a milestone in that process and paved\r\nthe way for practical efforts to institutionalize the\r\nConference.\r\nThe draft catalogue of confidence-building\r\nmeasures and the draft rules of procedure have already\r\nbeen agreed and are expected to be adopted at a\r\nministerial meeting of the CICA countries, scheduled\r\nto be held in October 2004 in Almaty. The adoption of\r\nthe catalogue will create a unique document\r\nencompassing a range of measures in the military,\r\npolitical, economic, cultural and environmental areas\r\ndesigned to strengthen security and confidence in Asia.\r\nAs a newly independent State, Kazakhstan wants\r\nto contribute to global harmony and stability. The fact\r\nthat our multi-ethnic State enjoys a large degree of\r\ninter-confessional and inter-ethnic accord says a lot;\r\nfirst of all, it is a confirmation that Kazakhstan has\r\nbecome an integral part of the civilized community. We\r\ncategorically reject the concept of the clash of\r\ncivilizations and consider it to be counterproductive\r\nand harmful, because it serves as a justification for\r\ninternational conflicts and the barbaric actions of\r\ninternational terrorists.\r\nKazakhstan firmly believes that dialogue and\r\nharmony among civilizations are not only possible but\r\nalso necessary. For that reason, our head of State\r\ninitiated a congress of world religions, held in Astana\r\nin September of 2003. The success of that forum has\r\nstrengthened our conviction that it is absolutely\r\nessential to establish a dialogue and ensure peaceful\r\ncoexistence between religions and civilizations, in the\r\ninterests of peace and global security.\r\nKazakhstan reaffirms its strong commitment to\r\nintegration and multilateral cooperation at the regional\r\nlevel. This approach, which promotes the sustainable\r\nsocial and economic development of Kazakhstan, is\r\nfully within our long-term interests. Such institutions\r\nas the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the\r\nEurasian Economic Community, the Organization of\r\nCentral Asian Cooperation and the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization play an ever-increasing role\r\nin the efforts to strengthen security, develop economic\r\ncooperation and create conditions for the prosperity of\r\nour large region.\r\nWe have great expectations regarding integration\r\nwithin the framework of the single economic space\r\nmade up of the territories of Belarus, Kazakhstan,\r\nRussia and Ukraine. Our country also supports the\r\nstrengthening of the capacity of the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States (CIS) as a major and influential\r\ninternational organization. Recently, President\r\nNursultan Nazarbaev has made concrete proposals\r\nconcerning the reform of the Commonwealth.\r\nKazakhstan reaffirms its commitment to the\r\nimplementation of its obligations towards the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\nand hopes that the upcoming ministerial meeting in\r\nSofia will develop new approaches to the reform of\r\nthat organization in order to adapt it to new challenges\r\nemerging from our region. We also commend the\r\nresults of the cooperation with NATO within the\r\nframework of its Partnership for Peace programme and\r\nconsider the possibility of increasing the level of our\r\ncooperation with that alliance.\r\nKazakhstan continues to pay priority attention to\r\nthe development of its cooperation with Russia, the\r\nUnited States, China, the countries of Central Asia, the\r\nEuropean Union and the Asian and Islamic countries.\r\nWe are now in a position to claim considerable\r\nprogress in that area, which has allowed us to create\r\nfavourable external conditions for liberal reforms in\r\nthe country. Having been given the status of a market\r\neconomy and enjoying a high rating in the financial\r\ncommunity, Kazakhstan has been recognized by the\r\ninternational community as a leader among the post-\r\nSoviet States in practically all economic indicators,\r\nincluding direct foreign investments.\r\nWe welcome the start of a direct dialogue\r\nbetween the Central Asian States and Japan and\r\nconsider that form of cooperation to be very\r\nmeaningful and promising. We also attach great\r\nimportance to the partnership between our region and\r\nthe United States in order to create a zone of free trade.\r\nThe Almaty Programme of Action, adopted by\r\nthe International Ministerial Conference of Landlocked\r\nand Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countries\r\nand International Financial and Development\r\nInstitutions on Transit Transport Cooperation, held in\r\nAugust of 2003 in my country, has provided to the\r\nlandlocked Central Asian States an important tool for\r\nthe solution of their trade and transit problems. We\r\nhope that the needs of inland States will be duly taken\r\ninto account in trade negotiations in order to provide\r\nappropriate privileges and preferences to that group of\r\ncountries.\r\n32\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nIt is a well-established fact that the transportation\r\npolicies of many countries, including Kazakhstan, are\r\nclosely linked to the delivery of hydrocarbons to world\r\nmarkets. As a country with the potential to become a\r\nmajor world exporter of oil and gas, Kazakhstan\r\nattaches great importance to the determination of the\r\nlegal status of the Caspian Sea and to the signing of a\r\nconvention on that issue. An agreement by the littoral\r\nStates on the use of the Caspian Sea exclusively for\r\npeaceful purposes has become an important\r\naccomplishment in the negotiation process. Kazakhstan\r\nholds the view that it is necessary to continue intensive\r\nefforts in a five-party format, gradually overcoming\r\nexisting differences in the search for solutions that\r\nwould agree with the fundamental principles of\r\ninternational law and promote the final determination\r\nof the legal status of the Caspian Sea.\r\nKazakhstan is gravely concerned by the fate of\r\nanother sea — the Aral Sea. The continued degradation\r\nof the environment of the region seriously affects the\r\nhealth and livelihood of the population. The situation\r\nin the Aral Sea region has acquired global dimensions;\r\nthe salt from its seabed has long been present in the air\r\nin Europe and Asia, and even over the North Pole. Yet\r\nthe international community, unfortunately, is not fully\r\naware of the grave ramifications of this environmental\r\ndisaster. Technical assistance and financial aid to the\r\npopulation of that long-suffering region have been\r\nsporadic. We believe that a special General Assembly\r\nresolution on the Aral Sea has long been overdue.\r\nWe also urge the international community to\r\nreactivate fruitful cooperation in the solution of social\r\nand economic problems facing the population around\r\nthe former Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground. The\r\npeople of the region were the unwitting victims of\r\nsome 500 nuclear-weapons tests conducted in the heat\r\nof the global arms race. We are grateful to the\r\nGovernments of Japan, the United States and other\r\ndonor States for the due attention being paid by them\r\nto this screaming problem, yet we believe that, in this\r\nparticular case, multilateral cooperation would have\r\nbeen more effective. The framework for such\r\ncooperation is already in place in the form of a relevant\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution, whose potential has not\r\nbeen used to the full.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that\r\nKazakhstan will continue to exert every effort to\r\nstrengthen global and regional stability, fight terrorism\r\nand meet other challenges that we face today.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Felipe Pérez Roque,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Cuba.\r\nMr. Pérez Roque (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nEvery year at the United Nations, we go through the\r\nsame ritual. We attend the general debate knowing\r\nbeforehand that the clamour for justice and peace by\r\nour underdeveloped countries will be ignored once\r\nagain. However, we persist. We know that we are right.\r\nWe know that one day we will accomplish social\r\njustice and development. We also know that such assets\r\nwill not be given away to us. We know that the peoples\r\nwill have to seize them from those who deny us justice\r\ntoday, because they underpin their wealth and\r\narrogance with disdain for our grief. It will not be\r\nalways like that, however. We say so today with more\r\nconviction than ever before.\r\nHaving said this, and knowing as we do that some\r\npowerful ones — just a few — present here will be\r\nchagrined, and also knowing that they are shared by\r\nmany, Cuba will now tell some truths.\r\nFirst, after the aggression on Iraq, there is no\r\nUnited Nations, understood as a useful and diverse\r\nforum based on respect for the rights of all and with\r\nguarantees for the small States. It is experiencing the\r\nworst moment of its nearly 60 years. It languishes, it\r\ngasps for air, it keeps up appearances, but it does not\r\nwork. Who handcuffed the United Nations, named by\r\nPresident Roosevelt? President Bush.\r\nSecond, United States troops will have to be\r\nwithdrawn from Iraq. Now that the lives of over 1,000\r\nAmerican youths have been uselessly sacrificed to\r\nserve the spurious interests of a clique of cronies and\r\nbuddies, and following the deaths of more than 12,000\r\nIraqis, it is clear that the only way out for the occupier\r\nfaced with a people in revolt is to recognize the\r\nimpossibility of subduing them and to withdraw. In\r\nspite of the imperial monopoly over information,\r\npeoples always get to the truth. Someday, those\r\nresponsible and their accomplices will have to deal\r\nwith the consequences of their actions in the face of\r\nhistory and their own peoples.\r\nThird, for the time being, there will be no valid,\r\nreal and useful reform of the United Nations. It would\r\ntake the super-Power, which inherited the immense\r\nprerogative of governing an order conceived for a\r\nbipolar world, to relinquish its privileges. And it will\r\nnot do so.\r\n33\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nAs of now, we know that the anachronistic\r\nprivilege of the veto will remain; that the Security\r\nCouncil will not be democratized as it should be or\r\nexpanded to include third world countries; that the\r\nGeneral Assembly will continue to stand ignored; and\r\nthat, at the United Nations, there will be more actions\r\ndriven by the interests imposed by the super-Power and\r\nits allies. We, as non-aligned countries, will have to\r\nentrench ourselves in defending the United Nations\r\nCharter, because if we do not it will be redrafted with\r\nthe deletion of every trace of such principles as the\r\nsovereign equality of States, non-intervention and the\r\nnon-use or the threat of use of force.\r\nFourth, the powerful collude to divide us. The\r\n130-plus underdeveloped countries must build a\r\ncommon front for the defence of the sacred interests of\r\nour peoples and of our right to development and peace.\r\nLet us revitalize the Non-Aligned Movement. Let us\r\nstrengthen the Group of 77.\r\nFifth, the modest objectives of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration will not be accomplished. We will reach\r\nthe fifth anniversary of the Summit in a situation that\r\nhas worsened. We sought to halve by 2015 the 1.276\r\nbillion human beings in abject poverty that existed in\r\n1990. There would have to be a yearly reduction of\r\nmore than 46 million poor people. However, excluding\r\nChina, between 1990 and 2000, extreme poverty rose\r\nby 28 million people. Poverty does not decline, it\r\ngrows.\r\nWe wanted to reduce by half by 2015 the 842\r\nmillion hungry people in the world. There would have\r\nhad to be a yearly reduction of 28 million. However,\r\nthere has been a reduction of barely 2.1 million hungry\r\npeople per year. At this rate, the goal will be attained\r\nby 2215, two hundred years after what was envisaged,\r\nand only if our species survives the destruction of its\r\nenvironment.\r\nWe proclaimed the aspiration to achieve universal\r\nprimary education by 2015. However, more than 120\r\nmillion children — or 1 in every 5 children of school\r\nage — do not attend primary school. According to the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), at the\r\ncurrent rate, the goal will be achieved after 2100.\r\nWe also proposed to reduce by two thirds the\r\nmortality rate in children under the age of five. The\r\nreduction has been symbolic: whereas 86 children died\r\nper 1,000 live births in 1998, the figure is now 82.\r\nEvery year, 11 million children continue to die of\r\ndiseases that can be prevented or cured, and their\r\nparents rightfully wonder what our meetings are for.\r\nWe said that we would pay attention to Africa’s\r\nspecial needs. However, very little has been done.\r\nAfrican nations do not need foreign advice or models,\r\nbut rather financial resources and access to markets\r\nand technologies. Assisting Africa would not be an act\r\nof charity, but an act of justice, a settling of the historic\r\ndebt resulting from centuries of exploitation and\r\npillage.\r\nWe committed ourselves to halting and starting to\r\nreverse the AIDS epidemic by 2015. However, in 2003,\r\nit claimed nearly 3 million lives. At this rate, some 36\r\nmillion people will have died of this disease by 2015.\r\nSixth, creditor countries and the international\r\nfinancial agencies will not seek a just and lasting\r\nsolution to foreign debt. They prefer to keep us in\r\ndebt — in other words, vulnerable. Therefore, even\r\nthough we have paid off $4.1 trillion in debt servicing\r\nover the last 13 years, our debt has increased from $1.4\r\ntrillion to $2.6 trillion. This means that we have paid\r\nthree times what we owed and now our debt is twice as\r\nlarge.\r\nSeventh, we, the underdeveloped countries, are\r\nthe ones that finance the wastefulness and the opulence\r\nof developed countries. While in 2003 they gave us\r\n$68.4 billion in official development assistance (ODA),\r\nwe delivered $436 billion to them as payment for the\r\nforeign debt. Who is helping whom?\r\nEighth, the fight against terrorism can only be\r\nwon through cooperation among all nations, with\r\nrespect for international law, and not through massive\r\nbombings or pre-emptive wars against dark corners of\r\nthe world. We must put an end to hypocrisy and double\r\nstandards. Sheltering three Cuban-born terrorists in the\r\nUnited States is an act complicit with terrorism.\r\nPunishing five young Cuban antiterrorists, together\r\nwith their families, is a crime.\r\nNinth, general and complete disarmament,\r\nincluding nuclear disarmament, is impossible today. It\r\nis the responsibility of a group of developed countries\r\nthat are the ones that sell and buy the most weapons.\r\nHowever, we must continue to strive for this goal. We\r\nmust demand that the over $900 billion set aside every\r\nyear for military expenditures be used for\r\ndevelopment.\r\n34\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nTenth, the financial resources to guarantee the\r\nsustainable development of all peoples on the planet\r\nare available, but what is lacking is the political will of\r\nthose who rule the world. A development tax of merely\r\n0.1 per cent on international financial transactions\r\nwould generate resources amounting to almost $400\r\nbillion a year. The cancellation of the foreign debt\r\nincurred by underdeveloped countries would allow\r\nthem to have no less than $436 billion a year available\r\nfor their development, money which is currently used\r\nto pay off the constantly-rising debt. If developed\r\ncountries complied with their commitment to set aside\r\n0.7 per cent of their gross national product as ODA,\r\nand not 0.2 per cent as they currently do, their\r\ncontribution would increase from the current $68.4\r\nbillion to $160 billion a year.\r\nLastly, I want to clearly express Cuba’s profound\r\nconviction that the 6.4 billion human beings on this\r\nplanet — who have equal rights according to the\r\nUnited Nations Charter — urgently require a new order\r\nin which the world is not in suspense, as is the case\r\nnow, awaiting the outcome of the elections in a new\r\nRome, in which only half the voters will participate\r\nand nearly $1.5 billion will be spent.\r\nThere is no discouragement in our words; I must\r\nmake that clear. We are optimistic, because we are\r\nrevolutionaries. We have faith in the struggle of the\r\npeoples, and we are sure that we will achieve a new\r\nworld order based on respect for the rights of all — an\r\norder based on solidarity, justice and peace, resulting\r\nfrom the best of universal culture, not from mediocrity\r\nor brute force.\r\nWith regard to Cuba — and neither blockades,\r\nthreats, hurricanes, droughts, nor human or natural\r\nforce can divert it from its course — I shall say\r\nnothing. On 28 October, for the thirteenth time, the\r\nGeneral Assembly will discuss and vote on a draft\r\nresolution on the blockade against the Cuban people.\r\nOnce again, morality and principles will defeat\r\narrogance and force.\r\nI conclude by recalling the words spoken here 25\r\nyears ago by President Fidel Castro:\r\n“The clashing of weapons, the threatening\r\nlanguage and the overbearing behaviour in the\r\ninternational arena must cease. Enough of the\r\nillusion that the problems of the world can be\r\nsolved by nuclear weapons. Bombs may kill the\r\nhungry, the sick and the ignorant; but bombs\r\ncannot kill hunger, disease and ignorance. Nor\r\ncan bombs kill the righteous rebellion of the\r\npeoples.” (A/34/PV.31, para. 146)\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Luis Ernesto Derbez,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the United Mexican\r\nStates.\r\nMr. Derbez (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nsession of the General Assembly over which you will\r\npreside, Sir, will be one of the most important in the\r\nhistory of the United Nations. It will be a session\r\ncharacterized by the necessary renewal of the United\r\nNations. The year 2005 will be decisive for the future\r\nof multilateralism and of our global Organization.\r\nThe debate on Iraq and the spreading wave of\r\ninternational terrorism have raised a series of questions\r\nabout the future of our collective security system. At\r\nthis session, the General Assembly has before it the\r\ntask of beginning an unprecedented reflection on the\r\nchanges our societies require of multilateral diplomacy.\r\nOur efforts must result in new tools that will enable the\r\nUnited Nations to find effective solutions to carry out\r\nthe lofty mission of tackling anew the tasks of\r\ndevelopment, maintaining world peace and security,\r\npromoting human rights and democracy and protecting\r\nthe environment — all under the rule of international\r\nlaw.\r\nAs a result of recent debates, some have raised\r\ntheir voices to assert that the international community\r\nis fractured and even in conflict. It is curious that that\r\nis happening at a time in the life of the world when\r\nthreats and challenges are more clearly shared by all\r\nnations. The tasks that should unite us focus on the\r\nfight against abject poverty, international terrorism,\r\norganized crime syndicates, major epidemics, the\r\nproliferation of arsenals of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and the deterioration of the environment. In\r\norder to put an end to those ills, concerted action and\r\ncommitment are required from all States. The reason is\r\nobvious: the most complex threats we face do not have\r\nany specific national origin, but they affect us all and\r\nhave ultimately worsened the quality of life in the\r\nworld and damaged the peace and well-being of our\r\ncitizens.\r\nThe United Nations was designed to put an end to\r\nthe scourge of wars between nations and to promote the\r\neconomic and social development of peoples. We face\r\nphenomena of such magnitude and complexity that the\r\n35\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\ndelegates who attended the San Francisco\r\nConference — despite their outstanding talent and\r\nvision — could not have anticipated at the time. The\r\ndiplomats of our generation have the obligation of\r\nenvisioning a second phase, inaugurating a new chapter\r\nof collective action to eradicate these dangerous\r\nmodern-day evils.\r\nIn Mexico’s view, the goal to which we should\r\naspire is not to rebuild the Organization from scratch or\r\nto discard the United Nations Charter, with its rich\r\nheritage of agreements and concepts. It would not be\r\nresponsible to abandon such essential tools as\r\nlegitimate individual or collective self-defence, as set\r\nout in Article 51, and the establishment of a collective\r\nsecurity system. The only viable, rational and\r\nnecessary approach is to update the multilateral system\r\nof cooperation and understanding that we have built\r\ntogether.\r\nIt was on the basis of those considerations that\r\nPresident Vicente Fox of Mexico, when he addressed\r\nthe General Assembly last year, made a robust appeal\r\nfor comprehensive reform of the United Nations.\r\nFurthermore, in many meetings that he has held since\r\nthen with other heads of State or Government, he has\r\nexpressed considerable interest in moving forward —\r\nwith the urgency that the situation requires — towards\r\nstrengthening and revitalizing the United Nations.\r\nThat is why we have undertaken an effort of\r\nactive coordination aimed at reforming the United\r\nNations and strengthening multilateralism. Mexico,\r\ntogether with 14 other countries, has begun an effort of\r\njoint reflection to analyse the various components of\r\nreform and to devise a diplomatic strategy to guide the\r\nsteady progress of United Nations reform.\r\nWe envision reform with an evolutionary\r\napproach that would enable the United Nations to\r\ntackle the most delicate challenges and threats of each\r\nhistorical cycle, drawing on the resources and strengths\r\nof all Member States in order to overcome the most\r\ndisturbing international phenomena. That exercise\r\nshould begin to bear fruit in the next 18 months.\r\nTwo thousand and five will be an appropriate\r\nyear to promote this ambitious project: there will be a\r\nconvergence of events that will enable us to revitalize\r\nmultilateral dialogue and interaction. First, in\r\nDecember 2004, we will receive the report and the\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General’s High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, which\r\nwill be of valuable assistance in guiding our\r\ndeliberations on reform of the system. It will be very\r\nimportant that we examine those recommendations in\r\nminute detail and that the General Assembly be the\r\ncentral forum for discussing and adopting the new\r\nmandates and changes that must be implemented in the\r\nOrganization. Likewise, next year we will have to\r\nassess the progress made in implementing the\r\nMillennium Declaration and the steps taken to follow\r\nup the Monterrey Consensus on financing for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThat series of events in 2005 will give us an up-\r\nto-date view of the state of the multilateral system and\r\nof the issues that reform should address. With that\r\nbroad perspective, and so that we can live up to the\r\ncommitment and interest of all Member States, we will\r\nneed to ensure a balance between the security and\r\ndevelopment agendas and their respective institutions\r\nwithin the system. The General Assembly, the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council must\r\nwork as part of an organic whole, not as entities that\r\nare disconnected and sometimes even at odds in their\r\ntasks, priorities and working methods.\r\nThe predominance of the Security Council has\r\nresulted in growing disregard for the work of other\r\nprincipal organs and has diminished their effectiveness.\r\nThis causes certain issues to be marginalized; then,\r\nwhen they reach crisis level, they become matters for\r\nwhich the Security Council becomes responsible. We\r\nalso must acknowledge that the overall process of\r\nUnited Nations reform has been dominated — in fact,\r\nparalysed — by the debate on restructuring the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMexico believes that any Security Council reform\r\nprocess should be governed by a set of common\r\nobjectives and criteria. After more than a decade of\r\nwork, we should ask ourselves why Security Council\r\nreform has not succeeded. The debate has focused on\r\nthe number of seats, how they should be allocated to\r\neach region and whether or not they should be\r\npermanent seats. Mexico does not share that approach\r\nbecause, paradoxically, the fundamental question that\r\nhas largely been ignored — which came to the fore\r\nduring the critical discussion on Iraq — is not how\r\nmany members there should be on the Security Council\r\nand how many should be permanent; rather, it is what\r\nkind of collective security system does the\r\ninternational community need today, and what\r\n36\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nmechanisms should be used to face new challenges\r\nand, above all, to prevent conflicts.\r\nThe Security Council must create conditions that\r\nwill prevent the emergence of conflicts, particularly\r\nthrough building and consolidating national institutions\r\nand upholding the rule of law and respect for human\r\nrights. The Council should also enhance its capacity to\r\nconsistently identify situations likely to endanger peace\r\nand security. As a logical outcome of such an analysis,\r\nwe can then identify the changes needed in the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nMexico acknowledges the contributions of\r\nMember States to the cause of peace, all of them\r\nnecessary. Our Organization, based on the legal\r\nequality of States, requires the commitment and\r\nsupport of all its Members, through their involvement\r\nin decision-making. The creation of new permanent\r\nseats would lead to greater concentration of the\r\ninternational decision-making process than is now the\r\ncase. We cannot ignore the fact that permanent\r\nmembers of the Council already have more influence\r\nthan the rest of the membership. Mexico considers that\r\nthis should be restricted and not further increased.\r\nMexico supports collective decision-making as\r\nthe source of the legitimacy and effectiveness of our\r\nactions in favour of peace and security. In that regard,\r\nwe favour a regionally equitable and balanced\r\nenlargement of the number of elected members, based\r\non modalities determined within the regional groups.\r\nThat would stimulate wider participation in the\r\ndecision-making process and would ensure that more\r\ncountries, not fewer, can contribute their views in the\r\nCouncil.\r\nThus, Mexico would support an increase in the\r\nnumber of elected members and an extension of their\r\nterm of office, with the option of immediate re-election\r\nfor those States that have demonstrated, through their\r\nperformance, a strong commitment to the purposes of\r\nthe Organization. That would help us to create a\r\ngenuine mechanism for accountability, founded on\r\nArticle 24 of the Charter.\r\nAs part of this integral vision of reform, it is\r\ncrucial also to strengthen the role of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, which supports the Security Council\r\nand the General Assembly in the decision-making\r\nprocess. Conflict prevention depends upon timely\r\nattention to and action on problems that lead to a lack\r\nof access to development. It is undeniable that peace\r\nand security are anchored on the well-being of our\r\npeoples. Therefore, we believe that the Economic and\r\nSocial Council should work as a coordinating body to\r\nsteer the financing of development and to articulate the\r\nfollow-up of commitments stemming from United\r\nNations summits and conferences on social and\r\neconomic development.\r\nIt is essential to have a more committed\r\ninvolvement of the international financial institutions\r\nin the development process. In that regard, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council should play a pivotal\r\nrole linking the Bretton Woods institutions, the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO), the private sector and civil\r\nsociety.\r\nAnother issue that is worth our attention in the\r\nreform process is the Commission on Human Rights,\r\nwhich has essential responsibilities regarding universal\r\nrespect for individual rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nMexico considers that the work of the Commission is\r\nvital, although its procedural weakness in advancing its\r\nobjectives is clear. For this reason, its methods must be\r\nurgently reformulated. Mexico is fostering regional\r\ndialogue on this issue.\r\nThe ongoing effort in favour of United Nations\r\nreform requires a vision of collective well-being and\r\nenhanced political understanding, in order to prevent\r\n“threats without a passport” from plunging the world\r\ninto a spiral of confrontation, violence and despair.\r\nHere, we should recognize that the United Nations has\r\nalready taken some first steps in the right direction,\r\nparticularly in the fight against terrorism and the non-\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As part\r\nof the reform, it will be necessary to carry these actions\r\nfurther.\r\nIn this context, Mexico is ready to continue\r\nworking with the institutional structures of the\r\nOrganization, particularly the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee and the non-proliferation machinery. We\r\nwill continue to promote the protection of human rights\r\nand fundamental freedoms in the fight against\r\nterrorism as the only way to guarantee the legitimacy\r\nand efficacy of that fight. My country will also follow\r\nclosely the cooperation initiatives and regimes geared\r\nto control the export of nuclear materials; and we will\r\nstress the need to strengthen efforts in the urgent cause\r\nof disarmament.\r\nOther positive steps have been taken in recent\r\nyears to confront the grave challenges resulting from\r\n37\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nhumanitarian crises and genocide. In this context,\r\nMexico concurs with the concept of the responsibility\r\nto protect, in the sense that sovereignty entails a State’s\r\nobligation towards its population, and that, when it\r\nfails to fulfil it, the international community has the\r\nduty to collectively assist in the protection of\r\nindividuals from serious human rights violations. In the\r\nlight of recent regrettable humanitarian tragedies, it is\r\nof the utmost importance for the General Assembly to\r\ndiscuss this concept thoroughly, in order to elaborate\r\nguidelines for its practical application within the\r\nOrganization.\r\nBearing in mind the scope of the reform\r\nchallenge facing us, Mexico would favour the\r\nconvening of a general conference with the aim of\r\nupdating and strengthening our Organization. In\r\ncontrast to the consideration that has been given to\r\nother issues of international relevance, such as trade,\r\npopulation and the environment, we have not held any\r\nopen-ended rounds of negotiations in the last six\r\ndecades on issues pertaining to international politics\r\nand the progressive development of diplomacy. The\r\nchanges that have taken place in the world in that\r\nperiod demand a comprehensive exercise that should\r\nencompass the renewal of our commitments, review of\r\ncollective security structures and their performance,\r\nabove all, promotion of economic development.\r\nThroughout President Fox’s administration,\r\nMexico has clearly shown its commitment to the\r\nstrengthening of multilateralism. We have done so as\r\nan elected member of the Security Council, as a\r\npromoter of international conventions on topics such as\r\ncorruption, persons with disabilities and migrants, by\r\nfurthering initiatives to foster the equitable and\r\nsustainable development of global areas and by hosting\r\nhigh-level conferences such as the Monterrey\r\nConference on Financing for Development and the\r\nSummit of the Americas.\r\nFurthermore, as an unequivocal sign of our\r\ninterest, our concerns and our commitment, Mexico is\r\ndecisively promoting the revitalization of the\r\nmultilateral system through the Group of Friends for\r\nthe Reform of the United Nations.\r\nIt is in that constructive spirit that Mexico is\r\ntaking part in this session of the General Assembly. We\r\nare certain that under your able leadership,\r\nMr. President, this session will be remembered as the\r\ncatalyst for one of the most important and dominant\r\nchapters in the life of our Organization.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Abubakr Al-Qirbi, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Yemen.\r\nMr. Al-Qirbi (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): It gives\r\nme pleasure to begin my remarks by congratulating\r\nMr. Ping on the vote of confidence represented by his\r\nelection as President of the current session of the\r\nAssembly. Given his wisdom and organizational skills,\r\nI am confident that he will be able to lead our\r\ndeliberations successfully. Thus, his positive input will\r\nfurther enhance the stature and effectiveness of the\r\nUnited Nations at a time of profound and\r\nunprecedented transformation on the world scene.\r\nI wish also to commend the efforts and wisdom of\r\nhis predecessor for his remarkable stewardship.\r\nFurthermore, Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General,\r\ndeserves our gratitude for his persistent efforts to live\r\nup to the demands of his office in the face of complex\r\nand daunting challenges and surprises.\r\nUndoubtedly, the events of the past two years —\r\nspecifically from the period prior to and after the\r\noccupation of Iraq — have shown clearly that, in\r\ntoday’s world, unilateralism in determining\r\ninternational action inevitably leads to the proliferation\r\nof hotbeds of tension, in addition to jeopardizing\r\ninternational peace and security. At the same time,\r\nthose events have further demonstrated the relevance\r\nof multilateralism in global decision-making through\r\ninternational institutions, especially this world body.\r\nGiven that the United Nations represents a\r\nsuperior form of multilateralism, because it brings\r\ntogether Member States to address common concerns\r\nover the maintenance of collective security and to face\r\nuniversal challenges, it is only logical that we all\r\nshould join together to protect it against\r\nmarginalization and to safeguard and strengthen its\r\nrole. Thus, we should not allow the will of one Power,\r\nor of a certain group of Powers, to direct the actions of\r\nthe United Nations system or permit it to be used to\r\nadvance their agenda without regard for the wishes and\r\ninterests of the rest of the membership.\r\nA case in point, in our view, is the need to\r\nreconsider the decision-making process in the Security\r\nCouncil, its composition and membership. The realities\r\nof our contemporary world and the imperatives of\r\n38\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nglobal security, which is indivisible, must be fully\r\ntaken into consideration in any review exercise. No\r\nsingle State or group of States can alone guarantee\r\nglobal security or assume the responsibility of that\r\nundertaking without active participation by other\r\nStates. In addition, decisions that are not in line with\r\ninternational law, the Charter of the United Nations or\r\nthe view of the majority of the membership should be\r\nvehemently opposed.\r\nAs this session coincides with the third\r\nanniversary of the 11 September tragedy, once again\r\nthe Republic of Yemen reaffirms its commitment to\r\nfight extremism and terrorism within the framework\r\nestablished and led by the United Nations. Yemen, for\r\nits part, has made great progress in combating\r\nterrorism and terrorists. The most recent achievement\r\ninvolved defeating a group that had rebelled against the\r\nConstitution and the rule of law in the Sa’dah region in\r\nYemen. Those rebels had resorted to terrorism in order\r\nto achieve their goals. Their terrorist acts harmed\r\ninnocent civilians and disrupted security and stability\r\nin the area.\r\nThe Government of Yemen, while fully\r\nresponsible for the safety and security of its citizens\r\nand the homeland, remains faithful to its international\r\ncommitment to combat terrorism. Our conviction is\r\nthat terrorism has no specific identity or particular\r\nreligion. The struggle for national liberation or to end\r\nforeign occupation is a legitimate right under the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, international law and\r\nthe basic principles of justice and human rights. Such a\r\nstruggle can therefore not be treated as terrorism. In\r\naddition, Yemen’s experience in combating terrorism\r\nhas taught us that in order effectively to battle\r\nterrorism, all possible resources must be deployed,\r\nincluding its root causes, dialogue, the promotion of\r\ndevelopment and justice, in addition to good security\r\nand intelligence work.\r\nYemen is a strong believer in the United Nations.\r\nHowever, we believe that, despite all the efforts made\r\nby the dynamic Secretariat of this great institution, the\r\ngaps between rich and poor countries are widening.\r\nThat is partly due to current economic policies that\r\nstrengthen the dominance of wealthy nations over poor\r\ncountries. Today more than ever we need to examine in\r\nearnest the imbalances in international economic\r\nrelations.\r\nThe first step we expect in this regard is the\r\nfulfilment by wealthier nations of the pledges and\r\nundertakings announced in their initiatives for\r\nachieving economic balance between the rich and the\r\npoor. Failure to do so, as I presume all of us recognize,\r\nwould deepen the sense of bitterness felt by the poor\r\ncountries. It might also breed extremism and violence\r\nto which no country would be immune.\r\nIn that context, the Government of the Republic\r\nof Yemen believes that the recognition by the leaders\r\nof the Group of Eight industrial nations that the\r\nconsolidation of peace in the Middle East and the\r\npromotion of economic growth and political\r\ndevelopment through a process of overall development\r\nin all countries of the region — as outlined in the G-8\r\ndeclaration adopted at their most recent Summit in Sea\r\nIsland, Georgia, United States — represents a very\r\nsignificant statement and a positive strategic challenge\r\nof interest to us and to the international community in\r\ngeneral.\r\nIt is indeed a challenge, because this long-\r\noverdue vision seeks to correct a chronic anomaly. It is\r\nalso a challenge because of its positive implications\r\nand the shift in focus it can bring in favour of global\r\nstability and international peace and security once that\r\nabstract concept is translated into concrete and\r\nmeaningful steps on the ground. That will require\r\ngenuine partnerships and the abandoning of policies of\r\ncoercion.\r\nProceeding from these convictions, Yemen\r\nwelcomed that initiative and agreed to participate in\r\nthe G-8 Sea Island Summit for two reasons: first,\r\nbecause that vision is in line with our national plan for\r\nreform, and, secondly, because we welcome any\r\npartnership between Arab States, the European Union,\r\nthe United States of America and the world at large\r\nthat enhances our development and stability and\r\ncontributes to the fight against terrorism.\r\nThe commitment of my Government to build a\r\nbetter future for the people of Yemen and the people of\r\nour region has prompted us to institute numerous\r\neconomic and political reforms, broaden popular\r\ninvolvement in governance, and strengthen our\r\npartnership with other countries and entities.\r\nThis was highlighted in the Sana’a Declaration on\r\nDemocracy, Human Rights and the Role of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, adopted earlier this year\r\nat the Sana’a Intergovernmental Regional Conference.\r\n39\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nA number of other countries, represented by their\r\nGovernments, Parliaments and civil society, regional\r\nand international organizations, took part in that forum.\r\nThe Forum was organized in response to reform\r\ninitiatives that came from the Governments and\r\npeoples of the region. It stressed that good democratic\r\ngovernance and respect for human rights require full\r\nmobilization of the energies and potential of civil\r\nsociety. They also require interaction among all\r\nstakeholders, with a sense of responsibility and\r\npartnership with Governments, and support from\r\noutside the region, in order to use overall development\r\nas a vehicle towards stability, progress and movement\r\non the road towards democracy and overall human\r\ndevelopment.\r\nNo one can ignore the great achievements made\r\nby our Organization in promoting peace, security and\r\nwelfare over the course of its rich history. But one\r\nshould, by the same token, admit that it has failed to\r\nresolve numerous conflicts that have endangered, and\r\ncontinue to endanger, the security and stability of many\r\nnations and peoples. Foremost among these dangers is\r\nthe Arab-Israeli conflict. Certainly, the United Nations\r\nhas failed to put an end to ongoing Israeli aggression\r\nagainst the Palestinian people and to Israel’s repeated\r\nthreats against Arab countries. Also, there are many\r\ntrouble spots and areas of conflict across the globe that\r\nthe United Nations must address effectively if we want\r\ninternational peace and security to prevail.\r\nThe position of the Republic of Yemen regarding\r\nthe question of Palestine is abundantly clear. It is based\r\non the principles laid out by the Quartet in the road\r\nmap, and on those contained in the Arab Peace\r\nInitiative. This Initiative calls for the establishment of\r\na State of Palestine with full sovereignty over its\r\nterritory and with Jerusalem as its capital; Israel’s\r\nwithdrawal from all Arab territories occupied since\r\n4 June 1967; and the return of refugees to their homes.\r\nAll along, Yemen has maintained that peace in\r\nthe Middle East will elude us as long as Israel is\r\nallowed to manoeuvre and circumvent United Nations\r\nresolutions. We also believe that Israel will not accept\r\nthe aforesaid solutions unless a Security Council\r\nresolution is adopted with a view to imposing a\r\nsolution on Israel that includes an enforcement\r\nmechanism. Contrary to our hopes, the entire question\r\nhas become even more intractable and difficult to\r\ncomprehend, especially given the use of the veto power\r\nagainst any proposed resolution that would force Israel\r\nto implement United Nations resolutions. This has\r\nencouraged Israel to persist in constructing the\r\nracially-based separation wall, which aggravates the\r\nsuffering of the Palestinian people and is taking away\r\nsizeable tracts of their remaining land, in defiance of\r\nglobal consensus and of the advisory opinion of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ).\r\nWe wish to emphasize here that, as recent events\r\nhave demonstrated, the wall cannot guarantee security\r\nto Israel. Israel’s genuine security could be achieved if\r\nit were to accept the road map and commit itself to\r\nimplementing relevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nWe demand that the Security Council ensure the\r\nphysical safety of the Palestinian President, Yasser\r\nArafat, provide protection for the Palestinian people\r\nagainst Israeli state-sponsored terrorism, and show\r\nrespect for the wishes and the will of the Palestinian\r\npeople.\r\nIn addition, Israeli withdrawal from the occupied\r\nSyrian and Lebanese territories is an integral part of\r\nany Middle East peace initiative. I wish to recall in this\r\nregard that the Arab Peace Initiative represents an Arab\r\nconsensus for the resolution of the Arab-Israeli\r\nconflict.\r\nFurthermore, my Government considers\r\ninadmissible the threats that the Israeli military\r\nmachine fires against sister Syria and against Iran from\r\ntime to time. This represents irresponsible provocation\r\nthat exacerbates the already tense situation in the\r\nregion. The timing of these threats further fuels\r\nviolence and frustrates peace endeavours aimed at\r\nfinding a just and negotiated settlement of the\r\nArab-Israeli conflict. They also represent an attempt by\r\nthe Israeli Government to distract attention from its\r\nfailure to ensure security for its citizens. The time has\r\ncome for Israel to recognize that its stability and\r\nacceptance by countries of the region will remain\r\nunfulfilled unless it implements the road map and\r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions, and withdraws\r\nfrom the occupied Arab territories in Palestine, the\r\nGolan and the Shab’a farms.\r\nIn the same context, I wish to affirm my country’s\r\nsupport for United Nations efforts regarding the\r\nconvening of a disarmament conference which aims,\r\ninter alia, at the establishment of the Middle East\r\nregion as a zone free of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nTo this end, Israel must accede to the Nuclear\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty.\r\n40\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nThe current violence in Iraq, and the violation of\r\nhuman rights and bloodshed of our Iraqi brothers is an\r\ninevitable outcome of an invasion. Thus, it is\r\nincumbent upon the United Nations to fulfil its role, as\r\nset forth in relevant resolutions, regarding the need to\r\nprovide support to Iraq with a view to restoring peace\r\nand stability throughout the country. The interim Iraqi\r\nGovernment should be empowered to exercise full\r\nsovereignty in order to lead Iraq towards holding\r\ndemocratic elections and forming a constitutional\r\nGovernment that represents the will of the Iraqi people,\r\nrestores law and order and puts an end to the\r\noccupation of the country. The tragic situation\r\nunfolding today in Iraq, in the wake of the downfall of\r\nSaddam Hussein’s regime, has resulted in terrorism,\r\nviolations and chaos, which all of us can see. That\r\nsituation may take Iraq down a slippery slope of\r\nsectarian violence and conflict which, in turn, will\r\nthreaten the unity and future of Iraq.\r\nYemen believes that all of us should assist and\r\nsupport the interim Government in Iraq and the\r\nnational and legislative councils to overcome the\r\ncurrent critical transitional stage in accordance with\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1546 (2004), with a view\r\ntoward safeguarding the sovereignty, independence and\r\nterritorial integrity of Iraq. Also, we must ensure that\r\nthe forthcoming period leading to parliamentary\r\nelections and the formation of a national Government\r\nwill reflect the will of the Iraqi people without external\r\ninterference. All effort should be made to develop and\r\ndefine political solutions for the complex situation, and\r\nto provide to the interim Government all it may need in\r\norder to achieve a successful outcome. Priority should\r\nbe given to enabling the Iraqi Government to start the\r\nprocess of national reconciliation, ensuring the\r\nparticipation of all factions and political groups in\r\ndefining the future of Iraq and closing the annals of the\r\npast. We also call for an end to violence against\r\ncivilians, as well as excessive military reactions by the\r\noccupation forces, which victimize innocent civilians\r\nand lead to further destruction, pushing moderates\r\ntowards extremism.\r\nIn view of Yemen’s sense of fraternal\r\nresponsibility towards Iraq, we submitted to the last\r\nArab summit in Tunis, an initiative conceived on the\r\nbasis of a set of firm principles set forth in United\r\nNations resolutions. In essence, the initiative contained\r\nguiding principles for assisting the brotherly people of\r\nIraq to overcome their current crisis. It also called for\r\nsetting timelines to link efforts to restore security and\r\nstability with ending of the occupation. In the\r\nmeantime, Yemen supports any Arab or international\r\nendeavour that might help Iraq move safely to achieve\r\npeace, stability and national unity.\r\nMy country believes that national reconciliation\r\nbased on dialogue and national unity is a viable path\r\ntoward settling the long-running dispute and conflict in\r\nSomalia. Therefore, we congratulate the Somali leaders\r\non the progress they have so far achieved within the\r\nframework of the reconciliation process. At the same\r\ntime, we call upon all warring factions in Somalia to\r\nbuild on that success and to put the highest national\r\ninterests of Somalia ahead of their own agendas.\r\nYemen, which has played a leading role in promoting\r\nnational reconciliation in Somalia, calls upon the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community to\r\nassume fully and effectively their responsibilities in\r\norder to bring about peace and security in Somalia.\r\nThe Yemeni Government appreciates the current\r\nefforts being made to assist the national reconciliation\r\ntalks in Somalia to reach a successful outcome, that is\r\nthe formation of a consultative council, election of a\r\nPresident for the country, and formation of an interim\r\nGovernment that will lead Somalia towards drafting a\r\nnew constitution and setting up a democratic system of\r\ngovernment. Yemen, of course, will align itself with\r\nthe good offices of the Governments of Djibouti,\r\nEthiopia and Kenya, and supported by the European\r\nUnion and the United States, to promote reconciliation.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen has been closely\r\nfollowing the humanitarian situation in the Darfur\r\nprovince of sisterly Sudan. I wish to underline here the\r\ndecisions adopted by the Council of Arab Foreign\r\nMinisters, which met at the headquarters of the Arab\r\nLeague early last August. That meeting was also\r\nattended by the head of the African Union Commission\r\nand the Foreign Minister of Nigeria representing\r\nPresident Obasanjo of Nigeria — the current Chairman\r\nof the African Union. We wish also to reaffirm the\r\ndecisions adopted in this regard by the Council of Arab\r\nForeign Ministers in its regular session on 14 and\r\n15 September. Those decisions reflected the joint\r\nArab-African position regarding the situation in Darfur.\r\nThey affirmed the need to address the matter within the\r\nAfrican Arab framework. They also rejected all\r\nattempts to create a rift in Arab-African relations and\r\nstressed that there was no hard evidence of genocide.\r\nFurthermore, the meeting underlined the responsibility\r\n41\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nof the Government of the Sudan for maintaining\r\nsecurity and stability, providing protection for its\r\ncitizens and disarming all militias in the region. The\r\nsuccess of the Sudanese Government in achieving\r\nthose goals will depend on the degree of international\r\nsupport and humanitarian relief assistance provided to\r\nit. All external parties must also refrain from\r\ninterfering in the internal affairs of the Sudan.\r\nThe Government of the Sudan must assume its\r\nresponsibility for deploying its forces so as to ensure\r\nsecurity, provide protection for all of its citizens and\r\nconfront all of the armed groups responsible for the\r\ncrisis. In the meantime, all the logistical support\r\nneeded by the Government of Sudan should be\r\nprovided by the African Union and Arab States with a\r\nview to achieving those objectives.\r\nThe Sudan’s response to relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, including the steps it has begun to\r\ntake, clearly demonstrate its genuine commitment to its\r\nundertakings. Furthermore, we call on the United\r\nNations, especially the Security Council, to address the\r\nissue on the basis of an accurate assessment of the\r\nsituation in Darfur which obviously has begun to\r\nimprove. We must avoid favouring one side at the\r\nexpense of the other. We should also shift our focus to\r\naddress the humanitarian situation without regard to\r\npolitical considerations or motives. All of the parties to\r\nthe Darfur dispute, including the Government of the\r\nSudan, should be urged to participate constructively\r\nand unconditionally in peace talks, with a view to\r\nachieving a just solution to the crisis. Any attempt to\r\nuse blackmail or to exploit events to the advantage of\r\nthe rebel groups must be rejected. Any party that\r\nviolates its commitments, as verified by a neutral\r\nsecurity monitoring mechanism, should be held\r\naccountable.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Yemen\r\nstresses that threatening or imposing a unilateral\r\nboycott or economic sanctions, as practised against\r\nsome Member States, would constitute an explicit\r\nviolation of the principles of international law —\r\nregardless of the fact that such practices have failed on\r\nthe ground in more than one case. Indeed, sanctions\r\nand boycotts aggravate the suffering of innocent\r\ncivilians and lead to the escalation of hostilities.\r\nMy country supports the call by the United\r\nNations to end unilateral measures, and it affirms the\r\nneed to promote a culture of dialogue and\r\nunderstanding, even when dealing with controversial\r\nissues. That should, indeed, be the rational and\r\ncivilized approach that all of us should pursue in\r\nresolving our disputes and mending our relationships.\r\nFinally, my delegation wishes the General\r\nAssembly every success as it endeavours to fulfil its\r\nmandate during this session, with a view to reinforcing\r\nour common action to promote peace, security and\r\nwelfare for all. It is our hope that the ongoing reform\r\nof the United Nations will achieve the long-awaited\r\nobjectives, including equitable representation in the\r\nSecurity Council. That would enhance the Council’s\r\neffectiveness and credibility and enable it to adapt\r\nbetter to the constantly changing landscape of\r\ninternational relations.\r\nI take this opportunity to reaffirm that the\r\nRepublic of Yemen will support any efforts aimed at\r\nstrengthening the role of the United Nations and\r\nenhancing its credibility, safeguarding the sovereignty\r\nand will of its Member States and pooling our energies\r\nto create a better future for humankind.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I give\r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Karel de Gucht,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium.\r\nMr. De Gucht (Belgium) (spoke in French):\r\nBelgium’s international commitment is rooted in the\r\nconviction that initiatives taken at the global level can\r\nmove forward only through dialogue and cooperation.\r\nThe careful European building process taught us that.\r\nThat is why Belgium firmly believes in the virtues of\r\nmultilateralism. We are stronger standing together than\r\nalone. By standing together, we benefit from greater\r\nlegitimacy and therefore have better opportunities to\r\nmake our voices heard.\r\nThe challenges facing the United Nations have\r\nthe virtue of being clear. As the Secretary-General has\r\nsaid, the options that become available to the world\r\nwill depend on the answers that we provide. The\r\nOrganization’s credibility will continue to be judged by\r\nits effectiveness and its results on the ground. We must\r\nimprove and strengthen the United Nations apparatus.\r\nWe fully support the Secretary-General’s efforts in this\r\ndifficult task. At the same time, we believe that the\r\nUnited Nations system should better reflect the new\r\ninternational realities.\r\nThe sustained commitment of the United Nations\r\nis required if we are to find a definitive solution to the\r\n42\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\ncrisis in the Great Lakes region. The conflict there has\r\nalready cost millions of lives. We must not fail to\r\nrespond; inaction would constitute negligence. While I\r\ndo not underestimate the difficulties in this regard, I\r\nam convinced that a solution can be found. I refuse to\r\nbelieve, therefore, that the stabilization process is\r\ndoomed to deadlock or failure. In order to find a\r\nsolution, however, the international community must\r\nshow that it can make a difference. In that regard, it is\r\nencouraging to note how dedicated the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is to his mission. For its part, Belgium will\r\ncontinue to appeal to its European Union partners for a\r\ncollective and committed involvement in the region.\r\nIt is essential that stability and security be fully\r\nestablished and guaranteed in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo. It is clear that the transition process must\r\nbe successful. We in the international community\r\ncannot emphasize enough that political leaders have\r\nthe duty to make it succeed. Indeed, there is no\r\nalternative to that process as a means of achieving\r\npeace and development in the region.\r\nNation-building is impossible as long as impunity\r\nand insecurity exist. In that respect, the restructuring\r\nand the integration of the army are essential, as is the\r\ndemobilization and reintegration of former combatants.\r\nBelgium is currently training almost 300 Congolese\r\nsoldiers under its Train the Trainers programme.\r\nIt is also essential that the International\r\nCommittee to Accompany the Transition fully shoulder\r\nits responsibilities. For its part, Belgium is committed\r\nto taking an active part in the implementation of the\r\ndeclaration adopted by the countries members of that\r\nCommittee.\r\nThe United Nations Organization Mission in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) is\r\nplaying a crucial role, and Belgium attaches great\r\nimportance to that. It is not only the credibility of the\r\nUnited Nations that is at stake here, but — more\r\nimportant — the future of an entire region. Belgium\r\ntherefore supports a better targeted mandate for\r\nMONUC, as well as a strengthening of its means.\r\nWith our European partners, we are also\r\nconsidering the best way of making a joint contribution\r\nto that Mission. It goes without saying that the\r\nelections scheduled for 2005 will be crucial. They will\r\nrequire substantial human and financial means, to\r\nwhich Belgium has already decided it will contribute.\r\nWith regard to the situation in Rwanda, we offer\r\nour full support to the praiseworthy efforts made to\r\nachieve reconciliation. Normalized relations between\r\nRwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are\r\nabsolutely indispensable and must be based on\r\ncollaboration and good-neighbourly relations. This\r\nimplies a mutual respect of the borders.\r\nIn many regards, the latest developments in\r\nBurundi are encouraging. A constitution has been\r\nadopted, a referendum has been announced and an\r\nelectoral commission is in place. Elections are\r\nessential, of course, which is why Belgium has\r\nprovided significant financial backing to their\r\norganization. I urge the international community to\r\nspecify without delay what resources it is ready to\r\nmobilize for this purpose.\r\nBelgium shares the concerns about the\r\nhumanitarian crisis in Darfur. There is no excuse for\r\nthe persecution and systematic massacre of thousands\r\nof human beings. Given the scale of the suffering, the\r\nefforts and the progress made thus far remain\r\ninsufficient. Belgium therefore insists on the swift\r\nestablishment of an international commission of\r\ninquiry.\r\nThe situation in Iraq will continue to present a\r\nconsiderable challenge over the coming months and\r\neven years. I congratulate the United Nations for its\r\ncontinued support to the Iraqi transition process,\r\nespecially given the country’s climate of insecurity.\r\nThe population of Iraq, which has already faced so\r\nmany ordeals, must finally be able to live in peace. It\r\nis, of course, the Iraqi people who must shoulder the\r\nresponsibility of guiding the political process, a\r\nprocess that must lead to the creation of a new\r\nparliament, a new constitution and a sovereign\r\nGovernment. This Government must be capable of\r\nensuring the well-being of its citizens, as well as the\r\ncountry’s security, with no external assistance. To date,\r\nBelgium has allocated approximately €17 million to\r\nthe reconstruction process and we will provide air\r\ntransportation for the United Nations Assistance\r\nMission for Iraq (UNAMI) personnel between Amman\r\nand Baghdad.\r\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\r\nposes a serious threat to world security. The regime of\r\nnon-proliferation is jeopardized by an alarming\r\nsituation; the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nmust regain its place within this regime without delay.\r\n43\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is located in a region full\r\nof tensions, and its security concerns are legitimate.\r\nThe international community should therefore take this\r\ninto account in its approach to the problem. And the\r\nIranian authorities must cooperate entirely with the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and cease all\r\nactivities linked to the enrichment of uranium. By so\r\ndoing, Iran will contribute significantly to the\r\nstabilization and prosperity of the region.\r\nThe tragedy in Beslan has proved once again that\r\nterrorism attacks blindly. It goes without saying that no\r\nform of terrorism is justifiable. The indignation and\r\nanalysis that such acts may provoke can in no way vary\r\naccording to the victim, the location, the aggressor or\r\nthe circumstances. Appropriate military means and\r\nsecurity measures will remain necessary in order to\r\nfight terrorism, but means other than strictly military\r\nones are also required. Indeed, the environment in\r\nwhich terrorism thrives is comprised of ideological,\r\nsocio-economic, political and other variables.\r\nThis is why I plead for a dialogue between the\r\nWest and the Arab and Muslim world, involving not\r\nonly political leaders but also spiritual leaders, and not\r\nas a mere exchange of ideas or points of view, but in\r\norder to identify the instruments that could deny such\r\nbarbarous acts all legitimacy and raison d’être, with a\r\nview to finally bringing this appalling logic of death to\r\na halt.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Jesús Arnaldo Pérez,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Bolivarian Republic\r\nof Venezuela.\r\nMr. Pérez (Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): There\r\nare moments we can describe as historical turning\r\npoints, when nations and peoples must decide which\r\nside they are on. This is one of these moments, when\r\nhistory will judge us and examine if we were\r\ndemocratic leaders that represented the will of our\r\npeoples.\r\nIt is clear that the peoples of the world are taking\r\na stand against neo-liberal economics and war. They\r\nare fighting against those who would impose their will\r\nby military force and economic violence. They are\r\nresisting those who would undermine and even\r\noverthrow the basic principles that founded this\r\nOrganization that brings us together today. Under such\r\nconditions, Venezuela echoes the call of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, that all the nations\r\nthat proclaim the rule of law in their territory respect it\r\nabroad.\r\nAs you know, the majority of the peoples and\r\nGovernments of the world took a stand against the\r\nillegal war in Iraq. In this context, Venezuela reaffirms\r\nthe words of President Rodríguez Zapatero that peace\r\nis a task that demands more courage, more\r\ndetermination and more heroism than war.\r\nThe principal question for us is now the\r\nfollowing: are we building a world of real democracy,\r\nequality and justice or a world led by the tyranny of\r\neconomic and military power? The people of\r\nVenezuela were faced with such a decision last month,\r\nwith a referendum on the presidency. In fact, in the last\r\nsix years, Venezuelans have participated in eight\r\ndemocratic procedures, including referendums and\r\nelections. The 1999 Bolivarian Constitution of\r\nVenezuela allows for a mid-term referendum on a\r\nrecall of the popular vote. On 15 August of this year,\r\ncitizens of Venezuela clearly exercised their\r\nconstitutional right and, in an historic referendum\r\nnever before seen in the history of the world, ratified\r\nthe mandate of President Hugo Chávez Frías, thus\r\nconfirming the democratic process of structural\r\ntransformation led by our President.\r\nSince the end of the last millennium, we have\r\nwitnessed tremendous dissent from citizens of the\r\nworld against neo-liberalism and war. In my country,\r\nby the late eighties, a set of structural adjustments,\r\ndeveloped under the influence of the main centres of\r\nneo-liberal capitalism, was met with a popular uprising\r\nthat paralysed the country, leaving an indelible mark on\r\nour people’s minds. That resistance, popularly known\r\nas “El Caracazo”, was perhaps the first protest against\r\nneo-liberalism. The poor took control of the capital,\r\nCaracas, as well as cities across the country to\r\ndemonstrate their discontent with increasing poverty\r\nand the unjust distribution of the profits from our\r\nnation’s oil wealth. The ruling Government of the day\r\nresponded by sending in armed forces to suppress the\r\nprotests, killing thousands of people. That was a\r\npainfully tragic moment for the people of Venezuela.\r\nNevertheless, that event provoked the necessary\r\nconsciousness, igniting a political awakening among\r\nthe people that allowed them to unite their voices in the\r\nfight against neo-liberalism.\r\nOver the next decade, we witnessed protests\r\nagainst the World Trade Organization and against neo-\r\n44\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nliberalism in Chiapas, Davos, Seattle, Prague, Quebec\r\nCity and Genoa. Wherever the architects of neo-\r\nliberalism gathered, they were met with massive\r\nprotests in the streets.\r\nWe also witnessed the desperate actions of the\r\nbrave South Korean farmer in Cancún, who gave his\r\nlife to call attention to the plight of his fellow farmers\r\non the brink of disaster throughout the world.\r\nThe war in Iraq only strengthened the global\r\nprotests. On 15 February 2003, an estimated 30 million\r\npeople around the world marched in protest and\r\ndisbelief, unwilling to stand idly by as once again the\r\nworld’s screams fell on deaf ears, as not-so-smart\r\nbombs fell on little children without knowing why. If\r\nwe combine the protests against neo-liberal\r\nglobalization with the anti-war demonstrations, we will\r\nfind a global rebellion of revolutionary proportions has\r\nstarted. What we need to decide now is whether we\r\nwill march in the streets alongside our people or hide\r\nourselves away in an ivory tower.\r\nMy fellow leaders, have we no eyes and ears?\r\nCan we not see the suffering? Can we not hear the cries\r\nof the poor, the disenfranchised, the disappeared and\r\nthe desolate? Can we afford to shirk that\r\nresponsibility?\r\nAccording to the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), 44 per cent of Latin Americans\r\nlive below the poverty line. Although Latin America is\r\nnot the only region to face that reality, it is a\r\nparticularly conspicuous example because it represents\r\nthe laboratory of the neo-liberal project. Structural\r\nadjustment, as prescribed by the Washington\r\nConsensus, came early to Latin America, and its\r\napplication here became the model for the neo-\r\nliberalization of the former communist-bloc countries\r\nin the 1990s.\r\nBesides being the initial site of neo-liberalism’s\r\ndevastating experiment, Latin America was also the\r\nfirst to experience anti-neo-liberal explosion. Last\r\nMarch, UNDP released a report entitled “Democracy in\r\nLatin America”, which highlighted a startling\r\nrevelation: more than half of Latin Americans would\r\nprefer dictatorship over democracy if an authoritarian\r\nregime would solve their economic problems.\r\nA second report, released this past August by the\r\nprivate firm Latinobarómetro, came to a similarly\r\ndepressing conclusion — but with one notable\r\nexception: between 1996 and 2004 support for\r\ndemocracy actually grew in Venezuela, much more so\r\nthan in any other country in the region. In Venezuela\r\nsupport for democracy has undoubtedly increased.\r\nCould it be that there is a direct correlation between\r\nthose findings and the fact that Venezuela is actively\r\npursuing a viable alternative to market democracy?\r\nThe Nobel Prize-winning economist, Amartya\r\nSen, affirms that democracy is the best remedy for\r\nhunger. Indeed, in Venezuela, under the leadership of\r\nPresident Hugo Chávez Frías, we achieved that goal by\r\ngiving power to the poor. To reduce poverty, it is\r\nnecessary to increase democracy. There is no other\r\nway. Democracy is also the only way to defeat\r\nterrorism. No matter if poverty and hunger create the\r\nconditions for its existence, there are no “good” and\r\n“bad” terrorists. There is only one terrorism —\r\nreprehensible, detestable and cowardly. But, once\r\nagain, only through greater democracy can we defeat it.\r\nWhat the UNDP report reveals is that Latin\r\nAmericans have lost faith in a model of democracy\r\nwhose scope is limited to political representation. It is\r\na model that has entirely ignored the economic, social\r\nand participatory facets of democracy and which has\r\nconsequently completely failed to reflect the popular\r\nwill. As Simon Bolívar, our visionary liberator,\r\nadvocated two centuries ago, the best form of\r\ngovernment is one that provides the highest degree of\r\nhappiness, stability and social security for its people.\r\nA few days ago, President Lula of Brazil chaired\r\na hugely successful meeting of world leaders on the\r\ntheme “Action Against Hunger and Poverty”. That\r\nwonderful initiative, co-sponsored by Presidents\r\nChirac, Lagos Escobar and Rodríguez Zapatero,\r\nexpressed our common vision to fight against poverty\r\nand social injustice to guarantee security and\r\nsustainable development in both the North and the\r\nSouth. Our absolute support for that initiative is\r\nexpressed in the document on the subject of ending\r\npoverty and giving power to the poor which we\r\ndistributed to Members at the beginning of the General\r\nAssembly session.\r\nTo that end we recognize the need to go beyond\r\nthe traditional official development assistance\r\nframework. Venezuela’s contribution to the fight\r\nagainst hunger represents a genuine attempt to place\r\nthe tools of development in the hands of those who\r\nneed it most. In shifting from food aid to food\r\n45\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nsovereignty, we are not limiting ourselves to helping to\r\nfeed the poor; rather, we are committed to helping the\r\npoor to feed themselves.\r\nFor that reason food sovereignty in Venezuela\r\nputs a clear emphasis on assisting small producers\r\nfrom community-run cooperatives. A far-reaching land\r\nreform has already transferred over 2 million hectares\r\nof land to small producers. We have also made a firm\r\ncommitment to create a world seed bank in our country\r\nto protect our heritage of seeds from the violent\r\nencroachments of transgenic and genetically modified\r\ncrops.\r\nIn addition, we have recently created a Ministry\r\nof Food and Nutrition to guarantee our people their\r\nfundamental rights in that area.\r\nVenezuela ardently supports the initiatives under\r\nway to reform the United Nations. As supporters of\r\nmultilateralism and participatory democracy, we claim\r\na greater participation of the countries of the South at\r\nthe United Nations, and particularly in a more\r\ndemocratic Security Council, one in which there is no\r\nright of veto. In that regard, we support the candidacy\r\nof Brazil as a permanent member of an expanded\r\nCouncil.\r\nVenezuela aspires to join the Economic and\r\nSocial Council for the period 2005-2007. Our presence\r\nin the Economic and Social Council will help the\r\npeoples of the South to promote at the global level the\r\nideas and social justice we are trying to enact\r\ndomestically. To achieve that objective and to attain the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, we believe that the\r\ncountries possessing the resources must make a\r\nfinancial effort commensurate with the challenge.\r\nVenezuela has invested $2 billion in social\r\nprogrammes this year, and we recently helped establish\r\na fund of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting\r\nCountries (OPEC) to combat desertification and\r\ndrought, which greatly threaten our African brothers.\r\nThat assistance from OPEC members reflects our\r\nsolidarity with our brothers and sisters in Africa.\r\nVenezuela has already had the opportunity to assist\r\nseveral African countries through its policy of\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe United Nations was born in a world that was\r\ntraumatized by the atrocities of Second World War, yet\r\nhad the hope of creating a world of greater dignity for\r\nhuman beings.\r\nFifty-five years later, when we observe that the\r\nwill of the General Assembly is often not respected, it\r\nappears that we have lost our course. Thus, we run the\r\nrisk of submerging the world in a war of a thousand\r\nyears. It is time to put an end to the hypocrisy that\r\npermits a situation in which some resolutions are\r\nfollowed while others go unheeded.\r\nLet us have the courage to recover the original\r\ngoals of the Assembly. If we are courageous, we will\r\nrecognize not only that another world is possible but\r\nthat this other world is crucial for humanity.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland.\r\nMr. Cimoszewicz (Poland): The agenda of this\r\nsession not only is full of importance and burning\r\nissues but also brings great hopes and expectations. In\r\nhis statement, Mr. Bernard Bot, the Foreign Minister of\r\nthe Netherlands, presented the European Union’s\r\nposition on the most important problems. That\r\nstatement fully reflects our thinking and concerns. One\r\nissue, however, that deserves our special attention\r\ntoday is the reform of the United Nations.\r\nThe present session of the General Assembly\r\nmust be remembered as a session of reform. It should\r\nlay the foundations for a profound and\r\nconsensus-based reflection on the relevance and the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations. This reflection\r\nshould result in bold and imaginative decisions\r\nproviding for a substantial overhaul of the\r\nOrganization. That is how we in Poland see the\r\npreparations for the major event of 2005, which will\r\nundertake a comprehensive review of the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration Goals\r\nand mark the sixtieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan noted, the\r\nUnited Nations is at a fork in the road. It is time to act.\r\nEvery year, at the annual general debate of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, we take the floor to express our\r\nviews — sometimes very critical — on the work of the\r\nOrganization. However, there is little evidence that\r\nthese debates have had any significant impact on the\r\nfuture of the United Nations. Indeed, over the past\r\nyears, the United Nations has seen many celebratory\r\nand majestic gatherings. Unless we are able to build a\r\npolitical consensus and work out efficient,\r\nforward-looking and workable decisions, we should cut\r\ndown on high-level ceremonies.\r\n46\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nPoland has frequently voiced its conviction that\r\nwe have to carry out a comprehensive, strategic review\r\nof the role of the United Nations in both its normative\r\nand institutional aspects. It was with this in mind that,\r\non behalf of my country two years ago, I had the\r\nprivilege of putting forward the idea of a new political\r\nact for the United Nations. We are pleased to see that,\r\ntwo years later, that belief and determination are\r\nwidely shared.\r\nBearing in mind the unique momentum for\r\nreform, we look forward to the recommendations of the\r\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change.\r\nThey should provide the critical mass for the reform\r\nefforts and form a solid basis for further actions.\r\nIn that context, I express my gratitude to the\r\nmembers of the Panel, who came to Warsaw in May\r\nthis year to consult with representatives of our part of\r\nEurope on the most important conceptual aspects of the\r\nreform. The Warsaw Regional Conference was a\r\nrewarding experience. The report issued following the\r\nconference has been made available to all delegations\r\nat the Assembly.\r\nWe have never had any problem with ideas,\r\nexcellent proposals and promising initiatives. The\r\nbiggest obstacle to reform, rather, has been the lack of\r\npolitical consensus. The reform cannot be effective if it\r\nreflects the ideas of small groups of specialists or\r\npoliticians alone. It must rely on a broad consensus and\r\nreflect a shared community of values and a sense of\r\nidentity and purpose. Building that consensus is our\r\nmajor, common task.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations has to go\r\nbeyond institutional aspects, but we recognize the fact\r\nthat institutions are important. Therefore, any reform\r\npackage lacking ideas for reforming the organs of the\r\nUnited Nations would be considered inadequate by the\r\nmajority of Member States.\r\nPoland shares the common opinion that it is hard\r\nto imagine strengthening the role of the Security\r\nCouncil without increasing its legitimacy. Today’s\r\ndiscussions on Council reform are focused mainly on\r\nexpanding its membership. However, the key to a more\r\neffective and legitimate Security Council does not lie\r\nin the number of its members. A Council of\r\n24 members would probably have no more powerful a\r\nvoice than a Council of 15. However, at the present\r\nstage of discussions, we agree that the Security Council\r\nhas to be expanded.\r\nOne of the deficiencies of the United Nations, as\r\nit transpires from the conceptual discussions, is that\r\nthere is too great a gap between the functions of\r\nmandating and implementing. Therefore, we believe\r\nthat it is the responsibility of the members of the\r\nSecurity Council to take the lead in providing political\r\nand material support for implementation of Security\r\nCouncil mandates. Security Council reform should be\r\nbased on the assumption that membership on the\r\nCouncil not only confers additional privileges but also\r\nbrings additional responsibilities.\r\nThe reform should preserve the inherent balance\r\namong the various organs of the United Nations. While\r\nwe support the tendency to expect more from the\r\nSecurity Council, any reform should be accompanied\r\nby a more effective role for the General Assembly. The\r\ntwo bodies should be seen as mutually supportive and\r\nreinforcing organs.\r\nHowever, in order to use the potential of the\r\nGeneral Assembly effectively and optimize its\r\nperformance, we must profoundly change the way we\r\nspeak to one another in this forum. This must be a\r\nforum of dialogue. Occasionally, one hears jokes along\r\nthe lines that the General Assembly is a place where\r\neverybody speaks but nobody listens. We have to\r\nchange that. We must start talking to one another more\r\ndirectly, more candidly. Let me assure the President, as\r\nwe congratulate him on the assumption of his post, that\r\nPoland will support all his efforts in that regard.\r\nWe need to enhance the performance of the\r\nbodies of the United Nations in social and economic\r\ndevelopment and the environment, as well as in other,\r\nrelated, no less pressing areas. There is a real danger\r\nthat the Millennium Development Goals will not be\r\nfulfilled. That would deliver a serious blow to the\r\ncredibility of the United Nations. Given that the\r\ndistinction between socio-economic and political issues\r\nis becoming increasingly blurred, we need a unified\r\napproach.\r\nHowever, the existing efforts are often too\r\nfragmented, uncoordinated, and even contradictory and\r\nself-paralytic. In this context, the role of the Economic\r\nand Social Council and its reform should be strictly\r\nlinked with other United Nations bodies.\r\nIn order to be comprehensive, the reform cannot\r\nstop at its institutional dimension. We need to revisit\r\nthe nature of current security challenges that expose\r\nthe deficiencies and shortcomings of our Organization\r\n47\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nin the most systematic way. Predictable threats caused\r\nin the past by wars between countries have been\r\nreplaced by indefinite and unpredictable threats caused\r\nby international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons\r\nof mass destruction (WMDs), and an increasing\r\nnumber of States in distress, whose Governments are\r\nunable to exercise effective power over their territory\r\nand population. As a consequence, we are facing an\r\nunprecedented spread of terrorist acts and violence.\r\nIn this context, on behalf of the people of Poland\r\nand myself, I express our deepest condolences to the\r\nrelatives of the victims of the recent events in Beslan.\r\nWe condemn this barbaric act and offer our solidarity\r\nwith the victims.\r\nTo cope properly and successfully with the new\r\nnature of threats and challenges, it is necessary to use\r\nthis opportunity to examine the functional and\r\nconceptual basis of the Organization. Therefore,\r\nPoland advocates that the important part of the reform\r\nshould be re-examination of the conceptual foundations\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nIn today’s world, new threats cast a new light on\r\nthe concepts that we use to regulate the international\r\norder. Principles such as non-use of force, sovereignty,\r\nlegitimacy, accountability for both States and their\r\nleaders, subsidiarity, complementarity, solidarity and\r\nresponsibility still occupy the highest level of\r\nimportance. What we need is their adjustment to the\r\ncurrent reality, new political guidelines on how we, and\r\nhow Security Council members in particular, should\r\ntranslate them into action.\r\nAmong these concepts, the principle of solidarity,\r\nis for us more than just assisting the poor and\r\nunderdeveloped. Solidarity is an operational principle\r\nthat should generate cooperative attitudes for countries\r\nin need, including those plagued by terrorism, natural\r\nand man-made disasters and calamities, weak State\r\nstructures, and so forth.\r\nOne of the most important issues, in the light of\r\nthe particularly threatening nexus of terrorism and\r\nweapons of mass destruction, is the principle of the\r\nnon-use of force. The following aspects should be\r\nexamined: anticipatory self-defence, humanitarian\r\nintervention and collective use of force with\r\nauthorization by the Security Council.\r\nIn this respect, we need a code of conduct that\r\nwill give us sufficient predictability as to how we, as\r\nMembers of the United Nations, will act on the\r\ninternational scene when employing the United Nations\r\nas our instrument of choice and how we will make the\r\nbest use of its potential.\r\nWe also hope that the reform will strengthen the\r\nrole of the United Nations as a community of values.\r\nThe United Nations was born to unite its Members\r\nagainst threats and enemies. Today, it should unite us\r\nfor positive change in the consolidation of values, such\r\nas human rights, democracy, social justice, and\r\ndevelopment, which constitute the backbone and moral\r\nfoundation of humankind.\r\nWhen preparing future decisions, we should\r\ndiscuss not only the content but also the form. Poland\r\nbelieves that the best approach to this is to have a\r\npolitical document that would both spell out the\r\nreinforced message about the role, principles and\r\nvalues, and also contain the necessary institutional\r\nadjustments. We most definitely regard this document\r\nas something more than a set of amendments to the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nWe have to completely change the way we\r\nperceive the United Nations. For many years, most of\r\nour countries have been asking themselves what they\r\ncan get from the Organization. Today, it is time for all\r\nof us to secure the future of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Geir Haarde, Minister for\r\nFinance and Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nExternal Trade of Iceland.\r\nMr. Haarde (Iceland): Sir, it is with great\r\npleasure that I congratulate you on your election as\r\nPresident of the fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe are living in trying and turbulent times. As we\r\nmeet, the world continues to be haunted by the spectre\r\nof terrorism, as most recently evidenced in Russia and\r\nIraq. The victims are, as always, the innocent. The\r\nobjective is global instability and insecurity, leading to\r\nincreased intolerance and social regression. The\r\nhideousness of the means employed by terrorists\r\nexposes them for what they are. No just political cause\r\ncan be served by such acts.\r\nThe war against terrorism is a struggle against\r\nbarbarism. The perpetrators of terror must be rooted\r\nout and their bases and networks destroyed. This war is\r\ninherently a campaign in support of the values of the\r\n48\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nUnited Nations — the values that we all seek to\r\nfoster — and it is in response to a threat that has\r\nserious implications for all of the Member States of our\r\nOrganization. Our challenge is actively to defend\r\nfreedom against the forces of tyranny to affect the\r\nconditions that help create the spectre of terrorism.\r\nIf anyone thought the threats to global security\r\nthat provided the impetus for looking at serious\r\nreforms of the United Nations system had receded,\r\nthen surely the recent terrorist outrage in southern\r\nRussia gives pause for reflection. The great challenges\r\nin Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as in parts of Africa,\r\nand the considerable work still remaining to achieve\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals testify to the fact\r\nthat the need for change has not passed. On the\r\ncontrary.\r\nThe High-level Panel will soon submit its report,\r\nand next year a summit is planned for the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations and the fifth year\r\nafter the Millennium Summit. Iceland believes that we\r\nnow have a historic opportunity to undertake\r\nmeaningful and long-awaited reform. This would in no\r\nsmall way be a reinforcement of the idea of\r\nmultilateralism and, if genuine and far-sighted, will\r\nequip the United Nations to deal more effectively with\r\nthreats to global security.\r\nIt will be our weighty responsibility here next\r\nyear to hammer out decisions on reform. We will have\r\nthe opportunity to make changes that will equip the\r\nmultilateral system to be more effective in preventing\r\nconflict, in resolving conflict where it occurs and in\r\npost-conflict peace-building.\r\nWe can of course choose to do nothing. We can\r\nlinger complacently in the inertia of the status quo. The\r\nconsequence would, however, be that the United\r\nNations would become less and less capable of facing\r\nthese common challenges to our security.\r\nIn particular, we must grasp the chance to make\r\nthe Security Council itself more representative, while\r\nincreasing its efficiency and effectiveness. The\r\ndiscussions of many years on increasing the number of\r\nnon-permanent and permanent seats must reach a\r\nconclusion. It is time that certain countries that have\r\nlong made a considerable contribution to the work of\r\nthe United Nations be given permanent seats on the\r\nSecurity Council. I am referring in particular to\r\nGermany, India, Japan and Brazil. But it is no less\r\nimportant to ensure that Africa also be given a\r\npermanent seat on the Council.\r\nSmaller States make up the vast majority of\r\nUnited Nations Members. Ensuring that smaller States\r\nare adequately represented in the various organs of the\r\nUnited Nations is not only a matter of paying due\r\nregard to the principles of sovereignty; it is also a\r\npractical matter of ensuring that the particular\r\nchallenges faced by smaller States — both island States\r\nand others — are taken into account in the multilateral\r\nsystem. Iceland knows the problems related to being\r\nfar away from potential markets. We know well the\r\nstruggle of small economies to diversify, and we have\r\ndirect experience of the vulnerability of small countries\r\nto external economic shocks and natural disasters. I\r\nwould like to take this opportunity to extend our\r\nsympathy to all those Caribbean States that have\r\nsuffered so much in the recent hurricanes. My\r\nGovernment is considering ways in which it could\r\ncontribute to disaster relief or reconstruction.\r\nJust as it is fundamental to the legitimacy of the\r\nSecurity Council that there be fair representation of the\r\nvarious regions of the world, it is also important that\r\nthe many smaller States feel that their issues are\r\nunderstood and taken into account. In that context, I\r\nwould like to refer to the previously announced\r\ncandidacy of my country, Iceland, for a non-permanent\r\nseat on the Security Council for the period 2009-2010,\r\nwhich was already endorsed in 1998 by the Nordic\r\nStates — Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden —\r\nwithin the Group of Western European and other\r\nStates.\r\nSmaller States make a valuable contribution to\r\nrunning the multilateral system. Smaller States provide\r\nsome of the most innovative thinking on approaches to\r\nthe challenges we face and — in per capita terms and\r\noften in absolute terms — are some of the most\r\ngenerous contributors.\r\nAn issue of key concern to small island States,\r\nbut also to the world at large, is sustainable use of the\r\nworld’s resources. As Iceland completed its term as a\r\nmember of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment (CSD), my Government was very pleased\r\nto see the organizational changes in the working\r\nmethods of the CSD implemented at its twelfth session,\r\nin April. My Government looks forward to continuing\r\nits active participation in the future work of the CSD to\r\nachieve and promote the sustainable development of\r\n49\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nthe world’s resources. Iceland will also continue to\r\nwork on alternative energy resources, particularly the\r\npossibilities of hydrogen as a clean-energy provider.\r\nIceland is committed to attaining the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals as they are set out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. My Government will\r\nparticipate actively in the preparations for the major\r\nsummit in 2005. It is clear that the international\r\ncommunity must speed up its efforts in order to\r\nachieve, before 2015, the goals set by the Millennium\r\nSummit. We regard the 2005 summit to be one of the\r\nimportant milestones on the way to attaining them.\r\nI now turn to questions concerning particular\r\nregions. Iceland warmly welcomes the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)\r\ninitiative and its aim of ensuring democracy, human\r\nrights, good governance and sound economic\r\nmanagement. The efforts of African countries in the\r\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts in their own\r\nregion and the establishment of a Peace and Security\r\nCouncil within the African Union are ground-breaking\r\ndevelopments, as are the African mediation in a\r\nnumber of conflicts and the efforts of the African\r\nUnion and African regional organizations to develop\r\ntheir capabilities for peace-supporting operations.\r\nSub-Saharan Africa continues to be the focus of\r\nIcelandic bilateral development cooperation, and we\r\nwill continue to increase our contribution to and\r\ninvolvement in multilateral development cooperation.\r\nIceland welcomes the recent understanding\r\namong members of the World Trade Organization on a\r\nframework for the continuation of the Doha\r\ndevelopment round of negotiations on trade\r\nliberalization. The multilateral trading system is a\r\nproven vehicle for promoting economic development\r\nand growth, and it is central to the future prosperity of\r\nour nations. It is noteworthy that particular attention is\r\npaid to the needs of the least developed countries. It is\r\nimportant that they fully reap the benefits that the\r\nmultilateral trading system has to offer. Iceland\r\nbelieves that the framework will give the negotiators in\r\nGeneva a new platform for the prompt conclusion of\r\nthe Doha round. We want to do our part in making sure\r\nthat globalization benefits all countries, not least\r\nthrough targeted development cooperation. In an effort\r\nto assist African countries in making the most of the\r\nDoha round, Iceland is participating, together with the\r\nother Nordic countries, in the Nordic Africa initiative.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1546 (2004),\r\nunanimously adopted on 6 June, provided for the\r\nrestoration of sovereignty in Iraq. The resolution\r\nassigns the United Nations a leading role in helping to\r\nbuild a legitimate representative Government and\r\ndemocratic institutions. It also demonstrated the will of\r\nthe Council — and indeed of the rest of the\r\ninternational community — to resolve past differences\r\nand to give first priority to the political and economic\r\nreconstruction of Iraq. My Government remains\r\nprepared to lend its support to the difficult work ahead\r\nin Iraq. In Iraq, as elsewhere, Iceland would like to\r\nemphasize the importance of ensuring the safety of\r\nUnited Nations missions.\r\nAfghanistan will continue to occupy our attention\r\nin the coming months. The United Nations has done\r\nvaluable work in registering some 10 million voters.\r\nThe presidential elections on 9 October in Afghanistan\r\nwill be an important milestone in the process of\r\nrebuilding the country. We must maintain an ongoing\r\ncommitment to Afghanistan, where serious challenges\r\nto the rebuilding of the country continue to be faced.\r\nIceland has demonstrated its support and has assumed\r\nthe leading role in running the Kabul international\r\nairport, under the auspices of the NATO-led\r\nInternational Security Assistance Force.\r\nAn area of continuing concern is, of course, the\r\nMiddle East. The Icelandic Government continues to\r\ncall on Israel and the Palestinian Authority to resume\r\nnegotiations on a political settlement. The road map\r\nsets out a realistic way to achieve a two-State solution.\r\nIceland fully supports the efforts of the Quartet. We\r\nurge the Quartet and all other well-intentioned parties\r\nto continue to focus on this issue.\r\nAt the beginning of my remarks, I concentrated\r\non terrorism. Terrorism is an assault on human rights. I\r\nwould like to express strong support for the initiative\r\nof the Secretary-General urging Member States to\r\nratify all those conventions that concern protection of\r\nthe rights of the ordinary citizen.\r\nIn conducting the war against terrorism, we must\r\nprotect the human rights that terrorists themselves\r\nflout. We must be sure that human rights and\r\nhumanitarian law are not sacrificed. Here, I would like\r\nto refer to the key role played by the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross — and by the entire Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent movement — in monitoring\r\nthe implementation of the Geneva Conventions, and at\r\n50\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nthe same time to express my appreciation for that\r\nwork.\r\nDuring this session of the General Assembly,\r\nIceland will continue to work to advance the issue of\r\nhuman rights. In that context, we look forward to\r\nmarking the twenty-fifth anniversary of the entry into\r\nforce of the Convention on the Elimination of All\r\nForms of Discrimination against Women, and we urge\r\nthose States that are not parties to accede to the\r\nConvention. Iceland will also continue to work with\r\nothers to uproot racism and religious intolerance as a\r\nmajor way to prevent conflict and create a secure\r\nhuman environment.\r\nIceland is totally committed to the multilateral\r\nsystem, of which the United Nations is the fulcrum.\r\nWithout an effective multilateral system, conflict and\r\nits causes will be much more difficult to address. But,\r\nin order to be effective, the system needs change. The\r\nGovernment of Iceland sincerely hopes that we can\r\nbring about necessary change during the next year, and\r\nwe look forward to working with all Member States to\r\nthat end.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I give\r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Patricio Zuquilanda,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\r\nEcuador.\r\nMr. Zuquilanda (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nhave the honour to represent the President of Ecuador,\r\nMr. Lucio Gutiérrez Borbúa, and the people of Ecuador\r\nin this world forum of nations, to affirm once again\r\nthat my country, Ecuador, is an ally of States\r\ncommitted to peace and the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes. Ecuador is a law-abiding country, upholds the\r\nprinciple of international security and solidarity and is\r\na staunch defender of all the mandates arising from the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nIt is worth highlighting once again that Ecuador,\r\nin its relations with the international community,\r\nopposes all forms of discrimination or segregation,\r\ncolonialism or neocolonialism. On this occasion, the\r\nGovernment of Ecuador must once again ask the\r\ncommunity of nations and the international financial\r\norganisms to not lose sight of the heavy burden on our\r\ncountries represented by the service of the debt, which,\r\nyear after year, severely strains our economies. The\r\nEcuadorian Government calls on the United Nations to\r\nmove forward with greater determination in identifying\r\nspecific actions aimed at effectively reducing existing\r\npressures, and, furthermore, in formulating proposals\r\nto efficiently address with this issue in the long term\r\nand enable our countries to develop.\r\nThe Government of Ecuador must also draw\r\nattention to one of the most momentous problems\r\nafflicting the international community, namely the\r\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict. This terrible\r\nproblem reflects a reality entirely at odds with the most\r\nelementary ethical and moral principles of human\r\nconduct and that destroys the basic premises of\r\ncivilized co-existence, in which respect for life and the\r\ndignity of all individuals must necessarily be a priority.\r\nIt is time for the international community and the\r\nUnited Nations to give absolute priority to this issue\r\nand to find the political will and determination to\r\ntackle and eliminate every bloody and inhuman\r\nconflict in which international humanitarian law no\r\nlonger prevails. The Security Council is duty-bound, in\r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations, to\r\nreinforce the protection of civilians in armed conflicts,\r\nin order to avoid undermining the entire international\r\njuridical structure.\r\nTrue to its international commitments and its\r\nhumanitarian vocation, Ecuador has been welcoming\r\nthousands of refugees and immigrants from Colombia\r\nand other countries who have fled their countries\r\nbecause their lives, freedom and economic security\r\nhave been threatened. We must remind the\r\ninternational community that, in order to solve this\r\ncritical situation, we need the commitment of every\r\ncountry and international organism. For this reason, it\r\nis essential that in conformity with principles of shared\r\nresponsibility and shared burdens, countries, such as\r\nEcuador, which take in refugees and immigrants,\r\nshould receive greater technical and economic support.\r\nThis support is necessary to alleviate the social burden\r\nresulting from large numbers of persons entering local\r\nborder communities, which experience higher levels of\r\npoverty and lack basic services.\r\nWith regard to the analysis of the northern border\r\nof Ecuador made by the United Nations inter-agency\r\nmission, we appreciate the support offered by the\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General to implement the\r\ndevelopment proposals suggested in the report.\r\nEcuador would also like to have the support of the\r\ninternational community and the international financial\r\ninstitutions in this undertaking.\r\n51\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nThe Government of Ecuador urges the\r\ninternational community to make good its commitment\r\nto the implementation of programmes established by\r\nEcuador and Peru within the framework of the\r\nbi-national development plan for their common border,\r\nfollowing the signing of the peace agreements in\r\nBrasilia in 1998. These projects aim at meeting the\r\nbasic needs of the populations of the region, through\r\nsocial programmes and infrastructure projects.\r\nHowever, both Ecuador and Peru require the financial\r\nsupport of the countries that pledged their assistance\r\nfor the post-conflict era.\r\nTo our countries’ development problems we must\r\nadd the persistent trade barriers which developed\r\ncountries impose on our exportable products, as well as\r\nthe subsidies worth millions that they grant to their\r\nown products, especially agricultural ones, which\r\nseriously limit normal competition among countries,\r\nincrease unemployment and threaten the future of the\r\neducation, health and well-being of our peoples.\r\nDeteriorating conditions in developing countries\r\nhave resulted in increased flows of migrants towards\r\nindustrialized centres in search of employment, which\r\nis no longer available in their own countries. In some\r\ncountries, this exodus has met with restrictive and\r\nunfair policies based on xenophobic concepts that,\r\ninstead of providing a solution to the existing problem\r\nand to its root causes, make it even worse.\r\nInternational migration is a problem that has\r\ngrown more severe during the last decade. Each year,\r\nmore countries are affected by migration movements,\r\nwhich are commanding increasing attention at the\r\ndecision-making level. Migration reflects the human\r\nlonging to have the opportunity to pursue a better\r\nquality of life and enjoy greater economic prospects. It\r\nalso promotes exchange and understanding between\r\npeoples, strengthens dialogue and adds cultural and\r\neconomic enrichment.\r\nThe history of humanity is inconceivable without\r\nconstant migratory flows. It is evident, then, that the\r\nconsequences of these migration movements have\r\neconomic, political, social and demographic effects, as\r\nmuch for the countries of departure as for those of\r\narrival. In this context, and in this current era of market\r\nglobalization, emphasis must be placed on the\r\nliberalization of the supply of services via the free\r\nmovement of persons.\r\nEcuador is strongly committed to cooperating in\r\nthe search for solutions to this huge problem through a\r\nstrict control of the illegal migration of persons and the\r\nelaboration of universal agreements that favour the\r\ndevelopment of human beings within their respective\r\ncountries. However, to this end we require active\r\ncooperation between migrant source and recipient\r\ncountries, as well as from international organizations.\r\nMy country has traditionally maintained a policy\r\nof promoting, respecting and protecting the human\r\nrights of migrants, and for this reason, from this\r\nGeneral Assembly, I would like to appeal to all\r\nGovernments and all sectors of society, particularly\r\nthose of the developed world that receive migrant\r\nworkers, to direct their efforts towards the protection\r\nof the rights of this vulnerable sector of society in a\r\nnon-discriminatory manner, taking into consideration\r\nthe highly positive and productive aspects of\r\nmigration.\r\nThe territory of Ecuador is home to 12\r\nnationalities and more than 17 ethnic groups. This\r\ndiversity has been recognized in the Constitution of the\r\nRepublic, which defines Ecuador as a social democracy\r\nthat promotes the equitable distribution of welfare. The\r\nfundamental charter of the Ecuadorian State lays down\r\na legal framework that promotes the participation of\r\nethnic minorities in political structures and processes\r\nand guarantees the exercise of the constitutional rights\r\nof these groups in the public and private spheres.\r\nThe Government of my country cannot fail to\r\nmention that inequality has been, and continues to be,\r\nthe greatest impediment to economic development and\r\npoverty alleviation in many developing countries. The\r\ndisparity of wealth and income currently evident within\r\nand among many countries is a matter of concern for\r\nthe international community. In order to prevent this\r\ninequality, we need to adopt effective multilateral\r\nmeasures aimed at effectively reducing poverty, which\r\nin itself constitutes an affront to human dignity and\r\nconsequently harms the rights of individuals.\r\nIn this sense, it has become imperative that the\r\nintent of international summits addressing issues of\r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication become manifest\r\nthrough internal plans and programs based on enhanced\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nThe Government of Ecuador supports these\r\nactivities, which are embodied in three key areas:\r\npoverty reduction, political governance and\r\n52\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\ntransparency, and sustainable development through\r\nequitable access to natural resources. This commitment\r\nhas led Ecuador to be chosen as an example for the\r\nimplementation of innovative models, with the goal of\r\noptimizing the assistance and the quality of the\r\ncountry’s response.\r\nI believe it is essential that the voice of my\r\ncountry be heard on the topic of terrorism. This\r\nphenomenon has endangered the equilibrium, peace,\r\nharmony, and security of the planet. It has torn the\r\nsocio-political fabric of societies, damaged financial\r\nstructures and undermined the functioning of States’\r\nsecurity apparatus.\r\nI wish to reiterate the most unreserved support\r\nand backing of the Government of Ecuador for all\r\ninitiatives and actions created to fight international\r\nterrorism in all its forms and characteristics, but always\r\nwithin the framework of the decisions of the United\r\nNations, of international law and of absolute respect\r\nfor human rights.\r\nWe must highlight the fact that hunger, ill health,\r\npoverty, great economic disparities, lack of respect for\r\nhuman rights, corruption, attempts to resolve disputes\r\nand conflicts by non-peaceful means and the growing\r\nweight of external debt are the seeds of international\r\ninstability and insecurity; they undermine governance\r\nand are factors that destabilize democratic institutions.\r\nThe international community must become fully aware\r\nof the fact that these harsh daily realities confronting\r\ndeveloping countries also represent a threat to world\r\nsecurity. Therefore, we must directly combat terrorism\r\nwith a broad-based and concerted global strategy to\r\nfoster development, improve the living conditions of a\r\nlarge part of the marginalized world population and\r\nencourage dialogue and tolerance, both between human\r\nbeings and among States.\r\nThe international community needs to make the\r\nprotection and security of individuals a global policy\r\nobjective. The security of the State, of society and of\r\nindividuals requires a consideration of the threats to\r\ntheir fundamental values, which are sovereignty,\r\nidentity and survival. Only on that basis must we\r\nestablish the parameters of political, economic and\r\nmilitary action in a globalized world.\r\nEcuador, as a founding Member of the United\r\nNations, resolutely supports the multilateral system,\r\nsince it constitutes the best guarantee for the full\r\noperation of the purposes and principles that led to its\r\ncreation and which are enshrined in its Charter. As a\r\nresult, Ecuador fully supports the current process of\r\nreform of the United Nations, particularly of its main\r\nbodies, such as the Security Council, along with the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. We are\r\nconvinced that that will contribute to more effective\r\naction in the fulfilment of its mission.\r\nMy country wishes to highlight the statement\r\nmade here by the Prime Minister of Spain — his words\r\nof solidarity with the cause of Latin American peoples\r\nand his commitment to support the reduction of debt\r\nand of inequalities, as well as to promote and\r\nstrengthen relations between the European Union and\r\nLatin America. Ecuador welcomes this expression of\r\ngood will shown by Spain’s Prime Minister, since\r\nachieving those goals will contribute to the welfare of\r\nthe peoples.\r\nFinally, democracy and respect for Governments\r\nlegitimately established through popular vote are the\r\ngreatest triumphs of Latin America in recent decades.\r\nNo attempt whatsoever should be made to revise this\r\nbasic principle of international policy, lest we seriously\r\naffect the system of normal coexistence among nations.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to urge the international\r\ncommunity to always bear in mind the precious ideals\r\nof human beings that inspire this Organization, as set\r\nforth in the Preamble to its Charter, which are the\r\nfundamental mandates for its Members and various\r\nbodies.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. João Bernardo de Miranda,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Angola.\r\nMr. Miranda (Angola) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): I am\r\noverwhelmed with a great sense of joy at seeing\r\nMr. Ping preside over the General Assembly at this\r\nfifty-ninth session. My first words are thus to convey\r\nto him, on behalf of my Government and on my own\r\nbehalf, the most heartfelt congratulations upon his\r\nelection. Our satisfaction springs from the great esteem\r\nin which the Angolan people hold your country and\r\nfrom the strong ties of friendship and fraternity that\r\nunite us.\r\nI would also like to congratulate your predecessor\r\nfor the dynamic manner in which he carried out his\r\nmandate.\r\n53\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nAt a time when the world is confronting the\r\nhorrors of violence, poverty and hunger, the members\r\nof the Assembly once again have the difficult\r\nresponsibility of assessing the implementation of their\r\ndecisions and of seeking new solutions to problems\r\nthat affect millions of human beings — solutions that\r\nwill require a mechanism for international cooperation.\r\nThe United Nations must remain the pivotal\r\ninstrument for States in dealing with new international\r\nchallenges to peace and security, such as terrorism;\r\nhunger; poverty; violations of human rights that\r\ncontinue to deprive millions of human beings of their\r\nfundamental freedoms; the degradation of the\r\nenvironment; organized transnational crime, including\r\ndrug trafficking; and HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe recent difficulties that the United Nations has\r\nconfronted in dealing with situations that have\r\nseriously affected international security have exposed\r\nthe limitations of its structure and its operation. The\r\nUnited Nations system must be urgently reformed and\r\nadapted to the demands and challenges of the current\r\nsituation, which is characterized by globalization.\r\nThe main organs of the United Nations lack the\r\nbroad democratic character that they need in order to\r\nexpress the will of the majority of the Members of the\r\nOrganization. Both categories of membership of the\r\nSecurity Council should be expanded — on the basis of\r\nequitable geographical representation — so as to\r\nreflect the new international order.\r\nIn the past 50 years, humanity has made\r\nimportant advances in the areas of science and\r\ntechnology, economic development, medicine and\r\nother fields, which have resulted in improved living\r\nconditions and in an increase in the life expectancy of\r\nvast segments of the world’s population, as well as in\r\nthe growth of the world’s material and even spiritual\r\nwealth.\r\nHowever, while some countries and continents\r\nhave shared in those gains, others continue to be\r\nmarginalized — overwhelmed by economic setbacks\r\nthat force a significant part of their population to live\r\nbelow the poverty line.\r\nThe aspirations of such people to a world of\r\nsocial justice and the full exercise of their economic\r\nand social rights, including the right to development,\r\ncontinue to be unfulfilled. In fact, the ranks of the poor\r\nhave not stopped growing: since 1990, the number of\r\npoor people has been growing in sub-Saharan Africa,\r\nSouthern Asia and in Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nIn the recent summit on hunger and poverty,\r\npromoted by the President of Brazil, Lula da Silva,\r\nworld leaders highlighted the dramatic situation of\r\nbillions of human beings living mainly in developing\r\ncountries who are suffering from hunger, malnutrition\r\nand diseases that are easily preventable.\r\nThis is a reprehensible picture, and we must\r\ntherefore make the eradication of hunger and poverty a\r\npriority in our national policies and on the\r\nOrganization’s agenda. This dramatic situation could\r\nrapidly be reversed by a greater commitment on the\r\npart of the Governments of developing countries and a\r\nstronger political will on the part of the richest\r\ncountries.\r\nFurthermore, restrictions on international free\r\ntrade have contributed to a deterioration in the living\r\nconditions of people in countries subjected to\r\nrestrictive economic measures, as is the case in Cuba.\r\nWe believe that such measures constitute an assault on\r\nmoral and humanitarian principles.\r\nIn spite of the efforts made by developing nations\r\nto improve their economic performance and the\r\nwell-being of their populations, the practical results do\r\nnot measure up to the needs of the development\r\nprocess. This is partly the result of the imposition on\r\ndeveloping countries of policies that do not take their\r\nrealities into account.\r\nSome institutions and rich countries are\r\npressuring poor countries to follow the steps taken by\r\nindustrialized countries during their economic\r\ndevelopment, alleging that developing countries will\r\ndevelop faster because of the benefits resulting from\r\nthe implementation of policies that have in the past\r\nyielded positive results.\r\nSuch guidelines do not come close to meeting the\r\ndevelopment needs of poor countries. They fail to\r\nplace an emphasis on training institutions at the local\r\nand national level; those institutions should, indeed,\r\nserve as levers for development.\r\nWealthy nations have a moral responsibility to\r\nfoster a spirit of partnership, not of inequality and\r\ndependence, so as to contribute to the development of\r\nthe less affluent countries and to the establishment of\r\ninstitutions capable of sustaining their integration into\r\nthe global economy.\r\n54\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nThe existing economic disparities between the\r\nwealthy countries of the North and the developing\r\ncountries of the South is not the result of choice on the\r\npart of the latter. The enrichment of the industrialized\r\nworld has been achieved at the expense of the\r\nimpoverishment of the Third World through the\r\nrampant exploitation of its natural resources and\r\nworkforce and the imposition of a system of\r\noccupation and dominance.\r\nToday, our countries and peoples are still\r\nsuffering as a result of those policies of exploitation\r\nand subjugation, which in some cases have been\r\nworsened by internal conflicts that came about after the\r\nend of the period of foreign dominance.\r\nIt appears to us at times that the international\r\nfinancial institutions and the rich countries deliberately\r\nminimize those facts. From our point of view, the\r\nextensive hesitation with respect to financial assistance\r\nto developing countries is unjustified. Furthermore,\r\nsome of the imposed preconditions seem to be a\r\nresponse more to political interests rather than to the\r\nrequirements of sustainable economic development.\r\nWe had until recently called on this body and on\r\nthe international community to support the restoration\r\nof peace in Angola. That long-sought peace has finally\r\narrived and it has proved to be irreversible.\r\nThe success of the peace process ushered in a\r\nnew phase: the laying of the political groundwork for\r\nthe construction of a new society, one based on the rule\r\nof law, tolerance, a market economy, and the existence\r\nof a vibrant civil society. In addition to that political\r\nprocess, my Government is engaged in economic\r\nreform, which is a contributing factor to economic and\r\nsocial stability. Were it not for the tremendous,\r\nsimultaneous challenges that we have had to face, that\r\nprocess could have been faster.\r\nSo far, the Angolan Government has been\r\ntackling alone the task of national reconstruction. That\r\ntask involves the rehabilitation of social and productive\r\ninfrastructures, which were almost totally destroyed by\r\nthe armed conflict; the social reintegration of nearly\r\n100,000 former combatants and their families; the\r\nresettlement of more than 4 million internally displaced\r\npersons and more than 400,000 refugees; and a far-\r\nreaching effort to reduce the poverty that afflicts most\r\nof the population. This very difficult task can be\r\nsuccessful only with the full participation of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe reservations expressed by certain\r\ninternational donors in terms of providing assistance to\r\nAngola — overlooking the fact that the internal\r\nconflict was quite lengthy and destructive, that it\r\nabsorbed a large part of the country’s financial, human\r\nand materials resources, and that it disrupted the\r\ncountry — can be justified only by a lack of political\r\nwill.\r\nThe reconstruction of Angola urgently requires\r\npartnerships and substantial support comparable to the\r\nassistance given to other countries in post-conflict\r\nsituations.\r\nAs a country that is rejoicing in the peace and\r\nfreedom for which it fought for 40 years, Angola is\r\nconcerned with the instability in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, a country that shares an\r\nextensive land border with Angola, and with which we\r\nhave fraternal ties. We were particularly shocked by\r\nthe massacres of civilians in Gatumba. The\r\nperpetrators of that heinous act, who provoked a new\r\nescalation of violence in order to make the peace\r\nprocess unworkable, must be held judicially\r\naccountable. That act makes clear, inter alia, that,\r\ndespite the significant efforts made in the context of\r\nthe peace process in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, the situation is still quite fragile.\r\nThe international community, particularly the\r\nSecurity Council and the African Union, must devote\r\nspecial and ongoing attention to this issue in order to\r\navoid a collapse of the process.\r\nIn that context, subregional organizations, the\r\ncountries of the region and other bodies involved in the\r\npursuit of lasting peace in that country must cooperate,\r\nwith a view to encouraging the Congolese parties to\r\nmeet their commitments under the transitional process.\r\nIt is crucial that all the countries neighbouring the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo reiterate their\r\ncommitment to continue to respect the sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of the country and not to interfere\r\nin its internal affairs.\r\nThe Transitional Government of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo needs the support of the\r\ninternational community. My Government is willing, to\r\nthe extent of its ability, to supply the necessary\r\nassistance in the process of the consolidation of peace\r\nand stability in that country.\r\n55\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nThe crisis in Darfur is a thorn in the international\r\njuridical conscience. Angola supports the decision of\r\nthe Secretary-General to authorize an investigation. We\r\nhope that the authorities of the Sudan will fully\r\ncooperate with the African Union and the Security\r\nCouncil in their efforts to help bring peace to the\r\npeople of that region. We believe that there now exists\r\na solid basis for resolving that conflict.\r\nHaving in the past been a victim of terrorism,\r\nAngola cannot be indifferent to acts of terrorism,\r\nwherever they may happen. The acts of terrorism we\r\nhave witnessed in recent times, and the vile and cruel\r\nform they have taken, should not discourage the efforts\r\nthat the international community has been making to\r\nroot out their perpetrators, but should instead increase\r\nits determination to isolate terrorist groups and stymie\r\ntheir efforts.\r\nWe believe, however, that we should reflect\r\nfurther on ways to prevent and combat terrorism. Have\r\nthe methods used to date been effective in eradicating\r\nterrorism? Is the current system of collective security\r\ncapable of coping with the aggressiveness of the\r\nterrorists? Would responses to terrorism based on the\r\nmultilateral efforts of the United Nations be less\r\neffective?\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate for this\r\nmeeting.\r\nI call on the representative of Haiti, who has\r\nasked to speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the\r\nsecond and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nI call on the representative of Haiti.\r\nMr. Merores (Haiti) (spoke in French): In his\r\nstatement before the General Assembly this morning,\r\nThe Honourable Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister of\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, presented an\r\noverview of the political situation in Haiti that,\r\nunfortunately, does not reflect the realities of my\r\ncountry.\r\nAs such, in accordance with rule 115 of the rules\r\nof procedure of the General Assembly, my delegation\r\nintends to exercise its right of reply to provide a better\r\nclarification, without entering into a useless debate\r\nwith this sister nation of the Caribbean.\r\nPrime Minister Gonsalves referred to an\r\ninterruption of the democratic process in Haiti\r\nbeginning on 28 February 2004. In that regard, I should\r\ndraw to the Assembly’s attention the fact that,\r\nfollowing the presidential vacancy duly noted on\r\n29 February 2004, and in conformity with article 149\r\nof the Haitian Constitution of 1987, The Honourable\r\nBoniface Alexandre, in his capacity as President of the\r\nSupreme Court, was sworn in as interim President of\r\nthe Republic.\r\nHere, I should recall that that presidential\r\nvacancy had been created by the departure of former\r\nPresident Aristide, who, faced with the threat\r\nrepresented by — as he believed — his own supporters\r\nand a situation that he could no longer control,\r\nrequested the assistance of a third nation to help him\r\nleave the country. The void thus created was duly noted\r\nby the United Nations and by the Organization of\r\nAmerican States during discussions in which Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines participated. And, in the\r\nlight of that state of affairs, a consensus\r\nGovernment — whose formation saw the participation\r\nof all of the country’s actors, including the supporters\r\nof the Lavalas party — was established, with the\r\nmandate of organizing free and credible elections in\r\n2005.\r\nTwo days ago, before the Assembly, the Haitian\r\nhead of State solemnly reiterated that commitment in\r\nthe following terms:\r\n“The democratic process has begun. Political\r\nparties are forming, and others are re-organizing\r\nthemselves. A constant and fruitful dialogue has\r\nbegun between the authorities of the State, the\r\npolitical class and civil society organizations in\r\nthe country.” (A/59/PV.6)\r\nLater in the same statement, he said:\r\n“General elections will be organized in 2005. The\r\nGovernment resolutely supports this process, and,\r\non 7 February 2006, I must and will hand power\r\nover to a democratically elected President.”\r\nThe Republic of Haiti has thus remained\r\ncommitted to Security Council resolutions 1529 (2004)\r\nand 1542 (2004), which created, respectively, the\r\nMultinational Interim Force and the United Nations\r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). In our\r\n56\r\nA/59/PV.10\r\nview, those texts better reflect Haitian realities and are\r\nuseful tools to improve the lot of the Haitian people.\r\nThe provisional Government is deeply attached to\r\nthe principles of respect for human rights and respect\r\nfor human dignity, which are imperative in the\r\nfunctioning of any democratic State. The Government\r\nis working, with international cooperation, to\r\nstrengthen State institutions, particularly the judicial\r\nsystem. Unfortunately, the Government of Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines has portrayed the Haitian\r\nGovernment in a negative light following a popular\r\nverdict in which no member of the Government had to\r\nintervene and which was in conformity with the\r\ncountry’s Constitution and laws.\r\nI should like to recall that the judicial branch in\r\nHaiti is a State organ that acts completely\r\nindependently of the executive branch. His Excellency\r\nthe President of the Republic of Haiti clearly recalled\r\nthat in the following terms:\r\n“The necessary reform of the Haitian\r\njudicial system is clearly an imperative. But it is\r\nfundamentally unjust to blame the present\r\nGovernment for brazen interference in judiciary\r\nproceedings or to systematically bleed\r\nmagistrates and the civil servants in charge of\r\nestablishing the law.\r\n“The Government of Haiti is extremely\r\nsensitive to the comments and remarks of its\r\nfriends and partners with whom it is cooperating\r\nin all fields of political, economic and social\r\ngovernance; but it refuses to be associated with or\r\nconnected to decisions that involve only one\r\norgan of the State, which acted completely\r\nindependently, even if those decisions might raise\r\ncertain questions.” (A/59/PV.6)\r\nTherefore, the Haitian Government deplores the\r\nstatement of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, which\r\ncomes at a time when Haiti — working together with\r\nthe international community, particularly\r\nMINUSTAH — has undertaken efforts to promote\r\npolitical stabilization and to provide assistance to the\r\nvictims of the recent natural disaster that engulfed the\r\ncountry. I should like to take this opportunity to thank\r\nthe many friendly countries and humanitarian\r\norganizations involved in that process. But we deeply\r\nregret this unfortunate statement, which could harm\r\nthose efforts and could unfortunately be interpreted as\r\nan endorsement of the violence and insecurity that\r\npersist in certain areas of the country.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I call\r\non the representative of Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines on a point of order.\r\nMr. Daniel (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines):\r\nThe delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\r\nwould like to exercise its right to reply to the statement\r\nmade by the previous speaker at a later date.\r\nThe meeting rose at 9.10 p.m.\r\n"
