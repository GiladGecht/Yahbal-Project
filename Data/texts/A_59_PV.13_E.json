(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Askar Akayev, President of the\r\nKyrgyz Republic\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nKyrgyz Republic.\r\nMr. Askar Akayev, President of the Kyrgyz\r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Askar Akayev,\r\nPresident of the Kyrgyz Republic, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Akayev (spoke in Russian):\r\nMr. President, allow me first of all to congratulate you\r\nmost warmly on your election to the important post of\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession and to wish you success in your very complex\r\ntask. I also wish to express our gratitude to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte.\r\nIn our troubled times, humankind is placing its\r\nmost cherished hopes on the United Nations. Here at\r\nthe rostrum of this Organization, I would like to\r\nexpress our deep satisfaction with the resolve with\r\nwhich the present session of the Assembly has\r\nembarked on a policy that is a quest for effective\r\nsolutions to the key problems now facing the\r\ninternational community.\r\nAfter 11 September, the highest priority\r\nunquestionably has been given to fighting international\r\nterrorism, which has now acquired the nature of a\r\ndirect war. This is an evil challenge to humankind. We\r\nsincerely grieve for the innocent victims of terrorist\r\nacts, wherever they may occur. Any victim evokes\r\nsympathy, but the massacre of children in Beslan is\r\nhideously evil. The time has come for terrorists to be\r\ncalled to account for their criminal acts.\r\nThe “terrorist international” must be faced with a\r\nunited anti-terrorist front on all continents, regions and\r\ncountries. It is therein that I see the key to victory.\r\nThe tone was set for this session by the statement\r\nmade by Secretary-General Kofi Annan. With his\r\ncustomary perspicacity, he emphasized that the highest\r\nvalue is that of the supremacy of law in domestic and\r\nforeign affairs. Genuine interest in organizing\r\ncollective action to address new challenges and threats\r\nwas a leitmotif of the statements made from this\r\nrostrum by United States President George Bush, the\r\nheads of several States, the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, and other high-\r\nranking representatives. Those statements were\r\nevidence of the growing confidence in our\r\nOrganization and, I believe, represent a long-awaited\r\nrebuff to those who wish us ill and to sow doubts\r\nregarding the United Nations ability to resolve today’s\r\npressing problems.\r\nA special feature of our forum today is the fact\r\nthat, along with other extremely important objectives,\r\nit must serve as a preparatory stage for the sixtieth\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nanniversary session of the General Assembly. The\r\ninternational community has the right to expect that\r\nnext year’s session will prove to be an historic event\r\nand establish new landmarks for United Nations\r\nactivity. Recalling the ideals endorsed by the founders\r\nof the United Nations, and on the basis of\r\ncontemporary requirements, I would propose that the\r\nanniversary session be called a summit of peace and\r\neconomic and social progress.\r\nTurning now to the United Nations role in the life\r\nof my country, I should like to convey to the\r\nOrganization and its specialized agencies our sincere\r\ngratitude for their support of our national efforts in all\r\nareas of State-building. My people will forever recall\r\nthe decision taken at the fifty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in support of the 2,200th\r\nanniversary of Kyrgyz statehood.\r\nOne axiom of Kyrgyz foreign policy is that small\r\ncountries must have big friends. For us, the United\r\nNations has always been such a tried and trusted\r\nfriend. That is most appropriate for the development of\r\nour Republic on its path to democracy. It is well known\r\nthat the electoral process is considered to be a litmus\r\ntest for the level of democracy achieved in any given\r\ncountry. This year, with direct assistance from\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, the implementation of a\r\nUnited Nations project in Kyrgyzstan has initiated\r\nimprovements to the national electoral system with a\r\nview to ensuring that it meets international standards.\r\nThat is particularly important given the election\r\ncampaign now beginning to organs of power at every\r\nlevel in the Republic. In that context, United States\r\nPresident George Bush’s proposal that a fund for\r\ndemocracy be established within the United Nations is\r\nindeed a good one. Such a fund would substantially\r\nenhance the United Nations potential in that area.\r\nI should now like to turn to another problem. Two\r\nyears ago, under United Nations auspices, the Global\r\nMountain Summit was convened in our capital,\r\nBishkek. In that context, too, we are most grateful for\r\nthe Secretary-General’s assistance. The Bishkek Global\r\nMountain Platform was drafted at the Summit, defining\r\nkey objectives for the sustainable development of\r\nmountain countries. That important document was\r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nsession.\r\nAt this session, I wish also to draw the\r\ninternational community’s attention to the needs of the\r\nleast developed mountain countries. The time has come\r\nto propose, on behalf of interested countries, the\r\nadoption at this session of a special resolution\r\nrecommending forgiveness of the foreign debt of the\r\nleast developed mountain countries. That would serve\r\nas a powerful stimulus to their comprehensive\r\ndevelopment and to overcoming poverty and would\r\nfully jibe with the objectives proclaimed in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. A draft resolution on that\r\nsubject will be submitted to the General Assembly by\r\nthe delegation of the Kyrgyz Republic and other\r\ndelegations.\r\nIn considering future prospects, I believe that the\r\ninterests of all groups of countries are most fully\r\nreflected in the decisions of the Millennium Summit. I\r\nam gratified that a thorough and scrupulous analysis of\r\nthe results of five years of implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration is being planned as a major\r\nelement on the agenda of the sixtieth anniversary\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I consider the war on\r\npoverty to be of great importance in that context. The\r\nlink between poverty and international terrorism is\r\nindisputable. Those phenomena are organically\r\nintertwined. Unless we can overcome poverty and the\r\nmass despair and sense of hopelessness it entails, in\r\nparticular among young people, our hopes for\r\nuprooting international terrorism may indeed prove\r\nfutile.\r\nIn seeking to eradicate poverty, Kyrgyzstan is\r\nrelying above all on its own potential. We are most\r\ngrateful in that respect for the assistance of the United\r\nNations and the international community, expressed,\r\ninter alia, in the Monterrey Consensus. In that\r\nconnection, we are hoping for increased assistance\r\nthrough the United States Millennium Challenge\r\nAccount. In general, assistance for the development of\r\npoor countries could be considerably enhanced. I\r\nbelieve that this problem will also be duly reflected in\r\nthe work of the present and anniversary sessions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nEarlier, I linked the eradication of poverty and the\r\nfight against international terrorism. Within the range\r\nof interlinked measures, however, a policy to eradicate\r\ninternational terrorism through the vigorous application\r\nof collective force is of unique significance. Within the\r\nframework of the anti-terrorist Coalition now active\r\nunder United States auspices, Kyrgyzstan is making an\r\nimportant contribution to suppressing the ever-active\r\nhotbed of terrorism in Afghanistan. I am convinced\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nthat the October elections in that country will be a very\r\nimportant factor in its democratic reorganization and\r\nhave a positive impact on the situation in the region as\r\na whole.\r\nIn order to enhance its contribution to the\r\ninternational community’s war on international\r\nterrorism, Kyrgyzstan has allowed the deployment on\r\nits territory — within limited parameters, I would\r\nemphasize — of armed Russian and United States\r\ncontingents. We are convinced that, in so doing, we are\r\nstrengthening the interaction of those great Powers in\r\ntoday’s war on a common enemy. Our Kyrgyz land will\r\ncontinue to be a place for the great Powers to cooperate\r\nand to pool their efforts, rather than to compete.\r\nWe support international action to eradicate the\r\nterrorist threat in Iraq. That has become the principal\r\nobstacle to the development of democracy and to\r\nensuring peace in that country. We know from our own\r\nexperience that this is a long and thorny path, but one\r\nthat Iraq will have to take. The foundation for the\r\ninternational community’s actions must be the\r\nprinciple that, in assisting Afghanistan and Iraq in\r\ncombating terrorism, establishing peace and building\r\ndemocracy, we are assisting ourselves.\r\nI believe that there is a need here to unmask any\r\nattempt to provide scholarly justification of any sort\r\nfor international terrorism. I am referring here in\r\nparticular to the concept of the clash of civilizations,\r\nwhich cannot be thought of as an innocent theoretical\r\nexercise.\r\nIn that light, this summer, along the shores of our\r\n“blue pearl”, Lake Issyk-Kul, Kyrgyzstan and the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization organized a conference entitled “Eurasia\r\nin the twenty-first century: Dialogue of cultures or a\r\nconflict of civilizations?” The idea of a conflict of\r\ncivilizations was firmly condemned at the conference.\r\nFor my part, I believe that the term “conflict of\r\ncivilizations” should be erased from the global political\r\nlexicon as unfounded theoretically and harmful in\r\npractice. I note with satisfaction that, in his statement\r\nat this session, President Bush rejected the concept of a\r\nconflict of civilizations. The future belongs to the\r\ndialogue of cultures and civilizations.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to address the issue of\r\nUnited Nations reform. Kyrgyzstan supports proposals\r\naimed at bringing the Organization ever more closely\r\nin line with the realities of the twenty-first century,\r\nparticularly with respect to the role of the Security\r\nCouncil. In that regard, I believe that the United\r\nNations at its anniversary session can and must decide\r\nto include Germany and Japan among the permanent\r\nmembers of the Council. We also support the\r\nexpansion of the permanent and non-permanent\r\ncategories of Council membership on the basis of the\r\nprinciple of equal geographic distribution.\r\nThe enhancement of the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping potential is another positive concept.\r\nKyrgyzstan will continue to respond positively to\r\nrequests for its personnel in efforts to attain those\r\ngoals.\r\nLastly, Kyrgyzstan and other countries of Central\r\nAsia, in cooperation with Russia and China, intend to\r\ncontinue to support the international community’s\r\nefforts to counter international terrorism and to meet\r\nother global challenges and threats through active\r\nregional measures. Evidence of our resolve is the\r\ngrowing role of the Shanghai Cooperation\r\nOrganization, the Commonwealth of Independent\r\nStates and the Collective Security Organization.\r\nFrom this high rostrum, I reaffirm that\r\nKyrgyzstan, in a spirit of unwavering dedication to the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations, will\r\ncontinue to be a reliable link in the international\r\ncommunity’s efforts to ensure peace, security and\r\nprosperity for all peoples of this planet.\r\nMr. Askar Akayev, President of the Kyrgyz\r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency the Honourable Sonatane Tu’a\r\nTaumoepeau-Tupou, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nKingdom of Tonga.\r\nMr. Taumoepeau-Tupou (Tonga): I congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your presidency and know well that we are\r\nin excellent hands. I should also like to pay tribute to\r\nMr. Julian Hunte for his excellent stewardship of the\r\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe are enthusiastic at the forthcoming 10-year\r\nreview of the Barbados Programme of Action. We see\r\nit as an extension and implementation of the\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\ncommitments agreed to in the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation and, in particular, in its chapter VII.\r\nWhilst the developmental path to Mauritius in January\r\n2005 has been fraught with its own challenges, it is\r\ncritical to small island developing States that the\r\nimpetus for that important global review not be lost in\r\nits own rhetoric. It is paramount that the outcomes\r\nfrom Mauritius be refined and focused on translating\r\nthe oft-quoted special case of small island developing\r\nStates into firm and timely support and global\r\nimplementation. As such, participation by all member\r\nStates in the forthcoming preparatory process and in\r\nthe International Meeting in Mauritius is essential to\r\nrealizing our development aspirations.\r\nThe geographical makeup of small island States\r\nputs some of our islands at a disadvantage. That is\r\nbecause economic development has focused on larger\r\nislands with large populations, which thereby enjoy a\r\nhigher per capita income than do other islands of the\r\ncountry. That is true of Tonga, where the main focus of\r\ndevelopment has been devoted to the larger islands of\r\nthe three main island groups, but within each of those\r\nthree groups other islands need further economic\r\ndevelopment. Three remote islands to the north, known\r\nas the Niuas, are disadvantaged by the tyranny of\r\ndistance and are in fact in closer proximity to Samoa\r\nthan they are to our own capital. The outlying islands\r\nof the Vava’u and Ha’apai groups are less developed\r\nthan their main islands, while `Eua to the south-east of\r\nTongatapu has potential but needs targeted inputs.\r\nThough we have designated core donors to those\r\nislands, their further development will need additional\r\nor new resources. So I hope that, in the review of the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action, some thought is given\r\nto the lot of those living on these disadvantaged\r\nislands.\r\nAs a developing ocean State, we are vigilant\r\nabout progress in ocean affairs and law of the sea\r\nissues. We consider the valuable contribution made by\r\nthe meeting of States parties to the Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea and its subsidiary bodies — in\r\nparticular, the achievements of the International\r\nSeabed Authority, to whose mandate a research\r\nfunction should be added, and the work of the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf —\r\nworthy of mention. Together with the important role of\r\nthe United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess, this sets a firm and practical platform for our\r\nwork during this session.\r\nI am happy to note that the third informal meeting\r\nof States parties to the United Nations Fish Stocks\r\nAgreement has seen firm commitments by certain\r\nStates Parties to enable the implementation and\r\nconcrete operation of elements of part VII of the\r\nAgreement with special emphasis on and relevance to\r\nsmall island developing States. We continue to\r\nencourage other member States to become parties to\r\nthe Agreement.\r\nWe are particularly pleased that the Convention\r\nfor the Conservation and Management of Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central\r\nPacific Ocean entered into force earlier this year. We\r\nconsider that special milestone worthy of note in the\r\nAssembly’s work.\r\nWanton acts of terrorism continue to test our\r\nfortitude as members of the international community.\r\nWe must remain collectively resolute in our resolve to\r\nprevent and vigorously combat the proponents of that\r\nevil, and we must be innovative and versatile in our\r\npursuit of meaningful countermeasures and lasting\r\nsolutions.\r\nWe continue to strongly support the work of the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee and applaud the recent\r\nrevitalization of it and its work. Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) remains the basis of domestic\r\nmeasures implemented by my Government, including\r\nthe submission of country and, where appropriate,\r\nregional reports. It is useful to identify areas where\r\nfinancial and technical assistance is necessary to\r\nenable stronger compliance by all States in meeting\r\ntheir international obligations.\r\nAfter eight years of negotiations, Tonga’s\r\naccession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is in\r\nthe final stages. Bilateral market access agreements on\r\ngoods and services have been concluded with\r\nAustralia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, New\r\nZealand and Panama. Agreement with the United\r\nStates is outstanding, as it has requested that we accede\r\nto the Chemical Harmonization Agreement and the\r\nInformation Technology Agreement. Although this is\r\nan additional burden on us, we do understand that the\r\nUnited States is requesting the same commitments\r\nfrom every acceding country. The working group\r\nreport has been discussed at informal working parties\r\nand so gives rise to cautious optimism that we could\r\nconclude the process before the 2005 ministerial\r\nmeeting.\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nTonga needs the understanding and the support of\r\nall WTO members as we seek commitments\r\ncommensurate with the size of our economy and the\r\nstage of our development. To be sure, Tonga is not\r\nseeking greater market access, but desires security for\r\nits trade under a rule-based, multilateral trading\r\nsystem.\r\nTonga adheres strictly to the “one China” policy\r\nand recognizes that Taiwan is an inalienable part of\r\nChina. We welcome the shared principle of non-\r\ninterference in each other’s internal affairs and, as\r\nsuch, we consider that delicate and sensitive issues are\r\nbest dealt with in an across-the-Strait dialogue rather\r\nthan at international forums.\r\nWe welcome the expanding cooperation with\r\nChina and recognize that its huge market provides a\r\nrange of commercial, financial and trade possibilities\r\nfor us and, to that end, Tonga has adopted a “look east”\r\npolicy. To give effect to its interests in China, Tonga\r\nwill soon establish a diplomatic presence in Beijing to\r\nexplore those interests further.\r\nFor a decade now, we have exported our squash\r\nproduce to Japan and, more recently, we have been\r\nexporting specially cultivated seaweed to its markets. It\r\nis timely that we now explore further forms of\r\ncooperation with Japan in the field of fisheries, trade in\r\nother produce, financial and investment possibilities, as\r\nwell as education and training. To pursue those\r\ninterests, we are giving thought to a possible presence\r\nin Tokyo, although such an undertaking will be\r\ndetermined by available financial resources. The policy\r\ndoes not supplant the long-existing warm ties of\r\nfriendship we enjoy with Australia, New Zealand,\r\nFrance and the United States in the Pacific region, as\r\nthose friendly ties and a broad range of cooperation are\r\nfirmly rooted in our policy.\r\nMy Government has approved the fourth\r\ndeployment later in the year of police officers to the\r\nRegional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands\r\n(RAMSI). Also, approval has been given for the\r\ndeployment of the third contingent of defence\r\npersonnel for 2005, in concert with the agreed rotation\r\nformula under RAMSI.\r\nWe all look forward to the report of the High-\r\nLevel Panel. Judging from the makeup of the Panel and\r\nits formidable credentials, I should think the report and\r\nrecommendations will set the tone for the constructive\r\nengagement of the General Assembly.\r\nThe membership of the Security Council ought to\r\nbe expanded in both the permanent and non-permanent\r\ncategories in accordance with the realities of the day\r\nand perceptions of tomorrow. We believe that Japan\r\nshould be a permanent member and that there should\r\nbe a permanent seat for Africa and another for Latin\r\nAmerica.\r\nFive years ago, Tonga was admitted to\r\nmembership of the United Nations and has since\r\nactively participated in United Nations activities. It is\r\nnow giving favourable consideration to contributing to\r\nthe United Nations peacekeeping efforts. Consequently,\r\narrangements for our participation will be discussed\r\nfurther with the United Nations. The scope of our\r\ndeployment will be fashioned by our available\r\nmanpower and financial capacity.\r\nAlthough violence renders an enduring peace\r\nelusive, we continue to harbour hopes that a lasting\r\npeace can soon be concluded so that a Palestinian State\r\ncan be established, living side by side with the State of\r\nIsrael in internationally recognized borders and in\r\npeace and security.\r\nOur development has been made possible through\r\ndomestic resources and also through bilateral and\r\nmultilateral programmes of assistance, all of which\r\nhave been highly appreciated. Our major donor\r\npartners have been Australia, China, the European\r\nUnion — with some members providing additional\r\nassistance — Japan and New Zealand. The United\r\nStates provides assistance through its fisheries treaty\r\nwith the Pacific region and through other avenues. In\r\nrecent times, India, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia\r\nhave provided technical assistance. The United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the Global Environment\r\nFacility, the United Nations Environment Programme,\r\nthe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, the\r\nWorld Health Organization, the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the\r\nGlobal Fund, the World Bank and other financial\r\ninstitutions have provided various forms of assistance\r\nand technical expertise. Much of the technical\r\nassistance is channelled to combating diabetes and\r\ntuberculosis and preventing the spread of the\r\nHIV/AIDS. Other assistance has been directed at\r\nmeeting our Millennium Development Goals and to\r\nsmall community programmes and projects.\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Habib Ben Yahia, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Tunisia.\r\nMr. Ben Yahia (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): It is\r\nmy honour to read out the statement of Mr. Zine El\r\nAbidine Ben Ali, President of the Republic of Tunisia\r\nand Chairman of the sixteenth session of the Arab\r\nLeague Council, who had wanted to attend this meeting\r\nbut was detained by urgent commitments. The\r\nstatement reads as follows:\r\n“It is my distinct pleasure to convey to you,\r\nSir, and to your sisterly country, the Republic of\r\nGabon, my sincere congratulations on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at\r\nthis session. We wish you every success.\r\n“I also wish to express to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Julian Hunte, my great appreciation for his\r\nexcellent management of the proceedings of the\r\nprevious session.\r\n“I also take this opportunity to convey my\r\nthanks and appreciation to Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan for his commendable efforts to\r\npromote the role of the Organization and to fulfil\r\nits objectives of establishing security and peace\r\nthroughout the world.\r\n“Tunisia reiterates its commitment to the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations\r\nCharter and reaffirms its steady resolve to\r\ncontinue to contribute to all efforts to reform the\r\nOrganization and to develop its structures, the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council in\r\nparticular, so that it can remain the guarantor of\r\nthe application of international law and the\r\nconsolidation of justice, stability and\r\ndevelopment throughout the world.\r\n“Faced with rising tensions in many regions\r\nof the world, the widening development gap\r\nbetween countries and the serious challenges\r\nconfronting humankind, the international\r\ncommunity is called upon to reorganize\r\ninternational relations in accordance with a new\r\nvision based on cooperation, solidarity and\r\ncoexistence among all peoples. That is the\r\napproach which we sought to develop at the\r\nSummit Conference of the Arab League Council\r\nhosted by my country on 22 and 23 May, the\r\ncurrent session of which we have the honour of\r\nchairing.\r\n“In addition to the outcome of the Arab\r\nSummit, which represents a qualitative leap in the\r\nsystem of joint Arab action, the Arab States sent\r\na clear message to the international community.\r\nIn it, they reaffirmed their commitment to a just,\r\ncomprehensive and lasting peace as a strategic\r\noption in settling the Arab-Israeli conflict, based\r\non the Arab peace initiative, international\r\nlegality, the relevant resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil and the implementation of the road map.\r\nThe community of Arab States is determined to\r\nintensify its international activities to reactivate\r\nthe Arab peace initiative and to rally international\r\nsupport for it.\r\n“The serious escalation of the situation in\r\nthe occupied Palestinian territories and Israel’s\r\nstubborn imposition of a policy of fait accompli\r\nand unilateral measures require the international\r\ncommunity to act promptly to end the violence\r\nagainst and provide international protection for\r\nthe brotherly Palestinian people, to lift the siege\r\nimposed on its legitimate leadership, to cease the\r\nbuilding of settlements and to recognize the\r\nadvisory opinion of the International Court of\r\nJustice declaring the construction of the\r\nseparation wall illegal and calling for its\r\ndemolition. We believe that this would help to\r\ncreate conditions conducive to the establishment\r\nof a new era of confidence and understanding\r\namong all parties in the region in which the peace\r\nprocess can be resumed, the brotherly Palestinian\r\npeople can recover its legitimate rights and\r\nestablish its independent State, and Syria and\r\nLebanon can recover all of their occupied\r\nterritories.\r\n“While renewing its commitment to\r\nsupporting Iraq’s national unity and respect for its\r\nsovereignty and independence, the community of\r\nArab States stresses the need for the United\r\nNations to assume its vital role in that sisterly\r\ncountry. In the framework of the League of Arab\r\nStates, we will continue to support international\r\nefforts to demonstrate the solidarity of the Arab\r\nworld with the Iraqi people as our contribution to\r\nestablishing security and stability in that country\r\nand creating conditions conducive to its\r\nreconstruction.\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\n“The Arab countries also support the efforts\r\nmade at the United Nations and regional levels,\r\nand in particular by the African Union, to achieve\r\nunity, peace and development in the brotherly\r\nSudan. They also welcome the steps taken by the\r\nSudanese Government to honour its commitments\r\nunder the agreement to re-establish security and\r\nstability in Darfur, signed on 3 July 2004 with the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations.\r\n“The Arab Summit was an historic occasion\r\nat which the Arab States reaffirmed the fact that\r\nfinding just solutions to the fundamental\r\nproblems of the region that have adversely\r\naffected world peace and security would reinforce\r\nthe instincts of its peoples for security and peace,\r\nenhance the development process, update and\r\nconsolidate the principles of human rights and\r\ndemocracy, and promote the role and status of\r\nwomen in society, in conformity with each\r\ncountry’s cultural specificities, conditions and\r\nabilities, and based on its own free will and\r\ncommitment to shared humanitarian values.\r\n“Given the Arab States’ conviction of the\r\nimportance of the economic and social\r\ndimensions in strengthening the process of\r\nbuilding the pan-Arab system, our Arab Summit\r\nhas decided to establish a common strategy for\r\neconomic and social action and a plan to fight\r\npoverty and reinforce development efforts. In so\r\ndoing, it has demonstrated its resolve to\r\ncontribute to implementing the decisions of the\r\nMillennium Summit. The Arab States’ call for the\r\narticulation of a new concept of cooperation- and\r\nsolidarity-based partnership with all countries of\r\nthe world consecrates the path of dialogue among\r\ncultures and anchors the values of tolerance,\r\nunderstanding and complementarity among them.\r\n“Our States and peoples hope that the\r\ninternational community and the influential\r\nparties will step up their endeavours to settle the\r\npending issues in the region, support the efforts\r\nof countries to upgrade their economies, and\r\npromote their development and social\r\nprogrammes in the framework of cooperation and\r\ncoordination between the United Nations and the\r\nLeague of Arab States.\r\n“Tunisia is eager to contribute to the\r\npromotion of joint Arab action and seeks to give\r\nnew impetus to regional cooperation. In that\r\ncontext, we and our brother leaders of the\r\nMaghreb States are seeking to reactivate the\r\nMaghreb Union, which is an irreversible strategic\r\nchoice and a legitimate aspiration, shared by all\r\nthe peoples of the region, to greater\r\ncomplementarity and solidarity. Our country is\r\nalso eager to continue contributing to building the\r\nstructures of the African Union, strengthening the\r\nfoundations of security and stability in Africa,\r\nand establishing economic and social cooperation\r\namong African countries. That will effectively\r\nhelp our countries to achieve integration in the\r\nmarch towards prosperity and progress and to\r\ncreate genuine partnerships with regional\r\ngroupings throughout the world.\r\n“At the Mediterranean level, the ‘five plus\r\nfive’ summit involving the Maghreb countries\r\nand European countries of the southern\r\nMediterranean, held in Tunis in December 2003,\r\nhas made a fresh start for cooperation and\r\nsolidarity-based partnership among them in the\r\ncontext of establishing security and stability and\r\nof achieving economic complementarity, cultural\r\nand social communication, and constructive\r\npolitical dialogue. Serving as coordinator of the\r\ncommunity of Arab States within the Euro-\r\nMediterranean process, Tunisia strives to inject\r\nmore efficiency and vitality into the process so as\r\nto consolidate the foundations of security,\r\nstability and development within the Euro-\r\nMediterranean area.\r\n“The World Solidarity Fund for poverty\r\neradication, created on the basis of a Tunisian\r\nproposal of 1999 and adopted by the General\r\nAssembly on 20 December 2002, reflects\r\nTunisia’s ongoing commitment to anchoring the\r\nprinciples of justice, solidarity and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in the world, based on our\r\nsuccessful pioneering national experience in that\r\nfield over many years. We believe that the Fund,\r\nwhich has become a United Nations mechanism,\r\nrequires all members of the international\r\ncommunity, including Governments, civil society\r\nand private sectors, to pool their efforts and\r\nswiftly mobilize the financial resources necessary\r\nto activate it.\r\n“In that context, we suggest the\r\nproclamation of 20 December of each year as the\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nworld day for the fight against poverty, in\r\ncommemoration of the date of the General\r\nAssembly’s adoption of the resolution\r\nestablishing the Fund and in order to enshrine the\r\nconcept of solidarity as a permanent universal\r\nvalue in international relations. We also welcome\r\nany initiative in support of the activation of the\r\nFund. In that regard, we take special note of the\r\ninitiative of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva\r\nof the Federal Republic of Brazil.\r\n“Tunisia’s sustained efforts to provide\r\noptimum conditions for the hosting of the second\r\nphase of the World Summit on the Information\r\nSociety on 16 to 18 November 2005 are also\r\nbeing undertaken in that context. We called for\r\nthe convening of such a summit in 1998, based on\r\nour conviction that, today more than ever before,\r\nour world needs to establish a solidarity-based\r\ndigital partnership, allowing all countries to be\r\nintegrated into the international information\r\nsociety. In that way, we hope to achieve a more\r\njust and balanced approach as a strong\r\ndevelopment and cultural bridge between the\r\ncountries of the world, in fulfilment of the goals\r\nand principles of the Millennium Summit.\r\n“I should like to take this opportunity to\r\nreiterate my earlier invitation to heads of State\r\nand Government, to representatives of civil\r\nsociety and the private sector and to other\r\ninternational organizations, extended at the first\r\nphase of the World Summit on the Information\r\nSociety held in Geneva in December 2003, to\r\nparticipate actively in the Tunis Summit in order\r\nto ensure its success and to achieve the prosperity\r\nand well-being of all humankind.\r\n“The General Assembly’s adoption of the\r\nTunisian proposal to proclaim 2005 the\r\nInternational Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation was a recognition of the importance of\r\nthose two activities in strengthening the bonds of\r\nfriendship, cooperation and rapprochement\r\namong peoples and in further disseminating peace\r\nand development throughout the world. We are\r\nconvinced that all countries recognize the noble\r\ndimensions of the proclamation and will spare no\r\neffort to formalize it within their national\r\nprogrammers next year.\r\n“The increasing danger of the phenomenon\r\nof terrorism in our times requires greater\r\ninternational coordination in resisting that\r\nscourge and averting its threats by treating its\r\nroot causes, finding just solutions to several\r\noutstanding international problems, and curbing\r\npoverty, exclusion and marginalization in the\r\nworld. Tunisia is convinced that international\r\nrelations can prosper and develop only in a\r\nclimate of dialogue, entente and solidarity,\r\neschewing fanaticism, extremism and the dangers\r\nof discord and warfare and in a context of justice,\r\nmutual respect and equitable cooperation among\r\nindividuals, groups and peoples. Thus, security,\r\npeace and stability may prevail throughout the\r\nworld and humankind may look to the future with\r\nthe utmost confidence, optimism and ambition.”\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Lyonpo Khandu\r\nWangchuk, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nKingdom of Bhutan.\r\nMr. Wangchuk (Bhutan): On behalf of the\r\ndelegation of Bhutan, allow me to congratulate you,\r\nSir, on your election to your important post. I assure\r\nyou of my delegation’s support and cooperation as you\r\nguide the work of this important body for the year. We\r\nare confident that, with your vast experience and able\r\nleadership, our deliberations will be productive. May I\r\ncommend Mr. Julian R. Hunte for his stewardship and\r\ncontribution to the work of the fifty-eighth session of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nThe task before the fifty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is daunting, given the array of\r\nissues and challenges facing the international\r\ncommunity. Among them is the issue of reform of the\r\nUnited Nations. In that regard, the General Assembly’s\r\nresolutions on the revitalization of its work and the\r\nreform initiatives in other organs and agencies are\r\ntimely and welcome, as they will serve to ensure the\r\nUnited Nations continued relevance and effectiveness\r\nin a rapidly changing world. My delegation looks\r\nforward to the recommendations of the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change set up by the\r\nSecretary-General to examine the current challenges to\r\npeace and security.\r\nMuch of the ongoing debate on United Nations\r\nreforms has justifiably centred on the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council as the organ charged with the\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In a\r\nworld torn by old and new conflicts, the Security\r\nCouncil must evolve in order to remain effective and to\r\nenjoy the confidence of all member States. Its\r\ncomposition must change to reflect the wider\r\nmembership of the United Nations and the new\r\ngeopolitical and economic realities of the present-day\r\nworld. Bhutan supports the call for an expanded\r\nSecurity Council through increased membership of\r\nboth the permanent and non-permanent categories.\r\nAmong others, Bhutan strongly believes that India and\r\nJapan, in view of the important roles they play in\r\ninternational affairs, are pre-eminently qualified for\r\npermanent membership in an expanded Council.\r\nThe toll of innocent human beings falling prey to\r\nterrorism continues to mount by the day. Gruesome\r\nacts of terrorism in different regions of the world,\r\nincluding the recent brutal killing of schoolchildren in\r\nBeslan and the cold-blooded murder of Nepalese and\r\nother innocent people in Iraq and elsewhere, have\r\nraised the level of horror to new heights. We strongly\r\ncondemn those senseless killings. Even my country has\r\nnot been spared the scourge. Having exhausted all\r\npeaceful means to prevail upon the heavily armed\r\nforeign militant groups from north-eastern India to\r\nleave our territory, the Royal Government was\r\ncompelled to use force to remove them in mid-\r\nDecember 2003. Most recently, two people were killed\r\nand 27 injured by a bomb blast in a marketplace in a\r\nborder town in southern Bhutan.\r\nThere is an urgent need to take concerted action\r\nto fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\r\nEvery nation gathered here, by having signed the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, ascribes to the universal\r\ncode that the methods which terrorists employ to\r\nachieve their aims, especially the targeting and killing\r\nof innocent civilians, cannot be justified.\r\nConflicts and crisis situations continue to disrupt\r\nthe political stability, security and socio-economic\r\nwell-being of millions around the world. Many such\r\nconflicts are fuelled by conditions of poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment. Recognizing that interrelationship,\r\nthe international community has taken numerous\r\ninitiatives in recent years. Several major conferences\r\nhave been convened, including the Millennium\r\nSummit, that have provided a comprehensive set of\r\ntime-bound targets to be achieved in order to secure a\r\nmore peaceful, prosperous and just world.\r\nHowever, those targets remain distant for many\r\nand the gap between the rich and the poor is getting\r\nwider among and within nations. The Global\r\nMonitoring Report 2004 of the World Bank and the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund indicates that economic\r\ngrowth in many developing countries remains below\r\nthe level considered necessary to reach the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. If the Goals are to be achieved by\r\nthe target date, the report states, all parties urgently\r\nneed to do much more. The Monterrey Consensus\r\nreinforced the objectives of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and emphasized the roles of all\r\nparties involved in the process of financing for\r\ndevelopment. While developing countries have to\r\naccelerate reforms, developed countries must provide\r\nmore aid, foreign direct investment, debt relief and\r\nmore open access to their markets.\r\nIt is against that background that my delegation\r\nwelcomes the 2005 high-level plenary meeting to\r\nreview the integrated follow-up and implementation of\r\nthe outcomes of the United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits. My delegation hopes that the review will lead\r\nto further concrete action by all stakeholders.\r\nFurthermore, as a landlocked, least developed country,\r\nmy delegation hopes to see the issues and challenges\r\nidentified in the Almaty and Brussels Programmes of\r\nAction receive the highest priority during the review.\r\nMay I mention that the Royal Government of\r\nBhutan, under the leadership of His Majesty the King\r\nand guided by the development philosophy of gross\r\nnational happiness, has been making concerted efforts\r\nto ensure the all-round development of the country and\r\nto realize the agreed goals of the various international\r\nconferences, in particular the Millennium Summit. I\r\nam pleased to report that, with the continued support of\r\nour development partners, Bhutan is hopeful of\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.\r\nIn that regard, I take this opportunity to express the\r\ndeep appreciation of the Royal Government and people\r\nof Bhutan to the United Nations and other donors for\r\ntheir contributions to the development of my country.\r\nAs I conclude my statement, I would like to pay\r\ntribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\r\nhis strong leadership and relentless efforts to advance\r\nthe cause of peace, development and security. We will\r\ncontinue to benefit from his vision and leadership for\r\nthe next two years. As he leaves his post at the end of\r\n2006, our work to find a suitable replacement to lead\r\nthe United Nations has to begin soon and in earnest.\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nMy delegation believes that, in keeping with the\r\nprinciple of equitable geographical representation, and\r\nin consideration of Asia’s being the most populous\r\ncontinent with the largest regional grouping of 55\r\nmembers in the United Nations, a Secretary-General\r\nfrom Asia would be both timely and appropriate.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Biossey Kokou Tozoun,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the\r\nTogolese Republic.\r\nMr. Tozoun (Togo) (spoke in French): In\r\nexpressing to you, Sir, our great pride at seeing an\r\neminent representative of the Group of African States\r\npreside over the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession, I wish to offer you, on behalf of\r\nMr. Gnassingbé Eyadema, President of the Togolese\r\nRepublic, and of the Government and the people of\r\nTogo, which it is my great honour to represent, our\r\nsincere wishes for your success in fulfilling your\r\nmandate.\r\nWe also congratulate Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan on his dynamic and unequivocal work at the\r\nhead of our Organization.\r\nThe present session of the General Assembly is\r\nbeing held at a time when international peace and\r\nsecurity continue to be seriously threatened, requiring\r\nour common Organization fully to shoulder its role and\r\nmission with even greater determination and bolder\r\ninitiatives. Indeed, we are living in a world of\r\nprecarious balances arising from our collective\r\ninability to establish genuine peace and shared well-\r\nbeing in the framework of international legitimacy.\r\nIn Africa, the legitimate aspirations of people to\r\nlasting peace, in particular in those countries and\r\nregions where that peace is being sorely tested, have\r\nyet to be achieved.\r\nIn Côte d’Ivoire, after numerous short-lived\r\nhopes have been dashed, the implementation of the\r\nAccra III Agreement remains today the sole hope for\r\nthe restoration of peace and stability in that country.\r\nThe Togolese Head of State, who from the very\r\nbeginning of the crisis committed himself to the path of\r\ndialogue and reconciliation, will continue to be\r\ninvolved in the peaceful settlement of that fratricidal\r\nconflict.\r\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nrecently arisen obstacles to the peace process, which is\r\nintended to lead to the holding in 2005 of elections for\r\nthe creation of new institutions, have required the\r\ninternational community to spare no effort in\r\nmaintaining the gains won through the costly\r\ndeployment of the United Nations Mission in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and in\r\nlaunching, whenever necessary, such operations as\r\nArtemis to nip in the bud any impulse towards a\r\nresumption of combat wherever it may arise. The\r\nGovernment of Togo therefore unreservedly supports\r\nthe Secretary-General’s proposal significantly to\r\nincrease the number of MONUC personnel.\r\nIt is to be hoped that the international conference\r\non peace, security and development in the Great Lakes\r\nregion, to be held in November, will be the appropriate\r\nframework for finding lasting solutions to the problems\r\nof insecurity and instability that continue to weaken\r\nrelationships among States of the region and to\r\njeopardize the emergence of a climate of good-\r\nneighbourliness and mutual understanding.\r\nIn the Sudan, regarding the tragedy unfolding in\r\nDarfur, the international community must urgently\r\nassist the Government of that country and the Sudan\r\nPeople’s Liberation Army/Movement to consolidate the\r\npeace process through the signing of the\r\ncomprehensive peace agreement. In that regard, the\r\ninternational community must provide consistent\r\nsupport to the African Union’s peace operation.\r\nIn Burundi, Liberia and Somalia in particular, the\r\noutburst of solidarity and renewed interest which the\r\ninternational community continues to show in the\r\nrestoration of peace and the recovery of those\r\ncountries, battered by long years of war, should be\r\naccompanied by more adequate financial and logistical\r\nassistance. Togo, for its part, will continue to\r\ncontribute to conflict and crisis resolution in Africa\r\nand to support the various United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations by supplying military\r\ncontingents or observers, as it is currently doing in\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, Burundi, Liberia and Haiti.\r\nThe prevailing situations in the world,\r\nparticularly in Iraq and the Middle East, are a source of\r\nmajor concern. In Iraq, the restoration of full\r\nsovereignty to the Iraqi people and the recognition that\r\nthe United Nations has an important role to play in\r\nrebuilding the country should give every element of\r\nIraqi society the opportunity to work with resolve to\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nbuild a stable and prosperous country free of all\r\nviolence.\r\nIn the Middle East, the ongoing escalation of\r\nviolence between the State of Israel and the Palestinian\r\nState may definitively compromise the continuation of\r\nthe peace process and the implementation of the\r\nvarious agreements that have been signed. In that\r\nrespect, the international community and the Quartet\r\nmust strive to persuade the two protagonists to avoid\r\nunilateral action and to return to the negotiating table\r\non the basis of the road map and the relevant\r\nresolutions of the Security Council.\r\nFurthermore, we wish to emphasize, again with\r\nrespect to crisis issues, that post-conflict situations\r\nclearly demonstrate the importance of providing\r\nadequate financing, not only for humanitarian\r\nassistance but also for other vital programmes to\r\npromote peace and sustainable development. There is\r\nthus a need for the financing of disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and reintegration programmes for ex-\r\ncombatants and other long-term instruments for\r\nensuring peace — such as education, health care and\r\njob creation for young people — to be made a priority\r\nof post-conflict peace-building.\r\nIn the same context, the troubling financial\r\nsituation of the three Regional Centres for peace and\r\ndisarmament call for more attention from the Assembly\r\nif they are to enjoy the financial resources necessary to\r\nfulfil their mandates harmoniously. In that regard, and\r\non the basis of the relevant Secretary-General’s reports,\r\nthe delegation of Togo firmly believes that it is high\r\ntime for the General Assembly seriously to review the\r\nfinancing of the Regional Centres in order to provide\r\nthem with adequate financial resources under the\r\nOrganization’s regular budget. In so doing, the General\r\nAssembly would demonstrate its genuine support for\r\nthe Organization’s goals in the area of arms control and\r\ndisarmament and its appreciation of the active role\r\nplayed to date by the Centres. For its part, my country,\r\nwhich hosts the United Nations Regional Centre for\r\nPeace and Disarmament in Africa, will do its utmost to\r\nensure the Centre’s continuity and long-term viability.\r\nTerrorism is the other major danger of our times\r\nbecause it continues seriously to threaten our States\r\nand is thus a scourge in the face of which failure to act\r\neffectively means giving way to the forces of evil.\r\nHaving endured terrorism in the past, Togo once again\r\ncondemns the heinous terrorist attacks perpetrated\r\nrecently around the world and keenly hopes that more\r\ndecisive action will be undertaken to eradicate that\r\ndisease of the human conscience.\r\nFrom that perspective, while it is up to each State\r\nto take the measures necessary to strengthen security\r\nwithin its own borders, we must strive above all to\r\nenhance regional and international cooperation among\r\nStates and to ensure that the poor States can enjoy\r\nadequate assistance in the implementation of effective\r\nnational mechanisms to combat terrorism.\r\nEconomic and social development is a corollary\r\nof peace and security. We all recall that, at the dawn of\r\nthe twenty-first century, the Millennium Summit was\r\nconvened here in this very Hall. Following the Summit,\r\nat which the problems of poverty and development\r\nwere debated, the heads of State and Government\r\nadopted the Millennium Declaration, an unprecedented\r\naffirmation of international solidarity in which the rich\r\nand poor countries together undertook firm\r\ncommitments whereby they forcefully reaffirmed their\r\nwill to reduce by half, by the year 2015, the proportion\r\nof the world’s population touched by poverty. World\r\nleaders voiced the hope at that time that other major\r\nmeetings also held early in the new millennium would\r\nserve as a framework for the birth of genuine\r\npartnership between the countries of the North and\r\nthose of the South.\r\nSeveral years later, however, we note with regret\r\nthat the Millennium Development Goals have been\r\nhard to achieve. Indeed, the necessary resources to\r\nfinance sustainable development and to combat poverty\r\nand hunger in the developing countries have not been\r\nmobilized and, contrary to expectations, only a small\r\nnumber of developing countries have been able to\r\nmake progress in the elimination of poverty.\r\nThe critical economic situation in Africa requires\r\na collective awakening and introspection. What has\r\nhappened to our myriad commitments? What has\r\nhappened to our many promises?\r\nRegarding the rules of international trade, which\r\nremain unfavourable to the poor countries; regarding\r\nthe long-awaited debt relief; regarding the fact that the\r\ngoal of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product for\r\nofficial development assistance has been met by only a\r\nsmall fraction of donor countries, we may well ask\r\nourselves what happened to the solidarity so loudly\r\nproclaimed at the Millennium Summit.\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nLast year’s failure of the World Trade\r\nOrganization trade negotiations in Cancún — designed\r\nto settle the critical issues of eliminating agricultural\r\nsubsidies and providing access to the markets of the\r\nindustrialized world for the products of the countries of\r\nthe South — highlighted yet again the North-South\r\ndivision and evoked real fears for the future of the\r\nmultilateral trade system.\r\nOn the basis of those questions and concerns, the\r\ndelegation of Togo reaffirms the need for all\r\ninternational partners to reflect in deeds the political\r\nwill they proclaimed at the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development and the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development so as to give new impetus to\r\nefforts to increase official development assistance, to\r\nprovide debt relief and equitable access to markets, to\r\nprotect the environment, and to combat malaria,\r\nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases.\r\n2005 will be a crucial year for our Organization.\r\nIndeed, in 2005, we shall engage in in-depth\r\nconsideration of the implementation of the Monterrey\r\nConsensus. In 2005, we shall hold a high-level debate\r\non the implementation of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS. In that regard, we need to\r\nbear in mind that the twenty-sixth special session of\r\nthe General Assembly set specific goals to be met for\r\n2003 and 2005 towards the eradication of HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic.\r\nAbove all, 2005 will be the year of the high-level\r\nplenary meeting to engage in a comprehensive review\r\nof progress made in the implementation of all of the\r\ncommitments undertaken in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and at the major United Nations\r\nconferences and summit meetings in the economic and\r\nsocial fields.\r\nWe therefore await those meetings with interest.\r\nThey will give us the opportunity to reaffirm our\r\npolitical commitment to building a world of greater\r\nsolidarity and prosperity in order to give hope once\r\nmore to that significant segment of the world’s\r\npopulation that lives on less than $1 a day, suffers from\r\nhunger and malnutrition and has no access to drinking\r\nwater.\r\nThe peace and economic and social development\r\nthat we desire for our countries cannot be achieved\r\nwithout the effective participation of peoples in\r\nmanaging public affairs. Democracy in Togo, based on\r\na multi-party system and the rule of law, has become a\r\nvibrant reality, inter alia, through the adoption of\r\nimportant legislative and administrative texts and the\r\nestablishment of virtually every institution provided for\r\nby the Constitution. With faith and determination, the\r\nGovernment of Togo, under the impetus of the Head of\r\nState, is striving to build a genuinely democratic\r\nsociety that also takes the sociological realities of our\r\ncountry into account.\r\nIn order to complete its task, the Government has\r\ndeclared its openness to any constructive contribution\r\nfrom the national political class and civilian society, as\r\nwell as from our development partners. In that context,\r\non 14 April it opened consultations with the European\r\nUnion, in conformity with article 96 of the Cotonou\r\nAgreement of partnership linking that organization to\r\nthe African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. At\r\nthe outset of the consultations, the Government\r\nendorsed a number of commitments whose\r\nimplementation is currently near completion and\r\nshould ultimately lead to a better foundation of\r\ndemocratic culture and the consolidation of the rule of\r\nlaw.\r\nThe Government intends to strive to bring the\r\nconsultations to a successful conclusion, the ultimate\r\nobjective of which is the resumption of cooperation\r\nbetween the European Union and Togo. The political\r\nzeal of the Togolese authorities — reflected in the\r\nimplementation of an ongoing inclusive national\r\ndialogue; the adoption of a press and communications\r\ncode; the drafting of an improved electoral code and a\r\nfinancing law for political parties; and the decision\r\ntaken by the Head of State on 11 August to release\r\nmore than 500 common-law prisoners — is a guarantee\r\nof the Government’s resolve to create favourable\r\nconditions for the citizens of Togo to enjoy their\r\nfundamental rights, and in particular their political and\r\neconomic rights.\r\nWe take this opportunity to launch an urgent\r\nappeal to all our development partners to assist the\r\nGovernment of Togo in the process of strengthening\r\nand consolidating democracy and the rule of law.\r\nI cannot conclude without returning to the\r\nrecurrent issue of United Nations reform. The\r\nGovernment of Togo wishes to propose that bold\r\ndecisions be taken at this session to accelerate the\r\nprocess of reform of the system, and of the Security\r\nCouncil in particular, so that the issue can be more than\r\na mirage. Indeed, the numerous challenges confronting\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\ntoday’s world require a strengthened and more\r\neffective Security Council, which only a more\r\nrepresentative and more democratic membership can\r\nensure. In that respect, Africa deserves an appropriate\r\nplace within that vital United Nations body.\r\nThe Security Council must therefore be enlarged\r\nin both the permanent and non-permanent memberships\r\nso as to meet the democratic requirements of our times\r\nand to allow various groups of countries to provide\r\ntheir valuable assistance in achieving the objectives of\r\nour Organization, which include peace and security,\r\nworking for freedom and democracy, guaranteeing\r\nglobal prosperity through free and equitable\r\ninternational trade, preserving a healthy environment\r\nand creating stable international relations based on\r\ndialogue. If we truly seek to achieve all this, we must\r\ngive our common Organization the resources\r\ncommensurate with doing so.\r\nMay this session serve to strengthen cooperation\r\namong our States and peoples and assist us in\r\nconsolidating peace and in achieving security and\r\nlasting development for all.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency The Honourable Timothy\r\nHarris, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Education of\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nMr. Harris (Saint Kitts and Nevis): I am pleased\r\nto welcome and congratulate you, Sir, and the Republic\r\nof Gabon through you, for allowing us to share your\r\nexperience and expertise on the occasion of the fifty-\r\nninth session of the General Assembly. I must convey\r\nto Mr. Julian Hunte, Foreign Minister of Saint Lucia,\r\nmy country’s gratitude for his hard work and\r\nmemorable contribution to this Organization over the\r\npast year.\r\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis\r\nreaffirms its strong support for and commitment to the\r\npraiseworthy, attainable Millennium Development\r\nGoals. Their stated objectives are fundamental and\r\nhave long been incorporated into my country’s national\r\nhuman development agenda.\r\nFor decades, before the Millennium Development\r\nGoals were agreed upon, Saint Kitts and Nevis had\r\ninstituted compulsory primary and secondary\r\neducation, which may explain our achievement of a\r\nliteracy rate of 97.8 per cent. We in the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) are very proud of our\r\nachievements in the field of education. We owe much\r\nof that success to our coherent system of education and\r\nalso to the University of the West Indies, whose\r\nacademic credentials continue to amaze and evolve to\r\nmeet the needs of our people. We invite fellow United\r\nNations Member States to explore that resource in the\r\nCaribbean so their citizens can pursue higher education\r\nin that great institution of learning and in the most\r\npeaceful and pristine of multicultural settings.\r\nIt is easy to become excited when I speak of our\r\nefforts in addressing the issue of women in\r\ndevelopment, but we will not let down our guard. In\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, we have recognized and\r\nbenefited from gender equality and the empowerment\r\nof women. It may be recalled that Saint Kitts and Nevis\r\nwas among the first in this hemisphere to create a\r\nMinistry Of Women’s Affairs.\r\nEqually important to the Government of Saint\r\nKitts and Nevis is winning the war against poverty. We\r\nremain steadfast in our efforts to eliminate poverty,\r\nwhich is not simply a noble ideal. It is a practical,\r\nachievable objective and, by God, it is the right thing\r\nto do. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, in the last seven years,\r\nwe have endured social and economic dislocations in\r\nthe wake of several catastrophic natural disasters, 9/11\r\nand the downturns in the global economy. Nonetheless,\r\nwith due care and attention to prudent fiscal and\r\nmonetary management, we are investing in the socio-\r\neconomic development of our country and continue to\r\nplace people first in all that we do.\r\nMy Government has invested greatly in our\r\nnational health system, supported by the construction\r\nof a modern hospital and the professional development\r\nof health care workers. We believe that this will\r\nimprove the quality of and access to health care for\r\nnationals and visitors alike. Our continued efforts to\r\nbuild a healthy nation are consistent with our resolve to\r\nreduce child mortality and improve maternal health.\r\nOur capital project investments have improved\r\nthe existing distribution networks to satisfy demand\r\nand to better extend service coverage for potable water\r\nthroughout the islands of Saint Kitts and Nevis. Our\r\nroad improvement and maintenance programmes have\r\nresurfaced miles of road and improved drainage\r\nthroughout the twin island Federation. The\r\nimprovement of the tourism product has generated\r\nseveral new jobs consistent with my Government’s\r\npeople-focused agenda. It has allowed us to depend\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nless on an agriculture-based economy, which continues\r\nto suffer from Government subsidies offered to farmers\r\nin large countries. Such subsidies make it more\r\ndifficult for small economies like mine to compete.\r\nOur capacity to compete is further undermined by the\r\nrecent unilateral decision of the European Union to\r\nreduce the price of sugar by more than 30 per cent.\r\nDespite these challenges, we continue to press on,\r\nmindful of the need to preserve the environment. Saint\r\nKitts and Nevis are two beautiful islands faced with the\r\ngeographic reality of being located in the hurricane\r\ncorridor. We witness the cost of beach and coastal\r\nerosion resulting from rising sea levels and hurricanes.\r\nIntegrating environmentally sustainable policies into\r\nour development agenda has been a real challenge.\r\nHowever, our determination to protect and preserve the\r\nislands’ patrimony by adopting environmentally\r\nfriendly programmes is imperative.\r\nAt this juncture, I need to emphasize the current\r\nsituation facing small island developing States. All\r\nsmall island developing States lack the economy of\r\nscale to overcome their vulnerabilities on their own.\r\nWe are extremely vulnerable unless we form\r\ngeographical partnerships, as CARICOM has done.\r\nThat, however, does not exempt us from the\r\nvulnerabilities that we face every day. Geographical\r\npartnership does allow for a quick response in the\r\nevent of adversity.\r\nMy delegation urges the international community\r\nto accept the concept of vulnerability, leading to a\r\nvulnerability index that can be appropriately applied to\r\nsmall island developing States. Grenada’s devastation\r\nwithin three hours of being struck by hurricane Ivan\r\ndramatizes for us how a generation of development\r\nprogress can be wiped out in a small vulnerable nation.\r\nThere is a pressing need for a global development fund\r\nto assist small island developing States in recovery\r\nfollowing national disasters.\r\nPragmatic and productive partnerships are the\r\nmost effective vehicle available to the international\r\ncommunity to tackle the multitude of problems we\r\nface. We speak of important issues, such as democracy,\r\nglobalization, terrorism, poverty eradication, human\r\ndevelopment and the spread of infectious disease, as if\r\nthey were completely disconnected. The goal of human\r\ndevelopment on any scale is best achieved by\r\nrecognizing the interconnectedness of our lives, our\r\neconomies and our policies. That imposes an obligation\r\nto develop common strategies, partnerships and policy\r\napproaches that accept and address the intrinsic\r\nlinkages among the problems facing nation States.\r\nI submit that the Pan-Caribbean Partnership\r\nAgainst HIV/AIDS is the first and only regional\r\nmechanism created to deal with the pandemic in a\r\nmultinational way. Our regional cooperation has led to\r\nreductions in the cost of antiretroviral drugs from\r\n$20,000 per person per year to $200 per patient per\r\nyear. We have also been successful in negotiating\r\nreduced prices for other important pharmaceutical\r\ndrugs. That experience speaks to the value of\r\npartnership and cooperation. We believe that networks\r\nare the most effective means of problem solving. We\r\npraise the efforts of the Global Fund and the United\r\nNations for their work in mobilizing additional\r\nresources to treat people living with HIV/AIDS and to\r\nfight the spread of the disease.\r\nThe idea of fighting HIV/AIDS only through\r\nfaith simplifies the human condition and suggests a\r\nmisunderstanding of the nature and scope of the\r\ndisease. My Government insists that a pragmatic policy\r\napproach to fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS is as\r\nfundamental to good governance as is the holding of\r\nfree and fair elections. Good governance means\r\nGovernments listening to and caring for their citizens.\r\nGood governance implies that leaders must lead with\r\nmoral courage and take bold and sometimes\r\ncontroversial steps in the public interests.\r\nGood governance means placing the United\r\nNations at the centre of our international interaction, in\r\naccordance with and in full respect for the Charter.\r\nGood governance requires respect for every country’s\r\nright to choose its own course, consistent with its own\r\nlaws and the will of its people. Good governance is not\r\nsimply about whether we ostracize a country if its\r\npolicies run counter to our national agenda. It should\r\nbe about creating better understanding, cooperation and\r\npartnership and building bridges of friendship. Good\r\ngovernance suggests to us in Saint Kitts and Nevis that\r\nGovernments abide by and commit themselves to\r\ninternationally recognized standards and principles and\r\ndo not discard them when it becomes expedient. Good\r\ngovernance entails holding everyone to the same\r\nstandard and not raising the bar for some countries and\r\nlowering it for others.\r\nGood governance should propel us to recognize\r\nthe fact that nearly 23 million people in the Republic of\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nChina on Taiwan are essentially in a diplomatic black\r\nhole, alienated from our international discourse. Good\r\ngovernance requires all peace-loving nations to urge\r\nboth sides of the Taiwan Straits not only to commit to,\r\nbut also to engage in constructive dialogue and\r\npreventive diplomacy. Good governance behooves us\r\nto support the hard work of the leaders and people of\r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan to comply with and\r\nwork within the framework of international law. Good\r\ngovernance says to us in Saint Kitts and Nevis that a\r\npeople committed to the rule of law and democracy and\r\nwilling to invest in human development at home and\r\nabroad should never be excluded from the fraternity of\r\nnations.\r\nIn addition, CARICOM takes great pride in our\r\nparliamentary system of Government and our solid\r\ndemocracies from a centuries-old tradition. Our history\r\nteaches us that good governance and human\r\ndevelopment are indivisible. Where representative\r\ndemocracy, democratic institution-building, freedom of\r\nexpression and the protection of human rights have not\r\nflourished, human development has suffered. Where\r\nGovernments have failed to respect the will of the\r\npeople, human development has faltered. Although\r\nCARICOM faces great limitations and challenges\r\nowing to the absence of natural and financial resources,\r\nwe have managed to build credible democratic\r\ninstitutions, a reliable judicial system and lasting\r\ndemocracies in which the transition from incumbent\r\nGovernments to opposition parties passes without\r\nincident. We are ready to share these experiences with\r\nthe rest of the world.\r\nIn conclusion, for decades countries and\r\nacademics have questioned the viability of small\r\nStates. History, though, has witnessed not only our\r\nviability, but also that we are a dependable beacon of\r\nhope for others, be they large or small. We live in an\r\ninterconnected world where national political decisions\r\nin one corner of the world have devastating\r\nconsequences thousands of miles away.\r\nWe must therefore of necessity become our\r\nbrothers’ keepers. In that vein, we call on Member\r\nStates to lend their support to the international meeting\r\nto review the Barbados Programme of Action for the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, scheduled to be held in Mauritius in January\r\n2005.\r\nFinally, I would like to repeat my call that\r\npartnership must trump nationalism and that\r\nmultilateralism must transcend unilateralism.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Moctar Ouane, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of the\r\nRepublic of Mali.\r\nMr. Ouane (Mali) (spoke in French): Allow me\r\nat the outset warmly to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-ninth session and to assure you and the other\r\nmembers of the Bureau, whom I also congratulate, of\r\nthe full support of the delegation of Mali as you carry\r\nout your mission.\r\nI also wish to pay tribute to the dedication of\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and to thank him for his\r\ntireless efforts in the service of the United Nations.\r\nSix days ago, Mali commemorated in its own way\r\nthe forty-fourth anniversary of its independence. From\r\nthis high rostrum, the most symbolic of all, I wish to\r\nrecall the efforts of my country to build, under the\r\nleadership of Mr. Amadou Toumani Touré, President of\r\nthe Republic and Head of State, a democratic, stable\r\nand prosperous Mali asserting its place in the concert\r\nof nations.\r\nFor several weeks now, our country and others of\r\nthe North and West African regions, have been stricken\r\nby an unprecedented locust infestation. As President\r\nAmadou Toumani Touré stressed in his message to the\r\nnation on 22 September, the magnitude and speed of\r\nthe infestation have surpassed the most pessimistic\r\nprojections. The catastrophic effects of that insect\r\nplague on the upcoming harvest and on our vegetation\r\nare a true threat to the livelihood of the millions of men\r\nand women thus exposed to famine.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Mali is\r\nactively working to suppress the scourge, above all\r\nthrough a national mobilization that has brought teams,\r\nbrigades and village communities to work in the field,\r\nand with the support of the international community,\r\nand in particular to brotherly African countries. I\r\nreiterate here my country’s gratitude to them all. I also\r\nwish firmly to say, however, that, faced with the insect\r\nplague and in order to ensure the food security of\r\ninfested countries, including Mali, we have a shared\r\nresponsibility to launch and strengthen short-, medium-\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nand long-term international mobilization. We must act,\r\nact quickly and act effectively.\r\nQuestions related to international peace and\r\nsecurity continue to be a source of concern to us. In the\r\npast year we have seen crises and conflicts multiply\r\nthroughout the world. I would like, in particular, to\r\nrecall the situation in West Africa and Mali’s initiatives\r\nto contribute to the settlement of the crisis in Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, whose subregional repercussions are\r\nconsiderable and fraught with consequences for peace\r\nand stability in West Africa.\r\nIn this regard, the so-called Bamako II meeting\r\nmade it possible to establish the conditions for the\r\nsuccess of the Accra III high-level meeting. I\r\nforcefully echo the assertion of President Amadou\r\nToumani Touré that Mali will continue to support\r\npeace and reconciliation in Côte d’Ivoire: peace for the\r\npeople of Côte d’Ivoire, and peace for all of the\r\nforeigners who live in that brotherly neighbouring\r\ncountry.\r\nHere I would mention Mali’s participation in the\r\npeacekeeping missions of the United Nations, the\r\nAfrican Union and the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) in Liberia, Sierra Leone, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Haiti.\r\nFurthermore, Mali’s commitment to international\r\npeace and security is at the root of our country’s action\r\nto make the Sahelo-Saharan area a focal point of\r\ndevelopment and stability. This was especially evident\r\nduring the Malian presidency of the Community of\r\nSahelo-Saharan States.\r\nMali is also deeply concerned by the situation in\r\nthe Middle East: measures to close off Palestinian\r\nterritories, arbitrary arrests, extrajudiciary executions,\r\nthe destruction of property, land seizures, lack of\r\nrespect for resolutions adopted by the international\r\ncommunity and the siege imposed upon President\r\nArafat. Those actions do not help to establish true\r\npeace in that part of the world. Mali, which has always\r\nsupported the just cause of the Palestinian people,\r\nurgently appeals to the members of the Quartet to\r\nrestore dialogue between Israel and the Palestinian\r\nAuthority, with a view to a just, equitable and lasting\r\nsettlement of a conflict which has gone on too long.\r\nInternational terrorism is today another challenge\r\nto international peace and security. We have seen this\r\nphenomenon on all continents, making it abundantly\r\nclear that terrorism has neither homeland nor religion.\r\nThat is why the international community must display\r\nsteadfast political will in combating terrorism by, inter\r\nalia, strengthening the available legal arsenal,\r\nincluding mechanisms for cooperation and technical\r\nassistance. Beyond this, we must tackle the root causes\r\nof the phenomenon, which include poverty, massive\r\nhuman rights violations, intolerance, injustice and\r\nimpunity from prosecution.\r\nThe question of small arms and light weapons is\r\nalso a primary concern for us. Mali has made a\r\nsignificant contribution in this area by developing\r\ninitiatives at the subregional, regional and international\r\nlevels. In this regard, Mali is striving to transform the\r\nECOWAS Moratorium on the Importation, Exportation\r\nand Manufacture of Small Arms and Light Weapons in\r\nWest Africa into a convention. We further believe that\r\nthe international community must now resolutely\r\nengage in the establishment of a binding legal\r\ninstrument on marking, registering and tracing small\r\narms and light weapons.\r\nThe situation of children in armed conflicts is\r\nalso a source of concern for my country. We fully\r\nsupport the recommendations contained in the report of\r\nthe Special Representative to the Secretary-General for\r\nChildren and Armed Conflict (E/CN.4/2004/70), and\r\ncall for the effective implementation of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1539 (2004). Along the same lines,\r\nMali is working within the Human Security Network to\r\nkeep this question among the priorities of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nIn order to effectively prevent and manage these\r\nsituations of crisis and conflict — that is, to preserve\r\nand guarantee international peace and security — the\r\ninternational community must work for an international\r\norder that is based on the rule of law, and for a United\r\nNations whose legitimacy is strengthened. Thus, we\r\nwelcome the establishment of the High-Level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change, and we anxiously\r\nawait its conclusions.\r\nThe question of development is, and must remain,\r\na priority issue on the international agenda, and thus\r\nwe welcome the decision to hold a plenary meeting in\r\n2005 devoted to follow-up of the outcome of the\r\nMillennium Summit, and to a comprehensive and\r\ncoordinated follow-up and implementation of\r\ndocuments from the major conferences and summit\r\nmeetings organized by the United Nations on economic\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nand social topics. We hope that that meeting will\r\nenable us to conduct an objective and candid review of\r\nthe way in which commitments have been met,\r\nincluding the progress achieved and obstacles\r\nremaining in the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nDefeating poverty is a major objective for the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Mali. As part of that\r\nendeavour, the adoption in 2002, and the\r\nimplementation, of a strategic framework, has made it\r\npossible to achieve important results in the areas of\r\neducation, health, rural development and basic\r\ninfrastructure. I take this opportunity to express Mali’s\r\nsupport for the initiative launched by Presidents\r\nJacques Chirac and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, which\r\nled to the New York Declaration on Action Against\r\nHunger and Poverty adopted on 20 September 2004.\r\nOn trade negotiations, Mali attaches great\r\nimportance to the round of trade negotiations under\r\nway within the World Trade Organization (WTO): the\r\nDoha development round. We hope that those\r\nnegotiations will lead to an economic system which\r\nwill enable all countries, especially developing\r\ncountries, to fully maximize their potential. We hope to\r\nsee a true breakthrough in agricultural negotiations,\r\nwhich should lead to the elimination of subsidies and\r\nother production and export support mechanisms,\r\nparticularly with respect to cotton. Indeed, cotton is\r\none of the commodities where we, African producer\r\ncountries, offer true comparative advantages, since\r\nproduction costs are one fifth those in developed\r\ncountries. At present, however, our countries are\r\nseriously harmed by production and export subsidies\r\nfor cotton.\r\nFor that reason, we reaffirm our opposition to\r\nsubsidy policies which undermine free market\r\ncompetition, lead to overproduction and lower prices\r\non the international market and prevent our agriculture\r\nfrom getting off the ground.\r\nThat is why Mali is also calling for the gradual\r\nelimination of all tariff and non-tariff barriers, as well\r\nas the implementation of measures on the free\r\nmovement of people, goods and services. We are\r\npleased with the European Union’s commitment to\r\nfacilitate the integration of least developed countries\r\nwithin the multilateral trading system, including\r\nthrough the adoption in April 2004 of an action plan\r\nfor agriculture that includes a proposal for an Africa-\r\nEurope partnership on cotton.\r\nThe AIDS pandemic is progressing at such an\r\nalarming rate that, in addition to its health\r\nrepercussions, it has today become a problem for\r\neconomic and social development, especially in Africa.\r\nThat is why we must implement, urgently and in full,\r\nthe commitments that we undertook in 2001 so that we\r\ncan mobilize the necessary energy and resources to\r\neffectively fight the scourge. Mali has set up a\r\nmultisectoral programme to fight HIV/AIDS at a cost\r\nof $150 million, or 73 billion CFA francs. The\r\nimplementation of that programme will make it\r\npossible to distribute antiretroviral drugs to patients\r\nfree of charge, as well as to provide necessary impetus\r\nto the information and awareness campaign with a\r\nview to prevention. Pilot laboratories for screening and\r\ncounselling will be established throughout the country,\r\nand small and medium-sized businesses for social\r\noutreach will be set up, thus providing jobs for young\r\npeople.\r\nWith regard to the situation of people with\r\ndisabilities, Mali is pleased with the negotiations that\r\nare under way with a view to elaborating a convention\r\nto protect their rights and dignity. We are convinced\r\nthat the adoption of such an instrument would establish\r\na framework for improved social and economic\r\nintegration for people with disabilities, allowing them\r\nto fully participate in the development efforts of their\r\nrespective societies.\r\nI would like to conclude in the same vein as I\r\nbegan — by emphatically reaffirming the faith that\r\nMali has in the United Nations, whose purposes and\r\nprinciples, set out almost 60 years ago, remain deeply\r\nmeaningful and highly relevant. It is true that recently\r\nthe Organization’s capacity and credibility have been\r\nseriously undermined. It is therefore all the more\r\nimportant that we carry out a thorough reform of the\r\nOrganization and revitalize its main bodies. Mali\r\nwelcomes the important progress that has been\r\nachieved in the context of the revitalization of the work\r\nof the General Assembly. The reorganization of the\r\nwork of the Main Committees, the strengthening of the\r\nrole of the Bureau and the improvement in working\r\nmethods will certainly result in the greater\r\neffectiveness of this important body. I would like to\r\npay tribute, Sir, to your predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte,\r\nfor the remarkable work that he accomplished in that\r\nrespect.\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nMali shares the common African position that\r\nSecurity Council reform is a necessary — indeed, a\r\npriority — task if we are to strengthen the capacities\r\nand the credibility of that important body. The Council\r\nmust be more representative and legitimate. Its\r\ncomposition should reflect the realities of today’s\r\nworld and be expanded in both categories of\r\nmembership, with particular account being taken of the\r\nrepresentation of Africa.\r\nThe people of the world have placed their hope in\r\nthe United Nations, and they expect, in return, greater\r\npeace, security, democracy, development and solidarity.\r\nAs the community of nations, we have the means to\r\nachieve those goals, thanks to our collective awareness\r\nand the safeguarding of the values we all share:\r\ndemocracy, respect for the rule of law, the primacy of\r\nhuman rights, the preservation of the environment and\r\nthe protection of future generations from the scourge of\r\nwar.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I give the floor\r\nto His Excellency Mr. Seyoum Mesfin, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Federal Democratic Republic of\r\nEthiopia.\r\nMr. Mesfin (Ethiopia): Allow me to extend to\r\nyou warm congratulations on your election as President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I\r\nwould like to assure you of our fullest cooperation as\r\nyou discharge the heavy responsibility bestowed upon\r\nyou. I have no doubt that both Gabon and Africa will\r\nbe proud of the leadership that I know you will provide\r\nat this session.\r\nI would also like to commend your predecessor\r\nfor his invaluable contribution to the success of the\r\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe continue to be deeply grateful to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the great work\r\nthat he has been doing in a variety of areas and at\r\nvarious levels. We are grateful to him for doing\r\nwhatever is humanly possible at the international level\r\nto protect the integrity of the United Nations and to\r\ndefend the rule of law. At the level of Africa, we\r\nappreciate his commitment to the creation of the\r\npolitical and economic conditions to generate hope for\r\nthe revival of the continent.\r\nNever before have we in Africa been as\r\ndetermined and as resolute in our attempt to change for\r\nthe better the economic and social conditions on our\r\ncontinent and to create the right climate for peace and\r\nstability.\r\nThat is what the transformation of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity into the African Union\r\n(AU) signifies and what the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) symbolizes. NEPAD’s\r\nPeer Review Mechanism is a vivid demonstration of\r\nAfrica’s commitment to good and accountable\r\ngovernance.\r\nThe renewed vigour with which we in Africa\r\nhave begun to be proactive in the area of peace and\r\nstability within the framework of the Peace and\r\nSecurity Council of the AU is, indeed, a promising\r\nbeginning. But despite the efforts being made by\r\nAfrica, the progress that we have made so far has been\r\nmodest and thus insufficient to bring about hope for the\r\nfuture of the continent.\r\nPart of the explanation for that is obvious. There\r\nis just not sufficient support internationally to make it\r\npossible for Africa to meet the economic challenges\r\nthat it is facing. Terms of trade have continued to\r\nmilitate against Africa’s development. Moreover, no\r\nsubstantial progress has been made to relieve many in\r\nAfrica of the debt burden.\r\nIt is the combination of all of those factors that\r\nhas created serious doubts about the ability of many in\r\nAfrica to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nIt is our hope that those trends will be reversed and that\r\nthe promises made in the Millennium Declaration\r\nfulfilled.\r\nAt the end of the day, nations must assume\r\nresponsibility for their future, for their development\r\nand for their peace and stability. Ethiopia has no\r\nillusions in that regard. We realize fully that, in the\r\nfinal analysis, it is what Ethiopians do that will shape\r\nand determine our future. It is that conviction that is\r\nthe basis for the various activities currently under way\r\nin our country.\r\nWith respect to issues of development, the\r\nprimary task for us is the fight against poverty and\r\nensuring food security for our people. A nation as\r\ndiverse as Ethiopia can countenance no other form of\r\ngovernance than democratic governance. As such, the\r\nvery survival of Ethiopia requires good governance and\r\nthe democratic handling of differences, as a matter not\r\nonly of preference but of prudence. Peace and stability\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nin Ethiopia hinge on the deepening of democracy in the\r\ncountry.\r\nIt is precisely for that reason, and with a view to\r\nmaking up for lost time, that at present there is no\r\ngreater imperative for Ethiopia than the fostering of\r\npeace and stability in our country and in the region of\r\nwhich Ethiopia is a part.\r\nIt is that same logic which governs Ethiopia’s\r\nposition on the peace process between Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea. Let there be no doubt that Ethiopia wants to\r\nput its crisis with Eritrea behind it. Our conviction is\r\nthat both peoples would be mistaken to see the other as\r\nan enemy. The truth is that both have one common\r\nenemy — poverty and backwardness.\r\nIt is, indeed, regrettable that after so much\r\nbloodshed it has become difficult for Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea to formally complete the peace process because\r\nof complications that have been created in connection\r\nwith the implementation of some aspects of the\r\ndecision of the Eritrea/Ethiopia Boundary Commission\r\n(EEBC). I said, “some aspects of the decision” of the\r\nEEBC because, when the chips are down, the obstacles\r\nto a breakthrough in the peace process between\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea involve a controversy surrounding\r\nthe demarcation of no more than 15 per cent of a\r\ncommon boundary which is, altogether, more than\r\n1,000 kilometres long.\r\nLet me be very clear. Ethiopia is prepared to do\r\nwhatever is humanly possible for peace. There is no\r\ngreater priority for us than ensuring peace in our\r\ncountry and stable and mutually beneficial relations\r\nwith all our neighbours. That is precisely why we have\r\nreiterated that we are ready to dialogue with Eritrea\r\nwith a view to finding a win-win solution to the current\r\nstalemate faced by both countries.\r\nDialogue and normalization of relations between\r\nthe two countries is not a favour that either party does\r\nfor the other, or for the international community.\r\nRather, it is an obligation that both countries have,\r\ninasmuch as all other alternatives are ruled out by\r\ninternational law and by the Algiers Agreement.\r\nThe promotion of durable peace between the two\r\ncountries and the call for the permanent cessation of\r\nmilitary hostilities between the two parties are the twin\r\npillars of the Algiers Agreement. Ethiopia is convinced\r\nthat the implementation of some aspects of the\r\nBoundary Commission’s observations on demarcation\r\nis not in the interest of peace between the two countries\r\nand will not advance the major objectives of the\r\nAlgiers Agreement, nor will it advance the cause of\r\npeace in our subregion.\r\nIt is under those circumstances that Ethiopia has\r\nfelt that there is only one rational way out of the\r\nimpasse — dialogue, an open-ended dialogue on all\r\nissues dividing Ethiopia and Eritrea, including on\r\nboundary demarcation with a view to finding an\r\namicable and a mutually acceptable way out of the\r\ndeadlock and a modus vivendi that would form the\r\nbasis for the normalization of relations between the\r\ntwo countries.\r\nEritrea, however, is of a different mind. It\r\ncontinues to be preoccupied with the hope of getting\r\nthe Security Council to impose sanctions on Ethiopia\r\nand with the satisfaction that it would derive from such\r\nan outcome. Eritrea should be made to realize that that\r\nis unlikely to happen. Not because Eritrea is not big\r\nenough to have its way, but because the idea is too\r\ninappropriate and too unrealistic. Formality aside —\r\nand Eritrea’s oft-heard refrain of “final and binding”\r\nnotwithstanding — no fair-minded person can forget\r\nwhat happened in May 1998 and up through May 2000,\r\nand what the OAU said about Badme and its environs.\r\nBut talking about the past is not going to help\r\nEthiopia or Eritrea. The two countries cannot continue\r\nspending so much time on their preoccupation with\r\neach other. That will leave no time for thinking about\r\ntheir future and the future of their hungry and destitute\r\npeoples.\r\nThere is one other important point that Eritrea\r\nshould not be allowed to continue misleading the\r\ninternational community about. Nowhere in the whole\r\ntext of the Algiers Agreement of December 2000 is a\r\nprovision made for any entity — including the Security\r\nCouncil and the AU — to enforce a court decision.\r\nThat omission is deliberate, not accidental. Achieving\r\npeace and implementing the demarcation of the\r\ncommon boundary between the two countries is\r\nprimarily the responsibility of Ethiopia and Eritrea, a\r\npoint that has been repeated in various resolutions by\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nLet me close the issue by reiterating one\r\nfundamental point. Ethiopia is committed to peace with\r\nEritrea and to the removal of obstacles to achieving\r\nthat objective. Whatever means might be available to\r\nreach that goal, we will be ready to embrace them.\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nDialogue and negotiation, including using the good\r\noffices of the Secretary-General which have been made\r\navailable to the two parties, are the most realistic and\r\nfeasible means for making progress in the peace\r\nprocess. Ethiopia is ready to go more than half way to\r\nmake that a reality, but so far it has largely been left in\r\nthe proverbial situation of trying to clap with one hand.\r\nIt is our hope that reason will prevail in Eritrea sooner\r\nrather than later.\r\nThe peace process in Somalia has now come to a\r\nvery critical point, with the Somalis having now come\r\ncloser than any time in the last 13 years to establishing\r\na national Government. Ethiopia will continue, as a\r\nmember of the Intergovernmental Authority on\r\nDevelopment Facilitation Committee, to contribute to\r\nthe achievement of national reconciliation and work to\r\nhelp the Somali State rise from the ashes. That is an\r\nobligation for Ethiopia and it is also consistent with the\r\nvital interest Ethiopia has in peace and stability in our\r\nsubregion.\r\nFor those reasons, Ethiopia was looking forward\r\nto the final consummation of the peace process\r\nbetween the Government of the Sudan and the\r\nSudanese People’s Liberation Movement/Sudanese\r\nPeople’s Liberation Army (SPLM/SPLA), which has\r\nnow slowed down because of the tragedy in Darfur —\r\nan unanticipated tragedy. Ethiopia is keen to see the\r\nDarfur crisis resolved and the humanitarian tragedy\r\ndealt with as speedily as possible. Peace and stability\r\nin the Sudan is so critical for our subregion and for that\r\nreason Ethiopia will continue to do the best it can,\r\nincluding as a member of the AU Peace and Security\r\nCouncil, to assist that sister country to overcome the\r\nchallenge it is facing.\r\nEthiopia’s contribution to peace and peace-\r\nbuilding is not limited to what we have been doing in\r\nour own subregion. We have from the outset been\r\nclosely associated with the prevention, management\r\nand resolution of conflicts in the Great Lakes region,\r\nincluding at the highest level. Moreover, initially as\r\npart of the African Union mission and later as part of\r\nthe United Nations Operation in Burundi, Ethiopia’s\r\ncontingent in Burundi has continued to contribute in a\r\nmodest way to the success of the peace process there.\r\nAnother modest contribution we are making is in\r\njoining the efforts under way for the restoration of\r\npeace in Liberia as part of the United Nations Mission\r\nin Liberia.\r\nCertainly, we are also the beneficiaries of the\r\nsupport of a great many countries through the United\r\nNations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE),\r\nwhose work has been critical for keeping the situation\r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea stable. We are indeed\r\ngrateful to UNMEE, its personnel at all levels, and to\r\nthe troop-contributing countries.\r\nWe all agree that terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations is a crime against humanity. As our\r\nSecretary-General rightly stated in his address to this\r\nAssembly at the 3rd meeting, “No cause, no grievance,\r\nhowever legitimate in itself, can begin to justify such\r\nacts”. The international community should therefore\r\nfight that scourge with greater resolve and in unison.\r\nI would like to conclude by reaffirming\r\nEthiopia’s commitment to the United Nations and to\r\nthe principles and purposes for the promotion of which\r\nit was created. It is our earnest hope that the United\r\nNations will continue to enhance its credibility with\r\nrespect to its entire membership. That is why the\r\nreform of the Organization is so critical and\r\nimperative, including the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, so that regions, including Africa, can have the\r\nfair representation they aspire to. Without a doubt,\r\nenhanced democratization will make the United\r\nNations more transparent and therefore more credible.\r\nThe future of the Organization rests on it. In the\r\nmeantime, Ethiopia will continue to be devoted to the\r\nUnited Nations and to the values it stands for.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Aïchatou Mindaoudou, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Republic of\r\nthe Niger.\r\nMrs. Mindaoudou (Niger) (spoke in French):\r\nAllow me at the outset, Mr. President, to join those\r\nwho have spoken before me in extending warm\r\ncongratulations on behalf of my country, my delegation\r\nand myself for your brilliant election to the presidency\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. The\r\nChairman of the African Union, His Excellency\r\nMr. Olusegun Obasanjo, already expressed here a few\r\ndays ago our continent’s gratitude to the international\r\ncommunity, which, by choosing you, has made one of\r\nAfrica’s most illustrious sons President of the General\r\nAssembly. We naturally associate ourselves with that\r\nexpression of gratitude. We wish you every success in\r\ncarrying out your lofty mission, and you know you\r\nhave always had Niger’s support. To your predecessor,\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte, I should like to\r\nexpress our congratulations on the skill, enthusiasm\r\nand authority with which he conducted the work of the\r\nfifty-eighth session of the Assembly in a difficult\r\ninternational context.\r\nToday, the international community finds itself at\r\na crossroads. International peace and security —\r\nalready sorely tested by recurrent armed conflicts —\r\nare subjected to threats or bloody attacks of terrorist\r\nacts, which further darken the global atmosphere of\r\nuncertainty and insecurity. In your opening statement,\r\nMr. President, you mentioned one of those persistent\r\nand bloody conflicts — that of the Middle East, a\r\nconflict that costs so much to humanity in terms of\r\nhuman lives, financial resources and lost hope. That\r\nregion’s macabre statistics remind us — as if that were\r\nstill necessary — of the urgent need to bring the parties\r\nto the negotiating table on the basis of the road map,\r\nwhich the Security Council itself endorsed through its\r\nresolution 1515 (2003).\r\nToday, in addition to the Palestinian problem and\r\nin light of Iraq, the situation in the Middle East is\r\ncentral to world peace and security as never before.\r\nWith respect to Iraq — a country with which Niger\r\nshares the same faith, Islam, the basis of our common\r\nmembership in the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference — we cannot fail to deplore so much loss\r\nof human life and so much blind violence, which are\r\nthe daily lot of the Iraqi people. We earnestly hope that\r\ngreater, revitalized international cooperation will\r\nenable us to swiftly establish free and democratic\r\ninstitutions in Iraq, put an end to the chaos that seems\r\nto have taken root there and bring to the country the\r\npeace and stability necessary for its socio-economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nNiger, as a member of the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference Contact Group on Jammu and\r\nKashmir, believes that a sustained dialogue between\r\nIndia and Pakistan will make it possible to lay the\r\nfoundation for a peaceful solution to that conflict by\r\nenabling the people of Kashmir to exercise their right\r\nto self-determination, in accordance with the relevant\r\nUnited Nations resolutions.\r\nConcerning Western Sahara, Niger reaffirms its\r\nsupport for United Nations efforts with a view to\r\nreaching a just and comprehensive settlement of the\r\nconflict. The commendable actions of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral should be continued and supported until we\r\nsee a successful conclusion, in conformity with the\r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions, particularly\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1495 (2003) and\r\n1541 (2004).\r\nIn Niger, at the end of a long and sometimes\r\npainful process, we have established a political system\r\nin which a multitude of parties, private media and civil\r\nsociety organizations flourish, all of them under the\r\nprotective umbrella of a constitution that guarantees\r\nthe separation of powers and an independent judiciary.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Tandja Mamadou, President of the\r\nRepublic since the democratic elections of\r\n22 November 1999, invited the people of Niger on\r\n14 September 2004 to vote in new presidential and\r\nlegislative elections that will be held starting on\r\n13 November 2004. That will be the first time since\r\n1991 — when the multiparty system was established in\r\nNiger — that a fully democratic mandate has been\r\ncompleted. And it will be successfully, because in our\r\ncountry, social peace has returned, State authority has\r\nbeen restored, the economy is back on track and the\r\npeople of Niger have new hope. On 24 July, the\r\nbuilding of democratic structures was completed\r\nthrough municipal and local elections, to the great\r\nsatisfaction of everyone.\r\nThe restored status of the State has made it\r\npossible — thanks to the personal intervention of\r\nPresident Tandja Mamadou — to quickly overcome the\r\nresistance of the remaining few who were still opposed\r\nto the expanded polio vaccination programme. Here, I\r\nmust sincerely thank the international community —\r\nparticularly the World Health Organization, UNICEF,\r\nthe Centres for Disease Control of the United States\r\nand Rotary International — for having effectively\r\nassisted us in our efforts in that fight.\r\nAt the external level, our public and private\r\nbilateral partners who left Niger before 1999 have\r\nsince returned. Niger’s presidency of the West African\r\nEconomic and Monetary Union and, last year, of the\r\nCommunity of Sahelo-Saharan States has given greater\r\nvisibility to our external action aimed at peace and\r\nsecurity in Africa. In particular, that action has taken\r\nthe form of sending a Niger contingent to Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, military observers to the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo and civilian police components to\r\nBurundi, the Central African Republic and Timor-\r\nLeste. All that has convinced us that the international\r\ncommunity’s support is more essential today than ever\r\nbefore to help Africa strengthen the capacities of its\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nsubregional institutions and those of its continental\r\norganization, the African Union.\r\nUnder the leadership of President Olusegun\r\nObasanjo, the African Union is working ceaselessly to\r\nprevent conflicts in African countries where peace\r\nreigns, to consolidate peace and security where — as in\r\nGuinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone or Liberia — the\r\npopulations have barely emerged from a situation of\r\npolitical instability or bloody armed conflicts, and,\r\nlastly, to extinguish the hotbeds of tension persisting in\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nBurundi and the Sudan.\r\nOur experience with conflict prevention and\r\nresolution in Africa teaches us that the golden rule in\r\nthat respect is to have confidence in subregional\r\ninstitutions and the African Union and to support them\r\nwith consistent logistical and financial means. In that\r\nregard, Niger welcomes the decision taken by the\r\nSecurity Council to support the African Union’s\r\ndecision to strengthen and expand the observation\r\nmission in Darfur and to encourage member States to\r\nprovide all the equipment and logistical, financial and\r\nmaterial resources required for the mission’s swift\r\nexpansion. We earnestly hope that the various parties\r\nto the conflict will respond positively to the appeals\r\ncoming from Africa and elsewhere to swiftly put an\r\nend to that tragedy and to bring about a comprehensive\r\npeace agreement, on which the advent of a peaceful\r\nSudan will depend.\r\nWithin the framework of Africa’s new\r\ndevelopment initiatives, the heads of State of the\r\nAfrican Union agreed, during a special summit held\r\nrecently in Ouagadougou, to place employment at the\r\ncentre of their political, economic and social policies.\r\nAs rightly pointed out by His Excellency Blaise\r\nCompaoré, President of Burkina Faso and host of the\r\nsummit, Africa needs the effective support of the\r\ninternational community to implement the decisions of\r\nOuagadougou.\r\nFrom the Millennium Declaration to the world\r\nconferences and summits that followed it, many\r\ninternational decisions made the fight against poverty a\r\nworld priority and a major challenge for humanity.\r\nHow, then, can it be that hundreds of millions of\r\npeople continue to languish in abject poverty and total\r\ndestitution? How can it be that, in this era of\r\ntechnological and scientific advances, HIV/AIDS and\r\nother pandemics continue to wreak havoc throughout\r\nthe world, particularly in Africa? How can it be that, at\r\na time of globalization, many parts of the planet —\r\nparticularly the least developed countries — are still\r\ntotally excluded from international trade? And how can\r\nit be that, despite the commitments undertaken through\r\nthe relevant international conventions, the global\r\nenvironment continues insidiously to deteriorate,\r\ndangerously jeopardizing the future of generations to\r\ncome?\r\nIn light of that situation, and in view of the dearth\r\nof financial resources to address the crucial problems\r\nassailing humanity, we must wonder about the\r\nexistence of real political will on the part of rich\r\ncountries to help the most impoverished countries\r\novercome abject poverty. The Global Fund to Fight\r\nAIDS and the World Solidarity Fund for the\r\nElimination of Poverty — whose creation we\r\nwelcome — suffer from a cruel lack of resources.\r\nFurthermore, we believe the modalities for\r\ngranting those resources to eligible countries should be\r\nmodelled after those in force for the funds obtained in\r\nthe framework of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries\r\nInitiative, in order to ensure management that is both\r\ntransparent and responsible.\r\nWe have to face the reality. Given the economic\r\nstagnation, poverty and the lack of prospects that are\r\nserious threats for social stability and the young\r\ndemocracies of developing countries, international\r\ncooperation is the key to achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals — as long as developed and\r\ndeveloping countries agree to assume their respective\r\nresponsibilities. In this respect, the commitments made\r\nin Doha to promote a just trade, the Monterrey\r\nConsensus on Financing for Development and the\r\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment remain the cornerstones for\r\nimplementation of the Goals.\r\nHowever, the meagre results achieved in the\r\nimplementation of conclusions from major forums\r\nprompt the international community as a whole to re-\r\nexamine its conscience. The upcoming high-level\r\ndialogue on financing for development should be an\r\nopportunity to once again place at the core of the\r\ndebate the important issue of the mobilization of\r\nresources for development. In this respect, taxation at a\r\nlevel to be agreed upon — as was recalled at the last\r\nsummit on poverty — on all international financial\r\ntransactions could provide the substantial funding so\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nnecessary for attaining the Millennium Development\r\nGoals.\r\nEndemic poverty, which affects the African\r\ncontinent in particular, is not a question of fate. It is\r\npossible to reduce poverty as long as the international\r\ncommunity is resolute in tackling it. It is possible to\r\nreduce poverty if industrialized countries implement\r\nwithout delay the enhanced programme to alleviate the\r\ndebt of highly indebted countries and agree to cancel\r\nall bilateral public debts. It is possible to reduce\r\npoverty if industrialized countries agree to increase\r\nofficial development assistance to the level necessary\r\nto reach the objectives of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. It is possible to reduce poverty if industrialized\r\ncountries resolve to open their markets to commodities\r\nfrom developing countries, and if raw materials from\r\nthose countries are purchased at their proper values. It\r\nis possible to reduce poverty if industrialized countries\r\neliminate their farming subsidies for cotton and support\r\nthe countries concerned in their policy for providing\r\nrural areas with a suitable farming infrastructure and,\r\nespecially, with small rural facilities.\r\nLastly, it is possible to reduce poverty if\r\nglobalization is better managed and if interdependence\r\nleads to the establishment of an international financial\r\nand commercial structure that is democratic and able to\r\nmeet the needs of all parties.\r\nNot so long ago the international community,\r\nwith the Group of 8 in the lead, solemnly declared its\r\ncommitment to support the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). Today we must\r\nacknowledge that that great enthusiasm still has not\r\nmaterialized in concrete actions on a scale that would\r\nmeet the legitimate aspirations of African continent.\r\nDespite constant efforts by the African countries, there\r\nis still much left to be done to meet the objectives\r\ncontained in that vast and ambitious partnership.\r\nI am pleased to say here that Niger is very\r\npleased to work with the Office of the Representative\r\nof the Secretary-General for NEPAD, as well as with\r\nthe Office of the High Representative of the United\r\nNations for Least Developed Countries, Landlocked\r\nCountries and Small Island Developing States.\r\nTo conclude, it is important that the\r\nDesertification Convention be effectively implemented,\r\na convention that is seen as the best illustration of the\r\nlink between environmental degradation and poverty.\r\nSpeaking of environmental degradation, how can\r\nwe overlook the ecological ravages caused by the\r\ncurrent locust invasion in part of Africa? Because it did\r\nnot act in good time, the international community —\r\nwhich had been warned of this danger far in\r\nadvance — must now mobilize, as soon as possible,\r\nsufficient financial and material means to stop the\r\nspread of the plague in order to halt the spectre of\r\nfamine that looms over the populations of northern\r\nAfrica, the Sahel and West Africa as a whole.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Souef Mohamed El-Amine,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Union of the\r\nComoros.\r\nMr. El-Amine (Comoros) (spoke in French):\r\nMr. President, allow me at the outset, on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of the Comoros and on my own behalf, to\r\ncongratulate you warmly on your election to preside\r\nover the work of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nninth session. Your task is by no means an easy one,\r\nbut it is an honour to you personally, to your country\r\nand to the entire African continent. No other\r\norganization can boast of that universal mission. I\r\nwould therefore like to assure you of the full readiness\r\nof my delegation to work with you for the success of\r\nthat noble mission in the service of peace and security\r\nin the world.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the way in which your\r\npredecessor guided the work at the fifty-eighth session.\r\nOn behalf of the Comoros I hail the tireless\r\ncommitment and complete availability of the\r\nSecretary-General in the fight he leads to advance the\r\nideals of peace, social justice, development and\r\nfreedom throughout the world.\r\nThe world — a world of peace and vision,\r\nOf ideas and union now unfurled,\r\nA world that has divided lands\r\nAnd with seas that share their sands;\r\nWorld of tolerance and knowing,\r\nWorld abundance, overflowing;\r\nWorld of peace, world that charmed,\r\nNo, world; you cannot be harmed.\r\nNations unity provided,\r\nBut hearts tend to be divided.\r\nFor we have met each other,\r\nAnd yet our peoples live in fear.\r\nChildren of the world,\r\nand countries of the world,\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nWhere is the world?\r\nWhat is this world?\r\nBorders here do not exist;\r\nPrayers vanish in the mist.\r\nTerror is their daily lot;\r\nFear is all that they have got.\r\nKillers rule instead of bread.\r\nMillennium world, world so fair,\r\nYet a world of billionaires;\r\nWorld of speeches of all sorts\r\nWithin fora, and of courts.\r\nWorld rejecting our solutions\r\nand denying resolutions.\r\nWhat a world. What a peace.\r\nWhile the world is slowly forging ahead in this\r\nthird millennium, we are obliged to note that the\r\nfeelings of our respective peoples are fluctuating\r\nbetween hope and concern. Indeed, while the\r\nrelationship between peace and development is\r\nbecoming increasingly justified and is making them\r\nindivisible, the path of world events is tending to call\r\nthis into question. It is indeed true that there can be no\r\npeace and no security in the world as long as hundreds\r\nof millions of individuals are still prisoners of\r\ndestitution and poverty and still do not have the\r\nminimum necessary for a decent daily life. Nor can\r\nthere be peace and security in the world as long as,\r\nworking all together, we have not made the required\r\nefforts to save the hundreds of millions of human lives\r\nthreatened by the scourges of AIDS and other\r\npandemics.\r\nMoreover, what kind of peace can there be in a\r\nworld that makes the spread of weapons and the\r\nproliferation of hotbeds of tension the very pattern of\r\nits existence and the means for its evolution?\r\nThese are the problems before us, this forum with\r\nthe highest priority mission of seeing to the proper\r\nconduct of world affairs, the prosperity and flourishing\r\nof the human race and to the control of the global\r\nenvironment by our actions, which must serve the\r\ncause and the welfare of each and every people, each\r\nnation and each citizen of the world.\r\nThat is why it is incumbent on the United\r\nNations, today more than ever, to play fully its role as\r\ndefined by the Charter. This role is one of vanguard\r\naction, of mediation par excellence, of stimulus and of\r\npromotion of the remarkable accomplishments wrought\r\nevery day by the progress of science.\r\nFor that reason, my country says “no” to poverty,\r\n“no” to AIDS and other pandemics, “no” to terrorism\r\nand “yes” to the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. In order to combat the scourges of\r\npoverty, major diseases and terrorism, we need a firm\r\nand determined will to work for development.\r\nThe Millennium Summit, in which all the\r\nforemost leaders of our planet participated, took full\r\nnote of that reality. The Millennium Declaration set out\r\nthe steps and the course to follow in order to\r\neffectively direct the world’s development and\r\nprogressively correct the problems identified. The\r\nDeclaration established 2015 as the deadline for\r\nreviewing the plan of action that each country must\r\nimplement, in a collective resolve to get the world back\r\non track.\r\nThe Union of the Comoros endorses the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. While working for\r\nprogress in the national reconciliation process, the\r\nGovernment of my country, like all other members of\r\nthe community of nations, has made the necessary\r\nefforts to establish a poverty reduction strategy. Today,\r\nthat document to which all active forces in our country\r\ncontributed, constitutes the instrument panel of our\r\ndevelopment priorities.\r\nIn order for the Comoros to act on those\r\ndevelopment priorities, it requires the assistance of the\r\ninternational community. It was only this past April\r\nthat my country finally completed the establishment of\r\nits institutions, thus bringing to a close the separatist\r\nand institutional crisis that for seven years had shaken\r\nthe foundations of our State.\r\nIn particular, we hope that the entire international\r\ncommunity will support the African Union’s call,\r\nissued at the recent summit at Addis Ababa, for an\r\ninternational donors round-table meeting to be held to\r\nassist the convalescent Comoros. This would enable it\r\nto recover and by stages to rejoin the other nations in\r\nworking at the subregional, continental and global\r\nlevels to achieve sustainable development, which is\r\nnow its greatest priority.\r\nThe firm national commitment of all Member\r\nStates of the international community is required to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. This\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nmilitates in favour of the enhanced representation of\r\ncontinents and peoples in the United Nations.\r\nWe should therefore consider increasing the\r\npermanent membership of the Security Council to\r\ninclude, for example, the Republic of India, Japan, the\r\nFederal Republic of Germany and the Federative\r\nRepublic of Brazil. The African continent and the Arab\r\nworld also deserve appropriate representation on the\r\nSecurity Council. That is the way to achieve equity,\r\nand equity is desperately needed for there to be greater\r\njustice and peace in the world. That appears to be what\r\nmust be done today to create the necessary balance for\r\ncontrol of the international order and the global\r\nenvironment, which have never been so unstable and\r\nuncertain.\r\nIn the eternal search for peace, social justice and\r\nprosperity, the fate of small island States, which face\r\nso many threats to their survival, must not remain in\r\njeopardy. Let us be fully aware that numerous countries\r\nare destined to disappear because of such hazards as\r\nrising sea-levels, desertification, cyclones and volcanic\r\neruptions. Accordingly, we must consider specific\r\nactions for each of those States. We urge the\r\ninternational community to mobilize on a large scale to\r\nensure the success of the forthcoming meting of small\r\nisland developing States, to be convened on the island\r\nof Mauritius early in 2005.\r\nI must not fail to affirm before the Assembly that\r\nmy country, the Union of the Comoros, in its concern\r\nto maintain its unity and integrity, considers the issue\r\nof the Comorian island of Mayotte to be one of its\r\ngreatest and most urgent priorities. My Government is\r\nconvinced that a speedy settlement of this dispute will\r\nfurther the development of the country as a whole and\r\nwill enable it to resolutely take its place alongside\r\npeace- and freedom-loving countries and to champion\r\nuniversal ideals and promote democracy in the world.\r\nThe Union of the Comoros therefore calls on the\r\nFrench Republic to engage in a constructive political\r\ndialogue on this issue, in compliance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 3385 (XXX), which admitted the\r\nComoros to the United Nations as the Comoro\r\nArchipelago, composed of four islands: Mayotte,\r\nAnjouan, Mohéli and Grande-Comore.\r\nIn the same spirit, my country attaches the utmost\r\nimportance to the principle of a single independent and\r\nindivisible China and calls for the restoration of the\r\nisland of Taiwan to its rightful home.\r\nMy country truly values the very constructive\r\ndialogue now under way between the Government of\r\nthe Republic of India and the Islamic Republic of\r\nPakistan on the question of Kashmir.\r\nThe Union of the Comoros sincerely hopes that\r\nthe Palestinian and Israeli peoples will soon institute a\r\ndialogue that will bring about an end to the violence\r\nand lead to the peaceful coexistence of those two\r\nneighbouring peoples.\r\nIt also hopes to see a just and equitable settlement\r\nto the question of Western Sahara and vigorously\r\nsupports the efforts made to that end by the United\r\nNations and the Government of the Kingdom of\r\nMorocco.\r\nThe Union of the Comoros vehemently condemns\r\nthe hostage-takings in Iraq and hopes to see a rapid\r\nreturn of peace and security in Iraq, which will\r\ncontribute to security in the region.\r\nThe Union of the Comoros is closely following\r\ndevelopments in Darfur. It supports the efforts of the\r\nAfrican Union, the Government of the Sudan and the\r\nentire international community to find a speedy, just\r\nand equitable settlement of that question.\r\nFinally, I hope that the work of the fifty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly will be successful,\r\nand I join all those eminent personalities who have\r\npreceded me at this noble rostrum in expressing my\r\ncountry’s most fervent desires for greater peace and\r\nsecurity throughout the world.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nMr. Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the observer delegation\r\nof Palestine.\r\nMr. Kaddoumi (Palestine): Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating you, Mr. Ping, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly during its fifty-\r\nninth session. We are confident that you will conduct\r\nthe proceedings of this session with great competence.\r\nI would like to pay tribute to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Julian Robert Hunte, who so ably presided over the\r\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nI would like to express at this time my deep\r\nappreciation for the efforts of the Secretary-General to\r\nharmonize international relations and ensure respect\r\nfor the principles of the Charter and international law,\r\nwith a view to strengthening international peace and\r\nsecurity. His statement before this Assembly marks a\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\nlandmark in the quest for the rule of law and respect\r\nfor the role of the United Nations in international\r\nconflicts.\r\nIn my statement, I will focus on the turbulent\r\nsituation in the Middle East and, more specifically, on\r\nthe core of the conflict in the Middle East. The\r\nsituation in the region of Western Asia — or the\r\nMiddle East — is in turmoil. The occupation of Iraq\r\nwas founded on false pretexts, further damaging the\r\nalready grave situation resulting from Israel’s policies\r\nand practices in occupied Palestinian and other Arab\r\nterritories. A total absence of law and order is now the\r\ngeneral pattern of life in occupied Iraq. This continued\r\noccupation is wreaking havoc on the economic and\r\nsocial aspects of life there. We urge the competent\r\ninstitutions, namely the United Nations General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council, to take the\r\nnecessary and appropriate measures to ensure Iraq’s\r\nindependence and sovereignty as soon as possible.\r\nIsrael is the only nuclear Power in the Middle\r\nEast. It has approximately the fourth most powerful\r\narmy in the world and is a sophisticated arms\r\ndeveloper and dealer with no ethical or moral\r\nconstraints and no concern for human rights. The\r\nIsraeli Government can therefore do anything it\r\nwishes, and it acts like a high-tech military expert and\r\nrogue State. It has become tremendously useful for the\r\nUnited States, since it has strategically placed itself in\r\nthe centre of the global arms industry. Counting on the\r\nsupport of the United States, Israel breaks moral and\r\ninternational laws with impunity.\r\nThe daily assaults on peaceful Palestinian towns\r\nand villages — the demolition of homes and houses,\r\nthe bulldozing and uprooting of age-old fruit-bearing\r\nolive and citrus trees, the targeted killings and\r\nassassinations, the closures, the imposition of a state of\r\nsiege and curfews and the use of excessively\r\ndisproportionate firepower, which has resulted, so far,\r\nin more than 3,200 deaths and thousands of injuries —\r\nare common knowledge. We completely reject the\r\nallegation by Israel that this is carried out in self-\r\ndefence. The Palestinians under occupation, with their\r\nmeagre means of combat, are the party exercising the\r\nright to self-defence. Almost 8,000 Palestinians are\r\nbeing held without trial under merciless conditions,\r\nand when they protested against those conditions, an\r\nIsraeli minister boasted, and I quote, “let them go on a\r\nhunger strike until they die”.\r\nIn addition to all the other methods Israel uses to\r\nobstruct peace, it holds our democratically elected\r\nPresident, Yasser Arafat, in confinement and has\r\nannounced that they can find no partner with whom to\r\nnegotiate peace. With whom are the negotiations for\r\nsettlement and peace to be negotiated, if not with the\r\ndemocratically elected President? Israel, and others of\r\nthe same mind, must wish to see a continuation of the\r\nstatus quo or to deal with an imposed — and not\r\ndemocratically elected — group or person.\r\nThe performance-based road map was\r\nunanimously backed by Security Council resolution\r\n1515 (2003). We have accepted the road map since, in\r\nour opinion, it augured well. The road map envisaged a\r\ntwo-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,\r\nand stated that the solution of the conflict\r\n“will only be achieved through an end to violence\r\nand terrorism, when the Palestinian people have a\r\nleadership acting decisively against terror and\r\nwilling and able to build a practising democracy\r\nbased on tolerance and liberty, and through\r\nIsrael’s readiness to do what is necessary for a\r\ndemocratic Palestinian state to be established”.\r\nThe Palestinians, through their representative, the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization, embraced the road\r\nmap and believes it offers another opportunity to end\r\nthe conflict. We hope that the Quartet will seriously\r\nassume the noble task of implementing the objectives\r\nof the road map.\r\nActs of State terrorism were Israel’s response to\r\nthe performance-based road map. To be more specific,\r\na 2,000-pound bomb was dropped after the Palestinians\r\nscrupulously observed an unofficial ceasefire. Israel\r\nstill adheres to the 14 reservations it had regarding the\r\nroad map. The nebulous ideas and intentions revealed\r\nin the exchange of letters between President Bush and\r\nPrime Minister Sharon on the matter of the\r\ncommitment to the road map are far from encouraging\r\nand keep the road map and Security Council resolution\r\n1515 (2003) in limbo if not completely neglecting and\r\nrejecting them.\r\nIn his letter of assurance dated 14 April 2004 to\r\nPrime Minister Sharon, President Bush reiterates that\r\n“the United States supports the establishment of a\r\nPalestinian state that is viable, contiguous,\r\nsovereign, and independent, so that the\r\nPalestinian people can build their own future in\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\naccordance with … the path set forth in the\r\nroadmap”.\r\nHowever, when President Bush addresses the\r\nreality on the ground, he assures Israel that “it is\r\nunrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status\r\nnegotiations will be a full and complete return to the\r\narmistice lines of 1949”.\r\nHe admits that as part of a final peace settlement,\r\nIsrael must have secure and recognized borders, which\r\nshould emerge from negotiations between the parties in\r\naccordance with United Nations Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). However,\r\nMr. Bush and Mr. Sharon do not topographically\r\nidentify the secure and recognized borders of Israel.\r\nIn the aforementioned letter of assurance,\r\nPresident Bush stresses that the United States is\r\nstrongly committed to Israel’s security and well-being\r\nas a Jewish State. He does not concern himself with the\r\nsecurity of the so-called provisional State of Palestine.\r\nHe seems to be oblivious to the fact that 20 per cent of\r\nthe citizens of Israel are non-Jewish and that Israel has\r\nnot as yet defined who is a Jew. This concept will\r\ninevitably lead to the creation of a racist society within\r\nthe Israeli political entity.\r\nTo ensure the success of the road map and the\r\nachievement of its goal — a final and comprehensive\r\nsettlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by 2005 —\r\nthe plan also requires that Israel “freezes all settlement\r\nactivity” and “withdraws from Palestinian areas\r\noccupied from 28 September 2000”.\r\nCommenting on the meeting between\r\nPresident Bush and Prime Minister Sharon,\r\nJavier Solana, European Union High Representative for\r\nthe Common Foreign and Security Policy, stated on\r\n15 April 2004:\r\n“The EU remains firmly committed to a\r\nnegotiated settlement resulting in two viable,\r\nsovereign and independent States … as the only\r\nway to achieve a permanent peace and an end to\r\nthe occupation that began in 1967, in the\r\nframework of a comprehensive peace in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\n“EU heads of State or Government recently\r\nindicated that they would not recognize any\r\nchange to the pre-1967 borders other than those\r\narrived at by agreement between the parties. A\r\npermanent settlement must also include an\r\nagreed, just, fair and realistic solution to the\r\nrefugee issue”.\r\nIn order further to deviate from the direct route to\r\nthe targeted destination, Sharon declared that he was\r\nabsolutely determined to carry out disengagement in\r\nGaza despite the political problems within his own\r\nparty, the Likud. Indeed, the party believes that\r\ndisengagement conflicts with the Zionist aim of the\r\ncreeping annexation of Palestinian territory. Sharon’s\r\nplan creates a situation in which Israel will have to\r\nleave the settlements but will still control everything\r\nthat enters and exits Gaza. It will tightly seal off Gaza\r\nand block the only outlet that allows Palestinians in\r\nGaza to cross into and from neighbouring Egypt.\r\nAll of this is a source of concern for the\r\ninternational community, as reflected in the number of\r\nmeetings held by the General Assembly. Israel did not\r\nheed the request by the Assembly in resolution\r\nES-10/14, which, by necessity, called for an advisory\r\nopinion by the International Court of Justice on the\r\nfollowing question:\r\n“What are the legal consequences arising\r\nfrom the construction of the wall being built by\r\nIsrael, the occupying Power, in the occupied\r\nPalestinian territory, including in and around East\r\nJerusalem, as described in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General, considering the rules and\r\nprinciples of international law, including the\r\nFourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant\r\nSecurity Council and General Assembly\r\nresolutions?”\r\nThe General Assembly, by an overwhelming\r\nmajority of 150 votes, acknowledged the Court’s\r\nadvisory opinion of 9 July 2004. The representatives of\r\nthe Governments of the United States of America and\r\nof Israel were among the six countries that voted\r\nagainst.\r\nI wish to avail myself of this opportunity to\r\nexpress our great appreciation for the learned opinion\r\nof the judges. I wish to quote from the opinion, as it is\r\nof direct relevance to the General Assembly:\r\n“All States are under an obligation not to\r\nrecognize the illegal situation resulting from the\r\nconstruction of the wall and not to render aid or\r\nassistance in maintaining the situation created by\r\nsuch construction;\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.13\r\n“… The United Nations, and especially the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council,\r\nshould consider what further action is required to\r\nbring to an end the illegal situation resulting from\r\nthe construction of the wall and the associated\r\nregime, taking due account of the present\r\nadvisory opinion.”\r\nIn order to restore faith and confidence in the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations and its Charter, I\r\nwould appeal that the opinion of the Court be heeded\r\nand that action-oriented resolutions, including concrete\r\nmechanisms for implementation, be adopted and\r\ncarried out.\r\nThe Palestinian people and leadership have\r\ndemonstrated goodwill and accepted in good faith the\r\nprovisions of the road map and other proposals leading\r\nto the termination of the Israeli occupation of our\r\nPalestinian territory, so that we in the Middle East can\r\nall live in peace and security and stability. What is\r\nneeded is for the other party, Israel, to commit itself to\r\nrespond, in word and in deed.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
