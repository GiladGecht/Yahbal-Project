(Gabon)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Kafando\r\n(Burkina Faso), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Anote Tong, President of the\r\nRepublic of Kiribati\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of\r\nthe Republic of Kiribati.\r\nMr. Anote Tong, President of the Republic of\r\nKiribati, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency\r\nMr. Anote Tong, President of the Republic of Kiribati,\r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Tong: It is with great pleasure that I\r\nbring warm greetings from the Government and people\r\nof Kiribati on whose behalf I have the honour to\r\naddress the Assembly today.\r\nBefore I begin, I would like to extend our\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Jean Ping on his election to the\r\npresidency of the fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly. We have every confidence in his able\r\nleadership to guide the work of the Assembly and to\r\ndeliver conclusive outcomes. He has our full support\r\nand cooperation in carrying out his work. I wish also to\r\nthank the President’s predecessor for the excellent\r\nwork he has done in steering the work of the Assembly\r\nduring the past year. My congratulations also go to the\r\nSecretary-General for his sterling leadership of our\r\nOrganization during these trying times and for rising\r\ncommendably to the challenge.\r\nWe gather again this year amidst the reality of\r\ndaunting challenges that continue to confront us as\r\nindividual nations and as a global community. The\r\nongoing conflicts in Iraq and other parts of the world,\r\nthe scourge of terrorism and the existence of nuclear\r\narsenals, accelerated environmental degradation and\r\nthe threat of global warming and sea-level rise, hunger\r\nand poverty, the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other non-\r\ncommunicable diseases, the marginalization of the\r\nleast developed countries within the global economy\r\nand underdevelopment, all continue to pose major\r\nchallenges that our Organization must address today.\r\nThose challenges cast a dark shadow over the\r\ncommitments made by world leaders at the Millennium\r\nSummit held here in New York four years ago,\r\npledging to work collectively to maintain peace and\r\nsecurity, to eliminate poverty and to promote\r\ndevelopment for the benefit of all mankind in the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\r\nand the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons\r\ncontinue to threaten international security. We must be\r\nunified in our approach and address those challenges\r\neffectively by strengthening multilateral disarmament\r\nand non-proliferation treaties and agreements and\r\nthrough closer regional and international cooperation.\r\nKiribati supports all non-proliferation efforts and in\r\nthat respect is party to, among others, the Treaty on the\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention.\r\nWe commend and support the work of the\r\ninternational community and efforts taken at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels to respond to\r\nthe challenges of terrorism, recognizing the need for\r\ninternational solidarity in addressing that increasing\r\nglobal threat.\r\nKiribati is committed to the global fight against\r\nterrorism. Terrorism knows no boundaries and we\r\ncannot claim immunity from it. Indeed, as a small\r\nisland developing State we have very little capacity to\r\ndevelop any effective countermeasures and are\r\ntherefore especially vulnerable to terrorism.\r\nWe acknowledge the importance of complying\r\nwith United Nations resolutions and international\r\nsecurity arrangements that have been adopted in the\r\nfight against terrorism. While we cannot afford to be\r\ncomplacent in our efforts in that regard, it must be\r\nrecognized that the requirements for compliance with\r\nthose resolutions and arrangements do pose enormous\r\nchallenges for countries such as Kiribati. Our limited\r\nresources and technical capacity are already committed\r\nto providing for the basic and essential social and\r\neconomic needs of our rapidly growing population,\r\nthus placing severe constraints on our ability to make\r\nprogress in compliance. I would like to note, however,\r\nthat, with technical assistance from our development\r\npartners, we have made progress in enacting important\r\nlegislation relating to terrorism and transnational\r\ncrime. We expect to make further progress on\r\ncompliance with the counter-terrorism requirements\r\nshortly.\r\nThe progress made so far has revolved primarily\r\naround the introduction of legislation. We recognize\r\nthat this is just the beginning of the process. The\r\nimplementation and enforcement of the legislation\r\nenacted will pose an immense challenge. In this\r\nrespect, we will continue to count on the assistance and\r\nsupport of the international community.\r\nWe note with deep regret and concern the loss of\r\nlife and devastation to property caused by the recent\r\nseries of hurricanes affecting the Caribbean and the\r\nAtlantic coast of the United States. We offer our deep\r\nsympathy to those affected by those natural disasters.\r\nThe adverse impact of climate change and sea-\r\nlevel rise is, indeed, a critical security issue for the\r\nglobal community in this new millennium, especially\r\nfor low-lying island States like Kiribati. That issue\r\nmust take centre stage with other international security\r\nissues. We urge the international community to agree\r\non a unified global response in order to better protect\r\nthe environment, in the same way that the international\r\ncommunity is being encouraged to respond to terrorism\r\nand other threats to global security. Our inability as a\r\nglobal community to agree on a unified stand on\r\nclimate change and sea-level rise is very disappointing\r\nindeed, and we deplore the notion that economic\r\ngrowth must take precedence over environmental\r\nissues at any cost. Our very existence as a State —\r\nindeed, the existence all States similar to Kiribati — is\r\nat stake if such thinking continues to prevail.\r\nI would like at this juncture to express our\r\ngratitude to the many countries that have ratified the\r\nKyoto Protocol and to appeal to those that have not to\r\ndo so as a matter of urgency. We have demonstrated\r\nremarkable solidarity in the fight against global\r\nterrorism. Can we not demonstrate the same solidarity\r\nin the fight against climate change and sea-level rise?\r\nRegional cooperation has been a very effective\r\nmechanism in addressing the many challenges faced by\r\ncountries in our region. Regional cooperation has\r\nenabled many Pacific countries to meet some of the\r\ncounter-terrorism requirements. Regional cooperation\r\nhas also enabled us to effectively address emerging\r\nissues confronting our region; the outstanding success\r\nof the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands\r\nis a clear demonstration of that.\r\nWe in the Pacific are confident of our ability to\r\nsteer a course for the future. We have approved work to\r\ncommence on a Pacific plan that will promote\r\ncollective action in the areas of security, good\r\ngovernance, economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. We envisage that the Pacific plan will\r\nresult in the delivery of tangible benefits to our\r\nrespective peoples and communities.\r\nWe recognize the need for, and welcome,\r\nstrengthened cooperation and the development of\r\ncloser linkages and partnerships between the United\r\nNations and its specialized agencies and other\r\norganizations, including the Pacific Islands Forum.\r\nSuch linkages and partnerships can only result in the\r\nmore effective, coordinated and harmonized delivery of\r\nassistance to member countries.\r\nMaking progress with regard to the development\r\naspirations of our peoples is a high — if not the\r\nhighest — priority for many of us who are here today.\r\nOur national policy objective is to achieve the\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nequitable distribution of development benefits to all\r\nour peoples, based on the principles of good\r\ngovernance. We are committed to the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and are on track in our national efforts to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe Goals have been integrated and\r\nmainstreamed into our national development strategy.\r\nWe are committed to pursuing those goals as the basis\r\nof sustainable development. In this connection, I would\r\nlike to express our appreciation to all our development\r\npartners, who, over the years, have contributed\r\nmeaningfully to the realization of our development\r\naspirations.\r\nWhile we are grateful for the assistance extended\r\nby our development partners, there is scope for us to\r\nachieve more for our peoples — and to do so without\r\ndevelopment assistance. Kiribati has a large exclusive\r\neconomic zone that has an abundant fisheries resource.\r\nThose resources are presently being harvested by\r\nvessels from distant-water fishing nations under license\r\narrangements. However, the return from these licensing\r\narrangements is negligible, at only around 5 per cent of\r\nthe landed value of the catch.\r\nNaturally, we would like to see greater returns\r\nfrom that resource. Our ability to achieve sustainable\r\neconomic development depends on it. Accordingly, we\r\nurge the flag States of those fishing interests to\r\nencourage their industries to explore the mutual\r\nbenefits to be gained from collaboration with resource\r\nowners in establishing on-shore facilities that will add\r\nvalue to the commodity. We believe that such a model\r\nwill also result in easing the pressure on fish stocks\r\nand ensure conservation of the resource for the\r\nsustainable benefit of mankind.\r\nThe entry into force in June this year of the\r\nWestern and Central Pacific Tuna Convention\r\nrepresents a major development in the management of\r\nthe western and central Pacific tuna fishery.\r\nIn this age of rapid globalization, advances in\r\ninformation technology and trade liberalization, it is\r\nregrettable that, while some are reaping the full\r\nbenefits of those advances and developments,\r\nsignificantly more remain on the fringes. The reality is\r\nthat a large proportion of the world’s population, most\r\nof whom live in developing countries, continue to live\r\nin poverty and are marginalized in trading\r\narrangements and market access opportunities. The\r\npromise of globalization and open trading as a positive\r\nforce for economic growth, and social progress\r\ncontinues to elude the many. Much work needs to be\r\ndone to ensure that the many also enjoy the benefits of\r\nglobalization.\r\nKiribati supports the findings of the report of the\r\nWorld Commission on the Social Dimension of\r\nGlobalization. We urge that the findings of the report\r\nbe taken into consideration and incorporated into the\r\nwork of the Assembly, especially for the 2005 high-\r\nlevel review of the outcome of the Millennium\r\nSummit.\r\nWe welcome the United Nations support for the\r\nconvening, early next year in Mauritius, of the\r\nInternational Meeting for the 10-Year Review of the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. Like\r\nother small island developing States, we attach great\r\nimportance to that review. With the continued support\r\nand commitment of our development partners to the\r\nprocess, we can be assured of important outcomes that\r\nwill go a long way in making a real difference to the\r\nquality of life for our peoples.\r\nWe share the concerns of the international\r\ncommunity about the spread of HIV/AIDS and its\r\ndevastating impact as both a health crisis and a\r\ndevelopment concern. We welcome the recent\r\ndevelopments in the search for affordable drugs for\r\nHIV/AIDS victims in developing countries. We\r\nencourage greater collaboration on HIV/AIDS research\r\nand the mobilization of resources for prevention\r\nactivities and for better medical care for affected\r\npatients.\r\nWe believe in the continuing relevance and\r\nimportance of the role of the United Nations and its\r\nability to respond to the challenges of our\r\ncontemporary world. In this regard, Kiribati welcomes\r\nand fully supports the efforts to reform this\r\nOrganization to enable it to better respond to the\r\nchallenges of this era.\r\nGiven the crucial role of the Security Council in\r\nthe promotion of international peace and security and\r\nthe importance we attach to that issue, we see the\r\nnecessity for Security Council reform, including the\r\nexpansion of both the permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembership of the Council. Expansion is required to\r\nbetter reflect the realities of our world today. We note\r\nthat some countries, including Japan, have consistently\r\ncommitted substantial resources towards the\r\nmaintenance of global peace and security, and we\r\nbelieve that they should be accorded permanent\r\nmembership on the Security Council.\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nWe attach great importance to our membership in\r\nthis noble Organization, and we reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to upholding the noble values and\r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations. The Charter epitomizes our hope for\r\nachieving justice and equality and the safeguarding and\r\npromotion of fundamental human rights of all peoples.\r\nWithin that context, we believe that the exclusionary\r\nprinciples applied to Taiwan in its bid for United\r\nNations membership go against the very values and\r\nobjectives of the Charter that we all strive to uphold. In\r\nthis era of tension and conflict we should discard the\r\npresent exclusionary practices and adopt a more\r\nembracing environment where all countries willing and\r\nable to contribute to the international community’s\r\nefforts to promote world peace and stability are\r\nwelcomed as equal partners. Taiwan has made and\r\ncontinues to make notable contributions to the\r\ndevelopment of many developing countries and has the\r\ncapacity to contribute constructively to the good work\r\nof the United Nations. It is therefore regrettable that\r\nthe desire of the 23 million people of Taiwan to again\r\nbecome a part of that global community of nations\r\ncontinues to be rejected.\r\nThe challenges that confront us at this point in\r\ntime are indeed daunting, but they are not\r\ninsurmountable. With renewed commitments and with\r\na common resolve to work in close cooperation and in\r\nsupport of each other, we can succeed in creating a\r\nmore secure, a more prosperous and a more just world\r\nfor all in this millennium.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Kiribati for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Anote Tong, President of the Republic of\r\nKiribati, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Fabio Berardi, Minister for\r\nForeign and Political Affairs of the Republic of San\r\nMarino.\r\nMr. Berardi (San Marino) (spoke in Italian;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): At the outset,\r\nI would like to express my great and profound\r\nsatisfaction for the recent release of four hostages\r\nkidnapped in Iraq, among them a young woman whose\r\nmother is a San Marino national engaged in\r\nhumanitarian activities for the Iraqi civilian population.\r\nOn behalf of the Government of San Marino I wish\r\nwholeheartedly to thank the Government of Italy,\r\nwhich played an active role in the release, as well as all\r\nof those who made that release possible.\r\nOn behalf of the Government of the Republic of\r\nSan Marino I wish to congratulate Mr. Jean Ping,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Gabon, on his election\r\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession. I also wish to thank the outgoing President,\r\nMr. Julian Hunte, for the total commitment and\r\ndetermination he showed in his work.\r\nUnited Nations activities have thus far been\r\ncrucial in reducing conflicts between States. However,\r\nalthough the number of international conflicts has\r\ndecreased, mankind is still facing new threats, which\r\ncan only be tackled multilaterally. So that it can\r\ncontinue to serve the international community, the\r\nUnited Nations should be given more effective tools to\r\nenhance mediation and peaceful settlement of disputes,\r\npreventive control, verification, planning and use of\r\nsanctions, in order to prevent the outbreak of warfare\r\nand to promote disarmament and arms control.\r\nMoreover, the United Nations must receive adequate\r\nsupport so that it can better meet the growing number\r\nof requests for peacekeeping operations in various\r\nregions of the world. In that context, we appreciate the\r\nresults obtained so far, but the process requires a\r\nstronger will on behalf of our Governments to comply\r\nwith international rules and implement a concrete and\r\neffective cooperation regime.\r\nIn line with relevant international standards, San\r\nMarino has recently passed a special law to combat\r\nterrorism and associated crimes. It is also actively\r\ncooperating with the two United Nations anti-terrorism\r\ncommittees established pursuant to Security Council\r\nresolutions 1267 (1999) and 1373 (2001).\r\nSince the tragic 11 September attacks on the\r\nUnited States of America, the international community\r\nhas become aware of the seriousness of the threat of\r\nterrorism. Recurrent dramatic events worldwide, the\r\nviolent attacks perpetrated in Iraq — not only against\r\nsoldiers but also civilians, the media and, most\r\nrecently, even volunteers of non-governmental\r\norganization humanitarian missions — force our\r\ncountries to realize the full scope of this phenomenon\r\nand its proliferation, and the need to search for a\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\ncommon and effective response based on a stronger\r\njoint commitment.\r\nThe horrifying terrorist act carried out in Ossetia\r\nagainst hundreds of innocents and so many children\r\ndemonstrates that the widespread strategy of fear,\r\nhatred and devastation is humanly and ethically\r\nunacceptable.\r\nSan Marino once again condemns any form of\r\nterrorism, the most serious and impending threat to\r\npeace, for which there can be neither explanation nor\r\njustification. We support the search for constructive\r\nsolutions that promote dialogue and mutual\r\nunderstanding among peoples of different cultures and\r\nreligions with a view to the dissemination of an\r\nincreasingly shared culture of peace and cooperation\r\nthat will help to reject violence and oppression.\r\nThe Government of San Marino avails itself of\r\nthis opportunity to express its special thanks to the\r\nSpecial Adviser to the Secretary-General, Mr. Lakhdar\r\nBrahimi, who contributed to the establishment of an\r\nIraqi interim Government, and renews its support to\r\nPrime Minister Allawi for the forthcoming democratic\r\nelections scheduled for January 2005. The elections\r\nwill surely be a milestone for the Iraqi people in the\r\nexercise of their sovereignty.\r\nWe trust that the international community will\r\nhelp to achieve national reconciliation in Iraq, on the\r\nbasis of Security Council resolution 1546 (2004) of\r\n8 June, with regard to independence, security and\r\nlegality. Despite the tragic attack on its headquarters in\r\nBaghdad last year, the United Nations can continue to\r\nplay a key role in Iraq, especially at a time when the\r\nsituation has become extremely complex and delicate,\r\nparticularly from a human and political point of view.\r\nAnother major source of concern and\r\ndisappointment for San Marino is the persistence of the\r\nMiddle East crisis, which remains unsolved despite the\r\nefforts made by the United Nations to encourage\r\ndialogue and indispensable mediation.\r\nTo achieve the ultimate goal of legitimate,\r\npeaceful and safe coexistence of two States, Israel and\r\nPalestine, the political process outlined in the road map\r\nand supported by the international community still\r\nappears to be the only viable solution. Therefore, on\r\nbehalf of the San Marino Government, I reiterate, as I\r\nrecently expressed to both the Foreign Ministers of\r\nIsrael and Palestine, our sincere hope that such a\r\nprocess will soon resume.\r\nWith regard to the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, the position of the Republic of San Marino is\r\nwell known. We favour an increase in the number of\r\nnon-permanent members, in the most appropriate way,\r\nand of the gradual restriction of the right of veto, with\r\na view to its eventual elimination. Indeed, the increase\r\nof the number of permanent seats and the extension of\r\nthe right of veto would entail, in our view, a greater\r\ninjustice through the perpetuation of privileges, the\r\nconsolidation of discrimination within United Nations\r\nMember States, and it would limit the power of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to elect the most suitable candidates\r\nin accordance with differing historical periods.\r\nThe Government of San Marino fully endorses\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 58/316, adopted on 1 July\r\n2004, relating to the revitalization of the work of the\r\nAssembly itself. Similarly, we are satisfied with\r\nresolution 58/314, adopted on the same day, granting\r\nthe Holy See wider and more incisive prerogatives as\r\nan Observer.\r\nThe safeguarding of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, together with full respect for\r\nfreedom, equality and democracy, have always been\r\nessential elements in the history of San Marino, and\r\nrepresent the very basis of its 1,700-year existence.\r\nThese issues continue to regulate relations with other\r\nStates and with international organizations. It is in this\r\nspirit that I express my best wishes once again to\r\nMs. Louise Arbour, the recently appointed United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nSan Marino firmly believes in the role of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) and has recently\r\nsupported the draft ICC/United Nations relationship\r\nagreement and the setting up of an ICC liaison office in\r\nNew York.\r\nMy country remains strongly committed to the\r\ncampaign for the universal abolition of the death\r\npenalty, and it has recently ratified the Second\r\nOptional Protocol to the International Covenant on\r\nCivil and Political Rights on the abolition of the death\r\npenalty.\r\nThe recent signature and ratification by San\r\nMarino of the United Nations Convention on the\r\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\r\nWomen has been followed by a law granting full\r\ngender equality in the transmission of San Marino\r\ncitizenship to children. Moreover, the Government has\r\nsubsequently established for the first time in history a\r\nMinistry for Equal Opportunity.\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nAs 2004 is the International Year of the Family,\r\nwe hope that as many countries as possible will follow\r\nSan Marino in signing the two Optional Protocols to\r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child, which are\r\non the involvement of children in armed conflict; and\r\non the sale of children, child prostitution and child\r\npornography. In addition, San Marino recently ratified\r\nthe 1993 Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption,\r\nthus starting a wide debate domestically on joint\r\nparental custody in case of parental separation.\r\nEqual attention is being paid by my country to the\r\nmost disadvantaged members of our families and\r\nsocieties and to the issue of the increasing ageing of\r\nthe population, observed especially in developed\r\ncountries. Against this background, our Government\r\nhas been working to strengthen existing support\r\ninfrastructures and assistance to families.\r\nWe sincerely hope soon to reach an agreement on\r\nthe final text of an international convention on the\r\npromotion and protection of the rights and dignity of\r\ndisabled people.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nSan Marino also wishes to underline the\r\nrelevance of the objectives set forth in the Monterrey\r\nConsensus, especially considering that 14 million\r\npeople, including 6 million children, are still dying of\r\nstarvation. One billion people have no access to\r\npotable water, and 3 billion human beings do not\r\nreceive adequate medical care.\r\nYet, poverty eradication cannot be implemented\r\nwithout respect for the ecosystem. In this regard, a\r\nvaluable instrument to develop and protect our\r\nenvironment is, in our opinion, the Convention to\r\nCombat Desertification, recently ratified by San\r\nMarino, along with a view to actively participate in the\r\nInternational Decade for Action, “Water for Life”,\r\n2005-2015.\r\nIn accordance with the objectives of health for\r\nall, San Marino recently ratified the World Health\r\nOrganization Framework Convention on Tobacco\r\nControl and reiterates its support to the implementation\r\nof the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, with\r\nthe awareness that the spreading of new epidemics\r\nrequires stronger international cooperation.\r\nOn this important occasion, year after year\r\nmeeting and exchanging views as representatives of\r\nour respective Governments, we express deeper and\r\ndeeper concern and frustration vis-à-vis the many\r\nthreats severely affecting humankind and possibly\r\njeopardizing our common future.\r\nYet, the ideals and principles we reaffirmed in the\r\nMillennium Declaration are still the highest benchmark\r\nto guide our efforts, both within our own States and\r\nwithin the work of the United Nations. We need to\r\ninstil hope and actualize our universal aspirations to\r\npeace, cooperation and development.\r\nTo this end, let me express my best and warmest\r\nwishes to you, Mr. President, to the Secretary-General,\r\nto all United Nations officials and to all our countries.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to Her Royal Highness Princess Hajah Masna,\r\nSpecial Envoy of Brunei Darussalam.\r\nPrincess Hajah Masna (Brunei Darussalam): I\r\nwould like to extend my warmest congratulations to\r\nyou, Sir, on your election as the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. My\r\ndelegation wishes to assure you of its full support and\r\ncooperation during your tenure of office. I also express\r\nmy appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte,\r\nfor his leadership and tireless work over the past year.\r\nI also extend my appreciation to Mr. Kofi Annan\r\nand his staff for their continuous hard work and\r\ncommitment. The Secretary-General’s personal\r\ndedication and leadership in the work of the United\r\nNations, especially his efforts for global peace and\r\nstability, are an inspiration to us all. Those efforts are\r\nall the more necessary in the light of what many of us\r\nhere have described as disturbing world developments.\r\nOn behalf of the Government of Brunei\r\nDarussalam, I wish to extend our sympathy and\r\ncondolences to the Governments and the peoples of the\r\nUnited States and the Caribbean countries for the\r\ndevastation caused by the recent hurricanes.\r\nSince its establishment 59 years ago, the United\r\nNations has achieved much, especially in ensuring\r\ninternational peace and security and creating a stable\r\nand prosperous world. There has not been a world war\r\nsince its inception, and it has had a positive impact in\r\nmany fields, such as peacekeeping, the eradication of\r\nvarious diseases and socio-economic development. We\r\nhighly commend those efforts and value the sacrifices\r\nof those involved.\r\nHowever, the achievements of the United Nations\r\nhave been undermined by increasingly complex\r\ninternational developments. In his annual report on the\r\nwork of the Organization (A/59/1), the Secretary-\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nGeneral stated that the United Nations has been\r\nthrough an extraordinarily challenging year. It was the\r\nyear in which the Iraq war brought the debate on the\r\nUnited Nations role into sharper focus.\r\nMoreover, our Organization is still preoccupied\r\nwith many unresolved issues. Among others, the\r\nPalestinian conflict remains a grave concern. Terrorism\r\nand weapons of mass destruction continue to pose\r\nserious threats. At the same time, poverty,\r\nenvironmental degradation and the spread of disease\r\ncause further misery and hardship for millions. Those\r\nissues demand our effective response, which will\r\nultimately define the relevance of our Organization.\r\nWe therefore need more than ever a strong and\r\neffective United Nations, one that is able to promote\r\nworld peace and development. It must also give hope\r\nand purpose to the people who increasingly look to it\r\nto improve their lives.\r\nHowever, the United Nations cannot do all that\r\non its own. For it to carry out its responsibilities\r\neffectively, Member States need to work together,\r\ncontribute resources and honour their commitments. As\r\nwe work collectively to meet today’s complex\r\nchallenges, we must continue to adhere to the\r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter. All the various\r\nconventions and treaties, from nuclear non-\r\nproliferation to environmental conservation, are\r\nmanifestations of how we and the United Nations aim\r\nto protect our people and ensure that they can live to\r\ntheir fullest potential. In that regard, I wish to\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for his address to\r\nthe General Assembly, in which he emphasized the\r\nimportance of those issues. It is through our\r\nreaffirmation of the Charter’s principles that we can\r\neffectively uphold human ideals, enhance security and\r\nstability and promote sustainable development.\r\nWithout doubt, the United Nations is the most\r\nuniversal international body for providing a\r\nmultilateral response. We need to reform the United\r\nNations urgently so that it can be better equipped. In\r\nthat regard, Brunei Darussalam fully supports the\r\nSecretary-General’s efforts to strengthen and revitalize\r\nthe United Nations. In particular, we welcome the work\r\nof the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\r\nChange, which he has set up to address this.\r\nWe believe that United Nations reform should be\r\ncomprehensive and include an expanded and more\r\nrepresentative Security Council, a revitalized role for\r\nthe General Assembly and better coordination among\r\nUnited Nations agencies. The interest a number of\r\ncountries have shown in serving as permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council is a clear indication\r\nof the desire for change.\r\nNext year, the Assembly will consider the report\r\nof the High-level Panel and the recommendations of\r\nthe Secretary-General. I realize how difficult it is to\r\nfind a solution that is acceptable to all, but it is\r\nincumbent upon Member States to make a difference\r\nby implementing the much-needed reforms. Thus, a\r\nwillingness to find a balanced set of proposals will be\r\nnecessary. We look forward to the report, which,\r\nhopefully, will make the necessary bold and realistic\r\nproposals in order to end the decade-long debate on\r\nthis issue.\r\nNext year will be a critical time for us as we\r\nreview implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. To ensure that the commitments\r\nset forth in the Millennium Declaration are\r\nimplemented on schedule, we must act without delay.\r\nAs for Brunei Darussalam, we are doing our part to\r\nachieve those goals.\r\nAs we begin to look into our agenda for this\r\nsession, we must remain focused on the issues\r\naffecting many innocent lives in Palestine. Recent\r\ndevelopments, such as the illegal construction of the\r\nwall in the occupied Palestinian territories, must be\r\nstopped and reversed. The advisory opinion of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice and the subsequent\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution ES-10/15 reflect the\r\ninternational community’s overwhelming support for\r\nending injustice in the occupied territories.\r\nThe concerned parties must do all they can to\r\nprevent the situation from deteriorating. They must\r\nmake serious efforts to honour their obligations as\r\noutlined in the road map. It is critical that progress\r\nshould be made so that we can find a comprehensive,\r\njust and durable solution to that longstanding conflict.\r\nThe situation in other parts of the Middle East,\r\nsuch as Iraq, has created enormous anxiety. We\r\nacknowledge the central role of the United Nations and\r\nthe efforts of other countries and parties in addressing\r\nthe political and humanitarian dimensions of the\r\nproblems.\r\nIn our region, we recognize that the nuclear issue\r\non the Korean peninsula has a serious impact on the\r\npeace, stability and security of the Asian-Pacific\r\nregion. We appreciate the role of China, the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, Japan, the\r\nRepublic of Korea, Russia and the United States in\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nseeking a solution through dialogue in the six-party\r\ntalks. It is important that all parties concerned continue\r\ntheir efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to the issue.\r\nWe are deeply saddened by the horrifying scenes\r\nof harm inflicted upon innocent people by terrorist\r\nacts. Brunei Darussalam would like to convey its great\r\nsympathy to the Governments and the peoples of the\r\ncountries in Asia, the Middle East and Europe that\r\nhave been targeted by terrorist attacks in the past year.\r\nWe strongly condemn those atrocious acts.\r\nTerrorism affects all of us — women and men,\r\nadults and children, developed and developing\r\ncountries. It knows no boundaries. It has no ethnic,\r\nracial or religious affinities. Despite concerted efforts,\r\ndevastating incidents this year have heightened the\r\nthreats and challenges posed by terrorism. Those acts\r\nare becoming more complex, and our fight against\r\nthem is far from over. It is therefore important to\r\naddress this problem in a comprehensive manner. In\r\ndoing so, we need to identify this problem’s real source\r\nand root causes. This is what we have to bear in mind\r\nif we are to achieve a long-term solution. At the same\r\ntime, we must not allow terrorists to divide us and\r\nundermine our determination to fight this menace\r\ncollectively.\r\nThe challenges that we face require us to move\r\nforward to ensure that the United Nations continues to\r\nplay its pivotal role. I am confident, Mr. President, that\r\nunder your able leadership, the General Assembly will\r\nachieve success and make the decisions necessary to\r\nfulfil the hopes and expectations of the peoples it\r\nrepresents. Our tasks are great, but so also are our\r\ncapabilities when we all work together.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Prakash Sharan Mahat,\r\nMinister of State for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of\r\nNepal.\r\nMr. Mahat (Nepal): Allow me to congratulate\r\nyou, Mr. President, on your well-deserved election to\r\npreside over the fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly. I assure you of my delegation’s full\r\ncooperation in the discharge of your important duties.\r\nAllow me to also pay tribute to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Julian R. Hunte, Minister for External Affairs of\r\nSaint Lucia, for his outstanding leadership in the\r\nAssembly’s last session. Our full appreciation goes to\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\r\ninvaluable and wise stewardship of the United Nations.\r\nI also wish to express, on behalf of His Majesty’s\r\nGovernment and the people of Nepal, our sincere\r\ncondolences to the Governments, countries and peoples\r\nthat have suffered the consequences of hurricanes and\r\nterrorist attacks in recent weeks and months.\r\nWe live in one of the most turbulent periods since\r\nthe Second World War. The end of the cold war\r\nunleashed forces of democracy and economic\r\nopenness, and the revolution in science, and\r\ntechnology has converted the world into a global\r\nvillage by shrinking distances and increasing\r\nconnectivity. In tandem with this came many negative\r\nconsequences. Internal conflicts have proliferated and\r\npopulations have been displaced. International\r\nterrorism has increased. Globalization has widened the\r\ngap between the rich and the poor. Poverty, ignorance,\r\ndisease and injustice have persisted and even worsened\r\nfor the majority of humanity. Transnational crimes\r\nhave spread their wings. No country is immune from\r\nthe impact of these huge problems facing humanity\r\ntoday. Addressing these problems is a challenge that\r\nrequires collective action by the international\r\ncommunity in a spirit of multilateralism. The United\r\nNations has the legitimacy and mandate to promote\r\nmultilateral solutions to the shared problems of our\r\ntime.\r\nIndeed, the United Nations embodies all of\r\nhumanity’s shared dreams and its hopes for peace,\r\nsecurity and development. Nepal has abiding faith in\r\nthe principles and objectives enshrined in the United\r\nNations Charter, and we recognize the central role of\r\nthe United Nations in the pursuit of those shared\r\ndreams.\r\nThe emerging international situation is fraught\r\nwith a multitude of challenges. Internal conflicts have\r\nafflicted countries from Iraq to Burundi and from Haiti\r\nto the Sudan. Terrorism has become a global menace,\r\ncasting a dark shadow over the lives of millions of\r\npeople around the globe. Deadly weapons pose a\r\nconstant threat to the safety of human beings and the\r\nvery existence of human civilization.\r\nBy all accounts, the situation in Iraq is highly\r\nvolatile and extremely dangerous. The Nepalese people\r\nhave yet to overcome their revulsion over the brutal\r\nkilling of 12 innocent Nepalese hostages on 31 August\r\nin that country. We strongly condemn this dastardly\r\ncrime committed by the terrorists. It is our fervent hope\r\nthat the Iraqi people will be able to improve their\r\nsecurity environment, hold the scheduled elections on\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\ntime and live in a free, secure, democratic and\r\nprosperous Iraq.\r\nThe Middle East is caught in a cycle of violence.\r\nTo break this cycle, both Israel and Palestine will have\r\nto exercise maximum restraint and engage in fruitful\r\ndialogue to build the mutual confidence critical for\r\nimplementing the Quartet-endorsed road map, which\r\noffers a viable and durable two-State solution. Nepal\r\nsupports the road map and views the Israeli plan to pull\r\nout of Gaza as a positive step.\r\nThough the security situation has improved over\r\ntime, Afghanistan is far from secure, and its\r\nreconstruction is far from satisfactory. The world\r\ncommunity must do more to provide security to the\r\nentire country, hold free and fair elections and\r\naccelerate the speed of its reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nNepal supports United Nations efforts to bring\r\npeace and normalcy to Haiti, Burundi, Liberia, Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nthe Sudan. We are proud to be part of United Nations\r\nefforts in our own humble way in those countries by\r\ndeploying our troops. The world community ought to\r\nsustain those efforts and help those countries in their\r\nrebuilding and reconstruction endeavours.\r\nNepal’s track record is a testimony to its\r\nunflinching commitment to United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. So far, over 45,000 Nepalese\r\npeacekeepers have served in various missions in an\r\noutstanding manner, and 47 of them have sacrificed\r\ntheir precious lives in the service of peace and\r\nhumanity. At the moment, nearly 2,500 Nepalese blue\r\nhelmets are deployed in 12 peacekeeping missions\r\naround the world.\r\nNepal appreciates the United Nations help in\r\nbridging the equipment gaps for our deployment. We\r\nurge the United Nations to enrich and widen the scope\r\nof consultations with troop-contributing countries,\r\nincluding in the areas of mission planning and pre-\r\ndeployment preparations. We urge the United Nations\r\nto give greater opportunities to Nepalese nationals in\r\nmanagement positions in the Secretariat and in field\r\nmissions.\r\nAs we remain committed to peacekeeping and\r\nwilling to bring our experience to the table, Nepal has\r\nsought a non-permanent seat on the Security Council\r\nfor the period 2007-2008, after a gap of 19 years. I take\r\nthis opportunity to appeal to Member States to give us\r\nthe privilege of their support in the election to be held\r\nin 2006.\r\nIt is our firm belief that the international\r\ncommunity must look beyond the immediate conflicts\r\nand seek to build a strong foundation for durable peace\r\nby pursuing disarmament, development and the rule of\r\nlaw.\r\nNepal is deeply concerned by the setback in the\r\ndisarmament realm. Of course, the non-proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction is very important to\r\nkeeping such weapons from rogue elements. No\r\ndurable peace will be possible without concerted\r\nefforts for disarmament, particularly of nuclear\r\nweapons, as they are the greatest threat to human\r\ncivilization. It is regrettable that the Conference on\r\nDisarmament has had no programme of work for the\r\nlast several years. That body must be allowed to work\r\non a coherent strategy leading to the complete\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons in a time-bound\r\nmanner.\r\nWe reiterate our support to nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzones and to keeping outer space free of such weapons.\r\nThe international community should also work together\r\nto strengthen controls over small arms and light\r\nweapons in order to prevent their abuse by non-State\r\nactors.\r\nRegional centres for peace and disarmament are\r\ninstrumental in building confidence among nations.\r\nNepal is eager to relocate to Kathmandu the Regional\r\nCentre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the\r\nPacific at the earliest possible time. We are prepared to\r\nsign the necessary agreements, consistent with the\r\nprevailing diplomatic practices and provisions of the\r\nother two regional centres. We also want the\r\nKathmandu process revived without delay.\r\nInternational peace and security will continue to\r\nelude us until we address the root causes of conflicts:\r\nnamely, poverty, ignorance, disease, exclusion and\r\ninjustice. Most of the conflicts around the world today,\r\nwhich have regional and global consequences, are\r\nrooted in those sad human conditions. It is imperative\r\nthat we address those conditions collectively for the\r\nshared benefit of humankind as a whole.\r\nToday, more than a billion people live in absolute\r\npoverty. Millions of people remain illiterate.\r\nPreventable diseases are taking a huge toll on children,\r\nand HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are\r\ndecimating entire societies, particularly in Africa.\r\nGrowing populations have caused environmental\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\ndegradation. Racial, cultural and wealth-related\r\ndivisions have often been sources of exclusion,\r\nintolerance and injustice. Poverty has forced many to\r\nmigrate, and crimes have flourished in those sad\r\nconditions.\r\nThere is no doubt that the developing countries\r\nhave the primary responsibility for their own economic\r\ndevelopment and social progress. They need to take\r\nmeasures to reform their policies and institutions and\r\ncreate a climate in which enterprise, innovation and\r\ndevelopment can flourish. Most of those countries have\r\nbeen trying to do that on their own initiative and to live\r\nup to their side of the pledges undertaken in various\r\nglobal compacts.\r\nBut their development partners also have their\r\nobligations to meet under various global compacts,\r\nbecause developing countries, given the mammoth\r\nchallenges they face, cannot grapple with them and\r\nmeet the Millennium Development Goals without\r\nenhanced assistance from their development partners.\r\nThe development partners should meet the agreed\r\nofficial development assistance targets and provide\r\ngreater debt relief to indebted countries. Indeed,\r\nalthough official development assistance flows have\r\nincreased since 2002, they remain way below the\r\nadditional $50 billion per year that is required to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. Debt\r\nrepayment is eating up a large chunk of the resources\r\nof developing countries, and the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries (HIPC) Debt Initiative has yet to cover all\r\nleast developed countries.\r\nIn the long run, fair globalization on a level\r\nplaying field and open markets will help reduce\r\npoverty, increase employment and lift the standard of\r\nliving in developing nations. The development\r\npartners, therefore, should dismantle their agricultural\r\nsubsidies and open their markets to goods and labour\r\nfrom the South. They should also offer assistance to\r\nbuild capacities to attract and absorb foreign direct\r\ninvestment and to remove supply-side constraints,\r\nespecially in least developed nations. The least\r\ndeveloped countries — the most marginalized — need\r\nmore generous assistance and market access, as agreed\r\nto in the Brussels Programme of Action, to break the\r\nvicious circle of poverty and join the global economy.\r\nOur studies have shown that Nepal will not be able to\r\nmeet most Millennium Development Goals without\r\nsuch targeted measures from its development partners.\r\nTheir geographical bottleneck and distance from\r\nthe main corridors of commerce handicap landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries. We urge the transit and\r\ndevelopment partners to implement the Almaty\r\nProgramme of Action and to overcome their\r\ndifficulties.\r\nThough Nepal joined the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) last year, most least developed\r\ncountries remain outside the multilateral trade\r\nframework. We call on the members of the WTO to\r\nfacilitate quick and concessionary memberships for\r\nthose countries. Nepal also urges the international\r\ncommunity to change the international financial\r\narchitecture so as to give a voice to the small and\r\nweak.\r\nNepal believes that democracy, human rights and\r\nthe rule of law will have to go hand in hand with peace\r\nand development to achieve overall progress in a\r\ncountry. It is heartening that more people in the world\r\nenjoy democracy and freedom today than ever before.\r\nSadly, however, conflicts and poverty have driven\r\nmillions of people from their homes and countries.\r\nConflicts, together with criminal gangs, have also\r\nviolated the rule of law and peoples’ human rights.\r\nNew democracies should learn from each other’s\r\nexperiences in consolidating democratic institutions\r\nand values, and the world community should join\r\nhands to fight transnational crime. The rule of law\r\nshould apply not only in domestic situations but also\r\nthroughout the international community.\r\nThere are 17 million refugees around the\r\nworld — a staggering number. Many more millions of\r\npersons are internally displaced. In many areas, those\r\npeople live in fear and under appalling conditions.\r\nChildren are deprived of a decent education, and adults\r\nlack jobs and economic opportunities. In some cases,\r\nwhole generations have grown up in refugee camps,\r\nstruggling to find their identity.\r\nThe world community has an obligation to\r\nprovide humanitarian assistance to such needy people\r\nand to help them resettle once they have returned\r\nhome.\r\nNearly 100,000 Bhutanese refugees have been\r\nliving in camps in eastern Nepal for over a decade. Our\r\nbilateral efforts to find a negotiated settlement with\r\nBhutan have been slow and halting. Even the refugees\r\nwho have been verified by a joint team have yet to go\r\nback home. Other refugees are waiting for joint\r\nverification.\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nFor generations, Nepal and Bhutan have remained\r\nclose friends and have respected each other. The\r\npresence of Bhutanese refugees on our soil is an\r\navoidable irritant. Therefore, we earnestly hope that\r\nthe process of verification can be expedited, that\r\nverified refugees can be repatriated in a time-bound\r\nmanner, and that returnees will be able to enjoy their\r\nhuman rights and to live in safety, dignity and honour\r\nin their own country.\r\nObviously, Nepal does not have the capacity to\r\ntake care of those refugees, though we have let them\r\nstay on humanitarian grounds. Hence, we call on the\r\ninternational community, including the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR), to continue its support until the refugees are\r\nable to go back home and fully resettle there.\r\nOur situation has become even more difficult due\r\nto the armed violence launched in 1996 by the so-\r\ncalled Maoists. That violent movement began just\r\nwhen democracy was taking root and economic growth\r\nwas accelerating owing to policy reforms. The Maoists\r\nhave brutalized people and destroyed private homes\r\nand public infrastructure worth billions of rupees. They\r\nhave been abducting children and recruiting them as\r\nchild soldiers. They have continued to defy our call to\r\nrespects schools as zones of peace. They are engaged\r\nin extortion and in the intimidation and killing of\r\ninnocent civilians.\r\nThis notwithstanding, His Majesty’s Government\r\nhas been sincerely seeking a results-oriented dialogue\r\nto find a political settlement. At the same time, the\r\nGovernment has an obligation to protect the lives of\r\npeople and to safeguard private property and public\r\ninfrastructure by strengthening security. The\r\nGovernment deeply appreciates the moral and material\r\nsupport our friends have been providing us in the fight\r\nagainst the violence.\r\nIn that context, we sincerely appreciate the\r\ninterest expressed by the Secretary-General in the\r\nsituation in Nepal, and his readiness to help the\r\nGovernment’s efforts towards peace. The four-party\r\ncoalition Government, with its broad mandate, is\r\nworking seriously to initiate the peace process in\r\nNepal. We are confident that we will be able to resolve\r\nthe problem by ourselves.\r\nEven in the midst of this difficulty, His Majesty’s\r\nGovernment is committed to protecting the freedoms\r\nand human rights of citizens. The National Human\r\nRights Commission monitors the human rights\r\nsituation in the country, and a three-year National\r\nHuman Rights Action Plan has been launched to\r\nimplement our human rights commitments.\r\nWe have been seeking technical assistance from\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Human Rights as concerns the capacity-building of\r\nthe National Human Rights Commission. The Human\r\nRights Promotion Centre has been established to\r\nensure inter-departmental coordination and the\r\nsupervision of human rights issues.\r\nThe United Nations is the pivot of multilateralism\r\nthat is imperative to address the complex challenges of\r\nour time. Nepal supports the ongoing efforts for United\r\nNations reform, including those aimed at revitalizing\r\nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. Priority should be accorded to enhancing the\r\nrole of the United Nations in the area of economic and\r\nsocial development. Security Council reform has\r\nbecome an important issue for the international\r\ncommunity. Nepal has consistently supported the\r\nexpansion of the Council and reform of its methods of\r\nwork, so as to make it more representative, transparent\r\nand democratic.\r\nIn that context, the aspirations of some Member\r\nStates — mainly India, Japan, Germany and Brazil —\r\nmerit serious consideration for permanent membership\r\nin the Security Council. At the same time, there is\r\nurgent need to expand the Council’s non-permanent\r\nmembership to ensure greater participation of small\r\nMember States.\r\nNepal hopes the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change appointed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral will come up with recommendations that could\r\nculminate in tangible reforms consistent with the\r\npresent realities of the world. The high-level plenary\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly at the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations will be a landmark\r\nevent that should make a great leap forward on a\r\nnumber of outstanding issues and expedite\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThis fall, Nepal is organizing the Second World\r\nBuddhist Summit in Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord\r\nBuddha and a world heritage site in Nepal. We need\r\nsupport and participation from our friends the Member\r\nStates to make the conference a success and to revive\r\nin New York the international committee for the\r\ndevelopment of Lumbini, which we are planning to do\r\nsoon.\r\nTo conclude, the dawn of the new millennium\r\noffers us both opportunities for and challenges to\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nrevitalizing the United Nations and strengthening\r\nmultilateralism. As an active Member State, Nepal will\r\ndo its best to contribute to the efforts of the United\r\nNations in order to attain the shared goals of peace and\r\nprosperity for all.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Andrei Stratan, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Moldova.\r\nMr. Stratan (Republic of Moldova): At the\r\noutset, I would like to say that I feel very honoured and\r\nprivileged to participate for the first time in the work\r\nof the General Assembly and to represent the Republic\r\nof Moldova at this rostrum.\r\nOn behalf of the Moldovan delegation, I wish to\r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your well deserved\r\nelection. I am confident that your vast experience and\r\ndiplomatic skills will help the Assembly at the current\r\nsession to fulfil its important tasks.\r\nI join other speakers in expressing our gratitude\r\nto your predecessor, Mr. Julian Robert Hunte, for the\r\ndedicated and effective manner in which he guided the\r\nwork of the previous session.\r\nThis has indeed been a difficult year for the\r\nOrganization, with serious crises occurring in various\r\nparts of the world. Increasingly, the international\r\ncommunity is faced with conflicts within States, the\r\npainful manifestations of which have been seen in\r\nconflicts in the Middle East, Africa, the North\r\nCaucasus and elsewhere.\r\nWe are all preoccupied by the implications and\r\nconsequences of the crisis in Iraq. The Republic of\r\nMoldova considers that the United Nations should be\r\nengaged in a more consistent way in helping that\r\ncountry to stabilize its internal situation and to embark\r\non the path towards recovery, development and\r\ndemocracy.\r\nEarlier, in Spain and Turkey and, most recently,\r\nin the Russian Federation, we have seen how\r\nterrorism — the scourge of the twenty-first century —\r\nindiscriminately strikes the innocent, including\r\nchildren. We strongly believe that terrorist acts must be\r\nconsidered crimes against humanity. The Republic of\r\nMoldova strongly condemns all terrorist acts, for\r\nwhich there can be no excuse or justification. We pay\r\nhomage to the victims of that violence.\r\nPrecisely due to the challenges faced, the\r\nRepublic of Moldova fully supports the ongoing reform\r\nprocess of the United Nations system. A key aspect of\r\nthat process is the reform of the Security Council. Too\r\noften, that principal organ has been accused of failures\r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nIt is therefore essential to make it more efficient in the\r\ndischarge of its primary responsibility. In our view, the\r\nefficiency of the Security Council can be achieved by\r\nimproving its representativeness, legitimacy,\r\ntransparency and accountability and by restricting the\r\nright of veto to issues of substance, as provided for by\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova shares the view that the\r\nreform of the United Nations system will be successful\r\nonly if the reform of the Security Council is followed\r\nby the reform of the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. We support the\r\nmomentum created for revitalizing the Assembly and\r\nstrengthening the coordinating functions of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council in the social and\r\neconomic fields. Effective coordination among the\r\nthree main bodies is essential if we want to address\r\ncomprehensively the urgent problems of today’s world.\r\nIn the new circumstances, the United Nations\r\nshould continue to improve its capacity in the field of\r\npeacekeeping, which is an important instrument for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We\r\nsupport actions aimed at enhancing the United Nations\r\nrapid deployment capabilities through its standby\r\narrangements. I would like to mention that Moldova\r\nhas committed itself to contribute troops to the United\r\nNations Standby Arrangements System through\r\nyesterday’s signing at the Department of Peacekeeping\r\nOperations of a formal document in that regard. The\r\nRepublic of Moldova is already present in United\r\nNations peacekeeping efforts, with military observers\r\nand staff officers in United Nations missions in Liberia\r\nand Côte d’Ivoire. We are determined to continue to\r\nsupport United Nations activities in this area.\r\nIt is crucial to further strengthen the United\r\nNations anti-terrorist legal framework. The Republic of\r\nMoldova fully supports the current efforts to conclude\r\na convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear\r\nterrorism and a comprehensive international\r\nconvention on international terrorism.\r\nI would like to commend the Secretary-General\r\nfor his many initiatives to make the Organization more\r\neffective. The creation of the High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change is another important\r\nstep in that direction. Like other Member States, the\r\nRepublic of Moldova looks forward to concrete\r\nrecommendations from the Panel on how to tackle\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\ncontemporary threats, including new ones such as\r\nintra-State conflicts, terrorism and separatism.\r\nWe cannot realistically expect to win the war\r\nagainst international terrorism as long as regional and\r\ninternal conflicts remain unsolved and their root causes\r\nnot properly addressed. Recently, terrorism has\r\nincreasingly been merging with separatism. Many\r\nterrorists and international criminals have found a safe\r\nhaven in the regions affected by internal conflicts and\r\nsecessionist tendencies.\r\nIn this context, I would like to add my voice to\r\nthose who have repeatedly warned in recent years of\r\nthe danger posed by aggressive separatism. Separatism\r\nprovides fertile ground for various extremist forces and\r\nterrorist groups. It has become one of the main sources\r\nof internal conflicts and regional instability. To ignore\r\nit would have tragic consequences for numerous\r\ncountries of a multi-ethnic composition.\r\nRegretfully, separatism continues to be the main\r\nobstacle to consolidating the independence and\r\nstatehood of the Republic of Moldova. Over the years,\r\nthe Republic of Moldova has systematically informed\r\nthe relevant international organizations of the danger\r\nthat the political conflict in its eastern region poses to\r\nregional and international peace and security. The\r\nsettlement of the conflict has become the country’s\r\nabsolute priority. The initiatives put forward by the\r\nRepublic of Moldova in recent years reflect the\r\ndetermination and political will of Moldovan\r\nauthorities to resolve this political conflict peacefully,\r\non the basis of respect for the sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of the country. In particular, I would\r\nlike to underline the initiative of the President of the\r\nRepublic of Moldova, Mr. Vladimir Voronin, on the\r\nestablishment of the Joint Constitutional Commission\r\ncharged with drafting a new constitution.\r\nDespite the constructive approach by Moldovan\r\nauthorities in their dialogue with the self-appointed\r\nTransdniestrian leaders and other participants in the\r\nmultilateral framework of negotiations, developments\r\nhave demonstrated the inefficiency of these\r\nnegotiations. It has also become obvious that the\r\nseparatist leaders do not sincerely wish for the\r\ncountry’s reintegration. In this regard, I should\r\nmention, among other things, the recent closure of\r\nMoldovan schools that use Latin script, the inhumane\r\ntreatment of children and ethnic discrimination.\r\nThis region remains an area rife with the illegal\r\nmanufacture and traffick of arms. Given the porousness\r\nof the Transdniestrian section of the Moldovan-\r\nUkrainian border, there are no guarantees that the\r\nillegally manufactured or trafficked armaments will not\r\nreach other conflicts zones in the future.\r\nWe are also deeply concerned about the human\r\nrights situation in the area controlled by separatist\r\nforces. The separatist regime has systematically\r\nviolated most human rights, including the right of\r\nassociation, the right to a fair trial, freedom from\r\ntorture, freedom of movement and, especially, the right\r\nto education. All of these human rights violations\r\nhinder the democratization process within the region.\r\nAt the same time, we have encountered a biased\r\nattitude on the part of the involved parties, reflected in\r\nthe support for smuggling and in the obvious violations\r\nof existing bilateral and international agreements. We\r\ndeem it necessary to modify the components of the\r\npeacekeeping mechanism and to replace it with a new\r\none under an international mandate.\r\nConsidering that the interests of regional stability\r\nand security require an objective and impartial\r\napproach, it is necessary to ensure full respect for\r\ninternational law and democratic standards. More\r\nimportantly, any geopolitical and geo-economic\r\ninterest in maintaining the status-quo needs to be\r\nabandoned. Strict implementation of the decisions\r\ntaken at the 1999 Istanbul Summit of the Organization\r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe would\r\nharmoniously fit such an approach.\r\nAlso, as has already been mentioned during the\r\ncurrent debate, we must exclude the practice of\r\napplying double standards when dealing with internal\r\nconflicts and the means for their settlement.\r\nThe reintegration of the country and\r\nconsolidation of democratic values within its entire\r\nterritory are essential conditions for the European\r\nintegration of the Republic of Moldova. It is in this\r\ncontext that the President of the Republic of Moldova\r\nhas launched an initiative on a stability and security\r\npact for Moldova. This document is aimed at ensuring\r\nconsensus among the parties concerned, in order to\r\nguarantee the development of an independent,\r\nsovereign and integral Moldovan State. We believe that\r\nholding an international conference on this issue\r\nshould be the next step in initiating the debate on the\r\nmeasures to follow. This situation demonstrates the\r\ninternational character of the problem, as well as the\r\ninefficiency of existing regional settlement\r\nmechanisms.\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nToday, the main challenges for the United\r\nNations in the economic, social and related fields stem\r\nfrom world trends, such as globalization and increasing\r\necological interdependence, and from persistent factors\r\nsuch as widespread poverty and severe social\r\ninequalities between and within States. They should be\r\naddressed by a strengthened global partnership\r\nbetween industrialized countries, developing countries,\r\ncountries with transitional economies and\r\nintergovernmental institutions.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals remain the\r\nmost significant objectives agreed to by the\r\ninternational community, as they cover the areas of\r\nmajor concern for the peoples of the world. It is\r\ntherefore of utmost importance to achieve the Goals, as\r\nwell as other specific developmental targets set\r\nsubsequently by several major United Nations\r\nconferences in the economic and social fields. In this\r\ncontext, we welcome the decision of the General\r\nAssembly, adopted at its last session, to hold in\r\nSeptember 2005 a high-level meeting that will\r\nundertake a comprehensive review of the progress\r\nmade in the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, including the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, as well as a review of the integrated and\r\ncoordinated implementation of the outcomes of the\r\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits.\r\nThis review is necessary, given the overall slow\r\npace of implementation. We share the concerns\r\nexpressed in this respect by many States, in particular\r\nby the countries sponsoring the world leaders’ New\r\nYork Declaration on the Action against Hunger and\r\nPoverty, which was adopted on 20 September. Like\r\nthem, we believe that if resolute and urgent action is\r\nnot taken, the Millennium Development Goals will not\r\nbe reached by 2015 in some regions of the world.\r\nWe should not forget, in this context, about the\r\ngrave social and economic problems that affect crisis-\r\nstricken countries and countries with special needs, in\r\nparticular landlocked countries. Creating an enabling\r\nenvironment for sustainable development is a challenge\r\nfor them and, therefore, they should be further assisted\r\nby the United Nations system and the donor\r\ncommunity.\r\nI would like to reiterate, in conclusion, my\r\ncountry’s commitment to the Organization and its\r\nwillingness to cooperate with other Member States in\r\norder to achieve the noble goals and principles\r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Laurie Chan, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Solomon Islands.\r\nMr. Chan (Solomon Islands): At the outset,\r\nallow me, on behalf of the Government and people of\r\nSolomon Islands, to convey to you our warm and\r\nsincere congratulations on your election as President of\r\nthis session of the United Nations General Assembly.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to your\r\npredecessor, our colleague, the Honourable Julian\r\nHunte, Foreign Minister of Saint Lucia, for his able\r\nand sterling stewardship in making the Assembly’s\r\nfifty-eighth session proactive and responsive to the\r\nchallenges it has faced over the last 12 months.\r\nI also wish to express our deep appreciation to\r\nthe United Nations Secretary-General, His Excellency\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his focused leadership in steering\r\nthe work of the Secretariat through difficult and\r\nsometimes uncharted waters over the past year.\r\nOnly four years into the new millennium, the\r\ncomplexity of ongoing and new challenges has\r\nredefined the international system, resulting in\r\nuncertainty and imbalances in certain parts of the\r\nglobe. Ensuing debates over multilateralism versus\r\nunilateralism in the resolution of crisis situations have\r\nepitomized the complex nature of events during the\r\npast year. This makes the call two years ago by our\r\nSecretary-General for institutional reforms more urgent\r\nnow than ever before.\r\nSolomon Islands looks forward to the\r\nrecommendations of the High-level Panel of Eminent\r\nPersons, in particular, to proposals that will revitalize\r\nand give new momentum to the United Nations. These\r\nreforms must ensure that the United Nations is flexible\r\nand responsive to the needs of our time. To this end,\r\nSolomon Islands fully supports the proposed\r\nenlargement of the Council and reaffirms its call for\r\nJapan and Germany to become permanent members of\r\nthe Council. We believe that the enlargement should\r\naffect both the permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembership categories. It is also our fervent hope and\r\ndesire to see that the Secretariat reflects the diversity\r\nof its membership. In this regard, while it should\r\ncontinue to recruit the best available candidates,\r\nopportunities within the Secretariat must be made\r\navailable to small island countries on the basis of in-\r\ncountry, rather than externally conducted, assessment\r\nexaminations.\r\nAs you are aware, this year the United Nations\r\nfamily marked the tenth anniversary of the ethnic\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\ngenocide in Rwanda. The occasion called on the United\r\nNations to play a more proactive role towards ensuring\r\nthat such tragic events are never allowed to happen\r\nagain.\r\nNo more than four years ago, my own country,\r\nSolomon Islands, experienced the hardship of a\r\nconflict situation when tensions erupted between two\r\nof the many ethnic groups in the country. In response,\r\nSolomon Islands sought assistance from every possible\r\ninstitution, including the Security Council. In this\r\nregard, I am pleased to say that my region, through the\r\nPacific Islands Forum under its security mechanism as\r\nenshrined in the Biketawa Declaration, responded to\r\nthat “911” call.\r\nThe Pacific Islands Forum regional security\r\nmechanism is in harmony with the spirit of Chapter\r\nVIII of the United Nations Charter. The Regional\r\nAssistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), led\r\nby our bigger regional neighbour, Australia, strongly\r\nsupported by New Zealand and other Pacific Islands\r\nForum member countries, went beyond the mere\r\nrestoration of law and order and security. In a spirit of\r\nPacific cooperation and partnership between Solomon\r\nIslands and Pacific Islands Forum member countries, a\r\nlong-term approach of strengthening the country’s\r\nState institutions was set in place, thus allowing the\r\nprocess of healing, reconstruction, rehabilitation and\r\nnation-building to continue the course of unifying the\r\ncountry and its less than half a million, but diverse,\r\ninhabitants, who speak some 80 different local\r\nlanguages.\r\nThe success of the Regional Assistance Mission\r\nto Solomon Islands in promptly stabilizing the country\r\nwithin a period of three months, collecting some 3,700\r\nweapons without a shot being fired, presents a fine\r\nexample of the importance of regional cooperation in\r\nresolving conflict situations. On this note, I wish to pay\r\ntribute to all our Pacific neighbours and to the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), the\r\nCommission for Human Rights, the World Health\r\nOrganization (WHO), the European Union (EU), the\r\nRepublic of China, Japan, the United Kingdom, the\r\nInternational Red Cross and the civil society; they have\r\nassisted and are continuing to assist in the process of\r\nour country’s ongoing recovery and rehabilitation.\r\nI must also underscore my belief and conviction\r\nthat in order for peace to be achieved it must be\r\ndesired; moreover, I would add, there must be a\r\nworkable mechanism to ensure its realization and\r\nsustenance. In this regard, my Government is fully\r\nconvinced that the positive results of our partnership\r\nwith RAMSI could be sustained through our recently\r\nadopted National Economic Recovery, Reform and\r\nDevelopment Plan (NERRDP), which provides a\r\nblueprint for an integrated process of development and\r\nnation-building for the common good of our people.\r\nI am further convinced, that the Pacific Plan\r\nrecently adopted by the Pacific Islands Forum leaders\r\nin Apia, Samoa, represents a regional road map for\r\ncooperation that could complement national efforts\r\naimed at building an improved and secure livelihood\r\nfor the diverse people of the region. Through its\r\ncreation of stronger and deeper links between countries\r\nin the region and resource-sharing, including\r\ngovernance and aligning of policies, the Pacific Plan\r\ncould assist our countries to address challenges and\r\nissues that sovereign member States may lack the\r\nability and capacity to address individually as a result\r\nof our countries’ smallness and inherent limitations\r\ncaused by economies of scale.\r\nSolomon Islands notes the positive developments\r\nthat have taken place in the peace process on\r\nBougainville. We recognize the important role played\r\nby the United Nations in the peace process there and\r\nwould urge its continuing involvement to see the\r\nprocess through. Solomon Islands, for its part, has\r\nsigned a number of bilateral agreements with Papua\r\nNew Guinea, which will support the good work that\r\nhas already been undertaken towards peace.\r\nOn the issue of Palestine, my delegation\r\nsubscribes to the view that the resolution of the Middle\r\nEast conflict can only be possible through negotiations.\r\nIt is in this spirit that we call upon all parties to abide\r\nby the Quartet’s road map for peace, and we urge a halt\r\nto all acts of aggression.\r\nTurning to the global fight against terrorism, the\r\nrecent terrorist attacks, especially in Iraq, Indonesia,\r\nand the Beslan school in southern Russia manifest the\r\ncontinuing menace and evil of terrorism at large. We\r\nhave witnessed many innocent lives, including those of\r\nwomen and children, being lost due to these senseless\r\nterror attacks. My delegation offers its deepest\r\ncondolences to those who have lost loved ones during\r\nthese unforgivable incidents. Solomon Islands\r\ncondemns in the strongest possible terms such acts of\r\nterror and fully support international efforts to combat\r\nthis scourge. In this regard, I wish to join others in\r\ncalling on the global community to support small\r\nStates to build their national capacities towards\r\nongoing efforts aimed at combating transnational\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\ncrimes, such as arms smuggling, drug trafficking,\r\npeople smuggling, money laundering and terrorism.\r\nThe United Nations Charter promotes the\r\neconomic and social progress of Member States,\r\nespecially those facing special development problems.\r\nFor a country recovering from a post-conflict situation,\r\nSolomon Islands considers international frameworks\r\nsuch as the Brussels Programme of Action for the\r\nLeast Developed Countries, and the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action for Small Island Developing\r\nStates as vehicles for enhancing peace and achieving\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Solomon Islands\r\nis a small island developing State and a least developed\r\ncountry, where its development challenges are\r\nmultifaceted in nature. Unfortunately, the level of\r\ninternational cooperation envisaged for the\r\nProgrammes either have not materialized or have been\r\nminimal. Despite this, my Government is undertaking\r\nreforms that include the appointment of a national\r\nfocal point for the Brussels Programme of Action.\r\nHence, we are hopeful that, with better coordination,\r\nSolomon Islands can take full advantage of and\r\nmaximize all opportunities the Programme has to offer.\r\nThe issue of debt-servicing continues to present\r\nchallenges, and even obstacles, to the development\r\nprogrammes of many poor developing States. Debt\r\nburdens continue to divert attention in national budgets\r\naway from the development of necessary\r\ninfrastructures and the delivery of basic and essential\r\nsocial services. Solomon Islands therefore calls on the\r\ninternational community to give greater attention to\r\ndebt issues.\r\nSolomon Islands attaches much importance to the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, and these have been\r\nmainstreamed into our NERRDP. While we will use the\r\n2005 high-level event mentioned in the Secretary\r\nGeneral’s 2004 report on the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals to take stock of our\r\nprogress, we are confident that NERRDP can serve as a\r\nroad map for the medium to long-term implementation\r\nof our commitments. NERRDP provides a useful\r\nframework within which important issues, such as\r\neconomic and institutional reform, good governance,\r\nupholding of democracy and its values of freedom, and\r\nrespect for the basic principles of human rights can be\r\nnurtured and harnessed for the betterment and\r\nimprovement of the livelihood of our people and\r\nsociety, including the sustenance of peace in our\r\ncountry.\r\nSolomon Islands would like to pay closer\r\nattention to the emerging health threats it faces. In\r\nparticular, malaria remains the predominant cause of\r\ndeath of among children in Solomon Islands. The lack\r\nof data on HIV/AIDS presents a threat to the country\r\nand has the potential of creating a devastating impact\r\non its economy and social structure. With the support\r\nof WHO, the Global Fund to fight AIDS and Japan, we\r\nare determined to put in place appropriate preventive\r\nactions.\r\nSolomon Islands, which is geographically\r\nscattered across some 1,800 kilometres, comprising\r\nalmost 1,000 small islands and atolls, has an\r\nagriculture-based economy that is dependent on the\r\nenvironment. Sustainable management of resources is\r\nessential for guaranteeing the security of future\r\ngenerations.\r\nThe hurricanes that hit the southern United\r\nStates, the Bahamas, Grenada, Haiti and Jamaica in the\r\nCaribbean in the recent past; cyclone Heita, which\r\ndevastated Niue in 2003; flooding in Fiji; and\r\ncontinuous heavy rains in Solomon Islands all bring\r\nhome the stark reality of our world’s vulnerability to\r\nnatural disasters. We realize the great difficulty and\r\npain that smaller island developing States face in\r\nmitigating the magnitude and impact of such disasters.\r\nTo this end, we extend our condolences and sympathy\r\nfor the loss of life and property caused by the recent\r\nhurricanes in Grenada and Haiti and would urge the\r\ninternational community to assist in relief efforts to\r\nthose who are affected.\r\nGenerally, Solomon Islands strongly feels that\r\nmore could be done by the international community\r\ntowards safeguarding our environment. Hence, we\r\nacknowledge the partnership of the Global Fund in\r\nassisting environmental programmes globally, and we\r\nwould encourage that the focus of further assistance\r\nshould extend to other sectors of sustainable\r\ndevelopment, such as energy, water and sanitation.\r\nMy delegation has closely followed the review of\r\nthe Barbados Programme of Action and the\r\ndevelopment of a Group of 77 strategy paper. While\r\nnegotiations are still ongoing, Solomon Islands, as a\r\nmember of the Alliance of Small Island States\r\n(AOSIS), acknowledges that the strategy paper\r\nstrengthens the Barbados Programme and places it as\r\nan action-oriented programme with which we can all\r\nidentify. We are hopeful the Mauritius meeting will\r\nrevitalize our efforts towards protecting the\r\nenvironment and enhancing sustainable development.\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nTrade remains a significant source of economic\r\ngrowth and development for many developing States.\r\nRegionally, Pacific island countries have gradually\r\nbegun the process of regional integration. South-South\r\ntrade cooperation among Forum island countries\r\nculminated in the entry into force of the Pacific Island\r\nCountries Trade Agreement last year, and the\r\nMelanesian Spearhead Group trade agreement is being\r\nreviewed with a view to further broadening its scope\r\nand its markets 10 years after its inception. The Pacific\r\nmembers of the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific Group of\r\nStates are negotiating an economic partnership\r\nagreement with the European Union in the framework\r\nof the Cotonou Agreement. Those developments\r\nmanifest continuing preparations by small island\r\ndeveloping economies in the Pacific Islands Forum\r\nregion for gradual adaptation into the broader process\r\nof the globalization of the world economy.\r\nSolomon Islands notes that the eleventh session\r\nof the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment, convened in June this year in São Paulo,\r\nbuilt confidence and consensus on ongoing multilateral\r\ntrade negotiations. Solomon Islands supports that\r\nprocess and urges making it more participatory and\r\ninclusive so that no one is left behind, especially the\r\nsmall and vulnerable island developing economies and\r\nthe least developed countries. We are mindful of the\r\nneed to recognize the inherent structural problems of\r\ngeographical size, isolation from markets and the\r\nconstraints resulting from a lack of supply-side\r\ncapacities and economies of scale, especially in the\r\ncase of small island developing States such as Solomon\r\nIslands. However, as a member of the World Trade\r\nOrganization, we are pleased that the Doha round of\r\nmultilateral trade negotiations embraces a development\r\ndimension, in particular the recognition of the principle\r\nof special and differential treatment, in its work\r\nprogramme on small island developing economies.\r\nOne of the principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter is to open membership to all States that accept\r\ntheir Charter obligations. The Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan has registered its interest in being part of the\r\nUnited Nations family. Solomon Islands once again\r\ncalls for the Republic of China to be made a full\r\nMember of the United Nations. Solomon Islands\r\nenjoys warm and cordial relations with the Republic of\r\nChina and is mindful of the threats facing the world\r\ntoday. Threats such as severe acute respiratory\r\nsyndrome (SARS) are transnational and transborder in\r\nnature and require the cooperation and engagement of\r\nall countries of the world. To deny one country the\r\nright to participate weakens global mechanisms and\r\njeopardizes the security of all.\r\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan is democratic,\r\nand its vibrant economy is ranked seventeenth globally.\r\nIt has the third largest foreign exchange reserves. Its\r\ndevelopment experience offers important lessons on\r\nthe need to embrace freedom, respect for the basic\r\nprinciples of human rights, respect for freedom of the\r\npress and the uninhibited functioning of democratic\r\ninstitutions. The Republic of China’s ability and\r\ncapacity to contribute to strengthening the United\r\nNations should be seriously considered, especially at a\r\ntime when the Organization could do with all the help\r\nit can receive.\r\nSolomon Islands calls upon the Assembly to find\r\na process that will allow the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan to become a full and equal Member of the\r\nUnited Nations. The Pacific Islands Forum has a\r\nmechanism that engages both Chinas in our dialogue\r\nprocess, and we have continuously benefited from that\r\nrich interaction.\r\nTo conclude, I call upon the Assembly to get real\r\nand confront the increasingly varied and complex\r\nchallenges we face today. The purpose and the role of\r\nthe United Nations are ultimately to create a peaceful,\r\njust and prosperous world that offers hope to all. That\r\nrequires making the Organization flexible, innovative\r\nand responsive to ever-changing global demands. Thus,\r\nthe onus is on us to make bold and tough decisions that\r\nbreathe new life into our Organization.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency the Honourable Jaya Krishna Cuttaree,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, International Trade and\r\nRegional Cooperation of the Republic of Mauritius.\r\nMr. Cuttaree (Mauritius): Mr. President, I bring\r\nyou the greetings and the best wishes of the\r\nGovernment and people of Mauritius. It is also a matter\r\nof pride and honour to see you preside over this\r\npremier world institution. That honour is not only\r\nrecognition of the contribution of your country, Gabon,\r\nin world affairs but also a great moment for our\r\ncontinent, Africa. We are confident that, with your\r\nwide experience and vast diplomatic skills, you will\r\nsuccessfully steer the work of the Assembly. My\r\ndelegation pledges its full support to you during your\r\ntenure.\r\nMy delegation would also like to place on record\r\nour gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, for\r\nhis able and excellent leadership of the General\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. As fellow\r\nislanders, we derived great satisfaction and pride from\r\nhis unequalled stewardship. He assumed and\r\ndischarged the high responsibilities of President of the\r\nAssembly with commitment, dedication and great\r\ndiplomacy. We thank him for his service to the world\r\ncommunity.\r\nAllow me also to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his relentless efforts and\r\ndetermination to ensure that our Organization\r\ncontinues to play its role effectively in the international\r\narena.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is taking\r\nplace as we prepare ourselves to tackle and face major\r\nchallenges and developments over the next 12 months.\r\nOf particular importance to small island developing\r\nStates such as my own, 2005 will begin with two major\r\nevents: the International Meeting for the full and\r\ncomprehensive review of the implementation of the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action, which will be hosted\r\nby Mauritius; and the World Conference on Disaster\r\nReduction, to be held in Japan.\r\nTen years after Barbados, small island developing\r\nStates continue to face practically the same challenges\r\nin their drive to achieve sustainable development.\r\nTheir small size, fragile ecosystems, geographic\r\nisolation and limited resources, compounded by the\r\nthreats of climate change, rising sea levels and natural\r\ndisasters, make them particularly vulnerable. While it\r\nis a fact that many developing countries face the\r\nincreasing pressures posed by the combined forces of\r\nglobalization and trade liberalization, such pressures\r\nare even more exacerbating for small island developing\r\nStates. Their small markets and the limited market\r\naccess for their products constrain them greatly in their\r\nefforts to integrate smoothly into the global economy.\r\nThey also suffer from natural vulnerabilities to\r\nphenomena such as hurricanes, earthquakes and\r\ntsunamis. The devastation caused by the recent series\r\nof hurricanes in the Caribbean islands demonstrates the\r\nextent of our vulnerability. It is true that those\r\nvulnerabilities have been recognized in a variety of\r\ninternational forums, but such recognition has yet to\r\ncrystallize in concrete actions in favour of small island\r\ndeveloping States. The precarious situation of our\r\nStates is of direct concern to the international\r\ncommunity as a whole.\r\nMay we then resolve to take bold initiatives to\r\nimplement meaningfully the Barbados Programme and\r\nto respond to related emerging issues so that small\r\nisland developing States can build resilience and\r\ncapacity and be integrated fully into the global\r\neconomy? Similarly, in the multilateral trading system,\r\nwe expect the emergence of an environment conducive\r\nto enabling our States to improve their\r\ncompetitiveness, their market access and the\r\ndiversification of their economies. We therefore expect\r\nthe World Trade Organization to soon establish a work\r\nprogramme for small economies.\r\nAs a small island developing State, Mauritius is\r\nindeed honoured to host the International Meeting. The\r\nInternational Meeting should be not only a collective\r\ngathering to reflect on the specificities of our concerns.\r\nIt should also be a landmark in the history of the major\r\nUnited Nations conferences, with deliverable outcomes\r\nand the means necessary for their implementation.\r\nWe in Mauritius are leaving no stone unturned to\r\nmake that event truly historic and memorable. It is\r\nimportant that the entire international community\r\nparticipate in that meeting, which, allow me to point\r\nout, is a United Nations meeting on small island\r\ndevelopment States and not a meeting for those States\r\nalone.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe work to be undertaken by the small island\r\ndeveloping States is based upon sustainable\r\ndevelopment and the restricted resources available to\r\nthose countries. How can one not welcome, therefore,\r\nthe decision taken by the Government of Burkina Faso,\r\nhost of the next summit of la Francophonie, which has\r\nchosen solidarity and sustainable development as the\r\ntheme of the summit.\r\nOur preoccupation with sustainable\r\ndevelopment — the basis of the Johannesburg\r\nSummit — is even stronger in the context of\r\nglobalization today. Although only a handful of\r\ndeveloping island States are French-speaking, we trust\r\nthat the Summit will highlight the need for us to find,\r\nwithin the international community, ways and means to\r\nhelp small island developing States, which may then\r\nbecome models for sustainable development.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nGlobal warming, and its related effects on climate\r\nchange, is now an undisputed reality, and islands suffer\r\nthe brunt of it, even though — let me emphasize this —\r\nwe are the least responsible for the cause. We believe\r\nthat the Kyoto Protocol is the most appropriate\r\nmechanism for global action now and in the future, to\r\naddress the issue of global warming. We call, therefore,\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nfor its ratification and entry into force, as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nAfrica, home to 34 of the world’s 48 poorest\r\ncountries, remains an enormous challenge for the\r\nUnited Nations. The deadly spread of HIV and AIDS\r\ncontinues to claim a devastating toll on the continent,\r\nparticularly in southern Africa. We in Africa are\r\ncommitted to further democratize our societies and\r\ngive our people a rightful voice in the decision-making\r\nprocess. That is why at the continental level, we are\r\ndoing all we can, despite our scarce resources, to\r\nconsolidate the African Union and make it central in\r\nour collective bid to grapple with the development\r\nconcerns of our region. Using that perspective, we have\r\ncome up with our own home-grown programme, the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)\r\nin order to attain the ultimate goal that we have fixed\r\nfor ourselves — the total integration of Africa.\r\nSince we launched the African Union Peace and\r\nSecurity Council last May, we have received\r\nencouraging support from some of our development\r\npartners. I should like to use this platform to urge the\r\ninternational community to support the African Union\r\nin that field to enable it to come to grips with the\r\nconflicts that continue to divert our attention and\r\nmeagre resources from our development efforts.\r\nIn addressing the issue of conflicts on the\r\ncontinent, the African Union has amply demonstrated\r\nthat it means business, and any assistance it gets from\r\nthe international community can only help it to achieve\r\nits goals. But let me hasten to say that the African\r\nUnion’s involvement in peace processes should not\r\ndistract the United Nations Security Council from its\r\nprimary responsibility to maintain peace and security\r\nin Africa. Indeed, the Security Council should not\r\nallow itself to be perceived as being selective in its\r\napproach with regard to conflicts in various parts of the\r\nworld. Experiences in the Great Lakes region and in\r\nWest Africa have shown that the combined efforts of\r\nthe Security Council and the African Union can bring\r\ntangible results.\r\nBefore I leave this part of my statement, let me\r\nrefer to the unjust treatment that continues to be meted\r\nout to the Saharawi people who are still struggling for\r\ntheir right to self-determination. It is the duty of this\r\nworld body to ensure a speedy conclusion of that\r\nmatter. In this regard, my delegation reiterates its\r\nsupport for the Settlement Plan and any other political\r\ninitiative acceptable to the parties concerned that will\r\nhelp to take the process forward for a durable and\r\nsustainable solution. The Saharawi people deserve that\r\ncommitment from us.\r\nAs this Assembly is aware, Mauritius has always\r\nfavoured a bilateral approach in our resolve to restore\r\nour exercise of sovereignty over the Chagos\r\nArchipelago which, prior to independence from the\r\nUnited Kingdom, was unlawfully detached from our\r\nterritory, in violation of the Declaration on the\r\nGranting of Independence to Colonial Countries and\r\nPeoples contained in General Assembly resolution\r\n1514 (XV), and Assembly resolutions 2066 (XX), 2232\r\n(XXI) and 2357 (XXII). Such bilateral approaches\r\nhave unfortunately not yielded any result so far and\r\ncertain recent regrettable unilateral actions by the\r\nUnited Kingdom have not been helpful.\r\nWhile we shall continue to favour a settlement of\r\nthe matter through dialogue, we shall use all avenues\r\nopen to us in order to exercise our full sovereign rights\r\nover the Chagos Archipelago. The Assembly should\r\nalso note that this issue has a tragic human dimension.\r\nBefore Mauritius acceded to its independence, all the\r\ninhabitants of the Chagos were forced to leave the land\r\nof their birth, where they had lived for several\r\ngenerations. The plight of those inhabitants must now\r\nbe comprehensively addressed.\r\nIn the same context, my delegation looks forward\r\nto the resumption of dialogue with the French\r\nGovernment over Tromelin island.\r\nMauritius is a firm believer and, indeed, a keen\r\nplayer in regional cooperation and integration, not as\r\nan end in itself but as a sure means to enable us to\r\nintegrate the global economy. We consider regional\r\ncooperation as a necessary step to enable Africa to\r\nbenefit from globalization. We have therefore spared\r\nno effort to promote regional cooperation. Since the\r\nearly 1980s we in Mauritius, have been playing a pro-\r\nactive role in advancing the objectives of the Abuja\r\nTreaty. Mauritius is a very active member of the\r\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa\r\n(COMESA) and of the South African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC).\r\nAs the new Chair of SADC, we look forward to\r\nworking very closely with all our fellow member States\r\nin advancing the objectives of the organization,\r\npromoting community building through regional\r\nintegration and aligning national policies for regional\r\ncooperation so that they stay on course in the\r\nglobalization process. We will also endeavour to forge\r\na strong relationship between SADC and its\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\ndevelopment partners as well as with other\r\nsubregional, continental and multilateral organizations.\r\nAfter the failure of the WTO Ministerial\r\nConference at Cancún, the successful outcome of the\r\nJuly 2004 General Council meeting has come as a ray\r\nof hope to put the trade talks back on track. The July\r\npackage of frameworks and other agreements that the\r\nWTO members approved will greatly enhance the\r\nchances for a successful completion of the Doha\r\nDevelopment Agenda negotiations.\r\nWe therefore welcome the decision adopted by\r\nthe WTO General Council to fulfil the development\r\ndimensions of the Doha Development Agenda, which\r\nplaces the needs and interests of developing and least\r\ndeveloped countries at the heart of the Doha Agenda\r\nwork programme.\r\nIn that context, let me make an appeal for a\r\nmeaningful synergy to be established among the\r\ndevelopment agencies and other United Nations\r\ninstitutions, including the Bretton Woods institutions,\r\nin order to ensure that developing countries develop\r\ntheir capacity to increase their share of world trade as a\r\nnecessary pathway to prosperity.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East remains\r\nextremely preoccupying for all freedom-loving nations\r\nand peoples. We go on speaking of the need for a\r\ncomprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East,\r\nwithout realizing that each year the peace and security\r\nsituation in the region is growing worse.\r\nOver the past year, we witnessed more targeted\r\nassassinations, increased terrorist acts, daily\r\nrecriminations from both sides and an expansion of\r\nsettlement activities. The illegal construction of a wall\r\nby Israel in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the\r\noccupied Palestinian territories has worsened an\r\nalready complex situation.\r\nAlmost two years ago the road map called for a\r\nfinal and comprehensive settlement of the Israel-\r\nPalestinian conflict by 2005. The year 2005 is at our\r\ndoorstep and we are still grappling with how to put the\r\nderailed peace process back on track. We believe that\r\nthe road map remains the only viable option for peace\r\nin the region. We call on both Israel and Palestine to\r\nexercise maximum restraint, undertake confidence-\r\nbuilding measures and create the appropriate\r\nenvironment, with the help of the Quartet, to\r\nimplement the road map.\r\nMy delegation believes that what is needed today\r\nis not a wall, but a political solution and a renewed\r\ncommitment from the international community that\r\nwould resolve the conflict altogether. Only the creation\r\nof the much-awaited Palestinian State, existing side by\r\nside with Israel with secured and recognized borders,\r\ncan bring peace and stability to the Middle East.\r\nThe political process in Iraq reached an important\r\nmilestone last June with the handing over of authority\r\nto the Iraqi Interim Government. My delegation\r\nbelieves that the holding of national elections early\r\nnext year, as required by Security Council resolution\r\n1546 (2004), will give the people of Iraq a unique\r\nopportunity to take the destiny of their country into\r\ntheir own hands. However, the current security\r\nsituation in Iraq is very disturbing. My delegation\r\ncondemns all acts of violence that can disrupt Iraq’s\r\npolitical and economic transition. The international\r\ncommunity must be fully engaged in its efforts to\r\nrebuild a safe, democratic and peaceful Iraq.\r\nGiven the potential threat posed by nuclear\r\nweapons and weapons of mass destruction, it is a\r\nmatter of serious concern that we still have not been\r\nable to find common ground to initiate a process\r\nleading to complete disarmament. Significant\r\ndifferences still persist among parties to the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We once\r\nagain appeal to all Member States to translate their\r\nstated commitments to the cause of disarmament into\r\naction.\r\nMauritius supports and implements fully the\r\ninternational disarmament treaties such as the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention and the Biological and\r\nToxin Weapons Convention and has always supported\r\nthe various United Nations resolutions related to the\r\nconsolidation of those regimes, including resolution\r\n1540 (2004), which focuses on non-proliferation\r\nissues.\r\nAlong with our fight against weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, we should also stay the course against the\r\nillicit trade in small arms and light weapons, which\r\nhave been the weapons of choice in recent conflicts,\r\nparticularly in Africa.\r\nTerrorist acts continue to create fear and havoc\r\namong peaceful nations and lead to the loss of lives,\r\nparticularly among innocent civilians, including\r\nwomen and children. We should therefore reflect on the\r\neffectiveness of the international response to terrorism.\r\nIt is becoming increasingly evident that the war against\r\ninternational terrorism cannot be won by military\r\nmight alone. Several reports submitted to this\r\nAssembly have already amply demonstrated that\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nproblems such as poverty, social inequality,\r\nunemployment and illiteracy constitute breeding\r\ngrounds for terrorism. Genuine international\r\ncooperation is therefore needed to comprehensively\r\naddress the root causes of terrorism.\r\nAllow me to share some thoughts with respect to\r\nthe future of our Organization. The world emerged\r\nfrom the Second World War resolved to ensure peace\r\namong nations, and the United Nations was born with\r\nthat vision firmly in mind. Now, more than half a\r\ncentury later, in full recognition of the drastic and far-\r\nreaching changes that have transformed our world,\r\nthere is full consensus for a reform of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nThere is indeed general agreement that the\r\ncurrent structure of the Security Council needs to be\r\nreviewed to reflect the new realities of the world. We\r\nfirmly believe that a greater commitment has to be\r\ndemonstrated by every member of the Organization in\r\norder to reach an agreement on a reformed Security\r\nCouncil based on wider representation, transparency\r\nand equitable geographical distribution with the\r\ninclusion of developing countries from Africa, Asia\r\nand Latin America as permanent members. Here, let\r\nme reiterate our conviction that India fully deserves to\r\nhave that status. In that respect, I need to underscore\r\nthe need for small island States, which are scattered\r\nover all the oceans of the world, to have an adequate\r\nvoice in the Council.\r\nIt is therefore our sincere hope that the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change appointed by\r\nthe Secretary-General will make concrete and practical\r\nrecommendations to make the United Nations more\r\ncredible and responsive to the expectations of people in\r\nevery corner of the globe. The high-level plenary\r\nmeeting, which is to be held next year, would also be\r\nan opportunity for us to take stock of progress made in\r\nrespect to the goals set in the major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits.\r\nMauritius continues to be an active supporter of\r\nthe United Nations in its efforts to save succeeding\r\ngenerations from war and suffering and to promote\r\nsocial progress and better standards of life. Mauritius\r\nbelieves that a strengthened United Nations, evolving\r\nwithin the framework of a credible multilateral system,\r\nis the only effective instrument at the disposal of the\r\ninternational community to bring order and ensure the\r\ncoherence of international economic, social and\r\nenvironmental policies.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable Sir Rabbie L.\r\nNamaliu, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration\r\nof Papua New Guinea.\r\nMr. Namaliu (Papua New Guinea): My\r\ndelegation warmly welcomes you to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session and\r\npledges our support. We acknowledge that you are also\r\nfrom our Forum of Small States group and therefore\r\nshare our common problems and challenges. Please\r\nconvey my delegation’s commendation to your\r\npredecessor, the Honourable Julian Hunte, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Saint Lucia, for his strong\r\nleadership of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nsession.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to thank the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and his staff for\r\nthe good work they continue to do for our global\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe currently live in a changing world, one which\r\npast generations would even be amazed at. One of the\r\ngreatest achievements of the United Nations system is\r\nthe process of decolonization which has seen more than\r\n70 countries, including my own, take their rightful\r\nplace in this Assembly. The process will not be\r\ncomplete, however, until the remaining 16 Non-Self-\r\nGoverning Territories, including New Caledonia and\r\nTokelau, have exercised their inalienable right to self-\r\ndetermination.\r\nThe world continues to witness great leaps in\r\ntechnology, but at the same time we have also seen an\r\nincrease in some global dilemmas — poverty and\r\nhunger, the ravages of HIV/AIDS, wars, conflicts and\r\nterrorism, among others.\r\nEach of our countries face numerous challenges\r\nin this changing world and many of them are common\r\nto all of us, regardless of our size, location and status\r\nas developed or developing countries. Under the\r\ncircumstances, and more than ever before, we need to\r\nwork together as a community of nations to help each\r\nother address those challenges. Nowhere is that more\r\nevident than in the domain of international peace and\r\nsecurity. A terrorist act committed in one State today\r\nalso affects others elsewhere in the global community.\r\nWe condemn the recent tragedy in Beslan, Russia,\r\nthe bombing of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta and\r\nthe ongoing terrorist acts in the Middle East, Iraq, and\r\nother parts of the world. We also condemn the recent\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\ntragedy in Darfur, the Sudan, and commend Canada\r\nand Japan for their generous assistance.\r\nIn circumstances like the foregoing, those most\r\naffected are innocent civilians, especially women and\r\nchildren. We therefore support the Secretary-General’s\r\nefforts to rally the international community to\r\nsubscribe to the treaties on the protection of civilians.\r\nIn many cases, terrorists also take the lives of\r\nUnited Nations and other humanitarian workers who\r\nare doing unselfish and dedicated work under difficult\r\ncircumstances to serve our common humanity. In that\r\nregard, we urge all Member States to support the\r\nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and\r\nAssociated Personnel.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East remains\r\nintractable, requiring constant and deliberate attention\r\nby the United Nations, especially by the Security\r\nCouncil. Our own experience in the Bougainville\r\nconflict has taught us that there can be peace if all\r\nparties really desire it and are willing to resolve their\r\ndifferences. We therefore urge all parties to the conflict\r\nin the Middle East — including Israel and Palestine, as\r\nwell as the major players, particularly the Quartet — to\r\nformulate a peace plan that is mutually acceptable to\r\nall.\r\nPapua New Guinea concurs with Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan’s recent statement to the\r\nAssembly at its 3rd meeting, which highlighted how\r\nimportant it is for the rule of law to prevail if we are to\r\nachieve peace and security in the world.\r\nLike many other Member States, Papua New\r\nGuinea has acceded to the various counter-terrorism\r\ntreaties, pursuant to Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001). We believe that the reporting obligations under\r\nthe provisions of those treaties should be streamlined\r\nto include regional reports, which would solve many\r\ncapacity issues for small nations with limited\r\nresources. Because many of our regional legal, military\r\nand law enforcement agencies meet regularly, those\r\nmeetings could provide the opportunity to compile\r\nregional reports on our fight against international\r\nterrorism. We believe that there is every desire to fulfil\r\ntreaty obligations; but if some of the more onerous\r\ntasks can be lightened for the small countries through\r\nregional reports, bodies like the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee, the Security Council, the General\r\nAssembly and other related agencies could be better\r\nserved.\r\nThe small States are doing their best to fulfil their\r\nobligations. Like many other Members States, we take\r\nseriously our responsibilities and obligations to fight\r\nthe scourge of international terrorism and related issues\r\nincluding the trafficking of people.\r\nThe Pacific region advocates that the United\r\nNations continue to closely and seriously study the\r\nnotion of collective security along with collective\r\naction, ideas upon which many of our actions to bring\r\nstability to our region continue to be based.\r\nWe are custodians of the biggest ocean and its\r\nresources. Papua New Guinea, in particular, is\r\nendowed with 5 to 7 per cent of the world’s\r\nbiodiversity. We therefore share a common\r\nresponsibility to ensure the protection and conservation\r\nof those resources which are of vital importance to\r\nhumanity.\r\nWe encourage sustainable logging practices in\r\norder to avoid the denuding of our vast rainforest\r\nresources. We condemn destructive fishing methods\r\nand urge all Member States to adhere to sustainable\r\nmanagement and conservation regimes in order to meet\r\nfuture demands.\r\nAt the Pacific Islands Forum, our leaders recently\r\nadopted a new vision for the Pacific region in the form\r\nof the Pacific Plan, which embraces four key areas:\r\neconomic growth, sustainable development, security\r\nand good governance.\r\nThe Pacific Islands Forum will be engaging with\r\nthe European Union and other development partners to\r\nadvance the interests of the region, especially those of\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development.\r\nI share the view enunciated by other speakers that\r\nthere can be no security without development, and that\r\nequally, there can be no development without peace\r\nand security. As important links, both need to be\r\naddressed simultaneously if we want peace and\r\nsustainable development to prevail.\r\nWe are pleased to see regional solidarity and\r\nassistance in conflict situations bear good results in\r\nBougainville and in our neighbour, the Solomon\r\nIslands. We also note that other regional actions taken\r\nby our leaders, such as the establishment of the Pacific\r\nTransnational Crime Coordination Centre in Fiji,\r\nenhance law enforcement and intelligence sharing in\r\nthe region.\r\nConcerning good governance, our leaders\r\nencouraged Pacific Member Governments to sign and\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nratify the United Nations Convention against\r\nCorruption in accordance with the spirit of the\r\nBiketawa Declaration.\r\nOver the past several years, Papua New Guinea\r\nhas been the beneficiary of regional and international\r\nassistance in the rebuilding and return to normalcy of\r\nthe island of Bougainville, after a decade-long conflict.\r\nWe thank the members of the Security Council, both\r\npast and present, for their goodwill, patience and\r\nunderstanding in what has been an extremely painful\r\nexperience for us. We have appreciated the support and\r\ncounsel of each member of the Council throughout that\r\nimportant process. The conflict has greatly affected our\r\nnation and we have learned many lessons. We are re-\r\nestablishing the rule of law in a profound and thorough\r\nconstitutional process which will result in a\r\ndemocratically elected autonomous government for the\r\npeople of Bougainville. While we are close to\r\nachieving that, we are equally mindful that each step\r\ntaken now to finalize and consolidate the Bougainville\r\nconstitution is critically important for the autonomous\r\ngovernment of Bougainville to be sustained\r\nsuccessfully.\r\nWe continue to receive valuable support and\r\nassistance for the peace process from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral as well as from our Pacific neighbours:\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu and the\r\nSolomon Islands. Rebuilding and restoration of\r\nservices in Bougainville has been greatly assisted by\r\nour development partners, including the United\r\nNations Development Programme, the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund, the European Union, Australia, New\r\nZealand and Japan, among others. We thank them all\r\nand look forward to their continued support and\r\ncooperation.\r\nWe continue to be concerned about the security\r\nand vulnerability of many of our small island States.\r\nAs noted and endorsed by Pacific leaders at the recent\r\nPacific Islands Forum Summit in Samoa, the\r\nforthcoming International Meeting on the 10-year\r\nreview of the Barbados Programme of Action, to be\r\nheld in Mauritius in 2005, will provide an opportunity\r\nto discuss with our development partners the many\r\nissues which confront small island States, including\r\nthose in our subregion.\r\nDevelopment of women and children through\r\nsports must have a special place in our quest to\r\nimprove the socio-economic well-being of our people.\r\nWe are also working hard to implement the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and the outcomes of the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development (WSSD).\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to have\r\ndevastating consequences in many developing\r\ncountries. Our leaders in the Pacific region have\r\nendorsed a regional strategy for HIV/AIDS noting the\r\nneed to address the issue urgently.\r\nSmall arms and light weapons will always\r\nthreaten the stability of many small States. Therefore,\r\nwe look forward to the continuing work towards a\r\nUnited-Nations-supported action plan for dealing with\r\nsmall arms.\r\nClimate change is a threat to all humankind and\r\ntherefore deserves the attention of the international\r\ncommunity, which must work together to address it.\r\nWe are appreciative of the position of the United\r\nKingdom as underlined by Prime Minister, The Right\r\nHonourable Tony Blair, in a recent statement\r\nhighlighting the threat of sea level rise and related\r\nissues. I am aware that there are scientific studies\r\nbeing carried out, but the real issue is that the effects of\r\nclimate change and global warming are being felt daily\r\nby many island States. We in Papua New Guinea are no\r\nmore immune to climate change and sea level rise than\r\nare many other small island States. The island\r\ncommunities in Papua New Guinea, like those of our\r\nneighbouring countries in the Pacific, are being\r\naffected adversely by sea level rise. We empathize with\r\nour colleagues from many other island States which\r\ncontinually suffer from the effects of the problem. Our\r\nplight is further compounded by natural disasters,\r\nincluding the ravages of hurricanes, cyclones,\r\nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods and tsunamis.\r\nIn that context, our sympathies go to the peoples\r\nand the Governments of the Caribbean region,\r\nespecially those of Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, Cuba, the\r\nBahamas and the Dominican Republic, among others,\r\nas well as to the inhabitants of cities and towns of the\r\nsouthern states of the United States of America, which\r\nhave been devastated by the recent hurricanes.\r\nAs a global community we must pool our\r\nresources and consider ways of mitigating the adverse\r\neffects of climate change in order to help those States\r\nwhich are vulnerable. We applaud the intention of the\r\nRussian Federation to consider becoming a party to the\r\nKyoto Protocol and urge others to recognize their\r\nresponsibility to the global community by doing the\r\nsame.\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nWe look forward to the final report of the High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change\r\nappointed by the Secretary-General, which will form\r\nthe basis for high-level discussions on United Nations\r\nreforms, including the expansion and composition of\r\nthe Security Council. We believe Council membership\r\nshould be expanded in both the permanent and the non-\r\npermanent categories to take into account the lack of\r\nsufficient representation of developing countries in the\r\nAsia-Pacific, African and Latin American regions. We\r\nalso believe that Japan and Germany should be\r\nseriously considered for permanent membership, with\r\nequal privileges and obligations. Consideration may be\r\ngiven to other countries with appropriate qualifications\r\nand integrity, particularly from the developing world.\r\nWe also commend the indications from the Panel\r\nthat the definition of “hard” versus “soft” threats is no\r\nlonger relevant. That will allow a proper and objective\r\ndiscussion to be held, given that the resonance of\r\nperceived threats can be viewed differently depending\r\non where the threat is.\r\nThat said, Papua New Guinea believes that\r\nreform of the United Nations system should be\r\ncomprehensive and that the General Assembly should\r\nregain its pre-eminent role as the principal organ of the\r\nUnited Nations. That will enable all Member States,\r\nlarge and small, to engage more meaningfully in\r\naddressing all challenges in an effective way in order\r\nto help the United Nations fulfil its role in the pursuit\r\nof a peaceful, just and prosperous world. That is the\r\npurpose for which the United Nations was established.\r\nAs we move towards next year’s review of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals and the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, we should all look\r\nat the dire needs of the majority of humanity. My\r\ndelegation believes that the Millennium Development\r\nGoals provide the blueprint for achieving those\r\nobjectives.\r\nFinally, let me conclude by reaffirming Papua\r\nNew Guinea’s support for the one-China policy, which\r\nprovides the sound basis for our bilateral relations with\r\nthe People’s Republic of China.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency the Honourable Barak Sope\r\nMautamate, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Vanuatu.\r\nMr. Mautamate (Vanuatu): I bring to this\r\ngathering a warm greeting from the people of the\r\nRepublic of Vanuatu.\r\nMr. President, at the outset, I take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate you on your assumption of\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nninth session. I also take this occasion to acknowledge\r\nwith deep gratitude the contributions of your\r\npredecessor, who so competently steered the work of\r\nthe fifty-eighth session to its conclusion.\r\nHere, I must also acknowledge the outstanding\r\nrole of Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has been\r\nresolute in his efforts to revitalize the Organization’s\r\nability to address global concerns. My delegation\r\nreaffirms its support for Mr. Annan’s profound and\r\nmeticulous leadership of the United Nations.\r\nI also take this opportunity to convey the\r\ncondolences of my Government and the people of\r\nVanuatu to the people of the Caribbean nations, in\r\nparticular Haiti, for the loss of so many lives and for\r\nthe extensive damage caused by the destructive forces\r\nof nature that recently swept through the region. We\r\noffer them our moral support and pray that the affected\r\npeoples will soon recover and that the devastated areas\r\nof their nations will be swiftly rehabilitated and rebuilt.\r\nThose inevitable natural calamities demonstrate once\r\nmore the extreme and particular vulnerability of island\r\nStates, which seriously affects national economies.\r\nEvery year, from this rostrum, we reaffirm our\r\nfaith and confidence in upholding the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter. We entered the new\r\nmillennium with much anticipation and hope of\r\ncreating a just and better world for all our citizens.\r\nHowever, global insecurity and the varying dimensions\r\nof serious conflict have created a frightening situation.\r\nIt is to be expected that the world will plunge into\r\nfurther turmoil unless the role of the United Nations —\r\nthe only truly global body — is reinvigorated and\r\nrecovers its legitimate responsibility of addressing the\r\ncauses of conflict and maintaining peace and security. I\r\ncome to the Assembly with some trepidation, as I see\r\nour world spiralling out of control unless its Members\r\nuphold the universality of the United Nations decision-\r\nmaking process in addressing global concerns.\r\nThe world is at a crossroads and we meet here at\r\na critical juncture. Around us, civil strife, wars,\r\npoverty, disease, famine, drought, natural disasters,\r\nterrorism, environmental degradation, depletion of land\r\nand marine resources and other phenomena are\r\nravaging the world. The displacement of peoples from\r\ntheir natural habitats and the sacrilege of human\r\nsuffering in many parts of the world demonstrate that\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nunless immediate remedial strategies are implemented,\r\nthe global situation will continue to deteriorate.\r\nMoreover, the emergence of conflict in areas we\r\nonce believed stable, the deterioration of law and order\r\nand the senseless killing of innocent peoples are\r\npainful reminders that we need to rethink our policies\r\nand decisions. Globalization has brought with it both\r\nopportunities and challenges, but for the small island\r\nStates the challenges are much more ominous. Those\r\nare the realities.\r\nThose negative developments lead me to\r\nconclude that the United Nations is indispensable and\r\nthat we all need to work as friends and equal partners.\r\nGlobalization has brought nations together. We are\r\ninterlinked and interdependent. That demands global\r\ncooperation and governance from all responsible\r\nMembers of the Organization. Understandably, there\r\nare the vested interests of the powerful, but that only\r\nnecessitates genuine cooperation and goodwill to\r\nachieve convergence of those interests. The United\r\nNations role in that regard must remain fundamental in\r\norder to ensure compatibility with the international\r\nlegal framework. Maverick policies and decisions will\r\nonly create further divisions and hostility.\r\nWith that in mind, I believe there is now\r\nconsensus on introducing far-reaching reforms that\r\nmake the United Nations relevant for all its Members,\r\nwith the fundamental objective of preserving\r\ninternational peace, security and stability.\r\nMy Government fully supports efforts to reform\r\nthe United Nations system in order to ensure a stronger\r\nand more effective Organization. On that note, my\r\ndelegation endorses the view of other delegations on\r\nthe need to review the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil so that it will better reflect geographical\r\ndistribution and the underrepresented groups of\r\nMember countries of the United Nations, without\r\naffecting the authority of the Council.\r\nI hope all the rhetoric that has come before the\r\nAssembly can be translated into concrete and practical\r\naction. We must be resolute in our collective desire to\r\nwork together as sovereign nations in addressing the\r\nworld’s problems through multilateral institutions. The\r\nblueprint for international cooperation has been\r\nestablished, but reforming certain structures in the\r\nUnited Nations system must be seen as a prerequisite if\r\nwe are serious about moving forward. The Achilles\r\nheel of the current structure is the imbalance of power\r\nin the United Nations system. It has become so chronic\r\nthat it has weakened the multilateral focus,\r\ncohesiveness and internationalism of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe principles of democratization and good\r\ngovernance so actively advocated and championed by\r\nsome Members must be reflected in the reorganization\r\nand decision-making process of the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nIt is in this regard that Vanuatu supports the\r\nreview of the permanent membership of the Security\r\nCouncil in order to include Japan and one\r\nrepresentative each from the African continent, the\r\nMiddle East and the group of small developing\r\ncountries. A more representative Council will bring\r\nabout openness and transparency, create confidence\r\nand ameliorate understanding and cooperation. A\r\nrestructuring of the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil is long overdue. Diversity is essential there.\r\nMy Government looks forward to the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Threats.\r\nAlthough the fight against terrorism takes centre\r\nstage, it must not overshadow the socio-economic\r\ndevelopment agenda and other serious security\r\nconcerns affecting the developing world, and in\r\nparticular small island States. Resources will inevitably\r\nbe diverted towards combating terrorism in all its\r\nfacets, but judicious decisions need to be taken. It is\r\nagainst that background that our delegation wishes to\r\nassociate itself with statements made by other\r\ndelegations on the imperativeness of supporting the\r\ndevelopment constraints of developing nations, and in\r\nparticular the concerns of the small island States on\r\nvulnerability.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit leaders adopted the\r\neight Millennium Development Goals, with targets to\r\nbe achieved by 2015. Although commitments have\r\nbeen made, the lethargic performance of many\r\ncountries, including Vanuatu, demonstrate the need for\r\nmore international support in assisting countries to\r\nmeet those targets.\r\nThe global economic situation today\r\ndiscriminates against many developing economies.\r\nUnfair trading practices and the imposition of intrusive\r\npolicies on national economies — including that of\r\nVanuatu — affect those economies by opening them up\r\nto unfavourable conditions that only favour stronger\r\nnations. The post-Cancún period poses extreme\r\nchallenges to the economic survival and socio-\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\neconomic stability of many small developing nations\r\nlike Vanuatu.\r\nMy Government’s initial focus is on the social\r\nsector, namely, on health and education. The\r\nGovernment’s prioritized action agenda, which was\r\nlaunched last year in consultation with our\r\ndevelopment partners, is the catalyst for Vanuatu’s\r\nmedium- to long-term strategic planning. This\r\ndevelopment policy framework is consistent with\r\nachieving the targets of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals and emphasizes the need to empower our rural\r\npopulation through infrastructure- and capacity-\r\nbuilding initiatives. We appeal to our development\r\npartners to adequately assist us in its implementation.\r\nOn that note, my delegation wishes to express its\r\ngratitude to the United States of America for granting\r\nVanuatu eligibility to access development funding from\r\nthe Millennium Challenge Account.\r\nThe primary responsibility for development lies\r\nwith a State itself. Yet, external influences and\r\nconditional aid have not adequately corresponded with\r\nVanuatu’s development priorities and achievements.\r\nThe pretext for meting out foreign advice conditioned\r\nwith development assistance has been to improve\r\ngovernance and other sectors considered vital in\r\nestablishing a strong economy. In Vanuatu’s case that\r\nline of argument has not produced tangible results,\r\nwith restricted progress being reflected in our\r\ncontinuous struggle with reforms that are more or less\r\ndictated by external forces.\r\nBoth the recipient and the external assistance\r\nmust be balanced and sensitive to national interests.\r\nToo often, that normal reaction is misunderstood by\r\nsome of our development partners. From Vanuatu’s\r\nperspective, externally driven reforms must be\r\nbuttressed by an equal partnership that respects local\r\ntradition, culture and the rights of all citizens without\r\ndisturbing the essential uniting mechanisms of society\r\nthat have successfully held us together over time. An\r\nexploitative agenda can only erode and dismantle those\r\ningrained mechanisms, leaving us vulnerable to the\r\nrapid changes affecting all of us today. Vanuatu\r\nembraces democracy and the concepts of governance\r\nand transparency, but they must be tailored to suit the\r\ntraditional system without affecting the relevance and\r\nsignificance of those far-reaching principles.\r\nIn recent times, the history of the Organization\r\nhas been characterized by indecision, which blemishes\r\nthe record of the United Nations. I speak about the\r\nlongstanding issue of self-determination, and in\r\nparticular the case of West Papua, and I do so while\r\nbeing cognizant of the Charter and while espousing the\r\nprinciples that continue to guide the Organization’s\r\nefforts in the process of self-determination. The United\r\nNations must be consistent in its decisions for the\r\nrecognition and respect of the fundamental rights to\r\nself-determination for the people of West Papua. The\r\ntruth surrounding the so-called Act of Free Choice\r\nmust be exposed to the Melanesian sisters and brothers\r\nof West Papua and the rest of the international\r\ncommunity. Saddest of all is General Assembly\r\nresolution 2504 (XXIV) of 1969, concerning West\r\nPapua. How can the United Nations continue to ignore\r\nthe cries of over 3 million people demanding justice?\r\nAs world leaders, we have time and again expressed\r\nserious concerns and dissatisfaction about the fact that\r\ncertain decisions and actions by the United Nations or\r\nits bodies were not consistent with the purposes and\r\nintentions of the Charter. However, in the case of West\r\nPapua, absolutely nothing has been done to rectify the\r\ngross violation of internationally accepted practice. It\r\nis therefore our joint responsibility to address this grey\r\narea of history.\r\nThe continuing disputes and concerns raised with\r\nregard to the legality of United Nations-endorsed\r\ninstruments that have been concluded throughout the\r\nyears — such as the New York Agreement of 1962, to\r\ngovern the United Nations administration of the so-\r\ncalled Act of Free Choice in West Papua — is a clear\r\nexample challenging the integrity and validity of\r\nUnited Nations resolutions at that time. In our opinion,\r\nthe United Nations-conducted exercises were a total\r\nfarce conditioned only to suit the geopolitical climate\r\nof that period. The United Nations cannot, and must\r\nnot, continue to turn a blind eye to its own past\r\nfailures. It is morally, politically and legally wrong to\r\ndo so. The Netherlands in particular, which was the\r\nformer colonial authority, should also recognize that it\r\nshould shoulder some responsibility in helping to\r\nresolve the unfortunate situation of West Papua in a\r\npeaceful and transparent manner. Why is no one\r\naccountable for those unjust decisions affecting the\r\nlives of millions of people today?\r\nVanuatu therefore calls for the establishment of a\r\nspecial commission of inquiry to review the United\r\nNations conduct in relation to the 1969 Act. We also\r\ncall for the United Nations to send a fact-finding\r\nmission to examine the situation in West Papua with\r\nregard to human rights abuses and other related issues.\r\nAnd we call for the reinscription of West Papua on the\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nlist of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Those are\r\ncritically challenging responsibilities.\r\nOn a final matter, my delegation strongly\r\nreaffirms its support for resolution 2758 (XXVI),\r\nwhich was adopted during the twenty-sixth session, in\r\n1971, and which recognized the legal and political\r\nrepresentation of the People’s Republic of China as a\r\nMember of the United Nations. Vanuatu again\r\nreiterates its unwavering support for one China and\r\nurges all members of the United Nations to work in the\r\ninterests of world peace and stability in the Asia-\r\nPacific region.\r\nIn conclusion, I must bring to the attention of the\r\nAssembly another priority issue that is of grave\r\nimportance to my Government and nation. I would\r\nonce again like to raise the matter of the relocation of\r\nthe Pacific Operations Centre of the Economic and\r\nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)\r\nfrom Vanuatu to another location. My Government was\r\nnot properly consulted in that regard, and requests that\r\nthe decision to relocate the Centre from Vanuatu be\r\nreconsidered. If the Centre’s relevance in the region is\r\nbeing questioned, then my Government would propose\r\nthat a proper review be carried out with a view to\r\nrestructuring the ESCAP office in order to relocate the\r\nPacific Operations Centre to Bangkok. Programmes\r\nand activities under ESCAP responsibility may be\r\nbetter coordinated through the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme activities in the region.\r\nI hope that wisdom will prevail as the debate\r\ncontinues on our future destiny. Despite all our\r\ndifferences and diversity, human security for all is our\r\nmain goal. That should remain the focus of the United\r\nNations agenda. The cardinal question is whether\r\nMembers will allow the United Nations to undertake\r\nserious reforms in meeting the challenges ahead. The\r\nfuture remains in our hands.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. François-Xavier Ngoubeyou,\r\nMinister of State in Charge of External Relations of the\r\nRepublic of Cameroon.\r\nMr. Ngoubeyou (Cameroon) (spoke in French):\r\nOn 10 June 2004, you, Mr. President, were elected to\r\nserve as President of the General Assembly. As you\r\nbegin your term of office, I have the great pleasure of\r\nconveying to you the warm and fraternal\r\ncongratulations of the people of Cameroon — brother,\r\nneighbour and friend of your country, Gabon — as well\r\nas from Cameroon’s Government and its President,\r\nMr. Paul Biya. Your election crowns an outstanding\r\ncareer and is a tribute to Gabon’s diplomacy under the\r\nwise guidance of President El Hadj Omar Bongo\r\nOndimba.\r\nCameroon would also like to congratulate the\r\nother members of the Bureau of the fifty-ninth session\r\nof the General Assembly. We would like to reiterate\r\nour full cooperation to you, Mr. President, and to say\r\nthat we are at your disposal. In addition, I would like to\r\ntake this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Julian Hunte, for the important work he\r\naccomplished with the tireless support of the Bureau,\r\nincluding in particular with regard to our common\r\nendeavour to reform the Organization and enhance its\r\neffectiveness by, among other things, reviewing the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s methods of work.\r\nThe waning year has strengthened our common\r\nresolve to strengthen multilateralism and to give it\r\nprominence in the management of international affairs\r\nin the new international order, with the United Nations\r\nas the foundation and framework of that order. Despite\r\nthe ups and downs that the United Nations has\r\nexperienced, in particular in the Security Council, it is\r\ntime for there to be an active dialogue among the\r\nworld’s nations, all of which adhere to the universality\r\nof the Organization and its unique and irreplaceable\r\nrole in promoting economic and social development\r\nand international peace and security. The world of\r\ncourse faces numerous challenges, some of which are\r\nnew in nature. Others, however, although older and\r\nbetter known, remain without real solutions — either\r\ndue to their complexity or because of a lack of\r\ndetermination on the part of the international\r\ncommunity to mobilize ways and means commensurate\r\nwith the stakes.\r\nIn January 2005, the General Assembly will\r\nreceive a report from the Panel of eminent persons\r\nappointed by the Secretary-General to reflect on\r\nreforms that could make the Organization more\r\neffective, transparent and democratic, as well as better\r\nable to carry out its mission and tackle the new\r\nchallenges requiring our attention. I trust that the Panel\r\nwill not fail to rely upon previous relevant proposals\r\nwhen framing its recommendations, in particular those\r\nmade at the Millennium Summit. As far as Cameroon\r\nis concerned, mankind must be at the heart of any\r\nsubstantive reform of the United Nations.\r\nMy country continues to promote the proposal\r\nput forth here in New York during the Millennium\r\nSummit by President Paul Biya. That proposal called\r\nfor the creation within the Secretariat of an\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\ninternational ethics-monitoring centre entrusted with\r\nthe task of “promoting fundamental and universal\r\nhuman values between and within nations”. (A/55/PV.5,\r\np. 27)\r\nIn addition, it also seems that the time has come\r\nfor the General Assembly to express its views on the\r\nissue of Security Council reform, and in particular with\r\nregard to expanding its membership. The proposals that\r\nhave been introduced in the General Assembly are\r\nundoubtedly a very good basis for discussion. The\r\nAssembly will recall that the Organization of African\r\nUnity called for a reconstituted Security Council that\r\nincluded seven seats for Africa, including 2 permanent\r\nseats. That proposal, which Cameroon fully endorses,\r\nstill stands. Nevertheless, we must forge concrete\r\nconsensus without delay, as an indicator of greater\r\ntransparency and renewed legitimacy of a Security\r\nCouncil that is more effective and credible.\r\nStanding side-by-side with other nations,\r\nCameroon is resolutely committed to eradicating new\r\nthreats that seriously imperil international peace and\r\nsecurity. We unreservedly condemn international\r\nterrorism and all forms of fundamentalism and\r\nextremism, which provide it with both a breeding\r\nground and a vehicle. It is for that reason that we\r\nreiterate our solidarity with all those who have fallen\r\nvictim to terrorism, most recently in Russia and the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nThe efforts undertaken by the Security Council in\r\nthat regard are encouraging. However, we believe that\r\nthe time has come for worldwide globalization and the\r\nsummit level. It is time to act together against the\r\nterrorist hydra. Cameroon once again suggests that a\r\nhigh-level conference be urgently convened to define\r\ncollectively more effective strategies to combat\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe new threats confronting the world are real\r\nchallenges, and it is only right that they be given\r\ncertain priority. That approach will be quite appropriate\r\nas the Organization’s other traditional concerns\r\ncontinue to enjoy our full attention. Cameroon believes\r\nthat nothing can justify terrorism. Nevertheless, the\r\nresponse to terrorism and to other new threats cannot\r\nbe solely a military response.\r\nThe modern world must focus on the causes of\r\nviolence and on the injustices that undermine\r\ninternational peace. Resolving regional conflicts in\r\nAfrica, the Middle East and elsewhere; combating\r\npoverty and mobilizing against great epidemics, and\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS in particular; redressing the\r\nimbalance in world trade in goods and services; and\r\naddressing the foreign debt of poor countries — like\r\nthe new threats, all these challenges require the\r\nOrganization’s attention.\r\nI mention this parallel because we run a real risk,\r\ntoday, of getting used to the endemic poverty that kills\r\nthousands every day, particularly in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica. Solidarity with the poor must become a very\r\nconcrete reality rather than mere lip service. In order to\r\ncombat hunger and poverty, we need massive private\r\nand public financing. We need relief from the burden\r\nof debt.\r\nThe world today is faced with a paradox. The\r\npoorest countries are the ones that have the most open\r\nand liberal economies. Even their non-commercial\r\nsector has been privatized, causing unemployment for\r\nmillions of citizens and the destabilization of basic\r\nsocial sectors, such as water and electricity, for many\r\nyears, with harmful consequences for all economic\r\nactivity. The current economic order, if we are not\r\ncareful, could consolidate — and indeed make\r\npermanent — current relations based on force, to the\r\nbenefit of rich countries and to the detriment of poor\r\ncountries. The rich can easily subsidize their\r\nagriculture, their industry and their airlines, among\r\nother sectors. The poor countries, however, under the\r\nwatchful eyes of financial institutions in which their\r\nvoices go unheard, must submit themselves to the law\r\nof the market. Cotton from West and Central Africa is\r\na perfect example of unbalanced and unfair\r\nglobalization. We should not become discouraged,\r\nhowever, and Cameroon is convinced that under your\r\npresidency, Sir, the fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly will adopt strong initiatives to help poor\r\ncountries and to ensure a readjustment of globalization,\r\nmaking it more equitable and beneficial to all.\r\nInternational economic relations must be profoundly\r\nreformed with a view to ensuring greater United\r\nNations involvement.\r\nThe same issues that apply to the economy also\r\napply to the subject of health. The world, viewed in its\r\nentirety, is rich. It has the means of providing adequate\r\nhealth for all. Medicines exist that should make it\r\npossible to contain the major pandemics. Research\r\nscientists and the pharmaceutical industry are making\r\ngreat strides on a daily basis in combating malaria,\r\ntuberculosis, meningitis and cholera, among other\r\ndiseases. Those scourges, however, kill millions of\r\nAfricans every year. The reason for this is poverty and\r\ninsufficient means to obtain care and medicines.\r\n29\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nWith regard to HIV/AIDS, which is far more\r\nterrible since it is thus far incurable, we welcome the\r\nfact that scientific research today is making it possible\r\nto drastically diminish its devastating scope. The\r\nBangkok International AIDS Conference has certainly\r\ngiven reason for hope. Significant pledges to help\r\neradicate this scourge are announced on a daily basis.\r\nUnfortunately, most of the persons infected by the HIV\r\nvirus are unable to obtain anti-retroviral medications\r\nsince they lack the necessary financial means.\r\nCombating AIDS is a worldwide cause, rallying us all.\r\nI have touched upon regional conflicts. Their\r\nnegative impact on the international environment,\r\nwhether politically, economically or in humanitarian\r\nand security terms, requires no further demonstration.\r\nAfrica, as if not already handicapped enough, is the\r\ncontinent most plagued by conflict, as evidenced by the\r\nSecurity Council agenda.\r\nThe situation in some countries gives rise to\r\nrelative optimism. Developments in Liberia, Sierra\r\nLeone, Guinea-Bissau and the Comoros give us reasons\r\nfor hope. Recent firm commitments by political actors\r\nin the crisis in Côte d’Ivoire doubtless give rise to\r\nbetter prospects for that fraternal, friendly country.\r\nIn Central Africa, despite some improvement, the\r\nsituation remains worrisome. It calls for constant\r\nvigilance and increased involvement on all levels by\r\nthe international community. In this respect, the\r\ninternational conference on the Great Lakes region,\r\nwhich has been announced several times but has\r\nalways been deferred, must finally be held as\r\nscheduled in November 2004. That will make it\r\npossible to lay a fresh foundation for constructive\r\ncooperation among the countries of the region,\r\nconsistent with the interests of their respective peoples.\r\nStill with regard to Central Africa, it is our hope\r\nthat, at this session, the debate on cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Economic Community of\r\nCentral African States (ECCAS) will address the\r\nconcerns expressed by our subregion’s heads of State\r\nto the Secretary-General’s multidisciplinary assessment\r\nmission to Central Africa. I recall here that the heads\r\nof State had unanimously and firmly expressed a desire\r\nfor a political presence by the Secretary-General in\r\nCentral Africa through a permanent subregional\r\nstructure. We take note of the statement made here in\r\nthis connection by the delegation of the Republic of the\r\nCongo, as Chairman of ECCAS.\r\nThe crisis in Darfur is currently a matter of grave\r\nconcern on our continent. Wishing to prevent a\r\ncatastrophe such as has occurred in the past, the\r\nAfrican Union has squarely embraced this question\r\nwith the decisive support of the Security Council and\r\nother international partners. We all hope a positive\r\nsolution will be reached quickly. In order to do this,\r\ndialogue must be ongoing, forward-looking and\r\nvoluntary on the part of all protagonists in the crisis.\r\nTo be sure, the political will and determination of the\r\nSudanese authorities are key; they must continue to\r\ndisplay these qualities. That is the only way that an\r\nunprecedented humanitarian catastrophe will be\r\navoided. In any case, the international community must\r\nbe further mobilized behind the African Union in order\r\nto ward off this curse and avert this major crisis\r\nwithout delay.\r\nMy country is profoundly devoted to peace. It\r\nwill spare no effort to promote the peaceful settlement\r\nof disputes. In that connection, it will continue to\r\npromote peace throughout the world, and specifically\r\nin Africa, in Central Africa and in the Gulf of Guinea.\r\nAs members know, the International Court of\r\nJustice in The Hague, after lengthy deliberations\r\nlasting almost 10 years, handed down its judgment, on\r\n10 October 2002, relating to the boundary dispute\r\nbetween Cameroon and Nigeria. Both countries, within\r\nthe context of the Joint Commission established by the\r\nSecretary-General and chaired by his Special\r\nRepresentative, have agreed to define the ways and\r\nmeans of implementing that judgment and have\r\nadopted a programme of work with a specific\r\ntimetable, approved on 31 January 2004 by their heads\r\nof State and the Secretary-General. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has eloquently reported on the progress that\r\nhas been made in this connection. We call upon the\r\nUnited Nations family to give its full support to the\r\nSecretary-General and to use its influence to help\r\nNigeria and Cameroon in implementing the judgment\r\nof the International Court of Justice.\r\nWhether it be the reform of our Organization to\r\nmake it more efficient, democratic and legitimate; or\r\nthe Middle East peace process to re-launch the road\r\nmap; or pacification, reconstruction, enhanced security\r\nand institution-building in Iraq and Afghanistan; or the\r\nsettlement of African disputes and the post-conflict\r\nreconstruction of such countries; or combating AIDS\r\nand other pandemics; or adjusting financial and trade\r\nmechanisms to help the weakest and most exposed\r\ncountries; or, finally, eliminating poverty:\r\nMr. President, our dear brother, we think that you have\r\na full plate. Quite fortunately, your great qualities will\r\n30\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nallow you to involve the international community in\r\nworking on these problems.\r\nMoreover, you have at your side the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of our Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan, Nobel\r\nPeace Prize laureate, whose actions and commitments\r\nto promote peace, security and development today\r\nserve as both a lever and an engine for the activities\r\nundertaken by the international community as a whole.\r\nYou also have at your side, I am sure, the entirety of\r\nthe United Nations membership. Cameroon, for its\r\npart, will spare no effort to support you in your lofty\r\nmission.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Tom Butime, acting Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Uganda.\r\nMr. Butime (Uganda): On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, the people of Uganda, and on my own\r\nbehalf, I would like to congratulate you, Mr. Jean Ping,\r\nfrom the sister African Republic of Gabon, upon your\r\nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-ninth session. I have every confidence in your\r\nstewardship in steering the session to a successful\r\nconclusion.\r\nI thank the Secretary-General for his excellent\r\nleadership, especially during these trying times for the\r\nUnited Nations. I note with satisfaction that, after a\r\nyear in which the centrality of the United Nations in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security has\r\ncome under serious challenge, there seems to be a\r\nreturn to the more widely accepted multilateral\r\napproach to resolving global challenges.\r\nTerrorism continues to be one of the biggest\r\nthreats to international peace and security. Since\r\n11 September 2001, thousands of innocent people,\r\nincluding women and children, have been killed or\r\nmaimed as a result of indiscriminate terrorist acts. This\r\nyear, the world has witnessed many innocent civilians\r\nmassacred in cold blood, hostages beheaded in the\r\nmost barbaric manner, children mutilated by suicide\r\nbombers and terrorist groups, very often in the name of\r\nextremist and misguided causes and ideologies.\r\nWhether it is the recent appalling attack on school\r\nchildren in the Russian town of Beslan, or the massacre\r\nof civilians in Balonyo in northern Uganda, the\r\nintention of terrorists is the same: to undermine and\r\ndivide our societies, overthrow elected Governments,\r\nand to strike at the heart of international peace and\r\nstability.\r\nThe Uganda delegation condemns those terrorist\r\nacts in the strongest terms. We do not accept that any\r\ncause, however genuine, warrants the indiscriminate\r\ndestruction of human life or property.\r\nIn Uganda, we have been fighting against a\r\nterrorist organization known as the Lord’s Resistance\r\nArmy, based in southern Sudan. That organization has\r\nkilled, maimed and abducted tens of thousands of\r\nUgandan children in the northern part of Uganda. The\r\nacts of plunder and destruction by those criminals have\r\nlaid to waste entire villages and driven helpless\r\nvillagers into camps for internally displaced persons.\r\nThe Government of Uganda is sparing no effort, with\r\nthe cooperation of the Government of Sudan, to end\r\nthat situation and restore peace and stability in this\r\narea. We are confident that soon the remnants of those\r\nterrorists will have been eliminated or captured.\r\nDespite amnesty legislation and a standing offer of\r\npardon by our President, very few have responded.\r\nHowever, recently some improvement in reporting has\r\nbeen observed.\r\nUganda welcomes the recent restoration of\r\nsovereignty to the Iraqi people. We call upon the\r\nUnited Nations, in particular, and the international\r\ncommunity as a whole, to do everything possible to\r\nassist the interim Government in the rehabilitation of\r\nIraq and re-establishment of the physical and political\r\ninfrastructure to allow the holding of scheduled\r\nelections in that country.\r\nThe conflict between Israel and Palestine, often\r\ndriven by rigid positions, continues to pose a serious\r\nthreat to peace and stability in the Middle East. Uganda\r\nsupports the Quartet-led road map for a comprehensive\r\npeaceful settlement in the Middle East. We support the\r\nestablishment of a Palestinian State existing side-by-\r\nside and in peace with Israel within secure and\r\nrecognized borders, in accordance with relevant United\r\nNations Security Council resolutions.\r\nAfter more than 50 years of violence and\r\nbloodshed, both the Israelis and Palestinians must\r\nrethink their positions. New, creative approaches to a\r\ncomprehensive peace should therefore be sought for\r\nthe sake of their peoples. Every year we adopt\r\nresolutions which remain mere paper. Resolutions are\r\nnot solutions in themselves; it is high time we engaged\r\nconstructively in the serious search for a solution, for\r\nthe future of humanity and the Middle East.\r\nTurning to the Great Lakes region, we note with\r\nsatisfaction the positive developments with regard to\r\nthe peace processes in various conflict situations. In\r\n31\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nBurundi, the transitional Government has been\r\nconsolidated with almost all the fighting groups\r\nsubscribing to the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation\r\nAgreement for Burundi. We call upon the groups still\r\nremaining outside the peace settlement to cease their\r\nmilitary operations and join the peace process. We\r\ncongratulate the African peace mission for its\r\ncontribution to the peace process and we welcome the\r\ndeployment of United Nations peacekeepers to\r\nBurundi. Election dates may change, but the elections\r\nmust be held sooner or later. Elections, a new\r\nGovernment and good proposals relating to the\r\nquestion of representation — all must work for peace\r\nfor Burundi. It is therefore important that the\r\ninternational community extend the necessary\r\nassistance for the consolidation of peace, stability,\r\nrehabilitation and development of Burundi.\r\nUganda remains committed to supporting the\r\npeace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\n(DRC). We urge all parties in the Government of\r\nNational Unity in Kinshasa to remain committed to the\r\nPretoria Peace Agreement and to resist any temptation\r\nto resume hostilities. We also call upon the Security\r\nCouncil to strengthen the United Nations Organization\r\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\n(MONUC) under Chapter VII of the Charter to\r\nconsolidate its peacekeeping operations. A robust\r\nMONUC force would be critical for the enforcement of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1493 (2003) on the arms\r\nembargo against militias, as well as the disarmament,\r\ndemobilization, rehabilitation, resettlement and\r\nreintegration of all armed rebel groups and militias\r\noperating on the territory of the DRC. That would also\r\nserve to reduce, and hopefully to eliminate, inter-ethnic\r\nclashes in the eastern Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and help to reassure neighbouring countries\r\nabout cross-border security. It may also be important to\r\ninclude other legitimate groups in the Government of\r\nNational Unity and Transition in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo in order to enhance peace. We\r\nbelieve that before democratic elections are held it is\r\nimportant to create a consensus for peace and security.\r\nUganda believes that as a result of the positive\r\nachievements in the peace processes in Burundi and the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo there is an urgent\r\nneed to convene the international conference on the\r\nGreat Lakes region under the auspices of the United\r\nNations and the African Union. The conference, which\r\nis scheduled to take place in Dar es Salaam, United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania, in November 2004, will bring\r\ntogether a core group of the Great Lakes countries and\r\nthe neighbouring countries affected by the conflicts or\r\nthose that, by infection, contribute to them.\r\nIn order to consolidate the peace efforts, we hope\r\nthat the Great Lakes regional conference will involve\r\nall stakeholders in the development of a strategic plan\r\nof action on the key issues, including regional peace\r\nand security, development, post-conflict reconstruction\r\nand regional integration in the context of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). I am\r\nglad to note that countries of the Great Lakes region,\r\nincluding Uganda, have already embarked on a\r\npreparatory process for the conference involving youth\r\nand women’s groups, non-governmental organizations\r\nand local government officials from all border districts.\r\nWe believe that this inclusive process will ensure\r\nnational ownership and commitment to the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations of the\r\nconference.\r\nThe delegation of Uganda welcomes the peace\r\naccords recently signed in Nairobi between the\r\nGovernment of Sudan and the Sudan People’s\r\nLiberation Movement and Liberation Army (SPLM/A).\r\nWe hope that those accords will lead to the end of the\r\nlong-running conflict, which has caused untold\r\nsuffering to the people of the southern Sudan and led to\r\ninsecurity in neighbouring countries — particularly my\r\nown, Uganda. With the return of peace and stability in\r\nthe southern Sudan, we are confident that we will be\r\nable to bring to an end the Lord’s Resistance Army\r\nattacks against our people in the northern part of\r\nUganda.\r\nMy country is an active participant in the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development initiative\r\nthat has brought the various factions in Somalia\r\ntogether to the negotiating table to end the conflict in\r\nthat country. We note with great satisfaction the\r\nprogress that has so far been made, and we salute the\r\npeople of Somalia for coming together to establish a\r\nParliament embracing all groups.\r\nIn 2005 the United Nations will observe the fifth\r\nanniversary of the Millennium Summit, where we\r\npledged our political will and commitment to a number\r\nof Millennium Development Goals, including the\r\nreduction of poverty by 50 per cent by 2015. It is,\r\ntherefore, of great concern that in many parts of Africa\r\npoverty levels are rising as per capita incomes continue\r\nto decline and that infant and maternal mortality rates\r\nare on the increase, while official development\r\nassistance commitments remain unfulfilled.\r\n32\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nIn order to make progress in meeting the\r\nMillennium Development Goals and ensuring the\r\nequitable sharing of the benefits of globalization, the\r\nGeneral Assembly should focus on the following, inter\r\nalia: effective follow-up to and implementation of the\r\nvarious plans of action, declarations and strategies\r\nrelating to the Monterrey Consensus on financing for\r\ndevelopment, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation\r\non sustainable development, the Brussels Declaration\r\nand Programme of Action for the Least Developed\r\nCountries and the Almaty Programme of Action on\r\nlandlocked developing countries; restructuring of the\r\nglobal trading system, especially in agriculture, mode 4\r\ntrade in services and increasing value-added export\r\nproducts from the developing countries; mobilization\r\nof adequate resources to fight malaria, tuberculosis and\r\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic, covering prevention, care\r\nand research and development to ensure the provision\r\nof cheaper and more effective drugs and possibly the\r\ndiscovery of an HIV/AIDS vaccine; strengthening of\r\nSouth-South cooperation, including measures by the\r\nmore advanced developing countries to open their\r\nmarkets to products from the least developed countries;\r\nand stronger international support for NEPAD, which\r\nreflects Africa’s priorities to address development,\r\ngovernance and the security challenges facing the\r\ncontinent. Critical support areas will include market\r\naccess, measures to encourage increased foreign direct\r\ninvestment in African countries, higher levels of\r\nofficial development assistance for infrastructure and\r\nhuman resources development, ensuring sustainable\r\ndebt levels, regional integration, enhancement of the\r\nAfrican Union’s capacity to deal with conflict\r\nsituations and implementation of the African Peer\r\nReview Mechanism.\r\nAs the United Nations approaches its sixtieth\r\nbirthday in 2005, the need for revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and restructuring of the Security\r\nCouncil has never been greater. The need for reform of\r\nthe United Nations is imperative if we want to enhance\r\nthe role of the Organization and the effectiveness of\r\nmultilateralism to address emerging hard threats such\r\nas terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and\r\ngenocide, as well as other challenges, such as\r\npersistent poverty and HIV/AIDS. It is therefore fitting\r\nthat the report of the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change will be discussed in 2005.\r\nWith regard to reform of the Security Council,\r\nthe restructuring should reflect the need for\r\ndemocratization and ensuring a balanced and equitable\r\ngeographical representation. We believe that Africa\r\nshould be allocated no less than two permanent and\r\nfive non-permanent seats in the expanded Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn summary, Uganda is calling for stronger\r\ncollective action against international terrorism and\r\nsupport for the post-conflict rehabilitation and\r\ndevelopment programme in northern Uganda. We have\r\nnoted the positive developments in the Great Lakes\r\nregion and stressed the importance of convening the\r\ninternational conference on the Great Lakes region in\r\nDar es Salaam in November 2004. We have highlighted\r\nthe significance of 2005 — as the both the sixtieth\r\nbirthday of the United Nations and the fifth\r\nanniversary of the Millennium Summit — as a key\r\ntime to focus on meeting the Millennium Development\r\nGoals and the revitalization and restructuring of the\r\nUnited Nations to enhance the role of the Organization\r\nand to ensure the effectiveness of collective\r\nmultilateral action.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): We have heard\r\nthe last speaker in the debate for this meeting.\r\nA number of representatives have asked to speak\r\nin exercise of the right of reply. May I remind\r\nMembers that statements in exercise of the right of\r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention\r\nand to 5 minutes for the second and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Tekle (Eritrea): At the 13th meeting the\r\nForeign Minister of Ethiopia has accused the\r\nGovernment of Eritrea of endangering the peace\r\nprocess because it refused to enter into a dialogue with\r\nhis Government to discuss the revision of the final and\r\nbinding decision of the Eritrea/Ethiopia Boundary\r\nCommission. That is no surprise to Eritreans, who\r\nhave, by now, become accustomed to such Orwellian\r\nsubterfuge and doublespeak. The Foreign Minister of\r\nEthiopia is pinning hope on the international\r\ncommunity’s not being fully aware of the full extent of\r\nthe contents of the Algiers Agreements, the mandate\r\nand decisions of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary\r\nCommission (EEBC) and the numerous resolutions of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nThe peace process has, in fact, been endangered\r\nby his Government’s rejection of the final and binding\r\ndecision of the EEBC and its refusal to pay heed to the\r\nSecurity Council’s repeated calls for his country’s\r\ncompliance with the decision and for its cooperation\r\nwith the Commission so as to expeditiously finalize the\r\ndemarcation process, which is the cornerstone of the\r\nAlgiers Agreements.\r\n33\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\nI would like to refer to some of the issues raised\r\nby the Foreign Minister and clarify them for the record\r\nand in the interests of truth — a truth that the rest of\r\nthe world recognizes.\r\nFirst, the Foreign Minister declared that\r\n“it has become difficult for Ethiopia and Eritrea\r\nto formally complete the peace process because\r\nof complications that have been created in\r\nconnection with the implementation of some\r\naspects of the decision of the Eritrea/Ethiopia\r\nBoundary Commission”.\r\nIt should be clear to all that the sole complication\r\nin the peace process arises from Ethiopia’s rejection of\r\nthe final and binding decision of the Commission and\r\nits refusal to cooperate with the EEBC in the\r\nexpeditious demarcation of the border, in spite of\r\nnumerous Security Council resolutions and\r\ndeclarations by the European Union and others.\r\nIn paragraph 7 of Security Council resolution\r\n1560 (2004), dated 14 September 2004, the Council\r\n“Urges Ethiopia to show the political will to\r\nreaffirm unequivocally its acceptance of the\r\nBoundary Commission’s decision, and take the\r\nnecessary steps to enable the Commission to\r\ndemarcate the border without further delay”.\r\nIn a declaration made on 17 September 2004, the\r\nEuropean Union\r\n“urges Ethiopia to abide by the Boundary\r\nCommission’s decision, as agreed in the Algiers\r\nPeace Agreement and to fully cooperate with the\r\nBoundary Commission in the implementation of\r\nthe decision.”\r\nI also remind His Excellency the Foreign\r\nMinister that, in April 2002, he himself declared that\r\n“According to the Algiers peace deal, both parties\r\nshould accept the decision of the Boundary\r\nCommission as final and binding with no right to\r\nappeal”.\r\nIn this connection, the Eritrean delegation\r\nemphasizes that there is no other alternative to the\r\nimplementation, in good faith, of the final and binding\r\ndecision of the Commission, because any such attempt\r\nwould violate the provisions of the Algiers Agreements\r\nand international law.\r\nSecondly, the Foreign Minister has declared that\r\nthe decisions of the EEBC were only “observations”.\r\nThis, again, is at variance with article 4 (2) of the\r\nAlgiers Agreement of 12 December 2000, which\r\nempowers the Commission to delimit and demarcate\r\nthe colonial treaty borders and to make decisions —\r\nnot observations. He claims that the implementation of\r\nsome aspects of the “observations” of the Boundary\r\nCommission on demarcation are not in the interests of\r\npeace between the two countries and will not advance\r\nthe major objective of the Algiers Agreements.\r\nThe Eritrean delegation submits that peace — just\r\npeace — is guaranteed only when it is based on the\r\nrule of law, the sanctity of court decisions and respect\r\nfor the Charter. Any other arrangements based on the\r\nlaw of the jungle would be a root cause of conflict,\r\ninsecurity and instability. Ethiopia’s insistence on an\r\n“open-ended dialogue” on the boundary demarcation is\r\ncertain to lead to conflict. The Foreign Minister is in\r\nfact reiterating the position of his Prime Minister, who,\r\non 19 September 2003, declared that the Algiers\r\nAgreements should be replaced by an alternative\r\nmechanism.\r\nThirdly, at the 13th meeting the Foreign Minister\r\nclaims that\r\n“Nowhere in the whole text of the Agreement of\r\nDecember 2000 is provision made for any\r\nentity … to enforce a court decision”.\r\nAccording to preambular paragraph 3 of that\r\nAgreement, the parties recommit “themselves to the\r\nAgreement on Cessation of Hostilities, signed in\r\nAlgiers on 18 June 2000”. Article 1 (2) of the same\r\nAgreement states that “The parties shall respect and\r\nfully implement the provisions of the Agreement on\r\nCessation of Hostilities”.\r\nParagraph 14 of the Agreement on Cessation of\r\nHostilities states that the\r\n“OAU and the United Nations commit themselves\r\nto guarantee the respect for this commitment of\r\nthe two parties until the determination of the\r\ncommon border”,\r\nand stipulates that the guarantee shall comprise\r\n“Measures to be taken by the international\r\ncommunity should one or both of the parties\r\nviolate this commitment, including appropriate\r\nmeasures to be taken under Chapter VII of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter by the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council”.\r\nNothing could be clearer than that. Yet, incredible\r\nas it may seem, the Foreign Minister of Ethiopia this\r\nmorning accused Eritrea of “misleading the\r\n34\r\nA/59/PV.14\r\ninternational community”. Who is doing what? The\r\nForeign Minster seems to be confident enough to\r\ndeclare sanctions “unlikely to happen” because of\r\nassurances he may have received from certain quarters.\r\nFourthly, he stated that “Achieving peace and\r\nimplementing the demarcation of the common\r\nboundary between the two countries is primarily the\r\nresponsibility of Ethiopia and Eritrea”. We agree. Yet\r\nthis is a far cry from being solely the responsibility of\r\nthe two countries. The United Nations and the African\r\nUnion are guarantors of the Algiers Agreements,\r\nwhich, incidentally, are referred to in the Security\r\nCouncil’s most recent resolution on the subject —\r\nresolution 1531 (2004) — as including the\r\n12 December 2000 Agreement and the 18 June 2000\r\nCessation of Hostilities Agreement (S/2000/1183 and\r\nS/2000/601).\r\nAs guarantors, they become parties to the treaty,\r\nand as parties to the treaty they have obligations to\r\nensure the implementation of the agreements and\r\ncompliance by the parties by, inter alia, applying\r\nsanctions under Chapter VII.\r\nDuring the past 12 months, Ethiopia has been\r\nsystematic in its subversion of international law and\r\nthe accepted norms of international behaviour. The\r\npeople and the Government of Eritrea would like to\r\ninform the Assembly that Ethiopia’s unrestrained\r\nassault on the rule of law, including international law,\r\nand the sanctity of treaty agreements will not be\r\nlimited in their ill effects to the well-being of the States\r\nand the peoples of our two countries and our region\r\nonly. Lawlessness is a highly contagious virus, and it\r\nspreads far and wide at great speed. Nor do its\r\ndestructive consequences recognize boundaries.\r\nEthiopia’s attitude of intransigence and\r\nbellicosity is encouraged and sustained by the\r\nreluctance of the international community to enforce\r\ninternational law. The United Nations and the African\r\nUnion, in particular, as well as the European Union and\r\nthe Government of the United States, which are,\r\nrespectively, guarantors and witnesses of the Algiers\r\nAgreements, must shoulder additional political and\r\nmoral responsibility. The Algiers Agreements are clear\r\nin their provisions, which prescribe sanctions against\r\nthe party that reneges on its commitment. In fact,\r\nEthiopia had made repeated references to that\r\nprovision —\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I am sorry to\r\nhave to interrupt the representative of Eritrea, but the\r\n10-minute limit has now been exceeded. I would ask\r\nhim to conclude his statement.\r\nMr. Tekle (Eritrea): The light was green; I was\r\ngoing by the green light.\r\nIn any case, I have reached the concluding part of\r\nmy statement. Eritrea’s commitment to peace is clear\r\nand unqualified. Since the beginning of the conflict,\r\nthe Eritrean Government has done what it could to\r\nresolve all contentious issues by peaceful means —\r\nincluding the issue of the location of the village of\r\nBadme, which was the casus belli — through dialogue\r\nor through a legal mechanism. The Government of\r\nEthiopia refuses to even consider any such initiative.\r\nEritreans are still committed to peace, peace with\r\njustice, peace based on the rule of law and the decision\r\nof the arbitration commission. They have never\r\nthreatened and are not now threatening or sabre-rattling\r\nwith a view to blackmailing the international\r\ncommunity to assume policies of appeasement. They\r\nhave at all times kept their word and honoured their\r\nundertakings. They shall continue to do so.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I give the floor\r\nto the representative of Indonesia.\r\nMr. Komar (Indonesia): My delegation begs\r\nyour indulgence to take the floor to exercise its right of\r\nreply, particularly with reference to the earlier\r\nstatement by the delegation of Vanuatu.\r\nIn its earlier intervention, the delegation of\r\nVanuatu once again and incorrectly raised the status of\r\nWest Papua, which is unquestionably an integral part\r\nof the Republic of Indonesia. The legal status of the\r\nprovince of West Papua was resolved and recognized\r\nby the international community decades ago. It is,\r\nindeed, our common obligation to consistently uphold\r\nthe General Assembly’s decision rather than question\r\nthe unquestionable. Therefore, my delegation strongly\r\nrejects the reference made by the delegation of\r\nVanuatu.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.35 p.m.\r\n"
