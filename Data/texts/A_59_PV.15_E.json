(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the\r\nRepublic of Colombia\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill hear an address by the President of the Republic of\r\nColombia.\r\nMr. Alvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the Republic\r\nof Colombia, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Alvaro Uribe\r\nVélez, President of the Republic of Colombia, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Uribe Vélez (spoke in Spanish): I am\r\naddressing the General Assembly once again, at a time\r\nwhen the people and the institutions of Colombia are\r\nmaking great progress in their struggle to achieve\r\ndemocratic security. Such security would enable all\r\ncitizens to live in peace, express their political views\r\nwithout putting their lives in danger and to support or\r\noppose the Government while fully respecting different\r\nopinions.\r\nThat policy has made significant progress in\r\nreducing murders, kidnappings and other terrorist acts,\r\nas well as population displacement and the growing of\r\nillicit drug crops. There is still a great deal to be done,\r\nbut if we are persistent we will prevail.\r\nDemocratic security is one of Colombia’s highest\r\npriorities if we are to regain credibility and if our\r\ncitizens are once again to have confidence in our\r\ninstitutions. When trust is destroyed, the ties between\r\nthe citizen and the nation are broken. Such trust\r\nrequires transparency in public and private actions, as\r\nwell as economic revitalization and social cohesion.\r\nSocial cohesion builds trust among citizens and\r\nbetween citizens and the State. Social cohesion is the\r\nenemy of poverty and helps to promote equal\r\nopportunities. Colombia has established a legal\r\nframework to ensure that the benefits of economic\r\ngrowth lead to poverty eradication. Yet Colombia’s\r\ngrowth, which during the 1960s and 1970s was\r\naveraging 4.5 per cent a year, fell to an average of 2\r\nper cent after 1980. That decline encouraged the\r\ninformal economy, and was accompanied by poverty.\r\nThe contrast became increasingly obvious between the\r\nformal private sector — which was fair with its\r\nworkers and complied with its tax payments, but which\r\ngrew at a slow pace — and the informal sector, which,\r\nwith its overwhelming influence, drew in the destitute\r\nmasses.\r\nDrug trafficking, which bankrolls terrorism,\r\nreversed the trend towards land distribution, through\r\nagrarian reform and the natural process of inheritance\r\nfrom one generation to the next.\r\nBetween 1994 and 2000, unemployment among\r\nheads of household grew from 4 per cent to 10 per\r\ncent, and overall unemployment grew from 7.5 per cent\r\nto 19 per cent. In relatively few years, the deficit\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nincreased from 1.5 per cent to 4.2 per cent of the gross\r\ndomestic product (GDP), public debt rose from 24 per\r\ncent to 54 per cent of GDP and 40 per cent of the\r\npublic budget was allocated to debt servicing and\r\nrepayment. Very low levels of private investment only\r\nmade the situation worse.\r\nDefeating poverty requires strong and sustained\r\neconomic growth. This in turn requires physical and\r\nlegal security, transparent regulations and\r\nmacroeconomic stability. Last year, Colombia forecast\r\ngrowth of 2.5 per cent — but growth was close to 4 per\r\ncent. This year we are endeavouring to achieve 5 per\r\ncent growth. We are able to do because we are\r\nrestoring confidence among investors. With such\r\ngrowth, unemployment has fallen three points,\r\nalthough it is still quite high. A positive sign is that\r\njobs are being created in sectors that will provide for\r\nsocial security and fair wages for workers. All that has\r\nhappened despite fiscal restrictions to public\r\ninvestment and in the midst of an intense struggle to\r\neliminate illicit drugs, which have become so\r\nsignificant that they now affect whether there will be\r\npositive or negative growth in our agricultural sector.\r\nAt one time, my generation explained violence as\r\nthe result of social inequities. My country’s experience\r\nover many decades allows me to affirm that terrorist\r\nviolence has increased poverty and has destroyed the\r\npossibility of eliminating social inequity. Violence has\r\nworsened poverty and has exploited it to perpetuate\r\nitself.\r\nOur goal is to reduce poverty at a rate equal to or\r\nhigher than economic growth. To a great extent, our\r\nsocial investment programme depends on sound and\r\nsustained economic growth. Therefore, our social\r\ninvestment programme goes hand in hand with our\r\ndemocratic security policy. If we neglect security\r\nmeasures that respect democratic values, terrorism will\r\ngrow, we will lose momentum in defeating it,\r\ninvestment will be affected, the strength of our\r\neconomic recovery will weaken and we could be left\r\nwithout resources for social investment.\r\nToday’s equality lies in economic and social\r\nopportunity. That is why we have placed so much\r\nemphasis on education. We have increased elementary\r\nschool enrolment by 750,000, but the country still\r\nneeds classroom space for 1.25 million new pupils. In\r\n25 months we have increased technical training by two\r\nand a half times, promoting basic employment skills to\r\nenable young people to join the work force while\r\ncontinuing their studies. In the cities and in the\r\ncountryside, we have been carrying out a silent\r\nrevolution in technical training that will reach 4\r\nmillion young people a year by 2006.\r\nA subsidy is being paid to 340,000 poor families\r\nto improve their children’s nutrition and ensure school\r\nattendance. There are now 503,000 children in the new\r\nbreakfast programme for children under five; that\r\nnumber will double in 2005. That, together with the\r\nschool cafeterias and the “Community Mothers”\r\nprogramme, will reach more than 6 million children\r\nunder various nutrition programmes.\r\nBy December, when this Administration will\r\nhave been in office for 28 months, more than 4 million\r\npoor Colombians will have enrolled in the subsidized\r\nhealth programme, in addition to the 13 million who\r\nwere already protected. We are carrying out legal and\r\nadministrative reforms to increase coverage, with\r\nimproved transparency and an effective and efficient\r\nuse of resources.\r\nColombia has more than 600,000 senior adults\r\nliving in extreme poverty. In the past, 60,000 of them\r\nreceived a cash subsidy. This year, we have raised the\r\nnumber to 172,000 of our elderly compatriots. We are\r\nnow starting a new programme to deliver one meal a\r\nday to 400,000 more who do not receive the cash\r\nsubsidy. In addition, this year we are paying more than\r\n$100 million in subsidies to provide electricity to low-\r\nincome members of the population.\r\nWe are also subsidizing more than 7,000\r\nreintegrated former members of various violent groups.\r\nThis is part of a huge, silent, but effective peace\r\nprocess. When one of those persons is reintegrated, he\r\nsees the support of the State and the community,\r\nreconciles himself with civic institutions, embraces\r\ndemocracy and coexistence and rejects any justification\r\nfor violence. We hope that many more thousands will\r\nfollow, but we will require international cooperation\r\nfor this programme.\r\nWe are subsidizing 21,000 forest ranger families,\r\nwho were formerly involved in illicit drug crops and\r\nare now committed to eliminating them and to\r\nrecovering their tropical forests. Their task is essential\r\nfor mankind, considering Colombia’s rich biodiversity\r\nand its 578,000 square kilometres of jungle, which are\r\nthreatened by illicit drugs. To guarantee their food\r\nsecurity, we are also subsidizing 700,000 farmers, and\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nthat number will soon reach 1 million; we are also\r\nsubsidizing the crops of farmers’ associations until they\r\nbecome productive and competitive. Poverty indicators\r\nshould take account of such subsidies, which are\r\nusually not included when measuring the income of\r\nthose families.\r\nColombia has suffered a tragedy in the form of\r\ninternal displacement. We have reduced its incidence\r\nby 40 per cent, but it is still high. We have facilitated\r\nthe return of more 70,000 people and we expect that\r\nnumber to increase. One State agency alone has\r\nmultiplied eightfold its budget to care for displaced\r\npersons.\r\nAs a result of a law approved at the beginning of\r\nthis Government’s tenure, the process for “ownership\r\nextinction” for illegally acquired assets has moved\r\nmore quickly. We expect that that mechanism will be\r\nused to advance constructive agrarian reform.\r\nBy paying additional taxes, the Colombian people\r\nare making an effort to finance security measures and\r\nrestore social investment levels, for a total that\r\nrepresents 2 per cent of our gross domestic product. We\r\nhave received the support of the multilateral banks, but\r\nwe require greater understanding from the financial\r\nmarkets: longer-term loans and lower interest rates. We\r\nare engaged in an intense struggle, and we need better\r\naccess to the markets of the industrialized countries.\r\nI would like to reaffirm Colombia’s commitment\r\nto multilateralism. Multilateralism must continuously\r\nimprove if it is to become more effective and restore\r\nthe lost consensus for safeguarding international peace.\r\nBuilding that consensus requires each State to feel that\r\nit is being heard and that it is being taken into account.\r\nI am grateful for the support of the United\r\nNations agencies in social matters. We are fully\r\nprepared to back the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to consolidate democracy and security in\r\nthe region, especially in Haiti. Colombia will be part of\r\nthe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. We\r\nwill cooperate with police experts in the fight against\r\ndrug trafficking, as well as with the humanitarian\r\npresence.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWe must all join in an effective international\r\nsolidarity movement with our Caribbean brothers, who\r\nare so seriously affected by the hurricane season.\r\nWe need the total commitment of the\r\ninternational community in the struggle against\r\nterrorism in Colombia. Terrorism in one country feeds\r\nand strengthens terrorist networks throughout the\r\nworld. The widows and orphans of violence in our\r\ncountry ask why we attach so much importance to\r\nterrorism in other parts of the world, and why some\r\nattach so little to the terrorism that besets Colombia. I\r\nmake this appeal from the depths of our profound\r\ndemocratic conviction. It is difficult to find another\r\ncountry facing such a challenge of terrorism while\r\nsimultaneously strengthening its democracy.\r\nToday, Colombia offer effective guarantees for\r\nthe exercise of political pluralism by means of our\r\ndemocratic security policy. Our institutions combat\r\nterrorism with the unflinching political will of the\r\nGovernment. They do so with courage, selflessness and\r\ntransparency. A dirty war has no place in our policies.\r\nA democratic State has the right to ask the world\r\nto demand that the terrorists return their kidnap victims\r\nrather than clamouring for lopsided agreements with\r\nterrorists. We ask the world for more decisive and more\r\neffective support. If it is broadened, the violent groups\r\nwill have no option but to abandon terrorism and to\r\naccept peace.\r\nWith the people of Colombia, its democratic\r\ninstitutions and the international community united, we\r\ncan make Colombia an example of the capacity to\r\ndefeat terrorism and observe human rights. And we can\r\nmake Colombia an example of the ability to defeat\r\nterrorism and of the will to build social justice.\r\nWe will expel terror with the help of legitimate\r\ninstitutions and of a community of solidarity and\r\njustice, with opportunities for its poorest members.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Álvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the Republic\r\nof Colombia, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Cyril Svoboda, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Czech Republic.\r\nMr. Svoboda (Czech Republic): Let me first\r\ncongratulate Mr. Jean Ping on his election as President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session and\r\nwish him every success in this important position. I\r\nwould also like to thank his predecessor, Mr. Julian\r\nHunte, for his relentless efforts and leadership\r\nthroughout the year.\r\nIn May, the Czech Republic became a member of\r\nthe European Union (EU). For the first time, we took\r\npart in the preparation of the EU statement presented\r\nhere last week by the Foreign Minister of the\r\nNetherlands, as well as in shaping the EU priorities for\r\nthe current General Assembly session. It goes without\r\nsaying that we fully associate ourselves with those\r\ntexts.\r\nWe share the commitment of the EU to effective\r\nmultilateralism, with the United Nations at its core.\r\nIndeed, the vision of a strong and truly universal\r\nUnited Nations is one of the fundamentals of Czech\r\nforeign policy.\r\nSecurity, or the lack of it, has emerged as the\r\nmost challenging problem today. International\r\nterrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, regional conflicts, State failure or\r\norganized crime — these are the threats menacing all\r\nof us.\r\nTerrorism spares no one anywhere in the world.\r\nThe brutality of the attacks and the increase in their\r\nnumber over the past year are frightening. It seems that\r\nthe whole nature of terrorism is changing. While most\r\nearlier terrorists tried to target specific persons or\r\ninstitutions, with the aim of gaining the sympathy of\r\nthe general public, today’s terrorists are solely intent\r\non spreading fear and terror. Their target is the general\r\npublic, each one of us, and the more killed the better.\r\nWhat can we expect of individuals who sacrifice\r\nunlimited numbers of their own people to a perverse\r\nideology? Their acquisition of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction would result in a deadly combination.\r\nAbsolute disregard for life by these “new”\r\nterrorists has also given rise to their most dangerous\r\ntool, the ideological suicide bomber. Previously,\r\nterrorists had to devote most of their energy to\r\nplanning escape routes and concealing themselves; a\r\nsuicide bomber, on the other hand, needs only to\r\nconcentrate on how best to hit and to destroy his target.\r\nThe diffusion of targets and the perpetrators’\r\nabsolute resolve mean that terrorist threats have\r\ncompletely permeated our public and private spaces,\r\neach area of which has become a defence site. All this\r\ncould ultimately lead to very disagreeable restrictions\r\non certain freedoms and rights. And this takes us full\r\ncircle.\r\nIf we are lax in understanding our roots and\r\nvalues, and if we do not have a comprehensive grasp of\r\nhuman rights, we could find that, in the end, we are\r\nunable to cope with the uneasy balance between\r\nsecurity and freedom.\r\nI do not want to speculate about cause and effect.\r\nIt is not the case that a terrorist attack is a reaction, an\r\ninappropriate reaction, to something. Terrorists’\r\nideology is aggressive and expansive, and they do not\r\nrecognize terms such as “conciliation” or\r\n“coexistence”. Therefore, each offer we make to\r\nnegotiate, each sign of unwillingness to defend\r\nourselves, is seen by them as further proof of our\r\nweakness and, by extension, of their “right” to assume\r\ncontrol of declining society.\r\nIn the fight against terrorism, nobody can remain\r\nneutral. The United Nations has to pave the way for\r\nthis fight at the global level. To be sure, the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee has done an outstanding job in\r\noverseeing the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) and in facilitating universal\r\nacceptance of the United Nations Conventions on\r\nterrorism; but certainly more can and should be done.\r\nThe true tests of our ability to cooperate are Iraq,\r\nAfghanistan and the Middle East.\r\nIraq continues to be of utmost concern to the\r\ninternational community. The full transfer of power to\r\nthe Iraqi Interim Government is a historic moment for\r\nthe country and an essential step on the road towards a\r\nfree, prosperous and secure country. The road will, no\r\ndoubt, be long and winding. Without the elimination of\r\nterrorist activities and the stabilization of the security\r\nsituation, political transition and economic recovery\r\nwill remain elusive.\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nLast summer, United Nations employees in Iraq\r\npaid the highest price for their commitment to help\r\nthose in need. Now, the Organization has new tasks\r\nbefore it, including those connected with preparations\r\nfor free elections in January 2005. However, a greater\r\nengagement of the United Nations requires a more\r\nsecure environment and stronger support from the\r\ninternational community. The Czech Republic’s\r\ncontribution is focused mainly on building up Iraqi\r\nsecurity forces and helping to finance the protection of\r\nthe United Nations presence in Iraq.\r\nIraq, however, must not divert our attention from\r\nother major security concerns, including Afghanistan,\r\nthe Middle East, Africa and the Balkans. In all these\r\nconflicts, my country seeks to play a constructive role,\r\ncontributing in various ways to the related efforts of\r\nthe international community. Thus, in Afghanistan, the\r\nCzech Republic is participating in the stabilization\r\nprocess and the rooting out of terrorism; in Africa, it is\r\ntaking part in peacekeeping operations; in Kosovo, we\r\nhave our largest military contingent abroad serving in\r\nthe Kosovo Force and we intend to contribute troops to\r\nthe new EU-led mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nAs for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we believe\r\nthat the role of the international community lies in\r\nproviding a trusted frame of reference. It is crucial that\r\nboth parties to the conflict make a sincere effort to\r\nimplement their obligations in order to achieve the\r\nvision of two States living side by side in peace and\r\nsecurity and in a peaceful and secure neighbourhood.\r\nLast but not least, Africa has to remain on our\r\nagenda. Ten years after the genocide in Rwanda,\r\nanother part of Africa is suffering from grave ethnic\r\nviolence. In Darfur, people are dying every day, and in\r\nthe Great Lakes region the situation is not much better.\r\nThe international community must not turn away from\r\nthose tragedies.\r\nSo far I have focused mainly on what we call\r\nhard threats to international security. But I do not want\r\nto create an impression that other problems plaguing\r\nthe contemporary world are of lesser importance.\r\nThose more traditional problems, or soft threats, also\r\ncontinue to deserve our undiminished attention. There\r\nis no question of these two threats competing for our\r\nresponse; there is no question of forgetting one in\r\nfavour of the other.\r\nThat is why the Czech Republic, as an emerging\r\ndonor country, supports the strengthening of\r\nmultilateral development assistance within the United\r\nNations system, as well as close cooperation among the\r\nUnited Nations funds and programmes and the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions. That is why we support and strive\r\nto contribute to activities undertaken in pursuit of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals and other\r\ninternationally agreed development targets.\r\nRespect for human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms remains a priority of Czech foreign policy.\r\nTogether with the rest of the EU, we place special\r\nemphasis on the abolition of the death penalty, the fight\r\nagainst torture — in fact, just a few days ago we signed\r\nthe Optional Protocol to the Convention against\r\nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\r\nTreatment or Punishment — the protection of children\r\nin armed conflicts and, of course, respect for the\r\nactivities of human rights defenders who,\r\nunfortunately, continue to face difficult conditions in a\r\nnumber of countries, such as Belarus, Myanmar and\r\nCuba, among others.\r\nConvinced that all people have equal rights and\r\ndignity, the Czech Republic is concerned about recent\r\nattempts to create a human being through cloning. We\r\ntherefore concur with those calling for the swift\r\nadoption of a legally binding instrument at the\r\nuniversal level regulating the cloning of human beings.\r\nFaced with the aforementioned challenges, the\r\nUnited Nations has to change. Of course, United\r\nNations reform seems to be on everyone’s agenda.\r\nThere are, perhaps, too many reform processes going\r\non in parallel or partially overlapping. To achieve\r\ngenuine reform, however, we simply have to keep the\r\npressure on; the United Nations must continue\r\nconstantly to monitor itself and to continue its pursuit\r\nof improvement.\r\nThe Czech Republic considers itself a reform-\r\nminded country. It is an advocate of revitalization of\r\nthe General Assembly, strengthening of the United\r\nNations and reform and enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil. For many years, we have been actively\r\ninvolved in those processes, including through the\r\nCzech presidency of the fifty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We have no vested interest in these\r\nreforms except the better functioning and greater\r\nauthority of the whole United Nations. The Czech\r\nRepublic will continue to support inevitable reform\r\nmeasures, including enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil in both categories of membership. In\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nparticular, we support the aspiration of Germany and\r\nJapan to permanent seats, as well as the allocation of a\r\nfurther three new permanent seats for Africa, Asia and\r\nLatin America.\r\nWe greatly appreciate the reform efforts that the\r\nSecretary-General has made so far, and we expect his\r\nguidance to continue in the years to come. We eagerly\r\nawait the report of the High-Level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change, which should place United\r\nNations reform in a wider context of major global\r\nthreats and challenges.\r\nWe are determined to play an active role in\r\nfinding multilateral and United Nations-based solutions\r\nto numerous grave problems of the contemporary\r\nworld. An expression of that commitment and\r\ndetermination is our candidature for a non-permanent\r\nseat on the Security Council in 2008-2009.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency The Honourable Samuel R.\r\nInsanally, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic\r\nof Guyana and former President of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Insanally (Guyana): The General Assembly,\r\nthis most democratic and representative of United\r\nNations organs, has served for almost six decades now\r\nas a forum in which all States, no matter their size or\r\nstatus, may address with equal voice issues of interest\r\nand concern to them as well as to the international\r\ncommunity. It has indeed become the parliament of\r\nhumankind.\r\nTo the President of the General Assembly, a\r\ndistinguished son of Africa, now falls the task of\r\nguiding the deliberations of this fifty-ninth session. I\r\nwould like to offer him my delegation’s warm\r\ncongratulations and good wishes as he assumes his\r\nhigh responsibilities.\r\nI would like to extend to the outgoing President,\r\nThe Honourable Julian Hunte, our appreciation and\r\nthanks for his magisterial direction of the Assembly’s\r\nactivities over the past year. His performance is a\r\nsource of pride and satisfaction, not only to his native\r\nSaint Lucia, but also to the wider Caribbean\r\ncommunity, to which both our countries belong. Allow\r\nme also to convey to the Secretary-General, Kofi\r\nAnnan, our gratitude for his sure and steady leadership\r\nof the Organization during these tumultuous times.\r\nThe speakers who have preceded me in the debate\r\nhave all expressed their preoccupation at the rising\r\nlevel of threat to global peace and security, as well as\r\nto our common economic and social security. Intense\r\nconflict in places such as Afghanistan, Iraq and\r\nelsewhere in the Middle East, Africa and Europe has\r\ndestroyed thousands of innocent lives and wreaked\r\nhavoc on the States involved. At the same time, despite\r\nthe many promises of globalization, development\r\ncontinues to elude the majority of countries, especially\r\nthe poorest and most vulnerable. The HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic has not abated, continuously robbing us of\r\nprecious human and financial resources. Altogether,\r\nthe international scenario facing us is distressing,\r\noffering scant hope for early improvement. Like others,\r\ntherefore, my delegation cannot help but state its\r\nconcern at the ever-worsening international climate.\r\nWhile most of our problems are man-made, many\r\nof our States, such as those in the Caribbean, must also\r\nface the constant threat of natural disasters. The recent\r\nwave of hurricanes that destroyed our sister State of\r\nGrenada and severely battered other island countries,\r\nsuch as Haiti, the Bahamas, Cuba, the Cayman Islands,\r\nthe Dominican Republic and Jamaica, has shown how\r\ndestructive the forces of nature can be to our\r\ndevelopment. The Government of Guyana extends its\r\nsolidarity and support to all those afflicted, as well as\r\nto the United States of America, whose state of Florida\r\nhas also been seriously struck. Such is the frequency of\r\nthese phenomena that the international community\r\nmust now seek to devise stronger and more responsive\r\nmachinery to address their consequences. In this\r\nregard, Guyana attaches high importance to the\r\noutcome, next January, of the International Meeting to\r\nReview the Implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small\r\nIsland Developing States, which will be held in\r\nMauritius, and the World Conference on Disaster\r\nReduction, in Kobe, Japan.\r\nThe scourge of terrorism has now reached such a\r\nscale that it has been aptly described as a third world\r\nwar. Scarce resources must now be diverted from\r\ndevelopment to the war on terror. Yet the rampage of\r\ndestruction continues unrestrained. The process under\r\nway to stem the illicit global trade in small arms and\r\nlight weapons and to forge more effective international\r\ninstruments against terrorism and transnational crime\r\ncommands Guyana’s full support. We anxiously await\r\nthe report of the United Nations High-level Panel on\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change, in the hope that it will\r\noffer practical recommendations for preserving global\r\npeace and stability. The time may have come, we\r\nbelieve, to fully implement the collective security\r\nsystem that is envisaged in the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe age of globalization and liberalization in\r\nwhich we now live has undoubtedly brought with it\r\nlaissez-faire attitudes and policies that have seriously\r\naffected societies everywhere. Lawlessness and\r\nviolence are the new order of the day, threatening to\r\ndestroy established systems of governance, especially\r\nin weak States, as demonstrated by the recent\r\ninterruption of the democratic process in Haiti, the\r\nnewest member of our Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM), which has exacerbated social conditions\r\nin that country. The Inter-American Democratic\r\nCharter and, indeed, our own Charter of Civil Society\r\nfor the Caribbean Community expressly condemn such\r\nbreaches of democracy. Notwithstanding our concern at\r\nthese developments, Guyana stands ready to help the\r\nfraternal people of Haiti overcome their social distress.\r\nCARICOM, of which both Guyana and Haiti are\r\nmembers, is currently coordinating our humanitarian\r\nassistance to the island.\r\nRespect for the fundamental tenets of the United\r\nNations is essential if we are to avoid conflicts. The\r\nCharter is clear in its proscription of the use of force\r\nexcept under the particular circumstances of Chapter\r\nVII. In this context, let me say that Guyana supports\r\nthe reform of the Security Council through an\r\nexpansion in the membership of both the permanent\r\nand non-permanent categories and a general\r\nimprovement of its modus operandi. After careful\r\ndeliberation and in an attempt to break the current\r\nlogjam in the discussions, my Government has decided\r\nat this stage to support the aspirations of Brazil, India\r\nand an African State to permanent membership. We\r\nbelieve that their participation as developing States in\r\nthe work of the Council will make that body more\r\nbalanced, representative and, ultimately, more\r\naccountable to the Assembly for the maintenance of\r\nglobal peace and security.\r\nFor Guyana, as for the rest of the international\r\ncommunity, the situation in Iraq continues to be a\r\nsource of preoccupation. We would wish to see peace\r\nand stability quickly restored to that country and its\r\npeople. Similarly, we urge an end to the suicidal\r\nconflict between Israel and Palestine and a return to\r\nnegotiations leading to the creation of an independent\r\nPalestine and peaceful co-existence between the two\r\nStates.\r\nAs conflicts and humanitarian crises such as the\r\none in Darfur continue to multiply, the United Nations\r\nis being called to do more with less. We therefore call\r\nfor the strengthening of regional arrangements, such as\r\nthose of the Organization of American States and the\r\nAfrican Union, acting in concert with the United\r\nNations, to assist in the search for durable solutions to\r\nconflicts and disputes.\r\nIt is also imperative that we strive with greater\r\ndetermination to secure our economic development and\r\nsocial progress. For more than six decades now, the\r\ninternational community has diligently sought answers\r\nto the development dilemma, moving from one facet to\r\nanother, from disarmament to basic needs, from\r\neconomic growth to full employment, from partnership\r\nto national ownership and from good governance to the\r\nfree market. Thus far, however, the various models of\r\ndevelopment followed have failed to achieve their\r\ngoals. In the continuing exploration, this year’s Human\r\nDevelopment Report has added culture to the list of\r\ncrucial elements. As a small, multi-ethnic State,\r\nGuyana fully accepts this proposition and is committed\r\nto preserving the culture that has brought our nation\r\ntogether in service to our national development.\r\nAt the same time, we believe that cultural\r\ndiversity is a contemporary reality and must be\r\nrecognized by all States. Too often, strategies for peace\r\nand development ignore this reality with disastrous\r\nresults. Not enough consultation and coordination are\r\nundertaken to ensure that programmes and projects are\r\nin keeping with nationally defined priorities and local\r\ncircumstances. It is necessary, if failure is to be\r\navoided, for there to be greater dialogue and\r\ncooperation in the planning process for development.\r\nNational leadership remains a sine qua non for\r\nsuccessful development and must be strongly\r\nsupported by our development partners. In this spirit,\r\nGuyana renews its support for the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) and other such\r\ninitiatives based on strong national leadership and full\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nPresident Lula of Brazil and the World\r\nCommission on the Social Dimension of Globalization\r\nare to be commended for calling this Assembly’s\r\nattention to two major challenges facing the\r\ninternational community today, namely, poverty and\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nthe inequities of globalization. Although we daily see\r\non our television screens the emaciated faces of the\r\nhungry, we are yet to be stirred with the compassion\r\nand generosity of heart needed to relieve their misery.\r\nAs globalization gains further ground, many more will\r\nfall victim to further marginalization, especially in\r\nsmall developing countries that are unable to take\r\nadvantage of globalization. My own country has\r\nrecently seen a devastating blow to its sugar industry,\r\non which thousands of our people depend, as a result of\r\ntrade liberalization and the reform of the European\r\nUnion’s sugar regime. Unless small States like ours are\r\nprovided with special and differential treatment, they\r\nwill be excluded from the global economy.\r\nNext year, the world’s leaders will meet to review\r\nthe progress made in achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). All the indications are\r\nthat there is hardly enough time to achieve our\r\nobjectives. We can therefore ill afford to stand still. We\r\nmust determine now what ought to be done to build\r\nand sustain momentum to meet the 2015 targets.\r\nGuyana’s experience has been that these are not likely\r\nto be achieved without sustained economic growth.\r\nAlthough we have sound poverty reduction and\r\nnational development strategies in place, we know that\r\nsuccess depends in fair measure on a fair and\r\nsupportive international environment. We therefore\r\nurge that high priority be accorded to greater debt\r\nrelief, the mobilization of development finance and the\r\ncreation of equitable trading conditions to enable\r\ndeveloping countries such as ours to achieve economic\r\nand social progress.\r\nIt must be realized, however, that the MDGs,\r\nalthough important and laudable, will not in\r\nthemselves bring about comprehensive and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. They are but a subset of the development\r\nagenda, which must include, if it is to be successful,\r\npolitical, economic, social and environmental\r\nconsiderations. Without a holistic and well-coordinated\r\napproach, lasting solutions to our problems will not be\r\nfound. It is for that reason that my Government\r\ncontinues to advocate the establishment of a new\r\nglobal human order based on genuine interdependence\r\nand partnership between developed and developing\r\ncountries. We are at a point in time when terror, war,\r\npoverty and social chaos threaten to engulf all\r\nhumanity. We therefore hope that when the relevant\r\nitem comes before the Assembly next month, it will\r\nreceive the further support of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWithin recent years the United Nations has faced\r\nmounting criticism for its lack of responsiveness to\r\nglobal challenges and for its failure to be democratic in\r\nsome of its decision-making. While there is often a\r\nrush to act on particular issues that are deemed\r\nimportant by some countries, much less attention is\r\npaid to the concerns of the vast majority. As a\r\nconsequence, the credibility and even the legitimacy of\r\nthe United Nations have been called into question. If\r\nthat trend continues, the hard-earned prestige of the\r\nOrganization will be debased and its effectiveness\r\ncurtailed. There can be no worse danger to humanity\r\nthan the rejection of multilateralism. We believe\r\nexperience has now clearly shown that unilateralism\r\ncannot resolve the problems of our contemporary\r\nworld. Only through joint endeavours can we hope to\r\nachieve the freedom from fear and the freedom from\r\nwant to which all our peoples aspire.\r\nAs has been so aptly said, the United Nations\r\nmay not take us to heaven but it can certainly save us\r\nfrom hell. Let us therefore renew our commitment to\r\nthe high purposes and principles for which it stands.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Rogatien Biaou, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and African Integration of the\r\nRepublic of Benin.\r\nMr. Biaou (Benin) (spoke in French): Allow me\r\nfirst of all to address my warmest congratulations to\r\nMr. Jean Ping on his election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. Allow me\r\nalso to pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Ping’s\r\neminent predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, whose great\r\nvitality enabled him to relaunch the discussion on the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and to give a\r\nnew impetus towards coordination among the\r\nOrganization’s main bodies. Finally, I would like to\r\nexpress to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, the\r\ngreat appreciation of the people and Government of\r\nBenin for his work as head of our Organization; we\r\ncommend him for his courage, his skill and his vision\r\nof world affairs.\r\nPeople from every corner of the planet are\r\nplacing great hope in our work over the course of this\r\nsession to give hope and life to their legitimate\r\naspirations. That can only be achieved if we all work\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\ntogether, with conviction and determination, to\r\nconsolidate our commitment to multilateralism.\r\nYes, in order to survive, our world, more than\r\never before, needs multilateral cooperation based on\r\nthe principles enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations. Yes, more than ever before the principles of\r\nthe Charter must be implemented with an acute sense\r\nof responsibility and a clear understanding of their\r\npurpose, which is to promote international peace and\r\nsecurity and economic and social development as\r\nessential prerequisites for the promotion and protection\r\nof human dignity.\r\nYes, it is now on the basis of human dignity that\r\nwe are to measure the validity and accuracy of any\r\nnational or international policy. We therefore urge\r\nevery Member of the United Nations to examine their\r\nconsciences and to make changes accordingly, so that\r\nwe can give that approach its fullest meaning. It is on\r\nthis issue that the challenges are the greatest, as can be\r\nseen by the blind abuse and violence that is carried out\r\non a massive scale by terrorists and armed groups\r\nagainst innocent civilians.\r\nWith respect to armed conflicts and their\r\nconsequences, we must redouble our past efforts to\r\nenhance our ability to act preventively, doing all we\r\ncan to quickly and effectively defuse potential sources\r\nof conflicts and neutralize the seeds of conflict\r\nsituations before they germinate. As we have no other\r\nchoice but to cure — since we have been unable to\r\nprevent — we have to considerably increase United\r\nNations capabilities in the areas of peacekeeping and\r\nmanagement of post-conflict situations.\r\nWe would like to reiterate our deep gratitude to\r\nthe Secretary-General for his personal commitment in\r\nseeking a rapid solution to the Ivorian crisis within the\r\nframework of the Accra III accords. The international\r\ncommunity — despite the erratic evolution of the\r\nsituation — must stay the course with Côte d’Ivoire in\r\nits efforts to respect its commitments and to ensure a\r\nsmooth transition towards the restoration of peace, by\r\nstabilizing the situation so that that country can find its\r\nplace within the development dynamic in the West\r\nAfrican subregion.\r\nWe also encourage the international community\r\nto focus particular attention on the Great Lakes region,\r\nwhich remains a source of concern. The situation there\r\nalso requires a regional approach — one that can be\r\nbest effected by holding the proposed international\r\nconference on the Great Lakes region.\r\nWe reiterate our firm support for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendations to substantially reinforce\r\nthe troops of the United Nations Organization Mission\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo in order to\r\nhelp consolidate the peace process in that country.\r\nThe situation in Darfur has highlighted the urgent\r\nneed to realize programmes to establish an independent\r\noperations management unit for peacekeeping within\r\nthe African Union in order to facilitate the rapid\r\ndeployment of African forces to stem conflicts as soon\r\nas they break out.\r\nConflict prevention can only be effective if we\r\ntake into consideration the disturbing question of the\r\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons, which is\r\na dangerous destabilizing factor. The illicit circulation\r\nof small arms and light weapons considerably reduces\r\nthe ability of national communities to peacefully\r\nresolve their disputes.\r\nThe same applies to disarmament, which Benin\r\nconsiders crucial to the establishment of peace and the\r\npromotion of development. We call for the total and\r\nverifiable elimination from our planet of the threat of\r\nnuclear arms, as well as other types of weapons of\r\nmass destruction.\r\nSince 11 September 2001 international terrorism\r\nhas become one of the great challenges of our time.\r\nThe international community must condemn terrorism\r\nand combat it in all its forms with determination —\r\nattacking the problem with a renewed political will to\r\nseek a lasting solution to the serious international\r\nproblems that terrorism feeds on. We must, however,\r\nremember that in prosecuting that struggle it is\r\nimperative that we preserve the democratic freedoms\r\nthat have been so dearly won by our citizens, and the\r\nopen society, which is the essence of democracy.\r\nIndeed, terrorism is not the monopoly of a single\r\nreligion or nationality, much less that of a given\r\ncivilization. It is not the concern of one particular\r\ncategory of countries. It is a global threat and, as a\r\nresult, requires a global response. My country is\r\nsparing no effort to join the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity in that area. It is in that spirit that we\r\nsigned and carried out the ratification of 12\r\ninternational conventions regarding the fight against\r\nterrorism and organized crime.\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nWe have all acknowledged the need for reform,\r\nand for more than a decade have been involved in a\r\nmultidimensional discussion in order to bring the\r\ninstitutional architecture of the United Nations system\r\nand its operating methods up to date in accordance\r\nwith the changing realities the elements of the system\r\nwere devised to confront.\r\nThe ultimate goal of reform is to better serve the\r\nideals of the Organization and better meet the\r\nlegitimate expectations of the people of the world in\r\nthe face of the dangers confronting them today.\r\nWith respect to Security Council reform, most\r\nMember States have expressed the hope that the\r\nSecurity Council will become more representative of\r\nthe international community as a whole, in the light of\r\nthe considerable increase in the number of Member\r\nStates — which have grown from 51 to 192 since the\r\ncreation of the United Nations — and in the light of the\r\nfact that the new States have a certain weight\r\ndemographically, economically and militarily.\r\nI take this opportunity to extend my thanks to all\r\nMember States of the United Nations that, on 23\r\nOctober 2003, voted for my country, Benin, to become\r\na non-permanent member of the Security Council for\r\nthe period 2004-2005.\r\nIn the context of current discussions on Security\r\nCouncil reform, Benin believes that any reform of the\r\nCouncil must take into consideration the legitimate\r\naspirations of the developing countries, in particular\r\nAfrican countries, while maintaining the Council’s\r\neffectiveness and good functioning.\r\nBenin has no objection to the friendly countries\r\nof Japan, Germany and Brazil becoming permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council. However, the extent,\r\nthe nature and the modalities of the increase in Council\r\nmembership should be based on the principles of\r\nequitable geographic distribution and the sovereign\r\nequality of States. Clearly, there cannot be a partial or\r\nselective increase in the number of permanent and non-\r\npermanent members of the Council that works to the\r\ndetriment of the developing countries. In that context,\r\nAfrica, like all regional groups, must have two\r\npermanent seats on the Security Council. Any other\r\nsolution would cause a de facto disequilibrium and an\r\noverrepresentation of one regional group to the\r\ndetriment of others. In other words, Africa justly\r\ndemands two permanent seats and two non-permanent\r\nseats, in addition to the three it currently holds.\r\nThe right of veto should be extended to the new\r\npermanent members of the Security Council. In\r\naddition, the non-permanent members of the Council,\r\nin rotation, could be accorded the veto power during\r\nthe month they hold the presidency, given the\r\nimportance of that position.\r\nThe link between development and peace can be\r\nseen more clearly now than in the past. We are used to\r\nhearing those two concepts linked in the time-honoured\r\nsaying that “development is the other name for peace”.\r\nAs national revenue grows, Governments have greater\r\nmanoeuvring room to adopt social and economic\r\npolicies that promote national integration and regional\r\nequilibrium.\r\nToday, two years after the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, held at Johannesburg, we all\r\nagree on the importance of the progressive and\r\nharmonious attainment of the goals of sustainable\r\ndevelopment, in accordance with the outcome of our\r\nwork at Johannesburg. If the environment is important,\r\nin no way can it be treated separately from other\r\naspects of sustainable development. Rather, it is by\r\nreinforcing national development capacity, while\r\nsupporting the activities of communities through high-\r\nimpact programmes such as microfinancing, as\r\nproposed by the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme and the Global Environment Facility, that\r\nwe can wage a radical campaign against extreme\r\npoverty and reduce the number of people living in\r\npoverty by 2015, as established in the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nThose programmes provide opportunities to help\r\nus better protect natural resources. However, we will\r\nnot allow the protection of the environment to become\r\na limit to our country’s economic growth. Sustainable\r\ndevelopment, properly understood, consists of\r\nintegrating all dimensions into a coherent national\r\npolicy.\r\nIn developing countries, in particular the least\r\ndeveloped countries and especially Benin, where many\r\nefforts have been made to reinforce democracy,\r\nstrengthen the decentralization process and fight\r\npoverty, communities and non-governmental\r\norganizations must be strengthened to decentralize\r\nmanagement of the environment and thus promote\r\ndevelopment at the local level.\r\nAlso to fight poverty and better manage natural\r\nresources, we must remember that the Johannesburg\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nSummit identified the United Nations Convention to\r\nCombat Desertification as one way to fight poverty and\r\nas a tool available to the international community to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. When, at\r\nits sixtieth session, the General Assembly examines the\r\nprogress made towards achieving those Goals, my\r\ndelegation hopes that the Convention to Combat\r\nDesertification will take its rightful place in the\r\ndiscussions on the Millennium Project, led by\r\nProfessor Jeffrey Sachs.\r\nWith respect to financial resources, we call on the\r\ninternational community to make the fourth\r\nreplenishment of the Global Environment Fund even\r\ngreater than the third and call for the issue of soil\r\ndegradation and desertification to receive all the\r\nattention it deserves.\r\nBy adopting the 2001 Programme of Action for\r\nthe Least Developed Countries for the decade 2001-\r\n2010 at the conclusion of the Third United Nations\r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries, held in\r\nBrussels, the international community established the\r\nkey goal of doing everything possible to halve by 2015\r\nthe number of people living in extreme poverty and\r\nsuffering hunger and to promote sustainable\r\ndevelopment in the developing countries.\r\nIn spite of the efforts made, the least developed\r\ncountries continue to suffer from the burden of debt,\r\nleading to weakened measures for social protection, the\r\nimpoverishment of vulnerable segments of society,\r\nrural migration and the depreciation of agricultural\r\nproducts, among other things.\r\nIn his mandate as Global Chair of the Bureau of\r\nthe Least Developed Countries, President Mathieu\r\nKérékou of the Republic of Benin took part from 28 to\r\n30 June 2004 in the 2004 high-level segment of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council’s substantive session,\r\ndevoted to mobilizing resources and promoting an\r\nenvironment favourable to eliminating poverty, in the\r\ncontext of the implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction for the Least Developed Countries for the\r\ndecade 2001-2010. The high-level segment identified\r\nreal ways to mobilize external and internal resources to\r\neliminate poverty through microfinancing, the\r\npromotion of small and medium-sized business and\r\nland tenure security.\r\nThe least developed countries, in particular those\r\nof Africa, must strive to strengthen partnerships with\r\nthe international community, given that the prospects\r\nof their national economies raise the most doubts.\r\nThis year, Benin has again made its modest\r\ncontribution to international efforts by convening an\r\nAfrican Union regional conference on the family, in the\r\nframework of the tenth anniversary of the United\r\nNations International Year of the Family.\r\nAt that conference, Africa established an action\r\nplan on the African family, as well as strategies for its\r\nimplementation. The action plan is based on the\r\nobservation that Africa is undergoing three great\r\ntransformations and is faced with enormous challenges\r\nthat place increased pressure on families. In order to\r\nmeet those challenges, we must adopt an integrated\r\napproach that places families at the centre of a\r\ncomprehensive development programme to preserve\r\nthe integrity of families.\r\nAfrican countries share the conviction that\r\nimplementation of the nine priority areas of that action\r\nplan will make it possible to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals in the shortest possible time. The\r\naction plan has been issued as a United Nations\r\ndocument. We urge our development partners to give it\r\nall the necessary attention in order to pool resources to\r\nimplement the plan, which can be considered a\r\nsupplementary effort to better focus on human beings\r\nwithin their basic social milieu and according to their\r\nprincipal needs, with a view to attaining the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nEncouraging efforts have been made in the areas\r\nof official development assistance, managing the\r\nforeign debt of heavily indebted countries and\r\nmultinational trade negotiations — in particular those\r\nundertaken in the context of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development. They must be coherently\r\npursued in order to achieve an overall improvement in\r\nthe foreign environment for developing countries, in\r\ngeneral, and for African countries, in particular.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\r\nmy appreciation for the extension of the expiration date\r\nof the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative,\r\nas well as for the adoption of the general Framework\r\nfor Establishing Modalities in Agriculture for\r\nmultilateral trade negotiations under the Doha Work\r\nProgramme, which is known as the July package. The\r\ngeneral framework of negotiations on that document\r\nwas based on the agreement of developed countries to\r\nbring domestic subsidies for their farmers to a level\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nthat permits farmers in the least developed countries to\r\nlive off the fruits of their labours.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to emphasize that, as\r\nfar as the sectoral Cotton Initiative is concerned —\r\nwhich should be the subject of separate and special\r\ntreatment within a subcommittee — the development\r\nstrategy for the cotton sector could encompass\r\nidentifying market opportunities, the possibility of\r\ndeveloping high-added-value activities and the\r\nestablishment of bodies or mechanisms that make it\r\npossible to regulate and strengthen the market.\r\nI would like to conclude my statement by\r\nreminding the Assembly that Benin will assume the\r\npresidency of the Security Council in February 2005.\r\nAs part of its presidency, we plan to organize a\r\nministerial conference in New York on the theme\r\n“Thinking about the future situation of child soldiers in\r\nAfrica”. One of the objectives envisaged for that\r\ndebate will be to help find lasting solutions to the\r\nproblem of child soldiers in Africa and to begin the\r\nprocess of developing an international legal instrument\r\nto prevent the recruitment of children into armies.\r\nThrough that theme, we will hope to engage the\r\ninternational community in a genuine alliance to\r\npromote peace, security, political stability and\r\ndevelopment in Africa. We count on the support and\r\nparticipation of members of the Assembly in that\r\nconference, which will make it possible for us to\r\ndefuse the time bomb represented by the issue of child\r\nsoldiers. I therefore invite all members to make a\r\ncontribution in order to bequeath a brighter tomorrow\r\nto future generations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency U Tin Winn, Minister, Office of\r\nthe Prime Minister of the Union of Myanmar.\r\nU Tin Winn (Myanmar): Allow me, first of all,\r\nto congratulate the President on his assumption of the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession. I am fully confident that his wisdom and\r\ndiplomatic skills will guide our deliberations to a\r\nfruitful outcome. I would also like to take this\r\nopportunity to convey my appreciation to Mr. Julian\r\nHunte for his able leadership and contributions to the\r\nsuccess of the previous session. My delegation would\r\nalso like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his\r\nselfless dedication to the cause of the United Nations.\r\nThe world today faces many daunting challenges.\r\nMost ominous and threatening among them are issues\r\nrelated to peace and security. Under those\r\ncircumstances, it is worth recalling the Five Principles\r\nof Peaceful Coexistence, which were enunciated 50\r\nyears ago by Myanmar, along with China and India, to\r\nprovide the basic principles for inter-State relations.\r\nThe Principles were subsequently adopted by Asian\r\nand African leaders in the Bandung Declaration of\r\n1955. The 1961 Belgrade Conference of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement also adopted the Principles as basic\r\ntenets of the Movement. The United Nations itself\r\nendorsed the Principles. Founded on the premise of the\r\nessential unity of humankind, the Five Principles\r\nremain as relevant and valid today as on the day they\r\nwere proclaimed.\r\nMyanmar considers the United Nations, which\r\nrepresents international legitimacy and near-universal\r\nmembership, as the sole multilateral forum for\r\naddressing urgent global issues. Recent events remind\r\nus of the futility of unilateralism and the danger of\r\nresorting to the use of force without the authorization\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThreats to the international system and the\r\nrapidly evolving international situation demand a\r\nthorough reform of the Organization and its\r\nmechanisms, structure and working methods. In that\r\ncontext, we would like to reiterate our views on the\r\nreform of the Organization, including that of the\r\nSecurity Council. The expansion and reform of the\r\nSecurity Council must be an integral part of a common\r\npackage. If it is to become more representative and\r\nreflect contemporary political and economic realities,\r\nthe Council should be expanded in both categories of\r\nmembership. An ideal solution in the democratization\r\nprocess would be the abolition of the veto. Until that is\r\ndone, its application should be limited. It is also our\r\nview that new permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil should enjoy the same rights and privileges as\r\ncurrent members.\r\nMyanmar notes with interest the ongoing work of\r\nthe Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change.\r\nIn this highly globalized world, regional\r\ncooperation, including South-South cooperation, can\r\nwell complement international cooperation. As a\r\nmember of the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations, Myanmar is actively involved in the\r\nAssociation’s activities aimed at promoting regional\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\npeace, stability and prosperity and at enhancing\r\ncooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.\r\nTerrorism is one of the most serious challenges\r\nthat the world faces today. It threatens national\r\nsovereignty and violates human rights, including the\r\nright to life. Last year, terrorists carried their war to the\r\ndoorstep of the United Nations. They cruelly\r\nextinguished the lives of 22 innocent persons,\r\nincluding that of Special Representative Sergio Vieira\r\nde Mello, at United Nations headquarters in Baghdad.\r\nMore recently, we have seen wanton acts of terrorism\r\nin diverse parts of the world, from Beslan to Jakarta to\r\nMadrid. Myanmar unequivocally condemns terrorism\r\nin all its forms and manifestations and joins the\r\ninternational community in calling for concerted action\r\nto combat the menace in accordance with the United\r\nNations Charter and international law.\r\nWe have never permitted the use of our territory\r\nfor hostile acts against any State. We have neither\r\nprovided assistance to those involved in terrorist acts\r\nnor safe haven to them, and we never will.\r\nMyanmar is doing its utmost to combat this\r\nmenace at the national, regional and international\r\nlevels. Myanmar has signed, or acceded to, 11 of the 12\r\ninternational legal instruments related to the\r\nsuppression of terrorism. It is also actively involved in\r\nthe Bali Process to combat transnational crime,\r\nincluding international terrorism.\r\nThe illicit trafficking in drugs is another\r\nchallenge that is closely linked to other transnational\r\ncrimes. Success in the war against drugs will contribute\r\nto a successful outcome in the fight against\r\ntransnational crime. Myanmar accords topmost priority\r\nto the suppression and eradication of narcotic drugs. A\r\n15-year national plan is targeted at the eradication of\r\nnarcotic drugs in the country by the year 2014. In the\r\nlast decade, Myanmar seized and destroyed drugs\r\nvalued at more than $14.5 billion.\r\nFigures from the United States Drug Enforcement\r\nAdministration show that over a span of eight years,\r\nfrom 1996 to 2003, poppy cultivation declined steadily,\r\nby 71 per cent, while opium production decreased by\r\n81 per cent. The United Nations Office on Drugs and\r\nCrime has acknowledged Myanmar’s commitment to\r\nthe anti-drug campaign.\r\nIn recent years the problem of synthetic drugs has\r\nalso surfaced. The illicit drugs chain begins with\r\ninadequate control of the trade in precursor chemicals.\r\nIt bears repetition that my country does not produce\r\nprecursor chemicals used in the production of narcotic\r\ndrugs. We would like to urge countries that produce\r\nprecursor chemicals to institute effective regulatory\r\ncontrols. Without precursor chemicals there can be no\r\namphetamine-type synthetic drugs.\r\nMyanmar is determined in its fight against drugs.\r\nIt has established bilateral, trilateral, regional and\r\nmultilateral cooperation to rid the world of this\r\nscourge.\r\nSome Western countries allege that Myanmar is\r\nnot adequately addressing the issue of trafficking in\r\npersons. Nothing could be further from the truth. In\r\nfact, Myanmar views trafficking in persons as an evil\r\nthat must be suppressed through concerted action. In\r\nthat connection, Myanmar acceded to the United\r\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized\r\nCrime on 30 March of this year. A national law against\r\nhuman trafficking is being drafted in accordance with\r\nthat Convention. Next month, Myanmar will host the\r\nmeeting of the six-nation Coordinated Mekong\r\nMinisterial Initiative against Trafficking.\r\nAllegations of human rights violations in\r\nMyanmar are aimed at discrediting the Government for\r\npolitical purposes. Myanmar believes that the question\r\nof human rights is an important issue. It should be\r\naddressed with objectivity and impartiality, and\r\nwithout selectivity. Myanmar has consistently\r\ncooperated with the United Nations on human rights\r\nissues. In that context, a national Human Rights\r\nCommittee has already been established and human\r\nrights awareness is being introduced in school curricula\r\nnationwide, as well as through workshops.\r\nAn interview conducted by a politically\r\nmotivated non-governmental organization with 25 or\r\nso insurgents inside a neighbouring country became the\r\nbasis of a report that there are 70,000 child soldiers in\r\nthe Myanmar national armed forces. That is a far-\r\nfetched conclusion. The falsehood found its way into\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on children and\r\narmed conflict in 2002 (S/2002/1299). The report\r\nsubsequently became the resource document in the\r\nSecurity Council’s ensuing thematic debate on children\r\nand armed conflict.\r\nI wish, first of all, to firmly reiterate that\r\nMyanmar is not a nation in armed conflict. It is a\r\nnation at peace. Secondly, I wish to clearly state that\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nchildren not permitted to be recruited into the armed\r\nservices in Myanmar, either by law or in practice. A\r\npreventive programme was in place in my country even\r\nbefore Security Council resolutions were adopted on\r\nthis theme. In that regard, the Chairman of our\r\nCommittee on the Prevention of the Recruitment of\r\nChild Soldiers recently received the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) representative in Myanmar\r\nto explore ways and means to enhance cooperation.\r\nThe representative was afforded the opportunity to visit\r\nthe army recruitment centre near Yangon, and\r\nsubsequently the army recruitment centre in Mandalay\r\ntogether with the United Nations Resident Coordinator.\r\nMyanmar is finalizing an action plan and is\r\ncooperating with UNICEF in that regard. It will also\r\ncontinue its cooperation with the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Children\r\nand Armed Conflict.\r\nAllow me to turn to developments in my country.\r\nPeace and stability have been restored. We are taking\r\nsteps to ensure a smooth transition to a peaceful,\r\ndemocratic modern State. Myanmar places the highest\r\npriority on national reconciliation to achieve unity\r\namong its 135 national races. In order to strengthen ties\r\nand promote the economic and social development of\r\nthe national races inhabiting the border areas, the\r\nGovernment has expended 58 billion kyats and more\r\nthan $550 million in infrastructure development that\r\nincludes communication networks and education and\r\nhealth facilities, thus promoting the quality of life of\r\nthose citizens.\r\nNotwithstanding the unilateral sanctions of some\r\nWestern countries, Myanmar has been able to develop\r\nits economy and promote the well-being of its people.\r\nWe have achieved this by relying mainly on our own\r\nresources, and with the assistance and cooperation of\r\nour neighbours.\r\nNoteworthy advances have been made in the\r\nhealth and education sectors. The country now has 757\r\nhospitals, with 140 hospitals having been added in the\r\nlast 15 years. In the past year alone, 22 new hospitals\r\nwere commissioned. Over the same period, the number\r\nof colleges and universities in the country has\r\nincreased from 32 to 154. Enrolment has risen\r\ndramatically in those institutions, from 120,000 to\r\n890,000 students.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nAllow me now to turn to recent political\r\ndevelopments in my country. In August 2003, the\r\nPrime Minister, General Khin Nyunt, announced a\r\nseven-step road map for transition to democracy. The\r\nroad map has been well received in the country, as well\r\nas by our neighbours. The Association of Southeast\r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) Summit last November\r\nwelcomed the commitment of the Myanmar\r\nGovernment to effect a transition to democracy.\r\nThe first and most crucial step of the road map,\r\nthe reconvening of the National Convention, was taken\r\non 17 May of this year. The current Convention is\r\nbeing attended by 1,088 delegates from eight strata,\r\nrepresenting all walks of life. It is more inclusive than\r\nthe previous Convention, which was attended by only\r\nabout 700 delegates.\r\nMoreover, 60 per cent of the delegates to the\r\ncurrent Convention are from the national races. Over\r\n100 delegates represent 17 major armed groups and 17\r\nsmaller armed groups, which have returned to the legal\r\nfold. In the previous Convention, representatives of\r\nthree or four armed groups which had just returned to\r\nthe legal fold were present as observers.\r\nDuring the first session, the sensitive issue of\r\npower-sharing between the central Government and the\r\nstates and regions was the main focus of discussion.\r\nIndeed, power-sharing is a vital and delicate issue, as\r\nthe country is now evolving from a unitary\r\nGovernment structure to a union structure, where states\r\nand regions will have their own executive and\r\nlegislative bodies. Delegates held extensive discussions\r\non that issue. Because of the complex and sensitive\r\nnature of the deliberations, discussions were time-\r\nconsuming and sometimes intense. After a successful\r\nfirst session, the Convention adjourned on 9 July.\r\nMyanmar is a union of 135 national races, and\r\nunity is key to achieving our vision of a prosperous\r\ndemocratic State. We are greatly encouraged by the\r\nresults of the first session. The common desire to\r\nensure the success of the seven-step road map was\r\nevident. Preparations are under way for the second\r\nsession, which is to be convened in the forthcoming\r\nopen season. Once agreement is reached on the\r\nfundamental principles in the National Convention, a\r\nnew constitution will be drafted. The draft text will be\r\nput to a referendum for the people of Myanmar to\r\ndecide upon. After the adoption of the new\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nconstitution, there will be free and fair elections, in\r\nwhich the people will elect leaders of their choice.\r\nThe new political structure needs to be strong and\r\nresilient, and the country united. The future of the\r\nnation cannot be determined by one individual or one\r\nparty acting alone. There is no alternative to the\r\nNational Convention. It is the sole process through\r\nwhich the aspirations of the people of Myanmar to\r\nestablish a modern and democratic nation can be\r\nfulfilled. We cannot allow the National Convention to\r\nbe derailed under any circumstances. Failure would\r\nplunge the nation into the abyss of anarchy. That is the\r\nreason why we set such store on the successful\r\noutcome of the National Convention. We are\r\ndetermined that this vital national endeavour will be\r\ncrowned with success.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sergei N. Martynov, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Belarus.\r\nMr. Martynov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): For\r\ndecades now we have been hearing very disturbing\r\nquestions from this rostrum: Where is our world\r\nheading?, Where is the United Nations going? At the\r\ndawn of the millennium those questions are becoming\r\nincreasingly burning issues. The world has changed.\r\nThe pendulum of history has swung to the other side.\r\nThere is new violence, a wave of terrorism, local wars\r\nand ethnic conflicts, behind which lie growing poverty\r\nand a widening gap in development between countries.\r\nThose are not just someone else’s problems; they are\r\ncommon global challenges for all of us. What kind of\r\ncommon house do we want? I believe that we primarily\r\nwant a safe house, where our children will not die at\r\nthe hands of terrorists or from hunger, sickness, anti-\r\npersonnel mines, smart bombs or missiles.\r\nWhat, then, must we do? The answer is clear: we\r\nmust establish a valid system of international security\r\nthat includes military, economic, environmental, social\r\nand information elements — a system based on the rule\r\nof law in domestic and international affairs. The\r\nanswer is clear, but it is difficult to do it. During the\r\nAssembly’s last session, Belarus made the rule of law\r\nin international relations the main focus of its\r\nstatement. The fact that that theme has been a leitmotif\r\nof the present general debate inspires a certain hope in\r\nus, namely, that the goal is a realistic one.\r\nNo right-thinking person can remain indifferent\r\ntoday to the heinous acts of terrorism that have\r\ncharacterized the start of the twenty-first century. The\r\nusual approaches, based on selfishness and unilateral\r\nadvantage, are not enough to crush this evil. We need\r\nnon-traditional, long-term, comprehensive solutions.\r\nWho can provide them, and how? Only the United\r\nNations, by playing its crucial role, can do so. The\r\nSecurity Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee\r\n(CTC) must become a real, practical tool for curbing\r\nthe growth in international terrorism: strengthening the\r\nanti-terrorism coalition under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations, monitoring the implementation of the\r\nprovisions of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)\r\nand putting an end to the practice of double standards\r\nvis-à-vis terrorists and terrorism.\r\nIn practical terms, establishing a direct link\r\nbetween the CTC and regional organizations and\r\nholding more open Security Council meetings at the\r\nministerial level could really help in the global struggle\r\nagainst terrorism, under the banner of the United\r\nNations. However, such a struggle can be successful\r\nonly if our common goal is to strengthen a just and\r\nhumane world system. Belarus will do its utmost in\r\nthat struggle.\r\nOn 1 March 2004, the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction entered into force in Belarus. We have the\r\nworld’s seventh largest stockpile of landmines, which\r\nwe inherited from the former Soviet Union. We do not\r\nproduce or export mines; nor do we use them at home\r\nor anywhere else in the world. However, guided by our\r\ncommon concerns and interests, we ratified the Ottawa\r\nConvention and are now counting on assistance from\r\nthe international community to destroy our stockpile of\r\nmines.\r\nTomorrow we will deposit my country’s\r\ninstruments of ratification for such important\r\ninternational disarmament agreements as the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism and the Protocol against the\r\nIllicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms,\r\nTheir Parts and Components and Ammunition,\r\nsupplementing the United Nations Convention against\r\nTransnational Organized Crime.\r\nToday’s most important challenges include illegal\r\nmigration, transborder crime, drug trafficking,\r\ntrafficking in persons and the security of energy\r\ninfrastructure. In combating those threats, Belarus,\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nwhich stands at a major European crossroads, is a\r\nsignificant factor in the stability of Europe. Our\r\ncountry is also playing a major role in the Europe-Asia\r\ntransport of energy resources. Today we call on our\r\nneighbours, NATO and the European Union to organize\r\nregional cooperation to ensure the security of critical\r\ninfrastructure, such as oil and gas pipelines and power\r\nstations, including nuclear ones. Belarus has already\r\nannounced its readiness to dedicate troops and\r\nresources to international structures in support of those\r\ngoals. The contribution of Belarus to regional and\r\ninternational security, which began in the areas of\r\nnuclear and conventional disarmament in the early\r\n1990s, continues to be a real and significant one. We\r\nare grateful to other countries and to international\r\norganizations for their assistance in the area of border\r\nand customs infrastructure.\r\nDouble standards are becoming an increasingly\r\nimportant problem, and not only vis-à-vis terrorism.\r\nThat objectionable instrument is being used primarily\r\nagainst States that are bold enough to follow their own\r\nforeign policy, rather than submitting to the dictates of\r\nthe world’s power centres. A leader is not a dictator,\r\nand certainly not a messiah. The practice of double\r\nstandards today applies primarily to the Euro-Atlantic\r\nspace. But strenuous efforts are being made to\r\nintroduce it in the United Nations. That would present\r\na danger to the stability and effectiveness of the United\r\nNations system. Belarus calls on all States that are not\r\nindifferent to the independence of the United Nations\r\nand to the role it plays not to allow that to happen.\r\nEconomic security is a very important condition\r\nfor sustainable development. That is a very remote\r\nconcept for most of the countries of the world. As the\r\nonly European State that is a member of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, Belarus would like to stress that\r\nthe concept of centre versus periphery pits developed\r\ncountries against developing countries in the industrial\r\narena. It is also a concept that is clearly in crisis, and\r\none that will slow us down in the search for a solution\r\nto problems of economic development.\r\nOnly seven of the 50 least developed countries\r\nhave achieved a 7 per cent growth rate, which is\r\nprerequisite to halving the number of people living in\r\nabsolute poverty by the year 2015. One person dies of\r\nhunger every four seconds. That is just a figure, but the\r\nvery banality of that statement does reveal the\r\nmonstrosity of the problem and how terrible is the\r\nworld’s indifference to it. The difficulty of the\r\nundertaking should not stop us from seeking ways to\r\nresolve the problem of poverty. That is why Belarus\r\nsupports President Lula da Silva’s initiative to fight\r\nhunger and poverty in the world.\r\nDespite the transitional period and the collapse of\r\nour economy, my country — a large area of the former\r\nSoviet Union — was the first to solve the problem of\r\nmalnutrition. Now, we are waging a struggle against\r\npoverty. Since 1995, we have almost halved the\r\nnumber of people living in poverty in Belarus, with the\r\nfigure this year being about 20 per cent.\r\nThe difficulties we have experienced have not\r\nstopped us from providing economic assistance to\r\ndeveloping countries. We have unilaterally extended\r\ntrade preferences to the overwhelming majority of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nWe are disturbed by a possible lessening of\r\nUnited Nations attention to issues involving countries\r\nwith economies in transition. Belarus regards the role\r\nof United Nations programmes and funds as important\r\nto the development assistance provided to countries\r\nwith economies in transition. However, under current\r\nconditions — in which some States of the region are\r\napproaching the level of the Group of Eight (G-8) and\r\nothers have macroeconomic indicators that barely\r\nexceed those of least developed countries — that\r\nassistance must be carefully targeted. That means that,\r\nin planning country programmes, account must be\r\ntaken of countries’ socio-economic development and\r\nthe degree of their integration into the world economy\r\nand financial institutions. We intend to make that\r\napproach the basis of a draft General Assembly\r\nresolution, and we hope that members will support it.\r\nThe problems associated with financing for\r\ndevelopment are extremely topical today for\r\ndeveloping countries and countries with economies in\r\ntransition. Last year’s two-day High-Level Dialogue on\r\nFinancing for Development was not enough to put in\r\nplace ongoing monitoring of the implementation of the\r\ndecisions of the International Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development. That will require an independent\r\nbody of the Economic and Social Council.\r\nBelarus believes that the 2005 New York summit\r\non the implementation of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals will provide real impetus to all initiatives aimed\r\nat stimulating economic development.\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nNarrowing the technological and information\r\ndivide between developed and developing countries\r\nmust be our common concern.\r\nAt the 2003 Geneva World Summit on the\r\nInformation Society, the President of the Republic of\r\nBelarus, Mr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka, strongly urged\r\nthe establishment of a trust fund to offset losses\r\nincurred by producers who provide software to\r\ndeveloping countries at reduced costs. The format and\r\nmechanism for such a fund should be defined by a task\r\nforce within the context of preparing for the 2005\r\nsummit.\r\nHaving experienced the Chernobyl disaster,\r\nBelarus is acutely aware of one fact: we cannot\r\ndisregard the problem of radiation security. The\r\nconsequences are too enormous in scope, and too\r\nincompatible with the long-term survival of the human\r\nrace. The United Nations must not lessen its attention\r\nto the problem of overcoming the consequences of the\r\nChernobyl accident. We support the work of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency to implement a\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime and to strengthen\r\nnuclear and radiation security.\r\nLooking to the future to seek ways to ensure\r\nnormal living conditions for people living in areas\r\naffected by the Chernobyl disaster: that will be the\r\ntheme of an international conference to be held in\r\nMinsk in 2006, on the sad anniversary of the\r\nChernobyl disaster. We invite all interested States, the\r\nleadership of the Secretariat and international\r\norganizations to participate in the preparations for the\r\nconference and in the event itself.\r\nThe United Nations has often been criticized.\r\nThere have been many pessimistic analyses of its work\r\nand its potential. A great deal of that has been fair, but\r\nlet us look the truth straight in the eyes: there is no\r\nalternative to the United Nations as a mechanism for\r\ncollectively resolving global and regional issues. Nor is\r\nthere an alternative to multilateralism. The reality of\r\nlife convinces us of that more and more each day.\r\nBelarus looks forward with great interest to the\r\noutcome of the work of the High-Level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change. As a member of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, Belarus urges the Panel to\r\ntake account of the consolidated position of the\r\ncountries members of the Non-Aligned Movement as it\r\nworks on its proposals to enhance the effectiveness of\r\nUnited Nations reform.\r\nA key purpose of that work must be to correct the\r\nimbalance in the membership of the Security Council\r\nand in the Organization as a whole, as well as to\r\npromote respect for the principle of equitable\r\ngeographical distribution of Council seats. We believe\r\nthere should be an increase in the category of non-\r\npermanent members, taking account of the interests of\r\nall the regional groups. We also believe in increasing\r\nthe number of permanent members, including\r\nrepresentatives from the three developing regions —\r\nAsia, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean —\r\nas well as from two developed States, from Europe and\r\nAsia respectively, that have made the most tangible\r\ncontributions to the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nLet me return to the disturbing questions I posed\r\nat the beginning of my statement. Where is the world\r\nheading? Where is the United Nations going? The\r\nanswer to the first question must be that it depends\r\nupon the United Nations. That is the main point. So far,\r\nhowever, that has not been reflected in the world\r\nsituation. That is a harsh truth, but the truth\r\nnonetheless. We must change that situation. We can do\r\nso. It is in our common interest and in the interest of\r\nsmall and large States alike, as well as of both rich and\r\ndeveloping countries. It is in the interest of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Vartan Oskanian, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia.\r\nMr. Oskanian (Armenia): We wish to extend our\r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly. We would also like to thank to Mr. Julian\r\nHunte and the Secretary-General for their efforts\r\nduring this difficult year.\r\nLast year, we expressed our concern about the\r\nrestoration of sovereignty in Iraq and the\r\nreinvigoration of the Middle East peace process. This\r\nyear, we wish especially to note the critical need to end\r\nthe tragedy in Darfur. Armenians, victims of the\r\ntwentieth century’s first genocide, know well the long-\r\nlasting effects of victimization and homelessness. This\r\nis no way to begin a new millennium. The benefits of\r\nglobalization should be utilized to overcome this\r\nnewest global crisis.\r\nWe also comprehend all too well that peace and\r\nsecurity abroad and at home are clearly associated with\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nsocial and economic dignity today — or with faith in\r\ntheir possible attainment tomorrow. Neither self-\r\nsatisfied smugness on the one hand nor self-righteous\r\nviolence on the other are solutions to the great\r\ninequalities that exist around the world and within each\r\nof our countries, even the most developed of them.\r\nTerrorism, in all its manifestations, affects\r\nsecurity and political and economic stability in our\r\nneighbourhoods and throughout our planet. Terrorism,\r\nfrom Madrid to Beslan, in all its manifestations, is\r\ninexcusable and unacceptable. Cognizant that the\r\nsuccess of counter-terrorism efforts is dependent upon\r\ncollective measures, Armenia has readily joined the\r\nglobal fight against international terrorism. That fight\r\nmust go beyond effective regional and international\r\ncooperation. It must include the very goals of the\r\nMillennium Declaration: replacing deprivation, poverty\r\nand injustice with universal respect for human rights\r\nand democracy, economic development, equality and\r\nsocial justice.\r\nIn Armenia we have had a year in which\r\neconomic growth went hand in hand with increased\r\nparticipation in international organizations, particularly\r\nin the United Nations. Our position in the Human\r\nDevelopment Index gives us the confidence to continue\r\non our path of economic development. We will also\r\nwork hard to bolster public-private partnerships. We\r\nare proud that Armenia’s major enterprises are finding\r\nways to contribute to art and culture, to invest in public\r\nlife and to become partners in our society’s pursuit of\r\nhappiness and quality of life.\r\nIn 2005, the international community will review\r\nthe progress that has been made in the implementation\r\nof the global development agenda. It would be most\r\nuseful if we could focus our resources on the\r\nimplementation of the agenda rather than on restating\r\nour collective good intentions. In other words, we must\r\nfind the political will to make the political and\r\nfinancial commitments necessary to overcome the\r\noutstanding obstacles.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals are\r\nguidelines for Armenia. To that end, the empowerment\r\nof women, the protection of children and the fight\r\nagainst poverty are not just goals for us: they are\r\nbuilding blocks for a prosperous, healthy and stable\r\nsociety. The Government of Armenia has approved\r\nnational action plans on the protection of the rights of\r\nthe child, on improving the status of women and\r\nenhancing their role in our society and on preventing\r\ntrafficking in persons. In addition, a broad anti-\r\ncorruption strategy, developed with the participation\r\nand counsel of the international community, will\r\ncomplement the poverty reduction strategy programme\r\nthat is already beginning to yield results.\r\nWe are continuing our effective collaboration\r\nwith United Nations bodies on a number of important\r\nissues, including use of information and\r\ncommunication technologies to improve governance\r\nand institutionalize public/private interactions. With\r\ndonor community support, focused institution-building\r\nand good governance, we expect that the human rights\r\nand democratic reforms of the past decade will go\r\nbeyond the solid legislative framework that has already\r\nbeen developed and will take root — psychologically\r\nand socially — in our society.\r\nArmenia, as an active member of the Economic\r\nand Social Council and the Commission on Human\r\nRights, will remain involved in international\r\ndevelopment cooperation. At the same time, we will\r\nparticipate in the effort to improve the consultation and\r\ncoordination mechanisms that are essential for the\r\neffectiveness of the collective security system and we\r\nlook forward to the assessment of the High-level Panel\r\non Threats, Challenges and Change.\r\nWe stand for broader cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations to ensure\r\nthe broader involvement and commitment of countries\r\nin decision-making and implementation processes.\r\nReform is necessary within those valued organizations\r\nif we are to effectively address today’s realities and\r\nchallenges and resolve tomorrow’s problems. To do\r\nthat, we cannot work with yesterday’s mechanisms. A\r\nrevitalized General Assembly is indispensable for\r\neffective United Nations action. We would also support\r\nJapan, Germany and India joining countries from\r\nAfrica and Latin America as permanent members of an\r\nenlarged and more representative Security Council.\r\nIn a few short years, Armenia has done away with\r\nthe false proposition that we must choose between East\r\nand West, between the old world and the new. We have\r\ndone away with the myth that our neighbours can\r\ncontrol the pace of our economic development and\r\nshape its direction. Now we want to do away with the\r\nvery dangerous notion that yesterday’s adversaries are\r\nenemies forever.\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nArmenia is ready to compromise and collaborate\r\nwith neighbours who are ready to join us in making\r\nhistory, not rewriting it. We want to work with an\r\nAzerbaijan that understands its place in a rule-based\r\ninternational order, not one whose policies, practices\r\nand statements threaten the fragile peace and stability\r\nof our region.\r\nAzerbaijan was the first to introduce ethnic\r\ncleansing in the Soviet space, the first to engage\r\nmercenaries and international terrorists in its own\r\ndefence and the first to discard the “rules of\r\nengagement” in international organizations.\r\nLet me explain. The Armenian presence in the\r\nregion of the Caucasus has been long and extensive.\r\nIndeed, denying or rewriting that history requires\r\nsystematic planning, energy and resources.\r\nUnfortunately, the Government of Azerbaijan has not\r\nspared those resources. Azerbaijan succeeded in\r\neliminating the Armenians of Nakhichevan, who\r\ncomprised more than half the population there. There\r\nwere more than 400,000 Armenians living in\r\nAzerbaijan during the Soviet period. The pogroms of\r\nSumgait and Baku led to the fact that there are none\r\ntoday. Indeed, the Azerbaijani experiment in ethnic\r\ncleansing worked.\r\nA decade ago, Azerbaijan retained the services of\r\nmercenaries and international terrorists — the same\r\nnames we hear today — to fight against the Armenian\r\nmen and women who were defending their own lands\r\nand homes against aerial bombings and proximate\r\nshelling. The terrorists lost, Armenians won.\r\nFinally, Azerbaijan’s leadership dismisses the\r\nopportunities offered by membership in international\r\norganizations to build bridges and seek solutions.\r\nToday, Azerbaijan rejects mediation by those who wish\r\nto help halt drug trafficking through its territory. It\r\ndismisses efforts by the Council of Europe and other\r\nmonitoring groups to come to the region and see with\r\ntheir own eyes, at first hand, the destruction of\r\nthousands of irreplaceable historic and cultural\r\nmarkers. Azerbaijan squawks about its desire for\r\nNATO membership, even as it repeatedly prohibits a\r\npartner’s participation in NATO exercises. Worse,\r\nAzerbaijan not only does not rebuke, it champions the\r\nAzerbaijani military officer who decapitated a fellow\r\nArmenian officer in a NATO training course in\r\nBudapest. It maligns the Minsk Group of the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to\r\nhide its own refusal to consider the proposals that have\r\ngrown from the discussions and negotiations in which\r\nits own leadership has participated. For more than half\r\na decade, Azerbaijan has rejected every proposal\r\nbefore it from the “common State” proposal in 1998 to\r\nthe Key West document of 2001.\r\nArmenians prevailed in the military confrontation\r\nunleashed by Azerbaijan in response to the peaceful\r\ndemands of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh for self-\r\ndetermination. Contrary to the assertion made by\r\nAzerbaijan’s President from this podium, Armenians\r\nhave occupied those lands for over 2,000 years, and not\r\njust the last 10. Today, Nagorno-Karabakh has reversed\r\nthe injustice done by Stalin back in the mid-1920s. It is\r\nfree, democratic and tolerant of minorities. Nagorno-\r\nKarabakh holds regular elections, has State and\r\nsecurity structures, completely controls its own\r\nterritory and has a growing economy.\r\nIf in the past century Armenians and Azerbaijanis\r\nwere forcibly linked together, in the present century —\r\nin which we have won the right to our own destinies —\r\nwe can determine to live together peaceably. If we are\r\nserious about becoming full, deserving residents of the\r\nEuropean neighbourhood — where borders do not\r\ncount, but intentions and tolerance do — we will have\r\nto come to terms with our past, with our history and\r\nwith the realities that have gripped our region.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Momodu Koroma, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of the\r\nRepublic of Sierra Leone.\r\nMr. Koroma (Sierra Leone): I would like to join\r\nothers in congratulating you, Mr. President, on your\r\nelection to direct the affairs of the General\r\nAssembly — this great parliament of nations — at its\r\nfifty-ninth session. Let me also take this opportunity to\r\npay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency\r\nMr. Julian Hunte, especially for the momentum he gave\r\nto the ongoing process of the revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nOnce again, in his annual report on the work of\r\nthe Organization and in his forthright statement to the\r\nAssembly last week, the Secretary-General set the tone\r\nof the annual general debate. My delegation commends\r\nhim for his tenacity and courage under extreme\r\npolitical circumstances and shares his overall\r\nassessment of the current international situation and\r\nthe role of the United Nations.\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nJust a little more than three weeks ago, on the\r\ninitiative of the member States of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, the Assembly reaffirmed the central role of\r\nthe United Nations in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security and the promotion of international\r\ncooperation. It was, indeed, a reaffirmation that this\r\nOrganization was founded on international cooperation\r\nand that its efficacy is rooted in international\r\ncooperation. My delegation therefore urges all Member\r\nStates to adhere to the principle of cooperation.\r\nSierra Leone believes, and will continue to\r\nbelieve in the United Nations. After all, we are part of\r\nthe United Nations, like each and every State\r\nrepresented in the General Assembly. Of course there\r\nare some difficulties, but we strongly believe that,\r\ngiven adequate resources and cooperative support in a\r\ntimely manner and given the necessary moral and\r\npolitical support, the United Nations can deliver, as it\r\nhas done admirably in Sierra Leone.\r\nIn that connection, allow me to express our\r\nsincere appreciation to all the countries that have\r\ncontributed to the United Nations Mission in Sierra\r\nLeone (UNAMSIL). Our thanks also go out to the staff\r\nof all the agencies and programmes of the United\r\nNations family and the non-governmental\r\norganizations that have worked in partnership with the\r\nUnited Nations, the Government and civil society to\r\nrestore peace and stability in our country and, most\r\nrecently, to conduct local government elections.\r\nA theme that has reverberated within the Hall in\r\nthe past week, and in other international forums, is the\r\nobservance of the rule of law. The Secretary-General’s\r\nanalysis of its significance needs no embellishment.\r\nThe causes and character of the conflict in Sierra\r\nLeone, perhaps more than in any other country in the\r\nworld in recent times, tell us that nearly everything\r\ncrumbles when the rule of law collapses and that,\r\ntherefore, it should be made the pillar of post-conflict\r\nreconstruction, national recovery, governance and\r\nadministration of justice and the cornerstone of lasting\r\npeace.\r\nWhile the Government of Sierra Leone is\r\nstruggling, albeit with limited resources, to reform its\r\nown administration of justice, it is also concerned\r\nabout the financial situation of the Special Court,\r\nestablished in the country to address impunity. The\r\nefficacy, and indeed the credibility of the Court, could\r\nbe questioned unless urgent measures are taken to\r\naddress its budgetary problems. I should therefore like\r\nto take this opportunity to appeal for continued\r\nvoluntary contributions, as well as the requested\r\nsubventions from the regular budget of the United\r\nNations for the Special Court.\r\nAs President Kabbah said at the formal opening\r\nof the courthouse last March, it is\r\n“a Special Court for Sierra Leone, a symbol of\r\nthe rule of law and an essential element in the\r\npursuit of peace, justice and national\r\nreconciliation for the people of Sierra Leone. It is\r\nalso a Special Court for the international\r\ncommunity, a symbol of the rule of international\r\nlaw.”\r\nThere is no guarantee that the victims of\r\nviolations of international humanitarian and human\r\nrights law during the civil war in Sierra Leone will\r\nreceive reparation for those heinous crimes. So the\r\nleast we can do for them now is to ensure that justice is\r\ndone. We can do so by reducing the financial burden of\r\nthe Special Court and by demonstrating that we are\r\nindeed serious about respect for the rule of law.\r\nThe United Nations was formed over 50 years\r\nago as a response to the peace and security needs of the\r\nera of its birth. Since then, the world has experienced,\r\nand continues to experience, fundamental changes, to\r\nwhich the United Nations should adapt. That is why\r\nSierra Leoneans continue to follow with profound\r\ninterest the consultative processes for the revitalization\r\nof the General Assembly and reforms in the Security\r\nCouncil in order to reflect the reality of the\r\ncontemporary world. My delegation wishes to urge the\r\nPresident to sustain the momentum in the processes\r\ngenerated by the fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe menace of terrorism and local conflicts\r\ncontinues to impede peace, stability and development\r\nin many parts of the world. Innocent victims aside,\r\nconflicts have reversed the development gains of poor\r\ncountries, and even reduced them to the status of\r\ndonor-dependants. While deploring all acts of\r\nterrorism, it is important to recognize that poor\r\ncountries, particularly those emerging from conflict,\r\nhave weak capacity to fight terrorism. If global action\r\nis what is needed to fight terrorism, and my delegation\r\nbelieves that this should be the case, efforts should be\r\nmade to enhance the capacity of poor countries to play\r\ntheir own role in that battle.\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nAfter about 11 years of a violent and destructive\r\ncivil conflict, Sierra Leone is now in the delicate post-\r\nconflict phase. It is in that phase that the root causes of\r\nthe conflict should be addressed and the foundation for\r\npermanent peace, stability and sustainable development\r\nshould be laid. In short, that is the phase in which the\r\ngains of the peace effort should be maximized, using a\r\nsynergetic approach that incorporates development and\r\nother strands of generators of peace into peacekeeping.\r\nBut this approach needs resources and planning beyond\r\nthe traditional peacekeeping strategies that involve\r\npulling out when the guns fall silent.\r\nIt is in that regard that my delegation is soliciting\r\ncontinued and enhanced support for post-conflict\r\nSierra Leone. An important component of this appeal is\r\nthat development and financial institutions should\r\nunderstand the multifaceted demands and delicate\r\ncharacter of post-conflict situations and treat them as\r\nspecial cases. That means that those institutions should\r\nrevisit their rigid and standard prescriptions, with the\r\npurpose of making them flexible and responsive to the\r\nspecial requirements of post-conflict situations.\r\nTen days ago, the Security Council extended the\r\nmandate of UNAMSIL to June 2005. The Government\r\nof Sierra Leone has endorsed the Secretary-General’s\r\nassessment and recommendations regarding the\r\nbenchmarks for the residual presence of UNAMSIL in\r\nthe country. We note in particular that, over the next\r\nseveral months, the Security Council will review the\r\nresidual functions against the capacity of the Sierra\r\nLeone armed forces and police to maintain security and\r\nstability effectively throughout the country. We hope\r\nthat the review will also take into consideration the\r\nsecurity situation in the subregion.\r\nI would like to reassure the international\r\ncommunity through the Assembly that we do not\r\nexpect UNAMSIL to remain in Sierra Leone\r\nindefinitely. The Government of Sierra Leone is\r\ndetermined to ensure a smooth and seamless transition\r\nfrom UNAMSIL to the Republic of Sierra Leone\r\nArmed Forces and the police throughout the country.\r\nThe restructured army and the police have already\r\ndemonstrated through training, discipline and\r\nperformance that they are nearly ready to assume full\r\nresponsibility for the security and safety of the people\r\nof Sierra Leone. But training is only a part of the total\r\npicture of readiness. For effective operational\r\nreadiness, both the army and the police need logistical\r\nsupport and equipment. Accordingly, my delegation\r\nwishes to appeal to friendly nations for assistance to\r\nequip our security forces to enable them to function\r\neffectively. Meanwhile, for obvious reasons, the\r\nGovernment and people of Sierra Leone are\r\nencouraged by the prospects for consolidating the\r\ndeployment of the United Nations peacekeeping\r\nmission throughout neighbouring Liberia.\r\nRecent dialogue between, and among, the leaders\r\nof the Mano River Union also augur well for peace and\r\nstability in our subregion. We need the continued\r\nsupport of the international community in resuscitating\r\nthe objectives and programmes of the Mano River\r\nUnion, because, if fully functional, it can complement\r\nthe efforts of the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) and the United Nations in\r\nthe subregion. In that connection, I would like to\r\nexpress our appreciation to the Secretary-General for\r\nhis encouragement of the rejuvenation process of the\r\nUnion.\r\nThe United Nations has already identified many\r\nof the root causes of armed conflict within States. With\r\nthe assistance of the international community, efforts\r\nare being made to address those root causes. The\r\nobjective is to prevent the recurrence of armed\r\nconflicts. My delegation believes that equal attention\r\nshould also be paid to the root causes of armed conflict\r\nacross States, including the senseless acts of\r\ninternational terrorism that are being perpetrated in\r\nmany parts of the world. While prompt, effective and\r\ndecisive measures are absolutely necessary to deal with\r\nthe phenomenon, it is about time that we try to identify\r\nand address the root causes of such ignoble acts.\r\nNew challenges are emerging and new threats are\r\nbeing hatched in various corners of our world with\r\nunprecedented frequency. However, we must not forget\r\nthe old, unresolved challenges and threats to human\r\nsafety and security. Without prejudging the outcome of\r\nthe Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change, Sierra Leone hopes that the\r\nPanel’s report will help to throw some light on the\r\nprobable link between what could be described as old\r\nand still existing threats and those now being\r\ncharacterized as new threats and challenges. Perhaps,\r\nas President Kabbah suggested at the Millennium\r\nSummit four years ago, the old and still existing\r\nchallenges are taking on a new form and new\r\ndimensions. What we are experiencing is, perhaps, the\r\ntransmutation of threats and challenges.\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nIn speaking of old challenges and threats, the\r\nquestion of Palestine comes to mind. It has been on our\r\nagenda for far too long. We know that that is a complex\r\nissue. However, the longer it remains unresolved, the\r\ngreater the risk of unending cycles of violence. Sierra\r\nLeone firmly believes that an equitable solution, in\r\nparticular the establishment of an independent\r\nPalestinian State side by side with Israel within secure\r\nborders, would be a giant step towards peace and\r\nsecurity, not only in the Middle East but also in the rest\r\nof our troubled and unsafe world.\r\nStill in the area of existing threats to international\r\npeace and security, my delegation is disturbed by the\r\ntragic humanitarian situation in the Darfur region of\r\nthe Sudan. We applaud the response of the African\r\nUnion to the crisis and urge all stakeholders to do\r\nwhatever is necessary to speedily resolve the conflict.\r\nBut let me emphasize that the African Union would\r\nlike to do more — and would do more if it had the\r\nresources. Accordingly, I would like to make an open\r\nappeal, on behalf of the African Union Commission,\r\nfor financial and material support for the African\r\nUnion to enable it to deal with the situation.\r\nThe Government and the people of Sierra Leone\r\nknow from experience that ceasefire, disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and reintegration are essential\r\ncomponents of peace. But we are still faced with the\r\ndaunting task of consolidating the peace, because peace\r\ngoes far beyond the process of the disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants. The\r\nconsolidation of peace — real peace — means\r\nimprovements in the lives and livelihoods of all our\r\npeople. It means jobs, food, education, health care,\r\nadequate housing and other social services. As the\r\nSecretary-General observed in his most recent report\r\non the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone,\r\nconsiderable progress has been made towards\r\neconomic and social recovery. However, in order to\r\nsustain the process of consolidating peace and to\r\nfacilitate the smooth transition from recovery to\r\nsustainable development, Sierra Leone needs continued\r\nsupport, particularly for vulnerable areas of the\r\ncountry.\r\nWe look forward to the 2005 comprehensive\r\nreview of the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals — a review that will coincide with\r\nthe sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations. We in\r\nSierra Leone will also be reviewing the state of our\r\nfood security goal of ensuring that by the end of 2007,\r\nno Sierra Leonean will go to bed hungry. Our food\r\nsecurity goal must be seen in the context of one of the\r\nUnited Nations Millennium Development Goals,\r\nnamely, the reduction of extreme poverty and hunger.\r\nGiven the grave consequences of extreme poverty and\r\nstarvation, those are realistic goals. They represent the\r\nminimum standard necessary to save lives. They are\r\nattainable.\r\nWe know that it is our responsibility to do more\r\nfor ourselves. We also know the urgency of addressing\r\nthe democratic deficit in international economic and\r\nfinancial decision-making. In our interdependent and\r\nincreasingly globalizing world, economic and social\r\ninequities within countries are a reflection of unfair\r\nrules, unfair trade practices and an uneven playing\r\nfield in international transactions. The Director-\r\nGeneral of the International Labour Organization, Juan\r\nSomavia, was correct when he told the recent African\r\nUnion summit in Ouagadougou that good national\r\ngovernance will not succeed unless we have good\r\nglobal governance.\r\nConsumers need to share, in a more equitable\r\nmanner with producers in the developing world, the\r\nbenefits derived from their abundant natural and\r\nhuman resources. That means, among other things, fair\r\nprices and debt relief, all of which should have a\r\npositive impact on our capacity to reduce poverty\r\nwithin our respective developing countries.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I give the floor\r\nto His Excellency Mr. Gábor Bródi, Deputy Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Hungary.\r\nMr. Bródi (Hungary): I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to extend to you, Sir, our sincere\r\ncongratulations on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. You may\r\nsafely count on my delegation’s full support in the\r\ndischarge of your important responsibilities.\r\nHungary is firmly committed to effective\r\nmultilateralism as a key tool of its foreign policy. Well-\r\nfunctioning international organizations and institutions\r\nhaving broad political support in the international\r\ncommunity can and should, indeed, play a significant\r\nrole in addressing the challenges of our globalized\r\nworld.\r\nWe are looking forward with eager expectation to\r\nthe outcome of the work of the High-Level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change, set up by the\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nSecretary-General, to be finalized later this year.\r\nAddressing the complex and difficult tasks that we are\r\nfacing today needs not only strong political will on the\r\npart of all of us, but also an improved and adapted\r\nmultilateral framework of cooperation.\r\nOnly a system of international institutions whose\r\nactivities and form of operation are renewed and\r\nadjusted to the realities of our contemporary world can\r\nbe effective as an instrument in addressing successfully\r\nthe threats and challenges.\r\nHungary remains strongly committed to making\r\nthe United Nations more effective. To this end, the\r\nUnited Nations, including the Security Council, must\r\nadapt to the changing circumstances of the political\r\nlandscape.\r\nNew and emerging threats, including\r\ninternational terrorism, the danger of the proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction and their means of\r\ndelivery, transnational organized crime and failing\r\nStates are all grave menaces. The role played by\r\nMember States in prevention and early warning should\r\ntherefore be stronger than ever. These challenges are\r\nglobal or regional in nature and, in our view, the\r\nresponse to them must be at the same level. Without\r\nsuch enhanced cooperation among the members of the\r\ninternational community, all efforts are doomed to be\r\nfruitless.\r\nHeinous acts of terrorism such as those that\r\ncaused immense human suffering in New York,\r\nWashington, D.C., Bali, Istanbul, Madrid and, recently,\r\nthe Russian Federation, should be considered brutal\r\nattacks against the values of democracies. By putting\r\ninnocent lives at risk, they also seek to undermine the\r\nopenness and tolerance of our societies.\r\nAlong with our partners in the European Union,\r\nHungary strongly condemns all forms of terrorism. In\r\nthis regard, we fully support the important work of the\r\nSecurity Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee. We\r\nhope that its reinvigorated activity, including planned\r\nvisits by the Committee to Member States, will\r\ncontribute to the enhancement of our capabilities in\r\ncombating terrorism. It is of the utmost importance to\r\nprovide assistance in strengthening the preparedness of\r\nthose countries that are eager to tackle the menace\r\noriginating from their territory.\r\nSubstantial work has been undertaken on freezing\r\nfunds and financial resources to prevent the financing\r\nof terrorism. The United Nations has to continue to be\r\na key player in that fight. To achieve real and tangible\r\nresults in that regard, we have to ensure full\r\nimplementation of the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions and the accession of the largest possible\r\nnumber of States to international conventions and\r\nprotocols to combat terrorism. Hungary has done its\r\npart to that end.\r\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\r\nand their means of delivery continues to be a clear and\r\npresent threat to international peace and security. New\r\ndiscoveries of large-scale nuclear-weapon programmes,\r\nnetworks of illicit trafficking in nuclear material and\r\ntechnology and the ill-conceived policies of denial and\r\ndeceit about the purpose and nature of such\r\nprogrammes remain a most serious concern to the\r\ninternational community. There is a growing\r\nrecognition, shared by Hungary, that those programmes\r\nalso represent the most serious risks of proliferation.\r\nThe danger of nuclear, biological and chemical\r\nweapons falling into the hands of rogue States, terrorist\r\ngroups or, for that matter, any other non-State actors\r\nthat menace our world, gives rise to new, major\r\nsecurity challenges. In that regard, we must act\r\ntogether in a decisive manner, both regionally and\r\nglobally.\r\nIn that respect, Hungary strongly supports the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1540\r\n(2004), which calls on all States to establish effective\r\nnational export controls. We urge full implementation\r\nof that resolution and are prepared to assist others in\r\ndoing so.\r\nIn our fast-changing world security environment,\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) is and should remain the cornerstone\r\nof the universal non-proliferation regime. Along with\r\nour European Union partners, we are committed to\r\nsafeguarding the Treaty’s authority and integrity. In\r\nthat context, we are looking forward to the Seventh\r\nReview Conference of the NPT next year.\r\nWe should continue our efforts in the field of\r\nconflict prevention and post-conflict crisis\r\nmanagement. For millions of people in conflict areas,\r\nthose efforts mean hope for peace and a better, more\r\nsecure future.\r\nWe are confident that the joint efforts of the Iraqi\r\npeople and the international community will lead to a\r\ndemocratic and prosperous Iraq living in peace with\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nitself and its neighbours. Hungary strongly condemns\r\nthe terrorist acts and the kidnappings aimed at\r\nundermining the political and reconstruction process in\r\nthat much-suffering country. The contribution of the\r\nUnited Nations is essential for success. Our\r\nOrganization has already proven to be effective in\r\nadvancing the political process when it seemed to have\r\ncome to a standstill.\r\nHungary continues to contribute, along with\r\ncoalition forces, to the stabilization and the\r\nimprovement of security conditions in Iraq. We deem it\r\nimportant that relevant international organizations and\r\ninstitutions increase their joint efforts towards that end,\r\nincluding through the training of Iraqi security\r\npersonnel.\r\nAt this moment, our priorities in Iraq must be to\r\nassist preparations for the national elections and the\r\ndrafting of a new constitution. Security Council\r\nresolution 1546 (2004) provides a key role for the\r\nUnited Nations in the political transition process. Its\r\nample experience in establishing democratic\r\ninstitutions, the rule of law, the promotion of respect\r\nfor human rights and fundamental freedoms and\r\nelectoral assistance can and should be utilized.\r\nHungary views the potentially successful\r\nrealization of the presidential and the subsequent\r\nparliamentary elections in Afghanistan as important\r\nsteps towards the normalization of the political\r\nsituation in that country. We welcome the fact that\r\ndespite unsatisfactory security conditions, progress is\r\nbeing made on preparations for the presidential\r\nelections to be held in October this year.\r\nHungary is deeply concerned about the continued\r\nviolence in the Middle East, where substantial progress\r\nis yet to be achieved. We remain convinced that full\r\nand unconditional implementation of the road map\r\noffers the best chance for the parties directly involved\r\nto live side by side in peace and security. We urge all\r\ninvolved, including the Quartet, to redouble their\r\nefforts to that end.\r\nThe situation in the Balkans continues to remain\r\nat the centre of our attention. Overall developments in\r\nthe region and the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity have resulted in a calm but fragile political\r\nenvironment. In that respect, Hungary is committed to\r\nmaintaining its presence in the international missions,\r\nin the service of peace and stability, in that region\r\nwhich is so close to us.\r\nIn that connection, we are following with serious\r\nconcern the deterioration of the human rights situation\r\nin our immediate neighbourhood — in Serbia and\r\nMontenegro. It is particularly alarming that the number\r\nof incidents perpetrated against the non-Serb\r\npopulation, including the Hungarian community, is on\r\nthe rise. Hungary once again calls upon the Serbian\r\nauthorities to take the necessary measures to stop and\r\nto prevent those violent acts, as well as to identify,\r\nprosecute and punish the perpetrators of serious crimes\r\nof physical abuse, as well as psychological threats and\r\nintimidation. We are looking forward to the results of\r\nthe international monitoring currently under way.\r\nInternational protection of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms is at the core of the foreign\r\npolicy of Hungary. It is not only an expression of\r\nsupport for the universal values we feel so close to our\r\nhearts. It is also an essential prerequisite for preserving\r\nhuman dignity and enhancing liberty in our\r\ncontemporary world. Freedom of the individual and\r\nfull respect for the rights of human beings are matters\r\nwell above the authority of any given State.\r\nIn today’s world, we could hardly find a country\r\nwhere everyone speaks the same language or shares the\r\nsame culture, beliefs and traditions. The presence of\r\ndifferent national, ethnic, linguistic and religious\r\ngroups within the borders of a country is not only an\r\nasset but also a source of social and cultural\r\nenrichment. It is our firm belief that the United\r\nNations, as the most comprehensive multilateral\r\norganization, has a major role to play in the promotion\r\nof respect for, and the observance of, human rights,\r\nincluding the rights of national minorities.\r\nAgainst that background, the international\r\ncommunity should continue to examine all possible\r\nways to promote and establish an early-warning\r\nmechanism or a monitoring body dealing with\r\nminority-related situations. That should include the\r\noptions of nominating a Special Rapporteur on\r\nminorities and elaborating a legally binding universal\r\ndocument to address shortcomings.\r\nNext year, with a major event, will be particularly\r\nimportant for the United Nations. In the course of\r\naddressing the burning issues on our agenda, we have\r\nto take a long, hard look at our tasks, including the\r\nreview of the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, adopted by heads of State and\r\nGovernment in 2000. In our view, the review exercise\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nrequires careful preparation, vision, political\r\ndetermination and the courage to act. Hungary is ready\r\nand willing to take part in this process.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo,\r\nSecretary for Relations with States of the Observer\r\nState of the Holy See.\r\nArchbishop Lajolo (Holy See): The Holy See is\r\nhonoured to take part in the general debate of the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations for the first\r\ntime since the Assembly adopted resolution 58/314 on\r\n1 July 2004, which formalized and specified the rights\r\nand prerogatives of its status as a Permanent Observer,\r\na status which the Holy See has enjoyed since 1964.\r\nIt is therefore my pleasant duty to express sincere\r\ngratitude to all the Member States. In approving the\r\naforesaid resolution, they signalled once again the\r\nparticular bond of cooperation between the Apostolic\r\nSee and the United Nations, already underlined by\r\nPope John Paul II on his first visit to this Assembly\r\nexactly 25 years ago. In this significant circumstance, I\r\nam honoured to convey to you, Sir, and to all of you\r\ngathered here to represent your noble countries, the\r\nrespectful and cordial greetings of Pope John Paul II. I\r\nbring a special greeting to the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, and also to his\r\nworthy assistants. Their work, as recorded in the\r\nannual report of the Secretary General (A/59/1) with\r\nreference, above all, to conflict prevention and\r\npeacekeeping in the world, deserves the appreciation\r\nand gratitude of us all.\r\nSeveral of the themes included in the agenda of\r\nthe General Assembly may be considered essential for\r\nattaining the supreme objective of peace and for the\r\nfuture of humanity. To quote only a few: the United\r\nNations and a new global human order; pursuit of the\r\nMillennium Goals; total and general disarmament;\r\nglobalization and interdependence; international\r\nmigration and development; human rights; and human\r\ncloning. I shall limit myself to a brief presentation of\r\nthe Holy See’s position regarding some of those issues.\r\nAmong the Millennium Goals, pride of place\r\ngoes to the theme of poverty and development. I say\r\npride of place, because it concerns the right to\r\nsubsistence of hundreds of millions of human beings,\r\nsurviving — as best they can — below the threshold of\r\nwhat is necessary, as well as tens of millions of\r\nundernourished children unjustly deprived of the right\r\nto live.\r\nIn order to find a lasting solution to those\r\ninhumane conditions, it is necessary to progress, under\r\nthe aegis of the United Nations, towards a more\r\nflexible and more just international trade system.\r\nFurthermore, financial structures are needed which\r\nfavour development and the cancellation of foreign\r\ndebt for the poorest countries. Likewise, the results of\r\nscientific research and technology must be generously\r\nshared, especially in the field of health.\r\nOn that matter I need say no more, since the Holy\r\nSee’s position has already been presented once again\r\nby the Cardinal Secretary of State, at the conference on\r\nhunger and poverty held in New York on\r\n20 September. I repeat only this: the urgency of the\r\nsituation cannot tolerate delay. It is a question of\r\njustice.\r\nOf immediate relevance to the supreme good of\r\npeace is the theme of total and general disarmament. If\r\nit is true that the production and sale of arms to other\r\ncountries endangers peace, it follows that severe and\r\neffective international controls are needed. The\r\ncommitment of the United Nations in that area is\r\nattested to by the various conventions it has supported\r\nwith reference to weapons of mass destruction as well\r\nas conventional weapons. But we are only at the\r\nbeginning of a long process, with huge economic\r\ninterests as obstacles along our path towards peace.\r\nThe problem of weapons of mass destruction is\r\nclearly to be distinguished from that of conventional\r\nweapons; but the latter have a terrible and unending\r\ncontemporary relevance in the numerous armed\r\nconflicts that stain the world with blood, and also in\r\nterrorism.\r\nRegional armed conflicts are so numerous that\r\nthere is no time to list them all. However, there are\r\nsome that I cannot omit to mention. Above all there is\r\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That conflict is not\r\nsimply contained within the narrow territorial\r\nboundaries of the region itself. Those directly involved\r\nare the Israeli Government and the Palestinian\r\nAuthority, and they have the grave duty to demonstrate\r\ntheir desire for peace. With this end in view, a road\r\nmap has been drawn up and formally accepted by both\r\nparties; may they proceed along it with determination\r\nand courage.\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\nBut that conflict is also followed with intense\r\ninterest and often with passion by large sections of\r\nhumanity. The Catholic Church, present in Palestine\r\nfor 2,000 years, invites all concerned to turn their\r\nbacks on any action likely to destroy confidence and to\r\nutter generous words of peace and make bold gestures\r\nof peace. And if peace is the fruit of justice, let it not\r\nbe forgotten — as Pope John Paul II has reminded\r\nus — that there can be no justice without forgiveness;\r\nindeed, without mutual forgiveness.\r\nThen there is the Iraqi conflict. The position of\r\nthe Holy See concerning the military action of 2002-\r\n2003 is well known. Everyone can see that it did not\r\nlead to a safer world either inside or outside Iraq. The\r\nHoly See believes it is now imperative to support the\r\npresent Iraqi Government in its efforts to bring the\r\ncountry to normality and to a political system that is\r\nsubstantially democratic and in harmony with the\r\nvalues of its historic traditions.\r\nThe Holy See is gravely concerned about various\r\nAfrican countries scarred by bloodshed arising from\r\nmutual conflicts and even more from internal strife.\r\nThey need active international solidarity: more\r\nspecifically, and connaturally, the African Union needs\r\nto intervene authoritatively so as to bring all legitimate\r\ninterested parties around a negotiating table. The\r\nAfrican Union has already demonstrated its ability to\r\nact successfully in some cases: it deserves recognition\r\nand support.\r\nI have mentioned the theme of terrorism, an\r\naberrant phenomenon, utterly unworthy of man, which\r\nhas already assumed global dimensions: today no State\r\ncan presume to be safe from it. Hence, it seems\r\nobvious that terrorists can be effectively challenged\r\nonly through a concerted, multilateral approach,\r\nrespecting the ius gentium, and not through a policy of\r\nunilateralism. No one is in any doubt that the fight\r\nagainst terrorism means, first and foremost,\r\nneutralizing its active breeding grounds. But the\r\nunderlying causes are many and complex: political,\r\nsocial, cultural, religious; for this reason, what is still\r\nmore important is long-term action, directed, with\r\nforesight and patience, at its roots, designed to stop its\r\nspreading further and to extinguish its deadly\r\ncontagious effects.\r\nThe Holy See, and the entire Catholic Church, is\r\nactively involved in this work. It is involved through\r\nits educational and charitable institutions, which,\r\nwherever they are, are committed to raising the cultural\r\nand social levels of the populations, without any\r\ndiscrimination, especially on religious grounds; it is\r\ninvolved through interreligious dialogue, which has\r\ngrown in intensity ever since the Second Vatican\r\nEcumenical Council. The Holy See will always be\r\ngrateful to the authorities of other religions that\r\ndemonstrate openness to such dialogue, and also to the\r\ncivil authorities that encourage it, without any political\r\ninterference, respecting the distinction between the\r\nreligious and the civil sphere and the fundamental\r\nhuman right to freedom of religion.\r\nThe right to freedom of religion is sanctioned,\r\ntogether with other fundamental rights, in the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by\r\nthe General Assembly of the United Nations on\r\n10 December 1948. Such fundamental human rights\r\nstand or fall together. And man stands or falls with\r\nthem.\r\nFor this reason, every effort has to be made to\r\ndefend them in all fields. For this to happen, one\r\nparticular danger must be avoided, which is found\r\ntoday in various countries and social settings. It is the\r\nidea that these fundamental human rights, as\r\nsanctioned by the Universal Declaration, are\r\nexpressions of a particular culture and are therefore\r\nhighly relative. No, at heart, they are expressions of the\r\nhuman being as such, even if the fact remains that, at\r\ndifferent times and in different cultures, they may have\r\nbeen and may still be differently applied, in more or\r\nless adequate and acceptable ways.\r\nAmong the fundamental rights, or rather foremost\r\namong them, as the Universal Declaration explicitly\r\nstates, is the right to life of every individual. The Holy\r\nSee could say a great deal about the right to life of\r\nevery individual, because the essence of its message is\r\nthe gospel of life.\r\nThe question of human cloning comes under the\r\nsame broad heading. In a few weeks, this General\r\nAssembly will resume its debate on human cloning. In\r\nthis respect, the Holy See is pleased to reaffirm its\r\ncommitment to support the advancement of medical\r\nscience, conducted always in a manner that respects\r\nhuman dignity, because it offers healing and cures for\r\nvarious diseases. With this end in view, the Holy See\r\nreiterates its support for the procurement and use of\r\nadult stem cells and believes that the way forward is to\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.15\r\ndraw up and implement a clear convention that will\r\nresult in a comprehensive ban on human cloning.\r\n“Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and\r\nof the equal and inalienable rights of all members\r\nof the human family is the foundation of freedom,\r\njustice and peace in the world,”\r\nSo begins the preamble to the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights. It is one of the many undeniable merits\r\nof the United Nations to have proposed to the\r\nconscience of all humanity, more than 50 years ago,\r\nthese secure principles for progress towards peace.\r\nOver the years, however, the United Nations has\r\nneeded to adapt its procedures to take account of\r\ndevelopments on the world political scene so that its\r\nwork for the promotion of peace can become more\r\neffective. The first results of the high-level commission\r\nset up for this purpose by Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan were published last June. The Holy See will be\r\nable to offer some explicit evaluation on the occasion\r\nof the debate on the subject to be held next week.\r\nFor now, I should simply like to recall Pope John\r\nPaul II’s words for this year’s International Day of\r\nPeace. He reminded us that humanity today is in a new\r\nand more difficult phase of its genuine development,\r\nand he called for a greater degree of international\r\nordering. This could be brought about by giving\r\norganizations like the United Nations special\r\nprerogatives to facilitate action to prevent conflicts at\r\ntimes of international crisis, and also, when absolutely\r\nnecessary, humanitarian intervention — that is, action\r\naimed at disarming the aggressor.\r\nYet, the greater degree of international ordering\r\ncould be achieved still more effectively if the United\r\nNations were to rise to the status of a moral centre,\r\nwhere all nations of the world feel at home and\r\ndevelop a shared awareness of being, as it were, a\r\nfamily of nations.\r\nNow and in the future, the United Nations can\r\ncount on the Holy See to be not only an attentive\r\nPermanent Observer, but also a travelling companion,\r\never ready to support its complex and difficult activity,\r\nand also to collaborate in a spirit of freedom and\r\nfriendship with all the Member States.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.\r\n"
