(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Sebastian Anefal,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia.\r\nMr. Anefal (Federated States of Micronesia):\r\nI am honoured by the opportunity to speak before the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session on behalf of\r\nthe people of my Pacific island nation, the Federated\r\nStates of Micronesia, and on behalf of our President,\r\nJoseph J. Urusemal.\r\nAllow me to extend my congratulations to you,\r\nMr. President, on your well-deserved election to this\r\nhigh office. I would also like to recognize Mr. Julian\r\nRobert Hunte of Saint Lucia for his distinguished\r\nservice as president of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-eighth session.\r\nSadly, there have been so many recent disasters in\r\nwhich innocent lives have been lost that time does not\r\npermit me to mention them all. Whenever we learn of\r\nhuman suffering brought about by the forces of nature —\r\nwhether by earthquake, storms or otherwise — our\r\nhearts go out to the victims. As Pacific islanders, my\r\npeople feel a special sympathy for the victims of the\r\nrecent typhoons and hurricanes in Haiti, Grenada,\r\nJamaica, Cuba, the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas,\r\nFlorida and in Japan and China, as well as in our own\r\ncountry and elsewhere in the Pacific, such as in Guam,\r\nthe Mariana Islands and in Niue. It does not take a\r\nscientist to see that such storms are now occurring with\r\nincreasing frequency and devastating intensity.\r\nWe must also express our great sadness over the\r\ncontinuing loss of life at the hands of terrorists, and we\r\ncondemn in the strongest terms all those who wrongly\r\nthink their causes are advanced by such misguided\r\nacts. All human life is precious, but the recent terrorist\r\natrocity committed against schoolchildren in Beslan,\r\nRussia, was particularly vile. The world must speak out\r\nwith one voice in utter contempt of those who were\r\nresponsible.\r\nI regret to say that, in addition to working to\r\ndefeat terrorism, this body must also find more\r\neffective means of combating genocide that is\r\nsponsored or tolerated by a Government. There must be\r\nno refuge for those who would deny entire populations\r\nthe basic right of existence.\r\nIt is obvious today that expressions of\r\ncondemnation and even multilateral treaties do not\r\ndeter such people. As our technology provides even\r\nmore effective and readily available means of mass\r\ndestruction, the bright promise of the coming years\r\ncould be overwhelmed by an unthinkable nightmare.\r\nThe people of the Federated States of Micronesia\r\nknow that even we, the inhabitants of a remote island\r\nnation, do not have the luxury of remoteness from the\r\nthreats posed by such crimes against humanity. These\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nare threats to which all are exposed and from which all\r\nare at risk. Though our numbers are relatively small,\r\nmany of our finest young citizens are standing today\r\nwith others on the front lines against tyranny and\r\noppression. We will not shirk our commitment, but, if\r\nthere is any hope of making such crimes a thing of the\r\npast, that commitment cannot be conditional or\r\nselective. It must be universal.\r\nEven if we summon up the will to act collectively\r\nto put down the darker side of human nature through\r\ncollective action, we must work much harder on a\r\nglobal scale to move towards eliminating the\r\nconditions that provide fertile ground for the sponsors\r\nof terrorism and genocide. These include conditions of\r\npoverty, hunger and inadequate access to clean water,\r\nsanitation, health care and education. All those\r\nconditions, of course, are familiar to students of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. Thanks in no small part to the\r\nwork of the Organization, statisticians are able to\r\nidentify significant, even dramatic, progress over the\r\npast 60 years, and those trends can be expected to\r\ncontinue as we dedicate ourselves to the attainment of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\r\nBut trends do not mean much to the children who\r\nwill die of starvation today, tomorrow and the day after\r\ntomorrow. Growth in gross domestic product is of little\r\ncomfort to the man desperately trying to support a\r\nfamily on less than $1 a day, who sees no hope of\r\nimproving his situation. The world — acting through\r\nthis and other bodies, in addition to providing direct\r\nassistance — must redouble its efforts, because there is\r\nstill a long way to go, and this planet of ours becomes\r\nmore dangerous every day.\r\nAs if what I have just mentioned were not\r\nchallenging enough, we also now know that the global\r\ncommunity faces a wide variety of complex tasks in\r\nprotecting the planet from environmental catastrophe.\r\nWe humans, sitting at the top of the genetic ladder,\r\nhave the capacity to foul the nest of Creation, and most\r\nagree that that is happening to one degree or another.\r\nOne thing is clear: we are the only ones who can do\r\nsomething about it. Considerable costs will be\r\ninvolved, and not just in funds. Some say that the\r\nindustrialized world must change its deeply ingrained\r\npatterns of energy consumption and make other\r\nadjustments. Others say that the developing world must\r\nswitch to more sustainable development approaches, at\r\na higher initial cost.\r\nCan the nations of the world afford the price tag\r\nof achieving all those things? The economic\r\nindications are that we can; it is a question of will,\r\ndetermination and perseverance. There is no lack of\r\nwealth in this world. By just about any measurement,\r\npeople in the industrialized world today enjoy a far\r\nhigher standard of living than has ever been known\r\nbefore. Many developing countries are not far behind.\r\nBut, when it comes to actually taking the steps\r\nnecessary to overcome the dilemmas I have mentioned,\r\nwe confront the real challenge: to determine the wisest\r\nallocation of our resources and to act accordingly, in\r\nthe spirit of the eight Millennium Development Goals.\r\nIt does not take a great deal of wisdom to\r\nconclude that mankind must continue to place high\r\npriority on the eradication of poverty and hunger.\r\nLikewise, the need for prudence in protecting our\r\nearthly environment and its resources is increasingly\r\nobvious. But allocating our resources properly,\r\nidentifying the correct timing, and acting so as to attain\r\nthose goals will require virtually every scientific,\r\neconomic, political and ethical capacity that we can\r\nsummon.\r\nThe process must involve an even-handed\r\napproach, without room for guilt, blame or jealousy.\r\nWhile there is a real need for action, there is no need\r\nfor panic. The planet can still be saved, and the social\r\nconditions for despair can be overcome. We must,\r\nhowever, all play our respective roles with\r\ncommitment, compassion and in accordance with an\r\nequitable division of responsibility. Let us put aside the\r\nfinger-pointing and the tyranny of self-interest, and let\r\nus set about the task.\r\nThere are several issues of concern to my country\r\nregarding which I would like, briefly, to be more\r\nspecific.\r\nFirst, Micronesia looks forward to the convening\r\nof the International Meeting, in January 2005 in\r\nMauritius, which will conduct the critical 10-year\r\nreview of the Barbados Programme of Action, focusing\r\non the particular needs and vulnerabilities of the small\r\nisland developing States as they pursue sustainable\r\ndevelopment. During the past 10 years, we have seen\r\nprogress in implementing the Programme of Action,\r\nwith the close involvement and support of the\r\nSecretariat. However, that progress needs to be\r\naccelerated. The International Meeting will enable us\r\nto identify and make essential course corrections.\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nNaturally, over the past 10 years, we have also seen the\r\nemergence of new challenges and issues that were not\r\noriginally addressed. Now these can also be\r\nconsidered. Overall, the outcomes of the International\r\nMeeting should be target-oriented so that progress in\r\nimplementing the Programme of Action can be tracked\r\nand measured.\r\nOf course, the International Meeting will be\r\nsuccessful only if the representatives of island States\r\nare able to attend. Micronesia thus calls upon the donor\r\ncommunity to provide generous support to the trust\r\nfund so that island States may be adequately\r\nrepresented at the Meeting. In that regard, I must\r\nacknowledge and express appreciation to those\r\ncountries that have already contributed. Developing-\r\ncountry partners and developed countries should also\r\nmake every effort to be represented at the highest\r\npossible political level to ensure that the International\r\nMeeting receives the political support it needs for the\r\neffective implementation of its outcomes.\r\nPerhaps foremost among the vulnerabilities of\r\nMicronesia — together with other members of the\r\nAlliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) — is our\r\nextreme exposure to the adverse effects of global\r\nclimate change. For more than a decade now, we have\r\nbeen vocal in this body and elsewhere on virtually\r\nevery aspect of climate change. One aspect of that\r\nissue is a source of increasing concern to me as the\r\ndebate evolves beyond whether climate change is real\r\nto what should be done about it, and that aspect has to\r\ndo with environmental ethics.\r\nIn Micronesia, as in most island States, our\r\npeople have a tradition of living in harmony with\r\nnature. Consequently, our ecological “footprint” has\r\nbeen small. While we who live on islands can and need\r\nto do more to curb unsustainable practices, it is clear\r\nthat we have contributed little to the climate crisis and\r\nthat we can contribute little to its solution. Yet we are\r\namong the first to be affected and even face possible\r\nextinction.\r\nFor the populations of low-lying small islands,\r\nhowever, practical options are few. Land is in short\r\nsupply on islands in the best of times, and that land has\r\nlong been taken. Contrary to the romantic fantasy,\r\nthere are no desert islands available; island populations\r\nalready tend to be concentrated. Previous efforts to\r\nrelocate island populations have brought suffering and\r\ncultural losses to the people concerned. To those of us\r\nfacing the prospect of cultural eradication, the\r\nunabated advancement of already-inflated lifestyles in\r\nthe industrialized world does not seem a “greater\r\ngood”. We continue to support the call of AOSIS for\r\nimmediate implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.\r\nExport and licensing income from the bounty of\r\nMicronesia’s waters and its vast exclusive economic\r\nzone is by far the greatest contribution to the nation’s\r\nbudget, next to foreign assistance. Fisheries are also a\r\nvital resource of virtually every Pacific island country.\r\nA cooperative approach on the part of coastal States\r\nand distant-water fishing nations in the sustainable\r\nconservation and management of those resources is\r\nessential, since we now know that they are not\r\ninexhaustible.\r\nThus, Micronesia welcomes the entry into force\r\nof the Convention on the Conservation and\r\nManagement of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the\r\nCentral and Western Pacific Ocean, established\r\npursuant to the United Nations Convention on the Law\r\nof the Sea. We call upon all States and entities that\r\nhave participated in the process of establishing the\r\nConservation and Management Convention to assign\r\nhigh priority to cooperating fully in the implementation\r\nof its provisions.\r\nI would like to put on record my country’s\r\ngrowing concern over the practice of deep-sea\r\ntrawling. The region of the Pacific contains literally\r\nthousands of seamounts, which scientists are finding to\r\nbe extremely rich in biodiversity and which hold great\r\npotential value for future generations. Yet, short-\r\nsightedly, too many are dragging trawl nets over these\r\ndeep-ocean areas, unknowing and uncaring as to the\r\ndamage they are causing to the seabed below.\r\nThere is an urgent need for an improved and\r\ncoordinated scientific focus on identifying and\r\nmanaging risk to biodiversity and the environment in\r\nthe deep oceans. We need to broaden our presently\r\ninadequate knowledge about these unique ocean\r\nhabitats and ensure that they are managed in a\r\nsustainable way. Meanwhile, given the risk posed by\r\npresent practices, we urge the international community\r\nto impose and observe a moratorium on deep sea\r\ntrawling.\r\nDespite the extension in 2001 of the time frame\r\nset by the parties to the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea for a delimitation of the continental\r\nshelf, Micronesia and many small island developing\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nStates face continuing difficulties in meeting our\r\nobligations in this regard. The problem is a lack of\r\nfinancial resources and the scientific and technical\r\nexpertise needed to acquire and collate the highly\r\ncomplex scientific data. Without targeted assistance\r\nfrom the donor community, countries like Micronesia\r\nwill find it extremely difficult to make the required\r\nsubmission on the limits of the continental shelf, even\r\nwithin the extended time frame.\r\nAs neighbours and fellow islanders, we are\r\nsaddened by the inability of the people of the Republic\r\nof the Marshall Islands, after almost 50 years, to secure\r\nfull compensation for the death, sickness and\r\ndestruction they suffered as a consequence of nuclear\r\nweapons testing. Recently declassified documents\r\nmake it clear that the original settlements were not\r\nbased on the full story of what happened to the\r\nMarshallese people as well as other peoples of the\r\nformer Trust Territory. We join other Members in\r\ncalling upon the United States to meet its responsibility\r\nin full.\r\nThis year, Micronesia wishes to again express its\r\nsupport for United Nations reforms, particularly for the\r\nreform of the Security Council and the inclusion of our\r\nneighbour, Japan, among its permanent members. We\r\nare increasingly concerned over the seeming lack of\r\nprogress on this critical matter.\r\nMy final topic is security in the region of the\r\nPacific. Our President shared with leaders at the\r\nrecently-concluded annual meeting of the Pacific\r\nIslands Forum in Apia, Samoa, a common concern that\r\namidst all the current attention to global security\r\nissues, the nations of the Pacific islands are being left\r\nlargely to their own devices in dealing with threats\r\nrelated to organized crime and terrorism. We are\r\nworking hard to address our vulnerabilities in these\r\nareas, but I would like to simply note here that the rest\r\nof the world, especially the North, is not serving its\r\nown best interests by giving short shrift to the\r\npossibilities for criminal and terrorist exploitation that\r\nare presented by our vast region. Over and above other\r\ntraditional official development assistance, we need a\r\nrange of targeted assistance in our region.\r\nOnce again, it has been our most valued\r\nopportunity to appear and address the General\r\nAssembly. The need for this Organization has never\r\nbeen stronger, and as each year goes by, it seems that\r\nthe significance and relevance of our Charter increases.\r\nIn these difficult times, we in Micronesia choose not to\r\nlose heart, but rather to take heart that we, the nations\r\nof the world gathered here, can together build not just a\r\nbetter world, but one that is a worthy inheritance for\r\nfuture generations.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Nagoum Yamassoum,\r\nMinister of State, Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nAfrican Integration of the Republic of Chad.\r\nMr. Yamassoum (Chad) (spoke in French): First\r\nof all, on behalf of the members of my delegation and\r\non my own behalf, I would like to congratulate you,\r\nSir, upon your election to the presidency of our\r\nAssembly. Your election is a great tribute to both our\r\nsubregion in Central Africa and to your country, the\r\nGabonese Republic. It is also a sign of recognition of\r\nyour abilities as a statesman and a guarantee of our\r\nwork’s success. My thanks and my congratulations also\r\ngo to your predecessor and his team for their\r\ndedication and the enthusiasm with which they did a\r\ngreat deal of work — which was much appreciated by\r\nall — in a particularly tense environment marked by\r\nanimated debates about the Iraqi crisis.\r\nFinally, I would like to pay a particular well-\r\ndeserved tribute to the Secretary-General of our\r\nOrganization, our brother Kofi Annan, whose\r\ncommitment and unceasing efforts to establish lasting\r\npeace and sustainable development in the world are\r\npraiseworthy. He can count on Chad’s support for all of\r\nthe initiatives that he is still undertaking with courage\r\nand tenacity, particularly in dealing with the problems\r\nand conflicts in Africa, initiatives through which he is\r\nthus contributing to restoring our Organization’s\r\ncredibility.\r\nA year ago, when we addressed this Assembly\r\nand reiterated our commitment to defend the great\r\ncauses of mankind, we took that opportunity to\r\ncondemn terrorism and all forms of blind violence and\r\nintolerance that could lead our world astray. We\r\nrecalled at the time that our States needed to apply the\r\nUnited Nations Charter in reacting to terrorist acts —\r\nor acts considered as terrorist — that constitute a threat\r\nto international peace and security. We reiterate those\r\nappeals, and call again on the sense of responsibility of\r\nour States to act together to curb by all possible means\r\nthe major scourges that are such a dangerous threat to\r\nall mankind, physically as well as socio-economically.\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nWith respect to combating terrorism, the\r\nGovernment of Chad, for its part, is actively\r\ncooperating with the appropriate institutions of the\r\nUnited Nations, under Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001), in order to strengthen its national\r\ncapacity to prevent and combat this scourge.\r\nThe past year for Chad, as for many African\r\ncountries, was a year of serious concerns regarding the\r\narmed conflicts raging everywhere — conflicts that\r\ntook peaceful populations hostage, destabilized our\r\nStates and continued to jeopardize the joint efforts\r\nbeing made to establish democratic institutions and\r\npromote socio-economic progress.\r\nLet us say, however, that the accomplishments\r\nunder the agenda that led to the re-election of the\r\nPresident of Chad, His Excellency Idriss Deby, for a\r\nsecond term are progressing at a reasonable rate in\r\nspite of various difficulties. This agenda, which is\r\nperfectly in line with the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, seeks to create, through good governance,\r\nconditions that are conducive to the strengthening of\r\npeace and stability in the country so that we can\r\npromote education and health for all social strata,\r\nemployment — particularly for the youth and\r\nwomen — and true synergy among the different forces\r\nand competencies arising from the various national\r\nentities. This must be done so that we can do an\r\neffective job in combating poverty and the great\r\npandemics, such as HIV/AIDS and malaria. I recall\r\nhere that this agenda, in which the fight against\r\nilliteracy and ignorance is written in capital letters, is\r\nbased on the most important principles: peace, security\r\nand justice. Without these, it will not be possible to\r\nbuild a society in which universal values such as\r\ndemocracy and the respect for human rights are\r\nensured.\r\nIn addition, the task of adapting our legislation to\r\nnational and international realities was imposed on our\r\nnational representation meeting, which made a\r\ncommitment on 26 May 2004, to a procedure aimed at\r\namending some provisions of the Fundamental Law\r\nadopted by referendum on 31 March 1996. This\r\nprocedure, which will harmonize the Constitution with\r\nthe requirements of democracy and fundamental\r\nfreedoms, is in keeping with the final provisions of the\r\nConstitution, which itself authorizes the revision.\r\nIn this context of globalizing economies, in\r\nwhich the rules of the game are constantly being\r\nsubverted, in particular by the practice of the largest\r\nStates of subsidizing their own agricultural products to\r\nthe detriment of the poorer countries, all efforts to\r\nresolve these developmental problems have been\r\ninconclusive. Even a strict application by our States of\r\nstructural adjustment measures is still seriously\r\nthreatened by the double weight of foreign debt and the\r\ncomplexity of social problems. Those issues make it\r\npractically impossible to take action to stimulate\r\neconomic growth in the developing countries.\r\nWith the exception of oil resources, we are\r\nwitnessing an ongoing decline in export earnings due\r\nto fluctuating commodity prices on international\r\nmarkets, and losses, caused principally by the policy of\r\nproviding subsidies, continue to grow; yet States have\r\nbeen slow to help the least developed countries by\r\nmeeting the commitments they made at successive\r\ndevelopment conferences.\r\nHere, let me speak of the cotton initiative, whose\r\npurpose is to obtain compensation for harm caused by\r\nsubsidies that have been detrimental to the economies\r\nof cotton-producing African countries. It is\r\nincreasingly urgent to ensure respect for the laws of\r\ncompetition, which the States seen as the principal\r\ninitiators and defenders of free markets now seem to be\r\ndisregarding.\r\nAs if that were not enough, in addition to the\r\ninherent difficulties of the international economic\r\nenvironment, those very farmers are today confronting\r\na threat of an entirely different scope: the invasions of\r\nlocusts. This raises the spectre of famine throughout\r\nthe Sahelo-Saharan countries. Chad is in a natural\r\nreproductive zone for locusts and is also considered a\r\ncorridor for locust swarm migration.\r\nThe situation is of even greater concern because,\r\nin addition to the other difficulties, the areas exposed\r\nto locust invasion are the ones that are protecting the\r\nSudanese refugees. Our countries have taken the\r\nappropriate measures, thanks to the assistance of our\r\npartners; we have thus been able to deal with the\r\nprogress of the first locust swarms. However, the threat\r\nhas not disappeared.\r\nAt the risk of having to manage a humanitarian\r\ncrisis that could result from the destruction of food\r\ncrops by the locusts, we must mobilize financial\r\nresources and the necessary technical and logistical\r\nmeans while we still have the time, in order to curb the\r\nscourge. We thank the countries and international\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\norganizations that have helped my country, and I take\r\nthis opportunity to reiterate my Government’s appeal to\r\nthe international community for vigorous action\r\nagainst the threat of locusts. Responses to the appeal\r\nwill help us set up appropriate structures for preventive\r\naction.\r\nWhile speaking of natural disasters, I must\r\nmention the consequences of tropical depressions that\r\nare doing a great deal of damage and that have, in the\r\npast few weeks, claimed thousands of victims among\r\nthe populations of the Caribbean islands. We express\r\nour sympathy to those populations, and I would ask the\r\nwealthy nations to provide the needed assistance to\r\nhelp them recover from the disaster.\r\nIn addition to natural disasters, armed conflicts\r\ntoo play a part in exacerbating the social crises from\r\nwhich our people are suffering. In 2004, my country\r\nand the United Nations have engaged in intensive\r\ndiplomatic activity related, inter alia, to the\r\nhumanitarian and security situation along the border\r\nbetween Chad and the Sudan. That situation, which is\r\nthe result of a conflict between the rebels of Darfur,\r\nand the central Government in Khartoum, is of serious\r\nconcern to my Government. The scope of the hostilities\r\nand the violent excesses perpetrated against civilian\r\npopulations by the various parties to the conflict, have\r\nprovoked massive and continuous flows of Sudanese\r\nrefugees to the eastern and north-eastern regions of\r\nChad. That flow has consequences for our people and\r\nfor the environment, whose ecosystems were already in\r\na precarious state of fragility caused by the aridity of\r\nthe soil and the climate.\r\nThe President of the Republic of Chad quickly\r\nunderstood the consequences of the conflict and made\r\na commitment to help our brothers in the Sudan find a\r\npeaceful solution, by offering to mediate between the\r\nparties. He personally initiated the inter-Sudanese\r\nnegotiations on the Darfur conflict, with the signature\r\nof the Abeche Agreement on 3 September 2003. That\r\nprocess was followed by the 8 April 2004 N’Djamena\r\nagreement on a humanitarian ceasefire, and the\r\n25 April agreement on a joint commission; these will\r\nprovide a framework for negotiations on a final and\r\ncomprehensive settlement of the conflict.\r\nIn other words, we could not remain indifferent to\r\nthe tragedy that the people in Darfur were\r\nexperiencing. It is our duty, more than any other\r\ncountry, to help our brothers in the Sudan to reconcile.\r\nWe have spared no effort to help President Omer\r\nHassan A. Al-Bashir and his Government, while\r\nrespecting the sovereignty of their country, to resolve\r\nthe Darfur conflict.\r\nThus, we took the risk of exposing ourselves to\r\ncriticism from the rebel movements, which accused us\r\nof favouritism, as well as the discontent of the Chadian\r\npeople related to the people of Darfur. This clearly\r\ncontradicts the widespread disinformation claiming\r\nthat the Government of Chad might have supported\r\nsome kind of rebellion against the legitimate\r\nauthorities of the Sudan, with which our country has\r\nclose ties of friendship and cooperation in all areas. We\r\nwill never stop fulfilling our mission to mediate\r\nalongside the African Union to urge our Sudanese\r\nbrothers to renounce war once and for all and to\r\npromote sincere dialogue in order to resolve the\r\nconflict.\r\nIn spite of the recent uncertainties due to the\r\nhardening of positions, we place our hope in the Abuja\r\ntalks under the auspices of His Excellency President\r\nOlusegun Obasanjo of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,\r\ncurrent Chairman of the African Union. We believe\r\nthat the adoption of Security Council resolution 1564\r\n(2004), whose full implementation by the Government\r\nof the Sudan is expected in order to facilitate\r\nconditions conducive to the return of populations to\r\ntheir homes, will be followed by complementary\r\nmeasures aimed at convincing the other parties to the\r\nDarfur crisis to take a constructive approach at the\r\nnegotiating table. We hope that the international\r\ncommunity will be firm with all sides in order to\r\npromote a successful conclusion of the process of a\r\npolitical settlement of the Darfur crisis.\r\nThroughout the terrible times the populations\r\nalong the border of Chad and the Sudan have endured,\r\ninternational solidarity has been evident. I must\r\nexpress the appreciation of the Government of the\r\nRepublic of Chad for the many forms of assistance we\r\nhave received from the international community, which\r\nhas allowed us to help the refugees.\r\nI would also like to call upon States and\r\norganizations represented here to convey to the\r\nappropriate authorities in their countries and\r\norganizations an appeal to continue or renew\r\nhumanitarian assistance to the refugees, whether from\r\nsouthern Sudan or southern Central Africa, whom we\r\nare sheltering in the south of our country.\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nI would also like to ask the international\r\ncommunity to help the populations of the host regions\r\nnot only to provide shelter for the refugees but also to\r\nmake possible the reconstruction of their\r\nsocioeconomic structures that have been affected by\r\nthe unexpected flow of refugees. The flow of refugees\r\nand their prolonged stay in Chad would — if we are\r\nnot careful — have consequences which might be\r\ndangerous to the security of my country.\r\nHaving agreed to abide by the international\r\ncommitments it has freely entered into, Chad is\r\nreceiving the refugees and looking out for their safety.\r\nIn the long term, the international support that my\r\ncountry enjoys should focus on promoting the\r\nvoluntary return, within a short and reasonable time, of\r\nrefugees to their countries of origin. International\r\nassistance to refugees must therefore be designed and\r\nconducted so as not to perpetuate the presence of the\r\nrefugees in Chad.\r\nWhile we are working together with the\r\ninternational community to ease the pain of the\r\nrefugees on our soil, we say frankly that we can in no\r\nway tolerate Chad being used as a base for subversive\r\nactions, for acts of terrorism or for the conduct of\r\nhostile or destabilizing actions against the institutions\r\nof the refugees’ countries of origin. Thus, the\r\nGovernment of Chad will act, with all the unambiguity\r\nreflected in its current position, against refugees who\r\nbecome involved in such activities.\r\nThe gravity of the humanitarian and security\r\nsituation born of the crisis that is raging in Darfur has\r\nnot deflected my country’s attention from other similar\r\nconcerns on the continent. We are following attentively\r\nand with great interest the evolution of other conflicts\r\nthat are taking place in Africa and in other parts of the\r\nworld. We are pleased to see the efforts being made\r\nwithin the African Union and the United Nations to\r\nfind lasting solutions; we are available to help as best\r\nwe can. Therefore, the Government of Chad has\r\ndecided to respond to the needs outlined by the\r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations by making\r\navailable to the United Nations a contingent of 150\r\nqualified men.\r\nOn this solemn occasion, how could we fail to\r\nrecall the unjust and undemocratic situation that\r\ncharacterizes the structures of our Organization? I\r\nwould like to say firmly that my country remains\r\ncommitted to the common African position regarding\r\nthe restructuring of the United Nations, including the\r\nenlargement and reform of the Security Council in\r\norder to ensure equitable representation of all regions.\r\nAll the initiatives taken by Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan regarding United Nations reform are much\r\nappreciated by my country, which awaits with interest\r\nthe outcome of the deliberations under way. The\r\nobjective is the revitalization of the United Nations.\r\nAll suggestions should help us to improve the\r\nperformance of the principal organs and the\r\nfunctioning of present and future funds and\r\nprogrammes.\r\nTo that end, my country would expect account to\r\nbe taken of the concerns and viewpoints of Member\r\nStates and groups of States that have been reiterated on\r\nmany occasions in the Assembly. Chad awaits with\r\nequal interest the outcome of the study on\r\nglobalization: the current characteristics and direction\r\nof globalization by no means enable weaker or\r\ntransitional economies to benefit fully from the\r\nopportunities it offers.\r\nAnother injustice should be pointed out. I must\r\ndraw the Assembly’s attention to the question of the\r\nexclusion from our ranks of a large community of the\r\n23 million men and women of the Republic of China\r\non Taiwan. Those men and women, who increasingly\r\nare asserting themselves in international trade and are\r\ngenerating wealth throughout the world, deserve to be\r\nfully associated in decision-making on subjects and in\r\nareas with an impact on their lives and those of all\r\nhumankind. The United Nations would have everything\r\nto gain and nothing to lose with their active\r\nparticipation in debates on the many topics of\r\ninternational concern. Their contribution would\r\nundoubtedly enrich the Assembly debates and would\r\nhelp us build the operational capacity of our world\r\ninstitutions, funds and programmes.\r\nThe distressing legacy of armed conflicts\r\nincludes buried caches of abandoned munitions and\r\nunexploded ordnance and, in particular, anti-personnel\r\nmines. Referring to the danger of landmines, the\r\nSecretary-General has said that these abominable\r\nweapons, buried by the millions, are not only waiting\r\nsilently to kill or maim innocent children and women,\r\nbut their presence — or even the threat of the presence\r\nof one single landmine — can put a stop to crop\r\ncultivation, deprive an entire village of its livelihood\r\nand thus place one more obstacle along the difficult\r\npath to reconstruction and development. Chad is\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nactively participating in the preparations for the Ottawa\r\nConvention review conference soon to be held in\r\nNairobi and will continue to act to eliminate all of\r\nthese arms so as to attain the objective of an Earth\r\nwithout mines.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank,\r\nwithout exception, all the States and all the\r\nintergovernmental and non-governmental institutions\r\nthat have helped us establish and implement our\r\nhumanitarian demining programmes. We ask them for\r\ntheir continued generosity, and we ask them to extend\r\ntheir assistance to survivors among the victims of\r\nlandmines, to help design and implement programmes\r\nenabling these individuals to be reintegrated socially\r\nand professionally. I appeal to all United Nations\r\nMember States to join in this humanitarian undertaking\r\nby acceding to the Ottawa Convention banning anti-\r\npersonnel landmines.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Vall Ould Bellal,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of\r\nMauritania.\r\nMr. Ould Bellal (Mauritania) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nam pleased, Sir, to congratulate you and your friendly\r\ncountry, Gabon, on your well-deserved election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession. We remain convinced that your great skills and\r\nrich experience guarantee the success of our work. I\r\nwould also like to thank your predecessor, Mr. Julian\r\nHunte, who so ably guided the work of the previous\r\nsession. I should like also to express my sincere\r\ncongratulations to Secretary-General Kofi Annan and\r\nto his entire team, on the immense efforts they have\r\nexerted to achieve the noble ideals of our Organization.\r\nAllow me to express our deep satisfaction at the\r\nactivities undertaken since the last Assembly session,\r\nnotably the high-level segment of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, held in New York in June, on the theme\r\nof “Resources mobilization and enabling environment\r\nfor poverty eradication in the context of the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action for the\r\nLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010”.\r\nMy country had the privilege of hosting the\r\npreparatory meeting for our subregion last April,\r\nbringing together government sectors and international\r\npartners, as well as regional civil society organizations.\r\nWe hail the efforts to define priorities and the\r\nmeasures needed to implement the recommendations of\r\nthe Monterrey Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, the decisions taken at the Johannesburg\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development and the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. I should note here\r\nthat those Goals will be reached only if the Group of\r\nEight and the other industrialized countries pursue\r\ntheir joint efforts to provide greater support and\r\nassistance to developing countries. In this regard, I\r\nwould also like to reaffirm my country’s support for\r\nthe New York Declaration on the Action Against\r\nHunger and Poverty.\r\nThe achievement of the Development Goals and\r\nensuring security and stability are closely linked to\r\nhow we address the problem of violence and terrorism.\r\nTerrorism is a global problem, and its solution must\r\nalso be global. The fight must be based on an\r\nintellectual and cultural vision of the complementarity\r\nof civilizations and on an absolute rejection of\r\nconfrontation between countries.\r\nIt is important also to note the unjust disparity in\r\nthe level of development between rich and poor\r\ncountries, because poverty and social, scientific,\r\ntechnological underdevelopment are among the main\r\ncauses of tension, violence and extremism. The growth\r\nof terrorism, and its resulting fear and destruction,\r\nobliges the international community to engage in closer\r\ndialogue, increased coordination and a concerted effort\r\nto face the dangers that threaten all humankind.\r\nMy country, Mauritania, firmly condemns\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including\r\nthe taking and killing of hostages, and we reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to combat that phenomenon, which is\r\nalien to our society and to our sacred Islamic values,\r\nwhich reject violence and extremism and which call for\r\ndialogue, understanding, tolerance and the acceptance\r\nof others.\r\nIt is clear that the repeated failure of the\r\ninternational community to fulfil its commitments with\r\nregard to the establishment of a comprehensive, just\r\nand lasting peace in the Middle East and the\r\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State\r\nliving side by side with Israel, remains the main cause\r\nof insecurity and instability in the region and of the\r\ngrowth of the extremism and violence from which we\r\nall are suffering.\r\nThat is why it is high time that the international\r\ncommunity — represented by the Security Council, the\r\nGeneral Assembly and all relevant regional and\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\ninternational actors, including the Quartet — work\r\ntogether to bring about peace and stability in the\r\nMiddle East, which, together with the rest of the world,\r\nhas suffered for so long from the destructive effects of\r\nwar.\r\nIt is high time that we implement the Arab peace\r\ninitiative, under which the Arab States guarantee\r\ncomprehensive peace and the promise of normal\r\nrelations to Israel in exchange for a complete\r\nwithdrawal from all Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese\r\nterritories up to the borders of 4 June 1967, the\r\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State, with\r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital, and a just, consensual\r\nresolution of the refugee issue. Clearly, there is no way\r\nto achieve that noble goal except to carry out the peace\r\nprocess and to resume the negotiations on all tracks, in\r\nkeeping with the Madrid terms of reference, the\r\nprinciple of land for peace, the road map and the\r\nrelevant provisions of international law.\r\nWe are following with interest the development\r\nof the situation in Iraq, and we reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to the unity, territorial integrity,\r\nsovereignty and independence of Iraq and to non-\r\ninterference in its internal affairs. My country also\r\nreaffirms its support for the brotherly Iraqi people, its\r\nInterim National Council and its Interim Government\r\nin their efforts to overcome the difficulties hampering\r\ntheir aspirations to security, stability and the\r\nestablishment of State institutions.\r\nWe are also following with interest the\r\ndevelopment of the situation in Darfur. We welcome\r\nthe commendable efforts of the Sudanese Government,\r\nin cooperation with the African Union, the League of\r\nArab States and the United Nations, with a view to\r\nresolving the humanitarian, security and political\r\naspects of the crisis. We call upon all regional and\r\ninternational actors to support those efforts and to\r\naccord to the Sudanese Government the time it needs\r\nto honour its commitments without threats of armed\r\nintervention, the imposition of sanctions or any\r\ntendentious propaganda aimed at giving the Darfur\r\nproblem an ethnic or sectarian dimension. In that\r\nregard, I welcome the positive results achieved\r\nfollowing the peace negotiations held at Abuja and\r\nN’Djamena, sponsored by the African Union. I\r\nencourage all the parties to continue the dialogue and\r\nthe negotiation process, since that is the only way to\r\nresolve the crisis.\r\nI now turn to Western Sahara. Mauritania\r\nsupports the efforts undertaken by the United Nations\r\nand its Secretary-General to arrive at a definitive\r\nsettlement that brings stability to the region and enjoys\r\nthe agreement of all the parties.\r\nMy country is strongly committed to contributing\r\nto relations of cooperation and solidarity within the\r\nframework of our integrated regional affiliations. We\r\nare deeply convinced of the need for the Arab Maghreb\r\nUnion, which remains an indispensable strategic option\r\nand an ambitious project aimed at enabling the peoples\r\nof the region to achieve greater complementarity and\r\nsolidarity. My country seeks to deepen dialogue,\r\nunderstanding and cultural contacts among\r\ncivilizations through the five-plus-five approach and\r\nthe Barcelona approach.\r\nAt the level of the African continent, we\r\ncommend the solidarity and complementarity within\r\nthe framework of the organization on the use of the\r\nSenegal River and the brotherly and friendly bilateral\r\nrelations with West African countries. My country also\r\nwelcomes the decisions taken recently by the\r\ninstitutions and organs of the African Union,\r\nparticularly the formation of an African Parliament and\r\na Peace and Security Council, which will constitute a\r\nframework that will enable us to transcend all current\r\ndifficulties.\r\nAt the international level, Mauritania reaffirms its\r\nsupport for the People’s Republic of China as the sole\r\nand legal representative of the Chinese people. In that\r\nregard, we appreciate the efforts of the Chinese\r\nGovernment aimed at achieving its reunification by\r\npeaceful means.\r\nMy country has the honour to preside over the\r\ncurrent session of the League of Arab States at the\r\nlevel of Ministers for Foreign Affairs. I should like to\r\nstress that the Arab Summit reaffirmed at Tunis the\r\nresolve of all Arab States to pursue the reform process\r\nby deepening democracy, expanding political\r\nparticipation and promoting respect for human rights,\r\nthe advancement of women and the understanding that\r\nsuch reform must be progressive, gradual and adapted\r\nto social and cultural traditions specific to the States of\r\nthe region, not imposed from outside.\r\nMauritania is pursuing its efforts in that direction\r\nunder the leadership of the President of the Republic,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Maaouya Ould Sid’Ahmed Taya,\r\nand continues to work to establish the rule of law, good\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\ngovernance and pluralistic democracy that promotes\r\nhuman rights, freedom of expression, and personal and\r\ngeneral freedoms.\r\nAt the socio-economic level, we have adopted\r\nsignificant new laws, such as those dealing with labour\r\nand trafficking in persons and the introduction of broad\r\nreforms that would enable us to make progress in\r\nmodernizing public administration to improve its\r\nperformance, liberalizing private enterprise, promoting\r\ninvestment and providing basic services for our\r\ncitizens, such as education, health and potable water.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations reflects the\r\ncommon aspiration of the world’s peoples to attain\r\ntheir fundamental development objectives and to\r\nensure international peace and security. Clearly, the\r\nsweeping changes now taking place in the international\r\narena call for the reform of United Nations structures\r\nwith a view to expanding representation on the\r\nSecurity Council, thereby opening it up to key regions,\r\nsuch as Africa and Latin America, as well as\r\nsignificant groups, such as the Group of Arab States,\r\nand important industrialized countries that provide\r\nsubstantial contributions to the Organization, such as\r\nGermany and Japan, in order to respond to the new\r\nchanges taking place and to enable the Council, thus\r\nrestructured, to better reflect the realities and diversity\r\nof today’s world.\r\nWe sincerely hope to see the international\r\ncommunity work together to consolidate international\r\nsolidarity in order to establish a new, just and more\r\nequitable world order that safeguards peace and\r\nsecurity and provides a life of freedom and dignity for\r\neveryone.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ali Said Abdella, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Eritrea.\r\nMr. Abdella (Eritrea) (spoke in Arabic): Allow\r\nme at the outset to join previous speakers in\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President\r\nof the General Assembly at its current session. In light\r\nof the restraints on our time, I shall omit several\r\nacknowledgements and tributes that I should have liked\r\nto make and delve directly into matters of vital\r\nimportance to my country, to the region of the Horn of\r\nAfrica and, by extension, to all Member States of our\r\nglobal community.\r\nMy Government, of course, recognizes and is\r\ngrateful for the vital contributions of the international\r\ncommunity, including the United Nations, to promote\r\npeace in the aftermath of the war that Ethiopia declared\r\nagainst my country, using a place called Badme as a\r\npretext for invasion.\r\nThe Algiers Peace Agreement, signed by the two\r\nparties in December 2000, was drafted and brokered by\r\nthe United States, the European Union, the African\r\nUnion and Algeria, among others. Furthermore, the\r\ninternational community has spent more than $700\r\nmillion to date to maintain the peacekeeping force.\r\nMore than 37 countries have contributed military\r\npersonnel, which are involved in UNMEE in various\r\ncapacities. We are indeed grateful for those\r\ncontributions.\r\nBut, while we applaud those valuable\r\ncontributions, we are duty-bound to express, with equal\r\ncandour, our regret and dismay at the lack of resolute\r\naction by the international community at this critical\r\ntime, when the entire process is on the brink of\r\ncollapse. Had the international community respected its\r\nobligations and seen the process through with the\r\nrequisite seriousness, the border would have been\r\ndemarcated long ago. Today could have been an\r\nauspicious moment for our peoples to celebrate, from\r\nthis rostrum, the resounding success of the United\r\nNations peacekeeping effort. Instead, the dark clouds\r\nof war are once again gathering over my country\r\nbecause of Ethiopia’s intransigence and the\r\nacquiescence of major Powers as concerns Ethiopia’s\r\nviolations of international law.\r\nAllow me to recall some of the most salient tenets\r\nof the Algiers Peace Agreement (A/55/686, annex).\r\nFirst, regarding the establishment and powers of\r\nthe Arbitration Commission, article 4.2 of the\r\nAgreement states:\r\n“The parties agree that a neutral Boundary\r\nCommission composed of five members shall be\r\nestablished with a mandate to delimit and\r\ndemarcate the colonial treaty boundary based on\r\npertinent colonial treaties (1900, 1902 and 1908)\r\nand applicable international law. The\r\nCommission shall not have the power to make\r\ndecisions ex aequo et bono.”\r\nSecondly, as concerns the final and binding\r\nnature of the decision, article 4.15 states:\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\n“The parties agree that the delimitation and\r\ndemarcation determinations of the Commission\r\nshall be final and binding. Each party shall\r\nrespect the border so determined, as well as the\r\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty of the other\r\nparty.”\r\nThirdly, regarding punitive measures that should\r\nbe taken against the violating party, paragraph 14 of\r\nthe Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (S/2000/601,\r\nannex) states:\r\n“[The] OAU and the United Nations commit\r\nthemselves to guarantee the respect for this\r\ncommitment of the two parties until the\r\ndetermination of the common border … This\r\nguarantee shall be comprised of\r\na) Measures to be taken by the\r\ninternational community should one or both\r\nof the parties violate this commitment,\r\nincluding appropriate measures to be taken\r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations by the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council.”\r\nIt has been more than two years now since the\r\nBoundary Commission announced its decision on the\r\nbasis of the Algiers Peace Agreement. That legal\r\ndecision was reached after 15 months of litigation,\r\nfollowing the exchange of numerous memorandums\r\nand a two-week verbal hearing. The decision is final\r\nand binding in accordance with the aforementioned\r\nPeace Agreement. Furthermore, the decision is based\r\non the fundamental African principle of the\r\ninviolability of inherited colonial boundaries, which\r\nare not of our making but which we can only respect\r\nunless we wish to open the Pandora’s box of an endless\r\ncycle of bloody border conflicts.\r\nMy Government has accepted in good faith the\r\nBoundary Commission’s decision, not because it has\r\nwon in the litigation, but because we firmly believe\r\nthat the only way to secure an enduring peace is\r\nthrough respect of the rule of law and the integrity of\r\nthe arbitration decision. That is why my Government\r\nhas been cooperating, and continues to cooperate, fully\r\nand unreservedly with the Boundary Commission in all\r\nits delimitation decisions and demarcation instructions.\r\nEthiopia, on the other hand, has categorically\r\nrejected the decision of the Boundary Commission. In\r\na letter to the Security Council on 19 September last\r\nyear, the Ethiopian Prime Minister declared that the\r\nwork of the Commission was “in terminal crisis”. The\r\nPrime Minister dismissed the decision of the Boundary\r\nCommission as totally illegal, unjust and irresponsible,\r\nand requested the Security Council to set up an\r\nalternative mechanism to demarcate the contested parts\r\nof the boundary.\r\nEthiopia, of course, has no reason whatsoever to\r\nreject the Boundary Commission decision. Apart from\r\nits treaty obligations, the fact is that Ethiopia has won,\r\nby its own admission, extra territories that never\r\nbelonged to it. Those were the words of the Prime\r\nMinister, the Foreign Minister and the Council of\r\nMinisters on 13 April 2002, when the Boundary\r\nCommission announced its decision.\r\nEthiopia’s belated and calculated rejection of the\r\ndecision was an afterthought. It was tentative and\r\ncautious at first, but gained boldness and audacity\r\nwhen it realized that it could do so with impunity. The\r\nPrime Minister’s letter informing the Security Council\r\nthat Ethiopia totally rejected the decision of the\r\nBoundary Commission was written 16 full months after\r\nthe decision was rendered. In a sense, Ethiopia’s\r\nrejection has more to do with the conduct of the\r\ninternational community rather than any intrinsic\r\nproblem of the decision itself.\r\nCritical and encouraging factors in Ethiopia’s\r\nrejection were the sympathetic dispositions towards it\r\nand the “winks and nods” of certain countries and\r\nsome foreign missions in Ethiopia.\r\nEthiopia’s current arguments and excuses on the\r\nneed to factor in human and physical geography and\r\nbogus concerns as to population dislocation or\r\nseparation of villages and homes are so fallacious as to\r\nnot even merit discussion. The legal basis for\r\ndelimiting the boundary is unequivocal, and Ethiopia\r\ncannot inject new elements after the fact. Furthermore,\r\nboundaries in Africa, and for that matter elsewhere in\r\nthe world, are not always carved out of natural rivers\r\nand ravines to exclude contiguous villages lying on\r\neither side of the boundary between two countries.\r\nIn the case of the Eritrea-Ethiopia boundary, in\r\n1998 Ethiopia expelled 14,500 Eritreans who had\r\ninhabited 39 villages on the eastern part of the Badme\r\nline since the 1920s. Those people have spent the last\r\nseveral years in makeshift camps in western Eritrea.\r\nAn additional 58,000 Eritreans remain displaced\r\nbecause Ethiopia continues to occupy our sovereign\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nterritories. All in all, more than 90,000 Eritreans, and\r\nEthiopians of Eritrean origin, were expelled from\r\nEthiopia in 1998 because the Ethiopian Prime Minister\r\ndeclared that “Ethiopia has every right to expel any\r\nforeign citizen if it does not like the colour of their\r\neyes”. How can Ethiopia now invoke the possible\r\ndislocation of a few thousand settlers to prevent\r\ndemarcation of the boundary and jeopardize regional\r\npeace?\r\nIn spite of Ethiopia’s violations of the Peace\r\nAgreements, major Powers within the international\r\ncommunity have not taken critical steps to persuade\r\nEthiopia to uphold the rule of law and abide by its\r\ntreaty obligations. On the contrary, Ethiopia is\r\ncontinuing to obtain massive humanitarian, economic\r\nand military support from major Powers. Full-fledged\r\neconomic sanctions may not have been necessary, but\r\nthe debt cancellation, budgetary support and other\r\nsubstantial injections of economic and humanitarian\r\nassistance extended to Ethiopia have not been linked to\r\na positive performance in the peace process. As far as\r\nEritrea is concerned, therefore, the problem is not\r\nEthiopia’s bad-faith conduct in the border dispute, but\r\ninternational silence and acquiescence with regard to\r\nits violations, which has, in turn, encouraged its\r\nintransigence.\r\nIt is regrettable that the United Nations\r\nSecretariat and some Powers have introduced — and\r\ncontinue to dwell on — tangential issues, instead of\r\ntaking concrete action to push the peace process\r\nforward. Such notions are not only extraneous to the\r\nAlgiers Peace Agreement, but, if they were to become\r\noperational, would actually subvert and derail the\r\npeace process and significantly contribute to tension\r\nand conflict. Here, I am referring to the related issues\r\nof the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General and the\r\n“dialogue” to renegotiate the final and binding decision\r\nof the Boundary Commission.\r\nI would like to stress that the appointment of the\r\nSpecial Envoy occurred only a few weeks after\r\nEthiopia had formally and officially rejected the\r\nBoundary Commission decision requesting the Security\r\nCouncil to create a new mechanism. While my\r\nGovernment did not see any benefit or rationale for\r\nthat course of action, it did not reject the proposal\r\noutright. We sought unambiguous clarifications with\r\nregard to the mandate and functions of the Special\r\nEnvoy through various communications, emphasizing\r\nthat we could not possibly contemplate renegotiation of\r\nthe decision in any form. Unfortunately, our efforts did\r\nnot bear fruit, and the lack of clarity of the responses\r\nwe received only reinforced our original suspicions.\r\nMy Government has therefore informed the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that it considers that the issue of the Special\r\nEnvoy — which has eclipsed the key issue for almost a\r\nyear now — to be a closed chapter and appealed to the\r\nSecretary-General to refocus international attention on\r\nEthiopia’s violations of the Algiers Peace Agreement\r\nand the rule of law.\r\nIn the same vein, the issue of bilateral dialogue\r\nwith Ethiopia should be viewed and can be understood\r\nonly in its proper perspective. Eritrea has no problem\r\nwith the idea of fully normalizing its relations with\r\nEthiopia and reviving good-neighbourly relations. We\r\nare neighbours, destined to live together and in\r\nharmony. But we cannot possibly put the cart before\r\nthe horse and discuss economic or security issues, or\r\nother issues relating to cooperation, while Ethiopia is\r\nforcibly occupying our land in blatant breach of the\r\nAlgiers Peace Agreement and the decision of the\r\nBoundary Commission. Indeed, Eritrea will not need\r\nthe good offices of an intermediary in order to resume\r\nnormal bilateral ties with Ethiopia once the critical\r\nborder issue is resolved legally and peacefully. I must\r\nstress that the border issue cannot be the subject of\r\nsterile dialogue such as that sought by Ethiopia. That is\r\nlegally untenable and practically impossible.\r\nThe cost of inaction by the international\r\ncommunity to regional peace and stability will be\r\nenormous, and my Government sincerely hopes that the\r\nindifference that we have witnessed over the past two\r\nyears will be rectified in time. Eritrea has shown\r\nmaximum patience and restraint, even though its\r\nsovereign territories remain occupied by force. But\r\npatience has a limit — particularly given that the\r\nhumanitarian burden is of great importance and that the\r\nsituation in that regard has been unsustainable for a\r\nlong time. Indeed, over 60,000 of our citizens continue\r\nto live in makeshift camps, unable to return to their\r\nhome villages.\r\nIn his address to the General Assembly on\r\n21 September 2004, the Secretary-General made a\r\npassionate appeal for respect for the rule of law at\r\nhome and abroad. The people and the Government of\r\nEritrea would like to thank him for that statement,\r\nwhich they subscribe to in its entirety and endorse\r\nwithout reservation. Eritreans continue to be victims of\r\nthe violation of the rule of law as a result of Ethiopia’s\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nrejection, with impunity, of the final and binding\r\ndecision of an arbitration commission sanctioned by\r\nthe United Nations and other organizations, as well as\r\nby other States.\r\nEritreans also fully agree that the rule of law\r\nbegins at home, including at the United Nations. It\r\nmust not be forgotten that the implementation of the\r\nCommission’s decision was guaranteed by a treaty\r\nobligation signed by the Secretary-General on behalf of\r\nthe United Nations. It is therefore essential to note that\r\nany stalemate in the demarcation process is a stalemate\r\nnot between Eritrea, which has accepted the decision\r\nwithout any reservations or conditions, and Ethiopia,\r\nwhich has rejected it, but between Ethiopia and the\r\nUnited Nations, which has guaranteed implementation\r\nand provided for punitive action, under Chapter VII of\r\nthe Charter, against the party that refuses to implement\r\nthe Commission’s decision.\r\nThe United Nations has the duty of enforcing the\r\nrule of law. This is a violation of the rule of law and\r\ndemonstrates the collective failure of the United\r\nNations to uphold the law and to instil respect for it in\r\nour fellow men and women. Ethiopia cannot be above\r\nthe law; Eritrea should not be denied its protection, and\r\nthe United Nations must employ its enforcement\r\ncapacity for the rule of law by fulfilling its treaty\r\nobligations.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to outline briefly\r\nthe views of my Government on other regional\r\nproblems. My Government warmly welcomes the\r\nprogress made over the past few months in promoting\r\nreconciliation and lasting peace in Somalia. Although\r\nwe are handicapped by the war imposed on us by\r\nEthiopia, we have nonetheless continued to make\r\nmodest contributions to a durable and peaceful\r\nresolution of Somalia’s internal problem. Our approach\r\nhas always hinged on supporting the Somalis as they\r\ntry to find their own solutions and on preventing the\r\nfragmentation and Balkanization of Somalia, which\r\nhave been driven by external, rather than internal,\r\ntendencies.\r\nThe magnitude of the humanitarian crisis in the\r\nSudan is too well known to merit explanation here. But\r\nas the international community focuses on what is\r\ncurrently taking place in Darfur, what is often missed\r\nis the larger picture of regional destabilization and\r\nincalculable human suffering that the fundamentalist\r\nextremist regime has been fomenting for almost\r\n15 years. Furthermore, the ramifications of the\r\nNational Islamic Front’s policies, which are based on\r\nextremist ideology, have not been confined to the\r\nSudan but have affected several neighbouring\r\ncountries, including my country. It is therefore\r\nessential that major Powers in the international\r\ncommunity see the problem for what it is and assess it\r\non the basis of what it portends.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to restate the position\r\nof my Government on the relevant ongoing debate\r\nabout the reform of the United Nations system. It is\r\nclear to us, as a matter that has been reinforced by our\r\nrecent experience, that, despite many achievements,\r\nthere are areas of critical shortfall that require reform\r\nand restructuring. We also believe that parameters and\r\nconsiderations that were relevant when the United\r\nNations was established in the immediate aftermath of\r\nthe Second World War need to be revisited and\r\nadjusted, in accordance with contemporary realities.\r\nFurthermore, representation in the Security Council\r\nmust satisfy the criteria of reasonable regional\r\nrepresentation and equity, as well as of the equality of\r\nsovereign nations, as enshrined in the Charter.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Abdurrahman Mohamed\r\nShalghem, Secretary of the General People’s\r\nCommittee for Foreign Liaison and International\r\nCooperation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\r\nMr. Shalghem (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke\r\nin Arabic): It is my pleasure to congratulate you, Sir,\r\non your election as President of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-ninth session. Your election is a testament to\r\nthe greatness of our African continent.\r\nI am pleased to address the Assembly and share\r\nthe views of my country, Libya, on a number of serious\r\nand sensitive issues that we deem important for joint\r\ninternational action and increased universal\r\ncooperation.\r\nLast year, we relinquished our right to speak to\r\nthe President of the African Union in the expectation\r\nthat he would speak for the entire Union. It seems,\r\nhowever, that the African Union has no post of Foreign\r\nMinister and that the Ministers of member States were\r\ntherefore compelled to speak instead. Thus, I am\r\nobliged to speak now.\r\nAll States obviously agree that the current\r\nstructure and the rules of procedure of the United\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nNations are flawed, and all States agree on the need for\r\nreform. Indeed, before we can discuss reform in the\r\nMiddle East, the former republics of the Soviet Union\r\nor any other area of the world, we must first reform the\r\nUnited Nations. Before we speak about lack of\r\ndemocracy in the world, we must first recognize the\r\nlack of democracy in the United Nations. Furthermore,\r\nbecause the General Assembly is the parliament of\r\nparliaments and the Security Council is the government\r\nof governments, we have no right to talk about\r\ndemocracy and reform in the world unless we first\r\nreform the structure of the United Nations.\r\nThe past 59 years have demonstrated that the\r\nGeneral Assembly is merely a decorative body without\r\na soul and that the authority lies with the Security\r\nCouncil, which controls all the work of the United\r\nNations. It is the one and only authority. My country\r\ntherefore proposes that the upcoming sixtieth session\r\nof the General Assembly should be decisive and\r\nimportant, and that invitations should be extended to\r\nall world leaders to participate. We should announce\r\nthat decisions on radical reform for the United Nations\r\nwill be taken at the sixtieth session. God willing,\r\nPresident Muammar Al-Qadhafi, in what will be his\r\nfirst visit to the General Assembly, will attend that\r\nsession, which will be a historic milestone involving a\r\nconfrontation with the grave and unjust situation\r\ncurrently prevailing at the United Nations.\r\nWe propose that the sixtieth session be held in\r\nGeneva — the geographical centre of the world — to\r\nfacilitate the attendance of all world leaders and\r\npresidents, even if additional funds have to be\r\nallocated in order to convene the meeting in Geneva.\r\nMy country is ready to contribute financial support for\r\nthat endeavour.\r\nThere are two options before us. Our first option\r\nis to transfer the authority to invoke Chapters VI and\r\nVII of the Charter from the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly. If that cannot be done, we have no\r\nchoice but to declare the General Assembly null and\r\nvoid and to stop pouring money into this moribund\r\nbody.\r\nOur second option is to increase the membership\r\nof the Security Council by allocating seats to new\r\nentities such as the African Union, the Association of\r\nSoutheast Asian Nations and Latin America. In\r\naddition, the right of veto will have to be reviewed and\r\nmade subject to new rules at the same time as the\r\nmembership of the Security Council is expanded.\r\nWe warn that, unless these reforms are\r\nimplemented, the United Nations will cease to exist, as\r\nunilateral actions are taking place outside the confines\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe African Union must have a permanent seat\r\non the Security Council. That seat will be held by the\r\nUnion’s members in rotation.\r\nAs the sixtieth session of the General Assembly\r\napproaches, Libya is presenting a unique, bold and\r\nstrong initiative to eliminate its programmes of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear and\r\nchemical weapons, and hand over related equipment to\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency.\r\nLibya played the central role in the establishment\r\nof the African Union and contributed effectively to the\r\nliberation of colonized and oppressed peoples. Libya,\r\nwith its 2,000-kilometre coastline along the\r\nMediterranean Sea, is at the centre of the world and is\r\nboth a place of conflict and a haven for tourism. The\r\nMediterranean Sea without Libya is inconceivable, as\r\nis the south Mediterranean coast without Libya. Libya\r\ngave birth to the third universal theory — the middle\r\nground between capitalism and communism — and\r\npresented the world with the Green Book, which\r\nresolves the political, economic and social problems of\r\nsociety in its three sections. Accordingly, Libya\r\ndeserves to have a permanent seat on the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nColonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi presented a\r\nproposal to world leaders, which they all approved.\r\nThe proposal calls for the establishment of a committee\r\nof wise men, consisting of President Nelson Mandela,\r\nPresident Mikhail Gorbachev and President Bill\r\nClinton, that would serve as an authority for resolving\r\nthe conflicts of our world. The United Nations should\r\nadopt a resolution supporting that proposal.\r\nWe must all continue to combat terrorism. If we\r\nwant to eliminate terrorism, we must first eliminate its\r\ncauses and not simply pursue its isolated operations.\r\nWe must attack its root causes.\r\nIf we want oil supplies and prices to remain\r\nstable, we must prevent wars and potential conflicts\r\nfrom occurring near oil fields.\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nFinally, Colonel Al-Qadhafi will soon address the\r\nissue of United Nations reform on his web site: www.\r\nalqadhafi.org.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. José Ramos-Horta, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste.\r\nMr. Ramos-Horta (Timor-Leste): In view of\r\ntime constraints, I shall share an abbreviated version of\r\nmy speech. The full text is being distributed in the\r\nHall. Please forgive me for skipping the usual formal\r\ngreetings to all the deserving dignitaries.\r\nI first walked into this building in December\r\n1975, in the midst of a North American winter, having\r\nnever seen snow in my life, to appear before the\r\nSecurity Council. I learned then, and since, that not all\r\nUnited Nations resolutions are implemented. But I also\r\nlearned that, in spite of its shortcomings and failings,\r\nthe United Nations offers us hope and that we must\r\ncling to that hope, for it gives us the strength and the\r\ncourage to continue.\r\nWhen the Secretary-General visited Timor-Leste\r\nin May 2002 to preside over the formal transfer of\r\nsovereignty to our elected President, I said to him:\r\n“Mr. Secretary-General, you are going to lose your job\r\nas President of Timor-Leste”. I can assure members\r\nthat Kofi Annan did not seem too upset to be\r\nrelinquishing that unpaid and difficult job. We thank\r\nhim for his wise stewardship of Timor-Leste’s\r\ntransition to independence.\r\nWe cannot fail to pay tribute to our beloved\r\nfriend, Sergio Vieira de Mello, who was brutally\r\nmurdered in Iraq just over a year ago. Our people wept\r\nover his death, but Sergio will always live in us. His\r\npassage through Timor-Leste, his charisma, energy and\r\nsmile will be with us forever. Our tribute goes also to\r\nall the United Nations personnel who lost their lives in\r\nour country and in many other difficult regions around\r\nthe world.\r\nWe offer our sincere condolences and solidarity\r\nto Russia, Spain, Indonesia and Australia — the latest\r\nvictims in a seemingly endless catalogue of barbarity\r\ncommitted by fanatics.\r\nIt was only a little over two years ago that\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan handed over power to\r\nour elected President. Since then, we have made real\r\nprogress in several sectors, such as public\r\nadministration, education and health. Yet, we are\r\nfailing in other areas.\r\nThe most fragile sector of the Administration in\r\nTimor-Leste is the judiciary. We have very few trained\r\njudges, prosecutors or lawyers. We are committed to\r\ncreating a strong and independent judiciary, but that\r\nachievement is still many years off. We thank those\r\ncountries that have assisted us in improving our\r\njudiciary and we implore them to continue their efforts\r\nfor many years to come.\r\nOur economy is limping along, although it is\r\ndoing much better than anticipated. We are confident\r\nthat in two to three years we will experience strong\r\neconomic growth as a result of revenues from oil and\r\ngas, as well as capital investment in public\r\ninfrastructure, including roads, bridges, ports and\r\nairports, telecommunications, public housing, health,\r\nagriculture, fisheries and tourism. We should then be\r\nable to begin drastically reducing unemployment and\r\npoverty.\r\nHere we wish to congratulate the Indonesian\r\npeople and their leaders for their great experiment in\r\ndemocracy. Few imagined in 1999 that within only a\r\nfew years the fourth largest nation in the world — and\r\nthe largest Muslim country — would emerge as a\r\nvibrant democracy.\r\nTalks are under way between Australia and\r\nTimor-Leste to rectify our differing interpretations of\r\ninternational law and State practice as regards maritime\r\nboundaries between coastal States. Timor-Leste shares\r\nthe view of the majority of the international\r\ncommunity that, where there are overlapping claims\r\nbetween two coastal States, the principle of\r\nequidistance should apply.\r\nAllow me now to address some issues that are of\r\nconcern to us. In the past 20 years or so, our world has\r\nbeen the stage for several major conflicts, including the\r\ninvasion of Iran by Saddam Hussein in the 1980s,\r\nwhich resulted in the death of over a million people.\r\nChemical and biological weapons were unleashed on\r\nboth civilians and combatants. Soon after the end of\r\nthe Iraq-Iran war, the same regime in Baghdad\r\nlaunched another invasion, this time against the State\r\nof Kuwait. Most of us have now relegated the\r\nCambodian tragedy of the 1970s to a footnote in our\r\nintellectual memory, but let us not forget the almost\r\nuniversal indifference of the international community\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nto the genocide unleashed by the Khmer Rouge in\r\nCambodia.\r\nLike many of you, and millions of peace\r\nmarchers, we are opposed to violence and wars. But we\r\nmust ask ourselves some troubling questions. Should\r\nwe oppose the use of force even in the face of genocide\r\nand ethnic cleansing? In the eternal dilemma of war\r\nand peace there are pacifists and idealists who oppose\r\nthe use of force under any circumstances and there are\r\nthe realists who support the use of force under certain\r\ncircumstances, namely, if it has been sanctioned by the\r\nSecurity Council. Those who are absolutely against the\r\nuse of force have been unable to articulate a better\r\nstrategy for dealing with the savagery of ethnic\r\ncleansing and genocide. Patient diplomacy lasts as long\r\nas it lasts; it might bear fruit, or it might not. Genocide,\r\nhowever, continues as we can see in the Sudan where\r\nthousands of our fellow human beings are dying right\r\nnow.\r\nIn the tragic case of Cambodia in the 1970s, the\r\nworld knew that an evil regime was deliberately\r\npurging the nation and murdering hundreds of\r\nthousands of innocent human beings. Yet, the Security\r\nCouncil never even discussed the Khmer Rouge\r\ngenocide. Around the same time as the Cambodian\r\ntragedy, genocide was taking place on the African\r\ncontinent, in Uganda. The Security Council neither\r\ndebated nor took any action on the situation in Uganda\r\nunder Idi Amin. It required the moral courage of a\r\nJulius Nyerere of the United Republic of Tanzania to\r\nput an end to Idi Amin’s genocidal rule. We would ask,\r\nif there had been a lone world leader with the moral\r\ncourage to order his country’s armed forces to\r\nintervene in Rwanda in 1994, would he have been\r\nhailed as a saviour or vilified as an aggressor?\r\nIn selectively recalling some of the most flagrant\r\ncases of our collective failure to prevent wars and\r\ngenocide, our sole intention is to provoke reflection on\r\nthe failings and weaknesses of the United Nations with\r\na view to exploring ways of making our Organization a\r\nmore effective custodian of world peace.\r\nAllow us to add some thoughts to the ongoing\r\ndebate as to how we can realize an improved United\r\nNations. We wish, however, to preface our views on\r\nUnited Nations reform by stating that we do not\r\nbelieve that a simple expansion of Security Council\r\nmembership will suffice to strengthen the United\r\nNations. It may make the Council more representative\r\nby better reflecting current global demographics and\r\npower-balances, but it will not necessarily make it\r\nmore effective.\r\nThat said, there is a clear need to expand\r\nmembership in the Security Council for non-permanent\r\nand permanent members. Timor-Leste fully supports\r\nthe Franco-German initiative on United Nations\r\nreforms. We also believe that the new expanded\r\nSecurity Council should include countries like\r\nGermany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Brazil and one or\r\ntwo from the African continent. But, to reassure you, I\r\nshould add that Timor-Leste is not seeking a permanent\r\nseat in the Security Council for itself — please do not\r\nworry about that.\r\nWe particularly support permanent membership\r\nstatus for Indonesia because we believe in the need for\r\nbalanced representation within the Security Council,\r\nencompassing all the world’s major civilizations and\r\nfaiths. Non-inclusion of Indonesia — the largest\r\nsecular Muslim country in the world — as a new\r\npermanent member would again leave the Security\r\nCouncil with a predominantly Christian representation.\r\nIncidentally, my Government has already\r\nreceived requests for support for a seat in Council for\r\nas far ahead as 2020 and 2024. Moreover, on the basis\r\nof the two-year rotation arrangement, it seems that\r\nTimor-Leste, and many other small nations, will only\r\nbe able to offer its services to the Security Council\r\nsomewhere in 2049. Incidentally, we are very touched\r\nthat many delegations have already expressed support\r\nfor Timor-Leste for 2049.\r\nThe world is faced with a growing AIDS\r\npandemic, the epicentre of which is now shifting to\r\nAsia. Moreover, malaria and tuberculosis have been\r\nwith us for many generations, yet there is no real\r\ncommitment of resources that will enable our scientists\r\nand societies to address those epidemics.\r\nThe combined official development assistance\r\n(ODA) of the rich industrialized countries does not\r\nexceed US$ 50 billion annually. Compare that with the\r\nmore than US$ 300 billion those countries provide in\r\nsubsidies to their farmers and industries.\r\nWeapons-producing countries are flooding the\r\nworld with all types of arms that fuel conflicts. There\r\nmust be a strict code of conduct on weapons exports\r\naimed at reducing the flow of conventional weapons to\r\npoor countries and regions in conflict.\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nWe in Timor-Leste do not wish to sound\r\nungrateful, but we have reason to be sceptical about\r\nODA that ends up back in the donor metropolis with\r\nonly a fraction of that much-publicized aid benefiting\r\nthe recipient country. There has to be a thorough\r\nreform of ODA with a view to ensuring that developing\r\ncountries actually receive what is pledged. We wonder\r\nsometimes about the usefulness of the endless\r\nmeetings, study trips, evaluations, feasibility studies\r\nand other activities, when, in reality, all the\r\ninformation required can be downloaded from the\r\nInternet by a 7-year-old child. Actually my 10-year-old\r\nniece, Sarah, does most of the Internet searches for me\r\nand instead of paying an international consultant\r\nsomething like $1,000 a day in consulting fees, she is\r\nhappy with two scoops of chocolate ice cream.\r\nWe join with the leaders of Brazil, Chile, France,\r\nSpain and others in urging the rich of the North to\r\nallocate 0.7 per cent of their national wealth to ODA,\r\nthus meeting the target set by the United Nations. It is\r\nperplexing that only four small rich countries have met\r\nand/or exceeded that modest target.\r\nEurope and the United States should gradually\r\neliminate all agricultural subsidies to their farmers that\r\nkill competition and market access of poor countries.\r\nWe understand the political difficulties faced by some\r\nfriends in Europe and the United States when dealing\r\nwith the issue of subsidies. Hence, we believe that\r\ndeveloping countries, the European Union and the\r\nUnited States should be able to reach a reasonable\r\ncompromise on this issue.\r\nWe conclude our remarks with reference to some\r\ninternational situations. Regarding the ongoing conflict\r\nin Western Sahara, we endorse the comments made by\r\nHis Excellency President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of\r\nAlgeria, a country that has contributed enormously to\r\nthe liberation of the African continent. On this issue,\r\nour Government is guided by Algeria and the African\r\nUnion.\r\nWe appeal to our senior Asian leaders, in\r\nparticular, China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea and\r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations to redouble\r\ntheir efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict\r\nin Myanmar.\r\nOn the subject of sanctions, we wish to appeal to\r\nour friends in the United States Congress to rise above\r\ntheir parochial politics and lift all forms of sanctions\r\non Cuba.\r\nThere is deep-seated resentment and anger among\r\nMuslims and many non-Muslims around the world over\r\nIsrael’s policies that thwart Palestinian right to a\r\ndignified existence and homeland.\r\nThe two-State solution agreed upon by all sides\r\nhas to be rapidly resurrected and implemented as a first\r\nstep towards durable peace in the region. The\r\nPalestinian intifada and suicide-bombing, as well as the\r\nIsraeli policy of annexation and retaliation, have\r\ndeepened the anger and hatred. There has to be a way\r\nout.\r\nWe hope that the United States, which initiated\r\nthe war in Iraq and gallantly freed the Iraqi people\r\nfrom a tyrant, will go half-way and meet those on the\r\nother side of the debate. The United States and its\r\nallies should not shoulder the burden of Iraq alone.\r\nThe Euro-Atlantic partnership is the single most\r\nimportant pillar of the world’s security and economic\r\nwell-being. Americans and Europeans share the same\r\nvalues of democracy and freedom. Surely, they are\r\nwise enough to overcome their differences, however\r\ndeep, and give the Iraqi people a chance to finally be\r\nfree and at peace among themselves and with their\r\nneighbours. May God Almighty Bless You All.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Charles-Hervé Wénézoui,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration and\r\nFrancophonie of the Central African Republic.\r\nMr. Wénézoui (Central African Republic) (spoke\r\nin French): Allow me at the outset to extend my warm\r\ncongratulations upon your election to the presidency of\r\nthe fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. That\r\nelection is a resounding tribute by the international\r\ncommunity to Gabon, that brother country, for its\r\nsingular leadership role in Africa, and for the personal\r\ncommitment of President Omar Bongo Ondimba that\r\nhas enabled Central Africans to be reconciled today,\r\nfor which we are most grateful. Your great experience\r\nand ability as a diplomat and a statesman assure us of\r\nthe success of our work.\r\nHis Excellency François Bozizé, President of the\r\nRepublic and Head of State of my country, whose faith\r\nin the ideals of this Organization are unwavering,\r\nwishes you all success. As you might expect, my\r\ndelegation will be fully with you in your endeavours. I\r\nwould like to recall the competence with which your\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia,\r\nconducted the work of the fifty-eighth session.\r\nAllow me to extend to Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan the appreciation of the Central African Republic\r\nfor his endeavours to strengthen peace wherever it is\r\nthreatened and his resolve to find ways and means to\r\npreserve the authority and credibility of the United\r\nNations, which has been so sorely tried in recent years.\r\nBefore making its contribution and offering its\r\nthoughts on the state of the world, my delegation\r\nwould like to join with all those who have expressed\r\ntheir sympathy to the populations that have fallen\r\nvictim to natural disasters taking place in parts of the\r\nPacific and on the American continent, which have left\r\na woeful train of destruction in their path.\r\nThe major issues of the world today —\r\ninternational peace and security, combating poverty,\r\ndevelopment, the defence and promotion of human\r\nrights, protection of the environment and health —\r\ncannot find a lasting solution save through the common\r\nefforts of the international community through United\r\nNations. To echo the expressive words of the\r\nSecretary-General in his 2002 report entitled\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for\r\nfurther change, “The challenge ahead is to strengthen\r\nour capacity for collective action and thus forge a\r\ncommon destiny in a time of accelerating global\r\nchange (A/57/387, para. 2)”.\r\nIn that context, multilateralism, which is the main\r\nguarantee of the participation of all nations in\r\ninternational affairs, must be safeguarded and\r\nstrengthened at all costs. The spread of crisis\r\nflashpoints, the radicalization of international terrorism\r\nand organized crime, growing poverty and the spread\r\nof endemic diseases — all of those things should\r\nconvince us that only active international solidarity is\r\ncapable of ensuring stability and security for our\r\nworld.\r\nThe tenacity with which terrorism is defying the\r\ninternational community in so many different ways is\r\nindeed disturbing. That scourge knows no borders,\r\nrace, or religion. The attacks of 11 September 2001 in\r\nNew York and Washington, 11 March 2004 in Spain\r\nand 2 September 2004 in Russia are only its latest\r\nexpressions. Given the complexity of that\r\nphenomenon, we must arrive at a collective response to\r\nwhat has become a common menace. However,\r\nbecause our countries lack adequate means to combat\r\nthat scourge, the essential problem of cooperation by\r\nthe richer countries arises in order to obtain better\r\nequipment for detection, identification, surveillance\r\nand control on our land, sea and air borders. Similarly\r\nthe fight against transnational organized crime also\r\ncalls for large-scale cooperation under the aegis of the\r\nspecial fund for cooperation provided for by United\r\nNations conventions.\r\nThe difficult present international economic\r\ncontext has negatively affected the developing\r\neconomies in general and African economies in\r\nparticular. Stiff international trade competition,\r\nintensified protectionist practices, fluctuating\r\ncurrencies, the burden of debt — all these are\r\nhandicaps that are slowing the development of our\r\ncountries.\r\nIn Cancun last year, members of the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) tried to relaunch efforts towards\r\nthe liberalization of trade. We must continue to seek\r\nsolutions to overcome the failure of Cancun and ensure\r\nthe success of the Doha round of trade negotiations.\r\nThe 2004 WTO meeting in Geneva is proof that we\r\nmust not stand idly by when faced with the policy of\r\nagricultural subsidies. The Millennium Declaration, the\r\noutcome of the Johannesburg Summit and the\r\nMonterrey Consensus have laid out the path to be\r\nfollowed and the goals to be pursued in order to\r\nestablish a true world partnership for development.\r\nSince the last General Assembly session, the\r\nworld has undergone a series of changes exacerbating\r\nan already deteriorated situation as a result of threats to\r\npeace and security and a growing number of points of\r\nconflict and tension. An example is the situation in the\r\nMiddle East, which is a source of deep concern.\r\nIndeed, despite the transfer of powers to the new Iraqi\r\nauthorities on 29 June, the spiral of violence continues\r\nuncontrollably, fuelling the Iraqi people’s resentment\r\nof the international community. The recent\r\nappointment of a Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General in Iraq means that the United\r\nNations has a central role to play in the political\r\nreconstruction process there. However, the Central\r\nAfrican Republic ardently hopes for the\r\nimplementation of proposals already made by France,\r\nin cooperation with the Russian Federation, for an\r\ninternational conference on Iraq, within the framework\r\nof the United Nations.\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nIn Israel, the international community must\r\ncontinue to support the action of the Quartet to restore\r\npeace between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.\r\nThere is no alternative to the road map, which calls for\r\nparallel advances in the three areas of security, politics\r\nand economics. In Africa, despite certain successes\r\nsuch as the return to peace in Angola, Sierra Leone\r\nand — little by little — in Liberia, the African\r\ncontinent is still a source of deep concern. The surge in\r\narmed conflicts, the tensions and the instabilities are\r\nbecoming a recurrent phenomenon. While the third\r\nAccra meeting favourably restarted the peace process\r\nin Côte d’Ivoire and gave rise to new hope, other\r\nsources of conflict are surfacing here and there.\r\nThe Darfur crisis in the Sudan continues to\r\nmobilize the international community’s attention due to\r\nthe large movements of populations towards the\r\nborders with Chad and the insecurity that persists\r\nthere. My Government is following with particular\r\ninterest the developments in the situation in Darfur due\r\nto the humanitarian and security implications for the\r\nCentral African Republic, which borders on the Sudan\r\nand Chad.\r\nIn the Central African Republic, we support the\r\ninitiatives taken, since the Chadian mediation, through\r\ninternational forums, which have taken over from it in\r\nthe framework of the African Union and the United\r\nNations. We encourage the Sudanese Government —\r\nwhich has proved its readiness — and the parties\r\ninvolved to follow the path of wisdom based on the\r\ndialogue established by President Olusegun Obasanjo,\r\nPresident of the African Union, and thus spare the\r\nbrotherly Sudanese people more suffering, since\r\nSecurity Council sanctions would only worsen their\r\nsuffering.\r\nThe massacre of 160 refugees in Gatumba on\r\n14 August 2004 on the border between the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and Burundi sparked\r\nwidespread indignation and exacerbated an already\r\ndelicate situation in that part of the Great Lakes region.\r\nHowever, our conviction is that despite the setbacks,\r\nthe various agreements between Rwanda and the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo on the one hand,\r\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda\r\non the other, as well as the historic agreements of Sun\r\nCity, have finally made progress towards peace\r\nirreversible in the Great Lakes region.\r\nThat, in any case, is the purpose of our active\r\nparticipation in the preparatory process for the\r\ninternational conference on peace, security and\r\ndevelopment of the Great Lakes region and our\r\ncontribution to the stability pact that will emerge from\r\nit. This is within the framework of the global,\r\nintegrated and concerted approach sought by the\r\nUnited Nations, which has the advantage of pursuing\r\nregional solutions that will reach beyond the\r\ngeographical borders of the six countries of the Great\r\nLakes region.\r\nI would like to touch on the situation in my own\r\ncountry, the Central African Republic. Proclaimed\r\nindependent on 13 August 1960, my country has gone\r\nthrough relatively brief periods of political and social\r\nprogress, linked by long periods of economic\r\nstagnation and even retreat, justifying the opinions of\r\nAfro-pessimists about its chaotic development. As with\r\nmany other African States, a series of coups marked\r\nour political development. Some of these were palace\r\ncoups and others involved a true popular revolution\r\ncharacterized by both the crystallization of social\r\naspirations they unleashed and the political changes\r\nthey brought about, such as the Carnation Revolution\r\nof Portugal in 1974. The changes of 15 March 2003\r\nwere of that type. They were popular movements\r\ncarried forward by social forces that were as different\r\nfrom each other as were the involved political parties,\r\nlabour unions, religious bodies, non-governmental\r\norganizations and the army.\r\nI am pleased once again to pay tribute to the\r\nresolute action of our Organization and that of the\r\nwhole international community, which spared no effort\r\nbefore 15 March 2003 to find a happy solution to the\r\nCentral African crisis, mobilizing the Security Council;\r\nthe French-speaking world; the central organ of the\r\nformer Organization of African Unity (OAU) for the\r\nprevention, management and settlement of conflicts;\r\nthe heads of State of the Central African Economic and\r\nMonetary Community, especially President El Hadj\r\nOmar Bongo Ondimba; the Economic Community of\r\nCentral African States; and the Community of Sahelo-\r\nSaharan States.\r\nFor more than a year, the Central African people\r\nhave been trying to rebuild their broken unity, while\r\nthe Government pursues the restoration of security\r\nthroughout its territory. Confidence is growing with\r\nboth our bilateral and multilateral foreign partners.\r\nConstitutional legality will be established at the end of\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nfree and transparent elections to take place in early\r\n2005. These are the main points of the timetable that\r\nthe consensual transitional administration set up in\r\nJune 2003 and that it has been pursuing ever since, in\r\nkeeping with its commitments.\r\nIndeed, the national transitional council, a\r\nprovisional parliament established in July 2003, is\r\nrepresentative of all of the socio-political forces of the\r\nnation and fulfils a legislative function, including the\r\nadoption of legislation and the oversight of\r\ngovernmental activities.\r\nThe timetable for the transition also provided for\r\nthe organization of a national dialogue. For nearly two\r\nmonths, from September to October 2003, all of the\r\nactive forces of the nation came together in this forum\r\nto search together for the deep causes of what has\r\ndivided us for so long. From these meetings emerged\r\nrecommendations, the main points of which underlie\r\nthe activities of our Government today and the\r\nfundamental law of our country, on which our people\r\nare preparing to vote through a referendum. An organ\r\nthat was specifically created to oversee the application\r\nof these recommendations, the national dialogue\r\nfollow-up committee, is now pursuing its mission.\r\nAn independent joint electoral commission, made\r\nup of representatives of political parties, civil society\r\nand the administration, was also set up, which has just\r\npublished the timetable for a future referendum and\r\nelections as follows: 30 November 2004, constitutional\r\nreferendum; 30 January 2005, legislative and\r\npresidential elections, first round; 27 February 2005,\r\nsecond round; 14 March 2005, announcement of\r\nresults.\r\nThe mission of the present transitional\r\nGovernment is to bring about conditions permitting a\r\nreturn to normal democratic life in the Central African\r\nRepublic. However, the grave financial difficulties\r\nfaced by my country do not enable it to face alone the\r\ncosts of these various elections. Of the 5.5 billion CFA\r\nfrancs necessary to finance these elections, we thus far\r\nhave only 3.5 billion. I would address an appeal for\r\nassistance to enable us to organize the elections under\r\nproper conditions and thus bring about a rapid return to\r\nconstitutional order.\r\nAs of now, my Government sincerely thanks the\r\nbrother countries and international organizations that\r\nhave so generously contributed to financing this\r\nprocess, especially France, the People’s Republic of\r\nChina, the European Union and the Central African\r\nEconomic and Monetary Community. The support that\r\nthe international community will provide to this very\r\ndifficult and delicate phase in the history of the Central\r\nAfrican Republic will be necessary to conclude this\r\nconsensual transition. Our common dedication to\r\ndemocracy prompts me to believe that this appeal by\r\nthe people and Government of my country will be\r\nheeded.\r\nThe challenges to be overcome in fulfilling the\r\ngreat hopes inspired by the changes of 15 March 2003\r\nare many and pressing. These same challenges\r\nprompted the establishment of an agenda — a road\r\nmap — that is focused on three major points: first,\r\nconsensual governance for a rapid return to\r\nconstitutional order; secondly, restoration of security\r\nand an effective return to peace; and, thirdly,\r\ncombating poverty. The measures adopted by the new\r\nauthorities, as they are outlined above, will lead to the\r\nrestoration of peace and national reconciliation and\r\nwere endorsed by the Central African people and\r\nrightly welcomed by the international community.\r\nToday, thanks to the re-establishment and\r\nrestructuring of our security and defence forces, the\r\npresence of the multinational force from the Central\r\nAfrican Economic and Monetary Community, with\r\nFrance providing logistical support, and assistance\r\nfrom friendly countries, in particular France, Libya, the\r\nSudan, the People’s Republic of China and Morocco,\r\nas well as the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States, we\r\ncan say that the process of making the whole Central\r\nAfrican territory secure has made significant progress.\r\nEfforts are still needed to ensure full security before\r\nthe elections take place. But the relief felt by the\r\npopulation and the hopes inspired by the changes of\r\nMarch 2003 will be gravely compromised if the\r\ncommitments undertaken in this regard by the\r\ninternational community since May 2000 are not\r\nrealized.\r\nIt is also essential that we attack the economic\r\nand financial problems as part of the struggle against\r\npoverty. From that perspective, the Central African\r\nRepublic offers its full support to the Declaration on\r\nAction against Hunger and Poverty, adopted in New\r\nYork on 20 September 2004 as a result of a joint\r\ninitiative by President Chirac and President Ignacio\r\nLula da Silva.\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nThe post-conflict programme that my\r\nGovernment, working with the international financial\r\ninstitutions, has just drawn up provides a sound basis\r\nfor the reforms that are necessary if my country is to\r\nhave greater opportunities for success in the field of\r\nreconstruction.\r\nThe considerable efforts made at the national\r\nlevel and the steadfast support of the friends of the\r\nCentral African Republic, including France, the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China and the countries members\r\nof the Central African Economic and Monetary\r\nCommunity, have helped to lift the burden that salary\r\narrears imposed on the transition process, with the\r\nresult that the people of the Central African Republic\r\nwill emerge stronger and more united.\r\nI could not conclude without touching upon a\r\nsubject with regard to which all those who have spoken\r\nhave been unanimous: if we are to make progress in\r\nthis era, the United Nations must undertake a rational\r\nreform — a reform that is necessary if the Organization\r\nis to strengthen its role and enhance its effectiveness.\r\nThat reform effort must begin by reconfiguring\r\nthe Security Council — the central organ entrusted\r\nwith the major task of dealing with issues of peace and\r\nsecurity. From the perspective of the delegation of the\r\nCentral African Republic, the initiative of France and\r\nGermany calling for a permanent seat for Germany,\r\nand the similar appeal in favour of such seats for\r\nJapan, Africa and Latin America, should be given\r\nserious consideration.\r\nFurthermore, the proposal of the Chairman-in-\r\nOffice of the Economic Community of Central African\r\nStates, President Denis Nguesso, calling for a political\r\npresence in the United Nations in the person of a\r\nrepresentative of the Secretary-General for Central\r\nAfrica, is also worth consideration.\r\nThe Central African Republic will support\r\nproposals for reform submitted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral insofar as they strengthen the role of the\r\nOrganization in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security and the resolution of international issues\r\non the basis of the principles of dialogue and\r\nmultilateral cooperation.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I give the floor\r\nto His Excellency Mr. Vinci Niel Clodumar, Chairman\r\nof the delegation of the Republic of Nauru.\r\nMr. Clodumar (Nauru): It gives me great\r\npleasure to deliver this statement on behalf of His\r\nExcellency Ludwig Scotty, President of the Republic of\r\nNauru, who had to cancel his trip to New York at the\r\nlast minute due to pressing matters at home. President\r\nScotty has asked that I convey to the Assembly the\r\nwarm greetings and good wishes of the people and the\r\nGovernment of Nauru, and his warmest congratulations\r\nto you, Sir, on your assumption of the stewardship of\r\nthe Assembly. We assure you of Nauru’s fullest\r\ncooperation in the deliberations that are ahead of us.\r\nThrough you, Mr. President, my delegation joins\r\nprevious speakers in congratulating Foreign Minister\r\nJulian Hunte of Saint Lucia for a productive fifty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly and for his\r\nexemplary performance. As a member of the Alliance\r\nof Small Island States (AOSIS), Nauru is extremely\r\nproud to be associated with Saint Lucia and the\r\nCaribbean Community, and it just goes to show that, as\r\nis the case of our coconut trees, our potential is great.\r\nHowever, a lack of resources has limited the capacity\r\nto flourish of many more people like Julian Hunte from\r\nthe AOSIS region who are serving or have served in\r\ninternational office.\r\nWe congratulate the Secretary-General for his\r\ncontinued commitment to multilateralism as a means of\r\nresolving our common problems and for his report on\r\nthe work of the Organization (A/59/1) over the past 12\r\nmonths. However, it is discouraging to note that\r\npeacekeeping activities have had to increase rather than\r\ndecrease. Human rights and humanitarian norms\r\ncontinue to be violated as a result of armed conflict and\r\nterrorism. Atrocious acts of terrorism against innocent\r\ncivilians, particularly women and children, continue to\r\ntear the fabric of civility and the moral values on which\r\neach and every society on this planet is founded.\r\nNauru sympathizes with those countries and\r\npeoples who have suffered loss as a result of conflict\r\nand terrorist acts. Nauru encourages peace in its Asia-\r\nPacific neighbourhood, and expresses the hope that,\r\nwhatever their differences, China and Taiwan can\r\nresolve them peacefully for the sake of the region’s\r\ncontinued peace, stability and prosperity.\r\nWe support the Secretary-General’s bold\r\nstatement of position with respect to the mitigation of\r\narmed conflicts generally, and those on the African\r\ncontinent and in the Middle East in particular. We are\r\npleased to hear that, for the remainder of his term in\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\noffice, he will be focusing mainly on strengthening the\r\nrule of law and transitional justice. Nauru supports the\r\nposition the Secretary-General set out in his statement\r\nlast week at the 3rd meeting, when he said\r\n“It is by reintroducing the rule of law, and\r\nconfidence in its impartial application, that we\r\ncan hope to resuscitate societies shattered by\r\nconflict. It is the law, including Security Council\r\nresolutions, which offers the best foundation for\r\nresolving prolonged conflicts — in the Middle\r\nEast, in Iraq and around the world.”\r\nThe democratization of governance, the\r\napplication of accountability and transparency and the\r\nprotection of minorities and the vulnerable are\r\ncomplementary elements of ruling under law.\r\nNauru, like other Member States, looks forward\r\nwith anticipation to the report of the Secretary-General\r\non the findings of the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change to be finalized later this year.\r\nThe Panel has been charged with the task of reviewing\r\nthreats to peace and security, as well as other global\r\nchallenges, insofar as they may influence or connect\r\nwith those threats. Nauru continues to believe that\r\nmultilateralism is the key to resolving contemporary\r\nproblems in all of their complexity. Hence, it is\r\nimportant that the recommendations of the High-level\r\nPanel reinforce that point and that the proposals are\r\ndoable and add value to the reform programmes that\r\nare already in the pipeline, including the revitalization\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation has stated in previous debates that\r\nit agrees fully with the reform of the Security Council.\r\nThe fresh approach initiated by the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session has, to\r\nsome extent, injected life back into the debate by\r\nfocusing on key elements of the reform. It is our hope\r\nthat the Bureau will continue the push for the further\r\nconvergence of views by refining the choices that we\r\nmade during the fifty-eighth session. The formation of\r\nan informal group of countries with aspirations to\r\npermanent seats in an expanded Security Council is\r\ninteresting, and could prove to be a catalyst, expediting\r\nthe debate on expansion. Nauru can and will support\r\nthe aspirations of Germany, Japan and India to a\r\npermanent seat in an expanded Security Council.\r\nIt is my delegation’s firm view, however, that\r\nprogress is being held hostage by those countries that\r\ninsist that the expansion should not be done without\r\neither eliminating or modifying the veto power\r\naccorded to permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil. Unless this difference in approach is\r\nreconciled, time and energy spent on other elements of\r\nthe reform will be futile.\r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly must\r\nhave at its heart the maximization of opportunity for\r\nequitable representation by all Member States in the\r\nmajor organs of the United Nations and its committees\r\nand to ensure that their programme of work allows for\r\nthe full participation of members, particularly the small\r\nStates. In that regard, the proposal to split the work of\r\nthe Main Committees of the General Assembly into\r\ntwo segments over a six-month period would allow\r\nsmall States like Nauru, which has only two diplomatic\r\nstaff, to increase its participation. Nauru would\r\ntherefore support such a proposal when further\r\ndeliberations take place later in the session.\r\nNauru would note that its position is consistent\r\nwith the United Nations core principle of universality,\r\nwhich calls on us all to be ever-mindful of the views of\r\nthose countries seeking expanded responsibilities in\r\ninternational affairs. Countries that have sterling\r\nrecords in democracy, human rights, peace and the\r\nprinciple of freedom should have their achievements,\r\nas well as their capacities, appropriately recognized.\r\nAs a small island developing State in the Pacific\r\nOcean, Nauru aligns itself with the interventions\r\nalready made by the leaders of countries of the\r\nAlliance of Small Island States who have spoken\r\nbefore me on the concerns and challenges that we, the\r\nsmall-island big-ocean developing States, are facing.\r\nNauru bears all the unique characteristics of a small\r\nisland State: smallness in both land area and\r\npopulation, lack of resources, remoteness and\r\nvulnerability to exogenous forces, whether man-made\r\nor natural.\r\nThe devastation of Niue by Cyclone Heta and the\r\ndisastrous hurricane destruction in Caribbean countries\r\nthis year are stark reminders of the vulnerability of\r\nisland States. Nauru joins others in expressing its\r\ndeepest sympathy for the loss of life and property in\r\nthe affected countries of the Caribbean and the\r\nsouthern coastal states of the United States of America.\r\nAgainst that background, my delegation would\r\nlike to focus on what it considers to be a spanner in the\r\nwheel of negotiations on an outcome strategy paper for\r\nthe International Meeting to Review the\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, to be held in Mauritius. It appears to us that the\r\nprogramme for political recognition of the special case\r\nof small island developing States (SIDS), as outlined at\r\nthe Barbados Conference in 1994, and reinforced in\r\nNew York during the five-year review held in 1999, as\r\nwell as in chapter VII of the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation, has taken a backseat in the\r\nnegotiations to generic undertakings made at other\r\ninternational conferences on development since\r\n1999 — in particular, the Millennium Development\r\nGoals of 2000 and the Monterrey Consensus of 2002.\r\nBenchmarking the SIDS outcome strategy paper to the\r\nlatter agreed texts would be hypocrisy of a high order\r\ninsofar as political acceptance of SIDS as a special\r\ncase is concerned. Indeed, the slow progress in the\r\nimplementation by many small island developing\r\nStates of the measures called for in those texts is but a\r\ntrue reflection that our problems are SIDS-specific and\r\ngo deeper than the generic issues of development.\r\nNauru is also concerned that some of the\r\ndevelopment partners would skew the review into one\r\naddressing SIDS-Millennium Development Goal\r\nperformance instead of SIDS performance on the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action. I believe that our\r\nconcern has to an extent been warranted and therefore\r\nmy delegation would like to use this opportunity to\r\nremind our partners that the review is about identifying\r\nand solving the failure of small island developing\r\nStates to accomplish agreed development programmes\r\nunder the Barbados Plan of 1994; and it’s about how\r\nyou, our development partners, can help SIDS to attain\r\nthose goals. It is therefore our sincere hope that the\r\nthird and critical round of negotiations scheduled in\r\nearly October will be conducted in the right spirit and\r\nwith better understanding.\r\nThe Pacific Islands Forum continues to be the\r\nvehicle for regional cooperation and collaboration\r\namong the 16 Pacific Island countries of the Central\r\nand Western Pacific. It approved the terms of reference\r\nfor the Pacific plan at the Apia Forum last month to\r\nrevitalize the Forum and to make it more effective in\r\nits response to the needs of the peoples of the region.\r\nIssues such as climate change, peace and security, the\r\neconomic and social development of our peoples and\r\nthe protection and sustainable use of the environment\r\nand our natural resources are still the priorities of the\r\nForum.\r\nNauru welcomes the admission of the Kingdom\r\nof Thailand as the thirteenth member of the Forum’s\r\ndialogue partners. That group of countries, along with\r\nthe European Union, individual member countries of\r\nthe EU and the United Nations specialized agencies\r\nand programmes, are critical to the development of the\r\nregion as they provide the necessary financial backing.\r\nDuring the session, cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Pacific Islands Forum will be\r\nconsidered under item 56 (q) of the General\r\nAssembly’s agenda. The Pacific Island Forum group at\r\nthe United Nations looks forward to working closely\r\nwith Member States to develop and expand the areas of\r\nits cooperation with them, pursuant to a draft\r\nresolution that will be presented to the Assembly in\r\ndue course.\r\nNauru, like the other low-lying small island\r\nStates, sees the Kyoto Protocol as its means of\r\nsalvation from the sea-level rise and climate change\r\nthat threaten to devastate its already fragile ecosystem,\r\nso essential to the livelihood and culture of its people.\r\nMy delegation understands that the Russian Federation\r\nstands between the Kyoto Protocol’s coming into force\r\nand its continuing to linger in the wilderness. Nauru\r\nwelcomes the statement by the Foreign Minister of the\r\nRussian Federation that President Putin has ordered\r\nserious consideration of Russia’s ratification of the\r\nProtocol. That is a step forward from last year.\r\nA healthy Pacific Ocean and the sustainable use\r\nof its natural resources, including the highly migratory\r\nfish stocks, are also critical to our livelihood. We in the\r\nPacific have “walked the walk” on those issues by the\r\ndevelopment of an ocean policy to guide us in the\r\nmanagement of our part of the Pacific Ocean and to\r\nform the framework for future regional ocean-related\r\ninitiatives. The Convention on the Conservation and\r\nManagement of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the\r\nWestern and Central Pacific Ocean, which provides a\r\ncomprehensive regime for the management of the\r\nregion’s highly migratory fish stock both in our\r\nexclusive economic zone and on the high seas, has\r\ncome into force. In addition, the trans-shipment of\r\nnuclear waste through our waters is of great concern to\r\nmany of the island countries because of the damage it\r\ncould cause.\r\nOne of the positive outcomes of the Pacific\r\nIslands Forum meeting last month was the decision of\r\nthe Forum leaders to intervene in the internal economic\r\ncrisis in Nauru at the request of our Government and\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nconsistent with the terms of reference of the Forum’s\r\nBiketawa Declaration of 2000. Our crisis lies largely in\r\nthe fact that two thirds of our workforce are in the\r\nemploy of the Government and its agencies. Those\r\nemployees have not been paid a regular salary for over\r\na year now. At irregular intervals either A$ 100 in food\r\nvouchers or A$ 30 to A$ 50 in cash to purchase food\r\nhas been paid out, compared with the basic wage of\r\nA$ 350 — or about US$ 250 — per fortnight. The\r\naverage family size on Nauru is around six people. A$\r\n50 cash fortnightly is equivalent to US$ 0.42 per\r\nfamily member per day and is well below the United\r\nNations-defined abject poverty level of US$ 1 a day.\r\nThe fact that many Nauruans can harvest food\r\nfrom the sea and the land, however limited, coupled\r\nwith our culture and tradition of sharing, has meant\r\nthat despite the lack of cash our people eat at least once\r\na day. The real problem concerns the level of daily\r\nnutritional intake, particularly for children, as one\r\ncannot buy imported commodities such as fruits and\r\nvegetables and hygienic supplies. The situation is\r\nexacerbated by the fact that Nauru imports 90 per cent\r\nof all food and other essential items. Accordingly, food\r\nsecurity in the medium to long term is a serious\r\nconcern as there is no form of agricultural activity on\r\nNauru.\r\nNauru’s recovery cannot be possible without the\r\nestablishment of reputable financial institutions on\r\nNauru and the lifting of the restrictions on financial\r\ntransactions between the international community and\r\nNauru. That will not happen if Nauru continues to be\r\nsubjected to countermeasures and blacklisting by the\r\nFinancial Action Task Force (FATF). Despite the\r\noutlawing of the registration of foreign banks some 12\r\nmonths ago, Nauru has not been successful in its\r\nappeal no longer to be the subject of countermeasures\r\nas a first step, although there has been incremental\r\nprogress towards that goal over the same period.\r\nFollowing the visit by the International Monetary Fund\r\nearly this year, Nauru has, for the fourth time, passed\r\nan anti-money-laundering law that now supersedes\r\nprevious laws. We have participated in FATF regional\r\nreviews but, despite strong support provided by actions\r\ntaken on advice, we seem to have failed at the plenary\r\nreview.\r\nAs I speak, the Parliament of Nauru is\r\nconsidering the passage of three bills addressing issues\r\nraised by the FATF: the counter-terrorism and\r\ntransnational organized crime bill, the proceeds of\r\ncrime bill and the mutual assistance in criminal matters\r\nbill. We are confident that the passage of those bills,\r\nthe prioritizing of related issues through the\r\nappointment of an anti-money-laundering national\r\ncoordinating committee — which also comprises the\r\nAustralian official appointed as secretary for\r\nfinance — and the coordinating committee’s face-to-\r\nface meeting with FATF’s Asia-Pacific Working Group\r\nin Brunei next week will bring us closer to our\r\nobjective of being de-listed. We will persevere, as we\r\nknow that, in the end, we will prevail.\r\nThe intervention by the Pacific Islands Forum is\r\nseen as pre-empting the possibility of the economic\r\ncrisis escalating into a security and safety issue for the\r\nNauruan people and for the region. Teams of regional\r\nexperts representing the Forum and Australia have\r\nvisited Nauru on a fact-finding mission, and we will be\r\nreporting to the leaders in due course, which will\r\ninclude recommendations on the type of assistance and\r\nthe manner in which it should be rendered. While the\r\nproposal, which is to be formally known as Pacific\r\nRegional Assistance to Nauru, is being finalized, the\r\nForum has agreed to provide, in the immediate future,\r\ncapacity-building assistance in the justice, judicial,\r\nfinancial audit and national planning sectors, as well as\r\ntransportation for the health and education sectors and\r\na small cash grant to assist with public-sector wages.\r\nThat assistance is complementing the aid\r\nprovided separately by Australia, which has deployed\r\nAustralian finance and treasury officials to head the\r\nNauru Department of Finance, and the deployment,\r\nnext month, of Australian police to take command of\r\nthe Nauru Police Force. Indeed, as I speak, the\r\nParliament of Nauru is also considering a reform\r\nbudget designed with the assistance of Australian\r\nfinance and treasury officials. That budget includes\r\nharsh but realistic measures as a preliminary but\r\ndecisive step towards stabilizing, and eventually\r\nrebuilding, the economy and society of Nauru.\r\nFor the same reasons, the Government of Nauru\r\nwrote to the Secretary-General in August of this year to\r\nalert him of the looming crisis in Nauru and to request\r\nassistance from the United Nations system to help to\r\nalleviate the plight of the Nauruan people. President\r\nLudwig Scotty and Foreign Minister David Adeang\r\nmay be visiting New York in the latter part of October\r\nto meet with the Secretary-General and relevant United\r\nNations bodies on this matter. My Government looks\r\nforward to receiving a positive response from the\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nUnited Nations system, in the same manner as it did\r\nfrom the Pacific Islands Forum.\r\nIn conclusion, the fifty-ninth session has critical\r\nwork ahead of it, such as the International Meeting for\r\nthe 10-year Review of the Barbados Programme of\r\nAction, the introduction and deliberation on the\r\nfindings of the High-Level Panel constituted by the\r\nSecretary-General, the review of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the\r\npreparations for the 5-year review of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and its Goals and the continuation of our\r\ndeliberations on the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly and of the reform of the Security Council, to\r\nname but a few items.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has stated, the United\r\nNations is at a fork in the road in terms of its relevance\r\nas an organization of nations seeking common\r\nsolutions to common problems. The next 12 months\r\nwill determine whether we, the united nations of the\r\nworld, continue on the road where “business as usual”\r\nis the mode of operation or whether we follow the road\r\nof multilateralism as the principal rule of our\r\nengagement. The statements thus far indicate the latter,\r\nbut we have heard that before.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): We have heard\r\nthe last speaker in the general debate for this meeting.\r\nNumerous representatives have asked to exercise\r\ntheir right of reply. I wish to remind representatives\r\nthat statements in exercise of the right of reply are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention, and to\r\nfive minutes for the second intervention, and should be\r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Mamadov (Azerbaijan): I am taking the\r\nfloor in exercise of rule 73 of the General Assembly’s\r\nrules of procedure.\r\nIn his speech last week, my President expressed\r\nhis views on a number of issues, including the problem\r\nof Nagorny Karabakh.\r\nArmenia has today once again abused this\r\nrostrum to make another allegation against my country\r\nin order to justify its aggressive and belligerent policy,\r\nwhich is in complete contradiction to, and in violation\r\nof, the Charter of the United Nations and international\r\nlaw.\r\nIt is not my country but Armenia that threatens\r\nthe fragile peace and stability of the region by its\r\ncontinued occupation of Nagorny Karabakh and seven\r\nadjacent Azerbaijani regions, in violation of the\r\nprovisions of Security Council resolutions 822 (1993),\r\n853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993). Those\r\nresolutions unequivocally confirm that Nagorny\r\nKarabakh is a part of Azerbaijan; decisively call for\r\nrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of\r\nAzerbaijan and its internationally recognized borders;\r\nunderline the inadmissibility of the use of force for the\r\nacquisition of territory; resolutely demand an\r\nimmediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of\r\noccupying forces from all occupied areas of Azerbaijan\r\nand call for the establishment of conditions for the safe\r\nreturn of displaced persons to their places of permanent\r\nresidence. By challenging the Security Council and\r\nignoring the will of the international community,\r\nArmenia’s policies, practices and statements — and\r\ntoday’s statement is proof of this — threaten the peace\r\nand stability of the region, which will lack prospects\r\nfor peace until and unless Armenia does away with its\r\nfalse historic and strategic propositions.\r\nThe next allegation deals with ethnic cleansing,\r\nmercenaries and international terrorists. Nothing could\r\nbe more cynical than that allegation in relation to a\r\ncountry that shelters over 1 million refugees.\r\nUnfortunately, Armenia’s historical memory is very\r\nselective. By the way, let me remind the foreign-born\r\nArmenian minister that it would have been good for\r\nhim to know, before he became involved in foreign\r\npolicy, that the neighbours of the country he is\r\nrepresenting are not “Azeris” but Azerbaijanis. Let me\r\nalso recall that the planned-in-advance expulsion of\r\nAzerbaijanis from Armenia began at the end of 1987,\r\nas a result of which 220 people were killed in Armenia,\r\nand 260,000 Azerbaijanis — let me stress,\r\nAzerbaijanis — who had for centuries resided in the\r\nterritory of present-day Armenia became refugees.\r\nArmenia thereby became the only mono-ethnic country\r\nfree of all minorities in the post-Soviet space.\r\nMoreover, Armenia carried out ethnic cleansing\r\nin the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. The\r\nculmination of that was the Khojaly massacre, in which\r\napproximately 1,000 innocent people were killed. That\r\nevent saw the first ethnic cleansing, the first\r\nassassinations and the first refugees in the Soviet\r\nspace, and it was Armenians who were responsible for\r\nthose crimes. The Armenian experience in ethnic\r\ncleansing worked. Although I agree with the statement\r\nthat terrorism is inexcusable and unacceptable, we\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nmust underscore that it is startling, at the very least,\r\nwhen such statements come from a Government that\r\nhas long harboured and exported terrorists.\r\nThe very notion of organized crime as a means of\r\nfurthering political demands was brought to life by\r\nArmenian nationalists at the end of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Armenian propaganda — a piece of which we\r\nwitnessed today — is contradicted by the principle that\r\nthe brighter a light is, the more easily it is snuffed out.\r\nThus, Armenia, despite its well-established record in\r\ninternational terrorism, tries to portray itself as a\r\nvictim of terrorism.\r\nWas it not the Government of Armenia that\r\norganized a series of terrorist attacks against\r\nAzerbaijan that resulted in the deaths of more than\r\n2,000 innocent civilians? Was it not the Government of\r\nArmenia that advocated the release of an international\r\nterrorist, Varoujan Garbidijan, who had been\r\nimprisoned in France for perpetrating a terrorist\r\nbombing at Orly airport? As a result of the Armenian\r\nGovernment’s efforts, Garbidijan was unfortunately\r\nreleased, receiving shelter nowhere but in Armenia,\r\nunder the patronage of the Armenian Government.\r\nAzerbaijan actively cooperates with international\r\norganizations that offer their mediation and assistance.\r\nAzerbaijan agreed to co-sponsor two proposals in\r\n1997, while Armenia rejected them.\r\nAs for the Key West document to which the\r\nArmenian Minister referred, we have stated on a\r\nnumber of occasions that there was no agreement at\r\nKey West. Contrary to the Armenian Minister’s\r\nallegation, Azerbaijan suggested that the Council of\r\nEurope send a mission to the region to monitor the\r\nsituation on the ground. Since it was not compelled to\r\ncomply with Security Council resolutions, Armenia, in\r\nan attempt to consolidate the occupation, has launched\r\na policy to settle massive numbers of Armenians in the\r\noccupied Azerbaijani territories. The situation is\r\ndeteriorating with the use of those territories for drug\r\ntrafficking, weapons transfers, the harbouring of\r\nterrorists and illegal economic activities, including\r\nsmuggling.\r\nArmenia also exploits the natural resources of the\r\noccupied Azerbaijani territories. Furthermore, Armenia\r\nfalsifies the history and misappropriates the cultural\r\nand architectural heritage of Nagorny Karabakh,\r\nanother occupied region of Azerbaijan. Religious and\r\nhistorical monuments, ancient manuscripts and other\r\ncultural properties have been destroyed, refashioned,\r\nplundered or removed.\r\nAnother allegation made by the Armenian\r\nMinister has to do with history, the misjudgement of\r\nwhich, in our case, is probably the most dangerous.\r\nThe Armenian Minister claims that the Armenian\r\npresence in this region has been long and extensive, no\r\nless than 2,000 years. But we have a different\r\nunderstanding of time and space. Among other than\r\nArmenian scholars, it is a well-known fact that,\r\naccording to ancient sources and contemporary\r\nliterature, Armenia was considered a geographical\r\nnotion and was situated far beyond the limits of the\r\nsouthern Caucasus. Just like the Armenian Minister, we\r\nare familiar with our neighbours, and the present-day\r\nArmenian State was established at the expense of the\r\nAzerbaijani territories.\r\nThere is only one point on which I am probably\r\nin agreement with the Armenian Minister, but with a\r\nslight correction. Yes, the Armenians and the\r\nAzerbaijanis were forcibly linked together, but it was\r\nnot in the twentieth century; it was in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, by the colonial Government’s compulsory\r\nsettlement of Armenians in the Azerbaijani territories.\r\nAzerbaijan is prepared to collaborate with\r\nArmenia once Armenia has evacuated the occupied\r\nterritories, has recognized the territorial integrity of\r\nAzerbaijan and has accepted the autonomous status of\r\nthe Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan. Under\r\nthose conditions, we can make history, work together\r\nfor the peace, security and prosperity of the southern\r\nCaucasus — where borders do not matter, but deeds\r\nand tolerance do — and come to terms with our past,\r\nwith our history and with the norms of international\r\nlaw.\r\nMr. Kaludjerović (Serbia and Montenegro): I\r\nregret that my first intervention before this body is in\r\nexercise of the right of reply. However, I must express\r\nmy delegation’s surprise at the statement made at the\r\n15th meeting this morning by His Excellency\r\nMr. Gábor Bródi, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Hungary, in which he voiced his concern over the\r\nhuman rights situation in Serbia and Montenegro. He\r\nstated, among other things, that “It is particularly\r\nalarming that the number of incidents perpetrated\r\nagainst the non-Serb population, including the\r\nHungarian community, is on the rise.”\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\nI would like to emphasize that the recent isolated\r\nand individual acts against our citizens of ethnic\r\nAlbanian origin in the Serbian province of Vojvodina\r\nare no more than that — isolated and individual\r\nincidents. That assessment was reaffirmed by the top\r\nofficials of both countries during the visit of the\r\nHungarian President, Mr. Ferenc Mádl, to Serbia and\r\nMontenegro two weeks ago. However, we fear that the\r\ntensions could be exacerbated by hostile reactions that\r\nare not warranted by the situation.\r\nMy Government is absolutely convinced that\r\nthose incidents will not undermine the traditionally\r\ngood relations between Serbs and Hungarians in this\r\nnorthern Serbian province or among other ethnic\r\ncommunities, approximately 30 of which live in the\r\nprovince, which is probably the most multi-ethnic\r\nregion in Europe. I would also like to assure the\r\nAssembly that my Government is determined to do its\r\nutmost to prevent the recurrence of such unfortunate\r\nevents. Among other things, my Government has\r\nalready undertaken necessary measures aimed at\r\nidentifying and bringing to justice the parties\r\nresponsible for those acts.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights —\r\nparticularly minority rights — and fundamental\r\nfreedoms is one of the top priorities of the Government\r\nof Serbia and Montenegro.\r\nMr. Cumberbach Miguén (Cuba) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): In its exercise of the right of reply, my\r\ndelegation regrets the role of judge of others that the\r\nCzech Republic has assumed for itself without being\r\nconcerned about the beam in its own eye. It would\r\nhave been more responsible for that delegation —\r\ninstead of listing countries with supposed problems for\r\nthe so-called defenders of human rights — to explain\r\nhow they will resolve the spectacular increase of\r\nprostitution in their society, where, according to\r\nreports, that trade is generating $100 million a year.\r\nNeither children nor the thousands of women whom the\r\nsyndicates enslave by controlling their passports and\r\nthreatening to report them to the migration authorities\r\nescape that cruel exploitation.\r\nThe Minister of the Interior of the Czech\r\nRepublic himself recognizes that more than 860\r\nbordellos operate in that country to satisfy the\r\ndeplorable sex market. It would have been more\r\nresponsible to explain how they are fighting those\r\nsyndicates, which are consuming all the nation’s\r\ninstitutions, controlling everything from the illicit trade\r\nin drugs and weapons to financial crime and, more\r\nrecently, penetrating the political parties.\r\nIndeed, it would have been more responsible to\r\nexplain what measures — if any — they have adopted\r\nto halt the advance of xenophobia and the onerous\r\ndiscrimination suffered in the Czech Republic by the\r\nRomani minority, which is practically confined to\r\nghettos similar to those that were once common in that\r\nregion of Europe some 60 years ago.\r\nIn view of its own situation, it would have been\r\nbetter for the Czech Government to worry about the\r\ngrave social problems facing its own people rather than\r\nattempt to pass hypocritical judgements about what\r\nhappens in other parts of the world.\r\nMrs. Grollová (Czech Republic): Let me briefly\r\ncomment on what my colleague from Cuba just said in\r\nreply to the statement of the Czech Foreign Minister.\r\nI have two remarks. First, the reply by our\r\ncolleague was apparently an overreaction to a simple\r\nstatement of fact — an overreaction which is often\r\nsymptomatic of a fear of change. My Minister’s\r\nstatement was nothing more than a very moderate\r\nexpression of sympathy for, and solidarity with, those\r\nbrave men and women in countries such as Cuba\r\nwhose only fault is that they hold views different from\r\nthe official propaganda and who, unlike the majority of\r\ntheir compatriots, have the courage to articulate their\r\nviews aloud, even if they are harassed and\r\ncriminalized.\r\nSecondly, when it comes to human rights,\r\nprobably no country in the world has a 100 per cent\r\nclean record. My own country is no exception, and, of\r\ncourse, measures to prevent such things also constitute\r\na very interesting topic for debate in the Third\r\nCommittee, for example.\r\nWhat makes the difference is how regimes deal\r\nwith these issues. One option is to honestly engage in\r\nresolving problems in a transparent manner and in the\r\ncontext of an open dialogue with fellow citizens and\r\nwith the respective international institutions, including\r\nmechanisms of the Human Rights Commission or other\r\ninternational human rights instruments.\r\nThe other option is to stick to rigid ideological\r\nschemes, closing the door to the international\r\ncommunity and further feeding the oppressive\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.16\r\ninstruments in the hopes that this will enable a regime\r\nthat has outlived its time to survive for another few\r\nyears.\r\nMy country and its Government have chosen the\r\nfirst option. All we wanted to accomplish through the\r\nministerial statement made in this forum was to\r\nencourage others to make the same choice. We know\r\nfrom our own experience that it is not easy, but,\r\nultimately, it could be very rewarding.\r\nMr. Cumberbach Miguén (Cuba) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I shall be brief, as it is not my delegation’s\r\nintention to take up more of the precious time of\r\ndelegations present in this Hall.\r\nI regret to have to remind the Czech\r\nrepresentative that those to whom she refers as\r\ndefenders of human rights are merely mercenaries in\r\nthe service of a foreign power which is seeking to\r\nsuffocate my country and my people through hunger\r\nand economic blockade.\r\nI must remind her that this is not the first time\r\nthat the Czech Republic has engaged in all manner of\r\nmanoeuvres against the Cuban revolution, in an\r\nattempt to discredit the achievements of its people. Our\r\ndelegation reserves the right to speak at greater length\r\non this point.\r\nOur people, guided by our party and our\r\nGovernment, will not allow its revolution and the\r\nachievements it has to its credit to be sullied by\r\nmercenaries in the service of a foreign power to which\r\nthe Government of the Czech Republic is providing\r\nsupport.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.50 p.m.\r\n"
