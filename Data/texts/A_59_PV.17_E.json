(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Jeremie Bonnelame,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\r\nSeychelles.\r\nMr. Bonnelame (Seychelles) (spoke in French):\r\nMy delegation, Sir, is delighted at seeing you presiding\r\nover this session of the General Assembly. We also\r\nwish to state the high esteem in which we hold the past\r\nPresident, Mr. Julian Hunte, of Saint Lucia, and for\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan.\r\nThe Seychelles, a small island country, is defined\r\nby the fact that it belongs to two regions — the Indian\r\nOcean and the African continent — and by the fact that\r\nit belongs to several linguistic and cultural areas.\r\nToday we wish to be an example of cohabitation of\r\nman and nature and an example of unity and cohesion\r\nwith our people. These two objectives are at the heart\r\nof our development plans.\r\nIn April of this year, Mr. James Michel succeeded\r\nMr. Albert Rene in the presidency of the Republic\r\nthrough a calm and proper political transition. The new\r\nPresident defends the same development philosophy,\r\ntaking into account, of course, changes on the world\r\nscene, and the economic needs that are inherent in\r\nstarting a new phase of our development. Thus, the\r\nPresident has assessed our difficulties and the options\r\navailable to us in different areas of our economy, such\r\nas the balance of payments, the debt burden, access\r\nunder reasonable terms to capital — and in this context\r\nwe are a middle-income country — access to markets,\r\nand so forth.\r\nTogether with the Bretton Woods institutions and\r\nour other customary partners, we have committed\r\nourselves to a progressive programme of adjustment\r\nand of giving new dynamics to our economy. Of\r\ncourse, we are progressing at our own pace, because\r\nwe remain a vulnerable economy, since we are a small\r\nisland country, isolated from markets.\r\nI would like to say a few words about the\r\nSeychelles’ commitment to the international\r\ncommunity. First of all, on the question of security, the\r\nfight against terrorism, money laundering and drug\r\ntrafficking are, in the Seychelles, subjects of\r\nprevention and deterrence. We are taking action to\r\ntackle the causes, the methods and the effects of these\r\ncriminal actions. The Seychelles has ratified all\r\ninternational conventions on drug trafficking, and we\r\nsupport all United Nations resolutions on the\r\nprevention and suppression of the financing of terrorist\r\nacts.\r\nWe support the recommendations of the Financial\r\nAction Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) and\r\nthe requirements of the Organization for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development (OECD) and the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF).\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nWe have enacted a law this year on the prevention\r\nof terrorism, and at the present time we are revising\r\nexisting legislation on financial institutions and on\r\nmoney laundering. I might add that our offshore sector\r\nis also being monitored in the framework of the\r\nimplementation of a law on the provision of services\r\nwhich was promulgated last year.\r\nWe are fully committed to the fight for security\r\nand stability. However, it is being done in difficult\r\nconditions, because the very questionable criterion of\r\ngross domestic product per capita blocks our access to\r\nmost development assistance programmes.\r\nA small and vulnerable State always attaches\r\nmore importance to recognition of its own identity and\r\nthe defence of its stability. We, therefore, unreservedly\r\nsupport the principles and objectives of global peace,\r\nsecurity and development that are embodied by the\r\nUnited Nations. We want the Organization to remain\r\nextremely active in its initiatives to restore peace,\r\nparticularly in the Middle East and in Africa, to all\r\nareas where conflicts today have become chronic and\r\nare steadily worsening.\r\nWe hope that the reorganization of the United\r\nNations, which is now under way, will make it possible\r\nfor it to be repositioned, on the basis of concrete\r\nactions and follow-up and monitoring mechanisms. We\r\nbelieve that the Security Council must be open to more\r\npermanent and non-permanent members, so that the\r\ndeveloped and developing countries of Africa, Asia\r\nand Latin America can contribute to the Council’s\r\ndynamics.\r\nMore than ever, a genuine North-South dialogue\r\nis essential to resolve conflicts and to seek shared\r\nsolutions to shared problems posed by AIDS, poverty,\r\ndebt and terrorism — all threats that require a joint\r\nresponse and shared responsibilities. This dialogue\r\nrequires new ethics and a new approach to\r\ndevelopment, which revitalizes international relations\r\nand corrects injustices. It is particularly important to\r\ndeal with the roots of the debt problem and to adopt\r\nenergetic measures in order to assist those States whose\r\ndevelopment is stymied by this burden.\r\nWe welcome the exchanges between the Group of\r\nEight and the developing countries. This is a\r\nnegotiating platform that should have brought about\r\nconcrete action and implementation of the\r\nrecommendations of the Millennium Summit, and\r\nthose of Monterrey, Johannesburg and Doha. It is\r\nparticularly important that the allocation by the\r\ndeveloped countries of 0.7 per cent of their gross\r\nnational product to international development should\r\nbe seen and accepted as a realistic and fair objective.\r\nWe expect the meeting to be held in Mauritius at\r\nthe beginning of 2005, ten years after the adoption of\r\nthe Barbados Programme of Action, to produce an\r\nuncompromising assessment of the Programme’s\r\nimplementation and to adopt operational measures and\r\nmechanisms. We are counting on the active\r\ncommitment of our partners for that assessment and its\r\nfollow-up.\r\nSupport and commitment should be expressed in\r\nthe area of international trade through equitable\r\ntreatment towards developing countries that have\r\nstructural weaknesses, such as small island developing\r\nStates. Such arrangements must take into account the\r\ndelicate issues of access to markets and trade relations.\r\nThe goal is to prevent our countries from becoming\r\nfurther marginalized in a system that claims to be in\r\nthe interest of all. That is why we invite the World\r\nTrade Organization to adopt an approach to\r\ndevelopment that is consistent with the developments\r\nof recent years. I am referring to the launch of the\r\nDoha round, devoted explicitly to development, and to\r\nthe assertion of an African voice on sensitive issues\r\nsuch as commodities and raw materials. The new trade\r\nrelations must also enable developing countries to\r\ncontinue to acquire the means to be more competitive.\r\nAnother urgent matter for us, the countries most\r\nvulnerable to the consequences of global warming, is\r\nthe ratification by all developed countries of the Kyoto\r\nProtocol. It is the only instrument capable of acting\r\neffectively with respect to a danger of concern to all.\r\nWe believe that a special fund should be\r\nestablished in the United Nations to help fragile\r\neconomies confront losses, including loss of income,\r\ncaused by climate change.\r\nI reaffirm the importance we attach to the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)\r\nbecause it is one of the best tools for enabling African\r\ncountries to manage their own development. We\r\nappreciate the commitment of the Group of Eight in\r\nthis regard through its African Action Plan, and it is\r\nour heartfelt hope that NEPAD’s development agenda\r\nwill comprehensively address the specific needs of the\r\neight African island States.\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nAll these questions are of capital importance\r\ntoday. We hope that the British presidency of the\r\nGroup of Eight in 2005 and the United Nations summit\r\nto review the Millennium Development Goals, also\r\nscheduled for 2005, will work a very clear rebalancing\r\nin favour of our countries.\r\nSeychelles reaffirms its support for the General\r\nAssembly, and we thank you, Mr. President, for your\r\npersonal action. We also thank Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan. My country is an advocate of the cause of\r\ndevelopment, which is a fundamental right. That right\r\nentails the obligation of political solidarity in the most\r\nactive sense of the term.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Fathulla Jameel, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Maldives.\r\nMr. Jameel (Maldives): First, let me extend to\r\nyou, Mr. President, my delegation’s warmest\r\ncongratulations on your election to preside over the\r\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. My delegation has\r\nevery confidence in your sagacity to guide this session\r\nand its deliberations to a fruitful conclusion.\r\nIt is also my pleasure to pay tribute to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Robert Hunte, for the\r\ncommendable manner in which he discharged his\r\nresponsibilities as the President at the fifty-eighth\r\nsession.\r\nAs well, I wish to take this opportunity to\r\ncompliment the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on\r\nhis diligence in promoting peace and pursuing the\r\nnoble principles of this Organization. My delegation\r\nsincerely wishes him every success in his daunting\r\ntask.\r\nThe unfolding international events bring to the\r\nfore the question of multilateralism and the vital role\r\nthe United Nations has to play in addressing global\r\ncrises and problems and in promoting a world order\r\nbased on the rule of law and the collective\r\nresponsibility of all nations and communities.\r\nThe global challenges that we face today are\r\nnumerous. While goals are set and programmes\r\nlaunched for eradicating poverty, achieving universal\r\nprimary education, promoting gender equality,\r\nreducing child mortality, fighting HIV/AIDS and\r\nprotecting the environment, hundreds of innocent lives\r\nare lost every day as a result of conflict and civil war.\r\nTerrorism has not been defeated. On the contrary,\r\nit is re-emerging in uglier manifestations in the most\r\nunexpected places, killing innocent people, including\r\nchildren. The disappointing impasse on global\r\ndisarmament and the dreadful odds of further\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction make us\r\nill at ease and cause us to lose hope for a peaceful\r\nworld.\r\nWe in small States feel more vulnerable to these\r\nchallenges and threats, as our security is entirely\r\ndependent on the prevalence of global security and the\r\nobservance of the rule of law by all States. Clearly, the\r\nconcerns of small States cannot be confined only to the\r\nissues of the environment, climate change, sea-level\r\nrise and sustainable development. The ominous threats\r\nthat are emerging on the political and security fronts of\r\nthe contemporary world have far-reaching implications\r\nfor us as well.\r\nNot too infrequently, we witness small States\r\nbeing victimized by non-State actors such as terrorists,\r\nmercenaries, insurrectionary gangs and organized\r\ncrime networks, whose calculated assaults disrupt\r\nsocio-economic and political development of small\r\nStates, endangering peace and security. It would be\r\nimprudent to ignore the wider implications of the\r\npresence and activities of such perilous actors on\r\ninternational peace and security. Solutions to those\r\nthreats can only be sought through international\r\ncooperation, vigilance and timely action.\r\nIt is imperative that the international community\r\ntakes on the crucial responsibility of protecting the\r\nsecurity of small States, as stipulated by General\r\nAssembly resolutions 44/51, of 8 December 1989,\r\n46/43, of 9 December 1991, and 49/31, of 9 December\r\n1994. With its global spread and ability to work in\r\ncollaboration with regional institutions, we see the\r\nOrganization as the most appropriate body to address\r\nsuch issues.\r\nTerrorism poses grave threats to regional as well\r\nas international peace and security. The train bombings\r\nin Madrid; car bombings and terrorist attacks in Iraq,\r\nIndonesia and Saudi Arabia; and, most recently, the\r\nhostage-taking tragedy in a Russian school, are all grim\r\nreminders of the particularly insidious nature of\r\nterrorism. I am sure that I echo the unanimity of the\r\ninternational community in reiterating that the war\r\nagainst terrorism should continue to remain a principal\r\npriority on the international agenda. My Government\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nbelieves that early adoption of the proposed\r\ninternational convention on terrorism would be a\r\ncrucial step in effectively combating that dreadful\r\nmenace.\r\nExpanding globalization and increasing trade\r\nliberalization, contrary to the hopes for a healthier\r\nglobal market, have had a distressing price tag for\r\nsmall economies, especially for small island economies\r\nsuch as the Maldives. Limited natural resources and the\r\nnarrow economic base of small island economies\r\nseverely restrict their scope for diversification and their\r\nability to attract foreign investment. Those\r\ndisadvantages call for special considerations, including\r\na level of preferential treatment, on an exceptional\r\nbasis, to ensure the sustainable development of small\r\nisland developing States.\r\nWhile the Maldives is beset by the entire range of\r\neconomic problems inherent to small island developing\r\nStates, the recommendation by the Committee for\r\nDevelopment Policy (CDP) to graduate us from the list\r\nof least developed countries has compounded the\r\nchallenges to our development. We do take pride in our\r\nachievements in the social and economic sectors during\r\nthe last two decades. However, we fear that graduation\r\nmay cause enormous and irreparable damage to our\r\neconomy, in the absence of a suitable mechanism to\r\nensure sustained socio-economic development. In that\r\ncontext, we welcome the recommendation of the CDP\r\nand the decision of the Economic and Social Council\r\nearlier this year indicating the need to formulate\r\nsmooth transition strategies for least developed\r\ncountries prior to their graduation.\r\nWe support in particular the recommendation to\r\ndecide post-graduation transition arrangements on a\r\ncase-by-case basis and to establish ad hoc country\r\nadvisory groups to help formulate those arrangements.\r\nWe strongly feel that it is important for the Economic\r\nand Social Council to formally endorse the\r\narrangements proposed by the ad hoc country advisory\r\ngroups while mandating the CDP with the task of\r\nmonitoring the progress of newly graduated countries\r\nfor any disruptions in their development.\r\nAllow me, at this juncture, to register our sincere\r\ngratitude and appreciation to our development partners\r\nand the members of the Group of 77, the Group of\r\nLeast Developed Countries and the Bureau and\r\nmembers of the Economic and Social Council for the\r\nunderstanding and the care with which they are\r\nproceeding on this crucial and important issue.\r\nThe state of the global environment is as\r\ndepressing as ever. Statistical information and\r\nprojections are alarming and disturbing, not only to\r\nsmall island developing States but also to the entire\r\ninternational community. Those figures and predictions\r\nreveal the severity of environmental problems and the\r\npotential threats to human existence unless swift\r\nremedial measures are implemented.\r\nThe frequency with which we have been\r\nwitnessing natural disasters such as hurricanes and\r\ncyclones around the world demonstrates the urgent\r\nneed to tackle environmental issues on a global scale.\r\nMany small island developing States suffer\r\ndisproportionately from such hazards, underscoring the\r\nvulnerability of small island developing States in that\r\nregard. As we recently witnessed in Grenada, a single\r\nhurricane can lay waste to decades-long developmental\r\nprogress in a matter of a few hours.\r\nWe will soon be meeting in Mauritius to review\r\nthe progress made over the past decade in the\r\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action\r\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nStates. If we are to make the forthcoming meeting in\r\nMauritius a success, we need to muster the necessary\r\npolitical will to channel resources and to ensure the\r\ncomprehensive realization of the objectives of the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action.\r\nThe complexity and magnitude of ever-\r\ndeveloping global challenges demand that a reformed\r\nUnited Nations be assigned the central role in dealing\r\nwith them. While those reforms should cover the entire\r\nUnited Nations system and its bodies, the focus is once\r\nagain justly being drawn to the urgency of the need to\r\nrestructure the Security Council, making the Council\r\nmore reflective of the realities of the present-day world\r\nand more representative of the capacity and\r\ncommitment of Member States to contribute to\r\ninternational peace and security. It is disappointing,\r\nthough, that no common view has emerged on that\r\nissue. We feel that we should go ahead with the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council, both in the\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories and including\r\nin that enlargement countries such as Japan and other\r\nMember States that have the capacity and the\r\ncommitment to serve as permanent members and that\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nwould represent the wider membership of the present-\r\nday United Nations.\r\nThe international treaty regime has to be\r\nexpanded and strengthened so that emerging problems\r\ncan be dealt with more effectively. We feel that that\r\ntask should be a priority in enforcing the principles for\r\nwhich the United Nations stands and the values of\r\npeace, security, justice, equality, human rights,\r\ndemocracy and rules-based international order that it\r\nhas advocated. In that context, we applaud the remarks\r\nmade by the Secretary-General at the opening meeting\r\nof the General Assembly, and wish to express our\r\nsupport for his efforts to reform the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nThe rapid socio-economic development attained\r\nby the Maldives in the past two and a half decades is in\r\nno small part grounded in the political stability that we\r\nhave enjoyed during that period. To emphasize further\r\nthe need to promote and sustain the values of\r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights, President\r\nGayoom proposed a sweeping agenda for political\r\nreform in early June of this year. The Government\r\nremains firmly committed to carry out the reform\r\nagenda, which has been welcomed and supported by\r\nboth the people of the country and its friends in the\r\ninternational community. A special people’s assembly\r\nwas convened, as required by the Constitution, and was\r\ncharged with the task of debating reforms to the current\r\nConstitution proposed by the Government and civil\r\nsociety.\r\nWe seek the support and assistance of our friends\r\nin the international community in our pursuit of that\r\nunprecedented reform agenda. The solidarity of the\r\ninternational community at this crucial hour of need\r\nwould reinforce our resolve and help us move ahead\r\nwith the reform agenda with increased veracity and\r\ndiligence.\r\nMy Government is also committed to respecting\r\nand observing human rights through adherence to\r\nrelevant international conventions. In that regard, I am\r\npleased to announce that the Maldives will this week\r\nsign a framework agreement with the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross. We will also keep under\r\nconsideration the signing of other important\r\ninstruments, such as the Rome Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court.\r\nBefore concluding, I should like to reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to the principles enshrined in the Charter.\r\nMy country believes this Organization to be the best\r\nsuited to working for the betterment of humanity and\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I give the floor\r\nto His Excellency The Honourable Frederick Mitchell,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Public Service of the\r\nCommonwealth of the Bahamas.\r\nMr. Mitchell (Bahamas): It is my honour to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on behalf of the Prime Minister,\r\nthe Government and the people of the Commonwealth\r\nof the Bahamas, on your election to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I would\r\nalso like to take this opportunity to congratulate your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, of our sister Caribbean\r\nState of Saint Lucia, for his outstanding leadership\r\nduring the fifty-eighth session. His legacy is one of\r\nwhich we in the Caribbean can be proud, and we wish\r\nhim well in his future endeavours.\r\nI would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his stalwart defence of multilateralism and\r\nthe rule of law.\r\nHurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne\r\nhave ravaged the Caribbean islands and parts of the\r\nUnited States. Lives were lost in Haiti, the Dominican\r\nRepublic, Grenada, Jamaica, Cuba, the United States\r\nand the Bahamas. The damage to homes and\r\ninfrastructure and the interruption to normal life and\r\ncommerce compel us to stress the need for immediate\r\nand dramatic measures to ensure reconstruction and\r\nrehabilitation. What has been on offer to the region so\r\nfar is woefully inadequate.\r\nOur country’s northern islands — Grand Bahama\r\nand Abaco — received double hits. First, Hurricane\r\nFrances struck on 13 September, leaving hundreds\r\nwithout food, water, homes and power. Then came\r\nJeanne, two weeks later, over the same islands that\r\nwere hit by Frances, further exacerbating the problems.\r\nThe Bahamas has many islands and, fortunately for us,\r\ntourism facilities remain open in the capital, Nassau,\r\nand facilities on other islands in the chain will be\r\noperational shortly. That, unfortunately, will not be the\r\ncase in Grenada.\r\nRegional heads have called for an international\r\ndonor conference to meet the needs of all countries\r\nadversely affected by the hurricanes. The Bahamas\r\nsupports such a conference. We hope that, as a result of\r\nthat conference, if not before, there will be a\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nmoratorium on Grenada’s debt repayment. We also\r\nrecommend that a regional disaster relief fund be\r\nestablished to support the reconstruction effort.\r\nThe word “hurricane” comes from a word first\r\nused by the indigenous people of the Caribbean region,\r\nthe Arawaks. That pre-Columbian civilization must\r\nhave seen the phenomenon so often that it invented the\r\nword for it. That means it has been around for some\r\ntime, and it is likely to be with us for some time to\r\ncome. It behooves us, therefore, to understand the\r\nphenomenon that we are facing, including its\r\nconnection — if any — to climate change, which low-\r\nlying States have been warning about for years. These\r\nfacts also demand that our own societies should better\r\nplan for the eventualities that have been, and that we\r\nknow are going to continue to be, a part of our lives.\r\nWe cannot let lack of planning be a possible cause of\r\nthe undermining of our sovereignty in this way.\r\nThe world is soon wary and weary; the\r\nphenomenon of donor fatigue sets in. And we lose our\r\ndignity if we cannot be seen to help ourselves. But if,\r\nas the scientific evidence suggests, the hurricanes that\r\nwe now experience are related to climate change, it is\r\nclear that we cannot defend ourselves alone. A major\r\nshift on the part of the most active polluting countries\r\nis required. They must shift gears if the people in small\r\nisland developing States are going to survive. It is a\r\nmoral imperative for them to shift gears.\r\nIn this regard, the Bahamas welcomes the\r\npreliminary moves by the Government of Britain, as\r\nwell as the Governments of Japan and of Russia,\r\ntowards putting climate change closer to the top of the\r\nagenda. We urge them to continue to use their\r\ninfluence on their friends to cause a major shift in\r\nattitude. The implementation of the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development\r\nof Small Island Developing States, adopted at the\r\nGlobal Conference in Barbados in 1994, becomes even\r\nmore urgent. The follow-up meeting on this issue in\r\nMauritius in January 2005 now takes on even greater\r\nsignificance.\r\nIn this context, I would also like to highlight the\r\nregion’s efforts to designate the Caribbean Sea as a\r\nspecial area in the context of sustainable development.\r\nWe also reiterate our grave concern about the serious\r\nthreat posed to the security and economic development\r\nof Caribbean countries by the trans-shipment of\r\nnuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea. We continue\r\nto call on States involved in trans-shipment to desist\r\nfrom that practice.\r\nThe scenes of death and destruction as a result of\r\nthe hurricane that affected Haiti in recent days\r\nreminded us of the political turmoil that that country\r\nhas endured during the past year. The Bahamas extends\r\nits deepest condolences to the Haitian nation for the\r\ntremendous and sad loss of life. The year, which began\r\nwith so much hope with the celebration of the deeds of\r\nToussaint L’Ouverture and the two hundredth\r\nanniversary of independence on 1 January, fell quickly\r\ninto the abyss of despair on the fateful evenings of\r\n28 and 29 February. No one will ever know what truly\r\nhappened on that night as an elected President left his\r\ncountry with armed rebels nipping at his heels, but it\r\nfilled the entire Caribbean with sadness. It raised the\r\nspectre of mistrust of friends. That feeling has still not\r\ndied, but we must soldier on if we are to help the\r\npeople of Haiti achieve democracy, economic uplift\r\nand a just and fair society.\r\nThe Bahamas stands ready to do what it can to\r\nassist the people of Haiti in these developments. Haiti\r\nsits 90 miles from our southern shores, and each year\r\nthousands of migrants looking for a better way of life\r\nseek to enter the Bahamas illegally from Haiti. We\r\nhave practical reasons, therefore, to ensure that justice\r\nand democracy prevail in Haiti. We echo the call of all\r\ncountries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\r\nfor the return to democratic order in Haiti, and we\r\npledge to help.\r\nWe regret the failure of the Security Council to\r\nact in a timely fashion when Haiti’s friends begged for\r\nthe authority to intervene or to authorize an\r\nintervention. Perhaps that failure heralds the need for\r\nthe Council’s reform. The Bahamas supports such\r\nreform efforts and awaits the report of the High-Level\r\nPanel appointed by the Secretary-General. But the\r\nUnited Nations must never stop trying to address the\r\nissues that face Haiti, because there is a moral\r\nimperative to eliminate hunger, poverty, disease and\r\ndiscrimination. In this regard, we welcome the work of\r\nPresident Lula da Silva of Brazil and President Chirac\r\nof France, Pope John Paul and other world leaders in\r\nseeking to ensure that the moral imperatives to which\r\nwe have referred are placed at the forefront of the\r\nworld’s agenda. We must never forget what Haiti has\r\ndone for our region and for the world.\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nWhile the fight against those who would subvert\r\nour democratic values by attacks on civilian and\r\nmilitary targets remains high on our agenda, we must\r\nnot allow the drums of war to drown out the calls of\r\nthe world’s poor and disenfranchized. In 2000, we gave\r\nourselves a set of goals with respect to development\r\nwith a human face, and we must do all that we can to\r\nachieve them. The Bahamas has committed itself to the\r\nfight. We offer our heartfelt condolences to the\r\nsurvivors of all who have lost their lives in such\r\nsenseless attacks, particularly in the United States,\r\nKenya, Spain, Tanzania and Indonesia. But we also\r\nadmonish all States that terrorism cannot be an excuse\r\nto limit freedom and to dispense with the very liberties\r\nthat we are trying to defend and that form the\r\nfoundations of free and democratic societies.\r\nAll States ought to act with caution in putting in\r\nplace rules and regulations for travel, lest the denial of\r\nthose rights cannot be defended by logic or objectivity.\r\nThat is especially so where we note that developed\r\ncountries argue in favour of free trade and\r\nglobalization but deny the benefits of that trade to\r\nlegitimate travellers by administrative discrimination\r\nand bureaucratic procedures and delay. The appeal\r\ntherefore is to bring some sense of balance, before we\r\nlose the very thing we seek to save.\r\nAs part of this overall process of reflection, my\r\ndelegation welcomes the high-level reviews planned\r\nfor 2005 of our commitments with respect to social\r\ndevelopment and the advancement of women. We must\r\nensure that we undertake an unflinching examination\r\nof the progress made in achieving the priority goals of\r\nthe Copenhagen Programme of Action and the Beijing\r\nPlatform for Action to determine how far we have\r\ncome and what remains to be done. It is critical that the\r\noutcomes of the respective appraisals will acknowledge\r\nthe gaps in implementation and allow States and the\r\ninternational community as a whole to move forward\r\nand achieve the timely and effective implementation of\r\nthe commitments undertaken at Copenhagen, Beijing\r\nand beyond. We must also make certain that the results\r\nof our deliberations feed constructively and\r\nsynergistically into the high-level event in September\r\n2005, so as to ensure that no ground is left uncovered.\r\nHIV/AIDS continues to threaten to undermine\r\ndecades and centuries of progress in health care and in\r\ndeveloping healthy populations that facilitate economic\r\ngrowth throughout the world. The Bahamas is a leader\r\nin the fight against HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean region.\r\nWe urge the continued and unrelenting fight against the\r\ndisease, to rescue the world’s developing nations from\r\nthe clutches of that scourge. It must take all of the\r\npolitical will and financial power of the world’s nations\r\nto ensure that the scourge is brought under control and\r\nthen eliminated.\r\nIn that context, the Bahamas welcomes the recent\r\ngrant to the Pan-Caribbean Partnership from the Global\r\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. That\r\ngrant will provide a much-needed infusion of resources\r\nfor prevention, care and treatment programmes. The\r\nBahamas also welcomes the convening of the June\r\n2005 high-level meeting to review the progress\r\nachieved in realizing the commitments set out in the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. The\r\nBahamas acknowledges the pledge made by the United\r\nStates to set aside $15 billion to fight HIV/AIDS\r\nthroughout the world, including in Haiti and Guyana in\r\nthe Caribbean region.\r\nIt is an inescapable fact that there can be no\r\nmeaningful social or economic development without\r\nsecurity. For many of us in the Caribbean in particular,\r\nthat security is being undermined by the activities of\r\nthose trafficking in illicit drugs, illegal weapons and\r\nundocumented aliens. By virtue of its geographical\r\nlocation, the Bahamas is an unwitting transit point for\r\nsuch illegal activities. In the case of illicit drugs, the\r\nBahamas is neither a producer nor the final destination\r\nfor them. However, as a trans-shipment point, the\r\nBahamas, as do other transit countries, experiences the\r\nillegal activities associated with that trade. Those\r\nactivities tend to undermine the economic and social\r\nfabric of our nations.\r\nWe therefore welcomed the convening in June\r\n2004 of the first session of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup to Negotiate an International Instrument to\r\nEnable States to Identify and Trace in a Timely Manner\r\nIllicit Small Arms and Light Weapons, some of the\r\ntools undermining our safety and security and our\r\neconomic and social fabric. That meeting was a small,\r\nbut important, first step in reaching agreement on an\r\ninstrument on tracing, to enable States affected by that\r\nillicit trade to more effectively identify lines of supply,\r\nput measures in place to interdict existing lines and\r\nprevent new ones, and to cooperate with other States at\r\nthe bilateral, regional and international levels. At the\r\nsame time, we continue to call on developed countries\r\nto take the same extraordinary measures they use in\r\nseeking to stop drug trafficking into their countries to\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nstop illegal small arms from reaching our shores from\r\ntheir countries.\r\nThe Bahamas joins with other countries of the\r\nCaribbean Community in voicing our concern about\r\nthe persistent attempts on the part of some of the\r\ndeveloped world’s un-elected multilateral bodies to\r\nexclude developing countries from decision-making\r\nand norm-setting processes, thereby undermining our\r\neconomies. Chief among those is the Organization for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development. The\r\ndecisions of those bodies are not friendly acts. We\r\nrepeat the call we made last year about the need for a\r\nglobal forum to deal with those unfair practices.\r\nWe welcome the work that has been done in the\r\nEconomic and Social Council to redress the imbalance\r\nin favour of a level playing field. The arrangements for\r\ndealing with international tax matters in particular are\r\na source of concern. We pledge to continue to work\r\nwith the United Nations towards establishing a world\r\nbody that will deal with those matters in a fair and\r\nbalanced way.\r\nYesterday I was in our capital city, Nassau, in the\r\nBahamas, where we marked 275 years of continuous\r\nrepresentative, parliamentary democracy. This, then, is\r\na propitious time to reaffirm the commitment of the\r\nBahamas to the principles enshrined in the Charter of\r\nthis great Organization, which will stand as a guiding\r\nbeacon as we continue to chart a rocky, yet crucial,\r\ncourse towards peace, security and sustainable\r\ndevelopment for all the world’s inhabitants. While\r\nprogress may seem meagre, we must not be swayed\r\nfrom our course and we must remain confident that the\r\nbenefits of our activities and efforts will redound to\r\nfuture generations. I say again that, now more than\r\never, the world needs the United Nations.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Talbak Nazarov, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Tajikistan.\r\nMr. Nazarov (Tajikistan) (spoke in Russian): We\r\nall pinned great hopes on the advent of the twenty-first\r\ncentury with regard to a more stable and secure world\r\nand sustainable development for humanity. We were all\r\neager to expand the positive achievements of the\r\ntwentieth century, which witnessed rapid technological\r\nand social progress, the beginning of the space age, the\r\nadvancement of democracy and the globalization of the\r\nplanet. We all wanted to leave behind the destructive\r\nimpact on human history of two world wars, continued\r\nblood conflicts, millions of refugees, poverty and the\r\ndestitution common in most countries of the world.\r\nIt had seemed that, at this junction of centuries\r\nand millennia, humanity would rediscover and\r\nappreciate more deeply the value of a world without\r\nwars or violence and the significance of solidarity and\r\nmutual understanding, of true human rights and respect\r\nof the views of others. Now, however, it has become\r\nclear that it is impossible to comprehend the dynamics\r\nof global development or to find adequate answers to\r\nmodern challenges without the United Nations as a\r\nleader.\r\nThe impression had been that, in the new century,\r\nour civilization would embark on the path towards a\r\nglobal society where harmony would prevail over\r\nhatred and stability put an end to suspicion — a society\r\nwhere the agreed rules of conduct set out in\r\ninternational law, binding for all, would stand in the\r\nway of isolationism and separatism; where all\r\ninternationally relevant issues, including the most\r\nurgent ones, would be resolved at the negotiating table;\r\nand where the use of force would not be the rule but,\r\nrather, the exception, and only when sanctioned by\r\ncollective decisions of a capable and representative\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nUnfortunately, the twenty-first century has\r\nbrought more new and menacing challenges than\r\nsolutions to the numerous problems faced by\r\nhumankind. The number of wars and military conflicts\r\nhas not diminished but increased. The peaceful\r\nresolution of the inter-Tajik conflict achieved under\r\nUnited Nations auspices is more the exception than the\r\nrule in the context of the efforts to achieve peace\r\nundertaken by the United Nations.\r\nThe world’s peoples increasingly feel that the\r\nworld is in a state of permanent war rather than\r\nworking towards development. Every day we hear\r\nabout the dangers of the proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction and the struggle against international\r\nterrorism. These are urgent problems, and we cannot\r\nbut be concerned about them since weapons of mass\r\ndestruction are capable of destroying hundreds of\r\nthousands of human lives, while acts of terror can\r\ndestabilize entire countries.\r\nFor those reasons, we are firmly resolved to\r\ntransform Central Asia into a region free of nuclear\r\nweapons. The recent tragic events in the town of\r\nBeslan, in the Russian Federation, are clear evidence\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nthat the forces of international terrorism are, day by\r\nday, becoming more daring and continue to challenge\r\nthe whole of humankind.\r\nTajikistan resolutely condemns the acts of\r\nviolence perpetrated against defenceless women and\r\nchildren in North Ossetia and appeals to the\r\ninternational community to undertake urgent collective\r\nmeasures to combat this scourge of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nIt is comforting that the international solidarity\r\ndemonstrated in the struggle against such a\r\nbloodthirsty and treacherous enemy as terrorism is\r\ngaining in strength. Tajikistan has been actively\r\nwaging, at the regional and international levels, a\r\nmultifaceted struggle against the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and terrorism.\r\nAt the same time, in order to definitively put an\r\nend to terrorism, it is very important to reach a\r\nuniversal understanding of its nature and\r\nmanifestations in order to eliminate any obstacles that\r\nstand in the way of the development and adoption of a\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\r\nWhile we can rightly be proud of having created,\r\nwithin a short period of time, a united anti-terrorist\r\ncoalition of States, unfortunately we cannot say that we\r\nhave achieved the same degree of solidarity in the fight\r\nagainst poverty and destitution.\r\nFor decades, States with low levels of income\r\nhave not been able to free themselves from their\r\ndestructive debt burden so as to be able to enjoy the\r\nadvantages of civilization. For instance, Tajikistan,\r\nwhich lived through a civil conflict, continues to face\r\nurgent economic and social problems, despite having\r\nmade some economic progress. Eighty per cent of the\r\npopulation of Tajikistan still lives below the poverty\r\nline. Because of the lack of access to the sea, many\r\nregions of our country are cut off from the outside\r\nworld, which results in our paying higher prices for\r\nimported goods and increased transit fees. Forty per\r\ncent of all budget revenues go to servicing external\r\ndebt, which limits the Government’s capacity to meet\r\nthe urgent needs of the population.\r\nWriting off a portion of the accumulated debt\r\nwould make it possible for those countries to invest in\r\neducation, health care and environmental protection,\r\nand, in the case of Tajikistan, could be helpful in\r\nrehabilitating the social sphere, which has suffered as a\r\nresult of the civil conflict and natural disasters.\r\nHowever, the idea of exchanging debt for sustainable\r\ndevelopment has not yet garnered solid support among\r\ncreditors. In that area, we still encounter inertia and a\r\nlack of political will.\r\nIt is clear to us that the resolution of political\r\nissues, including those related to international security,\r\ndepends, to a great extent, on social and economic\r\ndevelopment and on the achievement by all countries\r\nof the Millennium Goals.\r\nIn a globalized world, achieving the Millennium\r\nGoals will require the utmost solidarity as well as\r\ninteraction among the international community as a\r\nwhole, with the United Nations as a leading\r\ncoordinator, in its capacity as the most universal and\r\nrepresentative international Organization.\r\nThe key to success lies in developing a common\r\nand comprehensive approach to addressing poverty-\r\nrelated issues, enhancing the means available as well as\r\nseeking innovative ways of securing financing for\r\ndevelopment, eliminating ecological threats,\r\naddressing demographic problems, ensuring an\r\nequitable international finance and trade system, and\r\ndealing with the aftermath of natural disasters. Failing\r\nthat, the situation will remain the same: a quarter of the\r\nworld’s population will continue to prosper, using more\r\nthan half of the world’s resources, while the majority\r\nof the world’s population, finding themselves\r\nmarginalized, will remain mere observers of global\r\neconomic development.\r\nThe ever-increasing severity of these problems\r\nmakes them global threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity. For that reason, we support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Kofi Annan, in his efforts to restore the\r\nbalance of priorities on the agenda of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe international community should also strive to\r\nensure maximum coordination of the actions taken at\r\nthe global level in terms of monetary, financial and\r\ninternational trade policies. In that connection, it is\r\nimportant to strengthen the role of the United Nations\r\nas the key force for political mobilization in those\r\nareas. That requires, on the basis of the Monterrey\r\nconsensus, a further reinforcement of the interaction\r\namong the United Nations, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization, which\r\nTajikistan hopes to join in the near future.\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nThe issues of economic rehabilitation, poverty\r\neradication, improved living standards for the\r\npopulation and long-term sustainable development are\r\namong the top priorities for Tajikistan, as an economy\r\nin transition.\r\nAt the same time, for a number of reasons,\r\nTajikistan still needs the assistance of the international\r\ncommunity in supporting national efforts to ensure\r\nlong-term sustainable development in the country. We\r\nappreciate the continued efforts of the donor countries\r\nand United Nations agencies such as the United\r\nNations Development Programme, the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund, the World Food Programme and\r\nothers to assist vulnerable segments of the population,\r\nas well as their support in the ongoing transition to a\r\nsocially oriented market economy.\r\nGiven our own experience, we support the\r\npriority attention given by the United Nations to\r\nincreasing the effectiveness of the assistance rendered\r\nto countries in post-conflict situations and to receiving\r\nfeedback in that area. There is no doubt that the United\r\nNations is the key player in providing timely and\r\ncoordinated responses to post-conflict situations.\r\nThe success of the United Nations in this area\r\ndepends to a great extent on a qualitative interaction\r\nwith host Governments in the area of reinforcing\r\nnational potential, the introduction of effective\r\ninstruments and mechanisms for the coordination and\r\nmobilization of resources, and increased interaction\r\nwith the Bretton-Woods institutions in the context of a\r\njoint assessment of their needs and specific project\r\nactivities.\r\nIn this regard, it is noteworthy that one of the\r\nlessons learned from the peaceful settlement of the\r\ninter-Tajik conflict is the need for donor countries to be\r\nactive not only during the crisis but also in the post-\r\nconflict period. I am convinced that strengthening the\r\nfoundation of peace and stability in countries living\r\nthrough conflict requires not only humanitarian\r\nassistance but also actual help in addressing economic\r\nproblems and support for countries’ efforts to create a\r\ndynamic and stable economy. As a rule, these kinds of\r\ninvestments, within the framework of a peaceful\r\nprocess, turn out to be instrumental in strengthening\r\nyoung democracies born out of conflict. There is no\r\ndoubt that the parliamentary elections to be held in\r\nTajikistan in early 2005 will prove once again the\r\nvitality and irreversible nature of the peace process in\r\nTajikistan and the robustness of the country’s\r\ndemocratic institutions.\r\nAchieving ecologically sustainable development\r\non the global, regional and national levels remains an\r\nissue of top priority. Tajikistan intends to continue to\r\ncontribute to the implementation of the relevant\r\ndecisions of Johannesburg and other international\r\nforums. The 2005-2015 International Decade for\r\nAction, “Water for Life”, to be launched on 22 March\r\n2005, was initiated by our country and is expected to\r\ncombine efforts undertaken by Governments, the\r\nUnited Nations, international organizations, civil\r\nsociety and the private sector. These efforts are aimed\r\nat identifying effective ways of achieving the\r\ninternationally agreed goals in the area of fresh water\r\nresources, developing strategies, programmes and laws\r\nto protect water environments and increasing\r\ninvestment and voluntary donor contributions, two\r\nactivities associated with ensuring access to fresh\r\nwater to all persons in need. We ask the Governments\r\nof all countries, as well as United Nations agencies, to\r\nundertake practical activities within this decade. This\r\nis the key to success, and it will require a great deal of\r\nwork.\r\nIn some regions of the world, the international\r\ncommunity is faced not only with the problem of\r\nconflicts and wars that interfere with long-term\r\ndevelopment, but also with illicit drug trafficking,\r\nwhich poses a threat to civil society. We cannot help\r\nbeing concerned with the fact that global demand for\r\nprohibited drugs is not decreasing. For instance, the\r\nvolume of criminal transit of narcotics via Tajikistan\r\nconstitutes a serious threat to our social, political and\r\neconomic stability as well as to the security of the\r\nregion as a whole. Afghanistan remains a major\r\nsupplier of narcotics. Their production this year has set\r\na record.\r\nThe President of Tajikistan, Mr. Emomali\r\nRakhmonov, regards the struggle against illicit drugs as\r\none of the top priorities for our country. Thanks to the\r\ncooperation with the United Nations and interaction\r\nwithin Shanghai Cooperation Organization of the last\r\nfive years, Tajikistan has become one of the leading\r\ncountries in the world in terms of narcotics\r\ninterdiction. Over this period, the law enforcement\r\nbodies of Tajikistan and the Russian border guards\r\nhave confiscated about 40 tons of narcotics, with\r\nheroin constituting more than half of this total. As a\r\nresult, millions of dollars have been removed from\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\ncirculation and hundreds of thousands of people the\r\nworld over have been saved from narcotics\r\ndependency.\r\nAccording to Antonio Maria Costa, Executive\r\nDirector of the United Nations Office on Drugs and\r\nCrime, Tajikistan sets a good example for other\r\ncountries as to how one can successfully struggle\r\nagainst drugs. The achievements of Tajikistan in this\r\narea are considered as a good basis for strengthening\r\nthe struggle against the narcotics threat, but we are\r\ncombating the results rather than the roots of the\r\nproblem.\r\nIn autumn 2005, heads of State and Government\r\nwill meet in this General Assembly Hall to discuss\r\nprogress in achieving the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. We attach great importance to this event, which\r\ncoincides with the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nfoundation of the United Nations. We expect this\r\nforthcoming event to give the necessary political\r\nimpetus to the international community in its progress\r\ntowards the achievement through combined efforts of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals in the interest of a\r\nmore stable, just and prosperous world.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to Her Excellency Mrs. Maria Levens, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Suriname.\r\nMrs. Levens (Suriname): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of the Republic of Suriname, I\r\nextend to you my sincere congratulations on your\r\nunanimous election to guide the work of this fifty-ninth\r\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly. We\r\nare convinced that the wealth of diplomatic experience\r\nand expertise you bring to this body will assist you in a\r\nmeaningful way during your presidency. I can assure\r\nyou that the Government of the Republic of Suriname\r\nand its Permanent Mission stand ready to cooperate\r\nwith you in the coming months. It also gives me great\r\npleasure to salute your predecessor, the President of the\r\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly,\r\nMr. Julian Robert Hunte, a fellow Caribbean national.\r\nMr. Hunte’s sterling and dedicated leadership has made\r\nall of us, especially those from the Caribbean region,\r\nproud. To Secretary-General Kofi Annan we offer our\r\ncontinued support. We acknowledge the importance of\r\nhis remarks at the start of the General Assembly and\r\nshare his views regarding the application of the rule of\r\nlaw, both domestically and internationally, as the\r\nguiding principle in strengthening and preserving\r\ndemocracy, defending and promoting human rights and\r\nestablishing peace.\r\nWe are keenly aware of the importance of the\r\nUnited Nations, as the supreme multilateral institution,\r\nin advancing multilateral diplomacy for the benefit of\r\nhumanity in a world in which we continue to struggle\r\nto achieve peace, security and prosperity. The\r\ninternational community expressed some time ago the\r\nneed for a more effective and efficient Organization\r\nthat would be better able to address the many\r\nchallenges our world faces today.\r\nUnder the inspiring leadership of your\r\npredecessor, Mr. President, the fifty-eighth session of\r\nthe General Assembly achieved the reordering of the\r\nagenda of the General Assembly aimed at its further\r\nrationalization and at facilitating the uniform and\r\ncoherent discussion of development issues in the\r\nplenary and the main committees of the General\r\nAssembly. We must keep that powerful momentum for\r\nchange alive and take it a step further. We must ensure\r\nthat we do not regress from the results achieved and\r\nensure that there is continued progress in these areas.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations Security\r\nCouncil remains one of the vital objectives of the\r\nrestructuring efforts of the Organization. In our view, a\r\nrestructured Council must be a reflection of the\r\nmembership of the Organization, improving its level of\r\ntransparency and making it more democratic. The\r\nCouncil must be more inclusive and comprehensive in\r\nits functioning, as security matters, because of their\r\nmultidimensional nature, affect the life and livelihood\r\nof each and every one of us. The membership of a\r\nrestructured Council and, equally, its current\r\ncomposition must ensure that the Council upholds the\r\nfundamental principles of the Charter while retaining\r\nits main focus: the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nIt is very disturbing to observe that, despite\r\nintensive diplomatic and political undertakings, peace\r\nand tranquillity in several regions of the world are still\r\na major concern and challenge that threaten the\r\ndemocratic underpinnings of society. The time may be\r\nopportune for the United Nations to spearhead the\r\nprocess of involving relevant interest groups and civil\r\nsociety at large in the different countries of a particular\r\nregion to assist in the establishment of sustained peace\r\nin that region.\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nWe express our concern about the ongoing\r\npolitical difficulties in the Middle East and in Africa,\r\nresulting in violence and the displacement of many\r\npersons.\r\nThe political crises in our own hemisphere —\r\nespecially in Venezuela and Haiti — have attracted\r\nmuch attention and have been the subject of many\r\nefforts by the United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAmerican States. We look forward to continuing and\r\nsustainable political stability in Venezuela which, we\r\nhope, will promote an environment of normalcy and\r\nprogress.\r\nThe political situation in our sister nation, the\r\nRepublic of Haiti, remains of great concern. Since its\r\ninception as the first black independent republic, Haiti\r\nhas become the symbol of struggle and hardship, but\r\nalso of courage, survival and solidarity. That long-\r\nbattered country and its population need more\r\nprofound, constructive and long-term assistance to\r\nimprove the living conditions of the people of Haiti.\r\nEarlier, I referred briefly to the multidimensional\r\nnature of security and the need to give due attention to\r\nsocial, economic and environmental threats. In recent\r\nweeks, the Caribbean region, which is home to\r\neconomies that are already vulnerable, has felt the\r\nforce of nature in the most extreme manner. While\r\nseveral countries have been battered — such as\r\nJamaica, the Bahamas, Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago and\r\nseveral other islands — one country in particular has\r\nbeen severely damaged: Grenada. I join all the other\r\nnations that have already done so in calling for\r\nimmediate as well as long-term financial and technical\r\nassistance for the Government and people of Grenada.\r\nThe Government of Suriname offers it condolences to\r\nthe families of the victims in Caribbean countries, as\r\nwell as in affected states of the United States of\r\nAmerica, where various hurricanes in recent weeks\r\nhave caused considerable damage and loss of life.\r\nAnother global threat that has an impact on every\r\ncountry emanates from the activities of terrorists,\r\nterrorist groups and State-sponsored terrorism. The\r\nworld will never forget the images of horrifying\r\nterrorist acts such as the one that took place in Beslan\r\nthis year, where hundreds of persons, mostly children,\r\nlost their lives. The Government of Suriname remains\r\ncommitted to the fight against terrorism. We also\r\ncontinue to believe that an effective and successful\r\nbattle can be waged through a comprehensive\r\napproach.\r\nThe High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\r\nChange, which was established by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral with a view to receiving a global report on\r\ninternational security, is a result of the renewed interest\r\nin international security concerns. We hope that that\r\nreview will be one that will produce result-oriented\r\nobjectives and measures.\r\nSuriname believes that development issues such\r\nas the eradication of poverty and hunger and the\r\nprotection of the environment are among the extremely\r\nimportant aspects to be addressed if one wishes to\r\nobtain lasting and comprehensive security, which\r\nencompasses, inter alia, military, political,\r\nenvironmental, economic and social developmental\r\naspects.\r\nUp to the present day, globalization has not\r\ndelivered on the promise of vast development\r\nopportunities on a global scale. While we have to\r\nacknowledge that globalization has created\r\nopportunities, those opportunities have been restricted\r\nto just a few societies. The opportunities that arise\r\nfrom development in the world today are,\r\nunfortunately, not within the reach of all humankind.\r\nThe current world order is still characterized by\r\neconomic disparities, unequal trade regimes, income\r\ninequalities between and within countries, social\r\ninjustice and declining opportunities for hundreds of\r\nmillions. Globalization can only become a real option\r\nfor economic development if it becomes all-inclusive\r\nand if we give it a human face by paying particular\r\nattention to the negative impact it has on social\r\nprogress.\r\nSuriname continues to believe that the United\r\nNations must regain its importance in the areas of\r\nglobal development, if we want to be successful in our\r\nefforts to eradicate poverty, achieve social and\r\neconomic development and stem the spread of\r\ncommunicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe meeting on the subject of poverty organized\r\nby the Government of Brazil under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations points to a common awareness of the\r\nfact that the global development agenda must be\r\nadvanced and that, therefore, the international\r\ncommunity must move from political will to action and\r\nfrom commitments to implementation, granting\r\nhumanity as a whole an opportunity to develop.\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nThe upcoming 10-year review of the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action will provide small island\r\ndeveloping States with a momentous opportunity to\r\npromote their priority interests and concerns for the\r\nnext phase of the implementation of the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action. While we anticipate that that\r\ncomprehensive review will result in concrete proposals\r\nto advance the implementation process, we also expect\r\nthat the review exercise will take place in a spirit of\r\npartnership. The upcoming meeting in Mauritius\r\nshould therefore generate greatly needed support,\r\ngenuine commitment and, moreover, the political will\r\nof all partners in the process of furthering the cause of\r\nachieving true benefits and progress for the many\r\npeople living in small island developing States.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to stress the need for the\r\nUnited Nations to become more effective in dealing\r\nwith the current challenges in terms of terrorism and\r\nsecurity. At the same time, we must remain vigilant in\r\ndefending and strengthening democracy and\r\ndemocratic values and institutions, so as to create a\r\nstable political and social environment for progress and\r\nsustainable development. We also need to continue,\r\nand intensify, our battle against HIV/AIDS, illegal drug\r\ntrafficking and crime. Although globalization has\r\nopened up opportunities, it is also our collective\r\nresponsibility to ensure that international trade\r\nliberalization does not result in social and economic\r\nmarginalization, especially of smaller and vulnerable\r\neconomies.\r\nTo achieve those objectives, the United Nations\r\nhas to continue its restructuring process and become\r\nnot only the principal global platform in theory, but\r\nalso demonstrate its capabilities to act in practice. It is\r\nin that context that my Government considers the\r\nUnited Nations the most appropriate global multilateral\r\ninstitution for the advancement of the living standards\r\nof humankind as a whole and for achieving sustainable\r\nglobal peace and security.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Carlos Morales Troncoso,\r\nSecretary of State for Foreign Relations of the\r\nDominican Republic.\r\nMr. Morales Troncoso (Dominican Republic)\r\n(spoke in Spanish): It is a great honour for me today to\r\naddress the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session,\r\non behalf of the Government of Leonel Fernández and\r\nof the people of the Dominican Republic, in this forum\r\ndevoted to the maintenance of peace and the promotion\r\nof development and harmony among peoples. Once\r\nagain, we are speaking out on the most delicate and\r\nimportant issues on the international agenda so that we\r\ncan join forces in the search for viable solutions to the\r\nproblems that affect us all.\r\nI extend my sincerest congratulations to you, Sir,\r\non your election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. We are confident\r\nthat you will steer our work along the path of peace\r\nand security for the good of mankind. We also\r\nunderscore the important work accomplished by the\r\noutgoing President, Mr. Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia.\r\nThe Dominican Republic has been struck by a\r\nforce of nature that has left death and destruction in its\r\nwake in various parts of the country. The rain and the\r\nwind of Hurricane Jeanne had severe consequences for\r\nthe eastern part of our country, destroying homes,\r\nmeans of communication, bridges, crops and tourist\r\ninfrastructure, at a time when the Dominican Republic\r\nhad been making increasing efforts to jumpstart its\r\neconomy. We take this opportunity to express our\r\nthanks for the international community’s solidarity in\r\nthese difficult times for the Dominican Republic. I\r\nwould also like to express my deepest thanks to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, who has expressed\r\nsolidarity with our country and with Haiti in the\r\ncontext of this natural disaster.\r\nThe fact of globalization steadily deepens\r\nrelations among our countries, challenging our capacity\r\nto take advantage of the opportunities that\r\nglobalization offers, as well as our capacity to limit its\r\nnegative impact. Together with the contradictory and\r\ncomplex processes of integration and disintegration,\r\nour countries still hope that the benefits of\r\nglobalization will create conditions making it possible\r\nto overcome poverty and attain a good life.\r\nA tragic event that occurred in this city of New\r\nYork on 11 September 2001 changed the destiny of\r\nhumankind in a matter of minutes, and made the world\r\nincreasingly dangerous and insecure. The promise of\r\nlasting peace presaged by the end of the cold war was\r\ndestroyed by terrorist actions — actions which were\r\ncondemned by all humankind and which have\r\nunleashed a steady escalation of violence that has\r\nturned the world into a place of uncertainty.\r\nWe must spare no effort to rid humankind of the\r\nthreat of terrorism. We condemn terrorist acts in all\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\ntheir forms and manifestations, whatever their source\r\nand whomever may be affected, and want to\r\nunderscore the importance of international cooperation\r\nin the fight against that scourge, which should always\r\nbe prosecuted in strict compliance with international\r\nlaw, and, in particular, with human rights and\r\ninternational humanitarian law.\r\nThe Dominican Republic is founded on an\r\nunconditional commitment to the norms and principles\r\nof international law, and particularly those that relate to\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes, the condemnation\r\nof the use of force, compliance in good faith with\r\ninternational treaties and the implementation of the\r\nresolutions of the United Nations and its deliberative\r\nbodies, including the General Assembly, the Security\r\nCouncil and the Commission on Human Rights.\r\nWe reaffirm the view to which countries\r\ncommitted themselves in May 2004 at the third\r\nSummit Conference of Heads of State and Government\r\nof Latin America and the Caribbean and of the\r\nEuropean Union, as set out in paragraph 8 of the\r\nDeclaration of Guadalajara:\r\n“[A]n effective multilateral system, based on\r\ninternational law, supported by strong\r\ninternational institutions and with the United\r\nNations at its centre, is essential for achieving\r\npeace and international security, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and social progress.”\r\nHowever, in order to achieve those objectives we\r\nmust streamline, modernize and reform the entire\r\nmultilateral international system, a process that States\r\nmust support through respect for and compliance with\r\nthe resolutions adopted, without neglecting genuine\r\nand effective equitable regional participation.\r\nMultilateralism is one of the main pillars of the\r\nforeign policy of the Dominican Republic, as can be\r\nseen by our participation and cooperation in all\r\ninternational forums. For that reason, we join those\r\nnations that call for a thorough reform of the United\r\nNations system, with a view to enhancing its\r\ndemocratization and making it a more effective\r\ninstrument for States Members. That reform must be\r\ngeared, first of all, towards strengthening the General\r\nAssembly, the most important body of the\r\nOrganization, and the Security Council, in which there\r\nis unequal geographical representation. We reiterate yet\r\nagain the suggestion that has been made for several\r\nyears now: the Security Council should be expanded so\r\nthat Asia, Africa and Latin America can have two\r\npermanent members, and the number of non-permanent\r\nseats should be increased in order to democraticize the\r\ndecision-making mechanism of that forum for peace.\r\nThose reforms are necessary to make the multilateral\r\nsystem more agile and effective, so that it may more\r\nsuccessfully confront global threats and challenges.\r\nI would like to echo the commitment undertaken\r\nby the heads of State or Government who met in Santo\r\nDomingo in August and adopted the Declaration of\r\nSanto Domingo 2004, in which we agreed that:\r\n“[t]he fight against poverty is essential to the\r\nconsolidation of democracy. In that regard, it is\r\nnecessary to formulate and implement public\r\npolicies aimed at strengthening economic growth\r\nand an equitable distribution of national income\r\nand wealth.”\r\nAs we are all aware, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) has reported that the richest 20\r\nper cent of Latin America’s population receives 54 per\r\ncent of national income, whereas the poorest 20 per\r\ncent of population receives only four per cent. This fact\r\nis an attack on governability.\r\nWe want to underscore the importance of a\r\nmeeting that was held at the United Nations last\r\nweek — the gathering of world leaders in an alliance\r\nagainst hunger and poverty, which resulted in a serious\r\ncommitment on the part of each and every one of our\r\nrepresentatives here to fight unwaveringly and\r\neffectively to achieve the agreed objectives.\r\nFor the Government of the Dominican Republic,\r\nthe fight against corruption is a priority. We have\r\nshown this by implementing mechanisms to prevent\r\nand punish acts of corruption. That scourge has a grave\r\nimpact on the economies of our countries. We all know\r\nthat the main victims of corruption are the poor. We\r\nneed, above all, to strengthen existing mechanisms,\r\nand to produce others if necessary, in order to wage a\r\npitched battle against corruption and those who benefit\r\nfrom it, regardless of their origin or social class. We\r\nhave taken this decision because we see that the rise in\r\ncorruption in our region has jeopardized the\r\ngovernability of all of our countries. Governmental\r\ntransparency and a greater participation of civil society\r\nare necessary to combat this evil.\r\nWe wish to emphasize this morning the\r\nimportance and effectiveness of the follow-up\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nmechanism for the implementation of the Inter-\r\nAmerican Convention Against Corruption, and its Plan\r\nof Action adopted in Managua. Likewise, we ask that\r\nour countries not be used as safe havens for persons\r\nconvicted of acts of corruption. We also advocate the\r\nreturn of those ill-gotten gains to the countries that\r\nhave fallen victim to this evil, which, together with\r\ndrug trafficking, has a negative impact on the stability\r\nof democracy and the enforcement of the rule of law.\r\nIn recent years, Dominican Republic has made\r\nreal progress in its struggle against trafficking in\r\npersons, where the most vulnerable populations are\r\nwomen and children, whether at the regional or\r\ninternational level. Through the establishment of\r\nnational and international networks against trafficking\r\nin Dominican children and adolescents, and with the\r\ncooperation of the diplomatic foreign and consular\r\nservices, we have made great strides in that area. We\r\ntake this opportunity to emphasize the participation of\r\nthe International Organization for Migration and its\r\nimportant support in this struggle.\r\nAs for the struggle of countries against the\r\nmanufacture and illicit trade in small arms and light\r\nweapons, our country is committed to assisting in the\r\nareas of investigation and the adoption of measures for\r\nstrengthening global and regional cooperation in order\r\nto fight against this scourge. States must continue to\r\nmake every effort to implement the Programme of\r\nAction adopted by the United Nations Conference on\r\nthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in\r\nAll Its Aspects.\r\nWe also want to express our deep concern at the\r\nhigh level of kidnappings and crime in our countries —\r\na level that increases year after year, thus worsening\r\nthe sense of insecurity felt by persons of all social\r\nclasses and races. The rise in crime is a threat to the\r\nsecurity and safety of our citizens and to the\r\ndemocratic governability of all of our countries. Well-\r\ndesigned deterrence mechanisms based on zero\r\ntolerance, an efficient police force, and a strengthened\r\njudiciary will all be necessary to reduce this scourge,\r\nwhich has a significant impact on the lives of our\r\ncitizens.\r\nOn a different topic, the Caribbean now has the\r\nsecond highest incidence of HIV/AIDS in the world.\r\nWe invite the Member States of the United Nations to\r\nrededicate themselves to the terms of the Declaration\r\nof Commitment on HIV/AIDS adopted at the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on 27 June 2001.\r\nDominican legislation includes law 55-93 on\r\nHIV/AIDS, which is now in the process of being\r\nreformed and which represents one of the few existing\r\npieces of legislation in our region regarding that\r\ndisease. We reiterate the request for cooperation to the\r\ninternational community so that, through financing, the\r\ncountries most seriously affected can have more\r\nresources to deal with the consequences of that illness\r\nin order to provide the comprehensive care that is very\r\nnecessary, as well as the antiretroviral medications to\r\ncombat the illness. This is based on the right of all\r\ncitizens to life and health.\r\nIn recent years and in most international forums,\r\nour country has referred to the grave crisis confronting\r\nthe sister republic of Haiti. We have drawn attention to\r\nthe fact that the Dominican Republic could not and\r\ncannot bear the weight of this crisis and its\r\nconsequences on its shoulders alone. On more than one\r\noccasion we have called on the international\r\ncommunity for solidarity. We do so with the intent of\r\nbeginning a far-reaching process that can help in\r\nfinding a solution to this problem. Today, we see that\r\novercoming this crisis represents a major challenge to\r\nthe United Nations, and therefore we support the\r\nprocess that began through the United Nations\r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti. We consider it very\r\nimportant that the Haitian people see this peaceful\r\nmission as the participation of the international\r\ncommunity in the stabilization of their nation, and that\r\nthey at no time view it as an occupation force.\r\nHurricane Jeanne has caused thousands of deaths\r\nand much destruction in the area of Gonaïves, Haiti,\r\nthus deepening the economic and humanitarian crisis in\r\nthat country. Now, more than ever, we call on the\r\ninternational community and international financial\r\nbodies to provide the necessary financial resources that\r\ncan place that nation on the path toward stability and\r\nprogress.\r\nMany regions of the world have not yet achieved\r\nthe peace to which they aspire. Despite all the efforts\r\nundertaken in that regard, innocent people continue to\r\nlose their lives in a conflict that for decades has\r\ncharacterized the instability of the Middle East.\r\nThe Dominican Republic avails itself of this\r\nforum to reaffirm its unrestricted support for the peace\r\nprocess begun between Israel and Palestine during the\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\n1991 Madrid Conference, for the Oslo Agreements, for\r\nthe recommendations made by United States Senator\r\nGeorge Mitchell in his final report and for the road\r\nmap presented by President George Bush and\r\nsupported by Russia and the European Union.\r\nFinally, the Dominican Republic reiterates its\r\nposition, expressed in various forums, on the need for a\r\nconstructive dialogue between the nations located on\r\nboth sides of the Straits of Taiwan in order to ensure\r\npeace and security in that region.\r\nI conclude by expressing the hope that this\r\noccasion has enabled the Governments represented at\r\nthis meeting to reflect seriously on our destiny — the\r\ndestiny of all men and women who live on Earth —\r\nand also that the United Nations will be able, with the\r\ncooperation of States, to establish the balance\r\nnecessary for the benefit of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Lamuel Stanislaus, Chairman of\r\nthe delegation of Grenada.\r\nMr. Stanislaus (Grenada): My delegation joins in\r\nthe many laudatory and congratulatory expressions\r\naddressed to you, Mr. Ping, as you assume the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession. Additionally, we pay tribute to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, whose presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session was virile,\r\ndynamic and constructive, imbued, as he was, with the\r\nwisdom of Solomon, the patience of Job and the vision\r\nof Daniel.\r\nGrenada’s statement is made from the profound\r\ndepths of the human heart. The Prime Minister of\r\nGrenada, The Right Honourable Keith Mitchell, and\r\nthe Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade,\r\nThe Honourable Elvin Nimrod, whose unavoidable\r\nabsence can be understood, have asked me to speak on\r\ntheir behalf.\r\nThe Assembly will, I hope, understand why\r\nGrenada’s statement in this general debate will focus in\r\nlarge measure on the natural disaster that has befallen\r\nthe State of Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique.\r\nFirst, Grenada expresses grateful appreciation for the\r\noutpouring of sympathy and assistance from the many\r\ncountries that have already taken the rostrum —\r\nespecially from the Caribbean leaders who have seen\r\nand described to the Assembly, in chilling and heart-\r\nrending detail, the devastation of the tri-island State of\r\nGrenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique caused by\r\njurricane Ivan “the Terrible”.\r\nTherefore, there is no need for me to multiply my\r\nwords except to say that the fickle finger of fate\r\nseemed to have conspired with nature — exceedingly\r\nbenevolent at times, but sometimes equally destructive.\r\nThis time, it released its full fury on a vulnerable small\r\nisland developing State, reducing it to rubble. After\r\nhurricane Ivan’s rage had subsided, there was complete\r\ndestruction of the infrastructure, and it seemed as if a\r\nStygian darkness had descended on the land. However,\r\nthe resilience of our people and the emerging solidarity\r\ngive us hope that, with the assistance of the\r\ninternational community, Grenada — like the\r\nmythological phoenix — will rise from the ashes\r\nbrought about by the hurricane.\r\nWho can help us pick up the pieces of a shattered\r\ncountry with a dislocated economy, whose precipitous\r\ndecline has brought it to rock bottom? An assessment\r\nof the destruction reveals that it would take $2 billion\r\nto rebuild the State of Grenada, Carriacou and Petite\r\nMartinique. That is a Herculean task far beyond our\r\nmeans. The call, therefore, is made to the international\r\ncommunity: “Come down to Macedonia and help us”.\r\nWe plead with the United Nations, its agencies the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, UNICEF,\r\nUNESCO, the World Bank, the International Monetary\r\nFund, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\r\nUnited Nations, the World Health Organization,\r\nindividual countries, individual permanent\r\nrepresentatives, non-governmental organizations and\r\nfriends to help Grenada help itself.\r\nIn that connection, my delegation recalls the\r\nwords of the seventeenth-century English clergyman\r\nand poet John Donne: “No man is an island, entire of\r\nitself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of\r\nthe main.” Thus, what happens to each of us affects all\r\nof us. Today, that is eminently borne out by the\r\ninterconnectivity and interdependence of societies,\r\naided by the information and communication\r\ntechnology revolution. Consequently, we speak today\r\nabout a world shared by all instead of a world divided.\r\nGiving, caring and sharing should therefore be a\r\nreality, not just a concept.\r\nForgiving Grenada’s debt and cancelling its\r\nobligations to international organizations and\r\ninstitutions will give Grenada a breathing spell. Help in\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nthat regard will be formally requested through official\r\nchannels and will free Grenada of its many obligations.\r\nThe dire problems of my country\r\nnotwithstanding, we cannot fail to touch upon the\r\nworld situation, in which the geopolitical centre of\r\ngravity continues to swing from the Israeli-Palestinian\r\nstruggle to Iraq and Afghanistan. The situation in those\r\ncentres of conflict is fanned further by the heinous and\r\natrocious crime of terrorism, which is fast becoming a\r\nway of life. In that regard, my delegation recalls an\r\nancient law: hatreds never cease by hatreds; it is by\r\nlove alone that they cease.\r\nIt will be recalled that, from this rostrum, I told\r\nmy colleagues that I would demit office at the end of\r\nthis month, having attained the ripe old age of 84 years\r\nand having served my country in this honourable body\r\nfor almost 13 years. Today, I want to recant with regard\r\nto that diplomatic note on my premature departure and\r\nto tell the Assembly that my Government has asked me\r\nto continue. Therefore, refreshed in body and mind,\r\nconfident in faith and joyful in hope, I will continue to\r\nexpect the generous assistance of my colleagues.\r\nWith respect to my age, I should like to quote Sir\r\nFrancis Bacon, who wrote several centuries ago that\r\nage appears to be best in four things: old wood best to\r\nburn, old wine to drink, old friends to trust and old\r\nauthors to read. Colleagues, I treasure your friendship\r\nand ask for your support on behalf of my country.\r\nLet me conclude with this patriotic verse:\r\nTo all the world I give my hand,\r\nMy heart I give my native land;\r\nI seek her good, her glory.\r\nI honour every nation’s name,\r\nRespect their fortune and their fame;\r\nBut I love the land that bore me!\r\nLove the land that bore me!\r\nPlease allow me an addendum to my statement. I\r\nwish to announce that tomorrow, Friday, at 10.30 a.m.\r\nin the Economic and Social Council Chamber, the\r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\r\nand the United Nations Development Programme will\r\nmake a flash appeal for assistance to Grenada and\r\nHaiti.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I give the floor\r\nto His Excellency Mr. Stuart Leslie, head of the\r\ndelegation from Belize.\r\nMr. Leslie (Belize): My delegation congratulates\r\nyou, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency. We\r\nhave every confidence that the fifty-ninth session of\r\nthe General Assembly will enjoy success under your\r\nleadership. We would also like to acknowledge the\r\ngood work of your predecessor, Minister Julian Hunte\r\nof Saint Lucia, whose efforts led to a new level of\r\nenthusiasm within the General Assembly. In addition,\r\nwe recognize the tireless efforts of our Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nEvents of the past months impel us to ponder the\r\nimportance of our Organization in the never-ending\r\nstruggle to secure a peaceful and dignified future for\r\nthe world. The United Nations was born to promote\r\nthose values that would unite humanity — values of\r\nfreedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for\r\npeoples and for nature — and thus transcend the\r\ndifferences of the world’s cultures. And so it is these\r\nUnited Nations large and small come to find, in the\r\nwords of our Secretary-General, common solutions to\r\ncommon problems. And so it is that we the Member\r\nStates must ensure that the United Nations is effective\r\nfor our ends.\r\nIn Belize we understand that and remain a\r\nlegitimate partner in promoting principles such as\r\npeace, the right to self-determination, social justice,\r\nrespect for human dignity, the rule of law, the right to\r\ndevelopment and the protection of our environment.\r\nWe stand for those principles not just because of\r\nthe international instruments we signed, but because\r\nthey represent the best way to end poverty, illiteracy,\r\nhate and ignorance, to stop the spread of terrorism and\r\nto bring an end to inequality, oppression, and injustice.\r\nFor the overwhelming majority in the United\r\nNations, the solution to many of the world’s problems\r\ncan be found in the right of every nation to achieve\r\nmeaningful sustainable development. Accomplishing\r\nsuch goals is not easy, but neither is it impossible.\r\nChallenges to development abound — challenges\r\nthat make us inherently vulnerable — and we as small\r\nStates call on the international community to take into\r\naccount our vulnerability so as to ensure that policies\r\nand measures relating to development correspond to\r\nour social needs.\r\nAs a member of the Alliance of Small Island\r\nStates, my country underscores the importance of\r\naddressing the special needs of such States through the\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action\r\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States. An international meeting, which\r\nwill conduct a full and comprehensive 10-year review\r\nof the Barbados Programme of Action, will be held in\r\nMauritius in January 2005, providing an opportunity\r\nfor the international community, especially the bilateral\r\nand multilateral donors, to renew their commitments to\r\nthe Barbados Programme of Action.\r\nOf special importance to us all is the issue of\r\nclimate change, and we must not flinch from taking\r\neffective measures to address that problem; those who\r\nseek to block effective solutions are creating conditions\r\nfor insecurity that would dwarf the threats currently\r\nposed by terrorism.\r\nIn that context, we remind Member States of the\r\nproposals first submitted to the General Assembly in\r\n1999 to designate the Caribbean Sea as a “special area”\r\nwithin the context of sustainable development. The\r\nrecent spate of hurricanes that have devastated our\r\nregion — especially Grenada and Haiti — and which\r\ncall for major efforts from the international community\r\nto mitigate our losses, reinforce our contention that our\r\nCaribbean Sea is as fragile as it is vulnerable and as\r\nfragile as it is valuable to our social and economic\r\nwell-being, indeed to our very survival.\r\nWe call upon the Assembly to support us in our\r\njust efforts to achieve the designation of the Caribbean\r\nSea as a “special area” during this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nIn addition to addressing the special needs of\r\ndeveloping countries, development policies must,\r\nabove all, be people centred. Coherent policies,\r\nsustainable partnerships, sustained support and\r\nownership are critical factors for development. That\r\nhas never been as clear as in the case of Haiti. In the\r\nwords of our Secretary-General,\r\n“the international community failed to develop ...\r\nsustainable partnerships with the Haitian society\r\nat all levels. The Haitian people were\r\ninsufficiently involved in the development of\r\npolicies that could move the country forward. ...\r\nFinancial aid did not bear fruit to the extent\r\nexpected because it was at times ill-targeted ...”\r\n(S/2004/300, para. 6).\r\nWith the lesson thus learned, we have an opportunity to\r\ninfluence a positive wave of development for the\r\npeople of Haiti.\r\nIn Haiti, we also have a clear example of the\r\ninextricable linkage between development and security.\r\nThere, threats and challenges to peace and security\r\nnecessitate an integrated approach. My country hopes\r\nthat the Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change will embrace that\r\napproach in its findings and recommendations.\r\nWhile we condemn terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations and have joined international efforts in\r\nthe fight against terrorism, we are mindful that our\r\nactions for the preservation of peace and security must\r\nbe consistent with international law and must be\r\nrespectful of the human rights and freedoms of all\r\npeoples without discrimination, foremost among which\r\nmust be the right to self-determination.\r\nFor that reason, we shall remain strong\r\nproponents of the right of the Palestinian people to a\r\nsecure and viable State. It is also for the same reason\r\nthat we support the Taiwanese people’s right for\r\nrepresentation before the United Nations.\r\nBut what United Nations? Last year our Minister\r\nof Foreign Affairs confined his remarks to an urgent\r\ncall for the United Nations to recall and enforce the\r\nprinciples on which it was founded, basic among which\r\nis the principle of multilateralism — the most\r\nfundamental conviction that led to its creation: that\r\nStates, on the basis of sovereign equality, conjointly\r\ntake decisions that secure a peaceful and prosperous\r\nworld for all.\r\nTragically, events since then have only\r\nexacerbated the problem whereby powerful States take\r\nthe law into their own hands and act in total disregard\r\nof the principles of the United Nations Charter and\r\nindeed of international law. If we do not act together to\r\nreverse that evil trend, we are walking — nay,\r\nrunning — on the road to perdition.\r\nYes, we support the call of India, Japan, Brazil\r\nand Germany for a permanent seat on the Security\r\nCouncil, if there must be permanent seats. And to this\r\nwe would add the equally legitimate right of African\r\nand Arab nations to be so represented. But the reforms\r\nmust go deeper. Why should any one country have a\r\nveto power? Why should millions of the wretched of\r\nthe earth be left without an effective voice and be\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\npowerless to change the world to a more just one? And\r\nwhy do we, who so effectively acted to end apartheid\r\nin South Africa, tolerate the equally opprobrious\r\napartheid practised by the State of Israel against\r\nPalestinians in their own land, murdering and\r\noppressing them without mercy and with impunity?\r\nThe year 2004 has been declared the International\r\nYear to Commemorate the Struggle against Slavery and\r\nits Abolition. Slavery was based on an exacerbated\r\nracism; so let us honour that struggle by implementing\r\nthe Final Declaration of the World Conference against\r\nRacial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related\r\nIntolerance, held in South Africa in 2001.\r\nLikewise we continue to support United Nations\r\nefforts to bring greater visibility to the problems of the\r\nworld’s indigenous people during the International\r\nDecade of the World’s Indigenous People. As the\r\nInternational Decade draws to a close later this year we\r\ncall for a second decade to continue the work achieved\r\nduring the first decade and so to carry out and\r\ncomplete the work that has not yet been completed.\r\nIn our own community of small States, we face\r\nthe most serious threat to our peoples’ security, caused\r\nby the proliferation of small arms and light weapons\r\nthat claim the lives of so many of our people. These\r\narms come from countries that must be called upon to\r\nlive up to their responsibility to cooperate with us to\r\nstem the flow of these lethal weapons and to enter into\r\nlegally binding agreements for the effective\r\nregistration and monitoring of transfers of these\r\nweapons of widespread destruction. An international\r\nconvention to achieve this must be put on our agenda\r\nurgently.\r\nAnother major issue for our region is the\r\ncontinued attempt to isolate the sister Caribbean\r\nRepublic of Cuba and to strengthen an economic\r\nembargo that has been condemned repeatedly by the\r\noverwhelming majority of this Assembly. The entire\r\nCaribbean Community is at one in its resolve to engage\r\nCuba in a constructive and mutually beneficial\r\npartnership that brings concrete benefits to all our\r\npeoples. The Cuban Government has, by its actions,\r\nmanifested its determination to fight against terrorism\r\nin all its forms and from every quarter. For us in the\r\nCaribbean, any call for “regime change” imposed from\r\noutside violates every principle upon which the United\r\nNations Organization stands.\r\nBelize has its own cause to promote. The United\r\nNations is well aware of the age-old and unfounded\r\nterritorial claim of Guatemala, and it has clearly and\r\nunanimously called for respect for the sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of Belize. We have endeavoured to\r\nnegotiate a just solution to this claim for decades, and\r\nin the last four years we have been engaged in a\r\nprocess under the auspices of the Organization of\r\nAmerican States (OAS), aimed at bringing this\r\nanachronistic claim to an end. Agreements have been\r\nmade and broken, in the context of a Guatemala that\r\nhas proclaimed its desire to find a peaceful solution to\r\nthe dispute. Still no solution is in sight. The worst\r\nscenario is for the claim to linger unresolved, thus\r\naffecting the security and development of our people.\r\nWe welcome the remarks of President Berger of\r\nGuatemala before this Assembly on 22 September,\r\nwhen he advocated a final settlement of the dispute,\r\nalong with cooperation between our two countries to\r\nimprove the socio-economic conditions of both our\r\npeoples. We certainly support this approach and will do\r\nour part, as we have always done, to achieve those\r\nnoble goals. But cooperation does not substitute for\r\nresolution of this age-old threat to the security and\r\nprosperity of our people. We will, therefore, continue\r\nto work within the OAS to develop an agreed process\r\nthat will bring finality to this matter, which will\r\nundoubtedly redound to the benefit of the peoples of\r\nboth Belize and Guatemala and contribute to the peace\r\nand security of the region. In the search for bringing\r\nthis longstanding dispute to an end, we place high\r\nhopes on the role of the Group of Friends that has been\r\nagreed by both parties to reach this objective, and we\r\nlook forward to its greater input and support to the\r\nprocess.\r\nThe challenges we face in the world today are not\r\nall unique to our generation. Some are the result of our\r\nrefusal to learn from the mistakes of the past; others\r\nare entirely of our making. Yet, if we are to look at\r\nthose values that unite us and we are determined in our\r\ndesire for good, we will find that working together\r\nbrings us ever closer to amore just and peaceful world.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. John Dauth, chairman of\r\nthe delegation of Australia.\r\nMr. Dauth (Australia): Sir, let me begin by\r\ncongratulating you on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, and let me\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nsay how honoured I am to be one of your Vice-\r\nPresidents.\r\nI want to say also how delighted Australia is to\r\nwelcome Iraq back to the General Assembly.\r\nWe, the nations of the world, gathered here at the\r\nfifty-ninth session of the General Assembly, face\r\nchallenges to international security and prosperity that\r\nare very different from those which existed at the birth\r\nof the United Nations. However, the aims of the United\r\nNations as set out in the Preamble to the Charter\r\nremain as relevant and vital today as they did then:\r\n“to save successive generations from the scourge\r\nof war … to reaffirm faith in fundamental human\r\nrights ... to establish conditions under which\r\njustice and respect for the obligations arising\r\nfrom treaties and other sources of international\r\nlaw can be maintained … and to promote social\r\nprogress and better standards of life in larger\r\nfreedom”.\r\nToday, the menace of terrorism and the dangers of\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD)\r\ncast their shadow across the globe, threatening not only\r\nour security, but also the development gains and future\r\nprosperity of all nations.\r\nIt is this new international environment, this new\r\nreality, to which we must all adjust. The United\r\nNations is no exception. The United Nations is a vital\r\ninstitution that does great humanitarian work, but it\r\nmust strengthen its capacity to deal effectively with the\r\nproblems we now face or risk sliding into irrelevance.\r\nThe Secretary-General himself recognized this\r\nlast year when he said that we have come to a fork in\r\nthe road, a moment no less decisive than in 1945 when\r\nthe United Nations was founded. And, again this year,\r\nhe stated that if the leaders of the world could not\r\nagree on the way forward, history would take the\r\ndecisions. The issue he raises for us all is whether we,\r\nthe United Nations membership, can rise to the\r\nchallenge and take the steps necessary for the\r\nOrganization to fulfil its aims in today’s world.\r\nAustralia strongly supported last year the\r\nestablishment by the Secretary-General of a High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change, and we\r\nstand ready to contribute to ambitious outcomes. I want\r\nto return to the work of the Panel later in this address.\r\nThere would be few nations in the room\r\nuntouched by terrorism. As the cowardly attacks in\r\nBeslan and at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta\r\nillustrate, terrorism will not simply fade away. In\r\nresponse, we, the international community, cannot\r\nallow security threats to fester. What is required is new\r\nthinking, practical action, and cooperation between\r\nGovernments. Obviously, the United Nations has a\r\nprimary role to play. But Governments and regional\r\norganizations must also ensure that their resources and\r\ninfrastructure can respond to the current environment.\r\nThis is a responsibility Australia has taken very\r\nseriously. On terrorism, we have fully supported the\r\nwork of the United Nations, ensuring Jema’ah\r\nIslamiyah was listed as a terrorist organization under\r\nthe Security Council resolution 1267 (1999) sanctions\r\nregime and promoting compliance with the United\r\nNations terrorist asset freezing regime.\r\nWe have committed energy and resources to\r\nbuilding counter-terrorism cooperation in our own\r\nregion, both bilaterally and through organizations such\r\nas the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the\r\nRegional Forum of the Association of South-East\r\nAsian Nations. We are also committed to building\r\nunderstanding as part of a comprehensive approach.\r\nThis is evident in the messages we convey to our\r\nregional partners and to Australians — namely, that our\r\nefforts to stop a minority of extremist Muslim terrorists\r\nis not a war on Islam; that Muslims are as much the\r\nvictims of terrorist attacks and must defend\r\nthemselves; and that we must all work to defeat\r\nterrorism together.\r\nOur cooperation with regional partners has\r\ndelivered results, but as the recent bombing in Jakarta\r\nillustrates, terrorism in our own region is not yet\r\ndefeated. While Australia’s embassy in Jakarta may\r\nhave been the target of the latest attack, it was as much\r\nan assault on Indonesia as on Australia, and we are\r\nparticularly saddened by the loss of innocent\r\nIndonesian lives. Indonesia and Australia are\r\ndetermined to catch the perpetrators and see justice\r\ndone, for the bonds between us cannot be split by\r\nterrorists, but only strengthened.\r\nAustralia’s commitment to a stable and secure\r\nregion is particularly reflected in our efforts in the\r\nPacific. Since 11 September 2001, we have come to\r\nappreciate more acutely the dangers weak and failing\r\nStates can pose to security. Of course, not all such\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nStates are home to terrorists, but where instability and\r\nvulnerabilities exist, so, too, do opportunities for crime\r\nand the potential for human suffering.\r\nWhen our Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer,\r\naddressed this forum last year, he noted Australia was\r\ndeveloping regional approaches to confront the dangers\r\nof State failure and that with our Pacific Islands Forum\r\npartners we were restoring hope to the people of\r\nSolomon Islands. In just one year, the Regional\r\nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands has made\r\nexcellent progress in restoring stability and law and\r\nconsolidating Government finances, and is now\r\nmoving into long-term governance reform.\r\nAustralia is also working with other States in our\r\nregion, notably Papua New Guinea and Nauru, to\r\naddress economic management and governance issues.\r\nRegional cooperation is being strengthened through the\r\nPacific Plan, an initiative of the recent Pacific Islands\r\nForum meeting in Apia, which seeks to enhance\r\ncollaboration in areas of governance. I am delighted to\r\nsee among us today the Secretary-General of the\r\nPacific Islands Forum and welcome him to this Hall.\r\nWe would encourage the High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change to outline ambitious\r\nproposals for effective collective action to address\r\nfailed and failing States, including more explicit\r\nprovision for action by regional and other plurilateral\r\narrangements, as set out in Chapter VIII of the Charter.\r\nIraq is at a critical moment in its political\r\nevolution. A small minority is bent on destruction and\r\nmurder and wants to deny the Iraqi people their\r\nopportunity to express their political will through\r\nelections. This minority also attacks those who are\r\nworking to rebuild Iraq’s economy and improve Iraqi\r\nlives. Increasingly, Iraqis themselves will be\r\nresponsible for doing that work, but success will\r\ndepend on the resolute support of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe cannot allow terrorists to disrupt the\r\ndemocratic process in Iraq. Prime Minister Alawi has\r\nemphasized his Government’s determination to hold\r\nelections in January 2005 and the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General in Iraq has\r\ntold the Security Council that maintaining the election\r\nschedule is his greatest priority. While the difficult\r\nsecurity conditions in Iraq cannot be denied, it is\r\nimperative that the United Nations fulfil its role under\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1546 (2004) and work with\r\nIraqis to complete arrangements for the elections on\r\ntime.\r\nThe size of the United Nations presence in Iraq\r\nmust be commensurate with the importance and\r\nurgency of its task. For its part, Australia remains\r\ncommitted to assisting Iraq transform itself. To this\r\nend, we have committed more than $125 million, much\r\nof it directed through United Nations agencies.\r\nThe situation in Darfur is a humanitarian disaster.\r\nAustralia is committed to supporting urgent\r\ninternational efforts to end this horrific crisis. We have\r\nalready committed $20 million in emergency assistance\r\nfor the people of Darfur. We welcome the adoption of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1564 (2004) and applaud\r\nthe African Union for agreeing to lead a mission to\r\nDarfur. Let me make this very clear: we stand ready to\r\noffer assistance to this mission. The situation in Darfur\r\nhighlights the need for the international community to\r\ndevelop a better framework for responding to\r\nhumanitarian crises, and we hope the High-level Panel\r\non Threats, Challenges and Change will come up with\r\nclear and workable recommendations on humanitarian\r\nintervention.\r\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\r\n(WMDs) is another urgent concern. Unless we act\r\nfirmly and with unity, terrorist groups could one day\r\nacquire WMDs with disastrous consequences. As a\r\nthreat to international security, the issue of WMD\r\nproliferation falls squarely within the Security\r\nCouncil’s mandate. We welcome the adoption of\r\nresolution 1540 (2004) as a demonstration of the\r\nCouncil’s willingness to tackle WMD proliferation,\r\nincluding the risk of WMD terrorism. We hope that\r\nwith the adoption of this resolution, the Council will\r\ntake a firmer and more active stance on WMD issues.\r\nAs part of our commitment to combating the risk\r\nof nuclear terrorism, Australia will host an Asia-Pacific\r\nministerial conference in November on nuclear\r\nsafeguards and security. In addition, in the First\r\nCommittee this year, we, along with Turkey and\r\nArgentina, will introduce a draft resolution on the\r\nprevention of the illicit transfer and unauthorized\r\naccess to, and use of, man-portable air defence systems\r\n(MANPADS). We hope for a consensus adoption of\r\nthis draft resolution, which encourages States to take\r\nconcrete steps to prevent MANPADS from falling into\r\nthe hands of non-State end-users.\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nAllow me to return to the subject of the High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. During\r\nthis address, I have referred several times to\r\nit. Australia welcomes the direction of panel\r\ndiscussions — as far as we understand them — with\r\nrespect to both doctrinal and institutional reform. We\r\nhave contributed actively to the Panel’s work and we\r\nencourage the Panel, in its remaining deliberations, to\r\nwork towards ambitious recommendations on its entire\r\nprogramme of work, including Security Council\r\nreform, addressing threats from WMDs and terrorism,\r\nhumanitarian intervention and effective collective\r\naction.\r\nOn the issue of structural reform, we note here\r\nthat Australia has advocated expanding the permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council to make it more\r\ncompatible with geographical realities, through the\r\naddition of Japan, India, Brazil, an African country and\r\nIndonesia. Whatever the final shape of the Panel’s\r\nreport, one thing is clear: high-level political\r\ncommitment will be crucial to bringing bold reform\r\nrecommendations to fruition. We would encourage all\r\nMember States to give the Secretary-General their full\r\nsupport in considering the Panel’s recommendations.\r\nOne opportunity to do this will be the 2005\r\nUnited Nations summit of heads of State or\r\nGovernment. The summit provides an excellent forum,\r\nnot only to review implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, but also to endorse a reformed\r\nUnited Nations that is better equipped to deal with the\r\nchallenges it faces.\r\nAustralia has long advocated the need for United\r\nNations reform. Back in 2000 in this forum, the Prime\r\nMinister warned that,\r\n“In the absence of change and adaptation, the\r\nOrganization will wither as the nations of the\r\nworld bypass it in favour of ... mechanisms that\r\nare more relevant to their needs” (A/55/PV.20,\r\np. 25).\r\nOf course, this warning was before 11 September\r\n2001, before coalition action in Afghanistan and Iraq\r\nand before the terrorist bombings in Bali, Jakarta,\r\nMadrid, Istanbul and many other locations. If the need for\r\nreform was pressing then, it is critical now. The High-\r\nlevel Panel provides the best prospect for repositioning\r\nthe United Nations system to meet contemporary\r\nchallenges. This is an opportunity we cannot waste if the\r\nUnited Nations — our Organization — is to retain a\r\nsubstantial role in maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity in the twenty-first century.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): We have heard\r\nthe last speaker in the general debate of the fifty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nOver the past two weeks, the leaders of our\r\nrespective nations have expressed their views on the\r\nmajor issues of concern to our world. As I now draw\r\nour preliminary conclusions, many of these speakers\r\nhave already gone home to their countries. However,\r\ntheir statements and their policies still continue to\r\nresonate here. I was particularly struck by the\r\nforcefulness of the ideas expressed, and have no doubt\r\nthat they will continue to inspire and guide our\r\ndeliberations. I appreciated in particular the show of\r\nsolidarity for collectively tackling the threats and\r\nchallenges facing mankind.\r\nI had an opportunity, on the sidelines of our\r\ndebate, to speak with a large number of high-level\r\nrepresentatives and leaders of Member States. Those\r\ntalks reaffirmed the will of our leaders to strengthen\r\nthe role and authority of the General Assembly and\r\ntheir dedication to multilateralism, which forms the\r\nbasis for the goals and objectives pursued by the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIt is clear that we will need to do even more to\r\nroot our action in the spirit of the Charter to provide it\r\nwith strength and legitimacy. Here, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call to advance the rule of law and strengthen\r\nthe role of the United Nations — which, in the words\r\nof the Millennium Declaration, remains “the\r\nindispensable common house of the entire human\r\nfamily” (A/59/PV.3, p. 2) — should be a further source\r\nof inspiration throughout the present session.\r\nOf the 191 States Member of the United Nations,\r\n190 of them, plus two observers, took the floor during\r\nthe general debate. Among the Member States, 81 were\r\nrepresented by their respective heads of State or\r\nGovernment.\r\nOf the 190 statements made by Member States,\r\n121 took up the question of the reform of the United\r\nNations, emphasizing both the progress made and the\r\nroad that lies ahead. A considerable number of those\r\nstatements in fact contained specific proposals urging\r\nus to continue improving the functioning and the\r\neffectiveness of our Organization.\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nA great majority of the world’s leaders\r\nspecifically underscored reform of the United Nations\r\nsystem, particularly reform of the Security Council,\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and progress\r\ntowards the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Our leaders all indicated their\r\ninterest in the report we are awaiting from the High-\r\nLevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change,\r\nappointed by the Secretary-General to consider threats\r\nto international peace and security and collective\r\nmeasures that can contribute to overcoming them.\r\nOf all these issues, reform of the Security\r\nCouncil prompted the greatest number of comments\r\nand statements. Indeed, 140 Member States spoke of\r\nthat issue. A majority indicated a preference for\r\nenlargement of both categories of members —\r\npermanent and non-permanent. Others wished to see\r\nsolely an enlargement of the non-permanent\r\nmembership. Still others would be prepared to accept a\r\nreform of the Security Council whatever option was\r\ndecided on. Because of the importance that our leaders\r\nattach to Security Council reform, I shall devote\r\nparticular attention to the efforts we still need to make\r\nto achieve consensus on that issue.\r\nThe revitalization of the work of the General\r\nAssembly was also a subject of great concern for most\r\nMember States, which welcomed the progress achieved\r\nduring the fifty-eighth session. They emphasized the\r\nneed, however, to implement the recommendations\r\nalready adopted and to pursue the process. In that\r\ncontext, I shall be working in close cooperation with\r\nthe other members of the Bureau.\r\nI would like to take advantage of this opportunity\r\nto announce that this very afternoon, the Presidents of\r\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and I will be meeting to strengthen\r\ncooperation, coordination and the complementarity of\r\nthe programmes of work of those three principal\r\norgans, in accordance with the responsibilities\r\nallocated them by the Charter and under our previous\r\nresolutions on the revitalization of our work. In the\r\nsame spirit, it is my intention to hold similar meetings\r\nduring the next few months, and I am counting on the\r\ncooperation and the continued readiness of my\r\ncounterparts from the Security Council and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nConcerning the Goals defined in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, Member States deplored the slow progress\r\nin implementing the Millennium Development Goals\r\nby 2015 and evinced considerable interest in the 2005\r\nsummit. I call for cooperation from the Assembly to\r\nensure proper preparation for that summit. Allow me to\r\ntake this opportunity once again to urgently appeal to\r\nall Member States, individually and collectively, to\r\nredouble our efforts in order to fill the gaps in the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe worst mistake would be a failure to act.\r\nSo too, the debate revealed the need to deal with\r\nthe situation of the least developed countries, of\r\nlandlocked countries and of small island developing\r\nStates, regarding their economic, social and climatic\r\nvulnerability. Many representatives advocated the\r\nformulation of more equitable policies to promote the\r\neconomic growth of the developing countries and to\r\nbetter integrate them into the global economy.\r\nParticular stress was placed on the situation of Africa\r\nand on the need to support the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development.\r\nConcerned by the deterioration of the\r\nenvironment, the Assembly drew attention to the need\r\nto take appropriate corrective measures and\r\nunderscored the importance of ratifying the Kyoto\r\nProtocol.\r\nOur leaders also stressed the need to strengthen\r\ninternational peace and security, in particular by\r\nfighting the phenomenon of terrorism, strengthening\r\nmeans for preventing and combating the resurgence of\r\ncrises and armed conflicts, and controlling the spread\r\nof weapons of mass destruction and the illicit trade in\r\nsmall arms and light weapons.\r\nVirtually all speakers expressed their concern\r\nabout the situation in Iraq and asked the United\r\nNations to assist, to the best of its ability, the people of\r\nIraq in rebuilding their country.\r\nMember States continue to believe that the road\r\nmap sets out the only route to follow to stabilize the\r\nsituation in the Middle East. The meeting of the\r\nQuartet held on 22 September alongside the general\r\ndebate will, I hope, provide new impetus to the peace\r\nprocess.\r\nThe situation in Africa, particularly the conflicts\r\nin Darfur and in the Great Lakes region, was of\r\nparticular concern.\r\nThe guidelines that have been laid down by our\r\nleaders sketch out the framework in which the work of\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nthe present session will be taking place. As I have\r\nalready indicated, the present session will be key in\r\nthat it will have the great responsibility of preparing\r\nfor the major events that will mark the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the Organization next year. I know that I\r\ncan count on the cooperation and support of members\r\nso that together we will be able to conclude the work of\r\nthe present session successfully.\r\nTwo representatives have asked to speak in\r\nexercise of the right of reply. I remind representatives\r\nthat statements in exercise of the right of reply are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to\r\nfive minutes for the second, and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nI now give the floor to the representative of the\r\nSudan.\r\nMr. Awad Mohamed Hassan (Sudan) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I wish to respond to the inappropriate and\r\nnegative accusations directed against the Sudan by the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Eritrea in his statement\r\nto the Assembly (see A/59/PV.16).\r\nI regret to say that the authoritarian, rogue\r\nEritrean regime has practised the most brutal forms of\r\ndictatorship against its people, in violation of their\r\nmost fundamental rights. We have no wish to respond\r\nto the allegations made against Sudan by the Eritrean\r\ndelegation, but we would like to ask whether Eritrea is\r\nqualified to speak about the political status and\r\nstability of other countries. Eritrea is a State that lacks\r\ngood governance and even the most rudimentary\r\ninstitutional and governmental elements. It is a State\r\nadministered by one authoritarian and psychotic\r\nabsolute dictator, who has wrested the most basic\r\nhuman rights from his people and has jailed all his\r\nformer comrades-in-arms, who brought him to power\r\nin an independent Eritrea. He has continued to carry\r\nout a policy of assassinations and physical liquidation.\r\nWe would like to ask the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Eritrea: where are his comrades-in-arms and\r\nformer Ministers for Foreign Affairs? They are in\r\nprison, suffering under very difficult health conditions.\r\nHe himself does not know where they are imprisoned.\r\nWhere are his former comrades-in-arms and former\r\nMinisters of Defence? Some are in jail, and others have\r\nchosen to take refuge outside the country, fearing the\r\nbrutality of their authoritarian dictator. Where are\r\nEritrea’s ambassadors abroad, including the most\r\nrecent ambassador to the United Nations, a man known\r\nto everybody? He has taken political asylum — as have\r\nother ambassadors, in Sweden, in Britain and in other\r\ncountries.\r\nThe authoritarian Eritrean regime has the worst\r\nhuman rights record of all, as reflected in a recent\r\nAmnesty International report, which bears witness to\r\nthe situation in Eritrea over the past 10 years. The\r\nEritrean dictatorship has continued to practice all\r\nforms of animosity and hostility against its neighbours.\r\nIts attack on islands belonging to Yemen, its unjustified\r\nwar against Ethiopia and its repeated attacks on the\r\neastern borders of the Sudan are good examples of that\r\nhostility.\r\nThat internationally isolated regime continues to\r\nviolate international covenants and international law. It\r\nmaintains camps for training and arming members of\r\ngroups that oppose my country. It continues to conspire\r\nto destroy, demolish and destabilize the region. The\r\nopen presence of members of the Sudanese opposition\r\nin Eritrea is the best example of that fact.\r\nThe rogue Eritrean regime should be the last to\r\nspeak of stability in the Sudan and in the region. It is\r\nthe one that is fuelling all the strife, conflict and\r\nviolence in my country and in other countries in the\r\nregion.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I call on the\r\nrepresentatives of Eritrea.\r\nMr. Tekle (Eritrea): The Eritrean delegation is\r\ntaking the floor in exercise of its right of reply against\r\nthe slanderous statement made by the delegation of the\r\nSudan in exercise of the right of reply to the statement\r\nmade yesterday by the Eritrean Foreign Minister.\r\nThe history of the Sudan is a history of conflict\r\nthat started almost at its independence nearly five\r\ndecades ago, so much earlier than Eritrea’s\r\nindependence in 1991. Therefore, the Sudan cannot\r\nblame a new nation for its multiple — and multiplying —\r\nproblems. In truth, the Sudan has nine neighbours and,\r\nduring the past half century, has had 10 enemies,\r\nincluding itself: the Sudan is its own worst enemy.\r\nThe genocide in Darfur may be attracting more\r\ninternational attention now, but the fact is that the\r\nSudan has been ravaged by civil strife throughout its\r\nindependent existence and that it has antagonized its\r\nimmediate neighbours and countries beyond. It has\r\nbeen a primary exporter of terrorism, particularly\r\nduring the past decade and a half. Who can forget that\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.17\r\nit hosted and gave safe haven to both Carlos the Jackal\r\nand Osama bin Laden? Who can forget the\r\nassassination attempts against President Mubarak of\r\nEgypt in Addis Ababa, where he had gone to attend a\r\nmeeting of the Organization for African Unity? Who\r\ncan forget the attempt to assassinate my own President\r\nby a Sudanese security officer in the same year? And\r\nwhat about the terrorist group organized by Hassan\r\nal-Turabi and Osama bin Laden against our new\r\ncountry only two years after our independence in 1993,\r\nand against several of its neighbours? Can anyone\r\nforget the Belgian tourists whose throats were cut by\r\nterrorist groups financed and trained by the Sudan, or\r\nthe British mining officer who a year and a half ago\r\nwas savagely mutilated only a day after he had\r\ne-mailed his wife about the good time he was having in\r\nEritrea?\r\nThe latest terrorist attacks against Eritrea\r\noccurred on 23 May, during Independence Day\r\ncelebrations in the towns of Barentu and Tesseney. We\r\nlost about a dozen people, while almost a score were\r\nwounded. Among them were women, children and\r\nelderly people.\r\nThe Sudanese delegation speaks about members\r\nof the Sudanese opposition in Eritrea. The National\r\nDemocratic Alliance has an office in Asmara, as it has\r\nin other African countries and in Europe. It is not a\r\nclandestine movement unknown to the Sudan and the\r\nworld. Indeed, members of the Sudanese Government,\r\nincluding the President of the Sudan himself, officially\r\nvisited Asmara on several occasions to hold peace\r\nnegotiations with the leadership of the National\r\nDemocratic Alliance. Eritrea is proud to have made the\r\narrangements for those meetings and to have acted as\r\nfacilitator. Needless to say, the Eritrean delegation\r\nrejects the silly accusations levelled by the Sudanese\r\ndelegation. They are intended to distract attention from\r\nDarfur and the Sudan’s other problems.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.\r\n"
