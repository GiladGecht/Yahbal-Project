(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nOrganization of work, adoption of the agenda and\r\nallocation of items: reports of the General Committee\r\nSecond report of the General Committee\r\n(A/59/250/Add.1)\r\nLetter from the Chairman of the Committee on\r\nConferences (A/59/351/Add.1)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I should first\r\nlike to draw the attention of representatives to the\r\nsecond report of the General Committee\r\n(A/59/250/Add.1).\r\nIn paragraph 1 of the report, the General\r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that\r\nan additional sub-item, entitled “Cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the community of Portuguese-\r\nspeaking countries”, be included under agenda item 56,\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nand other organizations”, under heading I,\r\nOrganizational, administrative and other matters. May I\r\ntake it that the General Assembly decides to include\r\nthat additional sub-item in the agenda of the current\r\nsession as a sub-item of agenda item 56 under\r\nheading I?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The General\r\nCommittee further recommends that this additional\r\nsub-item be considered directly in plenary meeting.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to\r\nconsider this sub-item directly in plenary meeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I should like to\r\ninform members that the new sub-item becomes sub-\r\nitem (t) of agenda item 56.\r\nIn paragraph 2 of the report, the General\r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that\r\nan additional item, entitled “Observer status for the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States in the\r\nGeneral Assembly”, be included in the agenda of the\r\ncurrent session under heading I, Organizational,\r\nadministrative and other matters. May I take it that the\r\nGeneral Assembly decides to include this additional\r\nitem in the agenda of the current session under\r\nheading I?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The General\r\nCommittee further recommends that the additional item\r\nbe allocated to the Sixth Committee. May I take it that\r\nthe General Assembly decides to allocate this item to\r\nthe Sixth Committee?\r\nIt is was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I should like to\r\ninform members that this item becomes agenda item\r\n159.\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nIn paragraph 3 of the same document, the General\r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that\r\nagenda item 109, “Programme planning”, also be\r\nallocated to the Third Committee with respect to\r\nprogramme 19, Human rights, of the proposed strategic\r\nframework for the period 2006-2007. May I take it that\r\nthe General Assembly also decides to allocate this item\r\nto the Third Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Chairmen\r\nof the Third and Sixth Committees will be informed of\r\nthe decisions just taken by the General Assembly.\r\nI now wish to draw the attention of members to\r\nparagraph 4 of the General Committee’s report. In that\r\nparagraph, the Committee took note of the clarification\r\nthat, in implementing resolution 58/316 of 1 July 2004\r\nto consider item 12, “Report of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council”, in its entirety in plenary, the relevant\r\nparts of chapter I of the report that are under agenda\r\nitems already allocated to the Main Committees will be\r\nconsidered by the Committee concerned for final\r\naction by the General Assembly.\r\nThe Assembly will now turn its attention to\r\ndocument A/59/351/Add.1, which contains a letter\r\ndated 27 September 2004 from the Chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Conferences addressed to the President\r\nof the General Assembly regarding a request by the\r\nUnited Nations Administrative Tribunal to meet during\r\nthe main part of the fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMembers are aware that, pursuant to section I,\r\nparagraph 7, of Assembly resolution 40/243, no\r\nsubsidiary organ of the General Assembly may meet at\r\nUnited Nations Headquarters during the substantive\r\npart of a regular session of the Assembly unless\r\nexplicitly authorized to do so by the Assembly.\r\nIn this connection, may I take it that it is the wish\r\nof the General Assembly to authorize the United\r\nNations Administrative Tribunal to meet during the\r\nsubstantive part of the fifty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, on the strict understanding that\r\nsuch a meeting would have to be accommodated within\r\navailable facilities and services?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda items 52 and 54\r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations system\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/59/354)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The General\r\nAssembly will consider, in a joint debate, agenda items\r\n52 and 54.\r\nIn connection with agenda item 54, the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General in response to the report of the\r\nPanel of Eminent Persons on United Nations-Civil\r\nSociety Relations has been circulated in document\r\nA/59/354.\r\nI give the floor to the Deputy Secretary-General,\r\nMs. Louise Fréchette, to introduce the report of the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nThe Deputy Secretary-General: Thank you,\r\nMr. President, for having given me this opportunity to\r\nspeak to the General Assembly about the relationship\r\nbetween the United Nations and civil society. Two\r\ndocuments are now before the Assembly: the report of\r\nthe Panel of Eminent Persons headed by former\r\nPresident Cardoso; and the Secretary-General’s own\r\nresponse to that report.\r\nAs members know, the relationship between the\r\nUnited Nations and civil society is as old as the Charter\r\nitself. But in the past decade, there has been an\r\nenormous transformation in the nature and importance\r\nof the role played by civil society on the global scene.\r\nWhere once global conferences were largely the realm\r\nof Governments, today it would be unthinkable to stage\r\nsuch events without the unique advocacy and\r\nmobilization of non-governmental actors. Non-\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs) have always been\r\nkey partners of the United Nations at the country level,\r\nin both development work and in the delivery of\r\nhumanitarian assistance, but today they are making\r\nincreasingly important contributions to global policy\r\ndebates and intergovernmental deliberations in areas\r\nranging from the environment to gender\r\nmainstreaming.\r\nSuch exponential growth in both numbers and\r\ninfluence has created a range of new challenges for the\r\nUnited Nations. The Secretary-General established the\r\nCardoso Panel to assess and draw lessons from the\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\ninteraction of the United Nations with civil society, and\r\nrecommend ways to improve it.\r\nThe Panel consulted widely with Member States\r\nand with a range of networks, constituencies and\r\ngroups. I think that members will agree that its report\r\nis an impressive document. It contains well-considered\r\nand innovative recommendations that offer a solid\r\nbasis for discussion and debate. The Secretary-General\r\nhopes that his response will assist the Assembly in\r\ntaking those proposals forward.\r\nThe starting point for all of these\r\nrecommendations is that the United Nations is and will\r\nremain an intergovernmental Organization in which\r\ndecisions are taken by its Member States, and nothing\r\nin either of the reports calls that fundamental principle\r\ninto question. But the Panel makes two important\r\nappeals to Member States.\r\nFirst, the Panel argues that the United Nations\r\nmust become an even more outward-looking\r\nOrganization, or in the words of the Cardoso report, a\r\n“networking” Organization. That means using its\r\nunique convening power to reach out to non-\r\ngovernmental actors, especially where such actors\r\ncommand great expertise or resources relevant to a\r\nparticular issue. In so doing, the Organization will\r\nexpand its global reach and influence.\r\nSecondly, the Panel argues that the United\r\nNations needs to do more to connect the global with\r\nthe local. By this, it means preventing any disconnect\r\nbetween statements and policy discussions in\r\nintergovernmental forums and life as it is lived by\r\npeople in slums, conflict areas and other zones of need\r\nthroughout the world. The articulation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals has helped to close\r\nthat gap, since those Goals can guide national\r\nstrategies, which, in turn, can be implemented by local\r\nauthorities and community-based organizations. But\r\nmuch more needs to be done so that people can feel\r\nthat their agenda is the agenda of the United Nations.\r\nThe Secretary-General welcomes the Panel’s vision,\r\nand supports it.\r\nIn responding to these appeals, and in adapting\r\nour Organization, we are not starting from scratch.\r\nMember States have been very creative in developing\r\nnew forms of interaction with civil society. Round-\r\ntable and panel discussions, open debates of the\r\nSecurity Council and other such steps are now regular\r\nfeatures of the United Nations calendar.\r\nThe Panel’s report and the Secretary-General’s\r\nresponse seek to embed, expand and deepen the\r\nparticipation of different constituencies in the work of\r\nthe intergovernmental bodies. The Secretary-General\r\nsuggests action in six main areas.\r\nFirst, the contribution of NGOs in\r\nintergovernmental bodies should be built into the\r\nregular business of the Assembly. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral suggests, for instance, that Member States\r\ncould hold interactive hearings with NGO\r\nrepresentatives before each session of the General\r\nAssembly, and before major events, such as next year’s\r\nhigh-level meeting on HIV/AIDS.\r\nSecondly, the Secretary-General will establish a\r\nsingle trust fund in order to facilitate and increase the\r\nparticipation of representatives of NGOs from\r\ndeveloping countries. Thirdly, the accreditation process\r\nshould be improved and simplified by establishing a\r\nsingle system of accrediting and streamlining certain\r\naspects of the process. Fourthly, the Secretariat’s own\r\ndialogue with NGOs at Headquarters should be\r\nimproved, including by giving them easier access to\r\ninformation and documentation.\r\nFifthly, engagement with NGOs at the country\r\nlevel should likewise be intensified, including through\r\nbetter and more regular interaction with the resident\r\ncoordinators, and through steps to strengthen the\r\ncapacity of local NGOs. Sixthly, the new Partnerships\r\nOffice should be tasked with ensuring greater\r\ncoherence among the disparate units within the\r\nSecretariat that currently interact with different\r\nconstituencies.\r\nTaken together, the proposals of the Panel and the\r\nSecretary-General aim to strengthen the United\r\nNations, enrich intergovernmental debate and, most\r\nimportantly, improve the services that we provide to\r\nthe world’s people. They are the results of very broad\r\nconsultations among a full range of stakeholders —\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental. It goes without\r\nsaying that the implementation of the Assembly’s\r\ndecisions can move forward only with the cooperation\r\nof all concerned. The Secretary-General hopes that\r\nmembers will give positive consideration to the\r\nrecommendations he has placed before them, and that\r\nthey will be able to reach agreement by the end of the\r\nfall session.\r\nThe contribution of civil society groups to the\r\nUnited Nations has been invaluable. The time is right\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nto take this partnership one step further for the benefit\r\nof this Organization and the people whom it was\r\ncreated to serve.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I thank the\r\nDeputy Secretary-General.\r\nMr. Van den Berg (Netherlands): I have the\r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU).\r\nThe candidate countries Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey\r\nand Croatia; the countries of the Stabilization and\r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Albania,\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, the Former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, and Serbia and Montenegro;\r\nand the European Free Trade Association (EFTA)\r\ncountries Iceland and Norway, members of the\r\nEuropean Economic Area, align themselves with this\r\nstatement.\r\nLet me first of all thank the Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral for her introduction to this debate and in\r\nparticular for her introduction of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General in response to the report of the Panel\r\nof Eminent Persons on United Nations-Civil Society\r\nRelations (A/59/354).\r\nThe European Union welcomes the opportunity of\r\nthis joint debate. It underlines the need to address both\r\nthe strengthening of the United Nations itself and the\r\nstrengthening of its intergovernmental structures. With\r\n25 member States, the European Union represents 13\r\nper cent of the United Nations membership. The EU\r\nmember States contribute more than 36 per cent of the\r\nregular budget of the United Nations and make about\r\n50 per cent of all voluntary contributions to United\r\nNations funds and programmes. It goes without saying\r\nthat the EU attaches high priority to an effective and\r\nefficient United Nations system.\r\nIn the view of the European Union, the United\r\nNations is uniquely placed to provide the framework\r\nfor international cooperation. It has no substitute in the\r\ninternational community. But the Organization has to\r\nadapt to changing conditions, and that requires reform,\r\nnot for reform’s sake, but in order to make the United\r\nNations stronger.\r\nThe European Union considers the United\r\nNations high- level event of September 2005 a logical\r\nculmination point to agree on change and\r\nimplementation. The event will review the progress\r\nmade in the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and related goals in the field of peace,\r\ngovernance and development, the progress made\r\ntowards reaching the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nand the follow-up to the major economic and social\r\nconferences and summits on the strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations. At a later date in the plenary, we will\r\nhave a more in-depth discussion on the precise\r\nobjectives and modalities of the summit.\r\nOur statement will address three issues related to\r\ntoday’s debate.\r\nFirst, we will assess the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in strengthening the Organization, taking as\r\nbenchmarks in particular his far-reaching proposals of\r\n1997 and 2002; secondly, we will focus on the concrete\r\ntasks before us to further streamline and strengthen the\r\nwork of the General Assembly; and, thirdly, we will\r\ngive the European Union’s preliminary views on the\r\nso-called Cardoso report on relations between the\r\nUnited Nations and civil society.\r\nIn general terms, the European Union is of the\r\nopinion that the Secretary-General, sometimes in the\r\nface of opposition by Member States, has managed to\r\nintroduce courageous and constructive changes to the\r\nOrganization. Still, a great deal more needs to be done,\r\nand Member States need to fully support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in achieving further necessary reforms.\r\nIn the area of intergovernmental reform, for\r\nwhich Member States bear primary responsibility, only\r\nlimited progress has been achieved. Proposals often\r\nhave been met with resistance or with suspicion. The\r\nSecretary-General has often been reluctant to give his\r\nadvice on intergovernmental reform, but, possibly,\r\nproposals from his side could help to speed up the\r\nprocess.\r\nLet me touch upon the institutional side of United\r\nNations reform. Many important initiatives have been\r\ntaken by the Secretary-General since he took office: the\r\n“Renewing the United Nations” report in 1997; the\r\nBrahimi report in 2000; and, most recently, the\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations” report in 2002.\r\nLet us take a moment to review what has been\r\nachieved.\r\nAll of the Secretary-General’s initiatives share a\r\ncommon purpose: streamlining the internal functioning\r\nof the United Nations system, in order to ensure that\r\navailable resources are spent in the most efficient way\r\npossible to achieve the goals of the Organization. Thus,\r\nwe should examine whether the Secretary-General has\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nmanaged to markedly improve the internal efficiency\r\nof the United Nations since 1997. Let us take a look at\r\nthe progress made in some of the main areas featured\r\nin the reports of the Secretary-General.\r\nWith respect to the rationalization of the United\r\nNations system, today we see a more logical structure\r\nof the United Nations. Departments have been grouped\r\ntogether, common themes have been identified, and the\r\ncreation of systemic linkages such as the Chief\r\nExecutive Board have improved communications\r\nwithin a sprawling Organization.\r\nAt the country level, many previously separate\r\nactivities have been consolidated through the\r\nestablishment of shared offices and a stronger Resident\r\nCoordinator position. The United Nations is\r\nincreasingly using shared tools such as the United\r\nNations Development Assistance Framework and the\r\nCommon Country Assessment.\r\nAs concerns peacekeeping operations, there is\r\nnow movement towards a clearer, more concise\r\nplanning process, aimed at improving the deployment\r\nof peacekeeping operations. However, further\r\nimprovements are needed.\r\nIn the area of human rights, the Office of the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights has moved\r\nforward with actions to improve both its internal\r\nmanagement and the services it provides to Member\r\nStates. Protecting, promoting and supporting human\r\nrights at the country level remains a priority. The\r\nEuropean Union fully supports the efforts of the Office\r\nof the High Commissioner to strengthen human rights-\r\nrelated United Nations actions at the country level\r\nbased on Action 2 of the Secretary-General’s\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations: An agenda for\r\nfurther change”.\r\nWe welcome the efforts of human rights treaty\r\nbodies to streamline reporting procedures. The\r\nimportance of an effective Commission on Human\r\nRights as the pre-eminent body for the protection and\r\npromotion of human rights is crucial, in particular in\r\nthe light of new threats, challenges and changes.\r\nTurning to human resources management,\r\nmeasures such as better human resources planning and\r\ngreater adaptability for the Secretary-General as\r\nconcerns the staffing table are clear steps to better\r\nmanage the Organization’s most valuable asset: its\r\nstaff.\r\nRegarding the budget cycle, we have seen\r\nadaptations — although in small steps — to the\r\nunwieldy budget process. Slowly but surely, the budget\r\nprocess is becoming better equipped to link the\r\nOrganization’s resource to its priorities. The adaptation\r\nof the principles of results-based budgeting is a further\r\npositive development.\r\nAll this is still a work in progress. There is still a\r\ngreat deal of overlap in the activities of separate United\r\nNations bodies. Integrated planning at the\r\nHeadquarters level still needs significant improvement.\r\nThe level of United Nations cooperation in the field\r\nvaries greatly per country, and many human resource\r\nmanagement instruments remain archaic by modern\r\nstandards. Several necessary changes to the budget\r\ncycle are long overdue. The concerns of the European\r\nUnion regarding many of these matters are well known\r\nto all.\r\nHowever, let us be frank. Much still needs to be\r\ndone, but we are further along now than many in this\r\nroom anticipated several years ago. The fact that much\r\nof the work remains to be done can only be attributed\r\nto indecisiveness on the part of Member States. We\r\ncannot only look to the Secretary-General for reform.\r\nMany of his proposals could have been bold steps\r\nforward for this Organization, but we, the Member\r\nStates, seem too often to prefer the lowest common\r\ndenominator.\r\nIt is now up to us, the Member States, to provide\r\nthe support and to maintain the momentum for change.\r\nWe cannot get bogged down in endless debate. The\r\nSecretary-General is doing his part; we must not lag\r\nbehind. The ball is in our court.\r\nThe European Union will remain strongly\r\nfocused on the reform process. This year, several\r\nimportant institutional issues are before us. First, we\r\nwill have to take decisions on a potentially major\r\noverhaul of the safety and security policies of the\r\nOrganization, both at Headquarters and in the field.\r\nThe EU looks forward to receiving the Secretariat’s\r\nreport on safety and security and will support\r\nappropriate improvements in security measures.\r\nSecondly, we will have to approve the new\r\nbiennial strategic framework, which will better link\r\nresources to the priorities of the Organization.\r\nThirdly, we must try to improve human resources\r\nmanagement. Better mobility of staff, improvement of\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nmanagement, clarification of contractual agreements,\r\ngender balance and rejuvenation of the work force are\r\nsome of the issues important to the EU.\r\nI have already stated that we, the Member States,\r\nneed to take an active part in the strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations. Let me address some issues of an\r\nintergovernmental nature, in particular those related to\r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly itself.\r\nThe EU gives its full support to the changes that\r\nwere agreed upon in resolutions 58/126 and 58/316.\r\nWe pay our respect to the determination of the previous\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Julian Hunte, and\r\nwe will rely fully on your leadership, Sir, to continue\r\nthis important work.\r\nResolution 58/316 clearly identified the further\r\nwork to be undertaken and to be concluded during the\r\nfifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. The key\r\ntasks before us are the following.\r\nFirst, we have to further rationalize the agendas\r\nof the Main Committees by biennialization,\r\ntriennialization, clustering and elimination of items.\r\nRecommendations have to be made to the General\r\nAssembly in plenary meeting. It has to take a decision\r\nby 1 April 2005. The Bureaux have a major\r\nresponsibility in moving this process forward. The\r\nGeneral Committee must play a stimulating role in\r\norder to ensure that the General Assembly can take a\r\ndecision by April 2005.\r\nSecondly, the working methods of the General\r\nCommittee have to be further improved. Here again,\r\nrecommendations have to be made to the Assembly for\r\nits decision by April 2005. The General Committee\r\nshould play a more active role in steering and\r\nmonitoring the effective progress of the Assembly.\r\nThirdly, the burden of documentation has to be\r\nfurther reduced. There should be core reports\r\nhighlighting major issues for discussion. This is\r\nessential if all delegations are to be in a position to\r\neffectively deal with all matters under consideration by\r\nthe Assembly. The General Committee has been\r\nrequested to make recommendations to this General\r\nAssembly.\r\nFourthly, the General Assembly will have to\r\nmake further efforts to streamline the agenda of the\r\nplenary. We took some modest steps. We need bolder\r\ndecisions.\r\nFifthly, and finally, the EU believes that the\r\nGeneral Assembly should streamline the number and\r\nthe length of the approximately 300 annual resolutions\r\nwith a view to giving the Assembly more impact.\r\nThe EU stands ready, Mr. President, to support\r\nyou fully in achieving concrete results in the further\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. We call for a\r\ntransparent but clearly practical process that will lead\r\nto visible and effective results.\r\nObviously, reforming and rationalizing the\r\nGeneral Assembly is only one part of strengthening the\r\nintergovernmental system. With regard to the Security\r\nCouncil, the EU believes that there is a need for a\r\ncomprehensive reform to make the Council more\r\nrepresentative, more effective and more democratic.\r\nI will now embark on my third issue, the report of\r\nthe Panel of Eminent Persons on United Nations-Civil\r\nSociety Relations, A/58/817.\r\nGlobal policy issues are no longer the realm of\r\nGovernments alone. The EU, therefore, welcomes the\r\nreport of the Panel of Eminent Persons on United\r\nNations-Civil Society Relations as an important\r\ncontribution to the ongoing debate about giving civil\r\nsociety greater opportunities to contribute to the work\r\nof the United Nations. The EU thanks the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his recent report contained in document\r\nA/59/354 in response to the report of the Panel under\r\nthe chairmanship of Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The\r\nEU agrees with the Secretary-General that the world\r\ntoday is remarkably different from the one in which the\r\nUnited Nations was founded nearly 60 years ago.\r\nIn order to meet the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, the United Nations must become a more\r\noutward-looking Organization. It must become more\r\ngrounded in reality. Nothing can serve this purpose\r\nbetter than closer interaction with civil society.\r\nThe EU welcomes the broad vision of the Panel\r\nand believes that the proposals of the Panel and the\r\nSecretary-General form a good basis for our\r\ndiscussions. We favour innovative forms of interaction\r\nwith civil society, including hearings before major\r\npolicy-setting events. Such hearings should be focused,\r\nin order to provide input into our debates. We should\r\nalso look into the possibility of allowing non-\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs) to take part in\r\ncertain debates of the General Assembly.\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nWe share the Panel’s view that the accreditation\r\nprocess for NGOs is in need of streamlining. The EU\r\nsees merit in introducing elements of greater coherence\r\nand predictability into processes for accrediting NGOs\r\nto various United Nations bodies and conferences, with\r\npre-screening of NGO applications by the Secretariat.\r\nWe would welcome a role for the General Assembly in\r\nthis process.\r\nThe European Union supports the Panel’s call for\r\nan even stronger participation of civil society\r\norganizations from developing countries. We believe\r\nthat the existing financing mechanisms should be\r\nfurther explored so as to improve their participation.\r\nGiven the relevant input of women’s organizations so\r\nfar, their participation deserves further encouragement.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the steps already\r\nundertaken by the Secretary-General to enhance\r\ncountry-level engagement with NGOs. We welcome\r\nthe Secretary-General’s proposal to enlarge the\r\nPartnerships Office. In our view, this proposal should\r\nbe further explored.\r\nThe European Union looks forward to a\r\nconstructive debate on the Panel’s report and to an\r\noutcome that will effectively enhance the relations\r\nbetween the United Nations and civil society. Civil\r\nsociety and other stakeholders mentioned in the report\r\nshould be given an opportunity to feed their views and\r\ncomments into the debate.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to emphasize the European\r\nUnion’s full commitment to contribute actively and\r\nconstructively to the ongoing comprehensive reform\r\nprocess of the United Nations. As stated, improving the\r\nefficiency and effectiveness of United Nations bodies,\r\npolicies and processes is a priority for the EU. We\r\nunderline the need to strengthen the United Nations\r\ninstitutions. We wish to honour the commitments\r\ncontained in chapter VIII of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. There is clearly a window of opportunity\r\nfor change and improvement — a window that may not\r\nremain open indefinitely. The high-level meeting of\r\nSeptember 2005 may well be a decisive moment for\r\nsubstantial change. We would be rightfully blamed if\r\nwe were to miss that opportunity.\r\nMr. Dauth (Australia): It is my privilege to speak\r\non behalf of Canada, New Zealand and Australia in this\r\njoint debate on agenda item 52, “Revitalization of the\r\nwork of the General Assembly”, and agenda item 54,\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations system”. In that\r\ncontext, I would like on behalf of Canada, New\r\nZealand and Australia to join with our friends from the\r\nEuropean Union in thanking most sincerely our friend\r\nthe Deputy Secretary-General for her helpful\r\nintroduction this morning to the Cardoso report.\r\nMr. President, the efforts of your predecessor,\r\nJulian Hunte, helped impart new energy into the\r\nprocess of revitalizing the General Assembly, which\r\nhad, frankly, produced rather little in recent years. Two\r\nresolutions emerged, as members know, containing a\r\nfew useful steps and some valuable principles, but we\r\nwill need to advance the process again during the fifty-\r\nninth session and beyond if we are indeed to revitalize\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nAs our delegations have said many times before,\r\nthe fundamental cause of the malaise in the Assembly\r\nis an overloaded, outdated, repetitive and often\r\nirrelevant agenda. The decision in our last resolution to\r\narrange the agenda according to the priorities of the\r\nmedium-term plan is promising and can help us to\r\nstreamline our work in a manner that will make the\r\nAssembly a more effective and relevant body in the\r\ninterests of all Member States. The Main Committees\r\nshould be rigorous and bold in the task of making\r\nrecommendations for rationalizing items before\r\n30 April 2005. They should clear away the detritus of\r\nyears past and create space to address the\r\ncontemporary challenges facing us all.\r\nThis year, we must also act to stem the vast flow\r\nof documents. There seems to be wide agreement that\r\nthe United Nations produces far too many\r\ndocuments — at the behest of Member States — and\r\nthat many of them are never read, but we have not yet\r\nacted. The idea that the President and Main Committee\r\nchairpersons would consolidate reporting requests at\r\nthe end of each session is worth trying, and each of the\r\nMain Committees should curtail the quantity of\r\ndocuments they request. They could look at that in\r\nconjunction with their review of the agenda. A similar\r\nexercise is needed in the Economic and Social Council\r\nand its subsidiaries.\r\nFinally, we must use the General Committee to\r\nmanage more rigorously and effectively the work of\r\nthe Assembly. Australia and New Zealand are members\r\nof the Committee this session and we look forward to\r\nassisting in that task.\r\nCanada, New Zealand and Australia appreciate\r\nthe work of the Secretary-General and his Panel on\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nUnited Nations-Civil Society Relations for their work\r\non expanding and deepening the relationship between\r\nthe United Nations and civil society.\r\nAs civil society organizations have grown in their\r\nscope and responsibilities at the global and local levels,\r\nthey have become ever more important actors,\r\npossessing expertise, enthusiasm and networks across\r\nthe global agenda. Participation by non-governmental\r\norganizations in intergovernmental processes can lead\r\nto better decisions, better outreach and more effective\r\nimplementation, and collaboration with non-\r\ngovernmental organizations on the ground is essential\r\nfor achieving our collective goals in development,\r\nhumanitarian assistance and peace and security.\r\nWe therefore agree wholeheartedly with the\r\nSecretary-General that the United Nations and its\r\nmajor organs will benefit from interacting more\r\nextensively with civil society, and it is timely to\r\nconsider how the Organization can best do so, rather\r\nthan to continue as we presently are, on an ad hoc\r\nbasis.\r\nWe look forward to discussing the proposals\r\ncontained in the report in more detail at a subsequent\r\ntime and would appreciate your advice, Sir, on how we\r\nwill proceed. For now, I simply wish to comment on\r\nfour of the proposals before us.\r\nFirst, the Secretary-General’s proposal to allow\r\nnon-governmental organizations to participate in the\r\nwork of the General Assembly could be another step on\r\nthe path of revitalization. Without detracting from the\r\nfundamental, intergovernmental character of the\r\nAssembly, a greater dialogue with non-governmental\r\norganizations in formal and informal settings would be\r\nof value. We would, of course, need to define carefully\r\nthe rights and responsibilities that we extend to non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. I note particularly the\r\nremarks of the Deputy Secretary-General in that\r\ncontext.\r\nSecondly, the proposal for a single accreditation\r\nprocess, with a greater Secretariat role in screening\r\napplications for intergovernmental review, would be a\r\nsensible and welcome reform. Rather than maintaining\r\ndifferent standards for the participation of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in each intergovernmental\r\nbody, a single system would be simpler and more\r\nefficient. If the General Assembly were to assume\r\nresponsibility for conducting that process, then the\r\nGeneral Committee would be the appropriate body to\r\nexercise the necessary functions.\r\nThirdly, we note the recommendations for\r\nstrengthening links between the United Nations and\r\nnational parliaments, but, like the European Union, are\r\nnot convinced that the methods proposed are the most\r\nappropriate for engaging with parliaments. A\r\nmechanism already exists in the form of the\r\nrelationship between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union, and we believe that it would be\r\nmore appropriate to work within existing arrangements\r\nwherever possible, rather than to establish new\r\nmechanisms and processes.\r\nFourthly, the enlargement of the Partnerships\r\nOffice appears to be a good institutional initiative to\r\nextend relations with non-governmental organizations\r\nand we look forward to considering the details of the\r\nproposal in the 2006-2007 budget.\r\nStrengthening the United Nations is, of course, a\r\nprocess that has many aspects, and it is worth recalling\r\nhere the importance of continuing progress towards\r\nmaking the Secretariat more effective, efficient and\r\nresults-oriented.\r\nThe modest refinements to the budget process\r\nagreed last year were much less than Canada, New\r\nZealand and Australia thought were necessary, but we\r\nare pleased to see that they have helped the Secretariat\r\nto prepare a more focused work plan for 2006-2007\r\nand that some duplication has been eliminated.\r\nHowever, I have to say that we were disappointed —\r\nfrankly, surprised — that the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination failed to reform itself\r\nand remains of negligible value. We need to keep\r\nworking on that.\r\nResults-based budgeting — an innovation from\r\nthe Secretary-General’s first round of reforms —\r\ncontinues to progress and is producing a greater focus\r\non results and performance. Two steps are needed to\r\ntake this further. First, a system of cost accounting will\r\nallow the Organization to tie results to resources and to\r\ndetermine how limited resources will be best utilized.\r\nSecondly, improved evaluation and performance\r\nreporting need to provide a stronger framework for\r\naccountability, improving results and better planning.\r\nFinally, continued reform of human resources\r\npolicies and practices is vital for strengthening the\r\nOrganization and we must continue to consolidate and\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nextend the reforms introduced a few years ago. The\r\nwork of the International Civil Service Commission on\r\nreviewing pay and conditions, strengthening\r\nperformance and improving the management\r\ncapabilities of managers is critical to the task of\r\nensuring that the Organization can meet the challenges\r\nfacing it.\r\nIn that regard, we welcome the report of the panel\r\non the strengthening of the international civil service\r\nand look forward to building on its recommendations\r\nto improve the contribution of the International Civil\r\nService Commission to the United Nations system.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)\r\nWorking Group on Reform of the United Nations and\r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly. I shall limit\r\nmy intervention to the question of the revitalization of\r\nthe work of the General Assembly.\r\nNAM would like to express once again its\r\nappreciation for the leadership and commitment shown\r\nby the former President of the General Assembly,\r\nMr. Julian Hunte, concerning the issue of the\r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly.\r\nIndeed, resolutions 58/126 and 58/316 — adopted by\r\nthe General Assembly on 19 December 2003 and\r\n1 July 2004 respectively — represent important steps\r\nfor more substantive improvements towards a genuine\r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly.\r\nNAM is confident, Sir, that, under your\r\npresidency and with your wise guidance, Member\r\nStates will continue their efforts to advance the process\r\nof the revitalization of the work of the General\r\nAssembly. NAM would like to recall that that ongoing\r\nprocess is aimed at enhancing the authority and role of\r\nthe Assembly and at improving its efficiency and\r\neffectiveness so as to make it the central body of the\r\nOrganization, in accordance with the relevant\r\nprovisions of the Charter and paragraph 30 of the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nNAM looks forward to the follow-up to the\r\nprovisions of resolutions 58/126 and 58/316. In that\r\ncontext, NAM stresses the need to ensure the effective,\r\nfull and proper implementation of those resolutions.\r\nNAM stresses that the revitalization of the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is a process, driven by Member\r\nStates, that entails transparency and a clear distinction\r\nbetween the role of Member States and that of the\r\nSecretariat. The consultations on the revitalization of\r\nthe work of the Assembly should be conducted in an\r\ninclusive manner, taking into account the views of the\r\nfull membership, including those of the regional and\r\nnegotiating groups.\r\nNAM is of the view that the focus of our work\r\nduring the fifty-ninth session should be on continuing\r\nthe revitalization process within the framework of\r\nresolution 58/316. In that connection, NAM would like\r\nto highlight the following points.\r\nFirst, with regard to reordering the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, NAM stresses the need to take into\r\naccount the views expressed and the suggestions made\r\nby Member States in the context of the deliberations\r\nheld during the fifty-eighth session.\r\nSecondly, regarding the organization of the\r\nagenda of the Assembly under headings corresponding\r\nto the priorities of the medium-term plan or the\r\nstrategic framework, NAM would like to reiterate its\r\nposition that that arrangement — which is to be\r\nreviewed in its entirety by the Assembly at its sixty-\r\nfirst session — is solely for the purpose of illustration\r\nand will neither prejudge nor adversely affect the way\r\nin which the work of the Assembly is organized and\r\ncarried out, particularly regarding the format of\r\nsessions, the way in which agenda items are considered\r\nin plenary and other meetings and the way in which\r\ndraft resolutions are introduced and action is taken on\r\nthem.\r\nThirdly, concerning the practices and working\r\nmethods of the Main Committees, NAM emphasizes\r\nthat all of the Main Committees must be bound by the\r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, as stated\r\nin section C, paragraph 3, of the annex to resolution\r\n58/316, and that all Member States must be actively\r\ninvolved in the process of implementing the various\r\nprovisions of that section, including paragraph 3 (a),\r\nwhich states that each Main Committee shall make\r\nrecommendations on the rationalization of its future\r\nagendas to the plenary Assembly for its decision by\r\n1 April 2005.\r\nFinally, with respect to documentation, NAM is\r\nof the view that the forthcoming discussions on that\r\nissue should be conducted in the light of the\r\nimplementation of paragraph 7 of resolution 58/126\r\nand paragraph 20 of resolution 57/300 and in\r\naccordance with the principle of providing adequate\r\nand sufficient information, as agreed by Member\r\nStates.\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nNAM trusts, Sir, that under your presidency, the\r\nGeneral Assembly will continue its efforts to ensure\r\nfull implementation of the provisions of resolutions\r\n58/126 and 58/316 — including those related to the\r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council, contained in section A of the annex\r\nto resolution 58/126 — thus enabling the Assembly to\r\nplay its role effectively as “the chief deliberative,\r\npolicy-making and representative body of the United\r\nNations”, as stated in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nBearing in mind that the revitalization of the\r\nwork of the General Assembly is an ongoing process\r\nthat has as its main objective restoring the authority of\r\nthe Assembly, NAM stresses the importance of\r\nparagraph 1 of the annex to resolution 55/285, which\r\nstipulates that:\r\n“Improvement of the procedures and working\r\nmethods of the Assembly is only a first step\r\ntowards more substantive improvements in and\r\nrevitalization of the Assembly.”\r\nNAM believes that, from a methodological point of\r\nview, it would be more appropriate to focus during the\r\ncurrent session on the implementation of resolutions\r\n58/126 and 58/316 and to address, as a matter of\r\npriority, all outstanding issues.\r\nAt its sixtieth session, the General Assembly will\r\nreview the whole issue in the context of its\r\nconsideration of the comprehensive report requested\r\nfrom the Secretary-General in paragraph 3 of\r\nresolution 58/316. Such a review will provide Member\r\nStates with an opportunity to take stock of what has\r\nbeen achieved and to consider further steps and new\r\nmeasures that they deem necessary to advance the\r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly.\r\nIn closing, NAM would like to assure you,\r\nMr. President, of its full support for your undertaking\r\nconcerning the issue of the revitalization of the work of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Sardenberg (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nhave the honour to speak on behalf of the Rio Group:\r\nArgentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the\r\nDominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador,\r\nGuatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua,\r\nPanama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela and my\r\nown country, Brazil. For the Group, the issue of the\r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly is a\r\npriority, as agreed by the Presidents of our member\r\ncountries at their summit held in Cuzco, Peru. In the\r\nlight of that mandate, the Rio Group actively\r\nparticipated in the negotiating process leading to the\r\nadoption of resolutions 58/126 and 58/316.\r\nPermit me, Sir, to express the Group’s\r\nappreciation for the efforts of your predecessor,\r\nMr. Julian Hunte, who, through his tenacity and\r\ndedication, gave fresh impetus to the process of the\r\nrevitalization of the work of the Assembly and made an\r\nessential contribution to the success achieved. Thanks\r\nto his steadfast commitment to that cause, it was\r\npossible, among other things, to continue the effort of\r\nbiennializing and triennializing the consideration of\r\nAssembly agenda items, to bring forward the election\r\nof the Bureaux of the Main Committees and to have an\r\nagenda organized according to the priorities in the\r\nmedium-term plan. We are confident that, under your\r\npresidency, we shall be able to make yet more progress\r\nin that process, which is an essential part of the overall\r\nUnited Nations reform effort. The General Assembly\r\nmust recover the ground it has lost.\r\nDespite our best efforts during the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, it was not possible to\r\nreach agreement on one of the main proposals under\r\nconsideration, namely, the better use by the Main\r\nCommittees of all the time available throughout the\r\nAssembly session. Given the restrictions on\r\nreconvening the Main Committee sessions and the\r\nresistance to having some of the Main Committees\r\nhold their sessions in the spring instead of in the fall,\r\namong other issues, it proved impossible to reach a\r\nconsensus. Nonetheless, resolution 58/316 kept the\r\nissue on the Assembly’s agenda and, as in the past, the\r\nRio Group will continue actively to strive for results\r\nthat allow for a more effective allocation of available\r\ntime for the holding of the meetings of the Main\r\nCommittees.\r\nParagraph 5 in part B of the annex to resolution\r\n58/126 states,\r\n“It would be advantageous for the General\r\nAssembly to have a shorter agenda to ensure the\r\nfullest discussion of all issues, so that its\r\ndecisions may have greater impact.”\r\nOne option that could be considered in greater\r\ndepth is the idea of differentiating the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in general from its programme of\r\nwork for each specific session, thus avoiding the need\r\nto eliminate items from the agenda. Further efforts are\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nalso needed to ensure that the resolutions adopted by\r\nthe Assembly are more concise, to the point and\r\naction-oriented, in keeping with that resolution.\r\nThe General Assembly now has to deal with some\r\ndelicate questions about which it was not possible to\r\nreach agreement during the fifty-eighth session. The\r\nresults achieved so far, however, indicate that,\r\nregardless of the obstacles, it is possible to make\r\nchanges that have a direct bearing on the work of our\r\nAssembly. As previous experience clearly indicates,\r\nresolute and dedicated guidance from the President is\r\ncrucial if tangible results are to be achieved in the\r\nrevitalization process. In this regard, we are very\r\npleased by your statements, Mr. President.\r\nWith regard to the strengthening of the United\r\nNations system, we have before us reports prepared by\r\nthe Panel of Eminent Persons on United Nations-Civil\r\nSociety Relations, chaired by Fernando Henrique\r\nCardoso, former President of Brazil, as well as the\r\nreport that the Secretary-General has prepared in\r\nresponse to it. We stand ready to consider the proposals\r\ncontained in both of those documents throughout the\r\nsession.\r\nAmong the proposals presented, we are pleased to\r\nnote the Secretary-General’s decision to create a fund,\r\nto which voluntary contributions could be made, to\r\nhelp representatives of non-governmental organizations\r\nfrom developing countries to attend intergovernmental\r\nmeetings. The Rio Group will take part in the\r\ndiscussions on that issue, always bearing in mind the\r\ngoal of promoting this integration in a manner that\r\nhelps to strengthen the work of the Organization and\r\nother intergovernmental bodies.\r\nYou may rest assured, Mr. President, of the\r\nunswerving support of the members of the Rio Group\r\nin your efforts to promote the common cause of the\r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Rahman (Bangladesh): The issue of the\r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly and\r\nthe strengthening of the United Nations system has\r\nbeen under discussion at the United Nations for several\r\nyears. Some progress has been made but, obviously,\r\nmuch more needs to be done.\r\nCertain broad-based perceptions circumscribe any\r\nconsideration of the reform of the United Nations,\r\nwhether the revitalization of the work of the General\r\nAssembly or the strengthening of the Security Council.\r\nOne extreme view is that the work of the United\r\nNations has been essentially reduced to three elements:\r\npeacekeeping, the coordination of humanitarian\r\nassistance and easing the passage of globalization.\r\nAnother view is that the United Nations today has\r\nlatent strengths that have indeed made it indispensable,\r\nnot the least of which are its universality of\r\nmembership and its extraordinary position as the\r\ncentral — indeed, the only — body for the cooperative\r\nmanagement of the world’s problems.\r\nAnother set of perceptions relates to the practical\r\nrealization of what is achievable — that is, realpolitik.\r\nThis revolves around the question of embarking on a\r\nprocess of radical change involving the amending of\r\nthe Charter or simply maintaining the basic status quo\r\nthrough the so-called tinkering process to address\r\nissues of budget reform, streamlining the\r\nadministration, et cetera.\r\nIt would appear that realpolitik has a hugely\r\nconstraining hand. Be that as it may, Bangladesh\r\nbelieves that the issue of the revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the strengthening of the United\r\nNations system cannot be set aside. It is vital that we\r\nforge ahead simultaneously in a number of areas. We\r\ncan accomplish this through a concerted effort on the\r\npart of Member States. Agreeing to discuss item 52 and\r\nitem 54 together is an important step in the right\r\ndirection. We could explore similar opportunities in the\r\nwork of the Main Committees through biennialization,\r\ntriennialization, clustering and the elimination of\r\nagenda items. That would allow for more focused and\r\nin-depth discussions on issues of relevance, resulting in\r\nactionable outcomes.\r\nWe believe that the practice of holding a\r\n“question time” should also be introduced, in the most\r\nappropriate manner, in all of the Main Committees.\r\nThat would enable a dynamic and candid exchange\r\namong representatives, United Nations staff, the\r\nrepresentatives of the Secretary-General and special\r\nrapporteurs.\r\nA key element is to improve the efficiency of the\r\ndelivery system, particularly at the national level.\r\nAppropriate steps should be taken to better manage the\r\nhuman resources of the United Nations, its budgetary\r\nprocess, procurement procedure and monitoring and\r\nevaluation system.\r\nWe fully agree with the view that much of the\r\ncurrent malaise in our system is due to an\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\novercrowded, repetitive and irrelevant agenda, a huge\r\nburden of documentation and the need for meaningful\r\nthematic focus on specific issues.\r\nWe believe that rationalization should be a\r\ncontinuous process, enabling the Member States to\r\nrefocus themselves to respond adequately to changing\r\nrealities. We are confident that the ongoing process\r\nwill render the Assembly the central and supreme\r\ndeliberative and policy-making body of the United\r\nNations.\r\nBangladesh has been consistently endeavouring\r\nto contribute to this process in its modest way. As\r\nChairman of the Second Committee for the fifty-eighth\r\nsession, Bangladesh, along with the Bureau members,\r\nhelped prepare recommendations for ensuring a more\r\npractical and coherent organization of work for future\r\nsessions of the Committee, allowing for better focus,\r\nvisibility and participation. Many of those suggestions\r\nare reflected in section C of Assembly resolution\r\n58/316.\r\nWe believe that in order to strengthen the United\r\nNations system, the General Assembly should be made\r\nthe focal point of our activities. Both the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Millennium Declaration refer\r\nto the central position of the Assembly.\r\nAt its fifty-eighth session the Assembly adopted a\r\nresolution inviting the Security Council to submit\r\nspecial, subject-oriented reports to the Assembly on\r\nissues of international concern. It asked the President\r\nof the Security Council to regularly brief the President\r\nof the General Assembly on the work of the Council\r\nand requested the Presidents of the General Assembly,\r\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil to meet periodically with a view to ensuring\r\nincreased cooperation, coordination and\r\ncomplementarity of the work programmes of the three\r\norgans. We urge the President of the General Assembly\r\nto put those recommendations into practice. We also\r\ncall for further strengthening of the office of the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, including the\r\nincrease and the better management of its budget.\r\nThe United Nations has seen a dramatic evolution\r\nover more than five decades. Two forces have been\r\npre-eminent. The first is mass awareness of individual\r\nrights, which is behind the progressive development of\r\nhumanitarian laws and the strengthening of human\r\nrights. Secondly, advances in science and technology\r\nhave brought the liberalization of market forces,\r\nmobility of labour, capital and business and the greater\r\nindependence of all countries. The result has been\r\nglobalization. Those forces have heralded new players\r\nin the international community: civil society, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, transnational corporations\r\nand big cities. In short, this is the age of the non-State\r\nactors. There is a vital need to praise and assess their\r\nrole.\r\nFor the United Nations to engage in debates on\r\ndevelopment issues in a more substantive way, we\r\nbelieve it must nurture a healthy relationship with civil\r\nsociety. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs)\r\ntoday have a huge worldwide network. They are\r\nworking with Governments at most levels of\r\ndevelopment, including planning and execution. The\r\nUnited Nations can certainly benefit by drawing upon\r\nthe experiences of the NGOs.\r\nWe agree with the recommendation of the Panel\r\nof Eminent Persons on United Nations-Civil Society\r\nRelations (A/59/354) that the United Nations, in\r\nessence, should endeavour to make itself a more\r\noutward-looking organization. That can be done by\r\nencouraging the participation of various stakeholders\r\nin the development programmes in different ways. We\r\nbelieve that the role of the NGOs in the activities of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Main Committees and the\r\nSecurity Council, however, should remain limited to a\r\nconsultative role.\r\nOn the issue of reform of the Security Council,\r\nBangladesh favours increasing the membership of the\r\nCouncil with a view to its democratization and in\r\nkeeping with the increase in the United Nations\r\nmembership. A simple rule of thumb is 10 per cent of\r\nUnited Nations membership. We believe that reform of\r\nthe Council should be considered as a common\r\npackage encompassing both the composition of its\r\nmembership and its working methods. Our basic stand\r\nis to oppose the creation of new centres of privilege\r\nand to constrain the use of the veto, while recognizing\r\nthe limitations in that direction. That view emanates\r\nfrom the realization that the fundamental goal of the\r\nreform exercise should be to enhance the legitimacy,\r\ncredibility, accountability, efficiency and effectiveness\r\nof the Council.\r\nEfforts at reform, particularly the expansion of\r\nthe Council, should not be bound by any imposed\r\ndeadline. We believe that any such expansion should be\r\naddressed on the basis of well-defined criteria, the\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nforemost of which should be the track record and\r\nperformance of the aspirant. That would be judged by\r\nthe concerned country’s commitment to the United\r\nNations and its contribution to international peace and\r\nsecurity, not merely by the benchmarks of national\r\nwealth and military power. That should ultimately\r\ntranslate into Member States taking greater\r\nresponsibility in terms of financial resources and\r\npolitical support for efforts undertaken by the United\r\nNations in the areas of peace, security and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nCertain aspects, including a country’s record in\r\ndemocracy and compliance with the United Nations\r\nresolutions, as well as its avowed commitment to\r\ndisarmament, should also be taken into consideration.\r\nAny reform of the Council should adequately\r\nreflect the interests of the smaller developing\r\ncountries, which constitute a strong numerical block in\r\nthe United Nations and therefore have a vital stake in\r\nan effective Council. In that regard, the case for the\r\ndemocratization of the Council should not be confined\r\nto the principle of regional representation alone. It\r\nshould also include the principle of the rotational\r\nrepresentation of various economic groupings in an\r\nexpanded Security Council.\r\nArguably, the whole issue of reform of the\r\nSecurity Council involves many complexities that\r\ncannot be resolved in a piecemeal fashion. The\r\nultimate aim of any reform exercise should be to\r\nenhance the credibility and the democratic nature of\r\nthe United Nations through its working methods, its\r\ndecision-making process and the very substance of its\r\ndeliberations. It should not result merely in the creation\r\nof new centres of privilege.\r\nMrs. Musiviye (Namibia): Last Friday, the\r\nGeneral Assembly concluded a rich general debate that\r\nwas addressed by an impressive number of heads of\r\nState or Government. All collectively reaffirmed the\r\nprecious ideals, purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations and the need for United Nations reform to\r\nreassert the centrality of the United Nations in dealing\r\nwith global problems.\r\nIt is therefore most appropriate that the present\r\njoint debate should start our plenary deliberations.\r\nHaving had the rare privilege of presiding over the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session, Namibia\r\nattaches great importance to this discussion. The\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations system are\r\ncomplementarity and intertwined. A revitalized\r\nGeneral Assembly will make the United Nations\r\nsystem effective. At the same time, a strengthened\r\nUnited Nations system will enhance the centrality of\r\nthis important organ.\r\nI wish to join others in commending the President\r\nof the General Assembly at is fifty-eighth session for\r\nhis devotion to the issue of the revitalization of the\r\nAssembly. His commitment has taken this important\r\nissue to a higher level. It is now our duty to sustain the\r\nmomentum and to bring the process to a meaningful\r\nconclusion.\r\nWe trust in your ability, Mr. President, to take the\r\nprocess forward, and you have our cooperation and\r\nsupport in this regard.\r\nThe representative of Algeria, speaking on behalf\r\nof the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\n(NAM), clearly laid out the NAM position. My\r\ndelegation associates itself with the position he just\r\nenunciated. Allow me, however, to make a few remarks\r\non some aspects of the revitalization process.\r\nStreamlining the General Assembly agenda has been an\r\nongoing process. In fact, some of the Main Committees\r\nhave set the pace on the issue. In that context, a\r\nfocused discussion among Member States will further\r\nenhance our work on this subject. In the meantime, the\r\nprovisions of General Assembly resolution 58/316 are\r\nvery clear and give us room to observe the practicality\r\nand suitability of rearranging the agenda of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe believe that what has worked well for the\r\noverwhelming majority of Member States as we\r\ncontinue with the process of revitalization should\r\ncontinue to work just as well. For example, the\r\nusefulness and necessity of having a general debate in\r\neach of the Main Committees should be viewed in the\r\ncontext of each Main Committee’s work. Over the\r\nyears, smaller delegations such as mine have strongly\r\nargued for the retention of this debate. Our arguments\r\nhave been rightly centred on our limited capacities.\r\nHowever, there is another equally important aspect that\r\nwe collectively tend to overlook. And since we are\r\ndeliberating on how to revitalize the work of the\r\nAssembly, it is worth pointing out that general debates\r\nin the Main Committees are essential for the following\r\nreasons. First, they add content to the deliberations;\r\nsecondly, they provide focus for the work of the\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nsession; and thirdly, they set the overall tone for the\r\nCommittee’s work. The debates on substantive items,\r\non the other hand, narrow it down, thus assisting in the\r\npreparation of draft resolutions.\r\nWe cannot adopt a uniform method for all the\r\nCommittees. Therein lies the wisdom of leaving the\r\nmodalities of rationalizing the work of each Main\r\nCommittee to its own member States.\r\nWe welcome the remarks made by the Deputy\r\nSecretary-General in introducing the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on strengthening of the United\r\nNations system (A/59/354), and we wish to make the\r\nfollowing preliminary comments on some aspects of\r\nthe recommendations of the Panel of Eminent Persons\r\non United Nations-Civil Society Relations.\r\nThe contribution of non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs) to the work of the United\r\nNations is unquestionable. In our view, the\r\nparticipation of NGOs is not novel — at least, not for\r\nthe General Assembly. However, the participation of\r\nnon-governmental organizations has been unbalanced,\r\nin terms both of geographical representation and of\r\naccessibility to the United Nations system. Members\r\nwill agree with me that accreditation and participation\r\nof NGOs are two different issues.\r\nMy delegation does not concur with the Panel on\r\nthe merits of a single system of accreditation. Granted,\r\nwe need to continue to seek more effective ways of\r\ncarrying out our activities with the inclusion of all\r\nrelevant partners. However, in doing so, we must\r\nexamine in earnest whether the problem actually lies\r\nwith the committee or the NGO, or with the seeming\r\nerosion of the intergovernmental character of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe believe that, in considering the accountability\r\nof NGOs, the particularities of NGOs from developing\r\ncountries need to be taken into account. It has been\r\nsaid, and rightly so, that different United Nations\r\nbodies require different types of reform or\r\nstrengthening. At country level, for example, unique\r\nregulatory frameworks have to be taken into account.\r\nThe participation of NGOs in operational activities at\r\ncountry level cannot be made uniform. While broad\r\nguidelines could be common, surely the modalities of\r\noperation will have to take into account the realities in\r\ngiven countries.\r\nThere is no doubt that the capacities of NGOs,\r\nespecially those from developing countries, need to be\r\nenhanced to complement Government efforts in the\r\ndevelopment sphere. However, this must not detract\r\nfrom the fact that what is holding back the attainment\r\nof development goals is not a lack of effective\r\ncoordination between Governments and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations but the lack of resources.\r\nThe proposed trust fund is thus an idea worth\r\nconsidering. However, in view of the lack of resources\r\nfor development, would it not be more useful if the\r\ntrust fund could also complement the efforts of\r\ngovernment in achieving the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, for example? The operational word here is\r\n“complement”.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the contribution of NGOs\r\nto the work of our Organization is beyond doubt and is\r\nwell documented. But, while we welcome their\r\ncontinued participation, we must not compromise the\r\nintergovernmental nature of our Organization, which\r\nderives from the Charter.\r\nFinally, the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly is the means to an end. During the previous\r\nsession, the Non-Aligned Movement introduced a draft\r\nresolution, adopted as resolution 58/317, on\r\nreaffirming the central role of the United Nations in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and the\r\npromotion of international cooperation. While we seek\r\nto revitalize the work of the General Assembly, we\r\nneed to establish how to enhance the role of the\r\nAssembly in this regard. Improving the working\r\nmethods of the General Assembly will not in itself\r\nplace the Assembly at the centre. Perhaps the time is\r\nfast approaching for us to look at the authority of this\r\nmost deliberative and most representative organ of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): Sir, it is my pleasure\r\nto congratulate you on your election to the presidency\r\nof the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. It is\r\nparticularly gratifying to see a distinguished son of\r\nAfrica leading this body at such an important session. I\r\nwish to pledge the fullest cooperation of South Africa\r\nwith you in the year ahead.\r\nPlease allow me to thank and congratulate your\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte, for his\r\neffective leadership of the fifty-eighth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I wish to pay special tribute to\r\nForeign Minister Hunte for his efforts on one of the\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nitems before us today, namely, the revitalization of the\r\nwork of the General Assembly.\r\nI would also like to associate myself with the\r\nstatement made by Algeria on behalf of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement.\r\nMy delegation is fully committed to improving\r\nthe working methods and the effectiveness of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, both its Committees and the\r\nplenary. We believe that the purpose of the proposed\r\nreform is to enhance the effectiveness and the\r\nsubstance of the work of those bodies. For the past\r\ncouple of years our delegation has had the honour to\r\nassist in the facilitation of the revitalization process.\r\nDuring that period we have seen Member States take\r\ndecisions on a number of issues, which have already\r\nmade a significant improvement in the work of our\r\nOrganization. Already, there is a fixed date for the\r\nannual commencement of the general debate. The\r\nPresident of the General Assembly and the\r\nChairpersons and other officers of the Main\r\nCommittees are elected early so that they can prepare\r\nfor their tasks in good time. The General Committee\r\nhas also been engaged in discussing and deciding on\r\nthe revitalization process, giving the General\r\nCommittee a continuing role in the process of helping\r\nstrengthen the Assembly.\r\nAt its fifty-eighth session, the General Assembly\r\nadopted resolution 58/316, in which Member States\r\nwere able to reach consensus on further reforms\r\ndesigned to revitalize the work of this body. They\r\nincluded the decision to schedule plenary meetings on\r\nMondays and Thursdays, so as to make the work of the\r\nwhole General Assembly session predictable. That\r\ndecision has also made it possible for the Committees\r\nto better structure their schedules so as to avoid clashes\r\nwith plenary meetings. In addition, certain Committees\r\nhave begun implementing some of the proposals made\r\nin the resolution as a way of enhancing their work. In\r\ncoming weeks, we look forward to comparing the\r\nrevitalization experiences of different Committees as a\r\nway of distilling and replicating best practices,\r\nwherever possible.\r\nHowever, there is still more to be done if the\r\nGeneral Assembly is to live up to its description in the\r\nMillennium Declaration as “the chief deliberative,\r\npolicy-making and representative organ of the United\r\nNations” (resolution 55/2, para. 30).\r\nAmong the outstanding matters raised in\r\nresolution 58/316 is the issue of documentation, in\r\nparticular the volume of documentation. We believe\r\nthat documentation has a direct impact on the work of\r\nthe General Assembly and its Committees and my\r\ndelegation is ready to participate in discussions on that\r\nissue.\r\nRegarding the strengthening of the United\r\nNations, we wish to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport in response to the report of the Panel of Eminent\r\nPersons on United Nations-Civil Society Relations,\r\nwhich was chaired by the former President of Brazil,\r\nMr. Fernando Henrique Cardoso.\r\nSouth Africa places a very high premium on the\r\nrole and contribution that non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs) and other elements of civil\r\nsociety can play and have played in many aspects of\r\nsociety. For that reason, we believe that such\r\norganizations have an important role to play in\r\nanalysing, evaluating and shaping the world we live in\r\nat all levels. It is therefore important for the United\r\nNations to enhance its cooperation with that very\r\nimportant sector of society; we believe that the report\r\nof the Secretary-General contains a number of practical\r\nand useful suggestions that should be pursued further.\r\nWhile it may go without saying, we concur with\r\nthe Secretary-General’s re-emphasis of the\r\nintergovernmental nature of the United Nations, where\r\ndecisions are taken by its Member States. However,\r\nMember States should be able to draw on the best and\r\nmost up-to-date information on which to base their\r\ndiscussions and decisions; civil society can play an\r\nimportant contributing role in that regard. Civil society\r\nalso continues to highlight topics and to develop the\r\ndebate around important local, national and global\r\nissues. With that in mind, we agree that ways should be\r\nfound to maximize the contribution that civil society\r\ncan make to the work of all the bodies of the United\r\nNations, including the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nSpeaking from my experience as Chairman of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council Ad Hoc Advisory\r\nGroups on Guinea-Bissau and on Burundi, our\r\ninteraction with civil society in those countries made a\r\nsignificant contribution to the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil’s understanding of both the challenges faced\r\nby those countries and of the different approaches\r\navailable in dealing with countries emerging from\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nconflict. I was thus pleased that during its recent visit\r\nto West Africa, the Security Council mission also made\r\na particular point of interacting with civil society\r\norganizations in the countries that they visited, a fact\r\nmentioned in the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nWhile those country-level interactions are\r\nextremely helpful, it is admittedly not possible to have\r\nthe same level of contribution from developing-\r\ncountry civil society organizations in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations here in New York. We are therefore\r\nvery glad to see that the Secretary-General will create a\r\ntrust fund to provide financial support to enable\r\naccredited NGOs from developing countries to attend\r\nUnited Nations meetings. We hope that donors will\r\ncontribute generously to the trust fund, as that would\r\nbe a tangible way to demonstrate the importance that\r\nwe attach to the contribution of civil society.\r\nWe all have seen the significant contribution that\r\ncivil society organizations can make to the work of the\r\nUnited Nations during summits and other high-level\r\nmeetings. That was demonstrated very clearly again to\r\nus in Johannesburg, during the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, in which civil society\r\nparticipated fully both in the preparatory process and\r\nthe Summit itself. Since the Johannesburg Summit,\r\ncivil society has continued to contribute significantly\r\nto enriching the debate and to discussions on carrying\r\nout the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.\r\nThe Secretary-General has also highlighted the\r\nneed to find ways to review the accreditation of NGOs\r\nas a way to maximize their participation in the work of\r\nthe United Nations. My delegation believes that this is\r\nan important issue, and we look forward to exchanging\r\nideas with other delegations on this matter.\r\nIn conclusion, the fact that we are addressing the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations system together is\r\nan admission that a lot of work needs to be done. If we\r\nconsider the agreement reached in resolution 58/316,\r\nthere seems to be a consensus that we have not yet\r\nreached the end of the road of the revitalization\r\nprocess. And in addressing the strengthening of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, it is clear that that cannot happen\r\nthrough the efforts of Member States alone. We need to\r\nmaintain a balance between our enthusiasm to improve\r\nthe working methods of the Organization and\r\ndiscussions of the actual substantive matters that we\r\nhave to deal with in the Committees and in plenary\r\nmeetings. My delegation believes that that can only\r\nhappen as we continue to address these issues in the\r\ncoming months.\r\nMr. Aboul Atta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): First\r\nof all, I would like to associate myself with the\r\nstatement made by the representative of Algeria on\r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and to endorse\r\nthe report of the Panel of Eminent Persons on United\r\nNations-Civil Society Relations. We would also like,\r\nonce again, to express our satisfaction with the role\r\nplayed by the President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-eighth session in guiding the consultations that\r\nled to the adoption of General Assembly resolutions\r\n58/126 and 58/316. We also look forward to working\r\nwith you, Mr. President, during the present session on\r\nthese items.\r\nEgypt is convinced that the major objective of the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly is an important\r\none: to ensure that, in the relevant areas, the Assembly\r\nplays its role as a principal organ of the United\r\nNations. We must never lose sight of that objective.\r\nEgypt is firmly convinced that the revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly must not be short-circuited or\r\nlimited to a simple procedural rationalization of the\r\nAssembly’s deliberations. While we attach particular\r\nimportance to this matter, we also think that we should\r\nconsider the question of the General Assembly’s\r\nrelationships with the other United Nations organs and\r\ndevelop those relationships in an effort to achieve the\r\nmost effective formulas that would enhance the\r\nauthority, efficiency and role of the General Assembly.\r\nAt its sixtieth session, the General Assembly will\r\ndeal with the question of the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration and the comprehensive reform\r\nof the United Nations. That should provide a unique\r\nopportunity for us to advance in our collective\r\ninternational action to enhance the role of the General\r\nAssembly and strengthen multilateralism and\r\ndemocracy in international relations.\r\nWe in the Non-Aligned Movement therefore\r\nbelieve that, at the present session, we should consider\r\ncarefully the comprehensive implementation of\r\nresolutions 58/126 and 58/316 and the elements that\r\nhave already been implemented. We believe that this\r\nwork should be transparent and should fully include all\r\nthe regional and other negotiating groups, based on the\r\nprinciple that it is the Member States that are\r\nresponsible for reforming the United Nations and, in\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nparticular, for revitalizing the General Assembly. This\r\nmust take place on the basis of a painstaking definition\r\nof the roles of all those involved in the discussions. We\r\nwill support your efforts, Mr. President, and will\r\ncooperate with you as you exercise prudent leadership,\r\nin a spirit of partnership and collegiality, to ensure that\r\nwe succeed in this process.\r\nI turn now to the issue of strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations system and its relationship with the\r\ncivil society. We have examined the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/59/354) on this matter, and we\r\nlistened attentively to the presentation made today by\r\nthe Deputy Secretary-General. Here, I thank the Panel\r\nof Eminent Persons on United Nations-Civil Society\r\nRelations, chaired by former President Cardoso of\r\nBrazil. My thanks go also to the Secretary-General.\r\nEgypt has always sought to strengthen dialogue with\r\nnon-governmental organizations, not only because of\r\ntheir role in articulating society’s conscience, but\r\nbecause of the constructive role they play in promoting\r\nthe issues of civil society, to the benefit of all people.\r\nBased on the growing importance of this matter\r\nof strengthening the role of the United Nations and\r\nrevitalizing its organs, the delegation of Egypt has\r\nstudied the report very carefully with a view to its\r\nimplementation. We wish also to understand all the\r\nresponsibilities and repercussions stemming from the\r\nimplementation of the report’s proposals on\r\nstrengthening the United Nations system. We would\r\nlike to ascertain what the implications will be for our\r\nsocieties and to ensure that we act in a manner\r\ncompatible with the intergovernmental nature of the\r\nOrganization and its Charter.\r\nMr. Noghes (Monaco) (spoke in French): The\r\nPrincipality of Monaco welcomed the General\r\nAssembly’s adoption of resolution 58/316, which was\r\nan important first step towards revitalizing the work of\r\nthe General Assembly. We take this opportunity,\r\nMr. President, to welcome the work done in this area\r\nby your predecessor.\r\nThe delegation of Monaco supports the effort to\r\nreform the United Nations organ in which all Member\r\nStates may express their views. In the annex to\r\nresolution 58/126, the General Assembly reaffirmed\r\nthat the provisions of the United Nations Charter and\r\nthe Millennium Declaration lay at the heart of its\r\nconcerns.\r\nThe Monegasque delegation greatly appreciates,\r\nin this regard, the rearrangement of the agenda, which\r\nis now clustered around headings that correspond to\r\nthe Organization’s priorities. Rationalizing the agenda\r\nin keeping with the medium-term plan for 2002 to 2005\r\nor the strategic framework of the General Assembly\r\nwill give Member States the opportunity to focus their\r\nefforts on areas in which they are most competent.\r\nSmall delegations such as ours will in this way be able\r\nto make a more significant contribution to the work of\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nThe measures that we have adopted are\r\nnonetheless modest in scope. The General Committee’s\r\nrole needs to be strengthened as regards the\r\neffectiveness of the Organization and the coordination\r\nand management of its work. The representative nature\r\nof the General Committee gives Member States a\r\nguarantee that the Secretariat will take their views into\r\nconsideration.\r\nWe warmly welcome the practice of holding\r\ninteractive debates and group discussions within the\r\nMain Committees, as well as question-and-answer\r\nmeetings involving representatives of Member States,\r\ndepartment officials and special rapporteurs. Such\r\ninformal exchanges of views will promote both\r\ndynamism and transparency.\r\nThe sense of urgency that should push us to\r\nundertake the upcoming measures to revitalize the\r\nAssembly is as great as that which in September 2003\r\nprompted the Secretary-General to create the High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. The\r\nrecent and simultaneous upsurge in non-traditional\r\nthreats such as terrorism, organized crime and the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction on the\r\none hand and the insufficient or patchy progress in\r\nreducing poverty on the other hand make it necessary\r\nfor the United Nations to adapt rapidly to the new\r\nworld context. Like the eminent persons of the Panel,\r\nwe need to formulate bold proposals, setting out a\r\nconvincing agenda: a set of responses that can deal\r\nwith the world’s problems. It is up to us to give the\r\nGeneral Assembly the authority it deserves and to\r\nstrengthen the role that falls to it, that of representing\r\nthe international community and, fundamentally, the\r\npeoples of the world.\r\nIn that regard, we have taken note of the\r\nrecommendations made by the Panel of Eminent\r\nPersons on United Nations-Civil Society Relations,\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nbecause, as its Chairman, President Cardoso, has noted,\r\nthe growth in civil society’s influence is one of the\r\nmajor events of our time. We share the view that the\r\nUnited Nations should welcome the contributions of\r\nrelevant non-governmental organizations in the context\r\nof their deliberations. We continue to believe that we\r\nshould be able to avoid repetitive debates and certain\r\nrepetitive resolutions and to devote ourselves to\r\nimplementing and honouring the commitments that we\r\nhave already undertaken.\r\nMr. President, we are convinced that you will be\r\nable to conduct our work successfully and that we will\r\nthus make substantive progress before the end of the\r\nsession.\r\nMr. Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry (Pakistan): I wish\r\nto begin, Sir, by extending to you our congratulations\r\non your assumption of the office of President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and by assuring you of our fullest\r\ncooperation during your term of office. We would also\r\nlike to thank the Deputy Secretary-General for\r\npresenting the report of the Secretary General\r\n(A/59/354) this morning.\r\nPakistan fully supports the efforts to revitalize the\r\nGeneral Assembly in order to strengthen its role as the\r\nchief deliberative organ of the United Nations.\r\nHowever, our efforts will not yield the desired result\r\nunless we focus on both enhancing the Assembly’s\r\nefficiency and restoring its rightful authority.\r\nIn that regard, last year Pakistan’s delegation\r\npresented a set of ideas for the revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. One idea, which continues to\r\nremain valid, bears repetition: enhancing the\r\nAssembly’s role is a political, not a procedural\r\nexercise. All Member States would need to\r\ndemonstrate their resolve and political commitment to\r\nensuring that the Assembly becomes the primary locus\r\nof the discussions and actions of the United Nations.\r\nThe Member States will also need to commit\r\nthemselves to observing and implementing the\r\nAssembly’s resolutions.\r\nPakistan aligns itself with the statement of\r\nAlgeria made on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\ncountries on agenda item 52. We endorse the call for\r\nthe provisions contained in resolutions 58/126 and\r\n58/316 to be fully implemented. We believe that\r\nconsensual decision-making should be the guiding\r\nprinciple in making progress on the important issues\r\nunder consideration, including reflection of the\r\npriorities of the Organization in the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the reordering of the Assembly’s\r\nwork, and the working methods of the Main\r\nCommittees.\r\nWe would like to draw the Assembly’s attention\r\nto an important provision of resolution 58/126, which\r\ncalls for greater interaction between the Presidents of\r\nthe three principal organs of the United Nations. We\r\nbelieve that greater coordination and coherence in the\r\nwork of those three organs will bring synergy to our\r\nwork and add to the central role of the General\r\nAssembly, as envisaged in the Charter and reflected in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration.\r\nIn that context, we welcome the regular meetings\r\nof the Presidents of the three organs instituted by the\r\nformer President of the General Assembly, Mr. Julian\r\nHunte, to discuss issues common to the agenda of the\r\nthree organs. We would like to take this opportunity to\r\nrecall Pakistan’s proposal of establishing ad hoc\r\ncomposite committees with membership drawn from\r\nthe three main organs in order to address complex\r\nemergencies. That idea has already been discussed at\r\nthe meeting of the three Presidents. We hope that the\r\nproposal will be further reflected upon in the context of\r\nbringing about greater vitality and synergy in the work\r\nof the three principal organs of the United Nations.\r\nIn the context of discussions on agenda item 54,\r\nwe would like to state that Pakistan attaches high\r\nimportance to strengthening the United Nations\r\nsystem. In that regard, Pakistan has welcomed the\r\nestablishment of the High-Level Panel to examine the\r\nmajor threats and challenges to international peace and\r\nsecurity and to make recommendations for a collective\r\nresponse. We believe that the strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations system should be based on cooperative\r\nmultilateralism pursued mainly through the United\r\nNations and based on United Nations Charter\r\nprinciples. United Nations reform should not come at\r\nthe cost of United Nations principles.\r\nWe shall offer our specific views on different\r\naspects of United Nations reform under the relevant\r\nagenda items. At today’s meeting, we would simply\r\nlike to say that cooperative multilateralism and a\r\nstrengthened United Nations can be realized only if the\r\nGeneral Assembly is enabled to play its role as the\r\nsupreme organ of the Organization, to which the\r\nmembership of the more restricted organs, the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council, is\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nanswerable and accountable. Furthermore, the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations system cannot\r\nyield the desired results so long as the United Nations\r\nand its family of organizations continue to be denied\r\nadequate financial resources to perform the myriad and\r\ngrowing tasks with which those organizations are now\r\nbeing entrusted.\r\nWe would now like to offer a few comments on\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on United Nations-\r\ncivil society relations. Pakistan regards civil society as\r\nan integral part of the political, social and economic\r\nfibre of contemporary societies. The wider\r\nparticipation of the non-governmental organizations\r\n(NGOs) is now vital to ensuring the success of\r\ninternational cooperation, especially in the field of\r\nsocio-economic uplift and the advocacy of the rights of\r\nthe vulnerable segments of societies.\r\nThe evolution of civil society in the past decades\r\nand its increased participation in United Nations\r\nactivities warrants a fresh look at the institutional\r\nstructure if that interaction is to afford a meaningful\r\npartnership between the two. It is in that context that,\r\ntwo years ago, the Pakistan delegation extended its full\r\nsupport to the proposal of the Secretary-General,\r\ncontained in his report in document A/57/387, to\r\nstrengthen the interaction between the United Nations\r\nand civil society.\r\nWe have taken note of the proposals made by the\r\nSecretary-General in response to the report of the Panel\r\nof Eminent Persons on United Nations-Civil Society\r\nRelations. The report contains a number of useful ideas\r\nand suggestions. However, we believe that the changes\r\nthat we may institute need our careful consideration,\r\nparticularly their financial, legal and procedural\r\nimplications. While we would pursue the matter in\r\ngreater detail during informal discussions, at this stage\r\nwe would like to offer a few general observations.\r\nFirst, there is a need to clearly define the rights\r\nand responsibilities of non-governmental organizations\r\nfor their participation in the General Assembly, bearing\r\nin mind the need to preserve the Assembly’s\r\nintergovernmental nature. Secondly, the process of\r\naccreditation must continue to be regulated through\r\nintergovernmental consideration and decisions. We\r\nagree that there is a need to streamline the\r\naccreditation process. In that regard, we would need to\r\nevaluate whether the shifting of the responsibility for\r\nthe accreditation of non-governmental organizations\r\nfrom the Committee on Non-Governmental\r\nOrganizations to the General Committee would achieve\r\nthe desired efficiency. Thirdly, due respect has to be\r\nshown for the local laws, values and cultural ethos of\r\nthe country concerned when strengthening role of civil\r\nsociety in United Nations-sponsored activities in that\r\nparticularly country. Equally important is the need to\r\nensure that programmes to enhance the capacity of\r\nNGOs at the country level are undertaken with the\r\nconcurrence and full involvement of the host\r\nauthorities. Fourthly, initiatives for the increased\r\ninvolvement of NGOs need to be accompanied by the\r\ngeneration of additional funds, rather than by a mere\r\nreappropriation of the existing development funds.\r\nIn conclusion, Pakistan supports the\r\nstrengthening of the relationship between the United\r\nNations and civil society. However, we believe that the\r\nexercise should not in any manner erode the\r\nAssembly’s intergovernmental nature or challenge the\r\nprimacy of the Member States at the United Nations.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nAt the outset, allow me to thank you, Sir, for\r\nconvening today’s meeting.\r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly is an\r\nimportant part of the reform of the United Nations. The\r\nChinese delegation has always supported the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly with a view to\r\nexpanding the influence of the Organization and to\r\npromoting multilateralism.\r\nAt its last session, the General Assembly\r\nunanimously adopted two important resolutions on its\r\nown revitalization that fully reflected the common\r\nunderstanding of all parties. We expect that, under your\r\nleadership, Sir, the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly will remain a major priority at this session,\r\nthe healthy momentum will be maintained and further\r\nresults achieved. The Chinese delegation is prepared to\r\njoin with every member of the General Assembly in\r\ngiving its full support to your work.\r\nWe are of the view that there already exists a very\r\ngood foundation framework for the revitalization of the\r\nwork of the General Assembly. The first priority now is\r\nto implement resolutions 58/126 and 58/316. In that\r\nregard, I would stress the following three points.\r\nFirst, with respect to strengthening the authority\r\nand role of the General Assembly, the annex of\r\nresolution 58/126 invites the Security Council to\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nsubmit periodically special subject-oriented reports to\r\nthe General Assembly on issues of current international\r\nconcern and to continue with initiatives to improve the\r\nquality of its annual report to the General Assembly.\r\nAs one of the permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil, China will work actively in the Council to\r\naccomplish those two tasks.\r\nSecondly, with respect to improving the agendas\r\nand documentation of the General Assembly and the\r\nMain Committees, in compliance with resolution\r\n58/316, the Secretary-General promptly submitted a\r\nGeneral Assembly agenda in document A/58/864,\r\nclustering items according to the medium-term plan.\r\nWe express our appreciation in that regard. We expect\r\nthe Main Committees to make their recommendations\r\nto the Assembly on the rationalization of their agendas\r\nbefore 1 April 2005. We also expect the Secretariat to\r\nsubmit an updated note on control and limitation of\r\ndocumentation to the General Committee for its\r\nconsideration so that it can make its recommendations\r\nto the Assembly at an early date.\r\nThirdly, in accordance with resolution 58/316, the\r\nGeneral Committee should continue to consider the\r\nquestion of improving its working methods and make\r\nrecommendations on the matter to the Assembly before\r\n1 April 2005. We hope that the General Committee will\r\npromptly study this issue and come up with ideas on\r\nhow to improve its working methods, including ways\r\nand means to further rationalize the procedure for\r\nconsidering the agenda of the Assembly so as to\r\nimprove the Assembly’s efficiency and effectiveness.\r\nNext year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations. The General Assembly will convene a\r\nsummit meeting to commemorate the event and make a\r\nnumber of decisions on important questions. The\r\nsummit’s success depends on careful prior\r\npreparations. The current Assembly session faces an\r\nenormous task in that regard. In order to revitalize the\r\nAssembly, while no effort should be spared to\r\nimplement resolutions 58/126 and 58/316, we should\r\nalso give comprehensive consideration to other\r\nrelevant issues related to the reform of the United\r\nNations in order to promote the revitalization of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe Chinese delegation has also taken note of the\r\nreport by the Secretary-General concerning the\r\nexpanded participation of civil society in the United\r\nNations (A/59/354). We thank the Panel of Eminent\r\nPersons on United Nations-Civil Society Relations,\r\nunder the leadership of Mr. Cardoso, for its efforts. We\r\nsupport the consideration of the expanded participation\r\nof civil society, including non-governmental\r\norganizations, in the United Nations. We will join\r\nothers in taking a positive and open approach for the\r\nin-depth study of this question.\r\nThe Chinese delegation believes that the\r\nexpanded participation of civil society is necessary for\r\nthe United Nations to meet the requirements of our\r\nage, and the issue should be given thorough\r\nconsideration in relation to the reform of the United\r\nNations. Reflection on the expanded participation of\r\ncivil society should fully consider the useful practices\r\nand experience of the non-governmental organizations\r\nthat have participated in the work of the United\r\nNations over the last 60 years. The views of relevant\r\nparties, including non-governmental organizations,\r\nshould be solicited on relevant reform measures, which\r\nshould be implemented progressively.\r\nMr. Haraguchi (Japan): Today, the General\r\nAssembly is to discuss the critical issues of our time:\r\nthe strengthening of the United Nations system and the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. I take it that\r\nplacing these issues immediately following the close of\r\nthe general debate indicates the importance that you,\r\nMr. President, attach to the reform of the United\r\nNations. I would like to pay tribute to your initiative in\r\nthat regard.\r\nWith its universal membership and broad\r\nmandate, the United Nations plays an important and\r\nunique role that no other international organization can\r\nfulfil. However, in the face of the new threats and\r\nchallenges emerging in the international community\r\ntoday, the United Nations system must be reformed and\r\nstrengthened in order to maintain its relevance and\r\neffectiveness. As Prime Minister Koizumi of Japan\r\nsaid in his statement in the general debate on\r\n21 September, we need a strong and effective United\r\nNations; we must, in effect, create a new United\r\nNations for the new era.\r\nIn that connection, the work of the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change is under way.\r\nIts report, expected to be completed this December,\r\nwill be the product of the collective wisdom of the\r\nhighly esteemed members of the Panel. We are looking\r\nforward to the Panel’s insightful analysis of, and\r\ninnovative suggestions for solutions to, the threats and\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nthe challenges we are now facing. Nevertheless, it is\r\nthe Member States that have the final responsibility to\r\nmake political decisions on the ways and means to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations system. Therefore, it is\r\nimperative that we, the Member States, start seriously\r\nto consider how best to improve the existing United\r\nNations system and better adapt it to today’s needs.\r\nThat is a task in which we cannot afford to fail.\r\nUnless we succeed, the United Nations will fall behind\r\nthe times and gradually lose its relevance as an\r\neffective organization. It is our responsibility to reform\r\nand strengthen the United Nations so that it can\r\neffectively fulfil its objectives in the face of such\r\nemerging challenges and threats, as terrorism, the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, poverty,\r\nenvironmental degradation and the spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS and other pandemics.\r\nReforms are needed throughout the United\r\nNations system. Part VIII of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration lays out the various areas in which the\r\nUnited Nations needs to be strengthened. Among other\r\nrequirements, the central position of the General\r\nAssembly must be reaffirmed; our efforts to achieve\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council must be\r\nintensified; the Economic and Social Council must be\r\nfurther strengthened; and the Secretariat must be urged\r\nto make the best use of its resources. Japan is of the\r\nview that the core of all our efforts must be the reform\r\nof the Security Council. I will elaborate subsequently\r\non our views on those individual issues under the\r\nrelevant agenda items. Today, I would like to touch\r\nupon some issues related to the revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, as well as budgetary and\r\nadministrative affairs.\r\nThe President at the fifty-eighth session, Julian\r\nHunte, regarded General Assembly revitalization as\r\none of the priority issues of his term of office. During\r\nhis tenure, the Assembly adopted two significant\r\nresolutions, 58/126 and 58/316. I welcome the\r\nadoption of those two resolutions as a useful step\r\ntowards the revitalization of the Assembly. What must\r\nfollow now is for Member States faithfully to\r\nimplement those resolutions.\r\nPrior to the opening of the current session, we\r\nelected the President and the Vice-Presidents of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Chairpersons and the full\r\nBureaux of the Main Committees in early June, as\r\nstipulated in resolution 58/126. The transfer of duties\r\nfrom the outgoing to the incoming bureaux was carried\r\nout in an institutionalized manner, with the incoming\r\nofficials thus enabled to make the necessary\r\npreparations for their duties in advance. Therefore, I\r\nbelieve, we have made a good start at the current\r\nsession in securing the continuity of discussions to take\r\nplace during future sessions and in maintaining the\r\nmomentum for further reforms.\r\nDuring the consultations on those resolutions, we\r\nconsidered the possibility of rescheduling the work of\r\nthe Main Committees over two substantive periods\r\nduring the session. We have learned, however, that it\r\nwould be very difficult to realize such an arrangement.\r\nIt was pointed out that, because the conferences,\r\nactivities and events, both at Headquarters and outside\r\nNew York, are interrelated, reorganizing their working\r\nschedules would be an immensely complicated task.\r\nSome Member States also argued that the work of the\r\nMain Committees should not be separated from the\r\ngeneral debate, a point which, I believe, has merit. In\r\norder to reduce the congestion of the work schedule,\r\nopening the general debate in early September is an\r\nalternative that is worth exploring.\r\nWhat is most urgent and important, however, is\r\nthe rationalization and streamlining of our work\r\nagenda — the key factor in improving the efficiency of\r\nour work. I am convinced that not only small-sized\r\ndelegations, but all of us would benefit from further\r\nrationalization and streamlining of the agenda.\r\nIn that connection, we are glad that the two\r\nresolutions deal extensively with issues concerning the\r\nagenda. It is my hope that the new agenda, organized\r\non the basis of the resolutions, will help us to better\r\nstructure our work and eventually to raise our\r\nproductivity.\r\nIn addition, the General Assembly carried out a\r\nlong overdue review of the agenda, and the resulting\r\nelimination of two agenda items was certainly a good\r\nstep forward. We need to continue the process of\r\nrationalizing and streamlining the agenda. Each Main\r\nCommittee will work on the rationalization of its\r\nagenda during the session. I hope that they will come\r\nup with bold and substantive results.\r\nIn order to realize a new United Nations for the\r\nnew era and to steadily implement activities as\r\nintended, the United Nations needs the backing of\r\nresources. We need firm commitments on the part of\r\nMember States to foot the bill for projects and\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nactivities that are agreed to be vital in enabling the\r\nUnited Nations to meet new threats and challenges.\r\nHowever, it is also necessary to recognize the fact\r\nthat the capacities of Member States to pay is limited.\r\nTherefore, we must ensure that the United Nations\r\nfurther rationalizes its budget through strict\r\nprioritization of its activities. Reallocating resources\r\nfrom outdated activities to our new priorities is crucial.\r\nIt is also essential that the Secretariat be accountable to\r\nthe Member States regarding the resource requirements\r\nfor each activity and its performance. It is also\r\nimportant to determine whether the burden is fairly\r\ndistributed among Member States.\r\nIn order for the United Nations to remain an\r\neffective system of world governance, the obligations\r\nand rights of its Member States need to be balanced. If\r\nthe United Nations were to be perceived as losing\r\nlegitimacy and fairness in that respect, it would\r\nbecome difficult to retain the wholehearted support of\r\nMember States. In that regard we believe that the\r\ncurrent scale of assessments needs to be adjusted to be\r\nmore balanced, taking into account each country’s\r\nstatus and level of responsibility within the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe strengthening of the United Nations system\r\nrequires firm commitment and dedication on the part of\r\neach Member State. Japan is prepared to do its utmost\r\nin order to make a significant contribution to the\r\nprocess.\r\nMr. Siv (United States of America): The United\r\nStates has a long tradition of supporting civil society\r\nparticipation at the local, national and international\r\nlevels, and in particular, within the United Nations. We\r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s initiative in\r\nestablishing the panel led by President Cardoso. We\r\nsalute President Cardoso for his leadership. In public\r\nlife he has worked to create an environment in which\r\ncivil society can flourish; as a private citizen he\r\nembodies the power of civil society to promote\r\npositive change.\r\nWe are studying the report carefully. While it is\r\nnot possible at this time to respond fully to all\r\nsuggestions, the United States would like to present its\r\npreliminary reactions.\r\nFirst, we strongly agree that non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs) provide valuable input into the\r\nwork of the United Nations. NGOs are advocates and\r\nprogramme implementers at all levels of society. They\r\nbring a grass-roots perspective, which enhances the\r\nwork of the United Nations in the social, economic and\r\nhumanitarian spheres. However, a compelling case has\r\nnot been made that this relationship must be broadened\r\nfrom the Economic and Social Council to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nConsistent with the United Nations Charter, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies\r\nhave been — and continue to be — the appropriate\r\nvenues for the kind of meaningful NGO participation\r\nthat the report rightly extols. We believe that NGOs\r\nhave ample opportunities to participate in the\r\nfunctional commissions of the Council, as well as in\r\nUnited Nations conferences under existing\r\narrangements.\r\nThe United States requests further clarification on\r\nthe establishment of a single trust fund for NGOs. That\r\nrelates in particular to the replacement of established\r\nfunds, and the legal and funding issues that would\r\narise.\r\nSo long as responsibilities are not transferred\r\nfrom the Economic and Social Council to the General\r\nAssembly, we warmly welcome any improvements to\r\nthe NGO accreditation process. We support the\r\nproposals to improve the dialogue between the\r\nSecretariat and NGOs. We also encourage country-\r\nlevel engagement with NGOs. Initiatives to facilitate\r\nthe inclusion and implementation of local points of\r\nview into the functional commissions should be\r\nexplored.\r\nIn light of the report, we would like to reiterate\r\nour support for civil-society participation in the United\r\nNations system through the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and its subsidiary bodies. We agree with the\r\nPanel that multi-stakeholder partnerships are an\r\nimportant tool for addressing the challenges before us.\r\nWhile we are still reviewing the specific proposals, we\r\nwelcome efforts to foster such partnerships. In\r\nparticular, we acknowledge the innovative work done\r\nby the Commission on Sustainable Development in its\r\nrole as a focal point for partnerships that promote\r\nsustainable development.\r\nMr. Gatan (Philippines): The Philippine\r\ndelegation is elated, Sir, to note your resolve to give\r\npriority to the unfinished task of revitalizing the work\r\nof the General Assembly, as mentioned in your\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nstatement at the opening of the Assembly’s fifty-ninth\r\nsession.\r\nMay I, at the outset, state that my delegation\r\nassociates itself with the statement of Algeria, made on\r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, on agenda item\r\n52 on the revitalization of the work of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe task of revitalizing the work of the General\r\nAssembly, entrusted for implementation to the fifty-\r\neighth session as mandated by General Assembly\r\nresolution 58/126, was regrettably not fully completed.\r\nWe managed to partially implement the reforms sought\r\nunder that resolution. Although resolution 58/126 was\r\na collective product, adopted by consensus, we were\r\nunable to fully live up to the commitment made. That\r\ncould give rise to criticism that we adopted a rhetorical\r\nor nonchalant attitude towards the resolution, which\r\ncould strengthen the belief of critics that we continue\r\nto lack a genuine desire to improve and strengthen the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe must prove the critics wrong. We should\r\ndemonstrate that the General Assembly is not fast\r\nbecoming irrelevant and ineffective in the discharge of\r\nits mandate as the chief deliberative, policy-making\r\nand representative body of the United Nations, by\r\nconcluding, during the current session, the full\r\nimplementation of resolutions 58/126 and 58/316. We\r\nmust exercise the needed flexibility, and we must not\r\nbe hamstrung by narrow national or group interests.\r\nThe principle that form follows function should\r\nalways guide us in revitalizing the work of the General\r\nAssembly. The test of the relevance and effectiveness\r\nof working methods is whether or not they contribute\r\nto the effective and efficient performance of goals and\r\nobjectives.\r\nA salient substantive point of consideration on\r\nthe work of the General Assembly — a past concern\r\nthat continues in the present — is the implementation\r\nof many resolutions. The General Assembly has a\r\nbrilliant record of producing resolutions and decisions,\r\nbut, as regards the implementation of those resolutions,\r\nits performance does not seem encouraging.\r\nOur agreement to simplify the formulation of\r\nresolutions — which henceforth will be terse and\r\naction-oriented — is an example of how form follows\r\nfunction. My delegation hopes that, as a result of this\r\nagreement, our future resolutions will be so simplified\r\nthat they will enable the general public to understand\r\nwhat we decide here and to assess whether we did what\r\nwe promised to do. This guide aimed at improving the\r\nquality of resolutions so that our peoples — who are\r\nultimately the beneficiaries of our work — can better\r\nappreciate them and assess their performance\r\nrepresents significant progress in improving the work\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nUnlike other organs of the United Nations, the\r\nGeneral Assembly does not report to a higher body,\r\nbeing the chief policy-making body itself. In addition,\r\nits decisions are not binding. However, we should not\r\nforget that our actions are scrutinized by our peoples,\r\nwho have the final say as to whether or not the General\r\nAssembly is relevant to their concerns and effective in\r\nthe advancement of their interests.\r\nResolution 58/126 also calls for consultations\r\namong the three main United Nations organs — the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Economic and Social Council\r\nand the Security Council — in order to enhance\r\ncoordination on common concerns. There has been\r\ncompliance in that regard, but it has left much to be\r\ndesired, since no substantive coordination is reported\r\nto have arisen from such consultations. This is an area\r\nthat deserves further review so that we can reap the\r\nbenefits from such consultations. Likewise, there\r\nshould be prompt reporting of their outcomes for\r\nconsideration by the general membership.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation recognizes the\r\ndifficulties of introducing significant reforms in the\r\nwork of the General Assembly, which have become\r\ningrained in the nearly 60 years of its existence. My\r\ndelegation believes that, notwithstanding the slow pace\r\nof the implementation of the recommendations of\r\nresolution 58/126, important positive steps have\r\nalready been agreed upon. In that regard, my\r\ndelegation wishes to stress the importance of\r\nmaintaining our collective resolve to swiftly and\r\neffectively carry out what we have resolved to\r\naccomplish: the revitalization of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): At the outset, I\r\nwould like to express my delegation’s sincere gratitude\r\nto the Secretary-General for the report (A/59/354)\r\nbefore us today for consideration. We highly value the\r\nstrong commitment and the efforts of His Excellency\r\nMr. Julian Hunte, President of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-eighth session, in further revitalizing the work\r\nof the General Assembly during that session.\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nMy delegation wishes to align itself with the\r\nstatement made earlier by the representative of Algeria\r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement Working\r\nGroup on Reform of the United Nations and\r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation fully recognizes the vital\r\nimportance of the process of reform initiated by the\r\nSecretary-General, which has been under way for\r\nnearly a decade now. The success of that process of\r\nreform is crucial if the United Nations is to play its role\r\nmore effectively in the light of the many new and\r\nmajor challenges and threats — including war and\r\narmed conflict, hunger, poverty, terrorism and the\r\nspread of deadly diseases — facing the nations of the\r\nworld today.\r\nWe have noted with satisfaction that, according to\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/59/1), approximately 85 per cent of\r\nthe reform packages proposed in 1997 and 2002 have\r\nbeen either fully or partly implemented. I wish to\r\nassure the Secretary-General, the Secretariat and all\r\nother delegations of our full cooperation in carrying on\r\nthat important endeavour.\r\nMy delegation believes that the revitalization of\r\nthe work of the General Assembly remains among the\r\nmost essential elements of the process of United\r\nNations reform and therefore should be accorded\r\ncontinued priority. Efforts must be taken to enable the\r\nGeneral Assembly to play its role as the chief\r\ndeliberative, policy-making and representative organ of\r\nthe United Nations, as stated in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration by heads of State or Government in 2000.\r\nWe particularly welcome the adoption of two new\r\nresolutions — resolutions 58/126 and 58/316 — that\r\nput forth specific measures and proposals in that\r\nregard. Such measures as the periodical submission by\r\nthe Security Council of special subject-oriented reports\r\nto the General Assembly for its consideration, on\r\nissues of current international concern; regular\r\nbriefings by the President of the Security Council to\r\nthe President of the General Assembly on the work of\r\nthe Council; and periodic meetings among the\r\nPresidents of the General Assembly, the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council to\r\ndiscuss ways to improve cooperation and coordination\r\nare highly worthwhile.\r\nIn his four special reports (A/59/CRP.3, 4, 5 and\r\n6), the Secretary-General provides useful information\r\nand detailed analysis on the working methods of the\r\nMain Committees, the conceptualization of the agenda\r\nof the General Assembly, the priorities of the\r\nOrganization and the reordering of the work of the\r\nAssembly. We support the option to reschedule the\r\nwork of the Main Committees over two substantive\r\nperiods during the session rather than the current three-\r\nmonth period, because that would help to reduce the\r\nburden on the small- and medium-sized missions and\r\nallow them to participate more effectively in meetings\r\nand consultations. However, given the different nature\r\nand scope of each Committee, my delegation is of the\r\nview that it would be best for each Committee to\r\nexamine and decide its own working methods.\r\nWhile positive progress has been made in certain\r\nareas, my delegation is cognizant of the problem of the\r\ndelay in implementation and the non-implementation\r\nof resolutions related to the revitalization of the work\r\nof the General Assembly. We pledge to join\r\ncoordinated actions to address this situation.\r\nRight from the start, when the process of reform\r\nof the United Nations was put in place, not only the\r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly, but\r\nalso the reform of the Security Council has always\r\nbeen high on the agenda, perhaps the subject of the\r\nmost serious debates and proposals. In 2000, at the\r\nMillennium Summit, our leaders called for\r\ncomprehensive reform. This is a very important issue\r\nindeed. The events of the past few years have made it\r\neven more so.\r\nWhat my delegation wishes to emphasize here is\r\nthat, while pushing ahead on efforts to reform the\r\nSecurity Council, we must not forget that strengthening\r\nthe United Nations system calls for reform and\r\nrevitalization of the work of all of its main bodies. We\r\nmust not lose sight of the need to strengthen the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, whose work is of\r\nparamount importance to all countries, especially\r\ndeveloping countries, and whose work and methods of\r\ndeliberation have revealed serious flaws. In that\r\nconnection, we fully support the initiatives aimed at\r\nstrengthening the Economic and Social Council’s role\r\nas the mechanism for system-wide coordination in\r\nsocial and economic matters, especially with other\r\ninternational institutions such as the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization, in order\r\nto make the Council more effective in addressing the\r\ndevelopment agenda of the United Nations.\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nIn his report in document A/59/354, the\r\nSecretary-General makes a number of concrete\r\nsuggestions for increasing the participation of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in intergovernmental\r\nbodies, including suggestions for their involvement in\r\nthe work of the General Assembly, the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council. My\r\ndelegation recognizes the significant contributions by\r\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs) to the cause\r\nof economic and social development in many\r\ndeveloping countries, ours among them. We recognize,\r\nas well, their contributions to the work of our\r\nOrganization. My delegation holds the view that these\r\nconcrete suggestions should be studied and considered\r\ncarefully by Member States so as to ensure not only the\r\nincreased participation of NGOs, but also the\r\navoidance of abuse by those engaging in illegitimate,\r\npolitically-motivated activities against sovereign\r\nMember States, as we have often witnessed. We\r\nsupport the proposal to draw up a code of conduct for\r\nNGOs that participate in United Nations activities,\r\nwith a view to ensuring their responsibility and\r\naccountability.\r\nThe revitalization of the work of the General\r\nAssembly and the strengthening of the United Nations\r\nsystem are aimed at making the United Nations\r\nstronger and more effective in facing and responding to\r\nboth traditional and new global threats and challenges.\r\nResolution 58/269, entitled “Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations: an agenda for further change”, and\r\nresolution 58/317, entitled “Reaffirming the central\r\nrole of the United Nations in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and the promotion of\r\ninternational cooperation”, were adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly with an overwhelming majority last\r\nAugust and gave new impetus to our endeavours. We\r\nhope that our debate today will help unite our minds\r\nand bring us closer to our common goal.\r\nMr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French):\r\nThere is no need to dwell here on the importance that\r\nSwitzerland attaches to a strong and effective United\r\nNations that is capable of taking up the challenges\r\npresented by the modern world, especially in the fields\r\nof security, respect for human rights and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in all its aspects. The continuing reform\r\nprocess of the United Nations is one of the keys that\r\nwill allow us to achieve this objective and to forge a\r\nmore effective multilateralism.\r\nThe Secretary-General wishes to revitalize this\r\nprocess of reform by establishing two review panels of\r\nhigh-level experts. Switzerland welcomes this\r\ninnovative approach and is looking forward to studying\r\nthe report of the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change in December. We are pleased\r\ntoday to be able to respond to the report of the Panel of\r\nEminent Persons on United Nations-Civil Society\r\nRelations.\r\nSwitzerland has noted with great interest the\r\ncontents of the Cardoso report on civil society relations\r\nand supports the thrust of the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposals. My country is open to the participation of\r\ncivil society and we believe that the United Nations\r\nwould strengthen its legitimacy by involving civil\r\nsociety more in its work.\r\nEncouraging partnerships is undoubtedly one way\r\nof strengthening the United Nations: partnerships\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations,\r\nas well as parliaments, non-governmental organizations\r\nand private companies.\r\nWithin the framework of specific measures to\r\nstrengthen the interaction between civil society and the\r\nUnited Nations, Switzerland supports the proposal by\r\nthe Secretary-General to organize interactive meetings\r\nwith non-governmental organizations and\r\nparliamentarians before important events are held. We\r\ntherefore support the idea of testing the feasibility of\r\nsuch meetings by holding one before the high-level\r\nmeeting on HIV/AIDS, which is to be held on 2 June\r\n2005.\r\nRelations with civil society should not be\r\nconstrained by a bureaucratic and centralized approach.\r\nThe ability of the specialized agencies, funds and\r\nprogrammes to manoeuvre and take initiatives should\r\nbe preserved, while maintaining positive existing\r\npractices. In this context, Switzerland would like to\r\nemphasize the interest that exists in initiatives\r\ndeveloped in this field in Geneva, in some cases over a\r\nperiod of several decades. My country is therefore\r\nwilling to study the formal and informal modes of\r\ninteraction that take place in Geneva between civil\r\nsociety, NGOs and the United Nations, and to select\r\nthe best practices and lessons learned in this area and\r\nshare them with interested actors.\r\nAs for the establishment of the Partnerships\r\nOffice, we take note of the progress made in setting it\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.18\r\nup, and we would appreciate it if the concept of such\r\nan office could be developed further by the Secretariat.\r\nMoreover, Switzerland reiterates its belief that\r\nthe Global Compact must remain completely\r\nautonomous. The specific nature of its activity vis-à-\r\nvis companies, which it tries to convince of the\r\nfundamental values of the United Nations in the fields\r\nof human rights, social rights, protection of the\r\nenvironment and the fight against corruption, requires\r\nthat it should retain maximum independence.\r\nFor Switzerland, the revitalization of the work of\r\nthe General Assembly is a cornerstone of the United\r\nNations reform process. The Assembly needs to\r\nrecover its central role and should operate more\r\neffectively and more efficiently. A very important step\r\nin this direction was taken in July, with the adoption of\r\nresolution 58/316 on the improvement of the\r\nAssembly’s working methods. We are pleased that the\r\nmajority of the measures proposed are now being\r\nimplemented.\r\nMr. President, at this point I would like to pay\r\ntribute to the work of your predecessor, Mr. Julian\r\nHunte, without whose perseverance we would probably\r\nnot have achieved such results. We have every\r\nconfidence that you will continue his efforts in the\r\nsame direction and with the same success, in particular\r\non the central issue that still remains open for the fifty-\r\nninth session — that of the General Assembly\r\nschedule.\r\nI would like to make some observations on this\r\nlast point. Switzerland is not convinced of the added\r\nvalue of distributing the work of the Main Committees\r\nthroughout the session. Such dispersal of work could\r\nencourage the postponement of decisions and lead to a\r\nprolongation of sessions or even to a need for more\r\nplenary meetings, which would involve additional\r\ncosts. Moreover, the question of synchronization with\r\nthe budgetary cycle has not yet been resolved.\r\nSwitzerland wishes to stress that it advocates the\r\nsuccessive holding of meetings of the six Main\r\nCommittees from the beginning of September to the\r\nend of December. Such a solution would afford all\r\nCommittees the same weight and importance and\r\nencourage synergies among them.\r\nIn the course of this fifty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Switzerland intends to continue to\r\nsupport and to make its contribution to the\r\nrevitalization process of the Assembly and to the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations in general.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n"
