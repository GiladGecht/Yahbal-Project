(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda items 52 and 54 (continued)\r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations system\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/59/354)\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): We welcome\r\nthis joint debate, since we believe that United Nations\r\nreform must be comprehensive in order to be\r\nsuccessful. While the Secretariat of the Organization\r\ncontinues to do its part with regard to reform and has\r\nachieved significant improvements over the past few\r\nyears, we as Member States continue to lag behind in\r\nour own efforts. I will therefore concentrate my\r\nremarks on the intergovernmental area.\r\nMr. President, thanks to the hard work and\r\nleadership of your predecessor, President Julian Hunte,\r\nwhich led to the adoption of two resolutions in\r\nDecember 2003 and July 2004, a process of General\r\nAssembly revitalization deserving of that name is\r\nfinally under way. The revitalization process has\r\nreceived a jump-start that we must translate into action\r\nso as to achieve further progress leading up to the\r\nanniversary session and the major event in 2005.\r\nAfter the adoption of the second resolution on\r\nrevitalization by the General Assembly in July, we\r\nwere among the Member States that expressed concern\r\nthat the measures agreed upon did not go far enough.\r\nNevertheless, we acknowledge that the package\r\nadopted goes far beyond earlier initiatives. After many\r\nyears of frustration and stalemate, we now have reason\r\nto believe that change is indeed possible.\r\nSome of the measures adopted address areas of\r\nparticular importance, such as cooperation with the\r\nSecurity Council; more use of interactive debates and\r\ninformal briefings; monitoring of the follow-up of\r\nresolutions; and reduction of the unworkable load of\r\ndocumentation and of the number of resolutions.\r\nThese decisions need to pass the test of practical\r\napplication in the daily workings of this Assembly. We\r\nhave reached a sound common understanding of what\r\nis needed, but this understanding will have the desired\r\neffect only if we also agree on the ways to put it into\r\npractice. Our next target date is April 2005, and we\r\nbelieve that we must concentrate our efforts on further\r\nstreamlining the agenda, as well as reducing\r\ndocumentation and the number of resolutions this\r\nAssembly adopts.\r\nThe resolutions on revitalization also call on the\r\nMain Committees to contribute their share to the\r\nprocess. In the preparation of the work of the\r\nCommittees for this session, the spirit of revitalization\r\ncan already be felt. We hope that this spirit will be\r\nreinforced during the coming months and will lead to\r\ngreater efficiency in the work of the Committees.\r\nResolution 58/316 requests the Secretary-General to\r\nreport on all aspects of the implementation of the\r\nagreed measures in September 2005. This is crucial in\r\norder to sustain the momentum and to ensure\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nappropriate follow-up and completion of the reform\r\nmeasures. The report on the success of the measures\r\ntaken so far should be comprehensive, and it should\r\ntrigger an irreversible process. We hope that this debate\r\nwill help carry the momentum on revitalization for the\r\ncoming months.\r\nIn the interplay of the main organs of the United\r\nNations, this Assembly should play a crucial role. It\r\nwas conceived as the most important part of a system\r\nof checks and balances, but it no longer fulfils this\r\nfunction effectively. This is particularly lamentable at a\r\ntime when the Security Council is more active than\r\never and reaching into novel areas, such as law-\r\nmaking. Meanwhile, the General Assembly, the organ\r\ndesigned for inclusiveness and transparency and which\r\nshould provide a certain counterbalance to the Council,\r\nis far from using all its powers effectively and\r\nefficiently. This is a dangerous development that\r\njeopardizes the institutional and political balance\r\nforming the basis of genuine multilateralism.\r\nThe General Assembly, as a result of the process\r\nof revitalization, must again find its role as the prime\r\nrepresentative of the United Nations membership in a\r\nsystem of checks and balances among the different\r\norgans. In this respect, the year 2005 will be our next\r\ndestination. It is clear that 2005 will bring about a\r\nmajor event, and it will be marked by great political\r\nmomentum. In terms of reform, this momentum must\r\nnot only be directed at the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. The big dividing lines will not become\r\nsmaller if we concentrate our efforts on this single\r\nissue, important as it is, without looking at other\r\naspects.\r\nEnlargement of the Security Council is naturally\r\nthe talk of the day, as the just-concluded general debate\r\nillustrated very clearly. However, enlargement of the\r\nCouncil alone will not make this Organization stronger\r\nand more effective, so we must continue to look at the\r\noverall picture, in which the interplay of the main\r\norgans and thus the role of this Assembly play a\r\ndecisive role. We hope that the report of the High-\r\nLevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change will be\r\na source of inspiration and provide political momentum\r\nto streamline the reform process and move it in a good\r\ndirection.\r\nWe appreciate the excellent work done by the\r\nSecretary-General on a great number of issues, in\r\nparticular in the implementation of his 2002 report on\r\nthe strengthening of the United Nations. In many\r\nrespects, the Secretariat has been more capable of\r\ninternal reform then we, the Member States, have been\r\nat the intergovernmental level. We appreciate in\r\nparticular the fact that the United Nations system\r\npresents itself in a clearer and more accessible manner\r\nand that improvements have been made in the budget\r\ncycle.\r\nWe also thank the Deputy Secretary-General,\r\nLouise Fréchette, for presenting the report of the Panel\r\nof Eminent Persons on United Nations-Civil Society\r\nRelations. We agree that we have to make the United\r\nNations a more outward-looking organization that\r\nconnects the global with the local. Better interaction\r\nwith civil society, as well as with other relevant actors\r\nsuch as regional organizations, the private sector and\r\nthe media, is an important step in that direction.\r\nMr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan): Last week, we\r\nall witnessed a broad discussion on the issue of the\r\nstrengthening of the role of the United Nations,\r\ninvolving heads of State and Government and foreign\r\nministers. A common understanding of the need to\r\nconstantly adapt the Organization to the changing\r\nworld around us so that it can meet the challenges of\r\nour time is an important outcome of that debate.\r\nIt has been said many times, and never better than\r\nby the Secretary-General of the United Nations, that in\r\norder to make our Organization more effective and\r\nefficient, we must be well-prepared to change with the\r\ntimes, constantly adjusting to complex international\r\nchallenges. But we cannot meet the new challenges and\r\naddress the acute problems of today by continuing to\r\nrely on old approaches. The central issue of\r\ninternational relations is to turn the United Nations into\r\nan effective tool designed to strengthen regional and\r\nglobal security systems, including the regime of non-\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and to\r\nmanage globalization processes. Member States should\r\nprovide the Organization with all the necessary\r\nresources, so that it can perform its multiple tasks\r\neffectively.\r\nAs a matter of principle, we consider it important\r\nto ensure a balance in the functioning of the General\r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, as envisioned in the Charter of this\r\nOrganization. We insist on the need to strengthen the\r\nrole of the General Assembly in settling the most\r\nimportant issues facing humanity today. In our view,\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nthe efforts of the international community to combat\r\nterrorism and to settle armed conflicts can be made\r\nmore effective only on the basis of such an approach.\r\nFrom the very beginning, Kazakhstan has\r\nsupported the Secretary-General’s decision to establish\r\na high-level panel on United Nations reform. We\r\nbelieve that the High-Level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change, with its broad mandate, will\r\narrive at an acceptable solution to this crucial issue of\r\ntoday. We are looking forward to the Panel’s report\r\ncontaining recommendations on the changes we need\r\nto make for the Organization to be effective against the\r\nthreats of the twenty-first century. Kazakhstan is ready\r\nto be actively involved in the discussion of that\r\nimportant document.\r\nRegional arrangements play an increasingly\r\nimportant role in the collective security system. Better\r\ncoordination between them and the United Nations will\r\ngo a long way towards building up the capacity for\r\neffective response in the field. In this context,\r\nKazakhstan calls for the establishment of a council of\r\nregional organizations, under the auspices of the\r\nSecretary-General. We also believe that that proposal\r\nreflects the need to strengthen global multilateral\r\ncooperation.\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions 58/126 and 58/316,\r\nwhich are aimed at enhancing the authority of the\r\nAssembly, confirmed the fundamental role of this\r\nOrganization in international affairs. They gave a clear\r\nindication of the Assembly’s recognition that, for the\r\nUnited Nations, reform must be an ongoing process\r\nand that the General Assembly must turn the spotlight\r\nof reform on itself.\r\nWe take note of the fact that there has been some\r\nprogress in the revitalization of the General Assembly\r\nand the improvement of its methods of work. At the\r\nsame time, we believe that this process should not\r\nundercut the thrust of the reforms designed primarily to\r\nstrengthen the authority of the Assembly and to\r\nimprove the effectiveness of its actions. We must bear\r\nin mind that decisions leading to adjustments to the\r\nagenda are among the most sensitive that Member\r\nStates have to make.\r\nWe commend you, Mr. President, for your resolve\r\nto continue to press ahead with the General Assembly\r\nreform initiatives that were approved late last year. We\r\nshare the view that every effort must be made to halt\r\nthe erosion of the strengths of the Assembly as the\r\nmajor United Nations forum for debating international\r\nissues.\r\nThe Secretary-General has made it clear that\r\nimproved relations between the United Nations and\r\ncivil society is an important element of the programme\r\nof reform. To that end, he appointed the Panel of\r\nEminent Persons on United Nations-Civil Society\r\nRelations.\r\nWe welcome the report prepared by the Panel,\r\nwhich has made a valuable contribution to the reform\r\nprocess of the United Nations. It offers innovative\r\nideas aimed at strengthening partnership with civil\r\nsociety in humanitarian and development activities and\r\ncontains concrete measures to increase the\r\nparticipation of civil society in the work of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Panel makes a compelling case for the\r\nUnited Nations to become a more outward-looking\r\nOrganization and connect the global with the local. We\r\nalso believe that expanding and deepening the\r\nrelationship with non-governmental organizations will\r\nfurther strengthen the intergovernmental debates on\r\nglobal issues.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that\r\nKazakhstan will continue to exert every effort to\r\nensure that the Organization occupies its rightful place\r\nin world affairs.\r\nMr. Kim Sam-hoon (Republic of Korea): During\r\nthe fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly,\r\nMember States deliberated at length on ways to\r\nrevitalize the General Assembly. Although resolutions\r\n58/316 and 58/126 were not as comprehensive as we\r\nhad initially hoped they would be, the Republic of\r\nKorea is nonetheless pleased with the progress that has\r\nbeen made as a result. For example, the Office of the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly has been\r\nconsiderably strengthened, in line with part A,\r\nparagraph 10, of the annex to resolution 58/126.\r\nMoreover, beginning this year, the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is being organized under headings\r\ncorresponding to the priorities of the Organization,\r\nwhich has made it significantly more approachable and\r\naccessible.\r\nNevertheless, despite this progress there is more\r\nwork to be done. It is vital that we maintain the\r\nmomentum for change. As the Republic of Korea\r\naddressed the broad issue of General Assembly\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nrevitalization during the fifty-eighth session, I would\r\nnow like to highlight specific areas of reform that we\r\nbelieve should be addressed during the fifty-ninth\r\nsession.\r\nFirst, we would like to stress the importance of\r\nallowing the General Committee to play the leading\r\nrole in advising the General Assembly on the efficient\r\norganization, coordination and management of its\r\nwork, as stated in part E, paragraph 5 (b) of the annex\r\nto resolution 58/316. The General Committee must\r\nmeet regularly, and we would like to see the President\r\ncontinue to remain actively involved in the work of the\r\nGeneral Committee.\r\nMore specifically, we would like to see the\r\nGeneral Committee consider the biennialization,\r\ntriennialization, clustering and elimination customary\r\nagenda items and to make recommendations as soon as\r\npossible. As Member States have made clear, the\r\nrationalization of the agenda must be an ongoing\r\nprocess.\r\nSecondly, we recall that document A/58/CRP.7,\r\non control and limitation on documentation, was not\r\nadequately discussed during the previous session. We\r\nhope that it will become a major item for discussion\r\nduring the fifty-ninth session. As document\r\nA/58/CRP.7 correctly notes, the sheer volume of\r\ndocumentation required from the Secretariat is\r\npreventing it from offering value-added and in-depth\r\nanalysis on important subject matter. Indeed, last year\r\nalone the United Nations produced no less than 318\r\ndifferent resolutions — a truly mind-boggling number.\r\nIt has become almost impossible for Member States to\r\neffectively absorb what is being provided. Therefore,\r\nthere must be serious discussions on ways to curtail the\r\nquantity, length and frequency of documentation, and\r\nwe hope that concrete and effective measures in this\r\nrespect are taken during the fifty-ninth session.\r\nThirdly, as stated in part A, paragraph 6 of the\r\nannex to resolution 58/126, we urge the President of\r\nthe General Assembly to meet regularly, perhaps once\r\nevery month, with the Presidents of both the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council. We\r\nbelieve that that practice would not only strengthen the\r\nrole and authority of the General Assembly but also\r\nallow for better coordination among the major organs\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nFourthly, the Republic of Korea would like to see\r\nmore interactive debates take place during discussions,\r\nnot only in the Main Committees but also during\r\nGeneral Committee meetings. We hope that, as\r\noutlined in resolution 58/316, a revitalized General\r\nCommittee will soon recommend to the General\r\nAssembly a programme and format for such interactive\r\ndebates.\r\nOn the issue of strengthening the United Nations\r\nsystem, while my delegation recognizes that the issue\r\nof civil society participation at the United Nations has\r\na long and complex history, we concur with the\r\nSecretary-General that expanding and deepening the\r\nrelationship with non-governmental organizations will\r\nfurther strengthen the United Nations and the\r\nintergovernmental debates on issues of global import.\r\nThus we welcome the Secretary-General’s report\r\n(A/59/354) and commend the efforts of the Panel of\r\nEminent Persons on United Nations-Civil Society\r\nRelations, led by former President Fernando Henrique\r\nCardoso of Brazil, on which the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport is based. In general, we find the\r\nrecommendations contained in the report to be\r\ncomprehensive and forward-looking in making the\r\nparticipation of non-governmental organizations\r\n(NGOs) at the United Nations more meaningful and\r\nresponsive to the changing needs and expectations of\r\nboth global and civil society. We will carefully study\r\nthe recommendations with a view to working with\r\nothers to turn them into concrete action.\r\nIn conclusion, the Republic of Korea believes\r\nthat the revitalization of the General Assembly and the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations system must be an\r\nongoing and dynamic process. Member States must\r\nlook beyond their own individual priorities towards the\r\ngreater collective good if we are to truly strengthen the\r\neffectiveness and efficiency of this global body. The\r\nGeneral Assembly is the sole global forum in which all\r\nnations and peoples have a voice; we must never allow\r\nthat voice to be muffled due to organizational\r\ninefficiencies. The Republic of Korea pledges its full\r\nsupport for the revitalization of the General Assembly\r\nand the strengthening of the United Nations system,\r\nand we urge Member States to sustain the momentum\r\nof reform.\r\nMr. Mwangi (Kenya): Mr. President, my\r\ndelegation wishes once again to extend its\r\ncongratulations to you on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession. We look forward to fruitful deliberations under\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nyour stewardship. Kenya appreciates the excellent\r\nwork carried out by your predecessor, especially with\r\nregard to the revitalization of the work of the General\r\nAssembly and the strengthening of the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nOver the years, the General Assembly has\r\ngrappled with the issue of its own revitalization. As the\r\nAssembly has been overburdened by its own agenda, it\r\nis gratifying to note that, during the last session, efforts\r\nwere expended to cluster, biannualize, triannualize and\r\neven eliminate items on the customary agenda of the\r\nAssembly. This was in accordance with part B,\r\nparagraph 5, of the annex to resolution 58/126, which\r\npostulated that:\r\n“It would be advantageous for the General\r\nAssembly to have a shorter agenda to ensure the\r\nfullest discussions of all issues, so that its\r\ndecisions may have greater impact.”\r\nThat is the direction we need to take.\r\nAs regards the Main Committees, Kenya supports\r\nthe rescheduling of the work of the Committees and the\r\nidea of conceptualizing the agenda around the priorities\r\nof the Organization. My delegation believes that\r\nimproved procedures and working methods as well as\r\nthe rationalization of the agenda of the Main\r\nCommittees would be an important step towards the\r\nrevitalization of the Assembly.\r\nImproving procedures and working methods is\r\nnot an end in itself. It is also important to examine\r\nways and means of enhancing the capacity of the\r\nSecretariat to enable it to serve the aspirations of the\r\nMain Committees. The Secretariat should therefore be\r\nprovided with the requisite resources and personnel for\r\nit to perform as expected. The Secretariat’s ability to\r\ngenerate documents on time has, in the recent past,\r\nbeen seriously constrained. Documentation delays\r\nprevent Main Committees from discharging their work\r\nsmoothly and in a timely fashion. This is an area we\r\nneed to streamline with a view to taking remedial\r\nsteps.\r\nWe decry the continuing emasculation of the\r\nGeneral Assembly by other organs of the Organization.\r\nIn the process of the reinvention of the United Nations,\r\nthe starting point should be the General Assembly\r\nitself. It should regain its role as the principal decision-\r\nmaking and policy-making body. Far-reaching\r\ndecisions that have great impact on global affairs must\r\nbe made by the voice of the majority. That voice can be\r\nfound only in the General Assembly. Multilateralism\r\nshould prevail.\r\nWith regard to the Security Council, my\r\ndelegation believes that it should be transparent,\r\nresponsive and democratized in order to meet the\r\nsecurity threats of the twenty-first century. The\r\nEconomic and Social Council has to undergo drastic\r\nsurgery for it to meet the ever-changing economic and\r\nsocial challenges, particularly those in developing\r\ncountries. The Council should meet more frequently\r\nand establish closer working relations in coordination\r\nwith international financial institutions, specialized\r\nagencies and United Nations programmes. The United\r\nNations institutions should find a new synergy so that\r\nthey can work for the betterment of humankind in the\r\nareas of peace, sustainable development and human\r\ndignity.\r\nConcerning the strengthening of the United\r\nNations, Kenya supports and welcomes the efforts\r\nmade by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in this area.\r\nWe urge him to continue to pursue efforts to explore\r\nand establish mutually beneficial relations with non-\r\ntraditional groups and bodies. The recent report of the\r\nhigh-level Panel on civil society is clear case in point\r\nof the efforts by the Secretary-General to strengthen\r\nthe United Nations system. The report contains\r\npositive suggestions as to how the United Nations\r\ncould maximize the potential of civil society to\r\nimprove the effectiveness of the international system.\r\nThough the overall report is commendable, some of the\r\nrecommendations still require our concerted\r\nassessment and review. For instance, the\r\nrecommendation on the relationship of civil society\r\nvis-à-vis the General Assembly could, in our view,\r\ncontravene Article 71 of the United Nations Charter.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the appointment of the\r\nHigh-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change,\r\nestablished by the Secretary-General during the\r\nprevious session of the General Assembly. It is our\r\nexpectation that, when the Panel delivers its report at\r\nthe end of the year, its verdict will revolutionize the\r\ncurrent state of the United Nations. The panel\r\nconsulted widely, and we expect that the views\r\nexpressed — particularly those of the developing\r\ncountries, which form the majority of the\r\nmembership — will be taken into consideration.\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nIn conclusion, Kenya is fully committed to the\r\nprocess of the revitalization of the Organization. My\r\ndelegation would like to see a strong United Nations\r\nwith the capacity to effectively and efficiently\r\nmoderate the delicate, multifaceted and rapid changes\r\nthe world is experiencing. The United Nations has to\r\nbe vibrant and reassert itself in its inherent role of\r\nmaintaining global peace and security on the one hand\r\nand enhancing accelerated economic development on\r\nthe other.\r\nMr. Sychov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The\r\ndelegation of the Republic of Belarus attaches great\r\nimportance to strengthening and reforming the United\r\nNations. On the eve of its sixtieth anniversary, the\r\nOrganization’s relevance with respect to the modern\r\nrealities of international politics and its capacity to\r\nplay the central role in overcoming global threats and\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century have posed\r\nsharper and pivotal questions.\r\nBelarus supports the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral aimed at improving the Organization’s\r\nactivities through encouraging dialogue among States\r\non the major aspects of reform. Following the\r\npresentation of the report of the High-Level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change we expect broad\r\nconsultations with Member States will be organized to\r\ndiscuss the report’s recommendations for transforming\r\nthe Organization and improving its activities in the\r\narea of the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nToday no one doubts the need to modernize the\r\nUnited Nations in order to deal effectively with the\r\ntasks before it in the twenty-first century. The only\r\ndoubt concerns the inevitability and real need for\r\nfundamental institutional change of the United Nations\r\nsystem — with the exception of the question of\r\nenlargement of the Security Council — and the\r\nnecessity of reconsidering the basic principles of the\r\nUnited Nations activities enshrined in its Charter. The\r\nexisting mechanisms of the Charter, in particular in the\r\nfield of maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, have proved to be quite viable and the\r\npossibilities for their adaptation to the changing\r\ninternational situation have not been exhausted.\r\nThe basic tenet of Belarus’s position on the\r\nproblem of United Nations reform is that the intention\r\nshould not be to belittle the significance of the\r\nprinciples of the Charter or seek to revise them. That\r\napproach is by no means an expression of\r\nconservatism, but, rather, a reflection of our country’s\r\ndesire to enhance the integrity of the fundamental basis\r\nof the Organization, which is an important prerequisite\r\nfor the peaceful coexistence of States and the\r\nattainment of a just international order.\r\nFurther to the approach we have outlined,\r\nBelarus, together with other Member States of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, sponsored a draft resolution,\r\nentitled “Reaffirming the central role of the United\r\nNations in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity and the promotion of international\r\ncooperation”, which was adopted by the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session as resolution\r\n58/317. That resolution is a significant instrument for\r\nfinding ways to increase the efficacy of the United\r\nNations and helped to elaborate guidelines for the\r\nHigh-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change\r\nin preparing its reform proposals.\r\nIn the context of the Secretary-General’s efforts\r\ntowards strengthening and democratizing the United\r\nNations, our delegation on the whole has a positive\r\nassessment of the outcome of deliberations of the Panel\r\nof Eminent Persons on United Nations-Civil Society\r\nRelations. At the same time, it is critical to note that\r\nbroadening of interaction of the United Nations with\r\nnon-governmental organizations should be organized in\r\nsuch a manner as not to put in doubt the role of the\r\nUnited Nations as an effective forum of\r\nintergovernmental communication.\r\nThe delegation of Belarus would like to draw\r\nattention to such promising developments towards the\r\nrevitalization of the United Nations activities and its\r\ndemocratization as the creation of mechanisms to\r\nexpand the participation of parliamentarians in the\r\nactivities of the Organization. At present, the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union positively contributes to the\r\ndevelopment of contacts between parliamentarians and\r\nthe United Nations through the annual parliamentary\r\nhearings held during the substantive part of the General\r\nAssembly session. Other means of enhancing the\r\nparliamentary dimension in United Nations activities,\r\nparticularly in the work of its principal representative\r\norgan, the General Assembly, could also be developed.\r\nRevitalization of work of the General Assembly\r\nis one of the major focuses of the process of\r\nstrengthening and reforming the United Nations. We\r\nwelcome the steps undertaken at the fifty-eighth\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nsession by the previous President of the General\r\nAssembly, Mr. Julian Hunte, in order to stimulate\r\ndiscussion on how to revitalize the work of the General\r\nAssembly and increase its authority within the United\r\nNations system. General Assembly resolutions 58/126\r\nand 58/316 established a good basis for us to continue\r\nour work during this session on further measures to\r\nstrengthen the status of the General Assembly and on\r\nlaying the groundwork for the effective implementation\r\nof its authority under the Charter.\r\nThe General Assembly is the main representative\r\norgan of the United Nations, whose capacity must be\r\nfully utilized for the interests of advocating a\r\nmultilateral approach to the resolution of international\r\nproblems. While advocating the process of\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, the Republic of\r\nBelarus would warn against its bureaucratization and\r\nan unjustifiably increased burden on the United\r\nNations budget as a consequence of reform measures.\r\nWe propose a comprehensive analysis of the\r\nconsequences for the entire United Nations system\r\nresulting from the possible change in the schedule of\r\nwork of the Main Committees of the General\r\nAssembly. We share the opinion that any reordering of\r\nthe schedules of work of all six Committees is\r\nadvisable within the traditional period of their\r\nfunctioning, from September to December.\r\nTherefore, we call upon you, Mr. President, to\r\nconcentrate your efforts on solving the priority\r\nproblems related to the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly. In that regard, Belarus considers priority\r\nshould be given to further measures to improve the\r\nworking methods of the Assembly by optimizing and\r\nrationalizing the agenda, by refraining from the\r\npractice of adopting overlapping and repeating\r\nresolutions, by cutting down the length of debates on\r\nagenda items and by placing emphasis on the quality of\r\nresolutions.\r\nBelarus backs the measures aimed at\r\nstrengthening the status of the General Assembly\r\namong the major organs of the United Nations system,\r\nas well as reconsidering its current relations with other\r\nprincipal statutory organs. We consider that the\r\nestablishment of a mechanism of coordination between\r\nthe presidents of the General Assembly, Security\r\nCouncil and Economic and Social Council, in\r\nconformity with resolution 58/126, will constitute a\r\nfirst practical step towards the enhancement of the\r\nauthority of the General Assembly.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to reassure you,\r\nMr. President, that the delegation of Belarus intends to\r\ncooperate fully in the task of elaborating positive,\r\ngenerally acceptable ways to strengthen the\r\nOrganization and revitalize its General Assembly.\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): The representative of Algeria\r\nspoke this morning on behalf of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement and we support his statement. We only wish\r\nnow to add a few points of emphasis from the\r\nstandpoint of the delegation of Jamaica.\r\nThe primacy of the General Assembly and its\r\ncentral place as the chief deliberative organ of the\r\nUnited Nations is established in the Charter. To\r\nstrengthen the United Nations and to strengthen\r\nmultilateralism we should regard revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly as a major priority.\r\nDuring the past session under the energetic\r\nleadership of the outgoing President, the process was\r\nadvanced by the adoption of resolutions 58/126 and\r\n58/316, which contain provisions to improve working\r\nrelations between the various organs, to organize and\r\nrationalize the agenda, to improve working methods\r\nand to strengthen the office of the presidency. As this\r\nis an evolving process there is unfinished business to\r\nbe worked on during this session, principally in three\r\nareas.\r\nFirst, there is a need to reorder the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to spread its work over the year and\r\nto dilute concentration at the autumn session. This has\r\nthe advantage of extending the activity of the\r\nAssembly and allowing for an increased level of\r\nparticipation by all delegations. We realize that there\r\nare different options which should be considered, and\r\nwhich are viable alternatives to the holding of two\r\nmain sessions, which we still regard as being the best\r\noption.\r\nThe second area is the reform of the mandate and\r\ncomposition of the General Committee to improve its\r\ncapability to manage and direct the work of the\r\nAssembly. Finally, there is need for further work on\r\nrationalizing the agenda and for improving methods of\r\nwork.\r\nBeyond those structural changes, there are actions\r\nat the level of Member States which should be taken to\r\ninvigorate the Assembly.\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nFirst, the Assembly should debate topical issues\r\nfacing the international community, while respecting\r\nthe narrow limitations of Article 12 of the Charter. As\r\nthe voice of the international community, the General\r\nAssembly should be convened more frequently to give\r\nexpression to world opinion on the critical issues of the\r\nday. The Charter and rules of procedure provide for\r\nthis and only requires the political action of Member\r\nStates.\r\nThe second area is improvement in the quality of\r\nresolutions which should be less repetitive, with more\r\nsubstantive content concerning their pronouncements\r\non current developments.\r\nThe third area is movement towards a more\r\ninteractive framework for discussions and away from\r\nthe current dull monotony of formal statements.\r\nTradition is hard to break but innovative techniques\r\ncan be tried to enliven the debates in the Main\r\nCommittees.\r\nThe fourth area is implementation. The norms\r\nand policies established by the General Assembly\r\nshould be implemented. Although these may not be\r\nlegally binding, the moral force of world opinion\r\nshould be respected and special monitoring should be\r\narranged by the Secretariat and reflected in the reports\r\nof the Secretary-General to the Assembly.\r\nTurning now to the agenda item on the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations system, we have\r\nsome preliminary remarks on the report of the\r\nSecretary-General concerning the recommendations of\r\nthe Panel of Eminent Persons on United Nations-Civil\r\nSociety Relations (A/59/354).\r\nWe wish to join in acknowledging the importance\r\nof engagement with civil society and the value of the\r\ncontributions of non-governmental organizations\r\n(NGOs) to United Nations activities. They have an\r\nimportant role to play in promoting the goals of the\r\nUnited Nations and in providing innovative ideas and\r\nexpertise, especially from those NGOs which have a\r\nspecialized focus. We are therefore in general support\r\nof enhancing their involvement.\r\nHaving said that, we have to be careful that in the\r\nprocess, we avoid compromising the intergovernmental\r\nnature of our Organization. In that context, we have\r\nconcerns about how NGO participation can be worked\r\nout in deliberations of the more political organs of the\r\nUnited Nations System.\r\nExperience has shown that in the area of\r\neconomic and social development the contribution of\r\nNGO participation has the greatest potential. However,\r\nsome problems have arisen in the Committee on\r\nNon-Governmental Organizations, because the levels\r\nof politicalization of its activities have given rise to\r\nsome concern. For that reason, we believe that in any\r\nnew initiatives for participation in the two major\r\npolitical organs there is need to proceed with caution.\r\nSensitive issues arise where political agendas are\r\npursued by certain NGOs which lead to complications\r\nin relation to the internal affairs of States.\r\nThe second area of concern is the issue of\r\ncompliance with the rules of engagement. The\r\nEconomic and Social Council has faced difficulties\r\nwith enforcement of the rules, especially where\r\npolitical encouragement is given to NGOs to agitate\r\nagainst Member States. This sometimes has proven to\r\nbe disruptive. These concerns led us to express some\r\nreservations with regard to the proposals concerning\r\nNGOs in relation to the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nIn our view, Sir, we should continue to develop\r\nthe programme for civil society participation in\r\nrelation to the activities of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and the related conferences of the United\r\nNations in which NGOs participation has been\r\nconstructive and valuable.\r\nUsing that approach, we are inclined to give\r\nsupport to the initiatives proposed in part VI of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/59/354) and to\r\nencourage more engagement with NGOs at the country\r\nlevel. That is an important means of promoting the\r\nobjectives of the United Nations, especially in\r\nachieving the social and economic objectives of the\r\nUnited Nations. We believe that is where the emphasis\r\nshould be placed at this time.\r\nFinally, with respect to partnerships, there are\r\nstill a number of questions which need clarification\r\nabout how partnerships are to be implemented. Those\r\nrelate principally to issues of process and\r\naccountability. It is not clear how they are to be\r\nmonitored in the intergovernmental context and we\r\nhave concerns how they will relate to the traditional\r\nchannels for development cooperation.\r\nThese are matters in which we expect to have\r\nfurther consultations conducted under your auspices.\r\nWe have confidence in your leadership in carrying\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nforward the process of reform and revitalization. You\r\ncan count on the full support and cooperation of the\r\ndelegation of Jamaica.\r\nMr. Rastam (Malaysia): I should like to\r\nassociate my delegation with the statement made by the\r\nPermanent Representative of Algeria on agenda item\r\n52 entitled “Revitalization of the work of the General\r\nAssembly”, in his capacity as coordinator of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM) working group on\r\nreform of the United Nations and revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI join him and other speakers in paying tribute to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte, President of the fifty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly, for his\r\nenergetic leadership on the issue of the revitalization of\r\nthe work of the General Assembly.\r\nWe now look towards your leadership and vision,\r\nSir, in bringing forward the ongoing process to which\r\nMr. Hunte had given great impetus and commitment.\r\nMy delegation stands ready to support you in your\r\nefforts.\r\nLeaders who spoke at the general debate over the\r\npast two weeks had overwhelmingly expressed their\r\nsupport for the need to reform the United Nations and\r\nstrengthen the Organization to enable it to face threats\r\nand challenges of the twenty-first century. Further to\r\nthe call for reform and the strengthening of the United\r\nNations, Member States have also raised questions\r\npertaining to the General Assembly and its role within\r\nthe framework of the United Nations system.\r\nThe role of the General Assembly has been\r\nclearly outlined in Chapter IV of the Charter. As\r\nreaffirmed in the Millennium Declaration, the General\r\nAssembly is the chief deliberative, policymaking and\r\nrepresentative body of the United Nations. The\r\nAssembly should be the true symbol of multilateralism\r\nthat embodies the set of ideals and principles which\r\nMember States depend upon.\r\nThe General Assembly has adopted resolutions\r\n58/126 and 58/316 as a means to revitalize the General\r\nAssembly, enhance its authority and role and improve\r\nits methods of work. Malaysia reaffirms its support for\r\nthe work done thus far. We concur with the points\r\nraised earlier by Algeria on how we should move\r\nforward. There is certainly an urgent need to ensure the\r\neffective, full and proper implementation of the two\r\nresolutions.\r\nIt is true that, prior to resolutions 58/126 and\r\n58/316, other resolutions to revitalize the General\r\nAssembly had been adopted and some improvements to\r\nthe workings of the General Assembly had been\r\nachieved. However, there are still many other areas that\r\nhave yet to be addressed. The key to success lies in the\r\nimplementation of those resolutions. That aspect\r\nshould be stressed above all else. A proper monitoring\r\nmechanism must be put in place to ensure that General\r\nAssembly resolutions are implemented. We must find\r\nways of ensuring that the Assembly’s decisions and\r\nrecommendations are pursued, complied with and\r\nsincerely and wholeheartedly implemented by all\r\nparties concerned. Sponsors of resolutions could play a\r\nmore responsible role in ensuring not only ownership,\r\nbut also follow-up, accountability and implementation.\r\nThe role of the Secretariat is also crucial in that regard.\r\nIn continuing our work on the process of\r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly, my delegation\r\nbelieves in the need to also focus on the following:\r\nstrengthening of the Office of the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly; improvement in the methods of\r\nwork; further rationalization of the agenda, resolutions\r\nand reports; and streamlining of the work of the main\r\nCommittees in keeping with the General Assembly\r\nrules of procedure.\r\nWith regard to agenda item 54, my delegation\r\nrecalls General Assembly resolution 58/269 of\r\n23 December 2003, regarding strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations, which focuses on improving the\r\nmethods of work and practices of the United Nations.\r\nWe believe that all Member States should continue to\r\nseriously look into the urgent implementation of the\r\nrecommendations made under that resolution,\r\nespecially on the full participation of the Member\r\nStates in the planning, programming and budgetary\r\nprocess of the United Nations.\r\nWe should emphasize here that the United\r\nNations system is essentially an intergovernmental\r\ninstitution. However, we note the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendations regarding the involvement of\r\nnon-governmental organizations on issues of mutual\r\ndialogue, as contained in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/59/354) in response to the report of the\r\nPanel of Eminent Persons on United Nations-Civil\r\nSociety Relations. We are willing to further examine\r\nthose recommendations with other delegations and the\r\nSecretariat.\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nMalaysia continues to fully subscribe to the\r\nposition of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) on the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations, as stated in the\r\nfinal document of the thirteenth NAM Summit, held in\r\nKuala Lumpur in February 2003, and the final\r\ndocument of the fourteenth Ministerial Conference of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, held in Durban in August\r\n2004. The issue is addressed in the NAM documents in\r\na more all-encompassing manner not restricted to\r\nquestions relating to the improvement of procedures\r\nand methods of work in the United Nations organs.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement is focused on the\r\nlarger picture of the need to reform and strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations system as a whole. It calls for a\r\ncomprehensive reform of all United Nations organs,\r\nincluding the General Assembly, the Security Council\r\nand the Economic and Social Council. This is in order\r\nto uphold the centrality of the United Nations in\r\ncurrent global affairs, as envisaged under the Charter,\r\nespecially in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security and in promoting international\r\ncooperation. This is even more relevant today in view\r\nof the many new challenges facing the Organization.\r\nMy delegation looks forward to the opportunity at this\r\nsession to further discuss the relevant issues relating to\r\nthis question.\r\nMr. Butagira (Uganda): Since I am taking the\r\nfloor for the first time at the fifty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, allow me, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Uganda and on my own\r\naccount, to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption\r\nof the presidency of this world Assembly. I have every\r\nconfidence in your proven skills and guidance.\r\nThe report of the Panel of Eminent Persons on\r\nUnited Nations-Civil Society Relations (A/58/817 and\r\nCorr.1) is thoughtful and contains good\r\nrecommendations. I congratulate the members of the\r\nPanel for work well done. I also congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General for his excellent report (A/59/354).\r\nTime does not permit me to give my detailed views on\r\nthese reports.\r\nNon-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the\r\nprivate sector generally play a vital role in forging\r\nuseful partnerships with Governments to realize\r\ndevelopment goals and other goals of the United\r\nNations, especially at the grass-roots level. However,\r\nas important as that role is, NGOs should not be\r\nelevated to the level of Governments. They are not\r\naccountable to the people, as responsible Governments\r\nare. Their mandate is, thus, limited in character. Their\r\nrole should be of a consultative nature. I therefore do\r\nnot accept the proposal by the Secretary-General to\r\ngive NGOs accreditation to directly participate in the\r\nsessions of the General Assembly. The General\r\nAssembly is a world inter-governmental parliament,\r\nand its members are duly accredited Government\r\ndelegations from Member States.\r\nThat said, the important role played by NGOs in\r\nadvancing the work of the United Nations can hardly\r\nbe overemphasized. At the country level, NGOs of\r\ndifferent categories play a useful role in realizing the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. They are engaged, for\r\ninstance, in providing safe drinking water, sanitation,\r\nhealth clinics, microcredit facilities to women, literacy\r\nand immunization campaigns, HIV/AIDS awareness\r\ncampaigns and humanitarian assistance, especially in\r\nwar-torn areas. I welcome the Panel’s recommendation\r\nof extending consultations at the country level.\r\nThrough workshops and other forums, NGOs can\r\nengage in dialogue with various United Nations\r\nagencies, coordinated by United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) Coordinators on the one hand and\r\nGovernments on the other. In this regard, the Panel’s\r\nrecommendation to strengthen the capacity of UNDP\r\nResident Coordinators to bolster the capacity of NGOs\r\nto render useful advisory services is welcome,\r\nespecially if they form advisory groups or committees.\r\nAt the General Assembly level, consultations and\r\ndialogue with civil society have often taken the form of\r\npanel and roundtable discussions, usually through the\r\nMain Committees or sessions of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and its functional Commissions. I\r\nwould propose, however, that a consultative forum be\r\ncreated in which Member States can interact with civil\r\nsociety on particular topics under consideration by the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the margins of Assembly\r\nsessions, rather than before the sessions begin, as is\r\nproposed by the Secretary-General. That would\r\nminimize the expense of hosting two consecutive\r\nsessions.\r\nI commend the Security Council for instituting a\r\ndialogue with civil society. Participation by civil\r\nsociety representatives in open debate on some issues\r\nhas made a useful contribution to the outcome of\r\nSecurity Council deliberations. However, there should\r\nbe clear guidelines regarding their participation. In\r\nparticular, their reports not only should be circulated to\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nmembers of the Security Council, but also should be\r\nmade available to other Member States, especially\r\nwhen a report makes allegations against a Member\r\nState in some way.\r\nLastly, I welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\ndecision to establish a trust fund to enhance the\r\ncapacity of non-governmental organizations at the\r\ncountry level to engage with Governments on issues\r\nregarding the work of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Gopala Menon (Singapore): At the outset, I\r\nwould like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption\r\nof the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nninth session and to reaffirm Singapore’s full support\r\nfor you. My predecessor worked with the last three\r\nPresidents of the Assembly as a facilitator in this area\r\nof work. Singapore has always tried to play a\r\nconstructive role in the ongoing deliberations on the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, and we will\r\ncontinue to do likewise at the current session.\r\nI was told that, last year, the question of the\r\nrelevance of the United Nations dominated many\r\ndiscussions, for reasons that are fully understandable. I\r\nam encouraged that that question no longer holds\r\ncentre stage and that the debate has moved on to how\r\nwe can best deal with the threats, challenges and\r\nchange with which we are confronted.\r\nFor small States like Singapore, the effectiveness\r\nand relevance of the United Nations are of paramount\r\nimportance. In that regard, the role of the General\r\nAssembly — as the principal norm-making organ of\r\nthe United Nations — cannot be overestimated. If we\r\nwere to take away the United Nations and its\r\nassociated framework of international law, a new world\r\norder would emerge based on the law of the jungle.\r\nThat kind of a world would be less favourable for\r\nmany countries.\r\nThe United Nations will soon be turning 60. In\r\nsome ways, it is an irony that United Nations\r\nHeadquarters is in New York. Here, amid gleaming\r\nultramodern buildings equipped with the latest\r\ntechnology, United Nations Headquarters is an antique\r\nthat does not even have a sprinkler system from the\r\nfourth floor upwards. If the chief executive officer of\r\none of the leading international companies based in\r\nNew York were to spend a short time with us as a\r\nrepresentative to experience how the United Nations\r\nworks, he or she would probably suffer a tremendous\r\nshock.\r\nAs with this building, with the passage of time\r\ncome other problems associated with ageing. Just as\r\nold equipment and systems are often jettisoned in\r\nfavour of new and better equipment, old ways of doing\r\nthings need to be constantly re-evaluated.\r\nUnfortunately, old habits die hard. Both the working\r\nmethods of the Assembly and the substance of our\r\ndiscussions can at times be disconnected from\r\ndevelopments in the real world outside, and that in turn\r\nraises questions about the relevance of the Assembly.\r\nNotwithstanding the inefficient way in which we\r\noften go about doing our business, Singapore is\r\nrealistic enough to recognize that the United Nations\r\ncannot simply jettison overnight the way in which it\r\noperates. A physical building can be refurbished or\r\neven completely rebuilt if its occupants can\r\ntemporarily relocate elsewhere. Unfortunately, in the\r\nwork of the Organization, we cannot call a time out to\r\noverhaul our working methods and then start anew on\r\nan entirely revamped way of working. Moreover,\r\nunlike the case of a business enterprise, where the\r\npower to make decisions resides in the top man or a\r\nfew top executives, the power to make decisions in the\r\nGeneral Assembly resides with its 191 sovereign\r\nMember States — a situation that is not always\r\nconducive to the taking of quick decisions. Since we\r\ncannot tear down the Assembly and rebuild it from\r\nscratch, we can renovate it room by room, consulting\r\nand trying to achieve an agreement among its 191 co-\r\nowners, even as we continue with our work. That is the\r\nonly realistic way to proceed with revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and, for that matter, with any other\r\naspect of United Nations reform.\r\nToo often, we hear the complaint that the locus of\r\npower and decision-making has shifted in the past 10\r\nto 15 years from the Assembly to the Security Council.\r\nIn that regard, it might be useful to recall that, unlike\r\nthe case of the League of Nations, the architects of the\r\nUnited Nations deliberately set out to differentiate the\r\nfunctions of the Assembly from those of the Security\r\nCouncil. As the chairman of the responsible committee\r\nat the San Francisco Conference asserted in 1945:\r\n“The strength of the future world Organization\r\nrests on perfect equilibrium between the\r\nfunctions of the Assembly and those of the\r\nSecurity Council. Neither of these two bodies\r\nshould try to dominate the other nor trespass on\r\nthe other’s peculiar sphere of activities and\r\nresponsibilities ... The Assembly, as the supreme\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nrepresentative body of the world, is to establish\r\nthe principles on which world peace and the ideal\r\nof solidarity must rest; and, on the other hand, the\r\nSecurity Council is to act in accordance with\r\nthose principles and with the speed necessary to\r\nprevent any attempted breach of international\r\npeace and security. In other words, the former\r\n[the Assembly] is a creative body and the latter\r\n[the Security Council] an organ of action.”\r\nBut, in fact, from the very inception of the United\r\nNations, there was a breakdown of this concept of\r\nspecialization, with the General Assembly encroaching\r\non the Security Council’s peculiar sphere. That was\r\nlargely the result of the cold war, which often\r\nparalysed decision-making in the Security Council,\r\nresulting in almost every major political problem being\r\ntransferred to and deliberated in the Assembly. Some\r\nof us might view that period — stretching from the\r\nbirth of the United Nations up to the 1990s — as the\r\nglory days of the General Assembly, but that was not\r\nhow things were meant to be. Hence, the end of the\r\ncold war was a rude awakening for some of us. That\r\ndoes not mean that the Assembly must now settle for a\r\nlesser role than that of the Council. But it does mean at\r\nleast three things.\r\nFirst, it is important that the Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council work in tandem, not at cross-\r\npurposes. We cannot have the two co-pilots of an\r\naircraft trying to take it in different directions. That\r\nwould be disastrous for all of us. When decisions are\r\ntaken by the Security Council or by the General\r\nAssembly — especially by consensus — we should\r\nlook for ways to reaffirm that position in other organs\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nSecondly, so that the General Assembly flag can\r\nfly high, the Assembly should identify niche areas or\r\nissues on which it can make a significant contribution.\r\nOf course, that is easier said than done, but there are\r\nglobal problems or clusters of issues such as infectious\r\ndiseases, illegal migration, the environment, terrorism\r\nand human rights — just to name a few — on which\r\nthe views of the entire membership could be brought to\r\nbear in shaping international opinion and positions.\r\nHere, I am confident that everyone — including the\r\nmajor Powers — would deem it in their interests to\r\npromote a major role for the General Assembly. The\r\nfact is that globalization has also globalized the\r\nproblems of poverty, terrorism and disease, and it will\r\nbe not only the poor and small countries that will\r\nsuffer. If the sense of injustice and unfairness becomes\r\ntoo great, the problems of the Third World will become\r\nthose of the First World in one way or another. So we\r\nhave no choice but to work together. What better forum\r\nto use than the Assembly, where almost every country\r\nin today’s world is represented?\r\nThirdly, I see two impediments preventing the\r\nGeneral Assembly from moving towards dealing with\r\nniches of common concern: its bloated agenda and its\r\nculture of rituals, which place heavy demands on our\r\ntime and resources without significant results.\r\nWith regard to the first impediment, I am not sure\r\nhow many more inches we can trim from the\r\nAssembly’s waistline. Every agenda item represents\r\nthe vested interest of a Member State or group of\r\nMember States, and that includes both developed and\r\ndeveloping countries. How much longer they remain on\r\nthe Assembly’s agenda will depend on whether we can\r\nultimately achieve a satisfactory resolution of the\r\nissues and conflicts, some of which are as old as the\r\nUnited Nations itself. Nevertheless, I hope that,\r\nthrough a spirit of compromise, we can further lighten\r\nour workload.\r\nWe should also shake up the annual high-level\r\ngeneral debate, which has settled into a two-week ritual\r\nthat cannot sustain international media attention. In\r\nthat regard, I would like to draw particular attention to\r\nthe recommendation in resolution 58/126 that the\r\nPresident-elect of the General Assembly, in\r\nconsultation with the incumbent President and the\r\nSecretary-General, suggest a theme or issue of global\r\nconcern for Member States to comment upon during\r\nthe general debate at the start of each session. If we\r\ncan get our leaders to focus their speeches on the\r\nimportant issues of the day, we may be better able to\r\nmobilize the Assembly to serve as a court of\r\ninternational opinion.\r\nIn summary, we will need to constantly identify\r\nways in which to make the Assembly the creative body\r\nthat the architects of the United Nations set out to\r\nmake in San Francisco in 1945. To do that, we must be\r\naudacious but realistic in our approach.\r\nI would next like to briefly address the issue of\r\nexpanding United Nations-civil society relations. The\r\ntwo reports prepared on this topic — the report of the\r\nSecretary-General (A/59/354) and the report of the\r\nPanel of Eminent Persons (A/58/817 and Corr.1) —\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nprovide much food for thought. I would like to make\r\nfour preliminary observations.\r\nFirst, Singapore agrees in principle that the\r\nUnited Nations should be a forward-looking\r\norganization and that there is merit in the United\r\nNations expanding its consultations with different\r\nconstituencies, including non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs). We agree that certain NGOs\r\nhave expertise in specific areas of our work, for\r\nexample on environmental, human rights, disarmament\r\nand development issues. They have often contributed\r\nto a better understanding of complex issues and have\r\nadded to the richness of our debates. However, it is\r\nalso a fact that there are NGOs that do not add any real\r\nvalue to the work of the United Nations. Judging from\r\npast experience, it would be difficult for us to\r\ndifferentiate between NGOs that can add value to our\r\ndeliberations and those that cannot.\r\nSecondly, it follows that we need to ask how best\r\nto involve NGOs in our deliberations. In that regard,\r\nthe proposal to accredit NGOs to the Main Committees\r\nof the General Assembly needs careful consideration.\r\nWe have to bear in mind that once we embark on that\r\ncourse, it would be difficult to reverse the situation. As\r\nthe representative of Australia pointed out in his\r\nstatement earlier today, while a greater dialogue with\r\nNGOs may be of value, it should not detract from the\r\nfundamental intergovernmental character of the\r\nAssembly. Whatever we do, we must ensure that the\r\ndecisions of the United Nations are made by Member\r\nStates and not by NGOs.\r\nThirdly, I submit that, notwithstanding the\r\nfinancial support envisaged by the Secretary-General\r\nfor NGOs from developing countries, the playing field\r\nwill not necessarily be level. What guarantee is there\r\nthat the trust fund will not dry up after an initial phase,\r\nand with it access for NGOs from developing countries\r\nto attend United Nations meetings? Regarding the\r\nenlargement of the Partnerships Office, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has pointed out that it would have modest\r\nbudgetary implications. In this day and age of\r\ncompeting mandates and finite resources, something\r\nwould have to give. Who would then decide what is to\r\ngo and what will stay?\r\nFourthly, based on Singapore’s experience,\r\nespecially during our stint on the Security Council, I\r\nsubmit that the NGOs that matter often know whom to\r\nwork with and how to get their viewpoints across. We\r\nhad good working relations with a wide range of NGOs\r\nthat added value to the work of the Security Council. In\r\na way, that automatically separates the wheat from the\r\nchaff. Even as we look for ways to help NGOs gain\r\nbetter access to our deliberations, we should not\r\nneglect to provide similar assistance to Member States\r\nthat need it in order to better participate in the work of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, it is important to address some of\r\nthese questions and concerns and to examine carefully\r\nthe implications of the Cardoso Panel’s proposals\r\nbefore taking any action.\r\nMr. Requeijo Gual (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nFirst, I extend to you, Sir, my delegation’s satisfaction\r\nat seeing you presiding over this meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to consider two items of great\r\nimportance.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of Algeria on behalf of the\r\ncountries of the Non-Aligned Movement. We would\r\nlike to add some comments to complement that\r\nstatement.\r\nWe must undertake without further delay a\r\ngenuine reform of the United Nations that restores its\r\noriginal roots and ensures proper respect for the\r\nCharter by all Member States, large and small. The\r\nstrengthening and the reform of the United Nations\r\nshould have the goal of restoring the Organization’s\r\ncentral position in the system of international relations,\r\nensuring the rule of international law and the United\r\nNations Charter, rebuilding the system of collective\r\nsecurity and ensuring the development of\r\nmultilateralism and cooperation among States.\r\nMultilateralism should not be reinterpreted by\r\nsome in a capricious and opportunistic manner. Rather,\r\nit should be defended by all Member States, because\r\nmultilateralism depends on full respect for\r\ninternational law and the practice of democracy in\r\ninternational relations. It is becoming increasingly\r\nclear that if we want to restore the international\r\ncommunity’s confidence in the United Nations and, in\r\nparticular, to restore the Organization’s credibility\r\nbefore international public opinion, we must ensure\r\nthat the Organization truly acts in the collective\r\ninterest of its Member States.\r\nUnited Nations reform should be general and\r\ncomprehensive. It should encompass and democratize\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nall the principal and subsidiary organs. The main pillar\r\nof reform should be the preservation of the universal,\r\ndemocratic and intergovernmental character of the\r\nOrganization. In that context, it is necessary to respect\r\nthe functions and the prerogatives that the Charter\r\nentrusts respectively to the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council\r\nfor the purposes stated in the Charter. Interference by\r\nthe Security Council in the areas of competence of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil should come to an end. Now more than ever,\r\nthe Security Council requires thorough reform,\r\nincluding its urgent democratization.\r\nAs well, the political issues of the Organization,\r\nincluding the issue of reform itself, should not be\r\nsubordinated to management and administrative\r\nconcepts.\r\nLikewise, we should not subordinate the political\r\nissues of the Organization, including this very exercise,\r\nto their managerial and administrative aspects. The\r\nimplementation of a transnational corporation approach\r\nwith a narrow cost-benefit criterion contradicts the\r\nvery nature of the Organization, given its universal and\r\ndemocratic character, its political essence and\r\nintergovernmental aspect.\r\nIn this regard, Sir, I wish briefly to refer to the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General submitted in response\r\nto the report of the Panel of Eminent Persons on United\r\nNations-Civil Society Relations under the item\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations system”.\r\nThis document should be carefully examined by\r\nMember States, since the initiatives set forth in it could\r\nhave enormous impact on the intergovernmental nature\r\nof the United Nations, as well as on the original\r\nmandates of the system’s funds, agencies and\r\nprogrammes. Although some proposals found in the\r\ntext could have a positive effect on the work of the\r\nOrganization, for instance that of urging other\r\nagencies, such as the Bretton Woods institutions, to\r\npromote greater participation of civil society in their\r\nactivities, other proposals have to do with budgets,\r\nconcepts and methodologies that are very far from\r\nenjoying intergovernmental consensus.\r\nThis is the reason why the implementation of any\r\nof the initiatives outlined in the report of the Secretary\r\nGeneral will require a clear legislative mandate by\r\nMember States.\r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly also\r\nconstitutes a determining element within the real\r\nreform of the United Nations. We cannot speak of an\r\nOrganization able to act more democratically and\r\neffectively, as long as the General Assembly does not\r\nfully exercise the powers entrusted to it by the Charter.\r\nThose include the powers that necessarily should\r\nderive from the Charter in the event of a stalemate\r\nwhere the Security Council fails to reject the use of\r\nforce for political ends, and where it does not insist on\r\nthe peaceful resolution of conflicts and the elimination\r\nof double standards in order to achieve security,\r\nstability, justice and democracy in the world.\r\nResolutions 58/126 and 58/316, adopted during\r\nthe previous session of the General Assembly under the\r\nleadership of President Julian Hunte, add to the\r\nlegislative arsenal needed for the revitalization of this\r\nmain body. Hence, all the relevant resolutions that have\r\nalready been adopted continue to be mandatory points\r\nof reference.\r\nThe revitalization process should have as its final\r\ngoal the reaffirmation of the central role of the General\r\nAssembly as the main body for deliberation and the\r\nadoption of policies, and for representation within the\r\nUnited Nations, as acknowledged in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nThus, this Assembly should maintain its\r\nindependent nature and role in this process as a forum\r\nfor wide-ranging debate, where Member States are not\r\nrestricted or limited when referring to the issues that\r\nare of interest to them. The executive capacity of the\r\nGeneral Assembly should not be weakened either.\r\nThis is why, in our opinion, during the current\r\nsession and under your leadership, Mr. President, we\r\nfeel that we should give priority to the component of\r\nrevitalization aimed at consolidating the authority of\r\nthis Assembly. Resolution 58/126 itself includes, in\r\nsection “A” of its annex, measures whose full and\r\nurgent implementation would allow such consolidation.\r\nAt the same time, actions aimed at improving the\r\nworking methods of the Assembly should not erode,\r\nbut rather complement, efforts to restore its basic role.\r\nWe should take this into account when implementing\r\nrelevant resolutions, including resolutions 58/126 and\r\n58/316. We should also remember that no improvement\r\nin structure or function can compensate for the lack of\r\npolitical will of powerful States or the pernicious\r\ntendency towards unilateralism.\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nThe United Nations agenda is in itself a political\r\nmatter and the issues currently covered just at the\r\nplenary level have essential importance and sensitivity\r\nfor most Member States. Thus, the rationalization of\r\nthe choice of agenda items should not be based upon\r\nadministrative or financial considerations. It must be a\r\npatient and democratic process of seeking consensus,\r\nwhich implies respect for the opinion of all Member\r\nStates, especially of those most concerned and without\r\nwhose approval no proposal for reorganization or\r\nimprovement on a given item should be made at all.\r\nThe right of States to propose, in accordance with\r\nthe rules of procedure and the Charter of the United\r\nNations, the inclusion of new items in the agenda of\r\nthe General Assembly, as well as their consideration in\r\nthe necessary way and at the appropriate time, should\r\nnot be affected either.\r\nIn quite a few cases, the continued existence of\r\ncertain agenda items is mainly due to the fact that the\r\nrelevant resolutions have not been implemented.\r\nFurthermore, it is worth remembering that the General\r\nAssembly is not the only main body with numerous\r\nagenda items. In fact, we have witnessed how the\r\nSecurity Council increases the number of agenda items\r\nit covers each year.\r\nWe also recall that the so-called\r\nconceptualization of the agenda, which has already\r\nbeen instituted, must not prejudge or influence the way\r\nthe work of the General Assembly is organized or\r\nundertaken.\r\nLikewise, efforts to revitalize the work of the\r\nAssembly’s General Committee should be framed\r\nwithin the prerogatives assigned to it, pursuant to the\r\nRules of Procedure of the General Assembly.\r\nActions aimed at revitalizing specifically the\r\nwork of the Main Committees should comply with the\r\ngeneral guidelines established at the plenary level,\r\nafter a comprehensive consultation process among\r\nMember States.\r\nIn this regard, the recommendations to improve\r\nthe working methods of the Main Committees,\r\nincluding recommendations for streamlining their\r\nrespective working programmes, should also be based\r\non comprehensive consultations and consensus. Such a\r\nprocess should be undertaken without detriment to\r\ncurrent priorities and without neglecting traditional\r\nsubstantive issues.\r\nWe consider that the interpretation and\r\nimplementation of resolutions 58/126 and 58/316\r\nshould not, by any means, limit the activity or impose\r\nconditions on the political debate or the ability of\r\nMember States to present initiatives within the Main\r\nCommittees. Nor should we underestimate the value of\r\nthe viewpoints of the smallest delegations, which are\r\noften unable to participate actively in all the segments,\r\ninteractive debates and other meetings that may be\r\nscheduled in such subsidiary organs of the Assembly.\r\nLikewise, we must not forget that the new\r\ninitiatives of Assembly presidents and bureaux could\r\nset precedents for all the Main Committees and even\r\nfor the plenary of the Assembly itself. Therefore, the\r\npresentation of such organizational initiatives should\r\nbe an extremely careful exercise because of the\r\nimplications that might be involved, including possible\r\nincongruities and contradictions with the very rules of\r\nprocedure of the General Assembly. In our opinion, the\r\nso-called gradual implementation of new\r\norganizational measures in the Committees should not\r\ntake place until there is a clear, negotiated\r\ngovernmental mandate on that issue.\r\nLet us not deceive ourselves: the effectiveness of\r\nthe work of the plenary and of the Committees will\r\ndepend more on the political will of Member States\r\nthan on changes in the working methods of the plenary\r\nand the Committees. In any case, they should not affect\r\nthe mandates and priorities established in the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, the outcomes of the\r\nspecial sessions of the Assembly and of United Nations\r\nconferences and summits or the priorities contained in\r\nthe medium-term plan.\r\nIn our opinion, the main problem currently lies in\r\nthe lack of implementation of the many resolutions that\r\nthe General Assembly has adopted, which constitute an\r\nimportant normative body but remain inert because\r\ntheir implementation depends on the political will of\r\nthose States that have the political, military or\r\neconomic power to do so. It seems normal, then, that\r\nthat also happens with the many resolutions on United\r\nNations reform, whose level of implementation is\r\nlimited. However, with total realism, the General\r\nAssembly can set for itself the task of debating crucial\r\nand urgent international issues in order to adopt\r\nconcrete, action-oriented resolutions.\r\nFinally, my delegation reiterates that reform\r\ncannot be a merely bureaucratic process of adapting\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nwhat is left of the United Nations to the interests and\r\nwhims of a few rich and powerful countries. Likewise,\r\nwe hope that, as a result of this process, the interaction\r\nbetween the Secretariat and the General Assembly will\r\nbe strengthened so that the former may respond more\r\neffectively to the mandates determined by Member\r\nStates.\r\nI conclude my statement, Mr. President, by\r\nwishing you every success in your work and reiterating\r\nthat, in this complex but necessary process of\r\nreforming the Organization, you can count on the full\r\navailability and constructive participation of the\r\ndelegation of Cuba.\r\nMr. Balestra (San Marino): As this is the first\r\ntime that I am taking the floor at the fifty-ninth session\r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to congratulate you,\r\nMr. President, on your election and reaffirm to you the\r\nfull support of my country and my delegation.\r\nSan Marino has always considered the\r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly to\r\nbe an imperative. The General Assembly, as the main\r\norgan of the United Nations, should remain the main\r\nforum for the international community to discuss\r\nrelevant political issues. The international system has\r\nalready established a wide range of technical and\r\npolitical organs to discuss issues that need expert\r\nattention.\r\nThe General Assembly’s composition and the role\r\nit plays make it a unique organ of the United Nations.\r\nThose characteristics are the basis of its particular\r\nlegitimacy, enabling it, on many issues in international\r\npolitics, to obtain a global consensus that might hardly\r\nbe attainable in other forums. The first objective of an\r\norgan with the characteristics of the General Assembly\r\nmust be to make States feel that they are part of a\r\nglobal community, at least on major issues. To\r\naccomplish that function, the General Assembly should\r\ncooperate more frequently and constructively with\r\nother international actors, such as non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nFor that reason, my country welcomes the report\r\nof the Panel of Eminent Persons on United Nations-\r\nCivil Society Relations (A/58/817 and Corr.1) and\r\nthanks the Deputy Secretary-General for her\r\npresentation of the report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/59/354) in response to it. Civil society and other\r\nstakeholders should be given more opportunities to\r\nexpress their views. Their comments and suggestions\r\nwould represent an essential contribution to the\r\nAssembly’s work.\r\nSan Marino believes that the General Assembly\r\nshould develop its mandate effectively through the\r\nstreamlining of the agenda and the limitation of the\r\nnumber of items in order to consider them in a deeper\r\nand more reflective manner. Limiting the number of\r\nissues does not mean to deprive the General Assembly\r\nof its power. On the contrary, it would all the Assembly\r\nto focus on its priorities as stated in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nThe Main Committees themselves would benefit\r\nfrom such a reduction, giving them the opportunity to\r\nconcentrate on specific issues and adopt more incisive\r\nresolutions.\r\nMy delegation welcomes resolution 58/316. We\r\nare in favour of a great number of the points contained\r\nin it: in particular that of normally holding the\r\nmeetings of the plenary session on Mondays and\r\nThursdays; organizing the agenda under headings\r\ncorresponding to the priorities of the Organization in\r\norder to give a sense of structure to the work of the\r\nAssembly; biennializing and triennializing the agenda\r\nitems; rationalizing the work of the Main Committees\r\nand reducing the volume of documentation submitted\r\nby the Secretariat.\r\nNevertheless, we believe that the resolutions\r\nadopted to date represent merely a first step in the\r\nrevitalization process. In our opinion, the General\r\nCommittee should be strengthened in such a way as to\r\nbecome an effective means of facilitating the work of\r\nthe Assembly. It should play an important role in\r\ndetermining how to reduce the number of agenda\r\nitems, suggest alternative ways to discuss them and, in\r\nparticular, be used as an instrument for involving all\r\ndelegations in informal negotiations.\r\nWe also believe that the implementation of\r\nresolutions should become even more important than\r\ntheir adoption. We deem it vital to create a system by\r\nwhich the General Assembly is informed of the degree\r\nof implementation and impact of its resolutions. With\r\nsuch a system, we might be able to avoid adopting the\r\nsame resolutions over and over again.\r\nMr. Sharma (India): We are pleased to\r\nparticipate in this joint debate on the revitalization of\r\nthe work of the General Assembly and the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations system. We thank\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nthe Secretary-General for the detailed documentation\r\npresented under the two agenda items. We express our\r\nappreciation for the introductory statement made by the\r\nDeputy Secretary-General, Ms. Louise Fréchette.\r\nThe position of the Non-Aligned Movement has\r\nalready been outlined by Algeria. We would like to\r\nfocus on some of the broader issues surrounding the\r\ntwo agenda items.\r\nMy delegation congratulates you, Mr. President,\r\non the commitment that you bring to the process of the\r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly and\r\nthe strengthening of the United Nations system. We\r\nwould like to place on record our appreciation for the\r\npositive strides made on those issues under the\r\nleadership of the President of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-eighth session. We will work constructively\r\nwith you, Mr. President, and we wish you every\r\nsuccess in your endeavours in that regard.\r\nThe process of reform and revitalization is\r\nnecessarily a slow and measured one; we cannot expect\r\nresults overnight. We need patience and perseverance\r\nin our efforts to build agreement among all Member\r\nStates on issues that often involve sensitive political\r\nquestions. The strong, steady and purposeful forward\r\nmovement of a ship perhaps characterizes the approach\r\nthat we need to adopt in this process.\r\nWe made considerable progress in the previous\r\nsession, which involved several rounds of consultations\r\nand informal discussions. Progress was made in\r\ncategorizing items under broad headings, in\r\nstreamlining to some extent the work of the Main\r\nCommittees of the General Assembly and in the\r\nbiennialization, triennialization, clustering and\r\nelimination of items of the agenda of the General\r\nAssembly. Resolutions 58/126 and 58/316, adopted by\r\nthe General Assembly in December 2003 and July\r\n2004, respectively, contain some important steps\r\nforward.\r\nWe recognize, however, that those steps are\r\nessentially the first steps. The ultimate objective of the\r\nreform process is to enhance the effectiveness of the\r\nOrganization in its responsiveness to the needs of\r\nMember States, especially developing countries. The\r\nprogress in attempts to reform and revitalize the United\r\nNations system will be judged by its adaptation to the\r\nefforts of developing countries to achieve the targets\r\nset out in the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nSimultaneously, the reform process will be judged by\r\nthe effectiveness of the response of the United Nations\r\nto the global challenges posed by the threats of\r\ninternational terrorism; weapons of mass destruction,\r\nincluding the question of nuclear proliferation and\r\ndisarmament; and transnational organized crime,\r\ninvolving the trafficking in narcotics, weapons and\r\nhuman persons.\r\nWe have a long way ahead of us in reaching our\r\nobjective. We hope that the High-Level Panel set up by\r\nthe Secretary-General to report on the threats and\r\nchallenges faced by the United Nations and the\r\nchanges necessary in its institutions and processes, will\r\nproduce recommendations that we are able to\r\nimplement. We hope that the intergovernmental\r\nconsideration of the recommendations of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the Panel’s report will give us the\r\nopportunity to view the process in a holistic manner,\r\nthereby enabling us to make reforms in various parts of\r\nthe United Nations system. In the long term, the\r\nreforms will be enduring if the different elements of\r\nthe processes move in the same direction.\r\nThe reform process that we are attempting to\r\nestablish must eventually enhance the prestige,\r\nauthority and effectiveness of the General Assembly\r\nand its ability to deliberate on and review policy. That\r\nwill have to be done in practice, through concrete\r\naction. As an important first step, the restoration of the\r\nprestige and effectiveness of the General Assembly\r\ncould be brought about by returning the thematic\r\ndebates currently being held in the Security Council to\r\nthe General Assembly, where they rightly belong.\r\nMembers of the Security Council belonging to the\r\nGroup of 77 or sympathetic to the views of the vast\r\nmajority of the developing countries concerning the\r\nprimacy of the General Assembly have a major role to\r\nplay in that respect. The terms of interaction between\r\nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil operate without difficulties. But consideration\r\nwould have to be given to the occasional anomalies\r\nthat arise in the relationship between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council. The Office of the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly has, over the last\r\nyear, been strengthened with additional manpower, and\r\nit would be useful to review the contribution that has\r\nbeen made to the working of that Office. Similarly, an\r\nevaluation of the functioning of the General Assembly\r\nfollowing the many innovative changes brought about\r\nsince the beginning of this session would be a useful\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nexercise and would help us choose the direction for the\r\nfuture.\r\nThe volume of paper in the United Nations has\r\nbeen notorious indeed. Those who have come to cope\r\nwith the enormous quantities of documents and\r\nresolutions, with only a few people at their disposal in\r\ntheir missions, can best testify to the strangulating\r\neffect that the paperwork can impose. Even larger\r\nmissions find it difficult to keep abreast of the\r\ndocumentation. The documents are crisper now, but the\r\nSecretariat needs to continue focusing on making\r\ndocumentation more manageable and user-friendly.\r\nRationalization and simplification of the language\r\nused in the resolutions would also be useful.\r\nRationalization of the language or of the number of\r\nresolutions will, of course, be possible only with the\r\ncooperation of Member States.\r\nIt is important in the process of reform not to\r\noverlook the rules of procedure already adopted and\r\navailable to us. The strict observance of the rules of\r\nprocedure should not be compromised in the\r\nrevitalization process. It is also essential to remember\r\nthe intergovernmental character of the Organization.\r\nInteractions with civil society or other outside bodies\r\nundertaken for making the proceedings more broad-\r\nbased should be done only within the framework of\r\nassisting the intergovernmental deliberations and with\r\nthe objective of increasing the quality of\r\nintergovernmental decision-making.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his report in\r\nresponse to the report of the Panel of Eminent Persons\r\non United Nations-Civil Society Relations (A/59/354).\r\nAs the report of the Secretary-General has become\r\navailable only very recently, my delegation has not had\r\nsufficient time to reflect on the proposals made by the\r\nSecretary-General. We would, therefore, wish to\r\nexpress our preliminary views on the subject.\r\nOur consideration of the recommendations of the\r\nCardoso Panel and the report of the Secretary-General\r\non the work of the Panel is complicated by ambiguity\r\non the definition of civil society, in the report. The\r\ndefinition used by the Panel is at some variance with\r\nthe elements of civil society identified earlier by the\r\nSecretary-General and with what has come to be\r\ncommonly understood by the term.\r\nWe do not believe that parliamentarians form a\r\npart of civil society; nevertheless, the proposal to\r\nengage parliamentarians in a more intensive manner in\r\nthe work of the United Nations is welcome. Their\r\nsustained interaction and association with issues of\r\nglobal significance can only help in improving\r\nlegislation and implementation of policies within their\r\nown countries. The idea of local authorities being a\r\npart of civil society is incongruous by any standard.\r\nWhile local authorities are a key element in\r\nimplementation, they can hardly be identified as civil\r\nsociety.\r\nThe proposal to establish a trust fund to increase\r\nthe participation of representatives of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs) from developing\r\ncountries has considerable merit and deserves further\r\nconsideration. The sustained efforts of the United\r\nNations system have resulted in significant increases in\r\nthe number of participating NGOs from developing\r\ncountries in recent years. The situation still needs\r\nfurther improvement. The creation of a trust fund will\r\nbe a positive contribution to the process. However,\r\nclear criteria in establishing the trust fund, particularly\r\nwith regard to donations that are unconditional in\r\nnature, will be important for its success.\r\nWe wish to address in greater detail two\r\nimportant issues discussed in the report. The first is the\r\nparticipation of non-governmental organizations in the\r\nwork of the General Assembly. Although the\r\nSecretary-General states that “There is considerable\r\nmerit in opening the regular work of the Assembly to\r\nincreased participation by accredited NGOs”\r\n(A/59/354, para. 25), a convincing case has not been\r\nmade for that. The nature of the participation and the\r\nbenefits to be derived from it are not apparent, and we\r\nare not persuaded that it would benefit the United\r\nNations or its Member States. It would also militate\r\nagainst both the intergovernmental principle and the\r\nprinciple of democratic representation, since civil-\r\nsociety NGOs, in strict meaning of the term, have not\r\nbeen elected.\r\nFurther, the interpretation that there is nothing in\r\nArticle 71 of the United Nations Charter that would\r\npreclude the General Assembly from inviting non-\r\ngovernmental organizations to participate in its\r\nsessions is a disingenuous legal interpretation, which\r\nseems to be part of a growing trend.\r\nIn our view, the provisions of the Charter and its\r\nArticle 71 are very clear. The Charter, through Article\r\n71, determines that the principal relationship between\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nthe United Nations and civil society will be through the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. We would be hesitant to\r\ntamper with the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nwould caution against its fallacious interpretation for\r\nthe sake of convenience or expediency.\r\nThe second issue which merits comment is the\r\ngranting of accreditation to non-governmental\r\norganizations. The Secretary-General suggests that the\r\nGeneral Committee of the General Assembly could be\r\ndesignated for the accreditation process for\r\napplications for consultative status. In our\r\nunderstanding, that would only be applicable if non-\r\ngovernmental organizations were to participate in the\r\nwork of the General Assembly.\r\nThe Secretary-General refers to the comments of\r\nthe Panel of Eminent Persons on United Nations-Civil\r\nSociety Relations concerning the work of the\r\nCommittee on Non-Governmental Organizations. The\r\ncomments of the Panel are somewhat disappointing in\r\nregard to the work of the Committee on\r\nNon-Governmental Organizations. The question has\r\nbeen dealt with at a superficial level. There was a lack\r\nof adequate consultations with members of the\r\nCommittee, resulting in a lack of understanding of the\r\nwork of the Committee, and with the wider community\r\nof Member States on the usefulness of the Committee’s\r\nwork. That is indeed regrettable as the opportunity to\r\nmake meaningful proposals to reform and streamline\r\nthe work of the Committee on Non-Governmental\r\nOrganizations for further improving the accreditation\r\nprocess of non-governmental organizations has been\r\nlost.\r\nSeveral proposals are discussed in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report with regard to country-level\r\nengagement with non-governmental organizations. Due\r\ndiligence must be exercised to ensure that the mandates\r\nof the various United Nations bodies are not exceeded.\r\nNor should we lose sight of the fact that Governments\r\nare the main interlocutors of the United Nations system\r\nat the country level.\r\nWe shall provide more details of our views on the\r\nreports of the Secretary-General and the Cardoso Panel\r\nduring further discussions.\r\nMr. Chidyausiku (Zimbabwe): I take the floor to\r\naddress the Report of the Secretary-General in\r\nresponse to the report of the Panel of Eminent Persons\r\non United Nations-Civil Society Relations (A/59/354)\r\nunder agenda item 54, entitled “Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations system”. Allow me to commend the\r\nSecretary-General for the report before us, and to thank\r\nthe Deputy Secretary-General for introducing it.\r\nWith regard to agenda item 52, my delegation\r\nfully subscribes to the statement made by Algeria on\r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, of which we are\r\na member.\r\nAt the outset, let me indicate that my delegation\r\nagrees with the Secretary-General when he stresses that\r\n“The United Nations is and will remain an\r\nintergovernmental organization at which decisions are\r\ntaken by its Member States” (A/59/354, para. 3).\r\nAt the United Nations, Governments represent\r\ntheir constituencies, which include civil society, and\r\nwe are mandated by them to take decisions on their\r\nbehalf. The ongoing debate about enhancing the role of\r\ncivil society in the work of the United Nations\r\nunfortunately suggests that national Governments are\r\nnot representative enough and that civil society takes\r\nup the unfulfilled part of the mandate. Assuming that\r\nany gaps in representation exist, what needs to be done\r\nis to strengthen consultations at the national level.\r\nWhatever measures are taken in the ongoing process of\r\nthe modernization and the institutional change of the\r\nUnited Nations should therefore ensure that its\r\nessential character as an intergovernmental\r\norganization is maintained.\r\nRegrettably, over the years, there has been a\r\ngrowing and determined tendency to undermine that\r\nposition. We have witnessed numerous attempts to\r\nchange or seek ways to circumvent the established\r\nrules of procedure of the Assembly and of other\r\nintergovernmental processes in favour of civil society,\r\neven before the need to do so has been established. In\r\nsome cases, progress in deliberative processes had been\r\nthreatened, as some delegations and groups have\r\ninsisted on a kind of inclusiveness that had not been\r\npreviously agreed upon. It is our hope that this debate\r\nwill clarify the intergovernmental nature of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn the past, non-governmental and other civil\r\nsociety organizations have participated in the work of\r\nthe General Assembly in a variety of ways, such as\r\nduring special sessions, round-table meetings and\r\npreparatory processes for international conferences.\r\nHowever, the practice has been that they do not\r\nparticipate in plenary meetings of the Assembly. We\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nhave not been provided with any compelling reasons\r\nwhy that practice should change.\r\nThe report recognizes that civil society\r\norganizations in different parts of the world are at\r\ndifferent levels of development and that something\r\nneeds to be done to bridge the gap. In this regard, we\r\nwelcome the intention of the Secretary-General to\r\ncreate a trust fund to facilitate the participation of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs) from developing\r\ncountries in intergovernmental meetings, in the hope\r\nthat that would make a difference. According to the\r\nreport, 70 per cent of NGOs having consultative status\r\nwith the Economic and Social Council come from\r\ndeveloped countries, while the remaining 30 per cent\r\nhave their headquarters in developing countries. Under\r\nthose circumstances, the calls to increase NGO\r\nparticipation in intergovernmental processes\r\nunfortunately translate into demands for an increase in\r\nthe voice of the developed world. Evidently, this issue\r\nneeds to be properly thought through, as it has\r\nramifications for the issue of democracy in\r\ninternational governance.\r\nOn the question of accreditation, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has acknowledged the work done by the\r\nCommittee on Non-Governmental Organizations to\r\nimprove its efficiency, including through the\r\nintroduction of a paperless committee. We therefore\r\nfind the reasons put forward for disbanding the\r\nCommittee unconvincing. In addition to granting\r\ncertain defined rights to approved organizations, the\r\nCommittee is an indispensable tool that serves to\r\nensure that those organizations recognize their\r\nresponsibilities and are held accountable for their\r\nactions. We also wish to observe that the whole process\r\nof accreditation, including the so-called pre-screening\r\nof applications, must remain the responsibility of\r\nMember States.\r\nThe report speaks of the need to enhance country-\r\nlevel engagement with NGOs and to enhance the\r\ncapacity of NGOs at the same level. There is merit in\r\nthat proposal, particularly with regard to the capacity\r\nof NGOs in developing countries. However, it should\r\nbe made clear that such engagement and capacity-\r\nbuilding should be done only with the full involvement\r\nand participation of the national Governments\r\nconcerned. Care should be taken to ensure that the\r\nUnited Nations is not seen to be engaging in practices\r\nand activities that amount to interference in the internal\r\naffairs of Member States.\r\nRegarding the engagement of parliamentarians in\r\nthe work of the United Nations, my delegation is\r\nsupportive of the proposal for support meetings before\r\nimportant intergovernmental meetings and of holding\r\nsuch meetings at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels. The outcomes of such meetings\r\nwould indeed enrich the deliberative processes at the\r\nintergovernmental level.\r\nLet me conclude by observing that this report\r\nappears to have been informed only by the need to\r\njustify and institutionalize greater civil society\r\ninvolvement in the work of the United Nations and not\r\nby the need to improve the basis upon which the\r\nrelationship is formed. We note that the report is silent\r\nabout the concerns of Governments regarding this\r\nissue. Questions have been raised about the growing\r\nnumbers, motives, representativeness, integrity and\r\naccountability of civil society organizations in the\r\nUnited Nations. The report ignores those serious\r\nissues, preferring only to discuss increasing civil\r\nsociety participation. We hope that those issues will be\r\naddressed before, and not after, discussion of the\r\nmodalities for enhancing civil society involvement.\r\nMr. Herasymenko (Ukraine): First of all, let me\r\nwarmly congratulate you, Sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession. You may rest assured of Ukraine’s full support\r\nof your efforts to make the activities of the General\r\nAssembly during the current session successful and\r\neffective.\r\nThe fact that we taking up the discussion of\r\nagenda item 52, “Revitalization of the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly”, and agenda item 54,\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations system”, at the\r\nvery beginning of the fifty-ninth session, immediately\r\nafter the general debate, testifies to the importance of\r\nthose items for the international community. It is\r\nencouraging to acknowledge that we have achieved\r\nconsiderable success in our work on these issues in the\r\npast two years.\r\nI would like to commend the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session, Mr. Julian\r\nHunte, and the six facilitators, whose tireless efforts\r\nhelped us to achieve progress on the reform and the\r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly.\r\nThat progress reaffirms our joint commitment to the\r\ncentral position of the General Assembly as the chief\r\ndeliberative, policy-making and representative organ of\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nthe United Nations and reaffirms our desire to enable it\r\nto play that role effectively.\r\nThat should be the ultimate goal and major\r\ndirection of the ongoing process of the revitalization of\r\nthe General Assembly. Although many of us would like\r\nto see bolder steps to give new breath to the Assembly,\r\nin the current circumstances we consider it appropriate\r\nto focus our efforts on those proposals that could gain\r\nthe wide support of the United Nations membership\r\nand that can be realistically expected to be\r\nimplemented in the near future.\r\nUkraine welcomed the General Assembly’s\r\nadoption of resolutions 58/126 and 58/316, which were\r\nimportant steps forward. They set out a number of\r\npractical proposals aimed at enhancing the authority\r\nand the role of the General Assembly and improving its\r\nworking methods. Their important feature —\r\nestablishing defined time frames — has greatly\r\ncontributed to the implementation of many of their\r\nprovisions and laid down the framework for further\r\nconsideration of others, including during this session of\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nWe are pleased to see that those resolutions are\r\nalready at work. Let me just mention the new\r\norganization of agenda items under headings that\r\ncorrespond to the priorities of the work of the United\r\nNations. A number of items have been streamlined, and\r\nthat effort should continue, in consultation with\r\nMember States and under agreed principles. Among\r\nother things, we believe it is also necessary to\r\nstreamline the routine speeches delivered in this Hall.\r\nUkraine fully supports the decision to strengthen\r\nthe Office of the President. It goes without saying that\r\nregular consultations of the President of the General\r\nAssembly with the Presidents of the Security Council\r\nand Economic and Social Council, as well as with\r\nrepresentatives of regional and other groups, would be\r\nvery helpful to better plan and organize the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. In that regard, we would also like\r\nto stress that it would be useful for the current\r\nPresident of the General Assembly to maintain close\r\nand regular contacts with the Council of Presidents of\r\nthe General Assembly, so that he can take full\r\nadvantage of its members’ experience and advice. We\r\nhope that that idea will receive positive consideration\r\nin the course of further discussions during this session.\r\nWe should not lose the momentum of reform. To\r\na large extent our hopes in that regard rely on your\r\nleadership, Mr. President, and you may count on the\r\nfull support and understanding of my delegation in\r\nyour efforts to achieve tangible results. I would like to\r\nassure you that Ukraine, whose representative is\r\nchairing the Third Committee, is fully committed to\r\ntranslating the decisions on this issue into practice.\r\nRegarding agenda item 54, “Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations system”, the Secretary-General in his\r\nlatest report on the work of the Organization (A/59/1),\r\nsaid: “The implementation of my agenda for further\r\nchange, submitted to the General Assembly two years\r\nago, is now largely complete” (para. 255). He further\r\nreports that the recent review conducted by the General\r\nAccountability Office of the United States Government\r\nestimated that 85 per cent of the reforms proposed in\r\nthe 1997 and 2002 reform packages had been either\r\nfully or partly implemented. Those statistics are quite\r\nclear. I wish to express our gratitude to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan, whose tireless efforts in\r\npromoting the reforms in the United Nations since\r\nassuming the office deserve not only our words of\r\npraise, but, first and foremost, our active support. That\r\nsupport will be necessary in order to achieve progress\r\nin implementing the remaining reform measures during\r\nthe current session.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to welcome the\r\nsubmission of the report of the Panel of Eminent\r\nPersons on United Nations-Civil Society Relations\r\n(A/58/817 and Corr.l), chaired by the former President\r\nof Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, as well as the\r\nSecretary-General’s report in response to the Panel’s\r\nrecommendations (A/59/354). Indeed, the effectiveness\r\nand relevance of the Organization can only increase if\r\nwe find appropriate ways to strengthen the\r\ninvolvement and participation of civil society in it.\r\nFinally, I would like to underline that, along with\r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly and\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations in many areas, we\r\nneed to push forward with Security Council reform.\r\nAdvancing the reform of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, through strengthening its coordinating role in\r\nthe economic and social spheres, also should not be put\r\non the backburner of our agenda. We are looking\r\nforward to the outcome of the work of the High-Level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change and will\r\nactively engage in its consideration.\r\nMr. Gallegos Chiriboga (Ecuador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I would like to extend to you, Mr. President,\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nthe congratulations of my delegation. We are sure that\r\nunder your able leadership during this session the\r\nGeneral Assembly will have a successful outcome. I\r\nwould also like to assure you that Ecuador is prepared\r\nto cooperate with you and to make a constructive\r\ncontribution on the matters of greatest priority for the\r\nUnited Nations. One of those matters is the subject we\r\nare dealing with today. We know of your ability and we\r\nhave no doubt, therefore, that the results of your\r\nstewardship will be extremely positive for the\r\nOrganization.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with what was\r\nsaid by the representative of Algeria, speaking on\r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, and also what\r\nwas said by the representative of Brazil on behalf of\r\nthe Rio Group.\r\nWe reaffirm our conviction of the need for the\r\nGeneral Assembly to reassume the importance and the\r\nrole for which it was created. As the most important\r\ndemocratic deliberative body on the planet — where\r\neach Member State has a voice and a vote — it is\r\nimperative to give it the necessary capability to lead\r\nthe international community. Clearly, since its creation\r\nmore than half a century ago, there have been historic\r\nchanges that have made it necessary — and I would\r\neven say vital — for the General Assembly to reform\r\nits procedures and efficiency so that it can confront the\r\nchallenges of a changing international situation.\r\nIn the absence of political decisions by Members\r\nin the General Assembly, other organs have had to play\r\nan increasingly important role. That absence of\r\npolitical will has been seen in the lack of decision-\r\nmaking ability and an immense agenda — often loaded\r\ndown with repetitive and irrelevant items. All of this\r\nmeans that the General Assembly is not taking up the\r\nhistoric challenge of reflecting a dynamic international\r\npolicy for today. Often, that incapacity has meant that\r\nsubjects that could have been dealt with in this forum\r\nhave not been. Member States need to realize that the\r\nGeneral Assembly is a debate and reconciliation\r\nmechanism devised for the benefit of our peoples. The\r\ninternational community, therefore, requires us to bring\r\nabout a substantive revitalization of a system that is\r\nfailing it.\r\nThe approval, at the previous session, of\r\nresolution 58/316 constitutes the result of very difficult\r\nnegotiations and it encourages us to continue working\r\nwith steadfast responsibility to implement its mandate.\r\nWe are grateful for the achievements of the\r\nformer President of the General Assembly, Julian\r\nHunte, on this issue. We realize, however, that a lot\r\nmore remains to be done. During this session,\r\nMembers need to examine the question of\r\nreprogramming of the work of the Main Committees of\r\nthe General Assembly. By April 2005 the Main\r\nCommittees are to present to the General Assembly for\r\nits consideration their analysis on the need, frequency\r\nand importance of each of the subjects they are\r\nconsidering. Those recommendations from those\r\nspecialists will be of fundamental importance in\r\nhelping us to rationalize the workload, which itself\r\nneeds to be reviewed with greater attention.\r\nResolution 58/316 only removed two subjects\r\nfrom the workload, subjects that do not even amount to\r\n1 per cent of the total. That is of concern. We recognize\r\nthat this is a sensitive subject for many delegations;\r\nhowever, it is also true that the programme of work of\r\nthe General Assembly should be a true reflection of the\r\ncurrent state of relations among States in the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe also hope that the changes introduced with\r\nregard to the Bureau will serve to strengthen the\r\nprogress of work in the General Assembly.\r\nI would like to conclude by reflecting on the\r\nimportance of the deliberations of the General\r\nAssembly with regard to the work of the High-level\r\nPanel, convened by the Secretary-General to examine\r\nthreats, challenges and change. A report from that\r\nPanel will be submitted for consideration by Member\r\nStates in December and undoubtedly will propose a\r\nfundamental revision of the architecture of\r\ninternational relations. The General Assembly will\r\nhave to study that report and take decisions to confront\r\nthe challenges before the United Nations, to which I\r\nreferred previously. The relevance of the United\r\nNations, which has been questioned so much in recent\r\ndays, will be in the hands of the representatives\r\ngathered together here. We must remember that\r\ninternational society will be taking a very close look at\r\nthe deliberations taking place in this Hall.\r\nMr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): In taking the floor for the first time here at the\r\nfifty-ninth session of the General Assembly,\r\nMr. President, I would like to express to you our great\r\npleasure and pride at seeing you preside over our work.\r\nYour outstanding qualities of statesmanship, your many\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nyears of experience as a diplomat and your superb\r\nunderstanding of people guarantee the value of your\r\npresidency’s contribution to the work of the Assembly.\r\nWe are pleased that, under your guidance, the General\r\nAssembly is today continuing the debate begun at its\r\nforty-sixth session on its revitalization and the\r\nstrengthening of its authority. Cameroon associates\r\nitself with the statement made by Algeria this morning\r\non behalf on the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nThe debate begun this morning is an important\r\nexercise because it deals with the functioning of an\r\nessential body that is in fact the cornerstone of\r\nmultilateralism. Indeed, the General Assembly, for\r\nsome, is a forum in which to harmonize the efforts of\r\nStates to implement the principles and purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations. For others, it is a body that expresses\r\nthe collective and universal conscience. For yet others,\r\nit is a body endowed with a kind of moral authority,\r\nmanifested through abilities that are as extensive as\r\nthey are diverse.\r\nAfter more than a decade of slow and patient\r\nnegotiating, we have now made some progress. The\r\nmost significant step was the adoption at the fifty-\r\neighth session of resolutions 58/126 and 58/316. Allow\r\nme here to pay heartfelt tribute to your predecessor,\r\nJulian Hunte, who, through his flexibility, tenacity and\r\ncourage, as well as his wisdom, made that adoption\r\npossible. In so doing, he made a valuable contribution\r\nto the success of the mission that our heads of State\r\nentrusted to us at the Millennium Summit — that of\r\nreforming our Organization and improving its\r\neffectiveness in meeting the great concerns of the\r\nUnited Nations family.\r\nThe resolutions adopted last year will indeed be\r\nconsidered landmarks in our quest for an Assembly\r\nwith enhanced authority, a greater role to play, and\r\nbetter working methods, both within its Bureau and in\r\nthe main Committees. The decisions taken on the\r\nagenda, as well as those relating to the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, are ample testimony to this fact. In\r\nfact, the agenda, which expresses the concerns of the\r\nMillennium Summit, will now be organized around the\r\nOrganization’s priorities for the period of 2002 to\r\n2005, and those priorities dovetail with the initial goals\r\nof the founders of the United Nations.\r\nThis categorization and restructuring, we believe,\r\nhas numerous advantages. Let us take note here of two\r\nof these advantages. The first advantage is that the\r\nagenda is thus further rationalized and, we believe, will\r\nhelp us to better cope with the numerous old and new\r\nchallenges facing us. The second advantage is that this\r\nnew structure imposes much more consistency and\r\ncohesion in how we deal with the questions before the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Indeed, the Main Committees will\r\nno longer have to deal with the items sent to them as\r\nindependent questions — or as questions per se — but\r\nrather will be able to examine them in the context of\r\nour Organization’s responsibility to provide answers to\r\nthe major concerns facing mankind.\r\nUnder the resolutions adopted last year, the report\r\nof the Economic and Social Council and those of the\r\nother principal bodies will be considered in their\r\nentirety at the plenary. My country welcomes this,\r\nsince it in fact entails a reaffirmation of the practice\r\nbegun by the General Assembly in 2001 when\r\nCameroon was presiding over the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. That decision is particularly important now, as\r\nthe General Assembly’s authority continues to shrink\r\nthe more its services are in demand, as a result of the\r\nextremely subtle interference of other bodies with\r\nrestricted membership. The Member States, to ensure\r\nthat this decision is fully effective, must see to it that\r\nthis review is no longer merely an opportunity for a\r\nstring of general statements but, rather, produces\r\nrecommendations that will provide fuel for thought for\r\nthe later work of the Council or be useful to the Bureau\r\nfor purposes of follow-up. That consideration must\r\ninvolve — and this is not yet the case — a very high\r\nnumber of States. These remarks, though intended for\r\nthe consideration of the report of Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, are also valid for the General Assembly’s\r\nconsideration, under article XV of the Charter, of the\r\nreports of other principal United Nations organs,\r\nincluding those of the Secretary-General, as head of the\r\nSecretariat, and the Security Council. We will have an\r\nopportunity in due time to return to that issue when we\r\nconsider those reports.\r\nThis concept of debate naturally assumes that the\r\nBureau will provide stronger leadership. This is why\r\nwe wish to see a continuation of consultations\r\nregarding its enhancement. Along the same lines,\r\nconsultations should continue on proposals aimed at\r\ndeveloping a new schedule for the work of the General\r\nAssembly for two substantive periods. This means,\r\nMr. President, that your universally recognized\r\nqualities will be, in the days and months to come, most\r\nvaluable for us in finding solutions to all these issues,\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nas well as to pending issues. Here, more than ever\r\nbefore, I believe, you will need boldness and wisdom.\r\nAs Horace said, sapere aude: dare to be wise. You can\r\ncount on the continuing support of my delegation.\r\nThe various proposals before us, including those\r\nin the document introduced this morning by the Deputy\r\nSecretary-General, will also be of valuable assistance\r\nto you. Moreover, I would like to express here to the\r\nDeputy Secretary-General our great appreciation for\r\nher introductory statement, which was most\r\nenlightening.\r\nI would now like to make a few general\r\ncomments on the report of the Panel of Eminent\r\nPersons on United Nations-Civil Society Relations.\r\nThis is indeed the proper place to congratulate this\r\nPanel, presided over by Mr. Fernando Henrique\r\nCardoso, for the high quality of the recommendations\r\ncontained in his most useful report. Two years ago, the\r\nSecretary-General, in his report entitled “Strengthening\r\nthe United Nations: an agenda for further change”\r\n(A/57/387), rightly referred to the growing importance\r\nof non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as players\r\nin international society. He also emphasized the\r\ninterest that non-governmental organizations (NGOs)\r\nincreasingly have in the work of the United Nations\r\nand warmly welcomed their high-quality participation\r\nin devising solutions to the challenges facing the\r\ninternational community.\r\nI would like to recall here the role of NGOs in the\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court, as\r\nwell as their contributions to the success of major\r\nworld conferences on the financing of development and\r\non sustainable development. We had the opportunity to\r\nappreciate the relevance of their comments during the\r\ndebates on poverty, investment, debt and economic\r\ngrowth.\r\nIt was natural and timely, therefore, to rationalize\r\nand strengthen the synergistic relationship between the\r\nUnited Nations system and the NGOs. Here, we are\r\npleased to note that through the recent well-balanced\r\nreview of existing practices, as well as the clear\r\npresentation of recommendations on the best way to\r\npromote that relationship, the Panel has brilliantly\r\ndischarged the mission entrusted to it.\r\nWe believe, as does the Secretary-General, that\r\nin-depth consultations between the United Nations and\r\nNGOs, and the growing participation of NGOs in\r\ndebates of global importance, can only serve to\r\nimprove the quality of policy analysis. Partnership with\r\nNGOs will considerably facilitate the implementation\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in\r\nthe humanitarian areas, in combating poverty and in\r\neducation — in a nutshell, in providing access for all to\r\nbasic social services.\r\nIt is in this spirit that the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport two years ago (A/57/1) emphasized the critical\r\nimportance of such cooperation with the NGOs, given\r\nthe need to respond to the complex social, economic,\r\nsecurity and environmental challenges that exist today.\r\nOverall, it is encouraging to note that such\r\ncooperation has continued to develop, witness the\r\nincreased level of participation of NGOs in the\r\ndeliberations and activities of the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nIn our view, some of the proposals for enhancing\r\nNGO participation, in terms of both quantity and\r\nquality, merit attention. This is particularly true with\r\nregard to the need to make significant resources\r\navailable to facilitate the participation of NGOs from\r\ndeveloping countries. Those NGOs require somewhat\r\nmore time to become genuinely independent and\r\nresponsible players.\r\nThat is why Cameroon, while presiding over the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, supported the\r\nimplementation of the initiative of the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General for establishing a network of\r\nAfrican NGOs with the objective of helping them to\r\nstrengthen their capacities.\r\nOther proposals, such as those regarding the\r\naccreditation of NGOs and their contribution and\r\nparticipation at the national level, have moved a little\r\nfurther forward as well.\r\nThose are a few general comments that come to\r\nmind on a reading of the Cardoso report. We thank the\r\nSecretary-General for having given us some indication\r\nof how he intends to follow-up on those\r\nrecommendations. We would also like to thank him for\r\npresenting States with ideas on policy-oriented action\r\nand decisions based on the report’s recommendations.\r\nWe think that we should continue to study this subject\r\non the basis of this outstanding document and, clearly,\r\nour consultations in the days to come will be inspired\r\nby its conclusions. The report’s very title attests to the\r\nfaith that the world’s peoples have in our Organization\r\nand their readiness to participate side by side with\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nStates so that the United Nations will best and most\r\neffectively be able to meet the legitimate aspirations of\r\nmankind — a world free from fear and want.\r\nMrs. Holguín Cuéllar (Colombia) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nappointment and assure you of the willingness of our\r\ndelegation to help you in the work of the Assembly. We\r\nwould like to repeat our support for the goal of\r\nstrengthening the United Nations and we will actively\r\nparticipate in this debate in affirmation of its role in the\r\nmultilateral system.\r\nWe would like to thank the Secretary-General for\r\nthe presentation of his report on the relationship\r\nbetween the United Nations and civil society. We\r\nbelieve that working with civil society is important and\r\nshould continue. We welcome the multifaceted\r\ninterchange that is possible within the multilateral\r\nsystem. The main players in this relationship, however,\r\nare Member States, who are the creators of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe wish to respect the purposes and principles of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations — that which gives\r\nthis Organization its raison d’être. The United Nations,\r\nlets not forget, was created to bring together and\r\nstrengthen States with the objective of peaceful\r\ncoexistence and social and economic development. The\r\ndialogue with civil society is constructive because it\r\nstrengthens the institutions of Member States; and the\r\npresence of stable States that are respectful of\r\ninternational law reinforces the multilateral system.\r\nTherefore, the dialogue should be transparent and we\r\nshould actively involve States and non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nIn this respect, we do not agree with the idea\r\npresented in the report aimed at eliminating the current\r\nintergovernmental accreditation body for non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. The conclusions of the\r\nCommittee on Non-Governmental Organizations reveal\r\nthe coordinated and efficient work carried out by\r\nMember States. The current accreditation system is\r\nopen to States and NGOs. A Secretariat-based system\r\nwould not have such transparency and openness and\r\nwould not be as open to Member States and NGOs\r\nfrom developing countries. We feel that transparency in\r\nthe process of accreditation is fundamental, and that\r\nonly a system managed by an intergovernmental body\r\ncan guarantee this. We feel that any change in the\r\ncurrent accreditation system and its scope should be\r\nthe result of consultation and debate among Member\r\nStates.\r\nAlthough we feel that we should take a closer\r\nlook at the proposal to connect the local and global\r\nlevels, it is important to reiterate that the sovereignty\r\nof States, as laid down in the Charter of the United\r\nNations, is alive and well today. Any effort to act on\r\nthe proposal must take into account the structures of\r\nMember States, which are the main connectors between\r\nthe local and the global. This Organization belongs to\r\nthe Member States and its agenda should be\r\ndetermined through debate among Member States.\r\nThe exchange between NGOs and the United\r\nNations has gone on for many years. That exchange\r\nmust complement the support function of the United\r\nNations and the NGOs in helping Member States in\r\ntheir development. However, we feel that the main\r\nplayers in the United Nations system are Governments,\r\nand that should continue to be the case. We feel that\r\nStates should continue to be fully engaged in their\r\nrelationships with NGOs, and therefore we do not see\r\nthe need to expand bureaucratic structures within the\r\nSecretariat for that purpose. We reiterate our\r\navailability to actively participate in the debate on the\r\ninclusion of NGOs in our work.\r\nMr. Sermoneta (Israel): Israel remains staunchly\r\nin favour of the ideas that lie behind these continuing\r\nventures. Efficacy demands efficiency. In seeking to\r\nrevitalize the work of the General Assembly, we will\r\nalso strengthen the United Nations system; in turn, in\r\nseeking to strengthen the United Nations system, we\r\ncannot but revitalize the work of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nTo work towards realizing our goals in such\r\nimportant areas as technology-based development\r\nissues, water issues, the promotion of good governance\r\nas the foundation for peace, and the strengthening of\r\nthe United Nations capacity to fight terrorism, we must\r\nstreamline our energies and avoid the practice of\r\nharping on the skewed obsession of a repetitive\r\nagenda.\r\nIn recent years, there have been some signs of\r\nimprovement in that regard, in line with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reports and the visions often enunciated by\r\nthis Assembly. The number of joint debates is\r\nexpanding — in itself a very important trend — but\r\nthat still needs to continue further. There is no reason\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nfor the same parties to endlessly discuss the same\r\nsubstantive material in the same forums.\r\nIsrael is still disappointed, however, by the\r\nautomatic yearly repetition of resolutions without any\r\nregard to their usefulness or relevance. We would like\r\nto see a reduction in the overall number of resolutions,\r\nas well as a consolidation of resolutions into omnibus\r\nresolutions, as was the practice in the past. We would\r\nalso welcome an increase in the number of resolutions\r\nthat are considered on a biannual rather than on an\r\nannual basis. That would save time, money and\r\npaperwork. Clearly, any future attempt to add\r\nadditional repetition to an already redundant agenda\r\nshould be abandoned. Not only are such wastes of\r\nresources harmful to the proceedings and credibility of\r\nthe United Nations; they are often harmful to the\r\nunderlying issues as well.\r\nFinally, towards those same worthwhile ends,\r\nIsrael once again calls on the United Nations to review\r\nand improve the terms and conditions governing the\r\naccreditation and participation of non-governmental\r\norganizations in United Nations conferences. Just as\r\ninefficiencies in the agenda can subvert the United\r\nNations work, so too can the hidden agendas of\r\npoliticized outside bodies. In that context, Israel looks\r\nforward to closely examining the recommendations of\r\nthe Panel of Eminent Persons on United Nations-Civil\r\nSociety Relations, as well as the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport on their implementation.\r\nIn conclusion, Israel welcomes any and all efforts\r\nto strengthen the way that the United Nations works to\r\nmeet its goals — to make it more efficient, more\r\nfocused and more vital. The imperative is clear: The\r\nmore our agenda possesses inefficiency, the more\r\ninefficiency will possess us.\r\nMr. Arifi (Morocco) (spoke in French): The\r\nirreversible changes that international relations have\r\nundergone since the end of the cold war, the\r\nincreasingly unpredictable threats to international\r\npeace and security and the effects of rapid\r\nglobalization, compounded by imperative development\r\nneeds, present major challenges to our Organization\r\ntoday.\r\nAs was clearly illustrated in this year’s general\r\ndebate, United Nations reform has become an urgent\r\nneed and sine qua non for restoring multilateralism and\r\nfor endowing it with the strength, efficiency and\r\ncredibility it requires in order to preserve peace and, in\r\npartnership, to guarantee the implementation of the\r\nobjectives of sustainable development.\r\nIn his closing statement in the general debate, the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly noted that, of the\r\n190 statements, 121 addressed the issue of United\r\nNations reform, emphasizing both the progress\r\nachieved and the road that lies ahead. A considerable\r\nnumber of those statements were in fact replete with\r\nspecific proposals urging us to continue improving the\r\nfunctioning and effectiveness of our Organization. The\r\nfertile debate and the promising ideas put forward\r\ntherein should be better exploited and put to\r\nconstructive use. Perhaps the Secretariat could prepare\r\na compilation of the ideas and proposals suggested by\r\nvarious Member States. Such a compilation would\r\nspare us a repetitive debate and form the basis for a\r\nuseful working paper for our ongoing work on that\r\ntopic.\r\nThe unanimous appeal launched by our leaders to\r\nrevisit and strengthen the architecture of the United\r\nNations, an indispensable meeting place for all\r\nhumankind, arose from the concern that the\r\nineffectiveness of multilateralism in addressing those\r\nproblems can only exacerbate the threat to peace,\r\nsecurity and international stability. Thus, the creation\r\nof a comprehensive medium- and long-term reform\r\nplan is more imperative than ever.\r\nThe key element of that reform remains\r\nredressing the democratic deficit in the Security\r\nCouncil through an expanded membership that reflects,\r\nin a representative and equitable manner, the new\r\ngeopolitical circumstances and takes the sociocultural\r\ndimension into consideration. Naturally, we eagerly\r\nawait the options to be submitted by the Panel of\r\nEminent Persons and hope that the international\r\ncommunity will find a formula that does not exacerbate\r\nexisting differences.\r\nThe Security Council must fully shoulder its\r\nresponsibilities in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. Its membership must better reflect\r\nthe new realities of our world by providing a greater\r\nplace for the developing countries and by being more\r\nequitably representative. In that context, an increase in\r\nthe number of non-permanent seats, with a seat\r\nreserved for those States that contribute heavily to\r\npeacekeeping operations, is a necessity.\r\nThe Council’s reform, and its enlargement in\r\nparticular, should be seen, however, not as a mere\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nmathematical exercise, but as an ongoing and gradual\r\nprocess to include, within reasonable parameters, the\r\nelements of balance, rationalization, effectiveness and\r\nlegitimacy. Such a process can succeed, of course, only\r\nif it is the product of all Member States represented at\r\nthe highest level. In that context, the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, with the assistance of a limited\r\nworking group of his own choosing, could play a\r\nfundamental role in the process of consultation among\r\nvarious regional groups by preparing a framework for\r\nwork to create greater visibility and to promote a\r\npossible decision to be taken during the sixtieth\r\nanniversary year. My country is ready effectively to\r\ncontribute to that exercise and to provide all necessary\r\nsupport for its successful conclusion.\r\nWhile the expansion of the Security Council is\r\ncertainly a basic element of United Nations reform, we\r\nmust not forget that the problem of reforming the\r\ninternational system is much broader than that. The\r\nGeneral Assembly, our universal body par excellence,\r\nmust face the challenges confronting the Organization.\r\nThe revitalization process, already under way, must\r\ncontinue with a view to strengthening the authority of\r\nthe General Assembly and to adapt its work to the\r\nincrease in the number of its members, as well as to\r\npromote the development of modern communication\r\nand information technology.\r\nThe interdependence of peace and development\r\nrequires interaction among the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council\r\nto create better coordination and synergy among those\r\nprincipal organs in dealing with the issues before them.\r\nThe implementation of Article 24 of the United\r\nNations Charter will contribute to achieving that goal.\r\nIndeed, under Article 24 the Security Council shall\r\nsubmit, periodically, special reports on questions of\r\ninternational interest to the General Assembly for its\r\nconsideration.\r\nSpecific follow-up to the General Assembly’s\r\ndebate on the annual report of the Security Council is\r\nanother measure which would help strengthen the role\r\nof the Assembly. Here, the Assembly should not\r\nconfine itself merely to information-gathering, but\r\nrather should respond, after intensive consideration, by\r\ntaking the necessary decisions.\r\nThe ever-growing importance of economic and\r\nsocial questions has bestowed a primary role on the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, which in the future must\r\nplay its development role as a generator of economic\r\ncooperation among States. Closer cooperation by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council with the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nwill certainly open up new prospects in drawing up\r\ndevelopment policies and strategies.\r\nIn that context, we welcome the efforts of the\r\nSecretariat in implementing the agenda for further\r\nchange, which the Secretary-General submitted to us in\r\n2002 (see A/57/387 and Corr.1). We welcome in\r\nparticular the efforts to align United Nations activities\r\nwith the priorities jointly defined at the Millennium\r\nSummit and the international conferences of the 1990s,\r\nas well as the significant reorganization of the\r\nDepartment for General Assembly and Conference\r\nManagement and the Department of Public\r\nInformation.\r\nThe development of partnerships between the\r\nUnited Nations and various non-State actors, including\r\nthrough greater participation of civil society and the\r\nprivate sector, will help to strengthen the capacity of\r\nthe United Nations and enrich the debate.\r\nHere, we wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to\r\nthe conclusions of the recent report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in response to the report of the Panel of\r\nEminent Persons on United Nations-Civil Society\r\nRelations (A/59/354). We believe that strengthening\r\nthe capacity of non-governmental organizations in\r\ndeveloping countries should be a priority at the present\r\nstage.\r\nIn order to revitalize the United Nations system,\r\nwe must all contribute to the process of reform and\r\nrevitalization of the United Nations and its principal\r\norgans. The Panel of Eminent Persons could stimulate\r\ndebate and fuel the process, particularly if it tackles the\r\ntwo key elements of the institutional architecture:\r\npeacekeeping centred on the Security Council, and the\r\ncoordination of economic cooperation, centred on a\r\nbody which would truly exercise that function in\r\nconnection with the specialized agencies.\r\nWe hope that political will and a long-term vision\r\nwill win the day.\r\nMr. Wiranataadmadja (Indonesia): The\r\ndelegation of Indonesia would like to express its\r\nappreciation to you, Mr. President, for convening this\r\njoint debate, which is an opportunity to discuss the\r\nsubject of the revitalization of the General Assembly.\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.19\r\nThe purpose of the debate is unquestionably to\r\nre-establish the role of the General Assembly. Let me\r\nalso take this opportunity to express my sincere\r\nappreciation to the Deputy Secretary-General for her\r\nintroduction to the debate. Before going further, my\r\ndelegation also associates itself with the statement\r\nmade this morning by Algeria on behalf of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement on the subject of the revitalization\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nIndonesia welcomed the adoption of resolutions\r\n58/126 and 58/316, which were aimed at strengthening,\r\nrevitalizing and reinvigorating the General Assembly\r\nin its role as the chief deliberative, policy-making and\r\nrepresentative body of the United Nations. Indonesia\r\nalso appreciates the initiative and role of His\r\nExcellency Mr. Julian Hunte, President of the fifty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly, in the process\r\nleading to their adoption. Those two resolutions\r\nindicate clearly that many issues remain to be resolved\r\nin the effort to enhance the authority and the role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, including in its relationship with\r\nother principal organs of the United Nations, namely\r\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. My delegation hopes that the forthcoming\r\nwork will bring substantive progress in achieving a\r\nclearly defined relationship among those three\r\nprincipal organs, consistent with the Charter.\r\nWhile the process of revitalization is far from\r\nover, Mr. President, my delegation believes that your\r\nskill and experience will yield progress on the issue.\r\nMy delegation also hopes that the revitalization\r\nexercise will proceed even further and more\r\nsubstantively in the near future.\r\nIt is also important to stress that the strengthening\r\nof the United Nations system must be aimed at\r\nenabling the Organization to perform at optimal\r\nefficiency in order to deliver the benefits of\r\ndevelopment and peace. In that regard, any proposal by\r\nthe Secretary-General should be considered within the\r\ncontext of the extent to which it could support the\r\nOrganization’s efforts in the development field.\r\nThat will require the Secretary-General to\r\nallocate more resources to development activities as\r\nwell as first-rate staff to enable the Secretariat to\r\ndeliver adequate services to Member States. In that\r\ncontext, we would like to emphasize the need to\r\nachieve equal geographical distribution and gender\r\nbalance, particularly at the level of policy-making\r\nwithin the Secretariat, without compromising the\r\nexcellence in the quality of personnel that is the\r\nstrength of the Organization.\r\nFinally, let me also touch upon the report of the\r\nSecretary-General in response to the report of the Panel\r\nof Eminent Persons on United Nations-Civil Society\r\nRelations (A/59/354). My delegation agrees that there\r\nis a need to make the United Nations a more outward-\r\nlooking organization and to expand its dialogue with\r\nvarious constituencies and facilitate their input into the\r\ndebate on issues of global significance.\r\nIn that connection, however, we would like to\r\nnote that some of the proposals contained in the\r\nreports, such as those relating to the participation of\r\nnon-governmental organizations in intergovernmental\r\nbodies, must be seriously and carefully considered\r\nbefore any action is taken. Such proposals appear\r\ndifficult to operationalize, and would therefore have to\r\nbe clearly defined. We look forward to discussing those\r\nproposals.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6 p.m.\r\n"
