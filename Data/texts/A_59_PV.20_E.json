(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda items 52 and 54 (continued)\r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations system\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/59/354)\r\nMr. Baduri (Eritrea): I should like at the outset\r\nto join previous speakers in expressing sincere thanks\r\nand appreciation to the Secretary-General for his four\r\nspecial reports on the issues under discussion\r\n(A/59/CRP.3 to CRP.6).\r\nThe people of Eritrea, whose long association\r\nwith the United Nations before independence was not,\r\nto say the least, a happy one, and whose memories of\r\nresolution 390 (V) — which illegitimately federated\r\ntheir country with Ethiopia — are agonizing,\r\nnevertheless welcome the decision to reform, revitalize\r\nand strengthen the United Nations system, especially\r\nthe General Assembly. It should be recalled that it was\r\nnot the Security Council, but the General Assembly,\r\nwhich, on the basis of Article 10 of the Charter, gave\r\nthe United Nations stamp of approval to the ill-fated\r\nfederation, on the basis that it was exercising a rightful\r\ndecision-making power provided for by the Charter. It\r\nwas one of the first decisions — if not actually the first\r\ndecision — made by the General Assembly. The\r\nAssembly exercised that power because some in the\r\nSecurity Council recognized that any similar resolution\r\nin the Council would be threatened by a veto. That is\r\nthe irony of history.\r\nThat, however, is history. The United Nations is\r\nthe only Organization whose continued existence —\r\nalbeit with some necessary changes — has been\r\nconsidered indispensable to meet the challenges of the\r\nnew world order of globalization. It is noteworthy that\r\nthe heads of State or Government, who met at the\r\nMillennium Summit, decided to reaffirm the central\r\nposition of the General Assembly as the chief\r\ndeliberative policy-making and representative organ of\r\nthe United Nations, and to enable it to play that role\r\neffectively.\r\nIt is also to be recalled that a preponderant\r\nnumber of States have, during previous annual sessions\r\nof the General Assembly, voiced strong support for the\r\nexpeditious revitalization of the General Assembly,\r\nalthough a couple of decades ago it was being ridiculed\r\nand dismissed as an effete, ineffective and\r\nirresponsible debating society. Needless to say,\r\nEritreans warily accept and welcome the change in\r\nattitudes — believing that it is a reflection of the\r\ntimes — but fervently hope that no other people will be\r\npunished by anything similar to resolution 390 (V).\r\nHaving said that, the Eritrean delegation wishes\r\nto endorse the recommendations incorporated into the\r\nstatement by Algeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement. In addition, we wish to make the following\r\nobservations.\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.20\r\nFirst, the need for reform and strengthening of\r\nthe United Nations system, particularly the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, stems from the\r\nrecognition that, during the first 50 years of its\r\nexistence — that is, the era of the cold war — there\r\nwas a steady erosion of its powers, a decline in its\r\nprestige and an increase in its marginalization by the\r\npowerful States and their allies. As a result, there was a\r\nloss of trust and confidence — and there was even\r\ncynicism — on the part of its other Members. The end\r\nof the cold war, the advent of the era of globalization\r\nand the ensuing convergence of interests — even when\r\nit was minimal — among the erstwhile antagonists\r\ncreated a salubrious environment of cooperation and\r\nencouraged reassessment of the United Nations.\r\nSecondly, the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly cannot be successfully effected without\r\ncorresponding reform in the principal organs of the\r\nUnited Nations — including the Security Council, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Secretariat —\r\nand in allied institutions, including the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, as well as in the relationship between the\r\nUnited Nations and other international and regional\r\norganizations. In that connection, the Eritrean\r\ndelegation welcomes the report of the Panel of Eminent\r\nPersons, whose mandate was to undertake a\r\ncomprehensive review of the balance and effectiveness\r\nof the major organs and institutions of the United\r\nNations system.\r\nThirdly, any reform effort must, of course, be in\r\nconsonance with the purposes and objectives of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals and the numerous\r\ndeclarations and programmes of action of the major\r\nUnited Nations conferences that were held during the\r\nlast years of the twentieth century and the early years\r\nof the twenty-first century and which defined and\r\nenunciated the new concepts, values, norms and\r\nprinciples that must guide humanity and govern future\r\ninternational relations in the new international order.\r\nFourthly, economic and social development —\r\nbroadly defined as the satisfaction of the economic,\r\nsocial, cultural and humanitarian needs of humanity\r\nand specified in Chapter IX of the Charter as original\r\nprinciples of the United Nations — must be given\r\nequal prominence as security issues. Freedom from\r\nwant and freedom from fear must be regarded as\r\nequally important. Indeed, the definition of security\r\nnow encompasses the former as well as the latter. In\r\nthat connection, institutional restructuring of the\r\nOrganization’s social and economic sectors becomes\r\nappropriate. Eritrea supports the efforts made to\r\nconsolidate the Department of Economic and Social\r\nAffairs and to enable it to acquire a strategic planning\r\ncapacity.\r\nFifthly, Eritrea endorses the proposal, made by\r\nthe previous President, Mr. Julian Hunte, to consider\r\nthe issue of the strengthening the General Assembly in\r\ntwo clusters, one dealing with the enhancement of the\r\nrole of the General Assembly on the basis of the\r\nrelevant provisions of the Charter, and the other, with\r\nthe working methods of the Assembly. However, both\r\nclusters must be addressed in tandem, because success\r\nin one area without any achievements in the other\r\nwould be meaningless.\r\nThe reform and strengthening of the United\r\nNations — particularly the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly — is viewed by many as a matter of urgent\r\npriority. The momentum that has been triggered must\r\nbe sustained. Yet it must be recognized that the desired\r\nchange cannot be achieved without the required\r\npolitical commitment. If there is to be success,\r\ncommitment must be genuine and must be translated\r\ninto concrete action.\r\nMr. Dhakal (Nepal): At the outset, let me\r\nwarmly congratulate you, Sir, on your well-deserved\r\nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-ninth session. I assure you of our cooperation to\r\nmake that session a successful one. My delegation\r\njoins others in expressing its appreciation to the former\r\nPresident of the Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Julian\r\nHunte, for his commitment to advancing the work of\r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly during his term. We\r\nalso express our sincere appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his relentless efforts to move United\r\nNations reform forward and for his report (A/59/354)\r\nsubmitted to the Assembly.\r\nMy delegation attaches great importance to the\r\nwork of strengthening of the United Nations and\r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly. I commend you,\r\nMr. President, for the commitment you have shown to\r\ncarry forward the agenda of United Nations reform,\r\nincluding the revitalization of the work of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement\r\nmade yesterday by the Permanent Representative of\r\nAlgeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. My\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.20\r\ndelegation wishes to make a few observations on the\r\nextremely important issue before us.\r\nNepal firmly believes that the efforts aimed at\r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly should focus mainly\r\non addressing the burning issues that the world faces\r\ntoday, such as terrorism, poverty, illiteracy,\r\nmalnutrition and diseases such as the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic, malaria and tuberculosis. The United\r\nNations is undertaking efforts aimed at achieving the\r\ntargets of the Millennium Development Goals, and\r\nnext year’s high-level event will be an important step\r\nin revealing the progress made on those goals.\r\nNepal believes that all work of the United\r\nNations should embody the fundamental objectives set\r\nout in its Charter. Nepal has always supported efforts\r\naimed at strengthening the United Nations and making\r\nits activities more effective and results-oriented. Nepal\r\nexpressed its position on issues on the agenda during\r\nthe debate last year. My delegation reiterates its\r\nposition on those issues in view of its relevance to the\r\nwork of the General Assembly.\r\nThere is no denying that the United Nations\r\nrequires more efficiency and effectiveness to carry out\r\nits tasks. Past efforts have made some progress in that\r\ndirection. Two resolutions — resolution 58/126 and\r\nresolution 58/316 — adopted by the General Assembly\r\nhave been important steps aimed at charting out a\r\nframework for revitalizing the Assembly. Nepal made\r\ncontributions to those resolutions by actively\r\nparticipating in the negotiations. We continue to\r\nsupport their objectives of enhancing the authority and\r\nthe role of the General Assembly and improving its\r\nefficiency and effectiveness. As envisaged by the\r\nresolutions, this year the General Assembly elected its\r\nVice-Presidents and the Bureaux of its Main\r\nCommittees well before the opening of the session.\r\nThat process needs to be institutionalized in future as\r\nwell, to assure a smooth transition of the Bureaux of\r\nthose bodies. Some changes have also taken place in\r\nthe working methods of the intergovernmental bodies,\r\nsuch as the Security Council and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, as well as the latter’s functional\r\nCommissions.\r\nWe have witnessed some procedural reforms, for\r\nexample the biennialization, triennialization and\r\nclustering of agenda items. Reducing time for the\r\ngeneral debate and eliminating conference services\r\nafter hours, have also helped in utilizing resources in a\r\ndisciplined and efficient manner. Such reforms have\r\ncertainly been useful for reducing costs and increasing\r\nefficiency, but, by themselves, they are not sufficient to\r\nmake the United Nations more effective in terms of its\r\noutputs and results.\r\nWe have also noted that the changes have\r\nremained procedural in nature, while substantive\r\nreforms have been lacking. There is a need for\r\ndetermined efforts to provide the United Nations with\r\nthe ability to meet the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. We need bold initiatives to make substantive\r\nchange as well, and to vigorously shape the United\r\nNations into an Organization that has the vision, the\r\nmeans and the tools to address the problems of a new\r\nworld.\r\nNepal is committed to working with those who\r\nare determined to put the United Nations at the centre\r\nof multilateralism and to take bold reform initiatives to\r\nrevive the Organization. At this juncture, reforms must\r\nbe bolder in approach and more innovative in content.\r\nThey must be comprehensive and coherent as well as\r\nsubstantive and doable. This debate affords us the\r\nopportunity to elaborate such needed reforms.\r\nWe therefore need to take a series of steps for\r\nprocedural and structural reorganization and\r\nrevitalization. Last year, my delegation made some\r\nsuggestions that were described with the acronym\r\n“CAMSSIB” — cluster and consolidate the agenda;\r\nadapt the agenda to the emerging needs; merge and\r\nreorganize the committees and subcommittees;\r\nstrengthen the Office of the Assembly President;\r\nstagger the work of the General Assembly throughout\r\nthe session; implement the resolutions adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly; and bring budget allocation into\r\nconformity with priorities.\r\nNepal reiterates its view that strengthening the\r\nOffice of the President has received short shrift so far.\r\nWe must reinforce the Office to make it more visible in\r\nstructure, more respectable in stature and more\r\nsubstantive in content. The President should have the\r\ncapacity and resources to do his task effectively,\r\nparticularly in following up the resolutions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nEffective implementation of the resolutions on a\r\nselective basis would enhance the primacy of the\r\nUnited Nations system. Today it is inconceivable to\r\nimplement the nearly 300 resolutions that are turned\r\nout each year. Only the existence of concrete results of\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.20\r\nthe work of the General Assembly will create a strong\r\nconstituency among people around the world, and\r\nstrengthen the most representative body of the United\r\nNations. We support efforts to link the budget with the\r\npriorities of the United Nations. We also underline the\r\nimperative to strike a balance between the requirement\r\nfor legislative control and the need for administrative\r\nflexibility in order to optimize the results of United\r\nNations activities.\r\nNepal supported the appointment by the\r\nSecretary-General of the Panel of Eminent Persons on\r\nUnited Nations-Civil Society Relations, under the\r\nleadership of the former President of Brazil,\r\nMr. Fernando Henrique Cardoso. My delegation thanks\r\nthe Panel for its hard work and its comprehensive\r\nreport containing valuable suggestions for improving\r\nmeaningful relationships between the world body and\r\ncivil society. We consider that improving such\r\nrelationships is also part of United Nations reform.\r\nEstablishment of a special fund to enhance the civil\r\nsociety of the South would certainly facilitate their\r\nparticipation in the work of the United Nations.\r\nParticipation of non-governmental organizations\r\n(NGOs) from developing countries is small, when\r\ncompared to NGO participation from developed\r\ncountries, and the former should therefore be\r\nincreased. My delegation, however, supports the view\r\nthat efforts towards increased participation of civil\r\nsociety should not change the intergovernmental nature\r\nof the General Assembly and other organs of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe consider that the report of the Panel of\r\nEminent Persons on United Nations-Civil Society\r\nRelations deserves serious and careful consideration by\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nLastly, the international community has the\r\nobligation to make the world a more peaceful,\r\nprosperous and just place for all. It has recognized that\r\nimperative in a number of global compacts, including\r\nthe Millennium Declaration.\r\nNepal is pleased to engage itself in reforming the\r\nUnited Nations and in helping the Organization to win\r\nthe minds and hearts of ordinary people around the\r\nworld. We believe it will help to formally establish the\r\nUnited Nations within a global public consensus. For\r\nthis, the world body must focus on implementing its\r\nresolutions and decisions by bridging the gap between\r\nits words and its deeds.\r\nMrs. Núñez de Odreman (Venezuela) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): On behalf of the Government of Hugo\r\nChávez Frías and the people of the Bolivarian Republic\r\nof Venezuela, I wish to pay tribute to the President of\r\nthe fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly and\r\nwish him every success in his leadership during the\r\nsession.\r\nI also take this opportunity to place on record our\r\nappreciation for the endeavours and accomplishments\r\nof your predecessor, Foreign Minister Julian Hunte,\r\nwho, by giving priority to the topics now before us —\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations system —\r\nstimulated significant progress which should enable the\r\nOrganization to become a more effective body for\r\nresolving the major problems of humankind.\r\nWe associate ourselves with the statement made\r\nby the Ambassador of Brazil, on behalf of the Rio\r\nGroup, in his capacity as Secretary pro tempore. We\r\nwish also to reaffirm the support and cooperation of\r\nour country in this very important mission of achieving\r\nour objectives efficiently.\r\nIt is vital that there be change in the United\r\nNations. We must make its political arenas available on\r\nan equal footing; revitalize the General Assembly as a\r\ndemocratic, deliberative and policy-making body at the\r\nhighest level in the Organization; develop the role of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council as an instrument for\r\ndevising development programmes designed to combat\r\npoverty; and together exert our efforts to democratize\r\nthe Security Council. Those changes will lead to\r\ngreater representation and institutional balance and will\r\npromote a social agenda.\r\nSuch change is even more imperative if we bear\r\nin mind the increase in the number of Member States\r\nof the Organization in recent times. In fact, today it is\r\nplain to see how little equity there is in the constitution\r\nof the principal organs of the United Nations; in\r\nparticular, in the case of the Security Council, the\r\ncurrent structure is unrepresentative. For Venezuela, as\r\nthe Assembly knows, the idea of the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council means making profound and radical\r\nchanges which necessarily includes eliminating the\r\nright of veto.\r\nWe have carefully read the report of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan, in response to the report of the\r\nPanel of Eminent Persons on United Nations-Civil\r\nSociety Relations, which notes the need to expand and\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.20\r\ndeepen relations with non-governmental organizations.\r\nThis may facilitate intergovernmental debates within\r\nthe United Nations on questions of global importance.\r\nBased on the proposals made by the Panel in its\r\nreport, a number of suggestions were made for the\r\nparticipation of non-governmental organizations\r\n(NGOs) in intergovernmental bodies. Venezuela will\r\ncontinue to study those proposals, which are designed\r\nto strengthen the participation of civil society through\r\nNGOs, with the understanding that within the United\r\nNations, Member States alone have jurisdiction to take\r\ndecisions, and that Governments are the interlocutors\r\nas regards relations between the United Nations and its\r\nMember States. Moreover, our country has not had the\r\nmost happiest experience with non-governmental\r\norganizations operating in the Americas, since those\r\nthat are controlled from the outside have been part of\r\nan imperial and transnational plan to destabilize our\r\ninstitutions in recent years.\r\nVenezuela acknowledges that the United Nations\r\nmust reach out in order to consolidate its coordinating\r\nfunction worldwide in the consideration of the various\r\nissues of interest to the international community. That\r\nopenness and interaction, however, must be the subject\r\nof more careful study so that we can assess their range\r\nof potential consequences.\r\nVenezuela supports and will work to promote all\r\ninitiatives to strengthen the role of the United Nations\r\nand respect for and observance of the principles of its\r\nconstitutive Charter. International security issues are\r\nfundamental and must be productively debated in this\r\narena, eschewing rhetoric, so as to address the root\r\ncauses of the dangers — that is, the real origins of the\r\nthreats to security. We have a broad and holistic vision\r\nof international security based on humanistic and\r\nmultidimensional criteria that combine social,\r\nenvironmental, economic, cultural and military factors.\r\nOnly such an integrated approach will allow us\r\ncorrectly to apply the norms that the United Nations\r\nhas developed to safeguard the rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms of humankind.\r\nWar and conflict can be avoided if people enjoy\r\nsecurity, manifested in adequate nutrition, health care,\r\neducation, housing and leisure. If those factors were\r\nguaranteed, the Security Council would become\r\nunnecessary. Prioritizing all those objectives would\r\nallow us to revitalize the Assembly and to strengthen\r\nthe entire United Nations system, which is necessary if\r\nwe are to meet the new challenges posed by current\r\ninternational circumstances.\r\nMs. Enkhtsetseg (Mongolia): My delegation\r\nwelcomes the combined discussion of the two\r\nimportant issues of strengthening the United Nations\r\nsystem and revitalizating the General Assembly, the\r\nfirst agenda items to be debated following the general\r\ndebate, where the majority of world leaders reaffirmed\r\nanew their determination to speed up the reform of the\r\nworld Organization so that it can effectively meet the\r\nemerging threats and challenges of the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nWe share the view that the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport, in response to the report of the Panel of\r\nEminent Persons on United Nations-Civil Society\r\nRelations, and the Cardoso report itself give us much\r\nfood for thought as we move on with the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMy delegation also wishes to thank the Deputy\r\nSecretary-General for her lucid introduction of the\r\nagenda items before us.\r\nMongolia shares the conclusion of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that expanding and deepening the\r\nOrganization’s relationship with civil society will\r\nfurther strengthen the United Nations and enhance the\r\nquality and depth of policy analysis for the\r\nintergovernmental debates on issues of global\r\nimportance. We welcome the major thrust of the\r\nCardoso report on the need to make the world\r\nOrganization a more outward-looking institution,\r\nwhich would help to connect the global with the local.\r\nIn pursuing those objectives, indeed, an effective\r\nmulti-stakeholder partnership has to be developed.\r\nHowever, as to the specific modalities of\r\nengaging with civil society and the other pertinent\r\nrecommendations put forward in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, the views expressed so far by the\r\nMember States suggest that further consideration and\r\ndiscussion are needed, while bearing in mind the\r\nundisputed intergovernmental character of the world\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe issue of strengthening the United Nations\r\nsystem is a multifaceted task encompassing, inter alia,\r\nthe restructuring, reform and revitalization of its\r\nprincipal organs, as well as the streamlining of the\r\nSecretariat. Among those, no doubt, the revitalization\r\nof the General Assembly and the reform of the Security\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.20\r\nCouncil are top priorities. On the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, my delegation will make a separate\r\nstatement, as we come to discuss the agenda item on\r\nthat issue in the plenary.\r\nIn moving the reform process forward, all\r\ncountries ought actively to participate and to display\r\ngenuine political commitment and determination, as we\r\nbelieve that the United Nations can be made as\r\neffective as we, the Member States, want it to be. In\r\nthat regard, Mongolia is eagerly awaiting the High-\r\nlevel Panel’s report on threats, challenges and change\r\nand ensuing recommendations by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, so that we can collectively engage in moving\r\nreform forward by taking bold steps as we\r\ncommemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations next year.\r\nOn the issue of the revitalization of the work of\r\nthe General Assembly, my delegation shares the view\r\nthat the General Assembly ought to regain its central\r\nrole as the chief deliberative, policy-making and\r\nrepresentative body of the United Nations. That should\r\nbe the main objective of the ongoing revitalization\r\nprocess, to which Mongolia has been and remains fully\r\ncommitted.\r\nWe highly commend the work carried out by the\r\nformer President of the General Assembly, Mr. Julian\r\nHunte, and his facilitators to revitalize the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The two resolutions — 58/126 and\r\n58/316 — adopted under his skilful leadership have\r\nproved to be by far the most far-reaching actions in\r\nmore than a decade. They have laid the tangible\r\ngroundwork for increasing the efficiency and\r\neffectiveness of the General Assembly. Significant as\r\nthey are, we should nevertheless aim higher and work\r\nwith vigour to further enhance the role and authority of\r\nthe General Assembly by undertaking truly innovative\r\napproaches in the months ahead.\r\nWe share the view that the recently introduced\r\npractice of holding periodic meetings between the\r\nPresidents of the General Assembly, the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council, as well\r\nas the measures designed to strengthen the Office of\r\nthe President and the institutional development of the\r\nGeneral Committee, are all important beginnings in\r\nenhancing the role of the General Assembly.\r\nFurthermore, the periodic submission of specific\r\nsubject-oriented reports by the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly on issues of current international\r\nconcern; increased interactive debates; better\r\nconceptualization of the contents of the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, including through the clustering,\r\nbiennialization, triennialization and elimination of\r\nitems; the reduction of the heavy volume of\r\ndocumentation; and the drafting and adoption of\r\nconcise, focused and action-oriented resolutions will\r\nhelp to further advance the ongoing process of\r\nimproving the working methods of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nIn that regard, we welcome the fact that the\r\nagenda of the current session of the General Assembly\r\nhas been divided into nine headings, corresponding to\r\nthe priorities of the Organization, with a view to\r\nachieving a better presentation of the issues and\r\nchallenges faced by the Assembly and to making its\r\nwork more accessible, in pursuance of resolution\r\n58/316. However, we also believe that no\r\nrationalization effort should in any way diminish the\r\nimportance of development issues on the agenda, as\r\nthey pertain to the economic and social well-being of\r\npeoples, on whose very behalf the Organization was\r\nfounded.\r\nOver the last decade, the General Assembly,\r\nthrough the adoption of its resolutions, has outlined\r\nspecific measures aimed at rationalizing its working\r\nmethods and improving its efficiency. All in all, those\r\nmeasures put more emphasis on the rationalization of\r\nthe agenda of the General Assembly and on improving\r\nits working methods. Although they have had a\r\npositive bearing on the functioning of the General\r\nAssembly, we believe that there is still ample room for\r\nfurther improvement to be made to the substantive\r\naspects of the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly — that is, enhancing its role and authority.\r\nIn that respect, my delegation is of the view that\r\ninnovative approaches need to be further explored in\r\norder better to monitor the follow-up of the resolutions\r\nof the General Assembly and, most importantly, to\r\nensure their implementation by Member States. Some\r\nthoughts and suggestions in that regard have already\r\nbeen aired by previous speakers that we believe merit\r\nfurther discussion and deliberation in the months\r\nahead.\r\nWe also look forward in that regard to the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on all aspects of the\r\nimplementation of resolutions 58/126 and 58/316, to be\r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly at its sixtieth\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.20\r\nsession. My delegation trusts that it will provide us\r\nwith actionable recommendations to further revitalize\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nIn conclusion, let me say that we believe in your\r\nleadership, Sir, and trust that you will successfully\r\nguide us to work collectively towards making the\r\nworld Organization better equipped to serve the needs\r\nof its Member States and to effectively meet the\r\nformidable challenges of today’s world. In so doing,\r\nyou can fully count on my delegation’s unreserved\r\nsupport and collaboration.\r\nMr. Wali (Nigeria): Nigeria welcomes the\r\nopportunity to take part in this joint debate. I wish to\r\nexpress the appreciation of the delegation of Nigeria to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his initiatives and\r\nefforts at strengthening the United Nations. Those\r\nefforts are in conformity with resolution 58/316 and\r\nthe declarations of the Millennium Summit, at which\r\nworld leaders pledged to invigorate the United Nations\r\nand to make it more effective in the promotion of\r\nworld peace and sustainable development. We also pay\r\nspecial tribute to Mr. Julian Hunte, the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session, for his\r\noutstanding work, particularly on the revitalization of\r\nthe General Assembly. Nigeria also aligns itself with\r\nthe statement made by the delegation of Algeria on\r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement on the agenda\r\nitem before us.\r\nThe United Nations has made significant progress\r\nin the area of peace and security in the last couple of\r\nyears as a result of its increasingly proactive role in the\r\nresolution of persistent and emerging global\r\nchallenges. That has greatly enhanced the image of the\r\nOrganization in the international community.\r\nConsequently, the peoples of the world and the\r\ninternational community now expect a lot from the\r\nUnited Nations. The reorganization and enhancement\r\nof the Department of Peacekeeping Operations,\r\nfollowing the implementation of the Brahimi Panel\r\nreport, have resulted in the improvement of the\r\ncapacities of the United Nations in the discharge of its\r\nobligations in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. As a result, the Organization can more\r\neffectively deploy and manage complex peacekeeping\r\nand peace-building operations.\r\nIn that regard, we commend the United Nations\r\nefforts in peacekeeping and peace-building in Sierra\r\nLeone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia\r\nand Côte d’Ivoire. We reaffirm our support for the\r\nintroduction of the rule of law, gender mainstreaming\r\nand a multidimensional approach to peacekeeping\r\noperations now adopted by the United Nations.\r\nNigeria commends the United Nations\r\ncommitment to the eradication of poverty, hunger,\r\nmalnutrition and diseases, especially the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic, malaria and tuberculosis. To build on those\r\nmodest achievements, we call on the United Nations to\r\nassist developing countries to achieve the ideals of\r\nsustainable development, in accordance with the\r\nMillennium Development Goals and the outcomes of\r\nthe World Summit on Sustainable Development and the\r\nMonterrey Consensus. We also call on the United\r\nNations and the international community to show the\r\nsame commitment they have demonstrated in the area\r\nof peace and security in addressing social and\r\neconomic issues in developing countries. In that\r\nregard, the United Nations should explore avenues for\r\nresolving the crippling debt burden on developing\r\ncountries, since the international community can no\r\nlonger afford a situation in which more than two thirds\r\nof its membership are incapacitated by the weight of\r\nexternal debt.\r\nThe linkage between peace and security, on the\r\none hand, and poverty eradication and economic\r\ndevelopment on the other should be reflected in policy\r\nstrategies and approaches of the United Nations on\r\nthose issues. The capacity of the United Nations in\r\nthose areas should be strengthened with the\r\ndeployment of the requisite resources for assistance to\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe United Nations is playing a commendable\r\nrole in building strong partnerships for conflict\r\nresolution and development. In that regard, Nigeria\r\nwelcomes the partnership between the United Nations,\r\nregional and subregional organizations, and non-State\r\nactors, such as civil society organizations, interest\r\ngroups, universities and the like.\r\nWe welcome the increasing participation of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs) in\r\nintergovernmental bodies. In that regard, it is\r\ngratifying to note that the General Assembly and the\r\nMain Committees continue to involve the NGOs in\r\ntheir deliberations, meetings and panel discussions. We\r\nhope that that healthy development will be sustained in\r\nthe interests and benefit of all. We therefore endorse\r\nthe Secretary-General’s recommendation and\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.20\r\nsuggestion on the increase in the participation of\r\nNGOs, particularly on improving the involvement of\r\nNGOs from developing countries as well as\r\nstrengthening the institutional capacity of the United\r\nNations for engagement with the NGOs.\r\nNigeria supports the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly to enable it to discharge its responsibilities\r\nmore effectively, as outlined in the Charter. That would\r\nalso enhance its capacity to respond promptly and\r\ndecisively to global threats and challenges. We\r\nreiterate our support for those measures already taken\r\nby Member States to reform the General Assembly. We\r\nare all beneficiaries of the improved coordination of\r\nthe work of the Assembly and the Committees and of\r\nthe regular meetings between the President and Vice-\r\nPresidents of the General Assembly, representatives of\r\nmajor groups, chairs of regional groups and\r\nrepresentatives of the Secretary-General, with the\r\nobjective of ensuring the better planning of\r\nconferences. We reaffirm our support for General\r\nAssembly resolutions 58/126 and 58/316, aimed at\r\nfurther revitalization of the work of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe note with satisfaction resolutions 58/316 and\r\n58/317, by which the General Assembly has reaffirmed\r\nthe central role of the United Nations in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nNigeria therefore calls on Member States to\r\ndemonstrate their commitment to those two and other\r\nUnited Nations resolutions by supporting the\r\nmultilateral process and the collective decisions of the\r\nUnited Nations. As the most important representative\r\nlegislative organ of the United Nations, the General\r\nAssembly should play its central role in the pursuit of\r\nthe objectives and purposes of the Organization. To\r\nthat end, the General Assembly should initiate more\r\ninteractive debates and discussions on critical issues of\r\ninterest on social, economic, political, peace and\r\nsecurity issues. There is a need to streamline the\r\nagenda of the plenary and to improve the working\r\nmethods of the General Committee in order to enable it\r\nto play a more active role in the work of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nOn the reform of the work of the Main\r\nCommittees, Nigeria holds the view that no Committee\r\nshould be singled out for reform, since the work of all\r\nthe Committees is linked and interwoven.\r\nConsequently, the reform of the Main Committees\r\nshould be carried out in a holistic manner.\r\nIn conclusion, Nigeria believes that the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations and the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly are long-term\r\nissues that require time and the collective efforts and\r\npolitical will of Member States. We therefore reaffirm\r\nour support for the efforts aimed at strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations and assure the Secretary-General of our\r\ncontinued and active participation in the process.\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): We wish at the outset to express the Syrian\r\ndelegation’s support for the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of brotherly Algeria yesterday on behalf\r\nof the working group of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\non reforming the United Nations and revitalizing the\r\nwork of the General Assembly.\r\nWe also wish to express our appreciation for the\r\nrole played by your predecessor, Sir, in managing and\r\nleading the deliberations of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-eighth session. We trust that, under your\r\nleadership, the Member States will complete the\r\nprogress towards revitalizing the General Assembly.\r\nThe Syrian Arab Republic has positively and\r\nactively participated in all the discussions on\r\nrevitalizing the role of the General Assembly. Our\r\ndelegation took part in the formulation of resolutions\r\n58/126 and 58/316, the appropriate, effective and full\r\nimplementation of which should be given the\r\nAssembly’s due attention. We believe that the\r\nAssembly should focus on following up and\r\nmonitoring those resolutions at this session.\r\nIt is worth noting in that respect that the\r\nimplementation of those resolutions has indeed come a\r\nlong way since the President of the General Assembly\r\nand the Chairpersons of the Main Committees and their\r\nbureaus were elected early in this session. Those\r\nelections have undoubtedly facilitated the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and its Main Committees, and we\r\nhave begun to feel their positive impact. Moreover,\r\nsetting time frames for the Assembly’s work facilitates\r\nthe work of many delegations.\r\nAt the forthcoming discussions, our delegation\r\nwill participate in the preliminary analysis of the\r\ncompleted phases of the revitalization process. The in-\r\ndepth evaluation of those phases will enrich our\r\ndiscussions with a view to helping us to develop our\r\nworking methods and to prepare for the comprehensive\r\nreview that must be held at the sixtieth session of the\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.20\r\nGeneral Assembly, in accordance with resolution\r\n58/316.\r\nSyria reaffirms its commitment to the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. We believe that\r\nthe philosophy of reform must be based on the\r\nfundamental principle that reforms are means of\r\ndevelopment and not a goal in themselves. The\r\ndelegation of the Syrian Arab Republic therefore\r\nbelieves that the revitalization of the General Assembly\r\nmust seek to enable the Assembly to play its leading\r\nrole as the most appropriate body for international\r\ndeliberations and the most dependable decision-making\r\ncentre. In that regard, we must focus on empowering\r\nthe Assembly to play its lead role as the highest\r\nlegislative authority among the principal organs of the\r\nUnited Nations, particularly the Security Council,\r\nwhose inflated agenda includes thematic issues that fall\r\nsquarely within the purview of the General Assembly\r\nand its Main Committees.\r\nIn that context, Syria believes that one important\r\nstep in the revitalization of the General Assembly’s\r\nwork is the search for ways and means to implement all\r\nof its resolutions. The implementation of its resolutions\r\nis one important element in promoting the Assembly’s\r\ncredibility and in helping it to resume its due role. The\r\nappeal to truncate those resolutions therefore has no\r\nserious place in the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly. Rather, it aims to minimize and distort the\r\nAssembly’s role by disabling an important aspect of its\r\nactivities. We must therefore fully implement and\r\nactivate the resolutions adopted by the Assembly and\r\ncreate the appropriate mechanisms for monitoring their\r\nimplementation. In so doing, we will take a firm step\r\nalong the path of revitalizing the work of the General\r\nAssembly and entrenching international legitimacy.\r\nSyria is closely following the work of the High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change,\r\nestablished by the Secretary-General. The Panel is\r\nentrusted with addressing current and future threats to\r\ninternational peace and security, as well as the\r\nprevailing situation of the main bodies of the United\r\nNations. It will offer recommendations for\r\nstrengthening their position and role. Syria will take\r\npart in the deliberations and discussions of the Member\r\nStates on the proposals and opinions to be submitted by\r\nthe Panel.\r\nIn the context of strengthening the United\r\nNations system, my delegation has read the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, contained in document A/59/354,\r\nconcerning the report of the Panel of Eminent Persons\r\non United Nations-Civil Society Relations. We note the\r\nSecretary-General’s recommendations in that regard;\r\nmy delegation will actively evaluate and discuss them\r\nwith all other delegations, giving due consideration to\r\nthe importance of maintaining the intergovernmental\r\nnature of the Organization as laid down in its Charter.\r\nMany delegations have focused on that issue in their\r\nstatements in the course of this debate.\r\nIn conclusion, we have not yet completed the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. Progress in\r\nachieving important results in that process must be\r\naccompanied by reform of the United Nations system\r\nin general in order to make it more democratic and\r\ntransparent and to guarantee adherence by all the main\r\nbodies to their mandates.\r\nMr. Latheef (Maldives): The United Nations was\r\nborn at the right time for the right purpose on the right\r\nplatform. There is no doubt that it has, over the past 58\r\nyears, performed well in achieving its objectives.\r\nHowever, today, the geopolitical map of the world is\r\nvery different from that of 1945. The technological\r\nrevolution and the globalization process have made the\r\nglobal village a single community demanding that the\r\nOrganization make increasingly complex and far-\r\nreaching decisions. That is the backdrop against which\r\nwe should approach reforms of our unique and\r\nindispensable Organization.\r\nMy delegation believes that the resolve of the\r\ninternational community for reforming and revitalizing\r\nthe Organization has never been greater. Almost the\r\nentire membership has expressed its desire to see\r\nsignificant change in the way the Organization does\r\nbusiness. No one in this Assembly will deny the\r\nrelevance of reforms and all have at one time or\r\nanother talked about it or expressed an idea or two on\r\nthe subject. However, all too often we have seen\r\nourselves stuck when it come to specifics. If we wish\r\nto make our reform efforts successful, then we should\r\nall be ready to exercise maximum flexibility and to\r\ndemonstrate our political will to restore the credibility\r\nand legitimacy of the Organization by giving\r\nmultilateralism the centre stage.\r\nMy delegation is convinced that, as a matter of\r\nprinciple, the General Assembly’s universality justifies\r\nits playing the most central role in the Organization.\r\nRestoring and maintaining the authority of the\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.20\r\nAssembly, therefore, is crucial if the Organization is to\r\nbe effective. We believe that the various proposals to\r\nstreamline and rationalize the agenda by biennializing\r\nor triennializing and clustering related agenda items\r\nwould enable the Assembly to focus more on the\r\nsubstance of the issues.\r\nWe also believe that fashioning the decisions of\r\nthe Assembly with follow-up mechanisms built into\r\nthem and ensuring consensus as a decision-making\r\ntool, where appropriate, would further strengthen the\r\neffectiveness of the Assembly. In that regard, my\r\ndelegation views the adoption of resolutions 58/126\r\nand 58/316 as a major step forward. The\r\nimplementation and effective follow-up of those\r\nresolutions are essential and should be given maximum\r\npriority.\r\nThe reforms implemented thus far in the\r\neconomic and social sectors of the Organization are\r\nalready bearing fruit. Greater transparency; the\r\ninvolvement of major stakeholders, such as the Bretton\r\nWoods Institutions and the World Trade Organization;\r\nand closer collaboration with civil society in those\r\nfields would, in our view, enhance coordination and\r\nharmonization more effectively.\r\nTaking advantage of the advances in information\r\ntechnology, in our view, can help the Organization cut\r\ncosts and reduce its reliance on paper documentation.\r\nIn that regard, we view the modernization of the\r\nconference facilities to be inevitable. Although the\r\ninitial costs of the conversion may be high, a modern\r\nstate-of-the-art conference facility would, in our view,\r\ngenerate savings and increase the effectiveness and\r\ncapacity of the Organization to service its membership.\r\nThe Organization should be well financed, well\r\nequipped and well structured at all times. Reforms will\r\nnot work unless they are backed by both financial and\r\nqualified human resources. Fulfilling our mandatory\r\nobligations of paying our assessed contributions in full\r\nand on time is therefore of vital importance. As long as\r\nthe financial flow of the Organization remains shaky\r\nand unpredictable, we cannot expect it to be effective\r\nin delivering its mandates.\r\nChange in the United Nations, created to address\r\nthe needs, hopes and aspirations of a fast-changing\r\nworld citizenry, is an inevitability we must all\r\nwelcome. There is no doubt that the more\r\nrepresentative the United Nations is, the more\r\ndemocratic it would be, and that the more accountable\r\nthe United Nations is, the more efficient it would be,\r\nthus benefiting us all, small and large, weak and\r\npowerful, rich and poor.\r\nMr. Savua (Fiji): The issues confronting the\r\ninternational community are enormous and complex.\r\nNew and emerging issues, including challenges and\r\nthreats, are added on every year. This year, the United\r\nNations is again inundated with a broad range of\r\nissues, ranging from hunger and poverty to security,\r\nterrorism and the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The burden has\r\nindeed grown much heavier. The United Nations is at a\r\ncritical juncture in its history and, indeed, at a\r\ncrossroads. Therefore, the call for the reform and\r\nrevitalization of the United Nations systems and\r\nstructures is timely and deserves our support.\r\nFiji, like other small island nations, attaches great\r\nimportance to the reform process and reaffirms its\r\nwillingness to be involved to ensure the improvement\r\nof United Nations systems and structures so that they\r\ncan ably meet the challenges placed before them by\r\nMember States and their peoples. It is heartening to\r\nnote, and also to our credit, that the reform has taken\r\nplace because of the timely intervention of Member\r\nStates, with the support and guidance of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Presidents of the General Assembly,\r\nand not in response to external pressures.\r\nThe United Nations must continue to be\r\nresponsive and evolve with the times if it is to remain\r\nworthy of its role, as enshrined in its founding\r\ndocuments. It must continue to be relevant to all,\r\nparticularly to small developing nations like Fiji, which\r\nlooks to the United Nations as a beacon of hope. The\r\nbiggest challenge therefore is to ensure that the reforms\r\nbring forth a rebirth of a stronger, independent and\r\nfully democratic United Nations, one which can\r\neffectively respond to the changing world but\r\ncontinues to retain the values that are central to human\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWhile Fiji, like others, looks forward with a lot of\r\noptimism to the outcome of the work of the High-level\r\nPanel, our interests continue to focus on development\r\nand the need to ensure that it remains high on the\r\ninternational community’s agenda. Whilst we totally\r\nagree that international peace and security and new\r\nemerging issues are important, that should, however,\r\nnot turn us from our resolve to tackle the central issue\r\nof underdevelopment. The United Nations needs to\r\nreassert itself as a key development agent wherein the\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.20\r\nformulation and implementation of important social\r\nand economic development decisions are made.\r\nOn the issue of expanding United Nations-civil\r\nsociety relations, the report of the Secretary-General\r\nand the Panel of Eminent Persons provide some\r\ndirection on effective partnership and relations in that\r\narea. My delegation is studying the two reports, but\r\ngenerally we believe that the ideas and\r\nrecommendations expressed in them need more\r\ndigestion and consultation before any substantive\r\ndecisions are made. While we are appreciative of the\r\nroles of civil society in furthering developing States’\r\nissues and agree to some extent with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendations, we would nevertheless\r\nsuggest that careful consideration be given to the\r\nextent of their involvement to ensure that the political\r\nmandates and decision-making capacities of Member\r\nStates are not compromised or their status eroded.\r\nWe believe that a challenging opportunity is\r\nbefore us to revisit the important issues before our\r\ninstitution. Whilst the reform is a never-ending\r\nprocess, the United Nations must assure its Members\r\nthat the current reform will be a milestone that will\r\ntake the Organization into the twenty-first century and\r\nbring forth changes that will be acceptable to all. We\r\ncertainly are mindful of the Secretary-General’s remark\r\nthat history will judge us harshly should we fail to do\r\nwell.\r\nMr. Danesh-Yazdi (Islamic Republic of Iran):\r\nThe revitalization of the work of the General Assembly\r\nand the strengthening of the United Nations system are\r\ntwo major interrelated issues on the agenda of the\r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly. We are\r\nconfident, Sir, that, under your able and wise\r\nleadership, our collective endeavours to address those\r\ntwo important issues will produce a positive and\r\nfruitful outcome. To that end, a great deal of effort has\r\nbeen made, but much remains to be done.\r\nAllow me not to miss this opportunity to express\r\nour deep appreciation to the former President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Mr. Julian Hunte, for his tireless\r\nefforts throughout the fifty-eighth session, which,\r\namong other things, led to the adoption of the two\r\nimportant resolutions 58/126 and 58/316. We consider\r\nthose resolutions to be a positive step towards reaching\r\na common understanding on these matters of high\r\nsignificance. We stand ready to support and participate\r\nin that very important endeavour.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement\r\nmade by the Ambassador of Algeria on behalf of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement on the agenda item on the\r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly.\r\nHowever, I would like to elaborate the position of my\r\ndelegation on the following points.\r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly,\r\nwhich is undoubtedly at the heart of the reform of the\r\nOrganization, should be perceived as a dynamic and\r\nongoing process. The two features of the process —\r\nenhancing the authority and role of the General\r\nAssembly and improving its working methods —\r\nshould be pursued simultaneously. In the process of\r\nrevitalizing the United Nations, the central position of\r\nthe General Assembly, as the most democratic forum of\r\nthe United Nations consisting of all Member States,\r\nshould be improved within the framework of the\r\nUnited Nations system and in line with the provisions\r\nof the Charter. Such steps will strengthen the position\r\nand enhance the effectiveness of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nResolution 58/126 prescribes a number of\r\nimportant and useful ideas for improving the work of\r\nthe General Assembly. The working relation between\r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly is\r\ngiven particular attention. As stipulated in the\r\nresolution, improving the quality of the annual report\r\nof the Security Council to the General Assembly and\r\nthe regular briefing of the President of the General\r\nAssembly by the President of the Security Council on\r\nthe work of the Council, as well as the convening of\r\nperiodic meetings between the Presidents of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council to ensure the increased\r\ncooperation, coordination and complementarity of the\r\nwork programmes of those three organs are key\r\nelements in the process of the revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Moreover, the importance of the\r\nbriefing of the Member States of the results of those\r\nefforts by the President of the General Assembly has\r\nbeen emphasized.\r\nOn the issue of the strengthening of the United\r\nNations system, I cannot fail to extend our appreciation\r\nfor the initiatives undertaken by the Secretary-General.\r\nIn attaching importance to the report of the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change, we believe\r\nthat the Panel was entrusted with a huge and daunting\r\nresponsibility and expect, accordingly, its\r\nrecommendations to be based on the real and objective\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.20\r\nforms of threats and challenges confronting the\r\ninternational community today. We are also of the view\r\nthat those recommendations should by no means\r\ndeviate from the fundamental rules and principles of\r\nthis universal Organization. Obviously, the Member\r\nStates will make the final judgement on the substantive\r\nand procedural aspects of those recommendations.\r\nEqually important is the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, contained in document A/59/354, in response\r\nto the report of the Panel of Eminent Persons on United\r\nNations-Civil Society Relations, in which the\r\nSecretary-General has suggested a number of\r\nsignificant recommendations that require our careful\r\nattention. We believe that sufficient time should be\r\nallocated for a thorough consideration of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals in order to remove ambiguities that\r\nseem to have overshadowed the thrust of the report. We\r\ntherefore wish to reflect on this issue in greater detail\r\nat another juncture.\r\nIn brief, we concur with the Secretary-General’s\r\nview that there is considerable merit in opening the\r\nregular work of the Assembly to increased\r\nparticipation by accredited non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs). To achieve that goal, we should\r\nnot lose sight of the intergovernmental nature of this\r\nbody. In our view, the accreditation of NGOs to the\r\nUnited Nations is one of the most important issue that\r\nneeds to be carefully dealt with. The proposal of the\r\nPanel on this issue has caused considerable discomfort\r\nand concern among many Members of the\r\nOrganization. The present situation may not be\r\nsatisfactory, but the comments of the Panel with regard\r\nto the work of the Committee on Non-Governmental\r\nOrganizations are not encouraging either. We strongly\r\nbelieve that the Committee, as a subsidiary body of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, is the appropriate forum\r\nto consider and approve the accreditation of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. It is unfortunate that the\r\nPanel failed to make meaningful proposals to reform\r\nand streamline the work of the Committee for the\r\nimprovement of the accreditation process of NGOs.\r\nOn the issue of simplifying the planning and\r\nbudgetary process of the United Nations, we take note\r\nof some important measures adopted at the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. However, due to\r\ncertain shortcomings of the document, the Committee\r\nfor Programme and Coordination was not able to\r\nrecommend approval of the proposed strategic\r\nframework for the period 2006-2007 and recommended\r\nthat the Assembly review the plan outline at its fifty-\r\nninth session. We believe that the plan outline should\r\nbe balanced by taking into account all relevant\r\nlegislative mandates, including internationally agreed\r\ndevelopment goals.\r\nWe hope that a revised strategic framework can\r\nbe linked to the budget outline and a reinforced system\r\nof evaluation and monitoring. We stress that the results\r\nof that comprehensive exercise should ultimately\r\nimprove accountability and contribute to effective\r\nintergovernmental participation in the process in order\r\nto ensure that the best results are achieved through the\r\neffective implementation of mandates.\r\nLast but not least, on the reform in human\r\nresources management, taking note of the omnibus\r\nresolution adopted by the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-fifth session, we hope that the continued reform in\r\nthat area can improve equitable geographical\r\ndistribution and the internal justice system in the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nMrs. Laohaphan (Thailand): On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, Sir, allow me to congratulate you, first of\r\nall, on your election to preside over the fifty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. With your able\r\nguidance, this session will certainly produce many\r\nfruitful results.\r\nToday, my delegation is pleased to address the\r\nissue of the revitalization of the General Assembly. In\r\nthat regard, my delegation wishes to pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General for his initiative in strengthening the\r\nOrganization and also to congratulate Mr. Julian Hunte\r\non his leadership throughout the fifty-eighth session of\r\nthe General Assembly, as well as his efforts to place\r\nemphasis on the revitalization of the United Nations,\r\nwhich have provided the impetus for today’s\r\ndeliberations.\r\nAs a member of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\n(NAM), Thailand wishes to associate itself with the\r\nstatement made yesterday by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Algeria on behalf of NAM.\r\nMy delegation believes that the General\r\nAssembly should and could play a constructive role in\r\nresolving international problems, as well as some non-\r\ntraditional security issues. It is on that premise that my\r\ndelegation therefore supports the long-standing and\r\nongoing process of revitalizing the General Assembly.\r\nThat is because the new challenges of the present time\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.20\r\nrequire a mechanism that is able to withstand and\r\novercome such challenges, many of which are\r\nunprecedented and were unanticipated when the\r\nCharter was adopted in 1945. Such a mechanism must\r\nbe able to function efficiently and effectively and be\r\nrelevant to the challenges it currently faces.\r\nThe revitalized General Assembly should, first of\r\nall, strengthen its role in solving problems related to\r\ninternational political, economic and social issues\r\nthrough increased synergy and coherence among the\r\nrelevant bodies of the United Nations, namely the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nSecondly, the role of the General Assembly\r\nshould not be overshadowed by that of the Security\r\nCouncil, as the matters taken up in the General\r\nAssembly are not limited to States’ security. Therefore,\r\nin addressing non-traditional security issues, the\r\nGeneral Assembly needs the full participation of\r\nMember States in the decision-making and\r\nimplementation processes.\r\nOver the past 12 years, 94 General Assembly\r\nresolutions regarding the revitalization of the work of\r\nthe General Assembly have been adopted, but fewer\r\nthan half have been implemented. The true\r\ncommitment of Member States is urgently required to\r\nensure the full implementation of our work towards a\r\nbetter future for this global Organization. My\r\ndelegation wishes to see the full implementation of the\r\ntwo important resolutions 58/126 and 58/316, which\r\nreflect the merits of another step towards the\r\nrevitalization of the Assembly.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to see that the working\r\nmethods of the General Assembly and the Main\r\nCommittees are undergoing improvements. The voting\r\nprocedure of the First Committee, for instance, serves\r\nas a good example of how the United Nations can be\r\nstreamlined. Moreover, The Main Committees should\r\nbe allowed to review their resolutions in order to\r\nchoose those on which they wish to negotiate. That\r\napproach would be less time-consuming and enable the\r\nMember States to focus on the resolutions that really\r\nneed attentive negotiations. For the resolutions that\r\nmerely require updates, a list can be made to identify\r\nthem and to provide details of their new information.\r\nMy delegation sees the merit of revitalizing the\r\nworking methods of the General Assembly by\r\nclustering issues for discussion in Main Committees, a\r\npractice that has been introduced in various Main\r\nCommittees. That approach would allow the Main\r\nCommittees to consider, simultaneously and in a less\r\ntime-consuming fashion, issues that are closely related.\r\nIn considering issues and resolutions to be\r\ndiscussed in the Main Committees, my delegation\r\nwishes to reiterate that documents to be used for\r\ndiscussion should be circulated well in advance of the\r\ndebate. Such early circulation will enhance the\r\ndiscussion, as Member States will have more time to\r\nexamine the issue as well as to discuss them with their\r\ncapitals.\r\nAnother point worth considering is the\r\nmechanism for following up the resolutions and\r\ndecisions adopted by the General Assembly. My\r\ndelegation is of the view that the sponsors and co-\r\nsponsors of resolutions should also play a constructive\r\nrole in following up any progress made before\r\nsubmitting a draft resolution on the same issue to the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its next session. Such\r\nresponsibility is meant to ensure not only the\r\nownership of resolutions, but also their full\r\nimplementation. Thailand is also of the view that a\r\nreview mechanism should be put in place to help the\r\nAssembly periodically to evaluate if the process of\r\nrevitalization has been carried out in its entirety and to\r\nreflect views and comments made by Member States.\r\nSuch a mechanism could be in the form of a\r\nconsultative group of interested Member States.\r\nHaving said that, it must not be forgotten that the\r\nprimary purposes of the United Nations are to promote\r\npeace and security, as well as to promote a\r\ndevelopment agenda. The States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations should move forward together and face\r\nthe challenges in unity and in a non-confrontational\r\nmanner. With those purposes in mind, the revitalization\r\nof the General Assembly should also be carried out\r\nwith the objective of enhancing those purposes.\r\nWith regard to the issue of strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations system, my delegation would like to\r\nexpress its appreciation to the Secretary-General for\r\nestablishing the Panel of Eminent Persons on United\r\nNations-Civil Society Relations, under the\r\nchairmanship of the former President of Brazil,\r\nMr. Fernando Henrique Cardoso, with a view to\r\nreviewing the existing practices concerning the\r\nrelationship between the United Nations and civil\r\nsociety. In that regard, my delegation would like to\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.20\r\ncommend the Cardoso report for providing a valuable\r\ncontribution through a number of recommendations for\r\nenhancing the reform of the United Nations, as well as\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General in response to the\r\nCardoso report, which also comes up with a number of\r\nimportant suggestions.\r\nHaving studied the report with great interest, my\r\ndelegation welcomes the recommendation of the Panel\r\nthat the United Nations should become a more\r\noutward-looking Organization. My delegation believes,\r\nin principle, that non-governmental organizations and\r\ncivil society could have more important roles to play\r\non various issues in the framework of the United\r\nNations and in today’s society. Their inputs, expertise\r\nand active participation have indeed proved to be\r\nessential in many areas. That issue deserves further\r\ndeliberation and extensive study to identify the most\r\nappropriate roles and their engagement in the linkages\r\nwith the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation also supports the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations to connect the global with the local.\r\nMy delegation believes that the fulfilment of a global\r\nagenda, such as the Millennium Development Goals,\r\ncannot be achieved by Governments alone. The\r\nparticipation of the public sector at all levels, including\r\nthe non-governmental level, is also a key to success,\r\nsince the involvement of that sector, as a stakeholder,\r\nwill be an important indicator of whether or not the\r\nGoals are being fulfilled.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation pledges its full\r\nsupport for the efforts aimed at strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations and revitalizing the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and assures the Secretary-General\r\nand you, Sir, of its continued and active participation in\r\nthe process.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to the Observer of the Holy See.\r\nArchbishop Migliore (Holy See): During these\r\nlast months, both public opinion and Member States\r\nhave rightly focused on the structure of the bodies of\r\nthe United Nations. Implicit in such a discussion has\r\nalways been the question of whether the Organization’s\r\nstructure and functioning are adequate to the Charter’s\r\ngoals and about the means we can count on to\r\nimplement them. It is precisely that meaning that we\r\nattach to the ongoing discussion on effective\r\nmultilateralism: the capacity to fulfil the tasks set out\r\nin the Charter, some of which have been highlighted in\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\r\nCharacterized by its universal membership, this\r\nOrganization must be adapted to equally universal\r\ngoals. We know from experience that the shape of\r\npolitical life and the influence exercised by public\r\nauthority are not always up to the task of promoting the\r\ncommon good. Today, the universal common good is\r\nconfronted with problems of worldwide dimensions —\r\nproblems, therefore, that can be solved only by an\r\nauthority possessed with power, organization and\r\nmeans coextensive with those problems and whose\r\nsphere of activity is worldwide. Thus, the bodies of the\r\ninternational community should be shaped so that they\r\nare capable of realizing the common good by ways and\r\nmeans adequate to changing historical conditions.\r\nUp to now, the debate has laid emphasis on a\r\nwealth of reasons, motivations and valuable reflections\r\nabout the institutional engineering of the United\r\nNations. In that respect, perhaps the main point we\r\nwish to restate is that structures must reflect functions.\r\nAs for the reform of the bodies, my delegation would\r\nlike to suggest some terms of reference.\r\nStrengthening the United Nations system implies\r\nthe acknowledgement that it is a system founded on\r\ncooperation among States, rather than on competition,\r\nand actively nourished by constructive will, trust, the\r\nkeeping of commitments and collaboration among\r\nequal and reciprocally responsible partners. Making\r\nthose founding principles irreversible is a primary task.\r\nThe bottom line is the recognition of the principle\r\nthat all States are by nature equal in dignity. We know\r\nvery well in this institution that, even though nations\r\nmay differ widely in material progress and military\r\nstrength, they are all conscious of their juridical\r\nequality. It is true, however, that the nations that have\r\nattained a superior degree of scientific, cultural and\r\neconomic development have the responsibility to make\r\na greater contribution to the common cause.\r\nOn a more practical note, several essential criteria\r\nshould be taken into account for reshaping the\r\nstructures and revisiting the procedures of this\r\nOrganization: representation and inclusiveness for the\r\nstructures; impartiality, efficiency and efficacy for the\r\nprocedures; and accountability and responsiveness for\r\nthe outcomes.\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.20\r\nThe legitimacy of the decisions taken in the\r\nUnited Nations, including the Security Council,\r\nultimately derives — as for any political body — from\r\ntwo pillars: the degree and scope of representation; and\r\nthe process of decision-making. Decision-making will\r\ntherefore tend, in general, towards greater consensus of\r\nopinion in deliberations.\r\nIt is clear that, for practical reasons, not all of the\r\nbodies of the United Nations can be arranged on the\r\nmodel of the General Assembly. This does not mean,\r\nhowever, that the set of principles and criteria to which\r\nI just referred are not applicable to the Security\r\nCouncil — quite the opposite: in restructuring this\r\nbody, one might consider that its composition should\r\nreflect, as far as possible the world population,\r\ngeopolitical regions, various levels of economic\r\ndevelopment and different civilizations. That list may\r\nnot be complete, but it includes criteria that are\r\nessential in order to improve the credibility and\r\nefficacy of a reformed Security Council. Finally, it is\r\nimportant to consider the actual capacity and political\r\nwill to contribute substantially to reach the goals that\r\nconstitute a priority for the overall majority of the\r\nMember States.\r\nAt the same time, as the Panel of Eminent\r\nPersons on United Nations-Civil Society Relations\r\nrecommended in its report to the Secretary-General, the\r\nUnited Nations needs to become a more outward-\r\nlooking Organization, capable of listening more\r\ncarefully to the needs and demands of the global\r\ncommunity.\r\nIn this context, we are reminded of the\r\nrecommendation of that Panel to connect the global\r\nwith the local. That criterion can be read as a modern\r\nversion of the well-known notion of subsidiarity, which\r\nwas a further landmark in the process of reform. In\r\nfact, because of their gravity, breadth and urgency,\r\nmost problems in today’s world are often simply too\r\ndifficult for the rulers of individual States to solve with\r\nany degree of success. At the same time, we must make\r\nit clear that the essential purpose of the United Nations\r\nis to create world conditions in which the public\r\nauthorities of each nation, its citizens and intermediate\r\ngroups, can carry out their tasks, fulfil their duties and\r\nclaim their rights in greater security.\r\nIt is our hope that the reform of this institution\r\nwill not only help us to realize our common goals, but\r\ninvest the United Nations with the necessary authority,\r\nin terms of credibility and moral legitimacy, to act for\r\nthe good of the global community. That is surely the\r\nprimary reason for the existence of the United Nations.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In accordance\r\nwith General Assembly resolution 57/32 of\r\n19 November 2002, I now call on the observer for the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union.\r\nMr. Johnsson (Inter-Parliamentary Union): I\r\nregret to say that the President of the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU), Senator Sergio Páez\r\nVerdugo, had to be in Chile today for an important vote\r\nin parliament. I am therefore delivering his statement\r\non behalf of the IPU.\r\n“I would like to refer to the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the implementation of the\r\nreport of the Panel of Eminent Persons on\r\nrelations between the United Nations and civil\r\nsociety, including parliamentarians and the\r\nprivate sector.\r\n“Perhaps I might begin by stating the\r\nobvious: parliaments are entirely different from\r\ncivil society and do not belong in that category. I\r\nbelieve that the need for a wholly distinct\r\napproach to parliaments was also recognized by\r\nthe Panel members after they began their work, in\r\nparticular when they resorted to the more\r\ntraditional term of non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs), as it appears in Article 71\r\nof the Charter, thereby clearly excluding\r\nparliaments.\r\n“That being said, I nonetheless welcome the\r\nscope and the vision of the Cardoso report. We\r\nbelieve that it is right in drawing attention to the\r\nneed for the United Nations to consolidate and\r\nexpand its working relationship with the\r\ninternational parliamentary community. There are\r\nthree reasons for this, on which I will elaborate in\r\nthe course of these remarks. The first is that the\r\ndemocracy deficit currently facing the United\r\nNations has to be resolved. The second is the\r\nneed to mobilize better awareness and more\r\nactive support by national parliaments for the\r\nwork of the United Nations. Finally, we believe\r\nthat it is imperative that the voice of the people,\r\nexpressed through their elected representatives,\r\nbe heard more clearly in this important body.\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.20\r\n“That is an idea that we in the IPU have\r\nbeen advocating for many years, and we have\r\ndeployed significant efforts with a view to its\r\nrealization, both within the Organization and in\r\nour respective national parliaments. Indeed, that\r\nis at the very heart of our mandate. The IPU\r\nmarshals substantive parliamentary support for\r\ninternational action, and, as the world\r\norganization of parliaments, the IPU is the only\r\nglobal institution that can mobilize parliamentary\r\naction worldwide. We do so by being in constant\r\ncontact with all parliaments.\r\n“Four years ago, the Millennium\r\nDeclaration recognized the need to strengthen\r\nfurther the cooperation between parliaments and\r\nthe United Nations and recommended that that be\r\ndone through the IPU. That was a result of the\r\nfirst Conference of Speakers of Parliaments\r\nconvened by the IPU, which had taken place here\r\nin New York just a few days earlier. During that\r\nConference speakers had pledged their\r\ncommitment and support to the United Nations,\r\nparticularly for achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, and voiced their\r\ndetermination to strengthen the parliamentary\r\ndimension of international cooperation, with the\r\nUnited Nations at its core.\r\n“In making that recommendation in the\r\nMillennium Declaration, the heads of State or\r\nGovernment recognized the role that the IPU can\r\nplay. Moreover, they did not seek to change the\r\nnature of the United Nations, which is, and will\r\nremain, an intergovernmental organization, and\r\nthey recognized that parliamentary action in\r\nrelation to international cooperation must first\r\nand foremost take place at the national level.\r\n“Turning once again to the Cardoso Panel,\r\nthe report is a cause of concern to parliaments\r\nand their international organization — the IPU —\r\nbecause it suggests that the United Nations, an\r\nintergovernmental institution, should create its\r\nown inter-parliamentary structures. That would\r\nobviously result in duplication of the work\r\ncurrently undertaken by the IPU. But, more\r\nimportant, it would run contrary to the principle\r\nof separation of powers between the legislative\r\nand the executive branch of government. To put it\r\nsimply, the IPU strongly believes that it is wholly\r\ninappropriate for the United Nations to consider\r\norganizing the work of members of parliament. If\r\nthe goal is, indeed, to bridge the democratic\r\ndeficit and bring the voice of the people closer to\r\nthe United Nations, then it is also important that\r\nwe get this right.\r\n“For all of those reasons, parliamentary\r\nleaders have taken it upon themselves to consult\r\nwidely in their capitals and within their\r\nparliaments on how best to bring forward the\r\nsubstantive recommendations of the Cardoso\r\nPanel. In practical terms, they intend to channel\r\nthese consultations through the preparatory\r\nmechanism for the Second World Conference of\r\nSpeakers of Parliaments, which they hope to\r\nconvene here at United Nations Headquarters in\r\nearly September next year, before the opening of\r\nthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nThey will thus be in a position to deliver to the\r\nAssembly the conclusions of their consultations\r\nin the second half of next year.\r\n“The Second World Conference of Speakers\r\nwill focus on multilateralism and the role of the\r\nUnited Nations. It will address issues like\r\ncooperation between parliaments and the United\r\nNations, but it will also make a progress report on\r\nparliamentary contributions to meeting the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Furthermore, it\r\nwill seek to develop a reference framework on\r\nparliamentary democracy. As always, we are\r\nworking closely with the Secretariat to make this\r\na successful joint event.\r\n“We have carefully examined the report by\r\nthe Secretary-General on the implementation of\r\nthe Cardoso Panel’s recommendations, and we\r\nlook forward to working closely with him and\r\nwith the United Nations, with a view to shaping\r\neffective mechanisms for stronger interaction\r\nbetween parliaments and the United Nations.\r\n“The 111th Assembly of the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union just completed its\r\nproceedings in Geneva last week. On that\r\noccasion, we met with the Executive Director of\r\nUNAIDS, with whom we have developed a close\r\nworking relationship over the years, aimed at\r\nbuilding a global focus for the work of\r\nparliamentarians on AIDS. Together, we have\r\nformulated and implemented a series of sound\r\nprojects, including the publication of a Guide for\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.20\r\nParliamentarians that focuses exclusively on\r\ndeveloping adequate legislation in the fight\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS, good practices and\r\nrecommended policies. New projects are in the\r\nmaking for the future, including setting up a\r\nspecial select parliamentary committee on\r\nHIV/AIDS at the global level.\r\n“Looking towards the high-level meetings\r\ncoming in 2005 and 2006, we have agreed,\r\ntogether with Dr. Peter Piot, to devote particular\r\nattention to the question of the role and\r\nresponsibility of parliaments in the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS on the occasion of the forthcoming\r\nIPU Assembly, which will take place in Manila in\r\nApril next year. The ensuing results, conclusions\r\nand recommendations will then be fed into the\r\nUnited Nations intergovernmental process, and\r\ncertainly will be brought to your attention here in\r\nthe United Nations General Assembly.\r\n“In conclusion, Sir, please allow me to\r\nthank you for your country’s leadership, not just\r\nhere in the United Nations, but also within the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union, where Gabon has\r\nbeen an active and valued member for many\r\nyears. The Speaker of the Parliament of Gabon\r\nwill be travelling to New York in just two weeks’\r\ntime to participate in our annual Parliamentary\r\nHearing at the United Nations. We ourselves will\r\nthen be travelling to Libreville in May 2005 for\r\nthe third and final preparatory meeting of the\r\nParliamentary Summit next year. As always, we\r\nknow we will be able to count on your country’s\r\nfull support.”\r\nThe President (spoke in French): We have heard\r\nthe last speaker in the debate on these agenda items.\r\nWith that last statement, we have, therefore,\r\nconcluded this joint debate on agenda item 52 on the\r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly, and\r\nagenda item 54 on the strengthening of the United\r\nNations system. These items, as the Assembly is\r\naware, are by no means new. They have been on our\r\nagenda for several years now. We have already devoted\r\na dozen resolutions to them, including resolutions\r\n58/126 and 58/316 of the fifty-eighth session, which\r\nhave been referred to by all of the speakers.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on civil\r\nsociety, which was introduced by the Deputy\r\nSecretary-General, Ms. Louise Fréchette, put forward\r\nspecific proposals that require our careful\r\nconsideration.\r\nFrom these declarations, we note the following\r\ncritical points regarding revitalization. The statements\r\nwere part of the continuation of the general debate,\r\nduring which delegations had specifically brought up\r\nthis issue. In addition to a general reference to the\r\nimportance of the role of the General Assembly and its\r\ncentral nature in the global context of the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations, two specific aspects emerged from the\r\ndebate – namely, the implementation of resolutions\r\nalready adopted and the continuation of consideration\r\nof outstanding questions.\r\nRegarding the implementation of resolutions, all\r\nthe delegations asked for the implementation of the\r\nprovisions of resolution 58/126 and 58/316 to be\r\nactively continued. The meetings between the\r\nPresidents of the General Assembly, the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council were\r\nrigorously supported.\r\nOn the same subject, I would like to recall at this\r\ntime, as I had already emphasized at the end of the\r\ngeneral debate, that the three Presidents had a meeting\r\non 30 September. Other meetings are already planned.\r\nThe outstanding questions deal, above all, with\r\nrationalization of the agenda and a reduction of\r\ndocumentation. Delegations requested that additional\r\nefforts be made to rationalize the agenda of the plenary\r\nand of the Main Committees, an agenda where the\r\ncategories coincide with the priorities laid down by the\r\nOrganization in its medium-term plan. In this respect,\r\nemphasis was placed on the central role that must be\r\nplayed by the Bureau. It was also stressed that the\r\norganization of the agenda should first be the subject of\r\nan evaluation by the plenary at the sixty-first session.\r\nSeveral delegations said that there was a need to see\r\nthat this organization of the agenda did not impact on\r\nthe Assembly’s capacity to carry out its work.\r\nDelegations also emphasized that the rationalization of\r\nthe agenda should be accompanied by a reduction in\r\nthe volume of documentation and the number of\r\nresolutions. It was, however, emphasized that such a\r\nreduction should not negatively impact the information\r\nneeded by Member States for consideration of various\r\nitems.\r\nBeyond revitalization of the work of the\r\nAssembly, the debate also underscored the need for\r\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council,\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.20\r\nreform of the Security Council and enhancement of the\r\nrole of the United Nations in general.\r\nRegarding relations between the United Nations\r\nand civil society contained in the Cardoso report, it\r\nwas recognized that the contributions of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs) are important for\r\nthe work of the United Nations. However, it is clear\r\nfrom discussions that the modalities for their\r\nparticipation and their contribution to the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly still need to be considered.\r\nSeveral delegations advocated a simplification of\r\nthe system of accreditation for representatives of civil\r\nsociety.\r\nA large number of delegations welcomed the\r\nexisting cooperation on the local level between\r\nGovernments and civil society on development issues.\r\nThe hope was expressed that this cooperation would\r\nalso be strengthened with the United Nations.\r\nHowever, several delegations advocated limiting such\r\ncooperation to the level of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. Moreover, numerous delegations supported\r\nthe suggestion for the creation of a special fund, which\r\nwas put forward by the Secretary-General, to\r\nstrengthen the participation of NGOs from developing\r\ncountries.\r\nAt the end of this debate, I now propose, with the\r\nBureau, to commence the broadest possible\r\nconsultations with Member States to continue the\r\nrevitalization process, aimed at strengthening the role\r\nand the authority of the General Assembly.\r\nI will keep the Assembly informed regarding the\r\ntimetable and the steps I shall be taking in this respect.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded the\r\npresent stage of consideration of agenda items 52 and\r\n54.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.50 a.m.\r\n"
