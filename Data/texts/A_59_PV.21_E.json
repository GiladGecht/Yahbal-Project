(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 10\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/59/1)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Members will\r\nrecall that the Secretary-General presented his report to\r\nthe General Assembly at the 3rd plenary meeting, on\r\n21 September 2004.\r\nMr. Van den Berg (Netherlands): I have the\r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The\r\ncandidate countries Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and\r\nCroatia, the countries of the Stabilization and\r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Albania,\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro\r\nalign themselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union wishes to express its\r\nappreciation for the concise but comprehensive report\r\nof the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization. The European Union shares the view of\r\nthe Secretary-General that the United Nations has had\r\nan extraordinary and challenging year, with ongoing\r\nand newly developing crisis situations. Clearly, some\r\nof the challenges have been around for longer periods\r\nof time, but in several cases we are making slower\r\nprogress in addressing them than the situation calls for.\r\nThe results, in several cases, have been mixed at best.\r\nThe political crises we are facing and the need to\r\nmeet the increasing demands for peacekeeping and\r\nhumanitarian emergencies can seem overwhelming, but\r\nit is essential that we meet the challenges. Several\r\nconclusions are clear. Conflict prevention and post-\r\nconflict situations need to be handled in a better\r\nmanner. Our joint efforts in combating terrorists and\r\nthe proliferation of weapons, in particular weapons of\r\nmass destruction, must be increased. We must all work\r\nfor worldwide respect for human rights, democracy and\r\nthe rule of law. We should not cease in our efforts to\r\nfight HIV/AIDS and other major diseases, fight\r\npoverty and the growing gap between rich and poor,\r\nboth between and within countries, stop global crime\r\nand redress environmental degradation.\r\nIn the view of the European Union (EU), the\r\nUnited Nations is uniquely placed to provide the\r\nframework for international cooperation. It has no\r\nsubstitute in the international community. However, in\r\norder to be more effective, the Organization has to\r\nadapt to changing conditions. This requires, most of\r\nall, an open and constructive attitude by its Member\r\nStates and a willingness to support change. But it also\r\nrequires an Organization that focuses on priorities,\r\nintensifies its internal cooperation, coordination and\r\ncoherence, improves its human resources management\r\nand strengthens its budget process and its\r\naccountability. The EU gave its views on these matters\r\nduring the joint plenary debate last Monday.\r\nThe EU itself is strongly committed to supporting\r\nthese efforts to strengthen the United Nations. It has\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\ncommitted itself to effective multilateralism as a\r\ncentral element of its external action. We believe that\r\nnone of the current international challenges can be\r\ntackled in an isolated manner or unilaterally. We\r\nunderstand that our security and development are\r\ninextricably linked to the security and development of\r\nothers.\r\nOur objective is the development of a stronger\r\ninternational community, well-functioning international\r\ninstitutions and a rule-based international order, within\r\nthe fundamental framework of the United Nations\r\nCharter. The United Nations is, in our view, at the core\r\nof such an international order.\r\nIn this regard, we must intensify our efforts to\r\nreach a consensus on changes in the institutional\r\narchitecture, in order to assure that our objectives in\r\nthe areas of peace, security, development and good\r\ngovernance are met. We considered the establishment\r\nby the Secretary-General of the High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change to be of the highest\r\nimportance. We look forward to discussing the Panel’s\r\nreport and the Secretary-General’s recommendations\r\nthereon in a constructive manner. We also look forward\r\nto the report by the Millennium Project and to\r\ndiscussing the follow-up to the report of the World\r\nCommission on the Social Dimension of Globalization\r\nand the report of the Panel of Eminent Persons on\r\nUnited Nations-Civil Society Relations.\r\nThe EU considers the high-level event at the\r\nbeginning of the 2005 General Assembly a logical\r\nculmination of this process. We see this event as a key\r\nopportunity to agree on or reaffirm fundamental\r\nprinciples and to agree on urgent measures to achieve\r\nall the commitments of the Millennium Declaration,\r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals. The\r\nevent should encourage progress in the implementation\r\nof the outcomes of the major summits and conferences\r\nin the economic and social areas, including, in\r\nparticular, the follow-up to the Monterrey and\r\nJohannesburg summits. The EU will present more\r\ndetailed views on this subject during our debate in\r\nNovember on the follow-up to the Millennium Summit\r\nand the follow-up to the implementation of the\r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits in the economic, social and related fields.\r\nThe EU welcomes the continued trend towards\r\nstrengthening partnerships between the United Nations\r\nand regional organizations in the shared pursuit of\r\npeace, stability and development in the various regions.\r\nIn particular, we wish to commend and support the\r\nenhanced role of the African Union and its peace and\r\nsecurity structures in the stabilization of regional\r\ncrises. The EU is aware of its responsibility as a\r\nregional organization in the areas of conflict\r\nprevention, crisis management and peacekeeping\r\noperations. The September 2003 Joint Declaration on\r\nUnited Nations-European Union Cooperation in Crisis\r\nManagement provided a framework for both\r\norganizations to develop practical avenues for\r\nexpanded cooperation. A joint consultative mechanism\r\nconsisting of a United Nations-EU steering committee\r\non crisis management activities oversees the\r\nimplementation of this Declaration.\r\nFinally, the Secretary-General mentions in his\r\nreport the crucial role that the United Nations has\r\nplayed in the establishment of the International\r\nCriminal Court (ICC) and the arrangements for the\r\ncommencement of its operations. Without the United\r\nNations, the ICC would not exist. The purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations and of the ICC are mutually\r\nreinforcing, and close cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the ICC should now proceed, on the basis\r\nof the relationship agreement that entered into force on\r\n3 October 2004. More than half of the United Nations\r\nMembers — 97 States — have now become parties to\r\nthe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,\r\nand we encourage an even wider ratification. The ICC\r\nis now operational, with two situations being\r\ninvestigated by the prosecutor. The EU recalls its\r\ncontinuous support for the ICC and the efforts of the\r\ninternational community to fight impunity. We are\r\nfirmly convinced that the Rome Statute provides all the\r\nnecessary safeguards against the use of the Court for\r\npolitically motivated purposes, and are committed to\r\npreserving the integrity of the Statute.\r\nLet me conclude by applauding the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his staff for the work they have\r\nundertaken in the past year, often under extremely\r\ndifficult circumstances, and for always acting within\r\nthe framework of the principles and purposes of the\r\nCharter. Allow me to remind Member States that we\r\nwill have to take decisions on a potentially major\r\noverhaul of the safety and security policies of the\r\nOrganization, both for Headquarters and in the field.\r\nThe EU looks forward to receiving the Secretariat’s\r\nreport on safety and security, and will support\r\nappropriate improvements in security measures. Let me\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nassure you that the European Union is, and will be, on\r\nyour side.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to the representative of Canada, who is also\r\nspeaking on behalf of Australia and New Zealand.\r\nMr. Laurin (Canada) (spoke in French): I am\r\npleased to address the Assembly on behalf of New\r\nZealand, Australia and Canada under agenda item 10,\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization. Allow me to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on behalf of our three\r\ndelegations, on your election as President of the fifty-\r\nninth session, and to assure you of our constructive\r\ncooperation and support in the year ahead. We also\r\noffer our congratulations to the Secretary-General for\r\nhis comprehensive report, which in so many ways\r\nreflects the quality of his own leadership, highlights\r\nboth the Organization’s successes and its shortcomings\r\nover the past year and underlines the challenges we\r\nface. These are challenges, which, in our view, are\r\nunprecedented in their scope and in their potential\r\ngravity.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nFor those of us convinced that a more just and\r\nsecure world requires effective multilateral institutions,\r\nthese are times of serious concern, including the\r\nconcern that, as we speak here today, human tragedies\r\ncontinue to unfold, most notably in the Darfur region\r\nof Sudan. Our peoples increasingly question why the\r\ncollective international will embodied in this\r\nOrganization seems so tenuous in responding, and why\r\nwe seemingly permit the mantra of sovereignty to\r\nshelter the abusers rather than the abused, including\r\nwomen and children, who are often the first and most\r\nhelpless victims.\r\nWe have jointly spoken previously in this Hall of\r\nthe responsibility of Governments to protect the people\r\nin their charge and of the obligation of the international\r\ncommunity to exercise that responsibility on a\r\ntemporary basis whenever that most fundamental of\r\nobligations is egregiously ignored.\r\nWe have many means at our disposal to prevent,\r\ndeter and respond to crimes against our common\r\nhumanity and to bring the perpetrators to account for\r\ntheir actions. The International Criminal Court, for\r\nexample, has an essential role to play in facilitating\r\njustice and accountability, particularly through the\r\nprinciple of complementarity, which is an essential\r\nfeature of the Court’s statute.\r\nWe live in perilous times. Armed conflict\r\ncontinues to take innocent lives in the Middle East,\r\nAfrica and elsewhere. The threat of the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction hangs over us. Terrorist\r\nacts continue unabated. It need not be so. We must do\r\nmore in this Organization by way of an effective\r\nresponse. We note with satisfaction in this regard the\r\nefforts being made to strengthen the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee.\r\nIn countries with their own tragic histories —\r\nSierra Leone, Afghanistan, Liberia, East Timor, and\r\nelsewhere — the United Nations is contributing\r\nsignificantly to the difficult but tentatively promising\r\nprocess of economic recovery and reconciliation. The\r\nUnited Nations can and should play a similar role in\r\nIraq to fulfil its mandate under Security Council\r\nresolution 1546 (2004), most critically through\r\nsupporting Iraqis in the holding of elections on\r\nschedule, no later than 31 January 2005.\r\nWe also take this opportunity to recognize once\r\nagain the military, civilian police and civilian\r\npersonnel in peacekeeping operations, both as\r\ndeployed in traditional blue-helmet missions — in\r\ngreater numbers than for many years — and in national\r\nuniform serving in missions authorized by the Security\r\nCouncil. We honour those among them who have made\r\nthe ultimate sacrifice in the cause of peace.\r\nAs the Secretary-General’s report on the work of\r\nthe Organization notes, last year this Assembly, for the\r\nfirst time, adopted a historic resolution on the\r\nprevention of armed conflict (resolution 57/337), based\r\non the Secretary-General’s earlier report on the subject\r\n(A/55/985 and Corr.1). It also endorsed the integration\r\nof conflict prevention across the funds and\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations system. We applaud\r\nthe Secretary-General for his leadership in taking this\r\nprocess forward.\r\nWe recognize, however, that threats take many\r\nforms, and for those whose nations are mired in\r\npoverty, whose populations must live and die with the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic on a scale others among us\r\ncannot imagine or which have suffered cataclysmic\r\nnatural disasters, national security has connotations no\r\nless serious even if the threats they face are different in\r\ncharacter.\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nOur three Governments are united in our\r\ncommitment to a broad concept of security in which\r\nthe security of the individual human being is\r\nparamount and must be addressed in a number of\r\ndimensions. In that respect, we share the report’s hope\r\nfor greater progress in attaining the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. We urge all Member States to\r\ncontribute to the efforts described in the report to stem\r\nthe flow of small arms and light weapons. We strongly\r\nendorse the call in the report for those States that have\r\nnot ratified the Ottawa Convention to do so promptly\r\nand for all States to participate in the first review\r\nconference of the Convention, to be held in Nairobi a\r\nmonth from now. And we are among those who share\r\nthe disquiet noted in the report regarding the\r\ndysfunctional elements of the United Nations human\r\nrights machinery, including the continued election to\r\nthe Commission on Human Rights of Governments that\r\nare themselves accused of gross human rights\r\nviolations.\r\nWorking to enhance our security in all these\r\nrespects are the civilian personnel of this Organization\r\nand those associated with it, in whose daily lives the\r\nelement of risk is increasing. We appreciate the\r\nmeasures taken thus far to deal with this serious issue,\r\nparticularly following the events in Baghdad last year,\r\nwhich took the lives of so many of this Organization’s\r\nvery finest. As the Assembly moves to implement\r\nfurther security enhancement measures — and we\r\nknow they will not be cheap — we owe it to those we\r\nhave lost and to those who follow in their footsteps, to\r\ndo our utmost to protect them and their families.\r\nIf there is a common theme in all of this it is that\r\nof unprecedented change and challenge. We must face\r\nthe fact that across our world today the United Nations\r\nis seen by many to be falling short of its potential and\r\nits purpose. The report, to its credit, does not shrink\r\nfrom this reality, while underlining that without the\r\ncommitment and support of Member States that\r\npotential cannot be realized.\r\nThe process of administrative and budgetary\r\nreform must continue and be accelerated. The United\r\nNations must reach out as never before to civil society,\r\nincluding the private sector, as underlined in the United\r\nNations Development Programme report entitled\r\n“Unleashing entrepreneurship: making business work\r\nfor the poor”, and the report of the Panel of Eminent\r\nPersons on United Nations-Civil Society relations\r\n(A/58/817 and Corr.1).\r\nPerhaps most immediately critical, however, in\r\nterms of the fork in the road of which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral spoke a year ago, will be our collective\r\nresponse to the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change. Its recommendations and the\r\nSecretary General’s response to them promise to be of\r\nhistoric significance. So too should be our collective\r\nresponse. If this Organization is to remain relevant, it\r\ncannot be more of the same. We must be prepared to\r\nmake difficult compromises and take bold decisions. If\r\nwe do not, history will move this Organization to its\r\nmargins. We cannot permit that to happen.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): Following\r\nthe general debate of the last two weeks, today’s\r\nmeeting, on the consideration of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/59/1), provides a further opportunity to debate\r\nissues of great importance and concern to the\r\ninternational community, as well as an opportunity to\r\nreaffirm our commitment to the central and\r\nirreplaceable role of the United Nations in meeting the\r\nobjectives for peace and development, as set out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nAn attentive reading of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General and a lucid analysis of his\r\nassessment of the achievements of the Organization\r\nover the past year lead us once again to the following\r\nconclusion: the pressing need for a strong and effective\r\nOrganization better able to serve the interests of States\r\nand people in this new era marked by increased\r\nglobalization, which in turn leads to the globalization\r\nof the concept of security.\r\nGlobal problems today are of such a scale and\r\ncomplexity that they can be solved only through\r\ncollective action founded on the values of solidarity,\r\nuniversality and multilateralism as embodied by the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe United Nations brings together almost all\r\ncountries of the world, and its activities impact on\r\nalmost all aspects of human activity. Those\r\ncharacteristics have made it a unique and ideal forum\r\nfor the exchange of information, the holding of\r\nnegotiations and the elaboration of standards and\r\npolicies, the expression of aspirations, the orientation\r\nof the conduct of States and other partners and the\r\nimplementation of collective action plans.\r\nMember States must do more than simply\r\nreaffirm the relevance of the United Nations. They\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nmust also ensure that the Organization performs its\r\ntasks as effectively as possible and act as a catalyst of\r\nchange in a rapidly changing world that is facing new\r\nchallenges.\r\nIn that context, Algeria hopes that the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change will be able\r\nto make innovative and consistent recommendations\r\nfounded on a stringent analysis of global threats to\r\ninternational peace and security and on an in-depth\r\nexamination of the institutions and mechanisms\r\nexisting within the United Nations. Therefore, Member\r\nStates must carry out an objective examination, without\r\ncomplacency, of issues related to the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations in the light of the conclusions and\r\nrecommendations to be issued by the High-level Panel,\r\nand must work constructively to implement the radical\r\nreforms that our Organization needs.\r\nWhile pursuing those ambitious endeavours,\r\nMember States must also bear in mind that the great\r\nstrength of this Organization lies in its legitimacy,\r\nwhich in turn is rooted in the fundamental principles of\r\ninternational law as accepted by all States and\r\nexpressed by the international community as a whole.\r\nIt is from that legitimacy that the United Nations is\r\nable to draw the authority required in order to ensure\r\nthat its decisions are respected.\r\nThe United Nations is more than a simple tool,\r\nfor beyond the varied fields of action in which it is\r\nengaged, its aim, as reflected in the Charter, is to\r\ntransform relations among States, to manage global\r\naffairs and to respond to the needs and hopes of the\r\nworld’s peoples. That immense task entrusted to us by\r\nthe founders of the United Nations some 60 years ago\r\nwill be fulfilled only if we work together in a\r\npragmatic and clear-headed manner. At the same time,\r\nwe must show creativity and daring by helping the\r\nUnited Nations to do its best to adapt to the global\r\nrealities of the twenty-first century.\r\nMy delegation would like to comment briefly on\r\nsome salient aspects of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, bearing in mind that in coming weeks we will\r\nbe addressing further important issues on our agenda.\r\nWith regard to peace and international security,\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General once again\r\nhighlights the fact that there are ongoing violent\r\nconflicts worldwide, which have cost millions of lives\r\namong civilians, have had an impact on neighbouring\r\ncountries and have endangered international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nAfrica has done a great deal to resolve the crises\r\nthat face it. But it continues to be the continent most\r\nsorely afflicted by conflict, as can be seen from the\r\nagenda of the Security Council. While we welcome the\r\npositive developments in the situations in Liberia,\r\nSierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and in the Comoros, other\r\nnascent and full-blown conflicts require our attention.\r\nIn the areas of preventing conflict, restoring\r\npeace, peace-building and peacekeeping, combating\r\npoverty and illness and promoting development,\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations is more necessary than ever before.\r\nTherefore, cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe African Union and subregional organizations on the\r\nAfrican continent must address the whole range of\r\nserious issues facing Africa.\r\nIn that context, Algeria particularly welcomes the\r\ncooperation of the United Nations in developing and\r\nimplementing guidelines for setting up the structures of\r\nthe African Union’s Peace and Security Council, in\r\nparticular by helping to establish the African Standby\r\nForce and the Union’s Military Staff Committee.\r\nThrough the African Union, the subregional bodies and\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD), Africa is now able to draw upon frameworks\r\nand mechanisms that are better suited to the kinds of\r\nproblems that we must solve.\r\nWith regard to combating the AIDS pandemic,\r\nmy delegation agrees with the Secretary-General that\r\n“[t]he fight against HIV/AIDS requires strong global\r\nleadership, effective global partnership and sustained\r\nglobal action” (A/59/1, para. 4). Algeria welcomes the\r\ninitiative launched by the World Health Organization\r\nand the Joint United Nations Programme on\r\nHIV/AIDS, which aims to provide antiretroviral\r\ntreatment for some 3 million individuals suffering from\r\nAIDS by the end of 2005. This is an initiative which\r\nwill make possible the survival of at least half of the 6\r\nmillion individuals suffering from AIDS in developing\r\ncountries, the majority of whom dwell in Africa.\r\nThe United Nations must continue its action in\r\nthe fight against terrorism. We are well aware of the\r\npersistent threat that terrorism poses to peace and\r\ninternational security. In this respect, we share the view\r\nof the Secretary-General that we need to combat\r\nterrorism while at the same time ensuring full respect\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nfor fundamental freedoms and human dignity. But we\r\nmust also emphasize that in resolution 58/174 the\r\nGeneral Assembly recalled the reference in last year’s\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the implementation\r\nof the United Nations Millennium Declaration to the\r\nfact that “[T]errorism itself is a violation of\r\nfundamental human rights and must be combated as\r\nsuch” (A/58/323, para. 28).\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General furthermore\r\nemphasizes the need for increased international\r\ncooperation to combat that scourge using existing\r\nmechanisms.\r\nAmong the counter-terrorism activities carried\r\nout during the past year, the Secretary-General recalls\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1535 (2004) on the\r\nrevitalization of the Counter-Terrorism Committee in\r\norder to strengthen its effectiveness while enhancing\r\nall the Committee’s activities to prevent and suppress\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe report also emphasizes that the Vienna-based\r\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, working in\r\nclose coordination with the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee, has provided technical assistance to more\r\nthan 70 countries in connection with the ratification\r\nand implementation of the 12 universal anti-terrorism\r\nconventions and the implementation of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001). It notes also that in\r\n2004 the connection between terrorism and organized\r\ncrime was discussed by the United Nations System\r\nChief Executives Board for Coordination.\r\nMy delegation welcomes all of these actions,\r\nwhich demonstrate the determination of the\r\ninternational community to combat this scourge. At the\r\nsame time, however, we feel that it is only through the\r\ndevelopment of a comprehensive anti-terrorism\r\nconvention that we will be able to put an end to these\r\ndangerous movements, which tend to lead to confusion\r\nbetween the legitimate liberation struggle of peoples\r\nand the terrible phenomenon of terrorism.\r\nMr. Sychov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The\r\nRepublic of Belarus views the past year as having been\r\na period of difficult and intensive work by our\r\nOrganization, its agencies and its institutions. The\r\nSecretary-General has repeatedly drawn our attention\r\nto the fact that the range of challenges facing the\r\nOrganization is constantly expanding, and that their\r\ncomplexity and their importance for the international\r\ncommunity are constantly increasing.\r\nWe believe in the Organization’s ability to\r\nconsiderably strengthen its lead coordinating role in\r\nmobilizing the efforts of Member States when\r\nconfronting new challenges and threats. In that regard,\r\nwe welcomed the Security Council’s adoption of its\r\nresolution 1535 (2004), which formed the basis for the\r\ncreation of the Counter-Terrorism Committee\r\nExecutive Directorate, which includes a special office\r\nfor providing technical assistance to States. We hope\r\nthat these structural reforms will help strengthen the\r\noperational coordination between the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee and Governments, thus\r\nimproving the impact of the Committee’s work.\r\nAn important step in the work of the Organization\r\nwas the Security Council’s adoption of its resolution\r\n1540 (2004), by which we are taking a new approach to\r\nthe question of the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction by linking that problem to the growth in the\r\nterrorist threat. For that resolution to be successfully\r\nimplemented, in is important that States submit\r\ncomprehensive national reports. For our part, the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Belarus intends to\r\nsubmit our national report on time.\r\nThe Secretary-General has drawn our attention to\r\nthe surge in the number of local conflicts and the\r\nincreased demand for United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations. The setting up of new operations and the\r\nincreased scale of current ones require increased\r\nactivity by the relevant Secretariat units and place a\r\nheavy burden on the financial resources of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nIn our view, we should tackle this situation in two\r\nways. First, there is a need to enhance the participation\r\nof interested regional associations and organizations\r\nwhich can effectively organize and carry out\r\npeacekeeping activities. In particular, we welcome the\r\nAfrican Union’s desire to take an increasingly active\r\nrole in peacekeeping operations, specifically in Africa.\r\nHowever, the United Nations should coordinate and\r\ndirect peacekeeping activities carried out by regional\r\norganizations.\r\nSecondly, it is important to organize, with the\r\nhelp of the most economically powerful States, large-\r\nscale training of potential peacekeepers for interested\r\nregional organizations and developing countries. In\r\nthat context, it is important to note that during the\r\ngeneral debate, a number of far-reaching initiatives\r\nwere proposed for a rational, pragmatic approach.\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nMy country has great military and civilian\r\npotential and is interested in expanding its participation\r\nin United Nations peacekeeping operations. It is taking\r\npractical steps to establish a legal basis for such\r\nparticipation and for training peacekeeping personnel.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Belarus\r\nsupports strengthening the role of the United Nations\r\nin the political reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan\r\nin the light of the preparations for national\r\nparliamentary and presidential elections in those war-\r\naffected countries. The United Nations has great\r\nexperience in organizing democratic elections in post-\r\nconflict countries and can make a valuable contribution\r\nto the post-war reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan.\r\nWe note with regret that the United Nations has\r\nnot yet been able to make a significant impact on the\r\nprocess of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and\r\nimplementing the road map. In that connection, we call\r\non the Secretary-General to intensify his mediation\r\nactivities in that area in order to resolve the most\r\nproblematic issues between the parties to the conflict.\r\nWe welcome the Organization’s work in\r\nprotecting human rights and fundamental freedoms,\r\nand we welcome the work of the Commission on\r\nHuman Rights. In that context, we can only agree with\r\nthe Secretary-General with respect to the high level of\r\npoliticization of the Commission’s debates and the fact\r\nthat a selective approach is taken in considering\r\nsituations involving human rights violations. The\r\nRepublic of Belarus has repeatedly stated its position\r\nof principle on this issue. We share and support the\r\ndesire of most members of the Commission to avoid\r\nunnecessary politicization of the Commission’s work\r\nso that it can carry out its functions as the principal\r\nhuman rights body of the United Nations, able to\r\nrespond promptly, effectively and even-handedly to the\r\nnew challenges with respect to massive violations of\r\nhuman rights. Only by adopting a constructive\r\napproach and renouncing double standards can the\r\nglobal human rights situation be improved.\r\nOur delegation commends the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations to promote the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and to incorporate them into the\r\nactivities of the main bodies of the United Nations\r\nsystem. We hope that the General Assembly’s high-\r\nlevel meeting in 2005 will conduct a thorough analysis\r\nof the five years of implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and of the outcomes of the major United\r\nNations conferences in the economic, social and related\r\nfields.\r\nAt the same time, we are concerned that in\r\nimplementing the Millennium Development Goals,\r\npriority attention has gone to the social and\r\nhumanitarian goals, while economic issues have been\r\ngiven lower priority. Without denying the urgent\r\nimportance of resolving social and humanitarian\r\nproblems, we are convinced that Governments,\r\nMember States and international organizations in the\r\nUnited Nations system need to step up their efforts to\r\nmeet the economic challenges set out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. Creating favourable\r\nconditions for sustainable development is vital to\r\neradicating hunger and poverty, ensuring respect for\r\nhuman rights, mitigating the threat of terrorism,\r\npreventing armed conflict and eliminating dangerous\r\nepidemics.\r\nIt will be impossible to overcome those\r\nchallenges without a revitalized, institutionally strong\r\nand effectively functioning United Nations whose\r\nactivities are founded on the principles of\r\nmultilateralism in international relations, the rule of\r\nlaw in international affairs and collective and fair\r\nsolutions to global problems. In that regard, the\r\ndelegation of Belarus calls upon Member States to\r\nadopt a well-balanced approach to the forthcoming\r\nreport of the Secretary-General’s recently established\r\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change.\r\nWe express our readiness to cooperate closely\r\nwith other delegations to find common approaches to\r\nthe major problems related to establishing a new\r\ninternational order.\r\nMr. Aboul Atta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, my delegation thanks the Secretary-General and\r\nthe Secretariat for their efforts towards achieving the\r\nOrganization’s objectives as defined in the Charter and\r\nby the resolutions adopted by Member States.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work\r\nof the Organization (A/59/1) discusses very important\r\nissues deserving of our attention. We wish to comment\r\non them, but time constraints oblige us to concentrate\r\non just a few. The Egyptian position on all issues\r\ncovered in the report will be expressed during the\r\ndiscussion of the individual items of the agenda of the\r\nfifty-ninth session in plenary meetings and in the Main\r\nCommittees. Today, I shall touch on the following\r\nissues.\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nFirst, even a cursory glance at the situation in the\r\noccupied Palestinian territory and the report’s\r\ndiscussion of the issue reflect a single truth. Despite\r\nthe constant efforts of the international community and\r\nparties in the region, notably including Egypt, the\r\nhumanitarian situation in the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritory has worsened, and the resolutions adopted are\r\nnot being implemented. There are occasional glimmers\r\nof hope that agreements concluded and initiatives\r\nadopted will be implemented, but realities on the\r\nground undermine that hope. That is so because the\r\noccupying Power is not committed to the principles of\r\ninternational law. It has not heeded the advisory\r\nopinion of the International Court of Justice and\r\nignores the Fourth Geneva Convention and the\r\nprovisions of international humanitarian law.\r\nSecondly, we note that the Organization has\r\nstepped up its peace-building activities. That has led to\r\nadministrative difficulties for the Organization. It is\r\nimportant to develop a rapid response capability for\r\ndealing with crises as soon as they emerge. We need an\r\nintegrated strategy, including all related elements and\r\nclear timelines, for the various phases of peacekeeping,\r\npeace-building and capacity-building in countries in\r\nconflict. That would enable Member States to\r\nanticipate the human and material resources needed for\r\nsuch operations.\r\nThat issue is very important because it directly\r\naffects the safety and security of United Nations\r\npersonnel. And that in turn is important to us because\r\nUnited Nations personnel is a treasure valued by all.\r\nWe believe that we cannot provide security if we spend\r\nenormous amounts of money without having a clear\r\nplan rooted in a solid culture of security, with an\r\nadministrative approach including a clear chain of\r\ncommand, specific responsibilities, expertise and\r\ncompetencies ensuring high-level performance in this\r\nvery important field. Therefore, we must undertake a\r\ncomprehensive review of the Organization’s\r\ncapabilities and expertise in this area, making use of\r\nthe conclusions of the many committees that have been\r\ncreated, the expert studies done and the reviews carried\r\nout. That approach was endorsed by the General\r\nAssembly at its previous session and constitutes a very\r\nimportant contribution that must be taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\nThirdly, terrorism is still a threat to international\r\npeace and security and that requires more efficient\r\naction by the international community. Here we would\r\nlike to emphasize the important role undertaken by all\r\nof the multilateral international bodies — in particular\r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly — on\r\nthe basis of complementarity rather than competition\r\nand within the context of emphasizing the\r\nresponsibilities entrusted to each of them in accordance\r\nwith the Charter.\r\nFourthly, we welcome the efforts made by the\r\nSpecial Adviser on Africa and his Office in presenting\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) and mobilizing international support and\r\nefforts to bring about its objectives. We would like to\r\nunderline the importance of supporting that office with\r\nthe human and material resources needed to achieve its\r\nobjective.\r\nWe have noted that, despite the efforts made by\r\nthe Organization, concrete steps to implement specific\r\nprogrammes and projects that have been set up with\r\nwithin the context of NEPAD, have not received the\r\nnecessary priority within the framework of\r\ndevelopment policies for Africa, by donor States.\r\nWe look forward to revitalizing the interaction\r\nbetween the United Nations, as manifested by the\r\nOffice of the Special Adviser, and the many initiatives\r\nmade individually, or by many other bodies, in order to\r\nbring about efficient and effective projects and\r\nprogrammes in the areas of social, environmental and\r\neconomic development, and peace and security.\r\nTherefore, we should try to avoid double\r\nstandards and diversion of international interest so we\r\ncan bring about development in Africa as set forth in\r\nthe NEPAD Initiative.\r\nFifthly and finally, we would like to make the\r\nfollowing preliminary remarks concerning the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations. First, the\r\nproposed programme budget of the Organization must\r\nreflect the priorities in the medium term plan, as they\r\nare more comprehensive. We should provide the\r\nnecessary funding for all of the activities endorsed by\r\nthe Member States.\r\nSecondly, developing the work of the\r\nOrganization is a matter that should be left to the\r\nleadership of the Member States and to what they agree\r\non. It should be done with a clear view of the\r\nresponsibilities of those who are involved.\r\nThirdly, the concepts of transparency,\r\naccountability and assessment must be supported\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nwithin the Organization at all levels in order to\r\nguarantee the work efficiency to which all of us at the\r\nUnited Nations look forward.\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): In his report on the work of\r\nthe Organization the Secretary General described the\r\npast year as an extraordinarily challenging year for the\r\nUnited Nations. Our delegation agrees that there have\r\nbeen great difficulties and in the circumstances we\r\nshould congratulate the Secretary-General for his\r\nstewardship and for guiding the Organization in the\r\nimplementation of its various mandates. Although\r\nthere have been mixed results, the overall picture is\r\none of an organization that has remained engaged and\r\nactive where the needs have arisen.\r\nPrevailing conditions have not been helpful for\r\nthe maintenance of peace and security. The cycle of\r\nwar and violence regrettably continued unabated,\r\ndamaging the prospects for stability and peace, while\r\ndoctrines promoting military power and the use of\r\nforce, and the upsurge of terrorism have served to\r\nundermine the fabric of international security.\r\nThe conflicts in the Middle East and in Africa\r\nhave been the most prominent. In Iraq the role of the\r\nUnited Nations has been limited despite the adoption\r\nof Security Council resolution 1546 (2004). The\r\nSecretary-General has been justifiably cautious, as the\r\nprevailing security situation has made it too risky for a\r\nmore ambitious programme for United Nations\r\ninvolvement. The major responsibility will lie in the\r\nhands of the coalition forces to rebuild Iraq. In the\r\nmeantime, efforts will have to be concentrated on\r\nestablishing a political framework for ensuring stability\r\nand security. Until that is achieved, it is difficult to see\r\nhow the United Nations role could be enlarged.\r\nIn the Middle East the situation has continued to\r\ndeteriorate over the past year, and events have\r\nconfirmed the need for a more even-handed approach\r\nin order to advance a settlement based on justice and\r\nlegality. Judging from the events of the past year, the\r\nQuartet has not been fulfilling that role or exercising\r\nthe influence that is needed.\r\nIn Africa there have been some positive\r\ndevelopments over the year but the recent events in\r\nDarfur in the Sudan have led to a new crisis. We\r\ncommend the Secretary-General for his efforts and\r\nwelcome the collaboration that has developed with the\r\nAfrican Union in seeking a solution.\r\nIn other areas of tension and conflict, it is quite\r\nevident that the United Nations has been active and we\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for his quiet\r\ndiplomacy, which has helped to avoid the outbreak of\r\nhostilities, promote reconciliation and encourage the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nThe work of the United Nations peacekeepers and\r\npeace-builders has continued to multiply, with a total\r\nof 16 missions now in the field with the addition of\r\nthose in Haiti, Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire and Burundi.\r\nObviously, the growing number and scale of the\r\noperations pose a challenge to the Organization’s\r\ncapacity to provide sustainable support for such\r\noperations.\r\nWhat is of utmost importance is to ensure that\r\nthere is an exit strategy that can be implemented\r\nwithout risking a relapse into conflict. National\r\nrecovery and assistance in strengthening the social and\r\neconomic underpinnings of war-torn societies continue\r\nto be necessary to ensure the durability of peace and\r\nstability.\r\nWe are still hopeful about the situation in Haiti,\r\nbut anxieties have increased because of the unsettled\r\nsecurity situation, political uncertainties and setbacks\r\ncaused by the hurricane disaster.\r\nWe believe that greater urgency should be\r\nintroduced in mobilizing the resources from the $1.3\r\nbillion package of pledges to go towards political,\r\nsocial and economic needs. As far as the political\r\nsituation is concerned, while we do not fully share the\r\nSecretary-General’s assessment in paragraph 58 of his\r\nreport, we support his insistence on the need for the\r\nUnited Nations to remain engaged for the long term,\r\nboth politically and financially.\r\nIn the field of disarmament, there is a clear need\r\nto revitalize the Conference on Disarmament, whose\r\nwork has been stalled in an atmosphere of weakened\r\npolitical commitment to disarmament efforts. The\r\ngrowth of military expenditures and the promotion of\r\nmilitarism have undermined the political will to move\r\nforward. That is a contributing factor to proliferation,\r\nas a non-proliferation regime can only succeed where\r\nmutual and reciprocal obligations are honoured and\r\nwhere the principle of non-discrimination is upheld.\r\nThe dangers of proliferation are increased by the\r\nupsurge of terrorism in recent times. We all have an\r\nobligation to confront that challenge but too much\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nemphasis is being placed on military operations. Our\r\nview is that a successful campaign requires a more\r\nserious effort to eliminate the root causes of terrorism.\r\nConditions of injustice, deprivation or oppression,\r\nwhich are conducive to the development of extremist\r\nideas and activities, require our full attention.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his statement on 28\r\nSeptember, rightly emphasized the importance of the\r\nrule of law, which is increasingly at risk around the\r\nworld. At the national level, it is an important aspect of\r\nthe stability and survival of States and, similarly, at the\r\nlevel of world order. The Organization has created an\r\nimportant body of norms and laws and it is the duty of\r\nall States to uphold legality in international relations.\r\nThis applies to all.\r\nThe United Nations should never accept or\r\ntolerate double standards, selectivity or discriminatory\r\npractices. They violate principles of justice and equal\r\nrights, which is an important basis for cooperation and\r\nstability in the international system.\r\nIn the area of humanitarian commitments, the\r\nwork and achievements of the United Nations over the\r\npast year have been solid and commendable. The report\r\namply shows how much has been accomplished in\r\nrelation to assistance to refugees and relief during\r\nhumanitarian emergencies.\r\nObviously, not all needs have been met. As the\r\nSecretary-General tells us, the Organization has been\r\noperating in a situation of underfunding, which has\r\npersisted all year. We are disappointed to learn that,\r\nboth in absolute and proportional terms, funding was\r\nlower than for the same period in 2003. We support the\r\nSecretary-General’s initiatives to promote and secure\r\ngreater resources, so that hardship and suffering can be\r\nreduced, especially among the vulnerable groups.\r\nThe work of the United Nations in promoting\r\ndevelopment cooperation is of particular importance\r\nfor developing countries. The work done by the various\r\nagencies in operational activities has been an important\r\nsource of development assistance and we urge that as\r\nmuch of the resources as is available be deployed in\r\nimplementing concrete projects and programmes. It is\r\nimportant to avoid excessive preoccupation with\r\ndesigning frameworks and integrated systems, which\r\nonly increase the bureaucratic component and reduce\r\nthe resources available for programme delivery.\r\nFrom reading the report, we feel that there is need\r\nto give greater impetus to efforts for sustainable\r\ndevelopment and achievement of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Regrettably, there are signs that\r\nthose objectives may increasingly be overshadowed by\r\nthe preoccupation with terrorism and security issues.\r\nWe particularly hope that the United Nations will\r\ngive special attention to the special needs of the\r\ndisadvantaged, to the least development countries, the\r\nlandlocked States and the small island developing\r\nStates. In the case of the latter, the review of the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action, which has been\r\npostponed until next year, should receive the full\r\nsupport of the Secretariat in ensuring that the\r\nConference and its outcome will achieve positive\r\nresults.\r\nIn general, Jamaica believes that, in the area of\r\ninternational economic cooperation, more needs to be\r\ndone by the United Nations to coordinate international\r\npolicies. There is also the need for institutional\r\nstrengthening for that purpose. A democratic forum is\r\nneeded to coordinate international policies relating to\r\nfinance, trade and technology. It should be capable of\r\napplying remedies to correct global imbalances and of\r\nresponding to crises. We should regard that as an\r\nimportant part of what should be the outcome of the\r\nSummit during the sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe international legal order has continued to\r\nevolve in a positive direction with the creation of new\r\nlegal regimes, but the problem of gaining universality\r\nhas dampened some of its success. The instruments of\r\ninternational cooperation are important in\r\nstrengthening multilateralism and all should join in.\r\nIn the case of the International Criminal Court\r\n(ICC) and the international Tribunals, it is important\r\nfor the integrity of the system that perpetrators of war\r\ncrimes are not sought only in developing countries. To\r\nhave credibility the system should apply to everyone\r\nand it is weakened if exceptions are allowed. That\r\nprinciple applies even more broadly to the field of\r\nhuman rights protection and it would be unfortunate\r\nfor the United Nations system if the same standards did\r\nnot apply to all.\r\nRegrettably, cases have arisen leading to charges\r\nof selective treatment and double standards. That is\r\ndamaging to the image of the United Nations. The\r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nand the Commission on Human Rights should be\r\nvigilant in maintaining uniform standards and equal\r\nrequirements and should avoid politicization, which\r\nweakens the influence of the United Nations in the\r\npromotion of human rights.\r\nIn relation to the management of the Secretariat,\r\nwe commend the Secretary-General for the reforms\r\nimplemented since 1997, which have progressed\r\nreasonably well with the introduction of management\r\npractices to improve the effectiveness of the system.\r\nThe two-year budget cycle is now in place and\r\nwe are looking forward to receiving the first proposed\r\nstrategic framework for the 2006-2007 biennium,\r\nwhich is expected to be submitted sometime during this\r\nsession.\r\nWe understand that the Secretary-General is\r\nseeking a larger and more substantive programme of\r\nreform based on the recommendations of the Panel of\r\nEminent Persons, which is expected to be submitted to\r\nthe Secretary-General this year. We hope the report\r\nwill form a firm basis for reform and revitalization of\r\nthe United Nations to meet the challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nJamaica will be ready to consider the report and\r\nits recommendations and we will make our\r\ncontribution when it is put before us.\r\nMr. Akram (Pakistan): The Pakistani delegation\r\nthanks the Secretary-General for his report on the work\r\nof the Organization. The Secretary-General has rightly\r\ndescribed the past year as extraordinarily challenging\r\nfor the United Nations. Pakistan has remained an active\r\npartner of the United Nations in its efforts to build a\r\nbetter future.\r\nOver the past 12 months, international peace and\r\nsecurity continued to be affected by old and new\r\nthreats, internal conflicts, regional disputes, foreign\r\noccupation and terrorism. Disarmament remained\r\nstalled, while non-proliferation efforts continued to be\r\nmarked by discriminatory approaches.\r\nHumanitarian emergencies erupted, and poverty,\r\nhunger and infectious diseases claimed millions of\r\nlives. Along with deepening power asymmetries,\r\nwealth inequalities and socio-economic disparities all\r\ncontinued to be accentuated.\r\nPakistan fully shares the view that the instrument\r\nof multilateralism and the values of interdependence\r\nand shared responsibility are fundamental to achieving\r\nselective solutions to our common problems. Pakistan\r\nappreciates the efforts deployed by the United Nations\r\nand the Secretary-General in pursuit of international\r\npeace and security, through peacemaking,\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building.\r\nThe presence of the United Nations, particularly\r\nin Africa, is showing results, as situations in various\r\ncountries stabilize. The challenges continue, of course,\r\nand require constructive engagement, rather than\r\ncoercive strategies. The process is greatly helped as\r\nAfrican leadership and institutions become\r\nincreasingly involved in seeking African solutions to\r\nAfrican problems.\r\nThe past year witnessed an unprecedented surge\r\nin the demand for United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations. As the largest contributor to United Nations\r\npeacekeeping, Pakistan is proud of the contribution it\r\nis making to the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. We agree with the Secretary-General that\r\n“[t]oday’s operations will not succeed without the\r\nsustained political support and commitment of the\r\nMember States — and the right resources” (A/59/1,\r\npara. 8).\r\nPakistan is convinced that sustainable peace can\r\nonly be assured in the long term by adopting a\r\ncomprehensive conflict-prevention strategy addressing\r\nroot causes of conflict, strengthening long-term\r\ncapacities for the peaceful settlement of disputes and\r\nrecognizing the inextricable link between peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nTerrorism is the most abhorrent phenomenon of\r\nour times. The Secretary-General correctly emphasizes\r\nthe need for broad-based international cooperation to\r\ncounter this threat. Pakistan has remained in the\r\nvanguard of global efforts to fight this scourge.\r\nHowever, we must underline that, beyond determined\r\naction against terrorists, it is essential to have a clear,\r\ncomprehensive and long-term strategy to strike at the\r\nroot of the problem to ensure final success. We must\r\nwork to develop a legal definition of terrorism by\r\nconsensus. The strategy must also include measures to\r\nreduce poverty and address political and economic\r\ninjustice.\r\nPakistan believes that it would be a grave\r\nhistorical error to opt for strategies of intervention and\r\npre-emption to counter terrorism, prevent the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD)\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nor impose order in imploding States. Such strategies\r\ncan be costly and counter-productive. We should not\r\nmove away from the restraints in the Charter. External\r\nintervention and coercion are more likely to\r\nexacerbate, rather than ease, the threat of WMD\r\nproliferation. The quest of some States for weapons of\r\nmass destruction is often propelled by the fear of\r\nexternal intervention and aggression. Equitable and\r\npractical arrangements can, and should be, negotiated\r\nin open forums, to strengthen physical and export\r\ncontrols over sensitive materials and technology. The\r\nmotivations for proliferation can be removed through\r\nconflict resolution and security assurances. The States\r\npossessing nuclear weapons — now eight, not five —\r\nmust also work together to develop a realistic\r\nprogramme to achieve nuclear disarmament and\r\nprevent nuclear proliferation.\r\nSpeaking in the general debate on 22 September,\r\nat the 5th meeting, President Pervez Musharraf of\r\nPakistan emphasized that the time has come for closing\r\nfronts and ending conflicts through reconciliation and\r\nreform, harmony and peace. The front that must be\r\nclosed on a priority basis is the conflict between the\r\nPalestinians and Israel, in the Middle East. Winding\r\ndown the confrontation in Iraq is of equal importance.\r\nAnd we must all support Afghanistan’s efforts towards\r\npeace, democracy and stability.\r\nIn South Asia, the Secretary-General has taken\r\nnote of important strides by India and Pakistan in\r\nefforts to improve their relations and resolve\r\noutstanding issues. President Musharraf and Prime\r\nMinister Manmohan Singh of India met for the first\r\ntime in New York on 24 September. In a joint\r\nstatement, both leaders reiterated their commitment to\r\ncontinue the bilateral dialogue to restore normalcy and\r\ncooperation between India and Pakistan. On Jammu\r\nand Kashmir, they agreed that “possible options for a\r\npeaceful and negotiated settlement of the issue should\r\nbe explored in a sincere spirit and purposeful manner”.\r\nThe High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\r\nChange has been given the task to make “bold and\r\npracticable recommendations” (ibid., para. 1). It is\r\nPakistan’s belief that cooperative and democratic\r\nmultilateralism, based on the principles of the Charter\r\nand pursued through the United Nations, offers the best\r\nparadigm for a future world order. Cooperative\r\nmultilateralism should seek just, peaceful and durable\r\nsolutions to conflicts and disputes. It should address\r\nthe root causes of conflicts and chaos, rather than only\r\ntheir symptoms and consequences.\r\nThe plethora of today’s threats to peace and\r\nsecurity and the difficulties in addressing them\r\neffectively do not arise from institutional weaknesses\r\nof the United Nations or the irrelevance of the\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. They\r\nare indeed largely a consequence of the neglect of the\r\nprinciples of the Charter. It would therefore be a\r\ntragedy if the United Nations, dedicated to promote\r\npeace and conflict resolution, were to itself succumb to\r\nthe logic of power rather than uphold the power of our\r\nCharter’s principles.\r\nThe Security Council acts on behalf of the\r\ngeneral membership of the United Nations. It should be\r\naccountable to the General Assembly. Its work should\r\nbe more transparent and its decision-making more\r\ndemocratic. It should be enlarged to reflect the larger\r\nmembership of the United Nations, not to\r\naccommodate a few ambitious States. The vast\r\nmajority of Member States agree that adding more\r\npermanent members to the Security Council because of\r\ntheir size, power or wealth will not enhance the\r\nrepresentativeness or the efficiency of the Council. On\r\nthe contrary, new permanent members would further\r\ncomplicate the Council’s decision-making and provoke\r\nnew tensions in several regions of the world and,\r\nindeed, within the United Nations itself. We are\r\nnevertheless prepared to consider new ideas that will\r\nbuild consensus on the addition of elected members to\r\nthe Security Council — elected and accountable to the\r\ngeneral membership of the United Nations.\r\nThe General Assembly, the supreme body of the\r\nUnited Nations, must reassert the extensive authority\r\nthat has been vested in it by the Charter. The Economic\r\nand Social Council must play the central policy role\r\nthat was entrusted to it but which has been\r\nprogressively ceded to other international\r\norganizations. The three principal United Nations\r\nbodies also need to work together, especially in\r\naddressing the growing number of complex crises with\r\nwhich the international community is confronted.\r\nPakistan has proposed the composition of ad hoc\r\ncommittees, which deserves serious consideration.\r\nPakistan has consistently supported the efforts of\r\nthe Secretary-General to streamline the Secretariat,\r\nstrengthen its human resource base and adopt a results-\r\nbased approach. In that context, two overarching\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nconsiderations are clear. First, the United Nations must\r\nbe provided adequate financial resources to perform\r\nthe myriad and growing tasks with which it has now\r\nbeen entrusted. Secondly, the intergovernmentally\r\nagreed priorities of the Organization must determine\r\nresources, and not the other way around.\r\nThere is now an emerging international consensus\r\nregarding the inextricable link between peace and\r\ndevelopment. We share the Secretary-General’s\r\nassessment that the prospects for meeting the\r\nMillennium Development Goals remain uneven. That\r\nwill threaten both development and peace. We are\r\nconcerned that, despite an agreement on a broad\r\nstrategy for global development, poverty levels and the\r\nrising disparities in wealth and opportunity within and\r\nbetween nations have been accentuated. There is a real\r\nrisk of falling well short of realizing the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nPakistan would like to propose that, in the run-up\r\nto the high-level five-year review of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration in 2005, we work out a concrete plan for a\r\npartnership for development based on four pillars: first,\r\ngood national governance; secondly, adequate\r\nfinancing for development; thirdly, a fair international\r\ntrading system and; fourthly, open access to\r\ntechnologies required for development. The 2005 event\r\nmust focus on development. We should initiate\r\npreparations for that event at the fifty-ninth session,\r\nwith a view to achieving a negotiated outcome that\r\nenjoys the consensus of the United Nations\r\nmembership. That consensus must also address the\r\nneeds of vulnerable groups of countries that continue\r\nto remain marginalized in the global economy — such\r\nas in sub-Saharan Africa, the least developed countries,\r\nthe landlocked countries and the small island\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nMr. Al-Jomae (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nAt the outset, I have the pleasure of joining previous\r\nspeakers in conveying my gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/59/1) and to commend him for the huge undertaking\r\ninvolved in drafting the report.\r\nThe report is comprehensive in its presentation of\r\nthe developments experienced by the international\r\ncommunity in the past year. The report is also realistic\r\nwhen, in its opening pages, it points out that the United\r\nNations has been through an extraordinarily\r\nchallenging year. Observers of the international\r\nsituation believe that the real reason for that is that\r\nmany Member States have given up their commitment\r\nto the purposes and principles of the United Nations\r\nand have not respected international legally binding\r\nresolutions. Recent events in many parts of the world\r\nhave illustrated that there is no place for unilateral\r\naction outside the framework of international legality\r\nin dealing with such current problems as terrorism and\r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nTerrorism constitutes a threat to international\r\npeace and security. Throughout the world, the sense of\r\nsecurity is declining because of that phenomenon. We\r\nwould like to emphasize that the Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia condemns terrorism in all its forms. My country\r\nhas illustrated that by fully cooperating with, and\r\ntaking part in international efforts to combat terrorism.\r\nIt has also adhered to the relevant international\r\nconventions. In that connection, we would like to\r\nemphasize that any international effort to combat\r\nterrorism will not be able to fully eradicate this\r\nphenomenon if it fails to address the root causes of its\r\nemergence and spread.\r\nBecause my country, the Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia, believes that terrorism is a very serious\r\ninternational phenomenon that must be confronted in\r\ncooperation by all countries and Governments, my\r\ncountry announced from this rostrum that it plans to\r\nhost an international conference on combating\r\nterrorism, to be held in the city of Riyadh on\r\n5 February 2005. The purpose of the conference will be\r\nto exchange information and expertise and to make full\r\nuse of the scientific and practical means available to\r\ncombat terrorism and its relationship to money-\r\nlaundering and trafficking in drugs and weapons.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General has referred\r\nto the Organization’s sincere efforts to achieve\r\ndisarmament and to put an end to the evils of arms\r\nproliferation. It is clear that the international\r\ncommitment to disarmament conventions has been\r\nweak. Everyone knows that we in the Middle East are\r\nliving in a region of crises and conflicts in which Israel\r\ninsists upon not adhering to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons or to subject its\r\nnuclear facilities to the international safeguards\r\nregime. We must therefore seize this opportunity to call\r\nupon the international community to underscore the\r\nimportance of taking the necessary steps to guarantee\r\nthat the Middle East becomes a zone free from all\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nweapons of mass destruction. That would lead to\r\nsecurity and stability in both the region and the world.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration endorsed by heads\r\nof State or Government included the Millennium\r\nGoals, in the conviction that the United Nations is the\r\nbest collective mechanism to confront the challenges\r\nand pressing issues before the international community.\r\nThose include, inter alia, putting an end to poverty and\r\nhunger and armed conflict; bringing about\r\ndisarmament; and combating serious pandemics,\r\nincluding AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, among\r\nothers. The United Nations has taken it upon itself to\r\norganize international conferences to address those\r\nissues and to come up with appropriate solutions.\r\nHowever, it is obvious that the efforts of the United\r\nNations in that regard will be inadequate without clear\r\ncollective international determination to face those\r\nchallenges. Progress towards the attainment of those\r\ngoals has thus far been unsatisfactory.\r\nMr. Musambachime (Zambia): On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, I wish to extend to you, Sir, our\r\ncongratulations on your assumption of the high office\r\nof President of the fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly. My delegation is privileged to serve as one\r\nof the 21 Vice-Presidents of the session. We pledge our\r\nfull cooperation to you in the discharge of your duties.\r\nI also wish to congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Julian\r\nRobert Hunte of Saint Lucia, for the able manner in\r\nwhich he presided over the business of the fifty-eighth\r\nsession. I would also like to take this opportunity to\r\ncommend Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a\r\ndistinguished son of Africa, for the able manner in\r\nwhich he steered the work of the United Nations since\r\ncoming into office. His diplomatic skills have\r\nfacilitated the effective handling of global threats to\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nZambia welcomes the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization, which is\r\ncontained in document A/59/1. Our Organization has\r\nundertaken various efforts to promote peace and\r\nsecurity in many regions and countries. Conflict\r\nprevention, peacemaking, peace-building and\r\npeacekeeping are instruments that have been utilized in\r\nour quest to achieve disarmament and establish peace\r\nand security in Member States.\r\nThrough those efforts our Organization has\r\ndenied terrorists access to weapons of mass destruction\r\nand has helped curb the proliferation of small arms and\r\nlight weapons, which destabilizes States. In that regard,\r\nZambia looks forward to the recommendations of the\r\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change,\r\nwhich was appointed by the Secretary-General in\r\nNovember 2003. The appointment of the Panel was\r\ntimely, when threats to international peace and security\r\nare on the increase. We reaffirm our readiness to\r\ncooperate with other Member States of the United\r\nNations to enhance efforts in combating international\r\nterrorism.\r\nAs stated by the Secretary-General in his report,\r\nthe plight of the peoples of Africa, where there are still\r\nmany conflicts, is a top priority concern of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nZambia looks forward to the high-level plenary\r\nmeeting that will be convened at Headquarters in 2005\r\nto review the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. We also firmly believe that all\r\nMember States have a collective responsibility to\r\nimplement the commitments set forth in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. Similarly, Zambia hopes that\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development, which\r\nAfrica is implementing, will complement and enhance\r\nthe efforts to achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals.\r\nZambia supports the ongoing reform of the\r\nUnited Nations. It shares the concerns of other\r\ncountries that that important process has not yet been\r\ncompleted. Zambia strongly believes that the reform\r\nshould address the concerns of developing countries. In\r\nthat regard, we look forward to progress reports on the\r\nreform.\r\nZambia appreciates the recent initiatives by the\r\nPresident of the fifty-eighth session on the\r\nrevitalization, reform and enhancement of the working\r\nmethods of the General Assembly, as the highest,\r\ndeliberative and decision-making body of the United\r\nNations. My delegation stands ready to continue\r\nactively participating in the reform process during this\r\nsession.\r\nRegarding the reform of the Security Council,\r\nZambia remains concerned about the lack of progress.\r\nPresident Mwanawasa addressed that issue in his\r\naddress to the General Assembly a few weeks ago. It is\r\nour hope that progress can be made on that issue.\r\nZambia believes in multilateralism, which\r\ncontinues to be an indispensable instrument to achieve\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nglobal consensus on important, life-saving issues. As a\r\nglobal community, we face challenges that are both\r\ntransnational and interconnected in nature. It is\r\nessential that we take advantage of the immense\r\nproblem-solving potential that multilateralism offers.\r\nAs President Mwanawasa stated a few weeks ago,\r\nunilateralism should have no place in this global era.\r\nThe proliferation of small arms and light weapons\r\nis a major concern in most of our countries. Zambia\r\nhas been implementing the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community’s Operational Programme on\r\nPrevention, Combating and Control of Illicit\r\nTrafficking in Small Arms and Light Weapons. The\r\nSouthern African Regional Police Chiefs Cooperation\r\nOrganization, which was established in 1995, has been\r\nthe major instrument in our region in the fight against\r\nthe scourge of small arms and light weapons. However,\r\nmy Government is particularly concerned about the\r\ncontinuing illicit trade associated with such arms,\r\nwhich often end up in the hands of non-State actors.\r\nIn conclusion, my Government reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to multilateralism as a solution to the\r\nchallenges that confront the world. It is in that regard\r\nthat my delegation reiterates its commitment to\r\nworking with the Secretary-General to implement the\r\nrecommendations contained in his report.\r\nMs. Ramiro-Lopez (Philippines): My delegation\r\nwelcomes the report of the Secretary-General (A/59/1),\r\nwith its overarching message that the United Nations\r\nhas done its best during the period under review to live\r\nby the mandate entrusted to it by the Charter, despite\r\nresource constraints and emerging challenges\r\nheretofore unforeseen.\r\nMy delegation concurs with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s conclusion that Member States, which make\r\nup the United Nations, should not relent in their\r\ncontinuous struggle for a world of greater justice.\r\nIndeed, peace is the centrepiece of the vision of a just\r\nworld — inexorably made up of interdependent nations\r\ncontributing their shared responsibilities in the pursuit\r\nof that vision. However, peace becomes durable only if\r\nthe rule of law and the principle of multilateralism are\r\nuniversally observed.\r\nThe year under review witnessed an\r\nunprecedented upsurge in the demand for United\r\nNations peacekeeping forces worldwide, which now\r\ninclude 16 missions involving 56,000 military\r\npersonnel and 11,000 police personnel, not to mention\r\nthe civilian components. Compounding the challenge\r\nto the United Nations is the huge cost involved in\r\npeacekeeping operations, which is slowly approaching\r\nthe total budget of the Organization itself. That serious\r\ndevelopment is an indicator of the mounting challenges\r\nahead of us.\r\nThe establishment of the High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change, which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral set up last year, represents a timely and\r\npositive step in objectively examining the threats and\r\nchallenges confronting the international community\r\nand in identifying the options to be taken to effectively\r\naddress challenges.\r\nHowever, many delegations look upon the report\r\nof the Panel, to be submitted to the Secretary-General\r\non 1 December 2004, as a major input in the efforts to\r\nreform the Security Council. My delegation believes\r\nthat there should be a holistic approach to examine\r\nways to effectively address the worsening international\r\nsecurity environment. Although the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations gives the Security Council the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, the emergence of new forms of\r\nthreats to international security — such as poverty,\r\ndisease and international terrorism, to name a few —\r\nallows for a comprehensive approach involving other\r\nmain bodies of the United Nations, namely the General\r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council.\r\nMoreover, other affiliated United Nations agencies,\r\nwith their own governing boards, should be brought to\r\nthe fore in this collective effort to address security\r\nchallenges. My delegation hopes that the Panel adopts\r\na comprehensive approach in that regard.\r\nChapter VIII of the Charter allows regional\r\norganizations to initiate activities, with the prior\r\nauthority of the Security Council, on the pacific\r\nsettlement of disputes, peacemaking, peacekeeping and\r\npeace-building. Regional organizations should\r\ntherefore be tapped, not only because of the\r\ngeographical stake they hold but also to help alleviate\r\nthe resource constraints faced by the United Nations, to\r\nwhich regional organizations could contribute.\r\nIn September 2000, during the Millennium\r\nSummit, the leaders of 189 countries adopted the\r\nMillennium Declaration, which generated the United\r\nNations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The\r\nMillennium Declaration raised our hopes that the lives\r\nof 1 billion poor people around the world could be\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nalleviated from the dehumanizing conditions of abject\r\npoverty. Thus far, achieving the MDGs remains the\r\nbiggest challenge that the international community has\r\nto face. If we are to achieve the MDGs, a number of\r\nimplementation issues will have to be addressed at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels.\r\nThere is a need to generate MDG-related data to\r\nimprove the targeting of clientele and the identification\r\nof appropriate policy measures and interventions to\r\naddress socio-economic and gender disparities.\r\nAccurate and comparable information is needed to\r\nenhance the monitoring of the MDGs across countries.\r\nCommunication and advocacy campaigns have to be\r\nsustained to generate more interest, commitment and\r\nresources to achieve the MDGs. In popularizing the\r\nMDGs, we must seek the support of local Government\r\nunits, parliamentary bodies, indigenous, private and\r\ncivil society groups and the mass media.\r\nIt is our core belief that each country has the\r\nprimary responsibility for its own development. Every\r\ncountry must come up with its own poverty-reduction\r\nstrategy in the context of the MDGs. But a conducive,\r\nnurturing international environment must complement\r\nnational efforts. That can only happen if developing\r\ncountries enjoy an adequate space to apply appropriate\r\npolicy instruments in such areas as trade, investment,\r\ntechnology and other specific economic activities.\r\nThe importance of official development\r\nassistance to assist developing countries to achieve the\r\nMDGs cannot be overemphasized. Developed countries\r\nmust fulfil their commitments to allocate 0.7 per cent\r\nof their gross national product to official development\r\nassistance. The international community should\r\nlikewise ensure a fair, rules-based and equitable\r\nmultilateral trading system, to provide developing\r\ncountries opportunities for income-generation,\r\nemployment, trade and improved livelihoods.\r\nEconomic security is ensured when the playing field is\r\nlevel for both developed and developing countries.\r\nThe international community should take a closer\r\nlook at innovative ways to address the chronic debt\r\nproblem in the developing world.\r\nDeveloping countries must pursue much-needed\r\nreform to ensure the efficient use of resources and\r\nimprove governance.\r\nOn the issue of governance, national policy\r\nmeasures must be geared towards addressing chronic\r\ngraft and corruption and towards promoting\r\ntransparency to improve investor confidence.\r\nPriority should also be given to increasing food\r\nsecurity, universal education, employment generation,\r\nhealth care and gender equality.\r\nWe must work simultaneously on several fronts in\r\nthe war against HIV/AIDS. First, we must commit the\r\nrequired financial resources to address the problem of\r\nthe millions around the world who suffer from\r\nHIV/AIDS, 90 per cent of whom are reported to be\r\nliving below the poverty threshold. We commend the\r\nestablishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria to provide important\r\nfinancial resources, both at the country and community\r\nlevels.\r\nSecondly, Governments and civil society should\r\nreaffirm their political resolve to work together against\r\nHIV/AIDS. While there seems to be positive political\r\nmomentum in that regard, we must continue to\r\nstrengthen our Governments’ cooperative links with\r\ncivil society, international organizations and the private\r\nsector.\r\nLastly, we have to strengthen and improve the\r\ncapacity of the countries concerned that need more\r\ntraining and skills-building. Capacity-building will be\r\ncritical at all stages, particularly in the planning,\r\nimplementation and evaluation stages.\r\nWe bear witness daily to atrocities perpetrated in\r\nthe name of war: men and women, both young and old,\r\nare massacred or driven from their homes; public\r\nplaces are blasted; prisoners are tortured; women are\r\nraped; young boys and girls are forced to take up arms,\r\nand other barbaric acts take place. There are those who\r\nargue that those are just some of war’s necessary evils.\r\nWe believe, however, that they are not. We insist that\r\nthey are outright violations of a universally recognized\r\nbody of law known as international humanitarian law,\r\nthe principles of which are embodied in the four\r\nGeneva Conventions of 1949 and their amending\r\nprotocols, as well as in the 1954 Hague Convention.\r\nInternational humanitarian law has afforded\r\nprotection to innumerable victims of violations of law.\r\nThere is a general consensus, however, that the\r\ncontinued violation of humanitarian rules is a result of\r\nignorance of humanitarian laws, or utter contempt for\r\nthem. We therefore have a duty to ensure that treaties\r\non international humanitarian law are known and\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nrespected by our peoples. Merely acceding to them is\r\nnot enough to guarantee their observance.\r\nIn that connection, the Philippines strongly\r\nsupports efforts to strengthen and enhance the policy\r\nframework for the protection of civilians in armed\r\nconflict. As stated in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, there has been notable progress in the area of\r\nhumanitarian law since the agenda on the protection of\r\ncivilians trapped in war was launched five years ago.\r\nThat should inspire us all the more to rededicate\r\nourselves to the task of promoting greater\r\nconsciousness in the ideals of humanitarian law.\r\nMr. Haraguchi (Japan): The report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/59/1) has been presented in order to remind us once\r\nagain of the enormous and wide-ranging challenges\r\nthat the United Nations is facing today. In view of the\r\nnature of those challenges, as well due to progressive\r\nglobalization and the increasing level of\r\ninterdependency in today\u0027s international community,\r\nwe strongly feel the need to keep our multilateral\r\nframework as credible as possible, so that we will be\r\nable to work out collective solutions to those\r\nchallenges effectively.\r\nI would today like to touch upon some of the\r\nissues we consider critical in reviewing the work of the\r\nUnited Nations over the past year.\r\nLet me begin with Iraq. Stability in Iraq has a lot\r\nto do with peace and stability in the Middle East as a\r\nwhole. I am convinced that the international\r\ncommunity must make a united effort to support the\r\ntransition process in Iraq, so that the country can return\r\nto the international community as early as possible as a\r\nstable and democratic nation that is friendly to its\r\nneighbouring countries. We believe that the United\r\nNations has a leading role to play in that endeavour.\r\nIt is of vital importance that the political process\r\nbe promoted by the Iraqi people themselves according\r\nto the timetable provided for in Security Council\r\nresolution 1546 (2004). The most urgent task in that\r\nregard is to carry out the elections to the Transitional\r\nNational Assembly as scheduled, in January of next\r\nyear. We strongly hope that the utmost effort will be\r\nmade to hold inclusive elections with the participation\r\nof all major political factions. The support of the\r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq for the\r\nIndependent Electoral Commission will be critical in\r\nensuring fair and credible elections. It is our sincere\r\nhope that the Secretary-General and his Special\r\nRepresentative, Mr. Qazi, will continue to provide\r\nleadership in that regard.\r\nJapan has been actively participating in the\r\ninternational effort to assist the Iraqi people in\r\nrebuilding their country. It has pledged financial\r\nassistance amounting to $5 billion, and is steadily\r\nimplementing it. Japan has also deployed its Self-\r\nDefence Forces in Iraq to provide humanitarian and\r\nreconstruction assistance. We will host the third\r\ndonors’ meeting of the International Reconstruction\r\nFund Facility for Iraq on 13 and 14 October in Tokyo.\r\nWe are confident that the meeting will add further\r\nmomentum to the concerted efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to support Iraq. We expect that the meeting\r\nwill also address the issues of support for the political\r\nprocess, including election support, and will provide us\r\nwith a good opportunity to reconfirm our unified\r\ncommitment.\r\nIn Afghanistan, the Bonn Process is reaching its\r\nfinal stage with the approach of the presidential\r\nelection on 9 October, and parliamentary elections next\r\nyear. The rebirth of Afghanistan as a democratic State\r\nis at stake in those elections. It is our sincere hope that\r\nthe elections be conducted in a peaceful and fair\r\nmanner, and that they will result in a successful\r\noutcome.\r\nJapan, as the sponsor of the International\r\nConference on Reconstruction Assistance to\r\nAfghanistan held in Tokyo in January 2002, has been\r\nplaying a major role in assisting that country. Japan’s\r\nregional comprehensive development assistance\r\nprogramme, known as the Ogata Initiative, aims at\r\nfacilitating a seamless transition from humanitarian\r\nassistance to reconstruction and development\r\nassistance. We have been promoting the programme as\r\na model for peace and human security in post-conflict\r\nsituations.\r\nJapan is also the lead country in the disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and reintegration (DDR) process,\r\ntogether with the United Nations. We will continue our\r\nefforts to support direct negotiations between the\r\nleaders of the transitional Government and regional\r\ncommanders, implementation of the commander\r\nincentive programmes and promotion of reintegration\r\nprogrammes, so that the momentum for DDR can be\r\nmaintained even after the presidential election. The\r\nreconstruction of Afghanistan is a touchstone in our\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nfight against terrorism. For that reason, it is essential\r\nthat the international community continue its support\r\nfor the efforts of the Afghan people.\r\nPrime Minister Koizumi clearly stated in his\r\naddress to the General Assembly during the general\r\ndebate that there will be no stability and prosperity in\r\nthe world until Africa’s issues are resolved. In fact,\r\nAfrica’s issues pose serious challenges to the United\r\nNations, both in achieving peace and security and in\r\npromoting development, including meeting the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nIn the Sudan, it is crucial that the Government\r\nand the rebels make every effort to reach a political\r\nsettlement on Darfur, in accordance with Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 1556 (2004) and 1564 (2004). All\r\npossible measures to improve the security conditions in\r\nthe region must be taken, beginning with the disarming\r\nof the militias in order to halt attacks against civilians.\r\nTo ensure an end to the current climate of impunity, all\r\nthose responsible for the massive human rights abuses\r\nand violations of international humanitarian law must\r\nurgently be brought to justice. In this regard, we highly\r\nappreciate the steps taken by the African Union (AU)\r\nfor the resolution of the Darfur issue. The international\r\ncommunity must continue to assist the efforts of the\r\nAU.\r\nIn addressing the issue of peace and security in\r\nAfrica, we are of the view that it is important for\r\nAfrican countries to exercise ownership to a greater\r\nextent. International support to enhance Africa’s\r\ncapacity for managing conflicts is certainly necessary,\r\nbut Africa’s ownership efforts are the most important\r\nelement. Japan is strengthening its partnership with the\r\nAU through dialogue, so as to enable the AU to play an\r\neven more constructive role in peace-building\r\nactivities.\r\nJapan hosted the Third Tokyo International\r\nConference on African Development (TICAD III), last\r\nyear. Since the beginning of the TICAD process in\r\n1993, Japan has been steadily providing wide-ranging\r\nassistance to Africa. The consolidation of peace,\r\npoverty reduction through economic growth and\r\nhuman-centred development are the three main pillars\r\nof our undertaking there.\r\n The consolidation of peace and realization of\r\nhuman security are urgent and essential tasks for\r\nAfrica. A society impoverished by armed conflict\r\nremains in a precarious state. Africa stands at the\r\ncrossroads between peace and national rebirth, on the\r\none hand, and a return to armed conflict, on the other.\r\nUnder such circumstances, promoting human security\r\nenables such a society to move towards peace and\r\nrobust national reconstruction. Japan advocates the\r\nimportance of promoting human security and is firmly\r\ncommitted to providing assistance through such\r\nchannels as the United Nations Trust Fund for Human\r\nSecurity, in order to promote the protection and\r\nempowerment of individuals.\r\nAn effective strategy for disaster reduction is one\r\nof the key elements in attaining sustainable\r\ndevelopment. A natural disaster can wipe out the fruits\r\nof years of development efforts in an instant. Japan is\r\nto host in Kobe next January the World Conference on\r\nDisaster Reduction, and it is committed to the success\r\nof that Conference.\r\nIn another critical sector, that of water and\r\nsanitation, Japan is also taking a leading role. In fact,\r\nJapan is now the largest contributor in this sector,\r\nhaving provided approximately one third of the\r\nworldwide development assistance for drinking water\r\nand sanitation in the last three years. Japan’s former\r\nPrime Minister, Mr. Ryutaro Hashimoto, currently\r\nchairs the Secretary-General’s Advisory Board on\r\nWater and Sanitation. My country intends to continue\r\nits active engagement in this field.\r\nTerrorist activities show no sign of ceasing. Acts\r\nof terror continue to claim innocent lives, including\r\nthose of children. Japan strongly condemns those\r\natrocious acts and acutely feels the necessity of further\r\nstrengthening international cooperation aimed at\r\ndeterring such violence. We continue to support the\r\nactivities of the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the\r\nSecurity Council Committee established pursuant to\r\nresolution 1267 (1999) concerning Al Qaeda and the\r\nTaliban and Associated Individuals and Entities, and\r\noffer them our full cooperation.\r\nThe realization of justice and the rule of law is a\r\nfundamental element of a stable society. It is also a\r\nnecessary means to deterring the recurrence of violent\r\nconflict. The importance of ownership should be\r\nemphasized in this area as well. Each country has the\r\nprimary responsibility of establishing justice and the\r\nrule of law within its own borders. The United Nations,\r\nwhen it extends assistance in this field, should honour\r\nthe ownership of the recipient countries and give due\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nconsideration to the support and participation of the\r\npeople.\r\nJapan welcomes the fact that Cambodia’s national\r\nassembly has approved the agreement with the United\r\nNations with regard to the Khmer Rouge trials. We\r\nexpect that the further necessary steps will be taken for\r\nits prompt ratification. We also sincerely hope that the\r\nUnited Nations will make the necessary preparations\r\nwith all due haste. Japan, having played a central role\r\nin supporting Cambodia’s efforts to carry out the trials,\r\nurges Member States to make an active contribution to\r\nthe process with a view to an early realization of the\r\ntrials.\r\nThrough our experience in ad hoc tribunals, such\r\nas the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), we have learned that the\r\nadministrative organizations of such tribunals that are\r\nfinanced through assessed contributions can grow far\r\nlarger than necessary. That being the case, we need to\r\nidentify the most efficient and effective form of\r\norganization for international tribunals.\r\nMy country is increasingly concerned about the\r\nrapid expansion of the United Nations regular budget\r\nas well as the peacekeeping budget. In order to earn the\r\nsupport of our taxpayers, the United Nations must\r\nalways be mindful of the need to demonstrate that it is\r\ncommitted to utilizing limited resources properly and\r\nwith the utmost efficiency.\r\nI would also like to touch upon some aspects of\r\nthe management of our Organization. Japan considers\r\nthat the scale of assessments for Member States needs\r\nto be more balanced. Another point I would like to\r\nemphasize is that we are still a long way from realizing\r\nequitable geographical representation with regard to\r\nthe nationalities of the staff in the United Nations\r\nSecretariat. The current condition of severe\r\nunderrepresentation must be redressed as a matter of\r\npriority.\r\nAs the Secretary-General’s report suggests, the\r\nsixtieth anniversary of the United Nations will provide\r\nus with a good opportunity for fresh thinking about the\r\nproblems of our world and how the United Nations can\r\naddress them. In this context, I am pleased to note that\r\nthe work of the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change seems to be progressing as\r\nscheduled. It is our strong hope that their report will\r\npresent a number of inspiring ideas on which to reflect.\r\nIn our view, one of our vital tasks in this session is to\r\nduly follow up the report of the Panel. We need to\r\ncreate a new United Nations for the new era and a\r\nmultilateral framework that will enable us to cope with\r\nnew threats and challenges more effectively.\r\nMr. Hannesson (Iceland): We congratulate you,\r\nMr. President, on your election and wish you well in\r\nthe important work ahead.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for presenting his\r\ncomprehensive report on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/59/1), which maps out the daunting tasks before the\r\nUnited Nations. Rather than addressing any of the\r\nspecific issues, I will concentrate on a prerequisite for\r\nsuccess in general: the revitalization of the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the strengthening of the United\r\nNations system.\r\nIceland welcomes the successful implementation\r\nof resolutions 58/126 and 58/316 on the revitalization\r\nof the work of the General Assembly, adopted at the\r\nfifty-eighth session of the Assembly, and looks forward\r\nto further improvements of our work. Iceland\r\nappreciates the memorandum by the Secretary-General\r\non the organization of the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, adoption of the agenda and\r\nallocation of items (A/BUR/59/1), in which agenda\r\nitems are organized under headings corresponding to\r\nthe priorities of the Organization as contained in the\r\nmedium-term plan.\r\nIt is in the spirit of efficiency that Iceland has\r\ndecided to address in its statement today, under the\r\nheading “Organizational, administrative and other\r\nmatters”, items that were also covered during last\r\nMonday’s debate on revitalization and that will be\r\ndealt with at next Monday’s debate on Security Council\r\nreform.\r\nEnhancing the authority and the role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and improving the Assembly’s\r\nworking methods should continue to be based on the\r\ngood work already carried out. New rules for the\r\nexchange of information between the two bodies — the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council — through\r\nperiodic reports from the Council to the Assembly and\r\nthrough formal consultations — as decided in\r\nresolution 58/126 — should increase the transparency\r\nand thereby the efficiency of the Organization.\r\nStreamlining the work of the General Assembly\r\nis, however, part of a much greater challenge to adjust\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nour multilateral structures to deal with threats to global\r\nsecurity. The recommendations of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in the light of the work of the High-level Panel\r\non Threats, Challenges and Change will serve as a\r\nvaluable step towards the reform we have long called\r\nfor.\r\nThe delicate question of reform of the Security\r\nCouncil has long occupied our work. Although reform\r\nof the Council will not solve all our problems, failure\r\nto address that issue will act as a brake on effective\r\nrevitalization in other areas. Iceland has persistently\r\ncalled for reform of the Security Council in order to\r\nmake it more representative. The current composition\r\nof the Council mirrors neither today’s geopolitical\r\nrealities nor the increased membership of the United\r\nNations. At the same time, the Council’s efficiency in\r\ncoping with the serious issues on its agenda must be\r\nensured. The Icelandic Government supports an\r\nincrease in the non-permanent category, as well as the\r\nallocation of permanent seats to Japan, India, Germany\r\nand Brazil. Africa must also be ensured a permanent\r\nseat on the Council.\r\nIceland strongly believes that changes are long\r\noverdue. If we grasp this chance for reform, 60 years\r\nafter the founding of the United Nations, the\r\nOrganization will strengthen its role as the forum for\r\naddressing major threats to the world’s security in the\r\nfuture. We are prepared to work together with other\r\ndelegations to ensure a good reception of the results of\r\nthe Panel’s work. Iceland looks forward to what the\r\nSecretary-General characterized as bold and\r\npracticable recommendations of the High-level Panel\r\nand to his recommendations based on the Panel’s\r\nreport.\r\nMr. Mubarez (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nreport of the Secretary-General (A/59/1) now before us\r\nfor consideration covers a number of facts with regard\r\nto what the Organization has been doing in several\r\nareas over the past year — facts that we encounter in\r\nour collective activities and that encourage us to share\r\nmany of the conclusions drawn by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. Before I make detailed comments on the\r\nreport, I should commend the Secretary-General for its\r\ncomprehensiveness, and its presentation of facts and\r\nvisions.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that last\r\nyear was filled with challenges for the United\r\nNations — multiple challenges that added to the\r\nburden of the Organization and in many cases exceeded\r\nthe scope of its resources. Unfortunately, that was\r\naccompanied by a split in multilateral action and the\r\ncontinued use of unilateralism, which runs counter to\r\nthe requirements for mutual trust and collective\r\nsecurity.\r\nStatements made at this session reflect the views\r\nand the determination of the entire international\r\ncommunity with regard to the adoption of structural\r\nreforms whose institutional concepts are needed for the\r\nstrengthening of international multilateral action. Our\r\ncountry has always supported that approach because\r\nwe are firmly convinced that only through international\r\nmultilateral action can we effectively address\r\ncollective security challenges and the requirements of\r\nglobalization. This can be achieved through regional\r\nand international institutions, especially this\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe are pleased to note in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General that the Organization has undertaken\r\nefforts in several areas to meet the increasing demands\r\nof those challenges and that we need to adapt to\r\nchanges in the international sphere. While we agree\r\nwith the anticipated recommendations of the High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, we\r\nstrongly believe that the best way to attain our\r\nobjectives remains participation, whether it is a\r\nquestion of taking decisions at the international level\r\nor implementing chapter II of the report, on achieving\r\npeace and security. That chapter gives us a true picture\r\nof innovative methods as well as of United Nations\r\nwork that moves beyond the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity to peace-building and the building of\r\ninternational institutions.\r\nThe Organization’s achievements in meeting its\r\nhumanitarian responsibilities are satisfactory.\r\nParagraph 84 of the report states that the number of\r\nrefugees has decreased by nearly 1 million persons for\r\ntwo consecutive years. We are pleased to note the\r\ninitiative of the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees aimed at repatriating\r\nrefugees both to relieve their sufferings and to assist\r\ncountries that host them. We also appreciate the efforts\r\nof the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for\r\nPalestine Refugees in the Near East to provide basic\r\nassistance to Palestinian refugees, despite the constant\r\nshortfall in its budget, which makes it impossible for it\r\nto fully meet their needs, as noted in paragraph 106. It\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\ncan provide only limited services to some of those\r\nrefugees.\r\nParagraph 100 also states clearly that the\r\ncontinuing Israeli aggression against the population of\r\nthe occupied Palestinian territories is exacerbating the\r\nsufferings of the Palestinian refugees and that the\r\nsituation there remains tragic. Joint action is a\r\nnecessity, not an option, to meet these challenges and\r\nchanges and to address the varied interests of the\r\nparties involved. We must adapt our working methods\r\nto new realities, and we therefore eagerly await the\r\nreport to be submitted by the High-level Panel as well\r\nas preparations for the Millennium Summit+5\r\nconference focusing on the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. We unreservedly\r\nsupport the views and ideas put forward at the\r\nMillennium Summit regarding reform of the United\r\nNations, as it is the main institution for international\r\ncollective action.\r\nWe note with interest greater participation by\r\nnon-governmental organizations. The partnership that\r\nhas been proposed will enhance and strengthen\r\ndemocratization in the work of the Organization.\r\nHowever, we must be cautious here. We must give\r\ngreater consideration to this issue so as to ensure the\r\nbest possible partnerships among the United Nations\r\nand civil society organizations.\r\nWe believe that priority should be accorded to the\r\nstrengthening of civil society institutions in developing\r\ncountries. We must promote participation at the local\r\nlevel before moving to the international one.\r\nFinally, allow me to express our appreciation for\r\nthe report submitted to us by the Secretary-General.\r\nMy delegation is prepared to cooperate with you,\r\nMr. President, to help make this session a success, so\r\nthat we can move forward in our common work.\r\nMr. Ngo Duc Thang (Viet Nam): Let me begin\r\nby joining previous speakers in reiterating my\r\ndelegation’s appreciation of the Secretary-General’s\r\nannual report on the work of the Organization. We note\r\nwith satisfaction that the issues of international peace\r\nand security and sustainable development have been\r\nhighlighted in the report as primary tasks on the agenda\r\nof the Organization.\r\nAs mentioned by the Secretary-General in the\r\nintroduction to his report, the past year has been a very\r\nchallenging year for the United Nations — from the\r\ncontroversies surrounding the Iraq crisis to continuing\r\nviolent conflicts, international terrorism, weapons of\r\nmass destruction, the spread of infectious diseases,\r\nextreme poverty and hunger, environmental\r\ndegradation and human rights violations.\r\nIn the mix of those many challenges, for many of\r\nthe world’s peoples the threats posed by extreme\r\npoverty and hunger as well as by deadly diseases such\r\nas HIV/AIDS are no less serious and are more\r\nimmediate than those posed by weapons of any kind. It\r\nis urgent that, while continuing to cope with traditional\r\nthreats, we try to find solutions to emerging new ones.\r\nWe wish to express our deep appreciation of the\r\nSecretary-General’s decision to appoint a High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change. We look\r\nforward to receiving the Panel’s report and hope that\r\nthe recommendations contained therein will form a\r\ngood basis for careful consideration by Member States\r\nof timely actions for change.\r\nFrom Iraq to the Middle East and Africa, violent\r\nconflicts and hostilities continue to threaten the lives of\r\nmillions of civilians. In many other parts of the world,\r\ntension remains or keeps escalating, threatening\r\ninternational peace and security. The report provides an\r\nin-depth analysis of the performance, progress and\r\nshortcomings of the Organization in bringing peace,\r\nindependence and reconciliation to the countries\r\nconcerned. The Vietnamese delegation shares the\r\nunanimous view that the crucial role of the United\r\nNations needs to be further enhanced to tackle the\r\nchallenges facing us.\r\nIn that connection, we welcome resolution\r\n58/269, which was recently adopted and reaffirms the\r\nvital role of the United Nations in the field of the\r\nmaintenance of global peace and security as well as the\r\npromotion of international cooperation. We deeply\r\nappreciate the Secretary-General’s tireless efforts\r\naimed at strengthening the Organization’s capacity in\r\nthe area of the prevention and resolution of armed\r\nconflicts, including peacekeeping and peace-building\r\nactivities. We encourage the speedier development of a\r\ncomprehensive and coherent conflict-prevention\r\nstrategy to respond effectively to the challenges posed\r\nby the peacekeeping and peace-building processes.\r\nTerrorism has become the most pressing danger\r\nand challenge. Viet Nam condemns all acts of\r\nterrorism, in all its forms and manifestations. We\r\nsupport the Secretary-General’s view on the need for\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nbroad international cooperation to fight this scourge.\r\nWe are pleased to note from the report that there is\r\nclose cooperation among relevant agencies such as the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee, the Terrorism\r\nPrevention Branch of the United Nations Office for\r\nDrug Control and Crime Prevention, and the\r\nDepartment of Public Information to coordinate and\r\nreinvigorate the global response to terrorism. We wish\r\nto reaffirm here the position of the Vietnamese\r\nGovernment that, in order to mobilize broad\r\nparticipation and maintain its own legitimacy, the fight\r\nagainst terrorism must be free from any selectivity or\r\ndouble standard.\r\nEven as many developing countries face major\r\ndifficulties resulting from a lack of financial resources\r\nfor activities aimed at eradicating poverty and hunger,\r\nnot to mention development projects, hundreds of\r\nbillions of dollars continue to be wasted in an ongoing\r\narms race. The report mentioned the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction as a cause of continued\r\ngreat concern and noted several positive signs relating\r\nto disarmament. We think, however, that the report\r\nwould have been more comprehensive if the lack of\r\nprogress in the proceedings of major United Nations\r\ndisarmament bodies such as the Disarmament\r\nCommission — especially in the area of nuclear\r\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction — had\r\nbeen reflected and recommendations made to overcome\r\nthe problem.\r\nWe commend the efforts of the Organization to\r\nmeet its humanitarian commitments. We share the\r\nSecretary-General’s concern over the persistent\r\nunderfunding of humanitarian action.\r\nMy delegation commends the Secretary-General\r\nand supports the good work he has been doing and the\r\nleadership he has been providing in the area of\r\ncooperation for development. We are pleased that the\r\nreport has placed at the centre of the work of the\r\nOrganization the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), such as tackling poverty\r\nto narrow the gap between the rich and the poor;\r\nfighting diseases such as HIV/AIDS; preventing drug\r\ntrafficking; and protecting the environment.\r\nWe share the concern about the lack of financial\r\nresources to implement the MDGs, and we fully\r\nsupport the Secretary-General’s call on donor nations\r\nto meet the target of devoting 0.7 per cent of gross\r\nnational product to official development assistance and\r\nto expand available funds to reinforce financing for\r\ndevelopment and the promotion of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. We concur with the Secretary-General in\r\nemphasizing that balanced and equitable international\r\ntrade is one of the important ways to assist developing\r\nand least developed countries in achieving the MDGs.\r\nWe also fully support the Secretary-General’s call for\r\ninternational commitments on the part of other\r\nstakeholders — including the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, the World Trade Organization, the private\r\nsector and civil society — in order to create more\r\ndemocratic and open world trade and financial systems.\r\nMy last comment is related to the work of the\r\nOrganization in the area of management. My\r\ndelegation wishes to commend the initiatives and\r\nproposals put forward by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport to improve the capacity and efficiency of the\r\nUnited Nations. We have taken note with great interest\r\nof the Secretary-General’s new proposals to replace the\r\ncurrent four-year medium-term plan with a new\r\nbiennial strategic framework and a redesigned\r\nprogramme performance report. We fully support that\r\nstrategic framework, which improves managerial\r\naccountability. With regard to human resources\r\nmanagement, my delegation would again like to\r\nunderscore the need to further enhance the\r\ntransparency, efficiency and effectiveness of the United\r\nNations recruitment process. We wish to stress that any\r\nsystem of recruitment should take into consideration\r\nthe need to ensure equitable representation at the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): The report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the work of the Organization\r\nbefore us (A/59/1) makes it clear both how impressive\r\nthe activities and achievements of the United Nations\r\nare and how complex and challenging are the tasks it\r\nfaces. It offers a rare glimpse into the range of\r\nundertakings of the Organization and can serve as a\r\nuseful tool in defending the Organization against its\r\nnumerous detractors, whose arguments are as often\r\nbased on ignorance as they are on malevolence. The\r\nreport can even be used as a reference book, since it\r\noffers a concise account of the history and state of play\r\nin the areas where the Organization is actively\r\ninvolved. A more analytical reading, however, leads to\r\nthe significant question of whether the Organization is\r\ntruly equipped to successfully tackle all the issues\r\nbefore it.\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nAll its mandates, of course, are given to the\r\nUnited Nations by us, the Member States; and one\r\nmust wonder whether we are fully living up to our\r\nresponsibilities in that respect. The most complex\r\nproblems of a globalized world — such as, for\r\nexample, combating terrorism, HIV/AIDS and the\r\neradication of poverty — are handed over to the United\r\nNations to deal with them. While we almost\r\nautomatically do this, we have been negligent in\r\nsupplying the Organization with the tools to do the job.\r\nAt the core of a successful United Nations is the\r\nunequivocal commitment from its Member States to\r\nmultilateralism. The most credible and effective\r\nexpression of that commitment is unwavering political\r\nand financial support, as well as ongoing work to\r\nadjust the United Nations to the changed, and\r\nchanging, circumstances in which it works.\r\nThe expectations concerning the outcome of the\r\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change\r\nare high, and we share them. Nevertheless, the\r\ndecisions that need to be made cannot be outsourced;\r\nwe have to make them ourselves. Changes in the\r\ninstitutional architecture are necessary and inevitable.\r\nThe United Nations cannot remain a reflection of its\r\nhistory, but must be designed in a manner that reflects\r\nthe current challenges.\r\nThe year 2005 will be a decisive one. We must\r\nthink early about how to make the next year a\r\nsuccessful one from the intergovernmental side. It\r\nseems crucial to us that we agree at an early stage on a\r\ncomprehensive and interconnected agenda. It must be\r\nclear, in particular, that development and security are\r\nmutually reinforcing and inseparable, which means that\r\none cannot be dealt with successfully if the other is\r\nneglected. In that connection, the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals must be at the core of our\r\ndeliberations, as they constitute the biggest promise we\r\nhave made collectively and the most ambitious goal we\r\nhave set for ourselves.\r\nWe believe that institutional changes are needed,\r\nand we also believe that they must be carried out in a\r\nmanner that preserves, and indeed improves, the\r\ninstitutional balance of the Organization. A more\r\nmodern and more representative Security Council must\r\nbe complemented by a leaner, more flexible and more\r\nrelevant General Assembly that truly fulfils the tasks\r\nassigned to it under the Charter. The enlargement of\r\nthe Security Council is a necessity. If we were to fail to\r\nseize the growing momentum in that respect, we would\r\nprobably squander the opportunity to do so for a long\r\ntime to come. However, the highly political question of\r\nenlargement must not distract us from effectively\r\ndealing with the other elements of Security Council\r\nreform that must be addressed simultaneously. We\r\nbelieve that only a more representative and more\r\naccountable Security Council will be able to effectively\r\ntackle threats to international peace and security on\r\nbehalf of the international community as a whole.\r\nThe report pays tribute to the victims of the\r\nattack on United Nations headquarters in Baghdad on\r\n19 August 2003, and rightly so. We must remember\r\nthat most painful event and be determined to take the\r\naction that is our responsibility. The security conditions\r\nunder which United Nations staff operate throughout\r\nthe world must be improved and the relevant\r\nmechanism, at Headquarters but especially in the field,\r\nmust be enhanced. We look forward to the relevant\r\nsuggestions of the Secretary-General in that respect,\r\nand will continue working on the important aspect of\r\nlegal protection in particular. At the same time, we\r\nmust ensure that the United Nations remains committed\r\nto its most important function, which is to bestow\r\nlegitimacy upon international and collective action. We\r\ntherefore very much welcome the vision of the\r\nSecretary-General in placing the respect for the rule of\r\nlaw at the top of his agenda for the coming months and\r\nyears.\r\nMr. Wali (Nigeria): I would like to express the\r\nappreciation of the delegation of Nigeria to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his report on\r\nthe work of the Organization, contained in document\r\nA/59/1. The report has highlighted some of the most\r\nchallenging issues confronting the international\r\ncommunity. These include conflict prevention and\r\nresolution, terrorism, natural disasters, disease control,\r\ndisarmament and arms control, poverty and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. The report, which has ably reviewed the\r\nefforts of our Organization to secure a constructive and\r\nenduring solution to fundamental global problems, has\r\nalso drawn attention to the complexities of the tasks\r\nconfronting humanity.\r\nIt is in this context that Nigeria views with\r\nconcern the persistence of conflicts in many regions of\r\nthe world. We therefore commend the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations, through the Security Council, to\r\nmaintain international peace and security. While the\r\nUnited Nations has achieved some measure of success,\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nwe still need to do more to usher in durable peace and\r\nstability in conflict-ravaged areas.\r\nNigeria also commends the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General in his continued use of preventive\r\ndiplomacy and of special envoys for peacemaking and\r\npeace-building in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. To some extent, we have achieved\r\nthe targets set in the Millennium Declaration, despite\r\nthe rather discouraging surge in the global demand for\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that, with the assistance\r\nof the United Nations, regional organizations are\r\nbecoming more focused and proactive in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\r\nthrough the establishment of institutional cooperation\r\nfor conflict prevention, management and resolution. In\r\nthis regard, we commend the assistance extended to the\r\nAfrican Union for the establishment of its Peace and\r\nSecurity Council, the African Standby Force and the\r\nMilitary Staff Committee. We note with satisfaction the\r\nassistance and cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS), particularly in the areas of peacekeeping\r\nand peace-building in Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire and Sierra\r\nLeone.\r\nECOWAS has been able to address complex\r\nhumanitarian issues in the subregion, thanks to the\r\ncooperative efforts of the United Nations. We urge the\r\ninternational community to extend financial and\r\nlogistical support to ECOWAS and the African Union\r\nin order to enhance their capacity for the maintenance\r\nof peace and security in the subregion.\r\nWe endorse the memorandum of understanding\r\nand the programme of work between ECOWAS and the\r\nOffice of the Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for West Africa. We appreciate that that\r\ninvolves joint activities in the areas of governance,\r\nsecurity sector reform, electoral assistance, youth\r\nunemployment and the control and circulation of small\r\narms and light weapons.\r\nAs the world continues to suffer the devastating\r\nconsequences of terrorist acts, Nigeria reaffirms its\r\ncondemnation of international terrorism. We pledge our\r\ncooperation with other members of the international\r\ncommunity, through bilateral and multilateral efforts,\r\nto combat this menace in all its forms. Accordingly, we\r\ncondemn the recent terrorist attack on a school in\r\nBeslan, Russia, and reaffirm our support for Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1502 (2003) on the protection of\r\ncivilians and humanitarian and United Nations\r\npersonnel in conflict areas. We condemn in the\r\nstrongest terms all acts of terrorism, and urge firm\r\naction by all members of the international community\r\nto deny support of any kind to terrorists and their\r\ncohorts.\r\nThe illicit trade in small arms and light weapons\r\ncontinues to pose serious concern to the international\r\ncommunity, in particular developing countries, since it\r\ncontributes to conflicts and political instability. The\r\nexcessive accumulation and easy availability of small\r\narms and light weapons hinders peace-building and\r\ndevelopment efforts and threatens human security. In\r\nthis regard, the ECOWAS moratorium on the\r\nimportation, exportation and manufacture of small\r\narms and light weapons in West Africa has been a\r\nuseful mechanism for a coordinated and sustainable\r\nregional approach to controlling this menace.\r\nWe reiterate our commitment to the United\r\nNations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and\r\nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light\r\nWeapons in All Its Aspects, adopted in July 2001. We\r\nurge the international community to control the\r\nmovement of such weapons, especially to non-State\r\nactors. While we note the progressive decrease in the\r\nproduction and transfer of landmines, it is regrettable\r\nthat they continue to impede the development and\r\nsecurity of populations, especially in African States\r\nthat are emerging from conflict. In this regard, we urge\r\nthe international community to strengthen its support\r\nfor the United Nations Mine Action Service, as that is\r\nthe principal coordinating body of the United Nations\r\nfor curbing the menace of landmines.\r\nAnother major threat facing the United Nations\r\nand the international community is the proliferation of\r\nnuclear, biological and chemical weapons, especially\r\nthe dangerous possibility of their acquisition by\r\nindividuals and terrorist groups. Although there are\r\nagreements and conventions governing the production,\r\nuse, stockpiling and transfer of such weapons, the lack\r\nof transparency and commitment in the implementation\r\nof their provisions have regrettably eroded respect for\r\ncompliance. In particular, lack of progress on broad\r\ndisarmament measures regarding nuclear weapons is\r\nnot in the best interests of the international community.\r\nWe therefore call on the parties to those conventions to\r\nhonour their obligations in the interests of international\r\npeace and security.\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to pose grave\r\nchallenges to our developmental efforts. We appreciate\r\nthe efforts of the United Nations and the contribution\r\nof the international community to combating this\r\nscourge, particularly in Africa. We reiterate our\r\ncommitment to the framework for action adopted at the\r\nAfrican Union’s special summit of African leaders in\r\nAbuja, and the African Union Summit held this year in\r\nAddis Ababa, to intensify their efforts and mobilize\r\nresources for the prevention, care and treatment of\r\npeople infected by the disease.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration, world leaders\r\nresolved, among other things, to eliminate poverty by\r\nlaunching a sustained campaign to make the right to\r\ndevelopment a reality for all nations. In this regard,\r\nAfrican Governments are giving prominence to the\r\nMillennium Development Goals in their strategic\r\ndevelopment planning and budgetary allocations. They\r\nhave also agreed to encourage public-private\r\npartnership and broad-based participation in the\r\nplanning and implementation of development\r\nprogrammes. The strategy is for Governments to create\r\nan enabling environment, while the private sector\r\nassumes a leadership role in economic development\r\nand the provision of services.\r\nWhile these are imperative measures for Africa to\r\nundertake, the international community has an\r\nobligation to fulfil the commitments and promises that\r\nit made decades ago on economic development\r\nassistance. We therefore call on our development\r\npartners to deliver on their official development\r\nassistance commitments, which they reaffirmed in\r\nMonterrey and Johannesburg.\r\nNigeria reaffirms its support for the priority\r\naccorded by the United Nations to the special needs of\r\nAfrica, with the establishment of the Office of the\r\nSpecial Adviser on Africa. We note with satisfaction\r\nthe continued efforts of the Office to facilitate the\r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). In this regard, we commend\r\nthe Office of the Special Adviser for the publication of\r\nSouth-South Cooperation in Support of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development: Experiences of\r\nAfrica-Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nNigeria endorses the appointment of the\r\nindependent panel of eminent persons to review and\r\nassess the scope and adequacy of international support\r\nfor NEPAD and to conduct dialogue with Africa’s\r\ndevelopment partners, with a view to promoting\r\nsupport for NEPAD. We look forward to the\r\nrecommendations of the panel.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations and other\r\nsources of international law have established\r\nconditions under which justice and respect for the\r\nobligations arising from treaties can be maintained.\r\nThe rule of law is becoming more widely accepted, and\r\nStates are increasingly employing treaties to regulate\r\ntheir relations. We commend the support and assistance\r\nprovided by the United Nations to the International\r\nCriminal Tribunals for Rwanda and for the former\r\nYugoslavia, as well as to the Special Court for Sierra\r\nLeone.\r\nIn conclusion, Nigeria is pleased to note that the\r\nSecretary-General has made commendable efforts\r\ntowards strengthening the effectiveness of our\r\nOrganization. We are satisfied with the various\r\ninitiatives that have been put in place, and we pledge\r\nour continued cooperation with all efforts to strengthen\r\nour Organization.\r\nMr. Balestra (San Marino): On this occasion, I\r\nwish to thank the Secretary-General for the report\r\ncontained in document A/59/1. It lists all the work\r\naccomplished, all the work not accomplished, all our\r\nfrustrations and all our hopes and contains a call to\r\nfulfil all our commitments and obligations. Following\r\nthe invitation to be brief, I will touch on only a few\r\npoints of the report.\r\nSadly, the general sense prevailing among us is\r\nthat the international community will not succeed in\r\nreaching the objectives of the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration by 2015. It is encouraging,\r\nhowever, to acknowledge that the Secretary-General\r\nbelieves that it will still be possible to achieve some of\r\nthe time-bound and measurable goals set in the\r\nDeclaration, if developed and developing countries\r\ninstitute the right combination of national and\r\ninternational policies and implement their shared\r\ncommitments, as set forth in the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration and the Monterrey Consensus.\r\nSan Marino thinks that this is the main conclusion we\r\nshould draw from the Secretary-General’s report. If we\r\nwant to achieve our common objectives, we must\r\nhonour the accepted commitments and apply the agreed\r\npolicies. The time for action has arrived.\r\nIn the context of macroeconomic policies, one\r\nelement in the Secretary-General’s report caught my\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nattention: the range of actions that Governments,\r\npublic development institutions, the private sector and\r\ncivil society organizations can undertake to spur the\r\ngrowth of small and medium-size businesses. This is\r\nan area that should be enhanced, in particular for some\r\ndeveloping countries, since, linked with a policy of\r\nmicrocredits, it would favour the development of small\r\nbusinesses and facilitate the participation of women\r\nand young people in the economic life of their country.\r\nWe believe we have some authority to recommend this\r\nprocess, since it has been implemented in San Marino,\r\nalthough in a different context, and has been a winning\r\npolicy for our economy for many years.\r\nThe insufficiency of financial assistance and the\r\ninadequacy of the tools in our hands are apparent in all\r\nareas of international cooperation, but are particularly\r\nevident in the fight against natural disasters.\r\nEnvironmental degradation and climate changes are —\r\nand will be — provoking natural disasters of increasing\r\nintensity. It is therefore necessary to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations institutions in this field, in both the\r\nprevention of natural disasters and the provision of\r\nhumanitarian assistance to the victims.\r\nSan Marino welcomes the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) report entitled\r\n“Reducing disaster risk: a challenge for development”,\r\nidentifying the vulnerability of countries to three key\r\nnatural hazards: earthquakes, tropical cyclones and\r\nfloods. San Marino also welcomes the United Nations\r\nUniversity’s launching of a programme to reduce the\r\nrisk of catastrophic floods in Asia and the Pacific.\r\nSimilar programmes could also be implemented to\r\naddress disasters of a different nature and in other\r\nregions of the globe.\r\nSan Marino agrees with the Secretary-General\r\nwhen he states that the fight against terrorism must be\r\nfirmly advanced with determination and with full\r\nrespect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and\r\nthe rule of law. Since the tragic 11 September attack on\r\nthe United States, the international community has\r\nbecome aware of the seriousness of terrorism.\r\nRecurrent dramatic events worldwide, such as the\r\nviolent attacks perpetrated in Iraq and in other parts of\r\nthe world against not only soldiers but also civilians,\r\nthe media and even non-governmental organization\r\nhumanitarian mission staff, make imperative a search\r\nfor a common and effective response based on stronger\r\njoint commitments.\r\nWe cannot deny that an effective strategy against\r\nterrorism still remains to be found. The activity of the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) seems to have\r\nstalled, after an initial élan. The proposal by Costa\r\nRica to create a high commissioner for terrorism\r\nshould be explored further, as it would involve the\r\nSecurity Council as well as the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly in the fight against\r\nterrorism, allowing us to fight not only the results, but\r\nalso the deep causes of terrorism.\r\nMr. Sardenberg (Brazil): I would like to start by\r\nthanking the Secretary-General for his comprehensive\r\nreport on the work of the Organization.\r\nAs the scope of action of the United Nations is\r\ntoo broad to be adequately dealt with in its entirety at\r\nthis juncture, I shall focus on the following two\r\naspects, which in our view are inextricably linked:\r\nachieving peace and security and cooperating for\r\ndevelopment. I shall also refer to the question of the\r\nreform of the Organization, an issue that will permeate\r\nthe work of the Organization throughout the coming 12\r\nmonths.\r\nAs the report rightly states, the United Nations\r\nhas been through an extraordinarily challenging year.\r\nIn terms of the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, the situation in Iraq alone would, in our view,\r\nbe sufficient to demonstrate the magnitude of the\r\nchallenges facing the Organization. Barely one year\r\nago, the tragic attack against the United Nations\r\nheadquarters in Baghdad took the lives of the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General to Iraq and\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello, and of other dedicated\r\nmembers of the United Nations staff in that country.\r\nAs a member of the Security Council for the\r\nperiod of 2004 to 2005, Brazil has been involved in the\r\ndiscussions regarding the situation in Iraq in a\r\nconstructive spirit, and has striven to contribute to the\r\nreconstruction of that country. Iraq, however, is only\r\none of the many challenges facing the Council. During\r\nthe first nine months of Brazil’s current mandate in the\r\nSecurity Council, the Council has — to mention some\r\nof the major decisions taken — reformed and\r\nrevitalized the main subsidiary committees entrusted\r\nwith combating terrorism, namely the Security Council\r\nCommittee established pursuant to resolution 1267\r\n(1999) concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban and\r\nAssociated Individuals and Entities and the CTC. The\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nCouncil also established a new committee to deal with\r\nthe question of non-State actors’ possible access to\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nIn addition, the need for and the deployment of\r\npeacekeeping operations increased dramatically.\r\nBetween civilian staff and military personnel, more\r\nthan 67,000 people are involved in United Nations-\r\nmandated operations. During the period in question,\r\nnew operations were created in Burundi, Haiti, Liberia\r\nand the Sudan, as the report of the Secretary-General\r\nindicates.\r\nIn Haiti, Brazil is contributing more than 1,200\r\nmilitary personnel to the stabilization efforts. We have\r\naccepted the responsibility of commanding the forces\r\nof the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti,\r\nwith the important participation of other Latin\r\nAmerican countries, on the clear understanding that\r\npeace in that nation in our hemisphere will require a\r\nlong-term commitment from the international\r\ncommunity — a commitment not only to security, but\r\nalso to socio-economic progress. This leads to the\r\nnecessity of increasing cooperation between the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, two of the main bodies of this Organization,\r\nan issue to which I will return later.\r\nPresident Lula opened the general debate of the\r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly with a wide-\r\nranging presentation of Brazil’s perception of the most\r\npressing challenges facing the world today. The key\r\nelement in this vision is the idea that the foundation of\r\npeace is social justice. As President Lula stated, a\r\nworld in which hunger and poverty prevail cannot be a\r\npeaceful world.\r\nAs I turn to issues in the social and economic\r\nsphere, I must refer to the high-level plenary meetings\r\nscheduled to take place at the opening of the next\r\nsession of the General Assembly. The event on the\r\nreview of the progress achieved in the implementation\r\nof the Millennium Declaration constitutes the\r\nappropriate setting for the adoption of the necessary\r\nmeasures and actions to make viable the achievement\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals by the year\r\n2015. There is a consensual appreciation that the\r\ndecisions to be adopted next year will be crucial for the\r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nIn this regard, the President of Brazil, together\r\nwith the Presidents of France, Chile and Spain, and\r\nwith the support of the Secretary-General, launched an\r\n“Action Against Hunger and Poverty” at a summit\r\nmeeting attended by more than 50 world leaders\r\ngathered here in New York on the day before the\r\nopening of the general debate. More than 100 countries\r\nhave already endorsed the New York Declaration on\r\nthe Action against Hunger and Poverty, adopted at that\r\nsummit meeting. The initiative achieved the intended\r\nobjective of renewing the political will to search for\r\nnew sources of financing. We are confident it will also\r\nbe an important contribution to the success of the large\r\nupcoming event of 2005 reviewing the commitments\r\ncontained in the Millennium Declaration, and to the\r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe Secretary-General entrusted the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change with the\r\ncrucial task of identifying the problems faced by the\r\nOrganization and with recommending the adjustments\r\nneeded to correct the current situation. We look\r\nforward to the recommendations now being prepared\r\nby the Panel.\r\nThe Panel must avoid restricting its consideration\r\nof threats and challenges from the perspective of\r\nproblems to be dealt with through coercion or the use\r\nof force. Its approach must be comprehensive, and its\r\nrecommendations should encompass measures to\r\nstrengthen not only the Security Council but also the\r\nother principal organs of the Organization.\r\nIn particular, the Panel must do its best to avoid\r\nexpanding the scope of action of the Council in a\r\nmanner that might detract from the mandated functions\r\nof other organs. Similarly, the Panel must make every\r\neffort to avoid misinterpreting current trends in the\r\nCouncil. The phenomenal increase in Council activity\r\nsince the end of the cold war is an indication not only\r\nthat the major impediments for the adoption of\r\ndecisions were overcome, but also, and perhaps even\r\nmore importantly, that the very foundations for\r\ninternational peace and security were becoming\r\nincreasingly fragile.\r\nAs the Panel carries out its mandate, it must not\r\noverlook the international community’s call for greater\r\nmultilateralism. Heeding the main issues identified by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his presentation of the report\r\non the work of the Organization in the past two years,\r\nthe Panel must present recommendations that will help\r\nright to prevail.\r\nBrazil has well-known views with regard to the\r\ncentral issue of reform of the Organization, which I\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nwill briefly reiterate as they relate to the principal\r\norgans at Headquarters. The Security Council must be\r\nstrengthened and made more legitimate. Its\r\ncomposition, in particular relating to its permanent\r\nmembership, cannot remain unaltered. The United\r\nNations can no longer ignore the emergence on the\r\ninternational scene of developing countries that have\r\nbecome actors and often exercise a critical role in\r\npromoting the peaceful settlement of disputes. The\r\nCouncil must incorporate, on a permanent basis,\r\ncountries that have the will and the capacity to take on\r\nmajor responsibilities with regard to the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. Better\r\nrepresentation means wider legitimacy, and wider\r\nlegitimacy will lead to greater efficiency and efficacy\r\nin the work of the Council.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council, for its part,\r\nmust regain the role bestowed upon it by the Charter.\r\nThe causes of peace and social and economic\r\ndevelopment will be better served by an Economic and\r\nSocial Council that is able to cooperate fully and\r\nactively with the Security Council in preventing\r\nconflicts and in nation-building. Better cooperation\r\nbetween these two bodies under Article 65 of the\r\nCharter is also a necessity. The scope of multilateral\r\ncooperation in conflict management and peace-building\r\nwould thereby be broadened. Let us not forget that the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, and not the Security\r\nCouncil, is the Charter organ with responsibility for\r\nmatters relating to social and economic development.\r\nOne of the ways to improve the functioning of the\r\nSecurity Council itself is to empower the Economic\r\nand Social Council to fulfil its tasks, thus reducing the\r\nburden on the ever-increasing agenda of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe General Assembly, being the universal\r\ndemocratic organ, must be reinforced politically so as\r\nto guide the work of the Organization overall and to\r\nrekindle its status as the forum that traditionally\r\nembodies and gives voice to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter. Its function as the main\r\ndeliberative and policy-making organ of the United\r\nNations must be reasserted.\r\nNext year promises to be decisive in the work of\r\nthe Organization. As the Secretary-General put it in\r\naddressing our Presidents, Prime Ministers and Foreign\r\nMinisters at the 3rd meeting of the current session of\r\nthe General Assembly, “If you ... cannot reach\r\nagreement on the way forward, history will take the\r\ndecisions for you, and the interests of your peoples\r\nmay go by default.”\r\nMr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan): At the outset, let\r\nme express our appreciation to the Secretary-General\r\nfor his comprehensive report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, which, in fact, covers the entire agenda\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity remains the main priority for the international\r\ncommunity. We fully agree with the conclusion that\r\ndurable international peace could be built only on\r\nfoundations of interdependence, rule of law and\r\nmultilateralism. Kazakhstan believes that the United\r\nNations acts as a guarantor of international law.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General clearly\r\ndemonstrates that the United Nations, carrying out a\r\nwide range of activities that reflect all the major\r\ninternational problems, has a great potential in\r\ncoordinating the efforts of States to confront\r\nformidable challenges.\r\nInternational terrorism continues to pose a threat\r\nto humanity. Countering this threat effectively requires\r\nthe consolidation and coordination of global efforts on\r\nthe basis of the generally recognized norms and\r\nprinciples of international law, with the leading and\r\ncoordinating role being played by the United Nations.\r\nIt is crucial in that respect that the Security\r\nCouncil’s Counter-Terrorism Committee more actively\r\nseek to develop new approaches to coordinating\r\ntechnical assistance to States, while closely linking\r\nsuch assistance to the strengthening of interaction with\r\ninternational and regional organizations. We believe\r\nthat with the current escalation of international\r\nterrorism, the role of the Committee should become\r\nmore important.\r\nKazakhstan has acceded to 11 international\r\ncounter-terrorism conventions and calls for the earliest\r\npossible finalization by the United Nations of the\r\ndrafting of a comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism and an international convention\r\nfor the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism.\r\nThe Government of Kazakhstan continues to\r\nincrease its efforts to implement the Security Council\r\nresolutions in this sphere, including 1267 (1999), 1373\r\n(2001), 1456 (2003) and 1535 (2004). The results of\r\n29\r\nA/59/PV.21\r\nthose efforts are reflected in relevant national reports\r\nsubmitted by Kazakhstan.\r\nMy country supports United Nations\r\npeacekeeping efforts and the continued strengthening\r\nof its capacity in that area. With escalating\r\nhumanitarian crises and armed conflicts, as effectively\r\ndemonstrated by the developments in Darfur, the\r\nUnited Nations must pay special attention to the\r\npossibility of broader participation of authoritative\r\nregional and subregional organizations in peacekeeping\r\noperations; this would allow a more effective and more\r\ntimely response to emerging threats.\r\nPrevention, post-conflict peace-building and the\r\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict are the key\r\nelements of the complex response of the United\r\nNations to emerging crisis situations. Kazakhstan is\r\ntherefore a firm supporter of preventive diplomacy and\r\ncontinues to believe that the establishment of a Central\r\nAsian preventive diplomacy centre would be a timely\r\ninitiative.\r\nShared responsibility is a core element of the\r\nUnited Nations Millennium Declaration, adopted by\r\nworld leaders in September 2000. Today, it has become\r\nclear that the attainment of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals is a reality for some countries and\r\na distant hope for others.\r\nIt will be possible to reverse this trend only by\r\ndeveloping international partnerships and building on\r\nthe momentum gained at the turn of the millennium.\r\nWe have 11 more years to achieve all of the goals set at\r\nthe Millennium Summit. That is not very long. But\r\neven in that short period of time it is still possible to\r\nattain the agreed development targets. We believe that\r\nin order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals\r\nwe should apply a new focused approach to the\r\nassistance being provided to the least developed and\r\ngeographically vulnerable States, including the\r\nlandlocked countries, and create a favourable\r\nenvironment for their economic development under\r\nconditions of peace and stability.\r\nA key factor for success could be an increase, in\r\nthe near future, by the developed countries of their\r\nofficial development assistance to up to 0.7 per cent of\r\ntheir gross national product. Other important\r\nconditions include the mobilization of the domestic\r\nresources of the developing countries; a favourable\r\nclimate for their exports; the prompt settlement of the\r\ndebt of the poorest countries; and assistance to the\r\nGovernments of the least developed countries for the\r\nexpansion and strengthening of their educational\r\nprogrammes related to HIV/AIDS, malaria and\r\ntuberculosis.\r\nDuring the World Leaders Summit on Action\r\nAgainst Hunger and Poverty, which was held at United\r\nNations Headquarters last month, heads of State or\r\nGovernment declared that hunger jeopardizes the very\r\nconcept of sustainable development — devised, against\r\nall odds, at the conferences held in New York,\r\nMonterrey and Johannesburg — and, together with\r\npoverty and social injustice, creates a serious threat to\r\nthe security of States and entire regions of the world.\r\nKazakhstan firmly supports the main provisions\r\nof the Final Declaration of the Summit and believes\r\nthat its outcome will provide much-needed impetus to\r\nour joint efforts to address critical issues in our action\r\nagainst hunger and poverty.\r\nPoverty is a problem faced by virtually all\r\ndeveloping countries and economies in transition,\r\nincluding Kazakhstan. My Government pays priority\r\nattention to efforts to combat poverty, and this has\r\nhelped us to achieve significant progress in that\r\nimportant sphere. Unfortunately, the relevant United\r\nNations reports contain some significant inaccuracies\r\nand, as a result, the international community has been\r\nprovided with distorted information about the social\r\nand economic situation in my country.\r\nThe issue of rehabilitation after natural and\r\necological disasters remains, as before, a focus of the\r\nUnited Nations. Kazakhstan is grateful to the United\r\nNations and donor countries for their attention to the\r\nproblems of the Semipalatinsk region and the Aral Sea\r\narea, as well as for their support, and calls on the\r\ninternational community to intensify its efforts to solve\r\nthose problems. We believe that a special General\r\nAssembly resolution on the Aral Sea has long been\r\noverdue, since continued degradation of the\r\nenvironment of the region seriously affects the health\r\nand livelihood of the population.\r\nNext year we will celebrate the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. This will provide an\r\nexcellent opportunity for us to take a fresh look at the\r\nproblems of our world and the ways in which our\r\nOrganization can address them. Kazakhstan is ready to\r\ncontribute to that critically important process.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
