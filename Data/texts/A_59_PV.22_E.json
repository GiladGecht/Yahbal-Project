(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3:05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 10 (continued)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/59/1)\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): First, I would like to thank you, Mr. President,\r\nfor convening this meeting to consider the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/59/1). I would also like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report, in view of its importance in the\r\ncurrent unstable international circumstances, which\r\nrequire further concerted and sincere efforts to face the\r\ngreat challenges to peace, security and development.\r\nWe endorse the statement of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral before this Assembly on the work of the\r\nOrganization, where he stated, regarding the need for a\r\ncommitment to international law and the United\r\nNations Charter in promoting the rule of law and for\r\ncurbing the use of sheer force against the weak, “Those\r\nwho seek to bestow legitimacy must themselves\r\nembody it; and those who invoke international law\r\nmust themselves submit to it.” We agree with all those\r\nwho believe that this Organization is an indispensable\r\nforum for the international community to deal with\r\ngrave challenges and threats, and we view this\r\nOrganization as the best place to promote\r\nmultilateralism and the rule of law in order to be able\r\nto bring about a world of justice, equality and\r\nprosperity.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work\r\nof the Organization is comprehensive and it defines all\r\nthe important issues considered by the United Nations\r\npreviously. Some of those have been solved, and some\r\nare still awaiting international consensus. One\r\nexample, and a source of concern for my delegation, is\r\nthe issue of the Middle East, which is almost as old as\r\nthe United Nations itself, but for which a just and\r\ncomprehensive settlement has not yet been achieved.\r\nIn paragraph 20, the report states, “the peace\r\nprocess remained stalled and violence persisted”. I\r\nbelieve that this can be attributed to the lack of will of\r\na particular party to the conflict, that is Israel, to find a\r\ncomprehensive settlement, to which we all aspire.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General places\r\nimportance on realizing a just and comprehensive\r\npeace. In this regard Syria reaches out for the\r\nrealization of a just and comprehensive peace in\r\naccordance with the relevant resolutions of\r\ninternational legitimacy, particularly Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), as well as the\r\nMadrid peace framework and the Arab Peace Initiative,\r\nin a manner that would restore the occupied Arab\r\nterritories in Golan, Palestine and Lebanon to their\r\nowners. The report, in paragraph 21, alludes to\r\nSecurity Council resolutions on the Middle East and\r\nother resolutions adopted by the General Assembly at\r\nits resumed tenth emergency special session,\r\nparticularly resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004\r\nacknowledging the legal opinion of the International\r\nCourt of Justice on the separation wall being\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nconstructed by Israel on occupied Palestinian\r\nterritories. The Court further required that Israel\r\ncomply with its legal obligations. The resolution also\r\nrequested the Secretary-General to establish a record of\r\nthe damages caused by that wall. While we support the\r\nestablishment of that record, we appeal to the\r\nSecretary-General to expedite the process in view of\r\nthe suffering of the Palestinian people and of the harm\r\nthey have suffered because of the wall.\r\nThe phenomenon of international terrorism has\r\nbecome a source of concern for all. We should work\r\ntogether to eliminate this dangerous phenomenon, and\r\nwe must deal with its root causes. We agree with the\r\nstatement made in paragraph 77 of the report that the\r\nstruggle against terrorism must not take place at the\r\nexpense of the fundamental freedoms and the human\r\ndignity of individuals. We should not therefore deny\r\nthose rights to peoples under the yoke of foreign\r\noccupation that aspire to liberation and independence.\r\nWe should not confuse the exercise of those rights,\r\nwhich are enshrined in the Charter, with terrorism,\r\nwhich we all condemn.\r\nIn that regard, we call again on the United\r\nNations to convene an international conference to\r\narrive at a clear definition of terrorism. We must\r\ndistinguish between terrorism and the legitimate right\r\nof peoples to self-determination in accordance with\r\ninternational law and the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe spread of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nparticularly nuclear weapons, is a source of extreme\r\nconcern to us, and we share the international\r\ncommunity’s concern at the possibility that such\r\nweapons might fall into the hands of terrorists, thereby\r\nexacerbating threats to international peace and security.\r\nSyria has been at the forefront of those countries\r\ncalling for the declaration of the Middle East as a zone\r\nfree of all weapons of mass destruction. We have been\r\nworking with determination towards that objective. We\r\nhave acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT); we have concluded a\r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreement with the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency; and we have\r\ncontributed to numerous initiatives aimed at realizing\r\nthis objective, the latest of which was a draft resolution\r\nintroduced by Syria on behalf of the Arab Group on\r\n29 December 2003, to free the Middle East of nuclear\r\nweapons and weapons of mass destruction, under\r\ncollective international supervision and under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations, so as to promote\r\nmultilateral international agreements in the field of\r\ndisarmament.\r\nAs stated in paragraph 116 of the report, the eight\r\nMillennium Development Goals continue to provide a\r\nunifying framework for the activities of the United\r\nNations in the area of cooperation for development. In\r\nthe Millennium Declaration, world leaders stressed the\r\nimportance of creating an environment conducive to\r\ndevelopment and to the eradication of poverty at both\r\nthe national and international levels. Development is a\r\nhuman right that should be provided to all — not a\r\nbenefit to some at the expense of others no matter how\r\nimmense the disparity between the two. It should have\r\na high priority on our agenda, and the process should\r\nnot be exploited in order to achieve political gains.\r\nWe believe that collective efforts to address\r\ndevelopment issues and to combat poverty and hunger\r\nin the developing world in general and in Africa in\r\nparticular will greatly contribute to addressing the root\r\ncauses of the crises facing today’s world.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to stress\r\nthe importance of multilateralism in the Organization’s\r\nefforts to lay the groundwork for tackling all the\r\nchallenges and security threats facing us. We look\r\nforward to the report of the High-Level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change established by the\r\nSecretary-General, and we will actively participate in\r\nall discussions on the recommendations made by the\r\nPanel so we can achieve the common goals that the\r\nentire world looks forward to.\r\nMr. Danesh-Yazdi (Islamic Republic of Iran): I\r\nwould like to convey our sincere thanks to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, which makes clear the ever-increasing\r\nnumber and scope of the functions of the Organization.\r\nThe report reflects the realities on the ground with\r\nrespect to the various challenges and opportunities\r\nfacing the international community. It once again\r\nstresses that it is only through collective action and a\r\nmultilateral approach that the United Nations can\r\nrealize the lofty objectives enshrined in its Charter.\r\nIn the meantime, we also look forward to\r\nreviewing the recommendations of the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change. My\r\ndelegation believes that the Panel was entrusted with a\r\nsolemn responsibility, and, accordingly, expects that its\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nrecommendations will identify and encompass the\r\nobjective realities of the threats and challenges\r\nconfronting the global community today.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran shares the\r\nSecretary-General’s view that the concepts of the rule\r\nof law and multilateralism form the only rational basis\r\nfor a civilized discourse among nations. There is no\r\ndoubt that those concepts were a profound source of\r\ninspiration for the architects of the Charter and\r\nconstitute the driving force behind the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security through multilateral\r\nand proactive cooperation among all equal and\r\nsovereign nations.\r\nIn an era of globalization and at a time when\r\nnational, regional and global peace and stability are so\r\ninterlinked and interdependent, it is essential that the\r\nsupremacy of the law supersede political exigency.\r\nIndeed, multilateral approaches compatible with the\r\nglobalized nature of the current international arena\r\ncould be pursued within the framework of a civilized\r\ndialogue among nations and in tandem with the\r\nsustained promotion of international law.\r\nAny circumventive action based on the logic of\r\n“might makes right” and characterized by the unilateral\r\nand lawless use of force would jeopardize the\r\nfundamental pillars of the Organization. Against that\r\nbackground, we fully endorse the remarks made by the\r\nSecretary-General in his opening address to this body:\r\n“At the international level, all States — strong\r\nand weak, big and small — need a framework of\r\nfair rules, which each can be confident that others\r\nwill obey.” (A/59/PV.3, p. 3)\r\nI need hardly reiterate that the selective\r\napplication or arbitrary enforcement of the law is\r\ndetrimental to the realization of that objective.\r\nIn that context, and as noted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, international peace and stability can be built\r\nonly on a solid foundation of interdependence, which is\r\ncentral for realizing the rule of law and multilateralism.\r\nIt also needs to be underlined that the principle of\r\nshared responsibility lies at the heart of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. That concept represents a fundamental\r\nvalue universally recognized by that Declaration, by\r\nwhich the responsibility for managing worldwide\r\neconomic and social development as well as threats to\r\ninternational peace and security should be shared\r\namong all nations.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s perspective on the issue\r\nof peace and security must be considered thoroughly.\r\nIn that respect, my delegation has noted the reference\r\nmade in the report to the situation in Iraq, including the\r\nimportance of the presence of the United Nations in\r\nthat country and the overall security environment,\r\nwhich has so far prevented a larger United Nations\r\npresence in Iraq. While concurring with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that a higher level of security is needed in\r\norder for the United Nations to have a larger presence\r\nin Iraq, we are of the view that the United Nations\r\nshould more actively engage in a process aimed at\r\nempowering the Iraqi people to determine their own\r\ndestiny.\r\nAs a neighbouring country of Iraq that highly\r\nvalues the emergence of that country as a stable, free\r\nand democratic State, Iran believes that an independent\r\nand prosperous Iraq, with a Government representing\r\nall classes in society and holding free and fair elections\r\nas scheduled, are essential steps towards the realization\r\nof Iraq’s full sovereignty and towards its stability.\r\nAs noted by the Secretary-General, the situation\r\nin the occupied Palestinian territories, and especially\r\nthe humanitarian living conditions of Palestinians,\r\ncontinues to deteriorate. He rightly asserted a few days\r\nago that recent measures have led to the deaths of\r\nscores of Palestinians, among them civilians, including\r\nchildren. It is alarming and very unfortunate that the\r\nSecurity Council has yet to reach an agreement on the\r\nway to prevent the persistence of the crimes that\r\ncontinue to be committed against Palestinians.\r\nOn the situation in Afghanistan, we believe that\r\nthe recent massive popular participation of the Afghan\r\npeople in the voter registration exercise is a clear sign\r\nthat the Afghan nation is able and willing to determine\r\nits own destiny. Holding fair and free presidential and\r\nlegislative elections and establishing a broad-based,\r\nrepresentative and multi-ethnic Government are vital\r\nsteps towards the democratization and reconstruction\r\nof the country. Nevertheless, we agree with the\r\nSecretary-General that a major obstacle to the success\r\nof the Bonn process is the increased cultivation of\r\nnarcotics, which fuels both factional fighting and\r\nterrorism. Indeed, the problem of drugs cultivation and\r\ntrafficking have put political, economic and social\r\ndevelopment and regional stability in danger.\r\nIn the field of disarmament, we share the views\r\nso eloquently advanced by the Secretary-General that\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nweapons of mass destruction remain of paramount\r\nimportance to international peace and security.\r\nNevertheless, it is our considered view that the\r\ncontinued existence of thousands of nuclear warheads\r\nin the stockpiles of nuclear-weapon States and the new\r\nplans of one of these States to produce usable mini-\r\nnuclear weapons — together with its doctrine of\r\nunilateral or pre-emptive use of force, including\r\nlowering the threshold for the use of mini-nuclear\r\nweapons — all serve to increase the legitimate\r\nconcerns of the international community.\r\nWe strongly believe that the total elimination of\r\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction is the only absolute guarantee against the\r\npossible use or threat of use of those weapons. The\r\ncontinued existence and development of nuclear\r\nweapons will only increase the possibility of\r\nunauthorized access by non-State actors to those\r\ninhuman weapons. Although Security Council\r\nresolution 1540 (2004) is considered a preventive\r\nmeasure against that threat, it lacks due attention to the\r\nuniversality of existing multilateral disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation treaties and instruments as the\r\nhighest priority of the international community.\r\nEqually important is the issue of international\r\nterrorism, which — in the words of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral — casts its shadow over all the peoples of the\r\nworld. The United Nations must therefore be engaged\r\nin the struggle against terrorism. Effective measures to\r\ncounter international terrorism also require broad\r\ninternational cooperation. We fully share the view of\r\nthe Secretary-General that “As we join forces against\r\nterrorism, it is imperative that freedom, human rights\r\nand the rule of law be upheld and protected”. (A/59/1,\r\npara. 9)\r\nHowever, an objective review of recent\r\ndevelopments in the international arena confirm the\r\nfact that violence and terrorism on the part of non-State\r\nactors, on the one hand, and unrestrained militarism on\r\nthe part of certain States, on the other, are two faces of\r\nextremism that are mutually reinforcing, and which are\r\nfatally contributing to the escalation of global\r\ninsecurity and lawlessness. Accordingly, the\r\ninternational community must work together to find a\r\nway out of that vicious cycle. To achieve that goal,\r\nunambiguous unity of purpose is essential.\r\nInternational cooperation for development is a\r\nmajor issue on the agenda of the United Nations.\r\nConsiderable efforts have been made towards the\r\nrealization of the Development Goals set out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. Nonetheless, much remains to\r\nbe done. Large parts of the world suffer from poverty,\r\nhunger and the lack of proper education and health\r\nservices. Many factors, including good governance and\r\nrespect for the rule of law and human rights, contribute\r\nto economic and social development. However, we\r\ncannot, and should not, undermine the critical role that\r\nscience and technology play in promoting economic\r\nand social development in many developing countries.\r\nIt would therefore be appropriate to strengthen\r\nthe role of the Organization in transferring knowledge\r\nand technology in all fields to those countries. A\r\nserious obstacle to development is the proliferation and\r\napplication of economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargoes, as well as the imposition of extraterritorial\r\nmeasures and sanctions against developing countries.\r\nThose actions are not only in contravention of the basic\r\nprinciples of international law and the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, but also adversely affect the economic\r\nand social development of targeted States. The time is\r\nright for the Organization to consider how to address\r\nthe situation and establish an international environment\r\nfor meaningful cooperation for development.\r\nWe believe the issue of the HIV/AIDS pandemic\r\nto be a serious health threat that has a negative impact\r\non development, and should therefore be given the\r\nhighest priority by the international community.\r\nHowever, the magnitude of the threat, which truly\r\nneeds a global response, should not divert attention\r\nfrom the role and responsibility of the United Nations\r\nin other areas of development.\r\nAlong the same lines, it is rather discouraging\r\nthat the report of the Secretary-General has not\r\naddressed the very important issue of globalization,\r\ndespite the current debates taking place at the regional\r\nand global levels. It also appears that macroeconomic\r\npolicy issues have fallen into oblivion. Instead, we\r\nhave noted a commentary in the report of the\r\nCommission on the Private Sector and Development,\r\nthe content of which should not overshadow other\r\ncritical aspects of the work of the Organization in the\r\narea of development.\r\nWith regard to sustainable development, we\r\nsupport the work of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in following up the implementation of\r\nAgenda 21 and the Johannesburg Plan of\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nImplementation. The twelfth session of the\r\nCommission, which was the first substantive meeting\r\nof the Commission after the holding of the\r\nJohannesburg Summit, conveyed a strong and\r\ncourageous message about the need to further\r\nstrengthen the implementation of Agenda 21 and the\r\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation. In that regard,\r\nwe share the views of the Secretary-General with\r\nregard to the need for the United Nations to enhance\r\ninter-agency coordination and strengthen the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 and the Johannesburg\r\nPlan of Implementation, with a view to supporting\r\ncapacity-building activities at the country level.\r\nWe take note of the Secretary-General’s\r\nestablishment of the Advisory Board on Water and\r\nSanitation. It is our hope that by raising awareness and\r\nmobilizing resources, the Advisory Board’s\r\nrecommendations can strengthen the implementation of\r\nintergovernmental agreements contained in Agenda 21\r\nand the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. In our\r\nview, the Board should focus on finding practical ways\r\nto improve implementation, rather than engage in the\r\npolicy debate on water and sanitation, which is indeed\r\nthe task of the Commission at its next session.\r\nHumanitarian assistance and humanitarian\r\nresponse, particularly in cases of urgency and natural\r\ndisaster, remain a priority for the United Nations.\r\nAccording to the Secretary General’s report,\r\n“In 2003 some 700 disasters resulted in\r\n75,000 deaths and economic losses of more than\r\n$65 billion. The death toll was many times higher\r\nthan that for the previous year, largely because of\r\nthe earthquake in Bam, Islamic Republic of Iran.”\r\n(ibid., para. 109)\r\nI am referring to the tragedy of the earthquake in\r\nBam not only to emphasize the importance of an issue\r\nof a purely humanitarian nature, but also to\r\nwholeheartedly express our appreciation for the\r\nhumanitarian assistance offered by all States to the\r\nearthquake survivors. We are also thankful to the\r\nvarious United Nations agencies, in particular the\r\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs, and to the International\r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\r\nfor their timely and tireless efforts in coordinating and\r\nproviding humanitarian assistance. In fact, the people\r\nand the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\ntook a leading role, to the best of their ability, in\r\nassisting the victims of that catastrophic earthquake.\r\nNext year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, which coincides with the review of the\r\nimplementation of the Global Agenda for Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations. The review can provide an\r\navenue for fresh thinking about today’s opportunities\r\nand challenges. The international community will be in\r\na position to further advance this paradigm to promote\r\npeace, democracy and development.\r\nMr. Dolgov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The Secretary-General has rightly noted in\r\nhis report on the work of the Organization (A/59/1)\r\nthat the United Nations has been through an\r\nextraordinarily challenging year. We have all seen and\r\nparticipated in heated discussions about what the role\r\nof the Organization should be today. It is well known\r\nthat truth is born in debate, and the truth is that the\r\nUnited Nations is still the most universal tool for\r\nregulating international relations in conditions of\r\nglobalization; there is no alternative to it. The work of\r\nthe fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly shows\r\nconvincingly that, when the United Nations lives up to\r\nits potential, we can have real hope that current\r\nproblems in the areas of security and cooperation\r\namong States will be resolved.\r\nThe unprecedented wave of terrorism sweeping\r\nover the world has shown how irreplaceable the United\r\nNations is in coordinating the fight against terrorism.\r\nToday, Russia, together with other countries, is\r\nworking towards the adoption of a new Security\r\nCouncil resolution to combat terrorism. Building on\r\nthe relevant prior Security Council decisions, the draft\r\nresolution lays out a clear strategy of collective action\r\nfor the international community to combat terrorism.\r\nThe Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee is the main coordinating body in this area.\r\nAs its current Chairman, Russia will continue actively\r\nto contribute to strengthening its capacity and to\r\nincreasing its cooperation with international and\r\nregional organizations including the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States (CIS), the Collective Security\r\nTreaty Organization and the Shanghai Cooperation\r\nOrganization. We can conquer terrorism only if we act\r\ntogether, based firmly on the United Nations Charter\r\nand the norms of international law. Arbitrary action\r\ngives rise to further violence in response. This is why\r\nwe cannot but agree with the Secretary-General that we\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nmust work in every possible way to strengthen the rule\r\nof law.\r\nWe must provide guarantees to prevent access by\r\nterrorists to weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).\r\nThis is one of the most serious challenges to security\r\nfor all members of the international community.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1540 (2004) sets out the\r\nbasis and mechanisms of a coordinated response to the\r\nblack market in WMDs, and is aimed at increasing the\r\neffectiveness of non-proliferation regimes. We have a\r\ncommon interest in achieving real progress in this area.\r\nA convincing indicator of the growing need for\r\nthe presence of the United Nations is the increase in\r\nthe Organization’s peacekeeping operations, especially\r\nin Africa. The past year has been marked by significant\r\nsuccess in settling conflicts, notably in Sierra Leone,\r\nLiberia, Haiti and a number of other hotspots. We hope\r\nthat the time is near for comprehensive settlements in\r\nSudan, Afghanistan, Burundi and Côte d’Ivoire. Yet\r\nmany other regional conflagrations remain to be\r\nextinguished. Iraq and the Middle East are just two of\r\nthe items on that list.\r\nWe can achieve our goal only by working\r\ntogether under the aegis of the United Nations and by\r\nintensifying the Organization’s interaction with\r\nregional partners pursuant to Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter.\r\nAt our initiative, at the two previous sessions of\r\nthe General Assembly, important resolutions were\r\nadopted by consensus on developing a global strategy\r\nto respond to threats and challenges, with the United\r\nNations playing a central role (resolutions 57/145 and\r\n58/16). Realization of this initiative will bring to\r\nfruition the ideal of collective security, as enshrined in\r\nthe Charter. We hope that work in this area will\r\ncontinue during the current session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nIt is important that the work of the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change should\r\ncontinue in this spirit. We hope that its\r\nrecommendations will enable us to increase the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations and other\r\nmultilateral institutions. The Panel is expected to\r\ncontribute to reform of the United Nations and its\r\nSecurity Council. The process should culminate in the\r\nbroadest possible agreement among Member States, in\r\nthe common interest of strengthening the United\r\nNations.\r\nAs the world becomes increasingly\r\ninterdependent, the United Nations should pay\r\nparticular attention to combating poverty and illiteracy,\r\nespecially since these create a breeding ground for\r\nterrorism and extremism. We must guarantee equitable\r\ndevelopment and combat the spread of serious diseases\r\nsuch as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.\r\nThe Russian Government is aware of Russia’s\r\nresponsibility for the future of the planet and has\r\ndecided to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. We hope that this\r\nissue will soon be resolved positively in the State\r\nDuma of the Russian Federation.\r\nUnited Nations activities in the socio-economic\r\narea should be focused on achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and on implementing the\r\nagreements made at high-level United Nations\r\nconferences and meetings. We must give the United\r\nNations effective capacities to mobilize, with a view to\r\ndeveloping and implementing strategies in the area of\r\ninternational trade, finance and investment.\r\nPreparations are under way for the upcoming\r\nsixtieth anniversary celebrations and the summit on the\r\nfive-year review of the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration; these will enable us to work\r\nharder to achieve the lofty goals and ideals of the\r\nOrganization. Russia is ready to continue working\r\nclosely with all its partners to complete that massive\r\nbut noble task.\r\nMrs. Laohaphan (Thailand): Let me begin by\r\nthanking the Secretary-General for his comprehensive\r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/59/1). The\r\nreport is an annual assessment of developments and of\r\nthe progress made by the United Nations in all areas of\r\nendeavour — as well as the lack thereof and the\r\nobstacles faced by the Organization in implementing\r\nits mandates.\r\nAs the United Nations approaches its sixtieth\r\nanniversary, it is a timely occasion to look back, to take\r\nstock of its accomplishments and to make the\r\nnecessary adjustments in order to forge ahead. The\r\nyear 2005 has, as we know, been earmarked for the\r\nreview of the Millennium Development Goals and for\r\nthe convening of important debates on United Nations\r\nreform, based on the report and recommendations that\r\nthe High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\r\nChange will provide to the Secretary-General in\r\nDecember of this year. Therefore, we should focus our\r\nattention even more sharply on this year’s report on the\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nwork of the Organization in preparation for the\r\nwatershed events of next year.\r\nA recurrent theme emanating of the report is the\r\ngrowing demand placed upon the United Nations to\r\ncope with the world’s problems, with restricted human\r\nand financial resources. This is a reality that is\r\nconstantly echoed by the Department of Public\r\nInformation, which has done a wonderful job in\r\npublicizing the fact. If one were to search on the web\r\npage of the United Nations News Service for in-house\r\narticles published since the opening of the current\r\nsession relating to the problem of funding at the United\r\nNations, one would find almost 20 articles that tell of\r\nthe shortfalls that have obstructed the United Nations\r\nagencies’ efforts in the areas of opening access to\r\nuniversal reproductive health care, combating\r\nHIV/AIDS, dealing with swarming locusts in north-\r\nwest Africa, fighting a malaria epidemic in Ethiopia,\r\nfighting world poverty and hunger, moving the peace\r\nprocess forward in Liberia, carrying out ceasefire\r\nmonitoring activities in Darfur and helping Haiti\r\nrecover from natural disaster, to name just a few of the\r\nmost prominent news stories.\r\nAs arbiter of world peace and security, guarantor\r\nof human rights and dignity and promoter of\r\ndevelopment and economic and social well-being for\r\nthe poor and the needy, the United Nations has been\r\nincessantly called upon to solve the world’s most\r\npressing problems. However, the means provided to the\r\nOrganization are not commensurate with the magnitude\r\nand complexity of the tasks assigned to it.\r\nThe report notes the surge in demand for United\r\nNations peacekeeping and peace-building activities,\r\nwhich currently involve 16 operations around the\r\nworld and more than 56,000 peacekeepers, and links\r\nthe success of new operations to continued political,\r\nfinancial and human resources support from Member\r\nStates. According to statistics cited by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, over the entire course of its nearly six-decade\r\nhistory, the United Nations has spent just over\r\n$30 billion on peacekeeping — a mere thirtieth of\r\nglobal military expenditures last year alone.\r\nConsidering what the United Nations has accomplished\r\nin this area, it is clear that the world has been reaping a\r\npeace dividend from investing in peacekeeping. This\r\ninvestment is a relatively small sum compared to the\r\namount that the world is spending on defence each\r\nyear. The figure also suggests the world’s capacity to\r\npay. It is thus incumbent upon Member States to help\r\nensure that the United Nations is able to fully\r\nimplement its peace and security mandates by paying\r\ntheir peacekeeping assessments in full and on time.\r\nThailand welcomes and supports the continued\r\nintensification of the partnership between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations in pursuit of the\r\nshared goals of peace, stability and development in a\r\nframework of democratic governance and respect for\r\nhuman rights, justice and the rule of law, as stated in\r\nthe report. The involvement of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States in Côte d’Ivoire\r\nand Liberia, of the Organization of American States in\r\nHaiti and of the African Union (AU) in Darfur are\r\ngood examples of burden-sharing and of relegating\r\nresponsibility to organizations that possess a deeper\r\nunderstanding of the regional dimensions and\r\nimplications of security problems.\r\nIn Thailand’s immediate region, the Association\r\nof South-East Asian Nations is in the process of\r\nestablishing a region-wide security community by the\r\nyear 2020. The question that States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations should explore is how we can help\r\nregional organizations sustain adequate logistic,\r\nfinancial and human capabilities on their own. As the\r\nNigerian President told the Security Council with\r\nrespect to the AU’s presence in Darfur,\r\n“We should avoid a situation where African\r\nUnion troops on the ground are handicapped\r\nowing to a lack of requisite financial resources\r\nand logistics support.” (S/PV.5043, p. 5)\r\nHumanitarian assistance is another area in which\r\nfunding falls far below the mark. The report states that\r\nboth new and protracted conflicts, as well as natural\r\ndisasters, continue to take a toll on the world’s poor,\r\noften undermining whatever progress has been\r\nachieved or creating new emergencies. Haiti is a case\r\nin point, where an environmental catastrophe has made\r\nit much more difficult for the country to restore its\r\ndevastated economy, not to mention its political system\r\nand the rule of law. In the report, the Secretary-General\r\nvoices his concern that the consequences of natural\r\nhazards pose a great challenge to achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The\r\nimplementation of disaster-reduction activities will\r\nhopefully help to lower the risk posed by natural\r\ncalamity. However, humanitarian crises, such as food\r\ninsecurity, displaced populations and human rights\r\nabuse, especially against women and children, are\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nhappening in the four corners of the world and require\r\nan urgent and coordinated response from relief\r\nagencies and, most of all, funding from the\r\ninternational community.\r\nHowever, money is not the solution to the world’s\r\nills. Money can be pumped into a country to help\r\nalleviate its economic hardship, but it will not enable\r\nthat country to survive and thrive on its own. To ensure\r\nthat a country reaches the eight MDGs and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, partnership for development may well be\r\nthe best long-term solution. Thailand agrees that there\r\nis a need to expand trade, increase official development\r\nassistance, relieve foreign debt and reform the\r\ninternational financial system. Thailand also supports\r\nthe initiative launched by Brazil, France, Chile and\r\nSpain to explore new sources of funding to fight\r\npoverty and hunger.\r\nThe ability of the United Nations to respond to\r\nthreats and challenges effectively depends on the\r\nresources and manpower available to it, which, in turn,\r\ndepend on the contributions and commitment of\r\nMember States. The report also mentions how regular\r\nbudget contributions have also fallen behind, severely\r\ncurtailing the level of cash available. This is a chronic\r\nproblem faced by the United Nations because of delays\r\nin payment and the accumulating arrears of Member\r\nStates. Failure to pay in full and on time will also\r\nadversely impact the work of the International\r\nTribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, as\r\nthe report warns.\r\nA major challenge to the United Nations in this\r\nregard is how to ensure the political will of each and\r\nevery Member State and how to instil a sense of global\r\nresponsibility. Political will and commitment of States\r\ndo not come from the leadership of policy-makers\r\nalone. To gain support for the United Nations, public\r\nawareness must be galvanized as well. People should\r\nunderstand the role and contribution of the United\r\nNations as well as the gravity of the issues that the\r\nUnited Nations tries to address, so that public support\r\nfor the work of the Organization can be generated.\r\nThe report concludes with a chapter on\r\npartnerships, in which the Secretary-General discusses\r\nthe reorganization of the Department of Public\r\nInformation and the need to encourage public dialogue\r\non many important issues. Campaigns to increase\r\nawareness of the danger of HIV/AIDS, particularly in\r\ndonor countries, have led to broad support in recent\r\nyears in terms of resources, actions and partnerships\r\namong all actors. It is heartening to learn that the\r\nUnited Nations Fund for International Partnerships\r\n(UNFIP) now functions as a clearinghouse for\r\npartnership information and a facilitator of funding\r\nopportunities for the United Nations, especially\r\nthrough the advice that it has been giving to external\r\nentities on how they can assist in the achievement of\r\nthe MDGs.\r\nThailand encourages wider partnerships between\r\nthe United Nations and civil society, corporations and\r\nother stakeholders, since such alliances will help the\r\nOrganization cope more effectively with the present-\r\nday challenges of the globalized world.\r\nMs. Holguín-Cuellar (Colombia) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I thank the Secretary-General for the\r\npreparation and presentation of his report on the work\r\nof the Organization (A/59/1). The report informs us, as\r\nit does every year, of the important work that the\r\nUnited Nations is doing to achieve world peace and\r\nsecurity and to promote the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of peoples, respect for human rights and\r\nthe fulfilment of humanitarian commitments.\r\nColombia recognizes and commends that work.\r\nPresident Uribe also did so last week, during his\r\naddress to the General Assembly (see A/59/PV.15),\r\nwhen he described the progress made by the\r\nColombian Government in the social arena and thanked\r\nthe 21 United Nations agencies that work in my\r\ncountry for their support. All these United Nations\r\ninstitutions, including the Special Adviser to the\r\nSecretary-General on Colombia, work in complete\r\nindependence, with the full support and backing of the\r\nGovernment and in close cooperation with State and\r\ncivil society institutions.\r\nAs the international community knows, the\r\ncurrent and recent Governments of Colombia have\r\nalways been open to engaging in dialogue with illegal\r\narmed groups. When President Uribe was inaugurated\r\nin August 2002, he reiterated his availability for\r\ndialogue on the basis of a ceasefire and an end to\r\nhostilities on the part of the illegal armed groups. He\r\nhas also requested the continuation of the good offices\r\nthat the Secretary-General has maintained since 1999\r\nthrough his Special Adviser on Colombia.\r\nThe national Government remains open to the\r\npossibility of dialogue with all illegal armed groups\r\nthat cease hostilities and show a clear willingness for\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\npeace. In that context, we have initiated a process with\r\nself-defence groups that should result in the total\r\ndemobilization of their members by the end of 2005, as\r\nestablished in the Santa Fe de Ralito Agreement of\r\n15 July 2003. That process — which is moving\r\nforward under the supervision of the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, and in which some European\r\ncountries have shown interest in participating —\r\ndeserves full support so that it can achieve the\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reinsertion of\r\nthousands of members of that illegal armed group.\r\nThe Government of Colombia has undertaken\r\nsignificant peace efforts with other illegal armed\r\ngroups. A broad and flexible proposal was recently sent\r\nto the National Liberation Army through the\r\nGovernment of Mexico, which has been working on a\r\nfacilitation effort. Likewise, the Colombian\r\nGovernment appreciates the good offices employed by\r\nthe United Nations aimed at a rapprochement with the\r\nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)\r\nwith regard to a humanitarian agreement. A proposal\r\naimed at liberating kidnapped persons has been sent\r\nthrough the Swiss Government to that illegal armed\r\ngroup.\r\nAll those efforts are well known in national\r\npublic opinion and in the international community. But,\r\nas the people and the Government of Colombia have\r\nremained open to those who show a willingness to\r\nenter into a serious negotiation process, we remain\r\nsteadfast in our fight against terrorism and violence,\r\nwhich each year cause tens of thousands of deaths and\r\nconsume 5.8 per cent of the country’s gross domestic\r\nproduct.\r\nTo deal with those scourges, we have been\r\nimplementing a democratic security policy, which is\r\nalready producing impressive results, such as a police\r\npresence in all the country’s municipalities and\r\ndeclines of 22 per cent in homicides, 35 per cent in\r\nmassacres and 34.7 per cent in kidnappings. That\r\npolicy — which also covers the fight against the\r\nproduction and trafficking of illicit drugs — has also\r\nenabled us, for the first time, to reverse the growth\r\ntrend of illegal crops, whose cultivation has declined\r\nby 30 per cent annually since 2002. The most recent\r\nreport of the United Nations Office on Drugs and\r\nCrime recorded that significant success.\r\nI make these observations to clarify the fact that\r\nwhat paragraph 31 of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/59/1) describes as “an intensive military\r\ncampaign against the two major guerrilla groups” is\r\nactually the most successful security policy Colombia\r\nhas ever implemented — a policy that is restoring the\r\nrule of law throughout the national territory, has\r\nreduced violence and terrorism with strict respect for\r\nhuman rights and has reduced the rate of internal\r\ndisplacement by 40 per cent. It is a policy aimed at\r\nprotecting the Colombian civilian population, which\r\nfor decades has suffered from terrorism perpetrated by\r\nillegal groups.\r\nThe democratic security policy is not opposed to\r\na negotiated settlement; that is one of its goals and is\r\neven becoming its basis. A lasting peace requires\r\ndialogue and effective institutions. The Constitution\r\nand the law are the best guarantees that we will go\r\ndown that road with transparency and seriousness. The\r\nconsolidation of a firm and transparent authority\r\ndepends on a similarly firm approach towards all\r\nillegal armed groups, without any distinction. During\r\nthis administration, the fight against self-defence\r\ngroups has been the strongest and most impressive in\r\nthe country’s recent history. Among members of these\r\ngroups, the number of those killed has increased by\r\n210 per cent, with the number of those captured rising\r\n280 per cent.\r\nSince its beginning, this Government has worked\r\nto demobilize members of guerrilla and self-defence\r\ngroups. Today 6,000 people, both men and women,\r\nhave deserted the ranks of such groups. The\r\nGovernment is carrying out a programme to help those\r\npeople return to civilian life. Fifty-seven per cent are\r\nmembers of FARC, 22 per cent are members of the\r\nUnited Self-Defence Forces of Colombia, 17 per cent\r\nare members of the National Liberation Army and\r\n4 per cent belong to other dissident groups. This\r\nprogramme — vital for our peace and national\r\nreconciliation efforts — represents an enormous\r\nfinancial and logistical effort for a country like\r\nColombia. That is why we require the support and\r\ncooperation of the international community and of the\r\nUnited Nations to provide these thousands of\r\nColombians with an alternative to a life of violence.\r\nThe Colombian Government appreciates the\r\nassistance and cooperation of the international\r\ncommunity with regard to our peace and national\r\nreconciliation efforts. The support provided by the\r\nOrganization of American States (OAS) in the area of\r\nverifying and supplementing the efforts aimed at\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\ndialogue in my country has been invaluable. Likewise,\r\nwe welcome all cooperation and support initiatives\r\nfrom international bodies and friendly countries,\r\nwhich, at the request of the Colombian Government,\r\nmay enable us to reach a definitive and lasting peace.\r\nWe appreciate and thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor the actions he has taken in using his good offices,\r\nwhich have been requested by the Colombian\r\nGovernment. Moreover, we consider it appropriate to\r\njointly assess the relevance and effectiveness of the\r\ncontacts that the Special Envoy has made with the\r\nillegal armed groups.\r\nFinally, with regard to the draft legislation on\r\njustice and reparation, we should note that it would be\r\napplied not only to the self-defence groups that have\r\nbegun peace dialogues with the Government, but to all\r\nillegal armed groups that decide to lay down their\r\nweapons and enter into a serious negotiation process.\r\nFor the Colombian Government, it is clear that those\r\nresponsible for atrocities or crimes against humanity —\r\nwhether they be members of guerrilla or self-defence\r\ngroups — cannot benefit from pardons or amnesties.\r\nSuch cases require additional legal instruments that\r\nrecognize the principles governing the fight against\r\nimpunity: truth, justice and reparation. To that end, the\r\nGovernment has elaborated the draft legislation on\r\njustice and reparation, which, after having been\r\nconsidered in the Senate and discussed at public\r\nhearings, is now being considered in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. The objective is to obtain a legal\r\ninstrument, based on the broadest possible national\r\nconsensus, which will enable us to try persons who\r\nhave participated in peace processes but are\r\nresponsible for atrocities.\r\nThe people and the Government of Colombia are\r\naware of the humanitarian and human rights situation\r\ncreated by violence and the rise of terrorism in our\r\ncountry. That is why, more than discussing the total\r\nnumbers of internally displaced persons — which are\r\nimpossible to calculate exactly and which trivialize a\r\nhuman tragedy — we are committed to giving such\r\npersons sufficient and timely attention. The current\r\nGovernment has multiplied by eight times the financial\r\nresources allocated to assist that highly vulnerable\r\npopulation. The investment budget of the social\r\nsolidarity network — an entity whose mandate is to\r\nassist such persons — has grown from $14 million in\r\n2002 to $120 million for 2005. More than 70,000\r\ninternally displaced persons have returned, and we are\r\nworking hard to consolidate peace in the regions and\r\nthus to ensure more massive returns.\r\nHowever, as the situation requires coordination\r\nand cooperation with the United Nations system on the\r\npart of all parties that work in the humanitarian area —\r\nincluding regional and local Governments, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, international\r\norganizations and donor countries — in Colombia we\r\nhave begun to negotiate on a second humanitarian\r\nassistance plan that will require the firm commitment,\r\nnot only of the Government of Colombia, but of all the\r\nparties involved and of the United Nations system, as\r\nwell as international cooperation.\r\nI should like to conclude by mentioning another\r\nhumanitarian tragedy that Colombia is experiencing as\r\na result of illegal armed groups. I am referring to the\r\nantipersonnel mines that they have planted throughout\r\nthe country, which kill and maim mostly Colombian\r\nsoldiers and police, but also defenceless civilians —\r\nparticularly children — and prevent development in\r\nvast areas of the Colombian countryside. We are\r\ngrateful for the international cooperation provided to\r\nus by non-governmental organizations and\r\ninternational organizations such as the OAS and the\r\nUnited Nations in the dangerous work of demining\r\nvarious countries. We reaffirm the importance of\r\ncontinuing and increasing the assistance and\r\ninternational cooperation in that regard.\r\nMr. Paolillo (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): This\r\nyear’s report of the Secretary-General (A/59/1) once\r\nagain reveals, as in previous years, the profound\r\nimbalance that affects cooperative efforts to try to\r\nresolve, through the United Nations, the great problems\r\nfaced by humanity. It is an imbalance between the\r\nOrganization’s ambitious objectives and its limited\r\nmeans to attain them.\r\nFor example, in the area of peacekeeping and\r\npeace-building, the demand for the human and\r\nfinancial resources needed to ensure the success of old\r\nand new peacekeeping operations has increased\r\nconsiderably, but what is offered to satisfy that demand\r\ncontinues to be insufficient and slow. Recently, the\r\nSecurity Council approved an increase in troops in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, where Uruguay has\r\ndeployed a contingent of 2,000 officials and soldiers\r\nfor a number of years. But the authorized increase was\r\nless than half of what the Secretary-General considered\r\nnecessary. Troops for the new operations in Liberia,\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, Burundi and Haiti have not always been\r\ndeployed in the numbers required or with the necessary\r\nspeed.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General identifies\r\nnumerous sectors of international cooperation in which\r\nthere are disturbing signs of violations, non-\r\ncompliance and lack of commitment by States with\r\nrespect to international agreements. Those include the\r\nsectors of disarmament, non-proliferation, the ban on\r\nnuclear testing, the ban on anti-personnel landmines,\r\nthe Statute of the International Criminal Court and\r\nbiological diversity. We find similar shortcomings in\r\nthe areas of social, economic and political cooperation.\r\nWe can recall various instances of shortfalls in\r\nfinancial contributions for humanitarian and\r\ndevelopment objectives.\r\nThe Secretary-General notes that progress in\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals has been\r\nuneven and that so far, four years after the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, there have been few positive results.\r\nHowever, he also notes that some time-bound and\r\nmeasurable goals are still achievable by the deadline of\r\n2015, but that will be possible only if developed and\r\ndeveloping countries fulfil their commitments and\r\nproperly implement agreed social and economic\r\npolicies and mobilize promised financial resources.\r\nThe principal message of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General is that it is time that words gave way\r\nto action. We know what we want. We know what we\r\nhave to do to achieve it, and we know how to do it.\r\nThus, all that remains to do now is act. We must act\r\nimmediately and make what we have been promising in\r\nrecent years become a reality. To do that, we do not\r\nneed new summits, new declarations or new\r\nresolutions, and we do not need to create new rules or\r\nreform existing institutions.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration and the Monterrey\r\nConsensus, like two sides of the same coin, clearly\r\nestablish the responsibilities of both the developed and\r\nthe developing countries. The developed countries\r\nhave the responsibility for achieving the first seven of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, while the\r\ndeveloping countries must achieve the goal of creating\r\na world partnership for development, based on genuine\r\nsolidarity, leading to a genuine readiness to put in place\r\nmechanisms for fulfilling the commitments made in the\r\nthree key components of trade, official development\r\nassistance and foreign debt.\r\nWith respect to international trade and\r\ndevelopment, we view as positive the agreement\r\nreached in Geneva on 1 August to relaunch the Doha\r\nround of negotiations and strengthen the multilateral\r\ntrade system and the World Trade Organization.\r\nWhile official development assistance has grown\r\nsince the Millennium Summit and while a group of\r\ncountries — Belgium, France, Ireland, Spain and the\r\nUnited Kingdom — have announced that they will\r\nincrease their contributions, we are still far from\r\nachieving the $100 billion that experts have estimated\r\nas necessary for fulfilling the Millennium Development\r\nGoals on schedule. Efforts on external debt, debt relief\r\nand the use of the resources that have been freed up to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals have\r\nstarted to yield results. We should therefore continue in\r\nthat direction and broaden the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt Initiative.\r\nWe attach great importance to next year’s high-\r\nlevel meeting of the General Assembly to follow up the\r\ncommitments made in the Monterrey Consensus and\r\nthe Economic and Social Council meeting with the\r\nBretton Woods institutions, the World Trade\r\nOrganization and the United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Development. We hope that the outcome\r\nwill make a useful contribution to the high-level\r\nmeeting to review progress on achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nIn the three paragraphs the report devotes to\r\nterrorism, the Secretary-General inform us of the\r\nstrengthening of the Counter-Terrorism Committee and\r\nof the assistance activities of the Terrorism Prevention\r\nBranch of the United Nations Office on Drugs and\r\nCrime. We would have liked to receive updated\r\ninformation on the coordination of the counter-\r\nterrorism activities performed by the many components\r\nof the United Nations system active in that area.\r\nWe reaffirm our belief that the international\r\ncommunity still lacks a concrete counter-terrorism\r\nstrategy that is broad, coordinated and effective in\r\norder to fight international terrorism. That is\r\nundoubtedly a serious gap in the system of overall\r\ninternational cooperation, not only because that gap\r\nlimits our potential to fight terrorism effectively but\r\nalso because, in the absence of an internationally\r\nagreed strategy, the individual responses of States to\r\ndefend themselves from that scourge could be\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nmisaimed and could have an effect contrary to what\r\nwas intended.\r\nI believe we must devote ourselves without delay\r\nto formulating a counter-terrorism strategy at the\r\ninternational, regional and bilateral levels, aimed not\r\nonly at preventing, eliminating and punishing all\r\nterrorist activities but also at identifying the causes that\r\ngive rise to terrorism. Such a strategy should include,\r\namong other things, the operational coordination of\r\nnational security, information, police and immigration\r\nservices and the establishment of common procedures\r\nfor extradition.\r\nWith respect to chapter VI of the report, on\r\nmanagement, I shall briefly comment on the\r\nstrengthening of the Organization. Paragraph 256 notes\r\nthat further efforts to consolidate the network of\r\ninformation centres in the regions will proceed in the\r\ncoming year. We recall that the General Assembly has\r\ngiven no mandate in that regard and that originally the\r\nidea was to save money in the developed countries by\r\nusing advanced communication technologies and to\r\napply those savings to enhancing the programmes of\r\nthe information centres in developing countries. It is\r\nour understanding that the will of the General\r\nAssembly must be heeded and that the Secretariat\r\nshould submit a constructive, comprehensive proposal\r\nfor enhancing the functioning of the information\r\ncentres in all developing countries.\r\nMr. Moleko (Lesotho): I extend to you, Sir, our\r\ncongratulations on your assumption of the presidency\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. My\r\ndelegation pledges its support to you to ensure that you\r\nsucceed in your important work. In the same breath, let\r\nme thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive\r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/59/1).\r\nThe world has degenerated into a more dangerous\r\nplace for us, its inhabitants. The violence that we have\r\nwitnessed, directed at the most vulnerable members of\r\nour society  — women and children — is of great\r\nconcern to my delegation. We have seen acts of\r\nterrorism directed at children in the name of a national\r\ncause in Beslan, the Russian Federation. We have seen\r\nimages of hapless women and children in Darfur,\r\nPalestine and other places where they are driven to\r\ndestitution. These and other acts of violence undermine\r\nthe efforts of our Organization in the promotion of\r\npeace and security. The United Nations should be\r\ncommended for its efforts in conflict prevention,\r\npeacemaking, peace-building and peacekeeping. The\r\nefforts of our Organization in denying terrorists access\r\nto weapons of mass destruction are commendable.\r\nWe need to work together, as the international\r\ncommunity, to halt the proliferation of small arms and\r\nlight weapons, because they are instruments that\r\ndestabilize most countries. We have all seen the\r\nunfortunate results of unilateralism. The fruits of\r\nmultilateralism, on the other hand, can be seen in\r\nAfghanistan, where elections will be held soon.\r\nThere is a need to consolidate peace in Burundi,\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nLiberia and Sierra Leone. That is a goal that we can\r\nachieve if we focus on it. We are confident that the\r\ncontinued leadership of the Secretary-General will lead\r\nto peace and political stability in those sister countries.\r\nWe are seeing an increase in violence directed at\r\nwomen through rape. Such gender-based violence is a\r\nterrible scar on our world. We welcome the guidelines\r\nfrom the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees entitled Sexual and\r\nGender-Based Violence against Refugees, Returnees\r\nand Internally Displaced Persons: Guidelines for\r\nPrevention and Response.\r\nWe also welcome the emerging cooperation in the\r\nUnited Nations family to support children separated\r\nfrom their families by war and conflict. The inter-\r\nagency guiding principles on unaccompanied and\r\nseparated children, issued in February 2004; are very\r\nwelcome. It is our hope that they will help lead to a\r\nhalt in the recruitment of child solders and the better\r\nprotection of the most vulnerable members of our\r\nsociety, children.\r\nI cannot conclude my remarks without making\r\nreference to the threat posed by HIV/AIDS to the very\r\nsurvival of many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We\r\nwelcome the efforts by the international community in\r\nfighting that pandemic. The leadership of the\r\nSecretary-General, through his Special Envoy for\r\nHIV/AIDS in Africa, Stephen Lewis, is beginning to\r\nbear fruit. However, we should observe that the\r\nenormity of the problem requires more resources that\r\nare currently available. Sub-Saharan Africa cannot\r\nachieve any of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nwithout arresting the spread of that pandemic.\r\nFinally, my delegation would like to thank your\r\npredecessor, Sir, Mr. Julian Hunte, President of the\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session, for his\r\nefforts in the revitalization of the Assembly. The goal\r\nof reforming the Security Council, however, remains\r\nelusive. Yet such reform is a sine qua non for ensuring\r\nits capacity in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. The composition of that body must reflect\r\nthe complexion of the membership of the Organization.\r\nThe working methods of the Council need to be\r\nmodified. The Security Council must be representative,\r\nas well as democratic, if it is to effectively discharge\r\nits duties.\r\nMr. Sen (India): We welcome this opportunity to\r\nparticipate in the debate, under agenda item 10, on the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/59/1). We thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor the report and for the statement he made at the\r\ncommencement of the general debate introducing the\r\nreport. The theme of the statement, the rule of law at\r\nboth the national and the international levels, was very\r\nwelcome and timely. In the context of a longer\r\nhistorical time-span, we may ask whether the United\r\nNations has performed better than during the cold war.\r\nIn matters of peace and security, the results are\r\nequally — if not more — problematic. In economic\r\nmatters, there has been clearly a marked decline from a\r\nperiod when ideas such as the General Scheme of\r\nPreferences, the Integrated Programme for\r\nCommodities, the Special Drawing Rights,\r\nsupplementary financing and debt forgiveness were\r\nfirst advanced and agreed upon in the United Nations\r\nand then followed up by specialized agencies. Those\r\nstrengthened peace and security in spite of the cold\r\nwar. However, it would be unfair to put all the blame\r\non the United Nations — for the United Nations is only\r\nas strong as its Members.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s description of the year\r\nunder review as extraordinarily challenging is very apt.\r\nThe period — beginning with the commencement of\r\nmilitary action in Iraq and, in its aftermath, the surge in\r\npeacekeeping operations and the threat of international\r\nterrorism and its linkages with weapons of mass\r\ndestruction — has been both challenging and taxing for\r\nthe United Nations system. At the same time, the\r\nincreased responsibilities in dealing with transnational\r\nissues relating to international crime, poverty, hunger,\r\nmalnutrition, infectious diseases and epidemics,\r\nenvironmental degradation, human rights violations\r\nand humanitarian emergencies, have called upon\r\nresources and reserves that the international\r\ncommunity has striven hard to find.\r\nThe new and onerous demands being made on the\r\nUnited Nations system are but manifestations of the\r\npost-cold-war twenty-first century, where intra-State\r\nconflicts outnumber inter-State conflicts, where failed\r\nStates place a heavy burden on their neighbours and on\r\nthe international community and where interpretations\r\nof the rule of law are consistently stretched. In the\r\ncircumstances, we agree with the Secretary-General\r\nthat the recommendations of the High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change should be bold and\r\npracticable.\r\nThe year 2005 will be crucial in addressing the\r\nnew challenges with which the United Nations is\r\nconfronted. The coinciding of the recommendations of\r\nthe High-level Panel, the Millennium+5 event and the\r\nsixtieth year of the establishment of the Organization\r\nshould provide sufficient impetus for the international\r\ncommunity, in particular the Member States, to endow\r\nthe United Nations with the strength, resources and\r\ndirection required to enable it to boldly and effectively\r\nface the future.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General’s view that\r\nUnited Nations reform will not be complete without\r\nSecurity Council reform, bringing it into line with\r\ntoday’s realities. We hope that the High-level Panel\r\nwill take note of and comprehensively address the\r\nissue of Security Council restructuring. There is a\r\nwidespread view, particularly within the developing\r\nworld, that the imbalance in the current composition of\r\nthe Security Council is making the Council’s decisions\r\nmore difficult for many countries to accept and\r\nimplement. Therefore, the bold and practicable ideas\r\nthat could emerge from the High-level Panel to address\r\nthe many ways and means of increasing the relevance\r\nand effectiveness of the United Nations in diverse\r\nareas such as counter-terrorism, the non-proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction, humanitarian crises\r\nand the like, would in large measure hinge on the\r\nability of the Panel to comprehensively and\r\nsatisfactorily address the imbalance in the Council’s\r\ncomposition.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General has recalled\r\nthat the Charter requires the United Nations to promote\r\nconditions for economic and social progress and\r\ndevelopment, as well as solutions to international\r\neconomic, health and related problems. He has drawn\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nattention to the increasing gap between demand and\r\nraised resources required to address natural disasters,\r\nrefugee situations and other humanitarian emergencies;\r\nthe fight against HIV/AIDS; and the critical situation\r\nin Africa, among other responsibilities devolving on\r\nthe international community.\r\nWhile the executive and enforcement roles of the\r\nUnited Nations in areas such as peace and security and,\r\nto some extent, in disarmament and the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, are paramount, many\r\ndeveloping countries — for obvious reasons — view\r\nUnited Nations engagement in the social and economic\r\nsectors as seminal. The United Nations is regarded by\r\ndeveloping nations as the global conscience-keeper,\r\nand as such it must preserve that role and guide the\r\nwork of specialized agencies in those areas.\r\nThe report also draws attention to the role played\r\nby the United Nations in conflict prevention and peace-\r\nmaking in various parts of the world, ranging from Iraq\r\nand the rest of the Middle East to Cyprus, the Sudan\r\nand Asia. The case made by the Secretary-General for\r\nthe prevention of conflicts through early warning and\r\nquiet diplomacy would undoubtedly make unnecessary\r\nmajor politico-military efforts to resolve them later. At\r\nthe same time, the limitations of imposing preventive\r\nand peace-making services on Member States that do\r\nnot want them must be borne in mind.\r\nThe United Nations has had a tradition of directly\r\naddressing operational prevention through preventive\r\ndiplomacy, but it should also consider the enhanced\r\nimplementation of a structural prevention strategy to\r\naddress the political, social, cultural, economic,\r\nenvironmental and other structural causes that often\r\nunderlie the immediate symptoms of armed conflicts.\r\nThe United Nations system as a whole could begin to\r\nconsider the mandates of its agencies, funds and\r\nprogrammes through a prevention lens. It could also\r\nconsider strengthening its capacity to help coordinate\r\ninternational efforts by all actors — including Member\r\nStates, international financial institutions, regional\r\norganizations, non-governmental organizations and the\r\nprivate sector — to carry out structural prevention\r\nstrategies.\r\nThe surge in peacekeeping brings new challenges,\r\nthe principal one being that of sustained commitment\r\nin terms of both troops and specialized military and\r\ncivilian support services from countries that have men\r\nand financial resources. Regrettably, there continues to\r\nbe a lag, with almost 80 per cent of the troops deployed\r\nin United Nations peacekeeping operations being\r\ncontributed by developing countries. The issues of\r\neffective planning, congruity among mandates,\r\nresources allocated and objectives to be achieved,\r\nalong with the safety and security of peacekeepers, are\r\nother areas of particular concern. Those questions\r\nshould be the subject of constant dialogue and\r\ninteraction among the troop-contributing countries, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Secretariat if peacekeeping is\r\nto be effective.\r\nThe surge in peacekeeping has been accompanied\r\nby a tendency to lean on regional solutions. Reliance\r\non regional solutions cannot and should not absolve the\r\nUnited Nations of its responsibility and its commitment\r\nto be the primary guarantor of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. While coalitions of\r\nthe willing may have been authorized by the Security\r\nCouncil for enforcement action, in many other\r\ncircumstances of complex peacekeeping operations, the\r\nbroadest range of capabilities available to the\r\ninternational community can be brought to bear only\r\nthrough the United Nations. The challenge is how best\r\nto involve regional organizations without regionalizing\r\npeacekeeping.\r\nIndia remains steadfast in its commitment to the\r\nideal of promoting world peace and security; our\r\ncontribution to United Nations peacekeeping is part of\r\nthat broader strategy. We have been one of the most\r\nconsistent contributors of troops to the United Nations\r\nand shall continue to uphold that tradition. We shall\r\ncontinue to work with the Secretariat and with Member\r\nStates in order to make peacekeeping the effective\r\ninstrument that we all wish it to be.\r\nEven as countries formerly beset by conflict\r\nemerge to find peace and development, new areas of\r\nthe world are faced with humanitarian emergencies of\r\nvarying proportions. The efforts of the international\r\ncommunity need to provide humanitarian solace to\r\nthose areas that have recently descended into crisis\r\nsituations, while not forgetting those that no longer\r\nhave the benefit of the so-called “CNN effect”.\r\nWe are therefore concerned that humanitarian\r\nassistance continues to be unevenly allocated and that\r\nits levels remain insufficient. We are concerned that\r\ncontributions made by July 2004 fulfilled only 32 per\r\ncent of the requirements halfway through the\r\nConsolidated Appeal period. The section of the report\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nunder the heading “Funding humanitarian\r\nemergencies” provides details of the shortfalls faced by\r\nmore than one agency. Even security needs are fully\r\nfunded only in the case of Iraq, while many less\r\nprominent emergencies have experienced a lack of\r\nsecurity personnel, resources and assets. We endorse\r\nthe Secretary-General’s call to the donor community to\r\nensure that funding for humanitarian operations is\r\nincreased and that it is provided more consistently\r\nacross humanitarian emergencies to cover the needs of\r\nall sectors. We trust, however, that that will not be\r\naccomplished at the cost of official such assistance and\r\noutlays for such assistance.\r\nIt is heartening to note that the refugee population\r\nhas decreased significantly, falling 20 per cent overall\r\nfrom 2002 to the present. We have noted that in\r\nAfghanistan, while more 3.5 million refugees and\r\ninternally displaced persons have returned to their\r\nhomes since the end of 2001, an estimated 180,000\r\ninternally displaced persons and 2 million refugees\r\nremain in the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan.\r\nGreater political stability and protection and freedom\r\nfrom the continuing acts of terrorism perpetrated by the\r\nresurgent remnants of the Taliban would, we believe,\r\ncreate a more congenial atmosphere for the return of\r\nAfghan refugees.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that the\r\nimpartiality and neutrality of the humanitarian\r\nresponse must be maintained in all integrated missions.\r\nThe humanitarian function should retain its sanctity\r\nand respect by remaining apolitical, neutral and\r\nimpartial. However, we strongly believe that while\r\ncertain situations may demand an integrated mission,\r\nthat should be the exception rather than the norm. The\r\nassociation of military personnel with a humanitarian\r\nmission would negatively affect the public perception\r\nof humanitarian personnel. In a world becoming\r\nincreasingly suspicious, even of the activities of the\r\nhumanitarian arm of the United Nations  — a situation\r\nthat poses serious security risks and concerns — it is\r\nimperative to maintain the separate character of the\r\nhumanitarian function to the maximum extent possible.\r\nThe basic principles for providing humanitarian\r\nassistance were well established in resolution 46/182.\r\nWherever the humanitarian function is performed as\r\npart of an integrated mission, those guiding principles\r\nmust be respected.\r\nWe recently witnessed the potential of natural\r\ndisasters to cause widespread havoc and destruction in\r\nseveral Caribbean countries. The economic losses\r\ncaused by natural disasters are even more difficult to\r\nbear when the victims are the poor of the developing\r\nworld. Natural disasters pose a great challenge to the\r\nefforts of developing countries to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. The developing\r\ncountries — especially the disaster-prone ones among\r\nthem — would benefit from assistance in the area of\r\ncapacity-building in early-warning systems.\r\nIndia is steadfastly committed to achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, and we are steadily\r\nworking towards that objective. Like other delegations,\r\nhowever, we remain concerned that the pace of\r\nachieving the Goals remains uneven and that, at the\r\ncurrent pace, many parts of the world would be unable\r\nto reach the targets by 2015. We support the need for\r\nthe fulfilment of Goal 8 by the development partner\r\ncountries. But official development assistance alone\r\nmay not be enough, as capacity-building policies and\r\nstrategies will also be needed in many countries,\r\nparticularly in Africa.\r\nThe Secretary-General rightly observed in\r\nparagraph 139 of his report that “increased and more\r\nequitable world trade holds forth the prospect of\r\nhelping nations to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals”. We share the view that the\r\nsuccessful outcome of the Doha Programme of Action\r\nwill depend largely on the manner in which the\r\ninterests and concerns of developing countries are\r\ntaken into account, as well as on their own negotiating\r\nskills and struggles in the post-framework-agreement\r\nperiod.\r\nThe Secretary-General pointed out in his report\r\nthat a road map for the implementation of the Almaty\r\nProgramme of Action on transit transport cooperation\r\namong land-locked developing countries, transit\r\ndeveloping countries and development partners,\r\nincluding donor countries and international financial\r\ninstitutions, has been prepared and validated through a\r\nmeeting of United Nations entities and agencies,\r\nincluding the World Bank Group. We welcome that\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General observed that\r\nwater and its linkages to health, poverty reduction,\r\ngender equality, education, environmental protection\r\nand peace are crucial to sustainable development. India\r\nrecognizes the crucial importance of initiatives in the\r\narea of water and sanitation in improving the quality of\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nthe life of the poor, and we have given considerable\r\nattention to water and sanitation programmes in our\r\ndevelopment plans. We share the view that the question\r\nof safe drinking water needs greater prominence both\r\nglobally and locally. The major constraints faced by\r\ndeveloping countries in implementing the agreed Goals\r\nare the non-availability of financial resources and of\r\nnecessary technologies. These need to be addressed\r\nwith a sense of urgency.\r\nWe share the view that science and technology\r\nare critical elements in our efforts to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals and that there is a\r\nneed to address questions of connectivity and access to\r\ninformation and communication technologies and\r\nbiotechnology, as well as technology transfer and\r\ncapacity-building.\r\nThe Government of India has decided to adhere\r\nto the two Optional Protocols to the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child — namely, those\r\non the involvement of children in armed conflict and\r\non the sale of children, child prostitution and child\r\npornography.\r\nWith regard to the establishment of the rule of\r\nlaw in post-conflict situations, we concur with the view\r\nthat a “one-size-fits-all” approach should be avoided.\r\nThe legal and cultural traditions of the local\r\ncommunity have to play a key role in devising an\r\napproach for the re-establishment of the rule of law.\r\nThe involvement of local actors and legal\r\nprofessionals, therefore, could provide a more lasting\r\nsolution than one based on transplanted outside\r\nexpertise, which may be unsuitable for local\r\nconditions. In terms of the United Nations Charter, the\r\nGeneral Assembly should debate this, along with many\r\nother themes.\r\nThe provision of safety and security to United\r\nNations personnel both in Headquarters and in the field\r\nhas become an urgent task. While we note that some\r\ninterim measures have been taken in this area, ad hoc\r\napproaches bring about an unwarranted sense of\r\ncomplacency and, in the long term, are bound to be\r\ncounter-productive. We await the report of the\r\nSecretary-General called for under resolution 58/295\r\nand hope that it will take a comprehensive and long-\r\nterm view of this subject and propose a coherent plan\r\nof action involving all entities concerned.\r\nWe are disappointed to note that there has not\r\nbeen much progress on the Capital Master Plan over\r\nthe last year. The principal stumbling block continues\r\nto be in the area of financing for that project. We need\r\nto address this issue with some urgency in this session.\r\nReform of the planning, programming and\r\nbudgeting cycle, mandated by the General Assembly\r\nduring its last session, has resulted in the preparation\r\nof a new strategic framework for the Organization to\r\nreplace the medium-term plan. We do hope that with a\r\nshorter time horizon of two years, and with the plan\r\nnow being coterminous with the budget, it will lead to\r\nbetter planning and delivery of mandated activities and\r\nto greater accountability of programme managers.\r\nIt is unfortunate that regular budget contributions\r\nduring the last year fell behind previous years. Some\r\npeacekeeping missions are perennially short of funds.\r\nAt the same time, the United Nations faces an\r\nunprecedented surge in new peacekeeping demands.\r\nThis makes it critical for Member States to make full\r\nand timely payment of assessed contributions.\r\nProfessed commitment to the United Nations by\r\nMember States needs to be backed up by living up to\r\nthe obligations.\r\nWe shall provide more detailed comments on the\r\nvarious issues before this session under the respective\r\nagenda items.\r\nMr. Sharma (Nepal): Mr. President, at the outset\r\nlet me congratulate you on your well-deserved election\r\nto preside over the United Nations General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-ninth session. I admire your leadership, as\r\nwell as your long and illustrious experience in\r\ndiplomacy. I assure you of my delegation’s full\r\ncooperation in your efforts to make this session a\r\nsuccess.\r\nI would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations for his comprehensive\r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/59/1).\r\nThe United Nations was created to bring\r\ncountries together to work collectively in order to\r\npromote international peace and security, to foster\r\ncooperation for development, to protect vulnerable\r\npeople, and to advance human rights and the rule of\r\nlaw. The present deliberation affords us the opportunity\r\nto assess the performance of the United Nations over\r\nthe last 12 months and help the Organization chart a\r\nmore robust and defined course in the future.\r\nClearly, the United Nations has shown a mixed\r\nrecord of achievements during the review period. Some\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nproblems have yielded to resolution and others are\r\nmoving in the right direction. Meanwhile, many old\r\nchallenges have persisted and new ones have emerged.\r\nFor instance, in the area of peace and security,\r\nGuatemala and Sierra Leone are limping back to\r\nnormalcy. Afghanistan, though still dangerous, is\r\nmoving toward democratic elections. Although the\r\nhandover of power to the Iraqi people on 30 June 2004\r\nis welcome, Iraq continues to be a major concern to the\r\ninternational community. The Israeli-Palestinian\r\nconflict is taking innocent lives on both sides and\r\ndestabilizing the whole region. Those two situations\r\ntogether could cause the entire Middle East to explode\r\nand unleash political instability and economic\r\nhardships on the whole world.\r\nThe United Nations has had to mount\r\npeacekeeping operations in Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nBurundi and Haiti to restore calm and normalcy in\r\nthose countries during the review period. Sudan\r\nappears to be the next candidate for the deployment of\r\nsuch operations. The Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, despite the deployment of a United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operation, is still highly volatile. Nepal\r\nhas contributed its troops to those operations and looks\r\nforward to increased cooperation with the Security\r\nCouncil and the Secretariat in the endeavour of\r\npromoting international peace and security.\r\nTerrorism has become a major threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. Al Qaeda and its cells,\r\nas well as domestic terror groups, continue to launch\r\nvicious attacks on innocent civilians in many countries\r\naround the world. The global community has yet to\r\ncome up with an adequate legal and operational\r\nresponse to stamp out this menace. Nepal itself is in\r\nthe clutches of conflict and brutality unleashed by the\r\nso-called Maoists. His Majesty’s Government is\r\ncommitted to finding a political settlement to the\r\nproblem and to protecting the people’s lives and\r\nproperty until such a settlement is found. We\r\nappreciate the Secretary-General’s offer of good offices\r\nto help us find an amicable resolution to the Maoist\r\nproblem. However, at the moment we are trying to find\r\na solution on our own.\r\nDurable peace will be a mirage without\r\ncommitted efforts at disarmament. Unfortunately,\r\nnuclear disarmament has hit a brick wall, fuelling\r\nnuclear weapons proliferation around the world.\r\nControls on small arms and light weapons remain\r\nwoefully inadequate to prevent non-State actors from\r\nacquiring and misusing such weapons.\r\nIn view of those various challenges, Nepal\r\nwelcomes the appointment of the High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change. We hope the Panel\r\nwill be able to come up with pragmatic and realistic\r\nrecommendations that will help the United Nations and\r\nthe world community at large to deal effectively with\r\nthe existing and gathering threats to peace and security.\r\nFor the majority of the world’s people, poverty,\r\nhunger, illiteracy and disease remain the most urgent\r\nand primary concerns. Those conditions have become a\r\nmajor source of tension and conflict. Thanks to\r\nspectacular progress in poverty reduction in countries\r\nlike China and India, the number of people living in\r\nabsolute poverty has somewhat receded. However, that\r\nis small solace to the majority of countries that have\r\nstagnated or declined in their economic growth and\r\ndevelopment performance. Hunger is taking the lives\r\nof women and children. HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and\r\nmalaria are decimating countries and generations.\r\nGlobalization has brought few fruits to developing\r\ncountries, and sustainable development has yet to take\r\noff.\r\nMeeting the Millennium Development Goals will\r\nremain a mirage for many developing countries unless\r\nthe international community does more to help.\r\nAlthough official development assistance has shown an\r\nupward trend, it remains far short of the additional $50\r\nbillion needed annually to meet the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. The Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries (HIPC) Debt Initiative has been frustratingly\r\nslow in providing relief in order to the candidate\r\ncountries, and it is woefully limited in its coverage,\r\nsince it does not include all least developed countries\r\n(LDCs) that need debt relief in order to stimulate their\r\neconomies. Some development partners have relaxed\r\naccess for products from the least developed countries\r\nto their markets, but others have yet to do so. Market\r\naccess remains a major concern for developing\r\ncountries and the Doha round is halting and slow in\r\nmaking progress to provide a level playing field to\r\nthose countries. In addition, foreign direct investment\r\nhas bypassed the majority of developing countries and\r\nmost least developed nations.\r\nIt is encouraging that the number of refugees has\r\ndeclined over the last few years; but there has been an\r\nincrease in the number of internally displaced persons.\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nMany refugee situations have persisted and remain as\r\nintractable as ever. Among them is the plight of more\r\nthan 100,000 Bhutanese refugees who have been living\r\nfor over a decade in camps in eastern Nepal. Despite\r\nthe best efforts of Nepal to resolve the problem through\r\ndialogue, the refugees have not been able to return\r\nhome, owing to Bhutan’s procrastination strategy.\r\nNatural disasters have affected many countries,\r\nseveral of them in the Caribbean region which was\r\ndevastated by the recent hurricanes. Those countries\r\nneed greater support from the international community\r\nto help them recover and to expedite their\r\nreconstruction efforts. Concerted endeavours are also\r\nnecessary to take mitigating measures to prevent future\r\ndisasters or to lessen their impact.\r\nThere have been unprecedented advances in the\r\npursuit of democracy and human rights around the\r\nworld. A rich body of international law has evolved\r\nover time, as well. But observing the provisions of\r\ninternational law, human rights treaties and democratic\r\ngovernance continues to remain a serious challenge.\r\nNepal, as a staunch supporter of multilateralism\r\nand as a nation wedded to multiparty democracy and\r\nconstitutional monarchy, is committed to practicing\r\ndemocracy and respecting human rights and the rule of\r\nlaw at home. We also believe the same standards and\r\nvalues should be applied to global governance.\r\nIt is evident that the United Nations has been\r\nworking in all those areas of common interest to\r\nhumanity. It is a major player in keeping peace and\r\npromoting security in the world. Although its resources\r\nfor development are fairly limited, the United Nations\r\nhas been playing a catalytic role in that vital realm as\r\nwell. This Organization is at the forefront of providing\r\nhumanitarian assistance and advancing human rights\r\nand the rule of law.\r\nIn Nepal, we indeed appreciate these critical roles\r\nthe United Nations has been playing to create a better\r\nworld for all, but the United Nations also has numerous\r\nlimitations of its own that must be overcome by\r\nstrengthening its legislative processes and executive\r\nstructures to promote fairness and equity among\r\nMember States, greater accountability among\r\nprogramme managers and increased security for its\r\nstaff.\r\nFor this, the United Nations needs urgent\r\nrevitalization so that it can grapple with conflicts and\r\ndevelopment challenges around the globe. Its sister\r\nagencies, such as the Bretton Woods institutions and\r\nthe World Trade Organization, also require drastic\r\nreforms in order to give voice to the weak and small\r\nwithin the community of nations. In all those reforms,\r\nwe see a vital role for the United Nations itself.\r\nNepal believes that, working together, we can\r\ncreate a more efficient, effective and equitable United\r\nNations and a better world order, in which all countries\r\ncan enjoy the benefits of peace, development, human\r\nrights and the rule of law.\r\nMr. de Rivero (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): In\r\ncommenting on the work of the Organization and the\r\nreport presented to us by the Secretary-General\r\n(A/59/1), I would like to begin by expressing the\r\nsatisfaction of Peru for having been host to the\r\nSecretary-General and Mrs. Annan last November. The\r\nfond memories that that visit evoked in Peru are still\r\nalive today.\r\nIn the twenty-first century, the world is becoming\r\na paradoxical reality. On the one hand, it is becoming\r\nintegrated through productive processes, trade and\r\nfinancial trends and because of the great progress in\r\nthe areas of digital communications and the Internet.\r\nYet, on the other hand, it is being fragmented because\r\nof civil wars, ethnic and religious conflicts, terrorism,\r\nsocial inequality and environmental degradation.\r\nAs stated in the report of the Secretary-General,\r\nthese contradictory tendencies of globalization and\r\nfragmentation call into question national and\r\ninternational governability. Today as never before, we\r\nare seeing how many poor nation-States are becoming\r\nungovernable, collapsing into chaos and civil war. We\r\nare seeing how new non-State actors, such as terrorist\r\norganizations and drug and arms traffickers, are\r\nemerging and achieving global power.\r\nIn the sort of fragmented world that we are\r\nseeing, no nation, as powerful as it may be, will be able\r\nto unilaterally establish a new order. Therefore, at the\r\nbeginning of a new century, we are looking at a natural\r\nvacuum in world power. If we do not quickly fill that\r\nvacuum with a multilateral form of governability, then\r\nthat could lead us to international anarchy.\r\nIn light of that situation, with all of its\r\nimplications, the United Nations today is an\r\nindispensable organization whether we like it or not,\r\none without which we will never be able to bring about\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\na new world order aimed at preventing and pacifying\r\ncivil, ethnic and religious conflicts; fighting terrorism\r\nand global crime; punishing crimes against humanity,\r\nincluding ethnic cleansing and genocide; eradicating\r\npoverty and hunger; and protecting the environment.\r\nOne of the symptoms of international anarchy\r\nthat has begun to emerge is the proliferation, after the\r\ncold war, of more than 30 civil conflicts that have\r\ncaused 5 million deaths and almost 17 million\r\nrefugees. Those conflicts, caused by political, ethnic or\r\nreligious hatred, are converting many countries into\r\nveritable factories for crimes against humanity. In light\r\nof that serious situation, the United Nations cannot\r\nabdicate its responsibility to protect populations that\r\nare not being protected by their own Governments.\r\nThat is why true reform of the United Nations must\r\nnow be aimed, above all, at strengthening the\r\nlegitimate use of force by the Organization in order to\r\nprevent massive human rights violations, ethnic\r\ncleansing and genocide. Reform of the Security\r\nCouncil must therefore be sufficiently broad to give its\r\ndecisions greater democratic legitimacy. But it must\r\nalso be realistic in order to ensure the effective\r\nfunctioning of the Council.\r\nNeither the strengthening of the multilateral\r\nsystem for the legitimate use of force nor improvement\r\nin the effectiveness of peacekeeping and nation-\r\nbuilding operations will be sufficient to prevent or put\r\nan end to civil conflicts or to the collapse of nation-\r\nStates into ungovernable entities. Neither will\r\nmultilateral cooperation initiatives against terrorism\r\nand international crime be sufficient if we do not\r\nestablish a new type of multilateral socio-economic\r\ngovernance that will begin to reduce hunger, poverty\r\nand inequality among and within nations.\r\nAccording to the Human Development Report\r\nand the World Development Report, between 1975 and\r\n2001 — a quarter of a century — personal income\r\nfailed to increase more than 3 per cent in more than\r\n100 of the so-called developing countries, preventing\r\nbillions of people from emerging from poverty. Today,\r\n2.8 billion people live on $2 a day and 1.3 billion\r\nsubsist on $1 a day. Moreover, during the 1990s, social\r\ninequality grew more pronounced throughout the\r\nworld. According to the Worldwatch Institute, that\r\nincrease in inequality affected not only personal\r\nincome but also access to water, food and energy:\r\npublic wealth essential for civilized life and socio-\r\npolitical stability. Today, the decline in personal\r\nincome and the increase in social inequality are\r\ncolliding like two tectonic plates, producing tremors of\r\nsocial disintegration and international anarchy.\r\nIt is necessary to reduce poverty, but reducing\r\npoverty does not constitute development. We must try\r\nto control the damage caused precisely by a lack of\r\ndevelopment. However, even the modest Millennium\r\nGoal of reducing poverty — which is not\r\ndevelopment — will be far from attained in 2015, as\r\nindicated in this year’s recent Human Development\r\nReport. In fact, at the current pace, we would need\r\nnearly 200 years to reduce abject poverty by half in\r\nsome countries, including many countries in Latin\r\nAmerica, the Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa and the\r\nAndean region.\r\nIn addition to new financial mechanisms and\r\nmore resources, poverty reduction requires a fairer\r\ninternational trade system in which subsidies for the\r\nproduction and export of agricultural products are\r\neliminated, the food security of poor countries is\r\nstrengthened and, above all, developing countries\r\nreceive real and effective differentiated treatment in\r\nnegotiations of the World Trade Organization (WTO).\r\nIn short, the Bretton Woods institutions and the WTO\r\nmust address the social deficit caused by globalization\r\nand thus prevent further increases in international\r\ninstability and violence.\r\nThe time has come to address these questions\r\nwith the utmost seriousness. We hope that, when we\r\nmeet next year to review the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, we will be able to arrive at a\r\nclear agreement on the means for attaining the main\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Although the Goals\r\nare modest, at least they will partially free us from\r\npoverty.\r\nWe must accept the fact that social exclusion is\r\nthe primary cause of the violence, the instability, the\r\nfragility of democracy and the national and\r\ninternational fragmentation that are spreading\r\nthroughout the world today. All the reports of the\r\nworld’s highly regarded strategic institutions agree that\r\nsocial exclusion creates violence and civil war. That\r\ncause cannot be eliminated unless we ensure that\r\nglobalization becomes a positive force that provides\r\ntangible benefits to all nations and all human beings.\r\nIn order to make globalization inclusive, we need\r\nto reiterate that the current international system\r\ntranscends inter-State relations, also including non-\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\ngovernmental organizations and transnational\r\ncorporations. That is why we in the United Nations\r\nmust undertake greater efforts to include these new\r\nglobal actors in the implementation of our decisions;\r\notherwise, many resolutions adopted by the Assembly\r\nmay not actually be enforced because all the actors of\r\ntoday’s world do not participate in them.\r\nMr. Kuchinsky (Ukraine): I would like to join\r\nprevious speakers in thanking Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan for his highly informative report on the work of\r\nthe Organization (A/59/1). My delegation is satisfied\r\nwith the thematic overview of the work of the United\r\nNations in all key areas of its activities.\r\nIt is very hard to disagree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the United Nations has been through an\r\nextraordinarily challenging year. In too many areas, we\r\nhad to resolve a constant conflict between wishes and\r\nresources, between the desirable and the achievable.\r\nWe faced a long list of problems, but we did not always\r\nhave a clear vision of how to deal with them.\r\nHowever, what is clear now is that no country can\r\nface the current global threats and challenges alone or\r\nhide behind a mask of indifference or passivity. The\r\nnew reality demands a mobilization of efforts by the\r\nentire international community to counter those\r\nchallenges. We hope that the contributions of the High-\r\nLevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change will\r\nhelp us to develop a clearer vision of ways and means\r\nfor effective collective action by the United Nations.\r\nDespite the past differences over Iraq, this year\r\nthe United Nations and its Security Council showed\r\nunity in addressing the situation in that country.\r\nUkraine welcomes the transition of power to the Iraqis,\r\nthe formation of the interim representative and\r\nexecutive structures and the clear definition of the role\r\nof the United Nations. My country is prepared to assist\r\nthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General for\r\nIraq in carrying out his mission. It is now important to\r\nensure the effective implementation of the timetable\r\nfor a comprehensive political transition process in the\r\ncountry, especially through the holding of free\r\nelections, the drafting of a new constitution and the\r\nformation of the transitional government of Iraq.\r\nUkraine believes that the United Nations should\r\ncontinue to maintain a leading role in promoting global\r\ncooperation in the fight against terrorism. We believe\r\nthe creation of a new efficient system of information-\r\nexchange on terrorism would help prevent new attacks\r\nand save priceless human lives.\r\nWe are pleased to note that the Security Council’s\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) has become more\r\nproactive in its dialogue with Member States and has\r\nimproved technical assistance to countries. Ukraine\r\nwelcomes the Committee’s efforts to develop\r\nmechanisms for the exchange of information between\r\nvarious international, regional and sub-regional\r\norganizations. We also welcome the role played in this\r\narea by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime,\r\nand support further strengthening of this structure.\r\nThe Secretary-General stressed in his report that\r\nthe sharp surge in demand for peacekeeping during the\r\npast year has posed a serious challenge for the United\r\nNations and could impact the effectiveness of\r\noperations. The political commitment of Member\r\nStates and the contribution of financial and human\r\nresources are needed now more than ever, if we want\r\npeacekeeping to remain an effective instrument of the\r\nUnited Nations. As one of the major troop-contributing\r\ncountries to United Nations peacekeeping operations\r\nand the largest troop-contributing country in Europe,\r\nmy country is ready to remain a reliable partner of the\r\nUnited Nations in this area.\r\nHowever, we are deeply concerned about the\r\nincreasing danger to peacekeeping personnel. It is\r\ncritically important and urgent that we strengthen the\r\nprotection of people in the service of the United\r\nNations. In this regard, we welcome the Security\r\nCouncil’s adoption of resolution 1502 (2003) on the\r\nsecurity of United Nations personnel. As one of the\r\ninitiators urging the drafting of the 1994 Convention\r\non the Safety of United Nations and Associated\r\nPersonnel, Ukraine fully supports the activities of the\r\nad hoc committee aimed at strengthening the\r\nConvention’s legal regime. We stand for the universal\r\napplication of the Convention and call upon all\r\nMember States to strictly abide by its provisions.\r\nUkraine invites the international community to mark\r\nthe tenth anniversary of the adoption of Convention on\r\nthe Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel.\r\nWe will submit the relevant draft resolution for\r\nconsideration in the Fourth Committee of the General\r\nAssembly, and we hope that it will enjoy the support of\r\nMember States.\r\nWe are convinced that HIV/AIDS is one of the\r\nfundamental threats not only to human health and well-\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nbeing, but, in fact, to world security. We commend the\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General and the work carried\r\nout by the United Nations and its specialized agencies\r\nin combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic. My country\r\ninitiated the convening of the twenty-sixth special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS, and\r\nstrongly advocates the implementation of its\r\nrecommendations. We support the proposal to hold a\r\nhigh-level meeting to review progress in this area next\r\nJune.\r\nIn the area of the protection of human rights and\r\nthe rule of law, we welcome the appointment of the\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General’s Special Adviser on\r\nthe Prevention of Genocide. The international\r\ncommunity must thoroughly study this phenomenon in\r\norder to prevent it from happening again.\r\nLast year, the world marked the 70th anniversary\r\nof the horrible famine and genocide that took the lives\r\nof over seven million Ukrainians. I wish to express\r\nonce again our profound gratitude to all the States that\r\nsigned the joint statement on the seventieth anniversary\r\nof the Great Famine — Holodomor — of 1932 to 1933\r\nin Ukraine and whose parliaments adopted acts of\r\ncondemnation and expressed sympathy. We also\r\nexpress our appreciation to all organizations and\r\nindividuals who took part in the events honouring the\r\nvictims of the Great Famine.\r\nAlmost two decades have passed since Ukraine\r\nwas struck by the Chernobyl catastrophe, the worst\r\nnuclear accident in the history of mankind, which took\r\nthe lives of thousands of people and continues to have\r\na negative impact on the health and well-being of many\r\nUkrainians. Today, when assistance for recovery from\r\nChernobyl is no less needed than 18 years ago, the\r\ninternational community cannot afford to weaken its\r\nefforts with the job half done, but should take practical\r\nsteps for the sake of present and future generations. My\r\ncountry attaches special significance to the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the strengthening of international\r\ncooperation in mitigating and minimizing the\r\nconsequences of the Chernobyl disaster. The United\r\nNations strategy on Chernobyl, “The Human\r\nConsequences of the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident: A\r\nStrategy for Recovery,” which was launched in 2002,\r\nhas provided a constructive framework for\r\nreinvigorating international cooperation on Chernobyl.\r\nMy delegation believes that the recent transfer of\r\ncoordination functions for United Nations Chernobyl-\r\nrelated activities from the Office for the Coordination\r\nof Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) will stimulate\r\nfurther resource mobilization and enhance the impact\r\nof United Nations activities in this field.\r\nFinally, I would like to highlight the fact that\r\nUkraine, together with other interested delegations,\r\npresented an initiative to hold, in the framework of the\r\nsixtieth session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly, a special plenary meeting to commemorate\r\nthe victims of the Chernobyl disaster.\r\nMr. Mayoral (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): At\r\nthe outset, the Argentinian delegation would like to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his report on the work\r\nof the Organization (A/59/1), which serves as a basis\r\nfor our current deliberations.\r\nMy country would like to reiterate the fact that it\r\nvalues the work that the Organization has been doing\r\nwith regard to bringing about the rule of law and\r\njustice in a multilateral context. Within this framework,\r\nwe fully agree with the main themes of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s statement in the presentation of his report at\r\nthe start of the general debate of this fifty-ninth session\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nRespect for international law is a necessary and\r\nindispensable condition for the achievement of\r\nharmony between nations and between peoples.\r\nArgentina therefore supports the peacekeeping\r\noperations authorized by the Security Council, the\r\nincreasing number and complexity of which pose a\r\nserious challenge to the Organization’s planning and\r\ndeployment capabilities. Argentina remains committed\r\nto contributing troops and police personnel to the\r\nOrganization’s operations in that sphere. Only when we\r\nresolve the causes of violence, though, will we be able\r\nto attain full respect for international law.\r\nIn the area of international law, we would like to\r\nhighlight the work of the international tribunals, in\r\nparticular the International Criminal Court (ICC), the\r\ninternational community’s principal tool in its fight\r\nagainst impunity. We support the Court, in particular\r\nthe Office of the Prosecutor, in its task of investigating\r\nand bringing to trial those who have committed war\r\ncrimes, crimes against humanity and genocide when\r\nlocal authorities cannot or are not prepared to do so.\r\nAt the same time, my delegation would like to\r\nreaffirm its encouragement, support and readiness to\r\ncooperate with respect to the activities of the United\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nNations system regarding the protection and promotion\r\nof human rights, including initiatives both to\r\nstrengthen national human rights institutions and to\r\nimprove and strengthen international mechanisms for\r\nmonitoring universal respect for those rights.\r\nArmed conflict and the growing number of\r\nnatural disasters are causing the proliferation of\r\nhumanitarian emergencies. Here, we consider that the\r\ncoordinating role of the United Nations in providing\r\nassistance and humanitarian protection should be\r\nstrengthened. Member States should contribute to this\r\nwork of the Organization, consistent with their ability\r\nand circumstances. States should also guarantee full\r\nand unobstructed access for humanitarian personnel to\r\npopulations affected by humanitarian crises.\r\nThe delegation of Argentina would also like to\r\nhighlight the particular importance of the regional\r\ndimension of activities related to the rule of law, the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, the protection of\r\nhuman rights and humanitarian assistance. In\r\nparticular, we would like to highlight the work being\r\ndone in this area by the Organization of American\r\nStates (OAS), and we consider that there should be\r\ngreater, more consistent coordination with United\r\nNations activities.\r\nThe slow progress in disarmament, violations of\r\nnon-proliferation agreements, proof of the existence of\r\na clandestine nuclear network and the threat of the use\r\nof weapons of mass destruction in terrorist activities\r\nendanger peace and international security and could\r\nlead to new cases of force being used in a unilateral or\r\npreventive fashion, something that Argentina does not\r\nwant to see happen again. While we welcome the\r\ndecision of a number of countries to renounce their\r\nprogrammes of weapons of mass destruction, and while\r\nwe welcome support by States for the Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention, it is imperative that States\r\nparties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) address ongoing problems of\r\nnon-compliance, make the Treaty stricter, and advance\r\nits universality.\r\nWe also consider that we must redouble our\r\nefforts to ensure that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty (CTBT) comes into force as soon as\r\npossible. Effective implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 1540 (2004) would undoubtedly help\r\nsupplement the work under way to reinforce the\r\nexisting multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation\r\nsystems.\r\nWe feel that the United Nations should continue\r\nto provide assistance in implementing the Programme\r\nof Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit\r\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its\r\nAspects and in promoting the marking and tracing of\r\nsmall arms and the prevention, combating and\r\neradication of illicit brokering in such weapons.\r\nTherefore, we urge the ratification of the Protocol\r\nagainst the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in\r\nFirearms, Their Parts and Components and\r\nAmmunition, supplementing the United Nations\r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime.\r\nThe alarming levels of poverty throughout the\r\nworld not only affect the dignity and the survival of\r\nmillions of human beings but also hinder the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The\r\ninternational community’s actions to reduce the\r\nalarming levels of poverty, channelled principally\r\nthrough the eight Millennium Development Goals, will\r\nbe insufficient if developed countries do not fulfil the\r\ncommitments they undertook in the Monterrey\r\nConsensus and if they do not provide support for the\r\nactions being undertaken by developing countries. For\r\nArgentina, like many countries with medium income\r\nthat do not receive official development assistance, a\r\ntotal eradication of poverty can be brought about only\r\nthrough a fair and just international trading system that\r\nwill remove tariff and non-tariff barriers for all\r\ncommodities.\r\nIn conclusion, the delegation of Argentina would\r\nlike to reaffirm its support for the efforts of the\r\nOrganization and of the Secretary-General in favour of\r\na community of nations that recognizes the human\r\nbeing as the centre of its priorities and bases its action\r\non the rule of law, the promotion of representative\r\ndemocracy, the promotion and protection of human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms and, fundamentally,\r\nmultilateralism and interdependence as the only solid\r\nbasis on which to build lasting international peace.\r\nMr. Rastam (Malaysia): I wish to express the\r\nsincere appreciation of the delegation of Malaysia to\r\nthe Secretary-General for his comprehensive and\r\nincisive report on the work of the Organization, as\r\ncontained in document A/59/1. I should like to\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General in particular for his\r\ninitiatives and perseverance to ensure that the United\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nNations continues to have a central role in the\r\nmultilateral decision-making process, in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and in\r\nthe promotion of international cooperation.\r\nAs described in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, events and developments occurring in the past\r\nyear clearly demonstrated that the international\r\ncommunity and the United Nations have had to\r\nconfront many challenges throughout an\r\nextraordinarily challenging year. Most of those\r\nchallenges require concerted efforts based on credible\r\nand effective multilateral cooperation and\r\nunderstanding premised on the principles and purposes\r\nof the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe challenges of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security; the further\r\nstrengthening of international cooperation; the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals;\r\nthe eradication of poverty and hunger; the promotion\r\nof trade and sustainable development; the provision of\r\nhumanitarian assistance and disaster relief; the\r\npromotion of human rights, democracy, good\r\ngovernance, justice and the rule of law, in particular in\r\npost-conflict societies; the fight against infectious\r\ndiseases; and international efforts to combat terrorism:\r\nall of these remain enormous tasks for the United\r\nNations and the international community. The\r\nSecretary-General has clearly envisioned the need for a\r\nmore robust response. For this he has entrusted the\r\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change to\r\nmake bold and practicable recommendations on\r\npolicies, processes and institutions. My delegation has\r\nwelcomed the establishment of the Panel and looks\r\nforward to its recommendations. We agree that the\r\nUnited Nations has to change in order to better meet\r\ncurrent and future challenges and threats.\r\nThe call for reform of the United Nations\r\ncontinues to resonate in the General Assembly. During\r\nthe recent general debate, leaders unanimously called\r\nupon Member States to take bold initiatives and steps\r\nto ensure a genuine reform and restructuring of the\r\nOrganization. Reform has to be undertaken in a\r\ncomprehensive, holistic and objective manner\r\ninvolving all organs and relevant bodies of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMy delegation continues firmly to believe that the\r\nSecurity Council must be reformed and restructured to\r\npromote democratic practices in its decision-making\r\nwhich would reflect international geopolitical realities\r\nand the overall current membership of the United\r\nNations. We wish to reiterate that, besides the question\r\nof an increase in the permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembership categories of the Security Council, the\r\nrights and privileges accorded to members — in\r\nparticular the veto power vested in the permanent\r\nmembers — must be seriously reviewed, with a view to\r\nphasing it out completely in due course.\r\nSimilarly, the process of revitalizing the General\r\nAssembly must continue. This includes making it\r\npossible for it to rectify an injustice brought about by\r\nthe exercise of the veto power by a permanent member\r\nof the Security Council, for instance, by way of making\r\ncertain types of resolutions in the General Assembly\r\ncapable of setting aside a veto in the Security Council.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General has\r\nelaborated on several armed conflicts and their grim\r\nconsequences and ramifications. Conflicts remain\r\nunresolved in the Middle East, while at the same time\r\nlongstanding and new conflicts in the African region\r\ncontinue to require the international community’s\r\nattention. The courageous efforts of the leaders of\r\nAfrica — through, inter alia, the African Union, the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)\r\nand the African Peer Review Mechanism — to address\r\nthe root causes of conflict and deploy the African\r\nUnion’s own peacekeeping forces in the continent must\r\nbe commended and supported.\r\nMy delegation also takes note of the continuing\r\nefforts made by the United Nations and its agencies to\r\nassist Member States in addressing the root causes of\r\nconflict and in building their long-term capacity for the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. The increase in the\r\nnumber of peace- building and peacekeeping missions\r\nin the past year has also placed great strain on the\r\nOrganization’s resources and its capacity to plan,\r\ndeploy and manage those missions.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation would like to urge\r\nMember States to positively respond to the call for\r\nsustained political support and for an increase in the\r\nfinancial commitment of Member States, to further\r\nensure the success of United Nations peace-building\r\nand peacekeeping missions. We should not shy away\r\nfrom supporting and committing ourselves to the\r\nefforts and programmes that are being carried out\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, be they\r\nattempts aimed at the prevention or resolution of\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nconflicts, the provision of humanitarian assistance in\r\nconflict areas, or post-conflict peace-building in\r\naccordance with the Charter. Malaysia remains\r\ncommitted to supporting United Nations peacekeeping\r\nand peace-building activities.\r\nOn the situation in the Middle East, Iraq is a clear\r\nexample of a case where nations cannot go it alone,\r\nparticularly in the reconstruction process and in efforts\r\nto bring about peace and security. Once again my\r\ndelegation would like to stress that the United Nations\r\nhas a role, and should be given that rightful role, to\r\nplay in Iraq. As we see it, what is needed now is the\r\ncollective will to enable the United Nations to\r\nundertake that responsibility in a secure and safe\r\nenvironment. This could then provide an incentive and\r\nan opportunity for the States Members of the United\r\nNations to fulfil their obligations and assist Iraq in\r\nreconstruction and post-conflict peace-building efforts.\r\nMalaysia is prepared to participate under such\r\ncircumstances.\r\nMy delegation strongly believes that the situation\r\nin the Middle East and the question of Palestine remain\r\nan important cornerstone of the work of the United\r\nNations. Serious work needs to be done in the General\r\nAssembly and in the Security Council, and also by the\r\nSecretary-General. We are concerned that efforts in the\r\nSecurity Council have been blocked recently. We are\r\nequally concerned at the fact that there are also\r\ndeclared intentions to curtail United Nations activities\r\nconcerning Palestine in respect of work done in the\r\nGeneral Assembly and in subsidiary bodies created by\r\nit, as well as work done by the Secretariat and United\r\nNations agencies. The historic advisory opinion\r\nrendered by the International Court of Justice on the\r\nlegal consequences of the construction of a wall in the\r\noccupied Palestinian territory was indeed a great\r\nachievement. However, it is most unfortunate, as well\r\nas unacceptable, that follow-up action to the advisory\r\nopinion has not been taken, including in the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe situation in the occupied Palestinian territory\r\nremains volatile, and the humanitarian situation has\r\ndeteriorated even further. There is no solution other\r\nthan the end of Israeli occupation and the creation of a\r\nPalestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital,\r\nwith Israel and Palestine coexisting peacefully side by\r\nside within secure and recognized borders.\r\nThe United Nations must be allowed to play a\r\nrole, together with other members of the Quartet, to\r\nresuscitate the road map. At the same time the\r\ninternational community must also bring its full weight\r\nto bear in pushing for an independent and sovereign\r\nState of Palestine. To create an environment of\r\nconfidence for the speedy resuscitation of the road\r\nmap, we must seriously consider the approval of the\r\ndeployment of a United Nations peacekeeping force or\r\nthe placement of an international monitoring\r\nmechanism to oversee the implementation of the road\r\nmap. Malaysia urges the Secretary-General to exert\r\ngreater efforts in that connection.\r\nMalaysia continues to be gravely concerned over\r\nterrorist acts and State terrorism, which are capable of\r\nundermining peace and security at the national,\r\nregional and international levels. Malaysia has\r\nextended, and will continue to extend, its full\r\ncooperation and support to international efforts to\r\neliminate this scourge. However, my delegation\r\ncontinues to believe that this question warrants an\r\nappreciation of its complexity. The issue of terrorism\r\nshould be approached in a comprehensive manner,\r\nnamely by formulating a universally accepted\r\ndefinition, identifying its root causes and undertaking\r\nappropriate measures to deal with them, as well as\r\nworking towards universalizing international legal\r\ninstruments concerning this question. We maintain that\r\nthe United Nations has a vital role to play in that\r\nregard, including in the convening of an international\r\nconference on terrorism.\r\nOn the threat to international security posed by\r\nall weapons of mass destruction, Malaysia is concerned\r\nat the slow pace of progress in the process of achieving\r\ncomplete and general disarmament, particularly as\r\nconcerns nuclear weapons. We believe that, while the\r\nthreat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\r\nmust be confronted, attention should not be diverted\r\nfrom the need to proceed speedily with the work on\r\ndisarmament carried out within the United Nations.\r\nMalaysia believes also that the problem of small arms\r\nand light weapons, which have caused death and injury\r\nto millions of human beings, many of them innocent\r\ncivilians and non-combatants, must continue to be\r\nseriously addressed. Efforts must be deployed to\r\nregulate and restrict the flow of small arms and light\r\nweapons to prevent illicit transfers.\r\nA lot has been said at the United Nations about\r\ndemocracy, justice and the rule of law. My delegation\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nagrees that the promotion of democracy and good\r\ngovernance, and respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, are mutually reinforcing. While\r\nthe rule of law and democratic principles are observed\r\nin our own countries, we must find genuine ways and\r\nmeans of ensuring that this is also observed in relations\r\namong States. The policy and practice of pursuing\r\nunilateral coercive measures as a means of exerting\r\npressure on countries to achieve certain national\r\nobjectives are clearly contrary to the fundamental\r\nprinciples of democracy, international law and the\r\nnorms of international relations. They are also often\r\ncounterproductive. The United Nations should be the\r\nforum for resolving such issues of collective concern.\r\nGreater political will and a deeper commitment\r\non all sides are needed to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015. High levels of mortality\r\nand the uncontrollable spread of deadly diseases are\r\nimportant issues that require urgent attention.\r\nSimilarly, the donor community should also increase\r\nhumanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of the\r\nmillions of people affected by conflicts and natural\r\ndisasters. This is where multilateral cooperation should\r\nwork at its best: the rich helping the poor, with the\r\npoor committed to helping themselves. There has to be\r\ngreater North-South cooperation in terms of trade,\r\ninvestment and financing for development. There also\r\nhas to be a concerted effort to increase South-South\r\ncooperation. The United Nations can continue to help\r\nfacilitate and even spearhead many of those efforts.\r\nThe recently launched initiative to reduce hunger\r\nand eradicate poverty, as contained in the New York\r\nDeclaration on Action Against Hunger and Poverty of\r\n20 September 2004, is highly commendable. Similarly,\r\nthe forthcoming International Meeting to Review the\r\nImplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action\r\nfor Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States, to be convened in Mauritius early\r\nnext year, deserves the international community’s\r\nserious attention and support. Clearly, the international\r\ncommunity needs to act more vigorously to eradicate\r\npoverty and hunger, eliminate deadly diseases, promote\r\nsustainable development and narrow the digital divide.\r\nThe United Nations system remains our hope for\r\nbringing our commitments to fruition.\r\nIn conclusion, our hope for a better, peaceful\r\nworld for all remains with the United Nations. For\r\nalmost six decades now, the United Nations has\r\nstruggled to maintain its role as envisaged in the\r\nCharter, in spite of the imperfections, shortcomings\r\nand constraints generally imposed on it by none other\r\nthan the Member States themselves. The United\r\nNations is the beacon for multilateralism that needs to\r\nkeep burning. It needs to be reformed and restructured\r\naccording to the times and in keeping with current and\r\nfuture challenges. The Secretary-General has\r\nconstantly reminded us of that.\r\nWe believe that under your guidance,\r\nMr. President, the current session of the General\r\nAssembly will set the pace for the hard work that is\r\nrequired ahead. Let us respond to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s hope — as reflected in his report — that\r\nwhen we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations,\r\n“Member States, the Secretariat and other entities\r\nof the United Nations system, civil society and\r\nbusiness organizations, as well as individuals\r\naround the world, will work together to ensure\r\nthat the anniversary will be worthy of the United\r\nNations and everything for which it stands.”\r\n(A/59/1, para. 297)\r\nMr. Jenie (Indonesia): The delegation of\r\nIndonesia is pleased to welcome the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/59/1), which is his annual statement of the response\r\nof our Organization to international developments\r\nduring the year. This report will serve as a good basis\r\nfor our deliberations on issues of particular importance,\r\nespecially in the light of next year’s high-level\r\nmeeting.\r\nThe Secretary-General has rightly pointed out\r\nthat the United Nations has been through an\r\nextraordinarily challenging year. It has struggled with\r\nan assortment of challenges that include the situation in\r\nIraq, terrorism, increased peacekeeping demands and\r\nhumanitarian emergencies. On the eve of its sixtieth\r\nanniversary, our Organization continues to face the\r\nmenace of poverty, disease and environmental issues.\r\nDespite that, we are pleased that the Organization\r\nhas continued to be involved in trying to improve the\r\nconditions of peoples around the world, in\r\nimplementation of the Charter. It is gratifying that no\r\nmatter the difficulties, the United Nations continues to\r\nbe regarded as playing a central role in maintaining and\r\nbuilding international peace and security. The report of\r\nthe Secretary-General attests favourably to that\r\ncharacterization.\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nNext year, we will hold the five-year review of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration and will review other\r\nrecent major United Nations summits and conferences.\r\nIndonesia shares the view that efforts to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals will succeed only if\r\ndeveloped and developing countries adopt the right\r\ncombination of national and international policies and\r\nimplement their shared commitments as set out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus on\r\nFinancing for Development and the Johannesburg Plan\r\nof Implementation on sustainable development.\r\nIt is noteworthy that the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral highlights the holistic approach with which the\r\nOrganization has assisted vulnerable groups such as\r\nwomen, children, youth, refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons, people living with HIV/AIDS and\r\nmigrants. Those efforts are imperative in helping\r\nMember States achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, in particular by better coordinating and\r\nstrengthening all agencies in order to connect the Goals\r\nto national policies and strategies.\r\nWith regard to HIV/AIDS, the report states that\r\nUnited Nations agencies have embarked on\r\nstrengthening and coordinating their efforts at the\r\ncountry level. We believe that coordinated action and\r\nunified United Nations policy and programme support\r\nat the country level will contribute to the efforts to\r\nreverse the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS. However, we\r\nshare the concern expressed by the Secretary-General\r\nthat resources need to be increased substantially to\r\nenable countries to meet the goals set at the 2001\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS.\r\nIn Indonesia, we have been mainstreaming\r\nMillennium Development Goals in our national\r\ndevelopment policy and strategies. The first\r\nMillennium Development Goals progress report,\r\npublished last May, captures Indonesia’s situation over\r\nthe period from 1990 to 2003 and summarizes the\r\nchallenges, policies and programmes relating to the\r\nrealization of the objectives.\r\nWhile we seek, and must continue to seek, the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations in the execution of\r\nits mandate, we are all conscious of the point that the\r\nOrganization must begin by being efficient in its\r\nmethods and strong in its structures.\r\nFor too long, the reform of the United Nations\r\nhas not progressed much. However, it is reform — not\r\nrhetoric — that can position our Organization to\r\nperform at its best. The objective of the reform must be\r\nto enhance multilateralism, which is the only vehicle\r\nthrough which the complex challenges before us today\r\ncan be resolved. It is also the only way that the\r\nauthority, the legitimacy and the credibility of the\r\nUnited Nations can continue to be respected\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nWe must enhance the authority and the role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly as the Organization’s chief\r\ndeliberative, policy-making and representative organ,\r\nwhich is what it was designed to be. Its relationships\r\nwith the Security Council and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil need to be strengthened with a view to\r\nensuring increased cooperation, coordination and the\r\ncomplementarity of the work programmes of the three\r\norgans in accordance with their Charter mandates.\r\nIndeed, we must make the Security Council more\r\ndemocratic by broadening its membership to realign it\r\nwith the geopolitical realities of our time — not those\r\nof the post-war period of 1945. We must go further in\r\nthis process by courageously facing related issues, such\r\nas permanent membership and the veto power, in order\r\nto make a representative, democratic, transparent,\r\nrelevant and effective Council.\r\nSimilarly, the reform must go far enough to\r\nensure that the role and the authority of the Economic\r\nand Social Council, as provided for in the Charter, are\r\nnot only protected but strengthened. That will enable\r\nthe Economic and Social Council to play its assigned\r\nrole and be of key value as a multilateral tool for social\r\nand economic progress and development.\r\nIn our view, regional organizations are a ready\r\nsource of support and assistance for the United Nations\r\nas it seeks to resolve those issues multilaterally. We\r\nbelieve that strong working partnerships with those\r\norganizations will go a long way towards\r\ncomplementing and extending the efforts of the United\r\nNations. The Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN) believes that a network of regional\r\nassociations working with the United Nations would\r\ngive a significant boost to the concept of\r\nmultilateralism.\r\nThe strength of those organizations, in addition to\r\nbeing closer to the grassroots, is that they are also\r\nbecoming more organized and more focused. At the\r\nninth ASEAN Summit in Indonesia last year, for\r\ninstance, members decided to establish an ASEAN\r\nCommunity, in line with ASEAN Vision 2020, which\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nwill comprise three pillars of cooperation: political and\r\nsecurity, economic and sociocultural. Not only can that\r\norganization be of greater effectiveness within ASEAN\r\nbut it can greatly assist in implementing United\r\nNations objectives in the area.\r\nIn this connection, permit me also to mention the\r\nNew Strategic Partnership with the continent of Africa\r\nthat Asia is promoting in the framework of South-\r\nSouth cooperation. This is the Asian-African Sub-\r\nregional Organizations Conference. The Partnership\r\nwill be launched formally in Bandung, Indonesia, in\r\n2005, in conjunction with the commemoration of the\r\ngolden jubilee of the 1955 Asia-Africa Conference. We\r\nbelieve such structural partnerships can lead to more\r\neffective fulfilment of such multilateral objectives as\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and can\r\ncomplement various initiatives, in particular the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development.\r\nOn the subject of terrorism, I would like to restate\r\nthat terrorism can be defeated, but the approach to\r\nseeking that victory must be multilateral and\r\ndemocratic. Efforts must be made to bring along all the\r\nnations of the world, because in the end, peace and\r\nsecurity are a basic desire of every man and woman. It\r\nis also important that the offensive against terrorism be\r\ncarried out with respect for human rights and the rule\r\nof law.\r\nFinally, I want to express the appreciation of my\r\ndelegation to the Secretary-General and to the staff of\r\nthe United Nations Secretariat for this report and for\r\nthe work they continue to do in support of peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. Bshaina (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): The delegation of Libya wishes to take this\r\nopportunity to express its gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on the work of the Organization,\r\ncontained in document A/59/1. This report clearly\r\nbrings out the serious, unflagging, results-oriented\r\nefforts to reform and develop the Organization. This\r\ncomprehensive report, welcomed by the international\r\ncommunity, attempts to describe the current\r\ninternational situation, speaks of successes as well as\r\nfailures in dealing with international events and\r\nchallenges, and sets forth proposals for achieving more\r\neffective solutions in these areas.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General emphasizes\r\nthe problems that the United Nations faces in carrying\r\nout its mandate in maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity and stresses the increase in demand for\r\npeacekeeping activities. We would like to say that State\r\nsovereignty must be respected; this principle cannot be\r\nviolated. For this reason, we strongly oppose a country\r\nor group of countries interfering in the internal affairs\r\nof other countries under any pretext, including the so-\r\ncalled humanitarian interventions that have recently\r\nreceived certain support.\r\nThe United Nations Charter should be the only\r\nlegal basis for all measures taken to preserve\r\ninternational security. All other actions undertaken\r\noutside of this framework are flagrant violations of all\r\ninternational instruments that regulate relationships\r\namong States.\r\nThe Charter specifically forbids threats or use of\r\nforce and intervention in the internal affairs of other\r\ncountries. It clearly details the proper ways of handling\r\nall humanitarian problems that might endanger\r\ninternational peace and sets forth the mechanism for\r\nthis in the General Assembly. We continue to support\r\nthe strengthening of the Charter’s role in resolving\r\ninternational problems, including work in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The\r\ninternational community should strive to oppose all\r\nattempts to act outside of internationally established\r\nmechanisms. To ignore this fact or to close one’s eyes\r\nto it can serve as a pretext for intervention in the affairs\r\nof other States and would lead to the violation of the\r\nfoundations of international order, including\r\nsovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity\r\nand non-interference in the internal affairs of a State.\r\nThe report spells out in detail the efforts\r\nundertaken to resolve international and regional\r\nconflicts and observes that many such conflicts have\r\nbeen resolved through negotiations. It states clearly\r\nthat prospects for peace in Africa have improved, and\r\nin this respect I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, on behalf of my country, for his support of\r\nAfrican States in these efforts. However, we feel that\r\nmore efforts must be made to resolve the remaining\r\nconflicts and to prevent all crises that could threaten\r\nwhat has already been achieved. We firmly believe that\r\ndealing with the root causes of Africa’s problems can\r\noccur only through an overall approach, giving priority\r\nto what Africans see as Africa’s concerns. This is why\r\nthe work of the African Union to end conflicts and the\r\nfunding required for it are the only solution to dealing\r\nwith instability in certain States on the continent.\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nMy delegation supports the ongoing revitalization\r\nefforts within the United Nations and calls for reform\r\nof the organs of our Organization. The General\r\nAssembly must work effectively and have the power\r\nthat would allow it to have leadership and monitoring\r\ncapabilities, as well as accountability for all other\r\nmechanisms and bodies of the Organization, including\r\nthe Security Council. It is through transparency and\r\nrespect for multilateralism that we can face the\r\nchallenges of today’s world.\r\nMr. Sow (Guinea) (spoke in French):\r\nMr. President, I am taking the floor for the first time\r\nbefore the Assembly at its fifty-ninth session and\r\nwould like to congratulate you upon your election as\r\nPresident.\r\nThe present debate provides me with the\r\nopportunity to express yet again to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral the great appreciation of the Guinean\r\nGovernment for the quality of his leadership at the\r\nhelm of our institution.\r\nThe report now being considered (A/59/1) is\r\nvaluable in that it provides a thorough summary of\r\nwhat our Organization has done over the last 12\r\nmonths to respond to the enormous challenges of\r\ntoday. It highlights the limitations and gaps, as well as\r\nthe consolidation, the increase and breadth of activities\r\nconducted in all areas by the international community,\r\nparticularly in the area of peace and security, economic\r\nand social development, humanitarian assistance,\r\nhuman rights and the struggle against all forms and\r\nmanifestations of terrorism.\r\nMy country expresses its support for the positive\r\nand encouraging developments in the peace process in\r\nBurundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea-\r\nBissau, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the\r\nsouthern Sudan. Under the auspices of the African\r\nUnion and its subregional organizations, an epoch of\r\npeace, stability and development is taking shape across\r\nthe African continent that, until recently, had been\r\nravaged by war, conflict, famine and\r\nunderdevelopment.\r\nMy delegation would like to say that it is very\r\npleased by the information and assessment mission\r\ncarried out by the Security Council in West Africa\r\nfrom 20 to 29 June 2004. The thorough-going\r\nexchanges of views during the discussion on 28 June,\r\nin Conakry, between the President of the Republic of\r\nGuinea, General Lansana Conté, and the members of\r\nthe Security Council on varied and complex issues\r\ncertainly indicate both the determination of our\r\nGovernment to work tirelessly to restore peace and\r\nsecurity in the Mano River basin and the Council’s\r\nunflagging interest in helping Guinea to consolidate its\r\npeaceful and stabilizing influence in the subregion.\r\nThe Mano River Union Summit, held on 20 May\r\nand bringing together Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone\r\nin Conakry, is part of this dynamic. In participating as\r\nobservers at this summit, the presidents of Mali and\r\nCôte d’Ivoire emphasized their determination to work\r\nto strengthen peace in West Africa. Here, I would like\r\nto fulfil the important duty of reiterating the appeal\r\nlaunched on behalf of my country regarding the\r\nreconstruction of the forest zone, which for over 15\r\nyears has served as a temporary home for hundreds of\r\nthousands of refugees and displaced persons.\r\nIn the Middle East, the peace process between\r\nIsrael and the Palestinians is bogged down as never\r\nbefore. The joint efforts of the international community\r\nand the Quartet, in particular, remain futile. My\r\ncountry is now more concerned than ever by the\r\nsituation in occupied Palestine. We call upon all the\r\nparties to fulfil their respective obligations under the\r\nroad map. We support the idea that all final settlements\r\non the issues of borders and refugees must be\r\nnegotiated by the parties and be based on the\r\ninternational peace process plan. We condemn all\r\nterrorist acts in the region and demand that Israel, the\r\noccupying Power, fulfil its legal obligations, which are\r\nmentioned in the International Court of Justice’s\r\nconsultative opinion regarding the building of the\r\nseparation wall.\r\nWe must recognize that achieving the goals\r\nmentioned in the United Nations Charter involves,\r\namong other things, strengthening the institutional\r\ncapacities of our Organization in the area of conflict\r\nprevention and the restoration of peace. It is\r\nencouraging to see that this aspect is being taken into\r\naccount by United Nations country teams on the\r\nground as they develop their programmes, as indicated\r\nin paragraph 40 of the Secretary-General’s report. My\r\ndelegation also believes that the increase in the demand\r\nfor United Nations peacekeeping activities, which is\r\nreflected in the creation of new missions, expresses the\r\nwill of the Secretariat and the Security Council to\r\neffectively carry out their respective mandates.\r\nHowever, Guinea strongly believes that the\r\neffectiveness and success of United Nations\r\n29\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\ninterventions in the areas of peacekeeping and peace-\r\nbuilding are still linked to finding integrated regional\r\napproaches that take into account the interdependence\r\nof the causes and consequences of conflicts.\r\nWhile the measures taken by the United Nations\r\nand various regional actors to protect peace and\r\ninternational security have allowed, in general, for the\r\nalleviation of the suffering of the millions of people\r\nwho are victims of conflict, my country believes, as\r\ndoes the Secretary-General, that humanitarian aid is,\r\nalas, unequally distributed and, what is more, falls\r\nshort of addressing the real needs of populations. The\r\n20 per cent drop in the total number of refugees in the\r\nworld between 2002 and 2004 is no justification for the\r\ndrastic cuts in resources. Amendments must be\r\nimmediately made to effectively mobilize and manage\r\ninternational humanitarian aid. The provision of\r\ninternational aid must also follow agreed upon\r\nprinciples, basing itself on coherency, effectiveness\r\nand accountability. In this context, it is up to the\r\nUnited Nations to pay particular attention to forgotten\r\nemergencies and to develop its rapid response systems.\r\nFurthermore, my delegation would like to\r\nemphasize the need to constantly keep in mind that\r\nefforts under way in countries emerging from conflict\r\nmust allow for the transition from humanitarian aid to\r\ndevelopment. In other words, better planning for\r\ntransition in the countries concerned must be based on\r\nthe development of a unified, coherent strategy for the\r\nentire United Nations system and of a permanent\r\nsupport mechanism for United Nations country teams.\r\nMy Government supports the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General for Africa and the appeal to\r\nimplement his recommendations contained in his 1998\r\nreport on the causes of conflicts and the promotion of\r\nsustainable peace and sustainable development in\r\nAfrica (A/52/871). We must work, above all, to\r\nstrengthen our Organization by supporting the\r\nSecretary-General’s initiatives and innovative and\r\ncourageous activities which are forward-looking in\r\nterms of reforming the main bodies of the United\r\nNations. In this context, the efforts underway to carry\r\nout priorities agreed upon at the Millennium Summit\r\nand at world conferences in the framework of the\r\nUnited Nations activities continue to be an important\r\nand beneficial step in the right direction. Coordinated\r\nand sustained actions based on trust and on shared\r\nresponsibility between the Organization and all of its\r\npartners are also necessary in order to reverse negative\r\ntrends visible in the most vulnerable parts of the world\r\nand to promote the progress of all humanity. There is,\r\ntherefore, a pressing need to continue to work in all\r\nareas toward reform, in particular in the main bodies of\r\nthe Organization. The Republic of Guinea decisively\r\ncommits itself to this.\r\nFinally, as to the numerous challenges we face, I\r\nmust mention the relevance of the basic values that\r\nunderlie the goals of the United Nations through its\r\nCharter. Guinea believes that the preservation of these\r\nassets is one aspect of the primacy of the rule of law\r\nand multilateralism.\r\nMr. Diarra (Mali): Mr. President, my delegation\r\nwould like to reiterate our support to you in the\r\naccomplishment of your duties. On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, I would like to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor the quality of his report and the relevance of his\r\nrecommendations.\r\nThis report, like previous annual reports, calls our\r\nattention to old and new threats and challenges that the\r\ninternational community faces at the beginning of this\r\ntwenty-first century. Of the 30 crises mentioned, more\r\nthan half of them are of an intra-State nature. Very\r\noften, this involves the central Power confronting non-\r\nState armed groups, or conflicts between communities.\r\nThese conflicts are fed by the illicit circulation of small\r\narms and light weapons, by trafficking in natural\r\nresources and by the use of child soldiers. Today, there\r\nare 9.7 million refugees and 4.2 million displaced\r\npersons around the world because of these conflicts. In\r\nJuly 2004, 16 United Nations peacekeeping operations\r\nwere deployed throughout the world, accounting for a\r\ntotal of more than 56,000 soldiers. Six of these\r\noperations are in Africa. These peacekeeping\r\noperations require the political support of Member\r\nStates and financial and human resources that are very\r\noften lacking. This is particularly visible during the\r\npost-conflict phase, when the re-launching of the\r\nconcerned States’ economies is a necessary step in\r\norder to avoid the resurgence of confrontation. It is\r\ntherefore appropriate that we reinforce the\r\nreconstruction aspect of peacekeeping operations.\r\nOur Organization has understood that a regional\r\napproach is often best suited for managing those\r\nconflicts. Thus in West Africa the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General assessed the\r\ncrossborder impact of the conflicts raging in the region\r\nin order to find comprehensive solutions.\r\n30\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nOur Organization has also formed partnerships\r\nwith regional organizations to prevent and manage\r\ncrisis situations. Thus, the United Nations has\r\nsupported the African Union in the creation of the\r\nPeace and Security Council and of an African stand-by\r\nforce. The partnership between the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States and the Office of\r\nthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General for\r\nWest Africa has also been strengthened.\r\nHowever, in the end, the prevention of armed\r\nconflicts is the least onerous approach in terms of\r\nhuman and financial costs. In that regard, General\r\nAssembly resolution 57/337 commits the United\r\nNations system to provide increased assistance to\r\nMember States to strengthen their capabilities, as well\r\nas the capabilities of local institutions and civil society,\r\nin the area of conflict prevention.\r\nCurrent international and regional measures to\r\ncombat the illicit trade in small arms are also an\r\nimportant factor in conflict prevention. The United\r\nNations Programme of Action on Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons, the proposed international convention\r\non marking and tracing of small arms and regional\r\nmoratoriums and other codes of conduct are all\r\npraiseworthy initiatives.\r\nUniversal accession to the Ottawa Convention on\r\nlandmines — which is the focus of the upcoming\r\nNairobi Summit on a Mine-Free World — and the\r\ndestruction of those mines by the countries that possess\r\nthem would save thousands of lives in crisis-affected\r\ncountries. In that context, we welcome the fact that 46\r\nAfrican countries have become parties to the\r\nConvention.\r\nIntra-State conflicts often have their origins in\r\nchronic underdevelopment, the lack of social cohesion\r\nand the lack of political and economic governance. In\r\nthat regard, comprehensive and coherent assistance\r\nfrom the United Nations to countries through the\r\nUnited Nations Development Group will assist\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nat the national level.\r\nThe achievements of biotechnology and\r\ninformation and communication technologies are\r\nidentified in the report as effective means for achieving\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. It would therefore\r\nbe useful to contribute to the success of the second\r\nphase of the World Summit on the Information Society,\r\nto be held in Tunis in November 2005. I am sure that at\r\nthe Summit, proposals for the regulation of information\r\ntechnology and funds for overcoming the digital divide\r\nwill meet with a response commensurate with our\r\nexpectations, thus narrowing the digital divide between\r\nthe North and the South.\r\nThe report also proposes effectively fighting\r\nhunger and poverty by strengthening the capacity of\r\nrural inhabitants and their organizations and improving\r\ntheir access to natural resources, technological means\r\nof production and to financial services.\r\nIn a country such as Mali, where 80 per cent of\r\nthe working population lives in rural areas, it is\r\nnecessary to invest in agriculture by improving water\r\ncontrol technology and building rural infrastructure.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council devoted part of its\r\n2004 substantive session to studying that issue. In that\r\ncontext, we welcome the Council’s ministerial\r\ndeclaration for resources mobilization for least\r\ndeveloped countries. The Human Security Network\r\nadopted a declaration on food security last May in\r\nBamako that shares that approach.\r\nMali endorses the 20 September declaration at the\r\nconclusion of the Summit for Action against Hunger\r\nand Poverty, an initiative of Brazil and France.\r\nIn addition to the lack of rural infrastructure,\r\nwhich seriously hinders development, other natural\r\nfactors such as cyclical drought and locust plagues\r\nexacerbate the already precarious situation of the\r\npeoples of the Sahel. The support of the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization (FAO) is valuable, but the\r\nFAO requires material support to help those people.\r\nTherefore, the international community must act\r\nquickly.\r\nAchieving the Millennium Development Goals\r\nalso requires universalizing access to quality primary\r\neducation. Today, 121 million children throughout the\r\nworld, including 65 million girls, do not attend school.\r\nImproving medical coverage through the\r\nestablishment of a national programme for a health\r\ndecade is also part of ongoing efforts to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. That is another\r\nimportant initiative that the Government of Mali has\r\nlaunched as part of its strategic framework to combat\r\npoverty.\r\nTo deal with the threat of HIV/AIDS, Mali has\r\nlaunched an ambitious multisectoral programme with\r\nthe assistance of its partners. The programme\r\n31\r\nA/59/PV.22\r\nencompasses prevention, treatment and social\r\nintegration of those affected. In that context, we\r\nwelcome the actions of our international partners to\r\ncombat infectious diseases, which are the new threat to\r\ndeveloping interactions among States.\r\nWe welcome the effective action of the Office of\r\nthe High Representative for the Least Developed\r\nCountries, Landlocked Developing Countries and\r\nSmall Island Developing States, which was created to\r\ndeal with the special needs of the vulnerable\r\neconomies of those countries.\r\nThe situation of those countries, a group to which\r\nmy country belongs, requires a substantial increase in\r\nofficial development assistance and a significant\r\nreduction — if not the complete cancellation — of\r\nthose countries’ external debt.\r\nWe must also ensure the integration of those\r\nvulnerable economies in a more equitable international\r\ntrade system that is more predictable and more\r\nrespectful of regulations. That would benefit the\r\nsectors of our economies that have a comparative\r\nadvantage. The Cotton Initiative provides an example.\r\nWe welcome the 1 August 2004 framework\r\nagreement of the General Council of the World Trade\r\nOrganization, which gives special treatment to the\r\nissue of cotton among the issues related to agricultural\r\nsubsidies. The contribution of the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development to strengthen\r\nthe negotiating capabilities of those countries is also\r\ngreatly appreciated.\r\nIn conclusion, the developments I have\r\nmentioned concerning issues of interest to my country\r\namply demonstrate the relevance of multilateralism and\r\nthe need to find collective solutions. My delegation\r\nbelieves that strengthening the rule of law and respect\r\nfor human rights must continue to be the cardinal\r\nvalues of the Organization. Humankind’s well-being\r\nmust be the goal of all our initiatives. We must protect\r\nthe moral and physical integrity of human beings, who\r\nmust be freed from both need and fear. That is the aim\r\nof the Human Security and also the belief of my\r\ncountry, Mali.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.\r\n"
