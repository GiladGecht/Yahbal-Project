(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 113 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/59/421)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): If there is no\r\nproposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall\r\ntake it that the General Assembly decides not to\r\ndiscuss the report of the Fifth Committee that is before\r\nthe Assembly today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Statements will\r\ntherefore be limited to explanations of vote. The\r\npositions of delegations regarding the\r\nrecommendations of the Fifth Committee have been\r\nmade clear in the Committee and are reflected in the\r\nrelevant official records.\r\nMay I remind members that, under paragraph 7 of\r\ndecision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that\r\n“When the same draft resolution is\r\nconsidered in a Main Committee and in plenary\r\nmeeting, a delegation should, as far as possible,\r\nexplain its vote only once, that is, either in the\r\nCommittee or in plenary meeting, unless that\r\ndelegation’s vote in plenary meeting is different\r\nfrom its vote in the Committee.”\r\nMay I remind delegations that, also in accordance\r\nwith General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations\r\nof vote are limited to 10 minutes.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the\r\nrecommendation contained in the report of the Fifth\r\nCommittee, I would like to advise representatives that\r\nwe are going to proceed to take a decision in the same\r\nmanner as was done in the Fifth Committee.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on the\r\ndraft resolution recommended by the Fifth Committee\r\nin paragraph 9 of its report.\r\nThe Fifth Committee adopted the draft resolution\r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution\r\n59/1).\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of\r\nagenda item 113.\r\nAgenda item 7\r\nNotification by the Secretary-General under Article\r\n12, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/59/335)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): As members\r\nare aware, in accordance with the provisions of Article\r\n12, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nand with the consent of the Security Council, the\r\nSecretary-General is mandated to notify the General\r\nAssembly of matters relative to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security that are being dealt\r\nwith by the Security Council and of matters with which\r\nthe Council has ceased to deal.\r\nIn that connection, the General Assembly has\r\nbefore it a note by the Secretary-General issued as\r\ndocument A/59/335. May I take it that the Assembly\r\ntakes note of that document?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda items 11 and 53\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/59/2)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nSir Emyr Jones Parry, President of the Security\r\nCouncil, to introduce the Council’s report.\r\nSir Emyr Jones Parry: On behalf of all members\r\nof the Security Council, I would like to offer my\r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession. It is my sincere hope that during your tenure,\r\nrelations between the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly will continue to develop and strengthen as\r\nboth bodies move forward to meet the many challenges\r\nfacing the international community in the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nI have the honour today, as President of the\r\nSecurity Council for October 2004, to introduce the\r\nannual report of the Council (A/59/2) to the General\r\nAssembly. The report I am presenting today covers the\r\nperiod from 1 August 2003 until 31 July 2004. The\r\nintroduction to the annual report, prepared by Romania\r\nin its capacity as President of the Security Council in\r\nJuly, sets out in detail the Council’s activities for the\r\nperiod under review.\r\nAs members will see from the annual report, the\r\nSecurity Council has addressed a wide range of\r\nconflicts, threats to peace and security and the United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations established to restore\r\nstability in those situations. The report gives a\r\ncomprehensive description of these activities, and I\r\nwould like to highlight here today some of the key\r\nissues on which the Council has focused.\r\nWest Africa saw progress in peace-building\r\nefforts, but also outbreaks of violence and political\r\ncrises. The Security Council has worked hard to\r\ndevelop strategies to deal with those complex\r\nsituations by encouraging all parties to engage in\r\npolitical negotiations and to avoid resorting to armed\r\nviolence, particularly against unarmed civilians and\r\nchildren. Council members underlined that message\r\nduring their mission to West Africa in June. They\r\nwelcomed the continued improvement in the\r\nconsolidation of security in Sierra Leone, with the\r\ncompletion of the disarmament, demobilization and\r\nreintegration process, followed by the start of trials at\r\nthe Special Court. Improvements in the overall security\r\nsituation in Liberia, as the United Nations Mission in\r\nLiberia deployed throughout the country, permitted the\r\nprocess of disarmament and demobilization to start re-\r\nintegrating ex- combatants back into society.\r\nAs the report to the General Assembly makes\r\nclear, achieving sustainable peace and development in\r\npost-conflict situations like those in West Africa\r\nrequires a collective approach. It is vital that the\r\nvarious parts of the United Nations family coordinate\r\ntheir efforts — including with other stakeholders\r\noutside the United Nations — to pursue common goals\r\nand a comprehensive, integrated strategy. That strategy\r\nmust encompass the transition from peacekeeping to\r\npeace-building, rule of law and development, if we are\r\nto create the conditions for lasting stability.\r\nDespite those positive indicators, much still\r\nneeds to be done to bring tranquility to the African\r\ncontinent – too many conflicts rage with innocent\r\ncivilians and children caught in the middle. The\r\ntransition process in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo remains intact, but has faced a series of\r\ndestabilizing incidents and challenges. On 22 June\r\n2004, the Security Council invited the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to consider enhancing the rapid reaction\r\ncapacity of the United Nations Organization Mission in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC).\r\nConsideration of MONUC’s capacity and future\r\nmandate continued throughout August. In Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, the Security Council strongly condemned\r\nviolations of human rights and international\r\nhumanitarian law and requested the Secretary-General\r\nto establish an international commission of inquiry to\r\ninvestigate all human rights violations.\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nCouncil members became increasingly concerned\r\nby reports of large-scale violations of human rights and\r\ninternational humanitarian law in Darfur, the Sudan,\r\nand about the potential that had to derail the north-\r\nsouth peace process in that country. In response to\r\nthose reports, the Security Council adopted a\r\npresidential statement on 25 May (S/PRST/2004/18),\r\nand resolution 1556 (2004) on 30 July 2004. The\r\nresolution called upon the Government of the Sudan to\r\nfulfil all the commitments made in the joint\r\ncommuniqué of 3 July 2004 and for the rebels, without\r\npreconditions, to negotiate a political settlement. The\r\nSecretary-General will continue to report to the\r\nSecurity Council on compliance with resolution 1556\r\n(2004), as well as on the situation in the Darfur region.\r\nThe Council also adopted resolution 1547 (2004) on\r\n11 June, authorizing the Secretary-General to establish\r\na special political mission in the Sudan to prepare for a\r\npeace support operation following the signature of a\r\ncomprehensive peace agreement.\r\nThe Security Council considered a number of\r\nissues relating to civilians affected by armed conflict,\r\nincluding the protection of civilians in armed conflict,\r\nHIV and AIDS, mine action, children affected by\r\narmed conflict and women, peace and security. The\r\noutput of that work included two resolutions. In August\r\n2003, following the bombing of United Nations\r\nheadquarters in Baghdad, the Council agreed on an\r\nunprecedented resolution on the protection of\r\nhumanitarian personnel in armed conflict. In April\r\n2004, the Council agreed on a further resolution on\r\nchildren affected by armed conflict, calling for\r\nconcrete steps to be taken in situations on the Council’s\r\nagenda where there are egregious violations of\r\nchildren’s rights.\r\nIn addition, the Security Council debated other\r\nissues related to the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, including justice and the rule of law; post-\r\nconflict national reconciliation; the role of business in\r\nconflict prevention, peacekeeping and peace-building;\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping; complex crises and the\r\nUnited Nations response; the role of civil society in\r\npost-conflict peace-building; cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations in\r\nstabilization processes; and civilian aspects of conflict\r\nmanagement and peace-building. One recurring theme\r\nof those debates was the need for greater interaction\r\nbetween the Security Council and the other bodies of\r\nthe United Nations, as well as with other regional and\r\ninternational organizations, to ensure a coherent,\r\ncollaborative approach to establishing and maintaining\r\npeace and security.\r\nThe coordination of international efforts for the\r\ndesign of long-term development strategies to achieve\r\nand sustain stability has also been the approach\r\nadopted with regard to Haiti. By its resolution 1542\r\n(2004), besides addressing security and political\r\naspects and the human rights situation, the Council\r\nemphasized the need for the international community\r\nto contribute to the promotion of social and economic\r\ndevelopment in that Caribbean country.\r\nOn 7 April 2004, on the occasion of the\r\ncommemoration of the Rwanda genocide, the President\r\nof the Security Council addressed the General\r\nAssembly on behalf of the Council (see A/58/PV.82).\r\nIn that statement, the Council, inter alia, expressed its\r\nsupport for the nomination of a special adviser to the\r\nSecretary-General on the prevention of genocide.\r\nIraq’s political transition featured prominently in\r\nthe Security Council. On 8 June, the Security Council\r\nunanimously adopted resolution 1546 (2004),\r\nendorsing the formation of a sovereign interim\r\nGovernment, defining the United Nations role and\r\nsetting a clear path for the future political process. That\r\npath included the formation of a sovereign interim\r\nGovernment of Iraq by 30 June 2004; the convening of\r\na national conference to select a consultative council;\r\nthe holding of direct democratic elections no later than\r\n31 January 2005 and the drafting of a permanent\r\nconstitution leading to a constitutionally elected\r\nGovernment by 31 December 2005.\r\nThe Council also decided in resolution 1546\r\n(2004) that, as circumstances permitted and as\r\nrequested by the Iraqi Government, the United Nations\r\nwould play a leading role: assisting in the convening of\r\nthe national conference; advising and supporting the\r\nprocess of holding elections; and promoting national\r\ndialogue and consensus-building on the drafting of a\r\nnational constitution.\r\nOn 28 June 2004, the Security Council welcomed\r\nthe handover of full responsibility and authority for\r\ngoverning Iraq to the fully sovereign and independent\r\nInterim Government of Iraq.\r\nOn Afghanistan, the Security Council received\r\nregular briefings and reports from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Department of Peacekeeping\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nOperations. Throughout those discussions, the Council\r\ncontinued to stress the importance of a secure\r\nenvironment for free, fair and credible democratic\r\nelections, scheduled for 9 October 2004. Linked to that\r\nwas the Council’s continued focus on the need to\r\naccelerate progress on the disarmament, demobilization\r\nand reintegration of former combatants in Afghanistan.\r\nOn 13 October 2003, through resolution 1510 (2003),\r\nthe Security Council authorized the expansion of the\r\nmandate of the International Security Assistance Force\r\nto allow it, as resources permitted, to support the\r\nAfghan Transitional Authority and its successors in the\r\nmaintenance of security in areas outside Afghanistan’s\r\ncapital, Kabul. On 26 March 2004, the Council also\r\nextended the mandate of the United Nations Assistance\r\nMission in Afghanistan for an additional 12 months.\r\nThe Security Council continued to consider the\r\nsituation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian\r\nquestion, on a regular basis, in particular with monthly\r\nbriefings by the Secretary-General or his\r\nrepresentatives. In November 2003, the Council\r\nadopted resolution 1515 (2003), endorsing the\r\nQuartet’s performance-based road map towards a\r\npermanent two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian\r\nconflict. The Council also continued to follow the\r\naspects of the conflict in the Middle East between\r\nIsrael and Syria and between Israel and Lebanon.\r\nThe threat to international peace and security by\r\nacts of terrorism throughout the world remained a high\r\npriority for the Security Council. The Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee continued to work intensively,\r\nand has now evolved to assume a more proactive role\r\nin its dialogue with Member States in order to evaluate\r\nthe implementation of Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001). The revitalization of the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee in February 2004 will enable the\r\nCommittee to take on a more operational and visible\r\napproach in order to strengthen the global international\r\nconsensus in the fight against terrorism.\r\nRelated to that, the Security Council tackled a\r\nthreat that had not been tackled before. Resolution\r\n1540 (2004), adopted on 28 April 2004, fills a gap in\r\nthe international community’s defences relating to the\r\nrisk that weapons of mass destruction might fall into\r\nthe hands of non-State actors. The Council attaches\r\nimportance to the fact that the adoption of the\r\nresolution was preceded by a series of intensive\r\nconsultations and discussions with Council and non-\r\nCouncil members. That was a concrete demonstration\r\nof the importance the Council attaches to the views of\r\nthe wider United Nations membership.\r\nThe Security Council remains focused on the\r\nneed to build upon past years’ levels of transparency.\r\nWhen possible, public sessions of the Council were\r\nheld, wrap-up meetings hosted and thematic debates in\r\nthe Council used to enhance our collective\r\nunderstanding of the key issues affecting the\r\ninternational community at large. That emphasis on\r\ntransparency is invaluable to the Security Council in\r\norder to enable the wider United Nations membership\r\nto interact more fully with the Security Council.\r\nTo make it more readable, the report before the\r\nAssembly is shorter than in the past. I also recognize\r\nthat the demand from non-Council members for more\r\ninformation on the Council’s activities will increase.\r\nThe Security Council will be attentive to the comments\r\nof Members on the report before the Assembly today in\r\nthe debate that will now follow.\r\nIn concluding, on behalf of all Security Council\r\nmembers, I would like to thank members of the\r\nAssembly for this opportunity to introduce the\r\nCouncil’s report. I would also like to express the\r\nappreciation of all Security Council members for the\r\nwork of the Secretary-General and the Secretariat at\r\nlarge. Their tireless professionalism, often in\r\ndangerous locations throughout the world, assists the\r\nCouncil to fulfil its role as set out in the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nIf I may, I shall now say something in my\r\nnational capacity. I would like to make a short\r\nstatement on the other agenda item being jointly\r\ndebated, namely, the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on the Security Council and related\r\nmatters.\r\nOne clear message that can be drawn from the\r\noverview that I have just given is that the Security\r\nCouncil’s primary role in maintaining international\r\npeace and security is as important as it has ever been.\r\nThe Council is active across the broad range of threats\r\nto international peace and security, both in managing\r\nindividual crises around the world and in addressing\r\nthe generic problems that face societies in conflict. The\r\nUnited Nations membership as a whole has a shared\r\ninterest in a Council that is credible, effective and\r\ndecisive.\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nThe United Kingdom believes that the Security\r\nCouncil would be strengthened by an increase in its\r\nmembership to ensure that it better represents the\r\nmodern world. As the British Foreign Secretary\r\nreminded us in his speech to the General Assembly at\r\nits 8th meeting, on 23 September, the United Kingdom\r\nhas long supported the case for expanding the Security\r\nCouncil in both the permanent and non-permanent\r\ncategories of membership. We support including\r\nGermany, Japan, India and Brazil among the permanent\r\nmembership. We also want to see a permanent member\r\nfrom Africa on the Council. An increase in the non-\r\npermanent membership also offers the chance to\r\nfurther enhance the voice of the developing world in\r\nthe Council’s discussions. This is a reform that we\r\nhave been discussing for many years, and one that the\r\nUnited Kingdom believes is now long overdue. We\r\nwould encourage all Member States to engage\r\nconstructively in the debate in order to find a solution\r\non which all can agree.\r\nAs well as reform to the Council’s membership,\r\nthe United Kingdom has continued to work for\r\nincreased transparency, accessibility and accountability\r\nin the Council’s work. Our debate today is part of the\r\ndeveloping relationship that exists between the Council\r\nand the General Assembly, as well as other parts of the\r\nUnited Nations system, such as the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and the Secretariat. Many of the\r\nsubjects on which the Council is engaged, such as the\r\nestablishment of justice and the rule of law, may\r\nequally engage the responsibilities of the principal\r\nbodies of the United Nations.\r\nThe United Kingdom looks forward to the\r\nforthcoming report of the Secretary-General’s High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. It is\r\nvital that the United Nations evolve to respond to the\r\nrange of changing threats and opportunities that face\r\nthe whole membership — from, for example,\r\nHIV/AIDS and environmental degradation to terrorism\r\nand the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A\r\nresponsive and effective Security Council is a vital part\r\nof that picture. We would encourage the Panel to\r\nensure that its proposals reinforce the Council’s ability\r\nto carry out the responsibilities entrusted to it by the\r\nCharter.\r\nMr. McIvor (New Zealand): I have the pleasure\r\nof making this statement on behalf of Australia,\r\nCanada and my own country, New Zealand.\r\nThis is the first time that our group of countries\r\nhas made a joint statement in plenary meeting on the\r\ntwo items under discussion. It reflects our commitment\r\nto efforts over the next 12 months towards reaching\r\nagreement on Security Council reform, and our shared\r\npositions on a range of issues about the working\r\nmethods and transparency of the Council.\r\nWe would first like to thank the Security Council\r\nand the Secretariat for the work that has gone into the\r\npreparation of this year’s report. It seems that the\r\nworkload of the Security Council is increasing in both\r\nintensity and volume each year, which has implications\r\nfor us all. Australia, Canada and New Zealand have the\r\nfollowing comments on the Council’s report, with\r\nsome suggestions on future action.\r\nFirst, on the transparency of the Security\r\nCouncil’s work, we welcome the number of open\r\nmeetings over the last year and ask that a greater\r\nproportion of such meetings be held in the future. Open\r\nmeetings and briefings are crucial to allowing\r\ninformation to flow between the Security Council and\r\nthe wider United Nations community. We think they\r\nimprove both the quality of the Council’s decision\r\nmaking and the membership’s understanding of the\r\nCouncil’s work. Early distribution of the monthly\r\nprogramme of work, even in draft form, is important in\r\nthat regard, particularly for small missions with limited\r\nresources.\r\nSecondly, although there have been some steps in\r\nthe right direction, there is still a long way to go in\r\nimproving Security Council consultation with the\r\nwider membership. While we fully recognize the need\r\nfor timely decision-making, the Council must seek the\r\nviews of Member States before taking decisions on\r\nissues that affect them, particularly decisions that\r\nimpose obligations on Member States to act. That is\r\nparticularly the case with respect to countries\r\ncontributing troops to United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations. The onus is on the Security Council to\r\ninitiate that dialogue at an early stage and to avoid\r\npresenting the membership with a fait accompli.\r\nDiscussions need to be meaningful, not lip service.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council remains a key\r\nissue. There is widespread support for expansion of the\r\nmembership of the Council, but no consensus on the\r\nissue of new permanent membership. The President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session worked\r\nhard to advance the discussion, but the Open-ended\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nWorking Group effectively remains deadlocked. There\r\nis no realistic prospect that the Working Group on its\r\nown can achieve agreement. We will not rehearse here\r\nthe arguments in favour of a larger, and therefore more\r\nlegitimate, Council. Our countries have individually set\r\nout our national positions on Security Council reform\r\non a number of occasions, most recently in statements\r\nduring the general debate.\r\nAustralia, Canada and New Zealand hope that a\r\nproposal of the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change will provide a basis for a\r\nsuccessful negotiation on a more representative\r\nCouncil. The Panel has been asked by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to provide independent recommendations on\r\nthat and other key issues facing the United Nations. We\r\nurge Member States not to seek to pre-empt the Panel’s\r\nreport, but rather to respect the Panel’s independence\r\nand keep an open mind on possible ways forward.\r\nAustralia, Canada and New Zealand are prepared\r\nto be flexible. We agree that reform must involve an\r\nincrease in non-permanent membership and that there\r\ncan be no extension of the veto. We look to enhanced\r\nopportunities for Security Council membership for all\r\nMember States, not just a privileged few.\r\nWe recognize how important Council reform is to\r\nMember States. We also share concerns that deep-\r\nseated differences on that matter not hold up a package\r\nof reforms aimed at strengthening the United Nations\r\nand enhancing its ability effectively to meet current\r\nand future challenges. But that does not mean that we\r\nthink this issue should be considered separately. First,\r\nincluding Security Council reform within a broader\r\npackage may increase rather than decrease the\r\nprospects of achieving consensus on it. Secondly, the\r\nSecurity Council is at the core of the United Nations\r\nresponse to threats to international security. At the\r\nsame time, the Council has expanded the range of\r\nissues that it determines constitute threats.\r\nAccordingly, proposals for enhancing collective action\r\nin dealing with a broad spectrum of threats cannot\r\nsensibly be separated from the issue of the\r\nrepresentativeness of the Council. What the Council\r\ndoes, and who is on it, are inextricably linked.\r\nAs important as the structure of the Council may\r\nbe, what is no less critical is the manner in which it\r\nrepresents the interests of the global community in\r\nwhose name it speaks and acts. It is a community\r\ncomprising individual human beings as well as States.\r\nAccordingly the Council’s primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of peace and security must, as the\r\nCouncil has recognized incrementally, include the\r\nsecurity of individual human beings as well as nations.\r\nIn that context, we welcome references, such as that in\r\nresolution 1564 (2004), underlining that a Government\r\nbears the primary responsibility to protect its\r\npopulation within its territory. We would add, however,\r\nthat the Council cannot ignore its obligations if the\r\nactions of a State violate that responsibility. What we\r\nseek is the evolution of international law and practice\r\nso that multilateral action may be taken in situations of\r\nextreme humanitarian emergency.\r\nIt is worth remembering that membership in the\r\nSecurity Council is not the only way to influence, and\r\nbroaden the basis of, Council decisions. We should\r\nconsider further changes in the operation and practices\r\nof the Council to allow non-members to make greater\r\ninput to Council deliberations. There has been some\r\nprogress with respect to peacekeeping issues in that\r\nregard. Consultation, however, must be meaningful.\r\nWe should also look more closely at the relationship\r\nbetween the Council and other bodies of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThis leads us to a final point. We have noted that\r\nthe Council’s agenda is busier than ever. The Council\r\nfocuses on acute threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity. But there is a need for better arrangements to\r\nprovide more effective and coordinated United Nations\r\noversight of international peace-building efforts in\r\npost-conflict situations over the longer term. That\r\noversight would need to involve a wide range of\r\nplayers. We look forward to future discussion on that\r\nand related issues once the Secretary-General’s High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change has\r\nreported at the end of this year.\r\nMr. De Rivero (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nSecurity Council today is undoubtedly the United\r\nNations body that has most increased its power. It now\r\nhas 17 peacekeeping operations under way, of which 11\r\nwere established since 1991. Those peacekeeping\r\noperations currently have a dominant impact on the\r\nOrganization’s budget. The number of Security Council\r\nresolutions has risen from 646, during its first 44 years\r\nof existence, to over 1,000 today. Similarly, the\r\nCouncil’s area of competence includes not only\r\ninternational conflicts but also civil disputes, nation-\r\nbuilding, terrorism, the non-proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction and other topics such as women and\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nchildren in conflict situations, the protection of\r\ncivilians in armed conflict and small arms and light\r\nweapons. Given the current importance of the Council,\r\nin my statement I will first take up the character of\r\nSecurity Council reports to the General Assembly\r\nbefore turning to the Council’s working methods and,\r\nlastly, the issue of equitable representation.\r\nWith regard to the Security Council’s reports to\r\nthe General Assembly, Peru appreciates the efforts\r\nmade to improve the character of the introductions of\r\nthose documents. Nevertheless, the report of the\r\nSecurity Council continues to be descriptive in nature\r\nand contains only a chronological account of the\r\nmeasures taken by the Council. It does not assess\r\ndifficulties, progress, setbacks or current trends in\r\nresolving the conflicts posing a threat to international\r\npeace and security. If the report of the Security Council\r\nis not analytical in nature, as that of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is, no one can know whether or not the\r\nsecurity conditions in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo have changed since the adoption of resolution\r\n1565 (2004). Nor can we know, for example, the\r\nimpact of the enormous quantity of drugs produced in\r\nAfghanistan on the national reconstruction process in\r\nthat country. Likewise, it is impossible to know\r\nwhether or not the current insecurity in Iraq has an\r\neffect on the possibility of providing United Nations\r\nelectoral assistance in accordance with resolution 1546\r\n(2004). We know even less about whether or not the\r\ntrials in the International Criminal Tribunals for\r\nRwanda and the former Yugoslavia have contributed to\r\nreducing impunity in the world.\r\nIf the report of the Security Council were read\r\ntoday by journalists, students of international relations\r\nor the public at large, none of them would get an\r\nassessment of the progress, setbacks or trends in the\r\nconflicts threatening peace and security in the world. It\r\nis therefore necessary to produce a Security Council\r\nreport that has the virtue of being understood by\r\ninternational public opinion in order that it may be\r\ndisseminated by the press and discussed in\r\ninternational academic circles, as are the analytical\r\nreports on human development, the World Bank’s\r\nreports on development and the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, all of which are known throughout the world.\r\nBut, today, it is no exaggeration to say that no one but\r\nus is aware of the report of the Security Council.\r\nWe therefore need a report that connects the\r\nSecurity Council not just to the General Assembly but\r\nalso to all of humankind. That would make it possible\r\nfor the Security Council’s peace efforts, and their\r\nlimits, to be known. All of that would provide a sense\r\nof reality and help to dispel the bad impressions that\r\narise with regard to the work of the United Nations in\r\ninstances when the Council does not quickly resolve a\r\nconflict threatening international peace and security.\r\nI should now like to turn to the second subject of\r\nmy statement, namely, the working methods of the\r\nCouncil. We should today recognize that the Council\r\nhas been reacting better to new and complex crises,\r\nmaking it possible for States that are not members of\r\nthe Council and members of international civil society\r\nto participate. Among the Council’s most valuable\r\nmethods of work today is the practice of carrying out\r\nvisits to the field, above all in order to obtain a real\r\nunderstanding of civil conflicts. Those visits should be\r\nimproved by enabling the Council to establish good\r\nconnections with civil society, as well as with local,\r\npolitical and religious groups in countries in conflict.\r\nThe Council should also seek to connect with officials\r\nof the United Nations Development Programme, the\r\nWorld Bank and regional organizations familiar with\r\nthe socio-political situation in the country in conflict\r\nbeing visited. Those visits should also be proactive in\r\nnature. They should not only be held once a conflict\r\nhas broken out, but also when there is information\r\nindicating that there is a threat of civil war or of\r\nmassive violations of human rights.\r\nThe Council must not continue to react simply to\r\nspecific events in civil conflicts. It must instead carry\r\nout an in-depth analysis of the structural causes of\r\nthose conflicts. Today, for example, all recent strategic\r\nanalyses agree that social exclusion is the main factor\r\nthat turns political, ethnic and religious rivalries into\r\nintense civil conflicts, which, in turn lead to real wars\r\nof national depredation, in which the most heinous\r\ncrimes against humanity are committed. For that\r\nreason, the Council’s field visits should be properly\r\nprepared, above all to gather information about the\r\ndegree of social exclusion in the country visited. If\r\naccount is not taken of social exclusion in order to\r\nresolve and prevent conflicts, we would be ignoring the\r\nmost important structural component of international\r\nviolence.\r\nWe believe that multilateralism cannot be\r\ndivorced from reality. It is in that context that I would\r\nlike to conclude by addressing the issue of equitable\r\nrepresentation in the Security Council. For 10 years\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nnow, all countries concerned have been putting forth\r\ntheir positions with regard to expanding the\r\nmembership of the Security Council, but with no\r\nresults. The most recent report of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the subject illustrates the fact that\r\nthere are as many positions as there are countries. It is\r\nclear that there is no consensus; and without consensus\r\nthere can be no reform. It is as simple as that. We must\r\nbe realistic, given the situation. The lesson of 10 years\r\nof Council reform is that the more we debate reform,\r\nthe more points of disagreement we express.\r\nFor example, at the moment there is not even\r\nconsensus on the definition of what constitutes a\r\nregional group. Nor is there consensus about the\r\ncriteria for membership of the Security Council. The\r\npath that reform is taking is a sterile one that satisfies\r\nno one. In terms of realpolitik, the only thing clear in\r\nthe entire 10-year exercise is that no reform process\r\ncan be carried out without a minimum level of\r\ncommitment among the five permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council. That means that, for the reform\r\nexercise to cease being sterile, the permanent members\r\nof the Security Council need to make a joint effort to\r\narrive at a basic level of agreement as to what they\r\nconsider to be viable Council reform. We must start\r\nwith at least a minimally acceptable formula that is\r\nveto-proof. If such a compromise is not possible, then,\r\nin the final analysis, we will have to be realistic and\r\nabandon the reform. What we cannot do is to continue\r\nas we have been with a sterile exercise that goes on for\r\nyears, because that can bring discredit to the United\r\nNations.\r\nAll of the thoughts I have shared in order to\r\nimprove the report, working methods and reform\r\nprocess of the Security Council are a reflection of\r\nPeru’s commitment to the effectiveness of the Security\r\nCouncil — and hence our desire to be elected by the\r\nGeneral Assembly next year as a non-permanent\r\nmember of the Council, so that we may continue to\r\nmake suggestions and contributions to improve the\r\nfunctioning of the Council.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): I would\r\nlike very sincerely to thank Ambassador Sir Emyr\r\nJones Parry for his excellent presentation of the report\r\nof the Security Council to the General Assembly\r\n(A/59/2). We have always believed that the Assembly’s\r\nconsideration of the Security Council’s report should\r\nnot be a mere formality and that it should provide the\r\nGeneral Assembly with a valuable opportunity for an\r\nin-depth analysis of the Council’s activities, as well as\r\nto identify the measures that should be taken to make\r\nthe necessary improvements in the working methods of\r\nthat important body. That interaction is also in the very\r\ninterests of the Security Council, which should benefit\r\nfrom it by considering and using the ideas and\r\nconstructive and innovative proposals that I am\r\nconvinced will emerge from this debate. As is its\r\nprerogative, the Assembly could even take any action it\r\nconsiders appropriate at the end of this debate.\r\nWith regard to format, I am pleased that the\r\nreport now contains an analytical section on the work\r\nof the Council in order to respond extensively to the\r\ncomments and criticisms made in that regard by\r\nMember States throughout the years in this forum. The\r\ndocument before us indeed contains elements that are\r\nof interest to all Members of the United Nations.\r\nIn preparing the annual report this year, we the\r\nmembers of the Security Council set ourselves the goal\r\nof ensuring the best possible understanding of the\r\nissues before the Council. However, we are aware of\r\nthe fact that the report is still far from being the\r\nsubstantive document that members of the United\r\nNations need to assess the work of the Council. Algeria\r\nwill continue to work with other members of the\r\nCouncil to see to it that, in the future, the analytical\r\npart of the report provides indicators of the results of\r\nthe Council’s work, as well as a section devoted to\r\nproposals aimed at improving its work. Since Algeria\r\njoined the Security Council we have worked actively to\r\nbring about both greater transparency in the Council’s\r\nworking methods and further democratization in its\r\ndecision-making process.\r\nWith regard to the functioning of the Council, it\r\nshould be said that a significant number of Council\r\nmembers made efforts during the period under\r\nconsideration to improve both exchanges with all\r\nmembers of the United Nations and the transparency of\r\nthat body’s working methods. In order to limit the\r\nsecrecy in the Council’s work, a concerted effort was\r\nmade to improve the dissemination of information\r\nabout the activities of the Council and to hold more\r\nopen briefings in order that non-members of the\r\nCouncil can benefit from the information provided by\r\nthe Secretariat on various situations and conflicts and\r\nexpress their opinions on the decisions taken.\r\nHowever, Algeria continues to believe that it\r\nwould be wise, on a case-by-case basis, for the\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nconsultations preceding those meetings to be open to\r\nparties interested or involved in the question under\r\nconsideration in order to obtain their views. That\r\nwould allow the Security Council to have a better\r\nunderstanding of the subjects under consideration and\r\nto take its decisions with better background\r\ninformation at hand. It is also important to relaunch the\r\nholding of wrap-up meetings open to non-members of\r\nthe Council, even if only on a quarterly basis. We\r\nbelieve those meetings provide an opportunity to\r\nexpress views on issues of interest in an analytical,\r\nsystematic, open and frank way.\r\nDuring the negotiation of important\r\nresolutions — such as resolution 1540 (2004), on non-\r\nproliferation — Algeria had an opportunity to express\r\nstrong reservations about the trend of the Council to\r\nbecome an international legislator and to replace the\r\nintergovernmental negotiating process. The Council\r\nshould only adopt temporary rules to be imposed on all\r\nStates in exceptional circumstances, such as to respond\r\nto situations that dangerously imperil international\r\npeace and security or in the absence of legal standards.\r\nAlong with other members of the Council, my country\r\nhas also expressed concern about the ease with which\r\nthe Security Council now resorts to Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter, including in situations where it is not\r\nappropriate to do so.\r\nWith regard to substance, the report illustrates\r\nthat, in the period under consideration, the Council has\r\nnot only reacted to threats to international and regional\r\npeace and security, but has sometimes also taken direct\r\naction to address the large number of problems\r\naffecting the world. It has demonstrated determination\r\nand follow-up in dealing with certain issues. We\r\nbelieve that Security Council missions to areas in\r\nconflict or emerging from it, such as last June’s\r\nmission to West Africa, have been extremely useful,\r\nbecause they have tackled the heart of the problems\r\nand enjoyed the support and cooperation of the parties\r\nconcerned. Those missions have had a positive impact\r\non local actors. Given such successful experiences, we\r\nencourage this type of initiative and action and call for\r\nthem to be formalized and expanded to other conflict\r\nareas.\r\nHowever, we would like to point out that in\r\nsituations that were not a threat to international peace\r\nand security, the Security Council went beyond its\r\nmandate and acted inappropriately, as it did on\r\n2 September 2004 when it adopted resolution 1559\r\n(2004) on the situation in Lebanon. At the same time,\r\nwe noted with regret that, although action needed to be\r\ntaken to stop a bloodbath in the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritories, the Security Council was, to say the least,\r\nhesitant, and did not display the necessary firmness and\r\ndetermination. More serious yet, we saw an implicit\r\nendorsement by some Member States of non-respect\r\nfor resolutions. That certainly compromised the\r\nCouncil’s authority. In that regard, we regret the fact\r\nthat certain important Security Council resolutions\r\nhave remained dead letters and have not been followed\r\nby action. That state of affairs often encouraged the\r\nrecalcitrant party vis-à-vis the settlement of a conflict\r\nin a given situation to continue to defy the Council’s\r\nwill and to attack its credibility.\r\nWith regard to the Middle East, where the\r\nCouncil has a great responsibility, despite the adoption\r\nof many resolutions and a monthly meeting devoted to\r\nthe subject, the Council was not able to make any\r\nnotable progress to encourage or facilitate the peace\r\nprocess, or even to ensure the protection of the\r\nPalestinian population of the occupied territories. The\r\ncase of the non-adoption of the recent draft resolution\r\non Israel’s deadly operation against the Palestinian\r\npopulation in Gaza, which I put forward a few days\r\nago, was the twenty-ninth instance of the Council\r\nbeing paralysed by a veto and illustrates the\r\npowerlessness of the Security Council in discharging\r\nits responsibilities. We are convinced that, had the\r\nCouncil shown the necessary firmness with regard to\r\nIsrael, the violence could have been largely avoided\r\nand the situation today would undoubtedly have been\r\nmore conducive to a negotiated settlement.\r\nIt is therefore the very credibility of the Security\r\nCouncil that is in question today. That credibility will\r\nonly be eroded further if the Council does not succeed\r\nin reversing that trend and demonstrating to the entire\r\nworld its capacity to shoulder its responsibilities in the\r\nmanagement and settlement of some of the disputes\r\nthat have been on its agenda for quite some time. In\r\nthat regard, the Council should have a comprehensive\r\npolicy based on equity and justice. It should adopt a\r\nclear and coherent approach vis-à-vis the issues\r\nconferred upon it by the Charter, and in particular with\r\nregard to those that pertain to international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nI must point out that, in the course of its work\r\nduring the fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly, the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters Related to the Security Council employed a\r\nnew methodology to consider the issues entrusted to it\r\nby its mandate. The members of the Group gave\r\nthemselves the authority to hold substantive debates,\r\neven during consultations. That is contrary to the usual\r\nworking method, which entailed assigning questions to\r\ntwo separate groups, one which dealt with issues\r\npertaining to Council expansion and related issues, and\r\nthe other which took up matters having to do with\r\nworking methods and transparency.\r\nThanks to the leadership of Mr. Julian Hunte, the\r\nWorking Group has been innovative in identifying\r\ncertain important questions, including those having to\r\ndo with regional representation, the conditions to be\r\nmet for membership in the Security Council, the\r\nresponsibility of the Council and the relationship\r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil, including improving the quality of the annual\r\nreport now before us as well as the Council’s special\r\nreports to the Assembly. That change in methodology\r\nhas undoubtedly reanimated somewhat the discussions\r\nin the Working Group. But the overall prospects remain\r\nuncertain because of the ongoing impasse on\r\nsubstantive questions relating to Security Council\r\nreform.\r\nThe general debate during the current session has\r\nonce again revealed that many delegations have\r\nreaffirmed their commitment to Council reform as a\r\nvital element in the overall reform of the United\r\nNations. They have called for the expansion of the\r\nCouncil in order to enhance its representative\r\ncharacter, thereby strengthening its legitimacy and\r\nauthority. The debate has also highlighted the call of\r\nsome delegations for a permanent seat in an enlarged\r\nSecurity Council. That rise in interest in the reform of\r\nthe Council and the activism of some in that respect\r\ncan be explained in part by the fact that the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change is to submit\r\nits report to the Secretary-General at the beginning of\r\nDecember and the fact that the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendations in that regard could include\r\nreferences to the reform of the Security Council.\r\nSome believe that the issue of United Nations\r\nreform in general, and of the Security Council in\r\nparticular, will evolve positively in the wake of the\r\nsixtieth anniversary of the establishment of the United\r\nNations. That is the hope of us all. We would also hope\r\nthat such a development will remedy the current\r\ninjustice by taking into account the interests of\r\ndeveloping countries, especially those in Africa. My\r\ndelegation is prepared to consider any proposal that\r\nwill contribute to progress in our deliberations, so long\r\nas those proposals promote, through rotation, the\r\nbroadest possible participation in the work of the\r\nSecurity Council. Nevertheless, we consider it essential\r\nthat any plan to reform the Council not be divisive. On\r\nthe contrary, such a programme should rally the\r\nbroadest possible support from the General Assembly\r\nand should be part of the comprehensive reform of the\r\nUnited Nations, whose main bodies — and the\r\nrelations between them — must be transformed in\r\nsignificant ways.\r\nLastly, regions must be permitted to decide how\r\nthey wish to be represented in the Security Council. In\r\nthat context, we would like to reaffirm our commitment\r\nto the concrete proposals regarding substantive issues\r\nmade by members of the Non-Aligned Movement, in\r\nparticular those pertaining to the expansion in the\r\nmembership of the Council. All those proposals reflect\r\na desire to strengthen the representative character and\r\neffectiveness of that important body. I also want to\r\nemphasize that any expansion in the composition of the\r\nSecurity Council must take into account Africa’s\r\nclaims — as set out at the Organization of African\r\nUnity summit held in Harare in 1997 and often\r\nexpressed by my own and many other African\r\ndelegations — to allocate to Africa at least two\r\npermanent, rotating seats and two additional non-\r\npermanent seats.\r\nMr. Dapkiunas (Belarus) (spoke in Russian):\r\nThe Republic of Belarus takes note of the increased\r\nactivities of the Security Council during the past year\r\nin the area of the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. We favour maintaining the momentum in\r\nimproving the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil. We also favour more openness in the\r\nCouncil’s work and more intensive interaction between\r\nit and the General Assembly.\r\nBelarus deems it necessary to continue the\r\npractice of holding open meetings of the Council at the\r\nministerial level on the more serious problems facing\r\nthe international community. In so doing, it is\r\nimportant that the Security Council act strictly within\r\nits area of competence and without impinging on the\r\nareas of responsibility of other principal bodies of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nThere has been a significant increase in the\r\nactivities of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. We\r\nbelieve that Committee should become an effective\r\ntool in combating international terrorism, strengthening\r\nthe counter-terrorist coalition under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations and monitoring compliance with the\r\nrequirements of resolution 1373 (2001). Direct\r\ninteraction between the Committee and regional\r\norganizations could certainly help carry out those\r\ntasks.\r\nWe are convinced of the need to strengthen the\r\nkey role of the Council in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Actions that\r\ncircumvent the authority of the Council jeopardize the\r\nvery foundation of international law and order. The\r\nrole of the Council determines the importance of the\r\nactivities of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters Related to the Security Council.\r\nBelarus supports the continued active use by the\r\nPresident of the current session of the General\r\nAssembly of the practice of consulting with regional\r\ngroups of States to reform the membership and\r\nactivities of the Security Council. Belarus shares the\r\nview that the reform of the Security Council cannot be\r\nreduced solely to changing the membership of the\r\nCouncil. We need to review the overall approach to\r\nassessing threats, as well as the way by which\r\ndecisions are taken on effective ways to respond to\r\nthem.\r\nBelarus looks forward to the important\r\ncontribution to be made by the High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change in drafting\r\nrecommendations on this matter. We would also like to\r\ndraw the Assembly’s attention to the primary\r\nindividual responsibility of all Member States to\r\nchoose the best option for reforming the membership\r\nand the work of the Security Council. We also wish to\r\nstress the special role played in that process by the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nA generally acceptable formula for the expansion\r\nof the Security Council should be based on the\r\nelimination of the imbalance between the membership\r\nof the Council and that of the Organization, the\r\nprinciple of equitable geographical distribution in the\r\nallocation of seats and the prevention of new divisions\r\non this issue among Member States.\r\nWe agree with the view of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement that the membership of the Council should\r\nbe expanded by 11 seats on a consensus basis.\r\nIncreasing the number of non-permanent members\r\nshould take into account the interests of all regional\r\ngroups. We think it just and necessary that an\r\nadditional seat be allocated to the Group of the Eastern\r\nEuropean States.\r\nWith regard to the category of permanent\r\nmembers, additional seats should be allocated to the\r\ncountries of the three developing regions of Asia,\r\nAfrica and Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as\r\nto two developed States, from Europe and from Asia,\r\nthat have made the most tangible contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of international security.\r\nSuccessful reform of the Council will give great\r\nimpetus to the work of the Organization and enhance\r\nits international authority. Failure to reform the\r\nSecurity Council would engender doubt as to the\r\nOrganization’s ability to transform itself in face of\r\ncontemporary challenges. We must not allow that to\r\nhappen. Belarus believes that only constructive\r\ninteraction — taking into account the views of\r\ncountries large and small, rich and poor — will make it\r\npossible to create a more authoritative, representative\r\nand effective Security Council. Our delegation is\r\nprepared to engage in that kind of cooperation.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): My delegation\r\nappreciates the fact that we are jointly debating two\r\nimportant reports, namely, the report of the Security\r\nCouncil on its work over the past year (A/59/2) and the\r\nreport of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters Related to the Security Council (A/58/47).\r\nAlso, this debate comes at a time when the threats\r\nassociated with the current international security\r\nenvironment have exacerbated the difficulties\r\nconfronting the Security Council. Those threats include\r\ninternational terrorism, weapons of mass destruction,\r\nthe consequences of the war in Iraq and crises such as\r\nthose in the Middle East and Darfur. The debate also\r\ncomes at a time when there is an increased sense of\r\nurgency about the need to reform and expand the\r\nSecurity Council to reflect the new international\r\nenvironment, so as to allow it to better deal with those\r\nthreats.\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nThere is no doubt that the Security Council has\r\nbecome the most active organ of the United Nations.\r\nThe weakening of both the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly has placed special\r\nemphasis on the work of the Security Council. Quite\r\noften, people outside these walls have mistaken the\r\nSecurity Council for the sum total of the United\r\nNations. That is unfortunate and must be corrected for\r\nthe sake of the entire United Nations.\r\nIn the past year we have also noticed that the\r\nSecurity Council has adopted some measures aimed at\r\nimproving its working methods. Those improvements\r\nwould be significant if they were permanent. But as\r\nlong as the rules of procedure of the Council remain\r\nprovisional, changes in the working methods of the\r\nCouncil, no matter how positive, will always seem\r\ninadequate.\r\nNonetheless, we are pleased that, over the past\r\nyear, the Council has demonstrated an increased\r\nwillingness to cooperate with other organs of the\r\nUnited Nations, such as the General Assembly and\r\nEconomic and Social Council. The closer cooperation\r\nbetween the Economic and Social Council and the\r\nSecurity Council in assisting African countries that\r\nhave emerged from conflict is much welcomed.\r\nSpecifically, we wish to highlight the cooperation\r\nbetween the Security Council and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council’s Ad Hoc Advisory Groups on Guinea-\r\nBissau and Burundi as a good example of that closer\r\nworking relationship between principal organs. In that\r\ncontext, we wish to pay tribute to Ambassador Emyr\r\nJones Parry of the United Kingdom, who made\r\npossible a joint visit to Guinea-Bissau earlier this year.\r\nThe impact of having representatives both of the\r\nSecurity Council and of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil reporting jointly on a country in dire need\r\ncannot be underestimated.\r\nWhile the Council has been able to address some\r\nof the threats that confront us, we remain concerned at\r\nits inability to demonstrate the requisite political will\r\nand a commitment to effective decision-making, which\r\nhave prevented it from being able to address other\r\npressing challenges.\r\nWe also remain concerned that the Council is still\r\nunable to take a definitive decision on the conflict in\r\nthe Middle East. The Council will soon have to\r\ntranscend the division among its own members and\r\nspeak with one voice on that tragic situation, or face\r\nthe erosion of its credibility as an organ mandated to\r\nmaintain international peace and security.\r\nIn recent months we have seen the Security\r\nCouncil debate a number of resolutions that would\r\nappear to reinterpret treaty obligations or to impose\r\nlegislative demands on Member States. We believe that\r\nthat demonstrates an unwelcome tendency by the\r\nSecurity Council to encroach on the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The General Assembly is the only\r\ndemocratic and fully representative international organ\r\nof the United Nations that has the unique ability to\r\nforge genuine international consensus on sensitive\r\nissues such as terrorism. Working through the General\r\nAssembly is the way to ensure that multilateralism\r\nprotects weak States from being overwhelmed by\r\npowerful ones.\r\nOn matters of international peace and security,\r\nthe Security Council is increasingly relying on regional\r\norganizations to take the lead in resolving conflicts.\r\nRegional organizations are increasingly becoming\r\nessential building blocks in the global security system.\r\nFor the effective functioning of the United Nations\r\nsystem, it is important for the Organization and its\r\nagencies to be able to delegate responsibilities and to\r\nprovide, where required, the necessary resources to\r\nregional organizations that are better placed to deal\r\nwith peace and security challenges in their respective\r\nregions.\r\nIn that regard, Chapter VIII of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations envisages situations in which the\r\nSecurity Council may utilize regional organizations by\r\nvirtue of their proximity to, and knowledge of, a\r\nparticular conflict. Regional organizations are well\r\nplaced to intervene sooner than the Security Council\r\nprocess would allow. For instance, the African Union\r\nhas been first in assisting the people of Burundi and\r\nDarfur. The African Union has already taken it upon\r\nitself to become involved in resolving conflict\r\nsituations in spite of the lack of resources and logistical\r\nand material support. My delegation believes that the\r\nSecurity Council may soon have to define in clear\r\nterms how it can utilize regional organizations that are\r\nready to assist in making the world a safer place. As it\r\nis, it has become quite noticeable, for example, that the\r\ninternational community has asked the African Union\r\nto expand its involvement in Darfur. Yet that request\r\nhas not been accompanied by an announcement of\r\nresources that the international community is willing to\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nmake available to the African Union to take on that\r\nresponsibility.\r\nThere has been dramatic progress in the matter of\r\nthe reform and expansion of the Security Council. In\r\nits resolution 48/26, of 1993, the General Assembly\r\nestablished the Open-ended Working Group to consider\r\nall aspects of the question of an increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and other matters\r\nrelated to the Council. The Working Group was\r\nestablished because Member States recognized the\r\nneed to address the eroding credibility and lack of\r\nrepresentational equity in the Security Council. The\r\nWorking Group was to examine formulas to increase\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and make it\r\nrelevant to the needs of the twenty-first century.\r\nWhile we appreciate the efforts of Mr. Julian\r\nHunte, President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\neighth session, to revitalize the work of the Open-\r\nended Working Group, it is disappointing that the\r\nWorking Group has remained deadlocked since it was\r\nestablished, particularly on the vital issue of enlarging\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nIn September 2000, the Millennium Summit\r\nreiterated the need for Security Council reform and\r\ncalled on Member States to intensify their efforts to\r\nachieve comprehensive reform of the United Nations.\r\nIn September 2003, the Secretary-General\r\nannounced the formation of the High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change. South Africa was\r\namong those that welcomed the Panel, because we\r\nanticipated that it would give more momentum to the\r\ndebate on the reform of the United Nations.\r\nIn September 2004, during the general debate at\r\nthe fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly, an\r\noverwhelming number of delegations pronounced\r\nthemselves to be in support of reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. Nearly half of the membership of the\r\nOrganization specifically called for an expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council in both the permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories. South Africa supports the\r\nexpansion of the Security Council’s membership in\r\nboth categories. As the Assembly is aware, President\r\nThabo Mbeki has announced from South Africa that\r\nmy country is ready to serve as a permanent member of\r\na restructured and expanded Security Council.\r\nRecently, our Cabinet reaffirmed South Africa’s\r\navailability to serve on a restructured Security Council\r\nand emphasized that the offer would be pursued in\r\ncooperation, rather than in competition, with other\r\ncountries of the continent.\r\nIncreased political will at the highest levels of\r\nGovernment to address the reform and enlargement of\r\nthe Security Council has increased the sense of\r\nurgency, and it is understood that the time is now ripe\r\nto take action on the expansion and reform of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe report of the High-level Panel will be out on\r\n1 December 2004. We hope that delegations will give\r\nthe Panel’s report full consideration, and not just focus\r\non the section regarding Security Council reform. We\r\nalso hope that they will address development issues as\r\nwell. We believe that other development issues, such as\r\npeace-building and providing support for States under\r\nstress, require urgent attention from the international\r\ncommunity. That is the least the people of the world\r\nexpect from us.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): My delegation extends\r\nits appreciation and thanks to the President of the\r\nSecurity Council for the month of October for\r\nintroducing the report (A/59/2) of the Security Council\r\nto the General Assembly. The report covers a wide\r\nrange of activities, and I wish to highlight some of\r\nthem.\r\nWe are pleased to see general improvement in the\r\nsubregion of West Africa, and we hope it will translate\r\ninto lasting peace for the countries directly affected,\r\nand for the African continent as a whole.\r\nAs a country contributing troops to the United\r\nNations Mission in Liberia, we are pleased to see that\r\nsignificant progress on the disarmament and\r\ndemobilization of ex-combatants is being attributed to\r\nthe deployment of the United Nations Mission. It is our\r\nsincere hope that peace will return to Liberia and that\r\nthe country will embark on sustainable development.\r\nWith regard to Sierra Leone, we agree with the\r\ndecision of the Security Council to readjust the\r\ntimetable for the drawdown of the United Nations\r\nMission in Sierra Leone until the country is in a\r\nposition to assume primary responsibility for internal\r\nsecurity.\r\nOn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we\r\nremain seriously perturbed by the continued violence\r\nin the eastern part of the country. Our persistent\r\ndemand to strengthen the United Nations Organization\r\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\n(MONUC) with a robust mandate is dictated by reality\r\non the ground, which in turn emanates from the\r\nvastness of the country and the continued violence in\r\nthe east. While welcome, resolution 1565 (2004),\r\nwhich was adopted recently by the Security Council to\r\nincrease the strength of MONUC, is not even near to\r\nbeing proportionate to the task at hand.\r\nPeace in the region is of paramount importance\r\nfor us in the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC). It is for that reason that SADC\r\nMinisters, at a meeting in Lusaka of SADC’s Organ on\r\nPolitics, Defence and Security, reaffirmed SADC’s\r\ncollective undertaking to safeguard the security and\r\npolitical stability of the region within the framework of\r\nthe Protocol on Politics, Defence and Security\r\nCooperation and the Mutual Defence Pact.\r\nThe Transitional Government of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo must be given all support and\r\nassistance to anchor the peace. Interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo must cease, and the Congolese people must\r\nfully benefit from their natural resources without\r\nplunder.\r\nA massive humanitarian crisis is unfolding in the\r\nDarfur region of the Sudan. Against that background,\r\nmy delegation reiterates its support for Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1564 (2004), which was adopted on\r\n18 September of this year. While we fully support the\r\nefforts of the African Union in that regard, we feel\r\nstrongly that the Security Council should assume full\r\nresponsibility, in accordance with the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe objective of the ceasefire in Western Sahara\r\nwas not to delay the realization of the right to self-\r\ndetermination of the people of Western Sahara. It was\r\nto create an environment conducive to the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations Settlement Plan,\r\nwhich was adopted by both the African Union and the\r\nUnited Nations and was agreed to by both parties. In\r\nour view, the Security Council has not exerted\r\nsufficient pressure to ensure that its resolutions on\r\nWestern Sahara are honoured. We call upon both\r\nparties, and especially the Government of Morocco, to\r\ncooperate with the United Nations to ensure the\r\nimplementation of the Settlement Plan. While we\r\nregret the resignation of Mr. James Baker, the Personal\r\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General, we hope that\r\neverything will be done to implement the Settlement\r\nPlan. With regard to the United Nations Mission for the\r\nReferendum in Western Sahara, we do not agree with\r\nthe proposal to reduce its size. The priority here should\r\nbe the implementation of the United Nations\r\nSettlement Plan.\r\nThe situation in the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritories is a challenge to the international\r\ncommunity. We support a comprehensive and just\r\nsettlement in Middle East and call for the full\r\nimplementation of the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions.\r\nOn the subject of peacekeeping, my delegation\r\ncan only reiterate the need to fully support\r\npeacekeeping missions through the provision of\r\nfinancial, material and political support, as urged in the\r\nreport of the Security Council.\r\nAny measures to sustain the unity of the\r\ninternational community against international terrorism\r\nmust be in accordance with the fundamental principles\r\nof international law and the law of treaties. We\r\nstrongly suggest that, if Member States are to\r\ncooperate fully in combating terrorism and effectively\r\nimplement the measures that have been adopted, they\r\nshould be involved in the formulation of measures to\r\ncombat it. The Security Council must not assume a\r\nlegislative function in the war on terror — a function\r\nnever allocated to it by the Charter of the United\r\nNations — by prescribing obligations that many States\r\nwill be unable to implement effectively, as they are\r\ninconsistent with the law of treaties. Such an exercise\r\nwould undoubtedly undermine the very noble efforts of\r\nthe international community to eliminate international\r\nterrorism.\r\nOn thematic issues, I wish to emphasize that,\r\nwhile taking into account the mandates of the various\r\nbodies of the United Nations, we believe that thematic\r\nissues add value to the deliberations of the Security\r\nCouncil. Having initiated the debate in the Security\r\nCouncil on the issue of women, peace and security, we\r\nare convinced that that debate and subsequent\r\ndecisions have shifted the Council’s focus from\r\nviewing women as mere victims of conflict to seeing\r\nwomen as indispensable contributors to peace-making\r\nand peacekeeping. In fact, women have today initiated\r\nsome successful peace processes in Africa. That must\r\nbe acknowledged, recognized and enhanced.\r\nResolution 1325 (2000) is not about gender equality in\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\ngeneral; it is about the role of women in making peace\r\nand keeping the peace.\r\nMember States have referred to the issue of\r\nCouncil reform every year during the general debate of\r\nthe General Assembly since the establishment of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council. However, there is\r\nspecial significance to this issue this year as a result of\r\nthe recommendations expected to be made by the High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, which\r\nwas appointed by the Secretary-General.\r\nFurthermore, from an African perspective, the\r\nestablishment of the African Union’s Peace and\r\nSecurity Council has given a new dimension to the\r\nrelationship between the Security Council and that\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn addition, we anticipate that the forthcoming\r\nreview of the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals will have a positive impact on the\r\nreform of the United Nations as whole.\r\nIt is from that perspective that my delegation is\r\nparticipating in this debate.\r\nDuring the fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly, the Chairman of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup presented us with a summary of the discussions\r\nin the Working Group. That summary gave us a valid\r\nand rich account of the views put forward by Member\r\nStates, which need to be further strengthened by the\r\nGeneral Assembly prior to being finalized.\r\nWith regard to criteria for membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, it must be stressed that size should\r\nnot be substituted for capacity, and that capacity must\r\nnot be narrowly defined in terms of material wealth. In\r\naddition, given the new era in which we live, it is\r\nimportant that the views of regional groups are taken\r\nfully into account.\r\nWith regard to increasing the membership of the\r\nCouncil, I wish to reiterate the decision of the African\r\nheads of State and Government set out in the Harare\r\nDeclaration, namely, that Africa deserves at least two\r\npermanent seats and five non-permanent seats on the\r\nCouncil. The permanent seats would rotate among\r\nAfrican Members States, and Africa would decide on\r\nits own the modality for rotation.\r\nThere is no doubt that the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil is a complex issue. Resolution 53/30 clearly\r\nlays out the circumstances under which a decision\r\nshould be taken on that issue, which first appeared as\r\nan item on the agenda of the General Assembly in\r\n1979.\r\nThe Chairman of the Open-ended Working Group\r\nhas clearly undertaken initiatives to stimulate a focused\r\ndiscussion on the aspects of, and issues related to, the\r\nreform of the Security Council. We commend his\r\nefforts. We are convinced that the work of the Working\r\nGroup dealing with this issue has produced some\r\nresults, and that useful suggestions have been made by\r\nMember States. While the task of the Chairman is to\r\nfacilitate deliberation, it is the responsibility of\r\nMember States to reach agreement.\r\nAll there is to be said about Security Council\r\nreform has been said. However, every action to be\r\ntaken to achieve the reform of the Security Council has\r\nnot been taken. The time has come for us to put an end\r\nto these perennial discussions. In that respect, my\r\ndelegation supports the view of the Chairman\r\ncontained in document A/58/57, namely, that the\r\nWorking Group should set a deadline for the\r\nconclusion of its work. In our view, the special event\r\nenvisaged for next year will provide an ideal\r\nopportunity for world leaders to make good on the\r\ndecision they took at the Millennium Summit to\r\nintensify their efforts to achieve comprehensive reform\r\nof the Security Council in all aspects. To that end, we\r\ncall on Member States to show political will in order to\r\nreach agreement on this important issue.\r\nMr. Al-Shamsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): At the outset, I have the pleasure, on behalf of\r\nthe delegation of the United Arab Emirates, to thank\r\nthe former Chairman and Vice-Chairpersons of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council for their remarkable\r\nefforts in leading the work of the Group during the\r\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I would\r\nalso like to take this opportunity to wish them every\r\nsuccess in carrying out that important task and in\r\nachieving general consensus among the Member States\r\non strengthening the role and effectiveness of the\r\nSecurity Council in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security.\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nThe annual inclusion of the item on the reform of\r\nthe Security Council on the agenda of the General\r\nAssembly reflects the paramount importance that the\r\ninternational community attaches to the issue of\r\nrestructuring the Security Council and increasing its\r\neffectiveness as an integral part of the process of\r\nrevitalizing and promoting the role of the United\r\nNations system in order to strengthen the ability of the\r\nOrganization to confront the challenges and\r\ndevelopments of the twenty-first century.\r\nDespite the in-depth consultations carried out by\r\nthe Working Group since it was established in 1993\r\nand the initiatives and proposals of regional groups,\r\nthere are still great differences with regard to the views\r\nand positions of Member States on this issue,\r\nespecially in connection with the issue of increasing\r\nthe membership of the Council and other related\r\nmatters, such as regional representation on the Council,\r\nthe criteria for the selection of permanent members and\r\nthe prerogatives and powers of new members.\r\nDifferences also exist with regard to the decision-\r\nmaking process, accountability and the necessary\r\nmeasures and procedures that should be used in\r\nregulating the use of the veto.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates would like to reaffirm\r\nits support for the position of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement on this matter. We note with satisfaction the\r\nprogress made in the past few years to improve the\r\nCouncil’s working methods. That progress has been\r\nreflected in the increase in the number of open plenary\r\nmeetings, which have given non-members of the\r\nCouncil an opportunity to participate in the Council’s\r\ndebates, as well as in the increase in the number of\r\npublic briefings held on matters of common concern to\r\nthe international community.\r\nHowever, the United Arab Emirates is deeply\r\nconcerned about the policy of double standards\r\nfollowed by the Security Council when it takes up\r\nissues of concern to Arabs pertaining to the Middle\r\nEast, such as the Palestinian question. That practice has\r\nimpaired the Council’s ability to discharge the\r\nresponsibilities entrusted to it. We urge the Council and\r\nits members to refrain from following such a policy,\r\nand to act in accordance with the principals of the\r\nCharter, relevant resolutions of international legitimacy\r\nand provisions of international humanitarian law.\r\nWe would also like to emphasize that the\r\nimbalance in the composition of the Council and the\r\nunequal distribution of powers and prerogatives among\r\nits members have greatly hindered the ability of the\r\nCouncil to address some of the most important items\r\non its agenda, specifically those pertaining to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. That\r\nhas led to prolonging those issues, with the\r\nconcomitant humanitarian disasters they entail. Our\r\ndeliberations on this item should therefore cover all\r\naspects of Security Council reform as an indivisible\r\npart of a comprehensive effort aimed at making the\r\nrole of the Council more effective and responsible at\r\nimproving democracy in its working methods so as to\r\nreflect the current political changes in international\r\nrelations.\r\nIn that connection, we would like to reiterate our\r\nsupport for the following proposals.\r\nFirst, we support an enlargement in the Council’s\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories of\r\nmembership. That enlargement should be proportionate\r\nand balanced and should have the approval of at least\r\ntwo thirds of the members of the General Assembly. It\r\nshould also be based on the principles of the sovereign\r\nequality of Member States and equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation, and should reflect the global character\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nSecondly, we believe that any future restructuring\r\nof the Security Council must address the problem of\r\nthe underrepresentation of developing countries so that\r\nthe imbalance in geographical representation can be\r\ncorrected and so that political balance in the Council\r\ncan be enhanced.\r\nThirdly, we believe that a permanent seat should\r\nbe allocated to the Group of Arab States. That seat\r\nwould be filled by Arab countries on a rotating basis,\r\nand in accordance with the practices endorsed by the\r\nLeague of Arab States in the framework of discussions\r\nwith both the Group of African States and the Group of\r\nAsian States.\r\nFourthly, in the event that agreement is reached\r\non increasing the number of permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council, we believe that those seats should go\r\nto countries that have truly demonstrated, in their\r\nrelationship with the United Nations, the ability to\r\ndischarge primary responsibility in such areas as the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, as\r\nwell as their capacity to fulfil the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter in the economic, social and\r\npolitical arenas.\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nFifthly, we think that priority should be given to\r\nestablishing checks and balances on the use of the veto,\r\nin order to ensure impartiality and objectivity in the\r\nSecurity Council’s decision-making process and in the\r\nexercise of its prerogatives and powers in addressing\r\npressing global issues that require urgent intervention\r\nto stem bloodshed and to protect civilians and their\r\nproperty in accordance with the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter and the 1949 Geneva\r\nConvention relative to the Protection of Civilian\r\nPersons in Time of War.\r\nSixthly, comprehensive, serious and objective\r\nperiodic assessment of the Council’s work must be\r\ncarried out in order to institutionalize the Council’s\r\nprocedures and working methods and to ensure its\r\nability to recognize the nature of the challenges it\r\nfaces. In that connection, we emphasize the importance\r\nof strengthening coordination and cooperation between\r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly, as\r\nwell as with regional organizations, in order to improve\r\nand strengthen the Council’s capacity to address\r\nexisting disputes and conflicts and to contain their\r\nserious implications for humankind.\r\nIn conclusion, we hope that our deliberations on\r\nthis item will lead to a common and practical\r\ninternational vision to carry out substantial and\r\npositive reform in the Security Council, including in its\r\ncomposition and membership, as well as to improve its\r\nworking methods in order to enable it to deal with the\r\nincreasing challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nMr. Gordon (Philippines): My delegation\r\nbelieves that there is merit in today’s joint debate on\r\ntwo interrelated agenda items, namely, on the report of\r\nthe Security Council to the General Assembly and on\r\nthe reform of the Security Council. The Philippines\r\nviews this joint debate as an opportunity for the\r\ngeneral membership of the United Nations to look\r\nmore closely at how the Security Council has been\r\nresponding meaningfully to the evolving international\r\npeace and security challenges posed by our ever-\r\nchanging world. It also provides an opportunity for\r\nmembers of the Council to listen to the views of the\r\ngeneral membership with regard to both the substantive\r\nand procedural conduct of its work. The Philippines\r\nand other members of the Security Council will benefit\r\nfrom the views of Member States on the two topics\r\nbefore us.\r\nThe report of the Security Council (A/59/2) is\r\nfactual. The introduction presents, in chronological\r\norder, the actions taken with respect to each specific\r\nissue dealt with by the Council. The annexes catalogue\r\nall the actions pursued over the period under review in\r\nthe performance of its primary role to preserve\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe task of analysing the effectiveness of the\r\nCouncil in the performance of its role can, in my\r\ndelegation’s view, best be made by the General\r\nAssembly, as the chief deliberative, policy-making and\r\nrepresentative body of the United Nations.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation once again calls for\r\nmore substantive consideration by the Assembly, not\r\nnecessarily of the entire Council report, but at least of\r\ncertain key issues addressed in it, in accordance with\r\nArticle 12 of the Charter of the United Nations. In\r\nconsultation with Member States, the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly may determine which issues should\r\nbe more intensively discussed. The issues could be\r\nregion- or country-specific, or could be any of the\r\ngeneral themes the Council has considered. My\r\ndelegation recommends that such discussions be\r\ncarried out in an informal and open-ended format,\r\neither as informal consultations or as round-table\r\nexercises. The objective of an informal setting is to\r\nachieve a more thorough analysis of the work of the\r\nCouncil, an assessment many delegations have been\r\nclamouring for. That call must be heeded, given the\r\nstatus of the Security Council as the most powerful\r\nbody entrusted with the responsibility to preserve\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nHer Excellency Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo,\r\nPresident of the Philippines, stated in her address to the\r\nAssembly last year (see A/58/PV.13) that the actions of\r\nthe Security Council in the pursuit of its primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and stability should be guided by the following\r\nprinciples: first, the principle of collective security,\r\nestablished under the Charter of the United Nations,\r\nshould be observed; secondly, the Security Council\r\nshould maintain and pursue a multilateral approach\r\ntowards the performance of its primary role; and\r\nthirdly, observing the rule of law is of paramount\r\nimportance in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nMy President did not offer those points as\r\nabsolute benchmarks. They can, however, serve as\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nguideposts in a substantive analysis of the Council’s\r\nwork. They represent critical areas for consideration in\r\nthe Assembly’s more intensive discussion of the\r\nCouncil’s work, which necessarily, but beneficially,\r\nentails more time being devoted to considering the\r\nCouncil’s report.\r\nThe conclusions stemming from these informal\r\ndiscussions and analysis could represent a valuable\r\ninput not only for the Council’s consideration but also\r\nwith respect to the next item we are considering\r\ntoday — the reform of the Security Council.\r\nThere is no question that reform of the Security\r\nCouncil is both important and urgent. It is important in\r\norder to ensure a balanced representation in the\r\nSecurity Council, and it is urgent because of the\r\nemergence of new and non-traditional threats to\r\ninternational peace and security requiring robust and\r\neffective responses on our part. Such responses require\r\nthat we be fast, which means reacting immediately to\r\ncertain issues that confront the world; that we be\r\nfriendly, intelligible and understandable to the world so\r\nthat it will be more supportive of the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations; that we be flexible, so that we can\r\nimmediately adapt to the changing, swirling tides of\r\ninternational affairs; and, most importantly, we must be\r\nforward-looking at all times, so that we can anticipate,\r\nprotect people from, and prevent any exploitation or\r\nharassment of, and violence against, peoples, as well as\r\nsafeguard their rights.\r\nThe need to reform the Council was formally\r\nrecognized over a decade ago, when the Assembly\r\nadopted resolution 48/26 creating the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group to address in detail the many aspects of\r\nSecurity Council reform. The emergence of new threats\r\nand challenges to international peace and security and\r\nshifting geopolitical realities have exerted even greater\r\npressure in that respect, making the need for reform\r\neven more urgent and imperative. Over 120 countries\r\ntook the floor during the Assembly’s general debate\r\nlast month calling for the Council’s reform.\r\nDuring its 10 years of work, the Working Group\r\nsucceeded in reaching general agreement on two\r\nissues — namely, the improvement of the Council’s\r\ndecision-making process, leading to the more open and\r\ntransparent conduct of its work; and the expansion of\r\nits membership. However, there is no agreement as yet\r\non the details of such an expansion in terms of size or\r\ncategory — that is, whether to increase the number of\r\nnon-permanent or permanent seats, or both.\r\nMy delegation believes that the key criterion in\r\nresolving the thorny issues of size and category is that\r\nof balanced representation, among other vital criteria.\r\nThis is a delicate and sensitive issue that has eluded\r\nany agreement, despite the variety of formulas put\r\nforward.\r\nIn that connection, my delegation would like once\r\nagain to invite the attention of the Assembly to three\r\nimportant points raised by the Secretary of Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of the Philippines when he\r\naddressed the Assembly during its general debate last\r\nmonth.\r\nFirst, the Philippines called for a holistic reform\r\nnot only of the Security Council but also of all other\r\nrelevant United Nations structures requiring a\r\nredefinition of their relationships and responsibilities\r\nin the security field. That call implies a radical reform\r\nalso of the Economic and Social Council and the\r\nstrengthening of the powers of the Secretary-General.\r\nPoverty and pandemic diseases such as AIDS, or\r\neven the flu, for instance, are not merely economic and\r\npublic health issues. They constitute threats to security,\r\nas they are breeding grounds for conflicts which fall\r\nbeyond the purview of the Security Council’s mandate.\r\nThe Secretary-General is supposed to be the executive\r\narm of the United Nations, entrusted with the execution\r\nof directives from its parliamentary organs.\r\nRegrettably, he lacks the requisite authority —\r\nespecially over the affiliated United Nations agencies,\r\nincluding the Bretton Woods institutions, run by their\r\nrespective governing boards — to exercise that\r\nexecutive power.\r\nThese examples underscore the need for a\r\ncomprehensive approach to reform in the response of\r\nthe United Nations to security challenges, as advocated\r\nby the Philippines.\r\nSecondly, reform of the United Nations should be\r\nbacked by a consensus on the promotion of collective\r\nownership, and Security Council reform should give\r\nconsideration to the views of the permanent members.\r\nWe should not, therefore, be polarized by narrow\r\nnational and group interests, but unified by upholding\r\nthe common or universal interest, if consensus is to be\r\nachieved. We should engage the permanent members of\r\nthe Security Council in constructive consultations on\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nthe Council’s reform in order to bring the process to\r\nfruition.\r\nThirdly, one of the important criteria in the\r\nselection of new permanent members in the Council is\r\nthe candidates’ contributions in the area of the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In that\r\nregard, a country such as Japan deserves to be\r\nconsidered for permanent membership.\r\nIt is my delegation’s view that, if these three\r\npoints are considered, it would greatly facilitate the\r\nreform of the Security Council as an integral element\r\nof the broader reform process of the United Nations\r\naimed at enabling it to more effectively respond to\r\nchallenges to international peace and security.\r\nHowever meritorious reform proposals are,\r\nincluding those that may be recommended by the High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, none\r\nmay ever be agreed upon if there is no political will to\r\nreach an acceptable compromise beneficial to the\r\ncommon good, especially on the sensitive issues\r\ninvolved in Security Council reform.\r\nThe task ahead is difficult, but, with the requisite\r\npolitical will, it will not be insurmountable.\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): The report of the Security\r\nCouncil tells us that, over the past 12 months, the pace\r\nof activities was intense as the Council addressed a\r\nwide range of issues. We were not given a detailed\r\nanalysis of the issues covered, but the report does give\r\nus an adequate descriptive account of the various\r\nmatters that were dealt with and the actions taken. The\r\nCouncil deserves commendation for having undertaken\r\nsuch a considerable volume of work, through\r\nconsultations, meetings and briefings, in a continuous\r\nround of activity. However, the overall record of\r\nachievement is mixed; there were positive outcomes,\r\nbut, in other areas, there was little progress, and even\r\nsome significant setbacks.\r\nIn Africa, there were three new peace missions\r\nauthorized, and overall substantial progress was\r\nachieved in peace-building efforts and in reducing\r\nsignificant areas of conflict. Although an exit strategy\r\nmust always be contemplated, it is important that the\r\nCouncil remain engaged to consolidate the gains made,\r\ncontinue the process of national reconciliation, and\r\nbuild the economic and social foundations for enduring\r\nstability.\r\nIn the Sudan, where the situation is still volatile,\r\nwhat is important is that the Council remain\r\nconstructively engaged, working with the Government\r\nof the Sudan and with the African Union to promote\r\npeace, stability and order and for the facilitation of\r\nhumanitarian relief.\r\nWith respect to the deterioration in the situation\r\nin Haiti in the early part of this year, the report tells us\r\nthat the Council reacted promptly and effectively. The\r\ndelegation of Jamaica disagrees with that assessment.\r\nThe fact is that the Council did not act promptly.\r\nThe Council initially failed to respond to the request of\r\nthe Haitian Government — which was supported by the\r\nCaribbean Community — and acted only in the wake\r\nof controversial political events which still have some\r\ntroubling implications. Despite that, Jamaica remains\r\nin full support of the operations of the United Nations\r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Beyond\r\nthe immediate tasks of restoration of order and national\r\nreconciliation, we reaffirm the crucial importance of\r\nlong-term social and economic development and of the\r\nfight against poverty in Haiti to sustain stability and\r\npeace.\r\nIn the Middle East, we see the pattern of recent\r\nyears. The Council has been unable to act to curtail the\r\nescalation of violence. Political realities restrict its\r\noptions and its ability to act with unity, authority and\r\nfirmness. It is more and more evident that the Quartet\r\nand its road map are not leading to a solution. A bolder\r\napproach is needed which constrains the parties to\r\nrespect the will of the international community for a\r\ncomprehensive settlement. In Iraq, an effective role for\r\nthe United Nations has proved difficult in the political\r\nevolution of events and in the face of a volatile\r\nsecurity situation. We have confidence that the\r\nSecretary-General remains ready to do what is possible\r\nin order to assist in rebuilding a stable environment\r\nand in restoring Iraq’s sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity.\r\nWith respect to counter-terrorism, we note the\r\nefforts at revitalization of the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee in monitoring the implementation of\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001). We believe it is also\r\nimportant that the Committee avoid being overly\r\nbureaucratic and inflexible in its operations and that it\r\nwork with States to assist in providing practical\r\nassistance where difficulties in implementation arise.\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nIn adopting its resolution 1540 (2004), the\r\nCouncil took a step which caused deep concern to\r\nmany delegations. We appreciate the fact that there\r\nwere some consultations with the broader membership\r\nand that there was no difficulty with the objective,\r\nnamely, preventing the acquisition of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction by terrorists and non-State entities.\r\nHowever, resolution 1540 (2004) was an unusual use\r\nof the Council’s powers under Chapter VII and has\r\nsome troubling implications. We will now say only that\r\nthe normal method for imposing such binding\r\nobligations should be by a treaty process.\r\nWe continue to feel the need to urge the Council\r\nto apply equal standards to the conduct of all States.\r\nThere should be no double standards or selectivity\r\nwhere there are violations of the Charter and of\r\ninternational law. The Council should act judiciously in\r\nupholding legality and should act objectively in\r\nsettling disputes on the basis of justice and fairness. It\r\nshould be not only developing countries that must\r\nalways face the prospect of sanctions and enforcement\r\naction. If that continues to be the pattern of Council\r\naction, there will be continued erosion in its credibility\r\nand legitimacy.\r\nWe continue to express our opposition to the\r\nholding of thematic debates in the Security Council.\r\nWe take the view that those activities go beyond the\r\nmandate of the Council, which is empowered to\r\nconsider threats to international peace and security.\r\nAnd they encroach on the authority of the General\r\nAssembly, which is the organ entrusted to discuss and\r\ndetermine norms and policies in broad areas of\r\ninternational cooperation. Regrettably, we note that the\r\nCouncil increased its activities in the holding of\r\nthematic debates over the past year. We feel that that\r\nendangers the proper balance in the exercise of the\r\nresponsibilities of the various organs of the United\r\nNations system.\r\nWe also continue to have concerns about the\r\nprocedures of the Council in relation to transparency\r\nand accountability. It is increasingly rare for the\r\nCouncil to hold debates on actual situations affecting\r\ninternational peace and security. Holding such debates\r\nallows the Council to hear the views and\r\nrecommendations of Member States as well as the\r\npositions of the parties. Regrettably, even when such\r\ndebates are held, Council members give their views\r\nbefore hearing those of the wider community. That is a\r\npractice which should change. It is important to\r\nemphasize that, in accordance with Article 24 of the\r\nCharter, the Security Council is accountable to the\r\ninternational community, on whose behalf it is\r\nexercising the primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nAccordingly, we would request that the views\r\nexpressed in this debate should be drawn to the\r\nattention of the Security Council, in accordance with\r\nthe recent decisions on the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI now turn to the subject of reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. We have noted the report of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters related to the\r\nSecurity Council (A/58/47). It is not surprising that,\r\nonce again, no consensus was possible and that the\r\nvarious issues were only debated again with fervour.\r\nWhat is clear now is that some decision has to be\r\ntaken. Debate and discussion cannot go on forever. In\r\nthe light of our expectation of proposals from the\r\nSecretary-General based on the recommendations of\r\nhis High-level Panel, to be introduced in December, a\r\nfinal determination need not be made at the current\r\nsession. But it cannot be delayed beyond the sixtieth\r\nsession. It is time for action. Decisions have to be\r\ntaken which are vital for the legitimacy and the\r\nauthority of the Council. The questions of\r\nrepresentation and the abolition of the veto are\r\nforemost and should be decided by the General\r\nAssembly, proceeding on the basis of rules for\r\ndecision-making set out in the Charter.\r\nAt this stage, Jamaica will not make detailed\r\ncomments on the issues and will await the proposals of\r\nthe Secretary-General, which, along with the results of\r\nthe Working Group’s deliberations, will form the basis\r\non which we will make our own pronouncement. In the\r\nmeantime, we support the recommendation in\r\nparagraph 30 of the Working Group’s report that the\r\nGroup continue its work during the fifty-ninth session.\r\nMr. Aboul Atta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): My\r\ndelegation would like first to speak of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council (A/59/2) to the General Assembly on\r\nthe Council’s work during the period 1 August 2003 to\r\n31 July 2004. We would like to thank the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom for introducing\r\nthe report.\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nThe report of the Security Council indicates that\r\nthe majority of items on its agenda concern the African\r\ncontinent. We welcome the approach, adopted by the\r\nCouncil during the period under review, of holding\r\nopen debates on issues related to the African continent.\r\nWe hope that the vision proposed by the general\r\nmembership of the Organization during these meetings\r\nwill establish a clear foundation for a better\r\nunderstanding of the challenges faced on that\r\ncontinent. We would also like to note the continued\r\ndevelopment of cooperation between the Council, on\r\nthe one hand, and the African Union and African\r\nregional organizations, on the other, in the area of\r\npeacekeeping and conflict resolution on the continent.\r\nWe call for increasing and strengthening such activities\r\nand for the further development of their mechanisms.\r\nDespite the Council’s repeated failure to shoulder\r\nits responsibilities in the face of the deteriorating\r\nsituation in the Middle East and its failure to adopt\r\nthree draft resolutions during the period under review,\r\none important positive development emerged during\r\nthat period: the adoption of Council resolution 1515\r\n(2003), which endorsed the road map.\r\nWe would like once again to affirm that the\r\nconcept of peace and security is comprehensive and\r\nincludes economic, social, humanitarian and\r\ngeographic aspects that cannot be separated or dealt\r\nwith in isolation. Accordingly, the Security Council\r\nmust undertake its main responsibilities in\r\npeacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building in\r\ncooperation and coordination with the relevant regional\r\norganizations and with the programmes and organs of\r\nthe United Nations, at the forefront of which are the\r\nGeneral Assembly, including its Main Committees, and\r\nthe Economic and Social Council. This is the case\r\nbecause those two organs constitute the appropriate\r\nlegislative machinery to formulate the principles that\r\nshould govern the overall peace-building process.\r\nI would like to turn now to Egypt’s thinking on\r\nthe question of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters. First, Mr. President, I would like to thank your\r\npredecessor and express my appreciation for his\r\ninitiative to stimulate a substantive discussion of this\r\nissue. This was helped by the papers and statistics that\r\nhe prepared, which enriched last session’s deliberations\r\nof the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council. His efforts also led to\r\nthe Working Group’s adoption of its report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly (A/58/47), which in our view is a\r\nnew launching pad for continuing our deliberations on\r\nthis important issue. I would also like to thank the\r\nPermanent Representatives of Ecuador and\r\nLiechtenstein, the coordinators on this issue during the\r\nfifty-eighth session.\r\nMy delegation does not want to reiterate the\r\nprinciples underlying the Egyptian position, which we\r\nhave done for the past 11 years whenever the issue was\r\naddressed. Nor do we wish to go into the details of our\r\nposition on the expansion of the Security Council —\r\nwhich we set out in our statement during the general\r\ndebate on 24 September, at the 10th plenary meeting,\r\nin which we declared our readiness to assume\r\npermanent responsibilities in the framework of our full\r\ncompliance with the position endorsed by African\r\nleaders in 1997 in Harare pertaining to the number of\r\npermanent and non-permanent seats that should be\r\nallocated to Africa and how they should be filled. My\r\ndelegation also reaffirms its support for the position of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement on the number of proposed\r\nSecurity Council members, as well as its position on\r\nthe categories of membership. All those positions are\r\ngoverned by our fundamental approach to this topic,\r\nwhich is that reform must be the subject of greater\r\nconsensus, must not lead to the exclusion of particular\r\ncivilizations or cultures from the international political\r\ndecision-making process, and must reflect the current\r\npolitical realities without marginalizing certain parties\r\nthat we believe have great importance in collective\r\ninternational action in the political, security and\r\neconomic spheres.\r\nWe are also convinced that Security Council\r\nreform cannot be carried out without an objective\r\nexamination by the General Assembly of its working\r\nmethods, and of the concepts of accountability and\r\ntransparency, which must be the solid principles of the\r\nmechanisms of collective international action in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nOur discussion of the item before the Assembly\r\ntoday has a new dynamic, one that we sensed in the\r\nlast session and that we are increasingly noticing\r\nduring the present one. Indeed, that dynamic is\r\nreflected in our current discussion of the topic. Many\r\ncountries have expressed the need to consider in depth\r\nthe issue of Security Council reform and all related\r\nmatters. Perhaps one reason for the great focus on the\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nissue by the international community is that we are\r\nawaiting the report of the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change. In addition, our proceedings\r\nduring this session have greater importance because we\r\nare preparing for the high-level meeting to be held\r\nduring the sixtieth session to review the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration, which\r\nincluded United Nations reform. We must engage in an\r\nin-depth and serious discussion of the six topics that\r\nwere proposed by the General Assembly President at\r\nthe previous session, and which were the basis of the\r\ndeliberations of the Working Group.\r\nWe must not lose sight of what we should achieve\r\nand must not confuse that with the narrow vision of\r\nwhat we want to achieve. We need to achieve an\r\nequitable and balanced representation on the Council\r\nthat will equally meet the rights of developing and\r\ndeveloped countries. Reform must not create a less\r\ncapable Council. Reform and expansion must be\r\nachieved in parallel. We must not have either reform or\r\nexpansion alone. We need to show genuine desire and\r\nserious political will to strike a comprehensive balance\r\nbetween reform and expansion. That balance must\r\ncombine the equitable distribution of new seats,\r\nequitable geographical representation that takes into\r\nconsideration the changes that have taken place in\r\nsome areas since the end of the cold war, and\r\nrepresentation of all cultures and civilizations.\r\nExpansion must also lead to the revitalization of the\r\nCouncil’s work and must secure its objectivity, its\r\nimpartiality and its respect for the principles of\r\ntransparency and accountability.\r\nIn conclusion, Mr. President, the delegation of\r\nEgypt affirms its support for your efforts and its total\r\nreadiness to cooperate with you and with all Member\r\nStates to ensure the successful conclusion of the\r\nWorking Group’s efforts.\r\nMr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French):\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations confers upon the\r\nSecurity Council the primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. When\r\nthe Security Council acts it does so on behalf of the\r\ninternational community. When it is powerless to act or\r\nwhen it fails to do so, the credibility of the United\r\nNations and of the entire international community is at\r\nstake. It is therefore in everybody’s interest that the\r\nSecurity Council be effective and respected, that it\r\ndemonstrate wisdom and fairness by not acting in haste\r\nor showing favouritism. It is also in the interest of all\r\nthat its composition be fully representative of the\r\ncommunity on whose behalf it acts and which gives it\r\nthe necessary legitimacy to do so.\r\nIt is therefore time to move forward with Security\r\nCouncil reform. Switzerland supports an increase in\r\nthe membership of the Council to strengthen the\r\nlegitimacy of its decisions and their implementation by\r\nMember States. The composition of the Security\r\nCouncil should better reflect changes that have\r\noccurred since the Organization was founded. A greater\r\nrole should be allocated to the developing countries,\r\nwhere the greatest number of people live, and better\r\naccount should be taken of the particular financial and\r\nmaterial support that certain countries provide to the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nMy country is in favour of expanding the Security\r\nCouncil, but it is against creating new seats that have\r\nveto power. We are against it because the current\r\nexercise of the veto is not democratic, but also because\r\nit would affect the Council’s ability to act.\r\nTo make the expansion possible, we need to find\r\na balanced formula acceptable to the greatest possible\r\nnumber of Member States. We note that the Working\r\nGroup on expansion of the Security Council has not\r\nbeen able, after 10 years of commendable effort, to\r\nfind a formula that it could submit to the General\r\nAssembly. Switzerland believes that the debate must\r\nnow be taken to another level, and we eagerly await the\r\nproposals of the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change, appointed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to take up the question of strengthening\r\ncollective security.\r\nThe expansion of the Security Council is the most\r\nvisible and the most frequently discussed aspects of\r\nCouncil reform, but it is not the only aspect that needs\r\nto be taken into account. Switzerland attaches great\r\nimportance to reforms — perhaps less dramatic, but\r\nequally essential — in the functioning of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nImportant improvements could be undertaken\r\nwithout any formal revision of the Charter. First, with\r\nregard to the exercise of the veto, my country has\r\ncalled for greater restraint here. Any abuse of the veto\r\naffects the credibility of the United Nations and\r\nincreases the already widespread feeling in certain\r\nregions of the world that double standards are\r\nsometimes being used. Furthermore, to the extent that\r\nthe veto is a kind of privilege, could one not expect\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\npeople who use the veto to explain that use in the\r\nGeneral Assembly after the event? Would it not be a\r\nmeans for a State concerned to have its position better\r\nunderstood by the international community?\r\nSecondly, Switzerland hopes that the work of the\r\nSecurity Council will continue to evolve towards\r\ngreater transparency and greater participation by non-\r\nMembers of the Council. There is a need to strengthen\r\nthe mechanisms for consultations with the States\r\ndirectly concerned by tension in their areas, as well as\r\nwith those that contribute to peace operations.\r\nSwitzerland also believes that greater progress\r\nshould be made towards making working documents\r\navailable. The Security Council deals with matters that\r\naffect all Member States and that require decisive\r\naction by all States. It is, therefore, important that all\r\nStates have access to the documents and draft\r\nresolutions as soon as they are being considered in the\r\nCouncil. This should occur without any delay and in a\r\nheightened spirit of transparency. Current practices\r\nhere are inadequate.\r\nThirdly, Switzerland believes that the General\r\nAssembly should once again play a central role in the\r\nfunctioning of the Organization. The ongoing reform of\r\nits working methods will, I hope, help to revitalize this\r\norgan.\r\nFor its part, the Security Council must retain the\r\narea of competence entrusted to it by the Charter. Yet,\r\nin three recent resolutions, the Security Council has\r\nacted as a legislator, imposing new obligations in a\r\ndiscretionary manner on Member States, and this has\r\nbeen done outside of the normal context of sanctions. It\r\nwas done in response to an urgent need to combat\r\nterrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. This kind of action should, however,\r\nremain the exception. The elaboration of new rules of\r\ninternational law with universal scope should occur,\r\nnot within a restricted circle, but with the participation\r\nof all, within the United Nations General Assembly, or\r\nthrough other normal diplomatic mechanisms.\r\nThe question of strengthening collective action is\r\ncentral to the current session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe time is right to make progress on the reforms that\r\nhave been discussed for so long. Switzerland calls\r\nupon all those interested to be open-minded and to be\r\nwilling to find a formula that is acceptable to the\r\ngreatest number of States.\r\nMr. Zaki (Pakistan): This item has been under\r\nconsideration in the General Assembly for over a\r\ndecade. The delay is a reflection of the importance and\r\ncomplexity of the issues involved.\r\nThere is general consensus that the Security\r\nCouncil’s composition and its working methods are not\r\ndemocratic. Decisions are taken by a few. The five\r\npermanent members, some more than others, exercise\r\ninordinate influence over the Council’s decisions.\r\nSimultaneously, there is visible concern at the\r\nincreasing concentration of decision-making power in\r\nthe Security Council in relation to the other organs of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe endeavour to improve the Security Council\r\nshould be guided by a vision of creating a new\r\nmultilateralism that is democratic and cooperative,\r\nrather than oligarchic and coercive. It must address the\r\nprincipal concerns of the United Nations membership\r\nabout the competence and sphere of responsibility of\r\nthe Security Council; its composition and\r\nrepresentativeness; its decision-making and working\r\nmethods; and its effectiveness and accountability.\r\nFirst, I will address the issue of the Security\r\nCouncil’s competence. The Security Council has been\r\nassigned the primary responsibility for the maintenance\r\nof peace and security under the Charter, specifically\r\nunder Chapters VI and VII. But the Charter clearly\r\nstipulates that the Security Council acts on behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly. Consequently, the Council is\r\naccountable for its decisions and actions to the general\r\nmembership, which is represented in this General\r\nAssembly. Moreover, the Security Council cannot\r\nexclude the Assembly from reviewing its work and\r\ndecisions; nor can it arbitrarily acquire exclusive\r\ncompetence over issues that do not directly involve the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security — such as\r\nterrorism, disarmament and non-proliferation. A major\r\ngoal of any United Nations reform process must be to\r\nensure the balance of responsibilities, envisaged under\r\nthe Charter, between the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nSecondly, there is the Council’s decision-making.\r\nBoth the Charter and the Council’s provisional rules of\r\nprocedure provide for discussion and decisions in open\r\nmeetings and in a transparent manner. It is only thus\r\nthat States can be held accountable for their positions\r\nand policies on the issues under consideration.\r\nUnfortunately, over the past three decades, most of the\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nSecurity Council’s deliberations and decisions take\r\nplace in closed “informal consultations”. Even the\r\nparties directly involved in various conflicts and\r\ndisputes are almost completely excluded from\r\nparticipation in the deliberative and decision-making\r\nprocess. The Council’s decisions are mostly ex parte —\r\nderogating an essential principle of due process. In the\r\nCouncil, initiatives emanate mostly from one or more\r\nof the five permanent members, or other small\r\ngroupings of major Powers, usually designated as\r\n“Friends” of the issue. The right of veto is usually\r\nexercised informally and invisibly — and, more\r\ninfrequently, openly — to ensure that the Security\r\nCouncil’s decisions not infringe the interests of the\r\npermanent members. Given the binding nature of the\r\nCouncil’s decisions, the power of the veto — explicit\r\nor implicit — has been used extensively to shape the\r\ninternational policies and behaviour of other States on\r\nan increasing number of issues.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council must\r\nprescribe ways and means to introduce greater\r\ndemocracy and due process into its deliberations and\r\ndecision-making. Open meetings should be the rule and\r\nnot the exception. The exercise of the veto must be\r\nfully justified, including allowing a possible review by\r\nthe General Assembly and even by the International\r\nCourt of Justice. Similarly, the Council’s decisions to\r\ntake enforcement action under Chapter VII should be\r\nsubjected to a periodic review by the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly to ensure against injustice and\r\ninjury to less powerful nations.\r\nOn the composition of the Council, it is quite\r\nevident that the Security Council’s current composition\r\nis not representative of the general membership. While\r\nthe five permanent members can be considered a\r\nseparate and exceptional category, the proportional\r\nrepresentation of the rest of United Nations\r\nmembership has become progressively worse over the\r\nlast few decades. In 1945, leaving aside the five\r\npermanent members, 46 United Nations Member States\r\nwere represented by 6 elected States on the Council —\r\na proportion of 7.5 to 1. By 1951, when the Council’s\r\nexpansion was proposed, 71 Member States were\r\nrepresented by 6 elected States — a proportion of 11.5\r\nto 1. By 1966, when the Council was enlarged to 15\r\nmembers, 122 Member States were represented by 10\r\nelected States — a proportion of 12 to 1. Today, 186\r\nStates are represented by 10 States — a proportion of\r\n18 to 1. It is clear, therefore, that the number of elected\r\nmembers of the Security Council must be enlarged. It\r\nshould at least restore the proportion of 10 to 1. This\r\nwould indicate the addition of at least 10 new elected\r\nmembers, and thus a Security Council composed of 25\r\nMember States.\r\nSecondly, the enlargement should reflect the\r\nregional composition of the general membership of the\r\nUnited Nations. Thus, the Council’s enlargement\r\nshould accord larger representation to Asia, Africa and\r\nLatin America, which are presently underrepresented\r\nin comparison to the other two regional groups.\r\nThirdly, the expansion should accord\r\nrepresentation to those States that entered the United\r\nNations after the last enlargement of the Council in\r\n1966. These are mostly small- and medium-sized\r\nStates. It is those small- and medium-sized States, and\r\nnot the larger States seeking permanent membership\r\nfor themselves on the Security Council, which\r\ncomprise the vast majority of the general membership\r\nand constitute the “new international reality”.\r\nIf the issue of enlargement had been guided by an\r\nobjective approach, agreement would have been\r\nreached several years ago. Unfortunately, consensus\r\nhas been frustrated by the ambitions of a few States\r\nthat desire the privileged status of the permanent five.\r\nThis status was the result of an historical agreement\r\nand is an unfortunate legacy with which the United\r\nNations membership has had to live. Our efforts should\r\nseek to temper the inequity and imbalance resulting\r\nfrom this unfortunate legacy, not to compound it\r\nfurther by creating new centres of privilege within the\r\nUnited Nations. New permanent members will not\r\nneutralize the inordinate influence of existing\r\npermanent members. Two wrongs cannot make a right.\r\nA larger oligarchy is no antidote to an elite power club.\r\nThe unequal power of the five can be tempered by the\r\ncombined endeavours of the general membership only\r\nby adding a sufficient number of elected members who\r\ncan influence the deliberations and decisions of the\r\nSecurity Council. If four or five new permanent\r\nmembers are added to a Council of 25, the rest of the\r\nUnited Nations membership — 181 States — will\r\ncontinue to be grossly underrepresented on the\r\nCouncil.\r\nSuch an addition of new permanent members\r\nwould thus further erode the principle of sovereign\r\nequality and the concept of collective security\r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. It would\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\naggravate tensions within every regional group, since\r\nthe claim of each of the aspirants for permanent status\r\nis opposed by other Member States from their own\r\nrespective regions. It would exclude the equitable\r\nparticipation of other States that have equal or better\r\ncredentials for permanent membership than some of the\r\nfour or five self-nominated aspirants.\r\nAlready, the announcement of the collective\r\nambition of the so-called G-4s has provoked open\r\ndivisions within and among regions. Several other\r\ncountries have declared their own candidacies. The\r\nforeign ministers of the Islamic countries have declared\r\nthat any reform proposal that neglects the adequate\r\nrepresentation of the Islamic Ummah, in any category\r\nof membership in an expanded Security Council, will\r\nnot be acceptable to the Islamic countries.\r\nMoreover, the addition of new permanent\r\nmembers would further complicate decision-making in\r\nthe Security Council. Such decisions would have to\r\naccommodate the interests of nine or 10 permanent\r\nmembers rather than the present five. This would\r\nhappen even if the new permanent members agreed to\r\nforego the right of veto.\r\nIt is in view of such considerations that the Non-\r\nAligned Movement countries have taken the logical\r\nposition that, if there is no agreement on other\r\ncategories of membership, expansion should take\r\nplace, for the time being, in the non-permanent\r\ncategory. Many countries outside the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement also share this view.\r\nEnlargement in the category of non-permanent\r\nmembers would adhere to the principle of sovereign\r\nequality, ensure greater representation of the general\r\nmembership and promote greater democracy and\r\naccountability in the work of the Security Council.\r\nInstead of a new “concert of power”, we must promote\r\nthe power of the principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter and the new paradigm of a cooperative and\r\ndemocratic multilateralism through an enlarged and\r\nreformed Security Council.\r\nIt is the hope of the Pakistan delegation that it is\r\nthis approach that will inspire the report and\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General’s High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. We\r\nhope that that report will also help to promote general\r\nconsensus on the issue of Security Council reform and\r\nenlargement. We are prepared, in this context, to\r\nconsider new ideas and approaches to promote\r\nconsensus.\r\nHowever, any effort to rush through a proposal on\r\nthe sensitive issue of Security Council enlargement by\r\na vote in the General Assembly will be manifestly\r\ndivisive. It will defeat the very purpose of the Panel’s\r\nreport, which, as we understand, is to promote\r\ncollective and unified action within a unified world\r\nOrganization in order to address the new and old\r\nthreats to peace and security. It is the aspirations of the\r\ngeneral membership, not the ambitions of the few, that\r\nmust drive the reform process.\r\nPakistan believes that the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil should be part of the comprehensive United\r\nNations reform, which includes the revitalization of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and other United Nations bodies. The\r\nissue of Security Council expansion cannot be\r\nconsidered in a piecemeal fashion divorced from other\r\nissues, such as its competence, decision-making ability,\r\nworking methods and accountability.\r\nThe general membership must have the time and\r\nthe opportunity to consider the issues and the report\r\nand recommendations of the Secretary-General’s Panel.\r\nMr. President, this exercise must be conducted within\r\nthe Assembly under your guidance. We should aim at\r\nadopting comprehensive decisions on the Panel’s\r\nreport, including on United Nations reform, by\r\nconsensus at the high-level event, to be convened next\r\nyear by the Secretary-General to mark the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Kim Sam-hoon (Republic of Korea): Over\r\nthe past year, the Security Council has continued and\r\nexpanded its vital work around the world. Rather than\r\ncommenting on every aspect of that work, I would like\r\nto focus on several issues that are of particular\r\nimportance to the Republic of Korea before moving on\r\nto the matter of Security Council reform.\r\nThe Republic of Korea commends the efforts of\r\nthe Security Council to combat terrorism and calls on\r\nall Member States to provide all possible assistance\r\nand cooperation. We strongly support the continuing\r\nwork of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and\r\nagree that it should be revitalized. We are also\r\nencouraged by the increasing coordination between the\r\nCTC and other bodies, including international, regional\r\nand subregional organizations, as well as the\r\nAl Qaeda/Taliban sanctions Committee.\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nIn addition, the Republic of Korea commends the\r\nSecurity Council on its unanimous adoption of\r\nresolution 1566 (2004) last Friday, which rightly\r\nrecognizes, in its operative paragraph 3, that terrorist\r\nacts\r\n“are under no circumstances justifiable by\r\nconsiderations of a political, philosophical,\r\nideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other\r\nsimilar nature”.\r\nThe emphasis on protecting and compensating\r\ncivilian victims is also noteworthy. We look forward to\r\nstronger, more concerted international efforts to\r\ncombat terrorism through the creation of a new\r\nworking group under the Security Council. Only by\r\nworking together at every level can the international\r\ncommunity hope to rid itself of the scourge of\r\nterrorism.\r\nA distinct but related matter is how to prevent\r\nweapons of mass destruction from falling into the\r\nhands of terrorists. By adopting resolution 1540\r\n(2004), the Security Council aptly addressed that grave\r\nconcern. Indeed, we note with interest that the Council\r\nhas taken on an increasing role in filling the gaps\r\nwithin the existing international legal regime by\r\nimposing binding and far-reaching obligations on all\r\nUnited Nations Member States to take domestic legal\r\nand administrative measures.\r\nWe recognize the concern expressed by some\r\ncountries that Security Council actions with law-\r\nmaking implications on such issues as non-\r\nproliferation and counter-terrorism may short-circuit\r\nthe treaty-making process involving all countries.\r\nHowever, given the urgency of these matters and the\r\ncomplexities of normal treaty-making procedures, we\r\naccept that the Security Council may need to take\r\nrelevant action in cases where efficiency and speed are\r\nrequired. As a demonstration of our firm commitment\r\nto the non-proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, the Republic of Korea is complying fully\r\nwith resolution 1540 (2004), and we encourage all\r\nMember States to do likewise.\r\nOver the last year, the Security Council focused\r\nmuch of its work on Iraq, where there have been both\r\ntriumphs and tragedies. Despite the ongoing violence\r\nand terrorism, there have been significant successes,\r\nincluding the transfer of sovereignty to the Interim\r\nGovernment of Iraq and the adoption of resolution\r\n1546 (2004), which we strongly support. We believe\r\nthat now more than ever, the international community\r\nmust come together to provide support and assistance\r\nto the sovereign nation of Iraq as it struggles to\r\nestablish security, hold elections, create democratic\r\ninstitutions and rebuild its civil society and\r\ninfrastructure.\r\nWe would also like to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate the people of Afghanistan on their first-\r\never democratic presidential election. After decades of\r\ndespair, Afghanistan has passed yet another milestone\r\non its path of hope. The Republic of Korea reaffirms its\r\nsupport for the Government and the people of\r\nAfghanistan in their ongoing efforts towards stability,\r\ndemocracy and peace.\r\nThe Republic of Korea supports the dedicated\r\nwork of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges\r\nand Change to develop and recommend new strategies\r\nand reforms for the United Nations in order to enable it\r\nto deal more effectively with challenges to\r\ninternational peace and security. We believe that, of all\r\nthe issues considered by the Panel, Security Council\r\nreform is of foremost concern. As the Security Council\r\ntakes on an increasingly crucial and extensive role in\r\nmaintaining peace and security around the world, the\r\nmatter of reform has become all the more important.\r\nThe position of the Republic of Korea on Security\r\nCouncil reform has been stated many times in the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group and in general debates.\r\nWe strongly believe that the Security Council should\r\nbe reformed in such a way as to make it more\r\nrepresentative of international realities, more\r\naccountable to the general membership, and more\r\neffective and operationally efficient than it is today.\r\nThe Republic of Korea shares the view that an increase\r\nin the non-permanent membership is the most realistic\r\nformula for meeting those criteria.\r\nWe share the concern that an expansion of the\r\npermanent membership would weaken the institutional\r\nvitality of the United Nations by alienating and\r\nmarginalizing a significant number of countries that\r\npossess the willingness and the capability to contribute\r\nsubstantially to international peace and security. By\r\ncontrast, an increase in elected members would make\r\nthe Council more accountable while strengthening the\r\nsense of shared ownership of the United Nations and\r\nthe Security Council by the general membership.\r\nThe Republic of Korea also attaches great\r\nimportance to rectifying existing imbalances among\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nregional groups in terms of an individual country’s\r\naverage chances of being represented on the Security\r\nCouncil. Under the current system, the Asian Group is\r\ngrossly underrepresented. Although it comprises 53\r\nMember States that are eligible for non-permanent\r\nmembership on the Security Council, it is allocated the\r\nsame number of seats as the Group of Western\r\nEuropean and Other States, which is half the size of the\r\nAsian Group, with 26 eligible Member States. As such,\r\nthe average chance of an Asian State to serve on the\r\nCouncil is one-half that of a member of the Group of\r\nWestern European and Other States, or two-thirds that\r\nof an African or Latin American country. We believe\r\nthat, in reforming the Security Council, such inequity\r\nand unfairness should be rectified as a matter of the\r\nhighest priority.\r\nIn conclusion, cooperation and unity among the\r\nwhole United Nations membership will be necessary to\r\nsurmount the daunting challenges ahead. Therefore, the\r\nreform of the Security Council must be carried out in a\r\nway that enhances unity among Member States.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): Expressing\r\nsupport for the joint consideration of items on the\r\nagenda of the General Assembly is one of the many\r\nways in which we participate in efforts to revitalize the\r\nAssembly. However, in the case of today’s debate, such\r\njoint consideration is much more than a technical\r\nexercise and a time-saving measure. In fact, we are of\r\nthe view that each of the items before us is inherently a\r\npart of the other; therefore, only a joint discussion can\r\nbe meaningful.\r\nThe report of the Security Council (A/59/2) is the\r\nmain tool defining the relationship between two of the\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations. It is worth\r\nmentioning that the Council has increasingly opened\r\nup to the wider United Nations membership, in\r\nparticular through the holding of open debates on\r\nissues that are believed to be of concern to the wider\r\nmembership. We welcome that practice and regularly\r\nparticipate in those debates. At the same time, we have\r\nno illusions as to the impact that those debates\r\nnormally have on decision-making in the Council.\r\nAlso, there are no recognizable criteria that govern the\r\nconvening of open debates. Just this past Friday, the\r\nCouncil adopted its resolution 1566 (2004), which, to\r\nour mind and to the minds of many others, would have\r\nwarranted an open debate for reasons of both substance\r\nand procedure, but such a debate did not take place.\r\nInstead, the wider membership will have an\r\nopportunity to express its opinions only after the fact.\r\nOur understanding of the relationship between the\r\nCouncil and the Assembly is clear: the Council acts —\r\nin accordance with the Charter of the United\r\nNations — on behalf of the entire membership. By\r\nelecting the non-permanent members of the Council,\r\nthe General Assembly entrusts those States with\r\nhandling issues related to international peace and\r\nsecurity on its behalf and accepts the relevant decisions\r\nas legally binding. The same kind of accountability\r\nextends — implicitly and to a greater degree — to the\r\nnon-elected members of the Council, which have a\r\nspecial, and certainly not a lesser, responsibility to\r\nbear. We are therefore of the view that the current\r\ninteraction between the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly is not sufficient. We certainly hope\r\nthat the measures agreed upon in the context of the\r\nrevitalization exercise will constitute a step forward.\r\nAgainst that general background of\r\naccountability, we also find that the report before us,\r\ncomprehensive as it is, lacks the necessary analytical\r\ndepth and fails to address many relevant questions.\r\nEver since it adopted its resolution 1373 (2001), the\r\nCouncil has expanded its activities into the field of\r\nlaw-making, a domain that, under the Charter, is\r\nreserved to the General Assembly. Parts of the current\r\npractice — as we witnessed once again during the\r\nreporting period — thus raise fundamental questions\r\nthat affect the institutional balance of the Organization.\r\nHowever, the report before us remains silent on that\r\ntopic.\r\nThe momentum for Security Council reform is\r\ngrowing, as the general debate of the fifty-ninth\r\nsession very clearly illustrated, and it appears that you\r\nin particular, Mr. President, and your Office will face a\r\nspecial and indeed historic challenge. A variety of\r\nfactors are leading to the recognition that more than 10\r\nyears of discussion are sufficient and that we cannot\r\ncontinue to adopt a wait-and-see attitude with regard to\r\nexpansion of the Security Council. We fully share the\r\nview that the Council needs to more be modern and\r\nmore representative if it is to truly represent the\r\ninternational community as a whole; we already\r\nexpressed our national position in that respect several\r\nyears ago.\r\nAt the same time, we firmly believe that\r\nexpansion is only one element — clearly a central\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nelement — of Security Council reform. A truly\r\nrepresentative Council must represent the membership\r\nnot only geographically, but also in substance. That\r\nunderstanding of representation is as important a\r\nchallenge as expansion is. In fact, it has been a part of\r\nthe discussions on Security Council reform for more\r\nthan 10 years now. Practice with regard to the\r\napplication of the veto and the greater inclusion of\r\naffected States that are not members of the Council\r\nmust be part of such reform.\r\nOne of the main factors in the ongoing build-up\r\nto Security Council reform is the report of the High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, to be\r\nsubmitted at the beginning of December. We all know\r\nthat the Panel cannot reform the Security Council on\r\nour behalf. But we must also not forget that expansion\r\nis not the core of the Panel’s mandate. It was a true\r\ncrisis of the Council and of multilateralism that led the\r\nSecretary-General to establish the High-Level Panel.\r\nNo one will argue that the size of the Council was at\r\nthe root of that crisis. To our mind, one must therefore\r\nconclude that only comprehensive reform — including\r\nexpansion, and going beyond it — can create a more\r\ncredible and thus more effective Security Council.\r\nMr. Wali (Nigeria): On behalf of the Nigerian\r\ndelegation to the United Nations at the fifty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, I wish to express my\r\nappreciation to the President of the Security Council,\r\nthe Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom,\r\nSir Emyr Jones Parry, for introducing the report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly (A/59/2).\r\nMy delegation considers the annual reporting of\r\nthe work of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly not merely as a matter of routine, in\r\nfulfilment of the relevant article of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations; it is also a means of acquainting\r\nMembers of the United Nations with the workings of\r\nthe Security Council and with the scope of its decisions\r\nand challenges in the area of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThere is hardly any doubt that the report provides\r\na comprehensive picture of the decisions of the\r\nCouncil. What is not clear is the assessment of the\r\nsuccess or otherwise of those Council measures. As it\r\nis now, Member States can hardly properly evaluate the\r\nworkings of the Council or its shortcomings on the\r\nbasis of the report with a view to recommending\r\nremedial action. There is a need, therefore, for more\r\ndetails on the circumstances that influence the\r\nCouncil’s adoption of resolutions and its decision-\r\nmaking.\r\nOne of those challenges concerns conflicts in\r\nAfrica, which dominated the work of the Council\r\nduring the reporting period. Nigeria appreciates the\r\nrole of the Council in the search for solutions to the\r\ncrises in Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and the Sudan, and we welcome past and\r\nongoing initiatives with regard to Somalia, Western\r\nSahara, the Central African Republic and the situation\r\nin Ethiopia and Eritrea. This interest is reflected in the\r\nSecurity Council’s speedy authorization of\r\npeacekeeping missions in Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI),\r\nLiberia (UNMIL) and Burundi (ONUB).\r\nAs part of efforts to respond to these challenges\r\nin the area of peacekeeping, the Council rightly\r\ndevoted a meeting last year to discuss peacekeeping\r\nactivities in the pursuit of international peace and\r\nsecurity. Along with this welcome initiative came the\r\nadoption of resolution 1502 (2003) on the protection of\r\nUnited Nations personnel, associated personnel and\r\nhumanitarian personnel in conflict zones. However, as\r\nthe open debate on United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations on 17 May 2004 revealed, the Organization\r\nwould need enormous resources to address the\r\nworldwide demands for peacekeeping operations. The\r\nawareness created in the course of that debate should\r\ngenerate much needed political support for United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations and for measures to\r\ntackle the root causes of conflicts that make such\r\noperations necessary in the first place.\r\nAllow me, in this regard, to commend the\r\nSecurity Council’s support to our subregional and\r\nregional organizations, the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States and the African Union. We point to\r\nthe steady progress made in the peace process in\r\nLiberia and Côte d’Ivoire as clear evidence of that\r\nsupport. We also note with satisfaction that the\r\nsituation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has\r\nimproved with the reactivation of the joint verification\r\nmechanism at Abuja in June 2004, on the initiative of\r\nthe President of Nigeria and Chairman of the African\r\nUnion, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, President Joseph\r\nKabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nPaul Kagame of Rwanda. We are confident that this\r\nmechanism will create the right atmosphere for a\r\npeaceful resolution of the crisis in that subregion.\r\n29\r\nA/59/PV.24\r\nIt is noteworthy that the Ad Hoc Working Group\r\non Conflict Prevention and Resolution in Africa,\r\nestablished by the Council, has continued to be active\r\nin engaging with countries in Africa to find durable\r\nsolutions to these conflicts. Its joint meeting with the\r\nAd Hoc Advisory Group on Burundi of the Economic\r\nand Social Council and with non-governmental experts\r\non regional and international norms on unconstitutional\r\nregime change in Africa point to that fact.\r\nUndoubtedly, the situation in the Sudan posed\r\nserious challenges to the African Union and the\r\ninternational community at the time the report was\r\nwritten. The Security Council’s involvement, through\r\nthe adoption of resolution 1556 (2004), contributed to\r\nbringing under control the humanitarian dimension of\r\nthe problem in the Darfur region of the country. My\r\ndelegation is pleased to note that the Security Council\r\nwill continue to lend its support to the Government of\r\nthe Sudan and the African Union in resolving the\r\nconflict. We look forward to the work of the panel of\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on allegations\r\nof human rights violations in the Sudan.\r\nThe festering crisis in the Middle East continues\r\nto be of concern to Nigeria. We note in the report that\r\nthe Council remains committed to this issue, especially\r\nin the implementation of the road map by the Quartet.\r\nEvents in the region have given a sense of urgency to\r\nfinding a durable solution and to the role of the\r\nCouncil in doing so. It is our hope that, despite the\r\nsetbacks reflected in the violence and heavy death tolls\r\non both sides, the Council will continue to lend its\r\nweight to a permanent solution that recognizes the\r\nexistence of two States living side by side.\r\nA major area of the Council’s work mentioned in\r\nthe report concerns the progress made in the global\r\neffort to combat terrorism. That issue featured on the\r\nCouncil’s agenda during the period covered by the\r\nreport, in the wake of the increase of terrorist attacks\r\nworldwide. Nigeria firmly supports the efforts of the\r\ninternational community to confront and neutralize\r\nterrorist attacks within and against Member States of\r\nthe Organization. We note with satisfaction the\r\ncontinuing involvement of the Council in this\r\nimportant matter, and we welcome resolution 1566\r\n(2004), adopted by the Council only last Friday.\r\nAs regards the working methods of the Council,\r\nNigeria appreciates recent positive trends, including\r\nregular consultations between the Council and regional\r\nand subregional organizations. We also note that\r\nregular meetings were held with troop-contributing\r\ncountries, as were open debates, including at the\r\nministerial level, on issues affecting Member States.\r\nWe believe that the President of the Council’s practice\r\nof conducting monthly briefings to the press was\r\nuseful, as was the invitation to non-members to attend\r\nperiodic wrap-up sessions. Clearly, a lot more needs to\r\nbe done to improve our knowledge of the Council’s\r\nwork methods and appreciation of the basis of its\r\ndecisions. For example, the Council’s closed meetings\r\nand informal consultations should be reduced to a\r\nminimum, while more open meetings should be\r\nconducted in order to demonstrate the transparency and\r\naccountability of the Council.\r\nOn the question of equitable representation on\r\nand increase in the membership of the Security Council\r\nand related matters, my delegation would like to\r\nregister our appreciation for the initiative of your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, President of the fifty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly. His initiative\r\nadded fresh impetus to the work of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters Related to the\r\nSecurity Council. Member States collectively support a\r\nreform of the Security Council, but with different\r\nparameters.\r\nAs my President stated in the course of the\r\ngeneral debate in his address to this Assembly at its 7th\r\nmeeting, on 23 September,\r\n“the Security Council should be expanded in its\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories to make\r\nit more representative, more effective and more\r\nacceptable. We hope that those regions of the\r\nworld that are not currently represented in the\r\npermanent membership category will be given\r\nmembership”.\r\nMy delegation wishes to assure the Assembly of our\r\ncooperation and support in meeting the challenges of\r\nthis arduous task.\r\nThe meeting was rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
