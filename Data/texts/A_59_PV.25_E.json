(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda items 11 and 53 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/59/2)\r\nQuestions of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council\r\nand related matters\r\nMr. Sardenberg (Brazil): First, I would like to\r\ncongratulate Ambassador Sir Emyr Jones Parry,\r\nrepresentative of the United Kingdom and President of\r\nthe Security Council for the month of October, for\r\nhaving introduced this report to the General Assembly\r\ncovering the period from 1 August 2003 to 31 July\r\n2004. I would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nthank Ambassador Motoc and the delegation of\r\nRomania for drafting the report. I would, in addition,\r\nlike to extend a word of recognition to the Secretariat\r\nfor providing support in the preparation of the\r\ndocument.\r\nThe submission of an annual report by the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly in\r\naccordance with the relevant articles of the United\r\nNations Charter is a practice that flows from the fact\r\nthat the Council was entrusted by Members with the\r\nprimary responsibility for maintaining international\r\npeace and security and it acts on their behalf in that\r\nregard. Reporting is a practice that promotes\r\naccountability, as it allows the wider United Nations\r\nmembership to discuss and assess the Council’s\r\nachievements and failures, its shortcomings and\r\nworking methods.\r\nAs the present report shows, the agenda of the\r\nSecurity Council has become increasingly complex,\r\ngoing far beyond classic situations of inter-State\r\nconflict or even of struggles at the domestic level that\r\nare likely to endanger international peace and security.\r\nThat trend, which has been apparent for the past 15\r\nyears, is ever more pronounced nowadays. The\r\nSecurity Council currently deals with a variety of\r\nissues such as post-conflict peace-building, economic\r\nreconstruction, promotion of justice and the rule of\r\nlaw, national reconciliation, activities related to\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-\r\ncombatants, conflict prevention, the fight against\r\nterrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction to non-State actors, among others. Today\r\nthe Council’s active agenda consists of more than 70\r\nitems. Some of them are new, while others have been\r\nbefore the Council for decades. The difficulty in\r\nsecuring peace and security stands as a grim reminder\r\nof the limitations that are presently inherent in the\r\nCouncil’s work and structure.\r\nThe nature and volume of those issues are leading\r\nthe Council to alter, even revise, its procedures,\r\nmethods and tools. Meetings are held every day,\r\nsometimes concurrently, as happened this morning, yet\r\nthe Council’s monthly programme of work does not\r\nseem to allow for all issues under consideration to be\r\ndiscussed with the necessary time and in-depth analysis\r\nthey require.\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nSuch developments take place against the\r\nbackdrop of what we believe is a disturbing tendency\r\nto apply a range of explicit enforcement provisions\r\nunder Chapter VII not only to actual threats to\r\ninternational peace and security, but also to potential\r\nones. Moreover, increasingly loose reference to\r\nChapter VII has led to its becoming a conceptual\r\numbrella for issues not directly related to security, and\r\nhas even led to situations in which the Security Council\r\nmight potentially interfere with the legal and political\r\nprerogative of States, such as treaty-making. That is\r\nnot, in our view, the most judicious use of provisions\r\nintended to be used as a last resort, whose\r\nimplementation should result from thorough\r\nassessment grounded in sound criteria and sound\r\npolitical judgement.\r\nThe Council should not allow ambiguities to seep\r\ninto its resolutions and its decisions; nor should it\r\ntacitly permit profuse resort to Chapter VII, which\r\ncould negatively affect multilateral efforts aimed at\r\npromoting collective action with a focus on\r\ncooperation. Indeed, cooperation is clearly a legitimate\r\napproach that, even in crucial cases, may have greater\r\npotential for effectiveness.\r\nAs a current non-permanent member of the\r\nCouncil, Brazil has itself been directly confronted with\r\nquestions that stem from today’s challenging agenda,\r\nand we are actively engaged in finding specific, precise\r\nresponses. It seems clear to us that, in many\r\ncontemporary conflicts, action aimed at restoring peace\r\nand security must be combined with measures that\r\npromote social and economic development.\r\nConsiderations such as these have been guiding the\r\nBrazilian approach to many issues related to conflicts\r\nbeing considered by the Council.\r\nFor instance, with regard to Haiti — which\r\nunfortunately had to be reintroduced into the agenda\r\nless than a decade after an earlier involvement by the\r\nCouncil — Brazil has supported the idea of engaging\r\nthe international community, together with the\r\nauthorities in Port-au-Prince, in designing a long-term\r\ndevelopment strategy aimed at achieving long-term\r\nstability and combating poverty, thus facilitating peace\r\nand democracy in that country.\r\nIn the case of Guinea-Bissau, we joined an\r\ninitiative involving the Economic and Social Council\r\nand international financial institutions that seek to\r\nwork with the transitional Government to create\r\nconditions for national growth and prosperity. The\r\ninitiative is an effort to prevent social and economic\r\nstrife from degenerating into yet another West African\r\nconflict of major dimensions.\r\nA third case in point is Timor-Leste, where we\r\nhave actively urged the Council to continue to provide\r\nthe new nation with the support it needs in order to\r\nconsolidate the institutions that are essential to secure a\r\nfuture of stability and prosperity. That would help to\r\nensure that the international community’s peace and\r\nsecurity investment in that country and other efforts\r\nthere are not wasted.\r\nSustaining such interdisciplinary action — which\r\nin many ways is also innovative — requires not only\r\nincreased attention by the Council but also frequent\r\nand fluid interaction on the part of the Council with\r\nother main organs of the United Nations, as well as\r\nbroader participation by the membership. Brazil is of\r\nthe view that both the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council can do much to\r\ncontribute to the adequate assessment of, and effective\r\nresponse to, the multidisciplinary challenges with\r\nwhich the Security Council is currently confronted. I\r\nneed not stress that the United Nations Charter already\r\nclearly provides for such institutional partnerships, as\r\nin Article 12, paragraph 1, concerning the General\r\nAssembly, and in Article 65, with respect to the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. We also welcome\r\nregular meetings among the Presidents of the main\r\nbodies of the United Nations system.\r\nThe practice of holding frequent open debates\r\nand public meetings is highly useful, as it allows the\r\nCouncil to devote attention to a broad spectrum of\r\nopinion on the issues before it and, in fact, enhances\r\nthe quality of the Council’s deliberations. In addition,\r\nbriefings by the presidency in meetings with troop-\r\ncontributing countries, besides promoting transparency\r\nand accountability, add greater focus to those\r\ndeliberations.\r\nIn the context of the reform exercise, we should\r\nexplore all such possibilities to the fullest in order to\r\nprovide greater leverage to the United Nations system\r\nas a whole in addressing contemporary challenges.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly\r\npromises to be crucial for the adoption of decisions\r\nregarding the reform of the Organization aimed at\r\nbetter equipping it to deal with the growing threats and\r\nchallenges that characterize present-day international\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nreality. In that effort, reform of the Security Council is\r\na task that should no longer be put off. For many years,\r\na decision on that issue has eluded us, as not enough\r\nprogress has been made within the framework of its\r\nconsideration by the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nthe Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council\r\nand Other Matters Related to the Security Council.\r\nBased on a shared conception of the need for\r\nfundamental reform in the composition of the Security\r\nCouncil, my Government recently joined Germany,\r\nIndia and Japan in expressing joint support for reform\r\nthat meets the expectations of the majority of Members\r\nof the Organization. We will work together with other\r\nlike-minded Member States towards meaningful reform\r\nof the United Nations, including that relating to the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council. We are convinced\r\nthat Africa must be represented in the permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council, and we welcome\r\nthe presentation of candidatures of countries from that\r\nregion for a permanent seat.\r\nThe question of United Nations reform —\r\nparticularly the need for the Security Council to\r\nbecome more representative, legitimate and\r\neffective — has, in effect, acquired unparalleled\r\nrelevance and urgency for most Members of the United\r\nNations. In this session’s general debate, 148 out of the\r\n190 representatives who took the floor expressed their\r\nviews on these issues. In that regard, my Government\r\nwishes to take this opportunity to express its heartfelt\r\nrecognition and appreciation to all those who have\r\nmanifested — on that occasion and at today’s\r\nmeeting — the support of their countries for a\r\nBrazilian permanent membership in an expanded\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nOn the basis of the perceived need to bring the\r\nUnited Nations and its principal organs up to date with\r\ncurrent international realities, the Secretary-General\r\nestablished the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change. Its findings and\r\nrecommendations will be available by the end of this\r\nyear. Last week, during the debate on the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/59/1), I had the opportunity to express my\r\nGovernment’s broad expectations with regard to the\r\nwork of the Panel. On that occasion, I stressed the\r\nimportance of not considering the threats and\r\nchallenges facing the Organization strictly from a\r\nperspective of coercion and the use of force; of putting\r\nforward recommendations aimed at strengthening not\r\nonly the Security Council, but also the other principal\r\norgans of the United Nations; and of avoiding the\r\nexpansion of the scope of Security Council action in a\r\nmanner that would interfere with the mandated\r\nfunctions of the other main bodies. I also emphasized\r\nthe need not to mistake the increased activity of the\r\nCouncil in recent years for a sign that that body is\r\nfunctioning well. Such activity is rather evidence of the\r\nincreasingly fragile foundations of international peace\r\nand security. Finally, I stress the need to heed the call\r\nof the international community for greater\r\nmultilateralism.\r\nNow, I wish to add a few remarks that pertain\r\nspecifically to the reform of the Security Council.\r\nFirst, it is necessary to take into account adequately the\r\nexpectations of the Member States. It is certainly\r\nsignificant that more than half of the 148 Member\r\nStates that referred to the issue of reform of the\r\nSecurity Council during the general debate explicitly\r\nput forward the view that the Council should be\r\nexpanded in both the permanent and non-permanent\r\nmember categories. Secondly, and no less significantly,\r\nonly five countries expressed a preference for a partial,\r\nmore limited kind of Council expansion.\r\nThirdly, nearly all of those Members that\r\ndefended an expansion in both categories were of the\r\nopinion that there should be new permanent seats for\r\ndeveloping countries, some of which, including my\r\nown, were specifically mentioned, as I noted earlier.\r\nThe views of Brazil on the issue of the reform of\r\nthe Security Council are today shared by many and\r\ncome as no surprise. The Security Council must be\r\nstrengthened and made more representative and\r\nlegitimate. Its composition, in particular as concerns its\r\npermanent membership, can not remain unaltered. It\r\ncan no longer ignore the emergence on the\r\ninternational scene of developing countries that have\r\nbecome important actors, both regionally and globally\r\nand often exercise a critical role in promoting the\r\npacific settlement of disputes.\r\nWe must also incorporate, on a permanent basis,\r\ncountries that have the will and the capacity to take on\r\nmajor responsibilities with regard to the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. In short, better\r\nrepresentation confers greater legitimacy, and greater\r\nlegitimacy increases the efficiency and efficacy of the\r\nwork of the Council.\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nOn the basis of those considerations, Brazil is\r\nready to work, through the intergovernmental process\r\nand together with our partners and the wider\r\nmembership, in a common effort to make the\r\nOrganization a better reflection of its Members’\r\naspirations for a more peaceful and just world. It is a\r\ntask that is pressing on us now and must be\r\naccomplished.\r\nMr. Requeijol Gual (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThis is the third time that a brief analytic summary is\r\nincluded in the annual report which, although still\r\ninsufficient, marks a step forward towards the\r\nobjective of having truly substantive reports on the\r\nwork of the Security Council.\r\nWithout disregarding the value of the current\r\nreport as part of the Council’s institutional memory, we\r\nstill hope for a text with greater analytical content,\r\nwhich presents the political and legal grounds of, at\r\nleast, the most important decisions the Council adopts.\r\nWe believe such a report should reflect not only\r\nwhat has been done, but also what has not been\r\nachieved and the reasons why this has occurred,\r\nparticularly in cases where the Council has failed to act\r\nor when it has visibly lacked unity. Thus, there must be\r\nmore analytical details on divided votes, especially in\r\nthose cases where a negative vote of one of its\r\npermanent members was recorded. For instance, during\r\nthe term under consideration, the veto was exercised on\r\nfour occasions; three of them involved the United\r\nStates voting against draft resolutions on the\r\nPalestinian question.\r\nAs long as the Council does not succeed in\r\nchanging its current practices, its annual report should\r\ncomprise detailed information on the discussions\r\ncarried out in closed meetings, including the diverging\r\nopinions Council members may have on given issues.\r\nDue to the limitations still characterizing the\r\nannual report, the only meagre means available at the\r\nmoment to obtain bits of information concerning\r\nclosed meetings are the informal briefing meetings,\r\nwhich are carried out by the rotating presidency and\r\nare of varying quality and consistency, and that\r\npresidency’s subsequent monthly assessment.\r\nThe General Assembly still does not receive the\r\nspecial reports which, under the Charter, the Council\r\nshould submit when necessary. During the current\r\nterm, we have also seen actions and omissions by the\r\nCouncil that would have merited the preparation of a\r\nspecial report to the Assembly, which would have\r\ncontributed to promoting the active interrelation\r\nbetween both bodies that we all hope for. The\r\nAssembly would then be able to formulate useful\r\nrecommendations for the work of the Council.\r\nIn that sense, we consider vital the full\r\nimplementation of relevant resolutions adopted by this\r\nAssembly, for instance, resolutions 51/193 and 58/126;\r\nthe latter contains provisions in its section A referring\r\nnot only to the quality of the Council’s annual report,\r\nbut also to a follow-up to the results of the debate we\r\nare having today.\r\nWe reiterate that our demands do not represent\r\nsimple academic curiosity, but the fact that Member\r\nStates represented in the Assembly have the legitimate\r\nright to expect appropriate accountability from the\r\nbody, of limited composition, to which we have\r\nentrusted the prime responsibilities for maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security and which, pursuant to\r\nthe Charter, acts on behalf of all Member States.\r\nThere will not be true reform of the United\r\nNations without reform of the Security Council, a body\r\nwhere the principle of sovereign equality is\r\ninstitutionally and flagrantly violated on a daily basis.\r\nThe rule of international law cannot be re-\r\nestablished, particularly that of the Charter, nor can\r\nthere be democracy within this Organization as long as\r\nthe Council exercises totalitarian power. It is also true\r\nthat Council members, including the permanent\r\nmembers, also endure the dictatorship of the super-\r\nPower established by the strength of arms and money.\r\nIt is well known that the veto was the reflection\r\nof an international balance that does not even exist\r\ntoday, and Member States, with few exceptions, agree\r\nthat the veto must be eliminated.\r\nHowever, the essential fact is not so much the\r\nlegal aspect of the veto but mainly the powerful forces\r\nthat suppress the other permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers and Member States. Such forces govern the\r\nessential processes of the world economy, finance,\r\nmilitary supremacy and also the precarious and\r\ntemporary equilibria; the same correlations that hamper\r\nthe exercise of the physical majority of the non-\r\npermanent members also prevent the General\r\nAssembly from regaining the powerful functions\r\nentrusted to it by the United Nations Charter, given the\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\npolitical, military and financial realities of this era.\r\nUntil such time as the elimination of the veto is\r\nachieved, its use should be limited to Chapter VII of\r\nthe Charter, as a first step towards that aim.\r\nThe Security Council should be broadened to\r\ninclude new permanent and non-permanent members.\r\nNew permanent and non-permanent posts — created in\r\nthe Council as part of its broadening — should be\r\nentrusted with the same prerogatives as the current\r\nmembers have.\r\nThe objective of the enlargement should be to\r\ncorrect the insufficient representation of developing\r\ncountries. Two or three developing countries from\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean, two or three from\r\nAfrica and two or three developing countries from Asia\r\nshould join as permanent members, with the same\r\nprerogatives of those currently possessing them,\r\nincluding the veto.\r\nAs stated by the Non-Aligned Movement, if\r\nagreement is not reached in other categories, at least\r\nthe number of non-permanent members should be\r\nincreased for the time being. Greater transparency in\r\nthe work of the Security Council is an urgent matter.\r\nDecisions taken within that body have ever-increasing\r\ndirect or indirect implications on all Member States, in\r\nan increasingly interdependent world. Furthermore,\r\nmany of these decisions, when carried out, should be\r\nfinanced by all Member States, and not only by those\r\ntaking such decisions.\r\nThe annual report of the Security Council should\r\ninclude more illustrative statistics, including\r\npercentages, on the number of public meetings and\r\nconsultations of the whole and the time devoted to\r\nthem. This would provide us with more detailed\r\ninformation for debate in the General Assembly and\r\ngive us a deeper understanding of why the Security\r\nCouncil still continues to do the majority of its work\r\nbehind closed doors, despite the fact that this not only\r\ncontravenes the Council’s rules of procedure but has\r\nalso been emphatically and repeatedly qualified as\r\nunacceptable by most Member States.\r\nIt is not only necessary to increase the number of\r\nopen meetings, but also to turn them into genuine\r\nopportunities to properly take into account the opinions\r\nand contributions of States who are not members of the\r\nCouncil. Similarly, it would be useful to establish\r\nminimum briefing requirements for the monthly reports\r\nof the Council President.\r\nOvercoming secrecy in the work of the Council\r\nwould allow our Governments to obtain the\r\ninformation they need to make timely policy decisions.\r\nIn this context, we would like to thank those members\r\nof the Council, especially countries belonging to the\r\nGroup of Latin American and Caribbean States and the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement caucus, which have\r\nundertaken specific efforts to keep us as well informed\r\nas possible on the work of the Council.\r\nThe Security Council also violates both the spirit\r\nand letter of the Charter through an increasingly\r\nvoracious and intrusive agenda which usurps the\r\nfunctions of the General Assembly and the Economic\r\nand Social Council. The adoption of resolution 1540\r\n(2004) is a clear example of this and of the interest on\r\nthe part of certain States in transforming the Council\r\ninto a body that adopts texts which, in practice, are\r\nsimilar in scope to international treaties. We consider\r\nthat international legal obligations, including those\r\nrelated to disarmament, arms control and non-\r\nproliferation, should not be legislated for all Member\r\nStates without their full participation and sovereign\r\nacceptance through their signature and ratification of\r\nrelevant treaties and agreements that have been\r\nnegotiated multilaterally.\r\nWhile the Security Council oversteps its remit on\r\ncertain issues, on others it succumbs to stalemate, such\r\nas we see regarding the situation of the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories, and this is a matter of concern.\r\nFurthermore, there is no logical explanation for\r\nthe fact that the Council’s rules of procedure continue\r\nto be provisional after so many years of being in force,\r\nand that it has not been amended for more than 20\r\nyears.\r\nFinally, we consider that the General Assembly’s\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council should continue to\r\nwork with renewed energy.\r\nMr. Balestra (San Marino): Like previous\r\nspeakers, San Marino wishes to make its contribution\r\nto the discussion of item 53 on the General Assembly’s\r\nagenda, concerning the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on, and increased membership of, the\r\nSecurity Council and related matters. We want to thank\r\nAmbassadors Wenaweser and Gallegos for the\r\nexcellent work they have done.\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nThe Security Council was created as an\r\ninstrument to prevent and remove international threats\r\nand to ensure peace and security. This body is still the\r\nonly one that can authorize the collective use of force,\r\nand for this reason it must be representative,\r\nresponsible, efficient and, most importantly, capable of\r\nadapting to the new challenges that the international\r\ncommunity faces. For this reason, an increase in\r\nSecurity Council membership is necessary but must be\r\ncarefully thought out.\r\nSome delegations have expressed their concern\r\nregarding the fact that the Open-ended Working Group\r\non Security Council reform has not yet obtained results\r\ndespite many years of intensive activity. There is here\r\nan implicit criticism which, in my view, seems to be\r\ndirected at a group of countries whose only fault lies in\r\nhaving opposed the ways and means of reforming the\r\nCouncil, as proposed by another group of countries.\r\nThe international community bears common\r\nresponsibility for its lack of readiness to take a\r\ndecision on this extremely sensitive matter; this state\r\nof affairs reveals the danger of instituting reforms\r\nwhich do not meet international standards of\r\ndemocracy and fairness.\r\nSan Marino is convinced that a decision on the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council, to be effective,\r\nmust be made on the basis of consensus, or at least\r\ngeneral agreement.\r\nReiterating what my country’s Foreign Minister,\r\nMr. Fabio Berardi, stated during the general debate,\r\nSan Marino favours an increase in the number of non-\r\npermanent members as appropriate. Such an\r\nenlargement would ensure greater participation by all\r\ncountries in the Security Council, with more equitable\r\ngeographical representation through democratic\r\nelections in the General Assembly.\r\nThe contribution of a State to the work of the\r\nSecurity Council consists not only in its participation\r\nin the Council, but also in the expression of its\r\npreferences for the most qualified candidates to serve\r\non the Council in a particular period of history, which\r\nit does when electing them in the General Assembly.\r\nSeventy-eight Member States of this Organization have\r\nnever served in the Security Council. For those\r\ncountries, participation in the democratic process of\r\nelecting members to the Security Council is a most\r\nimportant and valuable contribution which they bring\r\nto the work of the Security Council.\r\nThe extension of the privileges of permanent\r\nmembership to other countries would mean creating\r\nadditional injustice, discrimination and inequality. San\r\nMarino is in favour of gradually restricting the right of\r\nveto, with a view to its eventual elimination. The veto\r\nis a vestige of the past, which grew out of specific\r\ncircumstances that are no longer present. This\r\nanachronism should be limited and discouraged. We\r\nbelieve that the majority agrees on the fact that the use\r\nof the veto should be limited to Chapter VII matters\r\nand that it should be subject to further limitations such\r\nas its suspension, banning the use of the single veto,\r\nand prohibiting the use of the veto on questions of\r\nreform. We consider it extremely important for\r\npermanent members to have the ability to cast negative\r\nvotes on draft resolutions without vetoing them and we\r\ndeem it indispensable to introduce the concept of\r\naccountability with regard to the veto.\r\nSan Marino awaits the report of the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change. We are\r\nconfident that the Panel will take into consideration all\r\nthe above-mentioned aspects of reform in its\r\ndeliberations. We look forward to availing ourselves of\r\nthose deliberations as additional food for thought in the\r\ndiscussions of the Assembly’s Working Group.\r\nMr. Haraguchi (Japan): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing my appreciation to the President of the\r\nSecurity Council, Ambassador Sir Emyr Jones Parry of\r\nthe United Kingdom, for his presentation of the annual\r\nreport of the Security Council on its work. I would also\r\nlike to thank the former President of the General\r\nAssembly, His Excellency Mr. Julian Robert Hunte, as\r\nwell as Ambassador Luis Gallegos Chiriboga of\r\nEcuador and Ambassador Christian Wenaweser of\r\nLiechtenstein, for their efforts in reinvigorating the\r\ndiscussion in the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters Related to the Security Council.\r\nThe United Nations is confronted with new\r\nthreats, such as internal violence, poverty, infectious\r\ndiseases, terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction, as well as the inter-State conflicts\r\nthat the United Nations Charter was originally intended\r\nto address.\r\nThe Japanese Government regards Security\r\nCouncil reform, which is an initiative to bring the\r\nCouncil in line with the realities of international\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\npolitics at the beginning of the twenty-first century, as\r\nthe central issue of United Nations reform. This is\r\nbecause the Security Council, as an organ with the\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, must be able to\r\naddress the aforementioned issues effectively.\r\nThe establishment of the High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change represents an effort by\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan to improve the United\r\nNations system for addressing those challenges. Along\r\nwith the work of the High-level Panel, serious\r\ndiscussions have also being going on among United\r\nNations Member States, particularly on the subject of\r\nSecurity Council reform, since the Council must play\r\nthe central role in matters related to international peace\r\nand security.\r\nJapan’s position on Security Council reform, as\r\nPrime Minister Koizumi stated in the general debate at\r\nthe 4th plenary meeting, is that, in order for the\r\nCouncil to effectively address its new threats and\r\nchallenges, countries with the will and resources to\r\nplay a major role in international peace and security\r\nmust always take part in the Council’s decision-making\r\nprocess. In addition, the Security Council must become\r\nmore representative in order to better reflect today’s\r\nworld. The Security Council therefore needs to be\r\nexpanded, both in its permanent and non-permanent\r\ncategories, adding new members from both developing\r\nand developed countries.\r\nIt is our conviction that the role that Japan has\r\nplayed in the international community has provided us\r\nwith sufficient basis for assuming the responsibilities\r\nof a permanent member of the Security Council. Japan\r\nalso supports Brazil, Germany and India as legitimate\r\ncandidates for permanent membership in the Security\r\nCouncil. In addition, we believe that Africa must be\r\nrepresented in the permanent membership of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nFor more than a decade, we have conducted\r\ndiscussions in the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters Related to the Security Council. In spite of\r\nthat, we have not been able to arrive at a consensus\r\namong Member States on how to reform the Council.\r\nIn December, the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change is to issue its report, which is\r\nexpected to include proposals on Security Council\r\nreform. This time, it is incumbent upon us to conduct a\r\nserious discussion to seek ways to adjust the Security\r\nCouncil to the current realities of the world. Based on\r\nthat discussion, we have to produce solid results\r\nregarding Security Council reform in the next year,\r\nwhich marks the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of\r\nthe United Nations. Nothing less than our wisdom,\r\ncourage and public spirit are challenged, from the\r\nglobal viewpoint, in addressing this issue.\r\nFacts speak more eloquently than rhetoric. In the\r\nChairman’s summary of the work of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group during the fifty-eighth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, it was stated that many speakers\r\nhad expressed support for an increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council in both the\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories. In the\r\ngeneral debate in September, we were able to have a\r\nlively discussion on Council reform. By our own count,\r\namong the 151 Member States that referred to the need\r\nfor Security Council reform, as many as 86 supported\r\nthe expansion of the Council in both the permanent and\r\nnon-permanent categories. Dozens more may have\r\nwished to express the same viewpoint, but were\r\nprevented from doing so by time constraints.\r\nThere are thus many nations that believe it is time\r\nto expand the number of both permanent and non-\r\npermanent seats in the Security Council. In contrast,\r\nonly six countries supported the expansion of the\r\nCouncil in the non-permanent category only. These\r\nfigures present a clear picture of what Member States\r\ndesire in terms of Security Council reform.\r\nThere is, thus, substantial impetus among\r\nMember States in support of the expansion of both\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories of Security\r\nCouncil membership. We must translate this sentiment\r\ninto the realization of true reform. Japan, along with\r\nmany other like-minded Member States, will do its\r\nutmost to ensure that Security Council reform finally\r\nbecomes a reality. In view of the substantial interest\r\nthat many United Nations Members have in this issue,\r\nJapan would like to reserve the right to seek further\r\ndiscussion under agenda item 53 during the current\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nI welcome the Council’s voluntary efforts to\r\nimprove its working methods in recent years. Among\r\nother improvements, the frequency of open briefings\r\nfor non-Council members and of open debates allowing\r\nfor statements by non-Council members has certainly\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nincreased. I believe that such meetings contribute to\r\nthe enhanced transparency of Security Council\r\ndiscussions. In order for the varied opinions of\r\nMember States to be reflected in the Security Council’s\r\ndiscussions, it must provide non-member States with\r\nopportunities to participate in Council meetings,\r\nespecially with regard to those matters in which they\r\nhave major stakes.\r\nSince the decisions of the Security Council are\r\ngenerally binding on all Member States, it is vital that\r\nthe views of those States that are major stakeholders be\r\nreflected in the decision-making process. By so doing,\r\nthe Security Council will be able to fulfil its\r\nresponsibility of being accountable to Member States.\r\nIt is Japan’s hope that the Council will continue to look\r\nfor means to involve those non-Council members with\r\na vital interest in an issue under discussion more\r\nsubstantially in the Council’s decision-making process.\r\nFor the resolutions that have large budgetary\r\nimplications on such activities as political missions and\r\nthe consolidation of peace, in addition to those\r\npertaining to peacekeeping operations, transparency as\r\nwell as accountability needs to be ensured, particularly\r\nvis-à-vis major financial contributing countries.\r\nA mechanism has been established for\r\nconsultations between the Council and troop-\r\ncontributing countries regarding specific peacekeeping\r\noperations. This mechanism needs to be expanded to\r\ninclude major financial contributors as well. In this\r\nregard, Japan considers the attendance by non-Council\r\nmembers at meetings of the Working Group of the\r\nWhole on United Nations Peacekeeping Operations to\r\nbe a sign of progress, and looks forward to further\r\nefforts by the Security Council for the revitalization of\r\nthis Group.\r\nMr. Talbot (Guyana): The delegation of Guyana\r\nwelcomes the opportunity to participate in the joint\r\ndebate on item 11, “Report of the Security Council”,\r\nand item 53, “Question of equitable representation on\r\nand increase in the membership of the Security Council\r\nand related matters”.\r\nMy brief contribution today will focus on the\r\nquestion of Security Council reform. In so doing, I\r\nwish to pay tribute to the efforts made by the President\r\nof the General Assembly during its fifty-eighth session,\r\nMr. Julian Hunte, to advance the process of Security\r\nCouncil reform and to impart fresh impetus to our\r\ndeliberations.\r\nReform of the Security Council is a matter of\r\nfundamental importance to the future of the United\r\nNations. As a small State, relying as we do on this\r\ncollective system for our own peace and security,\r\nGuyana has sought the assurance that a new, reformed\r\nCouncil can provide reasonable protection for our\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity as a matter of\r\nparamount importance.\r\nIt is now more than four years since world leaders\r\nresolved at the Millennium Summit to intensify their\r\nefforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council in all its aspects. To date, their\r\nresolve is yet to be translated into definitive progress.\r\nWhile reform of the Council is arguably the most\r\ncomplex and difficult of decisions for the Organization,\r\nwithout minimizing the complexities involved, it is a\r\ndecision we cannot escape. The alternative would be to\r\nmaintain the status quo and risk the erosion of what the\r\nSecretary-General has described as the great strength\r\nof the United Nations — its legitimacy.\r\nA loss of legitimacy will be detrimental to the\r\nUnited Nations and will undermine its effectiveness.\r\nHowever, with a Security Council that remains\r\nessentially wedded to the past, the risk of such a loss\r\nhas grown. With the membership of the Organization\r\nexpanding over the past half century, the Council has\r\nbecome increasingly less representative and\r\nincreasingly more inequitable in its composition. The\r\nneed for the Council to be adapted to contemporary\r\nrealities can no longer be ignored.\r\nAfter more than 10 years of discussion, positions\r\non reform of the Council, including that of my own\r\ndelegation, are now well known. Nevertheless, there is\r\nevidence of a growing inclination for change. Guyana\r\nremains steadfast in its view that the veto should be\r\neliminated or at least significantly curtailed. Its\r\nlimitation to matters under Chapter VII of the Charter\r\ncould be an important first step in that regard. We have\r\ncalled for expansion of seats in both the permanent and\r\nnon-permanent categories. In respect of new permanent\r\nmembers, my Government has so far pronounced its\r\nviews only with respect to developing country\r\naspirants. Guyana’s Foreign Minister, Mr. Rudy\r\nInsanally, speaking in the general debate in September,\r\nstated at the 15th meeting:\r\n“After careful deliberation ... my Government has\r\ndecided at this stage to support the aspirations of\r\nBrazil, India and an African State to permanent\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nmembership. We believe that their participation\r\nas developing States in the work of the Council\r\nwill make that body more balanced,\r\nrepresentative and, ultimately, more accountable\r\nto the Assembly for the maintenance of global\r\npeace and security.”\r\nFurthermore, we continue to hold to the view that in an\r\nexpansion of the category of permanent members there\r\nshould be no distinction with respect to rights and\r\nprivileges between the current and new permanent\r\nmembers. Finally, my delegation also considers that\r\nany agreement reached on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil should be subject to review after some time\r\nhas elapsed, perhaps after 10 to 15 years.\r\nIn conclusion, it is clear that difficult\r\ncompromises will need to be made if the Security\r\nCouncil is to become more representative, democratic,\r\ntransparent and effective. Guyana shares the view that\r\nthe year ahead could be an opportunity to take\r\nimportant decisions that will lead us to the early\r\nachievement of that goal. It is incumbent on Member\r\nStates to summon the political will to move forward,\r\ntaking due account of the various interests and\r\nconcerns represented in this forum. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\r\nChange may yet facilitate our task in this respect.\r\nNana Effah-Apenteng (Ghana): At the outset,\r\nallow me to express my appreciation to Ambassador\r\nSir Emyr Jones Parry, representative of the United\r\nKingdom and President of the Security Council for this\r\nmonth, for his introduction of the annual report of the\r\nSecurity Council for the period 1 August 2003 to\r\n31 July 2004. Taken as a whole, the information\r\ndetailed in the report conveys a picture of the busy\r\nschedule that characterized the Council’s work during\r\nthe period.\r\nMy delegation would like to express its continued\r\nappreciation for the Council’s focus on peacekeeping\r\nand its comprehensive approach to dealing with the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, for\r\nwhich it has the primary responsibility. We are\r\nespecially encouraged by the Council’s sustained\r\nattention to conflict prevention, resolution and\r\nmanagement. We urge it to continue to focus its\r\nattention on those issues, given the gravity, complexity\r\nand multifaceted nature of the problems and conflicts\r\nbedevilling various regions, and the sine qua non of\r\npeace and security in the quest to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment and stability. In that connection, we\r\nreiterate the need for the Council to continue to\r\nenhance cooperation with the General Assembly, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and other development\r\nbodies, given the well known interrelationship between\r\npeace, security and development.\r\nMy delegation also notes with appreciation the\r\ncontinued devotion of most of the Security Council’s\r\nefforts to the African region. That has been evident in\r\nits various public meetings on several conflict\r\nsituations on the continent, such as those in Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nthe Sudan, the establishment of United Nations\r\nmissions in Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire and Liberia and\r\nalso its visiting mission to West Africa from 20 to\r\n29 June 2004. It is our hope that such a devotion of\r\ntime and effort will translate into concrete and\r\nappropriate solutions — coupled with the requisite\r\npolitical will and resources — to the conflicts plaguing\r\nthe region. Also, as my delegation had occasion to\r\npoint out last year, for visiting missions to have more\r\nimpact they should be of longer duration and not\r\ninvolve visits to too many countries in one short trip.\r\nFurther, we welcome the continuing consultations\r\nand complementary initiatives that the Council has\r\nembarked on with regional and subregional institutions\r\nand we encourage the Council to stay on course. We\r\nare of the firm conviction that such partnerships\r\nbetween subregional and regional organizations, such\r\nas the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) and the African Union, could go a long\r\nway in helping to find lasting solutions to the\r\nprevention, management and resolution of conflicts in\r\nAfrica. Ghana, in its capacity as Chair of ECOWAS,\r\nwould like to signal that organization’s desire to\r\ncooperate with the international community to identify\r\nways in which vital partnerships can prevent, combat\r\nand eradicate illicit brokering in small arms and light\r\nweapons in the West African region. The leadership\r\nand membership of the organization, while counting on\r\nbeneficial collaboration with others, remain committed\r\nto their own projected constructive engagement.\r\nI would like to recall that in earlier years, my\r\ndelegation added its voice to the call for more\r\ninformation in the Security Council report concerning\r\nits missions to conflict areas to acquire firsthand\r\ninformation, if, as we thought it should, the Council\r\nwas going to continue to rely on this system of Council\r\nmissions. Permit me to congratulate the members of\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nthe Security Council for improvements in that regard\r\nover the past two years, as the present report presents a\r\nmuch more detailed account of those visits.\r\nOver the years, my delegation has been among\r\nthose calling for further improvement in the report,\r\nprocedures and working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil. We wish to commend the Council for keeping\r\nthe new format that it has used in recent years, which is\r\nmore compact and reader-friendly. However, there is\r\nmuch more to be done to improve upon the analytical\r\nframework. This year’s report is again characterized by\r\na dearth of the requisite information needed to\r\neffectively evaluate the Council’s work. Similarly, the\r\nrather late publication of the report leaves much to be\r\ndesired. This has been done in spite of concerns\r\nexpressed previously by various delegations about the\r\napparent contradiction between its contents, which\r\nremain little more than a simple outline of events with\r\nscanty analysis or explanations of the Council’s actions\r\nand decisions, and the amount of time needed to\r\nprocess it. We would like to see this Charter obligation\r\nperformed in a much more satisfactory manner.\r\nWe are encouraged by the number of open\r\nmeetings and monthly briefings given by Presidents of\r\nthe Council, as well as by the periodic wrap-up\r\nsessions, to which non-Member States have been\r\ninvited. The open meetings should not be seen simply\r\nas a matter of “going through the motions”. To be\r\nuseful, the views expressed by Member States should\r\nbe taken into account in the real decisions of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nElsewhere, we wish to commend the Council for\r\nits pivotal role in the global campaign against terrorism\r\nin all its forms and manifestations. The Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee has been an example of\r\ntransparency, and we commend it for its efforts in that\r\ndirection.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group has been seized\r\nwith the task of considering all aspects of the question\r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and other related\r\nmatters since December 1993, with little progress with\r\nregard to the Cluster I issues. My delegation believes\r\nthat the overdue reforms in terms of expansion,\r\ndecision-making and periodic review of the Council\r\ncould be resolved within a more democratic,\r\ncooperative, equitable and geographically\r\nrepresentative framework, reflecting the kind of\r\nmultilateralism that is required in contemporary times.\r\nIt remains an issue of concern that ten years after\r\nthe establishment of the Open-ended Working Group\r\nso much substantial progress remains to be made. As\r\nthe events of the past few years indicate, a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Council is crucial if its\r\ndecisions are to continue to enjoy the support of the\r\nlarger membership.\r\nIn this connection, we wholly subscribe to the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement’s (NAM) statement on all\r\naspects of the question of increase in the membership\r\nof the Security Council, complemented by the African\r\nposition on the same issue, as expressed in the Harare\r\nDeclaration adopted by the Organization for African\r\nUnity in June 1997. Africa’s claim to have at least two\r\npermanent seats on a rotational basis, even as it seeks\r\nan expansion of the Council in both the permanent and\r\nnon-permanent categories, should be adequately\r\naddressed, since it is the largest regional group in the\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe also endorse the NAM proposal that a\r\nperiodic review of the structure and functioning of the\r\nSecurity Council is necessary in order to enable it to\r\nrespond better and more effectively to the new\r\nchallenges in global relations, especially with regard to\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nGhana shares the view that, on the Cluster II\r\nissues, increased transparency and improved working\r\nmethods of the Security Council are crucial to ensure\r\nthat body’s accountability to the wider membership of\r\nthe United Nations. We welcome the various\r\nimprovements in the Council’s working methods,\r\nincluding increased use of public meetings,\r\nconsultations with regional organizations and the\r\nstrengthening of consultations between troop-\r\ncontributing countries, the Council and the Secretariat.\r\nWhile commending these improvements, we must\r\nbe quick to add that certain methods of the Council,\r\nlike discrimination between Members and non-\r\nMembers of the Council on time limits for statements,\r\nhave often resulted in the unjustifiable exclusion of the\r\nwider membership from effectively articulating their\r\nviews on specific projects pursued by the Council.\r\nIt is primarily through a restructuring of the\r\nCouncil along these lines that perceptions of selectivity\r\nin dealing with issues of international peace and\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nsustainable development can be avoided, and the\r\ncauses of conflicts, whenever and wherever they occur,\r\ncan be dealt with in an effective and impartial manner.\r\nIn this regard, we look forward to the report of the\r\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change\r\nset up by the Secretary-General to examine the threats\r\nwe face and to evaluate existing policies, processes and\r\nmechanisms. The recommendations the Panel submits\r\nmust take into account the principles of sovereign\r\nequality of States and equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation, based on principles enshrined in the\r\nCharter, in order to enjoy the full confidence of\r\nMember States.\r\nThere is no gainsaying the fact that these have\r\nbeen very trying times for the United Nations in the\r\narea of peace and security. Our Organization is hard\r\npressed to reassert its indisputable relevance in the\r\npresent global context. The world desires a United\r\nNations that is, and is seen to be an instrument for\r\nachieving common ends towards a just and stable\r\nworld order.\r\nTo conclude, my delegation wishes to restate the\r\nimperative need for enhancing the credibility of the\r\nCouncil through substantive reform, guided by the\r\nprinciples of democracy, the sovereign equality of\r\nStates and equitable geographical representation, so as\r\nto enable it to better carry out its Charter obligations.\r\nMr. Paolillo (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): Some\r\ntime ago, in the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters related to the Security Council, Uruguay\r\nsuggested the Group consider new ideas for reform, for\r\nit had become clear that, after years of consultations\r\nand unsuccessful negotiations, no agreement would be\r\nreached if we persisted in working on the same basis,\r\non the same proposals as had been proposed in 1993,\r\nwhen the Group began its work.\r\nDespite genuine efforts on the part of successive\r\nChairmen of the Group, to whom my delegation is\r\ndeeply grateful, the negotiations have proved fruitless\r\nso far. In our opinion, this is due to the fact that, over\r\nthe years, the objectives we have sought in this\r\nexercise have lost clarity and transparency. It is time to\r\nclearly define what the objectives are and to designate\r\npriorities among them.\r\nThe original declared purpose of the reform was\r\nto adjust the composition and working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council to fit current political realities in\r\norder to turn that body into an instrument better\r\nequipped to respond to current threats to international\r\npeace and security. To achieve this objective, we have\r\nsaid time and again, even ad nauseam, that we must\r\nmake the Council a more efficient, democratic and\r\nrepresentative body.\r\nBut, a second objective has now emerged. Some\r\ncountries, willing to assume greater international\r\nresponsibilities, would wish to be given a bigger role in\r\nthe work of the Council and more influence in its\r\ndecisions on international peace and security.\r\nUruguay acknowledges the legitimacy of both\r\nobjectives. Naturally, we fully agree with the need to\r\nreform the structure and working methods of the\r\nCouncil to bring it in line with today’s international\r\nrealities. Furthermore, we understand the aspirations of\r\nthose States that wish to assume greater\r\nresponsibilities, those that have the will and that are in\r\na position to do so, and that wish to increase their\r\npresence and participation in the Council. But we have\r\nto be very careful in choosing the means through which\r\nwe intend to achieve these two objectives, since they\r\nmight be incompatible, or one might interfere with the\r\nother.\r\nThe fact that we are simultaneously pursuing\r\nthese two different and sometimes incompatible\r\nobjectives has yielded a number of paradoxes and\r\ncontradictions. For example, the first contradiction is\r\nthat, while we do not stop repeating our intention to\r\nmake the Council a more democratic body, some States\r\nthat are working towards the second objective are\r\nseeking to increase the number of permanent members,\r\nwhich implies extending permanent membership to\r\nsome new States and thereby extending to them the\r\nright of veto, which is the most undemocratic of all\r\nprivileges.\r\nThe second contradiction would be that, while we\r\nstress the need for a more effective Security Council,\r\nsome countries are proposing expansions that would\r\nincrease membership to 30 or more; this would\r\nundoubtedly affect its ability to function effectively.\r\nSuch a move would accentuate the deliberative\r\ncharacter of the Council at the expense of its executive\r\nnature, thus protracting negotiations, making the path\r\nto agreements more difficult, and weakening the\r\ncontent of its decisions.\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nThe third contradiction is that, while we speak of\r\nthe urgent need to make the Council more\r\nrepresentative, we have not formalized the one idea\r\nthat would undoubtedly help us attain that objective\r\nand on which we all agree, namely to increase the\r\nnumber of non-permanent members. There are not, and\r\nhave not been, any diverging views in that respect. Not\r\na single country is opposed to increasing the number of\r\nnon-permanent members. However, despite that\r\ngeneral agreement, and despite the need to give the\r\nCouncil greater legitimacy and make it more\r\nrepresentative, that idea has been held hostage to other,\r\ninfinitely more controversial ideas.\r\nThat is all the more regrettable because, had we,\r\nat the beginning of consultations on this question,\r\ndecided on an increase of, say, 10 new non-permanent\r\nmembers — a number that would probably be\r\nacceptable to all — over 50 countries would have\r\nparticipated in the work of the Council as non-\r\npermanent members over the past 10 years, in addition\r\nto the 50 that actually have done so.\r\nWe are pleased that some new ideas have been\r\nproposed lately that give us hope that we might finally\r\nachieve agreement on reforming the Council. Uruguay\r\nhas always been very flexible on that issue. We are\r\ntherefore ready to consider any proposals for reform\r\nthat are designed not only to increase the democratic\r\nrepresentativity of the Council but also to satisfy the\r\naspirations of those States that are willing to shoulder\r\ngreater responsibilities by increasing their presence on\r\nand participation in the Council, provided, of course,\r\nthat there is no impact on either the democratic nature\r\nof the Council or the principle of the sovereign\r\nequality of all Member States — the principle\r\ngoverning equitable representation and equal rights in\r\ninternational organizations.\r\nWith that understanding, we are ready to consider\r\nproposals that include more extended or frequent terms\r\nfor some of the States that might take the new seats in\r\nan expanded Council. In any event, selection of new\r\nmembers should occur within the context of their\r\nrespective regions, with due regard, of course — as set\r\nout in the provisions of Article 23 of the Charter\r\nrelating to non-permanent members — for their\r\ncontributions to the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, and I refer here to contributions in the\r\nbroadest sense of the term, not just financial.\r\nIn view of the difficulties that have prevented the\r\nattainment of a general agreement after 12 years of\r\nconsultations, Uruguay believes that we must change\r\nthe approach to the reform process and try to move\r\nforward in stages, gradually formalizing those reforms\r\nthat are already agreed by all Members.\r\nUruguay will continue to participate in efforts to\r\nreform the Council. We will be flexible, but we will\r\nalways remember that it is necessary to preserve intact\r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Berruga (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): At the\r\noutset, we should like to thank Ambassador Sir Emyr\r\nJones Parry, Permanent Representative of the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, for the\r\npresentation, in his capacity as President of the\r\nSecurity Council, of the annual report on the activities\r\nof the Council.\r\nThe report that the Security Council submits to\r\nthe General Assembly represents one of the most\r\nimportant sources of information for the Members of\r\nthe Organization that do not participate in the decision-\r\nmaking process of that organ, as it helps them to know\r\nthe status of different issues under consideration.\r\nMexico has stressed that this report should\r\nbecome increasingly substantial and analytical in\r\nnature in order to complement the efforts of other\r\norgans of the United Nations system.\r\nThe division of competencies among the principal\r\norgans of the United Nations, as provided for in the\r\nCharter, bestows concurrent powers on the Council and\r\nthe General Assembly in the context of the\r\npreservation of international peace and security. There\r\ncan be no doubt that those provisions give the Council\r\nspecial powers vis-à-vis those of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nNevertheless, the Security Council has a\r\nresponsibility to the whole of the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations in the exercise of its duties.\r\nConsequently, Members recognize the fact that the\r\nSecurity Council acts in their name when fulfilling the\r\nfunctions imposed on it by that responsibility. That is\r\nthe source of the legitimacy and value of its decisions.\r\nThat responsibility also entails an obligation to\r\nprovide substantive information about the measures\r\nthat it has decided to take in order to maintain or\r\nrestore peace and security, in accordance with Articles\r\n24 and 15 of the Charter. Those two articles state that\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nthe General Assembly will receive and consider annual\r\nand special reports from the Security Council.\r\nOriginally, both articles were proposed with the\r\nintention of giving the General Assembly the right to\r\nvalidate the actions of the Security Council. Because of\r\nopposition by the great Powers to that initiative, no\r\nclear commitment was made for the Security Council\r\nto be accountable to the General Assembly. The\r\ncontent of both provisions, which is certainly\r\nambiguous, reflects that tension.\r\nIn practical terms, we can see that the result has\r\nbeen a rather pro forma, rather than substantive,\r\ncompliance with the requirement that the Security\r\nCouncil submit reports to the General Assembly. That\r\nimplies, in other words, the absence of an effective\r\nsystem of accountability. That shortcoming should be\r\nremedied in order to permit the adequate functioning of\r\nour collective security system.\r\nIndeed, accountability is a powerful reminder of\r\nthe shared responsibility and the cooperation that are\r\nrequired today to address the trans-national threats that\r\nwe all face.\r\nThe importance of the responsibility conferred on\r\nan organ of limited composition such as the Security\r\nCouncil should be sufficient reason for the existence of\r\nan effective accountability system. The absence of such\r\na system gives the impression that the members of the\r\nSecurity Council do not need the collaboration or\r\ncooperation of the rest of the membership, and that\r\nimpedes the functioning of a collective security\r\nsystem.\r\nAs stated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of\r\nMexico at the 10th meeting, during the general debate,\r\nMexico favours “a regionally equitable and balanced\r\nenlargement of the number of elected members, based\r\non modalities determined within the regional groups”\r\nand a guarantee of equal opportunities for all.\r\nIn that context, Mexico would favour proposals to\r\nincrease the number of elected members, with longer\r\nmandates and with the possibility of immediate re-\r\nelection, because we believe that this would strengthen\r\naccountability, which we consider indispensable to the\r\nwork of the Security Council. A proposal of this kind,\r\nof course, would require amending Article 23 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nMexico views the reform of the Security Council\r\nas a necessary element, but one that is part of a larger\r\nprocess — that is, United Nations reform. An effective\r\ncollective security system necessarily involves the\r\nstrengthening of multilateralism and of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThat is why Mexico believes that the reform of\r\nthe Security Council should not be centred exclusively\r\non increasing the number of its members. Resolving\r\nthis issue, as important as it is, will not in itself help to\r\ntackle the great challenges and dilemmas faced by the\r\nOrganization. No institution exists that can improve its\r\nperformance and fulfil its mandate through a simple\r\nincrease in its membership.\r\nIt is a fact that, for more than a decade, States\r\nhave focused all their attention on the arguments\r\nregarding the Council’s lack of representativity in its\r\ncurrent composition, to such a point that it is believed\r\nthat the collective security system will automatically\r\nbe strengthened by an increase in the number of\r\npermanent members of the Security Council. Mexico is\r\nmore convinced than ever that such a hypothesis is\r\nbaseless.\r\nWe are faced with a paradox. Expanding the\r\nSecurity Council has the purpose of increasing its\r\nlegitimacy and making it more representative and\r\ninclusive, so that an ever larger number of countries\r\nmay participate and cooperate in the work of\r\nmaintaining peace and security. But allocating seats to\r\na limited number of new permanent members would\r\nresult in decision-making being concentrated in fewer\r\ncountries, not more. Such a concentration of power\r\nwould become even greater if the new permanent\r\nmembers have veto power, which would obstruct\r\ndecision-making gradually and diminish effective\r\ncontribution by all Member States in the work of the\r\nOrganization. We therefore agree with the thesis joint\r\nproposal by Australia, Canada and New Zealand that\r\nreform should contemplate an increase in non-\r\npermanent members so that opportunities may be\r\nexpanded and not reduced.\r\nIn Mexico’s view, the logical order of the\r\ndiscussion has been inverted. The recent tendency has\r\nbeen to first discuss the size and composition of the\r\nCouncil, postponing until later a discussion of the\r\nmechanisms and functions that the Council needs in\r\norder to effectively fulfil its mandate to preserve\r\ninternational peace and security. Any exercise aimed at\r\nreviewing the composition of the Security Council\r\nmust first identify the substantive institutional changes\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\ndemanded by the emergence of new threats, if we want\r\na collective security system that can meet current\r\nchallenges.\r\nIt is clear that the deliberations of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters Related to the\r\nSecurity Council have arrived at a point of saturation.\r\nMexico believes that a new methodology should be\r\ndesigned to redirect the debate.\r\nThat is why, in his statement to the General\r\nAssembly at its 10th plenary meeting, the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Mexico proposed the convening of a\r\nGeneral Conference, under Article 109 of the Charter,\r\nin order to tackle each and every issue of the\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Organization and to reach\r\ngeneral agreement, as established by General Assembly\r\nresolution 53/30. Mexico will present, in the group of\r\nfriends established for this purpose, proposals that are\r\nadequately far-reaching. The danger and global reach\r\nof these new threats constitute a powerful incentive to\r\nstart this second major stage in the history of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThrough a General Conference, Member States\r\nwill have the opportunity to propose the changes and\r\nadditions the United Nations needs in order to offer\r\ndynamic and effective responses to the great challenges\r\nto peace and development. In that way, the\r\ninternational community will be able to adopt formulas\r\nand mechanisms that are clearly relevant to fulfilling\r\nthe objectives that we share in this Organization.\r\nAs a catalyst for these discussions, Mexico hopes\r\nthat the elements to be set out in the forthcoming report\r\nof the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\r\nChange will be especially helpful, considering the high\r\nqualifications and experience of its members as well as\r\nthe Panel’s independent nature. Through this\r\ndiscussion, we will be in a position to reform the\r\nSecurity Council with the assurance that we have not\r\nbeen mistaken or, even worse, headed in the wrong\r\ndirection.\r\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia) (spoke in French): First of\r\nall, Mr. President, allow me to congratulate you on the\r\nmanner in which you are guiding this debate. My\r\ndelegation also thanks Ambassador Sir Emyr Jones\r\nParry, Permanent Representative of the United\r\nKingdom and President of the Security Council for the\r\ncurrent month, for introducing the report of the\r\nSecurity Council (A/59/2) submitted to the General\r\nAssembly in accordance with the relevant provisions of\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nHaving studied the report of the Security Council,\r\nmy delegation would like to offer the following\r\nobservations. This agenda item on the report of the\r\nSecurity Council represents a valuable opportunity to\r\nconsider in depth the work of the Council and to\r\nidentify steps that should be taken to improve the\r\nworking methods of that important organ.\r\nRegarding the format of the report, my delegation\r\nwelcomes the fact that this is a shorter document,\r\ncontaining an analytical introduction and a statistical\r\nsection. However, efforts must continue to further\r\nimprove the quality of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil. It still seems to be a compilation of decisions\r\nand resolutions that have been adopted, along with a\r\nrather factual account of the work of the body.\r\nRegarding the working methods of the Council, I\r\nam pleased to see that during the reporting period, the\r\nSecurity Council held a large number of public\r\nmeetings, in which many States participated. We\r\nwelcome the increase in the number of public\r\ninformation meetings organized by the Secretariat.\r\nThey provide non-members of the Council with an\r\nopportunity to be better informed on how certain\r\nmatters before the Security Council are developing.\r\nHowever, there is still much to be done to make\r\nthe workings of the Council even more transparent for\r\nus as Member States. We remain concerned by the fact\r\nthat members of the Council, particularly permanent\r\nmembers, are still able to unilaterally decide whether\r\nor not to organize public meetings, even when such\r\nmeetings are requested by a country or a group of\r\ncountries. Certain States calling into question the right\r\nof a country to participate in a public meeting on an\r\nitem of great concern to it is not likely to enhance the\r\ncredibility and effectiveness of the Security Council.\r\nTurning to the substance of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council, we see that the Council has not only\r\nresponded to threats to international and regional peace\r\nand security, but has also dealt directly, firmly and with\r\ndetermination with a number of conflicts in Africa,\r\ninter alia by sending Council missions to the field.\r\nHowever, on the matter of the Middle East, the\r\nCouncil’s efforts have not lived up to expectations.\r\nFrustration over the repeated inability of the Council to\r\nbecome more involved in a settlement of the question\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nof Palestine is a serious threat to the region and to the\r\nauthority of the Security Council.\r\nOn another matter, the repeated but selective use\r\nof Chapter VII of the Charter is becoming rather\r\nconfusing. There is a danger that this might discredit\r\nChapter VII and, indeed, other chapters dealing with\r\nthe maintenance of peace and security.\r\nRegarding agenda item 53, on the question of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters, Mr. President, I would first of all like to pay\r\ntribute to your predecessor, the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session, and to his\r\ntwo Co-Chairmen of the Open-ended Working Group\r\nfor their outstanding contribution to our consideration\r\nof the item under discussion today. The crucial\r\nimportance of reforming the Security Council has been\r\nreiterated annually since the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup was established to deal with this matter in all its\r\naspects in 1993. We are certainly well aware of the\r\ndelicate and complex nature of this task, but we feel\r\nthat we must achieve a comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council as soon as possible and that we must\r\nwork even more intensively to that end.\r\nThere are new challenges in the world today, and\r\nso we must work together, within the United Nations,\r\nwhich is, after all, still the best framework for bringing\r\ntogether all of our efforts to ensure peace and security.\r\nIt is also the source of international legality to which\r\nall States, without exception, must commit themselves.\r\nFaced with these challenges, the Security Council must\r\nimmediately win back the trust of States and of world\r\npublic opinion, not only by showing that it is able to\r\neffectively tackle the most difficult issues, but by\r\nbecoming more widely representative of the\r\ninternational community as a whole and of the\r\ngeopolitical realities of the world today.\r\nThe rich and varied proposals presented to us up\r\nuntil now contain the elements we need to act on those\r\nissues. However, since 1993, the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup addressing that issue has not been able to draft a\r\nspecific formula that is universally accepted.\r\nDespite the initiative of President Hunte during\r\nthe fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly to\r\nlaunch a lively discussion on six major themes relating\r\nto the general reform of the Security Council, the\r\nreport before us is still only a simple compilation of\r\nideas and proposals such as we have been receiving for\r\nmany years.\r\nThat does not mean we do not recognize the\r\nprogress that has been made in some aspects of\r\nCouncil reform. Indeed, the deliberations of the Open-\r\nended Working Group have enabled us, during those\r\nyears, to identify a number of elements that are widely\r\nsupported by the majority of States.\r\nIt is thus clear that we have certain elements that\r\ncould be used as the foundation for a solution that is\r\nacceptable to all Member States. It is also clear that\r\nwhat is lacking is not ideas or proposals, but the\r\nnecessary political will to accomplish the undertaking,\r\nas well as a specific commitment towards that end.\r\nWe are confident that you, Sir, will do your\r\nutmost to ensure that we move forward on the path\r\nbefore us.\r\nTunisia has participated in all sessions of the\r\nWorking Group since its inception, and we continue to\r\nstand by our position, which we have often stated. My\r\ncountry believes the goal of the reform is to strengthen\r\ndemocratic and fair representation within the Council\r\nand to enhance its credibility and effectiveness.\r\nThe Council must reflect the political and\r\neconomic realities of the world today. It must have the\r\nnecessary democratic legitimacy to act on behalf of the\r\ninternational community in discharging its mandate\r\nunder the Charter.\r\nIts objectives can not be reached, unless there is\r\nan increase in both categories of membership —\r\npermanent and non-permanent. Equally important, the\r\nsize of a restructured Council must allow for a genuine\r\ndemocratic representation of the developing countries.\r\nIn that context, Tunisia still supports the position\r\nof Africa, which has remained unchanged to this day\r\nand which is reflected clearly and unambiguously in\r\nthe Harare Declaration of 4 June 1997 — adopted by\r\nthe thirty-third Assembly of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity. The\r\nDeclaration states that the number of members of the\r\nCouncil should be increased in both categories and that\r\nthe African continent should be allocated two\r\npermanent seats. Those seats would be allocated by a\r\ndecision of Africans themselves, in accordance with a\r\nsystem of rotation based on the current criteria of the\r\nAfrican Union and subsequent elements that might\r\nimprove upon those criteria. Africa will prove able, as\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nit always has been, to reach agreement on the\r\nallocation of seats allocated to it and will do so without\r\nundue haste.\r\nThe new permanent members must have the same\r\nprivileges and powers as the current permanent\r\nmembers. The permanent members would be proposed\r\nby their respective regions and would be elected by the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nConcerning the power of veto, my delegation\r\nendorses the position of the Non-Aligned Movement,\r\nnamely, that the veto should be limited to measures\r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter. It goes without\r\nsaying that a positive and constructive attitude\r\nconcerning the question, on the part of the permanent\r\nmembers of the Council, would be crucial.\r\nLastly, the question of periodic review of the\r\nreformed Security Council is an indispensable element\r\nin the reform programme and must be taken seriously.\r\nThe review would be envisaged as a confidence-\r\nbuilding measure and would permit us to make any\r\nnecessary adjustments in future. But even more\r\nimportantly, it would be the mechanism whereby we\r\nwould be able to evaluate the contribution of new\r\nmembers towards enhancing the effectiveness of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation will continue to\r\nstrongly support any proposal realistically dedicated to\r\nthe representativeness, transparency or democratization\r\nof the Security Council. We trust the current debate in\r\nthe Assembly on this important item will provide a\r\nmeaningful contribution to the substantive debate that\r\nwe will have, following publication of the report of the\r\nHigh-level Panel.\r\nMr. Ahamed (India): We welcome the\r\nopportunity to participate in the joint debate under\r\nagenda item 11: Report of the Security Council, and\r\nagenda item 53: Question of equitable representation\r\non and increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and related matters.\r\nI join other speakers before me in thanking\r\nAmbassador Sir Emyr Jones Parry, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom and President of\r\nthe Security Council, for his presentation of the report\r\nof the Council for the period 1 August 2003 to 31 July\r\n2004, to the General Assembly.\r\nIn the recent past, the Security Council has\r\nwitnessed a substantial increase in the range of issues\r\nbrought before it for its consideration. The end of the\r\ncold war and the advent of the twenty-first century\r\nhave brought to the fore new threats and challenges to\r\ninternational peace and security. Some of the threats,\r\nrepresented by an increasing number of inter and intra-\r\nState conflicts, have evoked standard responses in the\r\nform of measures aimed at conflict prevention,\r\npeacekeeping, peace-building, transitional justice and\r\npost-conflict national reconciliation.\r\nOthers are less direct and, in their ambiguity,\r\npose a greater danger to the international order. Those\r\ninclude international terrorism, the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction into the hands of non-\r\nState actors, international crime and narcotics. Those\r\nissues require a very different response, the mechanics\r\nof which we are still working out.\r\nThe Council has had to act decisively to deal with\r\nthe new threats. They have placed enormous burdens\r\non the existing system of collective security,\r\nsometimes straining it to the breaking point. The\r\nability of the Council to act effectively and responsibly\r\nin the future will provide an important reassurance for\r\nthe international community that its concerns in the\r\narea of security are being adequately addressed.\r\nThat calls not only for greater political will and\r\nunity on issues, but for the perception that the\r\ndecisions taken by the Council largely reflect the\r\nconcerns and aspirations of the general membership. A\r\ngreater democratization of the existing order, increased\r\ntransparency of its actions and the co-option of\r\ndifferent ideas, interests and sensitivities will be\r\nessential in order for the endeavour to succeed over\r\ntime.\r\nOf late, the Security Council has increasingly\r\nappropriated legislative and treaty-making powers, as\r\nreflected in many of its decisions. Security Council\r\nresolutions 1373 (2001) and 1540 (2004) were\r\nexceptional. But such actions should remain exceptions\r\nand not develop into norms. By increasingly resorting\r\nto resolutions and enforcement actions under Chapter\r\nVII of the Charter, even on matters that are better\r\nresolved through multilateral cooperation, the efforts of\r\nthe Council can often become counter-productive. The\r\nCouncil can best succeed in implementing of its\r\nactions only when its decisions are taken through a\r\nprocess of consultations with the wider Membership.\r\nMy delegation views with concern the tendency\r\nof the Council to adopt decisions on issues that affect\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nthe wider Membership of the United Nations without\r\ntaking into account the views of the States concerned.\r\nWe call upon the Council to ensure that it provides\r\nadequate opportunity for the views of the wider\r\nMembership to be heard on important issues, through\r\ntransparent mechanisms such as open debates, before\r\ndecisions on such issues are taken.\r\nA majority of delegations have expressed concern\r\nover the lack of transparency in the work of the\r\nCouncil during the debate under this item at the last\r\nsession of the General Assembly. Unfortunately,\r\nhowever, the Council appears to have paid very little\r\nattention to those concerns. We had specifically\r\nrecommended that the Council, in the interest of\r\ndemocratizating its work, eliminate the selectivity\r\ncurrently applied with respect to participation under\r\nrule 37 of the Council’s rules of procedure. Yet, in a\r\nrecent instance, only one representative of a certain\r\ngroup of nations was permitted to express his views on\r\nan issue that, in our view, affected all States.\r\nWe have also spoken against the distinct lack of\r\ntransparency in scheduling open and public meetings\r\nof the Council. With the exception of unforeseen\r\ndevelopments, the Council has little reason not to\r\ndisclose its full intentions for public and open events in\r\nits calendar, which is released at the beginning of every\r\nmonth. This inexplicable lack of transparency can only\r\ngive rise to misgivings on the part of the wider\r\nmembership and perpetuate an impression of the\r\nCouncil acting as an entity separate from the wider\r\nmembership in both representation and intention.\r\nMoreover, we have drawn attention in the past to\r\nthe increased number of thematic debates in the\r\nCouncil on issues that very often fall within the\r\npurview of the General Assembly or the Economic and\r\nSocial Council. We have recommended that such\r\ninstances be restricted in the interests of a more\r\nefficient use of the Council’s time in dealing with the\r\npressing issues and to ensure a more productive\r\noutcome when such thematic issues are of direct\r\nrelevance to the Council’s work. It is high time, in our\r\nview, that thematic debates be held in the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nIt is an inescapable conclusion that the Security\r\nCouncil will be truly effective and respected for its\r\ndecisions only if it represents, and is seen to represent,\r\nthe interests of the larger membership. A perusal of the\r\nitems on the Council’s agenda will reveal that the\r\nmajority of issues under its consideration pertain to the\r\ndeveloping world. Yet, developing countries account\r\nfor less than half of the Council’s membership during\r\nthe best of times. This discrepancy becomes far more\r\nacute when the composition of the permanent\r\nmembership is examined in isolation.\r\nThere is universal recognition of the critical need\r\nto undertake a comprehensive reform of the United\r\nNations system in order to forge a stronger and more\r\neffective multilateralism. This reform cannot be limited\r\nor unidirectional, but must be inclusive and all-\r\nencompassing. It should include such elements as the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, strengthening\r\nof the Economic and Social Council, reform of the\r\nSecretariat machinery, reform of the planning and\r\nbudgetary process and, above all, an expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council and reform of its working methods\r\nand decision-making processes. This would also make\r\nit possible to restore responsibility for the economic\r\nagenda of the United Nations, apart from questions of\r\neffectiveness and authority, to the General Assembly.\r\nThe Security Council, as currently configured, is\r\nnot representative of contemporary realities. The Prime\r\nMinister of India touched upon this imbalance when he\r\nstated in his address to the Assembly on 23 September\r\nthat “An overwhelming majority of the world’s\r\npopulation cannot be excluded from an institution that\r\ntoday legislates on an increasing number of issues,\r\nwith an ever-widening impact” (A/59/PV.7). There has\r\nbeen a four-fold increase in the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations since its inception in 1945, including a\r\nsharp increase in the number of developing countries.\r\nThough the provisions of the Charter give the General\r\nAssembly great authority and primacy, these have been\r\neroded steadily over the past decade.\r\nThe permanent membership of the Security\r\nCouncil must have the critical mass to respond to the\r\naspirations for democracy of Member States and to act\r\naccordingly. In other words, without the inclusion and\r\npresence of developing countries in an expanded\r\nSecurity Council, all other reform elements aimed at\r\nrestoring the authority of the General Assembly would\r\nbe in vain.\r\nThe fact that the vast majority of the general\r\nmembership of the United Nations finds no\r\nrepresentation in the permanent member category, and\r\nis inadequately represented in the non-permanent\r\ncategory, is an anomaly that needs to be urgently\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nrectified if the Council’s decisions and actions are to be\r\nviewed as representative and legitimate. Additionally,\r\nnew players from the developed world have emerged,\r\nand it is important that they find their place in a\r\nrestructured Security Council.\r\nIt is imperative, therefore, that the Security\r\nCouncil be comprehensively reformed, including an\r\nexpansion of its membership in both the permanent and\r\nnon-permanent categories, and the inclusion of both\r\ndeveloping and developed countries as new permanent\r\nmembers. Any attempt to limit expansion solely to the\r\nnon-permanent category would be to fail to establish\r\nthe necessary representativeness within the Council.\r\nNor would the creation of new quasi-permanent seats\r\nbring about equitable representation or enhance the\r\nCouncil’s legitimacy, effectiveness or\r\nrepresentativeness. Such partial and piecemeal\r\nattempts would only serve to preserve the present\r\nstructure of the Council and would, in effect, erode its\r\ncredibility even further. Instead of correcting, they\r\nwould exacerbate current shortcomings in the\r\nCouncil’s structure and work.\r\nFor its part, India has expressed its readiness to\r\nassume its responsibility as a global player in an\r\nexpanded Security Council. We will work together with\r\nBrazil, Germany, Japan and a candidate from Africa in\r\nour quest to make the Security Council more\r\nrepresentative, legitimate and effective.\r\nMr. Pak Gil Yon (Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea): The Security Council is a body of the\r\nutmost importance which bears major responsibility for\r\nmaintaining international peace and security — even\r\nmore than the General Assembly.\r\nThe delegation of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea is of the view that the deliberation\r\nof the current agenda items is an important occasion\r\nfor the Security Council to review its annual work for\r\ninternational peace and security and to draw an\r\nappropriate lesson before the General Assembly,\r\nrepresenting all United Nations Member States.\r\nIn that context, my delegation would like to\r\npresent some views regarding the report of the Security\r\nCouncil, as well as the issue of the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, before the current session.\r\nFirst, it is important for the Security Council to\r\ntake measures to eliminate the unilateralism pursued by\r\nthe super-Power if it wishes to fulfil its mission for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, in line\r\nwith the United Nations Charter. Unilateralism\r\nruthlessly tramples down the most universal common\r\ninterests of the international community, as it is a\r\ndangerous doctrine pursued by the super-Power to seek\r\nthe establishment of a polar world order to subordinate\r\nall countries to its own interests.\r\nFor about a decade now, the Security Council has\r\nbeen deeply engaged in the question of Iraq, imposing\r\ninspections upon that country under the pretext of\r\npreventing the development of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction on behalf of the interests of the super-\r\nPower. Yet, it failed to prevent the unilateral\r\naggression against Iraq. Member States should draw a\r\ndue lesson therefrom.\r\nSecondly, the principle of impartiality should be\r\nobserved in all activities of the Security Council. The\r\nSecurity Council should not become an organ dealing\r\nonly with questions related to small and vulnerable\r\ncountries and resorting to sanctions and the use of\r\narmed forces. Instead, the Security Council should\r\nmake an issue of any country accountable for a breach\r\nof the peace, be it the super-Power or a country under\r\nthe protection of the super-Power, and take relevant\r\nsteps to assume with fairness its responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Only\r\nwhen equity is ensured in the activities of the Security\r\nCouncil can it resolve disputes smoothly, make a\r\nsubstantial contribution to international peace and\r\nsecurity and thus earn its credibility in the eyes of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nOver 10 years have passed since the General\r\nAssembly began its deliberations on the question of\r\nSecurity Council reform. However, the prospects for\r\nSecurity Council reform are still gloomy, and that\r\ndisheartens the overwhelming majority of the States\r\nMembers of the United Nations.\r\nEven a basic convergence on the simultaneous\r\nenlargement of the permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembership has not been reached regarding the\r\nexpansion of Security Council membership, which\r\nconstitutes a core of Security Council reform. Though\r\ncertain measures have been taken in terms of the\r\nimprovement of the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil, substantial measures — such as that allowing\r\nthe parties to conflicts to attend the relevant informal\r\nconsultations — have not yet been taken.\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nThat is due not to the lack of sufficient\r\nconsultations or reasonable proposals, but to the fact\r\nthat there are some Member States that do not have the\r\npolitical will to ensure the fair solution of the question\r\nof Security Council reform. Reality requires each\r\nMember country to take the position of putting aside its\r\ninterests and giving priority to the common interests of\r\nthe Member States in the deliberations on Security\r\nCouncil reform.\r\nThe delegation of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea should like to see the General\r\nAssembly take steps at this session to make substantial\r\nprogress towards the consideration of Security Council\r\nreform in 2005, on the occasion of the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the establishment of the United Nations,\r\nafter making a critical and objective analysis of the\r\npresent situation.\r\nIn that regard, we deem it necessary that all\r\nMember States gear their deliberations on Security\r\nCouncil reform towards ensuring the fully equitable\r\nnature of the Security Council in the resolution of\r\ninternational disputes. The reform of the Security\r\nCouncil should not be undertaken just for show by\r\nsimply increasing its membership or making some\r\nadjustments to its working methods. Instead, the\r\nreform should be a substantial one.\r\nThe delegation of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea believes that measures to eliminate\r\negocentric unilateralism — which uses the Security\r\nCouncil whenever necessary and rejects it relentlessly\r\nwhen there is no such necessity — should constitute\r\nthe core of reform.\r\nAs regards the enlargement of the composition of\r\nthe Security Council, priority should be attached to\r\nensuring the full representation of the developing\r\ncountries in the expansion of the permanent and the\r\nnon-permanent membership alike. It is essential for the\r\ndemocratization of the United Nations and the fair\r\nresolution of disputes that we ensure the full\r\nrepresentation of the developing countries, which\r\nconstitute the majority of the United Nations\r\nmembership.\r\nGiven the gloomy prospects for reaching any\r\nagreement on the enlargement of the permanent\r\nmembership, my delegation deems it realistic to\r\nincrease, for the time being, the non-permanent\r\nmembership. In so doing, we will serve the very\r\npurpose of reform by correcting the current imbalance\r\nin the composition of the Security Council and giving\r\nall Member States an equal opportunity to participate\r\nin the activities of the Security Council.\r\nUnlike the enlargement of the non-permanent\r\nmembership, the enlargement of the permanent\r\nmembership requires greater perseverance on the part\r\nof the Member States, as it involves such sensitive and\r\ncomplicated issues as the criteria for new permanent\r\nmembers, the extension of the veto power and so on.\r\nThat being so, one should not attempt to delay the\r\nprogress of overall Security Council reform on the\r\nbasis of the very issue of the enlargement of the\r\npermanent membership. Any attempt to do so is\r\nintended to counter genuine reform.\r\nFinally, the delegation of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea wishes to reiterate its stand that the\r\nreform of the Security Council should be undertaken\r\non the basis of ensuring the full representation of\r\nMember States in favour of the developing countries,\r\nand expresses its expectation that practical steps will\r\nbe taken towards that end.\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): Allow me at the outset to thank Ambassador\r\nSir Emyr Jones Parry, President of the Security Council\r\nfor this month, for submitting the report of the Security\r\nCouncil covering the period from August 2003 to July\r\n2004.\r\nI should like to reiterate on this occasion that the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s consideration of the Security\r\nCouncil’s report reaffirms the Assembly’s vital role in\r\nthe consideration of all issues under the Charter and\r\nprovides an opportunity for Member States to express\r\ntheir views on the work of the Security Council in\r\nfulfilling its primary responsibility for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. For Syria, the\r\nreport in part reflects the efforts that we made during\r\nour membership in the Council up until the end of last\r\nyear.\r\nUndoubtedly, over the reporting period the\r\nSecurity Council employed strenuous efforts in dealing\r\nwith the issues before it. It gave priority to regaining\r\nstability in conflict areas around the world. Perhaps\r\nmore than anything else, African issues enjoyed greater\r\nattention by the Council, which we are pleased to note.\r\nThe Council also increased the number of its\r\nopen meetings to achieve greater transparency in its\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nwork and to give other Member States the opportunity\r\nto express their views on the issues before it.\r\nIn that regard, it is regrettable that the Security\r\nCouncil has not been able to respond to the serious\r\nquestions raised by the events and circumstances we\r\nwitnessed over the reporting period and that have a\r\nbearing on its role and its effectiveness. Israeli\r\npractices in the occupied Palestinian territories\r\ndemonstrate the Council’s inability at times to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security or to put an end to\r\nIsraeli policies of aggression in the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories, which have been escalating\r\nowing to the impunity Israel enjoys within the Council.\r\nAnother matter of great concern is the Council’s\r\ndeviation from the principles of objectivity and its\r\nresort to double standards that could undermine its\r\nrole, as well as the international legitimacy of the\r\nsystem we respect. At a time when the Council has\r\nfailed to adopt important resolutions on issues that\r\nthreaten international peace and security because such\r\nresolutions were needlessly vetoed, the Security\r\nCouncil has taken decisions that were surprising to\r\nmany not only because they did not lie within its\r\nsphere of competence, but also because they\r\nrepresented interference in the internal affairs of a\r\nMember State, in contravention of the Charter. Such\r\nactions create an extremely dangerous precedent and\r\nraise serious questions as to the role and effectiveness\r\nof the Council. Arabs everywhere, their media and\r\ntheir intellectuals, seriously question the Security\r\nCouncil’s ability to face up to the challenges and\r\nresponsibilities before it. It is even more worrying as\r\nthe Council tends to legislate on many issues in a\r\nmanner that both contradicts its responsibilities and\r\nthat interferes with the work of the General Assembly.\r\nSyria’s continued support of the United Nations\r\nand its agencies is well known, as is its call for United\r\nNations resolutions to be implemented. However, that\r\ndoes not mean that we will not criticize mistakes when\r\nthey are made and, particularly, when double standards\r\nare applied in dealing with United Nations resolutions,\r\nor when adopted resolutions go beyond its sphere of\r\ncompetence and responsibility. I believe that this lies at\r\nthe heart of the issue of reform, which we are\r\nconsidering at present, in order to prevent the\r\nOrganization from becoming a tool in the hands of\r\ngreater Powers at the expense of the interests of lesser\r\nones.\r\nThe main objective of reform of the United\r\nNations is to promote its ability to face up to the new\r\nchallenges and threats confronting it. Reform must take\r\nas its fundamental basis a total commitment to the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter.\r\nWe eagerly await the results of the work of the\r\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change\r\nestablished by the Secretary-General, which has been\r\ntasked with considering current and future threats to\r\ninternational peace and security as well as the situation\r\nof the principal organs of the United Nations and the\r\nintroduction of proposals on enhancing their role. We\r\nlook forward to participating in the discussions among\r\nMember States on the Panel’s opinions and\r\nrecommendations.\r\nReforming the Security Council and expanding\r\nits membership should be part and parcel of a joint,\r\nintegrated project that takes into account equitable\r\ngeographical representation and establishes\r\ntransparency, accountability and democracy in the\r\nCouncil’s working methods, including in the decision-\r\nmaking process. Expansion of the Council in both the\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories should also\r\ntake into account the importance of equitable\r\nrepresentation for developing countries and should not\r\nmarginalize them in that process. Furthermore, it\r\nshould also be in line with the position of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement; it should be comprehensive and\r\nmove away from divisiveness, and should reflect the\r\nrole and viewpoints of regional groups. In that regard,\r\nwe would like to reaffirm the position that the Arab\r\nGroup has been reiterating for some time: the\r\nimportance in any future reform of the Security\r\nCouncil of allocating a permanent seat and two non-\r\npermanent seats to Arab countries, which would be\r\nfilled on a rotating basis, in accordance with the\r\nstandards used in the Arab League. In that context, we\r\nwould like to note that the current rotation period of\r\nthe one non-permanent seat on the Council for the\r\nArab countries is 30 years, which is unjust and\r\nunacceptable by any standards.\r\nWe look forward to the coming meetings of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council, and we hope that the\r\nentire United Nations membership will be enthusiastic\r\nand responsible in undertaking reform of this\r\nOrganization, which is the basis of international\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\ndemocratic action to realize the aspirations of our\r\npeoples to security and stability.\r\nMr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan): My delegation\r\nwelcomes the annual report of the Security Council\r\n(A/59/2). I would like to express our sincere\r\nappreciation to the President of the Council,\r\nAmbassador Sir Emyr Jones Parry, for his clear and\r\ncapable introduction of the report.\r\nThe document before us encompasses a wide\r\nrange of issues dealt with by the Security Council\r\nduring the reporting period. It has been prepared by the\r\nSecretariat in line with the revised format agreed upon\r\nby the Security Council in 2002 and contains an\r\nanalytical summary of the work of the Council.\r\nThe Security Council maintained a busy agenda\r\non Africa, the Middle East and Afghanistan, as well as\r\nother important issues. Iraq remained a focus of the\r\nCouncil’s attention during the period covered by the\r\nreport. We commend Security Council efforts to\r\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations in assisting\r\nthe people of Iraq to rebuild their country and create a\r\nstable and secure environment.\r\nThe situation in Afghanistan was another\r\nimportant item on the Council’s agenda. The elections\r\nheld on 9 October 2004 have become another landmark\r\non the way to democracy and stability in Afghanistan.\r\nWe continue to believe that the success of the political\r\nprocess in Afghanistan depends on the United Nations\r\npreserving its coordinating role in the settlement of the\r\nsituation in that country.\r\nKazakhstan endorses the Security Council’s\r\ncontinuing efforts to address ongoing conflicts. We\r\nbelieve that United Nations peacekeeping operations\r\nconstitute one of the main elements in the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. They are one of the\r\nkey instruments available to the Security Council in the\r\nsettlement of conflicts and disputes.\r\nWe take positive note of the fact that the Security\r\nCouncil has shifted its debate from the issues of peace\r\nand security to a much broader concept of security,\r\nattaching special importance to the questions of human\r\nrights, the rule of law, the role of the regional\r\norganizations, civil society, economic and social\r\nfactors and HIV/AIDS.\r\nWe welcome the fact that in recent years the\r\nSecurity Council has taken measures to ensure its\r\nopenness to non-members. Open thematic debates and\r\ninteractive briefings are now held more frequently.\r\nThat is a positive development in the work of the\r\nCouncil and we must encourage its efforts to take\r\nfurther steps in that direction.\r\nThe Secretary-General has repeatedly spoken\r\nabout the need to address the issue of the Security\r\nCouncil’s composition in order to ensure that its\r\ndecisions command greater respect. The report of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group, which is under\r\nconsideration today, states that, despite a limited\r\nsuccess in the area of methods of work, significant\r\nprogress has not been made on Security Council\r\nreform. It is noted that the impasse hindering the\r\nreform stems from the complex nature of the issue.\r\nKazakhstan has previously stated its position on\r\nthat crucial subject. We share the perception of the\r\nurgency of a changed Security Council, which needs to\r\nbe more representative, more legitimate, more\r\ntransparent and more efficient. Kazakhstan holds the\r\nview that, in its current form, the Security Council no\r\nlonger reflects the realities of our world. We believe\r\nthat equitable representation of the Member States in\r\nthe Security Council could strengthen its ability to\r\neffectively face the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury and to play its role in the settlement of crisis\r\nsituations.\r\nThe Council should be revitalized by the addition\r\nof new permanent and non-permanent members. We\r\nstand for the expansion of the Security Council on the\r\nbasis of equitable geographic representation and\r\nrespect for the sovereign equality of all Member States.\r\nAsia, Africa and Latin America should have a wider\r\nrepresentation in the Security Council and should be\r\ndirectly involved in the search for solutions to the\r\nimportant problems facing the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe believe that it is also necessary to increase the\r\nnumber of non-permanent members, taking due\r\naccount of the interests of the Asian region. We also\r\nshare the view that the “enemy State” clauses in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter are obsolete.\r\nOn the question of the reform of the Council, we\r\nlook forward to the discussion, in a constructive\r\nmanner, of the report of the High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change. We believe that the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group has to proceed with its\r\nwork, taking into account the progress achieved at\r\nprevious sessions of the General Assembly. We must\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\ncontinue to make every effort to reach a comprehensive\r\nagreement encompassing all aspects of Security\r\nCouncil reform. My delegation is of the view that the\r\nwork on cluster I and cluster II issues would have to\r\ncontinue in the Open-ended Working Group during this\r\nsession.\r\nWe take this opportunity to thank the former\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. Julian Robert\r\nHunte, for his efforts to steer the work of the Group at\r\nthe last session. We appreciate his initiative to\r\nstimulate an active discussion on substantive themes\r\nrelating to the comprehensive reform of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nWe look forward to working closely with the\r\nSecurity Council and to participating actively in all its\r\nefforts to meet the global need for peace.\r\nMs. Novotná (Slovakia): Allow me to convey my\r\ndelegation’s appreciation to the Ambassador of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, Sir Emyr Jones Parry, President of\r\nthe Security Council, for his comprehensive\r\nintroduction of the Council’s report to the General\r\nAssembly. I also thank the members of the Secretariat\r\nfor their efforts in preparing the report.\r\nWe are pleased to note that this year’s annual\r\nreport follows the new approach initiated in 2002,\r\naimed at improving the report in both format and\r\nsubstance. My delegation welcomes the joint debate on\r\nthe report of the Security Council and on the question\r\nof representation on the Council, which allows us to\r\nuse our time more efficiently and effectively.\r\nThe comprehensive reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, the principal organ of the United Nations\r\nresponsible for maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity, is vital to our Organization’s success at a time\r\nwhen global challenges and problems require strong\r\nand truly international management. At this year’s\r\ngeneral debate, many world leaders addressed the\r\nreform of the Security Council. Their views were\r\nmostly focused on the Council’s membership\r\nexpansion.\r\nSecurity Council reform is also one of the issues\r\nbeing considered by the High-level Panel established\r\nby Secretary-General Kofi Annan last year. The report\r\nof the Panel will be available before the end of this\r\nyear and we sincerely hope that it will present\r\nmeaningful suggestions for a long-term Security\r\nCouncil overhaul that will benefit the entire United\r\nNations and the international community.\r\nIt is clear that the Security Council must become\r\nmore democratic, more consistent, more effective and\r\nmore open. It must function less as a geopolitical\r\ninstrument of major Powers and more as a transparent\r\nand legitimate organ accountable to the wider\r\nmembership of the United Nations.\r\nThere is near-universal agreement that the\r\nSecurity Council should be enlarged in order to\r\nbecome more diverse and more representative of\r\nvarious regions and countries of different sizes.\r\nIncreased membership would enhance the Council’s\r\ncapacity to be a credible source of international peace,\r\nsecurity and justice. That would lead to more active\r\nsupport for its decisions, as well as greater\r\nparticipation in operations arising from its decisions.\r\nUltimately, it could encourage responsible leadership\r\nfrom countries of the world’s more volatile regions.\r\nSlovakia supports the idea that the Council could\r\nwell be expanded in due course to the maximum\r\nnumber of 25, with a more equitable geographical and\r\nregional distribution, without limiting its effectiveness\r\nand efficiency. Like several other Member States,\r\nSlovakia believes that the Security Council should be\r\nenlarged in both the permanent and non-permanent\r\ncategories. Such an approach would ensure the\r\nCouncil’s dynamic adaptation to the evolving\r\ninternational realities that have arisen since 1945, when\r\nthe United Nations mandate was drawn up.\r\nThe present membership structure is clearly\r\nunbalanced and does not truly reflect the membership\r\nof the United Nations. The four fifths of humankind\r\nthat live in the developing countries have only one vote\r\namong the permanent members. It seems only\r\nappropriate that the enlargement in the permanent\r\ncategory should include countries of the global South. \r\nOnly such an expansion could rectify the existing\r\nimbalance in the composition of the Council. We duly\r\nnote that several developing and industrialized\r\ncountries that possess political and economic potential\r\nhave staked a claim to permanent membership.\r\nSlovakia maintains the position that an enlarged\r\nSecurity Council should also include Germany and\r\nJapan as new permanent members.\r\nSince 1990, the Security Council has become a\r\nmore effective engine for mobilizing the world\r\ncommunity to repel aggression, manage conflicts and\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nmaintain international peace and security. The Council\r\nhas dramatically increased its activities with regard to\r\nboth peacekeeping missions and the adoption of\r\ncoercive measures. It has branched into many new\r\nareas far beyond the traditional definitions of peace\r\nand security.\r\nIn addition to changing the composition of the\r\nSecurity Council, we must enhance its working\r\nmethods. Some progress has already been made\r\ntowards making the work of the Security Council more\r\ntransparent. A number of decisions have been taken by\r\nthe Council itself with regard to the reform of its\r\nprocedures in an effort to increase and promote the\r\ntransparency of the Council’s deliberative process and\r\nits accountability to the wider membership. Other\r\nproposals and initiatives have been introduced to\r\nincrease efficiency.\r\nFor example, direct meetings are now being held\r\nbetween the Security Council and troop-contributing\r\ncountries, allowing the latter to convey their opinions\r\ndirectly to the Council and contribute to the creation\r\nand the mandates of peacekeeping operations. In\r\naddition, the improved quality of the Council’s\r\nreporting and the holding of more frequent open\r\nmeetings and debates should also be mentioned.\r\nIt is widely accepted that the cooperative\r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council should be further promoted in the\r\ndischarge of the function of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Their mandates, as\r\nspelled out in the Charter, establish the constitutional\r\nbalance between the two main United Nations bodies.\r\nIn this respect, we welcome the adoption of resolution\r\n58/126, which provides for an expanded coordination\r\nmechanism between the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI should like briefly to touch upon the question of\r\nthe veto. Many Member States view the veto privilege\r\nas an anachronism that is responsible for much of the\r\nSecurity Council’s undemocratic and ineffective\r\nprocedure. Slovakia shares the view that the right of\r\nveto should no longer be the prerogative of a few\r\nStates. It is, however, unrealistic to assume that the\r\nveto power will change precipitously. The shift away\r\nfrom veto prerogatives, which are limited to a number\r\nof great Powers, should occur gradually but\r\nsystematically.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations is not an easy\r\nprocess. The core of the reform remains, without\r\ndoubt, the reform of its most powerful organ, which\r\nenjoys unique authority under the Charter and\r\ninternational law. Despite the major obstacles to be\r\novercome, we should not relent in our efforts to\r\nachieve meaningful reform of the Security Council, so\r\nthat it can continue to play an effective role as the focal\r\npoint for the resolution of the conflicts of our time.\r\nMrs. Laohaphan (Thailand): At the outset, my\r\ndelegation would like to express our appreciation to\r\nSir Emyr Jones Parry, Permanent Representative of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, for having introduced the report of\r\nthe Security Council this morning. We also appreciate\r\nthe work and efforts of the Secretariat in compiling the\r\nreport, contained in document A/59/2. The report does,\r\nindeed, provide a comprehensive picture of the work\r\nundertaken by the Security Council during the previous\r\nsession.\r\nMy delegation also welcomes the organization of\r\nopen consultations and briefings for all Member States,\r\nand we look forward to the future organization of such\r\nmeetings, which play an important role in imparting\r\ninformation to and promoting a better understanding of\r\nthe work of the Security Council among all States\r\nmembers of the General Assembly. My delegation\r\nbelieves that such open consultations allow an\r\nopportunity for States that are not members of the\r\nSecurity Council to contribute to the decision-making\r\nprocess so that the Security Council can make more\r\nresponsive and relevant decisions. To this end, such\r\ndialogues and consultations, as well as the distribution\r\nof the Security Council’s programme of work, are very\r\nmuch encouraged.\r\nLast week, my delegation had the pleasure of\r\naddressing the Assembly under agenda items 52 and\r\n54, “Revitalization of the work of the General\r\nAssembly” and “Strengthening of the United Nations\r\nsystem”, respectively. Today, my delegation is pleased\r\nto address agenda item 53, “Question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council and related matters”. My\r\ndelegation believes that the reform of the United\r\nNations must be undertaken in a holistic manner.\r\nHaving already spoken about the reform and the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, therefore, the\r\nnext logical step is to share my delegation’s views on\r\nthe reform of the Security Council.\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nWe must face the fact that there are many changes\r\ntaking place in the world — changes that need a more\r\nresponsive and democratic mechanism if they are to be\r\nproperly addressed at both the national and the\r\ninternational levels. My delegation is of the view that a\r\nreformed Security Council with more equitable\r\ngeographical representation and an expanded\r\nmembership is, indeed, required if the Council is to\r\nrespond effectively and efficiently to the new changes\r\nthat we are talking about.\r\nTo this end, my delegation welcomes the report\r\nof the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nrelated to the Security Council, contained in document\r\nA/58/47, which recommends that discussions on the\r\ntopic be continued at the current session of the General\r\nAssembly. My delegation would also like to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Julian Hunte, President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session, for his dedication\r\nand his tireless efforts in reviving and sustaining the\r\nmomentum of the reform of the Security Council,\r\nthereby providing a foundation for our deliberations\r\ntoday and during the rest of the session. My delegation\r\npledges its full support and active participation in the\r\nreform process of the Organization, including the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe convening by the Working Group of three\r\nformal meetings, as well as of nine rounds of informal\r\nconsultations, is, indeed, an impressive record.\r\nHowever, the number of consultation sessions held is\r\nnot as important as the progress that has been made.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the move away from\r\nconsideration of the two clusters to consideration of\r\nfive pertinent topics, namely, the size of an enlarged\r\nSecurity Council, the question of regional\r\nrepresentation, the criteria for membership, the\r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council, and accountability.\r\nMy delegation also welcomes additional\r\ndiscussion on the use of the veto and looks forward to\r\nparticipating in the consideration of any other issues\r\nthat might be relevant to the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, such as the meetings of the Council with\r\ntroop-contributing countries and the Secretariat; the\r\nmeasures to ensure further transparency of the Council;\r\nthe annual report of the Council to the General\r\nAssembly; and the proper scope of the role of the\r\nCouncil in setting international legal norms. Such an\r\napproach has thus far provided us with stimulating\r\ndiscussions, as well as encouraging results.\r\nIn principle, my delegation is of the opinion that\r\nthe current world climate warrants an expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council through an increase in the number of\r\nboth permanent and non-permanent members, given\r\nthat the United Nations membership has expanded\r\nalmost fourfold since the Organization’s inception in\r\n1945. However, the expansion of the Council should\r\nalso take into account issues of manageability and\r\nefficiency. The 191 Members of the Organization need\r\ngreater representation in the Security Council. But such\r\nrepresentation needs to be equitably distributed in the\r\ngeographical allocations of Member States, including\r\nboth developed and developing countries, so as to\r\nreflect the world in microcosm.\r\nIn the light of the existing diversified opinions on\r\nhow the membership of the Security Council should be\r\nexpanded, my delegation wishes to echo the statement\r\nmade by the Thai Foreign Minister during the general\r\ndebate two weeks ago, calling for priority to be given\r\nto the establishment of a set of relevant criteria for\r\nmembership before considering the admission thereto\r\nby names or number. In other words, before\r\nmembership is granted, new members of the\r\nSecurity Council must fulfil a certain established set of\r\ncriteria — for example, the ability and the commitment\r\nto discharge their responsibilities in safeguarding\r\ninternational peace and security and in upholding the\r\nCouncil’s significant authority, which must be\r\nexercised with the utmost care and responsibility.\r\nGiven that the primary role of the Security Council is\r\nto safeguard global peace and security, the ability to\r\nperform that function to any degree — for example, by\r\ncontributing troops and financial resources for peace\r\noperations — could become an essential factor.\r\nIn this era of United Nations reform, the Security\r\nCouncil must connect more significantly with the rest\r\nof the United Nations. Therefore, greater interaction,\r\ncoordination and coherence between and among the\r\nSecurity Council, the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council must be achieved.\r\nRegular meetings between the Presidents of those\r\norgans could provide a good starting point.\r\nMoreover, such meetings should also provide\r\nopportunities to address in a unified manner a wider\r\nrange of issues, such as post-conflict peace-building\r\nand reconstruction and development, the latter of\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nwhich is seen as the best means of conflict prevention\r\nand thus is unquestionably relevant to issues related to\r\nworld peace and security. The relationship between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly on\r\nbudgetary questions should be re-examined and further\r\nstrengthened, as the decisions taken by the Council\r\nmay impose budgetary obligations on and thus\r\nfinancially affect all members of the Assembly.\r\nAt any rate, the expansion of the Security Council\r\nmust not be executed at the expense of transparency\r\nand accountability. The Council should both represent\r\nand be responsive to the views and the will of the\r\ninternational community. Decision-making processes\r\nshould also be made transparent.\r\nFinally, my delegation would like to touch upon\r\nthe issue of the veto power. As shown in annex III of\r\nthe report of the Open-ended Working Group\r\n(A/58/47), since the inception of the Security Council,\r\nmore than 200 of its decisions have been vetoed,\r\nmostly by the single negative vote of a permanent\r\nmember. That practice should be reconsidered in the\r\nlight of the proposed expansion of the membership of\r\nthe Council. In that context, a new approach aimed at\r\nbringing more credibility and legitimacy to the use of\r\nthe veto power may need to be introduced.\r\nThe report of the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change will soon be completed. My\r\ndelegation looks forward to its guidance and its\r\nsuggestions for further reform of the United Nations\r\nsystem. However, the report should not delay Member\r\nStates in formulating ideas and innovative ways to\r\nimprove the Security Council. Additionally, as the\r\ncelebration of the sixtieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations is fast approaching, a revitalized, reformed and\r\nresponsive Security Council, as well as the United\r\nNations as a whole, could herald a welcoming\r\nbeginning for the seventh decade of this body.\r\nMr. Verbeke (Belgium) (spoke in French): The\r\nreport of the Security Council (A/59/2) to the General\r\nAssembly is a useful instrument. However, we must\r\ncontinue the efforts aimed at making it more analytical.\r\nThis report gives us the opportunity to take a look\r\nat the progress of the work of the Security Council and\r\nits relations with the General Assembly. In fact, the\r\nCouncil’s increasing role in new areas, the increase in\r\nthematic debates and the legislative trend we have\r\nnoted recently are all developments that raise, in new\r\nterms, the question of the Security Council’s\r\ninteraction with the General Assembly and with the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. That question deserves\r\ngenuine reflection. We hope that the report of the High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change\r\nestablished by the Secretary-General will enable us to\r\ntake a step back and devote ourselves to such\r\nreflection.\r\nI now turn to the question of reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. For many years, we have reiterated\r\nthat the Council’s current composition no longer\r\ncorresponds to today’s geopolitical realities. We cannot\r\ncontinue to ignore that evidence; the very credibility\r\nand legitimacy of the Council are at stake.\r\nUnfortunately, it has become increasingly clear in\r\nrecent years that the General Assembly’s Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on this question is at an impasse.\r\nIn addition, my delegation awaits with great\r\ninterest the proposals to be made by the High-level\r\nPanel on this subject. In fact, the Panel, by approaching\r\nthe question of Council reform in a broader context,\r\nshould shed appropriate and new light on this debate.\r\nWe will therefore examine these proposals — together\r\nwith the recommendations that the Secretary-General\r\nwishes to make on the basis of the Panel’s report —\r\nattentively and in an open and constructive spirit.\r\nBelgium favours balanced and realistic reform\r\nthat would respond to the wishes of a vast majority of\r\nMember States — reform that would strengthen the\r\nrepresentativity and thus the legitimacy of the Security\r\nCouncil, but without compromising its effectiveness.\r\nTogether with a group of countries that agree on such\r\nan approach, my delegation has in the past introduced\r\npragmatic proposals aimed at expanding the two\r\ncategories of Council membership. We have also\r\nformulated proposals aimed at limiting the exercise of\r\nthe right of the veto. We remain convinced that those\r\nare the parameters necessary to arrive at a compromise\r\nsolution.\r\nIn fact, we believe it essential that States that are\r\nactors on the international scene and have the\r\nnecessary diplomatic, financial and military capacity to\r\nsupport actions undertaken by the Security Council\r\nshould be able to participate in that forum. Moreover,\r\nBelgium has always advocated expansion that would\r\nrespect regional balances. In that respect, we believe\r\nwe should consider the issue of greater involvement by\r\nregional organizations, directly or indirectly, in the\r\nwork of the Council. In particular, the dynamic of\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nEuropean construction towards a truly common foreign\r\npolicy should prompt us to think about European\r\nUnion representation within the Security Council.\r\nPrecisely because geopolitical realities are\r\nconstantly changing, we also feel that it would be\r\nappropriate to provide for the periodic review of the\r\nCouncil’s composition — every 10 to 15 years, for\r\nexample.\r\nI can assure you, Mr. President, that my\r\ndelegation will continue to participate actively in the\r\ndiscussions and the work on reform of the Security\r\nCouncil in the same constructive spirit that has inspired\r\nour previous proposals. You can count on our full\r\nsupport in that undertaking.\r\nMr. Almansoor (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): My\r\ndelegation welcomes the report of the Security Council\r\n(A/59/2) to the General Assembly. We should like to\r\nthank the President of the Council, Ambassador Sir\r\nEmyr Jones Parry, Permanent Representative of the\r\nUnited Kingdom to the United Nations, for his clear\r\nand comprehensive introduction of the report.\r\nThe report gives us an overall picture of the work\r\nthe Council has done in the past year in discharging its\r\nmandate, which is the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. This is a good opportunity for\r\nMember States to review and assess the Council’s work\r\nand to present their observations on this matter.\r\nMy country also welcomes the report of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nrelated to the Security Council. This is an important\r\nopportunity for us, as Member States of the\r\nOrganization, to give our views on this important\r\nmatter.\r\nThe Security Council report is an important\r\ndocument, and it is of great interest to delegations,\r\nwhich eagerly await its publication every year. It gives\r\na full account of measures taken by the Council over\r\nthe past year. It also gives us important statistical\r\ninformation that serves as a reference for delegations,\r\nas well as for researchers and those who take an\r\ninterest in the work of the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly as a whole.\r\nAlthough the report is comprehensive, it lacks\r\nample explanation and analysis of the Council’s work.\r\nIt contains documents and resolutions that have been\r\nissued and that we have seen; what is needed is an\r\nevaluation of the successes and the failures of the\r\nCouncil, the impediments it has encountered, and\r\nproposals to improve its performance.\r\nThere is one thing that we have often said in the\r\npast, which is that the report comes out late every year.\r\nIt comes out just a few days before it is discussed by\r\nthe General Assembly, thus creating difficulties for us,\r\nas we have only a short time to study it.\r\nThe Council reports to the Assembly under\r\nArticle 24 of the Charter, and it has to comply fully\r\nand faithfully with the provisions of this Article, as\r\nmust the Secretariat. The Council is one of the\r\nOrganization’s principal organs, and all Members must\r\nbe kept informed of its activities, as it acts on behalf of\r\nthe membership and its decisions affect their interests\r\nand their obligations.\r\nAccordingly, we all need to study the report, and\r\nwith enough time, so that we can submit our views on\r\nit. We want to stress the importance of the relationship\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly. This relationship is governed by many\r\nCharter articles. The relations between the two bodies\r\nhave been considered in depth over the past decade\r\nduring discussions on Council reform. Some agreed\r\nideas and observations have emerged, such as how to\r\nenhance and improve the Council’s annual report and\r\nother reports to the Assembly.\r\nRegular monthly consultations have been held\r\nbetween the Presidents of the Council and the\r\nAssembly and the Secretary-General. Under General\r\nAssembly resolution 58/126, the Assembly reviewed\r\nthe matter regarding the revitalization of the work of\r\nthe Assembly and efforts to improve relations between\r\nthese two organs. We want to stress how important it is\r\nto consolidate the relationship between the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly. This means that the\r\nCouncil must have greater transparency in its work and\r\nin its working methods.\r\nMany have noted that the Council is beginning to\r\nconsider issues that do not fall within its purview but\r\nrather within that of the General Assembly. It has\r\nbegun to broaden its mandate, mainly the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security, by taking up issues\r\nsuch as poverty, children, children and armed conflict,\r\nthe rule of law and human rights. These are issues that\r\nfall within the mandate of the General Assembly and\r\nthe Economic and Social Council. Some Members have\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\ninterpreted the transfer of issues from the Assembly to\r\nthe Council as due to the latter’s desire to broaden its\r\nactivities and the Assembly’s inability to deal\r\neffectively with such issues. The Assembly must be\r\nmore active and effective and tackle these issues in a\r\nnew spirit in order to restore the proper balance\r\nbetween the two organs, so that each can exercise its\r\nspecific powers under the United Nations Charter.\r\nMy delegation would like to pay tribute to the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nrelated to the Security Council. My delegation\r\nappreciates what the Working Group has done. We also\r\nwelcome the ideas and proposals it has offered. We\r\nwelcome any progress in this area, slow as the progress\r\nmay have been. Since its founding in 1993, the\r\nWorking Group has dealt with a number of\r\ncontroversial issues, although it has not yet arrived at\r\nspecific proposals on the reforms to be undertaken to\r\nimprove the working methods of the Council, its\r\ncomposition and the number of its members.\r\nNevertheless, the Working Group is the forum that\r\nevery Member goes to in order to discuss ways that\r\nwould lead to the required reform.\r\nWe trust that the Group’s work will be crowned\r\nwith success so that this and other issues can be\r\nresolved. The question of Security Council reform has\r\nbecome a fundamental prerequisite, as has\r\nimprovement in its working methods and structure.\r\nThis has been a priority and one of the most discussed\r\nissues within the United Nations and one of the major\r\nconcerns of the membership. In the last few years, the\r\nWorking Group’s discussions have taken place within\r\nthis context. There has been a significant increase in\r\nUnited Nations membership, and the question of the\r\nequitable representation of States in the Council has\r\nbecome a fundamental requirement. Account must be\r\ntaken of this increase in United Nations membership\r\nwhen discussing the increase in the membership of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nThere are more items on the agenda as well, and\r\nspecial attention and redoubled efforts must be devoted\r\nto this problem. Equitable representation is needed in\r\nthe Council, taking into account the interests of all\r\nMember States.\r\nWe welcome improvement in the working\r\nmethods and increased transparency of the Council. We\r\nalso welcome its greater number of open meetings,\r\ndiscussions and public briefings, which have enabled\r\nMember States to learn more about the Council’s work\r\nand to follow its discussions. This improvement in its\r\nworking methods should prompt us to exert further\r\nefforts in this area. We need the cooperation of one and\r\nall in order to reach our goal, which is to ensure that\r\nthe Security Council represents the interests of all\r\nMember States and that all States requesting its\r\nassistance and protection can have recourse to it in its\r\nrole as a defender of the law and a promoter of justice.\r\nMr. Kirn (Slovenia): I wish to thank Ambassador\r\nSir Emyr Jones Parry of the United Kingdom for\r\nintroducing the Security Council’s report in his\r\ncapacity as President of the Council.\r\nThe past year has again raised a wide range of\r\nissues that the Council is taking up in exercising its\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. My delegation\r\ncontinues to believe that this also represents a stark\r\nreminder of the need to adapt the Security Council’s\r\npermanent and non-permanent composition and\r\nmethods of work, including the right of veto, if it is to\r\ncope efficiently with the geopolitical realities of the\r\nworld today. In advocating an increase in the non-\r\npermanent seats on the Council, let me reiterate that an\r\nadditional non-permanent seat should be allocated to\r\nthe Eastern-European region, alongside those to be\r\nallocated to the groups of African, Asian and Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States.\r\nNotwithstanding the continuing lack of progress\r\nwithin the Open-ended Working Group on the Question\r\nof Equitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nrelated to the Security Council on the issue of\r\nincreased Council membership, we wish to commend\r\nthe innovative efforts to foster progress in its\r\ndiscussions made by the previous President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Mr. Julian Hunte, and both Vice-\r\nChairpersons of the Working Group, Ambassador\r\nGallegos Chiriboga of Ecuador and Ambassador\r\nWenaweser of Liechtenstein. The practice of focusing\r\nour discussions on separate points and of introducing\r\nthe reference and historical-review papers was a useful\r\none in terms of better structuring ongoing discussions\r\nover the past decade.\r\nHowever, we cannot afford to spend another\r\ndecade going through the same discussions. Last year,\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nSlovenia wholeheartedly welcomed the establishment\r\nof the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\r\nChange and we anticipate with great interest the report\r\nof the Panel to be submitted to the Secretary-General\r\nlater this year, as well as the recommendations to\r\nemanate from it. We expect the Panel and the\r\nconsequent recommendations to address a range of\r\nissues to better enable the Organization, including the\r\nSecurity Council, to collectively address today’s\r\nthreats and challenges in a globalized world. We\r\nanticipate the issue of Security Council enlargement to\r\nrepresent part of the recommendations. At the same\r\ntime, that issue alone should not overshadow other\r\nissues of importance to enabling the strengthened\r\nOrganization to respond effectively to crisis situations\r\nand crisis issues, thereby strengthening effective\r\nmultilateralism and the international order based on\r\ninternational law. Slovenia will engage constructively\r\nin addressing all recommendations emanating from the\r\nwork of the Panel.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to express the\r\nview of my delegation that greater opportunities need\r\nto be provided to the general United Nations\r\nmembership to participate in the Council’s\r\ndeliberations, particularly when those result in its\r\n“semi-legislative” decisions under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter, binding on all United Nations Members.\r\nGreater openness to general views in such decision-\r\nmaking processes will increase the legitimacy of the\r\nCouncil. Having said that, we continue to believe that\r\ntreaty-making continues to be the principal source of\r\nobligations binding on States.\r\nThe complexity of threats to world peace,\r\nsecurity and the well-being of the populations of\r\nvarious regions of the globe demands a strengthening\r\nof the cooperation between various regional\r\norganizations and the United Nations. Chapter VIII of\r\nthe Charter provides a framework for such cooperation\r\nthat could be further exploited. On that issue, I wish to\r\nconcur with the statement made by Ambassador\r\nKumalo of South Africa this morning. Slovenia\r\nwelcomes the trend demonstrated over the past year\r\ntowards an intensification of partnership between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations. Next year,\r\nSlovenia will assume the presidency of the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE) and, in that capacity, will strive to further\r\nenhance cooperation between the United Nations, its\r\nSecurity Council and the OSCE, as well as other\r\nregional organizations, in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMr. Pfanzelter (Austria): I would like to express\r\nour gratitude to Ambassador Sir Emyr Jones Parry for\r\nhis eloquent introduction of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil. My delegation also commends the excellent\r\nwork of the Secretariat in compiling that invaluable\r\nsource of reference and information. That presentation\r\nis a welcome continuation of the Security Council’s\r\ndialogue with the General Assembly on the discharge\r\nof its duties pursuant to Article 24 of the Charter. Our\r\ndialogue will enhance the relationship between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council in\r\npromoting the purposes and principles of the Charter.\r\nAn adequate flow of information towards non-\r\nmembers is a necessary prerequisite to assessing how\r\nthe Council is dealing with political issues. It should\r\ntherefore be strengthened. The briefings of the\r\nrespective presidencies and the information they make\r\navailable via their homepages have been further\r\nimproved. The increase in public meetings underlines\r\nthe willingness of the Council to take into account the\r\nviews of Member States.\r\nAustria, as a traditional provider of peacekeeping\r\ntroops, would welcome further efforts of the Council to\r\nenhance the dialogue with troop-contributing countries.\r\nCooperation between the Council and the troop-\r\ncontributing countries at an early stage is essential\r\nwhen new mandates of United Nations peacekeeping\r\nmissions are being considered.\r\nMy Government warmly welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s pledge to make the strengthening of the rule\r\nof law a priority for the remainder of his tenure. In that\r\nrespect, and in view of the unique role and\r\nresponsibility of the Security Council, the Austrian\r\nForeign Minister launched a dialogue on the role and\r\nfunctions of the Security Council in the strengthening\r\nof an international system based on the rule of law. As\r\na first step, Austria will convene a panel on the\r\nquestion “The Security Council as world legislator?”\r\non 4 November, during this year’s International Law\r\nWeek at the United Nations in New York. The panel,\r\nwhich is being organized in cooperation with New\r\nYork University, is designed to enhance the dialogue\r\nbetween theory and practice on that important topic.\r\nThe United Nations has played a central role in\r\nAustria’s foreign policy ever since my country became\r\na Member in 1955. We therefore attach great value to\r\n29\r\nA/59/PV.25\r\nthe legitimacy and efficient functioning of the\r\nOrganization and support a comprehensive reform of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nAustria, like the vast majority of Member States,\r\nis concerned about the growing gap between the\r\nCouncil’s current composition, on the one hand, and\r\nthe changing political, economic and social reality of\r\nthe community of nations, on the other. It is essential\r\nto enlarge and balance the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil, as well as to increase its transparency. We\r\nmust ensure that the Security Council is a body that\r\ntruly reflects the diversity of the world’s cultures and\r\nregions by an improved representation of Africa, Asia\r\nand Latin America.\r\nAustria highly appreciates the work of the High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change and is\r\nvery much looking forward to its report. Austria is\r\nconfident that that report will give a new and\r\ninnovative impetus to the reform debate.\r\nDuring this session’s general debate a clear\r\nmajority of delegations advocated reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. Although the specific positions still\r\ndiverge significantly, there seems to be a gathering\r\nmomentum for substantive reform. That momentum,\r\ntogether with the fresh impetus that we expect will be\r\ngenerated by the report of the High-level Panel, is a\r\nunique opportunity for change. We must not miss that\r\nopportunity.\r\nMr. Capelle (Marshall Islands): I am honoured to\r\nparticipate in this debate on behalf of the Republic of\r\nthe Marshall Islands.\r\nLike many other Member States that have spoken\r\nbefore me today, the Marshall Islands sees an urgent\r\nneed for the reform of the working methods and\r\nmembership of the Security Council. In order for the\r\ndecisions of the Council to garner the respect and\r\nsupport of the international community, the working\r\nmethods of the Council must become more transparent\r\nand inclusive, and the membership must be made more\r\nrepresentative. The Marshall Islands reiterates its\r\nsupport for the expansion of the Security Council in\r\nboth categories of membership. We support the\r\nallocation of a new permanent seat to Japan, and we\r\nalso believe that priority must be given to increasing\r\nthe representation of developing countries on the\r\nCouncil. Those reforms are crucial if the Council is to\r\nretain its legitimacy in light of the political, economic\r\nand geographic realities of the world today.\r\nMy delegation looks forward to the discussions\r\nthat will take place within the framework of the Open-\r\nended Working Group later this session. We hope that\r\nsubstantial progress will be made and that the Working\r\nGroup will agree on recommendations that will push\r\nthe reform process forward in a meaningful way.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.\r\n"
