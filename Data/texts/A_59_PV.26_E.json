(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda items 11 and 53 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/59/2)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters\r\nMr. Denisov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The current session of the General Assembly\r\nis taking place in the context of a growing\r\nunderstanding of the need to further strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations as the central mechanism for the\r\ncollective resolution of problems in international\r\nrelations with a view to ensuring global security and\r\nstability. There can be no doubt that that objective can\r\nbe achieved only if adequate resources are provided to\r\nthis global Organization and if its structure and\r\nmechanisms are enhanced.\r\nIn this context, it is high time to reform the\r\nUnited Nations, including adapting the composition of\r\nthe Security Council to the dramatically changed\r\ninternational realities.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council should be\r\naimed at making that authoritative organ more\r\nrepresentative and more effective in its decision-\r\nmaking. Such reform is now urgent, as the recent\r\ngeneral debate and the current discussion have clearly\r\ndemonstrated.\r\nAt the same time, we cannot close our eyes to the\r\ndistinct differences in the approaches taken by Member\r\nStates to the expansion of the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. We are convinced that the\r\nachievement of the broadest possible consensus should\r\nremain the key benchmark in the reform process. We\r\nhave an enormous responsibility to prevent division in\r\nthe Organization. Our task is to lay the groundwork for\r\nthe greater authority and potential of the Security\r\nCouncil as the main organ for maintaining international\r\npeace and security.\r\nRussia is prepared to continue the painstaking\r\nwork to bring us closer to the selection of an optimal\r\nmodel for the future composition of the Security\r\nCouncil. We are ready to examine constructive\r\nproposals on this issue, on the understanding that an\r\nincrease in any category of Council membership should\r\ninvolve both developed and developing States, with\r\nequal rights and responsibilities being shared between\r\nthem. We believe that, in the event that additional\r\npermanent seats are created, Germany, Japan, India,\r\nBrazil and an authoritative representative from Africa\r\nwould be worthy candidates to claim them.\r\nIt is hard to overestimate the importance of\r\nensuring that in its composition the renewed Council\r\nremains compact so that it can respond adequately and\r\nrapidly to the challenges of the new millennium. We\r\nare certain that those delegations that have worked in\r\nthe Security Council clearly understand that an\r\nexcessive expansion of the Council could have a\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nnegative impact on its ability to function, with\r\nrepercussions for international security.\r\nWe are convinced that ideas involving the\r\ninfringement of the prerogatives and authority of the\r\ncurrent permanent members of the Security Council,\r\nincluding the veto right, would be counter-productive.\r\nUnfounded criticism of that vital institution, which\r\ncontributes to ensuring a necessary balance of interests\r\namong Council members, only stirs up unnecessary\r\nemotions and makes it harder to reach the consensus\r\nsought with regard to the reform parameters.\r\nAs to granting the veto right to new permanent\r\nmembers, we believe that there is no point in\r\ndiscussing that issue before agreement has been\r\nreached on the expanded membership of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nHaving actively supported the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s establishment of the High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change, the Russian\r\nFederation, like all other Member States, is looking\r\nforward with genuine interest to receiving its\r\nrecommendations. We trust that Panel members will\r\nlive up to their reputation as being truly wise and will\r\ndevelop recommendations to effectively strengthen and\r\nimprove multilateral mechanisms, including the\r\nSecurity Council. We hope that the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposals on the outcome of the work of the High-level\r\nPanel will take into account the wide range of\r\napproaches to the reform of the Security Council.\r\nFinally, Member States will need to implement\r\nthose proposals, ensuring a comprehensive\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations. Based on that\r\nposition, the Russian Federation will continue to\r\nconstructively contribute to the process, including\r\nthrough contributing to the work of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group of the General Assembly towards\r\nfinding an effective and widely supported model for\r\nthe reform of the Security Council.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nDuring the general debate at the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, almost every delegation included\r\nthe issue of the reform of the Security Council in its\r\nstatement. That once again shows the great importance\r\nthat all parties attach to this issue. It also indicates the\r\nresponsibility borne by the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup of the General Assembly on reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. We believe that this group, under the\r\nchairmanship of Assembly President Jean Ping, will\r\nengage in constructive discussions to reach consensus\r\non a set of recommendations.\r\nReform of the Security Council is at the core of\r\nUnited Nations reform. Over the past six decades, the\r\nmembership of the United Nations has increased nearly\r\nfourfold, with developing countries representing a\r\nlarge proportion of that increase. As one of the\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations, the Security\r\nCouncil plays an important role in international affairs\r\nand has primary responsibility for maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security. It should therefore\r\nkeep pace with the times and conduct rational and\r\nnecessary reforms. We all maintain that reform of the\r\nSecurity Council should be targeted at strengthening its\r\nstatus as the core body responsible for maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security, enhancing its capacity\r\nin dealing with threats and challenges and, as a matter\r\nof priority, finding an effective solution to the under-\r\nrepresentation of developing countries, in accordance\r\nwith the principle of equitable geographical\r\ndistribution.\r\nReform of the Security Council should also\r\ninclude the further improvement of its working\r\nmethods and its transparency. Some progress has been\r\nachieved in this regard over recent years. The\r\nincreasing number of public meetings, the good\r\ncommunication and cooperation with troop-\r\ncontributing countries and the regular meetings held\r\namong the Presidents of the Security Council, the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil have been received very positively by the\r\nmajority of Member States. China would like to work\r\ntogether with other Council members to continue the\r\nefforts in that regard.\r\nIt has been more than 10 years since the General\r\nAssembly started the debate on reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. Given the current situation, we urgently need\r\nto accelerate the reform. Meanwhile, we should not\r\nlose sight of the fact that reform of the Council\r\ninvolves a multitude of factors and contradictions and\r\nthat significant differences exist in the proposed\r\nspecifics of the reform programme.\r\nIn-depth discussions and patient consultations are\r\ntherefore called for, in order to demonstrate political\r\nwill and the wisdom of compromise and to seek the\r\nbroadest possible consensus on all relevant aspects. A\r\nforceful push towards a vote on a reform package\r\ncould result in confrontation and division between\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nMember States. That would be detrimental to the\r\nreform of the Security Council, contradict its original\r\npurpose and inevitably harm the strengthening of the\r\nCouncil’s authority and functioning.\r\nChina supports the work of the High-level Panel\r\non Threats, Challenges and Change, and looks forward\r\nto comprehensive, positive and practical\r\nrecommendations that can be widely supported. China\r\nwill take an active part in the relevant discussions and\r\nwill work with other parties to move the reform\r\nprocess forward.\r\nMr. Loizaga (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nAssembly is jointly considering agenda items 11 and\r\n53, on the report of the Security Council and on the\r\nreport of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters Related to the Security Council. In our\r\ndelegation’s view, while they are listed separately —\r\nand rightly so — the two items are closely related. We\r\nfeel that they have a bearing on the hopes of the\r\ninternational community to see a more representative,\r\ndemocratic and transparent Security Council that can\r\nrespond effectively and rapidly to the new challenges\r\ninherent in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, in accordance with the Charter.\r\nOn this occasion, allow me to thank Ambassador\r\nEmyr Jones Parry for introducing the annual report of\r\nthe Council (A/59/2). I would now like to refer to that\r\nreport. My delegation feels that the way in which the\r\nreport was presented is limited to compliance with\r\nprocedural requirements and that the structure of the\r\nreport does not allow for an analysis or a substantive\r\nassessment. Such an assessment would have enabled\r\nthe members of the Security Council to draw\r\nconclusions from this General Assembly debate\r\nthrough which to move forward on formulating a report\r\nthat is more analytical, instead of a merely descriptive\r\nand chronological account of the items under\r\nconsideration.\r\nWe make this comment because we feel that\r\nMember States’ consideration of the report should not\r\nbe a mere formality, but rather a reaffirmation of the\r\nAssembly’s responsibility in matters of fundamental\r\nimportance for the entire membership of the\r\nOrganization. We, the Member States, have the right\r\nand the duty properly to understand and analyse the\r\nwork of the Council, because the Council acts on\r\nbehalf of all of us, in accordance with the mandate\r\nentrusted to it in our Charter, and because its decisions\r\naffect the membership. We therefore need a report that\r\nenables us to understand the substance of the Council’s\r\ndiscussions and of the positions it adopts on the most\r\nrelevant matters before it.\r\nWe therefore support and encourage the position\r\nof previous speakers, who have insisted that the report\r\nof the Security Council should include a more\r\ninteractive component for the General Assembly, since\r\nthe report is the main instrument in the relationship\r\nbetween these two principal organs of the\r\nOrganization. The maintenance of international peace\r\nand security is the responsibility of us all.\r\nParaguay feels that an important step in\r\nimproving the presentation of the Security Council\r\nreport can be found in paragraph 3 and following\r\nsection A of the annex to General Assembly resolution\r\n58/126, adopted on 19 December 2003, on the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly.\r\nWe support and encourage the process of open\r\nmeetings of the Security Council. Open meetings\r\nshould be the rule and not the exception, so that\r\nMember States can express their point of view on\r\nmatters affecting Members and the Organization,\r\nand — though it may be optimistic to say so — so that\r\nCouncil members may take Members’ views into\r\naccount before resolutions are adopted rather than\r\nmerely presenting them as faits accomplis.\r\nAnother area of concern for Paraguay is the\r\nCouncil’s involvement in matters traditionally dealt\r\nwith in the General Assembly or in the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, overburdening the Security Council\r\nwith matters requiring decisions but without sufficient\r\ntime to deal with them properly. In addition, we are\r\nconcerned at the expansion of the normative nature of\r\nthe Council’s resolutions, whereby the Council\r\nassumes a legislative competency that exceeds the\r\nmandate granted to it in the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nOn the question of equitable representation in the\r\nSecurity Council and an increase in its membership,\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group established in 1993\r\nhas been meeting year after year without arriving at a\r\nconsensus that would enable Member States to take a\r\ndecision. Nevertheless, my delegation wishes to\r\nexpress its gratitude to the outgoing President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Mr. Julian Hunte, for the decisive\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nimpetus he brought during his chairmanship of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group to encourage debate and\r\nproduce a report that included positions of Member\r\nStates and sought to bridge the gap in the differing\r\nstances.\r\nMember States agree on the need to reform the\r\nSecurity Council and to increase its membership, but\r\nnot on the form and procedure for doing so, despite the\r\nfact that it is set forth in the Charter, as well as in\r\nAssembly resolution 53/30, which stipulates that the\r\nGeneral Assembly will not adopt any resolution or\r\ndecision on the question of equitable representation in\r\nthe Security Council, an increase in its membership\r\nand related matters without a vote in favour by at least\r\ntwo thirds of the Members of the General Assembly. In\r\norder to preserve the integrity of our Organization we\r\nneed to arrive at a consensus on this question, as it\r\nconcerns one of the fundamental organs that sustains\r\nour Organization.\r\nParaguay eagerly awaits the report to be\r\nsubmitted at the end of the year by the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change established\r\nby the Secretary-General to consider present and future\r\nthreats to international peace and security. The\r\nrecommendations in that report may well contribute to\r\nbuilding a consensus on reform of the body entrusted\r\nwith collective security.\r\nOn this occasion I would like to reiterate the\r\nwell-known position of Paraguay on the question of\r\nequitable representation in the Security Council and on\r\nan increase in its membership. Paraguay favours an\r\nincrease in the number of members in the Security\r\nCouncil in order to take into account the political\r\nrealities of today and the increase in the number of\r\nMember States in our Organization. To build a more\r\ndemocratic and representative Security Council, both\r\ncategories of members — permanent and non-\r\npermanent — should be increased and should include\r\nboth developed and developing countries, particularly\r\nas developing countries have been underrepresented in\r\nthat important body. An increase in the Council’s\r\nmembership will make it more representative and will\r\ntherefore improve the legitimacy and credibility of its\r\nactions.\r\nSimilarly, as a fundamental aspect of reform, we\r\nneed to consider the question of the right of veto that is\r\nheld by permanent members. We must work towards\r\nthe gradual elimination of the veto until it can be\r\ncompletely done away with. A first step should be to\r\nlimit it strictly to questions under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter. Similarly, we could leave open the possibility\r\nfor periodic review of reform in order to assess the\r\nfunctioning of the Security Council in accordance with\r\nfuture needs and realities.\r\nToday we must shoulder our responsibilities and\r\nmake the political decision to move this process\r\nforward and achieve the objective desired by the\r\nmajority of Member States. In that regard, we trust in\r\nthe leadership of the President of the General\r\nAssembly and we hope that in the coming months he\r\nwill help us to find a way to move forward in this\r\nexercise and arrive at the conclusion we have so long\r\nhoped for.\r\nIn conclusion, I would reiterate that no reform of\r\nthe United Nations will have the desired effect if the\r\nlong-awaited reform of the Security Council is not\r\nrealized. Until then, we will not be able to speak of an\r\nOrganization that has kept pace with the times nor will\r\nthat Organization be able to respond to the interests\r\nand aspirations of the international community.\r\nMr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): It is my great\r\npleasure to take part on behalf of the delegation of Viet\r\nNam in the debate on the two important agenda items\r\nrelating to the report of the Security Council and the\r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and other\r\nrelated matters. I would like to thank the President of\r\nthe Security Council, Ambassador Jones Parry, for\r\nintroducing the Council’s report. Our sincere thanks\r\nalso go to the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters Related to the Security Council — chaired by\r\nMr. Julian Robert Hunte, President of the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly — for its\r\ncontributions and its report, which serves as a good\r\nbasis for our discussion today. We look forward to\r\nreceiving the report of the High-level Panel on\r\nChallenges, Threats and Change and will study its\r\nrecommendations carefully for further deliberation.\r\nThe past year has really been a year of hard work\r\nfor the Security Council, as reflected in the great\r\nnumber of meetings it has held and the wide range of\r\ncomplex and urgent issues it has had to tackle, from\r\nescalated conflicts and violence to terrorism and\r\nhumanitarian crises. Fifty-nine resolutions were\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nadopted and 45 presidential statements were made. We\r\nwish to express our great appreciation for the efforts of\r\nthe members of the Council.\r\nHaving closely followed the work of the Council,\r\nthe delegation of Viet Nam acknowledges that there\r\nhas been an evolution in some of its working methods\r\nand practice.\r\nAs mentioned in the report of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group (A/58/47), since the adoption of\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 58/126 — which provides\r\nfor, inter alia, orientation of the relationship between\r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council —\r\nprogress has been made with regard to the regular\r\nbriefing of the President of the General Assembly by\r\nthe President of the Security Council on the work of\r\nthe Council. The practice of providing non-Council\r\nmembers with necessary information about the\r\npreparation of draft resolutions and decisions is also\r\npositive and should be encouraged.\r\nThe Security Council has the primary\r\nresponsibility for maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity. The current structure and composition of the\r\nCouncil’s membership do not reflect today’s realities;\r\nindeed, they are limiting its ability to carry out its\r\nmandate effectively. In 1963, when the membership of\r\nthe Council was expanded to 15, the total membership\r\nof the United Nations was 112; therefore, the Council’s\r\nmembership represented 13 per cent of the membership\r\nof the Organization. Today, the Organization has 191\r\nmembers, and the Council’s membership represents\r\nonly 7.85 per cent of the membership of the\r\nOrganization. For that very reason, and because of the\r\nmanner in which the Council’s resolutions and\r\ndecisions are negotiated, the legitimacy of those\r\nresolutions and decisions has constantly been\r\nquestioned. Reform of the Council is urgent and\r\ninevitable, and it must be carried out in a way that will\r\nmake the Council more representative and more\r\ndemocratic.\r\nViet Nam shares the view of the majority of\r\nMember States that Security Council reform must\r\ninclude expansion of its membership, with due\r\nattention to the need to ensure more adequate\r\nrepresentation of developing countries and to improve\r\nits decision-making process. Viet Nam supports\r\nincreasing the Council’s membership in both\r\ncategories — permanent and non-permanent — and\r\nsupports measures aimed at ensuring broader\r\nparticipation and greater democracy, accountability and\r\ntransparency in its work. With regard to expanding the\r\npermanent membership of the Council in the light of its\r\npresent unbalanced structure, we are of the view that,\r\nin addition to capable countries such as India, Japan\r\nand Germany — for which Viet Nam has voiced its\r\nsupport — other capable developing countries from\r\nvarious continents should be able to join the Council as\r\npermanent members.\r\nViet Nam attaches great importance to the work\r\nof the Security Council, and we have announced our\r\ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Council in\r\nthe near term. There is every reason for us to want the\r\nCouncil to be strengthened and its work to be\r\nimproved. Such strengthening and improvement will\r\ndepend on how well and how soon we will be able to\r\nreform the Council. We look forward to joining our\r\nefforts with those of other Member States in that\r\nimportant process.\r\nMr. Menon (Singapore): A year ago, Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan, in his statement to this body,\r\nannounced that the United Nations had reached a fork\r\nin the road. He decided to establish a High-level Panel\r\non Threats, Challenges and Change to assess the\r\ncurrent situation and to make recommendations on the\r\nway forward. In his statement to the General Assembly\r\nat its 3rd meeting two weeks ago, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral highlighted the lack of the rule of law, or of\r\nrespect for it, to be a root cause of the key problems\r\nthat the world faces today.\r\nIndeed, those are related issues. Today, the world\r\nis confronted with radically new threats, not the least\r\nof which are global terrorist networks that respect\r\nneither national boundaries nor traditional international\r\nlaw. Clearly, the United Nations needs to fashion new\r\npractical rules to deal with those new threats. Yet, at\r\nthe same time, we must continue to ensure that there\r\nare adequate safeguards against traditional threats.\r\nFinding the right balance between those equally urgent\r\nimperatives will not be easy. But it will not be\r\nimpossible if we can find the discipline to debate the\r\nissues openly and realistically, with a clear\r\nappreciation of both the limitations and the potential of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nSingapore is looking forward to the report of the\r\nHigh-level Panel. We understand that the Panel has\r\nconducted a broad overview of the current international\r\nsituation and has looked at how the international\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\ncommunity could better address the threats, challenges\r\nand change that it faces. Unfortunately, news reports\r\nabout the Panel’s work have focused almost\r\nexclusively on the issue of Security Council reform, as\r\nif that were the only issue that the High-level Panel had\r\nbeen tasked to deal with. The Panel’s discussions have\r\nalso precipitated a race by a number of countries — no\r\nfewer than nine at last count — to put themselves\r\nforward as aspiring new permanent members of an\r\nexpanded Security Council. Four of those aspirants\r\nhave even met to forge a joint strategy.\r\nSingapore is concerned that such a focus on\r\nSecurity Council reform may result in the general\r\nfindings and other important recommendations of the\r\nHigh-level Panel not receiving the attention that they\r\nmerit. Worse still, there is a risk that, if the report of\r\nthe High-level Panel fails to meet the expectations of\r\nthe aspiring States, they might reject the report out of\r\nhand. We sincerely hope and trust that that will not be\r\nthe case.\r\nWe are also concerned that the vying for new\r\npermanent membership foreshadows a fierce fight —\r\nsomething that small States like Singapore do not\r\nrelish. As the saying goes, “Among these elephants,\r\nwhether they fight or make love, it is the poor grass\r\nthat gets trampled”. Indeed, if this tussle heats up,\r\nsmaller States can expect direct pressure — on the one\r\nhand, from these aspirants to support them, and on the\r\nother, from their detractors not to do so.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, I would like to examine\r\nsome of the arguments that have been put forward for\r\nexpanding the Security Council. Many of those\r\narguments are well known. The key argument has been\r\nthat the world has changed tremendously since 1945\r\nbut that the United Nations Charter and the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council — especially its\r\npermanent membership — have remained essentially\r\nunchanged. Let us not forget that the Charter, which\r\ncontains ideals that we must never relinquish, has been\r\ncontinuously interpreted and reinterpreted to meet\r\nchanging geopolitical circumstances and new\r\nchallenges, many of which were unforeseen by the\r\nfounders of the United Nations.\r\nAs regards the institutional structure of the\r\nOrganization — especially that of the Security\r\nCouncil — the configuration in 1945 reflected the\r\nreality of the distribution of power in the world at that\r\ntime. If we were to try to capture the current reality, we\r\nwould be setting ourselves up for a major\r\ndisappointment. The fact is that, at present, one\r\ncountry wields power that far exceeds that of all the\r\nother permanent members and all the aspirants\r\ncombined. If we were to try to make the Council reflect\r\nthat current reality, the only way we could do so would\r\nbe to have just one permanent member. The fact is that\r\nthe United Nations can operate only on the basis of a\r\nhard-headed appreciation of the realities of power. If\r\nwe try to deny that fact and force the issue, we stand to\r\ndo the United Nations a great disservice.\r\nA second frequent argument is that if the Security\r\nCouncil is to be credible, it must be representative.\r\nSome have pointed to the trend of the Council’s\r\nincreasing legislative role in order to argue that urgent\r\nexpansion of the Council is needed, including in its\r\npermanent ranks. But what real guarantee can Member\r\nStates — especially small States like Singapore —\r\nhave that an expanded Council will become more, not\r\nless, open to consultation and that it will take the views\r\nof non-Council members more into account? The\r\nreason for my concern is that, whereas the current five\r\npermanent members represent about 25 per cent of the\r\nworld’s total population, the addition of, say, another\r\nfive permanent members from among the leading\r\naspirants would bring that percentage up to 50 per cent\r\nor more of the world’s population. Since together they\r\nwould represent a majority of the world’s population,\r\nwould that not increase the tendency of the permanent\r\nmembers to feel that they can legitimately make\r\ndecisions on everyone’s behalf?\r\nMoreover, a number of countries have been\r\nsaying that their citizens have been clamouring for\r\ntheir countries to become permanent members in return\r\nfor the significant financial contributions of those\r\ncountries. By the same logic, should Council decisions\r\nalso be influenced if the citizens of the permanent\r\nmembers press directly for particular approaches, on\r\nthe grounds that “he who pays the piper calls the\r\ntune”? That is a real possibility, given that the\r\ncombined contributions to the United Nations budget\r\nof the current permanent members and five of the\r\nleading aspirants would rise from 37.25 per cent to\r\n67.45 per cent. Thus, the legislative role of the\r\nSecurity Council may increase significantly, which\r\nwould risk going beyond what the general membership\r\ncan accept.\r\nThat said, please do not get me wrong, as I am\r\nnot against the expansion of the Security Council.\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nWhat I am saying is that we need to be clear and to\r\nagree on the objectives of such an exercise and how\r\nbest to go about expanding the Council. Unfortunately,\r\nI do not see that as the case after 11 years of\r\ndiscussions in the Open-ended Working Group. In\r\nSingapore’s view, if our aim is to render the Council\r\nmore credible and more effective, we need a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Council in all its aspects,\r\nincluding its working methods. The credibility of an\r\norganization or institution rests not on any nebulous\r\nnotion of representativeness, but on its performance,\r\nwhich determines the degree to which its decisions are\r\naccepted by its stakeholders. Going by the work of the\r\nCouncil over the past year and by its report — which,\r\nunfortunately, was made available only very late last\r\nweek — if Member States are to give an honest\r\nassessment of the Council’s performance in the\r\ndischarge of its functions, I am not sure how well the\r\nCouncil would be rated.\r\nWhat matters to small countries is the Security\r\nCouncil’s effectiveness and transparency and the\r\ninvolvement of non-members when issues of direct\r\ninterest to them are considered. Any organizational\r\nmanagement consultant will tell us that there is no\r\nbetter way to induce good performance than a measure\r\nof transparency and accountability. Regrettably, even\r\nas most governance processes in the world have moved\r\ntowards greater transparency over the last few decades,\r\nthe Security Council until very lately moved in the\r\nopposite direction. Some of us might be astonished to\r\nlearn that the first Security Council meetings and\r\ndiscussions — today, often held in closed sessions —\r\nwere in fact held in the open and on record, with\r\nreports of the frank exchanges available for all to read.\r\nI have circulated, together with my statement, a copy\r\nof the verbatim records of the first Security Council\r\nmeeting on 17 January 1946, which shows clearly the\r\nquality of Council discussions back then. In fact, there\r\nwas so much transparency at the first meeting of the\r\nSecurity Council that the United Kingdom delegate,\r\nwithout realizing that his microphone was switched on,\r\nwas heard saying: “That bloody Chairman has double-\r\ncrossed me again”. That, by the way, does not appear\r\nin the copy of the records that I have circulated.\r\nParadoxically, I submit that, if the Council were\r\nto become more transparent in its normal work, it\r\nwould gain confidentiality where confidentiality\r\nmatters, as everyone will accept that the Council’s\r\nwork necessarily involves a number of sensitive\r\ndiscussions. Conversely, the current practice of holding\r\nall its real discussions behind closed doors has not\r\nenabled the Council to keep anything secret. On the\r\ncontrary, the difficulty posed to non-Council members\r\nin following the proceedings seems to challenge them\r\nto uncover everything that is said behind closed doors,\r\nsometimes resulting in delegates’ feeding off rumours\r\nand misleading information.\r\nAlong with a comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, in considering how to expand the\r\nCouncil’s membership it may also be useful to consider\r\nthe kind of criteria that would help us to reach common\r\nagreement on the optimal new configuration of the\r\nCouncil. Having said that, Singapore is intuitively of\r\nthe view that if the General Assembly can agree on the\r\nexpansion of the permanent membership, Japan and\r\nGermany are two obvious candidates. I should add,\r\nhowever, that any expansion of permanent membership\r\nshould include both developed and developing\r\ncountries and be accompanied by an appropriate\r\nincrease in non-permanent seats to maintain the current\r\nratio of permanent to non-permanent seats.\r\nGiven the time constraint, I shall not delve\r\nfurther into the issue of criteria for now, except to note\r\nthat practically all the aspirants are big States. But that\r\nleads me to wonder whether size is really that essential.\r\nCan big States empathize with and understand the\r\nproblems and concerns of small States, which comprise\r\nthe majority of Member States?\r\nFinally, as the powers of new permanent\r\nmembers are intrinsic to the definition of permanent\r\nmembership, the question of the veto has to be dealt\r\nwith head on. We all know that however undemocratic\r\nthe veto may be, it is here to stay with us for the\r\nforeseeable future. And it is not without a certain\r\nutility insofar as it helps prevent conflicts among the\r\nmajor Powers, which could undermine the United\r\nNations. In fact, the San Francisco decision of 1945\r\nconcerning the veto was deliberately contrived to\r\nprevent the new Organization — the United Nations —\r\nfrom being plagued by what was regarded as the\r\ncritical defect of the League: the non-membership of\r\nsome of the great Powers.\r\nIt has been argued that the veto acts as a failsafe\r\nmechanism, or, as Inis Claude puts it,\r\n“the fuse in the electrical circuit… the\r\nproposition that it is better to have the lights go\r\nout than have the building burst into flames”.\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nIf that justification for the retention of the veto by the\r\noriginal five permanent members has any validity, then\r\nthe question that arises is whether any new permanent\r\nmember that is not given the veto is really deserving of\r\nthat status. In short, the issue of the veto is not a\r\nquestion that can be postponed or discussed separately\r\nfrom the identity of new permanent members. And, for\r\nthat matter, there is no way we can expect the general\r\nmembership of the United Nations to accept being\r\nrelegated from the current second-class status to a new\r\nthird-class status by the creation of a new class of\r\nSecurity Council membership: permanent members\r\nwithout veto rights.\r\nHere, I foresee a difficult problem to overcome,\r\nas none of the existing permanent members has\r\nexpressed a commitment to extending the veto\r\nprivilege to eventual new permanent members. Unless\r\nwe approach that and other issues relating to Security\r\nCouncil reform in a pragmatic and realistic manner, we\r\nmay only end up raising our hopes, but without any\r\ntangible results to show for it at the end of the day.\r\nMr. De La Sablière (France) (spoke in French):\r\nThe report on the work of the Security Council that has\r\nbeen submitted by the United Kingdom presidency\r\ndetails all the activities of the Council over the past\r\nyear. I thank the Romanian delegation, which oversaw\r\nthe drafting of the report, unanimously approved by the\r\nSecurity Council membership.\r\nThis exercise contributes towards the need for\r\ntransparency in the Council’s work and the\r\ndevelopment of critical exchanges between the Council\r\nand the General Assembly. The High-level Panel\r\ncreated by the Secretary-General will soon forward its\r\nrecommendations on the reform of the Organization.\r\nThey will most probably include proposals for\r\nimproving the Security Council’s working methods and\r\nfor making it more effective. France will study the\r\ncontents of that report with the greatest attention and in\r\na constructive and open spirit.\r\nThe question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council\r\nwill also be among the subjects to be addressed by the\r\nPanel’s report. In that regard, as the Foreign Minister\r\nof France recalled in his statement to the General\r\nAssembly on 16 September, France favours an increase\r\nin both categories of membership, permanent and non-\r\npermanent. In that respect, we have voiced our support\r\nfor the candidatures of Germany, Japan, Brazil and\r\nIndia, along with one African State.\r\nFrance hopes that the coming year will provide an\r\nopportunity to register decisive progress on the road to\r\nthe reform of the Organization, especially with respect\r\nto the expansion of the Council. France will continue\r\nto participate actively in the current debate on that\r\nsubject.\r\nMr. Toro Jiménez (Venezuela) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela fully\r\nagrees with the attention being given to issues\r\ninvolving threats to international peace and security\r\nsuch as the situation in Iraq, the situation in the Middle\r\nEast, the question of Haiti and the general situation in\r\nAfrica. Not only have those issues characterized the\r\nwork of the United Nations over the past year but they\r\nhave also underlined the importance of multilateralism\r\nand the urgent need to strengthen the role of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nHowever, we emphasize that it is important for\r\nthe Security Council to define its priorities and to limit\r\nitself to the functions and responsibilities entrusted to\r\nit by the Charter of the United Nations. In that context,\r\nthe Security Council must direct its action to those\r\nsituations representing a definite threat to international\r\npeace and security and avoid deliberations and\r\ndecisions that could entail interference in the internal\r\naffairs of States.\r\nWe take this opportunity to reaffirm our position\r\non some items on the agenda of the Security Council.\r\nVenezuela firmly and categorically condemns\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It\r\nreaffirms its commitment to combating terrorism and\r\nadds its efforts to those of other countries to combat\r\nthat scourge, which is a threat to international peace\r\nand security. But we must say again that terrorism\r\ncannot be fought in a way that will unleash further\r\nterrorism. We must also uncover the causes of acts that\r\nare described as terrorism. Those causes are nothing\r\nother than the poverty and the exploitation to which the\r\nmajority of the world population is subjected. We\r\ntherefore reaffirm that the response to terrorism starts\r\nand ends with the protection and the promotion of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nVenezuela shares the international community’s\r\ndeep concern at the current situation in Iraq. We\r\nreaffirm that the invasion of Iraq by United States\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nforces violates the United Nations Charter and\r\ninternational law. We express our solidarity with the\r\npeople of Iraq in its rightful exercise of self-\r\ndetermination and in its fight to establish a sovereign\r\nand independent Government free from foreign\r\nPowers.\r\nWith respect to the Middle East, Venezuela is\r\nconvinced that a lasting solution to the question of\r\nPalestine is the principal approach for restoring peace\r\nin the region. Venezuela endorses the agreements\r\nreached between Arabs and Israelis in the search for a\r\npeaceful, negotiated settlement. We reaffirm our\r\nsupport of the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to\r\nself-determination, and we support the right of States\r\nof the region to exist within secure, internationally\r\nrecognized borders. We believe that a just solution to\r\nthe Arab-Israeli conflict must be based on Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\r\nHowever, the Government of the Bolivarian Republic\r\nof Venezuela is concerned at the recent military actions\r\nin the Gaza Strip, which have caused a high number of\r\ndeaths and injuries among the civilian Palestinian\r\npopulation. We therefore insist that the aforementioned\r\nSecurity Council resolutions must be complied with.\r\nOur position has always been based on the principles\r\nof domestic and foreign policy contained in our\r\nConstitution, including the promotion and the\r\nprotection of human rights — in this case, in order to\r\ncontribute to peace in the Middle East.\r\nWith respect to Haiti, Venezuela considers it\r\nindispensable to carry out a thorough investigation of\r\nthe causes of the overthrow and kidnapping of\r\nPresident Aristide. The well-being of the Haitians is of\r\nprime importance to us, and we believe that\r\nhumanitarian aid to the people of that country must be\r\nmaintained and strengthened. In the current year,\r\nVenezuela has given the following assistance to Haiti:\r\n$1 million from the budget of the Ministry of Finance,\r\n2 million litres of fuel for the generation of electricity,\r\n$50,000 in direct assistance from the Special Fund for\r\nthe Caribbean for food and medicine for the people of\r\nHaiti. Venezuela is attentively following the unfolding\r\nof events in Haiti and believes that the situation there\r\nshould remain on the agenda of the United Nations.\r\nWith respect to Africa, we stress that Venezuela\r\nsupports the efforts to protect human rights. In that\r\ncontext, while reaffirming respect for the sovereignty,\r\nunity, territorial integrity and independence of the\r\nSudan, we consider that a peaceful solution ought to be\r\nfound for the conflict in the Darfur region, thus\r\nprotecting the civilian population of the country, which\r\nhas been the most sorely affected by the conflict.\r\nWith respect to the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on the Security Council, the increase of\r\nits membership and related matters, the Bolivarian\r\nRepublic of Venezuela reaffirms that Security Council\r\nreform should be conceived as a thorough and\r\nstructural change and that it must necessarily include\r\nthe abolition of the veto power. Only thus can reform\r\nbe positive, progressive and strictly adherent to\r\nmultilateralism on both the question of balanced\r\nrepresentation on the Council and on the increase of its\r\nmembership.\r\nMr. Lippwe (Micronesia): I wish to make a brief\r\ncomment on agenda item 53. The brevity of my\r\nstatement is not intended to minimize either the\r\nimportance of the issue before the Assembly today or\r\nmy delegation’s appreciation of the important and\r\ndaunting task facing our Organization. Rather, it is in\r\nrecognition of the fact that the time has come for us all\r\nto roll up our sleeves and set out to conclude the\r\nimportant work before us.\r\nToday we find ourselves yet again discussing the\r\nquestion of equitable representation on, and increase in\r\nthe membership of, the Security Council. While the\r\ntopic has been on the agenda for years now, the lack of\r\nprogress has been a concern to my delegation.\r\nToday, again, the delegation of Micronesia joins\r\nwith many other members of this body in calling for\r\nattention to be given to the reform of the United\r\nNations. We need a strong and effective United\r\nNations — a United Nations that is able to better\r\nrespond effectively to the challenges of a new era.\r\nFirst and foremost, we call on all the Members of\r\nthis Organization to give fresh consideration to\r\nreforming the Security Council in such a way as to\r\nbetter reflect present-day realities. We note the\r\nincreased and expanded scope of the role of the\r\nSecurity Council in the promotion of international\r\npeace and security. Such an expanded role must be\r\ncarried out with maximum cooperation and\r\nparticipation from the international community. In\r\norder to meet emerging challenges, we see the need to\r\nreform and enlarge the Security Council so that it\r\nbecomes truly representative in both the permanent and\r\nnon-permanent categories of membership. A more\r\nbalanced and representative Security Council would\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nlead to greater international acceptance of the work of\r\nthe Council and would better meet the expectations of\r\npeople around the globe. At the same time, the Council\r\nshould not grow so big as to hamper its effectiveness.\r\nThe developing world, finding itself marginalized in\r\nthe current set-up of the Council, should hold a fair\r\nnumber of seats.\r\nParticular consideration must be given to Japan,\r\none of the largest contributors to the United Nations\r\nbudget and a major participant in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping. Japan has consistently committed\r\nsubstantial resources to the Organization and to the\r\nmaintenance of global peace and security. Any reform\r\nof the Security Council would be incomplete without\r\nJapan’s becoming a permanent member. My delegation\r\nalso believes that Germany and India deserve inclusion\r\nas members on a reformed Council.\r\nFinally, while members of the Assembly are\r\ndiscussing the reform of our Organization, my\r\ndelegation believes that attention must also be given to\r\ncertain obsolete provisions of the United Nations\r\nCharter. The time has come for the “enemy state”\r\nclauses in the United Nations Charter to be removed.\r\nIt is my delegation’s hope that decades of\r\npronouncements will now be translated into action. We\r\nare encouraged that the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change appointed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to consider matters of peace and security will\r\nbegin to come forward with concrete and practical\r\nrecommendations to make the United Nations more\r\nresponsive to global realties. Micronesia looks forward\r\nto the Panel’s report and is ready to do its part as a\r\nresponsible Member of the Organization.\r\nMr. Kuchinsky (Ukraine): First of all, I would\r\nlike to express our gratitude to the President of the\r\nSecurity Council for the month of October,\r\nAmbassador Emyr Jones Parry of the United Kingdom,\r\nfor presenting the annual report of the Security Council\r\n(A/59/2) to the General Assembly. By combining\r\nanalytical components and comprehensive factual\r\nmaterial, this document adds to the promising trend of\r\nthe last several years towards improving the quality of\r\nthese annual guides to the Council’s activities.\r\nDuring the period under review, from August\r\n2003 through July 2004, the international community\r\ncontinued to face numerous daunting challenges which\r\ndirectly relate to the Security Council’s main sphere of\r\nresponsibility: the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. What is the nature of these challenges?\r\nHas the Council succeeded in identifying — if not\r\npreventing — potential threats in a timely manner?\r\nWas that body’s performance in resolving crises and\r\nconflict situations adequate and effective? Has the\r\nSecurity Council made progress in developing a\r\nforward-looking strategy to respond to future global\r\nthreats? Those are just a few of the questions to be\r\naddressed, and they are not merely rhetorical.\r\nUkraine is convinced that the Security Council\r\nshould continue to use its unique potential to mobilize\r\nthe international community to fight terrorism. The\r\nvicious series of heinous terrorist attacks committed\r\naround the world leaves no doubt that the very system\r\nof peace and security set up and promoted by the\r\nUnited Nations is at stake.\r\nWe trust that the establishment of a new, effective\r\nsystem of information exchange on terrorism will be\r\nhelpful in preventing the spread of this scourge. The\r\nframework established by the Security Council for a\r\nglobal response to international terrorism has to be\r\nmaintained and reinforced. In that regard, we believe\r\nthe adoption of resolution 1566 (2004) will further\r\nstrengthen the essential coordinating role of the United\r\nNations in the international campaign against the\r\nterrorist threat. The Counter-Terrorism Committee\r\nshould continue its proactive dialogue with Member\r\nStates. We hope that its Executive Directorate will be\r\nfully operational in the very near future.\r\nThe Security Council has managed to overcome\r\npast differences over the Iraqi issue, showing unity in\r\naddressing that problem. We firmly believe that the\r\nCouncil’s instruments are very important for\r\nnormalizing the situation in that country. Ukraine\r\nwelcomes the Council’s clear definition of the United\r\nNations role in Iraq. Security Council resolution 1546\r\n(2004) achieves one of the main objectives pursued by\r\nUkraine, namely that the United Nations should play a\r\nsubstantial and tangible role in the electoral and\r\nreconstruction processes in Iraq. My country pledges\r\nits assistance to the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General for Iraq in carrying out his\r\ndemanding mission.\r\nWe believe that the Security Council could do\r\nmore than just hold monthly briefings and rare open\r\ndebates in dealing with the crisis in the Middle East.\r\nResolution 1515 (2003), with its endorsement of the\r\nQuartet’s road map, has become a truly important step\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nforward. It has reaffirmed the wide consensus in the\r\ninternational community that that plan provides the\r\nbest way to realize the vision of two States, Israel and\r\nPalestine, living side by side in peace and security. But\r\nadditional concerted efforts are absolutely\r\nindispensable to achieving this result.\r\nMy delegation commends the Security Council\r\nfor its efforts in Afghanistan. Although main\r\nresponsibility for finding a political solution to the\r\nAfghan issue lies squarely with the Afghan people\r\nthemselves, we are convinced that the Security Council\r\nshould continue to be actively involved in resolving all\r\nthe various aspects of that issue.\r\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\r\nthrough non-State actors remains a major threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. We are convinced that\r\nthe Security Council must play a role in the\r\nmultilateral efforts aimed at strengthening the non-\r\nproliferation regime. Therefore we welcome the\r\nadoption of resolution 1540 (2004), which gave an\r\nadditional dimension to those efforts. Ukraine believes\r\nthat it is important for the Council to provide\r\nassistance in implementing this resolution to States that\r\nmay require it.\r\nAnother issue to which I would like to draw the\r\nAssembly’s attention relates to the problem of the so-\r\ncalled frozen conflicts, which were left as unhealed\r\nscars in the newly independent States that emerged\r\nafter the collapse of the Soviet Union.\r\nThe international community cannot turn a blind\r\neye to the lack of progress in the settlement of conflicts\r\nin Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgia, and in\r\nNagorny Karabakh, the Republic of Azerbaijan. There\r\nis also an urgent need to resolve the Transdniestrian\r\nconflict. Postponing a final settlement of those crises\r\nmight have irreversible consequences. We call on\r\ninternational organizations, above all the United\r\nNations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe and other important bodies involved, to\r\naccelerate their respective efforts in resolving those\r\nconflicts.\r\nIn the Balkan region, following the March\r\noutburst of violence in Kosovo, there have been\r\nencouraging developments towards mending the\r\ndamage caused to inter-ethnic dialogue and\r\nreconciliation. The Security Council should continue to\r\nkeep the situation in Kosovo under close scrutiny.\r\nWe welcome the trend towards the further\r\nstrengthening of cooperation between the Security\r\nCouncil and regional organizations. Over the past\r\ndecade, there have been quite a few encouraging\r\nexamples of how United Nations peacekeeping\r\nmissions can be effectively supported and\r\ncomplemented by United Nations-mandated operations\r\nof other organizations. The United Nations could and\r\nshould actively use this important practical tool and\r\nincreasingly rely on regional structures to assume more\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nIn that regard, we are satisfied to see increased\r\ninteraction between the Council and its partners in\r\nAfrica. Making full use of the expertise of African\r\norganizations has proved to be the most effective way\r\nof dealing with African conflicts. For that reason, we\r\nfeel that, confronted with the crisis in Darfur, the\r\nSecurity Council should follow the same path by\r\nproviding the African Union with the necessary\r\nresources and political support.\r\nI think I express our common conviction by\r\nsaying that lessons learned by the international\r\ncommunity during the past year have strengthened our\r\nresolve to make the Security Council more powerful,\r\nunified and proactive. We trust that that goal can be\r\nreached, first and foremost through comprehensive\r\nSecurity Council reform in all its aspects. Ukraine\r\nconsiders the reform of the Council to be a process of\r\nexceptional international significance. Making that\r\nbody more representative and balanced and its work\r\nmore effective and transparent, especially with regard\r\nto the decision-making process, is a prerequisite for\r\nsuccess in the overall adaptation of the United Nations\r\nto the challenging realities of today’s world.\r\nWe take positive note of the increased\r\ninternational attention to the issue of reform that was\r\nexpressly articulated in this Hall just two weeks ago\r\nduring the Assembly’s general debate. I would like\r\nnow to briefly recall some basic elements of my\r\ncountry’s position on this issue.\r\nFirst, Ukraine believes Security Council reform\r\nshould be carried out in strict compliance with the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\r\nSecondly, we attach primary importance to the\r\nallocation of an additional non-permanent seat to the\r\nGroup of Eastern European States. Thirdly, the\r\ninterests of all regional Groups should be taken into\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\naccount in the process of the enlargement of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine pins high hopes on\r\nrelevant recommendations of the High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change and pledges its\r\nconstructive cooperation.\r\nMr. Jeenbaev (Kyrgyzstan) (spoke in Russian):\r\nToday I am delivering one of my first statements in a\r\nplenary meeting of the General Assembly. I wish to\r\ntake this opportunity, Sir, to welcome you in your\r\nimportant position as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session and to wish you\r\ngreat success in your endeavours.\r\nAt the current session, we are once again\r\ndiscussing a key issue relating to the development of\r\nthe work of the Organization, an issue that has been on\r\nour agenda for more than 10 years and which, without\r\nany exaggeration, is of concern to all those for whom\r\nthe United Nations is a common home.\r\nJust a little more than a week separates us from\r\nthe date when together we will all celebrate the fifty-\r\nninth anniversary of the creation of our Organization.\r\nDuring those years, the world has changed\r\nfundamentally. Scholars have made a study of fallen\r\nempires on whose remnants new States have emerged.\r\nThe international situation too has changed drastically.\r\nThe world breathed a sigh of relief following the end\r\nof the cold war; then came new threats and challenges,\r\nfirst and foremost international terrorism in all its\r\nforms.\r\nThe United Nations family has added 140 new\r\nMembers since its creation, and we realize today that\r\nnew measures are required in order to breathe fresh life\r\ninto work of the Security Council, the fundamental\r\norgan of the Organization, and to ensure that an\r\nexpanded Council will be able to react appropriately to\r\nthe events taking place in a rapidly changing world.\r\nAny organ or mechanism can become old or worn out,\r\nand the timely influx of new blood or the replacement\r\nof worn-out parts helps to rejuvenate and strengthen its\r\nwork.\r\nFor example, we are considering the need for and\r\nfeasibility of reforming the Security Council through\r\nincreasing its membership and ensuring more equitable\r\nrepresentation. The Kyrgyz Republic is ready to\r\nsupport proposals aimed at bringing the Organization\r\nfully into line with the realities of the new twenty-first\r\ncentury. Today many States on various continents are\r\nplaying an increasing international role. Without\r\ndetracting from the activities of any other State, we\r\nwish to note the active position of Germany and Japan\r\nin international affairs, their financial contribution to\r\nthe work of the United Nations and the political and\r\neconomic weight of these States on the international\r\nscene.\r\nWe take this opportunity to recall the words of\r\nthe President of the Kyrgyz Republic, as expressed\r\nfrom this rostrum at the 13th meeting of the current\r\nsession: that “the United Nations at its anniversary\r\nsession can and must decide to include Germany and\r\nJapan among the permanent members of the Council”.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic has frequently said that the\r\noptimum would be to expand the Council’s\r\nmembership to 25, with seven permanent members, on\r\nthe basis of equitable geographical distribution.\r\nMoreover, we are convinced that the Security Council\r\nshould be guided primarily by the interests of\r\nhumankind as a whole, resolving issues of a global\r\nnature and avoiding lobbying by regional groups or\r\nother groups of countries to further their own interests.\r\nMr. Guterres (Timor-Leste): We welcome the\r\nreport of the Security Council (A/59/2), introduced by\r\nthis month’s Council President, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\nand Northern Ireland, Sir Emyr Jones Parry. The report\r\nhighlights the challenges and successes of various\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions and\r\npeacemaking efforts. One of these is the United\r\nNations Mission of Support in East Timor\r\n(UNMISET), the mission in my country, Timor-Leste.\r\nOn this occasion, I would like to extend our\r\ndeepest appreciation to Security Council members for\r\ntheir support to the mission. Without their strong\r\ncommitment, and that of our neighbours and of the\r\ninternational community at large, our people would not\r\nhave achieved peace, freedom, democracy and human\r\nrights.\r\nIn May next year, the peacekeeping mission in\r\nTimor-Leste will be terminated. In a meeting last week\r\nbetween the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and\r\nPrime Minister Mari Alkatiri, we reiterated our view\r\nthat the people of Timor-Leste continue to need a\r\nUnited Nations presence to support the justice, finance\r\nand police sectors.\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nWith respect to other issues referred to in the\r\nSecurity Council’s report, we would like to highlight\r\nthe situation in Darfur, in the Sudan. We believe that\r\ncooperation between the Security Council, the African\r\nUnion and the Sudanese Government is the best way to\r\nbring peace and to protect the lives of all peoples in the\r\nregion.\r\nRegarding Western Sahara and Palestine and\r\nother conflicts under consideration, we urge the\r\nSecurity Council to continue its efforts to devise new\r\ninitiatives in order to find a peaceful solution that is\r\nacceptable to the peoples concerned.\r\nThe United Nations is the most precious creation\r\nof a generation of great and visionary leaders. We all\r\nhave inherited this Organization; the memory of the\r\ndestruction and brutality, and the suffering of our\r\nfellow human beings, during the Second World War,\r\nand the profound desire to save future generations from\r\nanother, even more devastating war greatly influenced\r\nthe founding members in shaping the United Nations\r\nCharter and in providing the powers necessary to the\r\ndifferent organs to fulfil their mandates.\r\nOn the eve of the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nOrganization, we have to recognize that, while it is true\r\nthat our world and our peoples have not experienced a\r\nmassive worldwide war, internal conflicts have ravaged\r\nmany of our peoples, many millions of fellow human\r\nbeings have died, and many millions are still suffering.\r\nOur world has changed; there are new challenges\r\nand new threats. The membership of the United\r\nNations has increased from 51 to 191, and we all\r\nrecognize the changes that have occurred and the need\r\nfor the Organization to adapt.\r\nWe welcome the Security Council’s proactive\r\nrole in dealing with terrorism through the creation of\r\nthe Counter-Terrorism Committee, pursuant to\r\nresolution 1373 (2001). We commend the efforts of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group established by General\r\nAssembly resolution 48/26 of 3 December 1993 to\r\nfacilitate discussions on reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. We are also waiting expectantly for the report\r\nof the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\r\nChange.\r\nOn the issue of the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, we have already expressed our support for the\r\npaper put forward by France and Germany which\r\nrecognizes the need to enlarge the Council to around\r\n24 members.\r\nAs my Minister of Foreign Affairs,\r\nMr. Ramos-Horta, has stated, we believe that\r\ndeveloped countries such as Japan and Germany, and\r\ndeveloping countries such as Brazil, Indonesia and\r\nIndia should be allocated permanent seats on the\r\nSecurity Council. We also support the allocation of two\r\nor more permanent seats to Africa, in accordance with\r\nthe decision taken by the heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the African Union at the Harare\r\nSummit.\r\nWe believe that there is a need for the majority of\r\nus — those medium and small countries that are not\r\ncandidates for permanent seats — to continue to\r\nexchange views in order to ensure that the rights of our\r\nnations and peoples are better represented and\r\nprotected.\r\nMr. Choisuren (Mongolia): I would like first to\r\nthank Sir Emyr Jones Parry, Permanent Representative\r\nof the United Kingdom, for having introduced the\r\nreport of the Security Council to this body yesterday\r\nmorning. My delegation fully agrees with the assertion\r\nthat the work of the Security Council was intensive\r\nduring the reporting period, and it is particularly\r\ngratifying that the Council was able to overcome the\r\ndivisions and discord brought about by the military\r\naction in Iraq and to move forward in a constructive\r\nway in fulfilling its responsibility to maintain\r\ninternational peace and stability.\r\nThe past months have once again proved the\r\ncentral role of the United Nations in general and the\r\nleading role of the Security Council as an irreplaceable\r\ninstrument of the international community in the\r\nmaintenance of world peace and security.\r\nConcerning agenda item 53, “Question of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters”, my delegation fully shares the view that the\r\nissue of Security Council reform — which is long\r\noverdue — is key to the overall reform of the United\r\nNations. In that respect, we commend the President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session for his\r\nhard work and the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nhaving made some progress on cluster 2 issues last\r\nyear. The Working Group, however, remains\r\ndeadlocked and unable to agree on the most important\r\ncluster 1 issues, including the enlargement of the\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nSecurity Council, the question of regional\r\nrepresentation, the criteria for membership, the use of\r\nthe veto, accountability, the relationship between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council, and so on.\r\nIndeed, if the Security Council is to carry on its\r\nrole as the principal organ for effective multilateralism\r\nand deal with existing and emerging threats and\r\nchallenges, it has to be thoroughly reformed. It is our\r\nexpectation that the Secretary-General will come up\r\nwith breakthrough reform proposals on the basis of the\r\nreport and the recommendations made by the High-\r\nlevel Panel.\r\nMongolia shares the view that the composition of\r\nthe Security Council should better reflect current world\r\nrealities. My delegation wishes to stress that\r\nenlargement is not a goal in itself. The need for\r\nenlargement arises from the necessity to ensure the\r\nright balance of representation in this important body\r\nas well as the credibility of its decisions. As stipulated\r\nin paragraph 1 of Article 24 of the United Nations\r\nCharter:\r\n“[The] Members confer on the Security Council\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, and agree that in\r\ncarrying out its duties under this responsibility\r\nthe Security Council acts on their behalf.”\r\nThe Security Council thus represents all\r\nMembers. Yet, over the past 59 years, the ratio of that\r\nrepresentation has decreased by a factor of 2.7\r\ncompared to what it was at the time of the\r\nOrganization’s inception. The issue is therefore how to\r\nensure that the composition of the Security Council\r\nduly reflects the current realities of the general\r\nmembership.\r\nMongolia supports a just and equitable\r\nenlargement of the Security Council through an\r\nincrease in the number of both permanent and elected\r\nseats, with the representation of developing and\r\ndeveloped countries ensured. It is hard to understand\r\nwhy Africa and Latin America do not have any\r\npermanent seats in the Council. Likewise, I do not\r\nthink that it is just or right that Asia — home to more\r\nthan half of the world’s population — has only one\r\npermanent seat. Why should Japan, whose contribution\r\nto the United Nations budget exceeds that of four\r\ncurrent permanent members combined, be denied a\r\npermanent membership?\r\nMy delegation is of the view that, in selecting\r\nadditional permanent members, a package approach\r\ncould be adopted, including criteria such as\r\ngeographical distribution, a genuine commitment to the\r\ngoals and objectives of the United Nations, and a\r\ncapacity to contribute substantially to the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. In that respect,\r\nMongolia supports the legitimate aspirations of\r\ncountries such as Japan, Germany and India, which are\r\nwilling and able to shoulder greater responsibility in\r\npursuit of international peace, security and\r\ndevelopment. The composition of the Security Council\r\nshould be small enough to work effectively and large\r\nenough to duly represent the current United Nations\r\nmembership.\r\nWe all know that the greatest strength of the\r\nUnited Nations in general and the Security Council in\r\nparticular is their legitimacy. It is our belief that, if the\r\ngeneral membership has a feeling of being rightly\r\nrepresented in the Council, its decisions will bear more\r\nlegitimacy and credibility and the Member States’\r\nwillingness to abide by its decisions will naturally\r\nincrease, thus greatly enhancing the moral and political\r\nimpacts of its actions. However, such compliance\r\ncannot be taken for granted if the perception of the\r\nlegitimacy of the Council’s decisions is in doubt\r\namong the wider United Nations membership.\r\nAnother important aspect of the Security\r\nCouncil’s reform relates to the very way it works and\r\nfunctions. That body ought to be democratized.\r\nHistorical evidence clearly proves that the veto power\r\nhas been used more often in defence of the national\r\ninterests of the permanent members than for the sake of\r\na common cause, and has thus become one of the main\r\nimpediments to the effectiveness of the work of the\r\nCouncil. In that regard, a comprehensive review of the\r\nveto power should be one of the first priorities. We\r\nbelieve that the proposals offered by some delegations\r\non limiting the veto power to matters under Chapter\r\nVII deserve our close attention. The veto could be\r\nreplaced gradually by consensual decision-making.\r\nThe further democratization of the work of the\r\nCouncil through increased transparency and openness\r\nis also important, especially in the context of reviewing\r\nits relationship with the General Assembly. We note\r\nsome progress in that direction.\r\nThe effectiveness and efficiency of the Security\r\nCouncil as an institution also depend on the further\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nelaboration and development of the specific\r\nresponsibilities of permanent members and elected\r\nmembers alike. If we manage to overcome the\r\nstructural weaknesses of the Security Council and to\r\ncreate such a built-in incentive, a clear-cut sense of\r\ncommon responsibility will emerge and all the Security\r\nCouncil members could work closely together for the\r\ncommon good. Privileges should come with increased\r\nresponsibilities. My delegation would like to stress that\r\nthe reform of the Security Council and its\r\nempowerment should progress in parallel, not in\r\ndetriment to the increased authority and role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly as the chief deliberative, policy-\r\nmaking and representative body of the United Nations.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council, and\r\nespecially its expansion, require the taking of bold\r\npolitical decisions. Perhaps the more than 10 years of\r\nfruitless talks and deadlock prompted the Secretary\r\nGeneral to establish the High-level Panel of experts.\r\nWe should be mindful that time is of the essence. If we\r\nkeep failing in our efforts to reach a consensus and to\r\nsolve the issue of the reform of the Security Council,\r\nvoices for solving the institutional reform outside\r\nUnited Nations bodies could take the upper hand. We\r\nsincerely hope that genuine political will and\r\ndetermination among us will prevail at last.\r\nMr. U Win Mra (Myanmar): At the outset, I\r\nshould like to thank the President of the Security\r\nCouncil for October for introducing the annual report\r\nof the Council for the period under review. Since the\r\nSecurity Council acts on behalf of all Member States in\r\naccordance with the responsibilities entrusted to it by\r\nthe Charter, it is only natural that they be kept\r\ninformed of the work of the Council to enable them to\r\nanalyse and give their views thereon.\r\nMy delegation welcomes various improvements\r\nin the Council’s working methods to promote\r\ntransparency and accountability to the wider\r\nmembership. The increased use of public meetings;\r\nmonthly meetings between the President of the General\r\nAssembly and the President of the Council;\r\nconsultations by the Council’s President with regional\r\ngroups; and regular briefings by the Council’s\r\npresidency for non-members have been cited among\r\nsome improvements of the Council’s working methods.\r\nThe recent consultations between some members\r\nof the Security Council and members of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement on the issue of the\r\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and\r\nthe participation of non-members in a meeting of the\r\nSecurity Council Working Group on peacekeeping are\r\nalso considered to be positive developments in the\r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the\r\nUnited Nations membership as a whole.\r\nDespite some of those improvements, my\r\ndelegation is of the view that the report should be more\r\ncomprehensive, substantive and analytical if we are to\r\nhave a better understanding of the Council’s work.\r\nMoreover, the timely submission of the Council’s\r\nreport is essential to enable the Assembly to effectively\r\nrespond to it.\r\nThere is now a growing tendency to engage in\r\nthematic discussions in the Council. That is a welcome\r\ndevelopment, as it allows greater participation of\r\nMember States in the discussions. However, my\r\ndelegation is of the view that thematic discussions\r\ncarried out by the Council, especially on issues that do\r\nnot fall within the mandate to maintain international\r\npeace and security, can be counterproductive.\r\nMy delegation hails the important work done by\r\nthe Counter-Terrorism Committee, which was\r\nestablished pursuant to Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001). Myanmar unequivocally condemns\r\nterrorism in all forms and manifestations. We are\r\ncooperating closely with the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee. In that, regard I would like to inform the\r\nAssembly that Myanmar has signed or acceded to 11 of\r\nthe 12 international legal instruments related to\r\nterrorism. It has also submitted its third report to the\r\nCommittee.\r\nLet me now turn to the question of the reform of\r\nthe Security Council. The debate on reform has been\r\ngoing on for more than a decade without, however,\r\nhaving produced tangible results. The progress\r\nachieved in consideration of the cluster II issues\r\ndealing with the working methods of the Council is an\r\nencouraging development. Regarding the question of\r\nincrease in membership of the Council,\r\nnotwithstanding the widespread convergence of views\r\nin favour of its increase to better reflect the current\r\nrealities, there are still substantial differences of view\r\nconcerning the size of the Council.\r\nMy delegation is of the view that the Council\r\nshould be expanded in both the permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories so as to be more representative\r\nand reflective of contemporary political and economic\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nrealities. We would also like to underline the\r\nimportance of the need to maintain the efficiency and\r\neffectiveness of the Council in its expansion. Since the\r\nveto is considered to be anachronistic, discriminatory\r\nand undemocratic, its use should be curtailed\r\npreparatory to its complete elimination. It is also our\r\nview that, in the expanded Council, the new permanent\r\nmembers should enjoy the same rights and privileges\r\nas the current members.\r\nIn the United Nations Millennium Declaration of\r\n8 September 2000, heads of State or Government\r\ndecided that efforts to achieve a comprehensive reform\r\nof the Security Council in all its aspects should be\r\nintensified. In this regard, the High-level Panel of\r\nEminent Personalities on Threats, Challenges and\r\nChange, established by the Secretary-General, could\r\nact as a catalyst in giving further impetus to the reform\r\nof the Council. We look forward with keen interest to\r\nits recommendations.\r\nMy delegation commends the good work done by\r\nthe Chairman of the Working Group on Security\r\nCouncil reform, Mr. Julian Hunte, President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session, and the\r\nmembers of his Bureau. In my delegation’s view, the\r\nsix topics put forward by the Bureau for discussion in\r\nthe Working Group remain as valid as ever. Those\r\ntopics should continue to be used as a basis for\r\ndiscussion at the fifty-ninth session, building upon the\r\nwork done during the previous session and with a view\r\nto facilitating the process of reaching general\r\nagreement on the reform of the Security Council.\r\nMr. Mayoral (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nwould like at the outset to thank the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom, Ambassador\r\nSir Emyr Jones Parry, for his introduction of the annual\r\nreport of the Security Council for our consideration.\r\nThe annual discussion of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council in plenary meeting is, we believe, a\r\nnecessary practice that promotes follow-up and\r\nmonitoring of the work of the Security Council by all\r\nMembers of the Organization. We would also like to\r\nthank the President of the General Assembly at its\r\nprevious session, Mr. Julian Hunte, as well as the\r\nPermanent Representatives of Ecuador and of\r\nLiechtenstein, for their efforts in the context of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on Security Council\r\nreform.\r\nThe international community is facing new and\r\nmajor challenges in the area of peace and security.\r\nEvents in recent years have, without doubt, had a\r\nnegative effect on our Organization, particularly the\r\nSecurity Council, as the main body entrusted with\r\ncollective security.\r\nAt the same time, the United Nations is involved\r\nin a comprehensive reform process aimed at enabling it\r\nto adapt its structure and functioning to current\r\nrealities and to make it more effective and more\r\ncredible with regard to its capacity to respond and react\r\nrapidly. There can be no doubt that the current level of\r\nrepresentation on the Security Council — which has\r\nonly 15 members — is not in keeping with\r\ninternational realities. Since the creation of the\r\nOrganization, not only has the number of countries\r\nMembers of the Organization increased\r\ndisproportionately in relation to the number of\r\nmembers of the Council, but the axis of global power\r\nin 1945, reflected in the distribution of permanent seats\r\non the Council, has changed. In the light of that fact,\r\nthere can be no doubt that the Security Council must\r\nchange to reflect the new international realities.\r\nArgentina believes that the reform of the Council\r\nmust be carried out within the broader process of\r\nUnited Nations reform. Likewise, that cannot happen if\r\nbroad consensus is not achieved first. It cannot be an\r\nisolated event; nor can it be partial — limited solely to\r\nan increase in the number of members. Its working\r\nmethods must be reformed with a view to increasing its\r\ntransparency and efficiency.\r\nThe Security Council must be more\r\nrepresentative — that is clear. But it must also be more\r\ndemocratic. That has been the traditional position of\r\nour country. Our delegation was a participant in the\r\nSan Francisco Conference of 1945 and, referring to the\r\nright to veto, we stated at the time that we were not\r\nopposed to it, since what is just and desirable in a legal\r\nsense may not be politically possible.\r\nSpeaking to the General Assembly in 1946, the\r\nfirst Permanent Representative of the Argentine\r\nRepublic to the United Nations, Ambassador José\r\nArce, stated that the right to veto should be eliminated\r\nin favour of the exercise of the combined will of two\r\nthirds or three quarters of the members of the Council.\r\nWhile today it may be politically impossible to\r\ncompletely eliminate the veto, we believe that\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nconditions do exist to limit its use solely to cases\r\nprovided for under Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nAs Argentina has reaffirmed since the discussions\r\non Council reform began, we support an increase in the\r\nmembership of the Council — but only in the non-\r\npermanent category. The permanent seats are the result\r\nof a special situation existing after the Second World\r\nWar, as is the right to veto, which was granted to the\r\npermanent members.\r\nArgentina has an open position on Council\r\nreform. We can explore different alternatives and\r\nmobilize the international community in the process of\r\nreform in order to find formulas that are better adapted\r\nto the work that we are doing. Argentina is not against\r\nanyone; we are simply in favour of a much more\r\ndemocratic Security Council.\r\nWe await with interest the report of the High-\r\nlevel Panel convened by the Secretary-General, and we\r\ntrust that it will be able to provide positive elements\r\nthat enable us to move forward in the process of\r\nreform.\r\nArgentina has contributed to the work of the\r\nPanel by submitting a position paper dealing with\r\nvarious matters, including Security Council reform.\r\nThe proposals of the Panel must be considered by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. As we all know, that is the only\r\nbody that can take a decision on reform. Any\r\ndevelopment related to reform must be carried out by\r\nmeans of recommendations submitted in due course to\r\nthe General Assembly by the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on Security Council reform. Such\r\nrecommendations should be adopted by general\r\nagreement.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that the\r\nobjective of Security Council reform is to ensure\r\ncompliance with the purposes of the United Nations,\r\nrespecting the interests of all Member States. Only in\r\nthat way can we strengthen the main body entrusted\r\nwith collective security.\r\nThe images that we see daily in the media should\r\nprompt us not to make a mistake but to act for the\r\nfuture of our Organization — which is the future of\r\nhumanity as a whole. Let us not miss this opportunity.\r\nLet us carry out reform in the interests of the\r\ndemocratization and efficiency of the Security Council.\r\nMr. Beck (Palau): In pursuit of the most effective\r\nmeans of strengthening the credibility of the United\r\nNations, Palau urges this body to reform the Security\r\nCouncil so that it reflects the realities of the\r\ninternational community in the twenty-first century. It\r\nis our belief that countries that consistently play a\r\nmajor role in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security should always participate in the decision-\r\nmaking processes of the Security Council.\r\nPalau believes that the Security Council should\r\nbe expanded to include developing and developed\r\ncountries as new members. While several countries —\r\non the basis of their active world leadership, their large\r\npopulations and their geographic positions — are\r\nappropriate candidates for permanent membership in a\r\nreformed Security Council, Palau wishes at this time to\r\nspecifically endorse only Japan. Japan’s stellar record\r\nof contribution to the United Nations and its leadership\r\nin international initiatives for many years constitute a\r\nsolid and undeniable basis for its assumption of\r\npermanent membership in the Security Council.\r\nMr. Pleuger (Germany): We would like to\r\nassociate ourselves with the call — made by the\r\nrepresentatives of many delegations who have spoken\r\nbefore us — for bold and comprehensive reform of the\r\nUnited Nations system. We agree that such reform\r\nshould aim for the greatest possible effectiveness,\r\ncredibility, legitimacy and transparency.\r\nWe are also convinced of the need for enhanced\r\ncooperation among the organs of the United Nations. In\r\nthat respect, Germany has suggested, first,\r\nstrengthening the role of the General Assembly by\r\nbetter focussing and streamlining our work; secondly,\r\nmaking use of the potential of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil as the central organ for decision-making on\r\neconomic and social issues and as a partner of the\r\nSecurity Council in peacekeeping and peace-building;\r\nand thirdly, opening up forums on peacekeeping to a\r\nwider group of interested States among the United\r\nNations membership, thus ensuring better interaction\r\nbetween the membership and the Security Council.\r\nAmong our efforts to increase the effectiveness\r\nand credibility of the United Nations, reform of the\r\nSecurity Council is certainly among the most\r\nimportant. In recent years, the responsibilities and\r\ncompetences of the Security Council have constantly\r\nexpanded. The number of conflicts demanding Council\r\ninvolvement is increasing. In the future, we want to\r\nplace even more stress on crisis prevention and peace-\r\nbuilding. Such a comprehensive approach will require\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nadditional resources as well as closer cooperation\r\namong Member States and among United Nations\r\norgans.\r\nAt the same time, the Council must deal with new\r\nthreats to international security. Failing States,\r\nterrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction raise the question of whether the Charter\r\nand international law provide the instruments\r\nnecessary to deal with those new challenges. The\r\nresponsibility to protect, the legality of pre-emptive\r\nmilitary action and the question of how to prevent\r\nimpunity in cases of gross human rights violations are\r\nsome of the issues that must be addressed. In that\r\nregard, we are looking forward to the report of the\r\nSecretary-General’s High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change in early December.\r\nThe Security Council has responded to some of\r\nthese new threats by embarking on an increasingly\r\nlegislative role, setting rules for the international\r\ncommunity. That is true for the work of the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee and for that of the Security\r\nCouncil Committee established pursuant to resolution\r\n1540 (2004), as well as for resolution 1566 (2004) on\r\nterrorism, adopted by the Council as recently as\r\n8 October this year.\r\nWhen the Security Council legislates, it sets rules\r\nfor the United Nations membership as a whole. That\r\nmeans that 15 Security Council members decide and\r\n176 United Nations Members plus 191 parliaments are\r\nexcluded from the decision-making process. Against\r\nthat background, it is essential to change the structure\r\nof the Council of 1945 to enable it to meet the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. Here, two\r\nelements, in our view, are of the utmost importance:\r\nfirst, the Security Council — especially when is it\r\nlegislating — needs more legitimacy through better\r\nrepresentativity; and secondly, the Security Council\r\nmust include, on a permanent basis, major resource\r\nproviders and major regional players. To face those\r\nchallenges, the Council must be able to implement its\r\ndecisions effectively and must be seen as legitimate.\r\nWe believe that the Council can achieve that only if it\r\nreflects the political changes of the past 50 years and\r\ntoday’s geopolitical realities.\r\nThe conclusion to be drawn from this need to\r\nadapt the Security Council to today’s demands is\r\nessentially twofold.\r\nFirst, the composition of the Council should\r\nreflect the growth in United Nations membership and\r\ngive the Council added legitimacy by increasing the\r\nnumber of permanent as well as non-permanent\r\nmembers. Decolonization, new non-nuclear global\r\nplayers, the end of the cold war, the increase in United\r\nNations membership to 191 countries — all those\r\ndevelopments should be mirrored in the composition\r\nand working methods of the Security Council.\r\nSecondly, all regions of the South should be\r\nrepresented by permanent members. That would offer\r\nus the chance to further enhance the voice of the\r\ndeveloping world in the Council. We do not agree with\r\nthose who want to deny permanent seats to the\r\ndeveloping world in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\r\nExpanding the Council only by increasing the number\r\nof non-permanent seats would not change the structure\r\nof the Council; on the contrary, adding only\r\nnon-permanent seats would cement the outdated\r\nstructure of 1945.\r\nTherefore, in our view, countries that are willing\r\nand able to make a particularly meaningful\r\ncontribution to the maintenance of world peace should\r\nbecome permanent members. That applies to major\r\nresource providers among the developed countries as\r\nwell as to major players in the developing world.\r\nFor those reasons, we have decided to take on the\r\nresponsibility associated with a permanent seat, and we\r\nsupport the readiness of Brazil, India and Japan to do\r\nthe same. Again, I would like to stress that we consider\r\nit particularly important that Africa also be adequately\r\nrepresented among the new permanent members.\r\nWe look forward to the ideas of the High-level\r\nPanel, as we believe that they will provide very\r\nimportant new impetus for the crucial question of\r\nreform. I am confident that, during the present session\r\nof the General Assembly, all of us will work together\r\non that question with commitment and creativity.\r\nMr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): The\r\nSenegalese delegation is pleased to see you, Sir,\r\npresiding over the work of the General Assembly in\r\nyour usual outstanding manner. I should like to express\r\nto you our gratitude for having devoted the meetings of\r\nthe past two days to the consideration of agenda items\r\n11 and 53, relating, respectively, to the report of the\r\nSecurity Council (A/59/2) and to the question of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nmembership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters.\r\nMy statement will deal only with item 53 of the\r\nagenda. In that connection, Sir, we wish first of all to\r\nexpress our gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Julian\r\nHunte of Saint Lucia, who during the previous session\r\nchaired in an able and dedicated manner the Open-\r\nended Working Group charged with considering this\r\nimportant question. We wish also to commend his two\r\nVice-Chairmen, Mr. Luis Gallegos Chiriboga of\r\nEcuador and Christian Wenaweser of Liechtenstein.\r\nThe excellent report before us today is an accurate\r\nreflection of their strong belief in the importance of the\r\ntask entrusted to them: to meet the deep aspirations of\r\nthe States and peoples of the world to see rapid and\r\nsubstantial reform in the Security Council in terms of\r\nboth its composition and its functioning.\r\nThat strong aspiration can be explained by the\r\nfollowing: the accession since 1960 of a large number\r\nof States to national sovereignty; the extent and\r\ncomplexity of the tasks confronting the United Nations\r\ntoday; the recent emergence of new challenges to\r\ninternational peace and security; and the desire for a\r\nmore transparent and more democratic management of\r\nour Organization, which we hold so dear.\r\nAll of those factors should lead us to cross, in a\r\npositive and progressive spirit, the Rubicon and to\r\ntransform the Security Council into an organ that is\r\ntruly representative of Member States and that is better\r\nprepared to carry out the tasks with which it is\r\nentrusted in the Charter of the United Nations. Such a\r\nreadjustment is even more necessary given that the\r\nratio of Security Council members to General\r\nAssembly members, which was 11 to 51 in 1945, or\r\n21.56 per cent, is distinctly higher than the current\r\nratio, which is only 15 to 191, or 7.85 per cent.\r\nThese figures illustrate the considerable decline\r\nin the rate of representation of Member States in the\r\nSecurity Council, and show that an important United\r\nNations organ is frozen in time, a prisoner of its own\r\nprocedures, whereas the international context has\r\nundergone profound transformations since 1945.\r\nIn view of the magnitude of the task ahead of us,\r\nAfrica — with all 55 African Member States speaking\r\nwith one voice — has already clearly indicated its firm\r\nwill to play a part in a restructured Security Council\r\nthat is adapted to its environment. Indeed the\r\ndeclaration of Heads of State and Government of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity — which has since\r\nbecome the African Union — adopted at Harare on\r\n4 June 1997 recommended an expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council to 26 members. In that framework,\r\nthe African continent would have two permanent and\r\nfive non-permanent seats which it would allocate to\r\nAfrican States according to a system of a rotation\r\nbased on criteria predetermined by the Africans\r\nthemselves.\r\nSenegal shares the view of the majority of States\r\nthat the right to veto is inequitable, discriminatory and\r\nanachronistic, and that therefore we need progressively\r\nto eliminate it, in the meantime reducing its scope of\r\napplication to draft resolutions relating to measures\r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, I wish to reiterate here a\r\nproposal that the delegation of Senegal made in 1997\r\nthat an in-depth debate be taken up with the current\r\npermanent members of the Security Council in order to\r\nwork with them to arrive at realistic approaches to the\r\ntemporary use of the veto.\r\nAnother important issue considered by the\r\nWorking Group involves the criteria that must be met\r\nin order to be a member of the Security Council. There\r\nare two, set out in Article 23 of the Charter: the\r\ncapacity to contribute to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, and respect for the\r\nprinciple of equitable geographic representation. While\r\nthe second condition should pose no problem, the first\r\nis sometimes seen from a restrictive point of view as\r\nrelating only to financial contributions to peacekeeping\r\noperations and their implementation.\r\nSenegal, which, since joining the United Nations,\r\nhas been a major contributor of troops to peacekeeping\r\noperations, cannot accept such a narrow definition. We\r\nmust therefore take into account the human aspect of\r\ncontributions to peacekeeping operations as well as\r\nnew criteria such as the rule of law and a sense of\r\ninternational responsibility on the part of Member\r\nStates.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the report’s view of the\r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Throughout the years we have\r\nnoted a worrisome trend towards the increasing\r\npre-eminence of the Security Council over the General\r\nAssembly. Indeed, the Security Council, which has\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, more and more\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nfrequently is seized with questions falling within a\r\nbroader scope than that of its mandate. I refer here to\r\nthe numerous thematic items that are considered by the\r\nSecurity Council, which are, according to the letter and\r\nspirit of the Charter, within the purview of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nA rebalancing of the tasks of the Security Council\r\nand the General Assembly is therefore necessary. To\r\nthat end, it would suffice to work on the basis of the\r\nrelevant provisions of the Charter. The effectiveness of\r\nthe future action of our universal Organization is at\r\nstake.\r\nI wish in conclusion to reiterate my delegation’s\r\ndetermination to support all initiatives that will need to\r\nbe undertaken in order to meet the challenge of\r\nreforming the Security Council. In that difficult but\r\nfeasible exercise, all of us without exception will need\r\nplenty of realism, pragmatism and faith in the future in\r\norder to contribute to strengthening the credibility of\r\nthe Security Council, an organ so vital to the structure\r\nof the United Nations and, for that reason, so useful in\r\nthe promotion of international peace and security.\r\nMr. Spatafora (Italy): On item 11, I would like\r\nto thank and express my most sincere appreciation to\r\nthe President of the Security Council, Sir Emyr Jones\r\nParry, for his very effective and balanced presentation\r\nof the annual report of the Security Council. We have a\r\nvision, we have good suggestions, and a sense of\r\ndirection. There has definitely been an improvement as\r\nfar as transparency, inclusiveness and accountability\r\nare concerned.\r\nOf course, a lot more remains to be done, as\r\nAmbassador Baali of Algeria, among many others, has\r\npointed out. We are sure that the High-level Panel\r\nreport will offer a meaningful contribution to our\r\nthoughts on this issue.\r\nI will come now to the other item on our agenda,\r\nthe question of equitable representation on the Security\r\nCouncil and related matters. Our most sincere\r\nappreciation goes to the former President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Mr. Julian Hunte, for the\r\ncommitment, political flair and determination that he\r\nhas shown in pushing forward the agenda. My thanks\r\nand sincere appreciation also go to Ambassador\r\nGallegos of Ecuador and Ambassador Wenaweser of\r\nLiechtenstein for their outstanding contributions.\r\nI will focus here on a few key principles — in\r\nfact six principles — that Italy feels are crucial for\r\ncarrying out successful reform.\r\nPrinciple No. 1: broad consensus. Like any\r\nconstitutional reform in any of our countries (I mean\r\nthose countries that have a written constitution), reform\r\nof the Security Council should not have divisive\r\nrepercussions within the membership, otherwise it will\r\ndefeat the very purpose of United Nations reform. Any\r\nreform proposal will have to build upon a broad\r\npolitical consensus. Every effort should therefore be\r\nmade by all of us, in a spirit of flexibility and\r\npragmatism, to promote an approach that will be able\r\nto command broad support in the Assembly. From this\r\npoint of view, the Secretary-General’s Panel, and if I\r\nmay say so, the Secretary-General himself, should seek\r\nto promote such consensus for an equitable and\r\ncomprehensive reform proposal. I note that even\r\ncountries that are in favour of an increase in the\r\nnumber of permanent members are well aware of the\r\nneed for broad consensus, since only broad consensus\r\nwill prevent disaffection among Member States, which\r\nwould otherwise be tempted to disengage from the\r\nprocess. If States disengage, there will be no possibility\r\nof creating a more effective and efficient United\r\nNations.\r\nIn this vein, may I recall what Ambassador Emyr\r\nJones Parry said yesterday. He said, “We would\r\nencourage all Member States to engage constructively\r\nin the debate in order to find a solution on which all\r\ncan agree.” Let me also quote what our Russian\r\ncolleague, Ambassador Denisov, said a few hours ago:\r\n“the achievement of the broadest possible consensus\r\nshould remain the key benchmark in the reform\r\nprocess.” Today and yesterday many other colleagues,\r\nfrom Algeria to China and New Zealand (on behalf of\r\nCanada, Australia, New Zealand), Argentina and\r\nMexico, inter alia, have spoken along the same lines\r\nabout the need for a broad consensus.\r\nPrinciple No. 2: the current imbalance in the\r\nNorth-South presence on the Security Council. There is\r\na fundamental and urgent need to address this issue, if\r\nwe wish to have a Security Council more in tune with\r\nthe world of today, and therefore more credible and\r\neffective. I think that there is definitely common\r\nground among the Membership here as well. But I\r\ndoubt whether it would make sense, given the widely\r\nperceived need for more equitable representation, to\r\nincrease the number of permanent members by five\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nseats, and give 40 per cent of the benefit to two\r\ncountries of the industrialized world. There has to be a\r\nbetter way to more effectively redress the North-South\r\nimbalance.\r\nPrinciple No. 3: comprehensiveness. In other\r\nwords, what is needed, and what we want, is a “whole-\r\npackage approach” in the reform process, one that is\r\naimed at strengthening the United Nations and\r\nenhancing its ability to meet current and future\r\nchallenges effectively in the field of peace and\r\nsecurity, and also, and with equal priority, in the field\r\nof development. We will have to address policy, as well\r\nas institutional, issues, above and beyond the matter of\r\nSecurity Council enlargement. Among those issues, I\r\nwould mention, inter alia, the refocusing of the\r\ninterrelationship among the Security Council, the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil; the strengthening of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil; and the redefining of the working methods of\r\nthe Security Council. I would like here to recall what\r\nour colleague from New Zealand expressed so clearly\r\nyesterday, when he said, “first, including Security\r\nCouncil reform within a broader package may increase\r\nrather than decrease the prospect of achieving\r\nconsensus on it. Secondly, the Security Council is at\r\nthe core of the United Nation’s response to threats to\r\ninternational security ... Accordingly, proposals for\r\nenhancing collective action in dealing with a broad\r\nspectrum of threats cannot sensibly be separated from\r\nthe issue of the representativeness of the Council. What\r\nthe Council does and who is sitting on it are\r\ninextricably linked”.\r\nIn other words, it would make neither common\r\nnor political sense to de-link our proceedings:\r\nreforming and enlarging the Security Council during\r\nthe first months of 2005, and proceeding on the\r\nsubstantive issues of what the Security Council, and in\r\nmore general terms, the United Nations, must deliver,\r\nin the second part of the year, in the framework of the\r\nmajor event of 2005, as well as in the follow up to the\r\nforthcoming report of the Secretary-General’s High-\r\nlevel Panel.\r\nIn fact, on the contrary, separate consideration of\r\nthe issue of Security Council expansion will not\r\nprevent the sidelining of the other major\r\nrecommendations of the Panel. That is why we support\r\na comprehensive review in 2005 of major United\r\nNations conferences, within the umbrella framework of\r\nthe Millenniums Declaration and the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nAs for the report of the High-level Panel, allow\r\nme, again, to recall what Ambassador Jones Parry said\r\nin urging the Panel to make sure that its proposals\r\nreinforce the Council’s ability to carry out the\r\nresponsibilities entrusted to it by the Charter. I would\r\nalso here reiterate the thought so aptly expressed by\r\nour New Zealand colleague when he said, “we urge\r\nMember States not to seek to pre-empt the Panel’s\r\nreport, but rather to respect the Panel’s independence\r\nand keep an open mind on possible ways forward”.\r\nPrinciple No. 4: inclusiveness, and principle\r\nNo. 5: accountability. I will address them together\r\nbecause they are inextricably linked. I will begin by\r\nrecalling, once again, what our New Zealand colleague\r\nsaid yesterday: “we look to enhanced opportunities for\r\nSecurity Council membership for all Member Sates,\r\nnot just a privileged few”.\r\nThat is why the proposal to add new permanent\r\nmembers, even without veto power, would entail\r\nserious drawbacks. It would be highly divisive among\r\nthe United Nations membership, and would establish a\r\nnew layer of hierarchy within the Council itself. Do we\r\nreally want to have a first-class membership, a second-\r\nclass membership and a third-class membership? The\r\nUnited Nations, as the Chinese Foreign Minister\r\nrecently recalled, is not a corporate concern, a\r\ncompany or a fund listed on the stock exchange, with\r\nclass A shares, class B shares and class C shares.\r\nWhatever the so-called G-4 may say, and\r\nhowever attractive the packaging of that reform\r\nscenario might be, the fact is that we would be laying\r\nthe foundation for what would become, by definition,\r\nnew privileges for some members to the detriment of\r\nothers. And that would go against the tide in a world\r\nwhere priority is now given, and has to be given, to an\r\nongoing process of democratization in the management\r\nof international relations through multilateral\r\ninstitutions. Every Member State of this Assembly, as a\r\nstake-holder, should feel comfortable and should feel\r\nthat it will be able to participate and contribute more\r\nequitably. I ask you, would the addition of new\r\npermanent members, who are not accountable to the\r\nmembership through elections, make this happen?\r\nLet us keep clear in our minds that the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council, whatever shape it\r\ntakes, will be limited. The figure generally mentioned\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nis around 24 members. With a higher number of\r\nmembers, the Security Council would not be effective\r\nand efficient. If that is the case, it has to be clear to all\r\nMember States that we have a zero-sum game. If we\r\nincrease the number of permanent members, there will\r\nbe less room for the rest of the membership, which\r\nmust compete for the non-permanent seats. We will\r\ngive seats, let us suppose, to five Member States,\r\nwhich would become permanent members. What we\r\ngive to them we will be taking away from what the\r\nother 181 Member States have the right to expect with\r\nregard to their possibility of making a direct\r\ncontribution to shaping the Security Council’s actions\r\nand policies.\r\nLet us not forget that after 60 years, there are still\r\n77 countries — 40 per cent of the membership — that\r\nhave never served on the Security Council. How best\r\ncan we address that situation? Certainly not by\r\nincreasing the number of members of the Security\r\nCouncil and by freezing more than half the increase —\r\nfive of nine seats — in favour of a few members.\r\nMoreover, adding new permanent members\r\nwould, by definition, go against the principle of\r\naccountability, according to which all members of the\r\nSecurity Council should undergo periodic scrutiny\r\nthrough elections in the General Assembly. Let us not\r\nforget that in its action, the Organization is stressing\r\nmore and more — and preaching to Members — the\r\nneed to improve governance. And improving\r\ngovernance means improving accountability because\r\naccountability is the substance of democracy and the\r\nfoundation for healthy and sound development.\r\nPrinciple No. 6: is the need to strengthen the role\r\nand the weight of the regional and geopolitical factor\r\nin the Security Council. On this issue, too, I feel that\r\nthere is common ground among the membership, and\r\nwe will have to build on it. Ambassador Kumalo of\r\nSouth Africa spoke very clearly yesterday of the\r\nimportance of placing greater emphasis on Chapter\r\nVIII of the Charter and on the operational relationship\r\nbetween the Security Council and regional\r\norganizations. Ambassador Baali of Algeria and others\r\nhave spoken along the same lines.\r\nI would therefore say that any proposal for\r\nreform of the Security Council should focus on the\r\nimportance of the regional and geopolitical factor,\r\nregional constituencies and regional interests rather\r\nthan national interests. To that end, a closer\r\nrelationship should be built between elected members\r\nand their regional constituencies. That would enhance\r\nthe accountability of elected members and ensure that\r\ndeliberations are perceived as more legitimate.\r\nIn other words, more should be done to give\r\nrelevance and weight to regional and geopolitical\r\nrealities within the United Nations system and in the\r\nSecurity Council. As far as Italy is concerned, as a\r\nfounding member of the European Union, the\r\ndepositary of its treaties and the host of the solemn\r\nsignature on 29 October of the new European\r\nConstitution, we believe that today’s European Union,\r\nwith the strength 25 of members, has a fundamental\r\ncontribution to make to the purposes of the United\r\nNations. Italy is working to find, on a consensual basis,\r\nways and means to allow the European Union to speak\r\nin the Security Council with a single, more influential\r\nvoice. We realize, of course, that it will not be an easy\r\npath and that within the United Nations each regional\r\nconstituency finds itself at a different stage of political\r\nand socio-economic development. Nonetheless, we feel\r\nthat we must stay the course and not jeopardize the\r\nachievement of that goal.\r\nIn the meantime, to sum up, we will have to\r\nshape Security Council reform so that such reform\r\nbetter responds to the contribution that each Member\r\nState is capable of and willing to offer for the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security and the other\r\npurposes of the United Nations, as foreseen in Article\r\n23, paragraph 1 of the Charter; gives more appropriate\r\nweight to the regional and geopolitical factor while at\r\nthe same time redressing the current North-South\r\nimbalance; and takes into account the need to ensure,\r\nthrough the election of all members of the Security\r\nCouncil, accountability, inclusiveness and ownership\r\nby the membership.\r\nTo accommodate all those principles, values and\r\nneeds, we will have to be flexible, dispense with\r\nentrenched positions and keep our minds open to new\r\nand bold scenarios of reform. That reform could be\r\ncentred, for example, on the concept of the rotation of\r\nelected members for a given seat, not excluding the\r\npossibility of a longer duration and/or a more frequent\r\npresence in the Council than what is currently foreseen\r\nby the Charter.\r\nMany colleagues — Algeria, Uruguay, Mexico,\r\nSenegal, as we heard a few minutes ago, and many\r\nothers — have in fact referred to such a scenario of\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nrotating elected members in regional seats. We are\r\nconvinced that such a scenario, which would safeguard\r\nthe fundamental principles of the kind of democracy in\r\nwhich we believe, would be able to command a broad\r\nconsensus across the membership. If the High-level\r\nPanel recommends a proposal for reform of that kind in\r\nany of its many possible variations, the proposal will\r\nno doubt receive the strongest support across the board.\r\nLet us work for it. Let us have vision and not just focus\r\non our narrow national interests.\r\nMr. Diarra (Mali) (spoke in French): My\r\ndelegation thanks the Bureau of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters Related to the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe document submitted by Mr. Julian Hunte and\r\nhis two Vice-Chairmen faithfully reflects the current\r\nstate of affairs on the question. We have also taken\r\nnote of the report to the fifty-eighth session of\r\n13 September 2004. We have given the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group the mandate of pursuing the current\r\nefforts, taking into account the results achieved since\r\nits creation under resolution 48/26 of 3 December\r\n1993. We have also taken into account the experience\r\nacquired at the last session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe question of equitable representation on the\r\nSecurity Council is one of the most complex that our\r\nOrganization has ever faced. But my delegation\r\nbelieves that the issue is a worthy one. It is clear that\r\nthe process of democratizing the organs of the United\r\nNations and making their working methods more\r\ntransparent has broken down when one notes that the\r\nnumber of Security Council members represented at\r\nthe time of its creation was 21.56 per cent of the total\r\nnumber of Member States of the Organization, and\r\ntoday represents no more than 7.85 per cent of Member\r\nStates.\r\nThe Security Council is in reality increasingly\r\nbecoming the centre of the Organization, to the\r\ndetriment of the other principal organs, in particular\r\nthe General Assembly. The Council’s thematic debates\r\naddress questions traditionally reserved for other\r\norgans. Likewise, its regulatory functions are growing,\r\nas demonstrated by the adoption of resolutions 1540\r\n(2004) and 1566 (2004). Moreover, the use of the veto\r\nis not in the collective interest; it conforms to the\r\nstrictly national interests of the countries with the veto\r\npower.\r\nGiven all those circumstances, some of which are\r\nalmost as old as the Organization itself, it is more\r\nappropriate than ever to keep the debate open on the\r\ntwo groups of questions indicated by the Working\r\nGroup. Those questions concern, on the one hand, the\r\nexpansion of the membership of the Security Council\r\nand related issues and, on the other, the Council’s\r\nworking methods and the transparency of its work.\r\nWith regard to the issue of the representativeness\r\nof the Council, it would be only just from a historical\r\npoint of view to allow those nations that were freed\r\nfrom the colonial yoke following the creation of the\r\nUnited Nations to be represented equitably. Such\r\nredress of historical injustice should primarily benefit\r\nthe African and Asian States. Furthermore, there are a\r\nnumber of crisis situations in our continent, which the\r\nUnited Nations currently has under consideration.\r\nAfrica therefore wishes to assume its share of\r\nresponsibility in the effort to maintain international\r\npeace and security. Our continent is making\r\ncontribution in that respect, under Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter, through the establishment of subregional\r\nmechanisms for conflict prevention, management and\r\nresolution, as well as the more recently created Peace\r\nand Security Council, which covers the entire\r\ncontinent. We are also strengthening our cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations system in the area of conflict\r\nprevention and management.\r\nMindful of that responsibility, Africa adopted a\r\nDeclaration in 1997 at Harare, affirming the vital need\r\nto guarantee equitable geographic representation within\r\nthe Security Council. Hence, there is a need to expand\r\nthe membership to reflect the increase in the number of\r\nStates Members of the United Nations. The expansion\r\nshould affect the two categories of membership, with\r\nthe expanded Council having 26 members. Two\r\npermanent seats should go to the African continent,\r\nand the number of non-permanent seats for Africa on\r\nthe expanded Council should increase to five — as\r\nopposed to the current three. The African States would\r\nthemselves designate the permanent African members,\r\nand their decision could then be endorsed by the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMy delegation also believes that certain\r\nindustrialized countries whose contribution to the\r\nOrganization in terms of both financial resources and\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\npeacekeeping should benefit from permanent seats in\r\nthe expanded council.\r\nFurthermore, certain developing countries should\r\nalso be given favourable consideration by virtue of the\r\nsize of their population and their contribution to the\r\nUnited Nations, as well as their role in international\r\ntrade, with its new geographical realities.\r\nThe new permanent members will have the same\r\nprerogatives and the same powers as the current\r\nmembers. Africa supports the gradual limiting of the\r\nuse of the veto until its total elimination can be\r\nachieved.\r\nMy delegation believes, however, that no\r\ndecision should be taken before general agreement is\r\nreached on that group of questions or on those relating\r\nto the second group of questions concerning the\r\nworking methods of the Council. The effort to\r\nrestructure the Security Council needs to be sustained\r\nand pursued, but it should not be subjected to timetable\r\nconstraints.\r\nOn the question of the transparency of the\r\nworking methods of the Council, the report notes\r\nrecent improvements, such as those listed in paragraph\r\n60. In my delegation’s view, these efforts aimed at\r\nimprovement must be continued along the lines\r\nprovided for in Assembly resolutions 51/193 of\r\n17 December 1996 and 58/126 of 19 December 2003.\r\nAs to new threats, my delegation is looking\r\nforward to the conclusions of the report of the panel set\r\nup by the Secretary-General.\r\nIn conclusion, on the question of the use of the\r\nveto, my delegation believes that with regard to vital\r\nquestions relating to a threat to the peace, a breach of\r\nthe peace or an act of aggression, the General\r\nAssembly, according to resolution 377 (V) of\r\n3 November 1950, could make recommendations to\r\nMember States in the common interest with regard to\r\nthose actions to be undertaken.\r\nMr. Sar (Cambodia): It is my honour, on behalf\r\nof the delegation of the Royal Government of\r\nCambodia, to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession. Thanks in good measure to your leadership, I\r\nam fully confident that your experience and skills will\r\nbring the work of this session to a successful\r\nconclusion, thus helping us to achieve our common\r\ngoal of creating a better world for all to live in.\r\nAs everyone is aware, conflicts in the world are\r\non the increase. They extend throughout continents and\r\nare growing in complexity. The responsibility of the\r\nCouncil and the demands on its competence have\r\ntherefore been constantly expanding. Given the need\r\nfor the Council to be able to function effectively and\r\nefficiently under such fluid circumstances, it is\r\ninconceivable that its work could be carried out\r\nsuccessfully without changing the current composition\r\nof the membership and increasing the number of\r\nseats — for both permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers alike.\r\nIn this context, reform of the Security Council is\r\nessential in order to enhance the legitimacy not only of\r\nthe Council in particular, but of the Organization in\r\ngeneral. As many earlier speakers have said — and the\r\nRoyal Government of Cambodia would like to reiterate\r\nthis — in order for the Council to maintain its\r\nrelevance and credibility, it certainly needs to evolve to\r\ncomplement ever-changing global realities. The\r\nSecurity Council does not exist separately from the rest\r\nof the world, but is a part of it. Our collective efforts\r\nshould be focused to ensure that that subsidiary organ\r\nis representative of the membership, not only in terms\r\nof physical numbers, but also in providing equal\r\nground for all Member States to voice their concerns\r\nand aspirations concerning matters related to world\r\npeace and security.\r\nThe more balanced and comprehensive\r\nrepresentation of all continents would lead to a better\r\nsense of ownership of the Security Council on the part\r\nof all States. This means that the permanent members\r\nof the Council must represent all of the major regions.\r\nThis could be achieved by increasing the number of\r\nmembers of the Council, in both the permanent and\r\nnon-permanent categories.\r\nMy delegation is of the view that the most\r\nimportant criterion for States seeking permanent\r\nmembership in the Council is the capacity to make a\r\nmeaningful and sustainable contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and to\r\nthe realization of the purposes of the Organization.\r\nSuch States should be provided with the opportunity to\r\nbecome more involved in the work of the Security\r\nCouncil. In this context, we particularly support the\r\ncandidacy of Japan, together with that of India and\r\nGermany, for permanent membership in the Council.\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nCountries such as Japan, India and Germany\r\ncontinue to play an active role in the United Nations.\r\nFor example, Japan, with a rate of assessment close to\r\n20 per cent, bears a significant part of the United\r\nNations budget, including the peacekeeping budget and\r\nthe budgets of the two international criminal tribunals.\r\nIndia has one of the largest populations in the world\r\nand has the ability and the capacity to discharge the\r\ncritical task of participating in the structuring of a just\r\nand dynamic world order. On many occasions the input\r\nof such countries could be essential. Yet they are often\r\noverlooked by the major players in the Council,\r\nillustrating the fact that the Security Council remains a\r\nplaying field for only a select few. From time to time,\r\nthere has been a great deal of talk and discussion on\r\nthe need to enlarge the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and to strengthen that body to be more\r\ndemocratic and more efficient and to play a more\r\nimportant role in international politics.\r\nIt is now, therefore, the right time to propose an\r\ninitiative to set up a mechanism of consultation among\r\nMember States to devise modalities, criteria and\r\nguidelines with regard to the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, including its size, in the form of an\r\nappropriate rule applicable and acceptable to all\r\nMember States vis-à-vis the question of geographical\r\nrepresentation. To that end, the interested Member\r\nStates will have equal status to be represented as they\r\nwish.\r\nMr. Vassilakis (Greece): At the outset, let me\r\ncongratulate the past Chairman and the members of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council for their excellent and\r\ninnovative work during the fifty-eighth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I also wish to thank all the\r\nmembers of the United Nations Secretariat who have\r\nhelped in putting together the various reports.\r\nToday, we have before us the annual report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly (A/59/2).\r\nIndeed it is an informative report. It allows us to look\r\nat the work of the Council and concentrate on the\r\npoints where we feel improvements and adjustments\r\nare needed.\r\nIn the last few years, we were all pleased to see\r\nimprovements in the working methods of the\r\nCouncil — its readiness to be more open, to cooperate\r\nmore closely, both with the other organs of the United\r\nNations system and with regional partners, and to\r\nimprove the process of consultations with the wider\r\nUnited Nations membership.\r\nThat has translated, among other things, into\r\nmore open meetings and briefings, allowing for\r\nimportant exchanges of information between the\r\nCouncil members and the wider United Nations\r\nmembership and promptly conveying their respective\r\nviews to each other, as well as more substantial\r\ninteraction with the various regional organizations.\r\nWe favour and hope for the continuation of the\r\nefforts towards more transparency, accessibility and the\r\ninvolvement of all non-Council members in the daily\r\nwork of the Council. That is of crucial importance if\r\nthe Security Council aspires to reflect the views,\r\ntendencies, hopes and goals of the world community.\r\nLast year the Secretary-General announced the\r\ncreation of a High-level Panel of eminent persons to\r\nassess new threats and challenges facing our world\r\ntoday and to suggest ways to effectively deal with\r\nthem, including through reform of the multilateral\r\ninternational system. We fully support those efforts and\r\nlook forward to the forthcoming relevant report.\r\nReform of the Security Council remains a key\r\nissue. The Council is becoming more active, with an\r\nexpanding role and decisions of far-reaching\r\nconsequences. The restructuring of its membership and\r\nthe increase in its effectiveness thus become a vital\r\npart of the process of revitalizing the United Nations\r\nsystem, which aims at strengthening the Organization’s\r\nability to meet the challenges lying ahead.\r\nExpansion of the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil is an issue extensively discussed and widely\r\nsupported, although no consensus has so far emerged\r\non how and when that will be done. Greece believes\r\nthat the Council will be strengthened by an increase in\r\nboth its permanent and non-permanent membership.\r\nThat will reflect the new international environment and\r\ntruly represent the views and aspirations of the present\r\nday international community in charting the Council’s\r\nactions and strategic directions. The expansion will add\r\nto the Council’s legitimacy and ultimately to its\r\naccountability.\r\nAn enlarged Security Council, in both its\r\npermanent and non-permanent membership, should\r\nguarantee equitable geographical representation and an\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nenhanced voice for the developing world. There can be\r\nno security without development, and vice versa. This\r\nwill enable the Council to discharge its responsibilities\r\nmore effectively. At the same time, the Council will be\r\nable to respond to the threats and challenges of the\r\nmodern world in a more comprehensive manner.\r\nMr. Drobnjak (Croatia): I will try to be brief in\r\nmy statement and go straight to the point. Croatia\r\nwelcomes the annual report of the Security Council to\r\nthe General Assembly as an informative and\r\ncomprehensive document. Through its actions, the\r\nCouncil is further strengthening its relevance, not only\r\nin the field of international peace and security, but in\r\nthe legislative area as well. The latter is becoming a\r\nmatter of increased interest that goes beyond the\r\nCouncil’s membership and should be comprehensively\r\ndebated. Against this background, the initiative of\r\nAustria to convene a panel on the issue of the Security\r\nCouncil as world legislator is particularly welcome.\r\nThe Council’s enhanced role requires more\r\ntransparent relations between the Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly and calls for a wide-ranging debate\r\namong the United Nations membership about the\r\nreform of the Council and its strategic position in the\r\nyears to come.\r\nWhen it comes to the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, I have the honour to present the Assembly\r\nwith three main points concerning the position of\r\nCroatia.\r\nCroatia is of the opinion that without\r\ncomprehensive reform the United Nations will not be\r\nable to successfully meet all the challenges presented\r\nto us by the new century. Security Council reform is an\r\nindispensable step in that direction. Croatia fully\r\nsupports enlargement of the Security Council in both\r\ncategories. A formula for enlarging the Council to 24\r\nseats seems to be the most appropriate one, considering\r\nthe size of the United Nations membership and the\r\nneed for an efficient Council. Croatia strongly\r\nadvocates an additional seat in the enlarged Council for\r\nthe countries belonging to the Eastern European Group.\r\nMindful of the different positions among the\r\nMember States in regard to the scope and substance of\r\nSecurity Council reform, Croatia stands ready to\r\nembrace a pragmatic approach to the matter. We\r\nremain open to other proposals concerning the\r\nCouncil’s enlargement, provided they enjoy support\r\namong Member States and respect the interests of the\r\nEastern European Group.\r\nCroatia consistently supports improvement in the\r\nwork of the Security Council with a view to enhancing\r\nits transparency and securing adequate regional\r\nrepresentation. We are fully aware of the legitimate\r\ninterests of the largest countries among us. At the same\r\ntime, we have to emphasize the need to take into\r\naccount the positions of smaller countries as well,\r\nespecially those which have never had the privilege of\r\nserving on the Council. In the future allocation of the\r\nCouncil’s non-permanent seats, they should be given\r\nthe priority.\r\nMr. Butagira (Uganda): It has become an annual\r\nritual. The question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council has\r\nbeen on the General Assembly’s agenda at least since\r\nthe Assembly established, through resolution 48/26, an\r\nOpen-ended Working Group to address the issue. The\r\nGroup has been working with no breakthroughs except\r\non matters that are not at the core of the reforms. These\r\ninclude progress towards improving the methods of\r\nwork of the Security Council, for which I thank the\r\nWorking Group. The only achievement so far has been\r\nthat the General Assembly has remained seized of the\r\nmatter. Now is the time to act, and it is the hope of\r\ndelegation of Uganda that the fifty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly will be different and will present\r\nfirm recommendations on the size and membership of\r\nthe Council, both in terms of permanent and non-\r\npermanent members, in order to reflect the geopolitical\r\nand other realities of the world today.\r\nThe arguments for equitable representation on\r\nand increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil, including on criteria for membership, such as\r\nequitable geographical representation, are well known,\r\nhave been adequately elaborated over many years and,\r\ntherefore, need not be repeated here. What is needed\r\nnow is the political will to effect the necessary\r\nchanges, especially on the part of the permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council.\r\n The victors of the Second World War created a\r\nprivileged club of their own composed of five\r\npermanent members, each wielding a veto. To create\r\nanother class of privileged members, this time based on\r\nthose who wield economic might, is not an entirely\r\ncomfortable concept, but sometimes in the world of\r\npolitical realties, logic does not carry the day. We\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\ntherefore have to be practical and pragmatic. The ideal\r\nwould have been equal entitlement of all Member\r\nStates to Security Council seats, permanent or non-\r\npermanent, in order for the Security Council to have\r\nenhanced legitimacy and credibility.\r\nThat said, my delegation would go along with the\r\nsuggestion to create a category of permanent members\r\nwithout a veto and to increase the number of non-\r\npermanent members. For the former category, Africa\r\nshould be entitled to at least two seats, and other\r\ndeveloping countries should also be represented. The\r\ncriteria for this should be worked out either by region\r\nor globally. We would prefer regional representation.\r\nWith regard to the veto — and, once again, for\r\npragmatic reasons — the status quo should be\r\nmaintained. We can begin next year with the expansion\r\nof the non-permanent membership and the creation of a\r\nnew category of permanent members without a veto. In\r\nthe meantime, we should think of developing\r\nguidelines on how the veto can be wisely exercised in\r\nthe interests of world peace and security. The final\r\nstage in the reform process would be a consideration of\r\nthe abolishment of the veto at the appropriate time.\r\nLet me briefly touch on other matters. Very often\r\nin the Security Council, reports critical of Member\r\nStates have been discussed and resolutions adopted\r\nwithout affording the States concerned an opportunity\r\nto be heard, in the case of States that are not members\r\nof the Security Council. The right to be heard is a\r\ncardinal rule of natural justice. It is, therefore, only fair\r\nto afford such a Member the opportunity to be heard\r\nbefore a resolution is adopted. The present rule that\r\nallows a Member to participate silently in the\r\ndeliberations of Security Council without the right to\r\nspeak should be done away with. Once a Member is\r\ngranted the right to participate, its representative\r\nshould automatically be allowed to speak.\r\nThe Security Council has progressively invited\r\nmore non-members to participate in debates on\r\nthematic topics. That is a welcome move. These\r\ndebates enrich the outcome of the Security Council’s\r\ndeliberations. Their scope and frequency should be\r\nincreased. The list of speakers should be arranged\r\nalphabetically by country name rather than, as is the\r\npresent practice, Council members all speaking first. In\r\nthat way, the debates would be interactive. There\r\nshould also be more open meetings of the Security\r\nCouncil. In other words, the Council should present a\r\nmore human face and should not be an unapproachable,\r\nmysterious and intimidating institution.\r\nLastly, there should be more dialogue among the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council and the\r\nSecretary-General. For instance, monthly consultations\r\nbetween the Presidents of the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly should be institutionalized. There is\r\nnothing in the Charter, for instance, to prevent joint\r\nmeetings of the Security Council and General\r\nAssembly to discuss a particular topic.\r\nMr. Sealy (Trinidad and Tobago): The delegation\r\nof the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, in addressing\r\nthis agenda item, would first of all, Mr. President, wish\r\nto pay a special tribute to the efforts of your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, President of the fifty-\r\neighth session of the Assembly, who, by assuming the\r\nchairmanship of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters Related to the Security Council, sought to give\r\nincreased political emphasis and direction to its work.\r\nThe report of the Open-ended Working Group\r\ncontained in document A/58/47 reflects in a very\r\nsubstantive way the extent of the exchanges of views\r\namong delegations on the following six points that\r\nwere systematically addressed: size of an enlarged\r\nSecurity Council; question of regional representation;\r\ncriteria for membership; relationship between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council;\r\naccountability; and the use of the veto. Those\r\nexchanges of views revealed, however, the complex\r\nnature of the subject matter under discussion and the\r\nwide divergence of opinion that continues to exist\r\namong United Nations Member States on almost every\r\naspect of these topics.\r\nThe views expressed by Member States on these\r\npoints are clearly set out in the report. The task of the\r\ninternational community at this stage is to ensure\r\nfurther progress towards concluding the discussions on\r\nthese key issues, taking into account all the competing\r\nand contending ideas, in order to implement the\r\ndecision of our heads of State or Government reflected\r\nin the Millennium Declaration, in which they resolved,\r\ninter alia, to intensify their efforts to achieve a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council in all its\r\naspects.\r\nAs we go forward with the implementation of this\r\nmandate, we will also have to bear in mind that the\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.26\r\nSecretary-General, in his September 2003 statement to\r\nthe General Assembly at its 3rd plenary meeting, drew\r\nattention to the urgent need for the Security Council to\r\nregain the confidence of States and of world public\r\nopinion by demonstrating its ability to deal effectively\r\nwith the most difficult issues and by becoming more\r\nbroadly representative of the international community\r\nas a whole, as well as of the geopolitical realities of\r\ntoday. To that end, as we all are aware, he established\r\nhis High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\r\nChange, which is also likely to address the question of\r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nWe therefore need to manage these two processes\r\nin a manner that will allow the United Nations, as its\r\nmoves towards the observance of the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of its founding, to benefit not only from\r\nthe collective wisdom of the Secretary-General’s High-\r\nlevel Panel but also from the well-thought-out\r\npositions of Member States on all aspects of this issue\r\nthat have been advanced over the past 10 years.\r\nWhat the international community must,\r\ntherefore, seek to achieve in any reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, in the opinion of the delegation of Trinidad\r\nand Tobago, is the multilateralization of the\r\ninternational security policies of States and the\r\navoidance of the marginalization of the Security\r\nCouncil in matters relating to threats to international\r\npeace and security.\r\nIn undertaking this comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, the international community would\r\nneed to address, basically, the composition of the\r\nCouncil, its decision-making process and its working\r\nmethods. While some progress has been made with\r\nrespect to the latter, the other two areas still present\r\ndifficult choices.\r\nAny Security Council reform must, therefore,\r\nresult in a change in the Council’s composition not\r\nonly so as to reflect more adequately the current\r\ngeopolitical realities at the global level, but also in\r\norder that it may become more representative of the\r\nvast majority of the States Members of the United\r\nNations. Such a change in its composition would, in\r\nour opinion, strengthen the Security Council’s own\r\nlegitimacy and effectiveness, while not affecting in any\r\nway its efficiency.\r\nOn the related issue of decision-making in the\r\nSecurity Council, it would be recalled that the last\r\nvestiges of the unanimity rule, which had been the\r\ngeneral rule for decision-making in the League of\r\nNations, are today to be found in Article 27,\r\nparagraph 3, of the Charter, which requires the\r\naffirmative votes of nine members, including those of\r\nthe five permanent members, for a decision of the\r\nCouncil on matters other than those of a procedural\r\nnature.\r\nThe report of the Open-ended Working Group\r\nlists in annex III the draft resolutions of the Council\r\nthat were not adopted owing to the negative vote of a\r\npermanent member of the Council during the period\r\n16 February 1946 to 21 April 2004. What is clear from\r\nthe listing provided by the Secretariat is that all five\r\npermanent members have, at one time or another,\r\nexercised the right of veto, some more often than\r\nothers and at particular times during that period. Any\r\nreform of the veto power will require, in the first\r\ninstance, an honest analysis by the five permanent\r\nmembers of the use to which the veto power has been\r\nput and whether such use has contributed to or\r\nendangered further the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. Without agreement among the\r\npermanent members on the judicious use of the veto,\r\nthere is little prospect for any meaningful change on\r\nthis aspect of the reform of decision-making in the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nSubstantial and meaningful reform of the Security\r\nCouncil would require an amendment to the Charter\r\nand must, therefore, be the result of a broad consensus\r\nnot only among the membership of the United Nations\r\nas a whole but also, and more particularly, among the\r\npermanent members of the Security Council. The\r\ndelegation of Trinidad and Tobago would therefore\r\nurge the Chairman of the Open-ended Working Group\r\nto continue to build upon the progress already made. In\r\nthat regard, we should strive at the fifty-ninth session\r\nto make specific proposals that can be the subject of\r\nfurther intense informal consultations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
