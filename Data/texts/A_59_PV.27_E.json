(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 113 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/59/430)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Before\r\nproceeding to the items for this meeting, I should like\r\nto invite the attention of the General Assembly to\r\ndocument A/59/430. It contains the text of a letter from\r\nthe Secretary-General addressed to the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly informing the Assembly that 13\r\nMember States are in arrears in the payment of their\r\nfinancial contributions to the United Nations under the\r\nterms of Article 19 of the Charter.\r\nI should like to remind delegations that, under\r\nArticle 19 of the Charter,\r\nA Member of the United Nations which is\r\nin arrears in the payment of its financial\r\ncontributions to the Organization shall have no\r\nvote in the General Assembly if the amount of its\r\narrears equals or exceeds the amount of the\r\ncontributions due from it for the preceding two\r\nfull years.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly\r\ntakes note of the information contained in document\r\nA/59/430?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda items 11 and 53 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/59/2)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters\r\nMr. Olhaye (Djibouti): We welcome the\r\nopportunity to participate in the joint debate relating to\r\nthe report of the Security Council (A/59/2) and to the\r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters.\r\nAt the outset, we would like to express our thanks\r\nto the Security Council and to the Secretariat for their\r\ncommendable efforts in preparing this years report,\r\nwhich, as in previous years, conveys the intensity and\r\nvariety of the issues considered and of the decisions\r\ntaken. Over the years, the Council has been increasing\r\nthe transparency of its work, and it needs to be\r\nencouraged to do more in that regard. However, the\r\nwider membership still finds the consultation process\r\nto be quite sketchy.\r\nThe gravity of the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council seems only to increase with each\r\npassing day. The pace at which significant\r\ndevelopments occur around the globe today is often\r\nunnerving, particularly when compared with the snails\r\npace of the evolution of international governance\r\nmechanisms. Of course, conflicts between States\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nremain a prime danger, given the potential numbers of\r\npeople and resources that could be involved and the\r\nfallout of such conflicts on other States.\r\nEqually if not more important today is the threat\r\nof terrorism, which, without established bases or\r\nlocations and without uniformed soldiers or weapons\r\nof mass destruction, is difficult to address effectively\r\nwhile maintaining basic democratic rights and\r\nprotection for the general population.\r\nFor many reasons, there has been a tendency of\r\nlate to identify peoples along tribal, ethnic, racial or\r\nreligious lines. Add to that the competition for natural\r\nresources, such as land, minerals and water, and the\r\npotential for conflict rises dramatically. That has been\r\nthe story in Africa  as well as in other areas of the\r\nworld  for much of the past few decades, and it has\r\nled to the increasing need for peacekeeping forces, in\r\nterms of both manpower and other resources, from\r\noutside the areas of conflict. The pressures imposed by\r\nthe international flow of small arms and anti-personnel\r\nlandmines  which has placed such weapons in the\r\nhands of often ruthless groups, thugs and even\r\nleaders  have complicated the issue even further.\r\nAgainst that background, the Secretary-General\r\nrightly noted in an interview last year that there has\r\nbeen a tendency to focus on hard threats and to neglect\r\nsoft threats  such as poverty, the HIV/AIDS\r\nepidemic, environmental degradation, inequality and\r\nthe desperation in which some people live  which\r\ncan be equally destructive.\r\nIf the world is to act collectively against those\r\ndangers, perhaps the only existing mechanism\r\navailable to nations and able to confer legitimacy is the\r\nUnited Nations. Where action must be taken in a\r\nconflict situation, that usually means action through the\r\nSecurity Council. But as currently constituted, the\r\nCouncil is not a representative body; rather, it\r\ncontinues to be a legacy of the Second World War.\r\nSince its inception, there has been little or no change in\r\nits structure or power base, particularly on such issues\r\nas permanent membership or veto power.\r\nObviously, there is an urgent need for an\r\ninclusive Council that takes seriously into\r\nconsideration the interests of both developed and\r\ndeveloping States and of the worlds power and\r\npopulation centres. The Councils powers, membership\r\nand composition must better reflect the demographic,\r\neconomic and political realities of todays world if the\r\nCouncil is to slow the erosion of legitimacy it is\r\nsuffering from because of its exclusion of vast numbers\r\nof peoples, States and economic classes.\r\nGiven the mounting pressure on the international\r\nsystem, from so many directions and against the\r\nbackground of events of the past few years, reform of\r\nthe Council and perhaps of the United Nations system\r\nitself are undoubtedly part of a larger issue that calls\r\nfor a rethinking of the international institutions. In the\r\nwords of the Secretary-General, Many of us sense that\r\nwe are living through a crisis of the international\r\nsystem (Press release SG/SM/8803, 30 July 2003).\r\nWith particular reference to the crisis in Iraq, he said\r\nalso that that war and ongoing crises in Africa\r\nforce us to ask ourselves whether the institutions\r\nand methods we are accustomed to are really\r\nadequate to deal with all the stresses of the last\r\ncouple of years.\r\nCertainly, few would question the need for reform\r\nof the multilateral system. And many would stress the\r\ndire necessity of reform of the Security Council,\r\nwhether of its composition, or its capacity to anticipate\r\nas well as to respond to crisis, or its ability to follow\r\nthrough with respect to the maintenance of peace.\r\nSecurity Council reform is currently stalemated,\r\nand as the President of the Assembly at its fifty-\r\nseventh session stated at the 94th meeting of that\r\nsession, the stalemate is likely to be broken only if\r\nthere is a major political breakthrough in the capitals of\r\nsome key Member States. However, he also conceded\r\nthat the Working Group on Security Council reform\r\nhad succeeded in taking a few small steps. Responses\r\nto the questionnaire he distributed last year to members\r\nconfirmed almost universal frustration over the\r\ninability of the Working Group to produce the desired\r\noutcomes. We are, therefore, pleased at the Secretary-\r\nGenerals establishment of the High-level Panel to\r\nassess the role of the United Nations in dealing with\r\nnew global threats, challenges and change. Some of its\r\ninitial soundings are encouraging. We look forward to\r\nits report to the Secretary-General in December, and to\r\nhis own observations by the next session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nOur goal remains that of a safe world where\r\nconflict is thwarted through mechanisms of preventive\r\ndiplomacy. Many regions in the world, beset by\r\nconflict, suffer from neglect and inattention; some of\r\nthe wars last longer, thus creating a generation of\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\narmed, uneducated and hopeless youth. The result has\r\nbeen the failure of States, a cycle of poverty,\r\ninstability, social disintegration and the collapse of\r\ngovernance. Such dysfunctional States also pose other\r\nthreats as potential breeding grounds for terrorism and\r\nother kinds of crime. Obviously, the Council needs to\r\nhave greater sensitivity towards poor countries\r\nembroiled in brutal conflicts, which require urgent\r\nattention concerning peacemaking and peacekeeping.\r\nClosely related to this is post-conflict peace-building,\r\nwhich in the view of some experts remains fragile and\r\nhas yielded mixed results. That should not be the case,\r\ngiven that peace-building, in the view of professional\r\nanalysts, is an international necessity and responsibility\r\nand represents a collective commitment by the United\r\nNations and other international actors to deal with the\r\nsources of violent conflict in conflict-torn societies\r\nwhile preparing the ground for sustained peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nUnfortunately, according to relevant studies, the\r\nresults of the last 10 years of peace-building practices\r\nand policies are, at best, ad hoc, tentative and uneven.\r\nThat is not encouraging and represents a real challenge\r\nto the efforts towards the reform of the Council,\r\nespecially in the post-9/11 environment. Much is\r\nexpected in that regard from the High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change, in terms of\r\nunderscoring the need for the United Nations to renew\r\nits commitment to conflict prevention and post-conflict\r\npeace-building.\r\nFinally, my country is very pleased with the\r\nevolution of transitional governance in Somalia. The\r\nelection of a President two days ago represents the\r\nclearest manifestation yet of the Somali peoples desire\r\nto restore peace and stability to their shattered\r\nhomeland. The Republic of Djibouti extends its\r\nunflinching pledge to the new Government of Somalia\r\nthat it will spare no efforts to help its brothers and\r\nsisters in their earnest quest for nation-building.\r\nEqually, I am confident that the United Nations,\r\nand the Security Council in particular, will direct full\r\nand undivided attention to Somalia as it once again\r\ntakes its place among the nations of the world.\r\nMr. Kittikhoun (Lao Peoples Democratic\r\nRepublic): It has been 11 years since the Working\r\nGroup on Security Council Reform was created. That is\r\na very long time  too long, I would say. Many of us\r\nare becoming a little frustrated, impatient and weary.\r\nHowever, in the light of existing and recently emerging\r\nthreats to international peace and security, the\r\nsignificant role of the Security Council and the need to\r\nreform it in order to reflect todays global realities have\r\nnever been more relevant. Hence, we must do\r\neverything we can to find an acceptable solution to the\r\ncrucial question of reform.\r\nThe primary aim of this exercise is to make the\r\nSecurity Council more effective by making it more\r\nrepresentative, transparent and democratic. In that\r\nendeavour, most Member States have focused on the\r\nissues of expansion of the membership of the Council\r\nand improving its working methods and decision-\r\nmaking process.\r\nAlong with the majority of other United Nations\r\nMember States, the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic\r\nis in favour of an increase in the number of both\r\npermanent and non-permanent members, with the new\r\nmembers coming from the developed and developing\r\ncountries in accordance with the principle of equitable\r\ngeographical distribution and taking into account the\r\nrelative importance of the various countries. In that\r\ncontext, the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic\r\nreaffirms its support for Japan, Germany and India\r\nbecoming permanent members of a newly expanded\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nFurthermore, we would like to stress that reform\r\nshould also include measures that would render the\r\nSecurity Council more transparent in its working\r\nmethods and, especially, in its decision-making\r\nprocess. We believe this transparency would not only\r\nboost the confidence of Member States but would also\r\nallow all of us to better understand the merits of the\r\nCouncils decisions and to fully support them.\r\nIn this exercise, another important issue to be\r\naddressed is the veto power. Throughout the years, the\r\nworld has witnessed an increasing abuse of the veto.\r\nThe veto power is obviously antidemocratic and\r\ndiscriminatory. However, taking into account the\r\nsensitivity and complex nature of the issue, we hope\r\nthat Member States will work out a solution acceptable\r\nto all.\r\nTodays world is undergoing complex and rapidly\r\nchanging evolution. Since 1945, great changes have\r\noccurred. The Security Council, the main body\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, should adapt to these new changes and\r\nrealities.\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nThe Lao Peoples Democratic Republic believes\r\nthat, with our tireless efforts and in a spirit of\r\ncompromise, we should work together to reform the\r\nSecurity Council in order to make this body more\r\neffective and legitimate.\r\nMr. Rastam (Malaysia): My delegation is\r\npleased to participate in this debate on agenda items 11\r\nand 53.\r\nI wish to express my sincere appreciation to the\r\nPresident of the Security Council for the month of\r\nOctober, Ambassador Sir Emyr Jones Parry of the\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,\r\nfor his presentation yesterday of the annual report of\r\nthe Security Council to the General Assembly. My\r\ndelegation has taken note of the Councils report, as\r\ncontained in document A/59/2.\r\nConsideration of the annual report of the Security\r\nCouncil by the General Assembly provides a good\r\nopportunity for the larger membership of the\r\nOrganization to assess the work and performance of the\r\nCouncil during the period under review. This would be\r\nin keeping with Articles 15 and 24 of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMalaysia appreciates the serious efforts initiated\r\nby Mr. Julian Hunte, President of the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, to institute greater\r\nand regular interaction between the General Assembly\r\nand the Council. We especially welcomed the adoption\r\nof Assembly resolution 58/126 of 13 January 2004.\r\nPart A of the annex to that resolution contains, inter\r\nalia, references to the relationship between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council in the context of\r\nrevitalizing the work of the Assembly. It should also be\r\nseen in the context of promoting transparency in the\r\nwork of the Council.\r\nMy delegation recalls that an open meeting of the\r\nCouncil for the purpose of discussing its report before\r\nsubmission to the Assembly was convened prior to the\r\nAssemblys fifty-seventh session. That promoted\r\ngreater transparency and accountability in the work of\r\nthe Council. We regret that the Council has done away\r\nwith this practice. We also regret the late issuance of\r\ndocument A/59/2.\r\nThe report of the Security Council has shown a\r\nsignificant improvement in the Councils method of\r\nwork. However, it continues to lack a substantive and\r\nanalytical account of the work of the Council. The\r\nincorporation of more details and analyses beyond a\r\nfactual account of the Councils work would certainly\r\nhelp the wider membership of the United Nations to\r\nappreciate the circumstances that had influenced the\r\ndecisions of the Council on a particular issue. That\r\nwould enable a greater appreciation of the\r\nachievements made or difficulties faced by the Council\r\non all questions under its consideration, and it could\r\nallow non-Council members to offer suggestions to the\r\nCouncil on possible measures to further improve the\r\nwork of the Council.\r\nMy delegation notes that the Council addressed a\r\nwide range of issues during the period under review. A\r\ntotal of 213 meetings were held and 60 resolutions\r\nadopted. Conflicts and instability in Africa continue to\r\ndominate the work of the Council. Malaysia is pleased\r\nthat the situation in Liberia has considerably improved,\r\nand Guinea-Bissau has successfully completed the first\r\nphase of its transitional political process. The Security\r\nCouncil mission that visited some countries in the\r\nAfrican continent in June this year made some\r\nimportant recommendations towards establishing\r\npolitical stability in the subregions, and those\r\nrecommendations should be supported. Malaysia looks\r\nforward to the Council taking more effective decisions\r\non conflict situations, particularly in Africa.\r\nWe agree that the holding of thematic discussions\r\nis useful to improve the effectiveness of the Council.\r\nWe note that 12 meetings for thematic discussions, as\r\nwell as 73 open debates and briefings, were convened.\r\nMalaysia considers thematic discussions and open\r\ndebates as avenues for allowing Council members and\r\nthe wider membership of the United Nations to offer\r\nviews and suggestions on issues directly related to the\r\nwork of the Council. However, it is not clear whether\r\nthese have actually been fully considered by the\r\nCouncil when arriving at decisions.\r\nGiven the increasing workload of the Council, we\r\nbelieve that thematic discussions should be kept to the\r\nminimum and held specifically with a view to\r\nachieving concrete results that would have an impact\r\non the performance, not only of the Council, but also\r\nof the United Nations at large. We continue to believe\r\nthat thematic discussions and other important issues\r\naddressed by the Council from time to time would\r\nmerit the submission of special reports to the General\r\nAssembly, as provided for under Articles 15 and 24 of\r\nthe Charter and in keeping with the intent of Assembly\r\nresolution 58/126.\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nMy delegation fully appreciates the practice\r\nincreasingly adopted in the Security Council to urge\r\nspeakers to be brief in their statements. We understand\r\nthe need to respect precious time. However, we feel\r\nthat this should be done in a manner that also respects\r\nthe principles embodied in the Charter, as well as the\r\nCouncils own provisional rules of procedure. At the\r\nsame time, I would urge the Council to respect the\r\nwishes of Member States to express their views\r\npublicly in the Council, particularly on issues of wider\r\nconcern to all, such as on international terrorism and\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nIn this connection, any decision by the Council to\r\nrestrict participation in its open meetings, such as in\r\nthe case of 8 October 2004, will not be helpful in\r\nmaintaining the spirit of cooperation between the\r\nCouncil and the larger body of United Nations\r\nmembership. On these very important questions related\r\nto international peace and security, everyone is a\r\nstakeholder. This is especially so in the case of the\r\nCouncils work concerning the fight against\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nMy delegation notes that the Council has\r\nincreased the invocation of Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nSince 1 August 2003, 28 of its resolutions contain this\r\nprovision. We strongly believe that Chapter VII must\r\nbe invoked responsibly after careful consideration of a\r\ngiven question. The Council must not apply double\r\nstandards. For instance, why has the Council not\r\ninvoked Chapter VII concerning the question of\r\nPalestine, despite the apparent threats to the peace,\r\nbreaches of the peace, or acts of aggression committed\r\nby Israel? Chapter VII should not be invoked to\r\nadvance narrow political objectives or to satisfy certain\r\nnational interests. It is the collective interest of the\r\nwider membership in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security that should be a major\r\nconsideration.\r\nMalaysia is concerned with recent trends in the\r\nSecurity Council to prescribe legislation to Member\r\nStates through its resolutions that also invoke Chapter\r\nVII. Council resolutions 1540 (2004) and 1566 (2004)\r\nare cases in point. Malaysia registered the concerns of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) concerning\r\nresolution 1540 (2004) in the Councils 4950th\r\nmeeting, a public meeting held on 22 April 2004. We\r\nhave insisted that the substance of resolutions such as\r\nthose mentioned should serve as a basis for\r\nconsideration by Member States when formulating, in\r\ndue course, a comprehensive multilaterally negotiated\r\nlegal instrument to address the specific question at\r\nhand. Malaysia would urge the Council to be more\r\ncircumspect in its attitude towards prescribing\r\nlegislative measures and invoking Chapter VII on\r\nbehalf of the Member States of the United Nations.\r\nMalaysia applauds the Councils continued\r\ninterest on the Palestinian question demonstrated in its\r\nmonthly briefings and open debates. A total of 20\r\nmeetings and 33 informal consultations were convened\r\non that question. That notwithstanding, only one\r\nresolution was adopted by the Council, namely,\r\nresolution 1544 (2004) of 19 May 2004, pertaining to\r\nthe demolition by Israel of Palestinian homes in the\r\nRafah refugee camp.\r\nThe Security Council must improve and maintain\r\nits credibility by enforcing its authority on the\r\nPalestinian question, in particular in respect of the\r\ncommitment to the road map and to the two-State\r\nsolution, the end of occupation of Palestinian and other\r\nArab territories, the termination of Israels settler\r\ncolonialism activities and the reversal of the\r\nconstruction of the separation wall. The Council must\r\nnot allow its resolutions to be manipulated or allow\r\nitself to be prevented from doing anything meaningful.\r\nThe Council must take resolute action concerning the\r\nconstruction of the Israeli expansionist separation wall,\r\nwhich was declared illegal in an advisory opinion\r\nissued by the International Court of Justice. Malaysia\r\nhopes that that will be done soon on the basis of the\r\ninitiative presently before the Council.\r\nThe question of Iraq naturally has continued to\r\ndominate the attention of the Security Council. Iraq is\r\nstill in turmoil despite all efforts to improve the\r\nsituation on the ground. Although Council resolution\r\n1546 (2004) of 8 June 2004 returned sovereignty to the\r\npeople of Iraq, peace, security and stability remain\r\nmajor concerns. Malaysia reiterates its call for the\r\nUnited Nations to play a leading role, particularly in\r\nestablishing appropriate conditions in preparation for\r\nthe elections scheduled for January 2005. The orderly\r\nconduct of elections is critical to the process of re-\r\nestablishing a truly independent and sovereign\r\nGovernment in Iraq. Malaysia reaffirms its conviction\r\nthat the United Nations has the best credentials and can\r\nprovide the best platform to enable Member States to\r\nparticipate in post-conflict peace-building and\r\nreconstruction efforts in Iraq. We look to the Security\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nCouncil to find creative ways of achieving those\r\nobjectives.\r\nThe cooperation provided by Member States in\r\nthe work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee is an\r\nexcellent illustration of effective multilateralism.\r\nMember States have displayed their full commitment in\r\nimplementing and responding to Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001). Certainly this can also be anticipated with\r\nrespect to resolution 1566 (2004). Malaysia is\r\nconvinced that the political will displayed by Member\r\nStates in combating international terrorism will be\r\nfortified and gain greater momentum.\r\nSadly, such cooperation is not replicated in the\r\nimplementation of many other Council resolutions. As\r\nSecurity Council resolutions are legally binding, it is\r\nincumbent upon Member States to implement them\r\nwithout selectivity. The Council must play its role\r\nwithout discrimination to ensure that all Member States\r\nadhere to and implement its resolutions.\r\nWe wish to reaffirm our support for the adoption\r\nby the Security Council of clear and precise indicators\r\nto measure its work. One such indicator is the level of\r\ncompliance by Member States in implementing\r\nCouncil resolutions. That would help to underscore\r\nlegitimacy in the work of the United Nations and allow\r\nthe United Nations to regain credibility in the eyes of\r\nthe international community.\r\nOn the issue of sanctions, Malaysia in principle\r\ncontinues to oppose their imposition owing to the\r\ndebilitating impact of sanctions on the general\r\npopulation. Sanctions should be utilized as a measure\r\nof last resort and after careful consideration of their\r\nramifications. The sanctions should hit their intended\r\ntarget and not the innocent populace. Sanctions must\r\nbe devised with clear parameters, including specific\r\nand clearly identified targets, time frames and regular\r\nimpact assessments. Malaysia hopes that the Councils\r\nWorking Group on General Issues on Sanctions could\r\nexpedite its efforts to reach a decision on the\r\nrecommended duration and termination of sanctions. In\r\nthat connection, Malaysia welcomes the lifting of the\r\nCouncil-imposed sanctions against Iraq and the Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya during the period under review.\r\nTurning to agenda item 53, my delegation wishes\r\nto state that we agree with the prevailing view that the\r\nUnited Nations, including the Security Council, needs\r\nto be reformed in such a way as to enhance both its\r\neffectiveness and its credibility. It is essential that the\r\ncountries that play a major role in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security participate actively in\r\nthe decision-making process of the Security Council.\r\nAs the number of Member States, and with it the\r\nproportion of developing countries, has increased\r\ndramatically, the representation of the Security Council\r\nneeds to be enhanced. For that purpose, the Council\r\nmust be expanded in both the permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories. During the general debate of the\r\nfifty-ninth session, 149 countries referred to the need\r\nfor Security Council reform. Out of those, 86 countries\r\nsupported expansion in both categories of membership.\r\nI should like to recall the address delivered by the\r\nHonourable Dato Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi,\r\nPrime Minister of Malaysia, at the general debate of\r\nthe fifty-ninth session on 27 September 2004. He said\r\nthat the Security Council should be rendered more\r\ndemocratic and representative of the number and\r\ngeographical spread of its international membership.\r\nHe also said that the exercise of the veto by the\r\npermanent members of the Security Council should be\r\nregulated so as to prohibit that power being used\r\nunjustly, at the sole discretion of its holder, to overrule\r\nthe wishes of the majority. He believed that that\r\ninjustice could be rectified, for instance by making\r\ncertain types of General Assembly resolutions capable\r\nof setting aside a Security Council veto.\r\nWe look forward to receiving the report to be\r\nsubmitted early next year by the Secretary-General\r\npursuant to the recommendations of the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change, including,\r\nwe anticipate, recommendations concerning Security\r\nCouncil reform. Meanwhile, Malaysia looks to your\r\nleadership, Mr. President, to give impetus to the much-\r\nneeded forward movement of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on Security Council reform. Indeed,\r\ninternational peace and security cannot be fully\r\nmaintained without significant reform of the Council,\r\nin terms of its membership, methods of work,\r\ntransparency, democratization and the veto. We look\r\nforward to working closely with you, other Member\r\nStates of the United Nations and the Secretary-General\r\nto explore new ideas and produce a fresh outlook\r\ntowards reforming the Security Council. We already\r\npossess the necessary tools to advance the reform\r\nprocess. We believe that what is required now is the\r\nfull support and political will of Member States.\r\nMr. de Santa Clara Gomes (Portugal): For many\r\nyears, there has been widespread agreement on the\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nneed to adapt the United Nations and its main bodies to\r\nan international context that has evolved significantly\r\nsince the end of the Second World War. Today more\r\nthan ever, the international situation needs a working\r\nand effective international system, and the need to\r\nreform the United Nations has become more pressing.\r\nThe Secretary-General, by establishing the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change, has given\r\nnew momentum to our efforts. We look forward to the\r\nPanels recommendations.\r\nThe world needs a Security Council that is\r\nrepresentative, effective and transparent. The\r\ninternational community, on whose behalf the Council\r\nacts, must feel it is a part of the Councils\r\ndeliberations. In this respect, we welcome some recent\r\nimprovements in the working methods of the Council. I\r\nwould highlight the following points.\r\nFirst, there are increased debates on cooperation\r\nwith regional organizations. However, this dialogue\r\nneeds to be further structured and institutionalized, as\r\nregional organizations, such as the European Union or\r\nthe African Union, play an increasing role in crisis\r\nmanagement, adding important political, cultural,\r\nhuman and financial value to United Nations missions.\r\nSecondly, the quantity and quality of the troop-\r\ncontributing countries meetings with the Department\r\nof Peacekeeping Operations has improved, thus making\r\ntroop contributors privy to the workings of\r\npeacekeeping operations. There are also mechanisms in\r\nplace for consultations between troop-contributing\r\ncountries and the Security Council. However, these\r\nmechanisms should be genuinely implemented and\r\nbecome more substantive. Troop-contributing countries\r\nand other significant actors should be enabled to\r\nexpress their views and thereby contribute to the\r\ncreation and mandate of peacekeeping operations at an\r\nearly stage.\r\nThirdly, I would like to mention the so-called\r\ngroups of friends, in which member States of the\r\nCouncil, together with other interested States, organize\r\nthemselves around a certain issue. This informal\r\nformat allows for frank and open exchanges. So far this\r\npractice is limited, but it should continue and expand.\r\nAlthough decision-making will remain in the hands of\r\nthe Council, these groups can serve as useful contact\r\npoints between the Council and the membership.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations must not be\r\nrestricted to the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil. Its membership must also reflect todays\r\ninternational realities, which differ significantly from\r\nthe context in which the United Nations was created\r\nalmost 60 years ago. Portugal has already expressed its\r\nsupport for the presence of Brazil, Germany and Japan\r\non the Security Council. We believe that Africa must\r\nbe permanently represented at the Council and have\r\nexpressed support for a permanent seat in the Security\r\nCouncil for India.\r\nIt goes without saying that an enlargement of the\r\npermanent membership of the Security Council should\r\nbe accompanied by a revision of the voting procedures\r\nconcerning the veto, set out in Article 27 of the\r\nCharter. To maintain that power as it is would be\r\ndetrimental to the effectiveness and the perceived\r\nlegitimacy that we seek to increase through a wider\r\nrepresentation.\r\nUnited Nations reform must include more\r\neffective mechanisms and practices in conflict\r\nprevention, which is also a major responsibility of the\r\nSecurity Council. In this respect, allow me to recall\r\nthat Portugal has proposed the establishment of a peace\r\nand development commission aimed at addressing\r\nconflict prevention in a more effective and\r\ncomprehensive way, particularly with regard to\r\ncountries emerging from conflict and with weak\r\ninstitutions.\r\nThe proposal stems from the undisputed fact that,\r\nsince the sources of conflict are varied in nature, only\r\nby addressing both security challenges and\r\ndevelopment needs can countries embark on a\r\nsustainable path for peace and prosperity. In the long\r\nrun, apart from it being ethically correct, a policy of\r\nprevention is always the less costly option for the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe new commission we propose would seek\r\ncombined action on the security, political, economic\r\nand nation-building fields, promoting a coherent and\r\ncohesive sustained effort by the Security Council and\r\nthe Economic and Social Council, in conjunction with\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions and other major\r\ninterested parties. Bearing in mind that the Charter\r\ndefines the prevention of armed conflicts as one of the\r\nmain goals of the United Nations, we sincerely believe\r\nthat this proposal would significantly contribute to\r\nreinforcing the central and crucial role that the United\r\nNations must continue to play in international affairs.\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nMr. del Rosario Ceballos (Dominican Republic)\r\n(spoke in Spanish): First of all, on behalf of my\r\ndelegation, I would like to say that we are very grateful\r\nto the Security Council and the Secretariat for having\r\npublished this report.\r\nThe United Nations is the outcome of an historic\r\nconvergence of wills forged in the struggle against\r\nfascism. The United Nations, as a result of the part it\r\nplayed in maintaining world peace and equilibrium and\r\nin light of recent history, remains the ideal instrument\r\nfor the international community to prevent conflict or\r\nrestore the peace.\r\nIn his statement at the 17th meeting during the\r\ngeneral debate at this fifty-ninth session, the Secretary\r\nof State for Foreign Relations of the Dominican\r\nRepublic said:\r\nMultilateralism is one of the main pillars\r\nof the foreign policy of the Dominican Republic\r\n.... For that reason, we join those nations that call\r\nfor a thorough reform of the United Nations\r\nsystem, with a view to enhancing its\r\ndemocratization and making it a more effective\r\ninstrument for States Members.\r\nOne of the two main bodies of the United Nations\r\nis the Security Council. As Article 24 of the Charter\r\nsays, this small body acts on behalf of the entire\r\nmembership, but geographical representation within it\r\nis unequal. In recent years, a great deal has been said\r\nabout the need to introduce reforms in order to make\r\nthe Organization more effective. This aspiration should\r\nnot become a dead letter, because the responsibilities\r\nof the United Nations are growing considerably at a\r\ntime when unprecedented events and situations of our\r\ngeneration require a high degree of creativity.\r\nTo face this challenge, we need far more open\r\nparticipative mechanisms. That is why we  along\r\nwith many Member States  are very interested in\r\nhaving the Security Council expanded, in recognition\r\nof realities that did not exist when the Organization\r\nwas founded. Asia, Africa and Latin America should\r\nquite appropriately have two permanent members, and,\r\nat the same time, we should increase the number of\r\nnon-permanent members. Not only would this\r\ncontribute to making the most active body of the\r\nOrganization more democratic, it would also include\r\nwider segments of humanity in the making of decisions\r\nthat, when all is said and done, affect all of us.\r\nMr. Elisaia (Samoa): Allow me, first of all, to\r\nregister my delegations appreciation to the President\r\nof the Security Council and to the Secretariat for the\r\nwork that has gone into the preparation of this years\r\nreport (A/59/2). Samoa is grateful for the Councils\r\nreport, which provides a comprehensive summary of its\r\nactivities for the period ending 31 July 2004.\r\nWhile some previous speakers have lamented the\r\nabsence of an analytic assessment in the report of the\r\nCouncils achievements, including setbacks, challenges\r\nand threats confronting it, my delegation believes that\r\nthe real and significant value of the report is the\r\nopportunity it affords the United Nations membership\r\nto gain insight into the work and deliberations of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe workload of the Security Council is steadily\r\nincreasing. That, we feel, can be attributed in part to\r\nthe trend in the Council to deal with thematic topics\r\nthat more appropriately fall under the purview of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. There is therefore a pressing need\r\nto demarcate the division of responsibilities among the\r\nSecurity Council, the General Assembly and the other\r\norgans of the United Nations such as the Economic and\r\nSocial Council in order to eliminate conflicting\r\nmandates, duplication of efforts and waste of limited\r\nresources.\r\nOn the issue of the transparency of the work of\r\nthe Council, we welcome the fact that more open\r\nmeetings and briefings were held over the last year.\r\nWhile we commend them as useful means of engaging\r\nthe international community on issues that directly\r\naffect it, those consultations are not institutionalized\r\nand, at best, are held selectively and at random. We\r\ntherefore urge a more structured approach to allow\r\nMember States to contribute in an effective and\r\nmeaningful manner to the decision-making process,\r\nboth to encourage wider ownership of decisions taken\r\nand to facilitate their timely implementation.\r\nThe Councils primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security under\r\nthe Charter has not eroded with the passing of time. On\r\nthe contrary, it remains as valid, relevant and important\r\nas ever. It is therefore in the collective interest of the\r\nUnited Nations membership that the Security Council\r\nshould be effective, decisive, representative and\r\nrespected.\r\nSamoa continues to actively support the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council in both its\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\npermanent and non-permanent membership. We believe\r\nthat the expansion of the Council is both necessary and\r\ndesirable to mirror present-day realities and to enhance\r\nthe Councils effectiveness and legitimacy.\r\nLike other Member States, Samoa supports a\r\ncredible and efficient Security Council as the central\r\npoint of reference in a multilateral peace and security\r\nsystem. In that regard, we continue to support the\r\nincrease in the number of permanent Council members\r\nto include Japan and Germany because of their\r\ninvaluable contribution to the international community.\r\nSamoa first took that stance eight years ago at the\r\nAssemblys fifty-first session, and recently during last\r\nmonths general debate.\r\nThe almost fourfold increase in United Nations\r\nmembership over its 59-year history, comprising in the\r\nmain developing and small island States, makes it\r\nimperative that the expansion of the permanent\r\nmembership of the Council should encompass\r\nrepresentatives from the regions of Asia, Africa and\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean.\r\nIt will always be difficult to carry out any reform\r\nof the Security Council given the sensitivity of the\r\nissues and the competing and sometimes irreconcilable\r\ninterests at stake. That is why my delegation earnestly\r\nawaits the report of the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change and its recommendations to\r\nbreathe new life into Security Council reform. We will\r\nbe actively engaged in the consideration of the Panels\r\nreport and any other ongoing initiatives in the\r\ncollective search for reforming the Security Council so\r\nthat it responds effectively to todays global\r\nchallenges, threats and current realities.\r\nMr. Tekle (Eritrea): The Eritrea delegation takes\r\nthis opportunity to thank the Permanent Representative\r\nof the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern\r\nIreland, Ambassador Sir Emyr Jones Parry, who in his\r\ncapacity as President of the Security Council for the\r\nmonth of October presented the annual report of the\r\nCouncil for the period of 1 August 2003 to 31 July\r\n2004 (A/59/2).\r\nMy delegation also extends its appreciation to the\r\nprevious President of the General Assembly, Mr. Julian\r\nHunte, and his colleagues, Ambassador Luis Gallegos\r\nChiriboga of Ecuador and Ambassador Christian\r\nWenaweser of Liechtenstein, who during the past year\r\nsteered with dedication the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and Other Matters Related to the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nOn the other hand it is dismaying that while the\r\nWorking Group has been seized of the matter and has\r\ncarried out serious consultations since its creation in\r\n1993, no meaningful agreement has been reached to\r\nnarrow the gaps between the varying positions of\r\nMember States, particularly with regard to cluster I\r\nissues, on the increase in the membership of the\r\nCouncil. It is hoped that the recommendations\r\ncontained in the report of the High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change, to be issued on 1\r\nDecember 2004, will add fresh impetus to the efforts\r\nbeing made to create a plausible consensus.\r\nThroughout recorded history, humanity has been\r\npreoccupied with the search for newer and newer\r\nformulas to avert wars, resolve conflicts and maintain\r\npeace and security. The normative changes that take\r\nplace in any historical era inevitably trigger new\r\nepochal values and structures which, in turn, spawn\r\nnew concepts, norms, principles and laws  or modify\r\nold ones  in order to meet the revolutionary changes\r\nof the times.\r\nHumanity has now entered such an era. The end\r\nof the cold war and the advent of globalization have\r\nushered in such epochal changes, with their attendant\r\nconsequences. There is as yet no consensus on whether\r\nglobalization offers hope and opportunities or has\r\nbecome the major source of disasters, discontent and\r\ndespair. Yet, there is agreement that the challenges of\r\nglobalization have become so enormous in both their\r\npresent impact and potential consequences, that they\r\nrequire us to redefine our concepts, norms, principles\r\nand laws. There is also agreement on giving\r\nmultilateralism even more prominence in international\r\nrelations. All seem to agree that the United Nations and\r\nits mechanisms remain the best institutions for meeting\r\nthe challenges of globalization and that they therefore\r\nmust be reformed and revitalized in order to make their\r\nprinciples relevant and structures more competent.\r\nIn the age of globalization, discourse on security\r\ncan no longer be dominated by traditional State-centric\r\nparadigms. While it is true that the defence of a States\r\nsovereignty, unity and territorial integrity remains\r\nparamount, the overwhelming number of people of our\r\nworld, the threat of hunger, disease and environmental\r\ndisasters, as well as internal conflicts and massive\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\ndisplacements, have become equally prominent\r\nconcerns. Indeed, it is not difficult to conceive of\r\nsituations in which the security of the citizens of a\r\nState that faces no threat to its sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity may actually be gravely threatened\r\nby their living conditions. Security must be viewed as\r\ngoing beyond military threats and State-centred\r\nanalysis and must include socio-economic,\r\nenvironmental and political dimensions, as well as the\r\nlinkages among them. The security of human beings\r\nmust be the critical core of concern.\r\nThe achievement of a certain commonality of\r\ninterests among the permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil following the end of the cold war enabled the\r\nCouncil to make some progress in several areas,\r\nincluding the use of force in the prevention of conflict;\r\nthe control of nuclear weapons and other weapons of\r\nmass destruction; the strengthening of the relationships\r\namong institutions of the United Nations, as well as\r\nrelations between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations; and the enhancement of the role of the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nYet it is also evident that the United Nations was\r\nnot prepared to cope with the new threats to\r\ninternational peace and security that were given life\r\nand quickly matured during the great transition to what\r\nhas been dubbed the new world order. It was clear that\r\nneither the Charter nor the structures of the United\r\nNations system were designed to meet such epochal\r\nchanges. Thus, while the Organization could contribute\r\nto the conclusion of the 10-year war between Iran and\r\nIraq and to the smooth transition to Namibian\r\nindependence and could play significant roles in\r\nconflict resolution in Central America, Afghanistan\r\nand Cambodia, it is having difficulties in meeting the\r\nchallenges of terrorism, transnational crime, including\r\nthe trafficking of human beings and of illicit drugs, and\r\nintra-State conflicts, which are often exacerbated by\r\nforeign intervention and massive internal displacement.\r\nAfghanistan, Somalia, Haiti and the former Yugoslavia\r\nare but a few examples.\r\nIndeed, when the United Nations found it\r\nexpedient to involve itself in such conflicts  often in\r\ncooperation with regional organizations  new\r\nquestions arose related to the criteria for intervention\r\nand the reluctance of major Powers, particularly\r\npermanent members of the Council, to subordinate\r\ntheir interests and the interests of their allies  or their\r\ndebtors  to the wider interests of peace and security.\r\nThe need to strengthen the Security Council and\r\nto make it a body that is more representative, united\r\nand proactive but that still reflects the configuration of\r\nglobal power has become self-evident. It is also\r\nbelieved that, if the reform and strengthening of the\r\nSecurity Council is to be meaningful, there must be\r\nequally credible reform and revitalization of other\r\nUnited Nations institutions, including in particular the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Economic and Social Council\r\nand the Secretariat.\r\nThe Eritrean delegation is convinced that, if any\r\nreform is to be effective, the Security Council must\r\nbenefit from the trust and confidence of Member States\r\nby being representative of all Members, rich and poor,\r\nbig and small; it must ensure that its decisions \r\nwhich necessarily affect the lives of people in the most\r\ndirect manner  are anchored in the rule of law and in\r\nrespect for the Charter and other international\r\ninstruments; it must honour treaty agreements to which\r\nthe United Nations itself is a party and by which it has\r\nundertaken the obligation to enforce final and binding\r\ndecisions made by legal mechanisms created at its\r\nbehest; it must ensure that its members  particularly\r\nits permanent members  overcome the restrictive\r\neffects of their respective national interests and that\r\nthey faithfully carry out the collective responsibility of\r\nguarding international peace and security in all parts of\r\nthe world, without fear or favour; it must be truly\r\ntransparent, accessible and accountable; and it must\r\nbenefit from the contributions of non-members \r\nparticularly stakeholders  in such matters as conflict\r\nprevention, peacemaking, peacekeeping and post-\r\nconflict confidence-building.\r\nIt is for those reasons that the Eritrean delegation\r\nsupports the position of the Non-Aligned Movement on\r\nexpanding the membership of the Security Council in\r\nboth the permanent and the non-permanent categories\r\nas well as on the progressive elimination of the veto.\r\nThe veto has hampered the effectiveness of the\r\nSecurity Council; the process aimed at eliminating the\r\nveto must begin so that we may progressively adjust to\r\nits inevitable but not hasty elimination.\r\nAny attempt to reform the Security Council will\r\nbe contingent on the political will of its member States.\r\nThe world is being warned that a new world order is\r\nevolving and that that order brings with it the seeds of\r\nfuture conflict and the possibility of a new epochal\r\nwar. Do we have the unity of interest and purpose to\r\nmeet the challenge?\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nMr. Kmoníček (Czech Republic): Since the\r\nCzech Republic has been actively involved throughout\r\nthe years in the discussions on Security Council\r\nreform, I should like to make a few points with regard\r\nto that topic.\r\nMore than 11 years after the discussions on\r\nSecurity Council expansion began, the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council has been unable to come up with a\r\nrealistic, politically acceptable solution that would\r\nstrengthen the role and functioning of the Security\r\nCouncil. In that respect, we await the report of the\r\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change,\r\nwhich should place United Nations reform  including\r\nreform of the Security Council  in the wider context\r\nof global threats and challenges.\r\nHere, let me briefly reiterate the position of the\r\nCzech Republic. My country is an advocate of Council\r\nexpansion in both categories of membership; our\r\nchoice would be five additional permanent seats and\r\nfour to five additional non-permanent seats. We believe\r\nthat the criteria for selecting new permanent members\r\nshould reflect the candidates overall influence on\r\nworld affairs, taking political, economic, military and\r\ncultural aspects into account. Readiness to participate\r\nin the safeguarding of international peace and security\r\nand the capacity to assume greater financial\r\nresponsibility are crucial for permanent membership.\r\nIn particular, we support the aspirations of Germany\r\nand Japan to permanent seats and the allocation of\r\nthree additional new permanent seats for Africa, Asia\r\nand Latin America. There is no doubt that new\r\npermanent members from among the developing\r\ncountries will help to increase the credibility of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nWith regard to the question of the veto, we\r\ncontinue to favour some reduction in the areas where\r\nthe veto can be applied, possibly through voluntary\r\ncommitments on the part of permanent members and\r\nother steps that do not necessarily require amendment\r\nof the Charter.\r\nThe Czech Republic considers itself a reform-\r\nminded country. We have no vested interest in Security\r\nCouncil reform except for better functioning and\r\ngreater authority of the Council. We share the majority\r\nview that the composition of the Council should be\r\nadjusted to the current state of affairs. The present\r\nsituation is unsustainable; it undermines the legitimacy\r\nof the Councils decisions and therefore calls for\r\naction. Words can be considered action if action\r\nfollows them. Let us take action after 11 years of\r\ndiscussions.\r\nMr. Yáñez-Barnuevo (Spain) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAs this is the first time I have addressed the Assembly\r\nin your presence, Sir, allow me to express to you my\r\nsincere congratulations on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly and to assure you\r\nof our full cooperation in ensuring the success of its\r\nwork.\r\nMy delegation wishes to thank the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom, the current\r\nPresident of the Security Council, for presenting to the\r\nAssembly yesterday the report of the Security Council\r\n(A/59/2), whose content we fully endorse. We are\r\ncertain that the report contains elements of great\r\ninterest to Members of the Organization that will help\r\nthem to evaluate the Councils work. However, as more\r\nthan one delegation has already said, we are aware that\r\nthe report should become a more substantive and\r\nanalytical instrument so that it will promote a debate\r\non how to improve the Councils functioning in the\r\nfuture.\r\nThe Council has already made notable progress in\r\nan area particularly important to my delegation: the\r\ntransparency of the Councils working methods and\r\ncloser exchanges with other Members of the\r\nOrganization. The Council must further intensify, if\r\npossible, its practice of public meetings, with the\r\neffective and widest possible participation of all parties\r\ninterested in the question under consideration.\r\nSpain is firmly committed to the process of\r\nreform of the United Nations as established in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. In that context, Spain\r\nsupports the efforts made to advance the revitalization\r\nof the General Assembly and believes that there should\r\nbe greater reflection on the reform of the Economic\r\nand Social Council and the Security Council and the\r\nadaptation of the entire United Nations system to the\r\nnew challenges that led the Secretary-General, whose\r\nleadership we applaud, to appoint the High-level Panel\r\nthat will issue its report on 1 December.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations system is\r\namong the questions that have generated the most\r\nlively discussion in recent weeks in the Assembly. We\r\ntrust that it will now be possible to make substantial\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nprogress on the urgent and necessary reform and that\r\nthe whole ensemble of institutions and mechanisms of\r\nthe Organization will be considered, wherever it is\r\nnecessary to improve them and make them more\r\neffective. Spain is ready to contribute to that process\r\nthrough ideas and constructive dialogue with all\r\nMember States.\r\nThere is no doubt that within that general\r\nreflection aimed at the action we are all urging, the\r\nquestion of Security Council reform is especially\r\nimportant. However, we must clarify that despite its\r\nimportance, the future development of this question\r\ncannot dictate the overall course of the wider reform,\r\nwhich we know the Organization as a whole requires.\r\nIn other words, that wider reform cannot become\r\nhostage to the success or the failure of the attempts to\r\nreform the Security Council.\r\nBefore spelling out the principles informing the\r\nSpanish position on the possible reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, I wish to express my thanks to the former\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. Julian Hunte,\r\nfor his leadership in the work of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group and the Groups Vice-Chairmen,\r\nAmbassador Luis Gallegos Chiriboga of Ecuador and\r\nAmbassador Christian Wenaweser of Liechtenstein.\r\nTheir report (A/58/47) contributes very interesting\r\ninformation, analysis and reflections on the item under\r\nconsideration.\r\nSpain seeks a reform of the Security Council\r\nbased on the safeguarding and the promotion of the\r\ngreater interests of the Organization and therefore\r\nhopes that the reform can be achieved with the\r\nbroadest consensus of Member States, enhancing the\r\nrepresentativeness, democratization, effectiveness and\r\ntransparency of the Councils work.\r\nTo that end, Spain favours an increase of the\r\nnumber of Member States on the Security Council,\r\nwith the aim of improving the Councils\r\nrepresentativeness at a time when the Organization has\r\n191 Member States. We therefore support an increase\r\nin the number of non-permanent members so that the\r\nvarious geographical areas are duly represented in that\r\ncategory open to all Member States, through their\r\nperiodic election by the Assembly, thus strengthening\r\nthe Councils democratization.\r\nIncreasing the number of permanent members is,\r\nof course, not the only option. Nor is it the best that\r\ncan be conceived. Spain does not favour an increase in\r\nthe number of permanent members, either with or\r\nwithout the veto. The creation of a new category of\r\npermanent members without the veto power would not\r\nin any way reflect the reality of the international\r\ncommunity in the twenty-first century. We are certainly\r\nwilling to consider formulas that in certain\r\ncircumstances permit longer periods on the Council.\r\nWe are convinced that there are States that make a\r\nsignificant contribution to the work of the\r\nOrganization, and we are certain that it would be\r\npossible to find formulas of representation that respond\r\nin the best way to the general interests of the United\r\nNations without having to grant certain States the\r\nprivilege of acceding to the category of permanent\r\nmembers of the Council.\r\nSpain supports addressing the question of\r\nlimiting the veto power of the permanent members,\r\nwith the goal of enhancing the Security Councils\r\neffectiveness and facilitating the decision-making\r\nprocess, in order to prevent a situation in which a\r\nsingle country could block the Councils action. In that\r\ncontext, formulas could be proposed such as limiting\r\nthe veto power to resolutions under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter or deciding that the veto, in order to have\r\neffect, must be imposed by at least two States.\r\nSpain favours continuing to develop the open and\r\naccessible functioning of the Security Council for the\r\nbenefit of greater transparency and to demonstrate that\r\nthe Councils work really is being done on behalf of\r\nMember States  as the Charter says  and in the\r\ninterest of the international community and should thus\r\nreceive the valuable contribution of interested States.\r\nWe support the proposal to promote better\r\ncoordination among the Security Council, the General\r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council in\r\norder to ensure the continuity in the work of the\r\nOrganization towards the maintenance and\r\nconsolidation of peace, while safeguarding the\r\nresponsibilities and the competencies corresponding to\r\neach organ in accordance with the Charter.\r\nWe also support promoting the exchange of\r\ninformation and coordination between the Security\r\nCouncil and the regional organizations that play a\r\nrelevant role in conflict prevention and management, in\r\nparticular, to mention a few, the African Union, the\r\nEuropean Union, the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe, NATO and the Organization of\r\nAmerican States.\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nSpain supports greater dialogue between the\r\nSecurity Council and civil society, especially the non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, the media and academic,\r\nbusiness and union organizations. To that end, the\r\nSecurity Council should improve the established\r\nformulas and explore innovative initiatives such as\r\nsystematic meetings with political, social and\r\neconomic actors during its missions on the ground and\r\nthe holding of thematic seminars on current issues of\r\nimportance to the Council and the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe are faced with an enormous challenge, and we\r\nwant to face it with a spirit of consensus in order to\r\nsafeguard and boost the cohesion of our Organization.\r\nWe hope that our stated basic principles can be taken\r\ninto account during future discussions of possible\r\nreform. We believe they offer an attractive alternative\r\nthat is more representative and democratic for all\r\nMember States, while avoiding unjustified privileges,\r\nand open the important organ that is the Security\r\nCouncil to the broader and more active participation of\r\nall Members, large and small, of our Organization.\r\nWe know that you, Sir, are personally committed\r\nto this process, and we therefore assure you of our\r\ncomplete cooperation.\r\nMr. Gallegos Chiriboga (Ecuador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): At the outset, I wish to give thanks for the\r\nexpressions of gratitude made by many delegations in\r\nthe Hall for the work carried out by Chairman Hunte\r\nand the Vice-Chairpersons of the Working Group, in\r\nparticular with respect to the report of the Working\r\nGroup on Equitable Representation of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn previous debates, Ecuador has stated that the\r\nSecurity Council must be reformed in order to face\r\npresent challenges, which are completely different\r\nfrom those that existed at the Organizations inception\r\nafter the Second World War, more than 50 years ago.\r\nTodays world is completely different from that of\r\n1945. Today we are not facing only intergovernmental\r\nproblems; we are also confronting new, transnational\r\nthreats such as international terrorism, which require\r\nvigorous and effective international coordination.\r\nLarge or small, all countries face the same problem.\r\nThe delegation of Ecuador is grateful for the\r\nreport of the Security Council, which was introduced\r\nby its current President, the Permanent Representative\r\nof the United Kingdom. We consider it an\r\nimprovement, but we believe that it should be more\r\nanalytical in nature. It is our view that reforming the\r\nCouncil requires amending the Charter of the United\r\nNations. That is the only way to create an international\r\nstructure that will allow our Organization truly to meet\r\nthe needs and expectations of each and every one of\r\nour peoples.\r\nIncreasing the number of Council members is a\r\nstep in the right direction, but it is not enough. We\r\nhave to devise new mechanisms that will make the\r\nSecurity Council more effective in fulfilling its\r\nobligations and discharging its mandate. At the same\r\ntime, the resolutions it adopts must be implemented by\r\nthe international community as a whole.\r\nReform must also entail a new definition of the\r\nuse of power and of the veto. Ecuador believes that no\r\nright of veto should exist in an Organization that is\r\nbased on pluralism and democracy and in which all\r\nStates are equal. The veto was a necessary concession\r\nat the time when the Organization was founded, but\r\ncircumstances have changed. The use or threat of use\r\nof the veto has led to the exercise of power in ways\r\nthat are of concern  for instance, what the non-\r\npermanent members of the Security Council term the\r\nsilent veto used by the permanent ones. That threat\r\nto the equality of States must be eliminated.\r\nThe Security Council must become more\r\ndemocratic and more transparent. It has to move in the\r\ndirection of effectiveness. It must avoid drifting into\r\nthe exercise of legislative capacities that are not within\r\nits mandate. All of these changes can be brought about\r\nif there is political will on the part of the Member\r\nStates. It is imperative that we endeavour to arrive at\r\nconsensus decisions that will ensure the international\r\nsystems effectiveness in the quest for peace.\r\nThe year 2005 will be the best one for us as\r\nMember States to take decisions on changes as\r\nfundamental as these, which will enable the\r\nOrganization to lead the international community.\r\nEcuador reiterates its desire to cooperate with\r\nyou, Mr. President, and to contribute, with dedication\r\nand hard work, to all activities aimed at bringing about\r\nstructural reform in the Organization, because we are\r\nconvinced that this is the only way to achieve a more\r\ndemocratic and equitable international community.\r\nMr. Aisi (Papua New Guinea): Mr. President,\r\nthrough you, my delegation thanks Ambassador Emyr\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nJones Parry, in his capacity as the President of the\r\nSecurity Council for October, for presenting the\r\nCouncils report to the General Assembly. I would also\r\ntake this opportunity to commend Ambassador\r\nWenaweser of Liechtenstein and Ambassador Gallegos\r\nChiriboga of Ecuador for their leadership in the work\r\nof the Open-ended Working Group on the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe issue of equitable representation is not a new\r\nmatter for the General Assembly. However, at no other\r\ntime in the last decade has this matter, along with\r\nissues related to the reform and revitalization of the\r\nUnited Nations, been more important. Since Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annans statement at the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly noting the fork in the\r\nroad, the international community has become more\r\nsensitized and more aware of the distinct possibility\r\nthat the much-needed changes within the Organization\r\ncan actually be achieved. Thinking that no changes can\r\nbe effected can only lead us back to the abysmal and\r\nprotracted dialogue to which we all have become\r\naccustomed.\r\nThe United Nations was born out of the ashes of\r\nterrible wars, after which it was pledged that we, as a\r\nhuman family, could not ever let such catastrophes\r\noccur again.\r\nSadly  although no world wars have\r\noccurred  the incidence of many conflicts since the\r\nend of the Second World War means that the\r\ninternational community must stay engaged in the\r\nprocess of preventing conflicts and ensuring that peace\r\nprevails. There is a need for a new compact of shared\r\nresponsibilities in the upholding of the norms of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nAs we see the need for and importance of\r\nattending to conflicts as and when they arise, we also\r\nsee the need for and importance of conflict prevention.\r\nThus the importance of the work of the Security\r\nCouncil becomes more apparent given the current\r\nproliferation of conflicts. The agenda of the Council is\r\ncontinuing to expand, with the holding of a variety of\r\nthematic debates, and its importance has increased,\r\nespecially in relation to the General Assembly. But that\r\ndoes not excuse the General Assembly from accepting\r\nits responsibilities.\r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly, in\r\nour respectful view, is just as important as the need to\r\naddress the issue of equitable representation on and\r\nreform of the Council.\r\nThe issue of equitable representation assumes\r\nthat there is inequity in the makeup of the Council.\r\nIndeed, many have already stated in this debate that the\r\nCouncil was born during a different era and that its\r\ncontemporary form needs to reflect the realities of\r\ntoday. The Council therefore needs to be more\r\nrepresentative of todays global community.\r\nWhile we reiterate our position that both Japan\r\nand Germany should be rightly assigned permanent\r\nseats on the Council, with equal privileges, we also\r\nbelieve that all regions should be fairly represented.\r\nWe contend that one permanent seat each should be\r\nallotted to the following regions: Asia, Africa, Latin\r\nAmerica and Eastern Europe. Likewise, an additional\r\nfour seats should be allotted to the same regions in the\r\nnon-permanent membership category.\r\nIn relation to the veto, we support the contention\r\nthat, while all permanent members should have it, it\r\nshould be restricted to Chapter VII issues. We also\r\nbelieve that, where it is proposed to be used in other\r\nareas, particularly in a reformed Council, it should be\r\nexercised only when two or more members agree to use\r\nit in such a manner.\r\nIn conclusion, the reality is that not every United\r\nNations Member State can become a member of the\r\nCouncil. The 58-year history of the United Nations and\r\nthe Council bears out this fact.\r\nFor many small States, having a voice on the\r\nCouncil is also important, but we are probably better\r\nserved by other Members which have the capacity to be\r\neffective members of the Council. Given that the\r\nmembership is limited  even under a reformed\r\nCouncil  it is not appropriate, in our view, to assume\r\nthat the primary focus of members of the Security\r\nCouncil is merely to serve their national interests.\r\nIn that regard, let me point to the example of\r\nIrelands previous membership on the Council, which\r\nremains a good indicator of what a Member State can\r\ndo for others when there is goodwill.\r\nMr. Stagno Ugarte (Costa Rica) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Allow me, first of all, to thank the President\r\nof the Security Council, the permanent representative\r\nof the United Kingdom, for having introduced the\r\nreport of that body to the General Assembly. We\r\ncommend the efforts of the Security Council to make\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nthis report a more concise and analytical document,\r\nand we urge them to proceed along the same path.\r\nTodays debate has an indispensable part to play\r\nin the operation of this Organization. In accordance\r\nwith the principle enshrined in the Charter of a balance\r\nof power among the various bodies, the Security\r\nCouncil is required to present its report to the General\r\nAssembly. The Assembly, therefore, has the obligation\r\nto carefully examine the work of the Council over the\r\npast year, commending it for its successes and pointing\r\nout any particular areas in which the work of the\r\nCouncil requires improvement or changes.\r\nThe Security Council is an executive body that is\r\nable to act promptly and is competent to handle\r\nspecific situations that pose imminent threats to\r\ninternational peace and security. The Security Council\r\nis in the best position to take effective measures in\r\nemergency situations. The General Assembly, on the\r\nother hand, is the plenary deliberative body of the\r\ninternational community. Only the Assembly can\r\nexpress the firm and definitive opinion of all the\r\ncountries of the world. Only the Assembly has the\r\nlegitimacy conferred upon it by its universal and\r\ndemocratic composition. Since the Council acts on\r\nbehalf of the Members of the Organization, in\r\naccordance with Article 24, paragraph 1, of the\r\nCharter, it must periodically report to the Assembly on\r\nits activities.\r\nIn this context, Costa Rica approves, in general\r\nterms, the work of the Council over the past year. From\r\nthe Caribbean to the South Pacific, from the Horn of\r\nAfrica to the Balkans, the work of the Council has\r\nserved to reduce international tension and build peace.\r\nIt has facilitated the distribution of humanitarian\r\nassistance in Haiti. It has encouraged political\r\nnegotiations in the Great Lakes region of Africa. It has\r\ncontributed to the political stability of Timor-Leste.\r\nThose are important achievements and should not be\r\npassed over in silence.\r\nHowever, in other areas, the work of the Council\r\nrequires improvement or a shift in emphasis. My\r\ncountry would have liked to see it act in a more\r\nresolute manner in promoting peace in the Middle East.\r\nWe would have liked it to consult and coordinate to a\r\ngreater degree with regional mechanisms in the case of\r\nHaiti. We would like to see it acting more prudently in\r\nterms of adopting general standards. The Security\r\nCouncil is not a legislative body. According to the\r\nCharter, its mandate is confined to specific situations\r\nor specific disputes that endanger international peace\r\nand security. According to the Charter, the Council can\r\nadopt binding measures only in so far as they are\r\naddressed to specific conflicts. Adopting general\r\nstandards is reserved to the international community as\r\na whole on the basis of negotiated treaties or the\r\ngradual formation of binding customs.\r\nAs regards combating international terrorism, it is\r\nindispensable for the Council to respond positively to\r\nthe appeal of the High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights and enshrine human rights as the cornerstone of\r\nthe struggle against terrorism. The Council must make\r\nsure that any measures adopted against international\r\nterrorism are in keeping with human rights and\r\ninternational humanitarian law, and in particular the\r\nprinciples of due process and non-refoulement. It is\r\nparticularly indispensable that the Council adopt clear\r\nguidelines so that the inclusion or removal of the\r\nnames of individuals from sanctions lists is more\r\nrespectful of the high international standards of\r\nevidence and due process.\r\nCosta Rica welcomes the work of the Security\r\nCouncils Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). This\r\nbody, which is an ad hoc body set up temporarily, now\r\nplays an important role in the international\r\ncommunitys efforts to combat that crime. But we\r\nbelieve that combating terrorism must become a\r\npermanent activity of the United Nations. This is why\r\nwe think this task should be assigned to a permanent,\r\nprofessional, impartial standing body situated at the\r\ncore of the organic structure of our institution. In this\r\ncontext, I would like to reiterate the proposal made on\r\n22 September by the President of Costa Rica, Abel\r\nPacheco de la Espriella, when he proposed establishing\r\na high commissioner of the United Nations against\r\nterrorism. This proposal appears in document\r\nA/59/383.\r\nAs regards preventing the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, we urge the Security\r\nCouncil to fully comply with the obligations arising\r\nunder article III, section B, paragraph 4, and article\r\nXII, section C, of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency Statute regarding the non-proliferation treaty,\r\nand article VI of the Biological Weapons Convention.\r\nFurther, we urge the Council to reduce the\r\nnumber of requests for information it sends to Member\r\nStates, concentrating only on States whose reports are\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\ndeficient, or in respect of which there is evidence that\r\nthe implementation of the necessary measures is truly\r\ninadequate.\r\nThe Security Council should also reduce the\r\nnumber of thematic debates it holds and should focus\r\nexclusively on topics directly related to specific\r\nsituations that endanger international peace and\r\nsecurity. By their very nature, many of the topics\r\nshould be considered by the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, and not by the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nWe also appeal to the Security Council to present\r\nto the General Assembly special reports under Article\r\n34, paragraph 3, of the Charter every time it wants to\r\nset up a new peacekeeping operation, whenever it\r\nsubstantially modifies a mandate or sets up a new\r\nsanctions regime. Similarly, the Security Council\r\nshould report to the General Assembly whenever a\r\ndraft resolution has been vetoed. The General\r\nAssembly, in discharging its function, should examine\r\nthose reports carefully in order to adopt\r\nrecommendations that, within the scope of its own\r\ncompetencies, support the decisions of the Security\r\nCouncil or, whenever a veto has been cast, make up for\r\nthe failure to act.\r\nAs for reform of the Security Council, we\r\nconsider it necessary to fully implement the principles\r\nalready enshrined in the Charter, in particular the\r\nprinciples of sovereign equality among all States and\r\nequitable geographic distribution. From this\r\nperspective, it goes without saying that the current\r\ncomposition of the Council is undemocratic. A single\r\nregional group, which accounts for 14.7 per cent of the\r\nMember States, holds 60 per cent of the veto power\r\nand 33 per cent of the membership in the Security\r\nCouncil. In the meantime, Africa, Asia, Latin America\r\nand the Caribbean, which taken as a whole constitute\r\n74.3 per cent of the Member States, represent only 53\r\nper cent of the membership on the Council.\r\nFurthermore, within our group, the Group of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States (GRULAC), 14\r\nStates  45 per cent of our membership  have never\r\nhad the chance of serving on the Security Council.\r\nThese statistics show you that reforming the Security\r\nCouncil is urgent.\r\nHowever, over the past 10 years, the process of\r\nSecurity Council reform has focused mostly on the\r\ncreation of new permanent seats. Thus, over the past\r\nfew years, different principles have been proposed on\r\nwhich to base the selection of new permanent\r\nmembers. Some have suggested that population size be\r\ntaken into consideration. Others have said that the\r\ncontribution of candidates to the budget should count.\r\nOthers have advocated the importance of participation\r\nin peacekeeping or economic development. All those\r\nprinciples are valid; however, if we were to apply them\r\nall at the same time, several dozen nations would quite\r\nlegitimately deserve to become permanent members of\r\nthe Council. From a practical point of view, however,\r\nthat would not work.\r\nHence, if we truly want to reform the Council, we\r\nwill have to focus, for the time being, on increasing the\r\nnumber of elected members. In that regard, Costa Rica\r\nadvocates the prompt creation of 10 new non-\r\npermanent seats in the Security Council, three of which\r\nshould be allocated to Africa, three to Asia, one to\r\nEastern Europe, one to Western European and other\r\nStates and two to Latin America and the Caribbean. In\r\na few years, when the international situation has\r\nstabilized, we could consider the possibility of creating\r\nmore permanent members.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation considers that it\r\nwould not be advisable to modify paragraph 2 of\r\nArticle 23 of the Charter. The prohibition of immediate\r\nre-election is a democratic guarantee that enables the\r\nsmaller States, at least once in their history, to belong\r\nto the Security Council.\r\nMr. Dzundev (The former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia): I would like to make a short statement in\r\nthe joint debate on the report of the Security Council\r\nand on the question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters.\r\nMy delegation would like to welcome the holding\r\nof a number of open meetings of the Security Council\r\nover the past year. That approach improves the quality\r\nof the work of the Council and should contribute to its\r\ndecision-making process. It also brings more\r\ntransparency to the Councils work.\r\nRegarding the issue of transparency, let me also\r\nrecall the importance of the Security Council having\r\nearly consultations with Member States before taking\r\ndecisions that affect them. That can contribute to better\r\nunderstanding not only of the Councils work, but also\r\nof the implications of the decisions it takes and of\r\ncompliance by Member States.\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nThe practice of holding open meetings is also\r\nevidence of the change in the Councils work patterns,\r\nalthough one can argue that not all the issues\r\nimmediately fall under the main responsibility of the\r\nSecurity Council. But today, the efforts at maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security should not be seen\r\nonly in the context of the traditional role and practice\r\nof the Council as in the past, but also in terms of\r\naddressing problems that are the cause of conflict,\r\nwhich is no less important than addressing the direct\r\nthreats themselves. Awareness of the fact that the\r\nworld is changing and that we are confronted with new\r\nchallenges justifies the new approach by the Security\r\nCouncil. That is yet another argument in favour of the\r\nneed to reform the Security Council to become a more\r\ncredible and representative body.\r\nLike other delegations, my delegation is looking\r\nforward to the report of the High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change; among other issues of\r\nkey importance to the new role and response of the\r\nUnited Nations, the report should set out proposals on\r\nreform of the Security Council. The proposals should\r\nbe openly discussed among Member States with a view\r\nto obtaining action-oriented results and, to the extent\r\npossible, general agreement.\r\nWith the new increased role of the Security\r\nCouncil in mind, one can legitimately raise the\r\nquestion of Council reform, in particular regarding the\r\nnecessity to expand the membership. The deliberations\r\non that issue in recent years and the general debate at\r\nthis session have led us to the conviction that there is a\r\nwidespread view among United Nations Members that\r\nin this new era and acknowledging the new realities\r\nand confronting the new challenges, it is necessary to\r\nhave a reformed and expanded Security Council. That\r\nexpansion should bring the Council more credibility\r\nand should contribute to the effectiveness of its work.\r\nThe view of my delegation is that the Security\r\nCouncil must be reformed through increasing its\r\nmembership from both developing and developed\r\ncountries to ensure better geographical representation,\r\nand also to strengthen it in substance. As President\r\nCrvenkovski stated in this years general debate, at the\r\n9th plenary meeting, Macedonia is supporting the\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council, in\r\nboth the permanent and the non-permanent categories.\r\nHowever, the expanded role and membership of\r\nthe Security Council should not make the role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly less important or less visible. While\r\nwe are aware of the importance of reforming the\r\nSecurity Council, we also need to strengthen the role of\r\nthe General Assembly and that of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council.\r\nMr. McDonald (Ireland): The debate we are\r\nhaving today is a welcome step towards providing a\r\nmore focused and coherent agenda for the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Ireland supports the recent\r\nimprovements in the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil and is firmly of the view that they need to be\r\nfurther developed.\r\nOne year ago, the Secretary-General announced\r\nthe establishment of the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change to recommend reforms for our\r\ncollective security system. We await the Panels report\r\nand the Secretary-Generals recommendations, which\r\nwill follow.\r\nThe essential requirement, however, is a more\r\neffective system of collective security. Such a system\r\nrequires, as my Foreign Minister said in his speech\r\nhere last month at the 8th plenary meeting, the unique\r\nlegitimacy offered by an effective United Nations and\r\nits Charter. It is now very clear that the composition of\r\nthe Security Council no longer accurately reflects\r\nglobal geographical realities. Here again, my Foreign\r\nMinister expressed his view that a modest and\r\nregionally balanced increase in its membership, both\r\npermanent and non-permanent, is justified.\r\nHowever, whatever the size and composition of\r\nthe Security Council, the obligation of Member States\r\nto comply with the decisions of the Council for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security\r\nremains a bedrock of the collective security system.\r\nIreland is firmly of the view that this system needs to\r\nbe strengthened through more substantial and\r\nmeaningful cooperation among the United Nations\r\nmembership, the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn that regard the report of the Council before us\r\ntoday (A/59/2) is one useful route that can be pursued.\r\nIt is complete and informative as far as it goes.\r\nHowever, it lacks the elements of a more political and\r\nanalytical focus which, we consider, would contribute\r\nto a more informative and meaningful debate.\r\nThe need for that type of substantive debate is all\r\nthe greater given that the Security Council\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\ninterpretation of international peace and security has\r\nbroadened and has moved into semi-legislative areas.\r\nAs we move further into that more complex field,\r\nwhich has implications for the citizens of the States\r\nMembers of the United Nations, we have greater need\r\nfor a methodology that enables each Member State to\r\nexplain clearly the whys and wherefores of decisions\r\nmade in New York in a manner which our electorates\r\ncan comprehend.\r\nIn that respect, the annual debate in this forum\r\nshould afford the membership the opportunity to have a\r\nnecessary debate on the strategic direction of the\r\nCouncil. It is even more the case that we need to foster\r\na broader sense of both ownership and responsibility\r\nwhich can be shared by all the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations. That can realistically be brought about\r\nby only a year-round effort by the Security Council to\r\ninvolve all of us in its ongoing work.\r\nMy delegation, of course, welcomes the steps\r\nwhich have been taken to create a greater sense of\r\nengagement; we welcome all practical steps which can\r\nbe taken to that end. We would also welcome a\r\ndevelopment of the dialogue with regional\r\norganizations. Ireland welcomes the increasing role of\r\nregional and subregional organizations in crisis\r\nmanagement, under the overall authority of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWhile we await the outcome of the work of the\r\nHigh-level Panel and the formal adoption of balanced\r\nreforms for our collective security system, my\r\ndelegation stands ready to support practical steps\r\nwhich may be taken to better engage all the\r\nmembership in all aspects of the work of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMr. Sharma (Nepal): I should like to join\r\nprevious speakers in expressing my delegations\r\nsincere appreciation to Sir Emyr Jones Parry,\r\nPermanent Representative of the United Kingdom and\r\nPresident of the Security Council for the current\r\nmonth, for introducing the annual report of the Security\r\nCouncil for the period 1 August 2003 to 31 July 2004\r\n(A/59/2). The report provides us with information on\r\nactivities on a wide range of issues dealt with by the\r\nCouncil during the past year. The situations in Iraq, the\r\nMiddle East, Afghanistan, Côte dIvoire, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Darfur in the\r\nSudan have prominently figured in the Councils work.\r\nAlso outlined in the report are the Councils\r\nefforts in its work to take on board the broader\r\nmembership of the United Nations. Open debates on\r\nissues of wide interest, monthly briefings to the\r\nGeneral Assembly President by the Council President\r\nand consultations with troop-contributing countries are\r\nsome of the positive changes that have occurred over\r\ntime.\r\nNepal commends those improvements and\r\nencourages the Council to redouble its efforts to make\r\nits reporting richer in substance and its approach more\r\nuser-friendly. However, the report falls far short of\r\nmeeting the reasonable expectations of non-Council\r\nmembers that it should provide deeper, analytical\r\ninsight into the working of the Council. A response to\r\nthat demand made by the general membership of the\r\nUnited Nations to the Council is long overdue. The\r\nCouncil should not rest on its laurels. There is still a\r\nprofound need to improve transparency, efficiency and\r\neffectiveness in its work.\r\nLack of transparency in the Councils work has\r\nbeen a consistent, major bone of contention between\r\nthe permanent members and the general membership of\r\nthe United Nations. We understand that, every so often,\r\nthe Council has to engage in discreet consultations to\r\narrive at urgent and sensitive decisions. But the fact\r\nremains that it cannot fulfil its objectives by itself and\r\nmust rely on the goodwill, support and compliance\r\nfrom the broader international community in order to\r\ndo its job well. And the Council can have those only by\r\nreaching out to all Members and letting them\r\nparticipate in the decision-making process at various\r\nstages. Hence, the current degree of opaqueness in the\r\nCouncils work is hard to justify, and even harder to\r\nappreciate.\r\nPeacekeeping operations are a case in point. The\r\nCouncil now has 16 missions throughout the world,\r\nincluding political ones, aimed at keeping the peace\r\nand facilitating political processes in troubled\r\ncountries. More than 100 countries have sent troops or\r\npersonnel to those missions. It is an enormous task, and\r\nthe Security Council can accomplish it only with the\r\nwilling cooperation of troop-contributing and financing\r\ncountries.\r\nNepal supports the peacekeeping missions in\r\nLiberia, Côte dIvoire, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, the Sudan, Burundi, Kosovo, Afghanistan and\r\nother countries engulfed by conflict. We welcome the\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\ngrowing cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations in keeping peace and promoting\r\nregional stability, and underline the need for the\r\ninstitutionalization of that mechanism.\r\nFor over four decades, Nepal has been an active\r\npartner of the United Nations in its peacekeeping\r\nefforts. We are proud that more than 45,000 Nepalese\r\nnationals have already served as Blue Helmets  and\r\nserved with distinction. Forty-seven valiant Nepalese\r\nhave laid down their lives in the service of humanity\r\nand peace.\r\nCurrently, more than 2,600 Nepalese security\r\npersonnel are being deployed in 12 missions, and by\r\nthe end of this month, their number is likely to have\r\ngrown to over 3,200. Many of them are working in the\r\nmost difficult areas of the most complex missions. The\r\nUnited Nations and the host countries appreciate their\r\nunwavering commitment and outstanding service to\r\npeace.\r\nIt is a matter of serious concern that of late\r\nmembers of the Security Council, particularly\r\npermanent members, have deployed few or no troops in\r\npeacekeeping missions, although they enjoy the\r\npermanent membership and veto power on the basis of\r\nthe presumption that they are the kingpins in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Nepal\r\nurges the permanent members of the Council to\r\ncontribute sizeable numbers of troops to United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations.\r\nNepal is concerned that the Security Council has\r\nbeen stepping on the toes of the General Assembly and\r\nthe Economic and Social Council by moving into the\r\nambit of thematic issues. Even more disturbing are the\r\ngrowing forays by the Security Council into the\r\nlegislative domain, using Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nThis infringement undermines the existing principles\r\nof international law and the treaty-making process, and\r\nundercuts the mandate of the General Assembly.\r\nVarious Security Council resolutions have created\r\nexecution and reporting obligations for Member States.\r\nResolutions 1373 (2001), 1540 (2004) and 1267 (1999)\r\nare some of them. Nepal has been exerting its best\r\nefforts to implement those resolutions and to report on\r\ntime. But resource constraints have made it very\r\ndifficult for us to sustain our compliance. The Council\r\nshould therefore help Nepal and other least developed\r\ncountries to mobilize financial and technical support\r\nand assistance in order to build capacity and fill the\r\nresource gap.\r\nNepal commends the work carried out by the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Related\r\nMatters, and applauds the initiative taken by the former\r\nPresident of the General Assembly. It is our position\r\nthat we must agree on all six areas that the Working\r\nGroup has identified  the size of the Council,\r\nregional representation, criteria, the relationship\r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil, accountability and the use of the veto  in\r\norder to arrive at a viable consensus for Council\r\nreform.\r\nFor the past several years, Nepal has supported\r\nthe expansion of the Councils membership, both in the\r\npermanent and the non-permanent categories, so as to\r\nmake the Council more effective and more\r\nrepresentative. We have also strongly called for greater\r\ntransparency and democracy in the Councils work.\r\nConsistent with this, the Council should undergo\r\na limited expansion to preserve its agility and\r\neffectiveness; the current 1:2 ratio between permanent\r\nmembers and non-permanent members must be\r\nmaintained. Larger countries have always participated\r\nmore frequently than smaller ones as non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Council. What would make the\r\nCouncil truly democratic would be to give small States\r\nthe opportunity to contribute to the work of the\r\nCouncil. That must be ensured in an expanded Council.\r\nI would like to draw the attention of Member\r\nStates to the statement that Nepals head of delegation\r\ndelivered in the general debate. In his statement, he\r\nunderlined that the aspirations of some Member States,\r\nincluding India, Japan, Germany and Brazil, merited\r\nserious consideration for permanent membership. I\r\nreaffirm the statement made by the minister. Africa\r\nmust also have a permanent seat in an enlarged\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations\r\nwould be an opportune time to transform the Security\r\nCouncil. By the end of this year, the High-level Panel\r\non Threats, Challenges and Change would have\r\npresented its report giving Member States ample time\r\nto reflect on its recommendations. But if Member\r\nStates fail to arrive at a consensus on the expansion in\r\nthe permanent membership category, then efforts must\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nbe exerted to enlarge the non-permanent category,\r\npending expansion of the permanent one.\r\nNepal believes, as per Article 24, paragraph 3,\r\nand Article 15, paragraph 1 of the Charter, that the\r\nCouncil is responsible to report to the General\r\nAssembly on the measures it adopts for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The\r\nAssembly is empowered to provide guidance to the\r\nCouncil. Therefore, the Assembly must rise to its own\r\nobligations.\r\nCouncil members ought to be accountable to the\r\nwider membership of the United Nations and should be\r\nable to rise above their national interests. In this\r\ncontext, the manner in which veto power is being used\r\ndoes not inspire confidence and weakens the credibility\r\nof the Council as an unbiased arbiter in the realm of\r\ninternational peace and security. In fact, Nepal strongly\r\nsupports the eventual elimination of veto power and\r\ncalls on Member States to work out a formula to\r\nrationalize its use until it is abolished.\r\nResolute measures are critical to making the\r\nSecurity Council a guardian of international peace and\r\nsecurity, for which it was established. Concerted efforts\r\nto achieve the collective goal of humanity will\r\nstrengthen the Council and the United Nations as a\r\nwhole. This is the challenge that confronts us today.\r\nMr. Lidén (Sweden): May I begin by welcoming\r\nthe report of the Security Council contained in\r\ndocument A/59/2, introduced yesterday by Sir Emyr\r\nJones Parry. I note that once again the report points to\r\nthe increased workload of the Council. It is\r\nencouraging that, in spite of this, the Council has held\r\na number of open meetings throughout the year. I\r\nstrongly hope that this practice will continue and, if\r\npossible, be expanded.\r\nSweden, too, is a strong supporter of Security\r\nCouncil reform. We believe that, as the world changes,\r\nso must the Council. It must be able to manage change\r\nin order to stay relevant, representative and efficient.\r\nIts composition must be adapted to mirror todays\r\nworld and to address todays global challenges.\r\nThe debate on Security Council reform has been\r\ngoing on for over a decade. As we approach next years\r\nimportant summit, it is high time to come to an\r\nagreement. If we fail now, we might fail for a long time\r\nto come. Sweden is ready to shoulder its responsibility.\r\nFortunately, this year, we have seen some\r\nprogress in the debate. Much credit goes to the\r\nSecretary-General, who, by establishing the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change, has been\r\ninstrumental in creating todays political momentum.\r\nWe trust that the Panels recommendations, to be\r\nissued in December, will be concrete, creative and\r\nbold. They should provide us with impetus, thus\r\nenabling us to build consensus on the main reform of\r\nthe Security Council, and paving the way for a formal\r\ndecision at the next General Assembly session. We\r\nshould use this window of opportunity.\r\nFor many years, Sweden has taken an active part\r\nin the endeavours to reach consensus on far-reaching\r\nreform. We remain committed to that goal. We believe\r\nthat for the Council to fulfil its crucial role in our\r\ncollective security system it must be legitimate and\r\nrelevant. This could be achieved by enlarging the\r\nmembership of the Security Council to make it more\r\nrepresentative.\r\nSince the adoption of the United Nations Charter,\r\na limited number of countries across the globe have\r\nemerged as key political and economic Powers. They\r\nshould be given a role in the work of the Security\r\nCouncil that is commensurate to their importance. In\r\naddition, an enlarged Security Council must ensure the\r\nlegitimate interests of small and medium-sized\r\ncountries. As an option for the future, Sweden does not\r\nrule out a joint seat for the European Union (EU).\r\nAn expansion of the Security Council should not\r\nbe allowed to undermine its efficiency. A way to make\r\nthe Councils work more effective would be to limit the\r\nuse of the veto power, and the efforts to modernize the\r\nworking procedures of the Security Council need to\r\ncontinue.\r\nIn December, we will find ourselves at yet\r\nanother important juncture. This time, we cannot afford\r\nto fail.\r\nMr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The General Assembly decided to consider\r\nboth the report of the Security Council contained in\r\ndocument A/59/2 and the reform of the Council in a\r\njoint debate. Both questions are clearly interlinked, and\r\nboth are crucial for our Organization.\r\nI am participating in this debate, and my\r\ndelegation would like to start by making some general\r\ncomments before coming to the two items in question.\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nThe first general comment has to do with the\r\nconsideration of the report of the Security Council by\r\nthe General Assembly and the requirement to do so.\r\nThis requirement is contained in the Charter, and it\r\npresents an ideal opportunity for the United Nations\r\nfamily, through the General Assembly, to consider how\r\nthis organ  to which the primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security has\r\nbeen entrusted  did its job throughout the reporting\r\nperiod. In this respect, here are a few points I would\r\nlike to make.\r\nArticle 15, paragraph 1, of the Charter very\r\nclearly states,\r\nThe General Assembly shall receive and\r\nconsider annual and special reports from the\r\nSecurity Council; these reports shall include an\r\naccount of the measures that the Security Council\r\nhas decided upon or taken to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nParagraph 3 of Article 24 states that the Security\r\nCouncil shall submit annual and, when necessary,\r\nspecial reports to the General Assembly for its\r\nconsideration.\r\nThose two Articles of the Charter take us right to\r\nthe heart of the question of the intertwined\r\ncompetences of the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil in the area of the maintenance of peace. We\r\nbelieve that they clearly demonstrate the Assemblys\r\npre-eminence and central position in deliberations on\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe present debate is therefore important in the\r\nframework of the revitalization and the strengthening\r\nof the General Assemblys authority. Accordingly, we\r\ncontinue to stress that this debate should not merely\r\nconsist of general statements. The Security Council\r\nshould reflect in its work the comments and the\r\nproposals made in the Assembly. In that regard, we\r\npropose that the General Committee, at the conclusion\r\nof the consideration of this item, make a synthesis of\r\nthe comments and observations on the Security Council\r\nand that the Council convene a meeting to examine\r\nthose observations.\r\nMy second general observation concerns\r\nenlarging the Security Council, which my country has\r\nalways considered to be of special importance.\r\nMembers will recall that in 1963, Cameroon\r\ncosponsored the draft resolution adopted as resolution\r\n1991 (XVIII) of 17 December 1963, which increased\r\nfrom 6 to 10 the number of non-permanent members on\r\nthe Council. Similarly, noting that the membership of\r\nthe United Nations had increased from 113 Members in\r\n1960 to 154, Cameroon was one of the initiators of\r\ndraft resolution A/35/L.34/Rev.1, which aimed to\r\nincrease the number to 16. Unfortunately, that draft\r\nresolution was not adopted. We are pleased to note that\r\namong the proposals now before the Assembly on the\r\nincrease in the number of non-permanent Council\r\nseats, the number of 16 seats has been retained, at least\r\nby Africa and the countries of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement.\r\nHaving made those general comments, I shall\r\naddress the two items under consideration. First, with\r\nrespect to the report of the Security Council (A/59/2),\r\ntaking into account the recommendations made by\r\nStates when considering the report, the Security\r\nCouncil  and we pay tribute to it for this  made\r\nsome important improvements to the text of the report\r\nbefore the Assembly. The report was first submitted to\r\nthe Assembly in its current, synthesized form in\r\nOctober 2002, under Cameroons presidency of the\r\nSecurity Council. In that context, I convey to our\r\nfriend and colleague Ambassador Sir Emyr Jones Parry\r\nour appreciation for the high quality of his masterful\r\nintroduction to this excellent and comprehensive report\r\ncontaining a wealth of useful information.\r\nThe Council has worked hard over the reporting\r\nperiod to improve both the transparency of its work\r\nand, above all, its treatment of crucial questions related\r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nUnderstandably, I shall use the example of Africa. We\r\nare pleased to note in the report that Africa remains the\r\nSecurity Councils foremost concern. Thirty-one of 61\r\nresolutions, 74 of the 213 meetings of the Council, 20\r\nof 45 presidential statements and 15 of its 27 official\r\ncommuniqués were devoted to Africa. We also note\r\nthat four of the five sanctions committees that\r\npublished reports during the reporting period deal with\r\nAfrican countries. We had the privilege of chairing the\r\nSecurity Councils informal working group on\r\nsanctions, and we appreciated the importance and the\r\nusefulness of sanctions, in particular targeted\r\nsanctions, for peacekeeping and peace-building,\r\nparticularly in Africa.\r\nAt the present time, the outcome of the\r\nmultidimensional action of the Security Council on\r\nAfrica can be clearly seen. With the exception of six or\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nseven countries, Africa is enjoying relative political\r\nstability.\r\nFurthermore, we appreciate the Security\r\nCouncils efforts further to develop fruitful cooperation\r\nwith regional organizations. In that respect, we\r\nunderline Central Africas determination, through the\r\nEconomic Community of Central African States, to\r\norganize to promote peace and development. To that\r\nend, it has established structures within the Council for\r\nPeace and Security in Central Africa, known as\r\nCOPAX.\r\nCentral Africa wishes to strengthen cooperation\r\nnot only with the Security Council but with the entire\r\nUnited Nations system. That is why we continue to\r\nstress that we in Central Africa should be given\r\npermanent political structures to coordinate United\r\nNations action.\r\nWith respect to the question of the increase of the\r\nmembership of the Council, next year the Organization\r\nwill celebrate its sixtieth birthday, and the United\r\nNations has fixed the year 2005 to review progress on\r\nthe discussion of reform and on implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nThe debate on Security Council reform has been\r\ngoing on for 11 years. The peoples of the United\r\nNations are waiting with impatience and with hope for\r\nSecurity Council reform to be achieved. Despite the\r\nmany difficulties, we are duty-bound to complete the\r\nreform process. Last year, when the Secretary-General\r\naddressed the fifty-eighth session, he warned that the\r\ndifficulty of reaching agreement does not excuse our\r\nfailure to do so. The Secretary-Generals observation\r\nremains true.\r\nThe great majority of Member States agree on an\r\nincrease in the number of Security Council members in\r\nboth categories. It is therefore urgent that we agree on\r\nthe modalities for such an increase. Ideas and proposals\r\nin that regard were already formulated by delegations\r\nduring the consultations held in previous meetings of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group. We hope that the\r\nconclusions, proposals and recommendations that we\r\nhope will be made by the High-level Panel will add\r\nfurther substance to our discussions and debates so that\r\nwe can take decisions.\r\nHere, Mr. President, I should pay a well-deserved\r\ntribute to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Julian\r\nHunte, for his innovative proposals on the form of our\r\ndebates. It is now up to you to continue on the course\r\ncharted by your predecessor, bearing in mind  as you\r\nyourself indicated at the close of the general debate \r\nthe forceful reference, made in their statements by the\r\nleaders of 140 States, to this issue of Security Council\r\nexpansion.\r\nAfrica, for its part, made known its proposals on\r\nexpansion in the Harare Declaration of 1997. Our\r\ncontinent expressed its wish to have seven seats,\r\ncomprising five non-permanent seats and two\r\npermanent seats, allocated by rotation in a Security\r\nCouncil expanded to 26 members. My country  as\r\nwe indicated during the general debate  fully\r\nsupports the Declaration, which we believe remains\r\nvalid.\r\nIn that connection, we should strongly emphasize\r\nthat Security Council reform must also take into\r\naccount the legitimate desire of all Member States \r\nrich and poor, large and small  to serve the cause of\r\npeace. I hear people say that they doubt that there are\r\ngood reasons for such an expansion, for reasons of\r\neffectiveness. Effectiveness is often mentioned to\r\noppose Council expansion. In our view, that stems\r\nfrom a concept of the criterion for contributing to the\r\nmaintenance of peace that is limited to a States\r\nmilitary means or its capacity to intervene. We are\r\noften told  and this is very important  that people\r\noften forget that an organizations effectiveness\r\ndepends not only on the speed of decision-making; it is\r\nalso tied to meeting the objective being sought by the\r\nvarious members of that organization.\r\nIn addition, people forget that contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of peace also results from steadfastness in\r\npeace negotiations. Contribution to the maintenance of\r\npeace results from steadfastness in mediation to put an\r\nend to conflicts. In that regard, States that are small or\r\nthat lack great military power can make a remarkable\r\ncontribution to the maintenance of peace. We might\r\nwonder, then, whether the current composition of the\r\nCouncil has always guaranteed great effectiveness and\r\nspeed in taking decisions and acting on them.\r\nOne year before the symbolic meetings\r\ncommemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, my country appeals for calmness, serenity and\r\na spirit of compromise so that we can swiftly arrive at\r\na consensual solution that will guarantee the unity of\r\nthe Organization and the sought-after effectiveness of\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nthe Security Council. Cameroon, for its part, remains\r\nopen to dialogue and to consensus at every level.\r\nMr. Grey-Johnson (Gambia): My delegation\r\ncommends the Security Council for a detailed and\r\ncomprehensive report (A/59/2), which shows how fully\r\nengaged the Council has remained on all the key\r\nissues. We commend all its members for their hard\r\nwork and dedication over the past year.\r\nWhile it is true that the Middle East has\r\naccounted for a good part of the Councils time, it is\r\nalso very clear that much more needs to be done to\r\neffectively contain the situation in that region.\r\nAttention must be focused more sharply on the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian question, and more concrete measures must\r\nbe devised to get all concerned to begin moving\r\ntowards the ultimate objective of the road map: the\r\ncreation of a Palestinian State existing side by side and\r\npeacefully with the State of Israel.\r\nThere is no gainsaying the fact that, in spite of\r\nthe Councils efforts, the situation deteriorated further\r\nduring this reporting period. Settlements and refugee\r\ncamps are being attacked on a regular basis, while\r\nsuicide bombers cause havoc among innocent civilians.\r\nThe whole world, meanwhile, watches helplessly as\r\ncasualties rise from day to day. My delegation urges\r\nthe Council to act urgently and more aggressively to\r\nbring the situation under control. For there is no doubt\r\nthat the Israeli-Palestinian issue is what inspires and\r\ndrives a number of other conflict situations elsewhere.\r\nFor a start, the Council may wish to consider\r\nmeasures aimed at fully enforcing the ruling of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice on the legal\r\nconsequences of the construction of a wall in the\r\noccupied Palestinian territory. It is indeed a matter of\r\nregret that it is over the salient issues surrounding the\r\nIsraeli-Palestinian question that the Council often\r\ncannot reach agreement, as evidenced by the number of\r\ndraft resolutions on that question that it has not been\r\nable to adopt.\r\nMy delegation notes with satisfaction the ending\r\nof the occupation of Iraq with the transfer of\r\nsovereignty to an Interim Iraqi Government. We look\r\nforward to the Councils continued engagement with\r\nthat Government as it moves forward with the political\r\ntransition. The security situation in that country gives\r\nmuch cause for concern and will definitely affect the\r\ndegree of United Nations involvement in the political\r\nprocess. Even so, the Council must do all it can to\r\nassist in putting out the fires of war and in restoring a\r\nmore normal and more bearable life for the suffering\r\nIraqi people.\r\nThe Councils achievements in Africa have been\r\ncommendable. Peacekeeping and peace-building\r\nefforts have shown remarkable results, particularly in\r\nWest Africa. Significant progress has been made in\r\nSierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau.\r\nImprovements have been slower in Côte dIvoire. That\r\nrequires us all to do more to enable all parties in that\r\nconflict to subsume their individual differences in the\r\ngreater interest of the Ivorian people and then to return\r\nto the negotiating table to begin implementing the\r\nLinas-Marcoussis Accord.\r\nSpecial challenges continue to be presented to the\r\nCouncil by the situation in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo and the situation in Burundi. Those\r\nsituations call for a sharper focus on the causes and\r\nantecedents of the conflicts in those countries with a\r\nview to ensuring that they are properly addressed and,\r\nif possible, rooted out.\r\nIn all the post-conflict situations in Africa,\r\nparticularly in West Africa, what stands out in bold\r\nrelief is the need for appropriate interventions to\r\nrelaunch economic growth in ways that will have a\r\npositive impact on the lives of the people. That is the\r\nonly insurance against a relapse into conflict for, as has\r\nbeen amply demonstrated, poverty, deprivation and\r\neconomic marginalization are the major factors that\r\ngive rise to violent upheaval. Addressing those issues\r\nin post-conflict situations therefore constitutes an\r\nimportant contribution to the consolidation of peace.\r\nRegrettably, this aspect of peace-building has been\r\nseverely downplayed, as evidenced by the dire\r\nsituations in Guinea-Bissau, Liberia and, to a lesser\r\nextent, Sierra Leone. In fact, in Guinea-Bissau, when\r\nthe army recently mutinied over salary arrears this\r\nalmost led to the collapse of the peace-building effort\r\nand the political process. Fortunately, the situation was\r\ncontained, albeit with the sad loss of life of the chief of\r\nthe armed forces and a few of his colleagues. But if\r\nthings had crumbled the cost to the international\r\ncommunity of putting them back on track would have\r\nbeen enormous. It therefore seems more cost-effective\r\nto provide the investments necessary to stimulate\r\neconomic growth in ways that will create jobs and\r\nensure that the workforce, especially the youth, are\r\ngainfully employed and have the opportunity to earn\r\nrealistic incomes.\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nMy delegation is aware that the Council did\r\nindeed hold a public meeting on the role of business in\r\nconflict prevention, peacekeeping and post-conflict\r\npeace-building and commends it for that initiative. We\r\nare also aware that the Council has been working with\r\nthe Economic and Social Council on some of those\r\nissues. Equally, the Security Councils Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group on Conflict Prevention and Resolution\r\nin Africa continues to actively pursue its mandate. We\r\ncan only hope that through its work the Council will\r\nfind the means to shore up peace-building gains in\r\nways that address the need for economic growth and\r\nemployment creation in post-conflict areas, so that the\r\nsurrounding socio-economic environment in post-\r\nconflict situations ceases to constitute an important\r\ntrigger of conflict.\r\nA second area of concern has to do with the need\r\nto realign militaries in post-conflict situations to the\r\npeacetime needs of their countries. Oftentimes, it is\r\ntheir very inability to act like peacetime militaries that\r\ngives rise to a cycle of instability and violence.\r\nCountries emerging from conflict should be assisted to\r\nrestructure their armed forces and scale them down to\r\nfit the needs of a country at peace. The Council should\r\npay urgent attention to that issue.\r\nWe commend the Council for its efforts in\r\nworking with African regional and subregional\r\nintergovernmental organizations to find solutions to\r\nsome of the daunting problems that have dogged\r\nprogress on the African continent. We urge the Council\r\nto continue and even to intensify that process so that\r\nsynergy is generated among all major actors in the\r\nsearch for answers to our problems relating to peace,\r\nsecurity and development.\r\nThere is general agreement among all Member\r\nStates that the present composition of the Security\r\nCouncil does not mirror present-day global realities or\r\neven the present pattern of membership of the United\r\nNations. The Gambia has always joined those Member\r\nStates that have called for action to have that anomaly\r\nredressed. The Open-ended Working Group on reform\r\nof the Security Council certainly covered some ground\r\nduring the fifty-eighth session and it is to be expected\r\nthat its achievements will be complemented by the\r\nwork of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges\r\nand Change.\r\nMy delegation reiterates once more the position\r\nof the African Union that Africa must be represented\r\non the Security Council in the permanent category, as\r\nwell as having its representation in the non-permanent\r\ncategory increased. Countries such as Japan, which\r\nmake important contributions to the operations of the\r\nOrganization, must also be considered for a permanent\r\nseat on the Council. My delegation hopes that during\r\nthis session much progress will be made towards\r\nbringing this lingering question to final closure.\r\nMr. Kaludjerović (Serbia and Montenegro):\r\nAllow me at the outset to express the appreciation of\r\nmy delegation to the President of the Security Council,\r\nAmbassador Emyr Jones Parry, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom, for his\r\nintroduction of the report of the Security Council\r\n(A/59/2).\r\nAs stated in the report, over the past 12 months\r\nthe Security Council has addressed a wide range of\r\nissues, from those directly threatening international\r\npeace and security  such as acute crises  to those\r\nof a global character involving the fight against\r\nterrorism, non-proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, peacekeeping operations and other\r\nthematic issues that are of no less importance in the\r\npresent-day world.\r\nThe involvement of the Security Council on a\r\nwide range of issues reaffirms its role in todays\r\ninterdependent world. But it also points to the need for\r\nit to adapt to current international circumstances. The\r\npolitical picture of the world has changed to the point\r\nwhere it is necessary to reform the structure of the\r\nUnited Nations, and particularly that of the Security\r\nCouncil, as the Organizations key body. In our view,\r\nsuch reform should primarily involve more equitable\r\nrepresentation and, by extension, more balanced\r\nparticipation among developed and developing\r\ncountries. In effecting those reforms we have to take\r\ninto account the responsibility of those countries that\r\nmake the greatest contributions to the United Nations,\r\nparticularly to peacekeeping operations, as well as their\r\nlegitimate interests. At the same time, an\r\noverwhelming majority of countries, including newly\r\nestablished ones, should be adequately represented so\r\nas to avoid exclusiveness in the decision-making\r\nprocess. In that regard, we strongly believe that the\r\nGroup of Eastern European States should be granted\r\none additional non-permanent seat on an expanded\r\nSecurity Council.\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nTransparency in the work of the Security Council\r\nis highly relevant to the strengthening of international\r\nsolidarity and responsibility. In that regard, we highly\r\nvalue the practice introduced by some members of the\r\nSecurity Council of briefing the broader membership\r\non the Councils activities. We are also encouraged by\r\nthe number of open meetings in which other Member\r\nStates are invited to participate.\r\nPeacekeeping operations are one of the most\r\nimportant tools for the Security Council to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security. That was clearly\r\ndemonstrated last year with the establishment of a\r\nnumber of new United Nations peacekeeping\r\nmissions  in Burundi, Côte dIvoire, Liberia and\r\nHaiti, as well as the monitoring mission in Iraq. A\r\ncomprehensive approach to the issue of peacekeeping\r\noperations, with clear goals and legal criteria used to\r\ndefine their mandates, will greatly facilitate the\r\nestablishment of peace and improve the efficiency of\r\npeacekeeping operations. Setting up new missions \r\nwhich today are much more diverse in character,\r\nencompassing both conflict prevention and the\r\nmaintenance of peace, including post-conflict\r\nreconstruction and long-term social development \r\nrequires a multidisciplinary approach to complex\r\ncrises, particularly those on the African continent.\r\nTerrorism continues to pose a grave threat of\r\nglobal proportions. As stated in the report, over the\r\npast year there has been an increase in both the number\r\nand gravity of terrorist attacks, which is why the fight\r\nagainst terrorism should remain one of the major areas\r\nof engagement of Security Council.\r\nIn that respect, the adoption of Security Council\r\nresolution 1540 (2004), which obliges Member States\r\nto adopt and enforce appropriate and effective laws and\r\nto undertake administrative measures with a view to\r\npreventing terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, is of vital significance. My country fully\r\nsupports the activities of the Security Council in that\r\nfield.\r\nA considerable part of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil is devoted to my country. The fact that during\r\nthe reporting period Ministers of Foreign Affairs of\r\nSerbia and Montenegro addressed Security Council\r\nmeetings on two occasions testifies to the difficult\r\nsituation in our province of Kosovo and Metohija. We\r\nfully concur with the assessment in the report that mid-\r\nMarch violence led by Kosovo Albanian extremists\r\nagainst the minority Serb community had been an\r\norganized, widespread and targeted campaign and\r\nrepresented a huge setback to stabilization and\r\nreconciliation in the province and that violence had\r\nchallenged the sustainability of the international\r\ncommunitys efforts to build a multi-ethnic Kosovo\r\n(ibid., p. 15).\r\nWe expect the Security Council to exert\r\nadditional pressure on the Provisional Institutions of\r\nSelf-Government in Kosovo and Metohija to\r\nimplement two key sections of the Kosovo Standards\r\nImplementation Plan: sustainable returns and the rights\r\nof communities and their members, and freedom of\r\nmovement. We also expect the Security Council to do\r\nits utmost to speed up the reconstruction efforts of\r\ndestroyed churches and monasteries that represent not\r\nonly part of the Serbian, but an integral part of the\r\nEuropean cultural heritage.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to recall the\r\nwords of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, Mr. Vuk Draković, at the Security\r\nCouncil meeting on 11 May 2004, as cited in the\r\nreport: that the standards before status policy must\r\nprovide for full security, right to life and other human,\r\ncivil and ethnic rights of Serbs and other minority\r\ncommunities in Kosovo (ibid.).\r\nSurvival, life in peace and security as well as the\r\nright to return are basic preconditions without which it\r\nwill not be possible to make progress in Kosovo and\r\nMetohija. The European character of Kosovo and\r\nMetohija within Serbia and Montenegro, based on\r\nEuropean standards of minority protection,\r\ndecentralization and border access, is equally in the\r\ninterest of Albanians, Serbs and other non-Albanian\r\npopulations in the province.\r\nIn that regard, we expect that the appointment of\r\nthe new Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and head of the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK),\r\nMr. Søren Jessen-Petersen, will mark a new, more\r\naction-oriented, active and constructive approach of the\r\ninternational community to the problem.\r\nThe completion strategy of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY),\r\nwhich is mentioned in the report, is in the interest of\r\nSerbia and Montenegro and is in line with its efforts to\r\nfully honour international obligations and actively\r\ncooperate with the Tribunal, particularly in view of\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\ntransferring some trials to national courts. The\r\ncompetent authorities of my country will urgently\r\ninform the ICTY of the measures undertaken to track\r\ndown persons indicted by the Tribunal.\r\nWarrants have recently been issued for the arrest\r\nof four Generals sought by the Tribunal. The National\r\nCouncil for Cooperation with the Tribunal granted\r\nwaivers on 1 October 2004 to 30 witnesses to testify on\r\nclassified military issues and made a decision to\r\ntransmit documents requested by the Tribunal.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that, like\r\nother Member States, we are looking forward to the\r\nreport of the Secretary-Generals High-level Panel on\r\nThreats, Challenges and Change, particularly\r\nconcerning conflict prevention, the link between peace\r\nand development and the need to address root causes\r\nwith a view to preventing, managing and resolving\r\ncomplex crises.\r\nMr. Maquieira (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nPresident of Chile, His Excellency Mr. Ricardo Lagos\r\nEscobar, said when addressing the General Assembly,\r\nat the 4th meeting,\r\nIf we wish to strengthen multilateralism,\r\nreform of the United Nations is becoming\r\nincreasingly necessary. Its ideals and founding\r\npurposes remain valid, but ... the power structure\r\nupon which the Organization was built at its\r\ninception corresponds to a world that is very\r\ndifferent from todays world.\r\nBy its very nature, the Security Council is at the\r\ncentre of the exercise in renewal. We must have a more\r\nrepresentative, transparent and democratic Security\r\nCouncil on which we can rely  in other words, a\r\nbody that enjoys all the prerequisites that determine\r\nwhether an organ is legitimate. We also need a more\r\nefficient and effective Security Council, in other\r\nwords, more functional. We know that we need not\r\nonly to enlarge the Council but to make it more\r\ndemocratic in a thorough reform of the Organization.\r\nThe many statements we have heard here confirm\r\nthat reform is timely from a political perspective, and\r\nthat implies two important dimensions  the Security\r\nCouncil, on the one hand, and the reorganization of the\r\nrest of the system, on the other.\r\nThe Security Council is central to reform, but it is\r\nnot the only element of reform that is necessary, nor\r\nshould it serve as a pretext to distract us from the rest\r\nof the reforms required to strengthen multilateralism\r\nwithin the Organization. That is because organizations\r\nmust reflect political realities. The Security Council,\r\ntogether with the other main bodies of the system, all\r\nneed to be adjusted and made more functional with\r\nstreamlined agendas. Similarly, we should examine the\r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the other\r\nprincipal organs of the system.\r\nIt is important for the work of the Council to\r\ncarefully consider the relationship between the global\r\nand the regional, as dealt with in Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter. That applies in terms of prevention,\r\nmanagement and exit strategies for crises. To some\r\nextent, we have to look at the functioning of the\r\nCouncil in sensitive areas, such as the responsibility to\r\nprotect, as well as preventive action. Those aspects\r\nmust be regulated and guidelines provided  goals\r\nshared by the international community  failing which\r\nmultilateral effectiveness could be weakened.\r\nWe renew our support for the work of the High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change,\r\nappointed by the Secretary-General, and we emphasize\r\nthat great expectations await its recommendations. We\r\nshould voice our confidence that the Panel will\r\nproduce options, perspectives and alternatives that can\r\ncontribute to a comprehensive political compromise\r\nwhere all countries will feel they have benefited. That\r\nmay be the most difficult part of the exercise  even\r\nmore difficult than finding a common perspective\r\nconcerning the reform process.\r\nIn addition to the reform of the Council, Chile\r\nhas upheld a position that I will describe as follows: we\r\nhave supported the expansion of the membership of the\r\nCouncil in both the permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembership categories, in order to facilitate the\r\ngreatest possible participation by developing countries.\r\nWe trust that the Panel will be able to contribute\r\nideas that will enable the Secretary-General to make\r\nrecommendations that will facilitate a political\r\ncompromise in favour of expansion, and that those will\r\nbe accepted by the international community as a whole.\r\nWe have also supported limiting the veto. We\r\nhave supported adopting decisions under Article 18 of\r\nthe Charter, which calls for two thirds of the\r\nmembership of the Organization to agree. Chile would\r\nhave preferred a consensus for reform of the\r\nmembership, but if that is not possible, we prefer the\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nhigher threshold provided by the Charter to obtain that\r\nresult.\r\nFinally, we have supported increased\r\ntransparency in the relationships between the Council\r\nand other bodies of the system. However, Council\r\nreform cannot be limited to changing the number of\r\nmembers; it should also apply to their powers.\r\nIn considering the possibility of increasing the\r\nmembership, we deem it important to bear in mind\r\ncriteria such as representativity, greater diversity, the\r\nright of veto, and power differences between\r\nmembership categories. When the Council was created,\r\nthere were only 51 Member States and 11 Council\r\nmembers. Today there are 15 Council members, but\r\n191 Member States. We therefore must enhance the\r\nCouncils representativity by increasing the number of\r\nits members.\r\nThroughout this process the criterion of\r\neffectiveness should be borne in mind. Increasing the\r\npossibility for countries to participate can be done\r\nthrough expansion and rotation combined, which\r\nwould enable more countries to sit on the Council.\r\nFinally, reducing the gap between the powers\r\nenjoyed by the two categories of members entails\r\nlimiting the use of the veto, for example only to\r\nChapter VII issues; using a qualified majority to\r\novercome a veto; pinpointing areas in which two\r\nvetoes are required to prevail, and so on. These are\r\nsome of the aspects that Chile has considered in terms\r\nof reforming the Security Council.\r\nMr. Chimphamba (Malawi): Mr. President,\r\nallow me to join others who have spoken before me in\r\nmaking a small contribution on the question of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters. At the same time, I would like to thank the\r\nCouncil for its very important report.\r\nUnder Article 24 of the United Nations Charter,\r\nMember States confer on the Security Council the\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, the functions of which\r\nfall mainly under two headings. These are the pacific\r\nsettlement of disputes and action with respect to threats\r\nto the peace, breaches of the peace and acts of\r\naggression.\r\nAlthough not all United Nations Member States\r\nsit on the Council  and, indeed, some have never\r\nbeen a member of the Council  its work is of specific\r\nnational, regional and international interest and has far-\r\nreaching ramifications for all countries.\r\nThe Security Council contributes to the solution\r\nof conflicts and to the creation of conditions for\r\nsustainable peace, in particular through peacekeeping\r\noperations. Malawi, my own country, is proud and\r\npleased to be a participant in such peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nBut, as the United Nations approaches its sixtieth\r\nanniversary, it must be recognized that the principles\r\nand norms of its Charter reflect the historical realities\r\nof a specific moment. The radically new nature of\r\ntodays challenges and threats demands a decisive and\r\ncomprehensive adjustment effort. The need for change\r\nis there, but Member States must consider carefully\r\nhow to initiate such change and how to build\r\nconsensus.\r\nToday the United Nations is almost four times\r\nbigger than when it was created. It has now become\r\ntruly global and universal in character. However, the\r\ncurrent membership of the Security Council has come\r\nunder scrutiny and has been criticized for not being\r\nsufficiently representative. The central institutional\r\nquestion is that its composition does not reflect the\r\ndistribution of power on the international scene. Thus\r\nthe majority of Member States believe that the\r\nlegitimacy of the Security Councils decisions is\r\nweakened by such questionable representativity. There\r\nis a strong belief that the Security Council should be\r\nexpanded to empower it to implement the principles\r\ngoverning human security in the field; otherwise,\r\nimposing sanctions might well harm the population in\r\ndefence of which sanctions are undertaken.\r\nIn order to solve the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on the Security Council, the General\r\nAssembly established, as we all know, a Working\r\nGroup to consider all aspects of an increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and improvements\r\nin its working methods.\r\nTerrorism represents a new type of threat, as does\r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and\r\nthe existence of States whose Governments are unable\r\nto exercise power over their territory and population in\r\nan effective way, often due to a lack of legitimacy. The\r\neffects of the globalization process reveal these threats\r\nclearly. Such threats demand a review of the functions\r\nof the Security Council, hence the need to reform it in\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\norder to enable a wider participation of Member States\r\nthrough an increased membership.\r\nUsually the Security Council acts when a crisis\r\nhas already erupted. Consequently, its resolutions are\r\nof a punitive nature, instead of addressing long-term\r\nchallenges in the areas of economic assistance, the\r\npromotion of human rights, good governance and debt\r\nreduction, with a view to consolidating the work of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. Malawi believes that the\r\nSecurity Council, as one of the principal organs of the\r\nUnited Nations, is long overdue for reform and\r\nexpansion. In that respect, I support all the other\r\nMember States that have pleaded sincerely for an\r\nexpansion of the Council and a change in its methods\r\nof work.\r\nMr. Own (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): Let me take this opportunity to express my\r\ndelegations appreciation to Mr. Julian Hunte, the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nsession, for the able manner in which he guided the\r\nwork of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Related\r\nMatters. We commend also the constructive efforts of\r\nhis two Vice-Chairmen, the representatives of\r\nLiechtenstein and of Ecuador, to achieve progress in\r\nthe process of comprehensive reform of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the joint debate by the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the reports of the Security\r\nCouncil and of the Open-ended Working Group,\r\nrespectively, which include reference to a number of\r\nmeasures to improve and reform the methods of work\r\nof the Security Council. However, the tireless efforts\r\nmade are appreciated but they do not meet our\r\nexpectations  and we insist on the fulfilment of our\r\nexpectations. The report of the Security Council has\r\nonly passing references to informal consultations.\r\nWhat we would like to emphasize is that the report\r\nshould include a discussion of the real mechanism of\r\nthe decision-making process, which occurs sometimes\r\neven before the Security Council begins discussing a\r\nmatter. The consultations of the Council should,\r\nhowever, begin after open discussion, not the reverse.\r\nThe absolute majority of this Organization finds\r\nitself addressing matters that have been pre-decided,\r\nwhere Members are required merely to accept those\r\ndecisions. The Security Council should promote\r\nrelations with all States, particularly those States\r\naffected by the issue under consideration. It should also\r\nexpand its cooperation with regional bodies and\r\norganizations in accordance with the provisions of\r\nChapter VIII of the Charter. Additionally, we support\r\nthe proposal that the Council be required to have a\r\ncomprehensive review of its work. It is important that\r\nthe Council take the necessary steps to make all\r\nmeasures binding in positive response to the proposals\r\nof the Secretary-General aimed at improving its\r\nworking methods.\r\nIt is very important for the Security Council to\r\nfoster its relationships with the other main bodies of\r\nthe United Nations. It should not limit the presentation\r\nof its annual report only to the General Assembly.\r\nAdditionally, the Security Council should give the\r\nGeneral Assembly a special report in accordance with\r\nArticles 15 and 24 of the Charter, so that the two\r\nbodies will work more closely, including on issues\r\nrelated to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nIt is very important to promote the relationship of\r\nthe Security Council with the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and with the International Court of Justice\r\n(ICJ) by seeking the advisory opinions of the ICJ on\r\nmatters under consideration.\r\nThe Council should approach its responsibilities\r\nwith objectivity and neutrality and avoid double\r\nstandards and selectivity. It should not follow the\r\nwishes of those who want to use it to serve their own\r\npurposes. If transparency and democracy are the\r\ncriteria for determining the legitimacy of national\r\nGovernments, then that standard should also be applied\r\nto all the bodies of the United Nations, particularly the\r\nSecurity Council. Closed meetings among a select few\r\nmembers of the Council and without the knowledge of\r\nthe rest of its members is a practice that should be\r\nstopped completely. Silence vis-à-vis that practice\r\nimplies tacit consent to the practice of one State, or a\r\nfew States that are permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil, dominating the process of decision-making in\r\nthe Council. This increases public scepticism about the\r\nlegitimacy of Security Council resolutions and raises\r\nquestions as to whether or not this body really works\r\nfor the international community.\r\nThe Security Council should be urged to\r\napproach its responsibilities in accordance with the\r\nCharter, especially regarding the equitable geographic\r\n29\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nrepresentation of its membership. Annex 4 includes\r\nsome proposals by individual countries, as well as by\r\nregional groups such as the Non-Aligned Movement\r\nregarding expanding the membership of the Council.\r\nThere should also be complete sovereign equality\r\namong all States as applied to the enlargement of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe would prefer that this enlargement be\r\nrestricted to the non-permanent member category. We\r\ndo not need more permanent members to continue to\r\npropagate distinctions of inequality among the\r\nMembers of the United Nations.\r\nWe are against any proposal that is drafted in a\r\ndiscriminatory manner, such as one giving priority to\r\nthose who would take up more responsibility for the\r\nbudget of the Organization, or who have the capability\r\nof providing equipment and resources to peacekeeping\r\nforces. Such selectivity would have only one result \r\nthat of promoting the grip of the stronger and the richer\r\ncountries on the Security Council at the expense of the\r\nsmaller and poorer States, which constitute the\r\nmajority of the Members of the United Nations.\r\nIt is very essential in the process of increasing the\r\npermanent membership of the Council to apply the\r\nprinciple of equitable geographic representation, taking\r\ninto consideration the status of developing countries.\r\nAfrica does not have a permanent seat on the Security\r\nCouncil, despite the fact that it represents a third of the\r\nMembers of the Organization. This is an imbalance that\r\nshould be corrected. We should accept Africas\r\nlegitimate demand in accordance with that continents\r\n1997 Harare Summit, which calls for two permanent\r\nseats on the Council to be held on a rotating basis\r\naccording to criteria agreed by the African States.\r\nThe question of the veto privilege should be at\r\nthe core of the reform of the Security Council. It is not\r\nan exaggeration to say that this is one of the more\r\ncomplicated and more controversial issues being\r\ndebated  not just within the work of the Open-Ended\r\nWorking Group, but since the founding of this\r\nOrganization. The status quo in the Council is not\r\ncompatible with the principle of sovereign equality\r\namong all States as established in the Charter. It\r\ncontradicts the principle of justice, and undermines the\r\nprinciples of democracy. Many, including Libya, have\r\nsaid that the veto power is not used in the service of\r\ninternational peace and security, but rather in the\r\nservice of protecting the national interests of those who\r\nhave that privilege and of those allies that enjoy their\r\nprotection and escape punishment and condemnation\r\nby them. Meanwhile, there are those who flagrantly\r\nchallenge the power of the Security Council and reject\r\nthe implementation of its resolutions before one and\r\nall.\r\nThis proves the importance of putting an end to\r\nthe privilege of the veto power, or restricting its use to\r\nthe greatest extent possible. My delegation supports all\r\nproposals along those lines. We would like to\r\nemphasize that the use of the veto should be subject to\r\nthe ratification of at least two thirds of the Members of\r\nthe General Assembly. All these measures are attempts\r\nto put an end to that privilege. We believe that the\r\nreform of the Security Council will be meaningless if\r\nthis privilege is restricted to those who would use it for\r\ntheir own purposes.\r\nWe still insist and emphasize that any attempt to\r\nreform our Organization will not be successful or lead\r\nto positive results without comprehensive and\r\nintegrated reform of the Security Council; and this will\r\nhappen only with the cooperation of everyone. We\r\nhope that this spirit of cooperation will prevail in the\r\nwork of the Open-Ended Working Group, so that it will\r\nsucceed in reforming the Security Council in a manner\r\nthat reflects the principles and purposes of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations  by making the Council more\r\nrepresentative in its membership, clearer in its work,\r\nand more democratic in its decision-making process.\r\nMr. Sow (Guinea) (spoke in French): More than a\r\ndecade ago, we, the Member States of the United\r\nNations, started discussions to decide on ways and\r\nmeans that could improve the working methods of, and\r\nintroduce reforms into, the functioning of the Security\r\nCouncil  a body which under the Charter is\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. This imperative need proceeds both from\r\nchanges in the international situation, and from our\r\ncommon resolve to meet the many important\r\nchallenges we face.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea therefore appreciates the\r\nfact that this thematic debate is being held on questions\r\nrelating to the Security Council and we welcome this\r\nnew report, which covers its activities for the period of\r\nJune 2003 to July 2004. This present report of the\r\nSecurity Council is very timely, since it has appeared\r\non the eve of the sixtieth anniversary of our\r\nOrganization at a time when the international\r\n30\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\ncommunity is preparing to give new political impetus\r\nto the comprehensive reform process. My delegation\r\nnotes that the resolutions and decisions that were\r\nadopted over the past 12 months have moved several\r\npeace processes in the world forward, thanks to the\r\ncooperation among regional and subregional\r\nstakeholders.\r\nWe are pleased to note that Africa, more than\r\never before, is central to the work of the Security\r\nCouncil. As the report states, the situation in West\r\nAfrica has improved considerably. Central Africa\r\nseems to be stabilizing, thanks to the special attention\r\ngiven to the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo and to Burundi.\r\nWe are grateful to Ambassador Sir Emyr Jones\r\nParry of the United Kingdom for having introduced the\r\nreport of the Council (S/2004/2). We would also like to\r\nthank all the other members of the Council and the\r\nsupport staff for the high quality of the document, as\r\nwell as for the enormous sacrifices that they have\r\nmade.\r\nWe acknowledge  on the basis of our\r\nconsideration of the report  that the working methods\r\nof the Security Council have evolved significantly.\r\nThere are now many open meetings of the Council \r\none of the concerns expressed by Member States in\r\ntheir desire for transparency in the work of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nWhile the importance of private meetings  the\r\nbasic goal of which is to better discuss substantive and\r\noften very sensitive issues  is clear, several\r\ndelegations regret the way in which some decisions are\r\ntaken. In fact, some decisions are the result of partisan\r\ninterests, and that affects the way in which they are\r\nimplemented on the ground. In view of that situation,\r\nmy delegation firmly believes that new steps should be\r\ntaken to strengthen transparency, justice and\r\ndemocratic methods in order to make the decisions of\r\nthe Council more effective and to give them greater\r\nlegitimacy. We encourage all Member States to\r\ncontinue the discussion about the reform of the Council\r\nand related issues so that we can put an end to the\r\nperception of the Security Council as a body whose\r\nfunctioning is opaque. Unfortunately that leads to great\r\nfrustration, which could discredit the values embodied\r\nby the United Nations.\r\nIn that context, Africa adopted, in 1997, the\r\nHarare Declaration, which supported the principle of\r\nexpanding the Security Council on the basis of\r\nequitable regional representation and called for five\r\nnon-permanent and two permanent seats to be allocated\r\nto Africa.\r\nWe have taken note of the many suggestions\r\nmade during the consultative process at the fifty-eighth\r\nsession and throughout these discussions. My\r\ndelegation believes that the ability of a Member State\r\nto meet its obligations in the area of peacekeeping \r\nover and above financial considerations  depends\r\nprimarily on real political will, which requires a\r\nresolute and constant commitment to the cause of\r\npeace, security and stability.\r\nWe appeal for an orderly debate that begins, first\r\nand foremost, with general acceptance of the principle\r\nof equitable geographical representation and then\r\nproceeds to agreement on objective criteria for\r\nselecting Council members, followed by a decision\r\nabout how long they would serve and, finally, by\r\nagreement on conditions for the exercise of the veto.\r\nFinally, in order better to meet current challenges,\r\nMember States must overcome vested interests and\r\nmake it possible to implement reform in a speedy\r\nmanner in order to ensure a more representative, more\r\neffective Council.\r\nMy delegation is pleased about the cooperation\r\nthat exists between the Security Council and the\r\nregional organizations, particularly the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States and the African\r\nUnion. Such complementarity of action certainly helps\r\nto guarantee international peace and security.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to express the\r\nappreciation of the Government of Guinea for the\r\nSecurity Councils working visit to Conakry on 28 June\r\n2004 during its mission to West Africa. We hope that\r\nthe lessons learned will be instructive for future\r\nmissions. Field visits, which can provide useful\r\ninformation should be included, and sufficient time\r\nprovided so as to better assess a situation and ensure\r\nthat the message sent is not incomplete.\r\nMs. Bahemuka (Kenya): I would like to begin by\r\nrevisiting some obvious facts about the Security\r\nCouncil and its mandate. First, the Security Council\r\nwas established in 1945 to ensure prompt and effective\r\naction by the United Nations, particularly with regard\r\nto the maintenance of peace and security. The\r\ncircumstances then prevailing were very different from\r\nthose of today. Secondly, in 1965  20 years after the\r\n31\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\nestablishment of the Council  it was deemed\r\nnecessary to expand the Council to its current\r\ncomposition, following Assembly resolution 1991\r\n(XVIII) of 1963, which recommended an increase in\r\nmembership. Thirdly, in 1994  30 years after the\r\nonly expansion of the Council  States Members of\r\nthe United Nations agreed to the formation of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Related\r\nMatters, which, 10 years down the line  despite the\r\nimpetus occasioned by changed circumstances  has\r\nyet to achieve concrete, tangible results.\r\nThe time has come for a realistic approach to be\r\nadopted in dealing with issues related to the\r\nreconfiguration of the Security Council so as to enable\r\nit to meet new and evolving global challenges. With\r\nthe end of the cold war, it was expected that there\r\nwould be less conflict. On the contrary, conflicts have\r\nincreased and intensified. Furthermore, the theatre of\r\ncurrent conflicts is completely different from the one\r\nthat prevailed in 1945. Then, the world had just\r\nemerged from a large-scale war that pitted countries\r\nagainst one another. Currently, inter-State conflicts are\r\nminimal and have been replaced by a proliferation of\r\nintra-State conflicts that are small in scale but more\r\ndevastating in nature.\r\nIn the past two decades, the Councils reaction to\r\nconflict flare-ups in various parts of the world has been\r\nslow. More often than not, the Council has stood by as\r\nthe world has witnessed massive killings and untold\r\nhuman suffering, as in the case of Rwanda and\r\nYugoslavia. At times, the Council has been reduced to\r\nthe status of an observer with the less-than-honourable\r\ntask of counting the dead before timidly taking action.\r\nThe Charter refers to prompt and effective action in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nUnfortunately, that noble objective has yet to be\r\nachieved.\r\nMy delegation is endeavouring to envisage a\r\nSecurity Council that could forestall conflicts by\r\neffectively establishing a tangible early-warning\r\nmechanism  a system that would be dynamic and, at\r\nthe same time, foolproof. It would be a Security\r\nCouncil equipped with the necessary wherewithal to\r\nforestall and neutralize situations before they erupt into\r\nhumanitarian catastrophes. This can be made possible\r\nonly by the institutionalization of a well-financed\r\nCouncil that is able to effectively mobilize resources\r\nfrom Member States. The Council should also work\r\nclosely with regional security bodies to constantly\r\nmonitor the complex and diverse root causes of\r\nconflict. The Council should be able to seek the\r\nconcurrence of Member States for a waiver to institute\r\npre-emptive action whenever situations threaten\r\ninternational peace.\r\nAs has been stated, global circumstances have\r\nchanged. Threats to international peace and security\r\nhave also evolved. International crime and drug\r\nsyndicates, money-laundering, HIV/AIDS,\r\nunprecedented proliferation of small arms and light\r\nweapons and the danger posed by the possibility of\r\nweapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of\r\nnon-State actors, are but a few of the novel threats that\r\nrequire innovative approaches. Kenya would like to see\r\na Security Council that is proactive and that provides\r\nreports indicating how it intends to deal with these new\r\nthreats, should they escalate to threaten world peace.\r\nThis in itself would give the world reassurance and a\r\nsense of security. The routine annual and special\r\nreports of the Council do not adequately fulfil this\r\nneed.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group on the Question\r\nof Equitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council was established with a\r\nview to addressing disparities that exist within the\r\nCouncil. Progress was achieved during the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, during which, as in\r\nprevious sessions, the Working Group reached\r\nprovisional agreement on a large number of issues,\r\nalthough a divergence of views remained on others.\r\nThe majority of opinions expressed over the 10-year\r\nperiod have indicated the need for expansion.\r\nHowever, care should be taken to avoid expansion for\r\nthe sake of expansion. Much thought should be put into\r\nhow an expanded Security Council could most\r\neffectively and efficiently face the challenges of a\r\nrapidly changing world.\r\nSomalia has been without a Government for over\r\n14 years. Within the framework of the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development, Kenya\r\nhas been chairing the Somali reconciliation process.\r\nWe are delighted to note that on 10 October 2004 \r\njust two days ago  Somali delegates to the peace\r\nprocess elected their President, Mr. Abdullahi Yusuf\r\nAhmed, who will be inaugurated in Nairobi on\r\n14 October 2004. We congratulate the brave Somali\r\n32\r\nA/59/PV.27\r\npeople and call upon the Security Council to move\r\nquickly to support Somalia in the next phase in the\r\npeace process. This will entail disarming, demobilizing\r\nand reintegrating the militia to ensure peace and\r\nsecurity in Somalia and the region at large. We would\r\nalso like to urge the international community to\r\nsupport and recognize the new Government so as to\r\ngive it the legitimacy it rightly deserves.\r\nWith regard to the expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil, African heads of State and Government,\r\nthrough the Organization of African Unity Harare\r\nDeclaration of 1997, requested two permanent seats\r\nand five non-permanent seats on the Council. This\r\nposition has not changed. Kenya supports the position\r\nof the African Union and requests other States to\r\nrespect positions taken by regional bodies.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to state that my\r\ndelegation favours finalizing the work of the Working\r\nGroup and acting on the sentiments expressed by the\r\nmajority of Members. Kenya appreciates the difficult\r\ncircumstances under which the Security Council\r\nperforms its duties and lauds the Council for the\r\nachievements it has made over the years. We commend\r\nthe positive interactions and relations that have\r\nemerged between the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly. We believe, however, that a more\r\ntransparent, accountable and democratized Security\r\nCouncil with a universal approach to issues of\r\ninternational peace and security would be more\r\neffective, despite the prevailing circumstances. My\r\ndelegation hopes that after the report of the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change is discussed,\r\nMember States will rise up and have the courage to\r\npositively transform the Security Council, especially as\r\nwe look forward to commemorating the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.30 p.m.\r\n"
