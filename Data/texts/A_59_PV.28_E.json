(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 11.30 a.m.\r\nAgenda items 11 and 53 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/59/2)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters\r\nMr. Jenie (Indonesia): It is a pleasure for my\r\ndelegation to welcome the report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly, contained in\r\ndocument A/59/2, which provides a brief overview of\r\nthe Council’s activities in the past year in the area of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThis meeting is always a good opportunity for\r\nMember States to review the work of the Council, an\r\nassignment that we gladly look forward to. We\r\ntherefore thank the Council members for the report.\r\nMay I also welcome the report of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters related to the\r\nSecurity Council. I would like to express my\r\ndelegation’s appreciation to the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Julian Hunte, for his active role as\r\nChair of the Working Group and for his determined\r\nefforts to win common agreement on these issues.\r\nWe live in a constantly changing international\r\npolitical climate that challenges and tests the strength\r\nof our Organization. Over the past year, old threats and\r\nnew challenges have continued to grip many parts of\r\nthe world, directly affecting many of our Member\r\nStates. In this regard, my delegation would like to\r\ncomment on some of the important issues contained in\r\nthe report that have had such an impact.\r\nDespite the fact that the Council has regularly\r\nconsidered the situation in the Middle East, including\r\nthe Palestinian question, the situation on the ground\r\nhas not improved and, in fact, has worsened. The\r\nimplementation of the road map that envisions a\r\npermanent two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian\r\nconflict is far from becoming a reality. My delegation\r\nstill considers the road map as the feasible option, as\r\nlong as the relevant parties, particularly the Israeli side,\r\nshow genuine willingness to implement the plan.\r\nRegrettably, for the better part of the history of\r\nthe issue of Palestine, the Council has been prevented\r\nfrom adopting a just and balanced approach to the\r\nmatter. If permitted to do so, the Council could\r\npersuade Israel to withdraw its forces from the\r\noccupied territories and to cease settlement activities,\r\nin accordance with the relevant Council resolutions.\r\nThis is a critically important issue that could\r\njeopardize the credibility of the Council should it fail\r\nto ensure the implementation of its own resolutions.\r\nConcerning other events in the region, the Iraqi\r\nissue has been dominating the work of the Council\r\nduring the past year. In that regard, my delegation\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.28\r\nwelcomed the adoption of resolution 1546 (2004) on\r\nIraq that has returned sovereignty to the people of Iraq.\r\nUnfortunately, peace, security and stability remain\r\nmajor concerns there; increased violence has further\r\ndeprived ordinary Iraqis of a stable and peaceful\r\nenvironment in which to live.\r\nIndonesia reiterates its call for the United Nations\r\nto play a leading role, particularly in establishing\r\nappropriate conditions on the ground in Iraq in\r\npreparation for elections scheduled for January 2005.\r\nThere is no question that the United Nations has the\r\nbest credentials to assume this role to enable Member\r\nStates to participate in post-conflict peace-building and\r\nreconstruction efforts in Iraq. It is our strong hope that\r\nthe Council will be able to find innovative ways of\r\nachieving those objectives.\r\nTo create conditions for peace elsewhere, the\r\nSecurity Council has collaborated with regional\r\norganizations in pursuit of that multifaceted goal. We\r\ncommend the Council for this form of collaboration. In\r\nmany instances, these partnerships have proven fruitful\r\nin building and maintaining peace because of the\r\nintimate knowledge the organizations have of regional\r\nconflicts and their willingness to commit resources to\r\nsolve the conflicts efficiently. In order to make this\r\nendeavour a success, adequate resources and funding\r\nneed to be allocated at all times. It is my delegation’s\r\nbelief that this practice should be further enhanced and\r\nmore clearly defined, in accordance with Chapter VIII\r\nof the Charter that deals with such interaction.\r\nIn spite of known limitations, the value of these\r\nevolving partnerships is clearly demonstrated in Africa,\r\nwhere the Security Council has enlisted the support of\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States and\r\nthe African Union to help resolve several disputes. For\r\ninstance, the African Union is playing a key role in\r\nmediating the crisis in Darfur, the Sudan. Also, the\r\napplication of the African Union-supported Joint\r\nVerification Mechanism to the situation in the Congo\r\nhas also yielded positive results and should lead to a\r\npeaceful resolution of that crisis. Moreover, the\r\nCouncil has received recommendations from the Office\r\nof the Special Representative of the Secretary-General\r\nfor West Africa to help resolve conflict situations in\r\nthat subregion.\r\nWhile commending the work of the Council in\r\ncombating terrorism, we wish to emphasize that\r\ncooperation among Member countries to deal with this\r\nglobal threat is of paramount importance. On efforts to\r\ncurb the spread of weapons of mass destruction, permit\r\nme to express Indonesia’s concern over actions with\r\nlaw-making implications that have been taken by the\r\nSecurity Council to achieve the goals of non-\r\nproliferation and to counter terrorism. Despite our\r\nconcern about the liberal application of its powers\r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter in this regard,\r\nIndonesia is fully committed to the implementation of\r\nresolution 1540 (2004).\r\nIndonesia is also of the opinion that a strong and\r\nactive relationship between the Security Council and\r\nthe General Assembly is essential to the effectiveness\r\nof the United Nations. For this to succeed, there are\r\nsteps that need to be taken.\r\nFirst of all, the interaction between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council must, in the\r\ninterest of all Member States, be governed by\r\ntransparency. Towards that end, there must be\r\nincreased dialogue and exchange of information\r\nbetween both bodies, with the Council taking the\r\nwishes of the Assembly into consideration in its\r\ndecision-making process. This is critical, because the\r\nAssembly is an integral part of the system of collective\r\nsecurity established by the Charter. One way in which\r\nthe Council can keep a finger on the pulse of the\r\nAssembly is by convening more formal meetings on\r\nthe issues before it, thereby hearing the views of\r\ninterested parties before it makes decisions or adopts\r\nresolutions.\r\nSecondly, the Council should accept, as an article\r\nof faith, the necessity of regularly informing Member\r\nStates of the nature and scope of its activities and\r\ndeliberations. Towards further enriching its work, the\r\nCouncil must also provide the opportunity and means\r\nfor concerned Member States to communicate their\r\nviews to it. An important tool in that regard is\r\ninstitutionalized consultations between the Presidents\r\nof the Assembly and the Council.\r\nThirdly, about three years ago, the Council began\r\na series of month-end wrap-up sessions, reviewing the\r\nwork it had done during that period with non-members\r\nof the Council. Those sessions were widely hailed\r\nthroughout the Organization because of their great\r\nusefulness. Unfortunately, for nearly two years now,\r\nthe wrap-up sessions have not been held. In our view,\r\nsuch an important vehicle of communication between\r\nthe general membership and the Council — one in\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.28\r\nwhich the outgoing presidency directly accounts to\r\nMember States — should be resumed.\r\nMy delegation would like to point out that it is of\r\nthe greatest importance for the Charter-mandated\r\nresponsibilities of organs of the United Nations to be\r\nmaintained and respected, guaranteeing that the checks\r\nand balances of the Charter are not trampled upon.\r\nIndonesia reiterates its position that only a\r\ntransparent, democratic and representative Security\r\nCouncil, whose membership and practices reflect\r\ntwenty-first century realities, will be capable of\r\nguaranteeing the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, as stipulated by the United Nations\r\nCharter. We are strongly convinced that reform in that\r\nbody is required in order to bolster the legitimacy and\r\ncredibility of its decision-making processes.\r\nWe have to recognize that reform of the Security\r\nCouncil remains a key issue. While support for the\r\nenlargement of the membership of the Council is\r\nwidespread, there has been no consensus on how to go\r\nabout that reform. For 10 years, the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group has sought to resolve the issue, but the\r\nprospect remains uncertain.\r\nIn principle, reform of the Security Council\r\nshould be conducted comprehensively and reflect\r\ntoday’s geopolitical realities. Though my Government\r\nadvocates and supports the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil, it believes that its existing structure,\r\ncombining permanent membership with non-permanent\r\nmembership, should be retained, not set aside.\r\nIn that regard, the presence of Indonesia, as the\r\nworld’s largest moderate Muslim nation, should prove\r\nbeneficial to the deliberations of the Council. Its\r\npractice of pluralistic democracy, its experience in\r\nmediating conflicts and its vast contribution to various\r\npeacekeeping operations — whether in Cambodia, the\r\nsouthern Philippines, the Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia\r\nor Georgia — and its abiding commitment to\r\ninternational peace and understanding qualify it to\r\nassume such a role.\r\nFinally, we also look forward to receiving inputs\r\nfrom the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\r\nChange. However, reform of the United Nations should\r\nnot only be conducted in the context of Security\r\nCouncil; it must impact the entire United Nations\r\nsystem, as stipulated by the 2000 Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nMr. Danesh-Yazdi (Islamic Republic of Iran): I\r\nwish to join previous speakers in expressing my\r\nappreciation to the President of the Security Council,\r\nthe Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom,\r\nfor introducing the annual report of the Council to the\r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe report is indicative of the Security Council’s\r\nperformance and approach to issues of high\r\nsignificance and sensitivity that impact international\r\npeace and security. It not only provides an opportunity\r\nfor the general membership to get better acquainted\r\nwith the work of the Council, but also helps to\r\nmaintain and improve the relationship between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, as\r\nsuggested by the Charter. That relationship cannot\r\nremain healthy unless the views and concerns of the\r\nentire membership are duly noted and respected by the\r\nCouncil in discharging its important responsibilities.\r\nThe report of the Council deserves to be given\r\ncareful and due consideration in terms of both its\r\nformat and content. On the format, the present report\r\nhas been prepared in a concise, better focused and\r\nimproved manner, which in our view could be seen as\r\nan indication of the Council’s willingness to streamline\r\nand improve its method of work. We also note that, in\r\ndealing with a wide range of issues, the Security\r\nCouncil had an intense pace of activities during the\r\npast 12 months.\r\nIn the meantime, a significant number of\r\nmeasures were taken to improve transparency and\r\nopenness in the work of the Council. They include the\r\nimprovement of the format of the Council’s annual\r\nreport; holding more open meetings and open debates,\r\nas well as briefings for non-member States; and\r\nconsultations with regional groups. Undoubtedly, those\r\nare few but the right steps to bring about a positive\r\nimpact on the work of the Council and its relationship\r\nwith the wider United Nations membership. Indeed, a\r\ncloser link between the Council and the general\r\nmembership is imperative to enable the United Nations\r\nto address effectively the issues and crises that\r\nadversely impact international peace and security.\r\nThe positive trends in the working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council should not be restricted to certain\r\nareas. Transparency, openness and consistency are key\r\nelements that the Security Council should observe in\r\nall its activities and approaches. Sadly, the Council has\r\nappeared to neglect those important factors on\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.28\r\nnumerous occasions. In that respect, reference may be\r\nmade to such instances as the surprise scheduling of\r\nopen debates with selective notification, reluctance to\r\nconvene open debates on some issues of high\r\nsignificance, restricting participation in some of the\r\nopen debates, and discriminating between members\r\nand non-members of the Council as far as the sequence\r\nand time limits of statements during open debates are\r\nconcerned.\r\nA disturbing fact is the Council’s attempt to\r\ngradually encroach on the powers and mandate of the\r\nGeneral Assembly by addressing some issues,\r\nincluding through thematic debates, which traditionally\r\nfall within the competence of the General Assembly or\r\neven the Economic and Social Council; or its attempts\r\nto enter the areas of standard-setting and establishing\r\ndefinitions that fall within the legislative and standard-\r\nsetting purview of the General Assembly. Furthermore,\r\nin recent years, we have witnessed an increase in the\r\nnumber of subsidiary organs of the Security Council. It\r\nis therefore imperative that those subsidiary organs of\r\nthe Council work in a way in which the general\r\nmembership of the United Nations can receive\r\nadequate information on their role and functions.\r\nTo further increase the transparency of its work\r\nand improve its working methods, the Council should\r\nseriously take into consideration the relevant\r\nprovisions of the Charter and the resolutions that\r\nclarify its relationship with the General Assembly and\r\nother organs of the United Nations, especially\r\nresolution 58/126. Accordingly, rule 48 of the Security\r\nCouncil’s provisional rules of procedure, which calls\r\nfor the Council’s meetings to be held in public, should\r\nbe thoroughly observed; consequently, the closed\r\nmeetings and informal consultations should be kept to\r\na minimum, as the exceptions they were meant to be.\r\nThe prevailing state of affairs in international\r\nrelations points to formidable challenges that we all\r\nface. This situation has prompted the Council to resort\r\nquite often to Chapter VII of the Charter to deal with\r\ncertain incidents. However, a careful review of that\r\ntrend reminds us that the Council could have opted for\r\nalternative provisions to respond more appropriately to\r\nparticular cases. We therefore share the view that the\r\nSecurity Council, instead of resorting to excessive use\r\nof Chapter VII, should develop a mechanism to\r\ndetermine how the provisions of Chapters VI and VIII\r\nof the Charter can be fully utilized for the pacific\r\nsettlement of disputes and what role the Security\r\nCouncil, the Secretary-General and other United\r\nNations entities, as well as regional arrangements, can\r\nplay in resolving disputes and conflicts through\r\npeaceful means.\r\nFrom the substantive point of view, the report\r\ncovers a wide range of issues that were dealt with by\r\nthe Council during the period under consideration. I\r\nwill, however, confine my statement to a number of\r\nissues that are of great importance and sensitivity to\r\nmy country.\r\nOver the past 12 months, the situation in Iraq has\r\ndominated all regional and international developments\r\nand, accordingly, has featured prominently on the\r\nagenda of the Security Council. The adoption of five\r\nresolutions on the subject by the Council during that\r\nperiod is a clear indication of its determination to\r\naddress the question of Iraq. We welcome further\r\nUnited Nations involvement in Iraq and the\r\nenhancement of the pivotal role that this world body\r\ncan and should play in that country. We view the\r\nSecurity Council’s resolutions as forming a solid basis\r\nfor enabling Iraq to regain its full sovereignty and\r\npreserve its unity, political independence and territorial\r\nintegrity, particularly through the holding free and fair\r\nelections, as scheduled, and the speedy withdrawal of\r\nforeign forces from the country.\r\nIn Iran’s view, the United Nations in general and\r\nthe Security Council in particular must redouble their\r\nefforts and play a more proactive role in helping the\r\nIraqi people, at this crucial juncture, to move smoothly\r\nthrough the difficult process under way with a view to\r\nending their suffering.\r\nWe note that the situation in Afghanistan also\r\ncontinued to be regularly considered by the Council\r\nthroughout the period under review. The Council’s\r\ninitiative to send a mission to Afghanistan was a\r\npositive step in the right direction. We share the\r\nobservations made by the Council mission that the\r\npeace process and the political process in Afghanistan\r\nneed to be supported by the international community in\r\norder for security and stability to be restored there.\r\nThe Council’s decision to extend the mandates of\r\nthe international and United Nations missions in\r\nAfghanistan in order to help the Afghan authorities to\r\nsecure a healthy environment for free, fair and credible\r\nelections was praiseworthy. The recent massive turnout\r\nof the Afghan nation for the presidential election was a\r\npositive and welcome event which well illustrates that\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.28\r\nthe Afghans are willing and able to take their destiny in\r\ntheir own hands. It certainly marks the beginning of a\r\nnew era in the history of Afghanistan. Iran welcomes\r\nthat development. We will spare no effort to help the\r\nelected Government in Kabul to overcome the\r\nchallenges that the Afghan people face. We also\r\nbelieve that the United Nations has a huge\r\nresponsibility to play a more effective role in helping\r\nthe Afghan authorities to restore security and stability\r\nand to rebuild the country.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East, especially the\r\nPalestinian question, received the attention of the\r\nCouncil throughout the period under consideration. We\r\nnote that the Council continued to convene monthly\r\nmeetings at which members received briefings from the\r\nSecretary-General, his Personal Representative and\r\nSpecial Coordinator or other high-ranking Secretariat\r\nofficials on the situation in the Middle East. That\r\nundoubtedly helped Council members not to lose sight\r\nof the grave situation in that region. However, we are\r\nof the view that the Council was rendered ineffective\r\nand unable to address adequately the question of\r\nPalestine, despite the gravity of that issue.\r\nWe observed with dismay that, during the period\r\nunder review, attempts to adopt resolutions on the\r\nPalestinian issue in the Security Council were thwarted\r\nthree times, even though earlier relevant resolutions of\r\nthe Council were totally disregarded by Israel. In fact,\r\nthe Council’s approach on the Palestinian issue fell\r\nwell short of our expectations. No doubt the credibility\r\nof the Council will erode over time if it is habitually\r\nseen to be unable to meet its responsibilities with\r\nregard to outstanding issues on its agenda.\r\nAllow me now to briefly touch upon the\r\nimportant issue of the reform of the Security Council.\r\nThe membership of the United Nations has increased\r\nfrom 112 in 1963, when the Council was last enlarged,\r\nto 191 today. Indeed, the composition of the Security\r\nCouncil must be changed, principally to reflect the\r\nincreased membership of the countries of the world,\r\nparticularly of developing countries. Almost 11 years\r\nhave passed since the Working Group on the reform of\r\nthe Security Council began its deliberations on the\r\nissue. We note with appreciation the efforts made by\r\nthe Working Group, especially the important initiative\r\nof the Chairman, to stimulate an active discussion on\r\nsubstantive topics relating to the comprehensive reform\r\nof the Security Council.\r\nHowever, the debate that took place during the\r\ncourse of the previous session of the Working Group\r\nhas proved that despite some limited success in the\r\narea of work methods, significant progress has yet to\r\nbe made on substantive matters, such as the size and\r\ncomposition of the Council and the veto power.\r\nClearly, the impasse that is hindering the\r\nevolution of the reform is the result of the complex\r\nnature and the enormous importance of the issue.\r\nDespite the lack of progress on the main issues, we still\r\nbelieve that the process of the reform of the Council\r\nshould not be subject to any predetermined or\r\nsuperficial timetable, since any hasty decision would\r\nrun the risk of harming this very delicate process,\r\nwhich is of vital importance for and of great interest to\r\nthe entire membership of the United Nations. Because\r\nof the fact that the reform of the Council will have a\r\nfar-reaching impact for the whole world, every effort\r\nshould be made to reach the broadest possible\r\nagreement among Member States.\r\nAs to the objectives of the reform of the Council,\r\nwe continue to believe that the Council, as the body\r\nprimarily responsible for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, must become more\r\ndemocratic, more representative, more accountable and\r\nmore effective, in accordance with the provisions of\r\nthe Charter.\r\nThere are a number of options available to make\r\nthat a reality. Two approaches seem to enjoy the\r\ngreatest support among Member States. The first\r\nrelates to the ways and means of improving the\r\nworking procedure of the Security Council, and the\r\nsecond, to agreement on increasing the non-permanent\r\nmembership of the Council, pending general agreement\r\non the issue of increasing the number of permanent\r\nseats.\r\nUnder such circumstances — with developing\r\ncountries being more fairly represented on the Security\r\nCouncil and the question of the representation by more\r\nthan 1 billion Muslims being adequately addressed —\r\nthe democratization of the Security Council would gain\r\npace and, hopefully, lead to a genuine reconsideration\r\nof the most undemocratic practice in the Council, that\r\nis, the use of the veto. In that regard, the opinion of the\r\nvast majority of the States Members of the United\r\nNations, who continue to consider the use of veto to be\r\na discriminatory and undemocratic instrument in the\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.28\r\ndecision-making process of the Council, should be\r\nheeded.\r\nThe general support for limiting and curtailing\r\nthe use of the veto with a view to its eventual\r\nelimination needs to be explicitly reflected in the final\r\noutcome of the Working Group on the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council and, hopefully, in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General’s High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change.\r\nI would like to close by assuring you,\r\nMr. President, of our full cooperation on the important\r\nissue of the reform of the Security Council. We are\r\nconfident that, under your skilled and able stewardship,\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on Council reform will\r\nfunction successfully and will have a fruitful outcome.\r\nMr. Mavroyiannis (Cyprus): I would like, first,\r\nto thank the President of the Security Council, the\r\nPermanent Representative of the United Kingdom, for\r\nhaving introduced the report before us.\r\nWe have been considering the issue of United\r\nNations reform for years, and we have now reached the\r\npoint at which we have to contemplate the new face of\r\nthe United Nations in the twenty-first century. The\r\nreport of the High-level Panel, expected in less than\r\ntwo months, must fully take into account the views and\r\nideas of all and allow for a far-reaching approach that\r\nwill yield the desired results. I believe that the report\r\nof the Security Council to the General Assembly must\r\nbe viewed mainly from that perspective.\r\nIn that context, the report we have before us,\r\nhowever informative, nevertheless creates a feeling of\r\nuneasiness. The functioning of the United Nations\r\nsystem is not satisfactory, and the relationship between\r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council is not\r\nwhat it should be. The shift of attention from the\r\nAssembly to the Council is a symptom rather than a\r\nremedy. That shift could, in fact, be the last line of\r\ndefence against the erosion suffered by the United\r\nNations system in recent years and which has been\r\ngradually dethroning the Organization as the primary\r\ninstrument of contemporary international relations.\r\nAs we try to work towards effective\r\nmultilateralism that revolves around the United\r\nNations, it is of primary importance to restore, or to\r\nconstruct, a truly interactive dialogue between the two\r\nmain political organs of the Organization. Further\r\ntransparency and accountability are also required.\r\nThose attributes are even more crucial at a time when,\r\nbeyond any differences of opinion on functions and\r\ncompetences, we all realize the need for an integrated\r\napproach and for interdependence between the issues\r\ndealt with by the General Assembly and those\r\naddressed by the Security Council.\r\nI would also like to succinctly describe our own\r\ncontribution to the discussions aimed at reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, which is the most important\r\ninstrument at our disposal in the United Nations\r\nsystem, entrusted with the primary responsibility in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In the\r\nprocess of the ongoing deliberations, we must\r\nconsistently take into account that the outcome of such\r\nreform will indicate the level of the Security Council’s\r\neffectiveness and, concurrently, the level of its ability\r\nto execute its functions and powers, as enshrined in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nAs a small State whose primary source of\r\nprotection is the rule of law and strict adherence to\r\ninternational legality, Cyprus has always maintained\r\nthat the credibility and legitimacy of the Council must\r\nbe ensured, first, through broader and more equitable\r\nrepresentation of Member States in its composition;\r\nsecondly, by taking into account the realities and the\r\ncriteria embodied in Article 23, paragraph 1, of the\r\nCharter; and thirdly, through securing efficiency, both\r\nin the work of the Council and in the implementation\r\nof its resolutions.\r\nWe are supportive of a contemporary Security\r\nCouncil whose structure will adequately reflect the\r\ntremendous change in the global political reality since\r\nthe inception of the Organization and whose\r\ncomposition will comprise a more balanced\r\nrepresentation of all geographical groups. To that end,\r\nwe look forward to the report of the High-level Panel\r\nand to the recommendations of the Secretary-General,\r\nand we anticipate that Member States will rise to the\r\noccasion and seize the opportunity to pursue a strong\r\nfollow-up.\r\nIt must also be underlined that the concept of\r\nsecurity today is a multifaceted one and that it no\r\nlonger pertains only to traditional threats. It is\r\ntherefore imperative that we adopt an all-inclusive\r\napproach with the broadest possible perspective in\r\norder to combat security deficits, regardless of their\r\nnature.\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.28\r\nWe also believe that we should do more to\r\ninvolve troop-contributing countries in the\r\ndeliberations and that all major stakeholders must have\r\nample possibilities to adequately make their views\r\nknown, thus adding value to the decisions of the\r\nCouncil. Simultaneously, one should bear in mind,\r\nfirst, that the spirit and practice of effective\r\nmultilateralism must respect and uphold international\r\nlegality and protect individual and collective human\r\nrights; and secondly, that such multilateralism not only\r\nencompasses, but also derives from, the comprehension\r\nand consideration of local realities and particulars, on\r\nthe basis of which it must then proceed to formulate\r\nproposals.\r\nCyprus believes that the effort under way to\r\nreform the Security Council must be comprehensive\r\nand far-sighted. In the spirit of those principles and\r\nwith the aim of reinforcing the legitimacy and efficacy\r\nof the Council, we are supportive of increasing both its\r\npermanent and its non-permanent membership. In that\r\nrespect, we believe that the joint French-German\r\nposition on expansion of the Council could provide a\r\nbasis for meeting those requirements that will enable it\r\nto fulfil its role in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, always having as a priority the best\r\ninterests of the peoples whose security the Council is\r\nmandated to safeguard.\r\nMr. Clodumar (Nauru): The delegation of Nauru\r\njoins previous speakers in congratulating Ambassador\r\nSir Emyr Jones Parry of the United Kingdom, President\r\nof the Security Council, on his presentation of the\r\nannual report of the Security Council (A/59/2). My\r\ndelegation also takes this opportunity to thank the\r\nformer President of the General Assembly, The\r\nHonourable Julian Hunte, Foreign Minister of Saint\r\nLucia, and Ambassadors Luis Gallegos Chiriboga of\r\nEcuador and Christian Wenaweser of Liechtenstein for\r\ntheir good work in revamping our debate in the Open-\r\nended Working Group by focusing on the key elements\r\nin reform of the Security Council.\r\nThe Security Council, as noted in the report, has\r\nbeen seized with a wide range of issues, from civil\r\nconflicts in the African region to the consolidation of\r\npeace and security in the Asia-Pacific region —\r\nparticularly in our neighbourhood — to the\r\nrevitalization of the Counter-Terrorism Committee and\r\nthe strengthening of action against the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction through the adoption of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1540 (2004). We are\r\npleased to note the Council’s action in extending the\r\nUnited Nations Mission of Support in East Timor to\r\n20 May 2005 and the United Nations Observer Mission\r\nin Bougainville to 31 December 2004. Those two\r\nMissions have been success stories for the Council and\r\nfor the United Nations as a whole, and it would be a\r\ngreat pity if the decision to end those two operations\r\nwere premised on saving money when millions of\r\ndollars continue to be poured into other conflict\r\nregions. The premature termination of missions before\r\nreal peace and economic development has taken root\r\ncould lead and has led to breakdowns in the peace\r\nprocess, as we have seen recently in Côte d’Ivoire and\r\nHaiti.\r\nThe failure of Israel and Palestine to come to the\r\npeace table by way of fulfilling their obligations under\r\nthe road map, in cooperation with the Quartet, has\r\ncontinued to bring senseless misery to their peoples. In\r\nour view, the failure of the Security Council to adopt\r\nresolutions to address breaches of international law and\r\nof the Council’s own resolutions has exacerbated the\r\nsituation, as a divided Council is powerless. That\r\nsituation should be corrected, as it could and would\r\nsend a signal to the parties to the conflict that their\r\nactions and counter-actions are being condoned.\r\nIraq and Afghanistan have featured prominently\r\nin the Council’s work over the past 12 months. The\r\npaths that brought them to the refuge of the Council\r\nwere different, and that is being reflected in the manner\r\nin which peace and security and democracy are being\r\nachieved in those two countries.\r\nNauru is pleased to see the Council reaffirm its\r\nsupport on the solution to the question on the self-\r\ndetermination of the people of Western Sahara by\r\nresolution 1541 (2004). However, it should do more to\r\nbring the process to closure so that the people of\r\nWestern Sahara can enjoy freedom and economic and\r\nsocial development through the right to their resources\r\nand land.\r\nNauru has submitted two reports to the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee but is late in submitting the third\r\nreport. The main reason for that is the lack of capacity\r\nin our country to generate the necessary legislation and\r\nother actions required under Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001). The requirements under\r\nresolution 1540 (2004) have made the work more\r\narduous. To that end, the question of joint reporting by\r\nthe Pacific Island countries through our regional Forum\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.28\r\nis being evaluated, and it is our sincere hope that the\r\nproposal will be entertained by the Council when it is\r\nformally brought to it for consideration.\r\nUnder the 2000 Biketawa Declaration, the Pacific\r\nIsland Forum has made significant efforts in enhancing\r\npeace and security in the region among which the most\r\nnoteworthy is the Regional Assistance Mission to\r\nSolomon Islands (RAMSI). The Forum is currently\r\nevaluating what assistance it could offer Nauru to\r\nensure that the current economic and social situation\r\ndoes not give rise to instability and security problems.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations and the Council\r\nshould look at that model as another way to support the\r\nCouncil in maintaining peace and security in conflict\r\nregions.\r\nReforming the Security Council has been a\r\nfundamental part of United Nations politics for\r\ndecades. While we all agree on the idea of increasing\r\nthe membership of the Council in order better to reflect\r\nthe membership of our Organization, so far, the only\r\nconsensus among us on this issue is that the process\r\nwill be arduous because of the different approaches\r\nthat delegations have. Despite the complexities of this\r\nissue, we have seen, through our work on cluster II,\r\nthat good progress has already been made towards\r\nmaking the work of the Security Council more\r\ntransparent.\r\nWe recognize the inextricable linkage between\r\nthe question of the veto and the question of Security\r\nCouncil expansion. However, we believe that the signal\r\nwe have from the permanent members of the Council,\r\nwhose support is essential, is that they could entertain\r\nthe question of expanding the membership of both\r\ncategories, but we have not heard anything positive —\r\nor anything at all — about fiddling with the veto\r\npower. Therefore, to us this is a no-go zone, and to\r\ninsist on dealing with this issue in conjunction with the\r\nexpansion suggests ulterior motives. Despite the major\r\nobstacles before us, work should continue in\r\ndeveloping a good framework for the reform process to\r\nmove forward.\r\nOn the issue of the expansion of the Council’s\r\nmembership, my delegation reaffirms its support for\r\nthe expansion of both the permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories of the Council. My delegation\r\nbelieves that countries that are willing and able to\r\nmake a meaningful and effective contribution to\r\nmaintaining world peace should be considered for\r\npermanent membership. To that end my delegation\r\nsupports the aspirations of Germany, Japan and India\r\nfor permanent membership.\r\nFinally, our effort on the question of Security\r\nCouncil reform is going to be complemented and,\r\nhopefully, reinforced by the work being undertaken by\r\nthe High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\r\nChange. The report of the Panel will be submitted by\r\nthe Secretary-General at the end of this year, and we\r\nlook forward to participating in the deliberations on the\r\nreport.\r\nMr. Goonatilleke (Sri Lanka): Over the years,\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group has considered various\r\nissues involving the reform of the Security Council.\r\nAmong those issues are size, the question of\r\ngeographical representation, criteria for membership,\r\nthe relationship between the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council, accountability and the use of the veto\r\nby permanent members of the Council. We welcome\r\nthe progress made so far by the Working Group and its\r\nreport to the General Assembly.\r\nThe negotiations that began a decade ago have\r\nmade it possible for the Working Group to gather\r\nconsiderable amount of information on the\r\nrationalization to be undertaken. During the course of\r\nits work, various formulas have been presented by\r\ninterested delegations and groups to the Working\r\nGroup. However, despite the initiative taken by the\r\nChairman to stimulate discussion during the fifty-\r\neighth session, thus far no finality has been reached on\r\nany of the issues. Consequently, the Working Group\r\nwill have to continue its deliberations well into the\r\nfifty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\r\nDuring this year’s general debate, more than 140\r\nMember States focused on specific areas of Security\r\nCouncil reform, including its ideal size, the question of\r\nregional representation and related matters. In\r\nconsidering the size of the Council, we must take into\r\naccount the current membership of the United Nations\r\nin comparison to the 112 members that comprised the\r\nOrganization in 1963, when the Council was enlarged\r\nto 15 members.\r\nBearing in mind the crucial role of the Security\r\nCouncil in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, as well as the binding nature of its resolutions,\r\nit is widely accepted that the Council should be\r\nexpanded to represent the geopolitical realities of the\r\nday, and not those that existed some 60 years ago.\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.28\r\nIn that regard, much has been said about the\r\nefficiency and the effectiveness of an expanded\r\nCouncil. While there is reason to accept that the\r\nCouncil should not be expanded to the extent that it\r\nbecomes unwieldy, we have to admit that efficiency\r\nand effectiveness of the Council cannot be ensured by\r\nlimiting its size while ignoring the reality on the\r\nground. Those and other concerns should be addressed\r\nby introducing measures to improve the working\r\nmethods of the Council.\r\nMy delegation agrees that the expansion should\r\nreflect the principle of equitable geographical\r\ndistribution. Among other issues, due consideration\r\nshould be given to the Council’s lack of representation\r\nof developing countries, which represent the vast\r\nmajority of the United Nations membership. Sri Lanka\r\nshares the view expressed by many delegations at the\r\ncurrent session that the expansion of the Council\r\nshould be in respect of both the permanent and the\r\nnon-permanent categories and that this exercise should\r\nbe undertaken in such a manner that it makes the\r\nCouncil truly representative of the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to quote from the\r\nstatement made at the Assembly’s 3rd meeting on\r\n21 September, by Her Excellency Chandrika\r\nBandaranaike Kumaratunga, President of Sri Lanka,\r\nregarding the expression of interest by Brazil,\r\nGermany, India and Japan in permanent membership\r\non an expanded Security Council:\r\n“Sri Lanka supports their candidatures, as they\r\ncomply with the objective criteria applicable to\r\nthe expansion of the permanent membership of\r\nthe Security Council. Sri Lanka would also wish\r\nto see a consensus emerge on the permanent\r\nrepresentation of Africa in the Security Council.\r\nAfrica must be included in a final determination\r\non the future composition of the Security\r\nCouncil. It is hoped that the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup will continue to exert efforts to resolve all\r\noutstanding issues expeditiously.”\r\nFrom the point of view of the great majority of\r\nthe membership, among the issues the Working Group\r\nneeds to address is the relationship between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council.\r\nGiven the importance of the responsibilities\r\nentrusted to the Security Council by the United Nations\r\nCharter and the limited membership of the Council in\r\nrelation to that of the United Nations, it is evident that\r\nthere should be a closer working relationship between\r\nthe two branches of the Organization. It has been\r\nargued that, by paragraph 1 of Article 24, Member\r\nStates have conferred on the Council primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security and that the Council acts on behalf\r\nof the entire membership of the Organization. It is in\r\nthat context that most delegations have urged that that\r\nrelationship should be enhanced and that the Council\r\nshould increase the accountability and transparency of\r\nits work.\r\nWe fully understand the difficulty of resolving\r\nthese issues, taking into consideration the numerous\r\nviews and proposals that have been presented to the\r\nWorking Group. On the basis of the interest displayed\r\nby members in resolving the issue of expansion, the\r\nWorking Group has to decide whether issues should be\r\naddressed in a piecemeal fashion or if it should come\r\nup with comprehensive proposals involving all issues\r\nunder discussion.\r\nAs we are aware, the Working Group has been\r\nlabouring to fulfil its mandate for over a decade. Given\r\nthe length of time we have been involved in this\r\nexercise and the urgency of reaching final decisions, it\r\nis important for the Working Group to present a\r\ncomprehensive set of recommendations for\r\nconsideration by the General Assembly. Moreover, we\r\nbelieve that the Working Group should decide on a\r\ntime frame within which it would submit its\r\nrecommendations.\r\nFinally, a large number of those delegations that\r\ntook the floor during the general debate last month also\r\nreferred to the work currently undertaken by the High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change,\r\nappointed by the Secretary-General, whose report is to\r\nbe issued in December. My delegation hopes that the\r\nreport will also give new momentum to the work\r\nundertaken by the Working Group in regard to\r\nreforming the Security Council. At the same time, Sri\r\nLanka expects that sufficient time and opportunity will\r\nbe available to the Member States to carefully study,\r\ndiscuss and reach conclusions prior to deciding on the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations of the Panel.\r\nMr. Sopoaga (Tuvalu): On behalf of the\r\ndelegation of Tuvalu, I would like first to thank the\r\nSecurity Council and the Secretariat for the work they\r\nhave done to prepare the report before us. Tuvalu also\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.28\r\nappreciates the work of the Security Council in its\r\nendeavours to maintain to international peace and\r\nsecurity over the past years. We acknowledge in\r\nparticular the support of the Security Council in efforts\r\nto restore peace to, among others, the people of\r\nBougainville, Papua New Guinea, in the Pacific region.\r\nDespite our being new to the United Nations, we\r\nobserve with great anxiety the growing challenges and\r\nthreats confronting the security environment. The\r\ninternational fight against terrorism and alleged\r\nweapons of mass destruction, the consequences of wars\r\nin Afghanistan and in Iraq, and civil unrest in the\r\nMiddle East and parts of Africa clearly underscore the\r\ncomplex nature of the work of the Security Council.\r\nThey also clearly underscore the urgent need for\r\nappropriate reforms to be made in the United Nations\r\nto ensure a more efficient and responsive Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nTuvalu therefore welcomes the ongoing efforts to\r\nreform the Security Council, as highlighted in the\r\nreport before us. The efforts of the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session, Mr. Julian\r\nHunte, to revitalize the work of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group established to consider aspects of\r\nSecurity Council reform are commendable. However,\r\nwe feel that those efforts will be in vain unless the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group is properly enabled to\r\ncomplete its task as required.\r\nTuvalu supports the importance of wider\r\nconsultations on security issues through relevant\r\navenues, particularly through opportunities for public\r\ndebate in the Security Council and the work of the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee. The reporting\r\nrequirements of the latter, however, should be\r\naccompanied by assistance, in the form of national and\r\nregional measures, especially to countries with the\r\nleast capacity to cope with such requirements, such as\r\nTuvalu.\r\nFor Tuvalu and many small island developing\r\nStates, security should be seen in its multidimensional\r\nnature. Our national security is threatened by\r\nenvironmental degradation emanating from outside the\r\ncountry. Here I refer specifically to the environmental\r\nimpact of climate change and sea-level rise and to the\r\nloss of biological diversity. The impact of climate\r\nchange has the potential to threaten the survival of our\r\nentire nation. As a result, we firmly believe — and I\r\nam sure that many vulnerable island developing\r\ncountries share my sentiments — that those\r\nenvironmental concerns should be part of the reform\r\nagenda of the Security Council. This, in essence, is\r\nwidely accepted, including in the Millennium Summit\r\nDeclaration and elsewhere in the context of the United\r\nNations. It therefore warrants intensifying the efforts of\r\nall Member States to achieve comprehensive reform in\r\nthe Security Council. Indeed, in view of Tuvalu’s\r\nunique, extreme vulnerability — which it shares with\r\nmany small island developing States — to external\r\nforces including terrorism and environmental\r\ndegradation, we fully support that view.\r\nAs stated by the Prime Minister of Tuvalu during\r\nthe general debate this year, it is our strong belief that,\r\nto maintain its legitimacy and relevance to all, the\r\nUnited Nations needs to reassess its role and its\r\nfunctions so as to better reflect the reality of today’s\r\nworld to ensure equitable participation and\r\nrepresentation in its main bodies.\r\nIt must be emphasized that the primary role and\r\nresponsibility of the Security Council with respect to\r\nthe promotion and maintenance of international peace\r\nand security is crucial to everyone. To weak and\r\nvulnerable Member States such as Tuvalu, it is critical\r\nto ensuring their very survival.\r\nIn that respect, the issue of enlarging the\r\nmembership of the Council is a vital one. Given that\r\nthe United Nations now has 191 Members and that the\r\nmembership of the Security Council has increased only\r\nonce, in 1965, from 11 to 15, Tuvalu shares the view\r\nthat the restructuring of the Security Council should\r\nfirst and foremost address the issue of membership in\r\nthe Council, consistent with the principles of\r\ndemocracy and transparency, and also to bring about\r\nequitable representation of all regions on the globe,\r\nparticularly the developing countries and small island\r\ndeveloping States, in this vital organ of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn that vein, Tuvalu supports an increase in the\r\nnumber of both permanent and non-permanent seats in\r\nthe Security Council. We believe Japan deserves a\r\npermanent seat, in view of its substantial contribution\r\nto international development, peace and security. We\r\nalso believe that Germany, India and Brazil are also\r\nvery appropriate candidates, for similar reasons.\r\nFinally, but most importantly, we firmly believe\r\nthat, in view of their extreme vulnerability to external\r\nforces — as recognized, as a special case, at the Rio\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.28\r\nSummit and in all other international development\r\nagreements — small island developing States should\r\nalso be considered for permanent representation in the\r\nSecurity Council. That would make the Security\r\nCouncil and the United Nations truly universal and\r\ndemocratic.\r\nMs. Pęksa-Krawiec (Poland): As has been stated\r\nby many previous speakers, we all await the results of\r\nthe deliberations of the Secretary-General’s High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change. We hope\r\nthat the Panel’s recommendations will give us new\r\nimpetus to look from a different perspective at the\r\npossible ways the international community should\r\nanswer the new threats and challenges.\r\nPoland, as one of the main proponents of the idea\r\nof establishing the Panel, definitely has great\r\nexpectations as to the results of its works. At the same\r\ntime, however, we are realists and we know that the\r\nPanel cannot find the cure to everything or present us\r\nwith detailed solutions in every aspect of reform.\r\nTherefore, in assisting the Panel, each of us should\r\ncontinue searching for ways to improve the work of the\r\nUnited Nations system in order to make it more\r\nreliable and effective. We all have responsibilities in\r\nthat regard and we cannot believe that maintaining the\r\nstatus quo for another 10 years, just because we are\r\nafraid to fail, is really the best way to proceed.\r\nIn the Polish view, it is the word “responsibility”\r\nthat should guide our deliberations on the needed\r\nchanges in the United Nations system, including those\r\nof the Security Council. Since the performance of the\r\nCouncil is central to the effectiveness of the United\r\nNations, both the Council’s members and the entire\r\nUnited Nations membership have the responsibility to\r\nstrengthen its role and legitimacy.\r\nI thank Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, the President of the Security Council,\r\nfor his presentation of the Council’s annual report. Let\r\nme just mention three aspects in that regard: the\r\nobligations of the Council in the process of making and\r\nexecuting decisions; the responsibilities of Council\r\nmembers; and the responsibilities of the whole\r\nmembership regarding the reform of the Organization.\r\nDuring the general debate, Polish Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, elaborating\r\non the Polish initiative of adopting a new political act\r\nfor the United Nations, stated that the gap between the\r\nmandating and the implementing functions of the\r\nUnited Nations is too wide.\r\nTherefore, we believe that it is the responsibility\r\nof the members of the Security Council to take the lead\r\nin providing political and material support for the\r\nimplementation of the Security Council’s decisions.\r\nThe credibility of the Council can be ensured only\r\nwhen its decisions are taken in a transparent way, with\r\nthe involvement of the broader membership. The\r\ncomplexity of the new threats and challenges to\r\ninternational security makes it necessary to establish\r\nbetter coordination between the Security Council, the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, both in the day-to-day work of those organs\r\nand in longer-term planning.\r\nThe leading role of the Council should also be\r\nseen in the process of promoting closer cooperation\r\nwith the troop-contributing countries. The established\r\nmechanisms of consultation still need improvement,\r\nespecially when it comes to substance. The troop-\r\ncontributing countries should be given more influence\r\nin the process of the creation of missions and in the\r\nelaboration of their mandates. They should also be\r\nbetter involved in the assessment of ongoing operations\r\nand the situation on the ground and in ways to improve\r\nit.\r\nA new mechanism for discussions with groups of\r\ninterested States or actors concerning any given crisis\r\nsituation should also be taken into consideration. While\r\npreserving the rule of transparency, such meetings of\r\nthe Council should have a rather informal format to\r\nallow partners honestly and in depth to assess problems\r\nand to elaborate ways to deal with them. While open\r\ndebates of the Council are still needed and certainly\r\nhave great value, informal meetings could help to\r\nresolve problems and in deciding about the needed\r\ntools.\r\nCooperation with regional organizations,\r\nespecially those involved in the implementation of\r\nCouncil resolutions, is yet another tool that needs to be\r\nfurther enhanced. As in the case of the secretariats of\r\nthose organizations and the United Nations Secretariat,\r\nthere is a also vital need in the Council to establish\r\ngenuine working, problem-oriented relations with other\r\ninstitutions that would complement the formal\r\nexchanges of letters and structured debates.\r\nAs to decision-making, the most discussed\r\nproblem is still the question of the veto power. We are\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.28\r\nnot calling for that prerogative of the permanent\r\nmembers to be abandoned at this moment, but we are\r\nof the opinion that it has to be used in a responsible\r\nway and only when there is a need to protect\r\ninternational law, the principles of the Charter or the\r\nwider United Nations membership, but not the\r\nparticular interests of countries.\r\nAs to the second aspect, the Republic of Poland\r\nbelieves that Security Council reform should be built\r\non the assumption that being a member not only grants\r\nadditional privileges, but also increases\r\nresponsibilities. Therefore, while discussing the issue\r\nof the expansion of Security Council membership, we\r\nhave to remember that the key to a more effective and\r\nlegitimate Security Council does not lie in the number\r\nof its members, but rather in their qualities and their\r\ntrue resolve to act in the common interest.\r\nPoland’s position on the question of Council\r\nenlargement remains the same. We are of the opinion\r\nthat an enlarged United Nations needs a bigger, more\r\nrepresentative and democratic Security Council.\r\nTherefore, we support changes in both categories of\r\nmembership. We recognize the readiness of two\r\ncountries, Germany and Japan, to contribute on a larger\r\nscale to peace and security and to take upon themselves\r\nthe responsibilities of the permanent members of the\r\nCouncil. We also share the opinion that other major\r\ncontributors from Asia, Africa and South America\r\nshould find permanent seats in the Council.\r\nAt the same time, the group of non-permanent\r\nmembers should be enlarged in a way that will reflect\r\nthe changes in the regional groups. In that context, let\r\nme recall the justified position of the Eastern European\r\nGroup to be better represented in the Council. The\r\nEastern European Group has more then doubled its\r\nmembership since it was created. The unique history of\r\nits members; their recent experience dealing with many\r\nkinds of conflicts and overcoming various threats; and\r\nthe Group’s growing role in conflict prevention,\r\npeacekeeping and, recently, development assistance\r\ngive it not only the right to be better represented, but\r\nalso the obligation to use its experience in the work of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nLet me conclude with my third remark. The\r\nnumber of delegations that have decided to speak on\r\nthis agenda item illustrates how important the issue of\r\nSecurity Council reform is to the Members of the\r\nUnited Nations. We all recognize that, like the United\r\nNations as a whole, the Council has to change and\r\nadapt to be better able to face contemporary\r\nchallenges. But we have to treat the reform of the\r\nCouncil with responsibility, not emotion. We have to\r\naddress the subject as just one of the elements of the\r\ncomprehensive adaptation of the United Nations\r\nsystem to the current international environment. We\r\ncannot allow ourselves to make that long-awaited\r\nadaptation and change to become a hostage to\r\nparticular interests, which, while undoubtedly\r\nimportant and urgent, are just a part of the whole\r\npicture.\r\nMr. Adechi (Benin) (spoke in French): In the\r\nperiod covered by its report, the Security Council faced\r\nmajor challenges calling for the adoption of bold\r\ndecisions. Delegations to the Council made every effort\r\nto analyse situations involved on the basis of the highly\r\nenlightening reports submitted to them by the\r\nSecretary-General. Thus, the Council was able to forge\r\nthe consensus necessary for action on most of the\r\nissues before it, although the use of the veto in some\r\ncases paralysed it and revealed its limitations, notably\r\nwith respect to the situation in the Middle East.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the sustained attention\r\nthat the Security Council has paid to the problems of\r\nthe African continent. We call on the stakeholders in\r\nthe various critical African situations before the\r\nCouncil to spare no pains to accelerate their settlement\r\nso that the continent may devote its resources to\r\npromoting sustainable development in the context of\r\nthe implementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment. We welcome the ongoing mobilization\r\nof the Council to settle the humanitarian crisis in\r\nDarfur and the situations in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire and elsewhere.\r\nI wish to draw attention to the Security Council\r\nmission to West Africa last June, which enabled the\r\nCouncil to send the parties on the ground the clear\r\nmessage that they must forge solid consensus at the\r\nlocal level in order to make progress on resolving\r\nsituations before the Council. I also underline the\r\nSecurity Council’s expanding interaction with the\r\nAfrican Union and subregional organizations.\r\nConflicts on other continents are moving towards\r\nthe restoration of peace and stability. The exception is\r\nthe situation in the Middle East, in particular the\r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict and the situation in Iraq,\r\nwhere uncontrolled violence prevails and where the\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.28\r\nheavy loss of life continues to bring grief to\r\nhumankind, with no end in sight.\r\nThe Council has made great efforts to combat\r\nterrorism, as demonstrated by the report on the\r\nrevitalization of the Counter-Terrorism Committee\r\n(S/2004/124) and the creation of the Counter-Terrorism\r\nExecutive Directorate, as well as the Council’s\r\nunanimous adoption last week of resolution 1566\r\n(2004), which reaffirms that there can be no\r\njustification for terrorist acts against civilians.\r\nThe Security Council’s consideration of questions\r\nthat clearly affect international peace and security is\r\nanother important part of its activities. We believe that\r\nthe thematic debates are very useful as they enable the\r\nCouncil to anticipate challenges and allow States not\r\nmembers of the Council to participate in the search for\r\nsolutions.\r\nWith respect to the Council itself and its working\r\nmethods, I stress the need speedily to reach consensus\r\non Council reform, in particular on the increase in\r\nCouncil membership. It is fortunate that during the\r\ngeneral debate most Member States reaffirmed their\r\ndesire to make the Security Council more\r\nrepresentative of the entire international community,\r\ngiven that the international situation has changed\r\nconsiderably, that the number of Member States has\r\ngrown from 51 to 191 since the creation of the United\r\nNations and that new States possess a certain weight in\r\ndemographic, economic and military terms.\r\nBenin’s position on this important question is in\r\nalignment with that of the Non-Aligned Movement and\r\nthe African Union. Benin believes that United Nations\r\nreform, in particular Security Council reform, will\r\nstrengthen the Organization’s universality and its\r\nability to contribute effectively to the realization of the\r\npurposes enshrined in the Charter, notably the\r\npromotion of economic development and the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nBenin believes that any Security Council reform\r\nmust take into account the legitimate aspirations of the\r\ndeveloping countries, in particular the African\r\ncountries, while preserving the Council’s effectiveness\r\nand proper functioning.\r\nBenin has no objection to the candidacy of the\r\nfriendly countries of Japan, Germany and Brazil as\r\npermanent members of the Security Council. However,\r\nthe scope, the nature and the modalities of the increase\r\nin the Council’s membership should be founded on the\r\nprinciples of the sovereign equality of States and\r\nequitable geographic distribution in order to ensure the\r\neffective representation of the various regions,\r\naccording to arrangements they decide upon among\r\nthemselves. To be clear, there cannot be a partial or\r\nselective increase in the number of permanent and non-\r\npermanent Council members that disadvantages the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nIn that context, Africa, like each other regional\r\ngroup, should have two permanent seats on the\r\nSecurity Council. Any other solution would cause a de\r\nfacto imbalance and the overrepresentation of one\r\nregional group to the detriment of the others. In other\r\nwords, Africa is justly calling for two permanent and\r\ntwo non-permanent seats in addition to the three it now\r\nholds.\r\nBenin believes that the veto power should be\r\nextended to new permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil. Moreover, non-permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council should be granted the veto power, in\r\nrotation, during the month they hold the presidency of\r\nthe Security Council, given the  important role of the\r\ncountry holding the presidency and its political\r\nresponsibility for Council decisions taken under its\r\npresidency.\r\nWith that in mind, Benin awaits with great\r\ninterest the report of the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenge and Change established by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to consider the challenges and threats\r\nconfronting the world today and the changes that the\r\nUnited Nations must make to respond to them. My\r\ncountry will actively participate in the consideration of\r\nthe Panel’s conclusions in order to make the best use of\r\nthem for the Organization’s future and for all\r\nhumankind.\r\nMr. Vohidov (Uzbekistan) (spoke in Russian):\r\nThe changes that have taken place in the international\r\nsituation are compelling an increasing number of\r\ncountries to review their vision of the status and the\r\nrole of the United Nations and to revisit the question of\r\nhow to reform the United Nations to enable it to\r\nrespond more effectively to the challenges facing the\r\ninternational community.\r\nUzbekistan believes that the United Nations\r\nshould remain the main component of the architecture\r\nfor global security and collective international\r\ncooperation. The Organization’s effectiveness depends\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.28\r\ndirectly on our collective efforts to reform it. In that\r\ncontext, we should note that in the process of\r\nreforming the United Nations, we should ensure that\r\nthe practical work of all its organs is focused on issues\r\nof truly high priority. The United Nations is faced with\r\nthe challenge of adapting its mechanisms to new\r\ninternational realities.\r\nIn that connection, given the fact that new threats\r\nand challenges to international peace and security have\r\nappeared on the world scene, there is an urgent need to\r\nspeed up the reform and the reorganization of the\r\nOrganization, particularly of the Security Council. In\r\nthat context, we believe it is important that reform of\r\nthe Security Council enhance its role, authority and\r\neffectiveness. In the light of the events that have\r\noccurred with respect to the Iraqi crisis, the Council\r\nshould work to restore the trust of the international\r\ncommunity and demonstrate that it is able effectively\r\nto resolve the most difficult challenges before it. The\r\nCouncil must be able to respond appropriately to new\r\nchallenges and threats. The Council’s powers and\r\nmeans to prevent conflict should be enhanced by\r\ncreating an operational mechanism giving the Council\r\nthe right to use pre-emptive enforcement action.\r\nUzbekistan favours expanding both categories of\r\nmembership of the Council according to the political\r\nand economic potential of countries and on the basis of\r\nequitable geographic representation and other criteria.\r\nBut an increase in any category of Council membership\r\nshould include representation of both developed and\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nWe reaffirm that we view Japan and Germany as\r\ncredible, worthy candidates for permanent membership\r\nof the Security Council. However, I should note that\r\nincreasing the membership of the Council should not\r\nbe an end in itself and must not reduce the Council’s\r\neffectiveness, thus jeopardizing the effectiveness of the\r\nCouncil’s work. We believe that the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters related to the\r\nSecurity Council should continue to consider all\r\nrelevant issues, fully taking into account their political\r\nand practical importance for both the future Security\r\nCouncil and the United Nations as a whole.\r\nLike all Members of the United Nations,\r\nUzbekistan also hopes that the recommendations of\r\nreport of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges\r\nand Change, to be issued in December of this year, will\r\nopen up new prospects for truly enhancing the\r\neffectiveness of the Organization.\r\nMr. Al-Najem (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nthank the President of the Security Council, Sir Emyr\r\nJones Parry, Permanent Representative of the United\r\nKingdom, for his clear presentation of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council (A/59/2) to the General Assembly.\r\nI also wish to hail the improvements made in the\r\nmethods of work and procedures of the Security\r\nCouncil and to thank members of the Council who\r\nkeep non-members regularly apprised of the Council’s\r\ndeliberations, thus contributing to transparency. I wish\r\nfurther to express our deep thanks to the former\r\nChairman and Vice-Chairmen of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters Related to the\r\nSecurity Council for their effective and remarkable\r\nconduct of the Group’s deliberations.\r\nThe General Assembly’s discussion of this\r\nquestion gives us the opportunity to reaffirm the\r\nposition of the State of Kuwait, which is based on the\r\nfollowing established principles.\r\nFirst, we stress the importance of codifying the\r\nmeasures taken by the Security Council to improve its\r\nmethods of work without waiting for agreement on\r\nother issues such as the Council’s size, composition or\r\ndecision-making process.\r\nSecondly, Kuwait supports an increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council. But the increase\r\nshould not be too big; we must maintain the Council’s\r\neffectiveness and the efficiency of the decision-making\r\nprocess, enabling the Council to continue to confront\r\nthe disputes that pose a threat to international peace\r\nand security.\r\nThirdly, the increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council should be in line with the principles\r\nof equal sovereignty of States and equitable\r\ngeographical representation. Let me stress that the\r\ninterests of small and developing countries should not\r\nbe overlooked in this exercise. Fourthly, a permanent\r\nseat should be allocated to the Group of Arab States.\r\nThat seat would be occupied on a rotating basis and\r\nthrough coordination among members of the Group.\r\nFifthly, we note the importance of placing limits and\r\ncontrols on the scope of the exercise of the right of\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.28\r\nveto; it should be exercised only on issues that fall\r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter. Sixthly, a realistic\r\nattitude should be adopted in dealing with changes in\r\nthe number of members of certain geographical groups,\r\nespecially the Asian and Eastern European Groups.\r\nFinally, we express the hope that a consensus\r\nformula will eventually be worked out to the\r\nsatisfaction of all parties, while maintaining the\r\nefficiency of the work of the Security Council without\r\nany impediments.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n"
