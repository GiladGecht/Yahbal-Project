(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 45\r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of and\r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United\r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic,\r\nsocial and related fields\r\nCommemoration of the tenth anniversary of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The General\r\nAssembly will now devote, in accordance with\r\ndecision 58/529 of 17 December 2003, one day of\r\nplenary meetings to the commemoration of the tenth\r\nanniversary of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development.\r\nBefore proceeding further, I should like to recall\r\nthat, on 8 October 2004, I transmitted a letter to the\r\nChairmen of the regional groups and, through them, to\r\nthe Member States, to consult on my intention to invite\r\nthe Executive Director of the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund, Ms. Thoraya Obaid, to make an\r\nintroductory statement this morning, following the\r\nstatement by the Deputy Secretary-General.\r\nAs I have received no objection, may I take it that\r\nit is the wish of the General Assembly to invite the\r\nExecutive Director of the United Nations Population\r\nFund, Ms. Thoraya Obaid, to make an introductory\r\nstatement this morning following the statement by the\r\nDeputy Secretary-General.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Ten years have\r\nelapsed since the adoption of the Programme of Action\r\nof the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, whose anniversary we are\r\ncommemorating today.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the Cairo Consensus\r\nushered in a new era for peoples. Historic resolve was\r\nshown by the 179 States that met in Cairo on\r\n13 September 1994 to express their commitment to\r\nimprove the daily lives of peoples and to respect their\r\nrights. The commitment undertaken by States during\r\nthe Cairo Conference and their interest in empowering\r\nwomen and in promoting gender equality was a\r\ndecisive factor in improving the quality of life of all\r\nsocieties.\r\nThe Cairo Programme of Action has stood the\r\ntest of time. Indeed, the texts resulting from the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment have taken on even greater relevance\r\ntoday, at a time when countries are working together to\r\nreduce widespread poverty, hunger, disease and gender\r\ninequality, and to bring about a more stable world.\r\nIn every region, the Programme of Action of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment serves as a reference document for\r\ncountries — one that is essential to attain their\r\ndevelopment goals. Progress has therefore been made\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nin improving family planning and in the creation of\r\ninstitutions and the adoption of legislation aimed at\r\neliminating all forms of discrimination and violence\r\nagainst women.\r\nLikewise, we note that significant progress has\r\nbeen made in educating and informing young people\r\nabout reproductive health and about the prevention of\r\nthe spread of HIV/AIDS.\r\nI am firmly convinced that the Cairo Programme\r\nof Action is of crucial importance in the process of\r\nimplementing a coherent and effective approach to\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nIt goes without saying that we must continue our\r\nefforts to ensure, in an integrated and coordinated\r\nmanner, the implementation of the recommendations\r\nadopted at the major summits organized in the social\r\nand economic fields by the United Nations in the\r\n1990s. That is imperative if we want to make progress\r\nby the sixtieth anniversary of the Organization in\r\nimplementing the commitments we undertook and in\r\nattaining the Development Goals we set ourselves in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration.\r\nWe do not need to wait for the sixtieth\r\nanniversary to consider the tragic situation of the\r\nnearly half a million mothers who die each year\r\nfollowing childbirth. We do not need to wait until next\r\nyear to consider the ravages caused by the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic. We do not need to wait to fight more\r\neffectively against extreme poverty, which afflicts\r\nmore than a billion people throughout the world.\r\nIn addition to the symbolic importance of the\r\ntenth anniversary of the adoption of the Programme of\r\nAction of the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development, this occasion should remind us of\r\nthe urgent need to tackle the many problems that\r\ncontinue to affect the lives of our peoples, particularly\r\nin the developing world.\r\nWe must therefore, swiftly and in cooperation\r\nwith the international financial institutions and other\r\ndevelopment partners, take essential measures to\r\nintegrate population concerns into national\r\ndevelopment strategies. That will depend, above all, on\r\nthe mobilization of the resources necessary to attain the\r\nobjectives of the Cairo Programme of Action.\r\nThe seriousness with which we implement that\r\nambitious Programme and our determination to make it\r\na priority in the General Assembly’s discussions and\r\ndecisions related to development will attest, I am\r\nconvinced, to our resolve to meet together the\r\nchallenges that increasingly confront us. Let us act\r\nwhile there is still time. The future of humanity is at\r\nstake. By doing that, we will live up to our promises\r\nand considerably increase our chances of establishing a\r\nmore peaceful and more prosperous world.\r\nI now give the floor to the Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nThe Deputy Secretary-General: Three decades\r\nago in Bucharest, the World Population Conference\r\novercame political differences to adopt a\r\ngroundbreaking, comprehensive Plan of Action. That\r\nPlan gave the world its first template for integrating\r\npopulation concerns into economic and social\r\ndevelopment, and it established the basic principles\r\nguiding population programmes today. Ten years later\r\nin Mexico City, despite serious disagreements on some\r\nquestions, the International Conference on Population\r\nadopted additional recommendations that recognized\r\nthe need for wider access to family planning and\r\nunderscored the importance of issues such as the needs\r\nof adolescents and the role of men.\r\nAnd then, of course, 10 years ago in Cairo, the\r\nworld’s efforts to address the intertwined challenges of\r\npopulation and development took another major step\r\nforward. The Programme of Action adopted there\r\nsituated population issues more firmly in the broader\r\nquest for development and for poverty reduction. It\r\nlinked them more prominently with sustainable\r\ndevelopment, reflecting the results of the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment — the Earth Summit — held two years\r\nearlier. It gave renewed prominence to education —\r\nparticularly of girls — as an agent of change. It\r\nstressed the importance of reproductive health, gender\r\nequality and women’s empowerment, and it gave wide\r\nand systematic recognition to the role of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations.\r\nToday, countries throughout the world continue to\r\nuse the Programme of Action of the International\r\nConference on Population and Development in forging\r\nthe strategies and policies with which they hope to\r\naddress population issues and to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. And they are making\r\nsubstantial progress, building on the achievements of\r\nearlier decades.\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nThe world is beginning to see the end of rapid\r\npopulation growth, which should help in the struggle\r\nagainst poverty and pollution. Life expectancy\r\ncontinues to rise in all regions of the world except\r\nEastern and Southern Africa and Eastern Europe.\r\nFertility continues to decline in virtually every region\r\nof the world. Couples have increasing access to the\r\nreproductive health programmes, contraceptives and\r\ninformation they need to choose the number and\r\nspacing of their children. These and other gains are\r\nprofound and far-reaching, as they involve some of the\r\nmost basic and intimate human experiences: birth,\r\ndeath and marriage; the joy of seeing grandparents\r\nsurvive or children spared needless suffering and death\r\nfrom a preventable disease.\r\nYet any satisfaction we may feel at the expansion\r\nof rights and freedoms involving population issues\r\nmust be tempered by an acute awareness of the\r\nunfinished agenda, the fact that parts of the world are\r\nnot sharing in this progress, and the daunting\r\nchallenges that have emerged in the meantime.\r\nHigh population growth remains a concern for\r\nmuch of the developing world, while some developed\r\ncountries have expressed concern that their population\r\nis growing too slowly or, in some cases, even\r\ndeclining.\r\nAIDS is taking a devastating toll — particularly\r\nin Africa, where it is reversing the rise of life\r\nexpectancy in some countries and erasing decades of\r\neconomic and social progress.\r\nDeclines in fertility and increased longevity mean\r\nthat societies — developed and developing alike — are\r\nnow wrestling with the wide-ranging implications of\r\nageing, including the need for health care, pensions\r\nand safety nets and the need to ensure the social\r\nintegration of older persons.\r\nRapid urbanization is yet another population\r\nchallenge. So is international migration. Some 175\r\nmillion people now reside in a country other than the\r\none where they were born, and people continue to risk\r\ntheir lives in search of opportunity in wealthier\r\ncountries. The vast majority of migrants are making\r\nmeaningful contributions. In some cases, however,\r\nmigration gives rise to economic, political and social\r\ntensions.\r\nAnd we have yet to achieve universal access to\r\nvitally needed reproductive health services and family\r\nplanning, which we must do if we are to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals and advance the status\r\nof women. Instead, too many women and girls go\r\nwithout, leading to unplanned or mistimed births that\r\nkeep families in poverty, threaten maternal and child\r\nhealth, and increase the rate at which girls drop out of\r\nschool. And the persistence of widespread\r\ndiscrimination and violence against women and girls\r\nalso helps to perpetuate the vicious circle of poverty\r\nand poor health.\r\nIt is only a little more than a generation since the\r\ninternational community collectively started addressing\r\npopulation and development issues. While much has\r\nbeen achieved and much has been learned, there have\r\nalso been shortfalls and gaps. In the coming years and\r\ndecades, we can and must go much further.\r\nThe regional review meetings that have taken\r\nplace during the past two years have shown strong\r\nsupport for the Cairo consensus in all parts of the\r\nworld. Civil society is also deeply engaged, including\r\nthrough such initiatives as the world leaders’ statement\r\nthat was formally presented to the United Nations\r\nyesterday. And our commemoration here today should\r\ncontribute to preparations for the important events\r\nplanned for the next year: the 10-year reviews of both\r\nthe Beijing and Copenhagen conferences and the five-\r\nyear review of the Millennium Declaration.\r\nI hope Governments are ready to forge closer\r\npartnerships and provide the necessary resources,\r\nnotably to the United Nations agencies that do such\r\nimportant work on the ground, helping people to\r\nimprove their daily lives. As we commemorate the\r\ntenth anniversary of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development, I would like to commend\r\nthe United Nations Population Fund for its tireless and\r\nbrave efforts in advancing the Cairo agenda. As we\r\nlook ahead, I urge you to overcome your remaining\r\ndifferences on sensitive issues, reaffirm your full\r\ncommitment to the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD) Programme of\r\nAction and intensify our common work towards a\r\nworld of development and well-being for all.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In accordance\r\nwith the decision taken earlier and without setting a\r\nprecedent, I give the floor to the Executive Director of\r\nthe United Nations Population Fund for an introductory\r\nstatement.\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nMs. Obaid (United Nations Population Fund): It\r\ngives me great pleasure to address this commemoration\r\nof the tenth anniversary of the International Conference\r\non Population and Development (ICPD).\r\nCairo was a turning point in development\r\nthinking, as it put the focus where it should be: on\r\nimproving the quality of life of all people, no matter\r\nwhere they happen to be born and whether they are\r\nwomen or men. It put the focus on protecting human\r\nrights and the natural resources on which all life\r\ndepends and bringing our world into greater balance. It\r\nrecognized that what happens in one part of the world\r\naffects what happens on the other side, and that\r\nmigration, urbanization, ageing, poverty and\r\nsustainable development are all interconnected.\r\nAll over the world, in every region, people are\r\ndemanding information and services to prevent\r\nHIV/AIDS and unwanted pregnancy. In every country,\r\nan increasing number of women are speaking out\r\nagainst the violence they face in their lives, and a\r\ngrowing number of men are standing by their sides\r\ndemanding that justice be served. Today as never\r\nbefore, young women are refusing to be victims of\r\ngenital cutting, and in more and more cases, their\r\nparents and communities are supporting them in this\r\nchoice. Young people who live in this global\r\ninformation age are demanding that they be let out of\r\nthe dark when it comes to information and services to\r\nprotect their reproductive health and exercise their\r\nreproductive rights.\r\nIssues that were sensitive at the time of the\r\nconference in Cairo are now matters of open public\r\ndebate. Never before, for instance, has there been so\r\nmuch discussion and outrage about the sexual violence\r\nthat women face in conflict situations. There is\r\nagreement that much more needs to be done to address\r\nthese massive violations of human rights. Indeed, the\r\ntime that has passed since the adoption of the ICPD\r\nProgramme of Action has only confirmed its deep\r\nrelevance and vision. For this, much credit belongs to\r\nthe Secretary-General of the ICPD, Ms. Nafis Sadiq,\r\nmy predecessor as the Executive Director of UNFPA.\r\nToday, I would like to pay tribute to Dr. Sadiq, who\r\nwas and remains a tireless champion of the Cairo\r\nagenda.\r\nThe agenda is built on a simple premise: that\r\nproviding universal access to education and\r\nreproductive health services and promoting women’s\r\nempowerment will reduce gender inequality and poor\r\nhealth, and help break the cycle of poverty in which\r\nmillions of individuals and families now find\r\nthemselves. If Governments make these critical\r\ninvestments in people, and use population data and\r\npolicies, not to count people but to make people count,\r\nthen a chain reaction will occur, leading to concrete\r\nprogress that is not only measured by scientists, but\r\nmost importantly, by individuals as they go about their\r\ndaily lives.\r\nThe links in this chain reaction are increased\r\nchoices and opportunities, increased knowledge and\r\nfreedom from fear and ignorance, increased health and\r\nproductivity and the enhanced ability of individuals to\r\ntake control over their lives and their futures. This is\r\nwhat empowerment is all about, and this gives real\r\nmeaning to the term “sustainable human development”.\r\nThe ICPD Programme of Action is a global\r\nProgramme based on universal ethical principles that\r\nreinforce human dignity and encourage the fulfilment\r\nof human aspirations. As the lead agency in\r\nimplementing this agenda, UNFPA is committed to\r\nthose human rights, and we are taking a culturally\r\nsensitive approach to programme development and\r\nimplementation. Such an approach does not enforce\r\nsolutions, but engages the concerned communities in a\r\nprocess of dialogue, so that they can reach out, out of\r\ntheir own positive values and institutions, and bring\r\nabout the change that is necessary to implement the\r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nWe should be proud of the progress that has been\r\nmade in implementing the ICPD Programme of Action\r\nduring the past ten years. Yesterday, an incredible\r\nroster of supporters of the Cairo agenda from across\r\nsectors and regions of the world was presented to the\r\nUnited Nations. The support provided through the\r\nworld leaders’ statement complements the renewed\r\ncommitment expressed by the world’s Governments\r\nand peoples in the regional meetings convened over the\r\npast two years in preparation for the tenth year\r\nanniversary. From Asia to Africa, from Europe to Latin\r\nAmerica, Governments have reaffirmed their support\r\nof the Programme of Action, taken stock of the\r\nprogress to date and identified priorities for the future.\r\nHowever, while we celebrate our achievements,\r\nwe must also be realistic. We continue to face key\r\nchallenges, which must be urgently addressed. We\r\nmust rise to the challenge of expanding the reach of\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nservices and programmes to reach all people, especially\r\nthe poorest, the young and the most marginalized.\r\nWhere the ICPD Programme of Action has been\r\nimplemented, we know it is working. We know how to\r\nreduce maternal and child mortality, we know how to\r\nreach young people so they can protect their health and\r\nlead productive lives, we know how to prevent HIV\r\ninfection, and we know how to bring about safe\r\nmotherhood.\r\nHowever, the reach of these effective\r\ninterventions is limited by a lack of human and\r\nfinancial resources. We must mobilize the necessary\r\npolitical will to provide the necessary resources. We\r\nhave to involve more sectors and reach out to ministers\r\nof finance, so that sufficient domestic and international\r\nresources are allocated for population and reproductive\r\nhealth.\r\nAllow me to conclude my statement today with a\r\nwarning. If greater action is not taken to fully\r\nimplement the ICPD Programme of Action, we will not\r\nonly miss the opportunity to achieve the ICPD goals,\r\nwe will also fail to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Together, we must ensure that the\r\nICPD agenda is fully reflected in the 2005 Millennium\r\nDeclaration review process. Ten years ago, the\r\nGovernments of the world made a promise to bring\r\nabout reproductive health for all by the year 2015.\r\nToday, I call upon all leaders to live up to this\r\ncommitment and to keep the promises they made in the\r\ngreat city of Cairo ten years ago.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Before\r\nproceeding further, I should like to turn to some\r\norganizational matters pertaining to the conduct of the\r\nmeeting. Members are reminded that the list of\r\nspeakers on this item will be closed this morning at\r\n10.55 a.m.\r\nI see no objection, it is so decided.\r\nNext, we turn to the length of statements. In my\r\nletter dated 11 October 2004 to all permanent\r\nrepresentatives, I urged all speakers to limit their\r\nstatements in the debate to five to seven minutes, in\r\norder to allow the Assembly to hear all the speakers\r\ntoday. In view of the large number of delegations\r\nalready inscribed on my list — and there are 65 so\r\nfar — I therefore appeal to speakers to cooperate in\r\nthis respect.\r\nTo assist speakers in managing their time, a light\r\nsystem has been installed at the speaker’s rostrum\r\nwhich functions as follows: a green light will be\r\nactivated at the start of the speaker’s statement; an\r\norange light will be activated 30 seconds before the\r\nend of the seven minutes; and a red light will be\r\nactivated when the seven minute limit has elapsed.\r\nMr. Al-Mahmoud (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nwould like to thank you for giving me the chance to\r\nspeak on behalf of the Group of 77 and China in the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPopulation issues encompass the most basic\r\nconcerns of human existence. It is the birth, death and\r\nmigration of individuals that form the essential\r\ncomponents of demographic dynamics. For whole\r\nsocieties, these basic events produce rates of\r\npopulation increase or decrease and form the age\r\nstructure of population and the geographic pattern of\r\nhuman settlements. These patterns have their influence\r\non the social, economic, political and environmental\r\nissues that are central to the realization of the goals of\r\nsustainable development.\r\nTo address these concerns in a comprehensive\r\nmanner, the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development (ICPD) was convened in Cairo in\r\n1994. The Conference adopted a Programme of Action\r\nthat addresses the full range of population issues,\r\nespecially those related to economic and social\r\ndevelopment. The Programme of Action identified\r\nqualitative and quantitative goals in a number of key\r\nareas, including universal access to the knowledge and\r\nmeans for achieving reproductive health; goals\r\nregarding education, especially for girls; gender equity\r\nand equality; mortality and health, stressing infant,\r\nchild and maternal mortality; and combating the\r\nemerging epidemic of HIV/AIDS. Above all, the\r\nProgramme emphasized the need to provide the\r\nresources required to meet those goals.\r\nThe Programme of Action is not just a set of\r\ngoals; it sets out a road map of practical policy and\r\nprogrammatic actions and the ways to reach each goal\r\nwith specified time-bound targets. After 10 years, there\r\nis a need to review the progress made so far and\r\nidentify the areas that require further work.\r\nWorld population reached 6.4 billion persons in\r\n2004. The current average annual growth rate of\r\npopulation is 1.3 per cent, significantly lower than the\r\nrate of 1.7 per cent during the period from 1975 to\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\n1990. Although there has been significant gain in the\r\nuniversal reduction of fertility, the progress is uneven.\r\nWhile 100 out of 192 countries have met the goal\r\ncontained in the Programme of Action of a life\r\nexpectancy at birth greater than 70 years in the period\r\n2000 to 2005, 36 countries, mainly in Africa, remain\r\nwith life expectancies at birth lower than 50 years.\r\nProgress is by no means uniform, as many countries\r\nhave witnessed a stagnation of mortality improvement,\r\nif not a decline in life expectancy. The causes are\r\nrelated to socio-economic transformations, the re-\r\nemergence of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis\r\nand cholera, and the impact of the HIV/AIDS\r\nepidemic.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to expand\r\nthroughout the world, erasing decades of social and\r\neconomic progress and producing a devastating impact\r\non population in terms of increased morbidity and\r\nmortality. For some countries, the demographic impact\r\nof AIDS is enormous. This has serious consequences\r\nfor their development prospects, as they are losing\r\npeople in the most productive times of their lives.\r\nSince the ICPD in 1994, migration has become a\r\nmajor issue of concern for the international community.\r\nAs of mid-2000, approximately 175 million persons\r\nresided in countries other than where they were born.\r\nThe ICPD Programme of Action accorded particular\r\nimportance to the basic rights of migrants and\r\nencouraged more cooperation and dialogue between\r\ncountries of origin and countries of destination in order\r\nto maximize the benefits of international migration.\r\nUnfortunately, recent developments to curb\r\nimmigration have also resulted in violations of the\r\nbasic rights of immigrants.\r\nIn this respect, the Programme of Action adopted\r\nat ICPD stipulates, in paragraph 10.29, the following:\r\n“The problems of refugees and displaced\r\npersons arising from forced migration, including\r\ntheir right to repatriation, should be settled in\r\naccordance with the relevant principles of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, other international\r\ninstruments and relevant United Nations\r\nresolutions.”\r\nThe Group of 77 and China call for a\r\ncomprehensive arrangement to address all aspects of\r\nthe issue of international migration. The Group looks\r\nforward to the high-level dialogue on this issue in 2006\r\nand hopes that it will help in forging greater global\r\nconsensus on issues pertaining to international\r\nmigration and protecting the rights of all immigrants.\r\nIn the key areas of reproductive health, many\r\ncountries have established reproductive health\r\nprogrammes, including family planning, expanded\r\naccess to these programmes and improved their quality.\r\nNevertheless, millions still lack access to the means of\r\nachieving reproductive health.\r\nThe Programme of Action also called for an\r\nincreased national capacity to enhance primary health\r\ncare and maternal and child health delivery networks.\r\nMany countries have made progress in this area but the\r\npace is slow and there is a need for new impetus.\r\nInfant and child mortality rates have improved,\r\nbut 62 developing countries, accounting for 35 per cent\r\nof the world’s population will not meet the goal of an\r\ninfant mortality rate of 50 deaths per 1,000 live births\r\nfor the period 2000 to 2005. There are still gaps in the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action and this\r\nwill have dire implications for the realization of\r\ndevelopment goals, particularly the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nThe Programme of Action recommended time-\r\nbound targets on resource mobilization — $17 billion\r\nby the year 2000 and $18.5 billion by 2005. Despite a\r\nsteady but slow increase in resources for population\r\nactivities in the last 10 years, the target of mobilizing\r\n$17 billion was not met; similarly, attaining the target\r\nof $18.5 billion by 2005 remains a challenge for the\r\nentire world.\r\nIn conclusion resource gaps are especially large\r\nin poor countries, and the least developed countries\r\ndepend entirely on official development assistance\r\n(ODA). Unless new, additional and sustained resources\r\nare provided to developing countries, it is unlikely that\r\nmost of the goals and targets of the Programme of\r\nAction will be met. Instead, there will be a worsening\r\nof the population and reproductive health situation in\r\nmany poor countries. The need to reach the\r\ninternationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of\r\ncountries’ gross domestic product allocated for ODA\r\nand to fulfil the commitments made at Monterrey is\r\nmost urgent.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China believe that this\r\nyear’s review should lead to a renewed commitment to\r\nthe goals of the Programme of Action. This issue\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nshould also receive high priority at the 2005 high-level\r\nevent to be held next year, as the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals cannot be achieved without the full\r\nimplementation of the ICPD goals.\r\nThe members of the Group remain committed to\r\nthose goals and will make every effort to achieve them\r\non time. We hope the international community will\r\nextend its full support to the Group’s efforts to achieve\r\nthose goals.\r\nMr. Van den Broeck (Netherlands): I have the\r\nhonour to take the floor on behalf of the European\r\nUnion. The candidate countries Bulgaria, Croatia,\r\nRomania and Turkey, the countries of the Stabilization\r\nand Association Process and potential candidates\r\nAlbania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro,\r\nand the European Free Trade Association countries\r\nIceland and Liechtenstein, members of the European\r\nEconomic Area, align themselves with this statement.\r\nIn view of the long list of speakers and the\r\nlimited time available, I will not read out all of my\r\nstatement. The full text will, however, be distributed in\r\nthe Hall.\r\nWe are now at the halfway stage on the journey\r\nthat started 10 years ago in Cairo. The International\r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD)\r\nwas a landmark event in the history of people-centred\r\ndevelopment, human freedom and the emancipation of\r\nthe individual. The ICPD Programme of Action takes a\r\nrights-based approach in which the well-being and free\r\nchoice of individuals — rather than the population\r\ntargets set by policy planners — are key. In 1994, the\r\nindividual freed himself or herself from the population\r\nplanners and took centre stage, saying, “I am not a\r\nnumber; I have rights; and my choice is my own”.\r\nThe Programme of Action is firmly rooted in\r\nprinciples of human development, women’s\r\nempowerment and gender equality and in the needs and\r\nrights of individuals, including young people. As is\r\noften the case, liberty and responsibility breed\r\nprosperity. When couples and individuals are enabled\r\nto make a free and informed choice about the number,\r\ntiming and spacing of their children, families are\r\nsmaller and population growth is slower, contributing\r\nto economic growth, sustainable development and\r\npoverty reduction.\r\nIn a series of regional conferences and during the\r\nthirty-seventh session of the United Nations\r\nCommission on Population and Development, all\r\nmarking 10 years since the ICPD, Governments\r\nthroughout the world have reaffirmed their\r\ncommitment to the Programme of Action. The\r\nworldwide consensus continues to be both universal\r\nand strong.\r\nBut we have not done enough. At all times we\r\nshould remember the human beings who have died on\r\nour watch during the past 10 years whose lives we\r\ncould have saved by fully living up to the\r\ncommitments we made. They did nothing to deserve\r\nthat, but we have not done enough to prevent it. Let us\r\nbe clear: up to now, we — donors and programme\r\ncountries alike — have collectively failed to deliver.\r\nAnd that is why we failed those people.\r\nWomen, in particular, bear the burden. Is it\r\nbecause they are women, whose deaths and ill-health\r\nhappen in silence and out of sight? Would it be\r\ndifferent if they were men? Still today, in our age of\r\nunprecedented prosperity, one woman dies during\r\npregnancy and childbirth every minute. That is a\r\ndouble tragedy, given that millions of children each\r\nyear are left without mothers.\r\nToday is the day that we must reinvigorate our\r\ncommitment. The ICPD gave us a Programme of\r\nAction, not a programme of intention. If we are to\r\ntranslate our commitment to the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals into concrete results\r\nby 2015, we must dedicate ourselves to the complete\r\nand improved implementation of the Cairo Programme\r\nof Action. The way to 2015 leads through Cairo.\r\nBefore moving ahead, we must look back on the\r\nfirst part of our journey to see where we stand.\r\nAlthough our actions have fallen behind our intentions,\r\nprogress has been made. For example, important\r\nprogress has been made towards the ICPD goal of\r\nuniversal access to reproductive health services by\r\n2015. The use of modern contraception has risen from\r\n55 per cent of couples in 1994 to 61 per cent today.\r\nThe increased use of family planning has contributed\r\nto the reduction in global fertility, with a consequent\r\ndecline in the annual population growth rate to 1.3 per\r\ncent.\r\nGovernments embrace the ICPD Programme of\r\nAction as an essential blueprint for realizing\r\ndevelopment goals. Ninety per cent of countries\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nreporting took legislative, policy or programme\r\nmeasures to promote reproductive health and rights, to\r\nprotect the rights of women and girls, to address\r\ngender-based violence, to reduce the gender gap in\r\neducation and to increase women’s participation.\r\nNearly all of the developing countries reporting\r\nhave integrated population concerns into their\r\ndevelopment policies and strategies, mostly to address\r\nthe interaction of population and poverty. Three\r\nquarters of countries reported having a national\r\nstrategy on HIV/AIDS. One third said they had specific\r\nstrategies aimed at high-risk groups. New partnerships,\r\nincluding public-private partnerships, have been\r\nformed, and the commitment of civil society in the\r\nform of non-governmental organizations and trade\r\nunions has been recognized.\r\nHowever, we cannot afford to be complacent.\r\nNow, 10 years on, the Programme is more relevant than\r\never. We believe, in particular, that we face the\r\nfollowing challenges.\r\nFirst, as I stressed earlier, maternal mortality\r\nremains stubbornly high. There is no more telling\r\nmanifestation of gender inequity than the death of a\r\nwoman from the complications of pregnancy or\r\nchildbirth. Complications from unsafe abortions are a\r\nmajor cause of maternal morbidity and mortality,\r\nespecially among young, poor and rural women.\r\nMillions of women survive childbirth but suffer illness\r\nand disability. The empowerment of women, families\r\nand communities, and the encouragement of a shared\r\nsense of responsibility for pregnancy, are central to\r\naddressing the political, socio-economic and cultural\r\nfactors that so often prevent women from receiving\r\ngood-quality care.\r\nSecondly, we are facing the scourge of\r\nHIV/AIDS. At the time of the Cairo Conference, 20\r\nmillion people were infected with HIV. Today, that\r\nnumber has doubled. Some 14,000 people become\r\ninfected with HIV every day, and the vast majority of\r\nthose infections are transmitted sexually. Yet sexual\r\ntransmission can be avoided. Condoms constitute a\r\nsimple and affordable, yet life-saving commodity. The\r\nfight against HIV/AIDS cannot succeed without the\r\nuniversal provision of comprehensive reproductive\r\nhealth services. People at highest risk and most\r\nvulnerable to HIV infection, such as young people,\r\nmen who have sex with men, injecting drug users and\r\nsex workers, deserve our attention. Just like anyone\r\nelse, they should be provided with adequate sexual and\r\nreproductive health services, offered without stigma or\r\nblame, based on a full recognition of their rights and\r\ntailored to the realities of their lives.\r\nThirdly, the largest generation of young people in\r\nhistory, 1 billion strong, is now aged between 15 and\r\n25 years — they are just entering reproductive life. In a\r\nworld battered by HIV/AIDS, they must have access to\r\nreliable information services and supplies if they are to\r\nmake responsible, potentially life-saving choices.\r\nAlmost half of all new HIV infections occur among\r\npeople younger than 25. It is a fact of life that some\r\nyoung people will have sexual relations. We must have\r\nthe courage to speak of the everyday reality of\r\nsexuality and provide young people with the\r\ninformation they need. It is not just the right of\r\nadolescents to be informed; information is essential to\r\nsurvive. And nowadays silence means death.\r\nFourthly, there is an alarming shortfall in the\r\nsupply of reproductive health commodities. Over the\r\npast ten years, donor support for reproductive health\r\nsupplies, including contraceptives for family planning\r\nand condoms for HIV prevention, has declined. In sub-\r\nSaharan Africa, donors provide an average of 4.6\r\ncondoms per man per year. Based on an analysis of 49\r\ncountries, the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA) estimates that the financial shortfall in 2004\r\namounts to $75 million. The real shortfall is likely to\r\nbe triple that amount. Without the means to exercise\r\nthem, rights are meaningless.\r\nFifthly, gender inequality is a continuing\r\nimpediment to the implementation of the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action and an important contributing\r\nfactor to high maternal mortality ratios and the spread\r\nof HIV/AIDS. Many countries have introduced laws on\r\ngender-based violence, but these are often not\r\nenforced. Efforts promoting women’s advancement are\r\noften susceptible to budget cuts. In order to improve\r\nthe status of women, we should, for instance, eliminate\r\ngender gaps in education, increase access to sexual and\r\nreproductive health information and services, reduce\r\ndiscrimination in employment, property ownership and\r\ninheritance and stop gender-based violence.\r\nSixthly, the complex challenges of ageing\r\npopulations, the long-term sustainability of pension\r\nsystems and issues of international and internal\r\nmigration and integration of diverse populations —\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nalso, by the way, part and parcel of the Cairo agenda —\r\nare fully recognized by the EU.\r\nFinally, reproductive health needs in conflict\r\nsituations demand our attention. As a consequence of\r\narmed conflict and natural disaster, all the wrongs of\r\nsociety are magnified. One quarter of the world’s\r\nrefugees are women of reproductive age; one in five of\r\nthese women is likely to be pregnant. The ICPD drew\r\nattention to the reproductive health needs of people in\r\ncrisis situations. More deaths occur worldwide from\r\npreventable complications of pregnancy and childbirth\r\nthan from starvation.\r\nAs we all know, facing such daunting challenges\r\nrequires financial means. That costs money. And that is\r\nwhy it is essential that we all live up to the financial\r\ncommitments we made. The numbers 0.7 per cent, the\r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) promise; and 4\r\nper cent, the ICPD target of allocating 4 per cent of\r\nODA to sexual and reproductive health and rights and\r\nto population issues, will all sound familiar in this\r\ncontext. Almost all of us, developed countries in\r\nparticular, but also developing countries, have failed to\r\nlive up to our promises in that regard. However, some\r\nhave done so because they were not willing; others,\r\nbecause they were not able. The EU is making steady\r\nprogress in fulfilling its commitment on the ODA\r\ntarget announced at the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development.\r\nBut it is not all about money. Political\r\ncommitment also makes the world go round. Beyond\r\nall the celebrations and commemorative events of this\r\nspecial year, the Cairo agenda must remain high on our\r\nown political agenda. Political leadership is essential if\r\nwe are to effectively address the challenges of the next\r\ndecade.\r\nTo address the outstanding issues of the\r\nProgramme of Action is a formidable challenge by\r\nitself. Indeed, it is a challenge made more difficult by\r\nattempts by some to roll back the ICPD agenda, but the\r\nICPD stands as relevant today as it did in 1994.\r\nWhat we need is a global partnership to improve\r\nthe realities of people’s lives. All sectors of society\r\nmust be involved. Governments cannot and should not\r\ngo it alone. The efforts of non-governmental\r\norganizations, local community groups and religious\r\nleaders are indispensable. We want to commend them\r\nand ask them to keep up the good work. The private\r\nsector also has a crucial role to play. Development is\r\neverybody’s business.\r\nThe global partnership for ICPD should ensure\r\nthat reproductive health issues are adequately\r\naddressed in all development processes, ranging from\r\npoverty education strategy papers to next year’s\r\nMillennium Development Goals event. As Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan wisely stated in Bangkok two\r\nyears ago, “The Millennium Development Goals,\r\nparticularly the eradication of extreme poverty and\r\nhunger, cannot be achieved if questions of population\r\nand reproductive health are not squarely addressed”.\r\nThe EU stresses that these issues must, therefore, be\r\nincluded in the review of the Millennium Declaration\r\nin September 2005 and in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreports on progress made in achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nI am proud to announce that the 25 member\r\nStates and the Commission of the EU intend\r\ncollectively to fill the entire reproductive health\r\ncommodities gap of $75 million in 2004 through a\r\nspecial contribution to the UNFPA Reproductive\r\nHealth Commodity fund. The analytical work of the\r\nUNFPA has demonstrated that reproductive health\r\nservices are some of the most cost-effective health\r\ninterventions. A million dollars in reproductive health\r\ncommodities will avoid the following human tragedies:\r\n360,000 unintended pregnancies; 150,000 induced\r\nabortions; 800 maternal deaths; 11,000 infant deaths;\r\nand 14,000 deaths of children under five years of age.\r\nAfter this Assembly session, we again go home\r\nwith our work cut out for us. After today, the Cairo\r\nagenda must remain high on the international agenda.\r\nThere is still plenty of work to do and there are still\r\nplenty of goals to achieve. Someone once said that\r\ngoals are dreams with deadlines. We can translate these\r\ndreams into reality during this generation. The recipe is\r\nsimple, the message is clear — less ideology, more\r\nreality; less lip service and more money. Our deadline\r\nis 2015.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Before giving\r\nthe floor to the next speaker, I would like to remind the\r\nAssembly that we must end our discussion today. We\r\nalready have an evening meeting planned, so if\r\neveryone is going to have an opportunity to speak, and\r\nif we are to finish our work tonight, I would ask\r\nspeakers to observe the time limit for making their\r\nstatements.\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nI now call on the representative of Barbados, who\r\nwill be speaking on behalf of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM).\r\nMr. Hackett (Barbados): At the outset,\r\nMr. President, let me thank the Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Madame Louise Fréchette, and the Executive\r\nDirector of the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA), Mrs. Thoraya Obaid, for their introductory\r\nremarks.\r\nI have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) member States of\r\nthe United Nations on this agenda. We fully associate\r\nourselves with the statement delivered by the\r\ndelegation of Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina. We would, however, like to provide some\r\nperspectives of the progress being made in achieving\r\nthe goals and objectives of the Programme of Action of\r\nthe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD) that are unique to the CARICOM\r\ncountries.\r\nThe 2004 report of the United Nations\r\nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs on the\r\nreview and appraisal of the progress made in achieving\r\nthe goals and objectives of the Programme of Action of\r\nthe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD) clearly states that much progress\r\nhas been made during the last 10 years. Population\r\ngrowth has been slowed, the world has experienced\r\nsome reduction in fertility and infant mortality has\r\nbeen reduced. In the case of the CARICOM countries,\r\nmost have been experiencing a reduction in population\r\ngrowth, as well as a reduction in infant mortality, going\r\neven beyond the ICPD interim goals.\r\nThese achievements have been made largely as a\r\nresult of national policies that have been put in place in\r\nmany of the countries. In these policies, emphasis has\r\nbeen placed on improving the quality of life of their\r\npopulations, through the implementation of\r\nprogrammes to alleviate poverty, provide adequate\r\nhealth services — including reproductive health\r\nservices — adequate nutrition, and the development\r\nand enhancement of the status of women, including\r\nensuring the protection of their human rights.\r\nA rights-based approach to health has been\r\nadopted, particularly in respect of reproductive health,\r\nand the CARICOM countries have supported the\r\nimplementation of programmes that make health care a\r\nright for all. Indeed, the right to health care is regarded\r\nas a fundamental right without which none of the other\r\nrights can easily be achieved. Through programmes on\r\nreproductive health and education, efforts have been\r\nmade to bring men and women together to build greater\r\nawareness of gender and reproductive-health matters.\r\nA phenomenon in many Caribbean societies is the\r\nincreasingly high percentage of elderly people among\r\ntheir populations. As a result of improvements in living\r\nconditions, countries in the Caribbean are experiencing\r\nchanges in the age structure of their populations, and\r\nwe are observing an increase in life expectancy rates\r\nand hence an increase in the number of older persons.\r\nThis demographic trend has become a matter for\r\nconcern for almost all of the countries of the subregion\r\nand has necessitated an assessment of the capacity of\r\ncountries to provide basic social services such as health\r\ncare and social security to meet the needs of the\r\nincreasing number of older persons. Based on national\r\npolicies on ageing, however, some programmes are\r\nalready in place to provide social services to the\r\nelderly.\r\nFaced with the spread of HIV/AIDS and its\r\nimpact, particularly on youth, in the Caribbean, many\r\nGovernments have introduced strategies designed to\r\nsupport the capacity of the education and health-care\r\nsystems, with a particular focus on reproductive health.\r\nThey have also sought to establish national guidelines\r\nfor prevention, treatment and care, and to eliminate the\r\nstigma and discrimination against people living with\r\nHIV/AIDS. Another area of attention has been the\r\npromotion and defence of the human rights of girls and\r\nwomen by making them less vulnerable to sexual\r\nviolence, thereby enhancing their capacity to protect\r\nthemselves from infection.\r\nOn the issue of migration, one of the most\r\ndominant issues over the last 10-year review period has\r\nbeen the increasing number of emigrant retirees\r\nreturning to their countries of origin after spending\r\nsignificant periods of time overseas, both in Europe\r\nand in North America. This has led to the need for\r\nGovernments to put in place policies, programmes and\r\nresources to respond to the needs of that specific group\r\nof the population, given the impact of the dynamics of\r\npopulation movement on the socio-economic\r\nconditions of island countries.\r\nThere is also a direct linkage between the goals\r\nof the ICPD and a number of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), particularly those\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nrelating to achieving universal primary education,\r\npromoting gender equality, reducing child mortality,\r\nimproving maternal health, and halting and reversing\r\nthe spread of HIV/AIDS. We believe that the progress\r\nthat has been made in the implementation of the ICPD\r\ndecisions will contribute to achieving a number of\r\nthese MDGs as we approach the year 2015.\r\nIndeed, we would argue that the eradication of\r\nextreme poverty and hunger, the first of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, cannot be achieved if\r\nquestions of population and reproductive health are not\r\nfully addressed.\r\nDespite the progress that has been achieved in the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action by\r\nCARICOM countries, a number of constraints have\r\naffected the pace and level of implementation. These\r\ninclude the availability of financial and human\r\nresources and the varying levels of institutional\r\ncapacity of the countries of the subregion. We therefore\r\nsee a need for continuous and additional resources, in\r\nline with the commitments made by countries in Cairo\r\n10 years ago, in order to ensure the full achievement of\r\nthe ICPD goals. Such resources will also help to\r\nstrengthen the institutional capacity of many of our\r\ncountries. In addition, partnership arrangements\r\nbetween government, the private sector and civil\r\nsociety, as well as those at the regional and\r\ninternational level, did not materialize to the degree\r\nneeded to lead to a significantly higher level of\r\nimplementation. We will certainly do more to work\r\nwith partners to ensure that reproductive health and\r\npopulation issues are more fully integrated into\r\nnational development plans and that the partners\r\nthemselves understand the important role that they can\r\nplay.\r\nCARICOM countries are generally quite pleased\r\nwith the progress that has been achieved. On this tenth\r\nanniversary of the ICPD, the CARICOM States\r\nMembers of the United Nations would like to\r\ncompliment the United Nations Population Fund for\r\nleading the global effort in the implementation of the\r\nCairo Agenda. We reaffirm our commitment to the\r\nfurther implementation of the Programme of Action in\r\nthe years to come. That commitment has best been\r\nexpressed by the support of a number of heads of\r\nGovernment of the region for the leadership statement\r\nof the ICPD.\r\nMs. Sahlin (Sweden): Let me first underline that\r\nSweden aligns itself with the statement by the\r\nNetherlands.\r\nThe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD), held at Cairo, was a\r\ngroundbreaking event. Issues that used to be taboo are\r\ntoday on the international agenda, in particular sexual\r\nand reproductive health and rights. Unfortunately, the\r\ninternational community is not providing sufficient\r\npolitical support or funding to achieve the ICPD goals.\r\nImplementation of the Cairo Agenda is indispensable\r\nfor achieving the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe Swedish Government recently decided that it\r\nwill achieve its own goal of allocating 1 per cent of its\r\ngross national income to official development\r\nassistance by the year 2006.\r\nMy Government fully supports the work of the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). While the\r\nOrganization has lost important financial support from\r\nother donors such as the United States of America,\r\nSweden has continued to increase its contribution to\r\nthe Fund. Next year we will continue to increase our\r\nsupport, with an additional $11 million. Sweden also\r\nsupports the invaluable work of the International\r\nPlanned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) and other civil\r\nsociety organizations. Without them, we would not\r\nhave come this far, and we will not succeed in reaching\r\nour goals without them.\r\nI would like very briefly and also very openly to\r\nhighlight seven areas of concern. First, all people\r\nshould be able to have a satisfying and safe sex life.\r\nWe, especially the States, must shoulder our\r\nresponsibility to speak openly about these issues.\r\nSecondly, young people need to have the means\r\nto protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy and\r\nsexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS.\r\nThey need sex education as well as condoms and other\r\ncontraceptives. Too many actors today promote\r\nabstinence only. For many girls and women, that\r\nmessage is not enough, in view of the too-often-\r\nprevailing perception of women’s subordination to\r\nmen. Where rape and other forms of sexual violence\r\nare widespread, abstention is not an alternative, at least\r\nnot for women.\r\nThirdly, HIV/AIDS represents a huge threat to\r\ndevelopment. We know that 80 per cent of all new\r\nHIV/AIDS infections are spread through unsafe sex. It\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nis thus life-threatening and certainly contrary to a pro-\r\nlife philosophy to spread false rumours that condoms\r\nare dangerous, as, for instance, actors within the\r\nVatican are doing.\r\nTo be successful, we need to integrate HIV/AIDS\r\nand the sexual and reproductive health and rights\r\nagendas. Many of the poorest women do not have\r\naccess to sexual or reproductive health services. Many\r\nwomen and girls are infected due to sexual violence,\r\nbut studies also show that married women are more\r\nlikely to be infected than unmarried women. In\r\ngeneral, more attention must be paid to the role of boys\r\nand men and to their sexuality.\r\nFocusing on the fight against HIV/AIDS, we\r\noften forget the individuals behind the illness. An\r\nAIDS-positive woman also has rights — rights to help\r\nher to make responsible choices. She needs access to\r\ninformation, education, health care and services, and to\r\nsafe and legal abortions. People living with HIV/AIDS\r\nall too often suffer from discrimination. Several\r\ncountries prohibit people infected with HIV/AIDS\r\nfrom entering their country. Why? I can not understand\r\nthat, since we all know that HIV/AIDS is not\r\ntransmitted through the air.\r\nFourthly, gender equality, which includes men’s\r\nresponsibility, is crucial in our common struggle.\r\nWomen are still being discriminated against just\r\nbecause we are women. Women’s empowerment is a\r\nkey factor for securing women’s sexual and\r\nreproductive health and rights. As long as there is an\r\nimbalance of power between women and men, we do\r\nnot have fully democratic societies.\r\nFifthly, we must improve maternal health. The\r\ngoal of decreasing maternal mortality and morbidity is\r\nvery far away. Every day more than 400 women die —\r\nI repeat, every day more than 400 women die — as a\r\nresult of illegal, unsafe abortions. The Swedish\r\nGovernment will continue to argue that every woman\r\nshould have the right to choose a legal and safe\r\nabortion, to decide over her own body.\r\nSixthly, once again, all people should be able to\r\nhave a satisfying and safe sex life and in all people I\r\ninclude women, lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and\r\ntransgender persons. Therefore I’m very sad that\r\nwomen’s sexual actions as well as, for example,\r\nlesbians’ and gay men’s sexual actions are often\r\npunished in different ways. This is also often\r\nsanctioned or condoned by the State.\r\nSeventh, persons with disabilities of course also\r\nshould enjoy the same sexual and reproductive health\r\nand rights as everyone else. The Vienna Declaration,\r\nadopted by the World Conference on Human Rights,\r\nreaffirms that “all human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms are universal and thus unreservedly include\r\npersons with disabilities” (A/CONF.157/23).\r\nFinally, it is first and foremost States that have\r\nthe responsibility to implement decisions of the ICPD.\r\nHowever, civil society organizations have important\r\nroles to play both in implementation on the ground and\r\nadvocacy. We can all learn from each other and our\r\ntask will be easier if we cooperate. My Government\r\nwas a strong actor ten years ago and I can assure you\r\nthat Sweden will continue to give our full support to\r\nthe ICPD.\r\nMr. de Silva (Sri Lanka): Let me congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of this important\r\nsession of the General Assembly, and extend to you the\r\nwarm best wishes of the Government of Sri Lanka for a\r\nsuccessful stewardship of this meeting.\r\nAt the outset I wish to state that Sri Lanka and\r\nthe Government of Her Excellency Chandrika\r\nBandaranaike Kumaratunga is fully committed to the\r\nimplementation of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD) Programme of\r\nAction. In this regard, I wish to take the opportunity to\r\nhighlight some of our achievements in the post-ICPD\r\nperiod, the challenges we face and the way forward in\r\nmeeting both the ICPD and the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nDuring the past decades, Sri Lanka has continued\r\nto consolidate achievements in the fields of population,\r\ndevelopment and reproductive health. That period has\r\nalso seen an acceleration of population and socio-\r\neconomic change. Sri Lanka was one of the first\r\ncountries to make an early transition to adopt the\r\nconcept of reproductive health and to formulate a\r\ncomprehensive national policy on population and\r\nreproductive health. Based upon that policy, an action\r\nplan was developed to implement population,\r\ndevelopment and reproductive health activities in a\r\nbroad-based and holistic manner. The concept of the\r\nwell-woman clinic was introduced as far back as 1996.\r\nAlthough HIV prevalence is relatively low in Sri\r\nLanka, the Government is concerned about the\r\npotential threat that it poses, and places high priority\r\non the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS and\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nsexually transmitted infections in women. A policy on\r\nblood safety was developed in 1999. A comprehensive\r\nsocial support programme has been developed and\r\nsupplemented with grant assistance from the World\r\nBank and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis\r\nand Malaria, to prevent the spread of HIV among\r\nvulnerable groups.\r\nSri Lanka’s programme in the population and\r\ndevelopment field during the past decades has been\r\nsignificant. The rate of population growth has declined\r\nfrom 1.5 per cent in the early 1990s, to 1.1 per cent\r\ntoday. Life expectancy at birth for females and males is\r\ncomparable to that of more developed countries, with\r\n75.4 and 70.7 years, respectively. The infant mortality\r\nrate has been reduced to 13 per 1,000 live births and\r\nthe maternal mortality rate ratio is about 50 per\r\n100,000 live births.\r\nPer capita income has continued to increase at a\r\nsteady pace. Continued reliance on open economic\r\npolicies with a human face and greater emphasis on\r\nhuman resource development has enabled Sri Lanka to\r\nachieve an average economic growth rate of 5 per cent\r\nduring the past decade, despite the armed conflict in\r\nthe north and east of the country.\r\nLiteracy rates are equally high for both males and\r\nfemales — 91 per cent and 88 per cent, respectively.\r\nThis impressive indicator has placed Sri Lanka in a\r\nunique position in relation to other countries at a\r\nsimilar level of per capita income.\r\nConsiderable progress has been made in\r\nimproving gender equity and development. With regard\r\nto institutional development, Sri Lanka had the\r\nWomen’s Bureau since 1978, even before the\r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women. The Government\r\nadopted the National Women’s Charter in 1993 and a\r\nseparate ministry for women’s affairs was established\r\nin 1997. Gender focal points have been appointed in\r\nsectoral ministries. Amendments to the penal code\r\nhave been made to enhance the punishment for rape\r\nand other forms of sexual abuse and violence.\r\nTrafficking of women and children has also been made\r\na criminal offence. A child protection authority has\r\nbeen established under Her Excellency, the President,\r\nto protect the rights of the children, particularly with\r\nregard to sexual abuse and trafficking.\r\nA draft bill on domestic violence is under\r\nconsideration by the Cabinet of Ministers. A bill on\r\nwomen’s rights and gender policy is being formulated.\r\nIn spite of the progress made in the field of\r\nmaternal health, still, two thirds of maternal mortality\r\nand morbidity are due to preventable causes. Although\r\nmaternal and childcare services have reached the great\r\nmajority of the population, the quality of service needs\r\nimprovement. The people’s demand for better quality\r\nservice, is the result of both rising income and\r\neducation levels of the population. Although the\r\nfertility rate is at replacement level, significant fertility\r\ndifferences still exist between socio-economic groups\r\nand between the various geographic areas.\r\nThe goals of the ICPD Programme of Action\r\nrequire the precondition of good governance and peace.\r\nIn that regard, I wish to state that the impact of the\r\narmed conflict in the north and east of the country for\r\nnearly two decades, which resulted in a large number\r\nof internally displaced persons and strained the\r\nprovisions of health and reproductive health services,\r\nis gradually declining.\r\nThere is no doubt that the benefit of the peace\r\ndividend would be widespread and positive. Population\r\nand development issues are very much interrelated.\r\nInternational development that brings about economic\r\nshocks causes adverse effects on developing countries.\r\nThat, in turn, affects the implementation of the\r\npopulation and reproductive health programmes.\r\nTherefore, I wish to urge the international donor\r\ncommunity to increase their contributions to enable\r\ndeveloping countries to mitigate such external shocks,\r\nwhich are beyond our control, to enable population and\r\nreproductive health programmes, including poverty\r\nalleviation programmes, to be effectively implemented.\r\nWe all realize that in order to consolidate the\r\ngains that Sri Lanka has achieved thus far and to move\r\nforward to face emerging challenges in the coming\r\nyears, a broader and deeper partnership between the\r\nGovernment, civil society and the international\r\ncommunity is essential. I wish to state that Sri Lanka\r\nhas effectively and efficiently utilized domestic and\r\ninternational resources in the realization of our\r\npopulation and reproductive health goals.\r\nWe are indeed grateful to the donor community\r\nand in particular to the United Nations Population\r\nFund (UNFPA) for the assistance extended to Sri\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nLanka to implement its programmes effectively. Such\r\ncontinued assistance will certainly enable us to meet\r\nthe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment goals and the Millennium Development\r\nGoals during the given time frame.\r\nMrs. Argaña (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): It is\r\nan honour for Paraguay to participate in this important\r\nmeeting commemorating the tenth anniversary of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD). The Paraguayan Government\r\nattaches special importance to the ICPD and follows it\r\nclosely, because of its important recommendations and\r\nconclusions and, most importantly, in order to assess\r\nhow far we have come in ten years of implementation.\r\nParaguay reaffirms its commitment to continue to\r\nmake progress in the implementation of the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action on population and development\r\nof 1994, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),\r\nthe regional implementation strategy for Latin America\r\nand the Caribbean, the Madrid International Plan of\r\nAction on Ageing and the agreements reached\r\nsubsequently at the regional level, such as the Santiago\r\nDeclaration, the Puerto Rico consensus and the Mexico\r\nCity consensus, which were endorsed recently at the\r\nthirtieth session of the Economic Commission for Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean (ECLAC) held in July\r\n2004.\r\nRegarding the actions adopted by my own\r\ncountry to this end, I must mention that we have\r\nratified the Convention on the Elimination of All\r\nForms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in\r\n1996. This international instrument has promoted\r\ngenuine reform through the formulation of domestic\r\nlegislation that meets international standards through\r\ncomprehensive public policies with a gender\r\nperspective and through a strengthened national\r\nnetwork that encourages dialogue and cooperation\r\nbetween governmental and non-governmental sectors.\r\nThe international conferences on women, and\r\nespecially the Beijing Platform for Action of 1995 and\r\nits follow-up, have also promoted legal and normative\r\nadvances for gender equality and equity in a national\r\ncontext of strengthening democracy.\r\nThe strategic nature of the Cairo issues had\r\nalready drawn the attention of the Paraguayan\r\nGovernment before the conference itself. Thus, our\r\nnational constitution of 1992 is a basic legal\r\nframework in which articles were introduced on\r\nreproductive health, maternity and paternity, family\r\nplanning and maternal and child healthcare. This\r\nprovided a legal framework for the State’s\r\nimplementation of reproductive health and family\r\nplanning policies, with the participation of the private\r\nsector and civil society organizations in providing\r\neducation and services.\r\nIt is important to point out that we have had many\r\nadvances in public policies related to gender, but we\r\nhave also confronted setbacks. The country has health\r\npolicies basically in keeping with the conclusions of\r\nCairo and Beijing. We thus established the National\r\nReproductive Health Council through a 1994 decree,\r\nwhich adopted technical standards for pregnancy, natal\r\nand post-natal care, reproductive health and guidelines\r\nfor epidemiological monitoring of maternal health and\r\nmortality. These are the most important advances in\r\nhow to strengthen action aimed at the health of women.\r\nSubsequently, we adopted the National Plan on\r\nreproductive health for 1997 to 2001, which is a post-\r\nCairo version, the National Policy for comprehensive\r\nhealthcare for women and the National Plan for\r\ncomprehensively addressing the issue of adolescence.\r\nThe second National Plan for equal opportunity for\r\nwomen and men for 2003 to 2007, adopted by decree\r\nnumber 1958 of 2004, contains nine spheres of action\r\nand one of them relates to the comprehensive\r\nhealthcare for women, from the standpoint of gender as\r\na cross-cutting issue. We also have the second National\r\nPlan on sexual and reproductive health for 2003 to\r\n2008, which will contribute to improving the quality of\r\nlife of our country’s population, to the reproductive\r\nrights of individuals and to social and gender equality.\r\nParaguay has made very important progress in the\r\nstruggle against violence in the family. In 1995, we\r\nratified, through law number 605, the Inter-American\r\nConvention on the Prevention, Punishment, and\r\nEradication of Violence against Women. In order to\r\nimplement the Convention, we developed a National\r\nPlan Regarding Violence Against Women, which the\r\nState has been implementing since 1996.\r\nWe have a National Programme to combat AIDS\r\nand a Strategic Plan for 2001 to 2004 to improve the\r\nquality of life of those infected. While the incidence of\r\nHIV/AIDS in Paraguay is relatively low in comparison\r\nwith other countries, there is a steady increase in the\r\nnumber of women infected. This serves as a warning\r\nand signals the need to take specific action for\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nprevention, care and non-discrimination against women\r\ninfected with HIV.\r\nIn regard to the subject of population, at the\r\nbeginning of the twenty-first century, there were two\r\nimportant events in the field of demographics. The first\r\nwas the beginning, in 2001, of the process of\r\ndeveloping Paraguay’s population policy, which was\r\nsubmitted to the National Congress and to other social\r\nsectors in the country for consideration, in the hope of\r\nreaching the broadest possible consensus for its final\r\npromulgation. This was designed as an instrument for\r\nshort-, medium- and long-term implementation in order\r\nto empower the population as a strategic resource to\r\npromote sustainable development. The second was the\r\nNational Population and Housing Census of 2002,\r\nwhich made it possible to gather more updated\r\ninformation on the socio-demographic situation of the\r\ncountry.\r\nIn the field of education, I would like to mention\r\nthat, in 1996, the Ministry of Education and Culture\r\npublished the strategic plan for educational reform,\r\nentitled “Paraguay 2020: Let us face the educational\r\nchallenge”. This document outlines our national\r\neducational policy. In 1995, we established the\r\nNational Programme for equal opportunity and results\r\nin education, with a view to including the gender\r\ncomponent at all levels and in all types of education as\r\nwell as in curriculum reform, in educational materials,\r\nin teacher’s training and in the educational community.\r\nIn this regard, we succeeded in introducing into teacher\r\ntraining programmes issues such as gender roles and\r\nequal treatment in the structure and role of the family,\r\nsexually transmitted diseases, respect for cultural and\r\nreligious diversity. Along the same lines, work is being\r\ndone to review and adjust guidelines for evaluating\r\ntextbooks and educational materials.\r\nWe know that the implementation of the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action is a basic prerequisite for the\r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs). The Government, given the international\r\ncommitment to attain the goals by the year 2015, has\r\nentrusted the design of a national strategy to fight\r\nagainst poverty, inequality and social exclusion to a\r\ngroup of institutions. The strategy will be implemented\r\nover several terms of Government.\r\nIt is also relevant to point out that in Paraguay,\r\nwe are committed to improving substantially the\r\ndistribution and performance of the social budget in\r\norder to meet the Millennium Development Goals. The\r\nGovernment enjoys significant cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations aimed at monitoring the social budget\r\nand at mitigating poverty and inequality.\r\nAnother important area of progress has been the\r\nestablishment in the middle of 2000 of a tripartite\r\ncommission to follow-up the Cairo Programme of\r\nAction. That is an important body for dialogue,\r\nagreement and international cooperation and to follow-\r\nup the implementation of the International Conference\r\non Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of\r\nAction. It is composed of institutional representatives\r\nof the Government, civil society and cooperating\r\nUnited Nations bodies.\r\nThose are just some of the measures adopted by\r\nParaguay that reflect the great importance that we\r\nattach to the Cairo objectives, the MDGs and the\r\npolitical will we have to give those objectives concrete\r\nexpression. At the subregional level, that includes\r\ntechnical cooperation received from international\r\nbodies that is also given to different countries of the\r\nregion.\r\nIn conclusion, on behalf of the Government of\r\nParaguay, we believe that the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund is a forum of fundamental importance\r\nfor assessing the implementation of the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action. Ten years after the Conference,\r\nthere remain shortcomings in some areas that require\r\nnew efforts, through which — in the case of Paraguay,\r\nthrough our Ministry for Women’s Affairs and the\r\nsupport of the international community — we hope to\r\nstrengthen implementation of public policy and\r\ncomprehensive programmes in a number of areas.\r\nLastly, we congratulate Mrs. Thoraya Obaid, the\r\nExecutive Director of the United Nations Population\r\nFund, and Mrs. Marisela Padrón, Director of the\r\nDivision for Latin America and the Caribbean of the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund, for their dedication to\r\nthe subject before us and for their contribution to the\r\nprogress of women in our countries.\r\nMr. Kamugisha (Uganda): In 1994, ten years\r\nago, in Cairo, we committed ourselves as Governments\r\nto the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD) Programme of Action. We agreed\r\nto put human beings at the centre of our population and\r\ndevelopment programmes. We committed ourselves to a\r\ncomprehensive reproductive health agenda including\r\nsexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV/AIDS.\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nWe further committed ourselves to address gender\r\nequality, equity and the empowerment of women.\r\nI am glad to report that in Uganda, since Cairo,\r\nwe formulated a comprehensive National Population\r\nPolicy for sustainable development. Our Government’s\r\nhealth policy has since encouraged a primary health care\r\napproach that is comprehensive and pro-poor people.\r\nSince 1994, the reproductive health concept has taken\r\nroot. A national reproductive health policy and\r\nguidelines that aim at increasing access are now\r\navailable. Reproductive health has been identified as a\r\npriority programme and my Government will continue\r\nto increase funding for reproductive health.\r\nIn this regard, the Ministry of Health will continue to\r\nwork with the Ministry of Finance to ensure that this is\r\nreflected in our sector-wide approaches and other\r\nreforms such as Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers. In\r\nUganda, we recognize the complementary role of civil\r\nsociety organizations, including non-governmental\r\norganizations and cultural institutions, and we have\r\nworked with them, as well as other development partners\r\nlike the United Nations Population Fund, to implement\r\nprogrammes to improve the welfare of our people.\r\nAs a result of those combined efforts, we have\r\nwitnessed, since Cairo, progress in some sectors. For\r\nexample, in Uganda, we have witnessed a relatively\r\nrapid decline in the HIV/AIDS epidemic from a high\r\nlevel of 30 per cent in 1992 to 6.2 per cent currently.\r\nUganda recognizes that strong leadership coupled with\r\na clear, focused policy framework for coordination are\r\nparticularly critical to achieving progress.\r\nUganda’s success also depended very much upon\r\nthe Government providing an enabling environment for\r\nall stakeholders to play their role according to their\r\ncomparative advantages, using a multisectoral\r\napproach and a strategy that adopted an “ABC” model\r\n(where A stands for abstinence, B for being faithful\r\nand C for condom use). Our challenge on the HIV/AIDS\r\nfront is to maintain the momentum of success without\r\nbeing complacent, as we roll out a programme to ensure\r\naccess to anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs by all those that need\r\nthem.\r\nRegarding gender equality, equity and the\r\nempowerment of women, we have involved women in\r\nmany aspects of matters of governance. In our national\r\nParliament, 24 per cent of the seats are occupied by\r\nwomen and 25 per cent of the Cabinet is also made\r\nup of women. In Uganda, we have women judges,\r\nwomen Permanent Secretaries and women in others\r\nsenior civil service positions. Since 1997, our\r\nUniversal Primary Education programme has not only\r\nincreased primary school enrolment three-fold but has\r\nalso removed the disparity in enrolment of boys and\r\ngirls as well as reducing dropout rates of girls.\r\nDespite those achievements, Uganda, like many\r\nother developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica, continues to face severe challenges in our\r\ndevelopment agenda. For example, in the field of\r\nreproductive health, both infant and maternal mortality\r\nhave not improved appreciably. In Uganda, infant and\r\nmaternal mortality rates stand at 88 per 1000 and\r\n505 per 100,000, respectively. Needless to say, these\r\nfigures are unacceptably high.\r\nAccessibility and affordability of HIV/AIDS\r\ndrugs remains another challenge. Our experience in\r\nUganda is that HIV/AIDS affects all categories of\r\npeople. However, youth, women and the poor are\r\ndisproportionately affected.\r\nIt is against this background that Uganda believes\r\nthat on this occasion, as we commemorate the tenth\r\nanniversary of the historic Cairo meeting, we should\r\nseriously reflect on our past performance as we chart a\r\nnew course for the future.\r\nWe, in developing countries, continue to face\r\nchallenges in reproductive health and family planning,\r\nincluding reproductive health commodities and supplies.\r\nOur health services face serious challenges in their\r\ncapacity to deliver services. Those challenges include\r\nhuman resources and infrastructure. We need to continue\r\nworking with our development partners on these\r\nparticular concerns, as well as strengthening our\r\nSouth-South partnerships in the field of population and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nUganda also feels very strongly that our\r\npopulation and reproductive health programmes on the\r\none hand, and HIV/AIDS programmes on the other,\r\nneed to build strong linkages and collaborative efforts.\r\nThe case for integrating and mainstreaming\r\nreproductive health in HIV/AIDS programmes is\r\ncompelling now more than ever before, especially in\r\nview of the scarcity of resources. Otherwise these will\r\nremain as missed opportunities.\r\nUganda would like to put on record our strong\r\nappreciation for the excellent work done by the United\r\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA) and our other\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\npartners in supporting our population and reproductive\r\nhealth goals and objectives. Uganda appeals to our\r\ndevelopment partners to continue with the support that\r\nthey have given to UNFPA in the past, and to do even\r\nmore. In the same vein, Uganda feels that as we\r\nfocus on the Millennium Development Goals to be\r\nachieved by the year 2015, we need to remember that\r\nthey will not be reached unless we attain the goals of\r\nthe ICPD Programme of Action.\r\nMs. Ameline (France) (spoke in French): We have\r\ngathered here at a key stage in the process begun 10\r\nyears ago at the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development (ICPD), a major event in that sphere.\r\nAddressing issues related to the development of\r\npopulations worldwide undoubtedly raises the question\r\nof resolving poverty, since the link between those\r\nissues is clear and winning the fight against poverty is\r\nuniversally recognized as one of the essential\r\nconditions for sustainable development. It was recently\r\nstated in this Hall that the fight against world poverty is\r\nessential for the security of developed and developing\r\ncountries alike.\r\nHow can we fail to recall the impetus given by\r\nPresident Jacques Chirac and President Lula da Silva,\r\nPresident Lagos Escobar and Prime Minister Rodríguez\r\nZapatero to this fight, which on 20 September resulted\r\nin the New York Declaration on the Action against\r\nHunger and Poverty? How can we fail to welcome the\r\nimpetus generated by the mobilization around that\r\nDeclaration? That initiative must be kept in mind in\r\naddressing the issues that concern us; I will return to it\r\nin a moment.\r\nWe fully subscribe to the statement just made by\r\nthe presidency of the European Union. I wish at this\r\npoint to thank Ms. Nafis Sadik, at whose initiative the\r\nWorld Leaders Statement in Support of ICPD was\r\nissued, signed by several heads of State, other\r\nprominent individuals and institutions, to promote the\r\nimplementation of the commitments undertaken at\r\nCairo 10 years ago. Her initiative and tenacity are\r\nencouraging and full of hope.\r\nWe are living in a time of global challenges.\r\nFrance is building ties and cooperation among\r\ncountries, especially between North and South, in a\r\nspirit of fraternity, in order, as the President of France\r\nhas said, “to put our partnership at the service of a world\r\nof justice and peace; a world of growth and well-being;\r\na world of collective responsibility; a world that shares\r\nknowledge and respect for cultures and identities”.\r\nWe have a new vision of international solidarity.\r\nWe believe that the Programme of Action adopted in\r\nCairo at the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development was an important turning point in\r\ndemographic policies.\r\nIn order to implement its commitments, France\r\nhas undertaken a number of actions with its partners in\r\nthe developing countries. I would like to highlight\r\ntwo of them here. First, in the North-South\r\npartnerships on population and development and in the\r\npromotion of equality between men and women,\r\nimportant work is being done today with our partners in\r\nthe countries of the South. Those partnerships are being\r\ndeveloped in diverse sectors at the institutional level, in\r\nthe field and in research.\r\nWe have also initiated effective triangular\r\ncooperation among France, Tunisia and Niger on\r\nwomen’s and children’s health in the Kollo health district\r\nin Niger. The organization Equilibres et Populations is\r\nparticularly involved in transmitting people’s needs\r\nand in mobilizing them around health and reproductive\r\nissues, in collaboration with parliamentarians.\r\nThe International Parliamentarians Conference on\r\nthe Implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action,\r\nto be held in Strasbourg, France, on 18 and 19 October\r\n2004 will give us an opportunity to reaffirm our support\r\nfor the ICPD through the mobilization of our partners\r\nfrom the South.\r\nWe have emphasized the importance of\r\npreserving the achievements of the ICPD and its\r\nProgramme of Action at meetings of the United\r\nNations regional commissions and at the March session\r\nof the Commission on Population and Development,\r\ndevoted to this theme. We also reaffirmed it in Geneva,\r\nat the European Population Forum, held in January\r\n2004.\r\nWe have also been supporting, since 1988, the\r\nestablishment of scientific partnerships for training and\r\nresearch in the framework of our Centre for Population\r\nand Development, which encompasses all French\r\ndemographic research institutions and our research\r\npartners from the South.\r\nFrance’s commitment and cooperation on\r\npopulation issues can also be seen at the international\r\nlevel. France has long been firmly engaged with those\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nissues, in close cooperation with its European partners.\r\nIn those areas, the action of the United Nations Fund\r\nfor Population (UNFPA) is essential. In our view,\r\nUNFPA is an effective, active agency, present in the\r\nfield, and we fully support it.\r\nIts Executive Director, Ms. Thoraya Obaid, who\r\nhas just been reconfirmed in a new mandate by the\r\nSecretary-General, can count on our active\r\ninvolvement in promoting and defending women’s\r\nrights, especially at regional conferences on population\r\nand women’s rights. We also intend to continue our\r\nsupport for UNFPA action in the field. In 2002-2003,\r\nwe carried out two joint projects towards the\r\nimplementation of the Cairo Programme of Action —\r\nin Madagascar and in Côte d’Ivoire — and a project in\r\nMorocco on support for women victims of violence. A\r\nregional project is also being developed in the Horn of\r\nAfrica, in Eritrea, with the French non-governmental\r\norganization Médecins du Monde as our partner and\r\nwith UNFPA as the main funder.\r\nBut continued vigilance is called for. Ten years\r\nafter the Cairo Conference, the results of the policies\r\nthat have been followed vary widely from one country\r\nto another. While progress has been made, the\r\nchallenges nevertheless remain enormous. In some\r\ncases — unfortunately too many — there has been\r\nabsolutely no forward movement because of political,\r\nideological or religious impediments.\r\nI can only express my delight that the Nobel\r\nPeace Prize has been awarded to Ms. Wangari Maathai.\r\nThe investment and energy this woman has given for\r\nconservation and improvement of the environment in\r\nAfrica as well as for respect for fundamental human\r\nrights, make her a symbol and an example for world\r\npeace and democracy and for the development of\r\npopulations, through the jobs created through\r\nreforestation. The award also bears enormous hope and\r\nincentive for future mobilization. I pay tribute here,\r\nthrough Wangari Maathai’s action, to the incredible\r\nenergy expended by African women for development\r\nand towards strengthening respect for the environment\r\nof their countries.\r\nFaced with the new challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury — fighting poverty, protecting our planet and\r\npromoting sustainable development — our partnerships\r\nmust be universal and must serve the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of populations. In that spirit, the\r\ngatherings of 2005 oblige us to have a true global\r\npartnership.\r\nI would like solemnly to propose, in the spirit of\r\nnext year’s tenth anniversary of the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women, held in Beijing, that we create\r\na real partnership for Beijing to allow us all, together,\r\nto face the great debate of our society at the beginning\r\nof this new century.\r\nFrance is determined to meet the challenges of\r\nthe new century not only with progress for our\r\nsocieties, but also with progress for our democracies\r\nand for all humankind. As Gabriel García Márquez put\r\nit, let us not ask what the century can give us; let us\r\nsay that it expects everything from us.\r\nMr. Hussain (Pakistan): First of all, on behalf of\r\nPakistan’s delegation I would like to briefly describe\r\nthe demographic profile of Pakistan, the sixth most\r\npopulous country in the world. In terms of population\r\nsize, with its current population of 151 million,\r\nPakistan is the fourth largest country in Asia and\r\nsecond among the South Asian Association for\r\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) countries. The current\r\npopulation growth rate of Pakistan is estimated at 1.9\r\nper cent per annum, its total fertility rate per woman is\r\n4.1 and the contraceptive prevalence rate is 34 per\r\ncent.\r\nIf the same demographic characteristics prevail,\r\nPakistan’s population will reach around 195 million in\r\nthe year 2020. Under that scenario, it will take almost\r\n60-70 years to stabilize the population of Pakistan.\r\nThat is an alarming situation for Pakistan and a cause\r\nof serious concern.\r\nPakistan was a willing signatory to the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD) Programme of Action (POA) in\r\n1994 in Cairo. However, several disadvantages have\r\nhampered its efforts to implement the ICPD-\r\nProgramme of Action at the desired pace. Prior to the\r\nICPD, Pakistan suffered from weak political\r\ncommitment, lack of adequate resources, shifts in\r\npopulation policies, and socio-cultural rigidities. The\r\nsituation has changed substantially since 1994. The\r\npresent Government attaches the highest priority to the\r\nissue of population and to ensuring sustainable\r\ndevelopment in the country.\r\nElimination of the gender gap in basic education\r\nand literacy is the cornerstone of Government policy\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nfor social development in general, and education in\r\nparticular. That has led to some reduction in\r\ndemographic pressure, which in the past few decades\r\nhad impeded socio-economic development. While\r\nGovernment budgetary allocations since the ICPD have\r\nkept on increasing for the social sector, in particular for\r\npopulation, we still face resource constraints, although\r\nthe progress achieved has been good. Pakistan has\r\nscarce resources to allocate across competing demands,\r\nat a time when these are most urgently required.\r\nWe appreciate the fact that the ICPD\r\nrecommendations have introduced a new paradigm that\r\nhas heralded an era of global population and\r\ndevelopment initiatives. Please allow me to dwell a\r\nlittle bit on how Pakistan has tried to implement the\r\nICPD agenda. Pakistan has fully embraced the new\r\nparadigm and has reformulated its population and\r\ndevelopment policy, which focuses on meeting the\r\nnecessities of the people. The population policy is\r\ndesigned to achieve social and economic revival by\r\ncurbing rapid population growth and thereby reducing\r\nits adverse consequences for development. It is\r\nintended to achieve a reduction in dependency ratios,\r\nto alleviate pressures on dwindling resources and to\r\nhelp in the reduction of poverty.\r\nThe population policy has several wide-ranging\r\nconsequences for the economy, the polity, human rights\r\nand the long-term prosperity of Pakistan. It places\r\nemphasis on securing sustained political commitment\r\nand mobilizing broad-based support. At the same time,\r\nit is consistent with the country’s national laws and\r\ndevelopment priorities, and with the religious, ethical\r\nand socio-cultural values of the people. In fact, we\r\nhave adapted the principles of the ICPD to our own\r\nsocial, economic and cultural realities.\r\nWe are pursuing the ICPD agenda by creating an\r\nenabling environment for the implementation of our\r\npopulation and development policy. The essential\r\nmessage of the policy is to improve the quality of life\r\nof every Pakistani through a reduction in rapid\r\npopulation growth by providing high quality and\r\nreadily accessible reproductive health and family\r\nplanning services. The policy aims at bringing about\r\nsocial and demographic change, particularly through\r\nimprovements in education and the status of women. It\r\nrecognizes the concerted efforts that are required to\r\naddress the issue of population and development in its\r\nmultiple facets, through the collaborative efforts of a\r\nbroad range of stakeholders, including public and\r\nprivate institutions and non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nImportant elements of the policy, directed\r\ntowards the public sector programme, have been\r\nincorporated in the current Five Year Plan from 2003-\r\n2008. That is to ensure that the population factor and\r\nsuch concerns are appropriately included in the process\r\nof development planning. Population and development\r\ninterrelationships and inter-linkages have been stressed\r\nnot only in the population sector, but also other closely\r\nrelated sectors such as education, health, employment,\r\nthe development of women, and the environment\r\namong other areas.\r\nThe population, education and health sectors have\r\nalso been recognized as cross-cutting issues in the\r\nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) recently\r\nfinalized by the Government of Pakistan with the aim\r\nof reviving broad-based equitable growth and the\r\nreduction of poverty in the country.\r\nThe important area of focus in the post-ICPD\r\nperiod is the transition to reproductive health including\r\nfamily planning. We have made substantial progress in\r\nimproving reproductive health indicators as the total\r\nfertility rate has fallen and the contraceptive\r\nprevalence rate has also increased considerably. The\r\ninfant and maternal mortality rates have also registered\r\nappreciable decline. Our reproductive health indicators,\r\nhowever, still require considerable improvement to\r\nmatch international standards.\r\nAs already stated, our efforts will continue by\r\nfollowing a multisectoral approach with the\r\ninvolvement of all partners in the public and private\r\nsectors in order to advance the ICPD Programme of\r\nAction and achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals.\r\nThe 1973 Constitution of the Islamic Republic of\r\nPakistan clearly provides equal rights to men and\r\nwomen. We ratified the Convention on the Elimination\r\nof All Forms of Discrimination against Women\r\n(CEDAW) in 1996, conditional only on the provisos of\r\nour Constitution. In line with the ICPD\r\nrecommendations, the National Policy on Women\r\nDevelopment and Empowerment (NWPD) has been\r\nannounced and is being implemented. The Policy\r\ncomprises three inter-related elements: i) integration of\r\ngender issues into all sectors and programmes of\r\naction; ii) supporting and expanding the public role of\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nwomen, and iii) involving women in planning,\r\nmanagement and the implementation of projects.\r\nOne third of the seats have been reserved for\r\nwomen in local councils, while around 20 per cent in\r\nthe provincial and national legislatures. Consequently,\r\nwomen have also been elected against their reserved\r\nseats. Under the devolution plan, 40,000 women were\r\nelected as Councillors and Naib Nazims, for the local\r\nCouncils in 2001.\r\nI am confident that Pakistan is ready to accept the\r\nchallenges that lie ahead. Our goals are clearly\r\narticulated and I am confident that we are on the right\r\ntrack. However, our success or failure will depend\r\nultimately on our ability to operate in an unfavourable\r\nenvironment because of the severe resource\r\nconstraints. I am optimistic that donors and the\r\ninternational community will stand by us in these\r\ndifficult times.\r\nMrs. Chancy (Haiti) (spoke in French): It has\r\nalready been ten years since more than 180 countries\r\nadopted the Programme of Action of the International\r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD). It\r\nis now also the time to take stock. On the basis of the\r\nmajor goals set forth in the Cairo Programme of\r\nAction, we can state that there has been progress made.\r\nBut much remains to be done.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate the United Nations Population Fund,\r\nwhich is doing a great job. I also take this opportunity\r\nto thank all those who supported my country during the\r\nrecent natural disasters.\r\nThe problem of the environment and population\r\nis widely debated, but the main issue is to establish\r\ncoherent policies in that area. National administrative\r\nstructures must promote the coordination of those\r\npolicies. I would note that the necessary balance\r\nbetween population and the environment requires the\r\nresolution of such terrible, pressing problems as hunger\r\nand poverty, without minimizing other political and\r\nsocial problems.\r\nMy country is an example of that. We are now\r\nfacing a multidimensional crisis in the social,\r\neconomic, political, environmental, health and other\r\nfields. I would stress that the participation of the\r\nUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti in the\r\ndisarmament of armed gangs is essential and I thank\r\nthe international community for its support.\r\nThe political turmoil that afflicted Haiti from late\r\n2003 to early 2004 ravaged and weakened a population\r\nthat was already exhausted by a silent humanitarian\r\ncrisis. In addition to the floods that struck certain parts\r\nof the country in May 2004, a few weeks ago hurricane\r\nJeanne hit the coast of Haiti, killing almost 3,000\r\npeople and injuring several hundred thousand others.\r\nIt is essential that my Government take all\r\nnecessary steps to halt environmental degradation and\r\nto improve the standard of living of our people\r\nsignificantly. If we are to do so, the participation of all\r\nactive members of our society — women in\r\nparticular — is crucial.\r\nI wish to refer to the women and young girls of\r\nmy country, who represent 52 per cent of our\r\npopulation. A special effort must be made to enable the\r\nwomen of Haiti fully to play their part and to be full\r\nstakeholders in finding and implementing solutions to\r\npromote the country’s development.\r\nIn countries like ours, extreme poverty is a major\r\nobstacle for women and men alike when real choices,\r\nsuch as the choice of services and opportunities to\r\nimprove their lives, have to be made. Inequalities and\r\ndiscrimination limit even further the choices available\r\nto girls and women. The myriad political and economic\r\ncrises in Haiti have impeded our full implementation of\r\nthe Cairo Programme of Action, particularly with\r\nregard to access to health services and basic education\r\nand the prevention of violence against women. By\r\nincreasing services for safe motherhood — obstetric\r\ncare in particular — we can save millions of lives.\r\nComprehensive health care for women also means\r\nrespect for their physical and mental integrity.\r\nDuring periods of widespread repression, such as\r\nafter the 1991 coup d’état and during the recent\r\npolitical upheavals in Haiti, sexual violence against\r\nwomen has been used as a weapon of repression and\r\ndeterrence. Such exceptional violence arises out of the\r\nmore widespread practice of day-to-day violence\r\nagainst women. If we are to change such behaviour and\r\nto ensure that combating violence against women\r\nremains an ongoing concern, we must invest in far-\r\nreaching education programmes. The transitional\r\nGovernment in Haiti — which is seeking, inter alia, to\r\nlead the country towards free, fair and democratic\r\nelections in 2005 — has identified four strategic axes\r\nfor mainstreaming gender equality in its Interim\r\nCooperation Framework for the period 2004-2006.\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nFor Haiti, a country with many citizens living\r\nabroad, the issue of migration is of major concern. It is\r\ntime for the international community to adopt a\r\ncomprehensive approach to the issue. Constructive\r\ndialogue should be initiated between the countries of\r\norigin and the migrant host countries, enabling us more\r\ncoherently to address the problems of xenophobia,\r\ndiscrimination and the integration of migrants. The\r\nCairo Programme of Action is of great relevance in\r\nthat respect, meeting an urgent and real need for Haiti.\r\nAllow me, on behalf of the Government of Haiti,\r\nto thank the international community for pledging, last\r\nJuly in Washington D.C., to contribute financially to\r\nthe implementation of the Interim Cooperation\r\nFramework. We should have preferred, however, that\r\nthe priority accorded quite properly to humanitarian\r\nassistance following the recent natural disasters not\r\ndelay disbursements that are already procedurally so\r\nlong and complex.\r\nMr. Sidibe (Senegal) (spoke in French): I am\r\ndelighted to speak at this important plenary meeting\r\ndevoted to the celebration of the tenth anniversary of\r\nthe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, held on African soil in Cairo, Egypt, and\r\nto offer the contribution of my country, Senegal, to this\r\ncollective exercise assessing our common action.\r\nIn fulfilling that pleasant duty, I wish first to\r\nreiterate to you, Sir, the conviction of the delegation of\r\nSenegal that, under your enlightened guidance, this\r\nsession of the General Assembly will confidently\r\naddress the major events that are on our agenda for\r\n2005.\r\nThe past decade was rich in conferences and\r\nsummits at which priorities were established,\r\nobjectives agreed, strategies developed and the means\r\nof implementation identified in the pursuit of\r\nsustainable economic and social development.\r\nAnd yet, evaluation after evaluation, the\r\nconclusion has invariably been the same. The progress\r\nmade since those meetings is clearly significant, but\r\nunfortunately falls far short of the commitments\r\nundertaken. The Conference whose tenth anniversary\r\nwe commemorate today is no exception to that rule, as\r\nwe see from the fine report recently published by the\r\nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs in\r\ndocument E/2004/25, containing a review and appraisal\r\nof the progress made in achieving the goals and\r\nobjectives of the Programme of Action of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment. The report highlights the disparities\r\namong regions and among social sectors within\r\ncountries in respect of successes achieved and\r\ndifficulties encountered.\r\nWith regard to the specific situation of Africa, I\r\nhad the honour to preside over the regional ministerial\r\nreview conference held in Dakar in June. At that\r\nmeeting, the following nine subjects were discussed:\r\npopulation, poverty, environment and sustainable\r\ndevelopment; equality, gender equity and the\r\nadvancement of women; the family, its role, rights,\r\ncomposition and structure; children and youth;\r\nreproductive rights and health; HIV/AIDS; population\r\ndistribution, urbanization and migration; crises and\r\ntheir effects on populations; and the mobilization of\r\nresources for the implementation of population policies\r\nand programmes.\r\nOn each of those topics, we identified the\r\nimpediments to the implementation of the Cairo\r\ncommitments and proposed relevant strategies for\r\nreorienting our action. We also adopted a declaration\r\nwhereby we reaffirm our countries’ commitment to\r\npursuing the implementation of the objectives of the\r\nNgor/Diarama declaration and the Cairo Programme of\r\nAction, and the need to strengthen, with respect for the\r\ncultural realities of each country, our national\r\nprogrammes of action to ensure a decrease in\r\ndemographic growth, the promotion of the status of\r\nwomen, the reproductive health of adolescents, the\r\nreduction of maternal and infant/child mortality, the\r\nbalanced distribution of population across our national\r\nterritory, the control of unbridled urbanization and the\r\nprotection of vulnerable target groups, such as children\r\nand the elderly.\r\nThus, we Africans have made a clear-sighted\r\ndiagnosis and issued a series of recommendations,\r\noutlined in the Dakar declaration. Can we reasonably\r\nexpect, however, to attain the objectives of the Cairo\r\nConference if nothing is done to counter the\r\npersistence of extreme poverty, the high rate of\r\nHIV/AIDS infection and the armed conflicts roiling\r\nour countries?\r\nAnd yet, the means to achieve our shared\r\nambitions do exist. They involve a consistent\r\nmobilization of resources, together with the integration\r\nof our population concerns into our development plans,\r\nand in particular our poverty reduction strategy papers.\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nWe feel that this is essential if we are to avert the\r\ndanger that a large number of African countries could\r\nmiss the 2015 meeting of those countries that will have\r\nachieved the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nIn referring to the important role of international\r\nsupport and the considerable contribution made by the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to my\r\ncountry, I cannot conceal the fact that the success of\r\nour policies will depend to a great extent on a steady\r\nnational effort sustained by clear-sighted policy. The\r\nneed for such political far-sightedness explains why the\r\nGovernment of Senegal, in implementing the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action, has relied not only on traditional\r\ninstitutional mechanisms for the coordination of its\r\npopulation policy, but also on a strengthened\r\npartnership with various stakeholders, including\r\nparliamentarians, religious leaders, journalists and\r\ntraditional communicators.\r\nExamples of my country’s ongoing efforts\r\ninclude its health and reproduction programmes,\r\nwhereby special efforts are made to ensure the\r\npopulation’s free access to health services, and our\r\nstruggle against HIV/AIDS, the low incidence of which\r\nbears witness to the effectiveness of our early reaction\r\nand our continuous monitoring of that devastating\r\nscourge.\r\nToday’s meeting is timely in that it is being held\r\nin the context of preparations for the high-level plenary\r\nmeeting to conduct a five-year review of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. We feel that the\r\nconcrete proposals that emerge from this discussion\r\nwill contribute usefully to that important event.\r\nIn conclusion, I turn to the Executive Director of\r\nUNFPA and her colleagues in my country to express\r\nthe full satisfaction of the Senegalese Government and\r\nour President at the effectiveness and devotion with\r\nwhich they are executing our country programme.\r\nMr. Tutkushev (Kazakhstan) (spoke in Russian):\r\nI wish at the outset to congratulate all members on\r\nreaching the important landmark of the tenth\r\nanniversary of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development. That Conference played\r\na decisive role in elaborating common international\r\napproaches to resolving problems in the area of\r\npopulation and development.\r\nOver the past 10 years, States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations have made some progress in\r\ndeveloping national policies to mainstream\r\ndemographic and gender issues. Kazakhstan was no\r\nexception to that rule. Our country has consistently\r\nimplemented broad political, economic and social\r\nreforms to create a democratic State with a market\r\neconomy.\r\nIn December 2001, our Government adopted a\r\nstrategic plan for the country’s development to 2010,\r\nprioritizing a population development strategy within\r\nour State policy. It seeks to improve life expectancy,\r\nencourage a higher birth and to reduce maternal, infant\r\nand child mortality. Kazakhstan has implemented a\r\ngender policy concept since 2003. In seeking to resolve\r\ngender-related issues, we have actively involved a\r\nnational commission for the family and women, under\r\nthe President of the Republic of Kazakhstan. It is a\r\nreliable mechanism for implementing the State policy\r\nof protecting the political rights and legitimate interests\r\nof the family, women and children. The national\r\ncommission and the Government have been drafting a\r\nState gender-policy strategy, clearly delineating the\r\nmain areas of action, including the economic, social\r\nand political spheres. In that context, we should note\r\nthe growing role played by the non-governmental\r\norganizations in the public and political life of\r\nKazakhstan.\r\nAnd yet, despite significant progress in ensuring\r\nequal rights and opportunities for women and men, our\r\nRepublic still faces a number of problems in that area.\r\nWomen constitute almost half of the working\r\npopulation of Kazakhstan, and yet remuneration rates\r\nfor men and women differ significantly, since women\r\ntend to work in poorly-paid sectors of the economy.\r\nThus, one important aspect of drafting and adopting\r\nsolutions for improving the social status of women is\r\ntheir status in the labour market. Greater attention\r\nshould be given to the issue of enhancing the\r\nrepresentation of women among decision makers.\r\nAs has been noted, reproductive health care\r\nissues and the reduction of maternal and child\r\nmortality are top priorities for the Government of\r\nKazakhstan. In recent years, we have broadened the\r\nnetwork of State medical establishments and increased\r\npublic health funding. State programmes have been\r\nadopted to develop rural areas up to the year 2010, in\r\nwhich the emphasis is on developing social\r\ninfrastructure. We have adopted laws on reproductive\r\nrights, on enriching flour with iron derivatives and\r\nvitamins, and on the iodization of kitchen salt. All of\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nthis will, I am sure, have a positive impact on\r\nreproductive health and especially on the health of\r\nwomen and children.\r\nThe situation with regard to reproductive health\r\nis not entirely satisfactory. The female health index is\r\nrelatively low and a rather large number of women\r\nsuffer from anaemia in certain ecologically\r\ndisadvantaged regions of the country, especially in the\r\nSemipalatinsk and Aral Sea areas. That indicator is\r\nrising continuously. Maternal mortality and pregnancy\r\ncomplication rates remain high because of the\r\ninadequate availability and poor quality of prenatal\r\ncare, health care and nutrition for women.\r\nThere is a problem with HIV/AIDS infection in\r\nthe country. Women account for one quarter of those\r\ninfected and the number of children born to those\r\nwomen is growing. We are particularly concerned at\r\nthe increase in breast cancer, which has recently\r\nbecome the foremost cancer affecting women.\r\nMindful of the acute need to address those\r\nserious problems, which are directly related to\r\npopulation and development, the Government and\r\nParliament of Kazakhstan have taken robust action\r\ncomprehensively and effectively to implement the\r\nmajor decisions adopted in Cairo.\r\nIn September 2004, Kazakhstan held a summit of\r\nparliamentarians of the Asia-Pacific region.\r\nParticipants in that summit reaffirmed the commitment\r\nof the Asia-Pacific countries to implementing the\r\nundertakings of the Cairo Declaration and Programme\r\nof Action. The parliamentarians all agreed that it is\r\npossible to meet the current challenges of population\r\nand development only if those serious issues are\r\nconsidered as parts of a whole. The conference also\r\ndemonstrated that there is an urgent need to develop a\r\nlong-term strategy in the area of population and\r\nsustainable development in the countries of Asia and\r\nthe Pacific. That fact was recognized by all participants\r\nin the summit, who pledged there and then to approach\r\ntheir Governments with appropriate proposals.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to draw the\r\nAssembly’s attention to one very important point.\r\nKazakhstan today enjoys stable economic growth,\r\nessentially because of its export of energy resources. In\r\norder further to promote the country’s economic and\r\nsocial development, the Government is actively\r\ndeveloping important social, State-funded projects. To\r\nensure their successful implementation, Kazakhstan\r\nand countries of Asia and the Pacific need the expert\r\nconsultative and technical assistance of the United\r\nNations, its funds and programmes in order to\r\nconsolidate our systemic and structural progress. We\r\nhope to see the active involvement of the entire United\r\nNations system. We extend particular thanks to the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund for its ongoing\r\nassistance to my country.\r\nMr. Chuquihuara (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): It is\r\nan honour for me to address the Assembly on the\r\noccasion of the tenth anniversary of the 1994 Cairo\r\nConference. The Programme of Action of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment marked a fundamental turning point in\r\npopulation policies by making sexual and reproductive\r\nrights and health, the empowerment of women and\r\ngender equality the primary elements of development\r\nefforts, poverty reduction and the strengthening of\r\ndemocracy.\r\nPeru committed itself in Cairo to working\r\ntowards the implementation of those agreements,\r\nensuring the development of individuals’ capacities so\r\nthat they might enjoy a healthy, productive life, free of\r\nviolence, in a fair and balanced environment.\r\nOn this occasion, Peru reiterates its firm\r\ncommitment to the Cairo principles, objectives and\r\ngoals and to the agreements established in the key\r\nactions of 1999. Similarly, we emphasize the\r\nimportance of the resolute implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action in the coming decade, which is\r\nindispensable if we are to meet the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nPeru has taken basic steps towards implementing\r\nthe recommendations of the Conference. Progress has\r\nbeen made in the implementation of public population\r\nand development policies; in the recognition of\r\nreproductive rights; in meeting the sexual and\r\nreproductive health needs of the population, including\r\nthose of adolescents; in developing public policy on\r\nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic; and in combating violence\r\nagainst women.\r\nThe Cairo Programme of Action is a reference\r\npoint in the fight against poverty, in bridging the social\r\ndivide and in the process of decentralization that\r\nalready incorporates human rights, including sexual\r\nand reproductive rights; the full autonomy of women;\r\nthe recognition of the multiplicity of ethnic, racial and\r\ncultural groups; and the recognition of the different\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nforms families can take. In that process, I want to\r\nemphasize the importance of the participation of civil\r\nsociety and the support of the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) and the United Nations\r\nsystem to the implementation of the Cairo\r\nrecommendations. We have worked and will continue\r\nto work together to make Cairo a reality. The excellent\r\nleadership of Executive Director Obaid will ensure that\r\nthe goal will be met.\r\nOne of the major challenges to our country is the\r\nfight against poverty and the reduction of social\r\ninequalities — a central issue of development. In Peru,\r\n54 per cent of the population lives in poverty and we\r\nhave a high rate of maternal mortality, particularly\r\namong adolescent girls initiated into sexual life in a\r\nviolent way or as a result of sexual abuse. Such\r\nchildren generally come from sectors that suffer the\r\ngreatest exclusion. We are also redoubling our efforts\r\nto combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic and violence\r\nagainst women.\r\nIn that context, Peru participated actively this\r\nyear in the regional processes to review the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action that were\r\nheld in Santiago, Chile, and in Puerto Rico on the\r\noccasion of the tenth anniversary. At both events, the\r\nLatin American and Caribbean region reaffirmed Cairo\r\nand the need to work together to implement its\r\nprinciples in the coming decade. We make special note\r\nof the outstanding work of Ms. Marisela Padron,\r\nDirector of the Latin American and Caribbean division\r\nof UNFPA, in organizing and preparing for those\r\nevents.\r\nPeru recognizes that, while we have made\r\nprogress in the implementation of the Programme,\r\nmuch remains to be done. In that regard, I appeal to the\r\ninternational donor community to ensure the\r\nimplementation of the programme in the certainty that\r\nour countries attach equal importance to the\r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to say that it has been an\r\nhonour for my Government and for me personally to\r\npreside over the Commission on Population and\r\nDevelopment this year, in which we celebrate the tenth\r\nanniversary of the Cairo Conference. The Commission\r\non Population and Development reaffirmed the\r\nprinciples and agreements of the International\r\nConference on Population and Development and the\r\nkey actions as representing an effective effort to\r\nimplement the Millennium Development Goals. We\r\nbelieve that we have contributed significantly to\r\nconsolidating the work of the past 10 years and to\r\nensuring the viability of concerted work for the decade\r\nto come.\r\nMr. Wang Guoqiang (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nAt the outset, on behalf of the Chinese delegation I\r\nwould like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at this session. We\r\nalso wish to express our appreciation for the convening\r\nof this event commemorating the tenth anniversary of\r\nthe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD).\r\nThe Chinese delegation associates itself with the\r\nstatement made by the representative of Qatar on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe 1994 Cairo ICPD and its Programme of\r\nAction put forward such new concepts as all-round\r\nhuman-centred development and reproductive health\r\nand set the goal of sustainable development\r\ncoordinated between population and economy, society,\r\nresources and environment, thus ushering in a new era\r\nof population and development programmes. In 2000,\r\nthe Millennium Summit adopted the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, which established the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. The ICPD Programme of Action\r\nand the Millennium Development Goals are closely\r\nrelated to each other and mutually promoting. As\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has said, the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, especially the goal of\r\neradicating poverty and hunger, cannot be achieved if\r\nquestions of population and reproductive health are not\r\nsquarely addressed.\r\nProceeding from China’s national realities, the\r\nChinese Government over the past decade has earnestly\r\nhonoured its commitments to the Cairo Programme of\r\nAction and the Millennium Development Goals. By\r\nadopting a decision-making strategy that integrates\r\npopulation and development, China has made distinct\r\nachievements in its population and development\r\nundertakings. Despite an economy that is still\r\nunderdeveloped, China has effectively controlled\r\nexcessive population growth, reduced its fertility rates\r\nto below the replacement rate, achieved an historical\r\ntransformation of its population reproduction pattern,\r\nand vigorously enhanced its integrated national\r\nstrength, social progress and the standard of living of\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nits people, thereby making a positive contribution to\r\nstabilizing the world’s population.\r\nTo begin with, China has focused on economic\r\ndevelopment by accelerating the establishment and\r\nimprovement of a socialist market economy, which has\r\nlaid a solid material foundation for social progress and\r\nimproved living standards.\r\nSecondly, China has adhered to its fundamental\r\nnational family planning policy and its sustainable\r\ndevelopment strategy, and properly balanced the\r\nrelationship between socio-economic development and\r\npopulation, resources and the environment. The\r\nChinese Government convenes symposiums on\r\npopulation, resources and the environment each year in\r\norder to undertake comprehensive research and the\r\ncoordinated delegation of relevant work.\r\nThirdly, The Chinese Government has\r\nenthusiastically drawn upon advanced international\r\nphilosophies and experiences and integrated them into\r\nthe Chinese reform and implementation of population\r\nand family planning programmes. China has set up a\r\nbenefit-orientated mechanism and a social security\r\nsystem that are conducive to its family planning cause.\r\nOver the past decade, the fertility rate for mothers and\r\ninfant mortality have been on the decline and universal\r\naccess to adolescent sexual and reproductive health\r\neducation enhanced. The Government has provided the\r\npublic with services and benefits through its family\r\nplanning and reproductive health programmes, which\r\nin turn have led to increased public satisfaction with\r\nsuch services.\r\nFourthly, China has adhered to integrated\r\ndecision-making and to ensuring coordinated progress\r\nin terms of population control, poverty alleviation and\r\ndevelopment. By 2003, China had already achieved the\r\nMillennium Development Goal of halving the number\r\nof people living in extreme poverty, ahead of the\r\nUnited Nations schedule.\r\nFifthly, the Chinese Government has placed\r\neducation on its list of priorities for development. In\r\n2000, China achieved, as scheduled, universal nine-\r\nyear compulsory education and the elimination of\r\nilliteracy among people in their prime years.\r\nSixthly, China has boosted its international\r\ncommunication and cooperation in the field of\r\npopulation and development. In 1997, China joined the\r\nSouth-South Partners in Population and Development\r\nand was elected Chair of the Partners in 2002, playing\r\nan active role in promoting intergovernmental\r\ncooperation among the Partners.\r\nChina has also carried out multiple cooperation\r\nprojects with international organizations and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in the fields of population,\r\nfamily planning and reproductive health. In particular,\r\nChina has completed a five-stage country programme\r\nin family planning and reproductive health, in\r\ncooperation with the United Nations Population Fund,\r\nwhich has played a very constructive role in promoting\r\nour population and family planning programme.\r\nDespite the remarkable achievements of its\r\npopulation and family planning programmes, China is\r\nstill encountering numerous difficulties and challenges\r\non its path to the ultimate realization of the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action objectives and the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Such problems as the coexistence\r\nof low fertility and large quantitative population\r\ngrowth, and the general backwardness of the\r\npopulation will remain constraints for China for some\r\ntime to come. At the same time, China is increasingly\r\nfrustrated by its structural population problems, the\r\nacceleration of population ageing and the unbalanced\r\nsex ratio at birth, which are still beyond effective\r\ncontrol. Those problems exacerbate employment, re-\r\nemployment and social security pressures; the conflict\r\nof interests between the ecology, the environment,\r\nnatural resources and socio-economic development; the\r\nstill arduous task of eradicating poverty and closing\r\nregional gaps; the further advancement of the status of\r\nwomen; and the protracted task of HIV/AIDS\r\nprevention and control.\r\nMoreover, family planning and reproductive\r\nhealth services have failed to fully and effectively\r\ncover the underdeveloped regions, adolescents, the\r\nelderly and the migrant population. The coordinating\r\nmechanisms of the Government, the business\r\ncommunity and non-governmental organizations need\r\nfurther integration with public resources.\r\nFaced with all those challenges, the Chinese\r\nGovernment has set itself the goal of building a\r\nprosperous society on all fronts in the new millennium.\r\nTo that end, the Chinese Government has adopted a\r\nscientific development strategy that features a\r\ncomprehensive, integrated, human-centred and\r\nsustainable approach to development. The core of the\r\nconcept is orientation towards all-round human\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\ndevelopment, which will promote harmonious\r\ncoexistence between man and nature and coordination\r\nbetween socio-economic development and population,\r\nresources and the environment.\r\nThe Chinese Government and the Partners\r\nrecently held a successful international conference on\r\npopulation and development in Wuhan, China,\r\nadopting the Yangtze declaration. The declaration\r\nrepresents the voice of people in the South, who\r\naccount for 54 per cent of the global population. With\r\n“Peace, Cooperation and Development” as its theme,\r\nthe declaration embraces the spirit of sustainable\r\nhuman development, thereby winning the respect,\r\ncommitment and support of all members of the\r\nPartners. The declaration has been distributed to\r\ndelegations.\r\nThe declaration emphasizes that the population\r\nissue in developing countries remains a severe\r\nconstraint on socio-economic development. The\r\nPartners call upon the international community to\r\ninclude population and reproductive health on\r\nimportant international agendas with a view to\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. The\r\ndeclaration also appeals to developed countries for\r\nincreased official development assistance to\r\ndeveloping countries in the areas of family planning\r\nand reproductive health. It further calls on the\r\ndeveloping countries to increase their investment and\r\nenhance their management capacity in population and\r\ndevelopment so as to fulfil their commitments under\r\nthe Cairo Programme of Action and to promote the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nAs a member of the Partners, China will continue\r\nto honour its obligations as Chair of the alliance and\r\nshall work relentlessly to further promote\r\nintergovernmental cooperation and communication\r\namong members of the Partners, facilitate South-North\r\ndialogue and cooperation, and implement the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action, the Millennium Development\r\nGoals and the Yangtze declaration.\r\nWhile engaging in international affairs, the\r\nChinese Government has always strongly felt that\r\ncoexistence, sharing and “win-win” situations are the\r\ncommon objectives and ideals of humankind.\r\nCoexistence is a prerequisite for the continuous\r\nadvancement of human society. Large or small, rich or\r\npoor, strong or weak, all countries should enjoy equal\r\nparticipation and sufficient decision-making power in\r\ninternational affairs. Sharing is the means for mankind\r\nto achieve common prosperity.\r\nSo long as world peace remains indispensable to\r\nthe stability of developing countries, there will be no\r\nglobal prosperity without the all-round development of\r\ndeveloping countries. Developed countries have the\r\nresponsibility and the obligation to assist the\r\ndeveloping world. Efforts should be made to ensure\r\nthat all countries and peoples enjoy equal development\r\nopportunities and share the prosperity brought about by\r\nglobal development in an equitable and rational\r\nmanner.\r\nThe “win-win” scenario is the goal of human\r\nsociety for progress on all fronts. Only when each and\r\nevery country in the world has fulfilled the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action and the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals will the twenty-first century truly\r\nbecome the century of development for all.\r\nThe Partners and the Chinese Government will\r\ncontinue to fulfil their commitment to the international\r\ncommunity. We will uphold the banner of peace,\r\nharmony, cooperation and development, adhere to the\r\npath of peaceful development, and enhance and expand\r\nour communication and cooperation with all countries\r\nand regions of the world, in line with the principles of\r\nequality and mutual benefit, a results-oriented\r\napproach, long-term cooperation and common\r\ndevelopment. We will join the international community\r\nin its efforts to strive for the peace, prosperity and\r\nprogress of mankind.\r\nMs. Benjamin (South Africa): First, allow me to\r\nassociate my delegation with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77.\r\nMy delegation is honoured to address this special\r\ncommemoration of the tenth anniversary of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD). We express our appreciation to\r\nMs. Thoraya Obaid, Under-Secretary-General and\r\nExecutive Director of the United Nations Population\r\nFund, for her leadership on population issues.\r\nThe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment was the first major international\r\nConference in which South Africa participated\r\nfollowing our democratic elections in April 1994, and\r\nwe contributed to the formulation of the ICPD\r\nProgramme of Action, which we endorsed. South\r\nAfrica reaffirms its support for the ICPD Programme\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nof Action and the key actions for the further\r\nimplementation of the ICPD. As a country, we continue\r\nto measure our progress of the past 10 years by how we\r\nimplement the outcomes of the ICPD. In March 2004,\r\nwe presented South Africa’s report on the\r\nimplementation of the Programme to the United\r\nNations Commission on Population and Development\r\nand there are some copies available here today.\r\nFor us in Africa, the issues of population — such\r\nas women’s reproductive rights and health, gender\r\nequality, equity and development, the care and\r\nprotection of children and youth empowerment —\r\nremain extremely important. We come from a continent\r\nwhere underdevelopment remains a reality for millions\r\nof our people, particularly in rural areas, and the role\r\nof women and youth in poverty eradication is critical.\r\nIn preparation for our meetings in New York,\r\nSouth Africa participated in several meetings on\r\npopulation at which important declarations were\r\nadopted. In May 2004, our subregion organized the\r\nSouthern African Ministers Conference on Population\r\nand Development in Maputo, Mozambique. In June\r\n2004, we attended the African Ministers Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development held in Dakar, Senegal.\r\nAnd last week, the South African Government, in\r\ncollaboration with the scientific community, hosted a\r\nnational joint population conference, at which we\r\nrecommitted ourselves to the implementation of the\r\nICPD Programme of Action.\r\nWe gather here today in order to reflect on a\r\ndecade during which poverty reduction, women’s\r\nrights, reproductive health and sustainable\r\ndevelopment have received the attention of many of the\r\nleaders of the world and of nations. During that period,\r\nwe adopted the Millennium Development Goals as a\r\nframework that integrates the objectives of many\r\nsectoral programmes of the United Nations.\r\nNonetheless, we remain concerned that many\r\ndeveloping countries, including a large number in\r\nAfrica, may not be able to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nWe do recognize, however, the progress that was\r\nreported in this year’s “State of the World Population\r\nReport”. Particularly, we note the many legislative,\r\npolicy and institutional reforms that resulted from the\r\ncommitment of countries to the ICPD Programme of\r\nAction. It has also been reconfirmed that human rights\r\nremain fundamental to the achievement of sustainable\r\nhuman development, together with the empowerment\r\nof women.\r\nThe South African Constitution guarantees\r\nhuman rights, entrenches gender equality, protects the\r\nreproductive freedom of couples, and promotes the\r\nsocial and economic development of our people. As a\r\nresult, our population is becoming more educated;\r\nhealth care is becoming more accessible; more people\r\nlive in formal houses and have access to electricity,\r\nclean water and sanitation; and a wider choice of\r\ncontraceptives is more freely available. In 2001, our\r\nadult literacy rate was 89 per cent and we are working\r\ntowards universal literacy amongst our youth. South\r\nAfrican women are more literate and generally more\r\neducated than men. As a result of our investments in\r\npeople, the total fertility rate is now estimated to be\r\n2.77 children per woman in her reproductive years,\r\ndown from a total fertility rate estimated at almost four\r\na decade ago.\r\nDespite the success we have had in the\r\nimplementation of the ICPD Programme of Action, we\r\ndo acknowledge that many challenges remain and that\r\neven new ones have emerged in the past ten years. The\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic has become one of the world’s\r\nmost daunting population and development challenges.\r\nIn southern Africa, it has led to a decline in life\r\nexpectancy and has taken the lives of young and\r\nproductive adults. In connection with the pandemic,\r\nmany of the countries in our region and continent are\r\nstill struggling to reduce maternal, child and infant\r\nmortality and morbidity, in spite of large investments\r\nto improve mother and child health services. We are\r\naware that we must redouble our efforts through\r\ncomprehensive reproductive health services, the\r\npromotion of reproductive rights, gender equality and\r\nequity, and the empowerment of women. Extending\r\nthose services to adolescents has become even more\r\nurgent. Nevertheless, we also know that we cannot\r\nexperience any greater achievements without the\r\nsupport of the international community.\r\nDuring the thirty-seventh session of the\r\nCommission on Population and Development held\r\nearlier this year, a resolution was adopted highlighting\r\nthe need for sufficient resources to address the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action. An\r\nappeal was made for additional resources to developing\r\ncountries so as to ensure the effective implementation\r\nof the Programme of Action. We hope that the 10-year\r\nreview of ICPD will present an opportunity for the\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\ndonors to live up to their pledges. In that regard, my\r\ndelegation commends the European Union for its\r\ndecision to fill the entire reproductive health\r\ncommodities gap of $75 million for 2004, as\r\nannounced this morning.\r\nAs I indicated at the beginning of my statement,\r\nSouth Africa is celebrating 10 years of democracy that\r\ncoincide with our involvement in implementing the\r\nICPD Programme of Action. We are consciously aware\r\nthat we must pursue population and development\r\nobjectives through the United Nations and other\r\nmultilateral organizations, including the African Union\r\nand the Southern African Development Community.\r\nThe issues of population and development require a\r\nglobal response. We are determined to intensify our\r\ncollaboration with our partners in addressing the\r\nchallenges we face. Those challenges can be met only\r\nif all the people who live on our beautiful planet have a\r\nshare in them.\r\nMs. El-Baz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, on this important occasion, to which we have\r\ncome from throughout the world, East and West, South\r\nand North, to celebrate together and to assess,\r\nindividually and collectively, our achievements 10\r\nyears after the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development, I should like to congratulate you,\r\nSir, on your election to your important post.\r\nI also congratulate the Executive Director of the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) on the\r\nstatement she made this morning.\r\nWhile every delegation at this important event\r\nhas the right to speak about its national experience, the\r\ndelegation of Egypt has more than one reason to be\r\ngrateful and proud to participate in today’s\r\ncommemoration. Our first reason is the fact that, in\r\n1994, Egypt hosted the historic International\r\nConference on Population and Development, with all\r\nthe participating personalities and experiences that\r\nwere mobilized for its new ideas, plans and beneficial\r\nprogrammes. Our second reason is that Egypt’s\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the Conference and\r\nits approach to its population and development\r\nproblems in general have been exemplary experiences.\r\nThe 1994 Cairo Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction introduced a qualitative shift in the way issues\r\nof population and development are tackled. The\r\nconcept of human development was introduced where\r\nonce such issues were discussed solely on the basis\r\nconventional demographic indicators. Perhaps the most\r\nimportant result of the Cairo Conference 10 years ago\r\nhas been the integration of the concepts of liberation,\r\nempowerment and maximum employment for human\r\ncapabilities as pivotal axes for progress in the field of\r\npopulation and development.\r\nEgypt has been implementing the Programme of\r\nAction and has committed itself to carrying out\r\npopulation programmes and policies for human\r\ndevelopment, taking into consideration the specificity\r\nand social and cultural circumstances of Egyptian\r\nsociety. In conformity with the Cairo Programme of\r\nAction, we promote full respect for all moral and\r\nreligious values, in accordance with internationally\r\nrecognized human rights.\r\nOf course, challenges and requirements remain in\r\nthe full implementation of the Programme of Action,\r\nbut we have registered much progress and\r\nimprovements in some indicators, such as a reduction\r\nin fertility and in child and maternal mortality, and\r\nincreased resort to family planning. Moreover,\r\ncomprehensive reproductive health care has been\r\nintegrated into primary health-care units and great\r\nattention to quality care has been given to health care\r\nfor adults and the most vulnerable and marginalized\r\nsectors. We have programmes to eradicate illiteracy\r\nand a plan to lower the school drop-out rate, especially\r\nfor girls. The year 2003 was declared the Year of the\r\nEgyptian Girl, and an initiative for educating girls in\r\nrural and poor urban areas has been launched.\r\nFurthermore, Egypt’s population strategy has sought to\r\nclose the qualitative educational gap between boys and\r\ngirls and many measures and decisions have been taken\r\nto prevent the circumcision of girls in order to protect\r\nthem from forms of violence and indignity.\r\nEgypt also established a higher national women’s\r\ncouncil in 2000 for the advancement of women.\r\nAmong its achievement are its support for women\r\nheads of households and training them to manage small\r\nenterprises, its promotion of women’s participation in\r\npolitics, its amendment of the citizenship law in order\r\nto give citizenship to the children of Egyptian mothers\r\nin mixed marriages, the establishment of specialized\r\nfamily courts, and making women eligible to become\r\njudges.\r\nDespite all those achievements and successes in\r\nthe implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action,\r\nmany challenges and difficulties remain that require\r\n29\r\nA/59/PV.30\r\nbold treatment and technical assistance. Those\r\nchallenges include the economic and financial\r\nconstraints on the expansion of family planning and\r\nreproductive health care, the improvement of\r\neducation, women’s employment and health care for\r\nmothers, infants, the elderly and the disabled. Despite\r\nthe contributions of several national, regional and\r\ninternational organizations and donor agencies, and\r\nincreased contributions from the private and business\r\nsectors, we still need a great deal of financial resources\r\nand technical assistance. Moreover, the conservative\r\ncultural environment in certain regions of the country\r\nhas hindered the necessary expansion of some\r\nprogrammes, especially those related to family\r\nplanning and the empowerment of women, work, and\r\nissues related to reproductive health and rights. The\r\nadministrative environment and institutional capacities\r\nwill also play a role in achieving the required progress.\r\nWe have noted the importance of coordination\r\namong institutions, especially those working in human\r\nresource development, population planning, and data\r\ncollection and analysis. On the other hand, we have\r\nalso noted the need to keep the legislative councils,\r\ncivil society and youth involved.\r\nI have offered a few highlights of the Egyptian\r\nexperience in human development and population. It is\r\nthe outcome of the efforts of national institutions,\r\ntogether with the active help and continuous efforts of\r\nthe UNFPA office in Cairo. We are confident that such\r\ncooperation will continue and that we will be able to\r\nimplement the Programme of Action and to integrate\r\nits elements with those of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals.\r\nIn that respect, Egypt attaches great importance\r\nto the review event to be held in September 2005 and\r\nlooks forward to contributing to the follow-up to the\r\nCairo Conference so that we can achieve our common\r\nobjectives. There can be no doubt that those objectives\r\ncoincide with the policies of our country in its general\r\ndevelopment plans and population programmes. We are\r\nhopeful that our meeting 10 years from now will crown\r\ntwo decades of ongoing work in the service of\r\npopulation, which primarily is in the interests of the\r\nindividual, society and humankind as a whole.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
