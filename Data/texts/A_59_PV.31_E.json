(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 45 (continued)\r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of and\r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United\r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic,\r\nsocial and related fields: commemoration of the tenth\r\nanniversary of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development\r\nMs. Arjoso (Indonesia): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing my delegation’s appreciation to the United\r\nNations, especially the United Nations Population\r\nFund (UNFPA), for convening this important meeting\r\nto commemorate a decade of implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action of the International Conference\r\non Population and Development, held in Cairo in 1994.\r\nMy country has always been a strong supporter of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD) Programme of Action.\r\nThis meeting serves as a keystone to maintain the\r\nmomentum of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development. I am very happy to know\r\nthat many world leaders, including the President of the\r\nRepublic of Indonesia, Megawati Soekarnoputri, have\r\nreaffirmed the vision that was set forth in the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action. The signatures of key leaders in\r\nthe social, scientific and political sectors will help to\r\nmaintain the momentum and reaffirm the dedication to\r\nachieving the ICPD’s goals. I know that all of us are\r\neager to participate in a substantive, action-oriented\r\nmeeting and to discuss the challenges and obstacles\r\nthat remain. Its outcome should reflect a frank\r\nassessment not only of the progress made in\r\nimplementing the ICPD Programme of Action, but also\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals strategies,\r\nwhich, in my view, have strong linkages to\r\nreproductive and family planning goals.\r\nI would now like to share our experiences in the\r\nefforts that have been made by the Indonesian\r\nGovernment in implementing the ICPD Programme of\r\nAction. The details of my full report are presented in\r\nthe Indonesia country report, copies of which, I\r\nbelieve, are available in this Hall. I shall not dwell too\r\nlong on the report, but I would highlight some of its\r\nsalient features.\r\nSince the ICPD in 1994, Indonesia’s policies on\r\npopulation have taken a more people- and family-\r\ncentred approach, with particular attention on poverty\r\nalleviation as the central challenge for development\r\nefforts. Rather than concentrate solely on demographic\r\nobjectives, population policies in Indonesia emphasize\r\nthe importance of human and family development,\r\nchanging attitudes towards reproduction and the client-\r\ncentred provision of high-quality family planning\r\ninformation and services to achieve sustained\r\neconomic growth within the context of sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nFamily planning is an integral part of the\r\ncountry’s overall reproductive health agenda and its\r\nprogrammes address the full range of reproductive\r\nhealth dimensions, including safe motherhood. The\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nprogrammes address such critical areas as quality of\r\ncare in reproductive health care services, the demand-\r\nfulfilment approach, the prevention of sexually-\r\ntransmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS, the education of\r\nyouth regarding reproductive health and family well-\r\nbeing, research and data collection on reproductive\r\nhealth, and the promotion of women’s empowerment.\r\nTen years ago, around 179 heads of State or\r\nGovernment, including from my Government, pledged\r\nto improve the quality of life of women and families by\r\nproviding access to family planning, reproductive\r\nhealth care, education, a clean environment and\r\nreproductive rights under our long-term goal to achieve\r\nsustainable development. Ten years later, we can say\r\nthat significant progress has been made in Indonesia.\r\nIn Indonesia, a girl born today has better\r\nprospects than a girl who was born 10 years ago.\r\nSchool enrolment rates, especially for women, are\r\nincreasing and life expectancy is on the rise. There has\r\nbeen considerable improvement in the condition and\r\nposition of women in Indonesia. Women’s issues are\r\nreceiving more attention and have become more\r\nvisible, including issues pertaining to adolescents and\r\ngirl children.\r\nHowever, major obstacles to gender equality,\r\nequity and empowerment remain. Currently, the\r\nproblematic issues include a high maternal mortality,\r\nthe gender gap in education, especially in intermediate\r\nand higher education, domestic violence, trafficking in\r\nwomen and girls, and lack of protection for the rights\r\nof employed women, particularly those who work\r\noverseas. Indonesia is also beginning to see the end of\r\nrapid population growth and its fertility rate is now\r\nclose to replacement level. The total fertility rate is\r\nnow 2.6. Infant and maternal mortality rates are\r\ndeclining in most provinces. The latest data indicate\r\nthat, in 2002, the infant mortality rate in Indonesia was\r\n35 per 1,000 live births, while the maternal mortality\r\nrate was 307 per 100,000 live births.\r\nInternal and international migration is becoming\r\nan alarming issue, as is its impact on urbanization.\r\nOur family planning programme contributes to\r\nsubstantial progress in decelerating population growth\r\nand has brought the fertility rate close to the\r\nreplacement level. In the area of adolescent\r\nreproductive health, we have been successful in\r\nintegrating related issues into the national development\r\nstrategy. The main focus of the programme is to\r\nprovide adolescent girls and boys with reproductive\r\nhealth information and counselling related to gender\r\nequality, responsible sexual behaviour, the prevention\r\nof unwanted pregnancy through the school system,\r\ngroup empowerment and youth centres.\r\nEfforts to achieve reproductive health goals are\r\nchallenged by a number of factors, but none is as\r\ndevastating as the global epidemic of HIV/AIDS. We\r\nare seeing alarming increases in the number of\r\ninfections and projections for the future are troubling.\r\nOn international collaboration, Indonesia is one\r\nof the founders and continues to support the work of\r\nPartners in Population and Development in South-\r\nSouth cooperation. That initiative is considered to be a\r\nsuccessful modality among countries of the South and\r\nprovides an avenue for assistance from the countries of\r\nthe North. Such cooperation, however, will need to be\r\nstrengthened by the substantive assistance of related\r\ninternational partners, in particular within the United\r\nNations system, and from international donors.\r\nMuch more needs to be done. Nothing\r\ndemonstrates the urgent need for greater action than\r\nthe issue of safe motherhood in Indonesia. Today,\r\nevery 15 minutes a mother is separated from her\r\nbeloved children and husband. She dies in childbirth or\r\nfrom complications of pregnancy, especially\r\nhaemorrhaging, infection or sepsis, unsafe abortion,\r\neclampsia, or obstructed labour that requires treatment\r\nat a hospital. Over 20 per cent of women die as a result\r\nof diseases that are aggravated by pregnancy. That\r\ntragedy results in 18,000 deaths every year in\r\nIndonesia, leaving a devastating void in families,\r\ncommunities and the entire nation.\r\nYet, there seems to be a solution. Ten years ago,\r\n179 Governments committed themselves to the ICPD\r\nProgramme of Action. The ICPD prescribes the steps\r\nthat will not only save millions of women’s lives, but\r\nwill empower individuals to achieve a better future.\r\nUniversal access to education and sexual and\r\nreproductive health services are the primary goals.\r\nThe complex challenge requires comprehensive\r\npolicy measures to focus on maternal mortality rate\r\nreduction. For example, there is a need for policies that\r\nfocus on health sector involvement in reducing\r\nmaternal mortality and morbidity. National policies and\r\nprogrammes for reducing maternal mortality are based\r\non the Making Pregnancy Safer initiative of the World\r\nHealth Organization.\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nThus, high on the agenda of national safe\r\nmotherhood is the guarantee that women have access to\r\nfamily planning services to reduce unwanted\r\npregnancies, improve the overall quality and capacity\r\nof the country’s health systems, especially at the\r\ndistrict level, and strengthen human resources. Some\r\nprogrammes are specifically directed at male\r\ninvolvement in reducing maternal death. Indonesia\r\nensures that all women and adolescent girls have the\r\nknowledge and means to prevent HIV infection and\r\nthat men are supportive partners. Indonesia has also\r\nreduced the vulnerability of women and girls by\r\nincreasing respect for their human rights and by\r\nconfronting gender discrimination and violence.\r\nIn mid-1997, the economic crisis gravely affected\r\nIndonesia’s ability to carry out its ICPD commitments.\r\nThe attainment of the goals and objectives of the\r\nProgramme of Action, as well as those of other United\r\nNations conferences, became increasingly uncertain at\r\nthat time. However, as the international community is\r\nfully aware, the sheer fact of Indonesia’s being the\r\nworld’s fourth most populous country was of global\r\nconcern. Thanks to many donors, including the United\r\nNations Population Fund, the World Bank, the Asian\r\nDevelopment Bank, the United States Agency for\r\nInternational Development, the Canadian International\r\nDevelopment Agency, the Australian Agency for\r\nInternational Development and other providers of\r\nassistance, the adverse impact of the economic crisis,\r\nespecially in the reproductive and family planning\r\nprogrammes, was mitigated to a certain extent. Indeed,\r\nwithout significant help, those programmes would have\r\nbeen impossible to achieve.\r\nIndonesia regards this as a great learning\r\nexperience, appreciating how the international\r\ncommunity can reaffirm and recommit itself to the\r\nICPD goals.\r\nBefore I conclude my remarks, I would like to\r\nreiterate once again that the ICPD Programme of\r\nAction is not up for renegotiation until the year 2015.\r\nThere is no reason to slow down the implementation of\r\nthe ICPD, since to do so would seriously impact our\r\nsocial and economic development and our achievement\r\nof sustainable development. We can modify our\r\nstrategies by implementing more coordinated, effective\r\nand efficient intervention to achieve the ICPD goals.\r\nIn conclusion, I would just like to say that, since\r\nthe theme of Cairo strongly underlined the linkages\r\nbetween population concerns and sustained economic\r\ngrowth and sustainable development, it is important\r\nthat a special session to commemorate the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action of the\r\nConference 10 years down the road concentrate on\r\nregenerating the momentum of the Cairo Conference at\r\nthis historical period, while our world is being\r\npropelled into the new millennium.\r\nMr. Mwenifumbo (Malawi): I would like to\r\nassociate my delegation with the statement delivered\r\nby the representative of Qatar on behalf of the Group\r\nof 77 and China.\r\nMy delegation would like to join previous\r\nspeakers in congratulating you, Sir, on presiding over\r\nthis important commemoration of the tenth anniversary\r\nof the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD). Our appreciation also goes to the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund for ably organizing all\r\nthe activities, including the very enlightening round\r\ntable discussions on the issue at hand.\r\nThe Government of Malawi attaches great\r\nimportance to the implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction of the ICPD. For Malawi, the Programme of\r\nAction presents a comprehensive basis for national and\r\ninternational action on population issues. It is in that\r\nrespect that we welcome wholeheartedly this\r\nopportunity to take stock of the achievements and\r\nfuture challenges in terms of population and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMy Government has been preoccupied with\r\ninitiatives aimed at improving the quality of life and\r\nliving standards of our people. We have therefore\r\naligned ourselves with all international and regional\r\nconventions and declarations on population and\r\nsustainable development, which place critical focus on\r\nsustainable socio-economic development.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nMalawi’s population is currently estimated at\r\nabout 12 million and is growing at an average annual\r\nrate of 1.9 per cent, according to the 1998 population\r\nand housing census. About 3.5 per cent of its\r\npopulation live in poverty. The country has made\r\nefforts to reduce poverty levels, allocating a significant\r\npercentage of its budget to social sectors.\r\nOn the population front, Malawi has formulated\r\nand adopted a national population policy, the\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nimplementation of which is in progress. A poverty\r\nreduction strategy has also been formulated as one\r\nfundamental aspect of achieving sustainable socio-\r\neconomic development in the country. Further, a policy\r\non gender and development has been adopted.\r\nFollowing the adoption of the policy, some\r\ndiscriminatory legislation and practices against women\r\nhave been addressed. In addition, some reproductive\r\nhealth concerns and the special problems of the girl\r\nchild have been raised for further action.\r\nIn recent years, the Malawi Government has\r\nincreased its collaboration with non-governmental\r\norganizations and civil society in the implementation,\r\nmonitoring and evaluation of population-related\r\nprogrammes, policies and guidelines. We have seen\r\nmore integration of population issues into development\r\nplanning and increased advocacy and information,\r\neducation and communication at all levels, including\r\nthe media. Efforts to decentralize the national\r\npopulation policy have been stepped up through work\r\nwith districts and the grassroots, especially in the areas\r\nof reproductive health services, gender, education in\r\nprimary and secondary schools, works and\r\nmaintenance, environment, water and sanitation.\r\nThe contraceptive prevalence rate is now\r\nestimated at 26 per cent. That has contributed to a\r\ndecline in the total fertility rate from 6.7 in 1992 to the\r\ncurrent level of 6.3. The maternal mortality rate now\r\nstands at 1,120 per 100,000 live births, up from 620 per\r\n100,000 live births in 1992. Thus, it would have been\r\neasier to achieve the Millennium Development Goal\r\ntarget at the 1992 levels. The challenge of achieving\r\nthe objective of maternal mortality rate reduction has\r\nnearly doubled in the case of Malawi.\r\nAmong other elements, the delinking of\r\nHIV/AIDS from reproductive health, the attrition of\r\nstudent nurses, and nurses leaving the country for\r\ngreener pastures in the Western countries — especially\r\nthe United Kingdom — are big challenges that have\r\ncontributed to the worsening scenario. To respond to\r\nthe attrition problem, the Government, through the\r\nMinistry of Health, has introduced a crash programme\r\nwhereby nurses are trained for six months and then\r\nsent to hospitals. They are not fully qualified and\r\nmothers may not get top-quality services.\r\nThe child mortality rate now stands at 189 per\r\n1,000 live births, down from 234 per 1,000 live births\r\nin 1992. The infant mortality rate is now at 104 per\r\n1,000 live births, down from 134 per 1,000 in 1992.\r\nMalawi remains greatly challenged by the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic. HIV/AIDS has negatively\r\nimpacted mortality rates, especially for the adult age\r\ngroups, as demonstrated by a worsening maternal\r\nmortality rate, thereby leading to reduced life\r\nexpectancy at birth from 43 years in 1996 to 39 years\r\nin 2000. The HIV/AIDS prevalence rate for the 15-49\r\nage group is estimated at 16 per cent nationally. In\r\ngeneral, some progress has been made. However, we\r\nstill have a lot of ground to cover to reach the goals of\r\nthe ICPD and the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nIn the remaining 10 years of the Programme of\r\nAction, Malawi will redouble its efforts on the\r\nreduction of poverty, the HIV/AIDS burden, and infant\r\nand maternal mortality rates. Other critical areas of\r\nfocus include the strengthening of adolescent\r\nreproductive health services and the intensification of\r\nfamily planning and safe motherhood interventions. We\r\nstrongly believe that the provision of universal access\r\nto quality education, especially for girls, presents a\r\nstep in the right direction towards achieving the goals\r\nof the Programme of Action. Malawi will continue to\r\napply gender mainstreaming as a strategy in all\r\npopulation-related interventions.\r\nAs a developing country, we remain challenged\r\nby the question of resources for the full\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action, as well as\r\nthe full integration of population issues into the\r\npoverty reduction strategy. We also need to address the\r\ncultural and traditional practices that impact negatively\r\non reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, gender issues,\r\nemployment, wealth distribution and overall socio-\r\neconomic development. It is clear that the many\r\ncomplex and challenging issues of population cannot\r\nbe addressed by Governments alone. Therefore,\r\nMalawi respectfully calls upon the development\r\npartners to strengthen their technical and financial\r\nassistance to our nations as we attempt to implement\r\nthe recommendations of the ICPD and the Programme\r\nof Action. The worsening indicators, which place most\r\nof our countries far from achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, also call for increased resources\r\nfrom our development partners towards the\r\nimplementation of the ICPD and the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015.\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nAt the regional level, Malawi is the current chair\r\nof the Southern African Forum for Population and\r\nDevelopment (SAFPAD). SAFPAD was formed in\r\n1996 as a platform for Government officials in the\r\nSouthern African Development Community and\r\nMadagascar to consider population and development\r\nissues of interest and priority to member States.\r\nThrough SAFPAD, some progress has been made at the\r\nregional level. The purpose of the establishment of that\r\nforum was to monitor progress in the implementation\r\nof the Dakar/Ngor declaration and the ICPD\r\nProgramme of Action, as well as of resolutions adopted\r\nat the regional level. There has been significant\r\nprogress made on the issues of population and\r\ndevelopment, especially in the organization of the 1994\r\nprogramme of work of the ICPD, among others.\r\nAll countries in the forum have now formulated\r\nand adopted national population policies and their\r\nimplementation is in progress. They have developed\r\npoverty reduction strategies as a fundamental aspect of\r\nachieving sustainable social and economic\r\ndevelopment in their countries. Member States have\r\ndeveloped policies on gender and development and\r\nreviewed discriminatory policies and legislation\r\nagainst women, programmes for the positive imaging\r\nof the girl child, and educational policies to allow girls\r\nwho drop out of school due to pregnancy to continue\r\ntheir education.\r\nHowever, the indicators of most of our countries\r\nare far from achieving the Millennium Development\r\nGoals and the ICPD. Extra efforts among ourselves and\r\nthe continued commitment of our development partners\r\nin financial and technical support are called for.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to appeal for continued commitment to the\r\nmajor population challenges facing our respective\r\ncountries. Malawi is also ready to continue to share its\r\nexperience with partners at the regional and\r\ninternational levels. Achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals requires serious commitments on\r\nthe part of the Government and its development\r\npartners in allocating adequate resources and\r\naddressing the resource gaps, as well as in developing\r\nprogrammes and strategies that will assist in the\r\nattainment of the Goals.\r\nAs far as the current status of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals is concerned in the case of Malawi\r\nand SAFPAD, only two — access to potable water and\r\nreducing under-five mortality — can be conceived as\r\nachievable with minimum changes in policy and\r\nresource allocation. Reducing maternal mortality and\r\neliminating poverty are the most difficult Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals to achieve and require special\r\nattention and resource allocation. The slow pace of\r\nfostering behavioural change is also making the\r\nimmediate reduction in HIV infection rates difficult to\r\nattain. In general, the other five Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals are achievable only with radical\r\nchanges in policies, attitudes and mindsets, and\r\npolitical and technical commitment.\r\nMr. Bunheng (Cambodia): It gives me great\r\npleasure to join previous speakers in commemorating\r\nthe tenth anniversary of the International Conference\r\non Population and Development. It is indeed our\r\nhonour to inform this body that Prime Minister\r\nSamdech Hun Sen, on behalf of the people and Royal\r\nGovernment of Cambodia, has proclaimed his full\r\nsupport for the world leaders’ statement in support of\r\nthe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD).\r\nIt is interesting to contemplate that it was only 10\r\nyears ago that the ICPD called on the international\r\ncommunity to adopt a new approach to link population\r\naction with human development, women’s\r\nempowerment, gender equality and the needs and\r\nrights of individuals, including young people. The\r\nICPD for the first time grounded family planning, once\r\nthe main focus of population policies and programmes,\r\nwithin a broader framework of reproductive health and\r\nrights, including sexual health. With the assistance of\r\nthe United Nations and civil society, Cambodia has\r\nembraced that message and incorporated it into\r\nnational policies and planning, addressing those issues\r\nacross a broad front.\r\nHIV/AIDS is perhaps one of the most talked-\r\nabout aspects of Cambodia’s reaction to the ICPD\r\nagenda, with HIV seroprevalence among Cambodian\r\nadults having dropped from 3.3 per cent in 1997 to 2.6\r\nper cent in 2002, resulting in Cambodia’s being one of\r\nonly three countries in the world to reverse the HIV\r\ninfection rate. The National AIDS Authority has played\r\na key coordinating role in the government response to\r\nthe epidemic, while the Ministry of Health has been in\r\ncharge of monitoring trends in the epidemic and of\r\nputting into practice programmes for the prevention of\r\nnew infections and the care of those already affected.\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nOn other elements of the ICPD agenda, I believe\r\nthat Cambodia has made solid gains. For the first time\r\nin 36 years, Cambodia organized a national census in\r\n1998, a magnificent achievement by the Ministry of\r\nPlanning. On the basis of the 1998 data, the\r\nGovernment has been able to organize a Cambodian\r\ndemographic and health survey, a second socio-\r\neconomic development plan, a poverty reduction\r\nstrategy and, most recently, a national population\r\npolicy. The national population policy was launched by\r\nthe Prime Minister earlier this year and provided\r\nrecommendations for further actions in the 10 priority\r\npopulation areas, including clear links between high\r\nfertility and high population growth and poverty.\r\nSince 1994, the Government has been increasing\r\nthe number of legislative and administrative measures\r\nto protect the rights of girls and women, starting with a\r\nnational birth spacing policy in 1994, a law on the\r\nsuppression of kidnapping, trafficking, sale and\r\nexploitation of human beings in 1996, a labour law in\r\n1997, and a law on abortion in 1997, and has submitted\r\na draft law against domestic violence that we hope to\r\nreintroduce to the National Assembly this year. The\r\nestablishment of the Ministry of Women’s Affairs in\r\n1996 is one of our major achievements. That Ministry\r\nhas been actively and effectively pursuing a five-year\r\nstrategy from 2001, gradually achieving ICPD aims.\r\nIn the years after 1994, the Ministry of Health\r\nissued guidelines on male and female sterilization and\r\nnational safe motherhood policy and strategies. In\r\nNovember 2002, the Ministry of Health published the\r\nHealth Sector Strategic Plan 2003-2007, which will\r\ntarget infant and maternal mortality rates as a priority\r\nand seeks to empower all people to take decisions\r\nbased on informed choices. Now, the Government has\r\nintegrated reproductive health into health care at the\r\nlevel of health centres. All Government health centres\r\nthroughout the country offer birthing facilities to\r\nattempt to meet the sorely pressing need for birthing\r\nspace. The training and use of midwives and the use of\r\nemergency obstetric care are being steadily increased,\r\nincluding in remote areas.\r\nGiven the large proportion of young people in the\r\ncountry, the adolescents and young people of\r\nCambodia have been receiving more attention. The\r\nGovernment has been particularly encouraging towards\r\nand supportive of any organization that reaches out to\r\nthe young, particularly to broaden and deepen their\r\neducation on reproductive health and on the prevention\r\nof new infections of HIV/AIDS. We give particular\r\ncredit to the European Union/United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) initiative that has worked\r\nthrough international and Cambodian non-\r\ngovernmental organizations to reach young people in\r\nboth urban and rural areas.\r\nAll this and more shows the distance that\r\nCambodia has come since 1994. We could not have\r\nachieved so much on our own. Partnerships have been\r\nessential to our strategy. We were very fortunate that\r\nUNFPA opened an office in Phnom Penh in 1994 and\r\nhas provided Cambodia with much guidance and\r\ntechnical assistance in those areas, as have other\r\nUnited Nations agencies, such as the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the World Health\r\nOrganization and the United Nations Children’s Fund,\r\nto name but a few. Other bilateral donors, international\r\nagencies and civil society have also made very\r\nimportant contributions. Without such partnership, our\r\npath towards the ICPD goals would have been rockier\r\nindeed.\r\nBut the goals have not yet been achieved. We are\r\nstill far short of reaching the ICPD targets and we still\r\nlack resources to achieve all that we would like. I\r\nwould therefore like to finish with an appeal to the\r\ninternational community and civil society to keep the\r\nmessage of ICPD + 10 in mind and to strengthen their\r\npartnership in Cambodia so that the important goals\r\nwill remain achievable within the foreseeable future\r\nand do not disappear from sight.\r\nMr. Ahamed (India): My delegation is pleased to\r\nparticipate in this event to commemorate the tenth\r\nanniversary of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development. We commend the\r\nSecretariat for its report on the review and appraisal of\r\nthe progress made in achieving the goals and\r\nobjectives of the Programme of Action adopted by the\r\nInternational Conference, prepared for this occasion.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of Qatar on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77.\r\nThe central theme of the International Conference\r\nwas to forge a balance among population, sustained\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development. The\r\nobjective of the agreement reached at the Conference\r\nwas to raise the quality of life and well-being of human\r\nbeings and to promote human development. The\r\nProgramme of Action, in our view, rightly emphasized\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nthe need to integrate population concerns fully into\r\ndevelopment strategies and planning, taking into\r\naccount the interrelationship of population issues with\r\nthe goals of poverty eradication, food security,\r\nadequate shelter, productive employment and basic\r\nservices for all.\r\nThe rate of population growth over the past\r\ndecade has been higher in the poorer nations of the\r\nworld, with four out of every five persons living in the\r\nless developed regions in 2004, and also higher within\r\nthe poorer and disadvantaged sections of society. The\r\nemphasis on sustained economic growth and\r\nsustainable development in the Programme of Action\r\ntherefore becomes extremely relevant.\r\nIndia formulated a national family planning\r\nprogramme as early as 1952, with the objective of\r\nstabilizing the population at a level consistent with the\r\nrequirements of growth of the national economy. The\r\ntechnological advances and improved quality and\r\ncoverage of health care resulted in a rapid fall in the\r\ncrude death rate in India from 25 per 1,000 in 1951-61\r\nto 10 in 1991 and to 8 in 2002. In contrast, the\r\nreduction in the crude birth rate has been less steep,\r\ndeclining from 41 per 1,000 in 1951-61 to 30 in 1991\r\nand 25 in 2002. As a result, the annual exponential\r\npopulation growth rate was over 2 per cent in the\r\nperiod 1961-1991. But from 1991 to 2001, population\r\ngrowth decelerated to below 2 per cent for the first\r\ntime in four decades, though not uniformly across the\r\ncountry.\r\nThe International Conference has had a profound\r\nimpact on India’s policy related to population\r\nstabilization, as agreed and unanimously endorsed by\r\nour Parliament. The commitments contained in the\r\nProgramme of Action find full reflection in our\r\nnational population policy. India has a strong political\r\ncommitment to achieving population stabilization\r\ngoals. A comprehensive population policy, laying down\r\n14 socio-demographic goals and several operational\r\nstrategies, has been unanimously endorsed by our\r\nnational Parliament. A national population commission\r\nhas been established under the chairmanship of the\r\nPrime Minister. A national population stabilization\r\nfund has been constituted, with the Prime Minister as\r\nits Chairperson and with an initial corpus of 1 billion\r\nrupees or approximately $20 million. The mobilization\r\nof resources from the private sector for undertaking\r\nseveral initiatives in the underserved areas, where\r\naccess to health-care continues to be inadequate, is also\r\nenvisaged. An empowered action group has been\r\nspecially set up to design and formulate programmes in\r\nterms of both geographic and thematic areas, with a\r\nspecial focus on the needs and themes that require\r\nfurther attention.\r\nPopulation policies in India are based on the\r\nrecognition of the right of every woman to decide for\r\nherself the number of children she wants and when,\r\nwhile simultaneously acknowledging that male\r\nparticipation is equally critical. We neither evaluate our\r\nprogrammes based on predetermined targets, nor\r\nencourage the use of any coercive measures or\r\ninducements.\r\nThe 2001 census showed that the literacy rate in\r\nthe last decade has gone up from 64.1 per cent to 75.9\r\nper cent for men and from 39.3 per cent to 54.2 per\r\ncent for women. Progress in education has contributed\r\nto a reduction in the fertility, morbidity and mortality\r\nrates, as well as to the empowerment of women.\r\nEducation also provides access to information. The\r\nlinkages among education, expanding markets and\r\nincome, and the reduction in fertility are significant for\r\ncountries like ours.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals aimed at\r\nreducing global poverty and hunger by half by 2015.\r\nThe Secretary-General has pointed out that, despite\r\nsome setbacks in certain countries, progress has been\r\nmade in reducing poverty rates, though not in reducing\r\nthe absolute number of poor persons. Despite sustained\r\nincreases in the food supply globally, the number of\r\nundernourished people has grown since 1995 as food\r\ninsecurity increased in many of the poorest countries.\r\nIndia has made substantial progress on growth\r\nand poverty reduction over the past decade. Progress\r\nhas also been made in improving literacy, enrolment\r\ncompletion, and gender balance in primary education.\r\nAccording to one estimate, with the current trends,\r\nIndia will comfortably achieve its targets in both\r\nincome and food security. The Government of India is\r\ncommitted to achieving the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. That commitment has been most recently\r\nillustrated in the Government of India’s budget for the\r\nyear 2004-2005.\r\nThe central theme of the Cairo Conference was to\r\nforge a balance among population, sustained economic\r\ngrowth and sustainable development. The balance was\r\nbased on the premise that the actions of the\r\nGovernments of developing countries would be\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nmatched by assistance from the donor community.\r\nInternational assistance and support that was promised\r\nto the developing countries has fallen short. The\r\nSecretary-General pointed out in his report that, in\r\norder to achieve the goals and objectives of the\r\nProgramme of Action, continued efforts and\r\ncommitment are needed to mobilize sufficient human\r\nand financial resources. On the tenth anniversary of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, nations of the world — developed and\r\ndeveloping — need to reiterate their resolve to achieve\r\nthe goals and objectives of the Programme of Action.\r\nSustained, continued and enhanced assistance from the\r\ninternational community is needed to help achieve our\r\njoint objective.\r\nMr. Singh (Canada) (spoke in French): I am\r\npleased to address the Assembly today at this special\r\nmeeting. The International Conference on Population\r\nand Development (ICPD), held in Cairo, allowed for\r\nthe creation of a new standard in the level of health and\r\nwell-being that people have a right to expect and\r\nrecognized the need to address not only the symptoms\r\nand problems related to population and development,\r\nbut also their root causes — including poverty, abuses\r\nof human rights, gender inequality, social and\r\neconomic inequity, lack of education and employment,\r\nand the absence of the principles of good governance.\r\nOver the past 10 years our countries have used\r\nthat framework as the basis for policy and action, and\r\nwe have made important progress. In Canada, the ICPD\r\nProgramme of Action together with other international\r\ncommitments, such as the Beijing Declaration, have\r\nbeen important catalysts for progress towards gender\r\nequality, sexual and reproductive health and in\r\nbringing a human rights perspective to population and\r\ndevelopment efforts, both at home and abroad.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nDespite progress in some areas, maternal\r\nmorbidity and mortality rates, HIV/AIDS infection,\r\npoor sexual and reproductive health and global\r\npoverty — particularly among women and in female-\r\nheaded households — remain unacceptably high in\r\nmany parts of the world and our collective responses to\r\nchallenges in areas such as migration have not been\r\nadequate.\r\nPerhaps the most significant change in the global\r\nlandscape since Cairo has been the devastating impact\r\nof the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The global community is\r\nresponding to the crisis and in some areas we are\r\nbeginning to see progress. We have learned that\r\naddressing gender inequality and promoting and\r\nprotecting human rights, including focusing on child\r\nprotection, are essential for reducing the spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS and for ensuring the economic and social\r\nstability of communities.\r\nStigma and discrimination continue to be\r\nsignificant barriers to addressing HIV/AIDS.\r\nWomen — especially poor or marginalized women —\r\ncontinue to be disproportionately affected by\r\nHIV/AIDS in that they are both physiologically,\r\neconomically and socially more vulnerable to\r\nHIV/AIDS, which in turn exacerbates their\r\nvulnerability. Key to breaking that cycle is the need to\r\nexamine and challenge the notion of the “ABC”\r\napproach to preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, which\r\ndoes not necessarily meet the urgent need of women to\r\nenjoy or exercise their rights or empower them with the\r\ntools to protect themselves from HIV and other\r\ninfections. Similarly, we must ensure that campaigns,\r\nsuch as the World Health Organization’s 3 by 5\r\nInitiative, include a gender perspective and that\r\ndelivery reaches and is reflective of the needs of all\r\nthose infected and affected by HIV/AIDS.\r\nAddressing the linkages between sexual and\r\nreproductive health and HIV/AIDS and ensuring\r\ncoordinated and integrated efforts in those areas will\r\nmake a major contribution to promoting and protecting\r\nsexual and reproductive health and rights and to\r\ncombating HIV/AIDS. The work of key United Nations\r\nagencies, in particular the United Nations Population\r\nFund, the Joint United Nations Programme on\r\nHIV/AIDS and other sponsoring organizations, has laid\r\na solid foundation on which to build partnerships and\r\nmove this agenda forward.\r\nIn the context of changing age structures, the\r\nlargest generation of youth ever is presently making its\r\ntransition to adulthood. In 1994, we recognized the\r\nspecial needs of young people and outlined in the\r\nICPD Programme of Action those areas which\r\nevidence suggests are most likely to be effective in\r\nmaintaining and protecting the health of young people,\r\nsuch as access to youth-friendly sexual and\r\nreproductive health care and services, including\r\ninformation and education — all of which recognize\r\nthe rights of young people. In 2004, we must seize the\r\nopportunity and work with youth to address the needs\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nof this generation if we are to make a significant\r\ncontribution to meeting our Cairo commitments.\r\nWe must also work to address Cairo commitments\r\non migration, including making the option of\r\nremaining in one’s country viable for all people. While\r\nthere has been some progress in that area over the past\r\n10 years, issues surrounding remittances, internally\r\ndisplaced persons, refugees and an increasing number\r\nof undocumented migrants and international criminal\r\nsmuggling and trafficking networks — often related to\r\nlack of employment opportunities and good governance\r\nstructures — all underscore the substantial scope of the\r\neffort still required to address them. The round table\r\nheld here in New York earlier this week highlighted the\r\ncomplex and cross-cutting nature of migration,\r\nincluding issues related to human security, human\r\nrights, employment, urbanization, health systems,\r\nhumanitarian aid and development, and social and\r\neconomic inequity.\r\nCanada strongly supports the continued relevance\r\nof the ICPD as a comprehensive, balanced and\r\nconstructive road map for international cooperation on\r\ninternational migration. In meeting those challenges,\r\nthe ICPD Programme of Action remains as relevant\r\ntoday, if not more so, than it did in 1994. Canada\r\nfirmly believes that the ICPD Programme of Action,\r\ntogether with the key actions for its further\r\nimplementation, should continue to serve as the\r\nframework for action in this area.\r\nLooking forward to the next 10 years, we need to\r\nbe determined and creative in identifying and\r\naddressing the barriers to achieving the Cairo goals and\r\ncommitments. We need to back up our commitments to\r\ngender equality with concrete actions that will effect\r\npositive changes in the lives of women and men, boys\r\nand girls. We need to challenge current thinking on our\r\napproaches to HIV/AIDS prevention, and we need to\r\nengage adolescents and youth in a meaningful way.\r\nEqually urgent is the need to revisit the\r\ncommitments to migration that are outlined in chapters\r\nIX and X of the Cairo document and to renew our\r\ncommitments to finding solutions. Canada believes that\r\nthe Cairo Programme of Action should continue to\r\ninform the debates that will take place over the next\r\ntwo years within the context of the Global Commission\r\non International Migration (GCIM) and the 2006 high-\r\nlevel dialogue so that those discussions will consider a\r\nbroad and integrated view of migration and\r\ndevelopment issues. We are pleased that the Canadian\r\nCommissioner is contributing to GCIM.\r\nCanada considers that implementation of the\r\nICPD Programme of Action is essential for\r\nimplementing the internationally agreed poverty\r\nreduction and development goals outlined in the\r\nMillennium Declaration and the associated Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Indeed, sexual and\r\nreproductive health, gender equality, human rights,\r\neducation and the root causes of migration underpin\r\nthe MDGs agreed at the Millennium Summit, not least\r\nof which are the Goals related to environmental\r\nsustainability, the promotion of gender equality and\r\nempowerment of women, child mortality, maternal\r\nhealth and reducing the impact of HIV/AIDS.\r\nWithout continued significant political and\r\nfinancial commitment by both developed and\r\ndeveloping countries to achieving the core\r\ncommitments of the ICPD Programme of Action, we\r\nwill not be able to meet the internationally agreed\r\npoverty reduction and development goals outlined in\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\r\nWe cannot ignore the challenging issue of\r\nfinancing. We must continue to explore options for new\r\nmechanisms to generate additional resources to meet\r\nthe ICPD goals.\r\nFinally, let me turn to the issue of partnerships.\r\nPartnerships at the international regional and national\r\nlevel — between Governments, international\r\norganizations and all elements of civil society,\r\nincluding youth, indigenous populations and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations — are critical for creating\r\nan enabling environment for population and\r\ndevelopment. Governments alone cannot ensure the\r\nfull implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action.\r\nIn this respect, we applaud the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations system and of our civil society\r\npartners, particularly over the past year, to bring\r\ntogether and challenge diverse constituencies to\r\ndevelop joint partnerships for population and\r\ndevelopment. These include the various round tables\r\nand technical meetings organized by the United\r\nNations Population Fund, as well as the innovation and\r\ninitiative taken by the Joint United Nations Programme\r\non HIV/AIDS in launching the Global Coalition on\r\nWomen and AIDS.\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nCanada will continue to work closely with all\r\npartners at the national, regional and international\r\nlevels to ensure that we successfully meet the goals and\r\nobjectives set out at Cairo. We recognize that the\r\nchallenges before us do not have easy solutions, but we\r\ncommit ourselves to this cooperative effort.\r\nMs. Taracena Secaira (Guatemala) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): In 1994, Guatemala was one of the 179\r\ncountries that participated in the International\r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD).\r\nDuring the last ten years, Guatemala has advanced in\r\nthe implementation of the commitments laid down in\r\nthe Programme of Action, within the framework of the\r\nPeace Agreements signed in Guatemala in 1996 and the\r\nConstitution of the Republic.\r\nAs a result of the regional process of evaluation\r\nof the fulfilment of those commitments laid down in\r\nthe Cairo Programme of Action — a process carried\r\nout in a series of meetings held this year in Santiago,\r\nChile, and San Juan, Puerto Rico — Guatemala wishes\r\nto express its satisfaction at the achievements that have\r\nmarked this decade. The ICPD has certainly\r\ncontributed to the social and human development of all\r\nGuatemalans, both male and female. We associate\r\nourselves with the commemoration of the tenth\r\nanniversary of the Conference and congratulate the\r\nOffice of the Executive Director of the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) on its progress in carrying\r\nout the Programme of Action with regard to respect for\r\nhuman rights, education, integral health, environmental\r\nprotection, the status of women, gender equality and\r\nfairness.\r\nIn the past few years, Guatemala has worked to\r\nmainstream population and development issues in the\r\nnational agenda, particularly with respect to legislation\r\nand public policies in the spheres of social\r\ndevelopment, health, HIV/AIDS, education, the\r\nenvironment, the complete advancement of women,\r\nand other areas. Guatemala’s position on those issues\r\nhas been changing substantially since the end of the\r\ninternal armed conflict. Democratization processes, the\r\nneed to overcome the consequences of the struggles\r\nthat raged for years and plunged the country into\r\nconfrontations between families, communities and\r\nsocial groups, and that led to the destruction of the\r\ntraditional unity of the family, increased poverty and\r\nforced migration, are all involved in the change.\r\nWithin this framework, the conclusion of the\r\nPeace Agreements in 1996 has also contributed to the\r\nrecognition of equal rights for men and women in\r\nvarious areas of social and political life and the\r\nparticipation of women in the development of\r\nGuatemalan society, as well as the commitment by the\r\nState to eliminate any form of discrimination, de facto\r\nor legal, against women.\r\nIt is necessary to note the efforts aimed at\r\ncooperation with civil society in promoting the\r\ninitiative for a Social Development and Population\r\nLaw. This has underscored Guatemala’s commitment to\r\nimplementing the Cairo Programme of Action. Our\r\nnew law was enacted on the basis of a consensus\r\nreached by a multisectoral forum, with the\r\nparticipation of various churches, universities,\r\nindigenous peoples, the business sector, the media,\r\nwomen’s organizations and other representatives of\r\norganized civil society. This law, which is novel to our\r\ncountry, addresses key topics relating to social\r\ndevelopment in Guatemala and is an example of the\r\nprogress the country has achieved in this area.\r\nWithin this same framework, Guatemala has\r\nachieved significant changes in the social sphere based\r\non an equitable and humane approach, particularly with\r\nregard to preventive and curative health care for\r\nmothers and newborn and for women and men in the\r\nrural sectors who have found it very difficult to enjoy\r\nthe benefits of development. There have been\r\nconsiderable improvements in the equitable access by\r\nboys and girls to basic education. Moreover, citizens’\r\nparticipation has been encouraged and the rights and\r\nspecific needs of women and indigenous peoples have\r\nbeen recognized. Nevertheless, we have not lost sight\r\nof the reality — an impoverished population that is\r\never more vociferous in its demands for the elimination\r\nof discrimination, just and equal treatment and access\r\nby women to the decision-making hierarchy.\r\nIn the years immediately ahead, Guatemala will\r\nstrive to consolidate the progress that has been made,\r\nparticularly as mandated by its Social Development\r\nLaw. Moreover, the country will ensure that the\r\nconcerns of women are incorporated in all spheres of\r\nGuatemala’s development, not with a partial vision, or\r\none seen under the heading “women’s affairs”, but\r\nrather one that takes into account the need for women\r\nto play a proactive role in the development of their\r\ncountry.\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nIn compliance with the Cairo Programme of\r\nAction, Guatemala has embraced a new paradigm that\r\nis based on human rights. Guatemala maintains its\r\nposition against the practice of abortion, in the belief\r\nthat life begins at the moment of conception, as\r\nprovided for under article 3 of our Constitution. It\r\nfollows that any action that endangers life can,\r\nobviously, not be countenanced by us. Guatemala\r\nconcurs with paragraph 8.25 of the Cairo Programme\r\nin considering that abortion should not be promoted as\r\na method of family planning. It is thus clear that\r\nneither at the Cairo Conference, nor at the meetings or\r\nin statements at Santiago and San Juan, have the\r\npractices of abortion been promoted. This position is\r\nfully in keeping with the feelings and beliefs of the\r\nmajority of the Guatemalan people.\r\nThe Government of Guatemala wishes to confirm\r\nits commitment to the Cairo Programme of Action and\r\nwill continue to comply with it, within the\r\nconstitutional precepts and the laws existing in our\r\ncountry.\r\nMr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French): It\r\nis with pride that we look back on the revolutionary\r\nstep taken 10 years ago by the international\r\ncommunity: the adoption of the Cairo Programme of\r\nAction.\r\nIt was then that our perception of population and\r\ndemographic issues changed. In Cairo, our heads of\r\nState expanded the idea of family planning to include\r\nreproductive health and a package of reproductive\r\nrights, in particular the right freely to choose\r\ncontraception and family size. That rights-based\r\napproach recentred development on the human being.\r\nMembers may recall the phrase used at the time: “Let\r\nus no longer just count people — let us make people\r\ncount”.\r\nWith this new, broader vision of population and\r\ndevelopment issues, which has shifted the focus of\r\nfamily planning to reproductive rights and health, the\r\nlives of millions of women, young people and children\r\nhave improved. Today, the idea that individuals,\r\nwomen and men alike, should have the right — and the\r\nresponsibility — to freely choose the size of their\r\nfamilies and decide for themselves whether to use\r\ncontraception, has gained ground. The number of births\r\nper woman has decreased overall. Access to health\r\nservices has clearly improved, and a number of\r\ncountries have taken very important steps to bring their\r\nlegislation into line with the Cairo Programme of\r\nAction, to promote gender equality and to enhance the\r\nrole of women.\r\nWe are mindful of the fact that much remains to\r\nbe done in order to guarantee full reproductive rights\r\nand reproductive health, including access to\r\nreproductive health services by all — men, women and\r\nadolescents. It is absolutely unacceptable that over\r\n500,000 women die during childbirth each year. Those\r\nare deaths that are preventable. It is our duty to ensure\r\naccess to information about contraceptives, especially\r\nfor young people, and to do everything we can to\r\nprotect women and men from sexually transmitted\r\ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS. In doing so, we must fully\r\ntake into account and respect the sociocultural\r\nenvironment and the values of the society in question.\r\nSwitzerland believes that a connection must be\r\nmade between universal rights and moral and cultural\r\nvalues, so as to ensure that universal human rights are\r\nbetter observed and that they play their proper part in\r\nthe daily lives of all.\r\nWith respect to the Millennium Declaration, eight\r\ndevelopment goals for poverty eradication were\r\nformulated. Switzerland believes that those Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals are the synthesis of all of the goals\r\nset during the world conferences of the 1990s. We must\r\nall have the firm conviction that poverty eradication is\r\nimpossible without improving reproductive rights and\r\nreproductive health, as well as gender equality and\r\nuniversal access to education.\r\nSwitzerland appreciates the efforts being made in\r\nthis context by the United Nations and its operational\r\nagencies. Here, I would like to pay special tribute to\r\nthe United Nations Population Fund in implementing\r\nthe Programme of Action at the national level. The\r\nFund plays a crucial role in areas such as reproductive\r\nhealth, gender equality, family and youth. It has shown\r\nremarkable skill, particularly with regard to cultural\r\nmatters, at sensitive moments, and has proved to be a\r\nreliable partner of the developing countries when\r\ndefending the right of the individual to reproductive\r\nhealth.\r\nWe believe that we are on the right track. I assure\r\nthe Assembly that Switzerland will do everything in its\r\npower to help to implement the Cairo Programme of\r\nAction.\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nMr. Siv (United States of America): The United\r\nStates is pleased to join with others on this tenth\r\nanniversary of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD), because of our\r\nfirm commitment to advancing the well-being of\r\nwomen and their families and to upholding the positive\r\nvalues and ideals embraced in the ICPD Programme of\r\nAction.\r\nWhile the Programme of Action is not a perfect\r\ndocument, it has historic importance and reflects the\r\naspirations of the international community. It provides\r\na broad concept of population policy — one that is\r\nfocused on humanity and the human condition, that\r\nrespects cultural, religious, and social values, and that\r\nfirmly condemns Government control and coercion.\r\nAs with all of our work in the United Nations, the\r\nUnited States approaches the ICPD Programme of\r\nAction in the context of the United Nations Charter and\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Those\r\ndocuments commit the world community to protecting\r\nthe dignity and worth of each human person — a\r\nconcept at the heart of the ICPD.\r\nIn the years since the ICPD, we have seen that\r\nthere is no one-size-fits-all approach to population. In\r\nmany countries, today’s population trends are positive:\r\nlonger lifespans, healthier families and greater\r\nprosperity. In others, there is a sadder story to tell.\r\nMaternal mortality remains a devastating sorrow,\r\nundiminished since Cairo. More than 1.1 billion people\r\nexist in poverty, living on less than $1 a day. Increasing\r\nurbanization in the developing world brings the\r\nchallenge of providing for some of the world’s poorest\r\npeoples.\r\nWorst of all, the number of individuals living\r\nwith HIV has grown from approximately 14 million in\r\n1994 to over 38 million today. The international\r\ncommunity is only now beginning to make headway\r\nagainst the ferocity of that disease.\r\nYet let there be no confusion. The United States\r\nis committing substantial resources to meeting these\r\nchallenges. The United States Agency for International\r\nDevelopment (USAID) alone spends more than $1.4\r\nbillion on international health assistance, exclusive of\r\nHIV/AIDS programming. Furthermore, we are rapidly\r\nescalating our support for HIV prevention, care and\r\ntreatment activities. These are carried out through both\r\nthe President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and\r\nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\r\nMalaria, with planned expenditures through 2008 of\r\n$15 billion.\r\nThe promotion of behaviour change —\r\nencouraging abstinence and fidelity — is integral to\r\nour fight against HIV/AIDS. Working with parents, we\r\nmust encourage our young people to make safe and\r\nhealthy choices. Equally important, we recognize that\r\nempowering and protecting women is a critical\r\ncomponent of efforts to stop the spread of the disease.\r\nThe status of women — and the influence of\r\ncultural norms, property rights and economic\r\nopportunity on their lives — are all critical factors in\r\nreducing their risk of HIV infection.\r\nThe United States is the largest single donor of\r\nmaternal health assistance, including family planning\r\nand reproductive health programmes. For these,\r\nUSAID programming has exceeded $475 million\r\nannually over the past 4 years — a $50 million\r\nincrease in funding since 2000. In recent years, we\r\nhave increased our maternal and reproductive health\r\nassistance to countries in Africa and the Near East.\r\nAs we entered this 10-year review process, there\r\nwas a need for greater clarity about what the ICPD\r\nProgramme of Action does and does not say on\r\nsensitive issues like reproductive health services. The\r\nregional review process has been helpful because it has\r\nserved to allay one of our key concerns, which was that\r\nsome might be misusing the ICPD to promote abortion.\r\nHowever, what we have heard over and over in\r\nregional reviews is that nations do not believe that the\r\nICPD Programme of Action promotes, endorses, or\r\nsupports abortion. The United States concurs that\r\nnothing in the Programme should be understood to\r\npromote, endorse, or support abortion, and, with the\r\nunderstanding that States will not misuse it in that way,\r\nwe are pleased to continue to offer our support for the\r\nICPD and its Programme of Action.\r\nThe United States is advancing the goals of the\r\nICPD Programme of Action on many fronts. Through\r\nprogrammes that support both the education and\r\npolitical participation of women around the world —\r\nand that help men appreciate the importance of\r\nwomen’s participation — we are contributing to greater\r\ngender equity globally.\r\nWe support basic education for girls as well as\r\nboys in order to reduce poverty, improve health and\r\nsocial well-being, and sustain economic growth.\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nWe are also advancing the position of women in\r\nthe developing world by promoting entrepreneurship\r\nand prosperity with microenterprise programmes. Our\r\nMillennium Challenge Account offers new hope for\r\nsome of the world’s poorest countries. We recognize\r\nthat the participation of women is vital to the success\r\nof a country’s long-term development strategy.\r\nWe encourage increased political participation by\r\nwomen and the strengthening of their role in decision-\r\nmaking processes. We provide support for leadership\r\nand advocacy training, educational exchange\r\nprogrammes, and civil society and democracy skills\r\nworkshops. We have actively supported the great\r\nstrides made by women in places such as Afghanistan\r\nand Iraq in securing their rights under the law. That\r\nincludes the right to vote, as successfully exercised by\r\nthe women of Afghanistan last Saturday.\r\nThe promotion of gender equality will always be\r\na high priority for the United States. Equally high\r\npriorities for us are respect for motherhood, the rights\r\nand responsibilities of parents, and the family as the\r\nbasic and fundamental unit of societies everywhere.\r\nWe also wish to highlight one of the ICPD’s most\r\nsignificant accomplishments: the crafting of a global\r\nconsensus on migration that continues to this day.\r\nMigration is a global phenomenon. All countries are, to\r\nsome extent, countries of origin, transit, and\r\ndestination. America is supporting regional migration\r\ndialogues that promote orderly, legal and humane\r\nmigration policies. Those policies should also uphold\r\ninternational protection for refugees, asylum seekers\r\nand victims of trafficking. We believe that these\r\nregional approaches are most likely to yield concrete\r\nresults for all countries.\r\nThe ICPD Programme of Action was the first\r\nmajor United Nations document to focus attention on\r\nthe issue of trafficking in persons. The global\r\ncommunity has indeed made substantial progress in\r\nthat area. President Bush has taken strong action to\r\ncombat trafficking at home and abroad, urging action\r\nthrough the United Nations and signing legislation\r\ndomestically. Since 2001, the United States has\r\nprovided more than $295 million to support anti-\r\ntrafficking programmes in more than 120 countries.\r\nIn sum, there is much to be proud of in what we\r\nhave accomplished together in the past 10 years,\r\nalthough much remains to be done. The United States\r\nlooks forward to continuing our partnership in the\r\nprocess of advancing our shared goal of a better life for\r\nall.\r\nMr. Amayo (Kenya): My delegation appreciates\r\nthe able manner in which Mr. Ping is continuing to\r\nsteer the deliberations of the work of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. We align ourselves\r\nwith the statement issued by Qatar on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nIn recognition of the intrinsic link between\r\ndemography and sustainable development and the\r\nspecial challenges it poses for the developing world,\r\nour heads of State and Government met in Cairo 10\r\nyears ago and came up with a Programme of Action\r\naimed at addressing those issues. The Programme of\r\nAction identified key sectors and corresponding goals\r\nwhose attainment was imperative to sustainable\r\ndevelopment, namely universal access to education;\r\nreproductive health; gender equity and equality;\r\nreducing infant, child and maternal mortality; and\r\ncombating the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Kenya reaffirms\r\nits commitment to the decisions made at Cairo and sees\r\nthem as the way forward towards addressing\r\npopulation, reproductive and health issues. We hold the\r\nview that the Consensus reached at the International\r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD)\r\nshould not be reconsidered or renegotiated. As we\r\ncommemorate the tenth anniversary of the ICPD, it is\r\nimperative that we take stock of the progress made and\r\nthe challenges faced in this arena.\r\nIssues of population and reproductive health\r\nremain integral to addressing poverty eradication. This\r\nhas been exacerbated by hunger and the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic. Unfortunately, developing countries,\r\nparticularly in Africa, lag behind in indicators\r\nidentified by the Programme of Action, such as life\r\nexpectancy. That has been attributed to the socio-\r\neconomic transformations that have resulted from\r\nmalaria, tuberculosis and cholera, as well as from the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic itself.\r\nAs noted by the Secretary-General, the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, particularly the\r\neradication of extreme poverty and hunger, cannot be\r\nachieved if population-related issues as well as\r\nreproductive health issues are not addressed. It is\r\ntherefore imperative that the ICPD Programme of\r\nAction and Millennium Development Goals be\r\naddressed simultaneously.\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nAt the national level, the Ministry of Health, the\r\nNational Council for Population Development and the\r\nFamily Planning Association of Kenya are working in\r\nclose collaboration to address these issues as well as\r\nformulate policies and implement national population\r\nand reproductive health programmes. Poor economic\r\nperformance over the past few years has been\r\ncompounded by the devastating effects of the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, which has affected the\r\nproductive population. The attainment of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals will depend on how\r\neffectively we deal with the HIV/AIDS pandemic,\r\nwhich, in sub-Saharan Africa, has reversed the\r\neconomic and social gains of the past decades.\r\nWe appreciate the assistance of our development\r\npartners and of the United National Global Fund in that\r\nregard, but we would caution that a lot more needs to\r\nbe done. My delegation would like to highlight the\r\nneed to reach the target 0.7 per cent of gross national\r\nproduct target as official development assistance by\r\ndeveloped countries. In that regard, we welcome the\r\nannouncement by the European Union this morning\r\nthat it intends to fill the entire reproductive health\r\ncommodities gap — $75 million — this year.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe Kenya Government has implemented various\r\npolicies aimed at long-term economic stability and\r\ndevelopment. These include the Poverty Reduction\r\nStrategy Paper, 2001-2004; Economic Recovery\r\nStrategy for Wealth and Employment Creation;\r\nAdolescent Reproductive Health Strategy; Gender\r\nPolicy; and Youth Policy.\r\nKenya has also adapted the ICPD Programme of\r\nAction domestically, in the form of the National\r\nPopulation for Sustainable Development policy. In\r\naddition, the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development’s reproductive health agenda has\r\nbeen articulated in the National Reproductive Health\r\nStrategy. Other measures put in place by the\r\nGovernment include the introduction of free and\r\ncompulsory primary education and the recognition of\r\nthe central role played by women in development. Care\r\nis being taken to address this particular gender\r\ndisparity by advocating for the girl child and\r\nappointing women to positions of authority.\r\nLet me conclude by stating that we note with\r\nsatisfaction the overwhelming support expressed at the\r\nregional ICPD+10 review meetings and reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to the ICPD Programme of Action and the\r\nkey actions of the five-year review. We appreciate the\r\ncontinued support of our development partners.\r\nHowever, my delegation would like to urge them to\r\nincrease financial support in order to ensure stable and\r\npredictable achievement of the ICPD goals and the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nMr. Sunaga (Japan): I would like to join the\r\nother delegations gathered here in celebrating the tenth\r\nanniversary of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD).\r\nAs we all know, the ICPD Programme of Action\r\nmarked a turning point in international cooperation on\r\npopulation and development. Indeed, it has not only\r\nstrengthened the commitments and efforts of the\r\ninternational community but is also bringing about a\r\nsignificant change in the way we address population\r\nissues, shifting the focus from macroscopic\r\ndemographic control to a human-centred approach\r\nrespecting the rights of individuals.\r\nAs a result, during the past ten years, many\r\nactions have been taken at the international, national\r\nand regional levels, and much progress has been made\r\nin a number of countries. However, we still have many\r\nchallenges ahead in order to fully implement the ICPD\r\nProgramme of Action and achieve its objectives.\r\nThe issues with which we are dealing here are\r\nextremely important for attaining the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. That is why Japan gives the\r\nhighest priority to assistance in this sector. For\r\ninstance, more than 20 per cent of Japan’s annual grant\r\naid is spent on health, particularly that of mothers and\r\nchildren, and on fighting infectious disease. Japan\r\nsupports capacity-building for doctors and midwives,\r\nthe building of health systems and hospitals and the\r\nprovision of other health-care facilities and medicine.\r\nJapan has introduced a maternal and child health\r\nhandbook in some Asian countries. The handbook is\r\ngiven to pregnant women to enable them to keep their\r\nhealth and medical records, as well as those of their\r\nchildren, until their children reach the age of six. This\r\nhas greatly contributed, in Japan and several Asian\r\ncountries, to increased education among expecting\r\nmothers, comprehensive care for newborn children and\r\nmedical exams thereafter.\r\nJapan also attaches particular importance to the\r\nbasic education of girls. Promotion of girls’ education\r\nis a key element in the empowerment of women.\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nEducation increases women’s participation in decision-\r\nmaking and provides economic opportunities. Japan\r\nsupports programmes to improve girls’ access to\r\neducation, including the creation of separate washroom\r\nfacilities in schools and the distribution of school\r\nlunches to provide incentives for poor families to send\r\ngirls to school.\r\nJapan is also committed to gender equality. For\r\nexample, projects providing support for women\r\naccount for 11 per cent of Japan’s technical assistance\r\nand 25 per cent of its grants to non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs) and other stakeholders. In 2003,\r\nthe Government of Japan organized a symposium on\r\neliminating female genital mutilation in Khartoum,\r\nSudan. That practice is deeply rooted in tradition, and\r\nthere is, therefore, opposition to its elimination.\r\nNevertheless, it is a practice that infringes not only on\r\nwomen’s health but also on women’s human rights, and\r\nthere is no question that it must be brought to an end.\r\nAs my delegation has mentioned on many\r\noccasions, the Government of Japan promotes human\r\nsecurity. Human security means the protection of\r\nhuman lives, livelihood and dignity, and the\r\nempowerment of individuals. The principles embodied\r\nin this concept are largely incorporated in the ICPD\r\nProgramme of Action. Having said that, I have to note\r\nthat population is a sensitive issue that touches on\r\nindividuals’ moral decisions and the cultural and\r\ntraditional values of each society. Therefore, what is\r\nmost important in the implementation of the ICPD\r\nProgramme of Action is partnerships, not only between\r\ndeveloped and developing countries, but also among\r\ncivil society, international organizations and, of course,\r\nordinary people.\r\nMs. Zbarskaya (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The International Conference on Population\r\nand Development (ICPD) was a powerful impetus to\r\nthe international community, including to the Russian\r\nFederation, for elaborating and implementing\r\ncomprehensive national policies for resolving\r\ndemographic problems in a context of sustainable and\r\nlong-term economic and social development. We are\r\nconvinced that the implementation of the objectives of\r\nthe Cairo Conference will make a substantial\r\ncontribution to the attainment of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs).\r\nOver the last ten years, in certain key areas of the\r\nICPD Programme of Action, significant progress has\r\nbeen reached. We must recognize the important role\r\nplayed by the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA) in this process. However, progress in\r\nattaining the goals of Cairo has been mixed.\r\nWe believe, in this connection, that national and\r\ninternational population programmes should be based\r\non an analysis of the real situation in the developing\r\nand developed countries and in countries in transition.\r\nOf great importance for assessing the implementation\r\nof the decisions taken in Cairo was the European\r\nPopulation Forum 2004, held in January. During the\r\nForum, current demographic trends were analysed, as\r\nwas experience in resolving the pressing problems\r\nconfronting all countries of the region.\r\nThe last decade has been marked, for the Russian\r\nFederation, by difficult and complex population\r\nprocesses. For more than ten years now, the main\r\ndetermining factor for demographic development in\r\nour country has been de-population, which has been\r\nthe result of protracted changes in the reproductive\r\nbehaviour of families and has led to a significant drop\r\nin reproductive rates and an increase in mortality rates.\r\nAs in many European countries and industrially\r\ndeveloped countries, the one-child model for families\r\nhas become the prevalent model in the Russian\r\nFederation.\r\nAt a time when the birth rate has practically\r\nhalved the rate for population reproduction,\r\nmaintaining and safeguarding reproductive health and\r\nrights for Russians has become a top priority. In order\r\nto implement our national priorities, the Government\r\nof the Russian Federation, after the Cairo Conference,\r\nhas been engaged in actively elaborating an ideology\r\nfor a State population policy. In 2001, a concept was\r\nendorsed for the demographic development of the\r\nRussian Federation up until 2015, which formulated\r\nthe most important areas of the Russian Federation’s\r\npublic policy in the area of population. The main\r\nstrategic goals seek to improve the health of the\r\npopulation to increase life expectancy, to lower\r\npreventable death rates, particularly for working age\r\nmen, to stimulate the birth rate and strengthen the\r\nfamily through greater prosperity, by improving the\r\nquality of life and living standards, social protection\r\nfor the family, incentives for people to have children\r\nand greater educational outreach on population matters.\r\nAs a result, there has been a drop in mortality\r\nrates for women by approximately one third during the\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\npast decade. There has been a continuing drop in infant\r\nmortality and the number of abortions has been cut\r\nalmost in half. The total birth rate has increased to 130\r\nchildren per 100 women. The State is trying to meet\r\nthe needs of the elderly, which is a growing segment of\r\nour society — more than 13 per cent of the population\r\nare over 65 years of age.\r\nHowever, when you evaluate the demographic\r\nsituation as a whole, and particularly the health of\r\nRussian citizens, including their reproductive health,\r\nwe must recognize that the situation is far from ideal,\r\nand the steps being taken to improve the situation are\r\nnot always effective.\r\nMortality rates are extremely high, particularly\r\namong men of working age. Life expectancy is\r\ndropping, the overall morbidity rates are on the rise,\r\nand despite some reduction, maternal mortality rates\r\nremain approximately two to two and a half times\r\nhigher than in developed countries. In one out of every\r\nfour cases, the cause of maternal death is abortion.\r\nArtificial interruption of pregnancy is still the most\r\nprevalent method of family planning in our country.\r\nThe rate of contraceptive use over the last 10\r\nyears has been virtually unchanged. They are used by\r\nabout a fifth of all women of child-bearing age. There\r\nhas been a surge in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The rapid\r\nspread of the disease is because of the spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS among drug users. Among HIV-infected\r\npersons, 80 per cent are young people under 30 year of\r\nage. The Government of the Russian Federation,\r\ntogether with international and Russian public\r\norganizations and funds, are taking steps to halt the\r\nspread of HIV/AIDS, primarily among the most\r\nvulnerable risk groups, as well as among adolescents\r\nand young people. One of the most important areas for\r\nthis work is in preventing mother-to-child HIV\r\ntransmission.\r\nAn important component in assessing progress\r\nmade in implementing the goals of the Cairo\r\nConference is a comprehensive analysis of the problem\r\nof international migration. The Programme of Action\r\nrecognizes the positive impact of international\r\nmigration on the recipient and source countries, as well\r\nas on the transit countries. For many reasons,\r\npopulation migration will play a particularly important\r\nrole in helping to achieve strategically necessary levels\r\nof stable demographic development for Russia in\r\nfuture decades. It is through migration that Russia can\r\nmitigate the negative effects of depopulation and\r\npopulation ageing in the near future.\r\nAt this time when the world is confronting a\r\ngrowing threat of terrorism, obtaining reliable and\r\ndetailed information about international migration is\r\nbecoming exceptionally important. One of the major\r\nconditions for that is to have uniform standards for\r\nstatistics relating to international migration. Those\r\nstandards must become the basis for comprehensive,\r\ninternationally comparable information for all national\r\nstatistics offices. We think it is essential to do more\r\nwork in this area.\r\nIn addition to our own efforts, the Government of\r\nthe Russian Federation attaches great importance to\r\ninternational cooperation in the area of population. For\r\nRussia, it is still crucial to have resolute support for\r\nour reforms in the sociodemographic sphere. We hope\r\nto develop cooperation on those issues, both through\r\nour traditional bilateral partners and with our\r\nmultilateral organizations, including the United\r\nNations system and primarily the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund.\r\nMr. Løvald (Norway): “We are gathered here to\r\nanswer a moral call to action.” These were the opening\r\nwords of Gro Harlem Brundtland, former Norwegian\r\nprime minister, in her keynote address to the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD) in Cairo 10 years ago. The Cairo\r\nConference answered the call by formulating a\r\nProgramme of Action that was a milestone in the\r\nhistory of women’s rights and an equally important\r\nachievement in the field of population and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nBut even more important, in the course of the last\r\n10 years the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA), together with its partners in development,\r\nhas succeeded in making the Cairo Programme a\r\nguiding instrument for action. The Programme has\r\nbecome core thinking and practice internationally, and\r\nit is a very encouraging sign that every region in the\r\nworld is reaffirming its commitment to the Programme.\r\nThis year’s State of the World Population Report shows\r\nthat significant steps have been taken to follow up the\r\nCairo agenda. We would like to take this opportunity to\r\ncommend Thoraya Obaid for her commitment and\r\nleadership, and to say how much we welcome the news\r\nof her continuing three more years in office.\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nIn 2000, world leaders committed the global\r\ncommunity to achieving the Millennium Development\r\nGoals (MDGs). Meeting the ICPD goals is both\r\nconsistent with and essential to the achievement of the\r\nMDGs. We will not reach the MDGs if we fail to\r\nsafeguard the reproductive rights and services\r\nenshrined in the ICPD Programme of Action.\r\nWhile focusing on 2015, we are gathered here to\r\nreaffirm and reinforce our efforts to meet the Cairo\r\ncommitments. Gender equality and empowering\r\nwomen continues to be an all-encompassing and\r\nparamount challenge. The current high global rate of\r\nmaternal mortality and incidence of women with birth-\r\nrelated injuries and disabilities tells a story of women\r\nwithout security or rights, disempowered and deprived\r\nof human dignity. We need gender equality in order to\r\nachieve universal access to reproductive health\r\nservices, to reduce poverty and to promote sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe would like to join the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund in emphasizing the fact that the fight\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS is linked to reproductive and sexual\r\nhealth. We need an integrated and concerted approach\r\nto halting the spread of this pandemic and improving\r\naccess to reproductive health services. To ignore the\r\nlink between HIV/AIDS and reproductive health is to\r\nmiss the opportunity to help millions of women, men\r\nand their families and prevent unnecessary suffering\r\nand untimely death. We are facing the largest youth\r\ngeneration in history, and we have a common\r\nresponsibility to secure reproductive rights and\r\nuniversal access to reproductive services, and to\r\nprevent and stem the spread of sexually transmitted\r\ninfections, HIV/AIDS, and unwanted pregnancies. This\r\ntask is more urgent than ever.\r\nPopulation policies and reproductive health and\r\nrights are fundamentally about people. The work of\r\ncivil society organizations, in partnership with other\r\nrelevant actors, is an indispensable part of our efforts\r\nto reach out to people and to secure their rights.\r\nNorway remains fully committed to the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action: the Norwegian Government\r\nplans to increase overall official development\r\nassistance (ODA) to 0.95 per cent of gross national\r\nincome (GNI) for the next year, and this includes\r\nadditional support to the United Nations Population\r\nFund. Education is priority number one in Norwegian\r\ninternational development policy. By focusing on\r\neducation, with special emphasis on girls, we are\r\naddressing the underlying causes of gender imbalance\r\nand poverty. The Norwegian Government will shortly\r\nbe launching a new development strategy for children\r\nand youth in the South. The motto of the strategy is:\r\n“There is not one reason to promote the rights and\r\nwelfare of children and youth, there are two billion\r\nreasons.” The strategy reflects the importance the\r\nGovernment attaches to population issues and sexual\r\nand reproductive health and rights issues, and\r\nespecially its concern about the vulnerability of\r\nchildren and young people.\r\nTo reaffirm and reinforce our efforts will be a test\r\nof solidarity and ability to act on our commitments.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): Ten years ago in\r\nCairo we reaffirmed that population growth is an\r\nimportant element in the development process. There,\r\nwe agreed on an action plan with a strong sense of\r\nownership and commitments for partnership. Today, we\r\nmeet a decade later to take stock of our achievements\r\nsince then.\r\nDespite a significant drop in the growth rate\r\nbetween 1994 and 2004, 784 million persons have been\r\nadded to the world population. The growth rate of the\r\nleast developed countries remained especially high, at\r\n2.4 per cent per year. During the period 2004 to 2015,\r\n52 countries — accounting for 14 per cent of the\r\nworld’s population — are still expected to experience\r\ngrowth rates above 2 per cent per year. Of those 52, 31\r\nare least developed countries. Population growth\r\nremains a valid and vital issue in development and that\r\nrenders the achievement of the International\r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD)\r\ngoals a categorical imperative.\r\nIn Bangladesh, a country of 135 million, through\r\nan appropriate macroeconomic and social policy mix\r\nwe have addressed this problem with a considerable\r\ndegree of success. Some of that success can be\r\nmeasured in terms of reduced population growth and\r\nfertility rates, increased life expectancy and expanded\r\nchild immunization. I do not intend to burden the\r\nAssembly with statistics. I shall, nevertheless, mention\r\na few to underscore my point. The fertility rate in\r\nBangladesh has declined from 6.3 per woman in 1973\r\nto 2.9 in 2000. The contraceptive prevalence rate has\r\nreached approximately 54 per cent, as compared with\r\napproximately 25 per cent in 1985. The under-five\r\nmortality rate has declined from 133 per 1,000 live\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nbirths in 1992 to 94 in 2000. During the same period\r\nthe infant mortality rate has also decreased from 94 to\r\n66 per 1,000 live births. Those are but a few examples.\r\nIn Bangladesh, according to the World Bank, the\r\npopulation growth rate has been reduced at a rate that\r\nis unprecedented in recorded history.\r\nThe Government is focusing on behavioural-\r\nchange communication campaigns to promote a wider\r\nchoice of contraceptives, address adolescent fertility,\r\npromote gender equity and equality and improve access\r\nto maternal and emergency obstetric care services.\r\nEleven ministries, one private-sector organization, one\r\nuniversity and all municipalities are involved in the\r\nprocess of integrating reproductive health and gender\r\nconcerns into social development efforts. The World\r\nBank stated in a recent report that Bangladesh was\r\nundergoing a demographic transition at a low income\r\nlevel without resorting to coercive measures. We thank\r\nour bilateral and multilateral development partners for\r\ntheir support. We particularly laud the role of the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund.\r\nA pragmatic approach by the Government, based\r\non sustained and firm commitments towards ICPD\r\ngoals, a strategy based on maternal and child health, an\r\nextensive network of field workers and clinics, a\r\ncommitted field force with women-to-women services,\r\ndecentralized service delivery through satellite clinics\r\nand Expanded Programme on Immunization centres, all\r\nhave greatly contributed to those achievements.\r\nNevertheless, we feel it was our investment in\r\neducation — for both children and adults — that has\r\nbeen the most vital element in that process.\r\nFor more than a decade education has been\r\naccorded one of highest priorities in our fiscal\r\nallocations. We have significantly increased the budget\r\nfor primary, secondary and girl’s education, primary\r\nhealth care and social development. We have been able\r\nto substantially increase primary school enrolment,\r\nwhich now stands at 80 per cent —one of the highest\r\nlevels in developing world. We have achieved gender\r\nparity in enrolment at the primary and lower secondary\r\nlevels. Government efforts are being supplemented by\r\nnon-governmental organizations, with another home-\r\ngrown concept — non-formal education — being\r\nimplemented with State collaboration. That programme\r\ntargets children between 8 and 10 years of age who\r\nhave left or have never attended school. Similar\r\nprogrammes are run for adults, and the adult literacy\r\nrate has surged to 64 per cent as compared with 34 per\r\ncent a decade ago.\r\nAs noted by the Secretary-General, the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly\r\nthe eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, cannot\r\nbe achieved if questions of population and reproductive\r\nhealth are not adequately addressed. Indeed, the full\r\nimplementation of the ICPD Programme of Action is a\r\nsine qua non for the achievement of the MDGs.\r\nBangladesh remains firmly committed to the\r\nprinciples, goals and targets of the ICPD and the key\r\nactions identified in that regard. We believe that\r\ndevelopment remains primarily a national\r\nresponsibility — domestically owned and driven. The\r\ninitiatives taken so far to that end have been, in our\r\nview, moving in the right direction. We are making our\r\nbest efforts. We have achieved some progress, but they\r\nstill fall short of the ICPD goals. We remain resource-\r\nstrapped. To achieve our targets, there must be a\r\ngreater flow of resources to the developing world from\r\nour partners. Responding to the concepts of\r\npartnership, the global community has made a series of\r\ncommitments. They must be honoured. Assurances\r\ngiven must be kept. Assistance is needed to build our\r\ncapacity for a better future for all — an aspiration that\r\nmust be brought to fruition.\r\nMr. Latheef (Maldives): Maldives is currently\r\ngoing through an unprecedented phase of social and\r\neconomic development. Having experienced rapid\r\neconomic growth and sustained social development\r\nduring most of the past two decades, population growth\r\nrates are now falling steeply.\r\nCurrent population projections suggest that this\r\nyear Maldives is witnessing a very momentous stage in\r\nits demographic transition. This year, our population\r\ninclude the largest number of adolescents that the\r\ncountry will probably ever have. The repercussions of\r\nthat demographic wave will be felt for many years to\r\ncome as those adolescents pass through the various\r\nstages of the population age structure.\r\nThe most immediate concern of the country at the\r\nmoment is to expand the job market through economic\r\ngrowth and diversification, while at the same time\r\nproviding the large numbers of adolescents with the\r\nright type of training and skills to enable them to take\r\nadvantage of the employment opportunities that will be\r\navailable to them as they become job seekers over the\r\nnext few years. That calls for a multifaceted approach\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nto address the needs of the adolescents of today. In\r\naddition to addressing the issues of adolescent health\r\nand nutrition, appropriate policy and adequate\r\ninvestment in the development of human capital during\r\nthe current decade are crucial for the country’s long-\r\nterm sustainability.\r\nThe dispersal of our population across 200\r\nislands scattered over 90,000 square kilometres of\r\nocean presents major challenges in providing essential\r\nhealth-care services — challenges both for providers\r\nand for clients, in terms of costs and timeliness.\r\nFurthermore, poor inter-island transport and\r\nenvironmental conditions, such as abrupt and\r\nunexpected changes in weather and lack of cultivable\r\nland on the islands, make the lack of food security a\r\nvery real threat for our communities. Those are just\r\nsome of the harsh realities we have to encounter on a\r\nfairly regular basis.\r\nRelated to those challenges, recent studies have\r\nrevealed that undernutrition is a major problem among\r\nthe Maldivian population. Among children under the\r\nage of five, one in four is affected by stunting and\r\n30 per cent are underweight. Those conditions, as we\r\nknow, are more prevalent among girls: here, Maldives\r\nis no exception. Overcoming the problem of\r\nundernutrition is a major priority for the country,\r\nbecause we realize its long-lasting implications for the\r\nquality of life of individuals and the sustainability of\r\nthe social and economic development of the whole\r\nnation.\r\nRapid economic growth has increased the\r\ndevelopmental gap between the urban and the rural\r\npopulations. Similarly, it has increased urbanization\r\nand urban congestion, creating serious disparities\r\nwithin the urban population. There is an urgent need to\r\naddress these issues related to urban population\r\ngrowth.\r\nDespite these challenges, Maldives has managed\r\nto improve the quality of life of its citizens\r\nsignificantly over the past few decades. Most\r\nindicators of social development have improved\r\nsteadily.\r\nThe generous contributions made by our bilateral\r\nand multilateral development partners and particularly\r\nthe support of the United Nations and its various\r\nagencies, have been crucial in these achievements. The\r\nProgramme of Action of the International Conference\r\non Population and Development (ICPD) and the\r\nMillennium Development Goals have been sources of\r\ngreat inspiration that, in addition to providing us with\r\nclear directions, have given us the courage and\r\nconfidence to forge ahead with our development ideals.\r\nWe in Maldives take immense pride in these\r\naccomplishments. However, we cannot afford to be\r\ncomplacent. Several areas of priority concern remain to\r\nbe addressed. Issues of population congestion,\r\novercrowded housing, growing youth unemployment\r\nand increasing rates of drug abuse and delinquency\r\nneed to be addressed urgently. Emphasis needs to be\r\nplaced on enhancing the quality of education and\r\nhealth care, providing employment opportunities for\r\nthe growing numbers of secondary school leavers and\r\nestablishing a social safety net for the elderly, the\r\nneedy and the deprived on a gender-parity basis, while\r\nensuring equity or access both within urban and rural\r\npopulations and between urban and rural populations.\r\nOvercoming these hurdles could be daunting for\r\nMaldives in the face of graduation from least\r\ndeveloped country status in the absence of the kind of\r\nsupportive mechanism that is currently under\r\nformulation to sustain socio-economic growth. In this\r\ncontext, I wish to express my profound gratitude to our\r\ndevelopment partners and to the United Nations system\r\nfor their understanding and for the care with which\r\nthey are proceeding to address this important issue.\r\nI should like to assure the Assembly that\r\nMaldives remains committed to implementing the\r\nICPD Programme of Action with a renewed spirit. We\r\nare confident that our development partners will\r\ncontinue to extend their full support to us in our\r\nefforts.\r\nOn behalf of my Government and on my own\r\naccount, I would like to express my sincere gratitude\r\nand heartfelt thanks to the United Nations, in particular\r\nthe United Nations Population Fund, for having\r\norganized this gathering. I wish the ICPD every\r\nsuccess.\r\nMr. MacKay (New Zealand): Population and\r\nreproductive health rights are among the most sensitive\r\nissues that we confront at the United Nations. They are\r\nthe most personal of choices. They have fundamental\r\nand far-reaching public significance. They are at once\r\nissues of human rights and of human development.\r\nThe agreement forged at the International\r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD) in\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\n1994 is all the more remarkable given those\r\nsensitivities. The Cairo Conference was, in every\r\nsense, a landmark event, and, along with others, New\r\nZealand today reflects with pride on that achievement.\r\nThe ICPD now occupies a place at the centre of the\r\ninternational human rights and development\r\narchitecture. New Zealand reaffirms it without\r\nequivocation.\r\nTen years on, the Cairo Programme of Action\r\nremains as important to New Zealand today as it was\r\nthen. It is chiefly as a result of that international\r\nconsensus that progress on these issues has been made.\r\nIt provided us all with the momentum and the mandate.\r\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark has recently\r\nsigned the World Leaders Statement on ICPD to\r\nunderscore New Zealand’s commitment.\r\nNevertheless, the facts remain grim. The\r\nimplementation of reproductive health rights falls short\r\nof the target in many parts of the world. Men and\r\nwomen continue to suffer or die in circumstances that\r\nare preventable. The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to\r\nspread and is having an impact on human development\r\nin all regions, including New Zealand’s own, the\r\nPacific. These facts demand continuing international\r\nattention and accelerated action.\r\nI would like to highlight the concern of my\r\nGovernment that discrimination is continuing to\r\nimpede access to sexual and reproductive health\r\ninformation and services. All too often, individuals are\r\ndenied such access because of their age, gender,\r\nmarital status, sexual orientation or other status, or\r\nbecause they are too poor to afford access to safe care\r\nand services. New Zealand calls upon States to\r\neliminate all forms of discrimination in population\r\npolicy decisions. Prescriptive religious solutions to this\r\nproblem are as illusory as they are dangerous.\r\nNew Zealand would like to commend the very\r\nimportant work of the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA). New Zealand remains a steadfast supporter\r\nof UNFPA’s mission and work, and is providing an\r\nincreasing amount of core and non-core resources to\r\nthe Fund. Following the withdrawal of one major\r\ndonor, New Zealand was able to make additional,\r\nextraordinary core resources available to UNFPA to\r\nhelp make up the shortfall. We encourage all donors,\r\nand other countries in a position to do so, to support\r\nUNFPA’s work through the provision of adequate\r\nfunding.\r\nFor its part, New Zealand is continuing to grapple\r\nwith the complex issues of population and reproductive\r\nhealth. New Zealanders, like others, can be reticent\r\nabout discussing them. New Zealand has seen an\r\nincrease in unplanned pregnancies, abortion and\r\nsexually transmitted infections with long-term\r\nconsequences for health and fertility. The New Zealand\r\nGovernment is responding by consulting closely with\r\nthe community and by implementing a sexual and\r\nreproductive health strategy.\r\nNew Zealand honours its commitment made at\r\nCairo by placing a high priority on the right to sexual\r\nand reproductive health, HIV/AIDS education for all\r\nand gender equality in our international development\r\nassistance programme. We fund programmes that\r\neducate and empower people, especially women, by\r\nincreasing their choices and access to maternal-child\r\nhealth care, sexual and reproductive health care and\r\ntheir ability to protect themselves from and, if\r\nnecessary, to live with, HIV/AIDS.\r\nLast year, my Government consulted New\r\nZealanders on what they wanted for themselves and\r\ntheir families. The response was clear. They want to be\r\npart of a society in which individuals have the\r\nknowledge, skills and confidence to enjoy their\r\nsexuality, to choose when or if to have children and to\r\nkeep themselves safe from harm. These are simple\r\nwants. They are universal human rights.\r\nOn this important occasion, States should put\r\naside politics and look at the facts of population and\r\ndevelopment. If the world is to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015, then we must also\r\nachieve the ICPD goals. Without one, we cannot\r\nachieve the other. Today, New Zealand once more adds\r\nits voice to the growing call for the full implementation\r\nof the commitments agreed upon at Cairo 10 years ago.\r\nMr. Pak Gil Yon (Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea): I hope that this colourful event will be an\r\nimportant opportunity not only to enhance social\r\nawareness of population and development,\r\nreproductive health and gender equality issues, but also\r\nto reaffirm Member States’ political commitments to\r\nthe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD) Programme of Action and to the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, and to further\r\ncommon efforts and cooperation among Member\r\nStates.\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nInsufficient reproductive health services, the\r\nprevalence of HIV/AIDS, poverty and a lack of\r\nfinancial resources represent major hindrances to\r\nresolving population issues. In particular, the economic\r\nstagnation and poverty aggravation caused by the\r\nnegative effects of globalization, as well as all forms of\r\nconflict and natural disasters, further complicate the\r\ntask of resolving population-related issues in the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nIn that regard, I would like briefly to mention the\r\nview of my delegation on the concerted efforts of, and\r\ncooperation among, Member States to resolve\r\npopulation issues.\r\nFirst, every country should show firm political\r\nwill and strong leadership to reaffirm and put into\r\neffect its commitment pledged at the ICPD and at the\r\nMillennium Summit. It is important for each country to\r\nmap out and implement a population policy and a\r\nnational action plan for reproductive health, poverty\r\neradication and economic development that conforms\r\nto its own situation, and to concentrate national\r\nattention on social issues through concerted efforts and\r\nby investing in that area.\r\nSecondly, it is necessary to create a regional and\r\ninternational environment that is favourable to the\r\nsuccessful resolution of population issues — including\r\nreproductive health and poverty eradication — and to\r\nactive cooperation in that field. It is therefore essential\r\nto respect the sovereignty and right to development of\r\nother countries and nations, as that will allow for the\r\nestablishment of a truly cooperative relationship\r\namong countries on the basis of the principle of\r\nequality, mutual benefit and non-interference in other’s\r\ninternal affairs, with a view to ending unreasonable\r\nsanctions and blockades and creating a fair\r\ninternational economic order.\r\nIf the developed countries fulfil their\r\ncommitment to invest 0.7 per cent of their gross\r\ndomestic product in official development assistance\r\nand take measures to allocate 4 per cent of official\r\ndevelopment assistance to population issues, that will\r\nbe of substantial assistance in resolving issues related\r\nto populations, reproductive health and poverty\r\neradication.\r\nEven during the past 10 years — a difficult\r\nperiod in the history of the country — the Government\r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has\r\nmade substantial efforts in the area of population and\r\ndevelopment, in consonance with the realities of the\r\ncountry, as it attaches great importance to the ICPD\r\nProgramme of Action given the Programme’s direct\r\nconnection with the future development of the country\r\nand the improved well-being of the people.\r\nUnder the wise leadership of the great leader\r\nGeneral Kim Jong Il, the Government has set out the\r\nconstant improvement of the people’s well-being as the\r\nsupreme principle underlying State activities and has\r\npaid close attention and made strong efforts to promote\r\nthe health of the people and the qualitative growth of\r\nthe population.\r\nDespite the difficult situation of the country as a\r\nresult of many years of natural disasters, the\r\nGovernment has continued to enforce laws such as the\r\nLaw on Public Health, family laws and the Law on\r\nGender Equality. The country has a compulsory and\r\nfree educational system as well as a free medical care\r\nsystem, thereby taking care of women and children at\r\nState and public expense.\r\nThe Government has systematically improved\r\nwomen’s well-being, including reproductive health\r\nservices through the “section-doctor system”, and has\r\nbeen working to resolve the main population-related\r\nissues, such as environmental protection, the\r\nurbanization of the population, family planning, and\r\nageing.\r\nThe Government has acceded to the International\r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women, taken an active part in\r\ninternational activities related to population and\r\ndevelopment, and has strengthened international and\r\nregional cooperation in that field.\r\nReaffirming its support for the ICPD Programme\r\nof Action, the Government of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea will in future, as it has in the past,\r\ncontinue to make every possible effort to implement\r\nthe Programme of Action and to closely cooperate with\r\ninternational organizations, including the United\r\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA), and the\r\ninternational community in order to promote the well-\r\nbeing of the people and achieve the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of the country.\r\nMr. Montealegre (Philippines): It is an honour\r\nfor the Philippines to participate in the commemoration\r\nof the tenth anniversary of the International Conference\r\non Population and Development (ICPD). The\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nPhilippines associates itself with the statement of the\r\nrepresentative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nFor my delegation, today marks a time for\r\ncelebration and a moment for reflection. It is a time to\r\ncelebrate the achievement of the goals set out by the\r\nICPD Programme of Action and an opportunity to\r\ncontemplate ways to address the lack of — or slow —\r\nprogress in the realization of the commitments made in\r\nthe area of population and development goals over the\r\npast 10 years.\r\nThis is also an excellent opportunity to assess our\r\nICPD accomplishments at the national level, share our\r\nexperiences in achieving them, and identify effective\r\nmethods for advancing population goals, reproductive\r\nhealth, gender equity and women’s empowerment —\r\nall geared to hastening the process of achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\nThe population policy of the Philippines\r\nunderwent a paradigm shift from the context of\r\ndemographic targeting to a recognition that population\r\nis part of the human development agenda. Embodied in\r\na client-centred, integrated reproductive-health\r\napproach, the Philippine Population Management\r\nProgram (PPMP) has been incorporated since 1993 in\r\nthe Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan,\r\nfocusing on the improvement of the quality of life of\r\nthe Filipinos.\r\nOver the years, the Philippines has registered\r\nmilestones in the implementation of the ICPD\r\nProgramme of Action in terms of policy reforms,\r\nlegislative directions, and participation of civil society\r\nand other sectors, as well as the use of innovative\r\nstrategies in the dissemination of information on the\r\nGovernment’s population and reproductive-health\r\ngoals. That implementation was facilitated by the\r\nstrong support of both the executive and the legislative\r\nbranches of the Government, leading to major policy\r\nand programme changes that address the needs of\r\nindividuals and families.\r\nOn policy reform, the Government’s policy under\r\nthe PPMP is anchored in responsible parenthood, or the\r\nability of couples to decide freely on the timing and\r\nsize of their families; respect for life, or protection of\r\nthe lives of the unborn; proper birth spacing; and\r\ninformed choice, where couples and individuals are\r\nprovided with all of the necessary information on\r\nnatural and artificial methods of family planning.\r\nSignificant gains were also achieved in the\r\nlegislative area. These include the Anti-Violence\r\nAgainst Women and Their Children Act of 2004; the\r\nAnti-Rape Law, passed in 1997; the creation of family\r\ncourts, which have original jurisdiction over cases of\r\ndomestic violence and other forms of abuse; and the\r\nPaternity Act of 1996, which encourages men to take\r\nresponsibility for their sexual and reproductive\r\nbehaviour and participate equally with women in all\r\nareas of family and household responsibilities.\r\nOther legislative measures passed were aimed at\r\nachieving coverage and delivery in the area of health\r\nservices, such as the National Health Insurance Act and\r\nthe Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act; the\r\nstrengthening of the role of women, youth, indigenous\r\npeoples and the elderly in development — such as the\r\nWomen in Development and Nation-Building Act, the\r\nYouth in Nation-Building Act, the Indigenous Peoples’\r\nRights Act, and the Senior Citizens Act — and\r\nprotecting the welfare of women, children and migrant\r\nworkers and their families through such measures as\r\nthe Anti-Discrimination Against Women Act, and the\r\nMigrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act, among\r\nothers.\r\nThe past decade also witnessed the active\r\nparticipation of non-governmental organizations\r\n(NGOs), private sector and other sectors of civil\r\nsociety such as women, men, labour organizations,\r\nyouth, academia, the religious sector and the media, in\r\nmobilizing support for population issues and\r\nreproductive health. They formally organized\r\nthemselves into alliances for a sustained and\r\nsynchronized advocacy for policy reforms on\r\npopulation issues and reproductive health.\r\nWe likewise made progress in the area of\r\ninformation, education and communication of policies\r\nand programmes geared to educate the people about the\r\nissues surrounding population and their reproductive\r\nhealth. The Government has adopted both non-\r\ntraditional and creative approaches, such as theatre\r\npresentations, concerts and the literary and creative\r\narts to disseminate and popularize the Government’s\r\nefforts nationwide.\r\nMoreover, the Philippine Government has\r\nundertaken steps towards the following:\r\ninstitutionalizing the Philippine Population\r\nExpenditures Account, which is envisioned as a\r\nmonitoring and advocacy tool for encouraging a\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\ngreater allocation of resources for population and\r\nreproductive health issues; addressing the issues\r\nrelated to service delivery through capacity-building\r\nfor service providers and partnerships with local\r\nGovernments, NGOs and the private sector; and\r\nencouraging a greater acceptance and practice of\r\nfamily planning methods through the Family Planning\r\nSocial Acceptance campaign.\r\nLikewise, in support of population data and\r\ninformation management, the Commission on\r\nPopulation of the Philippines, in coordination with the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund, has developed and\r\ninstalled the Demographic and Socio-Economic\r\nIndicator System to address the inadequacy of data on\r\npopulation and reproductive health.\r\nThese are some of the landmark achievements\r\nand innovative approaches of the Philippines over the\r\nlast decade on ICPD implementation. However, with a\r\npopulation that stands at 76.5 million since 2002, and a\r\ngrowth rate of 2.3 per cent, the Philippines remains\r\nconfronted by socio-economic challenges that demand\r\na holistic and comprehensive approach. Cognizant of\r\nour commitments to the ICPD goals, the Philippines\r\ncontinues to pursue further efforts to achieve a\r\nfavourable balance between population distribution and\r\neconomic activities.\r\nOn a final note, the Philippines believes that\r\nsuccess in the implementation of the ICPD Programme\r\nof Action depends on the efforts of every sector in\r\nindividual countries. However, international\r\ncooperation would contribute greatly to this\r\nimplementation, especially in countries that lack\r\nadequate resources. In this respect, we call on our\r\ndeveloped partners who have not yet done so to do\r\ntheir share in fulfilling their commitments to allocate\r\n0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official\r\ndevelopment assistance. We also urge them to renew\r\ntheir commitment to the ICPD and fulfil the agreed\r\ntargets for financial assistance.\r\nLastly, it is imperative for the General Assembly\r\nto look at the phenomenon of migration in line with the\r\nICPD goals. There is a need for closer international\r\ncooperation between the various countries involved, in\r\norder to fully manage the phenomenon of migration in\r\nan era of increasing globalization.\r\nMr. Al-Sibai (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I would like to commend the efforts of\r\nMs. Thoraya Obaid, Under-Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations and Executive Director of the United\r\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA), for her efforts to\r\ncommemorate the tenth anniversary of the United\r\nNations International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD), which was held in Cairo in\r\n1994. Its agenda included a set of principles, goals and\r\nprocedures to deal with population and development\r\nissues and with the great challenges they pose in a way\r\nthat achieves balance and coordination in the mutual\r\nrelationship between population and economic growth\r\nwithin the framework of sustainable development.\r\nThese goals are also aimed at meeting the population,\r\ndevelopment, social and environmental needs for\r\ncurrent and future generations and at raising the level\r\nand quality of life in different fields.\r\nSince the ICPD was held in Cairo, the Syrian\r\nArab Republic has undertaken many measures and\r\npolicies that focus on achieving the principles and\r\nobjectives that were set out by the ICPD. The most\r\nimportant of these are the following.\r\nFirst, in order to include population issues in\r\ndevelopment strategies, a national population\r\nconference was held in Damascus in November 2001,\r\nunder the slogan of “Harmony between population\r\ngrowth and socio-economic growth.” Secondly, we\r\nhave included, in the ninth five-year plan, for socio-\r\neconomic development for the years 2001 to 2005, a\r\nspecial section on population objectives, with the\r\npurpose of incorporating demographic changes in\r\ndevelopment plans and harmony between socio-\r\neconomic and population growth. Thirdly, we have\r\npromoted strengthening the role of civil society in the\r\nprocess of development. Fourthly, the National\r\nPopulation Committee was formed on 30 January 2003,\r\nunder the chairmanship of the Prime Minister and with\r\nthe participation of the relevant ministers, leaders of\r\nnon-governmental organizations and civil society\r\norganizations. Moreover, subcommittees were formed\r\non the subject of population and health throughout the\r\nprovinces of Syria.\r\nAs for improving the quality of life for Syria’s\r\npopulation and combating poverty, more investments\r\nwere made in the area of human resources and the\r\ngeneration of income, especially for those of limited\r\nincome. An unemployment association was\r\nestablished, aimed at resolving the unemployment\r\nproblem by granting soft loans for small and medium-\r\nsized projects, especially to youth. New rolling funds\r\nwere also set up in rural areas.\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nWith regard to the empowerment of women and\r\nachieving gender equality and equity, the following\r\nefforts were made. First, support was given to micro-\r\nenterprises run by women in the form of rolling funds.\r\nSecondly, the Convention on the Elimination of All\r\nForms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)\r\nwas ratified in 2002. Thirdly, women were given the\r\nright to inherit their pension funds. Fourthly, a general\r\nassociation for the family was established in order to\r\nstrengthen the role of the family in society. Fifthly,\r\nSyria continued to expand the participation of women\r\nin the legislative, executive and judicial branches of\r\nGovernment and various decision-making circles.\r\nIn terms of reproductive health, the infrastructure\r\nfor reproductive health service providers was improved\r\nand access to reproductive health services was\r\nfacilitated. Women’s rights to receive services and\r\ninformation on reproductive health were affirmed, the\r\nstaff that offer those services were developed and\r\ntrained and youth were enabled to have access to\r\nreproductive health care.\r\nWe also implemented programmes and\r\nestablished national funds that focus on the following\r\nissues: health, reproductive health, strategies for family\r\nplanning, and the development of population strategies,\r\nincentives and awareness-raising strategies. We also\r\ncoordinated closely with the United Nations Population\r\nFund (UNFPA) within the framework of the national\r\nprogrammes of coordination between Syria and\r\nUNFPA, the most recent of which was the sixth\r\nnational programme for 2002 to 2006.\r\nAll these efforts led to a decrease in the\r\npopulation growth rate from 3.4 in 1994 to almost 2.45\r\nat present. Moreover, there was an increase in school\r\nenrolment and a decrease in maternal mortality rates to\r\n65.4 for every 100,000 live births. There was an also\r\nincrease in life expectancy, which is now 70 years for\r\nmales and 71 for females and an improvement in and\r\nspread of reproductive health services.\r\nWe must exert more effort in the field of the\r\npopulation issues that are in line with the directives of\r\nour President, as stated in his speech during the eighth\r\nlegislative round in March 2003. In that statement, he\r\nsaid that we must not forget to focus on the most\r\nurgent issue, which is the high growth rate of the\r\npopulation in Syria, which consumes any increase in\r\neconomic growth rates, causes an increase in\r\nunemployment and hinders the provision of basic\r\nservices to citizens.\r\nAll countries of the world face the problem of\r\nmobilizing their resources. The Government of Syria is\r\nworking to provide and secure the financial resources\r\nrequired for national activities carried out in\r\naccordance with the Cairo Programme of Action and\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, which are\r\nfinanced from the Government’s regular budget and by\r\nnon-governmental and civil society organizations and\r\nUNFPA.\r\nSince 2002, the Syrian Government has increased\r\nits contribution to the regular resources of the Fund\r\nfrom 10 to 15 per cent of the total spending on\r\nprojects. That came from Government regular\r\nresources. Moreover, our contribution will increase\r\nagain in 2005, and to support projects in Syria, we will\r\nallocate special funding for the purchase of family\r\nplanning needs, to be put at the disposal of UNFPA to\r\ncarry out their programmes. However, the resources\r\ncurrently available are inadequate. Resources for\r\nimplementing projects and programmes in the area of\r\npopulation, development and reproductive health are\r\ninsufficient, but the Government is seeking to increase\r\nsuch resources in order to cover the expenses of\r\nimplementing the aforesaid projects.\r\nWe have also made efforts to carry out a national\r\npopulation strategy in order to ensure economic\r\nbenefits and achieve linkage between population\r\ngrowth and economic growth in order to improve the\r\nquality of life and to fulfil human development and\r\nsustainable development needs in line with the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nMr. Toro Jiménez (Venezuela) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): We are meeting today to commemorate the\r\ntenth anniversary of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development. The Conference\r\nunanimously adopted the Programme of Action, which,\r\nin 1994, defined for the next 20 years the collective\r\ncourse of international and national policies to assist\r\nour Governments in implementing measures for\r\nreproductive health, the rights of women and a healthy,\r\nbalanced and productive population. On this occasion,\r\nthe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reaffirms its\r\ncommitment, shared by 179 countries, to carry out\r\npolicies and programmes inspired by the principles\r\nunderlying the Programme of Action.\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nOur Constitution of 1999 fully incorporates the\r\nlegal and political principles concerning the\r\npopulation, economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. The Constitution provides the framework\r\nfor the plan for the nation’s economic and social\r\ndevelopment for the period from 2001 to 2007 in the\r\nareas of social and territorial equilibrium. Those\r\nguidelines are in accordance with the commitments\r\nmade at the Cairo Conference.\r\nIn accordance with the international community’s\r\naspirations and national efforts to eradicate poverty and\r\ninequality, as established in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and the Cairo Conference, my Government\r\nis carrying out at the national level, with\r\nextrabudgetary resources, a campaign against poverty\r\nthrough a set of programmes in the areas of education,\r\nhealth, labour, food and income improvement. Those\r\nprogrammes work to eliminate illiteracy, create\r\nopportunities for studies for those excluded from\r\nsecondary and university education, and provide\r\nprimary health care for those suffering diseases\r\nengendered by poverty. The campaign is being carried\r\nout with support from the sister Republic of Cuba. The\r\nprogrammes also include training for productive work\r\nin order to reduce unemployment, plans to encourage\r\nfarming in order to encourage domestic development\r\nand strengthen national sovereignty and immediate\r\nattention to the most urgent food needs of the poor. All\r\nthose plans are part of the so-called missions to\r\nencourage harmonious coordination of the various\r\nsectors of our national development.\r\nOne of the first results has been that we have\r\nimproved life expectancy. In addition, according to the\r\nmost recent indicators, 8 per cent of the Venezuelan\r\npopulation, which has been poor for more than 200\r\nyears, is now beginning to emerge from poverty. There\r\nare other important advances. For example, in the area\r\nof legislation, I should mention the adoption of the\r\norganic law on the comprehensive protection of\r\nchildren and adolescents and the law on violence\r\nagainst women and the family, as well as the creation\r\nand functioning of the National Institute for Women,\r\nwhich has been given considerable resources. In\r\naddition, we have instituted gender equality in the\r\nBolivarian Schools.\r\nThe commemoration of the International\r\nConference on Population and Development taking\r\nplace at this important moment of international life\r\ngives States greater opportunities for economic and\r\ntechnological resources in order to encourage\r\nsustainable development and mobilize and optimize\r\nhuman and financial resources to solve special and\r\ngeneral problems in this area.\r\nToday’s meeting is propitious for renewing the\r\npolitical will that inspired us on that occasion and for\r\nencouraging new alliances and commitments to\r\nimprove the quality of life of human beings, thus\r\nenabling them to fully enjoy their rights, with vision\r\nand a conviction in a new humanism.\r\nMr. Rastam (Malaysia): My delegation\r\nassociates itself with the statement made earlier by the\r\nrepresentative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nThe tenth anniversary of the International\r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD)\r\noffers us another opportunity to assess our\r\nachievements and look for further solutions to\r\nwhatever constraints we face in the implementation of\r\nthe ICPD Programme of Action and, ultimately, the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. The five-year review\r\nof the implementation of the Programme of Action of\r\nthe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD+5) showed that the ICPD goals\r\nwere relevant and that much progress had been made in\r\nadvancing them. At the same time, it was recognized\r\nthat more concerted action was also needed in a few\r\nareas, and additional benchmarks were set for four\r\npriority issues: education and literacy, reproductive\r\nhealth care, maternal mortality reduction and\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nAs we commemorate the tenth anniversary of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, ICPD+10, today, I would like to state\r\nthat Malaysia reaffirms its full commitment to the\r\nimplementation of the ICPD Programme of Action. We\r\nhave initiated changes when necessary in our\r\ndevelopment policies, including in programmes and in\r\ninstitutional and organizational frameworks. This has\r\nbeen done in order to support the strategy of\r\nintegrating population issues into all development\r\nplanning policies and programmes as envisaged in the\r\nICPD Programme of Action. We are fully conscious of\r\nthe need not to link population policies and\r\nprogrammes to demographic goals and targets, but\r\nrather to place population concerns at the heart of\r\nsustainable development in keeping with ICPD goals.\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nMalaysia’s current population programmes have\r\nbeen revised in accordance with the thematic areas of\r\nconcern and priorities of the country and in line with\r\nthe ICPD Programme of Action: population, family\r\ndevelopment and reproductive health in the context of\r\nsocial equitability, poverty alleviation and\r\nenvironmentally sound development. With the ICPD,\r\nthe integration of the economic, social, demographic\r\nand environmental dimensions of development has\r\nbeen further strengthened. Measures have also been\r\ntaken to promote sustainable consumption and\r\nproduction, protect the environment, sustainably\r\nmanage the resource base, enhance human, institutional\r\nand infrastructure capacity and improve the quality of\r\nlife of the people.\r\nAllow me to highlight some of the areas in which\r\nMalaysia has made significant gains. It has succeeded\r\nin reducing the incidence of poverty from 17.1 per cent\r\nin 1990 to less than 5 per cent in 2003. Under the\r\ncurrently implemented Eighth Malaysia Development\r\nPlan, for the period of 2001 to 2005, the thrust of our\r\npoverty eradication programme is to reduce the\r\nincidence of poverty to 0.5 per cent by the year 2005.\r\nMalaysian women have made significant progress\r\nin almost all areas of development in the last three\r\ndecades. The advancement of women in Malaysia is\r\nevident in many sectors, including in public and\r\npolitical life. Currently in the Cabinet there are three\r\nwomen Ministers — very dynamic ones — three\r\nwomen Deputy Ministers and six women Parliamentary\r\nSecretaries. There are 22 women members of\r\nParliament. Women make up 46.2 per cent of the civil\r\nservice, with a number of them highly placed in\r\ndecision-making positions. The maternal mortality\r\nratio is currently around 30 per 100,000. Women in\r\nMalaysia are expected to live to the age of 75.\r\nComparatively, Malaysian men have a life expectancy\r\nof 70 years.\r\nPrimary education is almost universal. The\r\nnational literacy rate is 91 per cent, while the rate\r\namong females aged 10 and above is 85 per cent.\r\nAlmost 70 per cent of undergraduates are females and\r\nthis has enabled almost half of the women to gain\r\nemployment. The participation of females in the labour\r\nforce has also increased from 41.9 per cent in 1991,\r\nprior to the ICPD, to 48 per cent in 2003.\r\nTo further demonstrate the Malaysian\r\nGovernment’s commitment towards gender equality\r\nand empowerment of women, the Ministry of Women\r\nand Family Development was established in February\r\n2001 with the objective of mainstreaming women in\r\nnation-building, ensuring the full integration and\r\nmaximum participation of women in national\r\ndevelopment and strengthening the family system so as\r\nto establish a quality generation. On 27 March 2004,\r\nthe Ministry was given added responsibility over a\r\nbroad range of social issues and it has since been\r\nnamed the Ministry of Women, Family and Community\r\nDevelopment.\r\nThe Plan of Action for the advancement of\r\nwomen, launched in 1997, is currently being reviewed.\r\nIn August 2001, the Federal Constitution was amended\r\nto eliminate discrimination on the basis of gender. A\r\ndatabase on women’s health is also being developed by\r\nthe Ministry of Women, Family and Community\r\nDevelopment to improve the status of women’s health.\r\nThe Government has also amended relevant legislation\r\non crimes against women, including laws relating to\r\nrape and domestic violence.\r\nMalaysia has also undertaken several initiatives\r\nto ensure that family planning services are provided\r\nunder the broader package of reproductive health. In\r\nthis regard, a central coordinating committee on\r\nreproductive health has also been formed to look into\r\nthe policies, strategies and optimal ways of integrating\r\nother reproductive health components into the primary\r\nhealth-care system and into family planning\r\nprogrammes.\r\nThe issue of HIV/AIDS is also being seriously\r\naddressed in Malaysia. Since the first case of AIDS\r\nwas reported in Malaysia in 1986, HIV/AIDS\r\nprevention and control programmes have been\r\nestablished. A nationwide campaign on HIV/AIDS was\r\nfirst launched in 1991 to provide gender sensitive\r\neducation about sexuality, life skills and behavioural\r\nchange. Free HIV testing and counselling are available\r\nin all Government hospitals and some health clinics. A\r\nspecial community mobilization programme for youth\r\nhas been in place since 1996. At the same time, efforts\r\nhave also continued towards gender-based programmes\r\nfor women and children through our Prevention of\r\nMother-to-Child Transmission of HIV Programme.\r\nThis has helped improve the chances of HIV-positive\r\nmothers delivering healthy babies.\r\nGiven prevailing demographic trends, it is\r\nprojected that by the year 2020, the number of elderly\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\npeople in Malaysia will constitute about 9.5 per cent of\r\nan estimated total population of 33.4 million. Although\r\nMalaysia is considered as having a “young”\r\npopulation, the early sensitization and consciousness-\r\nraising efforts of the Government on the issue of\r\nageing reflects its awareness of significant changes\r\ntaking shape in the demographic process. Over the\r\nyears, the Government has introduced various policies\r\nand programmes, such as the National Welfare Policy\r\nin 1990, the National Policy for Older Persons in 1995\r\nand the Plan of Action for Older Persons in 1998.\r\nThese are all aimed at improving the quality of life of\r\nolder persons and integrating them into the mainstream\r\nof development.\r\nThe role of civil society and non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs) as partners in the\r\nimplementation of population and related programmes\r\nhas also been recognized and supported in Malaysia.\r\nTheir involvement, participation and sharing of\r\nresources have been pivotal to the success of the\r\nGovernment’s population related programmes. Since\r\nICPD, annual dialogues between Government and the\r\nNGOs have been conducted to facilitate greater “smart\r\npartnership”. Recognizing their role, the Government\r\nhas also provided grants to those NGOs to enable them\r\nto play a more effective role in the activities and\r\nprogrammes in the country. For example, the\r\nGovernment works closely with the Malaysian AIDS\r\nCouncil, a leading NGO, to address the HIV/AIDS\r\nproblem.\r\nThe ICPD has demonstrated to the world that if\r\ncountries aspire to provide adequate opportunity for a\r\nbetter life to their citizens, they need to incorporate the\r\nappropriate population policies into their development\r\nstrategy. Malaysia is fully aware of that and remains\r\ncommitted to the ICPD objectives at the national,\r\nregional and international levels. However, we are\r\nconscious that many of the developing countries are\r\nstill unable to meet those basic goals for lack of\r\nfinancial and other resources. In that regard, it is\r\nimportant that adequate financial and technical\r\nresources be provided to them through various means.\r\nPromises made in the various international summits\r\nand conferences must be fulfilled by both developed\r\nand developing countries. For its part, Malaysia has\r\nextended its modest contribution, within its means,\r\ntowards assisting other developing countries in the\r\ncontext of South-South cooperation, including under\r\nthe Malaysia Technical Cooperation Programme.\r\nMr. Ayari (Tunisia) (spoke in French): To begin,\r\nI would like to convey our appreciation and esteem for\r\nthe efforts made by the United Nations Population\r\nFund (UNFPA), and in particular those of its Executive\r\nDirector, Ms. Thoraya Obaid, in seeking to implement\r\nthe commitments made at the Cairo Conference. The\r\ntenth anniversary of that Conference is of particular\r\nimportance to us as it is being held at a time when the\r\ninternational community is facing many challenges. It\r\nis also an important opportunity for us to take stock —\r\nto draw the necessary lessons and to assess the\r\nmeasures that need to be taken in order to attain the\r\ngoals we have set.\r\nDespite the accumulation of wealth and the\r\namazing technological progress that has been made, the\r\ninternational scene continues to present us with the\r\nparadoxical image of a world in which most people\r\nstill live in poverty and destitution, particularly in\r\nAfrica. In that context, it is of concern to us that, 10\r\nyears after Cairo, the objectives set by the international\r\ncommunity are still far from being implemented.\r\nIt is true that encouraging progress has been\r\nmade in implementing the goals of the Programme of\r\nAction of the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development (ICPD). There is greater awareness\r\nof problems relating to population and development\r\nand the need to mainstream those concerns into\r\ndevelopment strategies to combat poverty. There is\r\ngreater awareness of the drop in world population\r\ngrowth rates, and there has been an almost universal\r\ndrop in fertility rates. Birth spacing is being practised.\r\nMortality has dropped, and consequently life\r\nexpectancy has increased. Family planning and other\r\nreproductive health services have expanded, and access\r\nto education has improved, particularly for girls. The\r\nmeasures being taken to combat sexually transmitted\r\ndiseases, particularly HIV/AIDS have been enhanced,\r\nto fight those diseases more effectively.\r\nNevertheless, we must say that that progress has\r\nbeen unequal and, in many cases, insufficient. It has\r\nbeen acknowledged that if current trends continue,\r\nmany developing countries will not be able to\r\nimplement the commitments of the ICPD Programme\r\nof Action, which are essential for attaining the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. We note with concern\r\nthat, notwithstanding the efforts and sacrifices made,\r\nthe developing countries, particularly in Africa, have\r\nfallen far behind in implementing those goals. The\r\nelimination of poverty and malnutrition, the spread of\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic, difficulties in gaining access\r\nto reproductive health care and to drinking water and\r\nsanitation services, rapid population growth, increasing\r\nproblems caused by rapid urbanization — all these are\r\nareas where additional efforts need to be made.\r\nWe support the appeal made by UNFPA and\r\nechoed by delegations that have spoken from this\r\nrostrum regarding the need to guarantee proper\r\nfinancing of the Cairo agenda. If that agenda is not\r\nproperly funded it will be impossible to achieve the\r\nresults we hope to obtain. Clearly, the lack of resources\r\nis undermining UNFPA efforts to provide family\r\nplanning services, to reduce maternal mortality rates,\r\nto prevent HIV/AIDS and to meet the needs of young\r\npeople and of the poor. Indeed, it would also harm\r\nprogress made in the area of development and poverty\r\nreduction in poor countries.\r\nImplementing the Cairo commitments — or,\r\nindeed the commitments undertaken at other\r\nconferences and meetings held under United Nations\r\nauspices — requires the establishment of an enabling\r\ninternational environment: an increase in official\r\ndevelopment assistance, the establishment of a just and\r\nequitable trading system that promotes development,\r\nthe cancellation of debt and its rechanelling into social\r\nand environmental projects and the transfer of\r\ntechnologies to developing countries.\r\nWe also underscore the need to give greater\r\nattention to the problem of migration and the impact of\r\nmigration on development. Accordingly, we support\r\nthe convening of an international conference on\r\nmigration and development to identify ways to\r\noptimize international development migration trends.\r\nIn that regard, we welcome the decision of the General\r\nAssembly to have a high-level dialogue on that\r\nquestion in 2006.\r\nTunisia very much supports the principles of the\r\nCairo Programme of Action, and we wish to reiterate\r\nour commitment to its implementation. Our\r\ndevelopment approach is a comprehensive one,\r\ncombining economic development and social progress.\r\nIndeed, we believe that the ultimate goal of economic\r\ndevelopment is to ensure the promotion of the full\r\ndevelopment of humankind and to ensure the full\r\nexercise by the individual of his rights. Tunisia has\r\ninvested heavily in human development, and it is one\r\nof the countries that has significantly reduced its\r\npoverty rates, which now stand at 4.2 per cent. Today,\r\nthe middle class accounts for three quarters of our\r\npopulation. Life expectancy is 73.2 years, whereas it\r\nwas only 67 years in 1987.\r\nThe various components of our population policy,\r\nincluding increased school attendance for girls and\r\nboys — which now stands at 99 per cent — greater\r\ninvolvement of women in the job market and\r\nstrengthening mother-child health-care programmes,\r\nhave resulted in our control over demographic growth\r\ntrends, which now stand at just 1.1 per cent.\r\nWith regard to the position of women in Tunisia,\r\nwe would stress that Tunisian women have graduated\r\nfrom demanding their fundamental rights and have\r\nmoved on to the status of full partners in all areas of\r\nnational life.\r\nWe hope that this commemorative day will\r\nencourage the entire international community to\r\nreaffirm its commitment to the objectives of the\r\nProgramme of Action of the Cairo Conference and will\r\nlend new impetus to international solidarity to build a\r\nbetter future for the whole of humankind.\r\nMr. Menan (Togo) (spoke in French): First, I\r\nwish to underscore that the delegation of Togo\r\nassociates itself with the statement made this morning\r\nby Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77.\r\nSince the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development (ICPD), held in Cairo 10 years ago,\r\nTogo, despite the difficulties faced by developing\r\ncountries, and particularly the least developed among\r\nthem, has made notable progress in implementing the\r\nProgramme of Action of that Conference. Indeed, it is\r\nessential to emphasize that that Programme of Action\r\nhas been the principle reference document for the\r\nTogolese Government, one that has allowed us to solve\r\nour population problems and that has thereby\r\ncontributed to the reduction of poverty in all areas.\r\nThus conscious of the positive impact that the\r\nimplementation of the Cairo Programme of Action\r\nwould have on population in the medium and long\r\nterm, the Government of Togo was inspired to adopt a\r\nnational population policy in 1998, which since that\r\ntime has served as a guideline for all our activities\r\nundertaken in the field.\r\nIn reviewing our national policy on the occasion\r\nof the tenth anniversary of ICPD, policy makers noted\r\nthat population factors have a decisive impact on\r\npoverty, which unfortunately particularly exacerbates\r\n29\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nthe spread of HIV/AIDS. They also underscored that\r\nTogo’s national population policy is in perfect harmony\r\nwith the objectives of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, insofar as it guarantees the rights of populations\r\nto access reproductive health services without\r\ndiscrimination. That is why Togo has given priority to\r\ndemographic variables in finalizing its poverty\r\nreduction strategy paper.\r\nThe well-being of children is linked to and has a\r\ndirect impact on the health of the mother and on the\r\nentire family. We wish to reaffirm that it is\r\nindispensable to fight against both infant and maternal\r\nmortality in order to continue seeing the improvement\r\nof the well-being of populations. Furthermore, the\r\neconomic and social development of our countries\r\nmakes it necessary to maintain very close cooperation\r\nbetween institutions in the public sector and in civil\r\nsociety. In this respect, we commend the ever-\r\nincreasing role the non-governmental organizations\r\n(NGOs) are playing to help the people of Togo.\r\nQuestions concerning gender equality and equity\r\nand all forms of violence and exploitation with regard\r\nto women are also of major concern to us. That is why,\r\nin 1998, the National Assembly adopted a law in Togo\r\nprohibiting female genital mutilation.\r\nFollowing the ICPD guidelines, Togo has\r\nencouraged greater involvement of women in the\r\ngovernment decision-making process. Thus, women\r\nhave been increasingly represented at the National\r\nAssembly and in the Government. They also have\r\noccupied many posts in public and private\r\norganizations.\r\nA comparison of development indicators between\r\n1994 and 2004 indicates to us that, despite the difficult\r\nsituation of the country, the Government has quickly\r\ncommitted itself to implementing the ICPD\r\nrecommendations in order to improve the socio-\r\neconomic situation at the national level. This action\r\nwas reflected in the adoption and implementation of a\r\nnational population policy, a reproductive health\r\npolicy, and a strategic plan to combat HIV/AIDS.\r\nFurthermore, a National Council to Combat AIDS,\r\nunder the chairmanship of the Head of State, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Gnassingbé Eyadema, who signed the\r\ndeclaration of world leaders, is actively working\r\nthroughout the country. In addition, a national youth\r\npolicy is being prepared to better involve young\r\npeople. We must also point out that the enrolment of\r\ngirls in school is increasing, and there were\r\nconsiderably fewer drop outs.\r\nPursuant to the recommendations of the\r\nEconomic Commission for Africa (ECA) Ministerial\r\nConference of African countries held in Dakar in June\r\n2004 on the occasion of ICPD + 10, Togo is presently\r\ndrawing up a more dynamic plan of action aimed at\r\nbetter linking ICPD, the Millennium Development\r\nGoals and the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD).\r\nFurthermore, proper evaluation of the results of\r\nour action requires reliable indicators, and these\r\nindicators require data collection and good data\r\nprocessing. While resources are generally available in\r\nthe developed countries for that end, we must note that,\r\ndespite our efforts, conducting surveys and having\r\nreliable databases require considerable financial\r\ninvestment. Togo’s resources are very limited.\r\nFor this reason, Togo wishes to make a pressing\r\nappeal to the international community for increased\r\nfinancial support for UNFPA, so it can continue to help\r\nour country to carry out the Cairo Programme of Action\r\nand the recommendations of ICPD + 5 and ICPD + 10.\r\nThere is no doubt whatsoever that investing in the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations of ICPD is a\r\nsure way to combat poverty and to prevent conflict in\r\nthe world.\r\nThe Government of Togo reiterates its\r\ncommitment to implementing the conclusions and\r\nrecommendations of the regional review conference at\r\nDakar and thanks UNFPA for its constant support to\r\nTogo in its fight against poverty.\r\nMr. Dajer (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nColombia’s commitment to the International\r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD)\r\nand the Cairo Programme of Action is not only\r\nunswerving but also tangible in terms of its results that\r\nshow considerable progress in the different areas\r\ncovered by that instrument.\r\nColombia, the third country of Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean in terms of the size of its population, has\r\nbeen recognized for the progress it has made in its\r\ndemographic transition, the fact that we have surpassed\r\na considerable number of the thresholds agreed in\r\nCairo, and the progress we have made in promoting\r\nSouth-South cooperation in the field of population.\r\n30\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nDecreasing fertility rates, better health services\r\nand prevention of illnesses have helped increase life\r\nexpectancy. Child mortality is considerably lower than\r\nthe world average.\r\nColombia, in this event, is joining in\r\ncommemorating the tenth anniversary of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment and reaffirms its commitment to the full\r\nimplementation of the Cairo Programme of Action.\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): Azerbaijan welcomes\r\nthe opportunity to speak on this important agenda item.\r\nWe strongly support the approach that our work should\r\nbe based on the outcomes of all major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits, and that the coordinated\r\nfollow-up process should cover all the major United\r\nNations conferences and address the issue of\r\nimplementation. The process of reviewing\r\nimplementation, while preserving the identity and\r\nthematic unity of each conference and summit, is an\r\nimportant task and should be pursued with vigour.\r\nThe review and appraisal of the International\r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD)\r\nProgramme of Action provided us with the opportunity\r\nto renew our strong commitment to the implementation\r\nof the goals and principles agreed upon in Cairo in\r\n1994, as well as to review the progress achieved and\r\nthe challenges that remain.\r\nWe appreciate the work done by the United\r\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Population\r\nDivision of the Department of Economic and Social\r\nAffairs (DESA) in providing us with comprehensive\r\nreports and surveys on progress made in such\r\nimportant areas as reproductive health and family\r\nplanning, health and mortality, international migration\r\nand gender equality.\r\nTen years after Cairo, Azerbaijan remains\r\ncommitted to the principles and goals enshrined in the\r\nProgramme of Action and continues to work towards\r\ntheir comprehensive implementation. My country\r\nbelieves that the effective implementation of the Cairo\r\ngoals is closely linked to social and economic\r\ndevelopment. In spite of the progress achieved, we\r\nneed to reinforce our efforts in a number of priority\r\nareas in order to eliminate the existing barriers.\r\nThe international and regional events held this\r\nyear within the process of the ICPD review and\r\nappraisal have identified a number of common\r\nconcerns. The European Population Forum held in\r\nGeneva in January 2004 revealed dramatic differences\r\nin life expectancy and the well-being of the population,\r\nas well as the problems of the increase in trafficking in\r\nhuman beings and the incidence of HIV/AIDS in the\r\nwhole United Nations Economic Commission for\r\nEurope (ECE) region. Azerbaijan fully concurs with\r\nthe findings of the Forum, which emphasized the need\r\nto increase funding, share best practice models and\r\nmobilize local communities to address these issues, as\r\nwell as the necessity to set policy and regulatory\r\nframeworks, improve their coherence and promote\r\nhuman rights, good governance, transparency and\r\naccountability.\r\nIn my country, two major factors greatly affected\r\nthe situation in the field of population and\r\ndevelopment, as well as overall social and economic\r\ndevelopment there during the past decade. These two\r\nfactors are the transition period and armed conflict.\r\nThe first factor led to increased internal and external\r\nmigration. The social and economic crisis that emerged\r\nresulted in a decline in quality of life and an increase in\r\nthe maternal and child mortality rates.\r\nThe armed conflict and occupation of a\r\nsignificant part of Azerbaijani territories resulted in the\r\nemergence of some one million refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons. The policy of ethnic cleansing\r\npursued by Armenia against the Azerbaijani population\r\nhas caused the situation to deteriorate further and has\r\ndramatically affected the structure and distribution of\r\nthe population in my country.\r\nAzerbaijan came to Cairo in 1994 with more than\r\n400,000 women and nearly 200,000 children refugees\r\nand internally displaced persons living in extremely\r\ndifficult conditions in temporary shelters; hundreds of\r\nchildren had become orphans; and nearly 50,000\r\npeople had become disabled. Given the lack of safe\r\nwater and sanitation facilities, the number of cases of\r\ninfectious disease, such as hepatitis A, measles,\r\ndiphtheria and poliomyelitis, among this population\r\ngroup has increased. Women refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons living in tent camps suffered from\r\ngastric disorders, skin infections, malaria, tuberculosis,\r\nanaemia, mental illness and gynaecological disorders,\r\namong other things.\r\nThat situation was another important reason for\r\nus to join the international consensus in Cairo and\r\ncommit ourselves to eliminating existing problems and\r\n31\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nto strengthening our efforts to effectively address the\r\nmost acute problems of population and development.\r\nIn its follow-up to Cairo in 1999, Azerbaijan\r\nadopted a national strategy paper on population and\r\ndevelopment based on the Cairo principles. As set out\r\nin that paper, one of the main objectives of our national\r\npolicy in the field of population and development is to\r\ntackle the negative demographic trends and the\r\npromotion of population growth in line with overall\r\nnational development policy. The State programme on\r\npopulation has been further elaborated and submitted\r\nto the Cabinet of Ministers for consideration. The\r\nissues of reproductive health and reproductive rights,\r\nreducing the rate of maternal and child mortality,\r\nproviding adequate reproductive health services and\r\naddressing the issue of family planning, including,\r\ninter alia, the introduction of new methods of\r\ncontraception, have been selected as priority areas for\r\nfurther activities. The national programme on\r\nreproductive health has provided a good contribution to\r\nour poverty reduction and economic development\r\nstrategy paper.\r\nMy country attaches particular importance to the\r\nregulation of migration processes. We continue to take\r\nmeasures aimed at strengthening relevant national\r\nlegislation, eliminating illegal migration, protecting\r\nrights of migrant workers and establishing relevant\r\ninstitutional mechanisms to that end. This year, we\r\nadopted a concept paper for State policy in the field of\r\nmigration. A number of bilateral agreements have been\r\nsigned in the area of the social protection of migrant\r\nworkers. We have successfully cooperated with the\r\nInternational Organization for Migration on a cluster\r\nproject, which provides assistance in the repatriation of\r\nAzerbaijani citizens illegally residing in Western\r\nEuropean countries.\r\nFulfilling our commitment to promoting gender\r\nequality is another important priority. The issues of\r\nwomen’s health and their access to and use of\r\nreproductive health services, the education of women\r\nand girls and the elimination of violence against\r\nwomen remain major issues for our gender equality\r\npolicy. While we have established an institutional\r\nframework and are currently in the process of adopting\r\nthe relevant legislation, we still have much room for\r\nimprovement. Challenges remain in important areas\r\nsuch as the improvement of the situation of women in\r\nrural areas, the situation of women refugees and\r\ninternally displaced persons, strengthening the\r\neconomic and social status of women and promoting\r\ntheir increased participation in decision-making\r\nprocesses.\r\nFamily protection and family planning constitute\r\nan integral part of our policy in the field of population\r\nand development. The Government, in cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations Populations Fund (UNFPA),\r\nhas established a network of family planning centres,\r\nwhich provide medical and counselling services to\r\nfamilies. A legislative framework has been enacted to\r\nensure equal rights and the sharing of child-rearing\r\nresponsibilities between both parents. A set of\r\nmeasures aimed at supporting young families and\r\nfamilies with children is also being implemented.\r\nLast but not least, we would like to underline the\r\nkey role of the United Nations Population Fund in\r\npromoting the implementation of the outcome of the\r\nICPD at the national and international levels, and we\r\ncommend the Executive Director of the UNFPA,\r\nMs. Thoraya Obaid, for her valuable contribution to\r\nthat process. Azerbaijan once again reiterates its full\r\nsupport for the Fund and renews its commitment to\r\nfurther implement the ICPDs Programme of Action.\r\nMr. Thomson (United Kingdom): I am pleased to\r\nhave the opportunity to make a statement for the\r\nUnited Kingdom. In doing so, I should like fully to\r\necho and support the views expressed in the statement\r\nof the European Union Presidency.\r\nThe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, held at Cairo in 1994, marked a\r\nsignificant shift. It rejected the notion of population\r\ncontrol, doing away with demographic targets as the\r\nbasis of policy and instead putting people first. It put\r\npeople’s rights concerning their own reproductive\r\nhealth at the centre of the development agenda. Cairo\r\nalso underscored the importance of women’s\r\nempowerment and gender equality in the fight against\r\npoverty.\r\nThe ICPD has served as a force for positive\r\nchange in countries all over the world. That was\r\nrecognized most recently at the various United Nations\r\nregional commission meetings to assess progress\r\ntowards meeting ICPD goals. Countries’ overwhelming\r\nand continuing commitment to and ownership of the\r\nICPD agenda has been striking: striking, but not\r\nsurprising, because the Programme of Action has\r\nprovided a framework for policy, action and change for\r\nso many countries.\r\n32\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nThe ICPD Programme of Action also provides, of\r\ncourse, the foundation for many of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, and the key Cairo goal of\r\nreproductive health is relevant, and related, not only to\r\nthe health Millennium Goals but to all the Millennium\r\nGoals.\r\nI would like to take a minute to recall how the\r\nICPD Programme of Action and the Cairo goal of\r\nreproductive health are related to the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Reproductive health and choice\r\nhelp families escape poverty. Families that are able to\r\nspace the births of their children and plan the number\r\nof children they have can invest more in their children,\r\nincluding for basic necessities, schooling and\r\neducation, and so improve prospects for opportunity.\r\nAnd given the choice and the means, families often\r\ndecide to have fewer children.\r\nA rapidly growing population makes it harder for\r\nGovernments to keep up needed investments in health\r\nand education. So reproductive health, in providing a\r\nchoice, also has a role in achieving universal primary\r\neducation.\r\nReproductive health and rights are fundamental to\r\ngender equality and the empowerment of women. The\r\nability of women to control their own fertility and to be\r\nfree from violence and abuse seem obvious, yet are\r\nabsolutely basic aspects of women’s empowerment. If\r\nwomen are to take part fully in society, they must have\r\nbetter access to sexual and reproductive health and\r\nrights. There is more and more evidence to show how\r\nwomen able to make their own choices have more\r\nopportunities. So, reproductive rights are also essential\r\nto women’s human rights.\r\nThe links between reproductive health and child\r\nhealth are strong and well established, even though\r\nthey sometimes seem to be overlooked. So,\r\nreproductive health and family planning help to reduce\r\nchild mortality. Reproductive health and family\r\nplanning also play a key role in improving maternal\r\nhealth. Birth spacing helps to lower overall risk of\r\nmaternal death and injury. So, reproductive health\r\nsaves women’s lives.\r\nTurning to the Millennium Goal to combat\r\nHIV/AIDS and other diseases, there is wide\r\nrecognition that sexual and reproductive health\r\nservices provide an important opening for HIV\r\nprevention, as well as for preventing and treating other\r\nsexually transmitted infections. Adolescent sexual\r\nhealth and rights need special attention in order to stem\r\nthe AIDS epidemic and to decrease maternal death.\r\nBetter information, sex education and sexual and\r\nreproductive health services must be made available to\r\nall. And by contributing to slower population growth,\r\nreproductive health also plays a role in contributing to\r\nenvironmental sustainability.\r\nFinally, reproductive health provides a focus for a\r\nstronger global partnership for development, for\r\nexample through the kind of action needed to secure\r\nthe supply and availability of reproductive health\r\ncommodities. Too many people in poor countries are\r\nstill not able to get hold of basic reproductive health\r\nsupplies and contraceptives, including condoms.\r\nProgress has been made. But we all know that\r\nmuch more remains to be done. The United Kingdom\r\nunequivocally reaffirms the ICPD. But we need to\r\nmove beyond reaffirmation; reaffirmation is not\r\nenough. We need much more action, and yes, more\r\nresources. More must be done to remove the obstacles\r\nfaced by the poor and the marginalized in their access\r\nto basic health and reproductive health services. To do\r\nthis, we must work to increase the supply of those\r\nservices, including commodities, and ensure that men,\r\nwomen and young people are aware of them and\r\ndemand them.\r\nWe need to strengthen capacity in the health\r\nsector. This means more doctors, more nurses and more\r\nsupport to countries to help them recruit, train and\r\nretain enough health workers. Reproductive health and\r\nreproductive rights will remain an illusion for many\r\nwithout functioning health systems. More money is\r\nneeded, and the international community needs to do\r\nmore. It is not realistic to expect poor countries that\r\nhave $2 per capita a year to invest in healthcare to\r\nmake significant headway.\r\nThat is why the United Kingdom has committed\r\nto reaching the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of\r\nannual gross national income being spent on\r\ndevelopment assistance and has set a deadline of 2013\r\nto reach it. Our commitment is demonstrated also\r\nthrough our support of the Economic Commission for\r\nAfrica, through the additional £1.5 billion — that is,\r\n$2.7 billion — that we have made available to tackle\r\nHIV/AIDS over the next three years, and most recently\r\nthrough the Prime Minister’s support for the World\r\nLeaders Statement in Support of ICPD.\r\n33\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nThe United Kingdom was one of the first\r\ncountries to sign the ICPD World Leaders Statement at\r\nhead of State or Government level. My Prime Minister,\r\nTony Blair, has asked me to say how important he\r\nthinks the ICPD Programme of Action is as a\r\nfoundation for tackling poverty and for promoting\r\nwomen’s reproductive rights. We will not reduce\r\npoverty unless women have control over their own\r\nreproductive health. So, I am pleased also to announce\r\nthat the United Kingdom is making a new contribution\r\nof £10 million — that is, $18 million — to help meet\r\nthe gap in funding for reproductive health\r\ncommodities.\r\nLooking ahead, next year’s United Nations event\r\nto mark the Millennium Summit will provide an\r\nunprecedented opportunity to renew and to intensify\r\nthe international community’s commitment to tackling\r\npoverty and inequity in the following 10 years. In our\r\nview, it is vital that this opportunity should be seized,\r\nand in our view, the Millennium Development Goals\r\ncannot be attained without progress also in achieving\r\nthe Cairo goal of reproductive health and reproductive\r\nrights for all.\r\nMs. Gallardo (El Salvador) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of El\r\nSalvador, may I say how pleased we are at the\r\nconvening of these very important meetings of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to commemorate the tenth\r\nanniversary of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD), held in Cairo in\r\n1994.\r\nMy delegation supports the views expressed on\r\nthis subject by the delegation of Qatar on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nThe Government of El Salvador considers this a\r\ngood opportunity to reaffirm the Cairo Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action, particularly because we believe\r\nthat the main objectives of the Conference remain\r\nvalid: incorporating population issues in all relevant\r\nnational development programmes and involving local\r\ngovernmental entities, non-governmental organizations\r\n(NGOs), the private sector and local communities in all\r\nactivities relating to the subject of population.\r\nThe goal, it should be recalled, was to increase\r\nthe options available to individuals in dealing with\r\npopulation questions, thus contributing to broad social\r\nprogress, promoting equality between men and women\r\nand meeting people’s reproductive health needs — in\r\nother words, the needs of everyone of reproductive age.\r\nPeople’s everyday activities are affected by\r\npopulation changes. The use of natural resources,\r\nenvironmental conditions and economic and social\r\ndevelopment, population growth, migration and\r\nurbanization are closely related to the phenomenon of\r\npoverty, as we all know. Putting an end to wasteful\r\nconsumption and production patterns, ensuring the\r\nsustainable use of natural resources, reversing the\r\ndeterioration of the environment and redressing social\r\ninequalities between men and women are shared\r\nproblems that affect us all.\r\nWidespread poverty remains the main challenge\r\nto our attaining the goal of development. The\r\npersistence of economic inequality between countries\r\nand the economic and social inequality of women\r\nwithin countries obstruct efforts to improve the\r\nstandards of living of millions of persons, especially\r\nwomen.\r\nAs we know, poverty goes hand in hand with\r\nilliteracy and limited access to health and family\r\nplanning services. Poor women often have little\r\npossibility of gaining access to these services, and they\r\nare doomed to live in a vicious cycle of poverty,\r\nilliteracy, unemployment, social marginalization and\r\ngender-related violence. All of those factors contribute\r\nto high rates of fertility, disease and mortality and to\r\nlow economic productivity in our countries. Moreover,\r\npoverty is related to the unsustainable use of water and\r\nland resources and causes a grave deterioration of the\r\nenvironment.\r\nSustainable development depends on our\r\nalleviating poverty, and this, in turn, requires sustained\r\neconomic growth. Since the poorest segments of the\r\npopulation include a disproportionate number of\r\nwomen, the elimination of social and economic\r\ndiscrimination against women is a prerequisite for the\r\nreduction of poverty in our countries, the promotion of\r\neconomic growth and the attainment of rational\r\npopulation policies.\r\nBecause of El Salvador’s own history, we focus\r\non the subject of migration, which has acquired great\r\nimportance in our national policy, as it has on the\r\ninternational agenda. We believe that the subject of\r\nmigration should be placed in a broad context, going\r\nbeyond the implementation of public policies to control\r\nthe legal entry of persons into a destination country.\r\n34\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nTo deal with this, a phenomenon that\r\ncharacterizes our region, the countries of Central\r\nAmerica and of North America have, in recent years,\r\nheld periodic consultations in the framework of the\r\nRegional Conference on Migration: the Puebla process.\r\nThe high levels of migration flows, caused in part by\r\nmajor changes in the international system — in\r\nparticular the expansion of globalization, the creation\r\nand use of new communications technologies, the\r\nbehaviour of the international economy and open\r\nmarkets — make it necessary that the subject of\r\nmigration be approached from a broad and\r\ncomprehensive perspective, given its profound\r\npolitical, economic and social repercussions in each of\r\nour countries. That is why the Government of El\r\nSalvador supports the high-level dialogue on migration\r\nproposed for 2006. At the same time, we invite all\r\ndelegations to approach that event with an open mind\r\nand a flexible spirit so that we may consider the\r\nelements that are potentially controversial from an\r\ninnovative standpoint, for the benefit of the millions of\r\nmigrants of the world.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the\r\ncommitment and political will of the Government of El\r\nSalvador to make the human person the centre and the\r\nsubject of development. In that context, we reaffirm\r\nthe validity and timeliness of the Cairo Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action and all of the principles,\r\nobjectives and actions aimed at contributing to\r\nprogress in the attainment of development goals, in\r\nparticular those set forth in the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nMrs. Taylor Roberts (Jamaica): First, let me say\r\nthat my delegation fully associates itself with the\r\nstatements made by the delegation of Qatar on behalf\r\nof the Group of 77 and China and by Barbados on\r\nbehalf of member States of the Caribbean Community.\r\nI also wish to thank the Deputy Secretary-General\r\nfor her statement this morning, as well as the Executive\r\nDirector of the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA) for her remarks made on this item.\r\nTen years ago, at the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development held in Cairo, Jamaica\r\ngave its full support to the principles and goals that\r\nwere established in the Programme of Action adopted\r\nby the Conference, including the reduction in infant,\r\nchild and maternal mortality and the provision of\r\nuniversal access to education, reproductive health care\r\nand family planning services. Today, Jamaica reaffirms\r\nits commitment to those principles and goals.\r\nWe have noted that a number of forums have\r\nbeen held this year at the international, regional and\r\nnational levels in commemoration of the tenth\r\nanniversary of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD), and in all cases,\r\none message was clear: the ICPD Programme of Action\r\ncontinues to be relevant.\r\nIssues of population and development were\r\nrecognized at Cairo as central to the existence of any\r\nsociety. Consequently, our response to those issues will\r\nbe a determining factor in the quality of life of our\r\npeople and the sustainability of our economies.\r\nThe UNFPA report, State of World Population\r\n2004, indicates that many developing countries have\r\nmade great strides in putting the ICPD\r\nrecommendations into action. However, it also points\r\nto the fact that inadequate resources are one of the\r\nmain obstacles to meeting challenges such as the\r\nspread of HIV/AIDS, unmet needs for family planning\r\nand high maternal mortality rates in the least developed\r\ncountries.\r\nIn Jamaica, we have sought to translate the\r\ncommitments made at Cairo into national policies and\r\nprogrammes. We also recognize that the achievement\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals is closely linked\r\nto the implementation of the ICPD Programme of\r\nAction.\r\nIn honouring our commitments, we have\r\nstrengthened existing partnerships with civil society,\r\nnon-governmental organizations and the private sector\r\nin the areas of legislative reform, policy formulation\r\nand programme implementation. Those actions were\r\naccomplished with the valuable assistance provided by\r\nUNFPA through its national and regional\r\nrepresentatives. Partnership with UNFPA has played a\r\nsignificant role in achievements made by Jamaica so\r\nfar in such areas as: the formulation of a plan of action\r\non population and development, consistent with what\r\nwas agreed in Cairo; the development and\r\nimplementation of a national poverty eradication\r\npolicy and programme of action; and national policies\r\non youth and senior citizens.\r\nAt this 10-year midpoint for the ICPD\r\nProgramme of Action, Member States need to focus on\r\nwhat further actions we can take to achieve the goals to\r\n35\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nwhich we committed ourselves. For Jamaica’s part, we\r\nhave seen the benefits of strengthened intersectoral\r\npolicy coordination and political support, including\r\nbipartisan consensus on certain budgetary allocation\r\nissues. It is recognized, however, that significant\r\nresources will be required over the next 10 years to\r\neffectively translate those plans and programmes into\r\nreality.\r\nWe take this opportunity to congratulate this\r\nyear’s recipients of the United Nations Population\r\nAward for their tremendous efforts in helping to\r\nimprove the health and quality of life of people around\r\nthe world.\r\nFinally, we also commend the work done by\r\nUNFPA for its effectiveness in facilitating the\r\nelaboration and implementation of population policies\r\nand strategies, especially in developing countries. Now,\r\nUNFPA deserves even more support from the donor\r\ncommunity to help provide the resources needed to\r\nmeet the immense challenges that we have to\r\novercome.\r\nMr. Gansukh (Mongolia): While associating\r\nitself with the statement made earlier by the\r\nrepresentative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China, my delegation wishes to make a few\r\nadditional remarks.\r\nAt the outset, it should be noted that the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD) was not an isolated event: its\r\nProgramme of Action was built on the considerable\r\ninternational consensus that had been developed since\r\nthe World Population Conference at Bucharest in 1974\r\nand the International Conference on Population, 1984,\r\nat Mexico City. The ICPD outcomes made significant\r\ncontributions to the major conferences that followed it.\r\nThe Cairo consensus paved the way for the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, widely recognized as a blueprint\r\nfor building better lives for people everywhere in the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe State of World Population 2004 report of\r\nUNFPA clearly indicates that significant achievements\r\nhave been made since Cairo in integrating population-\r\nrelated issues into development policies. Nevertheless,\r\nmuch remains to be done. Many countries are still in\r\ncritical need of sufficient human and other resources\r\nand sorely need to strengthen their institutional\r\ncapacities, obtain a wider exchange of information and\r\ntechnology and forge genuine partnerships. It is vitally\r\nimportant to invest in the education, health and human\r\nrights of women and young people to ensure a more\r\nequitable and sustainable world. Today’s challenges\r\ncall on all Governments and the international\r\ncommunity to mobilize their political will and\r\nresources to make the vision of Cairo a reality.\r\nThe Government of Mongolia highly values the\r\nspirit, principles and objectives of the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action and has attached high priority to\r\nits implementation. An effective population policy is of\r\nparticular importance for Mongolia, a country that has\r\na population of 2.7 million scattered over a vast\r\nterritory of more than 1.5 million square kilometres.\r\nOver the past decade, an intensive process of policy\r\nformulation has taken place to integrate population\r\nconcerns into all aspects of economic and social\r\nactivities. This has resulted in the adoption by the\r\nParliament of Mongolia of the State Policy on family\r\ndevelopment in 2003 and the State Policy on\r\npopulation development in 2004.\r\nMongolia’s commitment to the principles and\r\nobjectives of the Cairo Programme of Action is further\r\nembodied in a number of national action plans,\r\nincluding the National Programmes on household\r\nlivelihood capacity support, reproductive health,\r\ndevelopment and protection of children and the\r\nNational Programme on gender equality.\r\nI am pleased to announce that in implementing\r\nour population policy we have successfully cooperated\r\nwith the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)\r\nthrough its Office in Mongolia. The first countrywide\r\nprogramme began in 1992 and the third countrywide\r\nprogramme was initiated in 2002. Thus, we\r\nsuccessfully conducted, in cooperation with UNFPA, a\r\nreproductive health survey in 1998 and the population\r\nand housing census in 2000, both meeting international\r\nstandards. The decade of cooperation between UNFPA\r\nand Mongolia has laid a solid foundation for future\r\ncollaboration.\r\nJust a week ago, on 8 October 2004, in\r\ncooperation with the United Nations country team led\r\nby the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) Office in Mongolia, the first National Report\r\non the status of implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) was officially launched in\r\nUlaanbaatar with the participation of the President and\r\nPrime Minister of Mongolia. The report marks an\r\nimportant milestone in the ongoing efforts to assess the\r\n36\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nachievements, challenges and opportunities for\r\ndevelopment that benefit all citizens of the country,\r\nincluding the integrated implementation of the\r\nprinciples and objectives of the Cairo Programme of\r\nAction.\r\nOn this day that marks the mid-point of the 20-\r\nyear Cairo Programme of Action, it is gratifying to\r\nnote that world leaders are reiterating their\r\ncommitment to the principles and objectives agreed to\r\nin Cairo. I am pleased to inform you that His\r\nExcellency Mr. Bagabandi, President of Mongolia, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Elbegdorj, Prime Minister of Mongolia,\r\nand His Excellency Mr. Ochirbat, former President of\r\nMongolia, signed the World Leaders Statement last\r\nweek. Let us also reaffirm the centrality of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD) agenda to our wider efforts to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nMr. Danesh-Yazdi (Islamic Republic of Iran):\r\nReproductive health, child labour, migration,\r\nunemployment, literacy, education and mortality rates\r\nare all indicative of the level of development in any\r\nsociety. Provision of a long, healthy and dignified life\r\nfor the whole population should be the most basic aim\r\nof every plan for socio-economic development. In fact,\r\na long, dignified and healthy life is one of the oldest\r\nand purest desires of mankind.\r\nThe Programme of Action that was adopted 10\r\nyears ago at the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD) in Cairo is the\r\nactual embodiment of that desire. The Programme was\r\ndesigned, not only to address comprehensively a full\r\nrange of population issues by presenting the necessary\r\nmeans of implementation, but also to help social justice\r\nprevail in the less fortunate parts of the global\r\ncommunity through international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWith those basic and fundamental aspirations in\r\nmind we can only be proud to commemorate the tenth\r\nanniversary of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development, which has embarked on\r\nthe path towards fulfilment of our noble goals in the\r\nrealm of social and economic justice. Although by\r\nencountering so many challenges and opportunities, the\r\nimplementation of the ICPD Programme of Action has\r\nproved to be a complex and painstaking task in some\r\ncritical areas, we now have a wealth of experience and\r\nknowledge that should be used to foster stronger\r\nprogress towards accomplishing the ICPD objectives\r\nand achieving internationally agreed development\r\ngoals.\r\nThe third Five-Year Development Plan of Iran is\r\naimed at providing various developmental opportunities\r\nfor all citizens, balanced geographical distribution of\r\nthe population, better health and welfare for all people,\r\nprotection of the environment, and promotion of the\r\nstatus of women as well as their participation in social,\r\neconomic and political activities.\r\nIn addition, recognition by the Government of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, of the negative impact of\r\nrapid population growth, along with concerted\r\nadvocacy efforts and the establishment of one of the\r\nbest primary health systems in the region, has reduced\r\nfertility rates by more than half in the last decade.\r\nMoreover, we have exceeded the targets laid out at the\r\n1994 International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment.\r\nThe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)\r\nhas been closely involved in the development of Iran’s\r\nfamily planning programme through enhancement of\r\nlocal and national ownership of the ICPD Programme\r\nof Action. UNFPA assistance complemented\r\nGovernment plans and programmes to promote\r\nreproductive health, and strengthened current\r\npopulation and reproductive health and family planning\r\nprogrammes. The funding available from UNFPA has\r\nbeen channelled towards testing innovative approaches\r\nas well as assisting in the systematic assessment of a\r\nlimited number of reproductive health concerns that are\r\nof increasing importance to the population of Iran.\r\nLet me bring my statement to a close by renewing\r\nmy country’s commitment to the Programme of Action,\r\nas well as expressing our profound gratitude to UNFPA\r\nfor its earnest efforts to achieve the goals and\r\nobjectives of the ICPD Programme of Action. As the\r\nlead agency, UNFPA plays a crucial role in helping to\r\nimplement national policies in the area of sexual and\r\nreproductive health and in achieving the development\r\ngoals and targets set out in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nIn order to successfully carry out its mandates in\r\nthe context of the Programme of Action of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment and the subsequent processes, UNFPA\r\nshould receive sufficient political and financial\r\nsupport. To prevent worsening of the population and\r\nreproductive health situation in many developing\r\n37\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\ncountries, we call on the international community to\r\nmeet the time-bound targets on resource mobilization\r\nfor implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action.\r\nAttaining the target of $18.5 billion by 2005 is a\r\nchallenge that the international community should rise\r\nup to meet.\r\nNana Effah-Apenteng (Ghana): The International\r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD)\r\nheld in Cairo in 1994 was a landmark event in the\r\nannals of population and development and the rights of\r\nwomen, because it marked a turning point in the way\r\npeople looked at population issues.\r\nThe adoption of the Programme of Action,\r\nembodying a comprehensive population, reproductive\r\nhealth and development agenda spanning a period of\r\n20 years, kindled hopes for the dawn of a new era of\r\ncommitment and willingness on the part of\r\nGovernments, the international community, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and other concerned\r\nconstituencies to integrate population concerns into all\r\naspects of economic and social activity with a view to\r\nenhancing the quality of life for all and for posterity.\r\nThose aspirations were predicated on the expectation\r\nthat the recommendations of the Conference would be\r\ntranslated into action, through practical policies and\r\nactive resource mobilization, because without those\r\ncomponents, the population, reproductive health,\r\ngender and other goals could not be met.\r\nWe stand on the threshold of the comprehensive\r\nreview, scheduled for the sixtieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, of the progress made in the\r\nfulfilment of all the commitments contained in the\r\nUnited Nations Millennium Declaration and in the\r\nglobal partnership required for their achievement. In\r\nthis context, it is pertinent to stress that population and\r\nreproductive health issues are central to development\r\nand the achievement of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, particularly the eradication of hunger and\r\npoverty. Those issues ought to be squarely addressed at\r\nthe national as well as the international level.\r\nIn this connection, we in Ghana took a cue from\r\nthe ICPD Programme of Action and revised our 1969\r\nNational Population Policy in 1994 to reflect the Cairo\r\nagenda to which our Government is firmly committed.\r\nWithin this framework, new policies have been\r\nformulated in the areas of ageing, disability, gender,\r\nyouth, adolescent reproductive health, and HIV/AIDS\r\nand sexually transmitted infections to guide\r\nimplementation of the agenda. Besides our National\r\nReproductive Health Policy, standards and protocols\r\nare also undergoing revision to take into account\r\nemerging concerns. All these are fully consistent with\r\nthe Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy, the blueprint\r\nfor the country’s socio-economic development.\r\nThese policies are being translated into action\r\nthrough the implementation of programme activities,\r\nwhich include the adolescent reproductive health\r\nproject under the African Youth Alliance, sponsored by\r\nthe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The project\r\nempowers adolescents between the ages of 10 and 24\r\nyears with relevant information about their own\r\nsexuality. Other strategies include behaviour change\r\ncommunication, employable skills development and\r\nyouth-friendly services. Strong partnerships have been\r\nforged in this area with non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs), youth organizations,\r\ncommunity-based and faith-based organizations.\r\nWith regard to HIV/AIDS and its acknowledged\r\nprevalence in parts of the country, prevention\r\nprogrammes have been intensified to reduce the spread\r\nof the epidemic. General awareness of HIV/AIDS is\r\nnear universal, but behaviour change is still very slow.\r\nConsequently, through a national and multisectoral\r\nresponse to the epidemic, the capacity to implement\r\nand monitor HIV/AIDS programmes of district\r\nadministrations, NGOs, traditional institutions,\r\nschools, the media, and others, has been strengthened.\r\nThe focus has been on population groups such as\r\nyouth, long distance drivers and commercial sex\r\nworkers, and on areas such as stigmatization,\r\ndiscrimination, mother-to-child transmission, care and\r\nsupport for people living with HIV/AIDS, and orphans,\r\nas well as voluntary counselling and testing, and lately,\r\non treatment.\r\nWithin the context of health sector reform and to\r\nimprove access to health care, particularly in poor and\r\ndifficult-to-reach areas, trained community volunteers\r\nand community health nurses are working at the\r\ncommunity level to provide primary health care,\r\nincluding reproductive health and family planning\r\nservices. The quality of services has improved through\r\nthe enhancement of the technical skills of health\r\nworkers, the construction and rehabilitation of facilities\r\nand the provision of necessary equipment. A National\r\nHealth Insurance Scheme, aimed at coping with the\r\nproblem of providing affordable health care for all\r\nGhanaians, was formally launched by the President of\r\n38\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nGhana on 18 March 2004. Our national efforts,\r\nhowever, are being hampered by the increasingly\r\nalarming rate at which the country is losing trained and\r\nqualified health personnel to some developed\r\ncountries.\r\nIn view of the continued high levels of maternal\r\nfertility and mortality, particularly in the rural areas,\r\nthe safe motherhood and family planning — life\r\nchoices — programmes have been relaunched, and\r\nmaternal health and death reporting has been\r\nintensified since 2002 to help determine the full extent\r\nof the incidence of maternal deaths.\r\nThe cumulative effect of these initiatives and\r\nothers, such as the intensified campaign in favour of\r\neducation for girls, is that there has been an\r\nappreciable decline in the total fertility rate, a decline\r\nin the infant mortality rate and an increase in the\r\nmedian age of mothers giving birth for the first time.\r\nThese limited gains ought to be viewed alongside\r\nthe persistent challenge relating to the mobilization of\r\nadequate financial resources to fully implement the\r\nICPD Programme of Action. In this regard, it should be\r\npointed out that the Government’s allocation of\r\nresources to population activities over the decade has\r\nseen a modest increase. Various Regional and district\r\nadministrations have also started allocating resources\r\nto such activities in their annual budgets to ensure\r\nsustainability. In addition, the Government continues to\r\nmobilize external resources to complement its own\r\nefforts, and in this connection we are deeply grateful\r\nfor the support of all our development partners.\r\nI began my statement by stressing the primordial\r\nimportance of financial resource mobilization for the\r\nsuccess of the Programme of Action, and would like to\r\nconclude on that note. Though it is generally agreed\r\nthat the decade following the adoption of the\r\nProgramme of Action has been one of substantial\r\nsuccess, the fact of the matter is that a lot still remains\r\nto be done, because most developing countries are\r\nnowhere near the targets that were set at the Cairo\r\nconference. The Conference goal of mobilizing $17\r\nbillion by the year 2000 was not met. Although the\r\nresources directed to the implementation of the ICPD\r\nProgramme of Action have increased since 1994, they\r\nare not at the level required to implement the Cairo\r\nobjectives.\r\nAs we commemorate the tenth anniversary of the\r\nICPD, individual Governments, as well as the\r\ninternational community as a whole, must resolve to\r\nstrengthen the political will and commitment to fulfil\r\nthe financial targets of the ICPD as an integral part of\r\nthe collective effort to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, and to mobilize new and\r\nadditional resources in a sustained manner to fully\r\nimplement the Programme of Action of the ICPD. In\r\nthat regard, we also wish to appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to increase its funding to the United\r\nNations Population Fund to support the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nMrs. Bauzán de Senes (Uruguay) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): On the occasion of this commemoration, the\r\nGovernment of Uruguay reaffirms its commitment to\r\nthe principles, objectives and actions contained in the\r\nProgramme of Action of the International Conference\r\non Population and Development (ICPD) held in Cairo,\r\nas well as key measures to continue their\r\nimplementation. That commitment is evidenced in the\r\nsigning by the President of Uruguay of the Declaration\r\nof Principles by world leaders in support of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment. The documents that emerged from the\r\nICPD and ICPD+5 constitute the conceptual and\r\nethical frame of reference through which our country is\r\ndeveloping and implementing public policy in sexual\r\nand reproductive health.\r\nFor the past decade, Uruguay has had a complex\r\npopulation profile that requires the implementation of\r\ncomprehensive action for the sustainable development\r\nand quality of life of the population. Growing and\r\nworsening poverty, which particularly affects children,\r\nadolescents and women, as well as economic\r\nmigration, which causes a loss of qualified and young\r\nhuman resources, are factors that have worsened\r\nbecause of the very grave economic crisis suffered by\r\nmy country in recent years, especially in 2002.\r\nTogether with the ageing population, we are presented\r\nwith the challenge of implementing comprehensive\r\ndevelopment policies.\r\nUruguay has made significant progress in the\r\ndevelopment of actions to protect and promote, without\r\ndiscrimination, the sexual and reproductive rights of\r\npeople. In that work, we would like to underscore the\r\njoint efforts of governmental sectors, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and international\r\ncooperation provided by the agencies, funds and\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations, in particular the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). I would\r\n39\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nlike to convey my Government’s appreciation to\r\nUNFPA Executive Director, Ms. Thoraya Obaid, and to\r\nthe Director of its Latin America and Caribbean\r\nDivision, Ms. Marisela Padron, for the invaluable\r\nassistance that has been provided.\r\nAmong the most striking advances we can cite is\r\nthe incorporation into public health services of free\r\nfamily planning services and the implementation of a\r\ncomprehensive model of sexual and reproductive\r\nhealth in public health services. These actions are\r\naimed at the prevention and treatment of sexually\r\ntransmitted diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, and the\r\nestablishment of separate health-care services for the\r\nsexual and reproductive health of adolescents, thus\r\npromoting informed and responsible decisions. In that\r\ncontext, the great challenge remaining is for men of all\r\nages to exercise their sexual and reproductive rights\r\nresponsibly.\r\nImportant progress has also been made in the area\r\nof legislation. Laws on domestic and sexual violence,\r\nthe definition of the crime of domestic violence and\r\nchildbirth assistance, and the workers’ protection law\r\nconcerning gynaecologist screening are among the\r\nmost important.\r\nMr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nAt the regional level, Uruguay recently approved\r\nthe Santiago Declaration and the San Juan and Mexico\r\nconsensus, which reflect the common position of Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean on the various issues of the\r\nCairo agenda and the Beijing Platform for Action and\r\nwhich create important political impetus for meeting\r\nthe challenges that still lie ahead.\r\nWe believe that in order to sustain the\r\nachievements made and to confront the challenges\r\nremaining, it is inevitably necessary to fulfil the\r\ncommitments made at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels. In that regard, while financial\r\nresources have increased slowly in recent years, annual\r\ncontributions to the regular resources of the United\r\nNations Population Fund have not matched the\r\ncontributions received immediately following the\r\nConference in 1994. With a 10-year perspective, we\r\nnote that it was not possible to meet the Conference’s\r\nobjective of mobilizing $17 billion by the year 2000. If\r\nthat trend is not reversed and if an attempt is not made\r\nto meet the objective of $18.5 billion set for 2005, we\r\nwill not achieve the Conference’s objectives, nor will\r\nwe attain the Millennium Development Goals. The\r\npledges made today by a number of developed\r\ncountries restore our hope.\r\nAssistance from donors is fundamental for\r\nachieving the objectives of the Conference. It is also\r\nessential that countries incorporate into their\r\ndevelopment policies the issues of population and\r\npoverty, reproductive rights and health, gender equity\r\nand equality and the empowerment of women.\r\nWe must recapture the momentum of Cairo. We\r\nmust meet the challenge and come to the General\r\nAssembly’s high-level event next year with the\r\nsatisfaction of a duty fulfilled.\r\nMr. Mmualefe (Botswana): I have the pleasure to\r\nmake this statement on behalf of the Permanent\r\nRepresentative, who unfortunately is not able to\r\npresent this statement in person.\r\nTen years ago, the international community\r\nconvened at the great city of Cairo and adopted a\r\nmilestone Programme of Action that has since become\r\nthe blueprint for addressing the ever-challenging issues\r\nof population and development. In the Programme of\r\nAction, we set ourselves objectives, including\r\nsustained economic growth, universal education,\r\ngender equity and equality, reduction of infant, child\r\nand maternal mortality and universal access to\r\nreproductive health services, including family planning\r\nand sexual health.\r\nWhile not the first conference of its kind, the\r\n1994 Cairo International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD) is significant in that it was held\r\non the threshold of the process of globalization, and\r\nthus it constituted one of our collective responses to\r\nthe challenges and opportunities presented by that new\r\nphenomenon. Together, we recognized the importance\r\nof the global population and, most fundamentally, the\r\nvital importance of population and development as the\r\nindispensable twin pillars of sustainable development\r\nin all our countries and societies. Thus, in the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action, we made an abiding\r\ncommitment to make population and development an\r\nintegral part of our national economic and social\r\ndevelopment strategies.\r\nAs we gather here today to commemorate the\r\ntenth anniversary of the Cairo International\r\nConference, we must answer critical questions on the\r\nimplementation of the ICPD Programme of Action\r\n40\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nover the last 10 years. Have we fulfilled our\r\ncommitments? If so, today we have cause to celebrate\r\n10 years of progress. If not, and I am afraid that is the\r\ncase, the 10-year commemoration offers us the\r\nopportunity and the challenge to identifying the\r\nconstraints that have led to our failure and the new\r\nstrategies we intend to deploy in order to meet our\r\ncommitments.\r\nIn that regard, I share the disappointment\r\nexpressed by many who spoke before me. Developing\r\ncountries continue to face immense challenges and\r\nseemingly insurmountable constraints in implementing\r\nthe commitments of the Programme of Action. It is\r\ndisturbing that while developed countries have made\r\ntremendous progress in implementing the Programme\r\nof Action, the developing countries are still painfully\r\nfar behind. Africa, in particular, is not only lagging;\r\naccording to the data of most socio-economic\r\nindicators, the situation is actually worsening. Africa is\r\nthe continent most afflicted by the scourge of HIV.\r\nFifty per cent of the population lives in poverty.\r\nMaternal, infant and child mortality rates are also on\r\nthe rise. And correspondingly, life expectancy at birth\r\nis declining dramatically. Sadly, to many in Africa and\r\nthe developing world, the Programme of Action is yet\r\nto be realized.\r\nIf there is anything that the international\r\ncommunity must understand and appreciate, it is that\r\nthe asymmetry in resource allocation between the\r\ndeveloped and the developing countries will always\r\nresult in skewed development. In that regard,\r\ninadequate resources and lack of capacity, if not\r\neffectively addressed, will continue to undermine our\r\nability to fully implement the Cairo Programme of\r\nAction and to realize the many other international\r\ndevelopment benchmarks that we have set ourselves to\r\nachieve the goals of sustainable development.\r\nIn the last 10 years, Botswana has taken concrete\r\nsteps to implement the 1994 Programme of Action. In\r\nthat regard, the formulation and subsequent\r\nimplementation of our National Population Policy of\r\n1997 constitutes one of our major achievements since\r\nthe adoption of Programme of Action. The Policy\r\naddresses the issues of reproductive health, social\r\ndevelopment, gender, data collection and research,\r\nresource development and HIV/AIDS.\r\nIn 1996 Botswana adopted its national policy on\r\nwomen in development, which is aimed at promoting\r\ngender equality and the empowerment of women. At\r\nthe regional level, Botswana subscribed to the\r\nSouthern African Development Community’s\r\nDeclaration on Gender and Development, and\r\nsubsequently several national laws have been amended\r\nwith the aim of giving greater protection to the rights\r\nof women.\r\nIn recognition of the importance of youth to\r\nnational development, in 1996 Botswana adopted its\r\nNational Youth Policy, which addresses the critical\r\nareas of unemployment, poverty, lack of opportunities,\r\nHIV/AIDS, drug abuse and crime.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to pose a\r\nmajor threat to our development and survival as a\r\nnation. Botswana has the misfortune of being among\r\nthe most affected countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with\r\na high prevalence rate, especially among women\r\nbetween 15 and 49 years of age. Faced with that\r\npandemic, Botswana has developed and implemented\r\nan aggressive programme to combat the scourge, which\r\nfocuses on education, prevention, treatment and care.\r\nWith respect to reproductive health, Botswana\r\nhas adopted and implemented several policies and\r\nstrategies in line with the Dakar/Ngor Declaration and\r\nthe ICPD Programme of Action. They include the 2002\r\nframework for implementation of adolescent sexual\r\nand reproductive health strategies, the 2002 national\r\nsexual and reproductive health programme, and the\r\npolicy guidelines and service standards for sexual and\r\nreproductive health.\r\nIn spite of those achievements, Botswana faces\r\nimmense challenges, arising mainly from the\r\ndebilitating HIV/AIDS scourge. That pandemic has\r\nbecome the major impediment to the effective\r\nimplementation of our national population policy. It\r\nhas reversed the gains that Botswana had made in basic\r\nsocio-economic indicators over the years. For example,\r\nlife expectancy was reduced from 65.3 years in 1991 to\r\n55.7 years in 2001. Poverty also remains a pressing\r\nchallenge that deserves our continued attention. As of\r\n2001, an estimated 36.6 per cent of Botswana’s\r\npopulation was considered to be living in poverty.\r\nIn conclusion, we believe that the 1994\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment was a momentous event, and its\r\nProgramme of Action is a visionary programme whose\r\nimplementation must remain a matter of priority.\r\n41\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nMs. Nieto (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): I am\r\nspeaking on behalf of the Permanent Representative of\r\nEcuador, who unfortunately was unable to be present.\r\nFirst, I wish to endorse the statement by the\r\nrepresentative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nOn the occasion of the commemoration of the\r\ntenth anniversary of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development, held in Cairo, Ecuador\r\nreaffirms its commitment to implementation of the\r\nagreed Programme of Action and its goals and the\r\nrecommendations of the five-year review of the\r\nConference. That commitment is linked to Ecuador’s\r\nefforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nAssessments of the results achieved in Ecuador\r\nover the last decade are positive. Nonetheless, much\r\nremains to be done. In that connection, the sectors in\r\nwhich Ecuador has made progress are those of\r\npopulation and development, the empowerment of\r\nwomen, gender equality and reproductive rights and\r\nhealth. A national plan of action on population and a\r\ncode on children and adolescents have been adopted.\r\nOutstanding results achieved include an increase in life\r\nexpectancy at birth, an increase in the average number\r\nof years of education of those 24 years and older, and a\r\nreduction of the infant mortality rate, the overall\r\nfertility rate and the illiteracy rate among the general\r\npopulation.\r\nEcuador is thankful for all assistance provided by\r\nthe United Nations system, in particular by the United\r\nNations Population Fund and its office in my country.\r\nIn 2000 Ecuador suffered a profound economic\r\ncrisis, which led to a social crisis. The levels of\r\npoverty and extreme poverty worsened, as did\r\nindicators for unemployment and underemployment.\r\nOne of the obvious consequences of the crisis was the\r\nsustained and growing number of Ecuadorian\r\nemigrants that decided to leave the country in search of\r\na more encouraging future. We will follow all efforts to\r\nresolve the complex problem of migration.\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean is the region of\r\nthe world with the most disturbing levels of inequality,\r\nand Ecuador is no exception. This problem must be\r\ntackled in order to attain the Millennium Development\r\nGoals.\r\nLikewise, we are concerned that countries are\r\noften pressured to fulfil their commitments in paying\r\ntheir foreign debt and must postpone decisions for the\r\ndevelopment of their population. In order to move\r\ntowards development and the attainment of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, Ecuador calls for\r\nconsideration of the burden involved in paying debt\r\nand debt servicing.\r\nAnother fundamental point is the need for\r\nadequate financing. The international community must\r\nbe aware that it is essential to support our countries in\r\nthis regard. Compliance with the Monterrey Consensus\r\nis one way to do that.\r\nEcuador reaffirms that it will continue to make all\r\nnecessary efforts in order to make progress in all\r\ninternational commitments and will achieve positive\r\nresults at the national level. I wish to congratulate\r\nMs. Thoraya Obaid, Executive Director of the United\r\nNations Population Fund, and Ms. Marisela Padrón,\r\nDirector of the Fund’s Latin American and Caribbean\r\nDivision, for their leadership and dedication in making\r\nprogress on all the aforementioned objectives.\r\nEcuador is convinced that it will continue to have\r\nthe support of bodies such as the Fund, as we have\r\nsaid, in order to make progress on all objectives.\r\nMr. Mayoral (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\ncommemoration of the tenth anniversary of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment provides us with an opportunity to assess\r\nthe efforts that have been carried out in this area and to\r\nreaffirm the commitments that we undertook in Cairo.\r\nThe grave crisis that affected my country, the\r\nArgentine Republic, at the end of 2001 gave further\r\nimpetus to promoting active policies for the country’s\r\ndevelopment and economic growth, the creation of new\r\njobs and a better and more fair distribution of income,\r\nleading to the creation of opportunities through access\r\nto work, education, health and housing — in other\r\nwords, the promotion of social progress.\r\nSocial policy in Argentina is based on a network\r\nfocused on the Argentine individual and family. Its\r\naction incorporates the provinces, towns, civil society\r\norganizations and the private sector. That strategy of\r\nparticipation ensures a concrete response to needs and\r\nmakes it possible to create sustainable projects through\r\npartnerships of responsible management.\r\nIn Argentina there are three national plans: on\r\nfood security, social development and social economy,\r\nand the family. The priority of all three plans are men\r\n42\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nand women in vulnerable sectors, and the plans give\r\nspecial attention to disabled persons and indigenous\r\ncommunities.\r\nIt should be pointed out that the reform of the\r\nArgentine Constitution adopted in 1994 gave\r\nconstitutional priority to international human rights\r\ninstruments, including the American Declaration of the\r\nRights and Duties of Man, the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights, the American Convention on Human\r\nRights, the International Covenant on Civil and\r\nPolitical Rights, the International Covenant on\r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International\r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial\r\nDiscrimination, the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild and the Convention on the Elimination of All\r\nForms of Discrimination Against Women. In that\r\ncontext, the right to education is guaranteed to all\r\ncitizens, without any gender discrimination. 49 per cent\r\nof all primary school students in Argentina are female.\r\nAt the middle school level, 53.2 per cent are female.\r\nWith regard to sexual and reproductive health, in\r\nOctober 2002, a law on sexual health and responsible\r\nparenthood was adopted. In March 2003, a national\r\nprogramme for sexual health and responsible\r\nparenthood was drawn up. Both instruments are\r\nmilestones with regard to public policy and involve a\r\nclear commitment to the basic human rights of the\r\npopulation in general, and women in particular.\r\nThe 2002 law establishes that sexual and\r\nreproductive rights form an integral part of human\r\nrights and that the exercise of those rights is essential\r\nfor the full development of women and men.\r\nThe new public policies in the field of health also\r\nwork in synergy with other aspects of human\r\ndevelopment and constitute an important tool for\r\nreducing maternal mortality, for improving access to\r\nhealth care for women and children, and for working\r\ntowards the Millennium Development Goal of\r\npromoting gender equality and strengthening the\r\ncapacities of women.\r\nIn connection with the provisions of the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action on gender equality and the\r\nempowerment of women, we want to point out that,\r\ninter alia, we have enacted a law on birthing rights and\r\na law for protection against family violence; we have\r\nincorporated into Argentine law the provisions of the\r\nInter-American Convention on the Prevention,\r\nPunishment, and Eradication of Violence against\r\nWomen; we have enacted a law amending the penal\r\ncode on crimes against sexual integrity, an amendment\r\nto the benefits regime for families, and other very\r\nimportant norms.\r\nIn the area of immigration, in January 2004,\r\nArgentina enacted a new immigration law that,\r\nthroughout the country, will ensure equal access by\r\nimmigrants and their families to the same protections,\r\nassistance and rights as nationals enjoy, and in\r\nparticular regarding social services, public\r\ninfrastructure and so forth. Irregular status as a migrant\r\ndoes not prevent access by a migrant to the educational\r\nsystem or to health care.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goal to promote\r\ngender equality and to empower women, as well as the\r\nCairo Programme of Action and key actions adopted in\r\nBeijing and Cairo, have been taken into account in the\r\ndesign of the human rights dimensions of our foreign\r\npolicy. In that context, we reiterate the commitments\r\nundertaken at the thirtieth session of the Economic\r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean and\r\nwe reaffirm our will to continue policies to promote\r\ngender equity, education and health.\r\nArgentina associates itself with the action being\r\nundertaken by the Common Market of the South\r\n(MERCOSUR) and the associated countries, Bolivia,\r\nPeru and Chile. We share a common position on\r\npopulation and development based on the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nThe major conferences in the economic and\r\nsocial field, including the Cairo Conference, gave us\r\nthe hope that a united international effort would\r\nconfront the major challenges of development and\r\npoverty. It is our hope that this commemoration of the\r\n1994 International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment will serve to reaffirm the commitment of\r\nthe international community to continue to work to\r\nmeet the, as yet unresolved, challenges of poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment.\r\nMrs. Løj (Denmark): Denmark fully aligns itself\r\nwith the statement made by Netherlands on behalf of\r\nthe European Union.\r\nOn this important day of the commemoration of\r\nthe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD) that took place in Cairo in 1994,\r\nit is with great satisfaction that I acknowledge the\r\ncontinued support for and commitment to the ICPD\r\n43\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nProgramme of Action that has been expressed time and\r\ntime again throughout the day and evening. The\r\nimplementation of the ICPD Programme of Action is a\r\nhigh priority for my Government. It is also an agenda\r\nthat I am personally strongly committed to, as a woman\r\nand a representative of my Government at the Cairo\r\nConference.\r\nThe tenth anniversary of ICPD this year has,\r\namong other things, been used to take stock and\r\ndetermine the status of the results achieved so far.\r\nSince the adoption of the ICPD Programme of Action\r\nin 1994, important achievements have been made in\r\nimproving reproductive health in many countries.\r\nHowever, other countries have witnessed no\r\nprogress — or even setbacks. The numbers and\r\nstatistics speak for themselves.\r\nWe have come far, but not nearly far enough.\r\nSpecial focus is needed on gender issues and\r\nadolescents, as we cannot afford to lose that enormous\r\nhuman potential for development. And special focus is\r\nneeded on HIV/AIDS, because of its debilitating\r\nimpact on the eradication of poverty.\r\nWe must continue to seek ways and means to\r\nmove the Cairo Programme of Action forward.\r\nPolitical leadership is needed. It will require continued\r\nand increased willingness to address openly some of\r\nthe sensitive issues and to make this a political priority.\r\nThat includes allocating increased financial and human\r\nresources. And the resources must come from national\r\nGovernments as well as the international community.\r\nWe have recently strengthened the Danish\r\ndevelopment assistance programme in the area of\r\nhealth — especially reproductive health and\r\nHIV/AIDS. We have done it bilaterally, through new\r\nhealth sector programmes and increased mainstreaming\r\nof HIV/AIDS. And we have done it multilaterally,\r\nthrough increased contributions.\r\nLet me underline the importance of continuing\r\nthe important task of turning the Cairo commitments\r\ninto action. Respect for sexual and reproductive health\r\nand rights, and adequate reproductive health care and\r\nservices are indispensable elements in the fight against\r\npoverty and thus in achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. I can assure you that Denmark\r\nwill stay committed to the implementation of the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action, and we can only urge all\r\nMember States to do the same.\r\nIn this respect, the role of the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) will continue to be crucial,\r\nif we are going to turn the Cairo commitments into\r\nreality.\r\nI would also like to conclude by assuring UNFPA\r\nand its able and dedicated Executive Director, of the\r\ncontinued support of the Government of Denmark to\r\nthe work ahead of us.\r\nMr. Talbot (Guyana): Guyana associates itself\r\nwith the statements made by the representative of\r\nQatar, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and by\r\nBarbados on behalf of CARICOM member States.\r\nIn the words of the Programme of Action adopted\r\nat the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD), “People are the most important\r\nand valuable resource of any nation.” Indeed, the\r\neradication of poverty and the achievement of\r\neconomic and social progress rest critically on the\r\nempowerment of people and the creation of\r\nopportunities for the fullest realization of their\r\npotential.\r\nOur gathering here today on the tenth anniversary\r\nof ICPD marks a renewed recognition of the centrality\r\nof people in development.\r\nThe Government of Guyana remains firmly\r\ncommitted to the full and effective implementation of\r\nthe Cairo Programme of Action. In signing the World\r\nLeaders Statement in support of the ICPD, the\r\nPresident of Guyana, His Excellency Mr. Bharrat\r\nJagdeo, signified that my country’s commitment to the\r\nProgramme of Action extends to the very highest levels\r\nof our Government.\r\nSince the Cairo agenda was adopted in 1994,\r\nsignificant advances have been made in its\r\nimplementation. We are encouraged by the progress\r\nmade in reducing infant mortality, promoting gender\r\nequality and women’s rights and securing universal\r\naccess to education, particularly as it relates to the girl\r\nchild.\r\nAt the national level, over the past decade my\r\nGovernment has made sustained efforts to improve the\r\nquality of life of all Guyanese through increased\r\ninvestment in education, health, housing and the\r\nprovision of other basic social services. We have taken\r\ndefinitive measures to further promote gender equality\r\nand the empowerment of women, including through the\r\nDomestic Violence Act of 1996, which provides a legal\r\n44\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nframework of rights and protections against violence\r\nand exploitation.\r\nMore recently, the establishment of several\r\nconstitutional commissions — on human rights, ethnic\r\nrelations, women and gender equity, indigenous\r\npeoples and the rights of the child, respectively — has\r\nbeen part of a concerted national effort to assure the\r\nfullest enjoyment of rights and freedoms by all\r\nsegments of our population.\r\nNotwithstanding the achievements made so far,\r\nmany challenges remain at both the national and the\r\nglobal levels. HIV/AIDS continues to exact an\r\nastronomical human cost in many countries and\r\nsocieties. Regrettably, Guyana has not been spared the\r\nravages of that pandemic. Particularly disturbing is its\r\nprevalence among our young people: the majority of\r\nour present and future workers and leaders.\r\nMy Government is determined to overcome the\r\nthreat posed by HIV/AIDS, and we are grateful for the\r\nsupport provided by friendly Governments, the United\r\nNations system and the wider international community.\r\nOur actions are focused on education and awareness-\r\nraising as part of an integrated approach to prevention,\r\ntreatment and care, coupled with efforts to eliminate\r\nthe stigmatization of and discrimination against people\r\nliving with HIV/AIDS.\r\nWe must also acknowledge that, globally, many\r\nwomen still do not enjoy all of their human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms and are thus deprived of the\r\nopportunity to contribute fully to the development of\r\ntheir societies. Much more remains to be done to\r\nenhance the status of women and children at all levels\r\nand to ensure that their rights are fully respected.\r\nProgress in reducing maternal and child mortality and\r\nstrengthening basic health systems and programmes,\r\nincluding reproductive and sexual health programmes,\r\nneeds to be accelerated. My Government remains\r\ncommitted to those objectives and is working in active\r\npartnership with the private sector and civil society to\r\nensure the delivery of services to our people.\r\nMy delegation wishes to note further that the loss\r\nof human resources through migration continues to\r\nhamper the achievement of national development\r\nobjectives in developing countries such as my own.\r\nGuyana endorses the view that migration has become a\r\nmajor issue of concern for the international community.\r\nWe support a comprehensive examination of the\r\nquestion under the aegis of the United Nations and\r\nlook forward to the report of the Global Commission\r\non International Migration, and to the United Nations\r\nhigh-level dialogue on migration to be held in 2006.\r\nFinally, it must be observed that resource\r\nprovisions remain significantly below actual\r\nrequirements to achieve the Cairo goals and those\r\ncontained in the Millennium Declaration. Those goals\r\ncannot be met by the actions of Governments alone,\r\nmuch less by the actions of Governments in developing\r\ncountries. International cooperation remains\r\nindispensable. The need to engage all actors in both the\r\npublic and the private sectors has never been greater.\r\nThe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA),\r\nas the lead United Nations agency in the follow-up and\r\nimplementation of the Cairo agenda deserves the\r\nfullest support of the international community in its\r\nefforts to improve the lives of people everywhere.\r\nMr. Mojarro (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): It is a\r\ngreat honour for me to address the General Assembly\r\nand to express our appreciation to the United Nations\r\nand to Ms. Thoraya Obaid of the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) for their support for this\r\ncommemoration of the tenth anniversary of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD).\r\nIn Mexico, the challenge of implementing the\r\nagreements and recommendations of the ICPD has\r\nbeen met jointly by society and the Government.\r\nCooperation between Government institutions and civil\r\nsociety organizations is expressed through opening\r\ninstitutional spaces for dialogue and a rich and broad\r\nvariety of forms of cooperation beneficial to both\r\nsides.\r\nMexico’s recent report on implementation of the\r\nICPD Programme of Action from 1994 to 2003\r\ndescribes that cooperation and the goals that have been\r\naccomplished. Our Government agrees with the Cairo\r\nconsensus in placing at the core of its concerns a\r\nbroadening of individuals’ capacities and opportunities;\r\nthe full exercise of human rights, including rights\r\nrelating to sexuality and reproduction; improving\r\nreproductive health; eliminating gender and\r\ngenerational inequalities; and eliminating poverty.\r\nThe Mexican Government views reproductive\r\nhealth as an essential and indispensable component of\r\nhuman development and of the enjoyment of many\r\nother rights of citizens. As the result of efforts made in\r\n45\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nrecent years, it is estimated that between 1994 and\r\n2003, the percentage of our population with access to\r\nprenatal care rose from 89 per cent to 96 per cent.\r\nContraceptive use rose from 65 to 73 per cent during\r\nthe same period, the number of deliveries under\r\nmedical care rose from 7 to more than 9 out of 10, and\r\nfertility is now near the replacement rate. Nonetheless,\r\nwe must continue our strategy in order to reduce\r\nmaternal mortality even further.\r\nOur Government’s commitment to Mexican\r\nwomen is expressed in the formulation of the national\r\nprogramme for women in 1996 and the establishment\r\nin 2001 of the National Institute for Women. Through\r\nthose mechanisms, we are promoting the concerted and\r\ncoordinated participation of all Government sectors for\r\nthe advancement of women and to mainstream the\r\ngender perspective.\r\nOver the past 10 years, greater equity has been\r\nachieved in access to education, health and\r\nemployment opportunities, in the establishment of\r\ngood legal frameworks to ensure the full exercise of\r\nthe human rights of women and the improvement of the\r\nstatus of women within the family.\r\nNonetheless, it is undeniable that there is still\r\ninequality in gender relations, particularly in those\r\ngroups that lag the furthest behind, such as the\r\nindigenous population. It is therefore necessary to\r\ncontinue to promote the participation of women in all\r\neconomic and social spheres, in the decision-making\r\nprocess and in the equitable distribution of power.\r\nOur country is confronting the enormous\r\nchallenge of overcoming profound social inequalities\r\nthat endanger the lives of millions of Mexicans. In\r\norder to ensure that persons fully exercise their\r\nreproductive rights, it is vital to continue to broaden\r\nprogrammes against poverty, exclusion and\r\nmarginalization.\r\nMexico’s Opportunities Programme seeks,\r\nthrough educational, nutritional and health support, to\r\noffset the poverty of 4.2 million families. The impact\r\nhas been a significant reduction of extreme poverty by\r\n16 per cent in just two years. The Mexican\r\nGovernment attaches high priority to our unusually\r\nlarge population of adolescents and young people. To\r\nmeet the needs of adolescents, we have promoted\r\nhealth-care programmes designed specifically for them\r\nand have substantially broadened their access to\r\ninformation, education, advice and sexual and\r\nreproductive health services.\r\nIn particular, we emphasize our grant programme,\r\nwhich has benefited 4.6 million students, so that they\r\ndo not leave school because of financial reasons. The\r\nprogrammes promote the broadening of skills and\r\ndevelopment choices, so that young people will have\r\nalternatives to early marriage, motherhood and\r\nfatherhood.\r\nDespite that progress, the problems in this sector\r\nare still enormous. The emergence of sexually\r\ntransmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS requires that the\r\nGovernment redouble its efforts and promote greater\r\nparticipation by all of those who play a relevant role in\r\nthe development of youth.\r\nWith regard to immigration and in accordance\r\nwith the recommendations of the ICPD, the\r\nGovernment of Mexico has committed itself to\r\nbuilding a nation that offers equal opportunities to its\r\ninhabitants so that they will not have to leave the\r\ncountry to seek them elsewhere. That is also in\r\naccordance with the structuring of concerted migration\r\npolicies within the United Nations system and the\r\ninter-American system and with neighbouring\r\ncountries to ensure respect for the rights of migrants\r\nand facilitate their incorporation in development.\r\nThere are achievements to be celebrated at this\r\ntenth anniversary of the ICPD. But we also recognize\r\nthat not all the goals have been met. We need\r\ninnovative and effective strategies, such as South-\r\nSouth cooperation and strong support from UNFPA,\r\nthat are agreed to and respected by States, that\r\nmaximize the benefits and reduce the harmful effects\r\nof economic globalization and that acknowledge and\r\nare consistent with those demographic characteristics.\r\nOnly in that manner will we be able to guarantee the\r\nhuman rights of all peoples of all ages and thus achieve\r\nthe objectives of the ICPD by 2015 and achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nThe Mexican Government again reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to the Programme of Action of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment and to the key measures and the\r\nresolution adopted by the Economic Commission for\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean in San Juan, Puerto\r\nRico, in July this year, so that we can continue to\r\nprogress in shaping an international agenda that makes\r\nit possible, in a timely and efficient way, to deal with\r\n46\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nall of the problems affecting us, and the complex new\r\nchallenges confronting our countries.\r\nMr. Martirosyan (Armenia): Ten years ago in\r\nCairo the international community universally\r\nrecognized the link between population and\r\ndevelopment. The Programme of Action adopted at the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD) set out as benchmark goals\r\nachieving universal education, reducing child and\r\nmaternal mortality, empowering women, ensuring\r\nuniversal access to reproductive health care and\r\npreventing sexually transmitted diseases, including\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nToday, it is obvious that this link lies at the heart\r\nof achieving the Millennium Development Goals. As\r\nwe are approaching the first review of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration in 2005, today’s meeting offers a timely\r\nopportunity to take the first steps towards a global\r\nassessment of the progress made, identify the\r\nchallenges ahead and elaborate measures to overcome\r\nthe remaining obstacles.\r\nArmenia believes that effective implementation\r\nof the development agenda requires first and foremost\r\nstrong national ownership, including the active\r\ninvolvement of civil society. At the same time, given\r\nthe magnitude of the problem, international\r\ncooperation and the support of the international\r\ncommunity are essential for the successful completion\r\nof national strategies.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\r\nmy Government’s sincere appreciation to all donor\r\nGovernments and international organizations that have\r\nprovided both expertise and financial assistance to\r\nvarious programmes implemented in Armenia.\r\nAt the time of the Cairo Conference Armenia was\r\nundergoing a significant political transformation,\r\nwhich entailed a major economic crisis and resulted in\r\nincreased poverty, demographic decline and migration.\r\nWe are proud that, due to political and economic\r\nreforms, we were able to reverse the trend and register\r\nsome progress, including in the areas of the ICPD\r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nNotwithstanding some decline in the general\r\nquality of education, the country enjoys almost\r\nuniversal literacy, with no gender disparity among\r\nstudents.\r\nIn October 2001, Armenia, with the support of\r\nthe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and\r\nother donors, conducted its first national census after\r\nits independence. The data has been used in the\r\ndesigning of economic and social policies of the\r\ncountry.\r\nIn order to promote empowerment of women, the\r\nnational mechanism on the advancement of women was\r\nestablished in Armenia in 2002, and the National Plan\r\nof Action on the Improvement of the Status of Women\r\nwas adopted earlier this year.\r\nTrue empowerment of women is impossible\r\nwithout enabling them to make informed decisions on\r\nreproductive health and family planning issues. The\r\nNational Reproductive Health Programme was\r\ndeveloped as early as 1995 and consists of three\r\ncomponents: family planning, prenatal services and\r\nreproductive health education for young people. The\r\nUNFPA has been instrumental in the implementation of\r\nthe programme. Successful travelling-doctor projects\r\nwere introduced in several regions, making those\r\nservices available in remote rural areas. As a result of\r\nthose policies, there has been some reduction in\r\nmaternal and infant and child mortality rates.\r\nIn December 2002, Armenia adopted the Law on\r\nReproductive Health and Reproductive Rights, which\r\nis based on ICPD principles and establishes a legal\r\nframework for their effective implementation in the\r\ncountry. It also requires introduction of reproductive\r\nhealth education in all public schools. The currently\r\nlow level of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Armenia\r\nprovides an opportunity for early targeted intervention\r\nto prevent further spread of the disease. The National\r\nStrategic Programme to combat HIV/AIDS was\r\nlaunched in 2002 in close partnership with the United\r\nNations country team.\r\nWhile we are pleased with the progress made, we\r\nalso realize that much needs to be done to achieve a\r\nprosperous society and the well-being of its individual\r\ncitizens.\r\nProblems of refugees — resulting from the ethnic\r\ncleansing of the entire Armenian population in\r\nAzerbaijan, meticulously planned and systematically\r\nexecuted by its authorities in Sumgait, Kirovabad and\r\nBaku, starting in 1988 and continuing in 1990 and\r\n1991 — and problems of internally displaced persons,\r\nwhich constitute about 14 per cent of the population,\r\nrequire particular attention. The Government has\r\n47\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nadopted the policy of integrating those people into\r\nsociety. In 1996, the National Assembly passed the\r\nLaw on Refugees, which gives them the right to\r\nacquire Armenian citizenship. Also, the Government is\r\nundertaking measures to provide special socio-\r\neconomic assistance.\r\nMigration, which reached rather high levels in the\r\n1990s, is another area of concern. In response, the\r\nGovernment adopted the concept of State regulation of\r\nmigration in November 2000. It is encouraging that the\r\nrecent improvement of the economic situation has\r\nhalted the migration flows.\r\nPoverty eradication as a key to the solution of\r\nmany socio-economic problems faced by the country is\r\namong the major priorities of the Government. To that\r\nend, the Poverty Reduction Strategic Programme was\r\nadopted in 2003, covering, inter alia, various ICPD\r\nrelated issues.\r\nFull implementation of the Cairo Consensus,\r\nwhich affirmed a people-centred approach to\r\ndevelopment, is essential for achieving human progress\r\nand ensuring human rights and dignity for all. The\r\nGovernment of Armenia is committed to continuing its\r\nefforts to implement those goals and to work\r\nconstructively with all interested stakeholders.\r\nMr. Al-Habsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): On behalf of the delegation of the United\r\nArab Emirates, I have the honour to express our thanks\r\nand appreciation to the members of the Commission on\r\nPopulation and Development and to the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) for their constructive\r\nefforts, which have helped to strengthen international\r\nefforts to implement the Programme of Action of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD). I would also like to associate\r\nmyself with the statement made by the representative\r\nof Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nDespite the fact that 10 years have passed since\r\nthe holding of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development in Cairo, international\r\nprogress to improve national population projects and to\r\nintegrate them into development strategies has not met\r\nour expectations. That is particularly so in developing\r\ncountries, where millions of people suffer from the\r\nimpact of armed conflict, poverty, disease and\r\nilliteracy. Those people lack the most basic of services,\r\nincluding housing, health care, education and other\r\nappropriate social services.\r\nThe continuation of such a discouraging state of\r\naffairs half way to 2014 is a reflection of the failure to\r\nimplement the outcome of the Conference, in particular\r\nwith regard to allocating $18.5 billion by 2005 for\r\npopulation projects in developing countries. Doing that\r\nwould require political will on the part of developed\r\nand donor countries to meet their commitment to\r\ndevote 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product to\r\nofficial development assistance, thereby making it\r\npossible for poor countries to rehabilitate their\r\nfinancial, development, economic and social\r\ninfrastructure. That would help them to develop local\r\ninstitutional capacities and to remove the obstacles\r\npreventing them from integrating population concerns\r\ninto their national development plans and strategies.\r\nOn the instructions of His Royal Highness Sheikh\r\nZayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, our head of State, the\r\nGovernment of the United Arab Emirates has placed\r\nhuman development and population issues at the top of\r\nits concerns. We have promulgated the appropriate\r\nlegislation in that regard and have budgeted the funds\r\nnecessary to ensure that citizens receive the best care\r\nand that they are protected and nurtured in their\r\ndevelopment, thus enabling them to become more\r\ninvolved in the implementation of national\r\ndevelopment plans on the basis of decentralization and\r\ncooperation among federal institutions, local\r\ngovernments, the private sector and other concerned\r\nstakeholders.\r\nOur country has also adopted national\r\ndevelopment policies aimed at achieving justice and\r\nsocial security for its citizens. Those include an\r\ninitiative begun in 1999, in cooperation with the World\r\nHealth Organization and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme to implement a\r\ncomprehensive health strategy that will cover the\r\nperiod through 2010. The goal of that strategy is to\r\nprovide the best possible health care for citizens,\r\nthereby contributing to decreasing mortality rates and\r\ndisease, especially among women and children.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates has also implemented\r\nnumerous strategies to promote social services. Those\r\nstrategies, which were developed in cooperation with\r\nUnited Nations experts, include improving the care\r\nprovided to children, women, families, persons with\r\nspecial needs, the disabled and the elderly. We have\r\nalso adopted an integrated social security policy to\r\nensure a broad safety net of assistance for eligible\r\nneedy and afflicted persons. That has contributed to\r\n48\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nensuring psychological stability and public security\r\namong the population.\r\nOur country has implemented an advanced\r\nstrategy aimed at providing free primary, secondary\r\nand higher education for its citizens and including\r\nliteracy and adult education programmes. The result\r\nhas been a significant qualitative change in the way\r\npeople utilize developments in technology. In addition,\r\nwe have set up vocational, technical and technological\r\ntraining centres to develop the skills of young people,\r\nincluding women, who have recently been playing a\r\nprominent role in national development strategies and\r\nprogrammes. That role has served to better integrate\r\nwomen into local public and private labour markets\r\nand volunteer work, thereby helping them to serve their\r\ncommunities on the basis of equal opportunity with\r\nmen.\r\nWe believe that population concerns can only be\r\naddressed in the framework of the comprehensive\r\ndevelopment of our populations, and we have begun to\r\nbuild model cities, villages and other human\r\nsettlements in which people enjoy high levels of\r\nmunicipal services and appropriate housing that is\r\nequipped with all the necessary facilities and services.\r\nWe have also carried out many important projects to\r\nimprove living conditions in rural and outlying areas,\r\nto build public housing for Bedouins and to provide\r\nstate-of-the-art services in the areas of drinking water,\r\nelectricity, communications and transport. We have\r\nalso expanded our agricultural, grazing, animal\r\nhusbandry and fisheries capacities. We have\r\nimplemented many reforestation and environmental\r\nprojects and have built new recreation and tourism\r\nfacilities.\r\nIn conclusion, we continue to be concerned about\r\nthe ongoing population increase, the low level of\r\neconomic growth and the heavy debt burden which\r\ncontinue to impede the efforts of many developing\r\ncountries. We call for the promotion of international\r\ncooperation, in particular with regard to the\r\nmobilization of bilateral and multilateral resources,\r\nwith a view to achieving the desired goals of the\r\nProgramme of Action of the International Conference\r\non Population and Development. In that regard, we\r\nwould also like to underscore the need to respect the\r\nsovereign rights, national laws and development\r\npriorities of every State, including full respect for the\r\nreligious and cultural specificities of each country, in\r\naccordance with internationally recognized human\r\nrights standards.\r\nMrs. Vargas de Acosta (Honduras) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): As it did 10 years ago, the Republic of\r\nHonduras today reaffirms its commitment to the\r\nProgramme of Action adopted in 1994 at the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment. The Cairo consensus resolutely\r\nestablished the close link that exists between\r\npopulation strategies and the reduction of poverty,\r\nthereby changing the world’s perspective and\r\nemphasizing the need to take concrete measures, not\r\nonly globally but also, and in particular, at the national\r\nlevel.\r\nWorking in close cooperation with civil society\r\nand in full respect for the diverse religious, ethical and\r\ncultural values of our people and internationally\r\nrecognized human rights, the Government of Honduras\r\nhas established a legal and institutional framework that\r\nreflects our development priorities. From the very\r\noutset, the current Government of Honduras has\r\nendeavoured to implement that legal and institutional\r\nframework in order to improve the lives of Honduran\r\nmen, women and children.\r\nIn 2002, the national women’s policy was made\r\nState policy. The poverty-reduction strategy of the\r\nGovernment of Honduras, which was developed with\r\nthe active participation of civil society in order to reach\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, attaches high\r\npriority to reducing maternal and infant mortality,\r\npreventing HIV/AIDS and narrowing the gender gap.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nIn 1999, Honduras emphatically reaffirmed its\r\nsupport for the Cairo consensus and adopted the\r\nnecessary measures to continue to implement the\r\nProgramme of Action of the International Conference\r\non Population and Development agreed at the five-year\r\nreview of the implementation of the Programme.\r\nDuring this, the year of the tenth anniversary of\r\nthe holding of the Conference, the Government of\r\nHonduras has been participating at a high level in the\r\nentire process of evaluating the implementation of the\r\nconsensus. In that context, we have joined the\r\nunanimous voice of the entire American hemisphere\r\nexpressed in the Santiago Declaration of the Americas\r\nto reaffirm our commitment to the Cairo consensus.\r\n49\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nGiven the impact that progress on population\r\nissues has on the development of our country, we\r\nbelieve this to be a crucial moment to evaluate the\r\nachievements made and to strengthen international\r\ncommitment with regard to implementing the goals set\r\nout at Cairo. After 10 years, we can say with\r\nconfidence that the attainment of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals depends upon our following the\r\nguidelines established in the Cairo consensus, while\r\nkeeping our sights on the needs and rights of\r\nindividuals and seeking to create the necessary\r\nalliances to achieve that fundamental objective.\r\nWe believe it appropriate on this occasion to\r\nexpress our appreciation to the United Nations system\r\nand to underscore the proactive role being played by\r\nthe United Nations Population Fund in the\r\nimplementation of the Cairo consensus. The\r\nGovernment of Honduras, which I am proud to\r\nrepresent, reaffirms its commitment to continue to fight\r\nto achieve the goals set out at Cairo for the well-being\r\nof all the men and women of Honduras.\r\nMiss Lohpechra (Thailand): My delegation\r\nassociates itself with the statement made earlier by the\r\nrepresentative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nI would like to extend my best wishes to you, Sir,\r\nand to congratulate you on the holding of this\r\nimportant event to commemorate the tenth anniversary\r\nof the convening of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD). I also appreciate\r\nthe fruitful discussion that took place on Tuesday\r\nduring the round table on the theme “International\r\nmigration and development: the challenges ahead”,\r\nwhich was organized by the United Nations Population\r\nFund (UNFPA).\r\nWith regard to the issue of migration and\r\ndevelopment, Thailand wishes to commend the United\r\nNations and the Government of Switzerland for the\r\nprogress made in the work of the Global Commission\r\non International Migration and the Berne Initiative, in\r\nboth of which migration and development are the\r\nsubject of ongoing discussions. Such dialogue and\r\npractical cooperation have the potential to increase\r\nmutual understanding on the nature, causes and\r\nimpacts of international migration and its relationship\r\nto development. We pledge our full cooperation to the\r\nUnited Nations and all other partner agencies in\r\nmanaging migration for the benefit of all.\r\nThailand attaches great importance to the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action that was\r\nthe product of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development, which was held in Cairo\r\nin 1994. According to Thailand’s first report on the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), which was\r\nofficially launched in June of this year, poverty in\r\nThailand has been reduced by two thirds since 1990.\r\nThe number of underweight children has fallen by\r\nnearly half. Malaria is no longer a problem in most\r\nparts of the country. Annual rates of new HIV\r\ninfections have been reduced by over 80 per cent since\r\n1991, the peak of the epidemic. Gender disparity in\r\nprimary and secondary education has been eliminated.\r\nUniversal access to primary school education is likely\r\nto be achieved within a few years. Progress is also\r\nbeing made in reaching maternal- and child-health\r\ntargets.\r\nWith regard to the issue of HIV/AIDS, Thailand\r\nbegan to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS in the early\r\n1990s, and we were among the very first countries to\r\nmeet the MDG target in that regard. Annual rates of\r\nnew infections have fallen dramatically, from an\r\nestimated 143,000 new infections in 1991 to about\r\n19,000 in 2003. Nevertheless, the pandemic still poses\r\na major threat to the country. In that regard, we hope to\r\nshift HIV-prevention efforts to devote more attention to\r\nthe vulnerability of young people in general. At the\r\nsame time, effective prevention efforts should also\r\ntarget other specific vulnerable groups, such as mobile\r\nworkers and injecting drug users.\r\nIn July this year, Thailand had the honour to host\r\nthe XV International AIDS Conference and the second\r\nAsia-Pacific Ministerial Meeting on HIV/AIDS. Those\r\nevents have contributed to strengthening international\r\ncooperation in addressing the issue of HIV/AIDS,\r\nparticularly through strong and renewed political\r\ncommitment and leadership.\r\nOur progress in the area of development and in\r\nimplementing the ICPD Programme of Action can be\r\nattributed to a number of factors, such as national\r\nharmony, sound public policy, democratic governance,\r\nrapid economic expansion, public investment in social\r\nservices and advantageous historical and geopolitical\r\ncircumstances. Extensive rural development\r\nprogrammes undertaken by governmental agencies and\r\nnon-governmental organizations in Thailand have also\r\nresulted in overall progress in reducing poverty,\r\n50\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nimproving nutrition and meeting the basic human needs\r\nof the Thai people.\r\nThailand is now in the unique position of being\r\nable to contribute to the global partnership for\r\ndevelopment. Through our experiences, knowledge and\r\nmistakes, Thailand believes that it can make a\r\nsignificant contribution to international efforts to meet\r\nthe development goals internationally agreed at the\r\nICPD. We trust that we can be an important partner in\r\ndevelopment initiatives for other developing countries,\r\nas well as within the United Nations system, by\r\noffering development cooperation and taking part in\r\nsubregional and regional cooperation initiatives.\r\nIn that regard, South-South cooperation should be\r\npromoted and further strengthened in a number of key\r\nareas, including those of reproductive health, child and\r\nmaternal health, education and gender equality, as\r\nidentified by the Programme of Action. Thailand\r\nwould be pleased and ready to contribute to such an\r\nendeavour. We would also like to encourage UNFPA to\r\nenhance its technical cooperation activities through a\r\nThailand-UNFPA partnership to assist developing\r\ncountries in the greater Mekong subregion in various\r\nareas of population and development.\r\nMr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): It has been 10\r\nyears since the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development took place in Cairo. The consensus\r\non a full range of issues — from the need to ensure\r\ngender equality, reproductive health and rights,\r\ninformation and education for young people, measures\r\nto prevent HIV/AIDS and fight violence against\r\nwomen, to steps to protect the environment — reflects\r\nthe commitment and the resolve of the nations of the\r\nworld to place a new focus on population-related\r\npolicies and activities. That also means a focus on\r\nquality of services, on quality of life and on sustainable\r\nhuman development. The Programme of Action\r\nadopted by the Conference has been universally\r\nrecognized as a landmark document that has governed\r\nour actions over the past decade.\r\nToday’s commemorative meeting is indeed a\r\nvaluable opportunity for us to look back at the process\r\nof its implementation with a view to mapping out a\r\nsuitable course for further action. As we do so, we find\r\nstrong encouragement in the statement by world\r\nleaders issued just yesterday.\r\nWe note with pleasure that in many countries,\r\nboth the Government and non-governmental entities\r\nhave been making vigorous and coordinated efforts to\r\ncarry out the ICPD’s Programme of Action.\r\nMeaningful achievements have been recorded during\r\nthe past 10 years, as reported by United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund. A reduction in the global birth rate,\r\ncoupled with a decline in the maternal mortality rate\r\nand an increase in life expectancy, is a notable example\r\nof the humanitarian nature and the sustainability of the\r\nnew approach.\r\nHowever, I would like to echo what Ms. Obaid,\r\nExecutive Director of the United Nations Population\r\nFund, stated this morning before the General\r\nAssembly — that, while we must celebrate our\r\nachievements, we must also be realistic. She pointed to\r\nkey challenges facing us. Perhaps, among those key\r\nissues, the most vital is to ensure that we can reach all\r\npeople in need of assistance.\r\nWhile progress has been encouraging globally,\r\nwhen we look at individual countries, we see that\r\nprogress has been uneven. Many developing countries,\r\nespecially those in Africa, continue to face serious\r\ndifficulties and challenges in implementing their\r\nnational programmes. A lack of funds is the most\r\ncommon problem. New and deadly diseases are\r\nemerging, while the HIV/AIDS pandemic is showing\r\nno sign of abating. That situation is hindering the\r\nefforts of many countries to achieve the goals of not\r\nonly their population programmes but also of their\r\nhunger eradication and poverty reduction plans, thus\r\nmaking the achievement of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) even more remote.\r\nIn that connection, Viet Nam shares the concern\r\nof the Group of 77 and China over the failure to meet\r\nthe target of mobilizing $17 billion for population\r\nactivities, and over the challenge of reaching $18.5\r\nbillion by 2005. We hope that, following this meeting,\r\nrenewed efforts will be made to realize the\r\ncommitment by developed countries to allocate 0.7 per\r\ncent of gross domestic product for official development\r\nassistance, thus helping developing countries to\r\novercome a major obstacle in their implementation of\r\nthe ICPD’s Programme of Action.\r\nIn Viet Nam, population activities are being\r\nundertaken within the framework of our overall Ten-\r\nyear Socio-Economic Development Strategy, which\r\nruns until 2010 and which combines economic\r\ndevelopment with social progress. The Programme of\r\nAction adopted by the International Conference on\r\n51\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nPopulation and Development fits well into our socio-\r\neconomic development strategy. In carrying out our\r\npopulation activities, we are coordinating our activities\r\nclosely with United Nations agencies, especially the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund, within the framework\r\nof the United Nations Development Assistance\r\n(UNDAF).\r\nWe are also receiving valuable support and\r\nassistance from domestic and foreign non-\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs). Viet Nam has\r\nbeen recognized as one of the most successful\r\ncountries in the area of population activities, and in\r\n1999 we received the United Nations Population\r\nAward. On this occasion, on behalf on my Government,\r\nI wish to convey to all our friends and partners our\r\nmost sincere gratitude. We look to working with all of\r\nthem in the context of further action to implement the\r\nICPD’s Programme of Action and achieve the MDGs.\r\nMr. Thapa (Nepal): Allow me to extend my\r\nsincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your well-\r\ndeserved election as President of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-ninth session. I would like also to\r\ncongratulate the Vice-Presidents of the General\r\nAssembly on their election.\r\nI would like to express my delegation’s sincere\r\nappreciation to the Executive Director of the United\r\nNations Population Fund, Ms. Thoraya Obaid, and to\r\nthe staff of the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA) for having made the necessary arrangements\r\nfor the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD).\r\nI would also like to associate myself with the\r\nstatement made this morning by the delegation of the\r\nState of Qatar, on behalf of the Group of 77.\r\nEducated, healthy and skilled human resources\r\nand small and happy families constitute the bedrock of\r\nsustainable development. Ten years have elapsed since\r\nthe international community adopted the Programme of\r\nAction of the ICPD — a 20-year blueprint for the\r\ninternational community to accelerate socio-economic\r\ndevelopment through better population management\r\nand to fight poverty by ensuring universal access to\r\nsexual and reproductive health services and rights for\r\nall by 2015.\r\nThe high population growth rate has had an\r\nadverse impact on the utilization of resources for\r\ndevelopment and on the generation of employment\r\nopportunities. That remains a major challenge to most\r\nof the least-developed countries in terms of their\r\nnational development efforts. My own country is no\r\nexception.\r\nNepal attaches great importance to the\r\nimplementation of the ICPD Programme of Action,\r\nwhich it considers to be a global framework for\r\nreinforcing gender equality and human development.\r\nWe believe that the commemoration of the tenth\r\nanniversary of the ICPD provides a good opportunity\r\nto connect this event with next year’s comprehensive\r\nappraisal of the progress made towards achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nNepal has undertaken various measures to\r\nimplement the commitments made in the Cairo\r\nDeclaration of the ICPD. We have adopted a national\r\npopulation policy to increase the quality of the\r\npopulation, reduce the population growth rate and\r\nregulate migration. In 1995, His Majesty’s Government\r\nestablished a separate Ministry of Population and\r\nEnvironment to lead and coordinate population- and\r\nenvironment-related activities as well as to develop and\r\nmonitor a national policy for the implementation of the\r\nICPD Programme of Action. The ninth (1997-2002)\r\nand, currently, the tenth (2002-2007) five-year\r\ndevelopment plans have integrated population\r\ndynamics into development planning.\r\nNepal has focused, among other things, on\r\nincreasing income-generating activities and improving\r\nthe status of women, as well as fostering easy access to\r\nbasic education and to reproductive health and family-\r\nplanning services. We have achieved some progress in\r\nlowering the population growth rate, the infant\r\nmortality rate, the maternal mortality rate and the total\r\nfertility rate. The contraceptive-use rate, life\r\nexpectancy and the literacy rate all have increased.\r\nNepal’s long-term objective is to bring down the total\r\nfertility rate to the replacement level in 20 years by\r\nensuring qualitative family planning and maternal and\r\nchild health services, as well as encouraging couples to\r\nhave a two-child family.\r\nWe are of the view that the Cairo Programme of\r\nAction and the Millennium Development Goals are\r\nmutually reinforcing and that their coordinated\r\nimplementation is important. We believe that\r\ninvestment in education and public health contributes\r\nto poverty alleviation and employment generation.\r\n52\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nHence, my delegation supports the idea of an\r\nintegrated approach to population and development.\r\nThe latest statistics reveal that some 38 million\r\npeople are living with HIV/AIDS. The pandemic is\r\nspreading, and every year about 5 million new\r\ninfections occur around the world. Many people in\r\nNepal have also been infected by this illness. Many\r\ncountries have begun to witness a large number of their\r\nyoung people being decimated by the disease and their\r\ndevelopment gains being reversed. To change that, the\r\nglobal community will have to redouble its efforts and\r\nseek new patterns of partnerships for better synergy.\r\nNepal supports efforts to reduce the prevalence of\r\nHIV/AIDS among young people and expand their\r\naccess to information and services for preventing\r\ninfection. We urge the international community to take\r\nserious measures to provide access to antiretroviral\r\ntherapy for people in developing countries suffering\r\nfrom HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases.\r\nMuch has changed since 1994. Indeed, some\r\nprogress has been made in reducing poverty, promoting\r\ngender equality, bringing down population growth rates\r\nand containing HIV/AIDS in several developing\r\ncountries. The active partnership between\r\nGovernments and civil society has been one of the\r\nfactors contributing to that progress. However, there is\r\nno room for complacency. Millions of people in\r\nvarious parts of the world are still suffering from\r\npoverty, illiteracy, malnutrition and diseases such as\r\nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic. The international community\r\nstill faces the daunting challenge of attaining the goals\r\nof the ICPD and the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nDeveloping countries, particularly least developed\r\ncountries, face resource and technological constraints\r\nin accelerating their national development goals.\r\nNepal is confident that through our collective\r\nefforts and international cooperation, we will be able to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals and the\r\ngoals of the ICPD.\r\nMr. Solórzano (Nicaragua) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nthank you, Sir, for presiding so capably over this\r\nimportant meeting to commemorate the tenth\r\nanniversary of one of the most important and valuable\r\nuniversal consensuses achieved in the area of\r\npopulation and development for our societies.\r\nOn behalf of my delegation, I express my thanks\r\nfor the United Nations Population Fund’s valuable\r\ncooperation for the development of my country and the\r\ngenerous solidarity the Fund has extended to us over\r\nthe last 10 years. During this period, our country has\r\nmade significant advances in the area of policies and\r\nnorms for population and development. They include\r\nthe national development plan, which implements the\r\nProgramme of Action of the 1994 Cairo International\r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD),\r\nprincipally through the analysis of the links between\r\npopulation dynamics, population mobility — internal\r\nand international migration — education of women,\r\nsexual and reproductive health and education of our\r\nsociety.\r\nIn that regard, it should be stressed that to make\r\ngreat progress towards achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals requires a profound commitment\r\nto attain better levels of development in our country\r\nwith respect to the quality of life, which encompasses\r\nhealth, education and opportunities, which are key\r\nfactors in sustainable human development.\r\nI am pleased to say on this occasion that\r\nNicaragua confirms the Programme of Action and\r\nconsiders it a valuable tool to combat poverty. We also\r\nreiterate the specific reservations expressed by the\r\nNicaraguan delegation in Cairo in 1994 with respect to\r\nthe Programme of Action consensus adopted at the\r\nICPD and with respect to the priorities underlined at\r\nthe twenty-first special session of the General\r\nAssembly, in 1999, to review the Conference’s\r\ngoals — the five-year review of the International\r\nConference on Population and Development known as\r\nICPD+5.\r\nNicaragua reaffirms its unqualified respect for the\r\nright to life from the moment of conception. For that\r\nreason, abortion or the interruption of pregnancy can in\r\nno circumstances be treated as a means of controlling\r\nfertility or as a means of birth control, as stated in the\r\nICPD Programme of Action. The Government of\r\nNicaragua accepts the concepts of reproductive rights\r\nand reproductive health and considers that abortion is\r\nnot a component of those rights.\r\nFinally, my delegation reaffirms its commitment\r\nto continue supporting the work of the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund because we recognize the importance\r\nof the services it provides for the development of\r\ncountries that request its assistance and experience in\r\nthe field of population and development. We know that\r\na great deal remains for us to do, especially with\r\n53\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nrespect to our country’s high population growth rate.\r\nThat is why we are committed to continuing actions\r\nundertaken and making those efforts enduring. In that\r\ncontext, we are fully confident that we will have the\r\nneeded, generous international cooperation, which we\r\nfully appreciate.\r\nMr. Tesfu (Ethiopia): I would like to thank the\r\nDeputy Secretary-General and the Executive Director\r\nof the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for\r\ntheir introductory remarks on the issue. Ethiopia also\r\nassociates itself with the statement presented by the\r\nrepresentative of Qatar on behalf of Group of 77 and\r\nChina.\r\nToday we commemorate the tenth anniversary of\r\nthe 1994 International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD), convened in Cairo. The\r\nConference concluded with a landmark document, a\r\n20-year Programme of Action on Population and\r\nDevelopment, adopted by consensus by all\r\nparticipating countries. The Programme of Action is a\r\nvital mechanism that clearly emphasizes the links\r\nbetween population and development. It also shows\r\nhow countries should fulfil the needs of their citizens\r\nby improving their socio-economic policies.\r\nWe recall the twenty-first special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly — the five-year review of the\r\nICPD — convened by the United Nations in 1999 to\r\nreview progress made towards meeting the ICPD goals.\r\nAfter reviewing the topics highlighted in the\r\nProgramme of Action, the Assembly agreed on a new\r\nset of benchmarks in four areas: education and literacy,\r\nreproductive health care and the need for\r\ncontraception, maternal mortality reduction and\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nWe should use the occasion of the\r\ncommemoration of the tenth anniversary of ICPD to\r\nhelp and assist countries in analysing how we are\r\ndischarging our responsibilities in implementing the\r\nProgramme of Action with a view to transforming the\r\nlives of our fellow citizens. In view of next year’s\r\nplanned summit to review implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, the present meeting\r\nof commemoration should be an opportunity to\r\nexamine the contribution of the ICPD Programme of\r\nAction towards achieving those Goals.\r\nAs outlined in the UNFPA global survey on\r\nnational experiences, it is evident that many countries\r\nmay fall short of achieving the agreed goals and\r\ncommitments of the Programme of Action. That\r\nshortfall is more acute in poor and developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThe Government of the Federal Democratic\r\nRepublic of Ethiopia, cognizant of the effects of\r\npopulation pressure on the country’s economic\r\ndevelopment, adopted a national population policy in\r\n1993. Periodic reviews have been conducted every year\r\nto assess the implementation process and facilitate the\r\nexchange of experiences at the national level. The\r\nfindings of those reviews indicate that policy\r\nimplementation is lagging because of the capacity\r\nconstraints on officials at all levels. To solve that\r\nproblem, it is important to have assistance from\r\nGovernments, non-governmental organizations and\r\ninternational organizations for capacity-building\r\nprogrammes.\r\nWe believe that international development\r\npartnerships are important for successfully\r\nimplementing the ICPD Programme of Action.\r\nAlthough we understand that the successful\r\nimplementation and the achievement of the Programme\r\nof Action requires the political commitment of all\r\ncountries, the support of developed countries is a very\r\nimportant factor in complementing the efforts being\r\nundertaken by developing countries.\r\nWe also believe that developing countries should\r\nassist one another in this field by exchanging\r\nexperiences at the regional level in a spirit of South-\r\nSouth cooperation. Finally, it is our hope to see our\r\npeople with improved qualities of life by the end of\r\ntwentieth year of the Programme of Action.\r\nIn conclusion, I express my Government’s\r\nappreciation for UNFPA’s support to my country.\r\nMr. Tsereteli (Georgia): I would like to express\r\nmy gratitude to the United Nations, and in particular to\r\nthe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) —\r\nMs. Thoraya Obaid and her team — for the opportunity\r\nto participate in this high-level forum. The issues that\r\nwe have been discussing are of vital importance to all\r\nStates and nations.\r\nIn 1994, the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD) brought about a\r\nfundamental change in the current understanding of\r\npopulation issues. The Programme of Action for the\r\nnext 20 years covered specific objectives for all\r\n54\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\ncountries in the areas of health, the status of women\r\nand social development.\r\nThe Conference was especially important for\r\ncountries that emerged from the former Soviet Union.\r\nThese countries began their independent development\r\nguided by the principles of the ICPD. With regard to\r\nGeorgia, the ICPD targets have been highlighted in all\r\nour national development instruments. As noted by the\r\nSecretary-General, the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, and in particular those having to do with the\r\neradication of extreme poverty and hunger, cannot be\r\nachieved if questions of population and reproductive\r\nhealth are not addressed.\r\nIn implementing the ICPD Programme of Action,\r\nGeorgia is taking positive steps to reduce poverty and\r\nto reach the Millennium Development Goals. The\r\nassistance of donor countries and of United Nations\r\norganizations — and in particular that of UNFPA’s\r\nprogrammes — is playing a crucial role in that process.\r\nI would like to cite just one example in that regard. The\r\nabortion rate in Georgia has decreased by more than 50\r\nper cent as a result of UNFPA-supplied contraceptives\r\nover a period of 10 years. It is not just a matter of data;\r\nthere is reduced maternal mortality and morbidity\r\nbehind that figure.\r\nThe Georgian Government has prepared its\r\nICPD+10 report, highlighting the achievements\r\nattained in the past 10 years and addressing a broad\r\nrange of concerns related to population, reproductive\r\nhealth and gender equality.\r\nWhile certain achievements have been made in\r\nimplementing the ICPD Programme of Action,\r\nchallenges still remain. Georgia’s “rose revolution” has\r\nplaced new developmental challenges on the agenda.\r\nThe priorities of the new Government are poverty\r\nreduction, State capacity-building and the building of a\r\ndemocratic society. We inherited a dreadful legacy\r\nfrom the previous regime, especially in the social\r\nsector. Regrettably, the country’s financial problems\r\nand ineffective governance are reflected the most in\r\nthat field. With support from international financial\r\ninstitutions and donor organizations and by mobilizing\r\nour resources we expect to improve the overall\r\nsituation.\r\nIn that connection, our new country programme\r\nfor the period 2006-2010 is currently being prepared,\r\nin close cooperation between UNFPA and the\r\nGovernment of Georgia. That programme reflects all\r\nnational priorities with respect to both the ICPD’s\r\ngoals and the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nNon-governmental organizations and young\r\npeople are reliable partners of the Government and\r\nUNFPA in the implementation of the ICPD Programme\r\nof Action. In that regard, I would like to underline the\r\nimportance of efficient coordination vis-à-vis donor\r\nsupport and the further effective utilization of the\r\nassistance received.\r\nThe lessons learned after 10 years of\r\nimplementing the ICPD Programme of Action have\r\nshown that strategies and programmes in the coming\r\nyears should be strengthened to address all emerging\r\nchallenges. I would like to stress the need for\r\ncontinuous funding and the importance of additional\r\nresources to ensure the achievement of the ICPD’s\r\ngoals. In that respect, countries in transition require\r\nmore financial resources to overcome hardships and to\r\nmeet both the ICPD’s targets and the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Those Goals can be reached only\r\nif all countries live up to the commitment they made in\r\nCairo to deliver the necessary resources.\r\nWe might sometimes have different opinions on\r\nparticular issues, but consensus and the joining of our\r\nefforts are very much needed to achieve our main goal.\r\nGeorgia reaffirms its support for the Programme of\r\nAction and stands ready to contribute to the truly\r\nrevolutionary changes it aims at. We know how heavy\r\nthat burden is now, but I am confident that every one of\r\nus is proud of the fact that today we are doing\r\nsomething that will create a better future for the\r\ngenerations to come. I wish the General Assembly\r\nsuccess in its endeavours.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I should like to\r\ninform the General Assembly that the representative of\r\nPanama has requested to participate in this debate.\r\nAlthough the list of speakers was closed this morning,\r\nunless I hear any objection, I shall take it that the\r\nAssembly agrees to the inscription of Panama on the\r\nlist of speakers.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Arias (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): It is of\r\nsingular importance for Panama to participate in this\r\ncommemoration of the tenth anniversary of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD). Although we support the\r\nstatement made during this debate by the representative\r\n55\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nof Qatar, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, we\r\nfeel compelled to make a few specific remarks.\r\nThe Government of Panama reiterates its firm\r\ncommitment to the principles, objectives and actions\r\ncontained in the Cairo Programme of Action and the\r\ndocument that emerged from the Cairo+5 process,\r\nwhich is entitled “Key Actions for the Further\r\nImplementation of the Programme of Action of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment”. We are particularly committed to those\r\nelements as they relate to the inclusion of population\r\nand poverty issues in development policies,\r\nreproductive and health rights, gender equality and\r\nfairness and the empowerment of women. Panama\r\nexpressed that commitment through the Santiago\r\nDeclaration of the Americas, and I reaffirm it today in\r\nthe Assembly on behalf of the Government of\r\nPresident Martín Torrijos.\r\nThe Cairo Programme of Action has been a\r\nvaluable guide that has enabled us to enrich the\r\ndiscussion of national topics and to establish priority\r\npublic policies. Our Government has developed, and is\r\nnow implementing, national plans in the areas of\r\nsexual and reproductive health, equal opportunity for\r\nwomen and measures against domestic violence on the\r\nbasis of the Programme’s guidelines. Similarly, we\r\nhave adopted a public policy on young people and a\r\nnational policy for older adults.\r\nI must also point out that we in Panama are\r\nfirmly committed to reaching the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. We recognize that any programme\r\ndesigned to eradicate poverty and hunger must take\r\ninto account such population variables as gender\r\nequality and sexual and reproductive health. We are\r\ntherefore working to reduce maternal mortality rates in\r\nindigenous areas and to offer all Panamanian women\r\nprofessional birthing care and family planning services\r\nthat will allow them to determine the size of their\r\nfamilies freely and responsibly.\r\nLastly, the Government of President Torrijos has\r\nbeen attaching special importance to the issue of the\r\nhealth and development of Panama’s adolescents and\r\nyoung people by creating comprehensive health,\r\nemployment and education programmes that will place\r\nvery high priority on the prevention of HIV/AIDS and\r\nadolescent pregnancy.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express my\r\ngratitude for the commendable work done by the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund under the skilful\r\nleadership of Executive Director, Ms. Thoraya Obaid.\r\nWe therefore call on all countries with higher rates of\r\neconomic development to increase their financial\r\ncontributions in order that the Fund may continue its\r\nwork for the benefit of all humankind.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to the Observer of the Holy See.\r\nRev. Msgr. Dimaculangan (Holy See): The\r\nPermanent Observer of the Holy See would have been\r\npleased to deliver this statement himself, but a prior\r\ncommitment has kept him from being here tonight.\r\nThe theme of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD) emphasizes the\r\nreality that all proper concerns about human population\r\nare inextricably connected with the development and\r\nflourishing of every human being.\r\nAn important milestone at the ICPD was the\r\nlinkage established between migration and\r\ndevelopment that, ever since, has prompted increased\r\nsensitivity, research, cooperation and effective policies\r\nin this field. Migration is now recognized as a major\r\nchallenge for all, linked as it is to development and\r\npoverty, as well as to financial and health security. In\r\nparticular, migrants are now seen as proactive agents of\r\ndevelopment. While appreciating the proper\r\nimportance of these achievements, States now have to\r\nfocus much more on creating jobs where people live.\r\nPolitical will and firm determination are needed on the\r\npart of Governments and civil society in order to foster\r\na proper cultural, social and juridical environment\r\ncapable of overcoming the persistent phenomena of\r\ndiscrimination, violence, human trafficking and\r\nxenophobia. Migration, now more than 10 years ago,\r\nhas come to international attention because of the\r\ndemographics of the developed world.\r\nA decade ago, we were informed of United\r\nNations studies indicating that a rapid decrease in the\r\nglobal rate of population growth was expected to begin\r\nduring the 1990s and carry on into the new century. It\r\nis now a fact that population growth has declined\r\nappreciably in many of the industrialized developed\r\nnations and that this decline poses a serious threat to\r\ntheir future.\r\nThe Holy See continues to follow those matters\r\ncarefully, while encouraging accurate and objective\r\nassessments of population issues and global solidarity\r\n56\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nin regard to development strategies, especially as they\r\naffect the developing nations of the world. The Holy\r\nSee is concerned that proper attention is not always\r\ngiven to the comprehensive set of principles, including\r\nethical principles, essential in determining the right\r\nresponse to the demographic, sociological and public\r\npolicy analyses of the data on population trends.\r\nPopulation policy is only one part of an overall\r\nstrategy for the betterment of humanity. It is essential\r\nthat any discussion of population policies must\r\nsimultaneously consider the actual and projected\r\ndevelopment of the human race. All development\r\nworthy of the name must be comprehensive and cannot\r\nconsist in the simple accumulation of wealth or in a\r\ngreater availability of goods and services, but must be\r\npursued with due consideration for the social, cultural\r\nand spiritual dimensions of every human being.\r\nDevelopment programmes must respect the cultural\r\nheritage of peoples and nations, foster structures of\r\nparticipation and shared responsibility, and empower\r\nour human capacity, so that each one of us can become\r\nthe person that he or she was created to be.\r\nIt would therefore be wiser if focus were placed\r\nupon the formulation of population policies that\r\npromote a responsible kind of personal liberty, instead\r\nof one that is too narrowly defined.\r\nFrom this, it follows, among other things, that the\r\nduty to safeguard the family demands that special\r\nattention be given to securing, for husbands and wives,\r\nthe liberty to decide responsibly, free from all social or\r\nlegal coercion, on the number of children they will\r\nhave and the spacing of their births. It should be the\r\nintent of Governments and other agencies to help\r\ncreate the social conditions that will enable couples\r\nthemselves to make appropriate decisions in the light\r\nof their responsibilities. We know that responsible\r\nparenthood is not a question of unlimited procreation\r\nor lack of awareness of what is involved in rearing\r\nchildren, but also involves the right of parents to use\r\ntheir liberty wisely. That is why, along these lines,\r\ncouples that choose to have large families also deserve\r\nto be supported.\r\nThe seriousness of the challenges that\r\nGovernments and, above all, parents must face in the\r\neducation of the younger generation means that we\r\ncannot abdicate our responsibility to lead young people\r\nto a deeper understanding of their own dignity and\r\npotentiality as persons. It remains our task to challenge\r\nthem with a demanding ethic that fully respects their\r\ndignity and that leads them to the wisdom that is\r\nneeded in order to face the many demands of life.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In accordance\r\nwith General Assembly resolution 57/29 of\r\n19 November 2002, I now call on the Observer for\r\nPartners in Population and Development.\r\nMr. Singh (Partners in Population and\r\nDevelopment): Thank you very much, Mr. President,\r\nfor giving me this opportunity to make a few brief\r\ncomments on behalf of the Partners in Population and\r\nDevelopment. The Partners in Population and\r\nDevelopment is an intergovernmental alliance of 20\r\ndeveloping countries dedicated to the promotion of\r\nSouth-South cooperation on population and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nHaving heard the statements that were delivered\r\ntoday, we note quite a few accomplishments during the\r\n10 years that have passed since the 1994 International\r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD).\r\nWe are pleased that during these 10 years the broad\r\nconcept of reproductive health has been incorporated\r\nby an increasing number of Governments in their\r\nprimary health care management, delivery and outreach\r\nprogrammes.\r\nHowever, more than 120 million couples still lack\r\naccess to reproductive health commodities and services\r\nand commodity security remains an urgent issue,\r\nparticularly in poor countries in Africa and other parts\r\nof the world. HIV/AIDS rages now as a pandemic, and\r\nalthough almost $5 billion are being provided annually\r\nby donors for the prevention and treatment of\r\nHIV/AIDS, this amount is less than half of the amount\r\nneeded.\r\nAlso, the parallel functioning of family planning\r\nand HIV/AIDS programmes in many countries has not\r\nalways been very effective in ensuring that\r\ncommodities and services are delivered to all those\r\nwho need them most. Although gains have been made\r\nin reducing infant and child mortality, maternal\r\nmortality in global terms remains, sadly, at the same\r\nlevel as 10 years ago and has grown even worse in war-\r\nravaged countries. Education, particularly for girls, has\r\nnot yet been fully achieved, and while progress has\r\nbeen made towards reducing the incidence of female\r\ngenital mutilation and more public attention is being\r\ngiven to domestic violence against women, the\r\nempowerment of women remains a distant goal in\r\n57\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\nmany areas of economic and social development.\r\nAdolescents and youth also need much greater\r\nattention than has been given to them so far.\r\nSo, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of\r\nICPD, as most speakers have said, we need to\r\nrededicate ourselves to the earliest possible\r\nachievement of the goals and objectives of the ICPD\r\nProgramme of Action and to find ways and means to\r\nresolve the problems and difficulties encountered in\r\nreaching those goals and objectives, within the overall\r\nframework of the MDGs.\r\nIn that context, in cooperation with the\r\nGovernment of China, my organization organized a\r\nmajor meeting in Wuhan, China, only a few weeks ago.\r\nThe results of that meeting have already been\r\nsummarized by the representative of China in his\r\npresentation. I will not repeat his words, but I want to\r\npoint out that the declaration adopted by that meeting\r\nreaffirms the commitment of the participants to the\r\nICPD Programme of Action as one of the major,\r\nstrategic directions for attaining the MDGs. Thus, the\r\nlink between the ICPD goals and the MDGs were fully\r\nemphasized. The declaration further calls upon\r\nGovernments and international agencies to take all\r\npossible steps to more fully integrate sexual and\r\nreproductive health and HIV/AIDS programmes —\r\nparticularly those targeting measures to prevent the\r\nfurther spread of HIV infections — into their\r\ndevelopment plans.\r\nThe World Leaders Statement, signed by over 250\r\nleaders and presented yesterday to the Deputy\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, will certainly\r\nhelp to refocus world attention on the importance and\r\nurgency of population and development issues.\r\nAt the same time, it is necessary to note that it is\r\nprimarily at the country level that Governments and\r\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs) must clarify\r\nand strengthen the linkages between the attainment of\r\nthe ICPD goals and the Millennium Goals. The reports\r\nprovided by countries on the implementation of the\r\nMDGs must also indicate how they see those linkages\r\nand how they implement them. For example, the\r\ncountry report on the implementation of the MDGs in\r\nChina, prepared by the United Nations country team,\r\nclearly incorporates reproductive health indicators. I\r\nhope similar reports will be submitted by other\r\ncountries. That will strengthen the efforts undertaken\r\nby the United Nations Population Fund, the World\r\nHealth Organization and other international\r\norganizations to give adequate attention to\r\nreproductive health and population issues, in the\r\npreparations for the five-year review conference on the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nAdequate resource mobilization, at both the\r\ndomestic and the international levels, is essential to the\r\nachievement of the ICPD goals, in the context of the\r\nMillennium Goals. Reports indicate that the efforts\r\nundertaken by donors to reach the ICPD cost estimates\r\nfor the years 2000 and 2005 are nowhere near the\r\nmark. Without a much greater mobilization of\r\nadditional resources, there will be very little prospect\r\nof fully realizing the ICPD goals, particularly those\r\nrelating to the provision of family planning and\r\nreproductive health services.\r\nI would like to conclude by emphasizing the\r\nimportance of South-South collaboration as providing a\r\ncost-effective and efficient modality for the promotion\r\nand implementation of ICPD goals. Several of the\r\nprevious speakers talked about this, but I just want to\r\ndraw attention to this approach that will help\r\ndeveloping countries to help themselves by providing\r\ntraining, exchange of information, research\r\npossibilities and commodity security — of course,\r\nwhile continuing to raise resources from other sources.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In accordance\r\nwith General Assembly resolution 47/4 of 16 October\r\n1992, I now give the floor to the Observer for the\r\nInternational Organization for Migration.\r\nMr. Dall’Oglio (International Organization for\r\nMigration): In 1994, at the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, the\r\ninternational community sought for the first time to\r\ndevelop a comprehensive blueprint for managing\r\nmigration. Chapter X of the ICPD Programme of\r\nAction mapped out a series of policy directions\r\ncovering, inter alia, the development of orderly\r\nmigration programmes, the prevention of trafficking in\r\nmigrants, the reduction of irregular and undocumented\r\nmigration, better protection for internally displaced\r\npersons and refugees, the promotion of the\r\ndevelopment potential of migration and the need for\r\ncooperation between countries in successfully and\r\ncomprehensively managing migration.\r\nMuch progress has been made since Cairo to\r\ntranslate this agenda into action, in what has become\r\nan extremely dynamic migration environment. In the\r\n58\r\nA/59/PV.31\r\ninterim, in fact, the number of international migrants\r\nworldwide has increased by some 50 million, their\r\nyearly remittances sent back home have multiplied to\r\nover $100 billion and the average annual flow of\r\nmigrants from less developed countries to more\r\ndeveloped regions has doubled. In that rapidly\r\nchanging migration landscape, new social and\r\ninstitutional actors have emerged, adding fresh\r\nperspectives and original viewpoints. A growing and\r\nmore articulated diaspora has come forward in\r\ncountries of immigration, representing a new\r\nconstituency, voicing their concerns and, at times,\r\nchallenging the status quo both in their host societies\r\nand in countries of origin alike.\r\nIn sum, while many of the objectives set forth a\r\ndecade ago in Cairo remain the goals of today, our\r\ncollective appreciation for their relevance and\r\ncomplexity has increased and sharpened, along with a\r\nprevailing recognition that migration is an essential,\r\ninevitable and potentially beneficial component of the\r\neconomic and social life of every State and every\r\nregion. Far from being a fatalistic approach to global\r\ndemographic trends, that realization has stimulated a\r\ncall for policy developments to channel migration into\r\nsafe, humane, socially cohesive and productive\r\navenues that benefit both individuals and societies.\r\nIndeed, one of the most significant indicators of\r\nprogress since Cairo has been the development of\r\nregional consultative frameworks to discuss migration\r\nissues in a cooperative manner on every continent.\r\nThose processes are now a firmly established feature of\r\nthe international migration scene — a multiplicity of\r\nconsultative circles, both large and small, with broad or\r\nsectoral agendas, in accordance with regional\r\npriorities.\r\nTurning from the regional to the global level, new\r\ninitiatives have also similarly evolved to foster\r\nmultilateral dialogue and cooperation, among others:\r\nthe Berne Initiative, a consultative, intergovernmental\r\nprocess intended to develop a non-binding policy\r\nframework for the management of migration; the\r\nInternational Organization for Migration’s (IOM) own\r\nInternational Dialogue on Migration, which brings\r\ntogether more than 130 States and additional partners\r\nin the IOM Council to create better understanding and\r\ncooperation in the management of migration; and the\r\nrecently set up Global Commission on International\r\nMigration, which next year is to present its\r\nrecommendations on concrete modalities to further\r\nglobal migration governance to the Secretary-General\r\nand other concerned stakeholders. The high-level\r\ndialogue scheduled for the sixtieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in 2006 will provide an additional\r\nimportant avenue for concerted action.\r\nAdmittedly, for many countries, migration is a\r\nnew administrative field. Migration systems to track,\r\nprocess and ease inward and outward movements of\r\npeople, as well as to facilitate their residence and\r\nintegration, are still weak in many countries. Limited\r\ncapacities affect both developing and developed\r\ncountries and pose significant challenges to effective\r\npolicy formulation and implementation. Often, the\r\nlinkages among public administration disciplines such\r\nas trade, health, development cooperation, labour and\r\nhome affairs have been weak or incoherent.\r\nFor those on the move or those planning to\r\nmigrate, the delays and inconsistencies in migration\r\nsystems may well put their lives at risk, as they\r\nconsign themselves to the hands of smugglers in\r\nattempts to gain entry through irregular channels. For\r\nthe millions living in fear of public institutions because\r\nof their undocumented status, social marginalization,\r\nsegregation and alienation have become a fact of life.\r\nFor that reason, the development of national capacities\r\nto manage migratory flows remains as relevant and\r\npressing as it was 10 years ago in Cairo.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): We have heard\r\nthe last speaker in commemoration of the tenth\r\nanniversary of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this\r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 45.\r\nThe meeting rose at 9.05 p.m.\r\n"
