(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda items 38 and 46\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress\r\nin implementation and international support\r\n(a) New Partnership for Africa’s Development:\r\nprogress in implementation and international\r\nsupport\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/59/206)\r\n(b) Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/59/285)\r\n2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in\r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/59/261)\r\nMembers will recall that on Wednesday,\r\n13 October 2004, in preparation for the consideration\r\nof item 38, “New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment”, the Under-Secretary-General and\r\nSpecial Adviser on Africa, Mr. Ibrahim Gambari, gave\r\na briefing on this subject at the second informal\r\nmeeting of the General Committee, which was open to\r\nall Member States.\r\nI should now like to make a statement in the\r\ncontext of the joint debate.\r\nThe items under consideration in the present joint\r\ndebate attest to the importance that the General\r\nAssembly attaches to the special needs of Africa, a\r\nmatter which is one of the main priorities on the United\r\nNations agenda. The reports of the Secretary-General\r\nprovide a clear account of the situation prevailing\r\ntoday in Africa. They describe the progress achieved\r\nand set out the obstacles that remain with respect to the\r\nimplementation of the commitments undertaken in\r\nfavour of Africa, in particular in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and in the United Nations Declaration on\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD).\r\nTurning first to agenda item 38, on NEPAD, I\r\nwelcome the fact that the Secretary-General has\r\nhighlighted the progress achieved by African countries\r\nthemselves in promoting peace and security and in\r\nimplementing the priority programmes and projects of\r\nNEPAD at the socio-economic level. That progress\r\nattests to the determination of African leaders and\r\nAfrican peoples to take charge of their destiny. At the\r\ncontinental, subregional and national levels, further\r\nevidence of that resolve is seen in the formulation of\r\npolicies; the establishment within the African Union of\r\nappropriate institutional mechanisms such as the Peace\r\nand Security Council and the Economic, Social and\r\nCultural Council, as well as the African Peer Review\r\nMechanism — to which 23 African countries have\r\nalready voluntarily subscribed; the preparation of\r\nprojects and programmes; and the promotion of good\r\ngovernance, human rights and democracy.\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nIt is particularly encouraging to note that today\r\nthe combination of all of those efforts has begun to\r\nyield results by helping to bring about a significant\r\nreduction in the level of crises and armed conflicts that\r\nhave been ravaging the continent. In that respect,\r\ncooperation among the United Nations, the African\r\nUnion and African subregional organizations, aimed at\r\npreventing and resolving conflict and at maintaining\r\npeace deserve to be welcomed.\r\nThere is, however, a need to step up our efforts in\r\nthe area of peace-building and post-conflict\r\nreconstruction, particularly in the context of regional\r\ninitiatives, which should always, whenever necessary,\r\nreceive vital support from the international community\r\nin the context of the collective security prescribed by\r\nthe Charter.\r\nIn the current context, the goodwill of Africa and\r\nthe mobilization of its internal resources will not alone\r\nsuffice to bring about the recovery of the continent that\r\nwe all wish to see.\r\nThe pernicious effects of globalization; the brain\r\ndrain; the persistence of AIDS, malaria and other\r\nendemic diseases; the technology gap; the debt burden;\r\nand the shortfall of official development assistance:\r\nthose are all obstacles that remain to be overcome.\r\nIt is true that Africa is benefiting from the\r\nconcern of the international community, in particular\r\nthe United Nations system and its other multilateral\r\nand bilateral partners. Here, I would like to pay tribute\r\nto the Secretary-General for having set up a high-level\r\nAdvisory Panel on International Support for NEPAD;\r\nin that regard, I welcome the endeavours of the Office\r\nof the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on\r\nAfrica. Nonetheless, it is generally accepted that\r\nmeaningful improvement in the situation on the\r\ncontinent requires intensified mobilization at all levels,\r\ngreater policy coherence, better coordination of\r\nactivities and, above all, a substantial allocation of\r\nadditional resources for the financing of Africa’s\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAfrica, which has given so much to the rest of the\r\nworld, now needs its support.\r\nWith regard to agenda item 46, the note by the\r\nSecretary-General entitled “2001-2010: Decade to Roll\r\nBack Malaria in Developing Countries, particularly in\r\nAfrica” (A/59/261) reminds us that many challenges\r\nremain to be overcome. The scourge of malaria today\r\nthreatens 40 per cent of the world’s population and\r\nevery year is responsible for approximately 3 million\r\ndeaths around the world, 1 million of them in Africa.\r\nEfforts to curb that phenomenon absorb significant\r\nfinancial resources, and scientific advances in the\r\nsearch for an anti-malaria vaccine, although promising,\r\nremain slow.\r\nThe General Assembly has asked the\r\ninternational community to continue to support those\r\norganizations that are cooperating in the effort to roll\r\nback malaria. In that regard, the World Health\r\nOrganization (WHO) and the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund are sources of major assistance in\r\nsupplementing the efforts being made by the countries\r\nwhere malaria does so much harm.\r\nThe General Assembly has also urged the\r\npharmaceutical industry to be aware of the growing\r\ndemand for effective combination treatment for\r\nmalaria, particularly in Africa, and to establish new\r\nalliances and partnerships so as to ensure that all\r\npeople at risk have prompt access to effective,\r\naffordable and high-quality treatment. Programmes\r\nsuch as the “Roll Back Malaria” initiative, which took\r\nshape at the Summit of heads of State or Government\r\nof the Organization of African Unity held in Abuja in\r\nApril 2000, also made it possible to move towards\r\nimproved treatment and more effective malaria\r\nprevention in Africa. Significant progress has also been\r\nmade with the adoption of national strategic plans by a\r\nnumber of African countries with a view to achieving\r\nthe goals set at Abuja.\r\nSince 2002, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria has become a source of\r\nadditional financing to combat the scourge of malaria.\r\nHowever, further efforts are needed in order to\r\nmobilize further necessary resources in that regard.\r\nThe General Assembly must be ready to mobilize to\r\nensure that all efforts to combat malaria can be\r\nsuccessful. It will have to play its role as a global\r\nforum in the struggle against that pandemic — which\r\nforms part of our fight against poverty. It will continue\r\nto promote human development so as to ensure, to echo\r\nthe objective of WHO, “the attainment by all peoples\r\nof the highest possible level of health”.\r\nMalaria and underdevelopment are not inevitable;\r\nwe can and must overcome them.\r\nMr. Esan (Nigeria): It is reassuring to see you,\r\nSir, presiding over this debate on agenda items\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nrelating, respectively, to the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) and causes of conflict\r\nin Africa and to the issue of malaria.\r\nI have the honour to make this statement on\r\nbehalf of the African Union on issues that are vital to\r\nus.\r\nIn his report contained in document A/59/285, the\r\nSecretary-General noted the decrease in the number of\r\nAfrican countries that are in either armed conflict or\r\npolitical turmoil. That assessment is a true reflection of\r\nthe tremendous efforts that African Governments have\r\ncontinued to make to promote peace and security on\r\nthe continent. It is quite understandable that our leaders\r\nremain seized of that issue, as it is generally accepted\r\nthat the greatest challenge facing Africa is that of\r\nmaintaining peace and stability — or, rather, that of\r\ncontaining or resolving conflicts. That is one challenge\r\nthat we are confronting with uncompromising resolve,\r\nbecause we can ill afford to waste scarce resources on\r\nconflicts.\r\nKnowing that no meaningful development can\r\ntake place without internal peace and security, African\r\nleaders have redoubled their efforts in that regard. It is\r\ngratifying that the report of the Secretary-General\r\nacknowledges that fact, depicting concretely the peace-\r\nbuilding efforts being deployed at both the subregional\r\nand the continental levels. Prominent among those\r\nefforts was last May’s launching of the Peace and\r\nSecurity Council of the African Union, which was a\r\nhistoric and auspicious development that the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General rightly mentioned. Major\r\noperations have been launched since the establishment\r\nof the Council, notably the deployment of a peace\r\noperation in Burundi and an African observer mission\r\nin the Sudan.\r\nIt is also pertinent to refer to the wisdom of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1564 (2004), of\r\n18 September 2004, whereby the Council, inter alia,\r\npledged support for the African Union in its resolve to\r\nenhance its presence in Darfur. We urge the United\r\nNations and the international community as a whole to\r\ndemonstrate their support in a concrete manner.\r\nAfrica wants the decreasing trend in the number\r\nof conflicts to be sustained, in order that we may focus\r\non development challenges. It is for that reason that we\r\ncondemn, in the strongest terms, the foiled mercenary\r\nplot to destabilize the Government of Equatorial\r\nGuinea. We hope that the General Assembly will\r\nsupport the draft resolution that the African Group of\r\nStates intends to introduce on the question of the\r\nrecruitment, use, financing and training of mercenaries.\r\nWe believe that finding a durable solution to\r\nconflicts in Africa demands appropriate support from\r\nthe international community. In that regard, we are\r\npleased to acknowledge the contributions being made\r\nby the United Nations and the international community\r\nas a whole. Indeed, an active and meaningful\r\npartnership between Africa and the international\r\ncommunity for the promotion of peace and security is\r\nimperative. In that connection, we believe that the\r\nclose cooperation among the Security Council, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the General\r\nAssembly demonstrated in their handling of the crisis\r\nin Guinea-Bissau and Burundi was splendid.\r\nGiven the paucity of resources in Africa, there is\r\na justifiable need for increased external support, not\r\nonly to complement and strengthen the continent’s\r\nefforts to promote peace and security but also to\r\npreserve the considerable peace dividends that have\r\nalready been gained. If Africa were therefore to\r\nstrengthen peace and pursue the path of sustainable\r\ndevelopment, the Peace and Security Council of the\r\nAfrican Union would need to be strengthened in order\r\nto fulfil its mandate. That would require substantial\r\nsupport from the United Nations, as well as\r\ninstitutional coherence between the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council and the African Union on issues of\r\nconflict in Africa. We therefore urge the General\r\nAssembly to take that into account during this session\r\nin its review of the cooperation agreement between the\r\nUnited Nations and the African Union. We welcome\r\nthe indication given by the Secretary-General that he\r\nwould instruct relevant agencies, departments and\r\noffices to look into new ways for the United Nations\r\nand the African Union to cooperate.\r\nThe significant gains made thus far in promoting\r\npeace and security in Africa must not be taken for\r\ngranted. There is still an urgent need to take\r\ncorresponding steps to promote the economic and\r\nsocial well-being of people, in order that conflicts do\r\nnot feed further on the scourge of underdevelopment\r\nand poverty. In that connection, we reiterate that Africa\r\nhas within its grasp a strategic blueprint that can enable\r\nit to restore peace and security, combat widespread\r\npoverty, accelerate growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment and reverse its marginalization in a\r\nglobalized world.\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nDesigned to promote holistic and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) is Africa’s home-grown\r\ndevelopment framework; it is a little over three years\r\nold. Considering the potential of NEPAD in reshaping\r\nAfrica’s economic fortunes, it is imperative that we\r\nembrace any opportunity that presents itself to review\r\nthe implementation of the initiative. We are therefore\r\npleased to participate in this debate.\r\nIndeed, it is also of interest to note that a NEPAD\r\nmulti-stakeholder dialogue will take place in a few\r\ndays’ time in Johannesburg. The purpose of the\r\ndialogue is to enable African leaders, development\r\npartners, civil society organizations — including non-\r\ngovernmental organizations — and other stakeholders\r\nto review three years of NEPAD implementation and\r\nexplore ways to mobilize domestic and external\r\nresources to expedite the implementation of NEPAD\r\npriority programmes and projects.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General contained in\r\ndocument A/59/206 is quite helpful in appreciating the\r\nprogress that has been made in the implementation of\r\nNEPAD. It is indeed gratifying to note that the report\r\nacknowledges the efforts being made by African\r\nGovernments and regional economic communities in\r\nthat regard, particularly in terms of “developing\r\nsectoral policy frameworks, implementing specific\r\nprogrammes and projects and establishing targets for\r\nexpenditure on selected NEPAD sectoral priorities.”\r\n(A/59/206, para. 3)\r\nThe report highlights a number of flagship\r\nprogrammes and projects of significant interest to\r\nAfrican countries. The infrastructure projects being\r\nproposed, largely having to do with transport and\r\nenergy, are expected not only to enhance Africa’s\r\ncompetitiveness but also to deepen its economic\r\nintegration. Another example of a flagship programme\r\nis the NEPAD e-schools project, which has received\r\nthe endorsement of the Heads of State and Government\r\nImplementation Committee on the basis of an\r\nappreciation of the need to ensure that Africa is not left\r\nbehind in a global economy driven by information and\r\ncommunications technology. Similarly, the\r\nComprehensive Africa Agriculture Development\r\nProgramme enjoys support in the highest echelons of\r\nGovernment because it is predicated on the fact that\r\nwithin NEPAD agriculture is expected to spearhead\r\neconomic growth in Africa’s quest for a continent free\r\nof conflict in which people can participate effectively\r\nin economic activity.\r\nThe foregoing and other initiatives provide the\r\nbasis for us to say that NEPAD has taken off. But we\r\nwould like to emphasize that we are still at the\r\nbeginning of a long journey. The international\r\ncommunity should therefore not lose sight of the\r\nmagnitude of development support and investment\r\nneeded to put the continent on track to achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, especially the goal of\r\nreducing poverty and hunger by half by the year 2015.\r\nWe appreciate the support rendered by various\r\npartners to African countries in the implementation of\r\nNEPAD, including that of the United Nations system.\r\nThat is in keeping with the principle and spirit of\r\npartnership underlying the programme, of which the\r\nGroup of Eight (G-8) Africa Action Plan, the Blair\r\nCommission for Africa, the Millennium Challenge\r\nAccount and the African Partnership Forum are\r\nnoteworthy examples. We also welcome the support\r\nthat international financial institutions, including the\r\nAfrican Development Bank and the World Bank, have\r\ngiven to NEPAD thus far. It is our hope that that\r\nsupport will be reinforced. It is also our hope that the\r\ndialogue between the G-8 and Africa, which has\r\nproved to be a useful mechanism for cooperation, will\r\nbe sustained and will be translated into much-needed\r\nresource inflows for Africa’s development.\r\nFurthermore, we believe that the United Nations,\r\nincluding its funds, programmes and specialized\r\nagencies, is well placed to contribute to the accelerated\r\nimplementation of NEPAD programmes. But the level\r\nof resources cited in the Secretary-General’s report\r\npoints to the need for the United Nations system to\r\nsubstantially increase its support, particularly in the\r\narea of capacity-building, in which African countries\r\nand regional economic communities suffer serious\r\nconstraints. We look forward to seeing the various\r\nUnited Nations bodies not only aligning their programs\r\nwith the priorities of NEPAD but also creating NEPAD\r\ndesks for that purpose. We expect that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Advisory Panel on International Support for\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development will\r\naddress those issues, among other matters.\r\nWe would also like to acknowledge the role being\r\nplayed by the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa\r\nin advocating and coordinating international support\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nfor Africa. It is essential that the Office be given the\r\nsupport that it needs to carry out its responsibilities.\r\nIn making the case for increased external\r\nassistance for NEPAD, we would especially like to\r\nmention certain major efforts by African Governments.\r\nFor instance, a number of reforms aimed at\r\ntransforming African economies have been embarked\r\nupon, with generally positive results. Those reforms\r\ninclude privatization, commercialization programmes,\r\npublic service reforms, numerous initiatives to promote\r\ndemocracy, the rule of law, accountability and\r\ntransparency and a vigorous campaign to combat\r\ncorruption.\r\nWe would also like to draw attention to the\r\nsatisfactory progress made in implementing the African\r\nPeer Review Mechanism. As a novel voluntary\r\ncommitment, the Mechanism, in the words of its\r\nfounding documents, is intended to foster\r\n“the adoption of policies, standards and practices\r\nthat lead to political stability, high economic\r\ngrowth, sustainable development and accelerated\r\nsubregional and continental economic integration\r\nthrough sharing of experiences and reinforcement\r\nof successful and best practice, including\r\nidentifying deficiencies and assessing the needs\r\nof capacity-building”.\r\nSo popular has the Mechanism become that five\r\nmore countries came on board last July, bringing to 23\r\nthe total number that have joined the Mechanism. As\r\nmore countries sign on to the Mechanism, Africa will\r\nbecome the first region of the world to engage in self-\r\nevaluation on some basic tenets of governance. That\r\nAfrica means business in that regard is obvious from\r\nthe fact that the review process has commenced with\r\napproximately four countries.\r\nI would also like to underline the significant\r\neffort of African Governments to address the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, and to promote the Roll Back\r\nMalaria Partnership and the campaign to curb other\r\nkiller diseases in Africa. To confront this disturbing\r\nsituation, many Governments in Africa have made\r\nbudgetary commitments to allocate 15 per cent of their\r\nnational budgets to the health sector. In addition, the\r\nThird Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African\r\nUnion, held in Addis Ababa in July 2004, adopted a\r\ndecision on the implementation of the Abuja and\r\nMaputo Declarations on Malaria, HIV/AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Other Related Infectious Disease.\r\nHere, it is important to note the innovative\r\nrecommendations contained in the report of the Special\r\nSession of the African Union Conference of African\r\nMinisters of Health, held in Geneva on 14 and 15 May\r\n2004.\r\nWe call on the international community to\r\nsupport Africa’s initiatives by making available\r\nincreased and predictable resources for financing and\r\nupgrading Africa’s health system. In particular, we\r\nadvocate substantial support for the Global Fund to\r\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and for the\r\nGlobal Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization. We\r\nalso welcome the opportunity to gain access to funds\r\nthrough the proposed international finance facility and\r\nthe European Development Fund to combat HIV/AIDS,\r\nmalaria, tuberculosis and other communicable diseases.\r\nAgainst the background of those efforts by\r\nAfrican Governments, there is clearly a need for the\r\ninternational community to demonstrate much greater\r\nsupport for NEPAD. In that regard, adequate financial\r\nresources are required in addition to capacity-building.\r\nAlthough the decision taken by the Group of Eight (G-\r\n8) at its Sea Island Summit last June to extend the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative\r\nuntil December 2006 is quite welcome, we would also\r\nlike to state that we share the Secretary-General’s view\r\nthat that measure is far from sufficient to meet the\r\nobjective of finding a more durable solution to the debt\r\ncrisis. The debt situation of the low- and middle-\r\nincome countries not covered by the HIPC initiative\r\nalso needs to be addressed.\r\nMoreover, we would like to see more coherence\r\nand consistency in global policies — particularly in the\r\nareas of trade and finance — as they affect Africa. For\r\nexample, the Secretary-General’s report draws\r\nattention to the correlation between net official\r\ndevelopment assistance and Africa’s debt service.\r\nTrends indicate that capital inflows through official\r\ndevelopment assistance are almost equivalent to\r\noutflows in terms of debt servicing. That warrants\r\ngreater coherence in global policies.\r\nWe also believe that market access for African\r\ngoods and services and the removal of agricultural\r\nsubsidies and other harmful barriers are areas in which\r\naction could be taken to assist Africa. Increased\r\nofficial development assistance and foreign direct\r\ninvestment would also provide much-needed resources\r\nto fill existing resource gaps in African countries, the\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nmajority of which are least developed countries. We\r\nwish to reiterate the call on the developed countries in\r\nparticular to deliver on their official development\r\nassistance commitments, which they reaffirmed at the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, held in Monterrey, and at the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, held in\r\nJohannesburg.\r\nAbove all, we believe that it is appropriate for our\r\ndevelopment partners to take stock of their\r\nperformance in fulfilling their commitments to Africa\r\nunder NEPAD. In particular, we call on the G-8\r\ncountries to give practical effect to the Kananaskis\r\nAfrica Action Plan. It is time that our development\r\npartners moved the focus of their support from studies\r\nand conferences to the actual implementation of\r\nprogrammes and backed their promises of resource\r\nsupport with concrete action.\r\nFinally, a positive impact on African economies\r\ncould be made through strong support for our\r\nGovernments’ efforts to fight against corruption. We\r\nbelieve that the United Nations Convention against\r\nCorruption provides a basis for national and\r\ninternational financial institutions to deny safe haven\r\nto funds looted from Africa and to cooperate fully in\r\nrepatriating such funds and assets as a contribution to\r\nthe continent’s accelerated growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. African Governments are resolutely\r\ncommitted to giving NEPAD their best shot. All they\r\nare asking for is a commensurate contribution to\r\ncomplement those efforts in the true spirit of\r\npartnership and mutual interdependence.\r\nMr. van den Berg (Netherlands): I have the\r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The\r\ncandidate countries Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and\r\nTurkey, the countries of the Stabilization and\r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Albania,\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro and\r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the\r\nEuropean Free Trade Association country Iceland,\r\nmember of the European Economic Area, align\r\nthemselves with this statement. I will not read out the\r\nstatement in its entirety, but the full text will be made\r\navailable to delegations.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the fact that, for\r\nthe second time, the sub-items “New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development: progress in implementation and\r\ninternational support” and “Causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa” are being addressed together.\r\nThat highlights once again the fact that peace, security\r\nand stability, as well as political and economic good\r\ngovernance and respect for human rights, are closely\r\ninterrelated with development.\r\nIt is precisely because of those linkages that the\r\nEuropean Union is of the opinion that the 2005 high-\r\nlevel event should address all aspects of the\r\nMillennium Declaration — that is, development and\r\nnon-development issues, as well as reform — in a\r\ncomprehensive and balanced manner. The European\r\nUnion views our debate here today as a step in that\r\ndirection.\r\nFrom the start, the European Union has strongly\r\nsupported the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), and it will continue to do so.\r\nWe fully endorse the vision on which NEPAD is based:\r\na partnership between developed countries and African\r\nnations, based on African ownership and leadership.\r\nThe European Union recognizes the need for a focus on\r\ncoherence and development in our overall policies.\r\nActing together in the spirit of NEPAD, we can jointly\r\ncontribute to progress in meeting the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals in Africa.\r\nAfrica is at the heart of the European Union’s\r\ndevelopment policy, and rightly so. Africa has great\r\npotential, as reflected in its people and culture and in\r\nthe economic and political successes of the past\r\ndecade. But Africa also has its continuing problems.\r\nHalf the population lives on less than $1 a day. The\r\nproliferation of armed conflicts, corruption, failing\r\nStates, a lack of economic development, inadequate\r\nsocial infrastructure, poor educational standards,\r\nenvironmental degradation and the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic are lowering the standard of living in that\r\npart of the world.\r\nThe European Union, the largest provider of\r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) and the single\r\nbiggest investor in developing countries, is fully aware\r\nthat development policies will not be sustainable if\r\ndeveloping economies are not part of the world\r\neconomy. We therefore decided in 2001 to introduce\r\nthe Everything but Arms initiative amending the\r\nGeneralized System of Preferences, which provides\r\nexporters from the least developed countries with free\r\nmarket access for all their products. By 2008, Regional\r\nEconomic Partnership Agreements with four African,\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nCaribbean and Pacific States (ACP) regions in Africa\r\nwill enter into force, promoting regional integration\r\nand a comprehensive approach to tackling barriers to\r\ntrade and attracting investors. Together with our\r\nfinancial assistance, we strongly believe that this will\r\ncontribute to an enabling environment for economic\r\ngrowth.\r\nThe EU will continue to make constructive\r\nefforts to ensure the implementation of the Doha\r\nDevelopment Agenda, which places the needs and\r\ninterests of developing countries at the heart of trade\r\nnegotiations. The deadlock since the failure of the\r\nCancún Conference in 2003 has been broken, and the\r\nnegotiations are back on track. We hope that this round\r\ncan be successfully concluded, now that a formal\r\nframework for reform has been established. In July,\r\nagreement was also reached regarding the cotton\r\nsector, which is crucial for several African countries.\r\nCotton will become part of the agriculture negotiations.\r\nThe EU, for its part, has already abolished all export\r\nsubsidies and tariffs and has undertaken a fundamental\r\nreform of its cotton subsidies, eliminating the support\r\nthat most distorts trade.\r\nInternational and national efforts to create an\r\nenabling environment for an equitable and sustainable\r\ndevelopment must go hand in hand. We also realize\r\nthat economic growth, although a prerequisite for\r\npoverty reduction, is not enough in itself. The primary\r\nresponsibility for poverty reduction lies with the\r\ndeveloping countries themselves. At the national level,\r\ngood governance, policy reform, prioritizing social\r\nneeds and prevention of conflicts are essential. In the\r\nspirit of the Millennium Declaration and the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), the\r\neradication of extreme poverty will be impossible,\r\nunless it is coupled with a stronger commitment to\r\nbuilding and strengthening democratic institutions,\r\nrespect and promotion of human rights and the rule of\r\nlaw, and effective and equitable delivery of public\r\nservices.\r\nIn this regard, the African Peer Review\r\nMechanism (APRM) is an extremely powerful and\r\npositive tool for improving governance in Africa. The\r\nEU commends the 23 countries that have so far agreed\r\nto join the APRM and those four countries in which the\r\nreview process has already been launched. The EU\r\nencourages other African countries to join the APRM.\r\nWe are committed to supporting the APRM in the spirit\r\nof partnership and with full respect for African\r\nownership of the process.\r\nCivil society organizations can also play an\r\nimportant role in articulating citizens’ interests and\r\ndefending their rights, mediating between citizen and\r\nthe State, and mobilizing communities and grassroots\r\norganizations. It is also important to increase the\r\nparticipation of women in political life.\r\nParticipation of the private sector is also crucial\r\nto making the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) a success. A flourishing private\r\nsector is crucial to bringing about economic, social and\r\nenvironmental prosperity for Africa. The EU therefore\r\nbelieves that proper institutions and regulations, a\r\ndifferent trade regime, improved infrastructure and a\r\nbetter banking system could boost the investment\r\nclimate in African countries.\r\nThe EU stands ready to assist with its\r\ncommitment to ODA and debt relief. Resolving\r\nAfrica’s external debt problem is critical for the\r\nsustainable development of the African countries. In\r\nthe framework of the extended Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries (HIPC) Debt Initiative, the EU remains\r\ncommitted to ensuring that eligible countries can reach\r\nand maintain a sustainable level of debt, which helps\r\nthem reinforce their efforts to reduce poverty and\r\npromote growth. We welcome the extension of the\r\nsunset clause of the HIPC Initiative through the end of\r\n2006, basing eligibility on the data from the end of\r\n2004.\r\nAs far as ODA is concerned, the European\r\nCouncil reiterated, in Brussels, in June 2004, that the\r\nEU would intensify its efforts to fulfil the\r\ncommitments undertaken in Monterrey, including\r\nthrough the exploration of innovative sources of\r\nfinancing. The EU is very much on track in increasing\r\nits ODA to 0.39 per cent of gross national incomes\r\n(GNI) in 2006, as part of longer-term efforts to raise\r\nODA contributions to 0.7 per cent of GNIs. The EU\r\nand its member States are already providing almost\r\nhalf of all current development assistance to Africa.\r\nThe EU has also significantly increased funds to\r\nfight malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis over the past\r\nfew years. These diseases take a heavy toll in Africa,\r\ncausing a tremendous loss in economic production and\r\ngrowth, having a strong negative influence on foreign\r\ninvestors and causing problems among regional\r\npeacekeeping forces. We remain concerned about the\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\ndisastrous consequences of malaria in developing\r\ncountries, where prevention and better access to\r\ntreatments for vulnerable populations could bring\r\nsignificant results, and we follow with interest the\r\nprogress recently made in clinical trials of a malaria\r\nvaccine. The international community needs to\r\nincrease efforts to tackle infectious diseases. One way\r\nto fight these pandemics might be to work to\r\nstrengthen national health systems overall. We would\r\nalso like to welcome the efforts made by the World\r\nHealth Organization (WHO) in the fight against these\r\ndiseases. The EU accounts for 55 per cent of all\r\nresources pledged to the Global Fund to fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, and 65 per cent of the\r\nworld’s assistance to health and population in\r\ndeveloping countries. The EU is also the biggest donor\r\nto the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS\r\n(UNAIDS) voluntary contributions.\r\nThe EU notes the support of the United Nations\r\nsystem to NEPAD and would like to stress the\r\nimportance of linking the operational activities of\r\nUnited Nations agencies with NEPAD priorities. We\r\nwelcome the steps that have already been taken for\r\nbetter collaboration within the United Nations system\r\nin order to support NEPAD and its goals.\r\nThis debate is also devoted to the promotion of\r\nlasting peace in Africa. The major progress that Africa\r\nhas made in addressing conflicts on the continent and\r\ndeveloping an institutional capacity to deal with\r\nconflict prevention and resolution has been impressive.\r\nThe African Union (AU) has set itself an ambitious\r\nagenda in the area of peace and security. With the AU\r\nin the driver’s seat, Africa has demonstrated strong\r\nresolve, and its security agenda is quickly becoming a\r\nreality.\r\nThe EU welcomes the progress made by the AU\r\nin establishing its continental architecture for peace\r\nand security, in particular the launch of the Peace and\r\nSecurity Council. The EU stands ready to work with\r\nAfrica in supporting the Peace and Security Council\r\nand in helping build African capabilities for addressing\r\nand resolving conflicts, including through deployment\r\nof African peacekeeping missions. In this respect, we\r\nalso welcome the progress made with regard to the\r\nestablishment of the African standby force.\r\nThe European Union’s African Peace Facility is\r\nthe main financial instrument for developing and\r\nstrengthening the already strong practical cooperation\r\nbetween the EU and Africa in the crucial task of\r\npreventing and responding to conflict on the continent.\r\n€250 million have been earmarked to promote African\r\npeacekeeping in Africa and to support the African\r\ninstitutional capacity-building process. The African\r\nPeace Facility is now being used for the first time to\r\nsupport the AU-led monitoring mission in Darfur.\r\nIn addition, the EU is currently further\r\ndeveloping other instruments at its disposal,\r\npredominantly in the field of the European Security\r\nand Defence Policy, in order to further expand EU\r\nsupport for African initiatives to prevent, manage and\r\nresolve conflicts on the continent. The European Union\r\nwelcomes the commitment by the Group of Eight to\r\nsupport efforts to enhance the African capacity to\r\nengage more effectively in conflict management and\r\nresolution. It also acknowledges the valuable assistance\r\nof the United Nations in this area. The effectiveness of\r\nthe various activities should be strengthened by further\r\nefforts of coordination. We encourage the African\r\nUnion to take up that task.\r\nThe number of African countries in conflict is\r\nfalling, which is also due to the efforts of the African\r\nUnion and African subregional organizations, such as\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States, the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development and the\r\nSouthern African Development Community, aimed at\r\nrestoring peace on the continent. But instability\r\ncontinues in many countries and regions. The\r\ncontinued instability in Africa is in part responsible for\r\nthe surge in United Nations peacekeeping. It is\r\ntherefore all the more encouraging that United Nations\r\nactivities are increasingly preceded by or coordinated\r\nwith peacemaking and peacekeeping efforts by African\r\norganizations, most notably in Burundi, Darfur and\r\nSomalia. The European Union warmly welcomes and\r\nfully respects this clear demonstration of African\r\nleadership and ownership, and would like to use this\r\nopportunity to reiterate its readiness to support the\r\nAfrican Union in its efforts to stabilize the security\r\nsituation in Darfur and to act as a mediator in the\r\nAbuja talks.\r\nThe European Union is also further developing its\r\ncooperation with the United Nations in the field of\r\ncrisis management. Building on the experience of\r\nOperation Artemis in Bunia in June 2003, the European\r\nUnion is currently developing its rapid reaction\r\ncapabilities in the form of so-called battlegroups,\r\nwhich will enhance the European Union’s ability to\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nrespond to United Nations requests in short-term crisis\r\nmanagement situations. In addition, the European\r\nUnion is working on enhancing European Union-\r\nUnited Nations cooperation in civilian crisis\r\nmanagement operations.\r\nIn crisis regions in Africa, “after the conflict”\r\nunfortunately often means “before the conflict”, as all\r\ntoo often conflicts recur. Sustained post-conflict\r\npeacebuilding efforts are required. We must show long-\r\nterm engagement and accept the resource implications\r\nthereof. Too often, financing for crucial activities, such\r\nas the reintegration of ex-combatants, is underfunded.\r\nThe international community must find ways of\r\nensuring that funding for peacebuilding activities\r\nreaches post-conflict situations earlier and more\r\npredictably. In this regard, the balance of assessed and\r\nvoluntary contributions should be examined.\r\nAfrican countries emerging from conflict should\r\nbe the highest priority of the United Nations system\r\nand the international community as a whole. The\r\nEuropean Union welcomes the establishment of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council Ad Hoc Advisory\r\nGroups on Guinea-Bissau and Burundi as a valuable\r\nfirst step in a more holistic and coordinated approach\r\ntowards longer term stability and societal well-being in\r\nthose countries. Those experiences should be fed into\r\nongoing discussions within the United Nations\r\nintergovernmental machinery on promoting an\r\ninternational coherent response to countries in crisis.\r\nConflicts in Africa cause immense human\r\nsuffering and have huge economic costs. Much more\r\nshould therefore be done in order to move from a\r\nculture of “putting out fires” and conflict management\r\nto a culture of conflict prevention. To shift from crisis\r\nmanagement to conflict prevention requires an\r\nintegrated approach. Such an approach should be built\r\non the principle that the primary responsibility for the\r\nprevention of conflict rests with Member States.\r\nHowever, a true international partnership is needed to\r\nassist affected Member States in turning the tide.\r\nAfrica’s problems are also the problems of the\r\ninternational community. Ensuring Africa’s inclusion\r\nin world advancement is our key priority. Without any\r\ndoubt, the battle against poverty has to be fought on\r\nthat continent. Only if we win that battle can we lay the\r\nfoundation for lasting peace and stability on the\r\ncontinent. We believe that, with all the necessary\r\nefforts and commitment and with political leadership\r\nand will, we can win this battle. To quote the famous\r\nrock star Bono in this regard: “It is not about charity,\r\nit’s about justice.”\r\nMr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I thank\r\nyou for allowing me the opportunity to speak on behalf\r\nof the Group of 77 and China on this important subject.\r\nThe Group of 77 is pleased to participate in the\r\ndebate on this important agenda item at this session of\r\nthe General Assembly. We do so against the backdrop\r\nof two reports of the Secretary-General: the\r\nconsolidated report on progress in implementation and\r\ninternational support for the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD)(A/59/206) and the\r\nprogress report on the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations contained in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa (A/59/285).\r\nThese reports have provided detailed and rich\r\ninsights into the progress made, as well as the\r\nchallenges and constraints encountered in the past year\r\nin the implementation of NEPAD and in managing and\r\nresolving conflicts in Africa. The two reports\r\ncomplement each other and offer a balanced\r\nperspective on the efforts of African countries and the\r\nsupport by the international community aimed at the\r\neconomic and political development of Africa.\r\nThe Group is pleased to learn that African\r\ncountries have made much progress in such priority\r\nareas of NEPAD as agriculture, infrastructure,\r\nenvironment, tourism, education, health,\r\nindustralization, science and technology. These areas\r\nare important for the growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment of Africa. In particular, we note that\r\nAfrican countries have demonstrated their\r\ndetermination to advance the implementation of\r\nNEPAD by developing sectoral policy frameworks, by\r\npromoting specific programmes and projects and by\r\nestablishing targets for expenditure on selected NEPAD\r\npriorities. It is significant that the sectors where\r\nexpenditure targets have been determined include\r\nagriculture, health, water and sanitation, and science\r\nand technology. All these are of critical importance for\r\nAfrica’s development.\r\nThe Group of 77 also applauds the progress that\r\nAfrican countries have made in the past year in\r\ndeveloping the African Peer Review Mechanism\r\n(APRM). Step-by-step, the institutional arrangements\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nof the APRM have been put in place. The APRM\r\nmechanism is unique in that it shows Africa’s\r\ncommitment to improve and strengthen all aspects of\r\nits governance through mutual learning and sharing of\r\nexperiences. Even so, a well functioning APRM is a\r\nbadge of honour that Africa has conferred upon\r\nitself — not a prize given to it by its partners, nor, even\r\nworse, a transformation of this mechanism into a\r\nconstraint, into a form of conditionality for supporting\r\nNEPAD.\r\nNEPAD is based on the dual principles of\r\nownership and partnership. Africa owns, leads and\r\nmanages the process. Nonetheless, African leaders\r\nrecognized the importance of international support as\r\ncritical to NEPAD. The international community has\r\npledged that support in various forums, and most\r\nnotably in this Assembly, when it adopted the United\r\nNations Declaration on the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development in Assembly resolution 57/2 and\r\nother subsequent resolutions.\r\nAfrica’s development partners play an important\r\nrole in fulfilling NEPAD’s spirit of partnership. As the\r\nreport on NEPAD makes clear, Africa’s development\r\npartners have taken a series of measures at the\r\ninternational level that will potentially benefit the\r\nimplementation of that programme. We note in\r\nparticular the various initiatives and actions taken to\r\nthat end by the developed countries — through debt\r\nrelief, trade, official development assistance, and\r\npublic policies to support foreign direct investment in\r\nAfrica.\r\nYet, the Secretary-General’s report notes that a\r\nfundamental policy challenge in international support\r\nfor NEPAD is achieving coherence of policy actions in\r\nfavour of Africa. That lack of coherence in the areas of\r\ntrade, debt relief and aid flow to Africa is hindering\r\ninternational support for Africa. Therefore, we fully\r\nendorse the recommendation that Africa’s development\r\npartners ensure policy coherence in actions to support\r\nAfrica and undertake concrete measures to accelerate\r\nthe implementation of NEPAD by committing financial\r\nresources to be used in NEPAD priority areas.\r\nOf equal importance is the Group’s appreciation\r\nof the support that some of its members have extended\r\nto Africa through a variety of South-South cooperation\r\nprogrammes, in keeping with the consensus resolutions\r\nthat the Assembly has adopted in the past two years.\r\nWith respect to the special report on the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa, we note that\r\nprogress is being made in the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations contained in the 1998 report,\r\nalthough, as we will see later in more detail, greater\r\nprogress was made in some areas than in others.\r\nAs a result of the implementation of some of\r\nthose recommendations, Africa is now experiencing\r\nfewer conflicts than in 1998, at the time of the issuance\r\nof the original report, when 14 States were involved in\r\narmed conflict and 11 were experiencing political\r\nturmoil.\r\nThe report recognizes that the international\r\ncommunity, African countries and regional\r\norganizations have made serious efforts to deal with\r\nthe scourge of conflicts in Africa. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral further notes that, while steady progress has\r\nbeen noted in areas such as peacemaking and\r\npeacekeeping, the progress made in poverty reduction\r\nhas been modest and slow, despite the considerable\r\nefforts made by African countries to implement\r\nNEPAD and to create an enabling environment suitable\r\nfor economic growth.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his support for the development efforts of\r\nAfrican countries. We urge the international\r\ncommunity, particularly the donor States and financial\r\ninstitutions, as well as the private sector and the\r\ninternational community, to provide generous support\r\nin the context of this new political framework.\r\nMr. Kittikhoun (Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic): First of all, on behalf of the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), allow me to\r\nexpress our appreciation to the Secretary-General for\r\nhis report (A/59/206) on the progress of\r\nimplementation of resolution 58/233 on the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).\r\nWe are pleased that several actions to support the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD have been undertaken by\r\nthe world community and international organizations.\r\nIn that regard, ASEAN supports further international\r\naction and, in particular, welcomes initiatives to\r\nstrengthen partnerships.\r\nThe partnership between Asia and Africa is a\r\nlong-standing one. The first historical encounter was in\r\n1955 in Bandung, Indonesia, at the Asia-Africa\r\nConference. At that time, the nations of both continents\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nfaced the common struggle of freeing themselves from\r\nthe chains of colonialization.\r\nToday, there is a different challenge to overcome:\r\nto combat the malaise of poverty that manifests itself\r\nin most of Africa and in some countries of Asia. There\r\nis also the common struggle to better integrate into the\r\nglobalized economy and to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment through the attainment of the targets set\r\nout in the framework of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, as\r\nwell as to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other\r\ndiseases.\r\nSuch commonality has spurred developing\r\ncountries to consolidate their concerns through a\r\nconcerted voice. In the case of Asia and Africa, we\r\nhave strengthened our resolve through, among others,\r\nthe optimal utilization of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\nCentre for South-South Technical Cooperation and\r\nseveral programmes in the framework of technical\r\ncooperation among developing countries. We, the\r\nmember countries of ASEAN, are resolved to maintain\r\na close partnership with Africa for our mutual benefit,\r\nand we are very proud to be part of these processes.\r\nFurthermore, ASEAN and NEPAD can also be\r\nimportant links in building a bridge that spans the\r\nIndian Ocean, connecting our two continents in the\r\ncontext of a new strategic partnership. Both continents\r\nmust take advantage of every opportunity for mutually\r\nbeneficial collaboration, including through ASEAN\r\nand NEPAD.\r\nThe historic Asian-African Conference 50 years\r\nago gave rise to a unique spirit of kinship and\r\nsolidarity among the nations of the two regions known\r\nas the “Bandung Spirit”, which still resonates today in\r\nboth regions. The Bandung Spirit’s principles of\r\nsolidarity, friendship and cooperation have served as an\r\ninspiration for developing countries, especially\r\nASEAN ones.\r\nASEAN itself has been reaching out to other\r\nsubregional organizations. In East Asia, we have been\r\nworking towards closer interaction with China, Japan\r\nand South Korea through the ASEAN+3 process.\r\nSimilarly, we have been active in promoting dialogue\r\nwith Latin American countries through the Forum for\r\nEast Asia-Latin America Cooperation, and in Europe\r\nthrough the Asia-Europe Meetings. ASEAN now seeks\r\nto promote dialogue and cooperation with Africa in\r\norder to chart a possible course for more concrete\r\naction. Such a dialogue has been started, inter alia, by\r\nJapan, through the Tokyo International Conference on\r\nAfrican Development, and by Indonesia and South\r\nAfrica, through their initiative to convene the Asian-\r\nAfrican Sub-Regional Organizations Conference\r\n(AASROC).\r\nDuring the Eighth ASEAN Summit, held in\r\nCambodia in 2002, President Thabo Mbeki of South\r\nAfrica, in his capacity as Chair of the African Union,\r\ncalled on ASEAN leaders to cooperate with Africa on\r\nNEPAD and on matters of common interest. In\r\nresponse, President Megawati Soekarnoputri of\r\nIndonesia offered to co-host the first Asian-African\r\nSub-Regional Organization Conference.\r\nThe first Conference, held in Bandung, Indonesia,\r\non 29 and 30 July 2003, was a vital catalyst in\r\ninspiring both Asia and Africa to reinvigorate the\r\nprinciples and process of cooperation that had been\r\nlaunched in 1955. The Governments of Indonesia and\r\nSouth Africa later agreed to organize the Asian-African\r\nSummit, to be held on 21 and 22 April 2005 in Jakarta,\r\nwhich will be immediately followed by the\r\ncommemoration of the golden jubilee of the Asian-\r\nAfrican Conference, to be held on 23 April 2005 in\r\nBandung. The theme of that summit will be\r\n“Reinvigorating the Bandung spirit: working towards a\r\nnew Asian-African strategic partnership”.\r\nAt the second Conference, held in Durban, South\r\nAfrica, on 19 and 20 August 2004, it was agreed that\r\nthe New Asian-African Strategic Partnership be\r\nlaunched by the leaders of the two continents during\r\nthe Asian-African Summit to be held in April 2005.\r\nThe Partnership is envisioned as a vehicle to enable the\r\ncountries of the two regions to cooperate for their\r\nmutual benefit, and it is intended to promote peace,\r\nprosperity and progress.\r\nI would like to conclude by saying that ASEAN\r\nand NEPAD share a common aspiration, and that is to\r\npursue a path of development that rests on the\r\nprinciples of peace, security, stability and prosperity.\r\nTowards that objective, ASEAN would like to reaffirm\r\nits commitment to the successful outcome of the Asian-\r\nAfrican Summit and of the golden jubilee of the 1955\r\nAsian-African Conference, both to be held in 2005, and\r\nemphasizes the important role of the international\r\ncommunity in ensuring implementation of the\r\noutcomes of the 2005 Asian-African Summit.\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nMr. Hackett (Barbados): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\r\nmember States at the United Nations on agenda\r\nitem 38 (a), “New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment: progress in implementation and\r\ninternational support”, and 38 (b), “Causes of conflict\r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa”.\r\nCARICOM countries have strong ties of history\r\nand a long tradition of cooperation and solidarity with\r\nthe countries of Africa: we endured together the\r\nexperience of slavery, with a large number of African\r\nslaves arriving on our shores at the height of the slave\r\ntrade; we participated around the same period of time\r\nin the anti-colonial struggle leading to the\r\nindependence of our countries; and we stood by the\r\nside of African States, particularly South Africa, in\r\ntheir fight against Apartheid. The item that is before us\r\ntoday therefore holds special significance for the\r\ncountries of the Caribbean Community. So, while we\r\nassociate ourselves with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China, we wanted to make a few remarks of our\r\nown.\r\nI would like at the outset to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the two reports contained in documents\r\nA/59/206 and A/59/285, which do much to facilitate\r\nour consideration of the agenda item before us. They\r\nprovide an insightful analysis of the progress made and\r\nthe problems that still remain to be overcome in\r\nachieving development and extending peace and\r\nprosperity throughout the African continent.\r\nCARICOM member States are heartened by the\r\nleadership that African countries have shown, both in\r\nlaying the foundations for long-term development and\r\nin creating conditions for durable peace and security on\r\nthat continent. Those efforts deserve the unstinting\r\nsupport of the international community. I take this\r\nopportunity to pledge the full support and cooperation\r\nof CARICOM in that regard.\r\nIn considering the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), CARICOM member States\r\ntake note of the strong sense of ownership\r\ndemonstrated by African countries and organizations,\r\nas witnessed by the increasing integration of NEPAD\r\npriorities into national policies and programmes. We\r\nare encouraged by the progress being made in\r\ndeveloping sectoral policy frameworks, implementing\r\nspecific programmes and projects and establishing\r\ntargets for expenditure on selected NEPAD sectoral\r\npriorities. As the report (A/59/206) indicates, that\r\nprogress clearly demonstrates the policy coherence that\r\nis being achieved in the implementation of NEPAD.\r\nWe also welcome the launching of specific\r\ninitiatives in such areas as infrastructure, health,\r\neducation, environment, tourism, agriculture, science\r\nand technology and industrialization. Since the\r\nagricultural sector is considered to be the centrepiece\r\nof the NEPAD agenda, permit me to single out that\r\nsector for specific comment. It is particularly\r\nnoteworthy that African Governments have been\r\nstrengthening their agricultural research and\r\ndevelopment as well as their agricultural technology\r\nsystems and that they have committed themselves to\r\nallocating at least 10 per cent of national budgetary\r\nresources to that sector. That shows not only a\r\ndeepening of national ownership but also a recognition\r\nof the critical role that agriculture plays in the\r\nattainment of sustainable development.\r\nThe establishment of the African Peer Review\r\nMechanism is a laudable initiative. We believe that the\r\nMechanism will help African countries to identify the\r\ninstitutional, policy and capacity strengths and\r\nweaknesses of the programme and will serve as a tool\r\nfor making the implementation of NEPAD more\r\neffective. The increase in the number of countries that\r\nhave signed on to the Mechanism and the progress that\r\nhas been made in moving that important initiative\r\nforward reflect the growing confidence in its value and\r\ngives practical expression to the principle of African\r\nownership of the NEPAD programme.\r\nNotwithstanding the encouraging achievements\r\nmade thus far, however, CARICOM member States\r\ntake note of the fact that many challenges and\r\nconstraints beset our work towards the full attainment\r\nof the NEPAD objectives. The support of the\r\ninternational community remains crucial to the\r\nsuccessful realization of the goals of the New\r\nPartnership. Africa continues to bear a heavy debt\r\nburden and lacks domestic resources. Africa’s share of\r\nglobal trade continues to be minuscule, while the\r\ncontinent has been unable to attract sufficient levels of\r\nforeign direct investment.\r\nWhile several developed countries have granted\r\nvarious forms of debt relief, including outright\r\ncancellation, to several African countries, the issue of\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\ndebt relief continues to pose a significant challenge to\r\nthe development efforts of many African countries.\r\nAttaining the decision point, we learn from the report,\r\nhas not brought about the much-hoped-for debt\r\nsustainability. We therefore support the extension of\r\nthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\r\nInitiative until December 2006 in order to provide the\r\nnecessary financing for its completion, and thereby\r\ngreater relief for some current beneficiaries, as well as\r\nfor those countries that have yet to reach the decision\r\npoint. CARICOM countries also join the call for a new\r\nframework for debt sustainability that aims at greater\r\nflexibility in dealing with the external debt crisis and\r\ngreater willingness to reduce the debt of countries that\r\nare at risk or that display signs of insolvency.\r\nIt is clear, however, that, in addition to debt\r\nrelief, much more is required in terms of increases in\r\nofficial development assistance and foreign direct\r\ninvestment and in terms of reformed trade policies if\r\nAfrica is to be able to achieve the objectives of\r\nNEPAD and, ultimately, the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. Moreover, assistance in all those areas could be\r\nmore effective if there were greater coherence of policy\r\nactions in the international assistance provided by\r\ndonors.\r\nCARICOM States therefore urge increased\r\ninternational efforts for the New Partnership. We\r\nourselves have provided support in areas such as\r\nelectoral reform and public-sector reform and stand\r\nready to extend further cooperation, within the limits\r\nof our resources. In addition, we believe that the\r\nAfrican Partnership Forum, which was established for\r\nthe purpose of deepening dialogue in support of\r\nAfrica’s development, is a mechanism through which\r\nthe potential of South-South cooperation could be\r\nharnessed in support of NEPAD. In that regard, African\r\nGovernments may wish to consider including a\r\nrepresentative, or representatives, from other parts of\r\nthe South in the membership of the Forum.\r\nTurning now to questions of peace and security,\r\nCARICOM member States are encouraged by\r\nindications of abatement in armed conflict in Africa.\r\nAs the Secretary-General’s report (A/59/285) notes, the\r\nnumber of countries in the region experiencing armed\r\nconflict or civil strife has dropped from 14, in 1998, to\r\nsix today. Similar trends are noted with respect to\r\ncountries under severe political crisis or turbulence.\r\nCARICOM member States welcome the recent\r\nlaunching of the African Peace and Security Council,\r\nwhich we believe will play a pivotal role in the\r\nresolution of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace on the continent.\r\nWe commend the active role played by the\r\nAfrican Union in addressing major crises such as the\r\none in Darfur.\r\nWe call for further strengthening of cooperation,\r\nunder Chapter VIII of the Charter, between the United\r\nNations and regional arrangements and institutions in\r\nAfrica.\r\nIn conclusion, CARICOM member States are of\r\nthe view that the encouraging signs of change in Africa\r\nneed to be matched by robust international support, so\r\nthat the gains made can be consolidated and the\r\ncontinent placed on a path to sustainable progress. We\r\nstand ready to support Africa in that noble exercise.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): My delegation would\r\nlike to express its appreciation to the Secretary-General\r\nfor the reports before us.\r\nThe report on the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) (A/59/206) lays out the various\r\nprojects under way in the areas of infrastructure,\r\nhealth, education, agriculture and industrialization, to\r\nmention but a few, that the African Union has\r\nundertaken to enhance Africa’s development. It goes\r\nwithout saying that, development being a dynamic\r\nprocess, the implementation of those projects is also\r\ninterconnected. Nevertheless, allow me to comment on\r\nsome of the individual undertakings mentioned in the\r\nreport.\r\nThe importance of infrastructure to Africa’s\r\ndevelopment cannot be overemphasized. In that\r\ncontext, I wish to point out that the Southern Africa\r\npower pool project is of crucial importance to Southern\r\nAfrica and to the continent as whole. However, we are\r\nfaced with a problem that could have devastating\r\neffects on our development. Hence, at the last summit\r\nof the Southern Africa Development Community\r\n(SADC), heads of State or Government reaffirmed that\r\n“the power supply situation in the SADC region will\r\nreach crisis levels by 2007 if no concrete steps are\r\ntaken to increase the region’s power-generation\r\ncapacity”.\r\nIt is in that context that we express our\r\nappreciation to the African Development Bank (ADB)\r\nfor funds provided to NEPAD, and call on the\r\ninternational community to augment the capacity of the\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nADB to assist with the development efforts of Africa in\r\nthat critical area.\r\nAfrican heads of State or Government have\r\nreaffirmed their commitment and determination to\r\nincrease food production, reduce hunger and transform\r\nrural Africa by way of developing and launching\r\nAfrica’s green revolution. Through the Comprehensive\r\nAfrica Agriculture Development Programme, Africa\r\naims to achieve food security and to eradicate poverty\r\non the continent. Agricultural research and\r\ndevelopment is a priority in that respect. We therefore\r\nexpress our thanks and appreciation to the Canadian\r\nInternational Development Agency for financial\r\nassistance aimed at carrying out research and\r\nestablishing agricultural centres on the continent.\r\nI wish to stress that mainstreaming a gender\r\nperspective in the implementation of NEPAD remains a\r\npriority for the African Union. At their most recent\r\nAssembly, which was held in Addis Ababa, the heads\r\nof State and Government adopted a declaration on the\r\nsubject of gender in which they acknowledged the\r\nprogress made and emphasized the importance of\r\nextending gender parity to the subregional and national\r\nlevels. In that connection, we are proud that the first\r\nPresident of the Pan-African Parliament is a woman.\r\nThat demonstrates Africa’s commitment to gender\r\nequality.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General points out the\r\nrole of regional economic communities in\r\nimplementing NEPAD. We believe that regional\r\neconomic communities are key in that process, as they\r\nare the building blocks of the African Union.\r\nConvinced of that important role, SADC held a two-\r\nday workshop for its member States that was aimed at\r\nbuilding synergies between NEPAD and the SADC\r\nregional indicative strategic development plan. In\r\naddition, the meeting acknowledged the linkage among\r\nthe implementation of, respectively, the regional\r\nindicative strategic development plan, NEPAD and the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDG).\r\nThe challenges and constraints with regard to the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD are well covered in the\r\nreport, and I shall not repeat them. However, I must\r\nemphasize that external support to NEPAD is\r\ncomplementary to the efforts of the African countries\r\nin this partnership. In that respect, we welcome the\r\nvarious efforts and initiatives undertaken to support\r\nAfrica’s development. In addition, we seek to increase\r\nSouth-South cooperation, for it continues to play an\r\nimportant role in the development of Africa.\r\nThe United Nations is at the centre of mobilizing\r\ninternational support for NEPAD. But, as we all know,\r\nthe United Nations system, which has long supported\r\nAfrica’s development, can continue to do so only if\r\nMember States provide it with financial support.\r\nTherefore, the capacity of the United Nations hinges on\r\nthe commitment of Member States. The conclusions\r\nand recommendations of the Secretary-General are\r\nvalid and encompass the spirit of partnership, which is\r\nwhat is needed to implement NEPAD and to assist\r\nAfrica in meeting the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nOn the implementation of the recommendations\r\ncontained in the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa (A/59/285), we\r\nare encouraged by the progress that has been made. We\r\nnote, for example, that only six African countries are\r\nconsidered to be in a situation of armed conflict today,\r\nas opposed to 16 countries that were in that situation\r\nwhen the first report was issued, in 1998. We also note\r\nthat African countries and regional organizations on\r\nthe continent have made serious efforts to deal with the\r\nscourge of conflict by promoting peace negotiations\r\nand brokering peace agreements. Clearly, our aim is to\r\ncompletely rid Africa of armed conflict.\r\nThe African Union has created a Peace and\r\nSecurity Council and is in the process of establishing\r\nan African standby force to enable Africa to undertake\r\neffective peace operations and to enhance collective\r\nsecurity. We note with appreciation the positive\r\nresponse by the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity to conflict situations in Africa.\r\nLaudable as these peacemaking and peacekeeping\r\ndevelopments are, progress has been modest, and the\r\nimplementation of most recommendations has been\r\nslow. Needless to say, there can be no peace without\r\ndevelopment, and there can be no development without\r\npeace. Hence, peace efforts should go hand in hand\r\nwith economic development efforts.\r\nAlso of concern to us is the fact, that while some\r\nlong-standing conflicts have been resolved, there are\r\nnew challenges threatening peace and stability, such as\r\nthe spread of HIV and AIDS. We therefore call on the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community to\r\nengage with Africa to make serious efforts in assisting\r\nit to implement NEPAD and its priority areas. Only\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nthen can we ensure durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment on the African continent.\r\nThe Abuja Declaration on Roll Back Malaria in\r\nAfrica is a collective undertaking by African heads of\r\nState to address this major killer disease in Africa.\r\nWhile the sixtieth session of the General Assembly is\r\nexpected to evaluate progress made in the achievement\r\nof the mid-term targets, the seriousness of this disease\r\nwarrants consideration at the present session.\r\nIn Namibia, malaria continues to be a major\r\npublic health problem and thus warrants special\r\nattention in terms of monitoring trends, formulating\r\ncontrol strategies and ensuring prevention at all levels\r\nof the health care system. Namibia is prone to\r\noutbreaks, with seasonal trends, which are mainly\r\ninfluenced by rainfall. We have established the\r\nNational Vector-borne Disease Control Programme to\r\nformulate and update policies and guidelines on\r\nmalaria control and prevention and thus prevent deaths\r\nand reduce illness and socio-economic loss due to\r\nmalaria and other vector-born diseases through the\r\nprogressive improvement and strengthening of local\r\nand national capabilities.\r\nMalaria cases seem to have decreased during the\r\nyears 2002 and 2003. This can be attributed to\r\nimprovement in vector control interventions and,\r\npartly, to climatic changes that resulted in relatively\r\nshort malaria transmission seasons.\r\nTo promote awareness-raising, Malaria\r\nAwareness Week in Namibia, Southern African\r\nEconomic Community (SADC) Malaria Day and\r\nAfrica Malaria Day were all commemorated in\r\nNamibia. We have also trained trainers who will, in\r\nturn, train others at district and facility levels. As a\r\nresult, the monitoring of epidemics has shown\r\nimprovement in a number of districts. However, we\r\nknow that a lot still needs to be done.\r\nFurthermore, various partners donated more than\r\n42,000 nets during the current year. These include\r\n36,000 from the World Health Organization (WHO),\r\n7,000 from the United Nations Children’s Fund and the\r\nrest from the Shell Company, Old Mutual and Standard\r\nBank Namibia. Most of these nets have been\r\ndistributed to pregnant mothers and to children under\r\nthe age of five. Thanks to the European Union, our\r\nprogramme and support services currently have\r\nadequate infrastructure, which enhances our work.\r\nWhile we commend the partnership advocacy\r\neffort, we would propose that collaboration at the\r\ncountry level should also include awareness-raising,\r\nthus contributing to prevention. The unavailability of\r\nmedical products due to their high cost leaves us with\r\nthe alternative of using insecticide-treated nets.\r\nAs indicated in the report, factors contributing to\r\nmalaria are multidimensional and therefore call for a\r\ncomprehensive response. Resistance to anti-malaria\r\ntreatment, combined with the inaccessibility of\r\ncombination therapies, is aggravating the situation.\r\nTherefore, the pilot scheme being explored by WHO is\r\none that those affected by malaria await with great\r\nhope. We need to focus on treatment to which vectors\r\nare not resistant and that is widely available and, at the\r\nsame time, affordable.\r\nWe call on the international community to\r\ncontribute generously to the Global Fund to Fight\r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. That is necessary for\r\nthe Fund to complement the efforts of the countries\r\naffected, particularly those in Africa.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nThe Chinese delegation thanks the Secretary-General\r\nfor his report entitled “New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment: second consolidated report on progress\r\nin implementation and international support”\r\n(A/59/206). My delegation appreciates the effort that\r\nwent into preparing it.\r\nThe delegation of China wishes to thank the\r\nrepresentative of Qatar for his statement delivered on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe Chinese delegation has carefully studied the\r\nSecretary-General’s report. We are glad to note that,\r\nthrough the collective and individual efforts of African\r\ncountries, remarkable progress has been made in\r\nimplementing the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). African countries have jointly\r\nformulated a sectoral policy framework. Some specific\r\nprogrammes and projects have been carried out, and an\r\nindex for NEPAD priorities has been compiled. In\r\naddition, headway has been made in many areas, such\r\nas infrastructure, health, education, the environment,\r\ntourism, agriculture, science and technology and\r\nindustrialization.\r\nAt the same time, we have also noted that Africa\r\nstill faces numerous difficulties, challenges and\r\nconstraints in genuinely establishing and implementing\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nNEPAD. In order to overcome those difficulties and\r\nrespond to the challenges, the Secretary-General has\r\nput forward three recommendations, which the Chinese\r\ndelegation fully endorses. I would now like to share\r\nwith the Assembly my Government’s view on how to\r\nassist Africa in implementing NEPAD.\r\nFirst of all, we believe that the international\r\ncommunity should strive to establish an external\r\neconomic and financial environment favourable to\r\nAfrica’s development. Africa cannot develop in\r\nisolation from the strong support and assistance of the\r\ninternational community. In implementing NEPAD,\r\nAfrican countries are faced with a wide spectrum of\r\ngrave challenges in terms of financial resources,\r\ntechnologies, debt, trade and investment. Without an\r\nopen, fair, democratic and transparent international\r\neconomic and financial order, it will be very difficult\r\nfor African countries to attain development.\r\nSecondly, official development assistance (ODA)\r\nto African countries should be increased. The\r\nSecretary-General pointed out in his report that,\r\ncompared with the previous year, ODA to African\r\ncountries in 2003 increased by 3.9 per cent, which is\r\nstill far behind the level required by the Monterrey\r\nConsensus and the Brussels Programme of Action for\r\nthe Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-\r\n2010. Consequently, the international community,\r\nespecially developed donor countries, should fulfil\r\ntheir commitments, drastically increase ODA to\r\nAfrican countries, especially to least developed\r\ncountries, and respect African countries’ ownership\r\nand leadership in the use of ODA.\r\nThirdly, South-South cooperation with African\r\ncountries should be effectively strengthened in order to\r\nrealize the common development of developing\r\ncountries. The Secretary-General pointed out in his\r\nreport that South-South cooperation has increasingly\r\nbecome an important complement to international\r\ndevelopment cooperation and is playing a major role in\r\nimplementing NEPAD. We fully agree with that view.\r\nWe sincerely call upon developing countries to\r\nvigorously promote the Global System of Trade\r\nPreferences among developing countries and conduct\r\nfruitful South-South cooperation.\r\nFourthly, conflict prevention and resolution\r\nconstitute an important guarantee for Africa’s\r\ndevelopment. The United Nations should play a\r\nheightened role in African conflict prevention, peace-\r\nbuilding, peacekeeping and post-conflict\r\nreconstruction, and reinforce its coordination and\r\ncooperation with the relevant African regional and\r\nsubregional organizations.\r\nAn important component of China’s foreign\r\npolicy is to develop and consolidate friendly relations\r\nand cooperation with African countries and peoples\r\nand to support and assist their endeavours for\r\neconomic development and social progress. As a major\r\nstep towards enhancing South-South cooperation,\r\nChina and African countries have established the\r\nChina-Africa Cooperation Forum. China has conducted\r\nextensive and substantive exchanges and cooperation\r\nwith African countries. The Chinese Government has\r\nalready signed debt-cancellation agreements with 31\r\nAfrican countries, and the cancelled debts account for\r\nover 60 per cent of the total amount owed to China. At\r\nthe same time, the Chinese Government has decided to\r\naward duty-free status to some goods exported to\r\nChina by least-developed African countries.\r\nFinally, I would like to state that the Chinese\r\nGovernment is ready to support Africa’s development\r\nand the implementation of the NEPAD through the\r\nChina-Africa Cooperation Forum and all other\r\ncooperation channels.\r\nMr. Amayo (Kenya): My delegation appreciates\r\nthe able manner in which you, Mr. President, continue\r\nto steer our deliberations. We are grateful to the\r\nSecretary-General for his second consolidated report\r\non progress in implementation and international\r\nsupport for the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). We also align ourselves with\r\nthe statement made by the representative of Nigeria on\r\nbehalf the African Union, as well as that made by the\r\nrepresentative of Qatar on behalf of the G-77 and\r\nChina.\r\nNEPAD’s goal is based on a common vision: a\r\nfirm and shared conviction of the pressing duty to\r\neradicate poverty in Africa. It aims at placing African\r\ncountries on the path of sustainable growth and\r\ndevelopment, both individually and collectively. In\r\naddition, it aims at ensuring that our countries\r\nparticipate actively in the world economy and the body\r\npolitic.\r\nMy delegation would like to reiterate Kenya’s\r\ncommitment to promoting accelerated growth and\r\nsustainable development by eradicating widespread and\r\nsevere poverty, halting Africa’s marginalization,\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nincreasing Africa’s competitiveness and bargaining\r\npower in the globalization process and restoring peace,\r\nsecurity and stability. My Government has therefore\r\nincorporated that initiative into its economic planning\r\nprocess. In that regard, the implementation of the\r\nNEPAD agenda is central to the realization of Kenya’s\r\naspirations, as espoused in our economic recovery\r\nstrategy for wealth and employment creation.\r\nKenya’s commitment to the challenge of the new\r\nbeginning and strategic direction spelled out in NEPAD\r\nis demonstrated by the fact that it has established a\r\nnational steering committee charged with the\r\nresponsibility for coordinating the country’s\r\nparticipation in the NEPAD initiative and, specifically,\r\nwith promoting a genuine partnership between the\r\nGovernment, the private sector and civil society. The\r\ncommittee is also a mechanism for constructive\r\nengagement with development partners, especially in\r\nthe harmonization of aid flows and procedures as they\r\nrelate to the implementation of NEPAD activities.\r\nAt the second East Africa NEPAD summit, held\r\nin Kenya in October of last year, the secretariat was\r\ncharged with the responsibility of coordinating\r\nregional NEPAD activities. The Governments of\r\nBurundi, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Mauritius, Rwanda, the\r\nSudan, Tanzania and Uganda, as well as representatives\r\nof the Common Market for Eastern and Southern\r\nAfrica (COMESA), the East African Community\r\n(EAC), the Intergovernmental Authority on\r\nDevelopment (IGAD) and various diplomatic missions\r\nand United Nations agencies attended the summit.\r\nOne of the key elements in the implementation of\r\nNEPAD is the African Peer Review Mechanism. This\r\nvoluntary mechanism is open to all member States for\r\nevaluating progress in improving standards of human\r\nrights, political, economic and corporate governance\r\nand democracy through periodic reviews. We believe\r\nthat this indicates the seriousness with which the\r\nAfrican continent will engage in the real issues of\r\ngovernance that stand in the way of development.\r\nI am pleased to say that Kenya was among the\r\nfirst countries to accede to the Mechanism. We note\r\nwith satisfaction that 23 countries have now acceded to\r\nthe mechanism. In July this year, Graça Machel led a\r\nsupport mission to assess Kenya’s preparedness and\r\ncapacity to participate in the peer review process. The\r\nmission also ascertained the degree of participation of\r\nmajor stakeholders in the national process.\r\nMy delegation is happy to report that the Peer\r\nReview Mechanism continues to attract participation\r\nand gain acceptance by a broad spectrum of\r\nstakeholders in Kenya. My Government is committed\r\nto making the review process fully participatory.\r\nHence, the question designed to elicit information for\r\nthe review mechanism covers varied interests and a\r\nbroad spectrum of society. This will ensure that the\r\nconcept of ownership and the perception of social,\r\npolitical and corporate governance are fully entrenched\r\nin society.\r\nIn this regard, the Government is in the process\r\nof instituting a NEPAD national governing council,\r\ncomposed of civil society, the private sector and\r\nGovernment representatives, to oversee the smooth\r\nmanagement of the review process. It is hoped that our\r\nexperience with the mechanism will be shared among\r\nKenya’s peers.\r\nWhile welcoming the support accorded to the\r\nNEPAD initiative by the United Nations and the Group\r\nof Eight, we note that the commitments made to\r\nNEPAD have not been fully realized. We call upon our\r\ndevelopment partners to fulfil their pledges.\r\nMalaria, which ranks among the world’s most\r\nserious tropical parasitic diseases, causes more deaths\r\nthan any other communicable disease. Moreover, it\r\nremains the number-one killer of children in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa, accounting for the deaths of\r\napproximately 1 million children every year. The\r\nmortality rate for adults is comparatively lower, but\r\nfrequent debilitating attacks reduce the quality of life\r\nfor chronic sufferers.\r\nAs a signatory to the Abuja Declaration to Roll\r\nBack Malaria, Kenya has removed taxes and tariffs\r\nassociated with insecticide-treated mosquito nets. A\r\nnational malaria strategy has been put in place, which\r\nfocuses on improving malaria case management at all\r\nlevels of the health sector; reducing the risk of malaria\r\nduring pregnancy; increasing the use of insecticide-\r\ntreated mosquito nets and vector-control technologies;\r\nand responding to malaria epidemics.\r\nIn conclusion, the National Malaria Control\r\nCouncil has been reconstructed to become the Inter-\r\nAgency Coordinating Committee. This is a more\r\neffective political and financial management tool for\r\nsoliciting and directing investment to roll back malaria\r\nin Kenya. The Government intends to reduce morbidity\r\nand mortality by 30 per cent among Kenya’s\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\npopulation by the 2006 and to sustain improved levels\r\nof control through to 2010.\r\nWe welcome the announcement by the World\r\nHealth Organization’s strategy coordinator for the Roll\r\nBack Malaria Campaign that trials carried out in\r\nMozambique indicate that a malaria vaccine is\r\nbeginning to yield promising results. That would be a\r\nmajor breakthrough for combating one of the most\r\ndevastating diseases affecting development. We are\r\ngrateful to our development partners and to the United\r\nNations Global Fund for both technical and financial\r\nsupport in fighting communicable diseases.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): My delegation\r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his two\r\nreports on the items we are discussing today, namely,\r\nthose on the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) and on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nMy delegation also wishes to associate itself with\r\nthe statement made by the representative of Nigeria on\r\nbehalf of the African Union and by the representative\r\nof Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nIn his report on NEPAD, the Secretary-General\r\nhighlights the policy measures and actions taken by\r\nAfrican countries and institutions to implement the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development and\r\nacknowledges that African countries have underlined\r\nthe significance that they attach to the priorities of\r\nNEPAD by earmarking financial allocations to those\r\npriorities, which also gives practical expression to the\r\nprinciple of African ownership.\r\nAt the same time, the Secretary-General points\r\nout the severe constraints and challenges faced by the\r\nPartnership. It is clear that, despite all the actions and\r\ncommitments by the African countries and institutions,\r\nthe main constraint remains the lack of resources,\r\nfinancial or otherwise. It is evident that, in order for\r\nNEPAD to succeed, it needs to become a true\r\npartnership between Africa and the rest of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWhile the Secretary-General’s report highlights\r\nwhat has been done by the international community, it\r\nconcludes that that is not enough. The report\r\nspecifically refers to the challenge of the coherence of\r\npolicy actions, and it correctly states that the intention\r\nwould be to lead to increased and effective aid,\r\nreformed trade policies and debt relief by developed\r\ncountries for Africa. We are pleased to see the\r\nreference, in paragraph 36, to the need to “incorporate\r\nmore explicitly the impact of debt-servicing on the\r\nfinancing requirements for meeting the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals”, as that is in line with the spirit\r\nbehind the inclusion of debt relief in the Monterrey\r\nConsensus and its treatment as a source of resources to\r\nobtain the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nMy delegation believes that the challenge of\r\npolicy coherence can flow naturally only from clear\r\npolitical will and a determined commitment to assist\r\nand contribute to the well-being of the people of\r\nAfrica. In this regard, my delegation appreciates the\r\nestablishment of the Secretary-General’s Advisory\r\nPanel on International Support for the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development. We look forward to its\r\neventual assessment of the scope and adequacy of\r\ninternational support for NEPAD and recommendations\r\non actions to be taken by the international community\r\nto enhance support for NEPAD’s implementation.\r\nThat laudable initiative is fully in keeping with\r\nthe notion that the United Nations is one of the pillars\r\nof international support for NEPAD and that it has a\r\nkey role to play in mobilizing such support. These\r\nideas were, in fact, inherent in the declaration and first\r\nresolution on NEPAD, adopted during the fifty-seventh\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nIt should, therefore, come as no surprise that my\r\ndelegation is somewhat perplexed by the sentiment\r\nunderlying the language used in the conclusions and\r\nrecommendations contained in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport (A/59/206). The report refers to further efforts\r\nAfrica will “need to make” (ibid., para. 67) but when\r\naddressing the role of the development partners of\r\nAfrica, the report only suggests that the partners “can\r\ngive further practical expression to their support”\r\n(ibid., para. 68).\r\nWe find this aspect of the report unfortunate,\r\nsince the United Nations is supposed to play a key role\r\nin mobilizing international support, and its language\r\nshould not be more prescriptive to the countries of\r\nAfrica than to the rest of the international community.\r\nMore specific actions must be directed at addressing\r\nthe particular needs of Africa, which were so well\r\ncaptured in the Millennium Declaration and clearly\r\nspelled out in the NEPAD programme.\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nWe look forward to a strong effort by the United\r\nNations to generate international support for the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD, to assist it in becoming a\r\ntrue partnership, as intended by its designers and\r\nproponents. Already, an Asian and African summit will\r\nbe held in Indonesia in May 2005 to further strengthen\r\nthe ties between the two subregions. The Asian-African\r\nSub-Regional Organizations Conference, better known\r\nas AASROC, will observe the golden jubilee of the\r\n1955 Asia-Africa Conference that was held in\r\nBandung, Indonesia, and led to, among other things,\r\nthe formation of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nOn the issue of the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa, my delegation wishes to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for his thorough and\r\ncomprehensive report (A/59/285). It correctly\r\nhighlights the progress that has been made in\r\naddressing conflicts and civil strife on the continent\r\nsince the Secretary-General’s original report on these\r\nissues in 1998 (A/52/871). The Secretary-General\r\npoints out how the prevalence of conflicts on the\r\nAfrican continent has been reduced over the past six\r\nyears. He also highlights the efforts of Africa and the\r\ninternational community to improve Africa’s ability\r\nnot only to deal with conflict prevention, but also with\r\npeacekeeping and post-conflict reconstruction on the\r\ncontinent.\r\nThe report acknowledges that the African Union\r\nis playing an effective role in the management and\r\nresolution of conflicts on the African continent through\r\nthe creation of structures within the African Union,\r\nsuch as the Peace and Security Council, as well as\r\nthrough the African Union’s subregional organizations.\r\nA challenge that remains in this area is to clarify the\r\nrelationship between the African structures and their\r\nefforts, and the support of the international community.\r\nIn that regard, the provision of the requisite moral and\r\nmaterial support by the international community to\r\nAfrican efforts remains to be addressed.\r\nAnother very important challenge highlighted in\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General is the need to\r\naddress post-conflict peacebuilding and development\r\nand the financing of the recovery effort. The\r\nintroduction of multidisciplinary peacekeeping\r\nmandates is already a move in the right direction, and\r\nit prepares the way for post-conflict peace\r\nconsolidation. It is essential that populations see a\r\npeace dividend resulting from the end of conflict and\r\nthat the post-conflict authorities be empowered to\r\naddress the needs of the population. This is critical in\r\nthe effort to avoid a relapse into conflict and civil\r\ninstability.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to see the specific\r\nreferences by the Secretary-General in his report to the\r\nsituations in Guinea-Bissau and Burundi and the role\r\nplayed by the World Bank and the International\r\nMonetary Fund (IMF) in addressing the dire needs of\r\nboth countries. As I had the honour to chair the\r\nEconomic and Social Council Ad Hoc Advisory\r\nGroups on Guinea-Bissau and Burundi, I wish to\r\nconfirm the Secretary-General’s observation about the\r\nflexibility and foresight demonstrated by the IMF and\r\nWorld Bank in their dealings with Guinea-Bissau and\r\nBurundi. The responses by the donor community to the\r\nchallenges faced by the two countries has,\r\nunfortunately, not yet been sufficient to consolidate\r\ntheir post-conflict recovery.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council’s ad hoc\r\nadvisory groups have also found a very receptive\r\npartner in the Security Council and its Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group on Conflict Prevention and Resolution\r\nin Africa. This has led to these two Charter bodies —\r\nthe Economic and Social Council and the Security\r\nCouncil — searching for ways to bridge the gap\r\nbetween peace and development and addressing the\r\nsocio-economic and political sides of post-conflict\r\nreconstruction in a coherent manner, in accordance\r\nwith their respective mandates under the Charter. This\r\neffort is already delivering positive results and holds\r\nexciting prospects for the future.\r\nMy delegation supports the Secretary-General’s\r\nconclusion that, for the consolidation of peace and\r\nsecurity and the creation of conditions for sustainable\r\ndevelopment, the international community must engage\r\nmore seriously in the fight against poverty on the\r\nAfrican continent. We thus welcome his assertion that\r\nit has become urgent to accelerate the implementation\r\nof NEPAD through strong support by the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nMy delegation also agrees with the notion that\r\nstronger cooperation is needed between the United\r\nNations, the African Union and the regional and\r\nsubregional organizations on the continent. We\r\ntherefore appreciate the Secretary-General’s instruction\r\nto the relevant agencies and other elements of the\r\nUnited Nations system to look into new ways to\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\ncollaborate with the African Union. My delegation is\r\nconvinced that these global institutions will find a very\r\nwilling partner in the Africa.\r\nMr. De La Sablière (France) (spoke in French):\r\nToday, we are gathered for the annual meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the subject of Africa. It is natural\r\nand satisfying that the subject of Africa should find a\r\nspecial place among the priorities of our universal\r\nbody at a time when its agenda is becoming stronger\r\nand more coherent. The debate that brings us together\r\nunder your authority, Mr. President, and the activities\r\norganized this week illustrate both the dynamic process\r\ncreated by the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which is an initiative by the\r\nAfrican countries, and our joint commitment to further\r\nstrengthen our partnership with Africa.\r\nThe past year, we are pleased to say, has seen\r\nnumerous initiatives and concrete activities carried out\r\nin the first instance by the African countries\r\nthemselves, as well as by their partners and by the\r\nUnited Nations system. The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/59/206) clearly sets forth those decisions\r\nand measures. Its recommendations urge us to consider\r\nthem in depth, to make them more consistent and to\r\nidentify priorities. France, for its part, is resolved to\r\nimplement those recommendations.\r\nThe Dutch presidency of the European Union just\r\nreminded us of Europeans’ commitment to support\r\nprojects defined by African countries with regard to\r\npeace and security, good governance, economic and\r\nsocial progress and environmental protection. The\r\npresidency rightly stressed how Africa is, more than\r\never before, at the heart of our common development\r\npolicy. France’s constant efforts are naturally within\r\nthat framework.\r\nAfrica and the challenges it is facing are also top\r\ninternational priorities. The principles and objectives\r\ndefined at the Millennium Summit commit all of us\r\neverywhere, but we know what is particularly at stake\r\nin Africa. NEPAD was endorsed and supported by the\r\npartnership of the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development, held at Monterrey, and by\r\nthe actions decided upon at the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, held at Johannesburg. The\r\ninternational financial institutions are also\r\nstrengthening their activities in Africa. At the World\r\nTrade Organization, States are beginning to understand\r\nAfrica’s particular characteristics.\r\nAs for the Group of Eight (G-8), it has tried for\r\nseveral years to mobilize the international community\r\naround initiatives aimed primarily at benefiting African\r\ncountries. I am thinking in particular of the debt of\r\npoor countries, official development assistance or the\r\nfight against HIV/AIDS. At Genoa in 2001, at\r\nKananaskis in 2002 and at Evian last year, the G-8 lent\r\nits full support to initiatives of African countries and,\r\nof course, to NEPAD. The General Assembly\r\nrecognized that positive contribution. This year, the\r\nSea Island Summit once again referred to it. France is\r\npleased that the future British presidency has placed\r\nAfrica at the top of its priorities.\r\nAmong all the achievements of the past\r\n12 months related to NEPAD, I should like to highlight\r\nfour particular points.\r\nFirst, visible progress has been made in\r\nimplementing the peace and security component. The\r\nrelevant institutional architecture is being put in place.\r\nThe African Union Commission is playing a decisive\r\nrole in that regard, with the full cooperation of the\r\nMember States and regional organizations concerned.\r\nThat progress also results from the remarkable\r\ncooperation between Africans and their partners.\r\nFrance has strongly contributed to that cooperation by\r\nparticipating in preventive and peacebuilding efforts,\r\nstrengthening African peacekeeping capacities and\r\nsupporting regional organizations. The European\r\nUnion — as its presidency just reminded us — has\r\nestablished a peace facility that has already been\r\nallocated 250 million. However, further efforts are\r\nneeded. The African Union must be able to benefit\r\nfrom predictable assistance in the long term, not only\r\nas immediate needs arise. Coordination and\r\ncomplementarity among the African Union, regional\r\norganizations, the United Nations and donors must be\r\nimproved in this area.\r\nFinally, France believes that the international\r\ncommunity, in addition to financing peacekeeping\r\noperations, should create a tool to help countries\r\nemerging from crisis situations to cover the expenses\r\nincurred in the fragile period between conflict and\r\npost-conflict situations. As we see today in several\r\nAfrican countries, such needs are significant, early and\r\nsimultaneous. I am thinking, for example, of the\r\nprocess of disarmament, demobilization and\r\nreintegration or the restoration of State governmental\r\nfunctions and basic public services. It is no longer\r\npossible to improvise ad hoc solutions, as we are doing\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\ntoo often. France hopes that the discussions on that\r\nsubject bear fruit as quickly as possible.\r\nSecondly, the Peer Review Mechanism is\r\ngradually being established and becoming a reality.\r\nFrance naturally encourages this innovation within\r\nNEPAD and welcomes the commitment of the first\r\ncountries to be volunteers. We are following with\r\ninterest the dialogue and exchanges that are taking\r\nplace. Furthermore, we have some experience with that\r\ntype of mechanism in the European Union and in the\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment, and we know what is at stake. The Peer\r\nReview Mechanism is the African countries’\r\ninstrument. We also know the role it is playing in the\r\nstrengthened partnership between NEPAD and the\r\ndonor countries.\r\nMy third point concerns economic and social\r\ndevelopment. Here, efforts are numerous and\r\nsignificant. I should simply like to mention some\r\npriorities defined by NEPAD that we strongly support,\r\ntogether with the European Union, the United Nations\r\nand the G-8. Those priorities — which are both\r\ninterdependent and crucial for one another’s success —\r\nare the fight against HIV/AIDS and other major\r\ndiseases, education, employment, agriculture, water\r\nand sanitation, environmental protection and\r\ninfrastructures, particularly regional ones. For each of\r\nthose priorities, plans and projects are being developed\r\nwithin NEPAD; we hope that they will be supported.\r\nFrance’s official development assistance has espoused\r\nthose priorities. As far as Africa is concerned, we have,\r\nin a way, become “NEPAD-ized”.\r\nMy fourth and last point concerns financing for\r\ndevelopment, which is essential for the success of\r\nNEPAD and of African countries. France particularly\r\nwelcomes the increase in official development\r\nassistance throughout the world in recent years. We are\r\nmaking our contribution: the commitment to attain 0.5\r\nper cent of our gross domestic product in 2007 will be\r\nachieved, perhaps even before that date. The objective\r\nis then to reach 0.7 per cent in 2012, as announced by\r\nthe President of the French Republic. France\r\nencourages this movement at the global level, where at\r\nleast 50 per cent should go to Africa. The continent is\r\nalready and by far the prime beneficiary of our effort.\r\nDebt relief efforts are also continuing. Here\r\nagain, France has sought, inter alia, to participate fully\r\nin the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative. At\r\nthe Paris Club and at the International Monetary Fund,\r\nFrance called for a two-year extension of the initiative\r\nand for serious discussions on the viability of debt and\r\non taking external shocks into account. Those efforts\r\nshould now bear fruit and enable us to release fresh\r\nresources for development.\r\nIn that context, I should also like to mention\r\ntrade. Fortunately, the Geneva framework agreement\r\nrelaunched the Doha round; the European Union’s\r\nproposals played an essential role in that regard.\r\nFrance argues that development remains the objective\r\nof the round and that all developing countries can truly\r\nbenefit from its results. The poorest countries — many\r\nof which, sadly, are African — must preserve and\r\nincrease their share of the market, rather than the\r\nreverse. In that connection, France and the European\r\nUnion have made proposals related to market access,\r\nexport subsidies for agricultural products and the\r\nproblem of commodities. We hope that other partners\r\nwill join us.\r\nFinally, it is increasingly recognized that progress\r\nis needed on all those fronts, but that such progress\r\nwill remain insufficient. As an impressive number of\r\nheads of State or Government observed on 20\r\nSeptember 2004, the time has come to look at new\r\nresources for development that are additional, stable\r\nand predictable. France has been working with Brazil,\r\nChile and Spain to identify technically feasible and\r\neconomically realistic options. Each of them would\r\nenable us to release substantial funds for the fight\r\nagainst hunger and poverty. In that connection, I would\r\nlike to point out that a briefing and dialogue will be\r\ntaking place this afternoon with the representatives of\r\nthat group of four countries. Mr. Landau will be taking\r\npart in that meeting on behalf of France.\r\nThree years after its inception, NEPAD has\r\nbecome the principle, and perhaps even the unique,\r\nreference framework for the development of the\r\nAfrican continent and its funding — both for African\r\ncountries themselves, and also for their bilateral and\r\nmultilateral partners. Support for NEPAD must\r\ncontinue to benefit from all of our energy and it must\r\nbecome a long-term endeavour. That is why France has\r\ntaken the initiative of creating a “Forum for\r\nPartnership with Africa”. That Forum met for the first\r\ntime in November 2003 in Paris, then in Maputo in\r\nApril of this year, and the third meeting was held at the\r\nbeginning of this month in Washington. The next\r\nmeeting is planned for Abuja next year. That Forum\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nwill support and work with African countries in all\r\nthose areas and it has, in our view, already proven its\r\nvalue.\r\nThe support of the United Nations system is\r\nessential. In that respect, I would like to pay tribute to\r\nthe untiring efforts of the Secretary-General and his\r\nSpecial Advisor. The specialized agencies are\r\nsupporting nascent institutions and regional\r\norganizations. They are aligning their priorities with\r\nthose of NEPAD. Their efforts are welcome, but they\r\nmust be supplemented. The United Nations must, more\r\nthan ever, turn its actions towards supporting policies,\r\ncoordinating activities in the field, mobilizing the\r\ninternational community, facilitating the coherent\r\norganization of its work, and following up on its\r\nresults.\r\nThe task is indeed immense. But, we must\r\nmobilize ourselves and remain determined, so that the\r\ncommitments become realities for the benefit of all\r\nthose who are suffering. Next year will be an\r\nanniversary of the United Nations and a development\r\nyear and, obviously therefore, it will be Africa’s year.\r\nThe meeting of heads of State and Government here in\r\nSeptember 2005 offers us an opportunity to show the\r\nworld that poverty, hunger and disease are not\r\ninevitabilities, and that cooperation among nations can\r\novercome them. This movement has been started. We\r\nshall stand by your side, Sir, in seeing that they\r\nsucceed.\r\nMr. Aboul Atta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, my delegation would like to express its thanks\r\nand appreciation to those who contributed to preparing\r\nfor today’s session to discuss very important issues for\r\nAfrica, which represent a major element of the United\r\nNations urgent African agenda: the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD), the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa, as well as\r\ncombating malaria.\r\nI would like to stress our support for the two\r\nstatements — one by Nigeria on behalf of the African\r\nUnion, and the other by Qatar on behalf of the Group\r\nof 77 and China — calling on the international\r\ncommunity to make every possible effort with respect\r\nto the NEPAD initiative so that it can become an\r\nenlightened African vision for dealing with the issues\r\nand problems that face our continent and for finding\r\nappropriate solutions for them. NEPAD’s work is based\r\non African ownership of the present and the future of\r\nthe continent’s peoples, and on Africa’s responsibility\r\nfor carrying out a comprehensive strategy, provided by\r\nNEPAD, in order to deal with all of the urgent\r\npriorities that have been agreed upon.\r\nThe report indicates that last year we saw\r\nprogress made in establishing sectoral policy\r\nframeworks, implementing specific programmes and\r\nprojects, and determining certain sectors as priorities\r\nfor NEPAD. Despite the fact that some sectors, such as\r\ntransportation, water, sanitation and energy, have made\r\nsome progress, some important and vital sectors, such\r\nas education and health care, still face obstacles and\r\nchallenges. In the agricultural sector, which represents\r\nthe axis of NEPAD’s work, in the light of the\r\ndependence of African economies on it, the desired\r\nlevel of countries allocating 10 per cent of their budget\r\nresources to agriculture in the next five years has not\r\nbeen met. In addition, there has been a fall in\r\ninternational assistance and subsidies provided to\r\nagriculture in Africa.\r\nAs we deal with the agricultural sector in Africa\r\nand the constraints and problems it faces, we must not\r\nignore the relationship between the possibilities of\r\ndevelopment in that sector and what had been agreed to\r\nduring the Doha round of international trade\r\nnegotiations. One of the most important elements in\r\nthat agreement is the commitment of developed\r\ncountries to put an end to subsidies for agricultural\r\nexports. Another is to begin negotiations on ending\r\ntrade tariffs on cotton. The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral concludes, and this is the matter that we would\r\nlike to underline, that, despite the central role of the\r\nUnited Nations in making NEPAD a success, it faces\r\nconstraints and difficulties in its support of the\r\ninitiative. The most important of those problems is the\r\nlack of additional resources to finance NEPAD and the\r\nfact that donor countries and stakeholders have yet to\r\ntake specific steps to give impetus to NEPAD. Those\r\nsteps are particularly needed now, since African States\r\nhave shown their practical commitment to moving\r\nNEPAD forward by allocating financial resources for\r\nselected priority sectors.\r\nMy delegation would still like to emphasize the\r\npivotal role and contribution of the United Nations in\r\nthe area of peacebuilding and peacekeeping in Africa,\r\nparticularly in providing the technical and financial\r\nresources necessary to increase internal African\r\ncapabilities in that area. It is clear that Africa has taken\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nconcrete steps to enhance its ownership of ways and\r\nmeans of dealing with the sources of threat to its peace\r\nand security. This was emphasized in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General concerning the causes of conflict\r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa. The Peace and Security\r\nCouncil of the African Union has ably and effectively\r\ncontinued its efforts in the continent to set up a rapid\r\nresponse force to help stop situations from escalating\r\npolitically and militarily and on the humanitarian level\r\nand from leading to heavier burdens on Africa. It is\r\nstill important for the international community to show\r\nmore attention to and effectiveness in its commitment\r\nto support African internal efforts, as was underlined in\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General. Clearly, we have\r\nheard initiatives and pledges that are encouraging in\r\nthat direction by some of the industrial Group of Eight\r\n(G-8), the European Union and other countries. We call\r\non States to implement their pledges and commitments\r\nas quickly as possible. My delegation would like to\r\nemphasize two elements here: logistical support and\r\ntraining for African States in peacekeeping tasks. We\r\nwould like to see a close trilateral coordinating\r\nrelationship between the United Nations, the donor\r\nStates and the African Union in order to set up an\r\nintegrated implementation strategy to translate political\r\nand moral support into concrete steps with a clear\r\ntimetable.\r\nI would once again like to emphasize that the\r\nways of dealing with conflicts in Africa should not\r\nbegin and end with merely traditional elements of\r\npeacekeeping. We should give special importance to\r\nthe process of making and building peace. And, we\r\nwould like, within the framework of the United\r\nNations, to have a common vision of how to apply\r\nregional mechanisms for early warning systems. We\r\ncall for putting in place a clear vision of the elements\r\nof peacebuilding within the peacekeeping missions on\r\nthe African continent — particularly those elements\r\nthat overlap the mandates of peacebuilding and\r\npeacekeeping, such as programmes for disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and reintegration (DDR) of ex-\r\ncombatants. Here, we envision a clear relationship\r\nbetween the main organs of the United Nations, as well\r\nas coordination of those bodies and United Nations\r\nprogrammes for providing relief, rehabilitation and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe main challenge inn dealing with African\r\nconflicts lies in dealing with post-conflict situations,\r\nwhich involves programmes aimed at reconciliation\r\nand interrelated political, economic, social and\r\nadministrative development. My delegation welcomes\r\nthe fact that the Secretary-General has addressed the\r\nvery important aspects of durable and comprehensive\r\npeace in Africa. In this context, we would like to\r\nunderline the fact that the degree of success in bringing\r\nabout a comprehensive and durable peace is dependent\r\non the financial support provided by the committed\r\ninternational community to African countries emerging\r\nfrom conflict, with a view to building on the progress\r\nachieved in the security and political areas.\r\nThe international community fully understands\r\nthe gravity of the threat posed by malaria and its\r\nspread, not just to the physical health of a large part of\r\nhumanity, regardless of their nationalities, but also to\r\ntheir economic, social and political well-being. Africa,\r\nof which Egypt is a part, is the continent the worst\r\naffected by malaria and it spends about 40 per cent of\r\nits health-care budgets combating the disease. Malaria\r\nreduces the rate of development on the continent by 1.3\r\nper cent each year.\r\nAll of those elements underline the fact that we\r\ncannot ignore that serious disease that impedes\r\ndevelopment efforts and eliminates appropriate\r\nopportunities for bringing about real economic\r\ndevelopment in Africa. Estimates suggest that malaria\r\nis the disease responsible for the largest number of\r\ndeaths in the world. Therefore, we have two\r\nresponsibilities in facing it. First and foremost, is the\r\nhumanitarian responsibility, since this disease can be\r\ncontained and treated. The second responsibility is a\r\npolitical and economic one. Developing countries will\r\nnot be able to achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, to which we all aspire, if we do not contain this\r\ndisease. The choice to combat malaria is not difficult;\r\nimplementation is the real challenge for international\r\ncollective efforts.\r\nMr. Lahiri (India): We would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his second consolidated report\r\non progress in the implementation of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and\r\nfor his report on the implementation of\r\nrecommendations contained in his report on the causes\r\nof conflict and promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa. We also thank him\r\nfor transmitting the report entitled “2001-2010: Decade\r\nto Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries,\r\nparticularly in Africa”.\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nWe associate ourselves with the statement made\r\nby the representative of Qatar on behalf of the Group\r\nof 77.\r\nBy 2002, official development assistance to\r\nAfrica had reached $22.23 billion. According to\r\npreliminary data, developed countries increased their\r\nofficial development assistance by 3.9 per cent in real\r\nterms between 2002 and 2003. The need for a further\r\neffort to increase official development assistance to\r\nAfrica has been highlighted in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport. Official development assistance is important for\r\nthe low-income countries, especially the least\r\ndeveloped countries, among them highly-indebted poor\r\ncountries, in their efforts to achieve the targets of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. The possibility of\r\nincreased funding for the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries (HIPC) Debt Initiative — an outcome of the\r\nGroup of Eight summit of June 2004 — is a welcome\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe have consistently held that Africa knows its\r\nown problems best, as well as the solutions to those\r\nproblems. The African countries have demonstrated\r\ntheir commitment to advancing the implementation of\r\nNEPAD by earmarking financial allocations to selected\r\nsectoral priorities. Africa needs support for the\r\nsolutions that it has identified. The Secretary-General\r\nhas highlighted the need for further practical\r\nexpression of the support by Africa’s development\r\npartners for the efforts of the African countries.\r\nSignificant additional outlays are called for.\r\nIndia’s commitment to Africa’s development is\r\nborn of the deep historical bond that exists between the\r\npeoples of India and Africa. Not only has India been\r\ntrading with Africa for centuries, but we shared the\r\npains of colonialism together. The father of our nation,\r\nMahatma Gandhi, drew his initial inspiration for\r\nIndia’s freedom struggle from the continent of Africa.\r\nToday, as in the past, we remain committed to working\r\ntogether with African countries as partners for the\r\nprogress and prosperity of the peoples of Africa, as\r\nwell as for strengthening the forces of democracy and\r\nstability.\r\nOur commitment to Africa’s development has\r\nbeen reflected in concrete contributions made in a\r\nnumber of areas. Indian soldiers have contributed to\r\nAfrican security through United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations. India has been contributing in the area of\r\nhuman resource development through the training of\r\npersonnel and the provision of experts to several\r\nAfrican countries. India has been extending its\r\ncooperation to several countries in the form of supplies\r\nof food grains, sugar and medicine, including anti-\r\nretroviral drugs to fight HIV/AIDS. India provided\r\nnearly 100,000 tons of food aid last year to African\r\ncountries adversely affected by drought. Cooperation\r\nbetween India and Africa today covers diverse areas,\r\nranging from the development of infrastructure, such\r\nas railways, to information and communication\r\ntechnologies.\r\nIndia has proposed a connectivity mission — for\r\nelectronic connectivity and knowledge connectivity —\r\namong the African nations, to facilitate the economic\r\nconnectivity of the region. To that end, a programme to\r\nconnect all the 53 nations of the African Union by a\r\nsatellite and a fibre-optic network is envisaged. Apart\r\nfrom providing effective communication and\r\nconnectivity among the nations, the same link will\r\nsupport tele-education, tele-medicine, e-governance,\r\ne-commerce, infotainment, resource-mapping and\r\nmeteorological services. This network will give rural\r\nareas connectivity to the African Union — an effective\r\nway to use space technology to provide democratic\r\naccess and empowerment.\r\nIndia has decided to provide a seamless and\r\nintegrated satellite, fibre-optic and wireless network\r\nconnecting 53 African countries for a range of\r\ne-services. It will connect five universities, 53 learning\r\ncentres, 10 super-specialty hospitals and 53 remote-end\r\nlocations for patients in rural areas. Installation, initial\r\noperation and maintenance for three years will cost\r\nabout $50 million. It will be in place within three\r\nyears, and all the African nations participating in the\r\nnetwork will be able to reap the full benefits.\r\nIndia has developed closer institutional\r\nengagements with the African Union, the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community and NEPAD. The\r\nGovernment of India announced a contribution of $200\r\nmillion for engagement with NEPAD projects, in a\r\ncombination of concessional loans and credits,\r\nincluding a grant element for training, the provision of\r\nconsultants and the preparation of project feasibility\r\nstudies. To give further impetus to India’s relations\r\nwith West Africa, a new group has been formed, called\r\nTEAM-9 — the Techno-Economic Approach for\r\nAfrica-India Movement. A symbol of South-South\r\ncooperation, TEAM-9 is directed at the transfer of\r\ntechnology to Western African countries, involving the\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nsharing of various types of expertise and intellectual\r\nand physical resources, as well as economic\r\nopportunities for promoting welfare growth and the\r\nprosperity of the people. It will also involve providing\r\nopportunities for education and training in crucial\r\nsectors.\r\nThe gloomy picture of armed conflict and civil\r\nstrife in Africa has changed dramatically and positively\r\nover the past six years. We share the satisfaction and\r\nsense of optimism of the African nations themselves at\r\nthis development, and particularly at the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s observation that most African countries\r\ntoday enjoy relatively stable political conditions, are\r\ngoverned by democratically elected regimes, and are\r\nconcentrating their efforts on economic reconstruction\r\nand on combating poverty and underdevelopment.\r\nWe are sympathetic to the need for immediate\r\npeace dividends in the post-conflict recovery phase,\r\nwhich would help give rise to a better appreciation of\r\nthe benefits of peace. We are therefore concerned to\r\nnote the slow progress in poverty reduction, despite the\r\ngreat effort made by African countries to implement\r\nNEPAD and to create an enabling environment for\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development.\r\nThe worsening conditions for young people\r\nowing to high unemployment are a potential threat to\r\npeace and stability. These challenges need to be faced\r\nurgently to consolidate the gains achieved in the\r\nimmediate post-conflict period.\r\nThe funding facility set up by India, Brazil and\r\nSouth Africa (IBSA) on the margins of the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, as an initiative\r\ncomplementary to other ongoing efforts of the\r\ninternational community to combat poverty and\r\nhunger, has made its own contribution by recently\r\nlaunching the first project to be financed by the IBSA\r\nFund, in support of agriculture and livestock\r\ndevelopment in Guinea-Bissau. The project\r\nencompasses activities aimed at the eradication of\r\npoverty and hunger, as a contribution to the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe IBSA facility has thus begun its contribution to\r\nAfrica and to enhancing South-South Cooperation.\r\nIt is unfortunate that malaria continues to plague\r\nseveral regions of the world, particularly many parts of\r\nAfrica, even after a nearly century-long campaign\r\nagainst that disease, which kills more than a million\r\npeople a year, including 700,000 children.\r\nThe fight against malaria has been made more\r\ndifficult by the emergence of strains with resistance\r\ntowards available effective and affordable anti-malarial\r\nmedicines and insecticides. Such resistance has now\r\nreached unacceptably high levels in Africa, and a\r\nmulti-drug-resistant malaria strain has been widely\r\nprevalent in South-East Asia and South America.\r\nDiseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS\r\nincapacitate the workforce, decrease economic\r\nproductivity and reduce output. In African countries,\r\nmalarial infection has been estimated to be responsible\r\nfor slowing down economic growth by about 1.3 per\r\ncent per year. In rural areas, where the malaria\r\ntransmission season generally coincides with the\r\nplanting or harvesting season, this imposes a dual\r\nburden on the poor: they not only lose wages but also\r\nneed to spend their meagre resources on medical\r\ntreatment and health care. The human suffering and\r\neconomic loss caused by malaria are unnecessary, as\r\nthe disease is preventable, treatable and curable.\r\nAlthough financial investments have increased\r\nrapidly over the past few years, only about one quarter\r\nof the amount needed to effectively combat malaria in\r\nAfrica alone is currently available. Allocation of\r\nsufficient resources is imperative in the context of the\r\nMillennium Development Goal targets to be achieved\r\nby the affected countries.\r\nMr. Chulkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The Russian Federation views the\r\nstrengthening of stability on the African continent as\r\nan integral part of the international community’s effort\r\nto build, under the auspices of the United Nations, a\r\nglobal system to counter new threats and challenges.\r\nWe will not be able to achieve a harmonious\r\ndevelopment of international relations if Africa, one of\r\nthe largest international communities, remains\r\npolitically, socially, economically and ethnically\r\nseismic.\r\nWe are pleased to note that the countries and\r\nregional organizations of Africa are making serious\r\nefforts to settle conflicts by encouraging peace talks\r\nand peace agreements in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, the Sudan,\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea.\r\nWe support the new approach in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping practice, to ensure close interaction\r\namong United Nations missions working in\r\nneighbouring African States. It is important to ensure\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\ncoordination in that work. Here, however, we should be\r\nparticularly careful: coordinated activities of United\r\nNations forces should be based on the principle of full\r\nrespect for the sovereignty of individual States and\r\nshould not go beyond the mandates defined for each\r\nmission.\r\nWe welcome proposals on reinforcing the\r\nnational borders of African States. The Russian\r\ndelegation has pointed out on numerous occasions that\r\nspecific measures should be taken at the borders to\r\ncounter such dangerous phenomena as the trans-border\r\nspillover of conflicts; movements of illegal armed\r\ngroups, mercenaries and child soldiers; illicit arms\r\ntrafficking; and illicit natural resource exports. This\r\nmust not compromise inter-State communication, trade\r\nand economic cooperation, integration processes or\r\ncommunications among populations living in border\r\nareas.\r\nAfrica has not only accumulated a great many\r\nproblems; it has also succeeded in mobilizing a\r\ncommensurate potential for international cooperation\r\nfor the solution of those problems. It is important to\r\nmake effective and timely use of that potential.\r\nThe implementation of the social and economic\r\ndimensions of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) is gathering speed. We are\r\npleased to note the determination of African peoples to\r\npursue the objectives of NEPAD and the willingness of\r\nthe international community and of Africa’s\r\nmultilateral and bilateral development partners to\r\nrender all possible support. We view NEPAD as an\r\neffective mechanism for achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals on the continent.\r\nWe take note of the recommendations in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/59/285) addressed to the\r\npartners of African countries on the need to bring\r\nmuch-needed coherence to trade, assistance and debt\r\npolicies, and we call for coordination of the current\r\ninitiatives on Africa, which should be aimed at\r\nmobilizing efforts in support of the implementation of\r\nNEPAD.\r\nAs a member of the Group of Eight (G-8), Russia\r\nis making its own tangible contribution to the\r\nimplementation of the decisions in support of NEPAD\r\ntaken by the G-8 at its recent summit, and of measures\r\ndesigned to overcome the most urgent problems of the\r\ndeveloping countries, in particular in Africa.\r\nRussia continues focusing its assistance to Africa\r\non such important areas for the continent as debt relief\r\nwithin the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)\r\nInitiative. From 1998 to 2003, we wrote off African\r\ncountries’ debt in the total amount of about\r\n$11.3 billion. Intergovernmental agreements to settle\r\nthe debt of a number of African States were signed in\r\n2003. Russia makes a significant contribution to the\r\nHIPC Trust Fund.\r\nThe Russian Federation offers trade preferences\r\nto 50 African countries, including 29 least developed\r\ncountries, whose exports to Russia are exempt from\r\nduty. In 2003, most of the goods that Russia imported\r\nfrom Africa were imported under the preferences\r\nregime.\r\nPriority is given to professional training in the\r\ncontext of the assistance that Russia renders to African\r\nStates in the educational field. During the current year\r\nalone, Russia has provided more than 700 public\r\neducation grants to African countries. For the first\r\ntime, cooperation in this area has been extended to the\r\ntraining of personnel for subregional organizations, in\r\nparticular the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity.\r\nRussia continues to provide assistance in training\r\npersonnel for humanitarian operations. The Polytechnic\r\nCentre in the city of Kavumu, Rwanda, which was set\r\nup by Russia’s Ministry of Emergency — a project in\r\nwhich Russia invested more than $1 million — has\r\ntrained over 1,200 drivers and mechanics, as well as\r\nprofessional search-and-rescue brigades. That centre is\r\nnow under the authority of the Rwandese people.\r\nRussia continues to provide targeted\r\nhumanitarian disaster relief assistance to African\r\ncountries. In the past two years, Russia has provided\r\nsuch assistance to Algeria, Ethiopia, Eritrea and\r\nMorocco. Last year Russia shipped $1 million in\r\nemergency food assistance to Angola through the\r\nWorld Food Programme. We also made a voluntary\r\ncontribution of $2 million to the budget of the Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees to finance humanitarian operations in Africa.\r\nAware of the urgency of problems relating to the\r\nspread of malaria in Africa and its negative effects on\r\nthe social and economic development of the continent,\r\nwe support the tireless efforts of the United Nations in\r\ncarrying out programmes to roll back that disease. That\r\nis why assistance of various kinds in the area of health\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.33\r\nis an important component of our assistance to the\r\nAfrican continent. Of its overall pledge of $20 million\r\nto the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\r\nMalaria in the period 2002-2006, Russia has to date\r\npaid $7.5 million. In response to the appeal of the\r\nGroup of Eight partners, Russia has joined the Global\r\nPolio Eradication Initiative, and to date $3 million has\r\nbeen provided the World Health Organization for its\r\nimplementation.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to point out that the\r\nAfrican continent continues to face numerous problems,\r\nincluding in the economic and social areas. However, the\r\ncommitment of African countries to the implementation\r\nof NEPAD, with a view to achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015, requires that all of us show\r\nsolidarity with the peoples of the continent. Russia\r\nintends to continue effectively to participate in joint\r\nefforts to promote the development of African States.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n"
