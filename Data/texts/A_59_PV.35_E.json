(Gabon)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Kafando\r\n(Burkina Faso), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda items 38 and 46 (continued)\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress\r\nin implementation and international support\r\n(a) New Partnership for Africa’s Development:\r\nprogress in implementation and international\r\nsupport\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/59/206)\r\n(b) Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/59/285)\r\n2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in\r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/59/261)\r\nMr. Sow (Guinea) (spoke in French): My\r\ndelegation is pleased to participate in this important\r\ndebate to discuss the second report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on progress in implementation and\r\ninternational support for the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) over the past year. We\r\nthank the Secretary-General for the high quality of the\r\ndocuments before us and Mr. Gambari for his devotion\r\nand skills at the head of the Office of the Special\r\nAdviser on Africa. We are pleased that the newly\r\nestablished Office is playing a key role in promoting\r\ninternational cooperation in meeting the challenge of\r\nNEPAD and in consolidating and extending peace,\r\nstability and progress in Africa.\r\nWe are convinced that the implementation of\r\nNEPAD’s projects remains the solution to the diverse\r\nills besetting Africa, including insecurity, armed\r\nconflict, poverty, famine, endemic diseases, the\r\ndistressing issue of refugees and displaced persons,\r\nmyriad cross-border problems and so on. Guinea is\r\nconfident in that enormous programme of renewal,\r\nwhich reaffirms Africa’s responsibility for its own\r\ndevelopment as a stakeholder in the various changes\r\nunder way today, and reaffirms its commitment to the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD as the new partnership for\r\nthe development of our continent.\r\nGuinea has thus established a national\r\ncoordinating committee for NEPAD, under the auspices\r\nof the Ministry for Cooperation. It consists of\r\nrepresentatives of the various ministerial departments\r\nconcerned, the private sector and civil society. The\r\ncoordinating committee is now at work; it has launched\r\nvarious programmes and projects in priority areas and\r\nbegun to draft sectoral policy plans. Our Government\r\nis striving to mainstream NEPAD into our national\r\ndevelopment plan and to adapt the structure of\r\nbudgetary expenditures to the priorities and objectives\r\nof NEPAD.\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nIn that regard, Guinea is encouraged by the\r\nprogress made in advancing the implementation of the\r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism. We are actively\r\npreparing to join that process, convinced that self-\r\nevaluation will help African countries to identify their\r\ndeficiencies in terms of institutions, policies and\r\ncapacities, and to propose measures — as stressed by\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report — to remedy the\r\nsituation and to attain the Millennium Development\r\nGoals.\r\nIt is clear that, if Africa is to continue to acquire\r\nownership and leadership of NEPAD, it must master\r\nthose complex problems and resolve the various\r\nconstraints that exist in all sectors. The serious\r\nfinancial, technical, economic and coordination\r\ndifficulties covered by the report help us to grasp how\r\nmuch is at stake for Africa and our partners.\r\nWe need to act quickly. We need new and\r\nrevitalized relations between Africa and its partners if\r\nwe are to reverse the current negative trends. That is\r\nwhy, in addition to Africa’s huge efforts and sacrifices,\r\nwe must continue to encourage the international\r\ncommunity to shoulder its responsibilities. Our\r\npartners must give us the economic and financial\r\nresources, expertise and transfers of technology\r\nnecessary for the speedy implementation of NEPAD’s\r\nobjectives.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the initiatives and\r\nencouraging steps taken in the context of South-South\r\ncooperation by the international community and the\r\nUnited Nations system to ensure the complete success\r\nof NEPAD. I also commend the various resolute\r\ninitiatives taken by countries or by regional and\r\ninternational institutions, private and public alike, in\r\nresponse to the appeals made at the United Nations and\r\nother decision-making bodies on behalf of Africa. My\r\ncountry is also encouraged by the sound measures\r\ntaken by our bilateral and multilateral partners to ease\r\nthe debt burden of African countries. We ought not lose\r\nsight of the fact that even those recipients of the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative that have\r\ncompleted the process have not enjoyed the relief they\r\nsought.\r\nAccordingly, we make an urgent appeal to our\r\ndevelopment partners to cancel our debt, which has\r\nbecome untenable, and to improve and enhance the\r\nquality and effectiveness of assistance to Africa, all of\r\nwhich could mobilize increased support for NEPAD\r\nand reduce poverty in Africa.\r\nGiven the myriad stakeholders involved,\r\nhowever, we have a daunting challenge to meet. We\r\nmust ensure the consistency of measures taken with\r\ninternational support for NEPAD. So long as consistent\r\npolicies are not a core element of assistance to Africa,\r\nthe partnership we seek may not be able to achieve\r\nthose basic goals. The international community must\r\nbase its actions on progress made by certain\r\ninternational bodies or by such friendly countries as\r\nSweden, Denmark and the Netherlands to promote\r\nintegrated global development based on greater\r\nconsistency and joint responsibility.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to express my country’s\r\ngratitude to its development partners, friendly\r\ncountries and the entire international community for\r\ntheir commitment to Africa at this crucial stage of its\r\ndevelopment. In order to consolidate the progress\r\nmade, my delegation advocates strengthened support\r\nfrom this Organization for the Office of the Special\r\nAdviser on Africa with a view to promoting the\r\ncoherent and effective support of the entire United\r\nNations system for the development of our continent.\r\nAdequate means and political and diplomatic support\r\nmust be forthcoming to enable us to assist the African\r\nUnion and its subregional organizations to support the\r\nefforts of the General Assembly, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and other institutions of the\r\ninternational community to discharge their respective\r\nmandates to implement NEPAD and to ensure follow-\r\nup for the implementation of decisions taken at all the\r\nsummit meetings and world conferences on Africa.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea reiterates here that it will\r\nspare none of its energies and limited resources in\r\ncontributing to the speedy realization of the noble and\r\nlegitimate objectives so dearly sought by our peoples.\r\nMr. Kim Sam-hoon (Republic of Korea): At the\r\noutset, my delegation would like to express its\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive reports on progress in implementing the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)\r\nand achieving durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nThe Republic of Korea supports Africa’s\r\nownership and leadership in implementing NEPAD. In\r\nthat regard, we are pleased to note that the past year\r\nwitnessed the firm commitments of African countries\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nto advancing the implementation of NEPAD as they\r\ndeveloped sectoral policy frameworks, implemented\r\nspecific programmes and earmarked financial\r\nallocations to selected priorities, such as infrastructure\r\nand health. At the same time, the international\r\ncommunity demonstrated its solidarity and partnership\r\nwith NEPAD through proposals and actions to facilitate\r\nits implementation. Moreover, we applaud the\r\ncontinued commitment of the United Nations system to\r\nsupporting NEPAD and we hope that the Office of the\r\nSpecial Advisor on Africa can play a greater role in\r\nenhancing the coherence, coordination and\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations in support of\r\nNEPAD. Furthermore, we welcome the steady progress\r\nachieved in peacemaking and peacekeeping in Africa.\r\nHowever, we do note with concern the\r\nassessment of the Secretary-General that progress has\r\nbeen modest and slow in democratic governance,\r\nadministrative capacity, the independence of the\r\njudiciary, transparency and accountability. We believe\r\nthat good governance based on the rule of law,\r\nparticipation, accountability and transparency is a sine\r\nqua non for sustainable development and durable peace\r\nin Africa.\r\nAccordingly, we welcome the recent development\r\nof the African Peer Review Mechanism process and we\r\nare especially pleased that the number of signatories to\r\nthe Mechanism has increased to 23. We believe that the\r\nMechanism is a very good way to put mutual\r\naccountability to work for good economic, political\r\nand corporate governance and human rights\r\nobservance. For that reason, we encourage more\r\nAfrican countries to join this important initiative and\r\nwe hope that the Mechanism will soon become fully\r\nfunctional with technical support from the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nFor our part, in order to share various experiences\r\nand practices of good governance and Government\r\nreinvention, the Republic of Korea, in close\r\ncooperation with the United Nations, will host the\r\nSixth Global Forum on Reinventing Government in\r\nMay 2005, with the theme of “Toward Participatory\r\nand Transparent Governance”. We are confident that\r\nthat forum will help all participants gain new ideas on\r\ngood governance and contribute to renewing the\r\ncommitments of the international community to\r\nbuilding good governance. We are looking forward to\r\nthe active participation of African countries in that\r\nforum.\r\nThe Republic of Korea’s development experience\r\nhas led us to the view that international trade is an\r\neffective tool through which developing countries can\r\ndevelop their economies and integrate into the world\r\neconomy. However, in order for all countries, including\r\nthose in Africa, to reap the full benefits of international\r\ntrade, it is necessary to create a more liberalized and\r\ndevelopment-friendly multilateral trading system. In\r\nthat regard, we are of the view that the successful\r\ncompletion of negotiations to fulfil the Doha\r\nDevelopment Agenda and expanded market access to\r\nAfrican products are essential. It is also vital for\r\ndeveloping countries to focus on enhancing their\r\nproduction capacities and human resource\r\ndevelopment.\r\nTo that end, the Republic of Korea has joined\r\nglobal efforts for the completion of Doha Development\r\nAgenda negotiations and expanded market access for\r\nAfrica. My Government has also provided duty-free\r\nmarket access for 87 items originating from the least\r\ndeveloped countries, the majority of which are in\r\nAfrica, making Korea the world’s fourth largest\r\nimporter of products from those countries, according to\r\nWorld Trade Organization statistics. In addition, we are\r\nconsidering further expansion of that preferential\r\ntreatment for the products of the least developed\r\ncountries.\r\nBased on our own experience, we cannot\r\noverstate the importance of human-resource building in\r\nthe development process. In that regard, the Republic\r\nof Korea has invited 1,700 African trainees, ranging\r\nfrom Government officials to academics, to study in\r\nvarious fields, including education, public\r\nadministration, health care, water supply, agriculture\r\nand trade policies. We have also dispatched 300\r\nexperts in various fields and medical doctors to African\r\ncountries since 1991.\r\nWe welcome the recent global increase in official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) towards Africa and we\r\nhope to see further efforts to increase ODA to Africa,\r\nas well as to use the increased ODA more effectively.\r\nMoreover, we would like to see further progress made\r\nto solve the debt problems of the highly indebted poor\r\ncountries in Africa. By exploring such options as debt\r\nrestructuring and debt relief, we believe that a final\r\nresolution can be achieved that will contribute to the\r\nsustained economic growth of the highly indebted poor\r\ncountries.\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nFor its part, the Republic of Korea has\r\ncontributed approximately $260 million of ODA to\r\nAfrica since 1991 and made a contribution of $10\r\nmillion to the Trust Fund of the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Initiative last year. In addition to its\r\ncontributions to Africa’s development in trade, ODA\r\nand debt relief, the Republic of Korea has joined in the\r\nglobal effort to consolidate peace and security in\r\nAfrica. Toward that end, we are currently participating\r\nin United Nations peacekeeping operations in Western\r\nSahara, Liberia and Burundi. Moreover, my\r\nGovernment has decided to make a financial\r\ncontribution to support the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme’s mine clearance\r\nprogrammes in Mozambique and Eritrea.\r\nIn conclusion, we believe that NEPAD’s\r\nimplementation process is making significant progress.\r\nHowever, the partnership between African countries\r\nand development partners needs to be further\r\nstrengthened in such a way that African countries can\r\ncontinue to maintain leadership and ownership of the\r\nimplementation process. At the same time, as the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General (A/59/206) pointed out,\r\ndevelopment partners must better assist African\r\ncountries by improving coherence in their trade,\r\nofficial development assistance and debt policies. The\r\nRepublic of Korea would like to renew its commitment\r\nto assisting the African countries in their efforts for\r\ndevelopment. We remain confident that the resolute\r\ncommitment and political will of the African countries,\r\nmatched by an effective response from the\r\ninternational community, will facilitate further progress\r\nin the implementation of NEPAD.\r\nMr. Ikouebe (Congo) (spoke in French): I will\r\nfocus my statement on the implementation of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), but\r\nfirst I would like to congratulate the Secretary-General\r\nfor the excellent report that he has presented to us\r\ntoday (A/59/206), two years after the General\r\nAssembly’s adoption of the United Nations Declaration\r\non the New Partnership for Africa’s Development in\r\nresolution 57/2. This report, issued pursuant to\r\nresolution 58/233, highlights the measures and\r\ndecisions taken by Africa in implementing NEPAD and\r\nthe support of the international community, including\r\nthe United Nations system, throughout the period under\r\nconsideration.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement\r\nmade yesterday by Nigeria on behalf of the African\r\nUnion, and it will confine itself to making some basic\r\ncomments on the various facets of Africa’s action and\r\nthe international community’s support.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General rightly notes\r\nthat Africa, over the period under consideration, has\r\nachieved notable progress, both in the area of peace\r\nand conflict resolution and in economic development.\r\nHe underscores the endeavours of African leaders who\r\nhave undertaken to build the new Africa on a strong\r\nfoundation of democracy, respect for human rights,\r\ngood governance and transparent management of\r\nnatural resources. The report attests that the message of\r\nthis new purposeful Africa, which has taken charge of\r\nits own destiny by relying on its own forces, has begun\r\nto move. We cite as proof of this the establishment and\r\noperation of mechanisms and institutions provided for\r\nin the framework of conflict management and\r\nsettlement, strengthening the rule of law and economic\r\nreforms promoting investment and growth.\r\nWe can now assert that in spite of constraints of\r\nall kinds, NEPAD is being implemented. Progress has\r\nbeen made in preparing sectoral guiding plans and in\r\nexecuting clearly identified programmes and projects.\r\nGranted, it will be difficult for many African countries\r\nto fulfil their commitment to allocate 15 per cent of\r\ntheir national budgets to health, 10 per cent to\r\nagriculture, 5 per cent to water and sanitation and so\r\nforth, but encouraging steps have been taken in\r\nexecuting priority projects affecting such vital areas as\r\ninfrastructure — with a list of 20 projects — health,\r\neducation, environment, agriculture, science and\r\ntechnology.\r\nAs the keystone of this structure, the NEPAD\r\nsecretariat takes an active part in formulating\r\ninvestment programmes for certain countries,\r\nparticularly in the area of agriculture and food, an area\r\nin which it is also assisted in carrying out a\r\ncomprehensive review of the food reserve systems\r\nacross the continent. Africa’s various regions are\r\nintegral to NEPAD’s implementation, and each of the\r\nmajor subregional communities is committed to\r\nreviewing the action to be taken, so as to better adapt\r\ntheir approaches.\r\nIn order to identify the impediments to — and\r\npropose a timetable for — the implementation of 27\r\npriority projects of a list of 83 projects selected for the\r\nCentral African subregion, a seminar bringing together\r\nexperts from 11 member countries of the Economic\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nCommunity of Central African States met on\r\n14 and 15 October in Libreville, Gabon, which\r\nprovides coordination for NEPAD in Central Africa.\r\nThe projects selected mainly concerned the building of\r\nregional roads, interconnection of electrical grids and\r\ndevelopment of water supply systems and\r\ntelecommunications.\r\nGiven all these endeavours aimed at the political\r\nand institutional facets of peace and security, as well as\r\nat economic reforms and initiatives, a number of\r\nobservers now recognize the progress made by\r\nAfrica — a gross national product growth of\r\napproximately 4 per cent in 2004 and probably 5 per\r\ncent in 2005, and a growth rate of 3 to 7 per cent in\r\nmost of the sub-Saharan African countries. However,\r\nmany observers also note that in view of the\r\npersistence of a number of negative factors, such as\r\npoverty, pandemics, unemployment and democratic\r\npressures, this growth rate needs to be higher than\r\n7 per cent per year in order to have a meaningful\r\nimpact.\r\nAfrica is therefore very mindful of the efforts that\r\nit still has to make in order to add to those already\r\nimportant steps. It likewise appreciates international\r\nsupport for the commitments it has undertaken and\r\nupheld.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General stresses the\r\nsupport that the international community, particularly\r\nthe United Nations system, is giving to the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD. Let me take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate the Office of the Special\r\nAdviser for Africa, led by Mr. Ibrahim Gambari, which\r\nis doing excellent work in terms of information,\r\npromotion and analysis in support of NEPAD. Very\r\nrecently, the current Chairman of the African Union,\r\nMr. Olusegun Obasanjo, urged the Security Council to\r\nstrengthen that Office, which should receive all the\r\nmeans necessary for its operation, given the role it is\r\ncalled upon to play and the expectations invested in it.\r\nI wish above all to pay tribute to the invaluable\r\ncontribution of the whole of the United Nations system\r\nto the implementation of NEPAD in its various facets,\r\nand I stress that additional financial resources should\r\nbe allocated to the entire system and its agencies, so as\r\nto enhance the commitment to implementing the\r\nprogrammes adopted. Moreover, it is important for the\r\ncommitments undertaken under the Monterrey\r\nConsensus to be realized in the form of an increase in\r\nofficial development assistance, which would help to\r\nfinance NEPAD’s projects. Likewise, efforts must be\r\ncontinued to relieve and cancel the debts of the poorest\r\nAfrican countries.\r\nMindful as we are of the urgent need for external\r\nsupport, we wish to thank all our partners from outside\r\nthe continent. We convey to them here our warmest\r\ngratitude, which they have earned through their\r\nconstant commitment that encourages us to undertake\r\ngreater sacrifices.\r\nLastly, we look forward with great interest to the\r\nconclusions of the panel of eminent persons that the\r\nSecretary-General has set up with a view to enhancing\r\nthe international community’s support for NEPAD.\r\nMr. Talbot (Guyana): Guyana is most pleased to\r\nassociate itself with the statements made by the\r\ndelegation of Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina and by Barbados on behalf of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations in the present debate on “The New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development: progress in\r\nimplementation and international support”.\r\nThe item under consideration today is of special\r\nsignificance to my delegation given Guyana’s\r\nlongstanding ties of history, cooperation and solidarity\r\nwith the countries of Africa. We are therefore grateful\r\nfor the opportunity to voice our support for the efforts\r\nbeing made to promote durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment on the continent.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s reports, contained in\r\ndocuments A/59/206 and A/59/285, are especially\r\nuseful in helping us to appreciate the progress made\r\nand the problems which still remain in the quest for\r\npeace and prosperity throughout Africa. In that quest,\r\nwe are particularly heartened by the fact that African\r\ncountries themselves are taking the lead. Their\r\ncommitment deserves the unwavering support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn reviewing the report on the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD), a strong sense of\r\nownership and leadership on the part of African\r\ncountries and organizations can be seen in the\r\nincreasing integration of NEPAD priorities into\r\nnational policies and programmes. The progress being\r\nmade in developing sectoral policy frameworks,\r\nimplementing specific programmes and in establishing\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\ntargets for expenditure on selected NEPAD priorities\r\ngive us cause for satisfaction.\r\nWe note the launching of specific initiatives in\r\nareas such as infrastructure, health, education,\r\nindustrialization and so on, as well as advances in\r\noperationalizing the African Peer Review Mechanism.\r\nThe increase in the number of countries that have\r\nsigned on to the Mechanism may well reflect a growing\r\nconfidence in its value as an instrument for advancing\r\nthe NEPAD agenda.\r\nNotwithstanding the encouraging achievements\r\nmade so far, we cannot help but be concerned that the\r\nquest to attain NEPAD objectives continues to be beset\r\nby many challenges and constraints. Africa’s heavy\r\ndebt burden is a major drain on its development\r\npotential. The continent lacks the financial resources\r\nneeded to generate the requisite levels of growth to\r\nreduce poverty. Africa’s share of global trade remains\r\nmarginal, while the region has had limited success in\r\nattracting sufficient levels of foreign direct investment.\r\nThis state of affairs represents a major impediment not\r\nonly to the attainment of NEPAD targets but also to the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nGiven those challenges, the positive steps taken\r\nby several countries to ease the burden of Africa’s\r\ndebt, including through debt cancellation, as well as\r\nthe increases in official development assistance to the\r\ncontinent, are to be welcomed. However, it is clear that\r\nmuch more is required in these areas as well as with\r\nrespect to trade and foreign direct investment, if Africa\r\nis to be able to achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals and the objectives of NEPAD.\r\nWe therefore join in urging increased\r\ninternational support for the New Partnership. We call\r\non our partners in the donor community to increase\r\nlevels of official development assistance to the\r\ncontinent and to take bolder measures to relieve the\r\ndebt burden faced by African countries. We also view\r\nSouth-South cooperation as an integral part of the\r\ninternational response to NEPAD and are encouraged\r\nby the role that developing countries are playing in\r\nsupport of Africa. As noted in the statement made by\r\nthe representative of Barbados yesterday, CARICOM\r\ncountries have been able to provide support in such\r\nareas as electoral reform and public sector reform and\r\nstand ready to extend further cooperation within the\r\nlimits of our resources.\r\nIf I may now turn to questions of peace and\r\nsecurity, my delegation is pleased to note that the\r\nnumber of armed conflicts in Africa has declined\r\nsignificantly in recent years. According to the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, the number of countries in\r\nthe region experiencing serious armed conflict or civil\r\nstrife dropped from 14 in 1998 to six in the current\r\nperiod. Similar trends are to be noted with respect to\r\ncountries in severe political crisis or experiencing\r\nturbulence. At the same time, it must be a source of\r\ncontinuing concern that some of the potentially richest\r\ncountries in Africa are still affected by conflict and are\r\nthus unable to exploit the full potential of their own\r\nresources. The pursuit of development, therefore,\r\ncannot be separated from the continuing search for\r\npeace.\r\nIt is my delegation’s hope and expectation that\r\nthe newly established African Peace and Security\r\nCouncil will play a pivotal role in the resolution of\r\nconflict and disputes and in the promotion of durable\r\npeace on the continent. The active role played by the\r\nAfrican Union in addressing major crises such as the\r\none in Darfur commands Guyana’s strong support. We\r\nlook forward to the further strengthening of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\narrangements and institutions in Africa. The support of\r\nthe United Nations and, indeed, of the wider\r\ninternational community remains crucial to the\r\nsuccessful realization of the goals of peace and\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm my\r\nGovernment’s continuing support for the process of\r\npositive change currently unfolding in Africa. We trust\r\nthat the international community will stay the course\r\nwith Africa to ensure that the vast potential of that\r\ngreat continent will be translated into tangible gains\r\nboth for its people and for the world.\r\nMs. Al-Mulla (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): My\r\ndelegation is pleased to participate in this debate on the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development, the causes\r\nof conflict in Africa, and lasting peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. We have read with interest the reports of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the progress made in terms of\r\nsupport by the international community for NEPAD as\r\nwell with respect to the efforts made to resolve\r\nconflicts in Africa.\r\nKuwait attaches great important to these two\r\nitems because they reflect the interests and concerns of\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nAfrican States, with which we have close historical ties\r\nbased on our mutually supportive relationship in the\r\nprocess of facing common issues. We are carrying out\r\nvaried economic activities in Africa, and we believe\r\nthat NEPAD has consolidated a principle that we have\r\nalways believed in — the close link between the\r\nsuccess of the development process and political\r\nstability and peace.\r\nI wish to pay tribute to the efforts made by the\r\nAfrican States themselves in integrating the priorities\r\nof the NEPAD initiative into national policies and\r\ndevelopment planning, as well as their efforts to create\r\ninstitutional mechanisms in the areas of good\r\ngovernance, peace and security, to ensure the success\r\nof that initiative.\r\nOne of the major challenges facing African States\r\nis overcoming the vicious circle of debt relief in order\r\nto free up enough financial resources to attain their\r\ndevelopment objectives. The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral states that 11 African States have reached\r\ncompletion point and achieved debt cancellation, and\r\nthat that other African States have derived some\r\nadvantage from debt cancellation. We welcome those\r\ndevelopments.\r\nWell before NEPAD, Kuwait was one of the first\r\ncountries that sought to relieve the debt burden of\r\nAfrican countries, which is a major burden for many of\r\nthem. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic\r\nDevelopment, within the framework of the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative, has\r\nhelped to relieve the debt of 12 African States: Burkina\r\nFaso, Cameroon, Guinea, Uganda, Mozambique,\r\nGuinea-Bissau, Niger, United Republic of Tanzania,\r\nRwanda, Ghana, Mali and Mauritania. The debt burden\r\nof those countries was lessened by giving them more\r\nfavourable terms and by rescheduling that debt over a\r\nperiod of 40 years, beginning with a grace period of 16\r\nyears with interest rates of 0.5 to 2 per cent. These\r\nterms are easier than the original terms of the loans.\r\nThe Kuwaiti Fund is currently reviewing possibilities\r\nto help to reduce the debt of other African countries\r\nwhen they reach the end of their HIPC Initiative\r\nsupport. I would also like to note that partnership\r\nbetween developing countries themselves, as well as\r\nthe role of the Fund of the Organization of Petroleum\r\nExporting Countries (OPEC), have all helped, within\r\nthe framework of the HIPC Debt Initiative, to decrease\r\nthe foreign debt of 18 African States.\r\nIndeed, Kuwait was one of the first countries to\r\nprovide development aid to a number of countries in\r\nthe world, including in Africa, and that aid has at times\r\nreached 8.3 per cent of Kuwait’s gross national\r\nproduct. The Kuwaiti Fund has given soft loans worth\r\n$637 million to NEPAD from its beginning in 1991.\r\nThe Kuwaiti Fund also assisted a number of African\r\ndevelopment institutions to provide aid: the African\r\nDevelopment Fund benefited from a number of grants,\r\nwhich by 2003 totalled $190 million; the African\r\nDevelopment Bank has been granted $115 million; the\r\nArab Bank for Economic Development in Africa\r\nreceived $48 million; and the Special Programme for\r\nSub-Saharan African Countries was given $15 million\r\nin aid.\r\nThe Kuwaiti Fund also gave technical grants\r\ntotalling $220 million in mid-2004, 10 per cent of\r\nwhich went to African countries. The Kuwaiti Fund\r\nalso participates in a number of rehabilitation\r\nprogrammes worth more than $100 million for the\r\nbenefit of 11 African countries, to help, for example,\r\nmake a success of the first programme to combat river\r\nblindness disease. A total of 19 other African countries\r\nwere helped through this programme until 2003,\r\nincluding Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo. I would also like to mention our\r\nparticipation in efforts to combat tropical diseases\r\nwithin the framework of the Foundation for Tropical\r\nDiseases, of which Kuwait was a founder. The Kuwaiti\r\nFund also participated in the International\r\nDevelopment Law Institute, through which aid was\r\ngiven to a number of African countries.\r\nKuwait, through the OPEC Fund, participates\r\nactively in a number of development projects in\r\ndeveloping countries. Ninety-nine States have been\r\nassisted by the OPEC Fund, among them 46 African\r\nStates. The volume of soft loans in 2004 was some\r\n$5.382 billion. To date, $3.482 million has been\r\ndispersed by the Fund. That partnership also includes\r\nparticipation by the OPEC Fund in the Common Fund\r\nfor Commodities. It provides grants and opportunities\r\nfor States to participate in combating HIV/AIDS.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to make a few\r\nadditional comments. First, NEPAD is not a temporary\r\nexercise but an ongoing, long-term process that\r\nrequires continuous evaluation. In Kuwait, through the\r\nparticipation of the Kuwaiti Fund, we have participated\r\nin ministerial meetings of the Southern African\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nDevelopment Community since the beginning of the\r\n1980s. We have therefore been able to witness the\r\nevolution of NEPAD from its birth as an idea to the\r\npresent, which could be said to constitute a policy of\r\nAfrican renaissance. That idea was a success because\r\nof Africa’s determination to make it succeed.\r\nSecondly, African States and African specialized\r\norganizations must redouble their efforts to promote\r\nthis initiative internationally and not just focus their\r\nefforts on one continent or one group of donor\r\ncountries. They also need to mobilize international\r\nawareness for African countries.\r\nThirdly, we appreciate the pioneering role played\r\nby the United Nations in mobilizing international\r\nassistance for NEPAD. We pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for having established an advisory panel to\r\nsupport NEPAD. We would like to thank Mr. Ibrahim\r\nGambari, who has highlighted the international role\r\nplayed by that initiative.\r\nFourthly, African States have made considerable\r\nefforts to meet the requirements of the international\r\ncommunity. Those countries have to play a crucial role\r\nin stabilizing Africa in order to encourage donor\r\ncountries and the private sector to provide the\r\nnecessary technical and economic assistance to that\r\ncontinent. It is high time for the international\r\ncommunity to take further steps to encourage Africa by\r\nincreasing political, material and technical assistance\r\nto build on the enormous efforts already expended to\r\ncreate the necessary peaceful conditions for\r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nMs. Lima da Veiga (Cape Verde): From the\r\noutset, I would like to welcome the initiative to keep\r\nissues so crucial for our continent on the agenda of this\r\nsession of the General Assembly, under items 38 and\r\n46.\r\nI would also like to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his relevant and encouraging reports on the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD),\r\nthe causes of conflict and promotion of durable peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa and on the\r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries,\r\nParticularly in Africa. The joint debate on those items\r\nhighlights the close linkage existing between peace,\r\nsecurity and development and the need to undertake a\r\ncomprehensive analysis of the challenges still\r\nconfronting Africa.\r\nCape Verde associates itself with the statements\r\nmade by Nigeria’s representative on behalf of the\r\nAfrican Union, and by the representative of Qatar on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. Allow me,\r\nhowever, to single out certain aspects that I deem to be\r\nquite relevant.\r\nThe various speakers that preceded me in this\r\ndebate have put it clearly: despite the pessimism of\r\ncertain analysts about the situation in Africa, Africans\r\nhave a new and clear vision of their future and are\r\ndemonstrating assertiveness in its implementation.\r\nThey are taking their destinies into their own hands.\r\nAfrican countries and regional organizations have\r\ntaken a series of initiatives aimed at tackling existing\r\nconflicts by, inter alia, promoting peace negotiations\r\nand brokering peace agreements. They have also\r\ncreated an enabling legal environment and institutional\r\nframeworks for conflict prevention, peacemaking and\r\npeacekeeping. Much progress has been achieved and\r\nAfrica is suffering from fewer conflicts today than at\r\nthe time of the publication of the original report of the\r\nSecretary-General in 1998 (A/52/871).\r\nThe establishment of the African Peace and\r\nSecurity Council within the African Union has been a\r\nmajor step for that organization, allowing it to play an\r\neffective role in the management and resolution of\r\nconflicts. Since its establishment, the Peace and\r\nSecurity Council has monitored developments and\r\nexamined conflict situations in 12 African countries.\r\nIn this context, it is gratifying to underline the\r\npositive outcome of the peace process in Somalia,\r\nwhich culminated with the inauguration, last week, of\r\nthe country’s highest authorities. That was made\r\npossible thanks to the determined involvement of the\r\nAfrican Union, member countries of the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development, and the\r\nvaluable support of the Kenyan Government, as well as\r\nother partners, particularly the United Nations.\r\nCloser to home for us in Cape Verde, the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States has\r\nplayed an important role in facilitating conflict\r\nmanagement in West Africa in the Mano River Union\r\ncountries and in Guinea-Bissau, for which we highly\r\ncommend it.\r\nYet conflict and civil strife continue to be the\r\nprimary roadblock on the path towards African\r\ndevelopment. There are gaps to be filled and\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nchallenges and constraints to be met. Moreover, there\r\nis the need to continue to address the root causes of\r\nconflicts and to deal with post-conflict situations in the\r\nmost effective way. We cannot permit setbacks that\r\ncould play havoc not only with the countries or regions\r\naffected by conflicts, but also with their close\r\nneighbours.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, Africa and the United\r\nNations should enhance their cooperation in\r\nmonitoring the situation in Guinea-Bissau, assist the\r\nlegitimate authorities in tackling the structural causes\r\nof recurrent crises, consolidate stability and mobilize\r\nresources for economic recovery.\r\nThe issue of the illicit proliferation, circulation\r\nand trafficking of small arms and light weapons is\r\nanother topic that deserves deeper consideration both\r\ninside and beyond African borders. Moreover,\r\nmeasures to halt it have to be strengthened.\r\nAs the Cape Verdian head of State declared\r\nrecently, peace cannot be considered as mere absence\r\nof war. A solid peace is time-demanding and requires\r\nconfidence-restoration policies among the conflicting\r\nparties and a strategy to consolidate them. Moreover,\r\npeace and stability inside States require inclusive\r\ninstitutions and policies that are responsive to the\r\nlegitimate political and economic aspirations of the\r\npopulations and capable of ensuring protection of their\r\ncultural identities.\r\nIt is true that the main responsibility for peace\r\nrests with the African States, but a concerted effort on\r\nthe part of the international community is still crucial\r\nto dealing with existing conflicts and the new trends\r\nand sources of conflict or potential threats to political\r\nand social stability.\r\nIn this context, the new partnership between the\r\nUnited Nations and the regional organizations has\r\nacquired particular importance. The Security Council’s\r\nAd Hoc Working Group on Conflict Prevention and\r\nResolution in Africa, as well as the Economic and\r\nSocial Council’s Ad Hoc Advisory Group on African\r\nCountries Emerging from Conflict have paved the way\r\nto a more comprehensive approach in addressing\r\nconflicts.\r\nWe also applaud other initiatives by international\r\npartners, such as those undertaken by the European\r\nUnion, as well as the Group of Eight’s commitment to\r\nsupport efforts to enhance African regional\r\norganizations’ capacity to engage effectively in conflict\r\nmanagement and resolution.\r\nWhile investing steadily in conflict management\r\nand peacebuilding, African leaders and societies have\r\nlaid the foundation for sustainable development. As is\r\nwidely recognized, the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) is anchored in the\r\ndetermination of Africans to extricate themselves and\r\nthe continent from the malaise of underdevelopment\r\nand exclusion in a globalizing world.\r\nThe social and economic dimension of NEPAD is\r\ncrucial to helping Africa promote sustainable\r\ndevelopment and achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals with which it is linked. African countries have\r\ndemonstrated their commitment to the implementation\r\nof NEPAD by earmarking financial resources for\r\nselected sectoral priorities.\r\nThe increase in the number of countries joining\r\nthe African Peer Review Mechanism indicates the\r\ngrowing appeal of its voluntary approach and of\r\nAfrican ownership and leadership of the process. We\r\nbelieve that the Mechanism is a positive instrument to\r\nput mutual accountability to work for better economic\r\nand political governance.\r\nAgain, as the Secretary-General put it, the\r\nprogress achieved in crisis management has not been\r\nfollowed by substantial advances in the areas of\r\neconomic and social poverty and social exclusion,\r\nwhich still affect large numbers of Africans. The lack\r\nof sufficient resources is a significant constraint in\r\naddressing challenges such as capacity-building,\r\nunemployment reduction, particularly among young\r\npeople and women, easing demographic pressures,\r\nensuring equitable distribution of resources and\r\ncombating HIV/AIDS pandemics.\r\nOn the other hand, the debt crisis in Africa is no\r\nlonger merely an issue of temporary lack of liquidity\r\nbut one of structural insolvency, representing a serious\r\nobstacle to the socio-economic development of the\r\ncontinent. That is why we fully agree with the\r\nSecretary-General’s stance on the need for a deeper\r\nconsideration of the impact of debt-servicing on the\r\nfinancing requirements for the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nDespite international commitments, namely those\r\nentered into in Monterrey, policy coherence is not yet\r\nat the core of assistance to Africa, as the report points\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nout. There is room for broader coherence in\r\ninternational assistance for Africa as far as trade, aid\r\nand debt policies are concerned to effectively support\r\nendogenous African efforts to effectively deal with\r\nthose challenges.\r\nAt this juncture, allow me to say a word about a\r\ntopic of particular importance to my country. The\r\nAfrican reality is diverse. Hence the need to effectively\r\nincorporate into NEPAD’s implementation the special\r\ndimensions of specific realities such as those of island\r\nand landlocked countries. Cape Verde, which together\r\nwith other African island and partial island countries\r\nhas launched a think-tank initiative on this issue, is\r\npleased to note that there is growing awareness of that\r\nneed. In that context, we welcome in advance the\r\nprospect of a broader discussion within the framework\r\nof the high-level meeting to be convened in the first\r\nhalf of next year with the support of the NEPAD\r\nsecretariat and the United Nations system.\r\nI would like to reaffirm Cape Verde’s political\r\nwill and commitment in the implementation of\r\nNEPAD. We remain confident that the effective\r\nresponse of the international community will\r\nencourage further progress in the implementation of\r\nNEPAD. That is in the interest of all, Africans and non-\r\nAfricans alike.\r\nTo conclude, it is gratifying to note the\r\ncommendable role of the Office of the Special Adviser\r\non Africa in keeping African issues on the global\r\nagenda and promoting international support for peace\r\nand development in Africa, as well as in coordinating\r\nefforts within the United Nations system to ensure\r\npolicy coherence on NEPAD priorities.\r\nMr. Diarra (Mali) (spoke in French): My\r\ndelegation associates itself with the statement made by\r\nthe representative of Nigeria on behalf of the African\r\nUnion and with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nMy delegation commends the Secretary-General\r\nfor the high quality of his reports on the agenda items\r\nunder consideration today.\r\nThe adoption of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) was a forceful political act by\r\nour leaders in their search for viable ways to achieve\r\nthe integrated development of the African continent.\r\nThe adoption of NEPAD by the Assembly of Heads of\r\nState and Government of the Organization for African\r\nUnity (OAU) in Lusaka in 2001 marked the beginning\r\nof the convergence of the vision embodied by NEPAD\r\nand the OAU’s ambitions for economic integration.\r\nAfrican ownership of NEPAD has enabled coherence\r\nbetween the existence of regional communities and a\r\ncontinental approach to development. Convergence\r\nefforts have been strengthened across the continent\r\nthrough contributions from the public and private\r\nsectors and civil society.\r\nDuring the period under review, NEPAD has\r\nmoved from being a political vision to formulating\r\nguiding plans on specific issues and implementing\r\nprogrammes and projects in priority sectors.\r\nExpenditure targets have been set in certain priority\r\nsectors, such as infrastructure development, education,\r\nthe environment, tourism, agriculture, science and\r\ntechnology, industrialization and health.\r\nIt is urgent to strengthen national and regional\r\nprogrammes in the health sector in order to contain\r\nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria and reduce their\r\nnegative impact on public health on the continent.\r\nMore than 144 million people in Africa are at risk of\r\ncontracting malaria. There have been some 12 million\r\ncases of malaria, causing approximately 310,000\r\ndeaths per year, including 200,000 infants.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the convergence\r\nbetween the Plan of Action against malaria adopted by\r\nthe African Heads of State and Government in Abuja in\r\nApril 2000 and the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThat linkage of the two efforts has also been boosted\r\nby the action of the United Nations Roll Back Malaria\r\nPartnership and the Global Fund to fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, as well as the action of civil\r\nsociety, in particular the Medicines for Malaria\r\nVenture. At the level of the African continent, national\r\nstructures incorporate the objectives of the Abuja Plan\r\nof Action. Subregional networks are being put in place\r\nto harmonize programmes. The African Union and\r\nNEPAD have also integrated the fight against malaria\r\nand have established links with the secretariat of the\r\nRoll Back Malaria Partnership.\r\nAll efforts in the fight against malaria must work\r\nfor prevention, the widespread distribution of\r\ninsecticide-treated mosquito nets, the creation of new\r\ninsecticides and the inclusion of preventive measures\r\nin broad vaccination campaigns, especially for\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\npregnant women and infants, vaccine research and the\r\nstrengthening of health-care capacities.\r\nArtemisinin combination therapy (ACT), which is\r\neffective in cases resistant to traditional treatments,\r\nshould be made more accessible. That will require\r\nadditional resources given that, for example, ACT\r\ntreatment will cost at least $1 billion in 2004, which is\r\nfour times the cost of existing treatments. African\r\ncountries must redirect their resources towards this\r\npriority sector and act to eliminate taxes and tariffs on\r\nmosquito nets, medicines and related technologies.\r\nAfrica’s partners should substantially increase\r\ntheir level of assistance. In that connection, we\r\nwelcome the fact that additional resources from the\r\nGlobal Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria\r\nhave been allocated to combating malaria; that priority\r\nsector now receives 29 per cent of the Fund’s\r\nresources.\r\nThe translation of the NEPAD vision into\r\nquantifiable programmes and projects is the result of\r\nour ownership of the structures established to that end\r\nat the continental level. In that connection, my\r\ndelegation pays tribute to the perseverance of the\r\nNEPAD Heads of State and Government\r\nImplementation Committee.\r\nWe also commend the African peer review panel\r\nof eminent personalities for the adoption of their work\r\nprogramme and rules of procedure. I welcome the fact\r\nthat my country, Mali, along with 22 other countries,\r\nhas joined the African Peer Review Mechanism. The\r\nNEPAD Steering Committee and secretariat also have\r\nan important role. Achieving NEPAD’s goals also\r\ndepends on the regional economic communities within\r\nthe African Union and on the  African Union\r\nCommission. We must therefore ensure convergence\r\nbetween the priorities of the African Union and those\r\nof NEPAD.\r\nNEPAD programmes and projects can be\r\nconceived and implemented only with the support of\r\nthe many partners outside Africa through the African\r\nPartnership Forum and with the support of the\r\nCommission for Africa created last February. South-\r\nSouth cooperation can also contribute to capacity-\r\nbuilding and to the establishment of partnerships\r\nbetween the Asian and African public and private\r\nsectors. We call on them to continue their support in\r\nthe implementation phase.\r\nAfrica’s key partner is undoubtedly the United\r\nNations system, through the Secretary-General’s\r\nAdvisory Panel on International Support for NEPAD.\r\nThe Panel will review and assess the scope and the\r\nadequacy of international support for NEPAD and\r\nmake recommendations to the Secretary-General on\r\nactions that the international community can take to\r\nstrengthen implementation of NEPAD. As well, all\r\nbodies of the United Nations system will contribute\r\ntheir expertise in their respective area of competence.\r\nMy delegation would especially like to mention the\r\nOffice of the Special Adviser on Africa and the Office\r\nof the High Representative for the Least Developed\r\nCountries, Landlocked Developing Countries and\r\nSmall Island Developing States for their commitment\r\nto NEPAD and to the Brussels Programme of Action,\r\nrespectively.\r\nAmong the actions that partners should take to\r\nsupport NEPAD’s implementation is to enable the\r\ncontinent to deal with its debt in a sustainable and\r\nviable way. A substantial increase in the volume of\r\nofficial development assistance is a prerequisite for the\r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals. To\r\nthat end, official development assistance for Africa\r\nmust rise from the current $23.09 billion to $50 billion\r\nper year. In addition, it is essential to harmonize and\r\nsimplify preliminary administrative arrangements.\r\nWith regard to the continent’s participation in\r\ninternational trade, in addition to preferences agreed\r\nupon bilaterally with certain countries, Africa’s\r\ncapacities must be strengthened in the areas of trade\r\nnegotiations and supply. That gives rise to the problem\r\nof productive investment. Today, Africa attracts only\r\n2 per cent of total world capital flows. Foreign direct\r\ninvestment — which was $14 billion in 2003 — is\r\nconcentrated in a few countries and in a few areas of\r\nactivity. Partners could also help to create an\r\nenvironment conducive to investment. The report\r\nconcludes that we need to exploit all existing\r\ncoordination mechanisms to enhance the consistency of\r\ntrade policies and debt assistance in order to create the\r\ncomplementarity needed for NEPAD.\r\nMy delegation believes that the report does not\r\nsufficiently highlight the potential of the African\r\ndiaspora with regard to the implementation of\r\nNEPAD’s programmes. The diaspora could provide\r\ntwo kinds of assistance. First, it could expertise, which\r\nis sorely needed for the conception and implementation\r\nof NEPAD’s programmes. African intellectuals have\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nleft en masse for areas where they can make good use\r\nof their knowledge. In addition, there are African\r\ndescendants who feel linked to the continent. We must\r\nfind ways in which to involve them in NEPAD’s\r\nimplementation. The Conference of Intellectuals from\r\nAfrica and the Diaspora, held several days ago in\r\nDakar at the initiative of President Wade of Senegal,\r\nclearly defined that contribution.\r\nThe diaspora’s contribution could also consist in\r\nmobilizing savings for productive investment in\r\ncountries of origin. The transfers made by migrants\r\nthroughout the world amounted to $80 billion in 2003.\r\nAfrica should set about this task with both African\r\nexpatriates and their countries of residence. That could\r\nprovide opportunities in terms of money transfers. In\r\nthe longer term, Africa must, as a priority, commit\r\nitself to improving the living and working conditions\r\nof the diaspora in their countries of residence. In that\r\nregard, ratification of the International Convention on\r\nthe Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers\r\nand Members of Their Families — whose Committee\r\nmy country has the honour to chair — is becoming an\r\nimperative. The experience accumulated by the\r\nInternational Organization for Migration could also be\r\nuseful in that context.\r\nMaintaining an environment of peace and\r\nstability on the African continent is a prerequisite for\r\nattaining the socio-economic development objectives\r\ndefined within NEPAD. That in turn will have a\r\npositive effect on social peace, because NEPAD’s\r\npolitical and economic governance component aims\r\nprecisely at eliminating the abuses and excesses that\r\nare often the primary causes of crises in Africa. We\r\nmust also build capacity in the fight against the\r\ntrafficking of small arms and light weapons and of\r\nnatural resources, which fuels conflict.\r\nThe United Nations system and the continent’s\r\nother partners should continue their cooperation with\r\nsubregional organizations and with the African Union\r\nto build their peacekeeping capacities, emphasizing the\r\nprotection of women and children in conflict situations.\r\nWe must strengthen assistance and protection for\r\nrefugees in Africa. Moreover, peacekeeping operations\r\nshould provide political, technical and financial\r\nsupport to peacebuilding activities by ensuring the rule\r\nof law, economic recovery and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. We must establish long-term peace and\r\nstability.\r\nIn conclusion, with the creation of the African\r\nCourt on Human and People’s Rights, the protection of\r\nhuman rights should be established as a vocation on\r\nour continent. In the view of my delegation, it is an\r\nessential condition for social peace.\r\nU Aye (Myanmar): My delegation is taking the\r\nfloor to demonstrate its solidarity with and support for\r\nthe African-owned initiative the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). My delegation is\r\nencouraged to see progress in the implementation of\r\nthat initiative, which is now in its third year. The\r\ncommitment of African countries to NEPAD is\r\nunequivocal. More African countries are joining in a\r\nvoluntary process of self-assessment to identify and\r\napply best practices in political and economic\r\ngovernance, which is called for in the African Peer\r\nReview Mechanism. The first support missions have\r\nbeen able to visit Ghana, Rwanda, Mauritius and\r\nKenya to prepare for their reviews this year. The\r\nNEPAD Heads of State and Government\r\nImplementation Committee has also been able to\r\nidentify 20 top-priority infrastructure projects in areas\r\nincluding energy, transport, water, sanitation and\r\ninformation and communications technologies, which\r\nare critical to African development.\r\nWe welcome the support that the international\r\ncommunity has shown for the implementation of\r\nNEPAD’s initiatives, including through the Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development, the\r\nSino-Africa process and the India-Africa Fund. We\r\ncommend the commitment of the Secretary-General to\r\nassist NEPAD and the recent establishment of an\r\nAdvisory Panel to assist him in monitoring\r\ninternational support.\r\nWe are encouraged to note that international\r\nassistance to Africa increased in the past two years,\r\nrising from $22.2 billion in 2002 to $23.09 billion in\r\n2003. Foreign direct investment also increased, from\r\n$11 billion in 2002 to $14 billion in 2003. Twenty-\r\nthree African countries have benefited from debt relief\r\nunder the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt\r\nInitiative. We are encouraged to note that leaders of the\r\nGroup of Eight have extended that initiative for\r\nanother two years. In addition, African countries have\r\nbenefited from various trade facilitation measures.\r\nHowever, despite such cooperation, Africa — as\r\npointed out in the Secretary-General’s report\r\n(A/59/206) — still needs more aid, debt relief, foreign\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\ninvestment and trade assistance to implement NEPAD.\r\nWe are confident that the international community will\r\ncontinue to provide sustained support to ensure the full\r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment.\r\nPeace and stability are prerequisites for economic\r\ndevelopment in Africa. Without an enabling\r\nenvironment of peace and stability, one cannot achieve\r\nprogress in economic development. My delegation is\r\nparticularly pleased by the statement in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recent report (A/59/285) that Africa is much\r\nmore peaceful today than ever before. Yet some\r\nongoing issues in Africa have demonstrated that further\r\nefforts are needed to achieve peace and stability. We\r\ncommend the efforts of the African Union and the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States to play a\r\ngreater role in peacekeeping.\r\nWe applaud the establishment and formal\r\nlaunching of the African Union’s Peace and Security\r\nCouncil on 25 May 2004. The engagement of African\r\npeacekeeping forces in conflict areas in the region will\r\nundoubtedly contribute to achieving greater peace in\r\nAfrica.\r\nOne of the greatest threats challenging African\r\nnations is the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. This\r\ndisease has the potential to deprive many countries in\r\nAfrica of their most valuable human resources and\r\nproductive labour forces. It also affects women and\r\nchildren, destroying their families and social lives. My\r\ndelegation calls for the successful implementation of\r\nthe World Health Organization’s 3 by 5 Initiative,\r\nwhich aims to put 3 million people into treatment by\r\nthe end of the year 2005. From the depths of this health\r\ncrisis a commensurate treatment plan must be\r\nrigorously pursued, in addition to prevention and\r\neducation activities. My delegation also calls for the\r\navailability of affordable drugs for the treatment of\r\nHIV/AIDS in Africa.\r\nAnother health concern in Africa is malaria. Over\r\n300 million cases of the disease are estimated each\r\nyear around the world, resulting in more than a million\r\ndeaths. Ninety per cent of all malaria cases are found\r\nin Africa, especially south of the Sahara, affecting\r\nmostly young children and pregnant women. We\r\ncommend the Roll Back Malaria campaign, jointly\r\nlaunched by WHO, the World Bank, UNICEF and the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, which aims\r\nto cut the number of deaths from malaria by 50 per\r\ncent by the year 2010 and by 75 per cent by the year\r\n2015. As we enter the halfway point of the United\r\nNations Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing\r\nCountries, Africa is still facing the menace of that\r\ndisease. United Nations agencies and the international\r\ncommunity must redouble their efforts to achieve the\r\naims of the Decade.\r\nIn addition to international support measures,\r\nSouth-South cooperation plays an important role in\r\nAfrican development. My delegation firmly believes\r\nthat South-South cooperation will supplement the\r\ninternational community’s efforts to assist African\r\ndevelopment. In that regard, I wish to highlight the\r\ncooperation between the Association of South-East\r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) and Africa. As stated by the\r\nPermanent Representative of the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic, the forthcoming Summit of\r\nASEAN and Africa in Bandung in 2005 will\r\nundoubtedly reinvigorate the spirit of Bandung and\r\nfurther increase the cooperation in the social and\r\neconomic fields between our two regional groupings.\r\nIn a globalized world, one cannot remain\r\nindifferent to events unfolding in any corner of the\r\nglobe. If we do not act aggressively enough to tackle\r\nthe problems of Africa, it will affect lives everywhere.\r\nAccordingly, my delegation calls for a sustained\r\nmomentum to implement NEPAD to the fullest extent\r\npossible and to enhance cooperation of the\r\ninternational community to help achieve the aspirations\r\nof our fellow African peoples.\r\nMr. Shah (Pakistan): It is a great privilege for me\r\nto participate in this important discussion today, which\r\nfocuses essentially on the inextricable link between\r\npeace and development. The two reports of the\r\nSecretary-General — one on the causes of conflict and\r\nthe promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa (A/59/206), and the other on the\r\nprogress in implementation and international support\r\nfor the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) (A/59/285) — complement each other. The\r\nreports offer a comprehensive and coherent picture of\r\nthe continent’s efforts to resolve conflicts, stabilize\r\npeace and create the necessary conditions for\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nThe Secretary-General has reported steady\r\nprogress in the areas of peacemaking and peacekeeping\r\nin Africa. It is heartening that, compared to 1998, the\r\nnumber of African countries in a situation of armed\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nconflict or facing deep political crisis has decreased,\r\ndue in part to progress in the implementation of\r\nNEPAD. African leadership and African institutions\r\nare increasingly involved today in seeking African\r\nsolutions to African problems. The African Union\r\n(AU) and its Peace and Security Council are assuming\r\nimportant responsibilities. The Intergovernmental\r\nAuthority of Development, the Economic Community\r\nof West African States and the Central African\r\nEconomic and Monetary Community are making\r\nnotable contributions to regional peace and security.\r\nThe cooperation and coordination of the United\r\nNations with these regional and subregional\r\norganizations has considerably evolved. In my\r\ndelegation’s view, these trends are highly positive and\r\nmust be sustained and further strengthened. We support\r\nthe Secretary-General’s intention to explore new ways\r\nof collaboration between the United Nations and the\r\nAU.\r\nWhile these achievements are impressive, new\r\nconflicts and complex crises continue to afflict Africa.\r\nThe risks today of relapsing into conflict are real as\r\nnew trends and sources of conflict present potential\r\nthreats to peace and security. The Secretary-General\r\nhas mentioned poverty, and particularly youth\r\nunemployment, in that context. He has also mentioned\r\nillicit exploitation of and trade in natural resources as a\r\nmajor source of instability in Africa. We could not\r\nagree more with the views of the Secretary-General. In\r\nour view, many of the conflict situations in Africa\r\ntoday are the direct consequence of the politics of\r\npoverty and scarcity.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic is another source of\r\ndestabilization, as are demographic pressures and\r\necological factors, as acknowledged in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nPakistan is a significant stakeholder in the\r\ninternational community’s investment in Africa. We\r\nbelieve Africa’s potential cannot be fully realized as\r\nlong as conflicts rage on the continent. Pakistan is\r\nconvinced that sustainable peace can be assured only\r\nby evolving and ensuring a comprehensive conflict\r\nprevention strategy, addressing the root causes of\r\nconflict, strengthening long-term capacities for\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and mobilizing\r\nresources for post-conflict peacebuilding,\r\nreconstruction and development. The United Nations\r\nsystem and the international community must work\r\ntogether to evolve a comprehensive, integrated and\r\ncoherent policy response.\r\nWe are pleased that efforts to build a viable and\r\neffective partnership to tackle the myriad challenges in\r\nAfrica are already under way. We commend the\r\nAfrican leadership for their vision in launching\r\nNEPAD, an Africa-led, Africa-owned and Africa-\r\ndriven initiative providing an integrated and\r\ncomprehensive framework for Africa’s sustainable\r\ngrowth and development. Fittingly, NEPAD sets out a\r\nbroad vision for Africa’s future, outlines a strategy for\r\nachieving that vision and spells out a programme of\r\naction focused on a number of key priority areas.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report notes that NEPAD\r\nhas made considerable progress in developing sectoral\r\npolicy frameworks, implementing specific programmes\r\nand projects and establishing targets for expenditure in\r\nNEPAD sectoral priority areas, including, among\r\nothers, infrastructure, health, education, agriculture and\r\nthe environment. This is indeed very heartening. None\r\nof this could have been achieved without the\r\ndetermination and the collective political will of the\r\nAfrican countries to make NEPAD work for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe progress made is unmistakable, but,\r\nunfortunately, it is still far below the real potential of\r\nNEPAD. The African continent faces severe constraints\r\nin the effective execution of many of its programmes.\r\nForemost is the serious inadequacy of fiscal resources\r\nto meet the targets and existing needs.\r\nThere is overwhelming evidence suggesting that\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will\r\nremain largely elusive for Africa unless something is\r\ndone substantially to enhance existing development\r\nassistance flows to generate the resources required for\r\nachieving the MDGs. Africa’s inability to realize the\r\nMDGs would also be seen as a failure of NEPAD.\r\nThe issue of resource flows has to be addressed\r\neffectively and expeditiously, with the support and\r\nassistance of the international community. The\r\nSecretary-General’s report cites various actions taken\r\nby the international community to bolster development\r\nactivities and initiatives in Africa. But my delegation\r\nbelieves that more needs to be done, and urgently.\r\nAn important endeavour, acknowledged in the\r\nreport, is the grant of debt relief, including debt\r\ncancellation to Africa by the developed country\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\npartners. This is a welcome development. Such efforts\r\nneed to be further expanded to include other countries\r\nin Africa that are in financial distress.\r\nThe continuous rise in foreign direct investment\r\nflows into Africa is another encouraging sign, even\r\nthough the numbers are still insignificant in terms of\r\nglobal foreign direct investment flows. We feel\r\nstrongly that bolstering investments, expanding trade\r\nby allowing greater market access to exports from\r\nAfrica, and building capacity and human resources are\r\nthe most important tools to put Africa onto the track of\r\nfast development. These, we believe, should be the\r\nthree main pillars for a strategic partnership between\r\nAfrica and the rest of the world.\r\nWe also see the Tokyo International Conference\r\non African Development, the recent Asia-Africa\r\nSubregional Organization Conference and other similar\r\ninitiatives as part of an important process that could\r\ncomplement efforts made in the framework of NEPAD.\r\nPolicy coherence is as much a fundamental policy\r\nchallenge for Africa as it is for the rest of the\r\ndeveloping world in the context of international\r\nsupport. We would therefore like to take this\r\nopportunity to highlight the long-standing need for an\r\nintegrated development strategy, not only for Africa\r\nbut also for other developing parts of the world.\r\nFor its part, Pakistan has always actively\r\nsupported initiatives that seek to address the problems\r\nand crises faced by the countries of Africa. We have\r\nalso been a strong supporter of the effective and early\r\nimplementation of NEPAD. Pakistan has consistently\r\nsupported the political and economic aspirations of\r\nAfrica. We are equally proud of our participation in\r\nseveral United Nations peacekeeping operations in\r\nAfrica. Our military and civilian personnel have been\r\npart of United Nations operations in Burundi, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nLiberia, Namibia, Sierra Leone, Somalia and the\r\nWestern Sahara.\r\nAt the national level, the Government of Pakistan\r\nhas been successfully running a special technical\r\nassistance programme for Africa since 1986, a fact\r\nacknowledged in the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nHundreds of young African professionals in various\r\nfields have benefited from that ongoing programme.\r\nI wish to conclude by noting that conflict has\r\nsapped Africa’s potential for too long. The peoples of\r\nAfrica continue to suffer as a consequence. The\r\nchallenges that the continent faces are colossal, but\r\nAfrica now has the opportunity finally to turn the\r\ncorner. NEPAD represents a realistic framework to\r\nmeet the challenges facing Africa. The commitments\r\nare there, and so are the plans. It is time for the world\r\nto turn words into deeds. This is a moral obligation as\r\nwell as a political responsibility.\r\nMr. Djangone-Bi (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in\r\nFrench): My delegation endorses the statement made\r\nby the representative of Nigeria on behalf of the\r\nAfrican Union and the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China. We would echo delegations that spoke\r\nearlier in welcoming this debate on the important\r\nquestion of Africa’s development.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to convey\r\nsincere thanks to the Secretary-General for his abiding\r\ninterest in Africa. That interest was reflected in the\r\nappointment of a Secretariat official — Mr. Ibrahim\r\nGambari — to deal with the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). We congratulate\r\nMr. Gambari on the excellent report on that item.\r\nFor Africa, in this era of globalization, NEPAD\r\nrepresents a crucial instrument for all development\r\nstrategies, at a time when regional and subregional\r\nblocs are being strengthened. The ongoing interest\r\nshown not only by African States but also by the\r\ninternational community in general and the Group of\r\nEight in particular attest to its importance.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General entitled\r\n“New Partnership for Africa’s Development: second\r\nconsolidated report on progress in implementation and\r\ninternational support” notes that considerable progress\r\nhas been made despite the clear constraints and\r\ndifficulties. Major infrastructure projects have been\r\nundertaken by heads of State and Government in the\r\nsectors of transportation, energy, sanitation, drinking\r\nwater and new information and communication\r\ntechnologies.\r\nThe health strategy adopted by the African Union\r\nto wage an integrated struggle against diseases is\r\nencouraging, since disease knows no borders. On the\r\nquestion of malaria in particular, whose consequences\r\nare as devastating as the AIDS pandemic in Africa, an\r\nincrease in the resources of the Global Fund to Fight\r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria would make it\r\npossible to stem this other pandemic, which poses a\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nreal obstacle to the economic and social development\r\nof our countries.\r\nEducation, the environment and sanitation all are\r\npriority sectors for sustainable development, but,\r\nunfortunately, they are not a focal point for investors.\r\nWe welcome the fact that they have been taken into\r\naccount by NEPAD and given a high profile.\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, whose economy is agriculturally\r\nbased, welcomes the integrated programme whereby 10\r\nper cent of the national budget is devoted to that vital\r\nsector, which employs more than half of its population.\r\nWe support the African Peer Review\r\nMechanism — a very original system that ensures that\r\nNEPAD is based on good governance and the\r\nobservance of human rights.\r\nIn an era of globalization, cooperation among\r\nStates and among regional and subregional\r\norganizations has become the backbone of all poverty-\r\neradication policies. In that respect, Côte d’Ivoire has\r\nalways played and continues to play a very active role\r\nin subregional cooperation organizations — in the West\r\nAfrican Economic and Monetary Union and the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) — as well as in organizations at the\r\ncontinental level — participating with the former\r\nOrganization of African Unity and now the African\r\nUnion (AU), to name just a few. In our poverty\r\nreduction strategy paper, and in all of our development\r\nplans, the subregional dimension has always been\r\ntaken into account in a spirit of solidarity.\r\nFinancing is the key to the success or failure of\r\nprojects. Here, we note the major efforts being made\r\nby African countries to make resources available to\r\nNEPAD, despite their enormous national needs. We\r\nalso welcome the support of the international\r\ncommunity in general, in particular the support of the\r\nG-8, which has demonstrated its solidarity through\r\nvarious instruments and mechanisms. They include,\r\namong others, the Africa Partnership Forum,\r\nestablished by the Organization for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development (OECD); the\r\nCommission for Africa, established by the United\r\nKingdom; the Millennium Challenge Corporation and\r\nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act of the United\r\nStates of America; the extension to 2006 of the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative; and\r\nthe European Union’s “Everything But Arms”\r\ninitiative.\r\nIn that context, Côte d’Ivoire welcomes the\r\nadoption by the General Council of the World Trade\r\nOrganization, on 1 August 2004 in Geneva, of a set of\r\nframework agreements that stipulate modalities for\r\nnegotiations within the Doha development agenda,\r\nincluding frameworks that deal with agriculture in\r\ngeneral, and with the problems relating to cotton and\r\nthe elimination of export subsidies in particular.\r\nHowever, international solidarity alone is not\r\nenough. Indeed, out of a total of $70 billion in long-\r\nterm loans to developing countries by OECD in recent\r\nyears, only 5 per cent have been allocated for Africa,\r\nof which only 1 per cent was slated for sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica. We think it would be a good idea to enable\r\nAfrican countries to obtain more resources by giving\r\nthem easier access to markets and by reducing their\r\ndebt burdens. To do that, African countries are\r\ncounting on a constructive attitude on the part of the\r\ndeveloped countries to ensure the successful fulfilment\r\nof the Doha development agenda, particularly in regard\r\nto agriculture.\r\nAll the efforts made towards Africa’s\r\ndevelopment are at risk because of the constant\r\nsuccession of social and armed conflicts on that\r\ncontinent. Two thirds of recent peacekeeping\r\noperations have been deployed in Africa. Those\r\nconflicts — which have diverse and varied causes, both\r\ninternal and external — very often find a fertile\r\nbreeding ground in poverty. Although national, those\r\ncrises have subregional and regional repercussions and\r\nbecause of their cross-border nature threaten to\r\njeopardize the implementation of NEPAD projects. For\r\nthat reason, Côte d’Ivoire believes that the resolution\r\nof such crises must take the cross-border aspect into\r\naccount. In that context, we fully support the ECOWAS\r\noverall stabilization plan for durable peace in West\r\nAfrica, a region where three countries are in a conflict\r\nor post-conflict situation.\r\nConflict prevention, within the framework of\r\nECOWAS or the United Nations, should also be given\r\nspecial attention. Prevention means honest, sincere\r\ncooperation among neighbouring States in the area of\r\nsecurity.\r\nCôte d’Ivoire appeals at one and the same time\r\nfor international solidarity and the observance of the\r\nprinciples of good governance and responsibility for\r\nthe success of NEPAD.\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nMr. López Clemente (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nTo Cubans, Africa is far from being just a place in\r\ngeography classes; it is a topic of vital attention. No\r\none can deny the profound impact on the formation of\r\nwhat we know today as the Cuban nation of the legacy\r\ninherited from Africans brought to the island as slaves\r\nby Spanish colonizers. The fields of Cuba of that time\r\nrang with the cries of those forcibly separated from\r\ntheir loved ones, and the crack of the whips wielded by\r\nthose who enriched themselves on the sweat of those\r\nmen and women was often heard. Similar scenes were\r\nwitnessed throughout the American continent and the\r\nCaribbean. The slave route was an integral part of the\r\nblatant exploitation and impoverishment of the\r\ncontinent. Nowadays many seek to ignore, justify or,\r\nworse still, to erase that sorry chapter from modern\r\nhistory.\r\nCuba has been a remarkable witness to the spirit\r\nof rebellion of Africans and their descendants and of\r\ntheir contribution to independence struggles, and the\r\ncreation of a genuine national culture is a source of\r\npride to us all.\r\nMuch has been said of the current conditions in\r\nAfrica and the accumulated needs of that region after\r\ncenturies of exploitation and plundering. As far as\r\nCuba is concerned, as long as the current political and\r\neconomic order continues to hold — in which a few\r\nconsume almost everything and the majority of the\r\npopulation of the Earth is deprived of the so-called\r\nbenefits of neo-liberal globalization — the problems of\r\nthe third world, in particular those of African\r\ncountries, will not be solved. Current international\r\neconomic relations leave Africa at a total disadvantage.\r\nIt is a reflection of an appalling inequality that the\r\nAfrican population, which comprises 18.5 per cent of\r\nthe world’s population and whose lands hold the\r\ngreatest reserves of natural resources anywhere in the\r\nworld, should share 1 per cent in the world’s gross\r\ndomestic product and only 2 per cent of world trade.\r\nThe initiatives described in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General concerning progress in\r\nimplementing the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) (A/59/206) indicate that\r\nmodest improvements have been made in areas such as\r\ndebt relief and the availability of official development\r\nassistance (ODA). However, the data supplied in that\r\ndocument is conclusive: in 2002 African nations\r\nreceived only $22.23 billion in ODA from donor\r\ncountries, while they disbursed $39.53 billion in debt\r\nservicing to creditors — that is to say, to those very\r\nsame donors. And the debt has continued to grow.\r\nAfrica — along with the rest of the third world,\r\nbecause of the unjust international order that we suffer\r\nunder — continues to finance the opulence of the rich\r\ncountries.\r\nTogether with the economic and social situation,\r\nthe heritage of colonial geographical divisions\r\ncontinues to be felt. In Africa at present there are more\r\narmed conflicts than in any other region. They are an\r\nadditional obstacle to achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, as they have devastating effects\r\non the economic and social development of the region.\r\nRegional efforts to resolve those problems have been\r\nsubstantial. More than ever, what is required of the\r\nUnited Nations is an integrated approach to resolve the\r\nproblems relating to peace, security and development\r\non the continent.\r\nThe African peoples require the support of the\r\ninternational community. The resources that they\r\npossess must be dedicated to paying off their external\r\ndebt at the same time as they try to achieve\r\ndevelopment. Africa today spends four times as much\r\nin debt servicing than on education and health\r\ncombined. The situation is untenable, and cooperation\r\nmust be freed from all conditions and interference.\r\nIndeed, there is an urgent need for cooperation to be\r\ndesigned to grant special and differential treatment,\r\naccess to markets, stability of commodity prices, total\r\nand immediate forgiveness of debt, access to\r\ntechnology, a substantial increase in ODA and the\r\nnecessary financial resources.\r\nA cardinal principle of Cuba’s foreign policy is\r\nthe consistent practice of internationalism and\r\nsolidarity with other peoples of the world. The genuine\r\nexpression of that has been the policy of cooperation\r\nwith the countries of the African continent, which has\r\nbeen followed since the early days of the Cuban\r\nRevolution.\r\nCuba has provided disinterested cooperation and\r\nsolidarity to almost all countries of the African\r\ncontinent. The main sectors in which cooperation has\r\nbeen provided are health, education, sport, agriculture,\r\nfishing, construction, water resources and physical\r\nplanning. From 1963 to 2003 a total of 86,395 Cubans\r\nprovided services in 38 African countries. In mid-2004,\r\na total of 2,407 individuals were offering their services\r\nin 29 African nations. Among the cooperation\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nprogrammes in which Cuba participates we would\r\nhighlight those on comprehensive health care, food\r\nsecurity, literacy, AIDS prevention, medical school\r\nsupport, combating malaria and other diseases, human\r\nresources training, and others. There are also other\r\ncooperative programmes in other socio-economic areas\r\nspecific to certain countries.\r\nAll of that takes place in spite of the fact that\r\nCuba is a country of scarce resources that, for more\r\nthan four decades, has been subjected to a rigid\r\neconomic, trade and financial blockade, which during\r\nthe past year has hardened and whose extraterritorial\r\nscope has broadened.\r\nAfrica deserves respect above all: solidarity and\r\nrespect. In order to resolve its problems, it does not\r\nneed more advice or alien formulas for development.\r\nAfrican countries require not paternalism, but financial\r\nresources, human capital formation and access to\r\nmarkets and technologies. Once and for all, Africa\r\ndeserves settlement of the historical debt of centuries\r\nof exploitation and plundering.\r\nMr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): Let me begin\r\nby thanking the Secretary-General for his report\r\n(A/59/206), prepared in response to the request of\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 58/233, on the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). My\r\ndelegation aligns itself with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China and with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic on behalf of the Association of South-East\r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN).\r\nAs we met here today to review the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD, we are pleased to realize\r\nthat over the past year, as highlighted in the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General, African countries have achieved\r\nprogress in developing sectoral policy frameworks,\r\nimplementing specific programmes and projects and\r\nestablishing targets for expenditure on selected sectoral\r\npriorities of the New Partnership. Both in conception\r\nand in specific actions, we have noted progress in\r\nmajor spheres such as infrastructure, health, education,\r\nenvironment and tourism, agriculture, science and\r\ntechnology and industrialization. Furthermore, much\r\neffort has been made to integrate the gender dimension\r\ninto the planning and implementation of various\r\naspects of NEPAD. The increase in the flows of foreign\r\ndirect investment is also an encouraging sign.\r\nSuch progress is of special importance given the\r\ndifficulties faced by the majority of African countries\r\nand the low level of their development. After decades\r\nof prolonged tension and hostilities, Africa, at last, is\r\nmoving forward on its path of development. Mutual\r\nsupport for each other in their struggles for\r\nindependence and freedom has brought the people of\r\nViet Nam close to the peoples of Africa. The peoples\r\nof Africa deserve our special and sincere\r\ncongratulations on their achievements.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General pointed to the\r\nchallenges and constraints that African countries are\r\nfacing in the implementation of NEPAD. He\r\nmentioned, among other things, fiscal problems, the\r\nimpact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic on various sectors,\r\nthe possibility of uneven benefits from trade\r\nliberalization for different African countries. Those\r\nchallenges and constraints are not new, and are not\r\nunique to African countries. What my delegation\r\nwishes to stress here is that while African countries are\r\ntrying to maintain and build upon the initial, and\r\nmodest, progress they have made in implementing\r\nNEPAD and in implementing the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, those challenges and constraints,\r\nif not effectively addressed, will make their tasks more\r\ndifficult.\r\nIn that context, besides assistance from developed\r\ncountries, South-South cooperation and assistance is\r\nnecessary for African countries in implementing\r\nNEPAD. We are pleased to note that over the years,\r\nmany developing countries from other continents have\r\nprovided assistance to African countries. We believe\r\nthat the forthcoming Asia-Africa Business Forum, to\r\nbe held later this month, and the Asian-African Summit\r\nto be organized next year are meaningful initiatives in\r\nthat direction.\r\nThe Secretary-General rightly said that the\r\nUnited Nations has a key role to play in mobilizing\r\nsupport for NEPAD. We welcome and highly\r\nappreciate the efforts of the United Nations and the\r\nrelevant United Nations agencies in this connection\r\nand hope that the Secretary-General’s Advisory Panel\r\non International Support for NEPAD will be successful\r\nin its dialogue with Africa’s development partners with\r\na view to promoting support for NEPAD.\r\nBesides friendship and solidarity, Viet Nam sees\r\nin African countries great potential for mutually\r\nbeneficial cooperation in various fields, including\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nagriculture, health, education, trade and investment,\r\nand others. Over the years, despite limited resources,\r\nViet Nam has endeavoured to promote multifaceted\r\ncooperation with African countries. Hundreds of\r\nVietnamese educational and medical experts are\r\nworking in African countries. For years now, under a\r\nnew form of cooperation — tripartite cooperation with\r\nthe participation of Viet Nam, an African country and a\r\nthird party such as the Food and Agricultural\r\nOrganization of the United Nations — hundreds of\r\nVietnamese agricultural experts have been sent to\r\nSenegal, Benin, Congo, the United Republic of\r\nTanzania and Madagascar to assist our African friends\r\nin agricultural development.\r\nIn May 2003, we took the initiative of organizing\r\nin Hanoi an international conference entitled, Viet\r\nNam-Africa: Opportunities for cooperation and\r\ndevelopment in the twenty-first century, with the\r\nparticipation of ministers and other high-ranking\r\nofficials from 24 African countries, nine United\r\nNations agencies, the World Bank, the European\r\nUnion, and the International Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie. The conference not only contributed to\r\nfurther mutual understanding but also helped create a\r\nnew driving force in the development of cooperative\r\nrelationships between Viet Nam and African countries.\r\nWe look forward to making further contributions to the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD.\r\nMr. Olhaye (Djibouti): My delegation associates\r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of\r\nNigeria on behalf of Africa. My delegation also wishes\r\nto thank the Secretary-General for his second\r\nconsolidated report on progress in implementation of\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(A/59/206), his report on the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations contained in his report on the causes\r\nof conflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa (A/59/285), and his\r\nreport entitled “2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back\r\nMalaria in Developing Countries, particularly in\r\nAfrica” (A/59/261).\r\nThe second consolidated report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on progress in implementation and\r\ninternational support for the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) is a welcome\r\ndocument that sheds sufficient light on NEPAD’s\r\nprogrammes, activities and developments and that\r\nunderscores the extent to which African Governments\r\nhave examined their conditions. The breadth of\r\nNEPAD’s plans and the implicit coordination and\r\ncommitment that will be necessary are clear indications\r\nof Africa’s seriousness of purpose. The continent will\r\nsurely continue to lag behind in its potential and\r\nremain a mere onlooker in the global economy if it\r\ndoes not make strides in coming together as a whole.\r\nWhat is gratifying to see in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport is the distance Africa has travelled, from mere\r\nslogans and posturing to concrete plans, structures and\r\nfinancial details.\r\nAfrica’s history with regard to development has\r\nconsisted to a large degree of individual country\r\nefforts, along with some regional collaborations. But\r\nwith NEPAD, we are now facing a challenge: to think,\r\ndesign and perform on an increasingly continental\r\nscale. In that way, we can see our continental potential,\r\nset realistic targets in specific time frames and\r\ndetermine the resources that will be necessary to meet\r\nour goals and targets. We can also prioritize our efforts,\r\nmonitor and evaluate our progress and recalibrate our\r\ntargets accordingly.\r\nEven that too brief overview shows that we are\r\ncoming to better appreciate the enormity of our tasks:\r\nwhere we are; the progress that we have made — and,\r\nat times, the lack of it; and the resources that we have,\r\ndo not have and will require.\r\nAs the Secretary-General aptly points out, a\r\ndistinguishing feature of NEPAD is its combination of\r\nthe presentation of policy frameworks on specific\r\nissues with the implementation of programmes and\r\nprojects in priority sectoral areas. Last year was\r\nmarked by progress in developing sectoral policy\r\nframeworks, implementing specific programmes and\r\nprojects and establishing expenditure targets on\r\nselected NEPAD sectoral priorities. Chapter II of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, on actions by African\r\ncountries and organizations, highlights the NEPAD\r\nefforts in a number of critical areas, such as\r\ninfrastructure, health, education, environment and\r\ntourism, agriculture, science and technology and\r\nindustrialization. There is a clear impression that\r\nconsiderable work and analysis have taken place on the\r\ndevelopment of costs, priorities, strategies, action plans\r\nand policies. The inclusion of other players and actors,\r\nsuch as the private sector, civil society organizations,\r\nregional organizations and official bodies,\r\ndemonstrates Africa’s intention to be inclusive in its\r\nquest for development and renewal.\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nNEPAD brings together a wide array of\r\ninstitutions, organizations and leaders, including\r\nUnited Nations agencies, donors and investors. The\r\nreport of the Secretary-General says that,\r\n“As the implementation of NEPAD moves\r\nforward, a strengthened partnership is needed, in\r\nwhich African countries deepen their\r\ncommitments to the priorities of NEPAD and its\r\ndevelopment partners take a composite of\r\ncarefully targeted measures and actions to give\r\nNEPAD a major impetus ...\r\n“African countries have demonstrated their\r\ncommitment to advancing the implementation of\r\nNEPAD.” (A/59/206, paras. 66 and 67)\r\nWhat is necessary now is for donors to step forward to\r\nmeet Africa half way, which in many ways was the\r\nunderstanding if Africa showed its seriousness.\r\nObviously, the usual litany of constraints faced\r\nby African countries, such as commodity price trends,\r\nweak debt relief initiatives on the part of the\r\nindustrialized world, insufficient official development\r\nassistance, continuing trade restrictions, limited and\r\nhighly concentrated private investment and crippling\r\nmacro-economic policies imposed by external\r\ninstitutions, only tend to exacerbate Africa’s dire\r\nsituation.\r\nAny discussion of NEPAD must include the\r\ncontinuing threat of poverty in Africa. That condition\r\nalone makes more urgent the realization of NEPAD by\r\ncreating conditions for sustainable development and\r\nthe implementation of projects in priority areas. It is\r\nespecially necessary to reverse the rising trend of youth\r\nunemployment, which could constitute a threat to\r\nstability in many countries. Equally, it is important to\r\naddress the mounting demographic pressures.\r\nThe progress report of the Secretary-General on\r\nthe implementation of the recommendations contained\r\nin his report on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa (A/59/285) is encouraging but\r\nalludes to threats. On the one hand, there appears to be\r\nnoticeable progress in reducing the number and the\r\nprevalence of conflict situations on the continent.\r\nThere has also been significant movement in creating\r\nstructures and mechanisms to address conflict in\r\nAfrica — most notably in Africa itself, as well as in the\r\nUnited Nations and other international organs. The\r\nneed to commit funds and resources to the prevention\r\nof conflict is clearly on the table now, and the creation\r\nof an African standby force, with its necessary\r\nequipment, skills, resources and leadership, is now a\r\ndistinct possibility.\r\nIt could be said that one must prioritize one’s\r\nchallenges and deal with them accordingly. Conflict\r\ndestabilizes and leaves everything in disarray. So,\r\nperhaps that situation must be dealt with first. In that\r\nrespect, Africa has come a considerable distance. From\r\n14 conflict situations in 1998, we are down to six\r\ntoday. Equally important, most African countries enjoy\r\nrelatively stable conditions and are governed by\r\ndemocratically elected regimes. Twenty-three countries\r\nhave acceded to the African Peer Review Mechanism\r\nof NEPAD, and all African States are signatories of the\r\nAlgiers Declaration of 1999, which emphasizes the\r\nrecognition of new Governments only when they are\r\nconstitutionally elected. It is also encouraging to note\r\nthe efforts made by African countries and regional\r\norganizations in promoting peace negotiations and\r\nbrokering peace agreements. The creation under the\r\nAfrican Union of legal frameworks and structures for\r\ndealing with conflicts, such as the Peace and Security\r\nCouncil and the Committee of the Wise also augurs\r\nwell. The African Union has already proven its worth\r\nin peacemaking and peacekeeping by deploying forces\r\nand military observers in a number of conflict\r\nsituations.\r\nWhile Africa’s newly enhanced role is a positive\r\ndevelopment, the skills, experience and resources of\r\nthe United Nations remain critical. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report extensively outlines the many\r\ndepartments, agencies, committees and individuals of\r\nthe United Nations system involved in conflict\r\nprevention and resolution, and the list is an impressive\r\none. Many are working with the African Union, as well\r\nas with subregional organizations, in developing the\r\nnecessary skills. There is little question that the\r\nresources and skills of the United Nations, as well as\r\nthose of the industrialized countries, which are often\r\nreluctant to expose their own troops to danger in\r\nAfrica, are needed to bolster Africa’s capacity.\r\nObviously, other problems that need to be dealt\r\nwith in conflict situations include the protection of\r\ncivilians and their civil rights, the plight of refugees\r\nand internally displaced persons and the stress on\r\nneighbouring countries, situations which are often\r\ndestabilizing and draining. Organizing humanitarian\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nassistance is a challenge few outside the United\r\nNations and selected international relief organizations\r\ncan handle.\r\nNone of that, however, says anything regarding\r\nthe necessity for post-conflict peace-building. The\r\npicture is decidedly involved and complex. Here, the\r\nSecretary-General makes a major point in noting the\r\ndivision between assessed contributions for\r\npeacekeeping operations and voluntary contributions\r\nfor critical humanitarian and development activities\r\nduring transition periods. That remains an impediment\r\nto the seamless support necessary to take a country\r\nfrom the stage of humanitarian assistance and\r\npeacekeeping to that of building support for long-term\r\ndevelopment programmes. More resources are required\r\non a predictable basis for peace-building in areas such\r\nas strengthening democratic governance, enhancing\r\nadministrative capacity, ensuring the independence of\r\nthe judiciary and promoting transparency and\r\naccountability. Progress in those areas has been modest\r\nand slow, to be sure.\r\nThe continuing menace, death and destruction\r\ncaused by malaria far exceeds that of HIV/AIDS.\r\nLooming ominously under the radar of public concern,\r\nit remains a dangerous threat to millions of people.\r\nEvery year, it kills more than 1 million people. The\r\nGeneral Assembly, by its resolution 57/294, called for\r\nsupport of the recommendations contained in the report\r\nof the Secretary-General (A/57/123), such as support\r\nfor Roll Back Malaria partner organizations, including\r\nthe World Health Organization, the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund and the Global Fund to fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria. The recommendations also\r\nurge all African countries to implement the Abuja\r\nrecommendations to waive taxes and tariffs on bed nets\r\nand netting materials that prevent infection and to\r\nincrease domestic resource allocation to malaria\r\ncontrol. What we are seeking in this and other relevant\r\nmeetings is therefore an update on the status of\r\nimplementation of the recommendations contained in\r\nthe General Assembly resolution.\r\nThe recent report of the Secretary-General\r\nentitled “Implementation of the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration” (A/59/282) highlights\r\ndisturbing statistics, relating particularly to sub-\r\nSaharan Africa. Clearly, Africa represents the major\r\nfocus of the malaria crisis, where resistance is on the\r\nrise. Newer and more effective combination therapies\r\nand medicines are badly needed. In this context, it is\r\nimportant to note the promising results of a new\r\nmalaria vaccine that is now in clinical trials with\r\nchildren aged one to four in Mozambique. According\r\nto the British medical journal The Lancet, the vaccine\r\nmanaged to reduce risk by about 30 per cent and cut\r\ncases of severe malaria by more than half. But\r\ndeveloping such a vaccine is very costly and requires\r\nunambiguous support from advanced countries and\r\nfrom foundations.\r\nThe global expenditure on malaria prevention and\r\ntreatment today is around $400 million a year, and\r\nmuch of that comes from one donor, the Bill and\r\nMelinda Gates Foundation, whose private efforts have\r\nbeen remarkable. As I stated last year in my\r\nintervention, what stands out is not only the size of\r\ntheir largesse, but also the intensity of their personal\r\nfocus and concern for the lives and well-being of the\r\npoor. Creation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria is also a major breakthrough\r\nand holds the potential of access to funds for malaria\r\ncontrol commensurate with the needs.\r\nFinally, it is essential to note the conclusion of\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report that malaria is treatable,\r\npreventable and curable. This can be seen in the zero to\r\nlow level of incidence in many areas of the world\r\nwhere malaria has been eradicated. Major advances are\r\npossible in many countries by simply utilizing existing\r\ntools. Developing new tools, such as a vaccine,\r\ndeserves continued support, although such tools may\r\nbe years away.\r\nWe hope more Governments and organizations\r\nwill join the noble cause of eradicating one of\r\nhumanity’s scourges from the face of the Earth.\r\nMr. Kryzhanivsky (Ukraine): At the outset, I\r\nwould like to join previous speakers in expressing\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive reports submitted under today’s agenda\r\nitems. The detailed observations, thorough analyses\r\nand practical and forward-looking recommendations\r\ncontained in those documents constitute a sound basis\r\nfor our discussion.\r\nLast year was marked by a number of milestone\r\nevents that will have a long-term impact on the process\r\nof integration of the African continent. Progress in the\r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), in particular through\r\nestablishing its sectoral policy frameworks, was\r\ncomplemented by the institutional strengthening of the\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\ncontinent through the creation of the Pan-African\r\nParliament and the African Union (AU) Peace and\r\nSecurity Council. Thus, the commitment expressed by\r\nAfrican countries to the principles of ownership,\r\nleadership and responsibility underpinning the New\r\nPartnership is steadily being translated into reality in\r\nthree key areas: the economic, the political and the\r\nsecurity spheres.\r\nOf particular importance is progress in moving\r\nthe African Peer Review Mechanism process forward.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that the increase\r\nin the number of countries that have signed on to the\r\nMechanism demonstrates the growing appeal of its\r\nvoluntary approach. My delegation is of the view that\r\npractical implementation of this innovative feature will\r\nhelp many African countries reach higher economic\r\nand political standards through a transparent system of\r\nself-monitoring and self-control.\r\nThere is no doubt that international support is a\r\nvital element for the success of NEPAD. In this regard,\r\nwe welcome the growing number of international\r\ninitiatives aimed at assisting Africa in achieving the\r\nDevelopment Goals. These include the African\r\nPartnership Forum, the Commission for Africa, the\r\nMillennium Challenge Corporation and the Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development,\r\namong others. In this respect, we trust that, as it is\r\nimportant for the African countries to stand united in\r\novercoming their problems, it is equally critical for the\r\ninternational community to ensure coherence in its\r\nAfrican policy, if it wishes to speak with one voice in\r\nits dialogue with Africa.\r\nThis is where the United Nations has a particular\r\nrole to play. By effectively coordinating global\r\nadvocacy and mobilizing international support for\r\nNEPAD, the United Nations should make a valuable\r\ncontribution to the implementation of the New\r\nPartnership. This demanding mission necessitates the\r\nstrengthening of collaboration and coordination among\r\nthe various components of the United Nations system.\r\nIn that context, we take positive note of activities\r\nundertaken by the Office of the Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral and Special Adviser on Africa, which serves\r\nas a focal point for NEPAD in the United Nations\r\nsystem. We also welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecent decision to establish the Advisory Panel on\r\nInternational Support for NEPAD, consisting of\r\neminent economists, development practitioners and\r\nacademics.\r\nAs an active partner of Africa, Ukraine fully\r\nsupports the principles and objectives of the New\r\nPartnership and is closely following the process of its\r\nimplementation. We are ready to participate in the\r\nrealization of programmes and projects in a number of\r\nNEPAD’s sectoral priority areas, such as infrastructure,\r\nindustrialization, energy, transport, agriculture,\r\neducation and the application of space technologies.\r\nRelevant proposals have already been submitted by\r\nUkraine to the NEPAD secretariat, and we are looking\r\nforward to their implementation.\r\nBecause it realizes that the active involvement of\r\nthe African regional economic communities is essential\r\nto NEPAD’s success, Ukraine appointed a special\r\nenvoy this year to one of those structures, the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community.\r\nIt is well known that sustainable development is\r\nunimaginable without the consolidation of peace and\r\nsecurity in Africa and elsewhere. Despite significant\r\nachievements in tackling the scourge of African\r\nconflicts, conflict still constitutes a major impediment\r\nto the renaissance of the continent.\r\nToday we feel satisfied at witnessing an\r\nencouraging change in the way that African conflicts\r\nare dealt with. More and more responsibility for\r\nconflict resolution is being shouldered by Africans\r\nthemselves. Making full use of the expertise and\r\npotential of the African Union, as well as of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States, the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority of Development and other\r\nregional organizations, has proved to be the most\r\neffective way to restore peace. That is why we trust\r\nthat one of the main priority tasks of the United\r\nNations and the international community at large is to\r\nenhance the capacity and the proactive role of the\r\nAfrican Union and regional bodies in conflict\r\nprevention, management and resolution and in peace\r\nconsolidation. By doing so, the United Nations will\r\nencourage African leadership to eradicate the scourge\r\nof war, breathing new life into Chapter VIII of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nWe strongly believe that this new philosophy of\r\ninteraction among the United Nations, the African\r\nUnion and other African regional organizations in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security has to\r\nbe further developed. In this context, my delegation\r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s intention to instruct\r\nthe relevant United Nations components to produce\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\ncreative ideas on new ways of collaboration between\r\nthe United Nations and the African Union in the light\r\nof changed realities.\r\nUkraine has always been committed to the\r\nobjectives of development, peace and stability in\r\nAfrica. I would like to reaffirm Ukraine’s readiness to\r\ncontinue to take an active part in the promotion of\r\ninternational solidarity and partnership with the\r\nAfrican continent.\r\nMr. Tesfu (Ethiopia): I would like to express my\r\ndelegation’s appreciation to the Secretary-General for\r\nhis comprehensive report (A/59/206) on agenda item\r\n38 (a), “New Partnership for Africa’s Development:\r\nprogress in implementation and international support”.\r\nThe report succinctly presents the actions taken by\r\nAfrican countries and their development partners.\r\nMore important, it draws the international community’s\r\nattention to the constraints on the implementation of\r\nthe objectives and programmes of the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD). We believe that\r\nremoval of those constraints should be the focus of our\r\ndeliberations.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to highlight the\r\nmajor steps taken under the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development at the national and regional\r\nlevels, in accordance with the programme of action.\r\nWith regard to the centrepiece of the NEPAD agenda,\r\nthe Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development\r\nProgramme, bankable projects have been prepared in\r\nmore than 30 African countries. Initial steps have been\r\nundertaken to develop a tracking mechanism to\r\nmonitor the commitment by African Governments to\r\nallocate 10 per cent of their national budgets to\r\nagriculture. Ethiopia is undertaking a food security\r\nstrategy based on our agricultural-development-led\r\nindustrialization.\r\nRegarding the African Peer Review Mechanism\r\n(APRM), a panel of eminent persons has been\r\nidentified. As of July 2004, 23 countries — including\r\nEthiopia — have acceded to the APRM. The first group\r\nof countries to be reviewed have been identified, and\r\nconsultations are being held with Ghana, Rwanda,\r\nMauritius and Kenya.\r\nEthiopia is making progress in establishing good\r\npolitical and economic governance. The Index of\r\nEconomic Freedom, published annually by the\r\nHeritage Foundation, noted that, in 2004, Ethiopia\r\noffered the second most improved business\r\nenvironment in the world.\r\nIn the area of infrastructure, progress has been\r\nmade towards the implementation of a number of high-\r\npriority projects. Those projects are crucial in an effort\r\nto bring about economic integration on the continent,\r\nand they are crucial to Africa’s competitiveness in the\r\nworld market.\r\nThe NEPAD Environmental Action Plan,\r\nincluding detailed priority projects, has been adopted\r\nto protect the environment and to ensure sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Efforts are also being undertaken to\r\nimprove the health, education, tourism,\r\nindustrialization and science and technology sectors.\r\nThese and other positive results have been\r\nachieved because of the new relationship between\r\nAfrica and its partners. In our view, these results\r\nrepresent a beginning of a new era for Africa and its\r\npartners. However, they need to be further enhanced. In\r\nthat regard, we note with appreciation the\r\nestablishment of the Africa Partnership Forum, which\r\nis expected to deepen the policy dialogue in support of\r\nAfrica’s development. We also take note of the Group\r\nof Eight’s reaffirmation of its support for NEPAD, and\r\nwe look forward to the implementation of that\r\ncommitment.\r\n It is imperative to recall that the General\r\nAssembly is debating the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment against the background of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s warning that, at the current pace, most\r\nAfrican countries may not attain the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. We therefore wish to encourage\r\nall partners to continue and strengthen their support for\r\nAfrica’s efforts to develop in the following areas.\r\nThe first area is agricultural development and\r\nfood security. Africa is the only continent where per\r\ncapita food production has been declining over the past\r\nfour decades. Nearly 200 million hungry people live on\r\nthe continent. At present, 7.8 million people are in\r\nneed of food assistance in my country alone. It is for\r\nthat reason that we have accorded priority to\r\nagricultural development in general and to food\r\nsecurity in particular.\r\nThe second area is market access provisions,\r\ncombined with the removal of supply-side constraints.\r\nAlthough we commend the recent decision by the\r\nWorld Trade Organization General Council with regard\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nto the agreement reached on a negotiating framework\r\nin the areas of agriculture, services, development\r\nissues and trade facilitation, we would like to\r\nunderscore the importance of speedy implementation\r\nof the agreed conclusions. Partnership in the area of\r\ntrade capacity should be strengthened to remove the\r\nsupply-side constraints that have stifled the recent\r\nmarket-access initiatives provided to some African\r\ncountries.\r\nThe third area is communicable diseases.\r\nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are serious\r\nproblems in Africa that undermine and even retard its\r\nefforts aimed at socio-economic development. Those\r\ndiseases have become other key causes of poverty by\r\ndepleting the scarce resources available, and thus they\r\nrequire urgent action on the part of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nSince the Assembly is considering the malaria\r\nproblem, let me share my delegation’s view on that\r\nissue. Malaria is one of the 10 deadliest diseases in\r\nEthiopia. Seventy-five per cent of the country is\r\nsusceptible to malaria, and 20 per cent of the\r\npopulation is prone to the disease. In order to\r\neffectively combat this widespread disease, the\r\nGovernment of Ethiopia has been implementing\r\nmalaria prevention programmes for the past 10 years.\r\nSince 2001, the national five-year malaria prevention\r\nstrategy has been integrated into the country’s national\r\nhealth programme.\r\nMoreover, it is reported that the parasite is\r\nincreasing its resistance to the inexpensive anti-\r\nmalarial medicines currently in use. In that connection,\r\nnew products such as artemisine-based combination\r\ntherapies (ACTs) and long-lasting nets are proposed.\r\nHowever, those treatments have been found to be very\r\nexpensive. My delegation therefore takes this\r\nopportunity to urge the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria to re-examine the ACT\r\nfunding programme submitted by Ethiopia.\r\nThe General Assembly, in its resolution 58/237 of\r\n23 December 2003, called on African countries to\r\nimplement the plan of action relating to the “Roll Back\r\nMalaria” initiative. It is to be recalled that the heads of\r\nState or Government called upon African countries to\r\nreduce their taxes on anti- malarial medicines and\r\nlong-lasting nets. Accordingly, Ethiopia has reduced\r\ntaxes levied on nets imported from other sources from\r\n35 per cent to 25 per cent. Ethiopia has also increased\r\nits budget to combat malaria from $1.5 million to\r\n$2.5 million.\r\nTo effectively combat and eradicate the disease in\r\nAfrica, consolidated technical financial and material\r\nassistance — especially through the Global Fund and\r\nthe relevant international organizations — is essential.\r\nThe international community should increase the\r\nresources available to the Global Fund. My delegation\r\nwould like to call upon the World Health Organization,\r\nUNICEF and all other relevant international\r\norganizations involved in implementing the plan of\r\naction to effectively prepare for the 2005 mid-term\r\nreview.\r\nAs members are well aware, we in Africa are\r\nfully committed to NEPAD’s objectives. As we\r\nproceed with the implementation of NEPAD, we wish\r\nto underscore the importance of translating into\r\nconcrete action the positive support provided to\r\nNEPAD in various forums. Such action needs to be\r\nstrengthened. In that connection, we commend the\r\nSecretary-General for establishing the Advisory Panel\r\non International Support for NEPAD.\r\nMr. Kamanzi (Rwanda) (spoke in French): I\r\nshould like to take this opportunity to express to you,\r\nMr. President, my delegation’s appreciation for having\r\nincluded on the agenda consideration of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report entitled “New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment: second consolidated report on progress\r\nin implementation and international support”\r\n(A/59/206). We thank the Secretary-General for his\r\ndetailed and instructive report on the steps taken to\r\nstrengthen the durable partnership between Africa and\r\ndevelopment assistance providers that is the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).\r\nMy delegation fully associates itself with the\r\nstatement made yesterday by the representative of\r\nNigeria on behalf of the African Union.\r\nAfrica has endured unspeakable ordeals,\r\nincluding the difficulties of the colonial period, the\r\nuncertainties of the early years of independence, the\r\nmany recurring internal and inter-State armed conflicts,\r\ngenocide, natural disasters and devastating pandemics\r\nsuch as HIV/AIDS, which every year takes away the\r\nbest human resources of the continent. All that has\r\ntaken place against a background of problems of poor\r\ngovernance, which have characterized some countries\r\nfor several decades.\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nIn that context, efforts to achieve an acceptable\r\nlevel of development for African populations have\r\nbeen markedly slow and insignificant. The result of\r\nthat sorry state of affairs is that the African continent is\r\ncharacterized by the very large percentage of the\r\npopulation living below the poverty line.\r\nWhile the long list of ills afflicting the continent\r\nare far from being overcome, we nonetheless note that\r\nAfrica is undergoing a remarkable renewal in terms of\r\ntaking charge of its own destiny. The question of\r\nAfrica’s development has become a priority for most\r\ncountries on the continent. That is attested to by the\r\nsignificant efforts undertaken by Governments to\r\nimplement policies favourable to economic growth and\r\nthe enhancement of the well-being of their populations.\r\nAt the continental level, the inauguration of NEPAD is\r\nthe result of Africa’s firm determination to take charge\r\nof its own destiny by emphasizing that the ownership\r\nof development programmes should belong to the\r\nbeneficiaries and should be identified and prioritized\r\nby them.\r\nWe welcome the international community’s\r\nrecognition of this new framework for partnership and\r\ntheir unreserved support for it since it was established.\r\nWe also welcome the efforts of the developed countries\r\nthat, through various frameworks for cooperation, have\r\ndemonstrated their determination to support the\r\nimplementation of national and subregional\r\nprogrammes in the framework of NEPAD. The report\r\nof the Secretary-General and preceding speakers have\r\nbeen eloquent in that regard.\r\nI take this opportunity to pay warm tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General’s Special Adviser on Africa,\r\nMr. Gambari, for his very committed advocacy in his\r\ncampaign to give the world a real picture of NEPAD\r\nand its reason for being, as well as for his faith in what\r\nthe African continent can do through that structure to\r\nachieve sustainable development. I strongly support the\r\nwish expressed by preceding speakers that the Office\r\nof the Special Adviser should receive the funding\r\nnecessary to carry out its mission well.\r\nWhile significant steps have been taken towards\r\ndefining the principles underlying the priority\r\ndevelopment programmes and the prerequisites for\r\nachieving them, we should identify the steps to be\r\ntaken for implementing those programmes. We believe\r\nthat it is time to move on to a more sustained stage of\r\nconcrete activity that moves beyond the principles\r\ndefined.\r\nIt is useful to note in a debate such as this that\r\nmost development programmes identified by African\r\ncountries under NEPAD also fall within the overall\r\nframework for achieving the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. Therefore, those programmes should be carried\r\nout in strict respect of the commitments made by the\r\npartners concerned, both the developed and the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nIn that regard, we are facing a genuine deadlock\r\nin which the two partners are shirking their\r\nresponsibilities. The developed countries believe that\r\nthe developing countries have not yet done enough to\r\nrehabilitate their political and socio-economic\r\nenvironment in order for the donor countries to make\r\navailable their pledged financial support. For their part,\r\nthe developing countries claim that they have met the\r\nnecessary conditions and that financial donors must\r\ntherefore respect their commitments.\r\nWe Africans are aware that unresolved problems\r\npersist in the areas of security, good governance and\r\nthe improvement of our policies for economic and\r\nsocial development. We are so conscious of this fact\r\nthat we have committed ourselves to a genuine exercise\r\nof questioning all our old interaction strategies in order\r\nto resolve the problems.\r\nThe completely new philosophy of the African\r\nUnion has demonstrated in the few short years of its\r\nexistence that the leadership of the African continent is\r\nmore than determined to equip itself with the means to\r\ntake charge of the problems that arise on the continent,\r\nwhile acting in concert with other multilateral\r\ninstitutions.\r\nThe African Peer Review Mechanism — for\r\nwhose panel of eminent personalities the work\r\nprogramme and the rules of procedure were adopted in\r\nFebruary 2004 in Kigali — is an important sign of the\r\ncollective resolve to create an environment conducive\r\nto sustainable development in all countries. The\r\nMechanism will enable African countries to carry out a\r\nself-evaluation, to open up to one another and\r\nincreasingly enrich one another by sharing their\r\nsuccessful experiences, developing synergies of\r\nmultisectoral action by breaking through deadlocks and\r\nbottlenecks identified in the common process of mutual\r\nevaluation.\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nThat approach will help to improve the methods\r\nof governance across the continent and enhance\r\nstability within all countries. The process will make it\r\npossible to prevent certain regional conflicts because it\r\ncan help establish a climate of mutual trust and because\r\nit can provide a way to detect in advance causes of\r\npotential conflict.\r\nRwanda is very proud to be among the very first\r\ncountries to adhere to the African Peer Review\r\nMechanism and to submit itself to the peer review\r\nexercise. The preliminary report of that evaluation\r\ncould be submitted on the occasion of the conference\r\non the Mechanism to be held in January 2005.\r\nThe efforts of the African countries call for\r\nfinancial donors to have a less cautious attitude with\r\nrespect to their commitments. At the same time, it is\r\ndesirable that the action plans established in response\r\nto programmes submitted to them should be supported\r\nby coherent execution and follow-up plans, according\r\nto a precise timetable to be discussed with the\r\nbeneficiaries.\r\nWe hope that the upcoming high-level event of\r\nSeptember 2005 will provide an opportunity to\r\ninaugurate a new era of international development\r\nassistance, in which all actions that have been\r\nidentified can be carried out effectively and in a\r\ncoordinated manner. The high-level event could also\r\nlead to a mechanism for consultation and self-\r\nevaluation on the part of donors, with the goal of\r\nproviding permanent assistance for implementation of\r\nthe major decisions for promoting international\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. Aboud (Comoros) (spoke in French): First, I\r\nshall take this opportunity to say how greatly the\r\nGovernment of the Comoros appreciates this meeting,\r\nwhich allows us to consider the root causes of conflict\r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa and to discuss progress in the\r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), as well as the international\r\ncommunity’s support for the Decade to Roll Back\r\nMalaria in Developing Countries, particularly in\r\nAfrica. Allow me also to thank the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for the relevant information contained\r\nin the reports he has submitted to us in documents\r\nA/59/285 and A/59/206.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the\r\nstatements made by the Ambassador of Qatar on behalf\r\nof the Group of 77 and by the representative of Nigeria\r\nspeaking on behalf of the African Union.\r\nThe Union of the Comoros, like certain other\r\nAfrican countries, has not been spared situations that\r\nhave threatened national security and held back\r\ndevelopment. That is why my delegation very much\r\nappreciates the implementation of recommendations\r\naimed at creating a favourable environment for the\r\nharmonious development of Africa.\r\nSince its independence, our country has several\r\ntimes been the victim of coups d’état perpetrated by\r\nforeign mercenaries. Other events have also taken\r\nplace in our young republic that have prevented us\r\nfrom tackling development issues. In addition, in\r\nAugust 1997, a separatist crisis broke out in\r\nAnjouan — one of the islands that make up our\r\nState — that shook the very foundations of the\r\nrepublic. When the international community became\r\naware of that problem, it redoubled its efforts. In\r\nDecember 1997, the Organization of African Unity\r\nconvened the Addis Ababa Conference, followed by\r\nthe Antanarivo Conference in April 1999, in which all\r\nparties concerned participated and which was to lead to\r\nthe signing by the parties of the Antanarivo agreement.\r\nThe refusal by the Anjouan side to sign that agreement\r\nwas seen as a failure of attempts to settle the question\r\nand led to a popular uprising in Grand Comoros.\r\nThe anti-Anjouan riots that were unleashed by\r\ncertain social groups represented a real threat — one\r\nthat could have led to the Balkanization of the\r\nComoros. Given the imminent threat of a civil war, the\r\nnational development army, under the command of\r\narmy Chief of Staff Assoumani Azzali, took the wise\r\ndecision to intervene in order to protect our people.\r\nWhile it is true that the seizure of power, which is\r\nanti-democratic, is neither desirable nor to be\r\nrecommended, we must all agree on certain basic\r\naspects of the question. We need to consider the\r\ncircumstances that led to that decision, the way power\r\nwas seized and the consequences of the coup d’état.\r\nIn that framework, the intervention by the\r\nnational development army on 30 April 1999 spared\r\nour country civil war. There was no bloodshed\r\nwhatsoever, and at no time was the personal integrity\r\nof the political authorities violated. Furthermore, it was\r\nfollowing that intervention that, for the first time since\r\nthe outbreak of the separatist crisis in 1997, a direct\r\ndialogue was begun among the leaders of the separatist\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nmovement and the central Government. That is\r\nnoteworthy because the inter-Comorian dialogue,\r\ninitiated by Colonel Azzali, the President of the Union\r\nof the Comoros, led to the signing of the Fomboni\r\nagreement in June 1999, which laid the groundwork for\r\nthe new Comorian Assembly.\r\nOn the basis of that framework agreement —\r\nwhich was supported by the entire international\r\ncommunity, whose representatives were present when\r\nit was signed — a referendum was held that produced a\r\nnew Constitution granting broad autonomy to the\r\nislands. The agreement signed on 20 December 2003,\r\nthe so-called Beit Salam agreement on transitional\r\narrangements for Comoros, under the auspices of the\r\ninternational community, made it possible to relaunch\r\nthe process of finalizing the creation of the institutions\r\nenvisaged in the Constitution.\r\nThat successful outcome was without a doubt the\r\nresult of the combined efforts of the Comorians, guided\r\nby the President Assoumani Azzali, in the context of\r\nthe inter-Comorian dialogue. We welcome the support\r\nprovided by South Africa, the countries of the region\r\nand the international community as a whole, which\r\nmade every effort to put an end to the separatist crisis\r\nin the Comoros and helped us to establish new national\r\ninstitutions.\r\nLessons can be learned from that difficult\r\nexperience. Economic and social problems are often\r\nthe root causes of the difficulties and crises besetting\r\nour societies. The establishment of an institutional\r\nlegal framework aimed at consolidating the rule of law\r\nis, without a doubt, a positive achievement. However,\r\nit is also clear that the country’s resources and\r\ncapacities are not sufficient to fund the many new State\r\ninstitutions; the country simply does not have the\r\nfinancial means to do so — especially since the Union\r\nof the Comoros has been administered at island and\r\nUnion levels. All the new structures envisaged in the\r\nConstitution are supposed to be put into operation with\r\nno increase in resources.\r\nMalaria, unfortunately, is another major obstacle\r\nto the development of our continent. It is a leading\r\ncause of death in the world. The international\r\ncommunity should therefore mobilize the necessary\r\nresources to combat that disease as well as the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic.\r\nThe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) — an ambitious project designed by Africans\r\nfor Africa — should become a reality supported by all\r\nand beneficial to all. My country believes also that we\r\nshould give in-depth consideration to the situation of\r\nsmall island States, and we believe also in Africa’s\r\ncapacity to take ownership of its future with\r\ndetermination and a sense of responsibility.\r\nFurthermore, we have at our disposal a poverty-\r\nreduction strategy paper — a set of guidelines for our\r\ndevelopment priorities which takes on board the\r\nMillennium Development Goals and fully accords with\r\nthe NEPAD strategy.\r\nIn order for our development process to be\r\nsuccessful — which is a sine qua non for lasting\r\nstability — we need the help of the international\r\ncommunity. The support of members for the draft\r\nresolution on our country is essential, as is their\r\nsupport for the upcoming round table of Comoros\r\ndonor countries.\r\nMindful that peace is a prerequisite for genuine\r\ndevelopment in the country — indeed, without peace\r\nthere can be no development — we believe that there is\r\nno better framework than this body to tackle the\r\nscourges that lead to the conflicts that are ravaging our\r\ncontinent, propose appropriate solutions and create\r\nconditions conducive to harmonious development, so\r\nthat our peoples’ faith in the United Nations can be\r\nstrengthened by seeing what the implementation of this\r\nbody’s recommendations can do for Africa.\r\nMr. Jenie (Indonesia): It is my privilege to\r\nassociate myself with previous speakers who expressed\r\nappreciation for the Secretary-General’s report, entitled\r\n“New Partnership for Africa’s Development: second\r\nconsolidated report on progress in implementation and\r\ninternational support” (A/59/206).\r\nI, too, wish to associate myself with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic on behalf of the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the\r\nrepresentative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nThe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) is a pledge by African leaders, based on a\r\ncommon vision and a firm and shared conviction, that\r\nthey have a pressing duty to eradicate poverty and to\r\nplace their countries, both individually and\r\ncollectively, on a path of sustainable growth and\r\ndevelopment, and at the same time to participate\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.35\r\nactively in the world economy and body politic. That\r\nvision and that conviction has the support of the\r\ninternational community, including Indonesia.\r\nWe note with interest that, as stated in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, much progress has been\r\nmade by African countries in developing sectoral\r\npolicy frameworks, in the implementation of specific\r\nprogrammes and projects and in the earmarking of\r\nfinancial allocations to selected NEPAD sectoral\r\npriorities. Much progress has also been noted in\r\nmoving the African Peer Review Mechanism process\r\nforward. In our view, however, such progress merely\r\nsets the stage for the necessary hard work to deal with\r\ncurrent conflicts, crop failures, food insecurity and\r\nHIV/AIDS, which continue to inflict great misery on\r\nthe African people.\r\nTherefore, addressing these challenges requires a\r\nfar greater and integrated response from both the\r\nGovernments of Africa and the international\r\ncommunity. In that regard, the Millennium Declaration,\r\nNEPAD and the development objectives set out in the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, taken together,\r\nprovide both a framework and mechanisms for the\r\ninternational community to assist Africa in responding\r\nto those problems. We believe that the United Nations\r\nhas a key role in mobilizing international support for\r\nNEPAD.\r\nParticularly encouraging are the invaluable\r\ncontributions currently being made by the United\r\nNations system to ensure the success of the NEPAD\r\ninitiative, including in the areas of conflict resolution\r\nand sustainable development. By placing NEPAD\r\nwithin the framework of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, the United Nations system is making available a\r\nwide range of expertise and support to facilitate the\r\nachievement of NEPAD’s goals.\r\nMy delegation believes that South-South\r\ncooperation is an important complement to\r\ninternational development cooperation. In that regard,\r\ncooperation between African countries and Indonesia\r\nhas been established within the framework of technical\r\ncooperation among developing countries. The\r\nSecretary-General’s report notes that Indonesia\r\nprovided a technical cooperation programme to 11\r\nAfrican countries in 2003. Indonesia stands ready to\r\nadvance such cooperation.\r\nIt is in the spirit of cooperation that the\r\nGovernment of Indonesia, together with the\r\nGovernment of South Africa, initiated the convening of\r\nthe Asian-African Sub-Regional Organizations\r\nConference (AASROC) in Bandung, Indonesia, in July\r\n2003 and in Durban, South Africa, in August 2004.\r\nInspired and guided by the spirit of Bandung — which\r\nbecame manifest in 1955 when the first Asian-African\r\nconference was held there — we are establishing a\r\nNew Asian-African Strategic Partnership (NAASP) to\r\nachieve a better future for countries on both the\r\nAfrican and Asian continents. The NAASP is a\r\npartnership that allows countries of both continents to\r\nunite and make use of the world’s largest pool of\r\nnatural resources and to engage all regional\r\nstakeholders in a concerted endeavour to achieve\r\npeace, stability and prosperity.\r\nYet the NAASP will by no means duplicate\r\nexisting regional initiatives; rather, it will add to them.\r\nIt will build upon and support existing initiatives, such\r\nas NEPAD, the Tokyo International Conference on\r\nAfrican Development, the Association of South-East\r\nAsian Nations, the Sino-Africa process and the India-\r\nAfrica Fund, as well as other initiatives to help create\r\nconditions for sustainable peace and development in\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe AASROC process is also deeply involved in\r\nthe preparations for the Asian-African summit to be\r\nheld in Jakarta and Bandung from 21 to 23 April 2005,\r\nin conjunction with the golden jubilee of the historic\r\n1955 Asian-African Conference. The theme of the\r\nsummit will be “Reinvigorating the Bandung Spirit:\r\nWorking Towards a New Asian-African Strategic\r\nPartnership”. The summit will endorse the NAASP as a\r\nrenewed political spirit aimed at enhancing the\r\ncooperation of the two continents. In preparation for\r\nthat event, Indonesia and South Africa will convene a\r\nmeeting of eminent persons in December 2004 and a\r\npreparatory meeting in February 2005 in Bali,\r\nIndonesia.\r\nFinally, my Government looks forward to\r\nwelcoming the participation of Asian and African\r\nleaders in the Asian-African summit in Indonesia. We\r\nalso look forward to the participation and cooperation\r\nof the relevant bodies and agencies of the United\r\nNations system and other international organizations\r\nand mechanisms, with a view to contributing positively\r\nto the success of the Asian-African summit, as it will\r\ncontribute further to the implementation of NEPAD,\r\nwith the NAASP as one of its building blocks.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
