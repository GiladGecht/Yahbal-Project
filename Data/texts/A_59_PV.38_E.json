The Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is one of the\r\ncornerstones of the international non-proliferation and\r\ndisarmament regime. The total banning of any nuclear\r\nexplosion in any environment will help to end the\r\ndevelopment of ever more sophisticated nuclear\r\nweapons, as well as arrest the proliferation of those\r\nweapons, at a time when concerns about vertical and\r\nhorizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons are at the\r\nfore of the international and peace and security debate.\r\nSince its adoption, the Treaty has been signed by\r\na total of 173 States and has been ratified by 119,\r\nincluding 33 of the 44 States listed in annex 2 of the\r\nTreaty, whose ratification is required for the Treaty’s\r\nentry into force. I am pleased to note that since\r\nOctober 2003 four States have signed the\r\nTreaty — Eritrea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, the Sudan and\r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania — and 14 States have\r\nratified it — Bahrain, Belize, the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, Eritrea, Honduras, Kyrgyzstan, the\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, Liechtenstein, Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, Seychelles, the Sudan, Togo, Tunisia and\r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania. One of the ratifying\r\nStates, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is also\r\nan annex 2 State.\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\nThe increasing number of States committing\r\nthemselves to a complete ban on nuclear explosions\r\nshould not lead to complacency. Eleven States whose\r\nratification is necessary for the entry to force of the\r\nTreaty have not yet ratified, for various reasons. I am\r\ntherefore particularly encouraged by the joint ministerial\r\nstatement on the CTBT initiated by Australia, Finland,\r\nJapan and the Netherlands and adopted on 23\r\nSeptember 2004. It is another example of the support\r\nof States for bringing about the entry into force of the\r\nCTBT; it reinforces the concrete measures to promote\r\nsignature and ratification of the Treaty that were\r\nagreed by the 2003 Conference on Facilitating the\r\nEntry into Force of the CTBT and that are being\r\npursued in the follow-up process to that Conference.\r\nThe main activities of the Preparatory Commission\r\nand its Provisional Technical Secretariat, which started\r\nwork at the Vienna International Centre in March 1997,\r\nhave been the establishment of the verification regime\r\nstipulated by the CTBT and the promotion of\r\nunderstanding and entry into force of the Treaty.\r\nThe global verification regime, which needs to be\r\noperational at the Treaty’s entry into force to monitor\r\ncompliance with the comprehensive ban on all nuclear-\r\ntest explosions, consists of four elements. The\r\nInternational Monitoring System (IMS) and related means\r\nof communication, supported by the International Data\r\nCentre, will be able to detect evidence of possible\r\nnuclear explosions. A consultation and clarification\r\nprocess can clarify and resolve matters concerning\r\npossible non-compliance with the Treaty. Each State\r\nparty will also have the right to request an on-site\r\ninspection in order to clarify whether a nuclear-\r\nweapon-test explosion or any other nuclear explosion\r\nhas been carried out in violation of the Treaty and to\r\ngather facts that might assist in identifying any possible\r\nviolators. Finally, confidence-building measures will\r\ncontribute to resolving compliance concerns arising\r\nfrom possible misinterpretation of verification data,\r\nthereby assisting in the calibration of IMS stations.\r\nThe establishment of the International Monitoring\r\nSystem — a worldwide network comprising 321 seismic\r\nradionuclide hydroacoustic and infrasound monitoring\r\nstations and 16 radionuclide laboratories — is steadily\r\nprogressing. More than 55 per cent of the stations are\r\nnow operational, and we are confident that the network\r\ncan be completed within the next three to four years.\r\nThe current phase of testing and evaluation of the IMS\r\nalready shows promising results. The system already\r\nprovides for global coverage; attaining the strict\r\nstandards for verification after the entry into force of\r\nthe Treaty will, however, require further work.\r\nInternational Monitoring System stations are\r\ntransmitting raw data to the International Data Centre\r\n(IDC) in Vienna through a satellite-based global\r\ncommunications infrastructure that also connects the\r\nInternational Data Centre with States’ national data\r\ncentres. From the IDC both data and the resulting\r\nanalysis bulletins are distributed to national data\r\ncentres. To date, 82 States have established national\r\ndata centres.\r\nOn-site inspection, as provided for in the Treaty,\r\nis a final verification measure, and the development of\r\nthe draft on-site inspection operation manual is a key\r\ntask of the Preparatory Commission in this area.\r\nThe credibility of international disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation agreements frequently hinges on the\r\ncredibility of the verification systems associated with\r\nthem. International verification efforts have been\r\nheavily, and sometimes unfairly, criticized for not\r\nliving up to the high standards required to accomplish\r\ntheir job. In retrospect, however, it was found that\r\nthose international verification efforts were not only\r\nworking properly, but also provided impartial and\r\nuntainted information on the basis of which the\r\ninternational community could take its political\r\ndecisions.\r\nVerification of international agreements is a\r\ndifficult, slow and costly enterprise. I would like to thank\r\nall States that are supporting the strengthening of our\r\nverification system technically, financially and\r\npolitically and promise that we will do our utmost to\r\nlive up to the high expectations for our monitoring\r\ncapabilities.\r\nThe primary purpose of the CTBT is to ensure an\r\nend to nuclear-test explosions globally, thus enhancing\r\nnational and international security. However, the CTBT\r\nverification technologies have the potential to offer\r\nimportant additional benefits derived from the IMS\r\ndata and the activities of the International Data Centre.\r\nSeismic, hydroacoustic and infrasound data can be\r\nused in studies of the Earth’s structure and for research\r\non earthquakes, volcanic eruption forecasting, tsunami\r\nwarnings, underwater explosion location and sea\r\ntemperature and climate change monitoring. Infrasound\r\ndata can assist in minimizing the effect of volcanic\r\noperations on civil aviation and can be used for\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\natmospheric and meteorological studies. The IMS\r\nradionuclide network offers opportunities for detecting\r\nradionuclide dispersion, monitoring radiation levels,\r\nstudying natural radioactivity, biological research and\r\nenvironmental change investigations.\r\nThe Preparatory Commission continues to\r\norganize training programmes and workshops to\r\nsupport the enhancement of the national capabilities of\r\nStates signatories in the implementation of the Treaty.\r\nThose include training courses for IMS station\r\noperators for national data centre managers and\r\ntechnical staff on data analysis, storage and\r\nmanagement, on the global communications\r\ninfrastructure and on on-site inspection technologies.\r\nIn the field of international cooperation, the\r\nProvisional Technical Secretariat continues its role as\r\nan information clearing house and provides support for\r\nthe advancement of the Commission’s work, including\r\ninformation visit programmes to support IMS and IDC\r\nactivities.\r\nVoluntary contributions from member States have\r\nbeen received to support those activities. In 2004, an\r\ninternational cooperation workshop for States from\r\nNorthern Africa took place in Tunis from 29 November\r\nto 1 December, and an international cooperation\r\nworkshop for States from Southern Africa will be held\r\nin Pretoria. Such workshops help identify a range of\r\nmeasures to enhance support for and further\r\nparticipation in the work of the Commission, as well as\r\nadvance national implementation of the Treaty.\r\nFollowing the adoption by the General Assembly\r\non 15 June 2000 of the Agreement to Regulate the\r\nRelationship between the United Nations and the\r\nPreparatory Commission (resolution 54/280, annex),\r\nour relations and interactions with the United Nations\r\nand its programmes, funds and specialized agencies\r\nhave intensified. Cooperation with the United Nations\r\nDepartment for Disarmament Affairs, including the\r\nthree regional centres, is of particular importance to the\r\nCommission, and I would like use this opportunity to\r\nthank the Department for its dedicated work. A service\r\nagreement with the Commission concluded with the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme provides us\r\nwith operational support. The World Meteorological\r\nOrganization is receiving data from the Monitoring\r\nSystem for research purposes. Potential fields for\r\ncooperation are being explored with other\r\norganizations of the United Nations system.\r\nThe CTBT was assigned a special role in the\r\ndisarmament-related chapter of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, and, within its limited possibilities, the\r\nCommission is supporting States in the implementation\r\nof the relevant provisions of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. The five-year review, scheduled for fall\r\n2005, will provide an opportunity to discuss further\r\naction in this respect. Depending on the wishes of the\r\nratifying States of the CTBT, the next conference on\r\narticle XIV could coincide with the General Assembly’s\r\ndeliberations on the Millennium Declaration; both\r\nprocesses could benefit from such proximity. In order\r\nto contribute fully to the work of the United Nations\r\nfamily, including the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, the Preparatory Commission\r\nhas requested full membership in the United Nations\r\nSystem Chief Executive Board for Coordination. This\r\nwould not only allow for a strengthened cooperation\r\nand synergy; it would also provide that body with\r\nessential expertise in the field of nuclear disarmament\r\nand non-proliferation.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to underline that eight\r\nyears of developments since the CTBT’s opening for\r\nsignature have confirmed the international\r\ncommunity’s growing support for it and its recognition\r\nof the Treaty as an important instrument in nuclear\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. By signing and\r\nratifying the CTBT, States confirm their commitment\r\nto these shared goals.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to the Director-General of the Organization for\r\nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Mr. Rogelio\r\nPfirter, who will present the report of that Organization.\r\nMr. Pfirter (Organization for the Prohibition of\r\nChemical Weapons) (spoke in French): First of all,\r\nallow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to\r\nthe presidency of this Assembly. You represent a\r\ncountry, Gabon, and a continent, Africa, that are called\r\nupon to play a central role in the definition of a more\r\njust, united and, above all, peaceful world. I welcome\r\nthe opportunity granted to me to speak this morning\r\nunder your presidency.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nTwo years ago, I addressed the General Assembly\r\nfor the first time following my appointment as\r\nDirector-General of the Technical Secretariat of the\r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\r\n(OPCW). The intervening period has been an eventful\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\none for the OPCW and for the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention. On that occasion, two years ago, I came\r\nhere to outline some of my priorities and to discuss the\r\nchallenges ahead. Today, I intend to give an overview\r\nof what we have been able to achieve in the past two\r\nyears, but I will also discuss the many challenges that\r\nremain on our agenda.\r\nIn 2002, the OPCW comprised 146 member\r\nStates, and was verifying the destruction of chemical\r\nweapons and related facilities in four possessor States.\r\nToday, the number of Member States has grown to 167,\r\nand our verification activities extend to two more\r\npossessor States — the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and\r\nAlbania — that have declared chemical weapons\r\nstockpiles.\r\nTwo years ago, I spoke about the preparations we\r\nwere making for our First Review Conference, and\r\nhow we expected it to assess the first years of\r\noperation of the Convention and, most important, to\r\ngive us guidance for the future. Today, I can report to\r\nthis General Assembly that the objectives of that\r\nimportant Conference were successfully fulfilled.\r\nMember States agreed on and unequivocally reaffirmed\r\nthe validity and the crucial importance of the\r\nConvention and, with an eye to the future, approved\r\ntwo important action plans: one on the implementation\r\nof article VII of the Convention, and another on the\r\nuniversality of the Convention. Through these\r\ninitiatives, States parties rightly focused on two areas\r\nthat require the most urgent attention. We have been\r\nworking hard on both.\r\nWith regard to universality, we have, as I\r\nmentioned, increased our membership by 21, with each\r\nregion of the globe contributing new States parties.\r\nParticularly encouraging are the accessions or\r\nratifications by a good number of African and Asia-\r\nPacific countries. It gives me particular pleasure to\r\ncongratulate the Republic of Madagascar, which\r\ndeposited its instrument of ratification with the\r\nSecretary-General yesterday.\r\nHowever, as we move forward towards universal\r\nparticipation in the Convention, there is no room for\r\ncomplacency, since a few important countries still\r\nremain outside the realm of the chemical weapons ban.\r\nWhile in most of those cases we are confident that\r\nprogress is being made and that a good number of non-\r\nsignatory and signatory States will join the Convention\r\nin the near future, some areas of concern still remain,\r\nwhich are marked by conflict or tension where linkage\r\nand conditionality still prevail. The Middle East and\r\nthe Korean peninsula are two cases in point.\r\nAs I have indicated on numerous occasions, when\r\nit comes to promoting the proscription of weapons of\r\nmass destruction, we cannot accept the logic of\r\nimpotence and immobility. While we respect the\r\nconcerns and the legitimate priorities of those who\r\nmust live in areas marked by mistrust and sometimes\r\nby violence, we must at the same time emphasize with\r\nvigour and determination our conviction that nothing\r\ncan justify retaining the use of chemical weapons as an\r\noption. Two weeks ago, in my address to the First\r\nCommittee of the General Assembly, I recalled that\r\nchemical weapons have been forever banned the world\r\nover — with no exceptions, and no ifs, ands, or buts.\r\nThe Convention, a multilateral treaty negotiated under\r\nthe aegis of the United Nations, bans weapons that can\r\nbe used effectively only against unprotected civilians.\r\nToday, I ask the same question I posed at the\r\nmeeting of the First Committee on 7 October: what\r\ncould possibly justify refraining from joining this\r\ntreaty? In this context, I think it is appropriate to\r\nmention the case of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, which\r\nhad developed and manufactured weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and which has now taken the courageous\r\ndecision to get rid of them. As we speak, OPCW\r\ninspectors are verifying the destruction of those\r\narsenals, which thus no longer threaten the security of\r\nNorth Africa and the Middle East. I wish to praise the\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya for its courageous decision to\r\njoin the overwhelming majority of nations under the\r\nchemical weapons ban, and for the exemplary manner\r\nin which it has been observing its obligations under the\r\nConvention.\r\nJust a few days ago in The Hague, our Executive\r\nCouncil approved a recommendation to make a\r\ntechnical change to the Convention extending the\r\ndeadline for conversion of some former chemical\r\nweapons production facilities for new member States.\r\nHopefully, once our Conference of States Parties\r\napproves the change next month, it will allow for the\r\nconversion of two facilities in Rabta, the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya, which, after having been used in the past to\r\nmanufacture weapons of mass destruction, will now\r\nproduce medicine for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and\r\nother diseases. Those medications will be made\r\navailable at low cost in Africa. This example thus\r\nshows how, within the parameters of the Convention,\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\nthere is an opportunity for new member States to turn\r\ntheir capacities away from the pursuit of nefarious\r\npurposes and towards the pursuit of the common weal.\r\nThe other crucial area that the Review\r\nConference mandated us to work on with a renewed\r\nsense of urgency is national implementation of the\r\nConvention. Here, some progress is being made in\r\nterms of the elaboration of domestic legislation and the\r\nestablishment of the national authorities required to\r\nmake the Convention effective, but much more remains\r\nto be done. According to our estimates, roughly 40 per\r\ncent of our States parties have legislation in place that\r\ncan be considered comprehensive and adequate in\r\nterms of the Convention.\r\nMany countries are still grappling with\r\nbureaucratic or financial obstacles, which must be\r\novercome as soon as possible. The action plan sets the\r\ntenth session of the Conference of the States Parties in\r\n2005 as a deadline for taking stock of the situation and\r\ndetermining the way ahead. I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to remind all States Members of the United\r\nNations that are also parties to the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention that we are ready to assist them, on\r\nrequest, with any practical aspect of implementation.\r\nPeace and security are inextricably linked, as are\r\nthe bodies mandated to strive for them. Our work at the\r\nOPCW, although independent of that of the United\r\nNations, is inseparably linked from the wider efforts of\r\nthe international community in this regard.\r\nThis is why the adoption by the Security Council\r\nof resolution 1373 (2001) on terrorism and of\r\nresolution 1540 (2004) on preventing non-State actors\r\nfrom gaining access to weapons of mass destruction is\r\nalso important to the goals of the Convention. We have\r\nindicated to the newly appointed Executive Director of\r\nthe Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate\r\nand to the Chairman of the Committee established\r\npursuant to resolution 1540 (2004) that we are ready\r\nand willing to extend any technical assistance,\r\ninformation and advice that are required to prevent the\r\nominous possibility of terrorist groups gaining access\r\nto weapons of mass destruction or related materials —\r\nin our case, chemical-warfare agents.\r\nThis new dimension of our work is underpinned\r\nby the usual cooperation between the OPCW and the\r\nUnited Nations, in particular the Department for\r\nDisarmament Affairs, within the framework of the\r\nRelationship Agreement between the two organizations.\r\nWe are determined to strengthen and deepen this\r\ncooperation within the mandates of the United Nations\r\nand the OPCW — mandates that will clearly present\r\nmany areas of convergence as the international context\r\nchanges and as responses are needed to deal with the\r\nnew challenges that are confronting us.\r\nI would like to close with a brief overview of the\r\nOPCW’s main activities. As I said earlier, in the\r\nverification area the number and range of our tasks\r\nhave increased over the past two years, with 21\r\nadditional States joining the Convention, including two\r\npossessor States, Libya and Albania. We have begun\r\nverifying the destruction of Libya’s chemical weapons\r\nstockpiles, and we will soon begin verifying the\r\ndestruction and conversion of its production facilities,\r\nonce the relevant plans are approved by our policy-\r\nmaking organs.\r\nIn Albania, the small arsenal that was discovered\r\nwill be disposed of in the near future. The United\r\nStates of America is continuing its destruction\r\ncampaign at a faster pace, with the addition of one new\r\ndestruction facility in Umatilla and two others that will\r\nbegin operating in the next few months. The Russian\r\nFederation, which has the largest stockpile, is also\r\nmoving ahead, and we expect at least two more\r\ndestruction facilities to go on line there within the next\r\nyear or so. We look forward to new impetus and\r\nprogress with regard to the Russian destruction\r\nprogramme as the inflexible deadlines of the\r\nConvention approach.\r\nIndia has set an example, having to date\r\ndestroyed more than is required by the deadlines set\r\nout in the Convention, while another State party is also\r\nmaking steady progress.\r\nIndustry verification is becoming increasingly\r\nimportant at a time when there are serious concerns\r\nabout the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nKeeping in mind the high priority to be accorded to the\r\nmost dangerous facilities, the chemical industry must\r\nbe inspected if the Convention is to retain its deterrent\r\nvalue. We are very active on this front, counting on the\r\nunstinting support of member States and industrial\r\nassociations the world over. Such associations want\r\ntheir activities validated as legitimate by the OPCW’s\r\nverification regime.\r\nInternational cooperation and assistance in the\r\npeaceful uses of chemistry continue to go hand in hand\r\nwith disarmament and non-proliferation. That is\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\nanother crucial factor in the equation of the\r\nConvention.\r\nWe continue to give support to developing\r\nnations through a variety of programmes aimed at\r\nreinforcing technical capacities and skills and, to the\r\nextent possible, providing support to laboratories at\r\nselected institutions. Through initiatives like our\r\nAssociate Programme and with the full support of the\r\nchemical industry, we train and support experts from\r\ndeveloping nations in the peaceful uses of chemistry.\r\nSimilarly, in the area of assistance and protection\r\nagainst the threat or use of chemical weapons, we\r\nprovide training to, and foster capacity-building in, our\r\nmember States. In recent months we have been able to\r\nrespond positively to numerous requests, especially\r\nfrom countries in the Gulf region, where we have\r\nprovided technical support to help our member States\r\nimprove or develop their protective capacities in a\r\nregion where chemical weapons are a real concern.\r\nIn closing, let me say how honoured I am to have\r\nhad this opportunity to report to the highest body of the\r\nUnited Nations on the work of the Organization for the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons in pursuit of the\r\nnoble goal of contributing to international peace and\r\nsecurity through disarmament and non-proliferation.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I give the floor\r\nto the representative of Indonesia to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.1.\r\nMr. Jenie (Indonesia): It is my pleasure, as the\r\ncurrent Chairman of the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Organization (AALCO), to introduce the\r\nagenda item entitled “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nOrganization”.\r\nIt was a matter of pride for AALCO and its\r\nmember States that the General Assembly accorded the\r\norganization permanent observer status in 1980. A\r\nprogramme of cooperation was then established,\r\npursuant to resolution 36/38 of 18 November 1981.\r\nSince then, AALCO has enjoyed meaningful and\r\nfruitful cooperation with the United Nations. The\r\norganization has had as many as 16 cooperative\r\narrangements with the United Nations, its agencies and\r\nother intergovernmental organizations.\r\nMy country, Indonesia, had the honour of hosting,\r\nin Bali in June this year, the forty-third annual session\r\nof AALCO. During the session we discussed 16 items,\r\nwith the objective of contributing to the progressive\r\ndevelopment of international law. Among those issues\r\nwere the transnational crime of trafficking in women\r\nand children, corruption, the deportation of\r\nPalestinians, the jurisdictional immunities of States and\r\ntheir property, the extraterritorial application of\r\nnational legislation and expressions of folklore and its\r\ninternational protection. A one-day special meeting\r\nwas also organized on 23 June 2004 on the agenda item\r\nentitled “Establishing cooperation against trafficking in\r\nwomen and children”.\r\nThe broad range of legal issues discussed during\r\nthe session reflects the role of the AALCO in the\r\npromotion and codification of international law. That is\r\nconsistent with the role that the organization has\r\nplayed since its inception in 1956 in fostering the\r\ncommon interest of Asian and African States on the\r\npromotion of international law.\r\nI should also like to recall that Indonesia had the\r\nprivilege of hosting the historic Bandung 1955\r\nConference of the Asian-African States. AALCO was\r\nestablished a year later, in 1956, as an important\r\noutcome of that Conference. When the twenty-fifth\r\nanniversary of the Asia-Africa Bandung Conference\r\nwas commemorated in 1980, AALCO also convened its\r\ntwenty-first session in Indonesia.\r\nIn this regard, the convening of the AALCO\r\nConference last year and the forthcoming Asia-Africa\r\nSummit to be held in conjunction with the golden\r\njubilee of the Bandung Conference of 1955, to be held\r\nin Indonesia in April next year, provide important\r\nmomentum for Asian and African countries. The\r\nAsian-African Summit in 2005 is expected to adopt a\r\nnew strategic partnership between Asia and Africa and\r\nthereby to reinvigorate the important contributions of\r\nthe Asian-African Conference of 1955 to the promotion\r\nof a just and equitable world order.\r\nNext month, November 2005, marks a decade\r\nsince the entry into force of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, the most\r\ncomprehensive legal framework on ocean affairs. The\r\nmarathon negotiation process on that subject witnessed\r\ngreat contributions by the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Organization (AALCO) in the shaping of\r\ninternational law. Given recent developments in ocean\r\naffairs, the law of the sea remains an important item on\r\nthe AALCO agenda as reflected in the activities of its\r\nforty-third session.\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\nHowever, the issue of the law of the sea\r\nconstitutes only one area where the AALCO has been\r\nactively involved in the lawmaking process in the\r\nUnited Nations. Within the United Nations, the impact\r\nof the AALCO has also been felt in areas ranging from\r\ninternational trade law and environmental law to the\r\npromotion of human rights and the battle against\r\ncorruption. A detailed account of the activities of\r\nAALCO during the biennium 2002-2004 can be found\r\nin the report of the Secretary-General contained in\r\ndocument A/59/303. The report reviews the activities\r\nof the AALCO, focusing on its relations with the\r\nUnited Nations system. The Secretary-General of the\r\nAALCO, in his statement later in the current session of\r\nthe General Assembly, will deal with the highlights of\r\nthe activities of the AALCO during the past two years.\r\nAALCO is committed to continuing its close and\r\neffective cooperation with the United Nations. The\r\ncontinuing efforts of the AALCO towards\r\nstrengthening the role of the United Nations and its\r\nvarious organs in enhancing the rule of law and wider\r\nadherence to related international instruments need to\r\nbe recognized.\r\nWith that objective in view, I would like to place\r\nbefore the Assembly the draft resolution contained in\r\ndocument A/59/L.1. The draft resolution, as of now, is\r\njointly sponsored by Bangladesh, the People’s\r\nRepublic of China, Cyprus, Egypt, Ghana, India, the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, the\r\nRepublic of Korea, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar,\r\nNigeria, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan,\r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic and Thailand.\r\nThe draft resolution underlines the importance of\r\nenhancing existing cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the AALCO in the codification of\r\ninternational law. It also acknowledges the important\r\nrelationships between the AALCO and the United\r\nNations and its agencies and other intergovernmental\r\norganizations with a view to promoting cooperation in\r\nthe field of international law among States in the Asian\r\nand African regions.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation believes that the\r\ncontribution of the AALCO to the promotion of\r\ninternational law will enhance the goals of the United\r\nNations. Draft resolution A/59/L.1 serves to provide a\r\nwider opportunity to achieve this objective. I urge the\r\nGeneral Assembly to adopt the draft resolution, in\r\nsupport of this fruitful cooperation.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nthe representative of Tajikistan to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.3.\r\nMr. Alimov (Tajikistan) (spoke in Russian): It is\r\na great honour for me, as the representative of the\r\ncountry currently chairing the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization (ECO), to address the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly on agenda item 56 (h) entitled,\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization”. Recently, we\r\nhave witnessed enhanced partnerships between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations in achieving\r\ncommon goals of peace, stability and development. Much\r\nattention is devoted to that issue by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, by whose initiative regular meetings of leading\r\nregional organizations are convened at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters. It is important to note that at such\r\nmeetings, participants not only exchange experience\r\ngained in various spheres of activity, but also identify\r\nnew issues that can be dealt with through cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations — while keeping in mind the\r\nspecific characteristics and advantages of particular\r\nregional organizations.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nand other organizations (A/59/303) provides an\r\nimpressive picture of United Nations interactions with\r\na whole spectrum of regional organizations. One of\r\nthem is the Economic Cooperation Organization, which\r\ncomprises 10 States: Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan,\r\nTajikistan, Turkmenistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan.\r\nThe Economic Cooperation Organization is\r\namong those regional organizations that consider the\r\nintegration of their member States into the world\r\neconomy and participation in the process of\r\nglobalization to be among their main goals. Possessing\r\nconsiderable human and natural resources, the States\r\nmembers of the Economic Cooperation Organization\r\nhave made significant progress in this area.\r\nThe situation in Afghanistan, which has\r\ndramatically changed over the past two years, provides\r\nnew opportunities for the organization to develop. We\r\nbelieve that we can achieve further progress by\r\nimproving interaction and coordination of our own\r\nefforts with those of other international organizations,\r\nfirst and foremost with the United Nations, cooperation\r\nwith which is of priority importance to ECO member\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\nStates. That idea was once again emphasized at the\r\neighth meeting of ECO leaders, held in Dushanbe, the\r\ncapital of Tajikistan, in September 2004.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that the interaction\r\nbetween various organizations of the United Nations\r\nsystem and the ECO has been gaining momentum over\r\nthe past two years. Here, let me mention in particular\r\ncooperation with the Economic and Social Commission\r\nfor Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). The interaction\r\nbetween ESCAP and the ECO embraces a broad range\r\nof economic and social issues faced by the 300 million\r\npeople who reside within our States. The ECO is a part\r\nof the consultative mechanism of ESCAP consultative\r\nmeetings. From our viewpoint, it is most important to\r\ndevelop cooperation on such issues as macroeconomic\r\npolicy, trade and investments, transportation and\r\nenvironmental protection. Formulation of a regional\r\nintergovernmental agreement on the Asian Highway\r\nnetwork was an important milestone.\r\nCooperation between the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization (ECO) and the Economic and Social\r\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the\r\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Europe\r\n(UNECE) within the context of a specific programme\r\nfor the economies of Central Asia is gaining\r\nmomentum. The memorandum of understanding signed\r\nby ECO and the United Nations Economic Commission\r\nfor Europe on 24 June 2003 envisages large prospects\r\nfor cooperation between ECO and the Commission.\r\nThere is an entire list of agreed areas for cooperation\r\nbetween the two organizations, including transport and\r\ntrade, industry and entrepreneurship, stable development\r\nof energy, environmental protection, economic\r\nanalysis, statistics and others.\r\nOur hope is that the ties of cooperation between\r\nECO and the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) and between ECO and the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\r\nwill expand. We express our satisfaction with the\r\ncurrent interaction with the International Trade Centre\r\nof the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment and the World Trade Organization and\r\nwith the United Nations Industrial Development\r\nOrganization (UNIDO). We attach great importance to\r\nthe cooperation with the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) and with the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).\r\nOur view is that the interaction between the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization and the United\r\nNations International Drug Control Programme is not\r\nbeing used to its fullest capacity. The ECO counts on\r\nexpanding the existing framework of cooperation in the\r\ncommon struggle against the world narcotics problem.\r\nIn 2005, ECO will be celebrating the twentieth\r\nanniversary of its establishment. For more than half of\r\nthat time, ECO has cooperated closely with the United\r\nNations as an Observer. Further promotion and\r\ndevelopment of the cooperation between the United\r\nNations and ECO will serve, not only to rationalize\r\neconomic ties among the countries of the region, but\r\nalso to optimize their trade relationship with the rest of\r\nthe world.\r\nOn behalf of the ECO member States, I have the\r\nhonour to submit, for the consideration of the General\r\nAssembly, draft resolution A/59/L.3 entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization”. The draft\r\nresolution reflects the level of interaction reached by\r\nthe two organizations over the past two years.\r\nThe sponsors of the draft resolution call on\r\nUnited Nations Member States to adopt the draft\r\nresolution by consensus.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nthe representative of Chile, who will present draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.5.\r\nMr. Muñoz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I have the\r\nhonour to introduce to the General Assembly the draft\r\nresolution entitled “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union”, in\r\ndocument A/59/L.5.\r\nThe draft resolution enjoys broad support among\r\nmany delegations from all regions of the world. I am\r\npleased to report that the draft has 78 sponsors.\r\nAfter the circulation of the first draft on 15\r\nOctober, we received contributions and proposed\r\namendments from some countries. As a result of\r\nconsultations, I have the pleasure to introduce a text\r\nthat was revised in light of those proposals. It will be\r\ndistributed tomorrow in all official languages.\r\nThe draft resolution that I have the honour to\r\nintroduce is highly important to the Organization. It is the\r\noutcome of several years of joint work in the United\r\nNations by its Member States and the Inter-Parliamentary\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\nUnion (IPU), together with many national parliaments,\r\ntowards strengthening the contribution that this sector\r\ncan make to multilateral cooperation.\r\nThe scope and quality of such cooperation have\r\nbeen described in detail in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional and other organizations (A/59/303). In his\r\nreport, the Secretary-General welcomes the close\r\nsubstantive relationship between the United Nations\r\nand the Inter-Parliamentary Union, a relationship that\r\nis constantly growing and developing, particularly\r\nsince IPU received Observer status in the General\r\nAssembly two years ago.\r\nIn recognition of the contribution of IPU towards\r\nachieving the goals and purposes of the international\r\ncommunity, the Secretary-General has also welcomed\r\nthe decision to hold the second Conference of\r\nPresiding Officers of National Parliaments in 2005,\r\nwhich will focus on the contribution that parliaments\r\ncan make towards achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs).\r\nIn subsequent consultations, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and many Member States have expressed\r\nparticular interest in having this high-level conference\r\ntake place at United Nations Headquarters in New York\r\nas a joint meeting between the United Nations and IPU\r\non the eve of the high-level event planned for the\r\nsixtieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe are living at a time of great change, which\r\nimplies a significant evolution of international\r\nrelations and which means that our peoples and\r\ninternational organizations must work more closely\r\ntogether. That also creates the necessity for the national\r\nparliaments to contribute to international cooperation,\r\nas a basic element of any democratic State.\r\nThus, the national parliaments bear the\r\nconstitutional responsibility of representing their\r\npeoples. Moreover, they play an important role in\r\ntranslating United Nations agreements into effective\r\nnational policy.\r\nFor that reason, in the Millennium Declaration,\r\nour Heads of States and Governments decided to\r\nstrengthen cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nnational parliaments, working through the IPU. That\r\ncooperation has become increasingly relevant in light\r\nof the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations of the Panel of\r\nEminent Persons on United Nations-Civil Society\r\nRelations.\r\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, more\r\nthan 200 legislators from throughout the world, met\r\nhere at United Nations Headquarters to consider the\r\ntopic of disarmament for lasting peace: defining the\r\nrole of the parliamentarian. Availing themselves of the\r\nopportunity for a substantive exchange of views and\r\nideas, parliamentarians, senior officials of the United\r\nNations and Permanent Representatives of diplomatic\r\nmissions discussed topics related to strengthening\r\ninternational regimes on arms control and\r\ndisarmament, the needs and objectives of peacekeeping\r\nwith an integrated focus on peacebuilding.\r\nNot only did they reach a better understanding of\r\nthose complex processes, but they also made a\r\ncommitment to play a more active role in supporting\r\ninternational goals and objectives.\r\nWe trust, as do many other delegations in this\r\nHall, that we are correct in sending a clear message\r\nthat will encourage increased cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and IPU.\r\nThe sponsors of draft resolution A/59/L.5 express\r\nthe hope that it will be adopted by consensus.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nthe representative of the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic, who will be speaking on behalf of the\r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and\r\nwill introduce draft resolution A/59/L.6.\r\nMr. Kittikhoun (Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic): I have the honour, on behalf of the 10 member\r\nStates of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations:\r\nBrunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar,\r\nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/59/L.6, entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations”. May I thank\r\nall the other sponsors, namely, Australia, Azerbaijan,\r\nBangladesh, Bhutan, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Canada,\r\nChile, China, Cuba, Cyprus, Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea, Dominican Republic, Egypt, El\r\nSalvador, France, Gabon, Guinea, India, Japan,\r\nKazakhstan, Maldives, Mongolia, Nauru, New\r\nZealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Republic of\r\nKorea, Romania, Russian Federation, Samoa, South\r\nAfrica, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Timor-Leste, United States\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\nof America and Yemen for their support to this draft\r\nresolution.\r\nCooperation between the Association of\r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the United\r\nNations has been pursued for many decades. That\r\ncooperation began soon after the establishment of\r\nASEAN in 1967, largely through the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), which formally\r\nbecame a special dialogue partner of ASEAN in 1977\r\nand is the only United Nations agency accorded\r\ndialogue partner status in ASEAN so far.\r\nNevertheless, in addition to the ASEAN-UNDP\r\ndialogue partnership, several other United Nations\r\nagencies have also been engaged in cooperation in\r\nvarious areas such as poverty eradication, human\r\nresource development, good governance, disaster\r\nprevention, environment and sustainable development,\r\nscience and technology, health and disease prevention,\r\nprotection of women and children, peacebuilding and\r\nso on.\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 57/35 of 21 November\r\n2002 on cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nASEAN represented a new milestone in that\r\ncooperation. It sought to generate additional impetus to\r\nthe existing cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand ASEAN.\r\nAllow me to highlight some areas of fruitful\r\ncooperation that deserve to be mentioned: in the field of\r\nsocial development, UNAIDS has rendered beneficial\r\nassistance to ASEAN. It helps with funding for a series\r\nof workshops and provides technical experts to work\r\nwith ASEAN in implementing its regional programme\r\non HIV/AIDS prevention and control.\r\nConcerning health issues, a four-year memorandum\r\nof understanding between ASEAN and the World Health\r\nOrganization (WHO) focusing on communicable and\r\nnon-communicable diseases, the promotion of healthy\r\nlifestyles, food safety and new emerging diseases was\r\nconcluded in 1997. Upon its expiration, the sixth\r\nASEAN Health Ministers Meeting, held in March\r\n2002, agreed to extend it for another five years. Its\r\nfruitful implementation was clearly demonstrated when\r\nthe ASEAN+3 group of countries in cooperation with\r\nWHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of\r\nthe United Nations (FAO), had to act promptly on the\r\nprevention and control of the deadly severe acute\r\nrespiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic.\r\nIn the area of trade and economic cooperation, a\r\nnumber of regional seminars on World Trade\r\nOrganization-related matters, focusing on capacity-\r\nbuilding for ASEAN member countries in multilateral\r\ntrade negotiations, have been organized jointly by the\r\nUnited Nations and ASEAN.\r\nPeace and security cooperation is also a\r\ndimension that has been enhanced — the project\r\n“Towards a Culture of Peace” has been launched and\r\ncarried out. The Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free-\r\nZone, part of the cooperation between ASEAN and the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has been\r\npursued consistently.\r\nA most commendable effort on both sides to\r\nstrengthen mutual cooperation has involved annual\r\nmeetings between Presidents of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly, the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral and ASEAN Foreign Ministers with the\r\npresence of the ASEAN Secretary-General.\r\nThe last annual meeting was held on 28 September\r\n2004, during the general debate of the current General\r\nAssembly session, when the two parties were able to\r\nexchange views on issues of common interest and\r\nagree to hold the second United Nations-ASEAN\r\nSummit in 2005, during the sixtieth session of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly.\r\nIn late November of this year, the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic will host the tenth ASEAN\r\nSummit and other ASEAN-related summits with\r\nASEAN dialogue partners in Vientiane, our capital\r\ncity. On that occasion, a number of important\r\ndocuments, including the Vientiane action programme,\r\nwhich will last for the next six years, will be adopted,\r\nwith the objective of accelerating regional integration\r\nleading towards the establishment of the ASEAN\r\nCommunity by 2020.\r\nLike other regional groups, ASEAN is making\r\nheadway towards achieving the Millennium Development\r\nGoals (MDGs), although the progress remains uneven, as\r\nindicated in the report of the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization presented to\r\nthe present session of the General Assembly. We\r\ncannot agree more with the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendation that achieving the MDGs\r\n“will be possible only if developed and developing\r\ncountries institute the right combination of national\r\nand international policies and implement their\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\nshared commitments, as set out in the United\r\nNations Millennium Declaration and the\r\nMonterrey Consensus.” (A/59/1, para. 117)\r\nWe also believe that strengthened cooperation between\r\nregional organizations such as ASEAN with the United\r\nNations will contribute significantly to the attainment\r\nof internationally agreed goals, including the MDGs.\r\nFor that reason, the adoption of the draft resolution\r\nnow being presented would be of great benefit to both\r\nthe United Nations and ASEAN.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to the representative of Japan, who will introduce\r\ndraft resolution A/59/L.7.\r\nMr. Kitaoka (Japan): In its capacity as Chair of\r\nthe Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO),\r\nJapan, together with the other sponsors, has the honour\r\nand pleasure to introduce to the Assembly for adoption\r\nthe draft resolution contained in document A/59/L.7,\r\nentitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization”.\r\nThe draft resolution is primarily of a procedural\r\nnature and is meant to serve as a basis for the CTBTO\r\nto inform the General Assembly of its activities during\r\nthe latter’s sixty-first session. In its preambular part,\r\nthe draft resolution takes note of both the note of the\r\nSecretary-General on the cooperation between the two\r\norganizations and the report of the Executive Secretary\r\nof the Commission. In its operative paragraph, it\r\ndecides to include the same sub-item in the provisional\r\nagenda of the sixty-first session.\r\nSince the publication of the draft resolution, the\r\nfollowing countries have become sponsors: Australia,\r\nPortugal, Spain, Russian Federation, Malta, Slovakia,\r\nUnited Kingdom, Ireland, Israel, Lithuania, Greece,\r\nBangladesh, Turkey, Germany and Romania. It is our\r\nhope that the draft resolution will be adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly with the broadest support possible.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to briefly\r\ntouch upon the subject of cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and other organizations. We believe\r\nthat in addressing regional issues, it is essential to\r\nensure ownership by the countries in the region and\r\ntheir regional organizations. We are happy to note that\r\nsuch ownership has been demonstrated by, for\r\nexample, the African Union and African subregional\r\norganizations in their efforts to address regional\r\nconflicts in recent years. Japan commends, in\r\nparticular, the role the African Union played in\r\nBurundi, and more recently in Darfur, in the Sudan.\r\nWe believe that the assistance of the international\r\ncommunity and the United Nations will be more\r\neffective if it is conducted on the basis of the\r\nownership by the region. Japan, for its part, will\r\ncontinue to support African Union activities\r\ncontributing to peace, for example, activities relating to\r\ndisarmament, demobilization, reintegration and\r\nresettlement in the Great Lakes region.\r\nAs the African Union Peace and Security Council\r\nhas embarked on its activities and as needs for peace\r\nsupport operations have grown in Africa over the past\r\nseveral years, cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand African regional and subregional organizations has\r\nbecome more critical than ever.\r\nWe are pleased that, in accordance with Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1556 (2004), the United Nations\r\nSecretariat assisted the African Union with planning\r\nand assessments for the expansion of its monitoring\r\nmission in Darfur and demonstrated how the United\r\nNations and a regional organization may cooperate\r\nwith each other effectively. Japan expects that, through\r\ncooperation with the United Nations, the African\r\nUnion monitoring mission will be expanded\r\nexpeditiously to improve the security conditions on the\r\nground.\r\nMy second point concerns the Asian-African\r\nLegal Consultative Organization (AALCO). My\r\ndelegation would like to commend the President of the\r\norganization’s forty-third session and the Government\r\nof the Republic of Indonesia for successfully hosting\r\nthe very productive annual meeting of AALCO in Bali\r\nlast June.\r\nAALCO is a truly unique regional organization. It\r\npromotes legal cooperation among countries in the\r\nregion; develops and disseminates expertise in\r\ninternational law by organizing annual meetings,\r\nseminars and workshops focusing on current issues in\r\ninternational law under consideration in various forums\r\nof the United Nations and other bodies; and contributes\r\nto the process of the codification and development of\r\ninternational law. Japan, as one of the original\r\nmembers of the organization, continues to support\r\nthose activities and is confident that the work of\r\ncodifying international law will be greatly advanced\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\nthrough closer cooperation between AALCO and the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nFinally, let me say a few words about the draft\r\nresolution contained in the document A/59/L.5, entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union”, which was just introduced\r\nby the representative of Chile.\r\nThe Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), consisting\r\nof the parliaments of the majority of the Member\r\nStates, is the focal point for worldwide parliamentary\r\ndialogue. Through its wide-ranging activities, the IPU\r\nhas contributed significantly to promoting democracy\r\nand enhancing awareness in the general public of the\r\nrole of the United Nations.\r\nAs a sponsor of the draft resolution, Japan hopes\r\nthat the IPU will continue to play its important and unique\r\nrole. Since relations between the United Nations and the\r\nIPU are at a critical juncture, my delegation also\r\nconsiders it appropriate, as is stipulated in the draft\r\nresolution, that the IPU engage in extensive consultations\r\nwith parliamentarians in different countries on the\r\nrecommendations made by the Panel of Eminent\r\nPersons on United Nations-Civil Society Relations.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nthe representative of the Netherlands, who will also\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/59/L.8.\r\nMr. Hamburger (Netherlands): Under the\r\nagenda item entitled “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional and other organizations”, the\r\nNetherlands would like to present draft resolution\r\nA/59/L.8, entitled “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization for the Prohibition of\r\nChemical Weapons”, on behalf of the sponsors.\r\nSince the publication of the draft resolution, the\r\nfollowing countries have become sponsors: the United\r\nKingdom, Costa Rica, Serbia and Montenegro, Cuba,\r\nPoland, Bolivia, Romania, Bangladesh, Turkey, Greece\r\nand Germany.\r\nWe believe that the Organization for the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is an\r\nimportant organization that contributes to international\r\npeace and security. The OPCW was established in 1997\r\nby the States Parties to the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention (CWC). The organization’s mission is to\r\nfully and effectively implement the Convention in\r\norder to achieve the total elimination and prohibition of\r\nchemical weapons. By the end of this month, the\r\nOPCW will have 166 States parties.\r\nThe organization works actively to promote\r\naccession to the Convention by those countries that\r\nhave not yet done so. The OPCW verifies the actual\r\ndestruction of existing chemical weapons stockpiles\r\nand chemical weapons production facilities.\r\nFurthermore, OPCW carries out worldwide inspections\r\nin the chemical industries to verify compliance with\r\nthe Convention and promotes international cooperation\r\nfor the peaceful uses of chemistry.\r\nI refer further to the substantive statement made\r\non this issue earlier this morning by Rogelio Pfirter,\r\nDirector-General of the Technical Secretariat of OPCW.\r\nThe OPCW is an independent international\r\norganization that cooperates with the United Nations.\r\nWe would like to reiterate our support for that\r\ncooperation by introducing this draft resolution and we\r\nwould like to express our gratitude to all Member\r\nStates for their kind consideration of the draft\r\nresolution.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nthe representative of Samoa, who will introduce draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.11.\r\nMr. Elisaia (Samoa): As current chair of the\r\nPacific Islands Forum Group countries with missions\r\nto the United Nations, namely: Australia, Fiji,\r\nFederated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands,\r\nNauru, New Zealand, Palau, Papua New Guinea,\r\nSolomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and my own\r\ncountry, Samoa, I have the honour to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.11, entitled “Cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Pacific Islands Forum”,\r\nunder agenda item 56 on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional and other organizations.\r\nOn behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum members,\r\nI would like to acknowledge and express our sincere\r\nappreciation to all those countries that have joined the\r\ngroup in co-sponsoring the draft resolution, namely:\r\nAlgeria, Azerbaijan, Barbados, Belize, Cape Verde,\r\nComoros, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Grenada, Israel,\r\nMauritius, Peru, Philippines, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent\r\nand the Grenadines, Seychelles, Singapore, South\r\nAfrica, the Sudan, Swaziland, Timor-Leste and the\r\nUnited States of America.\r\nIn addition I would like to announce that since\r\nthe publication of draft resolution A/59/L.11, the\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\nfollowing countries have kindly joined the sponsors,\r\nnamely: Iceland, Republic of Korea, Malaysia and\r\nLithuania.\r\nWe would like, therefore, to invite other Member\r\nStates to join those countries in co-sponsoring our\r\ngroup’s draft resolution, which, as we have just been\r\nadvised, is already with the United Nations Secretariat\r\nand will be circulated later this afternoon.\r\nBy this draft resolution, the Pacific Islands Forum\r\nand its associated institutions reaffirm their\r\ncommitment to a partnership of cooperation and\r\nfriendship with the United Nations and its development\r\npartners. We welcome ongoing efforts in the\r\nmaintenance and strengthening of that partnership in\r\norder to foster closer cooperation between the Forum\r\nand the United Nations agencies, funds and\r\nprogrammes. This would include advancing knowledge\r\nin key strategic areas related to governance, security,\r\neconomic growth, trade, sustainable development and\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals\r\n(MDGs) in the Pacific Island countries.\r\nAt their meeting last April in Auckland, New\r\nZealand, our Forum leaders adopted a vision\r\nexpressing their desire to foster peace, harmony,\r\nsecurity and economic prosperity in the region. To give\r\neffect to that vision, our leaders endorsed the\r\ndevelopment of a Pacific plan that would create\r\nstronger and deeper links between Pacific countries\r\nand identify the sectors where the region could gain the\r\nmost from sharing resources and aligning policies.\r\nThat plan is currently being put together and we\r\nwill focus on four key issues, namely, economic\r\ngrowth, sustainable development, good governance and\r\nsecurity. We hope that once fully developed, the plan\r\nwill not only make our existing Forum organizations\r\nwork together more efficiently, but also provide the\r\noverarching framework within which our region will\r\nconduct its business with the international community,\r\nincluding the United Nations system.\r\nAt this year’s Pacific Islands Forum Summit in\r\nSamoa, our leaders again noted the dangers to the\r\nworld and the Pacific region of terrorism, including\r\ntransnational crime. As a response, the Pacific Islands\r\nForum has strengthened regional cooperation and has\r\nemphasized national efforts to promote law\r\nenforcement cooperation, rule of law and regional\r\npeace and security, including the fight against all types\r\nof terrorism, and to implement the core United Nations\r\ntreaties to combat terrorism, money laundering,\r\ntransnational crimes and the financing of terrorism.\r\nThe Pacific Islands Forum is also committed to\r\ncollective mechanisms to assist its Member States to\r\nrecover from national conflicts and crises. The success\r\nof those arrangements, with the support of the United\r\nNations, is already evident in the positive results of the\r\nregional assistance mission in the Solomon Islands and\r\nthe progress made in Bougainville in Papua New Guinea.\r\nWe also welcome the readiness of the United\r\nNations, in cooperation with the Forum, to field an\r\ninter-agency mission to Nauru in response to that\r\ncountry’s expressed wish.\r\nWe encourage further cooperation on the issue of\r\ncapacity-building through regional training\r\nprogrammes and workshops in order to foster\r\nawareness and knowledge of human rights treaties,\r\npreventive diplomacy, and post-conflict resolution. The\r\ncontinuation of regular consultations between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Pacific Islands Forum\r\nsecretariat, including participation at meetings of the\r\nPacific Islands Forum, is equally encouraged.\r\nWe urge the United Nations system to continue to\r\nwork closely with the Pacific Islands Forum to enhance\r\nthe coordination of United Nations-related activities\r\nwithin our region. That will become increasingly\r\nimportant, as we approach the ten-year review of the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, as\r\nwell as the five-year review of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nThe Pacific Islands Forum will continue to\r\nsupport the efforts of Secretary-General Kofi Annan to\r\nbring the different regional organizations into the\r\nfamily of the United Nations and to strengthen our\r\nmutual political will to achieve our common good.\r\nIn closing, the Pacific Islands Forum members\r\nwould like to assure the United Nations of their\r\ncommitment and express the hope that, through this\r\npartnership of cooperation and friendship, we can\r\ncontinue to work cooperatively together to advance our\r\nefforts to achieve the effective maintenance of peace\r\nand security and sustainable development for our\r\npeoples and communities.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nthe representative of Turkey, who will introduce draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.12.\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\nMr. Cengizer (Turkey): As this is the first time I\r\nam taking the floor at the fifty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Sir, I would like to join preceding\r\nspeakers before me in congratulating you on your\r\nelection to the presidency at the current session. I also\r\nwould like to seize this opportunity to assure you and\r\nthe other members of the Bureau of our full support\r\nand cooperation to ensure the successful completion of\r\nthe work of the fifty-ninth session.\r\nIn my capacity as the current Chair of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) group, I\r\nwould like to submit to the General Assembly the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/59/L.12, which is\r\nsponsored by Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Egypt, the Islamic Republic of Iran,\r\nKyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Morocco, Oman, Saudi Arabia,\r\nSomalia, the Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic and\r\nTogo. The draft resolution has been introduced under\r\nagenda item 56 (p): “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional and other organizations:\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference”.\r\nWe welcome the report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/59/303), which highlights the important exchanges\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OIC, on political,\r\neconomic, social and humanitarian issues, during the\r\nperiod under review. As emphasized in the report, the\r\nparticular focus has been on the current situation in the\r\nMiddle East, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Sudan, as well\r\nas on consultations on conflict prevention and the fight\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nGiven the current developments around the globe,\r\nthose issues undoubtedly underscore the vitality of the\r\ncooperation between the two organizations. We are,\r\nindeed, pleased, that ways are available to strengthen\r\nthe mechanisms for ongoing dialogue and consultation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OIC, and that the\r\ngeneral meeting, held in July, facilitated the\r\ndevelopment of new ideas and projects to deepen the\r\nclose cooperation that already exists.\r\nI would also like to introduce a revision of the\r\nninth preambular paragraph, regarding the general\r\nmeeting between the United Nations and the OIC, held\r\nin Vienna. The following text should be added at the\r\nend of that paragraph:\r\n“and the fact that these meetings are now being\r\nheld every two years, with the next one scheduled\r\nfor the year 2006,”.\r\nThe draft resolution, which I have the distinct\r\npleasure and honour to submit to the Assembly, is a\r\ntestament to the continually developing relations,\r\ncooperation, mutual support and collaboration between\r\nthe United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference. I hope that through adoption of the draft\r\nresolution, the two organizations will further their\r\ncooperation on regional and global matters for the\r\nbenefit of the world community.\r\nHaving introduced the draft resolution entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference”, I would also\r\nlike to take this opportunity to make a statement in my\r\ncapacity as the current Chair of the OIC group.\r\nWe warmly welcome the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral pertaining to agenda item 56. We note with\r\nparticular satisfaction the comprehensive account of\r\nthe cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference at a crucial\r\ntime when the social, religious, cultural and historical\r\ntraditions of the peoples of the world should serve as\r\nsources of inspiration to bridge existing differences.\r\nIt is our firm belief that the sense of cooperation\r\nand collaboration among peoples could be furthered\r\nthrough close dialogue and common toil among\r\ninternational organizations. The multidimensional\r\nnature of current problems and the changed nature of\r\nthe threats faced by humanity as a whole call for such\r\nenhanced institutional interaction.\r\nIn a world where local and regional threats can no\r\nlonger be contained with traditional security measures,\r\nthe international community must utilize every\r\navailable resource. With that understanding, we\r\nstrongly support the enhanced role of regional and\r\ninternational bodies in the attainment of the shared\r\ngoals of peace, security, stability and prosperity around\r\nthe globe. The broad geographical representation of the\r\nOIC is indicative of the wealth of wisdom and\r\nexperience it embodies, which fosters such efforts.\r\nWe appreciate the fact that the Secretary-General\r\nhighlighted in his report such aspects of the ongoing\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OIC.\r\nThe level of cooperation between the two bodies is\r\nduly reported. As the current Chairman of the Islamic\r\nConference of Foreign Ministers, Turkey stands ready\r\nto deepen the existing levels of cooperation between\r\nthe two organizations on regional and global matters of\r\nconcern.\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\nI would now like, in my national capacity, to\r\nmake a brief statement on the Black Sea Economic\r\nCooperation Organization (BSEC). The BSEC was\r\nestablished in 1992 as an intergovernmental\r\nmechanism, with the purpose of establishing a network\r\nof cooperation in the economic field among its 11\r\nfounding member States.\r\nAs the host country of the BSEC headquarters,\r\nTurkey welcomes the new BSEC member, Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, which recently became the twelfth\r\nmember of the organization on 16 April 2004. The\r\nBlack Sea Economic Cooperation Organization was\r\ncreated when cooperation was the element most needed\r\nfor stability and security in the region. It developed\r\ninto a full-fledged international organization with the\r\nentry into force of its Charter in 1999. Since its\r\ninception, BSEC has also been instrumental in its own\r\nway, in helping efforts to create greater political\r\nstability while not losing sight of its primary objectives\r\nin the economic field.\r\nIndeed, the preamble of the charter of the Black\r\nSea Economic Cooperation Organization, reaffirms the\r\ncommon will of its member States to adhere to the\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter, and to share\r\ntheir vision of regional cooperation, as part of the\r\nprocess of integration in Europe and based on human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, prosperity through\r\neconomic liberty, social justice and equal security and\r\nstability. That process is open for interaction with other\r\ncountries, regional initiatives and international\r\norganizations and financial institutions.\r\nEven though it covers a complicated geographic\r\nand geostrategic area, the Black Sea Economic\r\nCooperation Organization, with its well-established\r\nlegal, institutional and procedural framework, sets the\r\npace for cooperation among its members.\r\nFollowing the mandate given to the organization\r\nby the BSEC summit in 2002, it has expanded its\r\nactivities beyond the traditional areas of regional\r\neconomic cooperation. With its new mechanisms and\r\ninstruments, such as the Black Sea Trade and\r\nDevelopment Bank and the Project Development Fund,\r\nthe organization has been supporting significant\r\nprogress in such areas of cooperation as trade, banking\r\nand finance, transport, energy and electricity networks,\r\nscience, statistical data, combating organized crime\r\nand simplification of cross-border and customs\r\nprocedures.\r\nWe welcome the part of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General that deals with cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Black Sea Economic\r\nCooperation Organization and that explains the status\r\nof that cooperation. We also support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendation set out in the report, that\r\nthe United Nations, the specialized agencies and other\r\norganizations and programmes of the United Nations\r\nsystem should continue to hold consultations with\r\nBSEC and formulate and implement joint programmes\r\npertaining to fields of common interest.\r\nIt is becoming increasingly apparent that\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals will also\r\nrequire enhanced cooperation and results-oriented\r\ncollaboration between international and regional\r\norganizations. Turkey has therefore encouraged deepened\r\nrelations between the Black Sea Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization and the United Nations system, as well as\r\nwith other relevant international and regional\r\norganizations. We firmly believe that further cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations will undoubtedly help the\r\nBlack Sea Economic Cooperation Organization to\r\nreach its goals.\r\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nwould like at the outset to join others to express my\r\ndelegation’s thanks and gratitude to Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan for his valuable and comprehensive report,\r\ncontained in document A/59/303, on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and other\r\norganizations, in which he spoke very clearly and\r\nmethodically about the areas of cooperation that exist\r\nbetween international organizations.\r\nMy delegation, which is chairing the Group of\r\nArab States during the month of October, would like to\r\ninform the General Assembly that the League of Arab\r\nStates has forwarded to the Secretariat a draft\r\nresolution entitled “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the League of Arab States”, which will\r\nsoon be circulated to all delegations. The draft\r\nresolution expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for actions he has taken to follow up the\r\nimplementation of the proposals made in meetings\r\nbetween bodies of the United Nations system and the\r\nGeneral Secretariat of the League of Arab States and\r\nits specialized agencies. The draft resolution calls on\r\nthe secretariats of the two organizations to work in\r\naccordance with their respective competencies to\r\nincrease the pace of their cooperation with one another\r\nin order to achieve the purposes and principles of the\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\nCharter of the United Nations and to enhance their\r\nability to benefit their common interests and goals in\r\nthe political, economic, social, humanitarian, cultural\r\nand administrative fields.\r\nThe draft resolution also calls for increased\r\ncooperation between the specialized agencies of the\r\nUnited Nations and the League of Arab States in such\r\npriority sectors as energy, desertification, technology\r\nand water resources. It also underscores the need to\r\nhold general meetings between the United Nations and\r\nthe League of Arab States every two years, as well as\r\njoint sectoral meetings once every two years between\r\ntheir respective agencies in order to study and consider\r\npriority areas for development in the Arab States.\r\nWe express the hope that the draft resolution will\r\nbe adopted by consensus, as in the past.\r\nAllow me now to speak on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of Tunisia.\r\nMy delegation would like to take this opportunity\r\nto emphasize the great importance it attaches to\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAfrican Union. We also renew our call for enhanced\r\ncoordination between the two organizations and for the\r\nstrengthening of consultative mechanisms. In that\r\nconnection, we express our appreciation for the\r\ncontinuing work being carried out by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Special Adviser on Africa and the members\r\nof his Office with the African Union in order to\r\nimplement numerous initiatives to make it possible for\r\nAfrican countries to respond effectively to conflict-\r\nresolution efforts and to promote development\r\nprogrammes on the continent. There is no doubt that\r\nthe successful initiatives of the United Nations in\r\nconnection with establishing and developing the new\r\nAfrican Union’s structures, such as the Peace and\r\nSecurity Council, merit our gratitude and appreciation.\r\nMy delegation would also like to express its\r\nsatisfaction with the ongoing consultations between the\r\nstaffs of the United Nations and the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference with regard to political, social,\r\neconomic and humanitarian issues. Those consultations\r\nfocus in particular on the situation in the Middle East,\r\nIraq, Afghanistan and the Sudan, as well as on the\r\nprevention of conflict and combating terrorism. Given the\r\nimportance of the subjects of those consultations and the\r\ndirect effect they have on international peace and\r\nsecurity, we call for the expansion and diversification\r\nof such cooperation to include many other fields.\r\nTunisia, which has the honour to host the regular\r\nsession of the Arab summit, would like to welcome the\r\nprogress made in the cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the League of Arab States. That close and\r\nmultilateral cooperation will enhance the abilities of\r\nthe two organizations to face the challenges of peace,\r\nsecurity, development and social progress.\r\nRepresentatives of 26 departments, funds, agencies and\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations participated with\r\nthe representatives of 19 institutions of the League of\r\nArab States in the eighth general meeting between the\r\nLeague of Arab States and the United Nations. That\r\ngeneral meeting gave impetus to the cooperation that is\r\ntaking place on joint projects. It also served to\r\nunderscore the importance of cooperation between the\r\ntwo organizations in the area of conflict prevention and\r\nother fields of common interest.\r\nMy delegation would also like to express its\r\nappreciation for the advanced forms of cooperation that\r\nexist between the United Nations and the International\r\nOrganization of la Francophonie. We welcome the fact\r\nthat the tenth Summit of la Francophonie, which will\r\ntake place on 20 November in Ouagadougou, will\r\nfocus on solidarity for sustainable development. We\r\nhope that the Summit will lead to the fruitful result of\r\nsupporting development efforts in the countries that,\r\nsolely or partially, speak the French language,\r\nespecially in the developing countries of Africa.\r\nMr. Ferreira (Sao Tome and Principe): I have the\r\nhonour to speak on behalf of Angola, Cape Verde,\r\nBrazil, Timor-Leste, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique,\r\nPortugal and Sao Tome and Principe, members of the\r\nCommunity of Portuguese Speaking Countries (CPLP).\r\nCPLP was founded on 17 July 1996 and became a\r\nUnited Nations observer in 1999. Since then, the\r\nCommunity has been consolidating its presence,\r\ninfluence and recognition at international level.\r\nThe Community of Portuguese-Speaking\r\nCountries brings together 240 million people in eight\r\ncountries and four continents. Its member States, which\r\nare spread to the four corners of the world, also belong\r\nto regional organizations such as the European Union,\r\nthe African Union, MERCOSUR, the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, the Southern Africa Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) and others, where they play an\r\nactive role. Despite that fact, they decided to form\r\nanother organization, the CPLP, based on a common\r\nlanguage and cultural heritage.\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\nIn general, the main goals pursued by the CPLP\r\ninclude the establishment of close political dialogue\r\nand cooperation among its member States, the defence\r\nand promotion of the Portuguese language abroad and\r\nthe methods of its teaching in CPLP member countries,\r\nand active cooperation in the various fields connected\r\nwith development and public administration.\r\nUnder its wide umbrella, over 50 specific groups\r\nin the eight member countries are carrying out intense\r\nactivities with organizations as diverse the CPLP’s\r\nParliamentary Forum, Business Forum and the\r\nchambers of agriculture of the eight member States.\r\nOther CPLP activities include press and media\r\nworkers’ groups, the China-Africa Corporation Forum,\r\nthe National Archives Forum, a CPLP women’s\r\nconference, and an organization of criminal police\r\ndirectors, as well as many other CPLP organizations on\r\na list that is growing every day.\r\nThe fourth Summit of heads of State of the CPLP,\r\nwhich took place in my country last July, approved a\r\nwide range of decisions and programmes, including an\r\nawareness-raising campaign on HIV/AIDS that\r\ninvolves well-known sport figures, a programme to\r\ncombat malaria and a resolution on the establishment\r\nof centres to improve public administration. In\r\naddition, various provisions to facilitate the circulation\r\nof CPLP citizens among Community member States\r\nwere approved, as was the endorsement of a project by\r\nthe President of Brazil concerning the fight against\r\nhunger and poverty.\r\nIn the course of the year preceding the Summit,\r\nthe CPLP played a role in the elections that took place\r\nin Mozambique in November 2003 and in Guinea-\r\nBissau in early 2004. It also undertook the signing of\r\ncooperation agreements with various organizations and\r\nagencies of the United Nations, namely UNESCO, the\r\nWorld Food Programme, the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development and the\r\nOrganization of Ibero-American States for Education,\r\nScience and Culture.\r\nEast Timor, the latest country to join the CPLP,\r\nhas received particular attention from the other\r\nmember States as a natural consequence of the urgent\r\nneeds resulting from the difficult conditions associated\r\nwith its independence.\r\nGuinea-Bissau also deserves particular attention\r\nat this moment, given the political instability that the\r\ncountry has suffered in recent years. In the last three\r\nweeks, the CPLP has sent several missions to Bissau,\r\nnot only to help with the national dialogue and\r\nreconciliation but also to determine the precise urgent\r\nneeds to be met in helping to put the country on the\r\npath to stability. The CPLP is certain that the United\r\nNations and the regional organizations to which\r\nGuinea-Bissau belongs will cooperate closely to rescue\r\nthat country from a cycle of poverty and instability that\r\nneeds to be broken.\r\nIn cooperation with the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States and the Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General for Guinea-Bissau, Mr. João\r\nHonwana, we are helping to rebuild confidence among\r\nall political players and the army. That action\r\ndemonstrates that the CPLP has been staunchly\r\napplying the rules of multilateralism and cooperating\r\nwith the United Nations.\r\nDocument A/59/231 is based on provisions of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations that encourage activities\r\nthrough regional cooperation for the promotion of the\r\npurposes and principles of the Organization. A draft\r\nresolution we have submitted requests the\r\ncommencement of formal cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General and the CPLP\r\nExecutive Secretary. We wish to formalize our role and\r\nwiden cooperation with the United Nations by\r\ncontributing to development and international security.\r\nI would therefore like to conclude by kindly requesting\r\nthe Assembly to adopt by consensus that draft\r\nresolution, entitled “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Community of Portuguese-Speaking\r\ncountries”. I request Member States to join the list of\r\nsponsors of the draft resolution, which will be\r\ncirculated in a few days.\r\nMr. Denisov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): I have the honour to speak on behalf of a\r\ngroup of States members of the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States (CIS): the Republic of Armenia, the\r\nRepublic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the\r\nKyrgyz Republic, the Russian Federation, the Republic\r\nof Tajikistan, the Republic of Uzbekistan, and Ukraine.\r\nOn 15 September 2004, in Astana, Kazakhstan, those\r\ncountries signed an appeal to the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) partners.\r\nWe attach particular importance to the further\r\nenhancement and improvement of the cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and international and\r\nregional organizations, including the CIS. Such\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\ninteraction should be built up in strict conformity with\r\nChapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations and\r\non the basis of the universal nature of the Organization,\r\nwhile duly taking into account the comparative\r\nadvantages of regional and other organizations. The\r\nscope of that cooperation is very broad, ranging from\r\nthe prevention and settlement of conflicts to providing\r\nassistance for social and economic development,\r\ncombating HIV/AIDS, eradicating poverty and disease\r\nand countering organized crime and illicit drug\r\ntrafficking.\r\nSuch cooperation is becoming particularly\r\nimportant in the light of the task of combating\r\ninternational terrorism, which has recently become\r\nincreasingly acute and requires increased collective\r\nefforts on the part of all members of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe believe that the current practice of holding\r\nregular meetings between high-level officials of the\r\nSecretariat and leading regional organizations is\r\nextremely useful, and we would support its\r\ncontinuation.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOSCE, of which our countries are active members,\r\nplays an important role in the context of the subject\r\nnow under discussion. We note with satisfaction that,\r\nas a regional mechanism under Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter, the OSCE has established close and fruitful\r\ninteraction with the United Nations in a whole range of\r\nkey areas, first and foremost those related to security\r\nand the settlement of regional conflicts.\r\nGuided by a desire for constructive cooperation\r\nwithin the OSCE and for the strengthening of its role in\r\nthe present-day European security architecture, and in\r\nfurtherance of the Moscow statement by the Presidents\r\nof the States members of the CIS of 3 July 2004\r\nregarding the state of affairs in the OSCE, the member\r\nStates of the CIS, meeting on 15 September 2004 in\r\nAstana, Kazakhstan, adopted an appeal addressed to\r\ntheir OSCE partners. The main idea of the document is\r\nthat today’s circumstances require additional steps to\r\nenhance the effectiveness of that pan-European\r\norganization.\r\nFirst, we propose to reinforce OSCE activities to\r\ncombat international terrorism and eradicate its root\r\ncauses. In that connection, a necessary step is the\r\nimprovement of OSCE mechanisms, in particular by\r\naugmenting the budget and staff of its antiterrorism\r\nunit. We support the implementation in full, throughout\r\nthe organization’s region, of the provisions of the\r\nOSCE Strategy to Address Threats to Security and\r\nStability in the Twenty-First Century, adopted by the\r\nOSCE Ministerial Council at Maastricht in 2003. We\r\nalso believe it is important to continue the constructive\r\nparticipation of the OSCE in the resolution of regional\r\nconflicts throughout its area within the framework of\r\nits existing negotiating processes and mechanisms. CIS\r\nmember States, which signed the appeal to OSCE\r\npartners on 15 September 2004, are ready to make a\r\npractical contribution to implementing the decisions\r\nadopted by the OSCE in that important part of its\r\nactivities.\r\nThe unique capacity of the OSCE in the military-\r\npolitical field must be improved and fully exploited. To\r\ndo so, it is important to speed up the entry into force of\r\nthe 1999 Agreement on Adaptation of the Treaty on\r\nConventional Armed Forces in Europe, which is the\r\ncornerstone of the European security system. It is also\r\nnecessary to carry on work on the adaptation of the\r\nVienna Document 1999 of the Negotiations on\r\nConfidence- and Security-Building Measures. A topic\r\nfor serious discussions could be the issue concerning\r\nmilitary doctrines of participating States. We stand for\r\nenhancing the role of the Forum for Security\r\nCooperation and for preserving its autonomous status\r\nand its right to take independent decisions.\r\nIt is important to give full expression to an\r\neconomic and environmental dimension of the OSCE.\r\nThe mechanisms established and the documents\r\nadopted in those areas do not fully ensure the proper\r\nimplementation of existing agreements. There is also a\r\nneed to promote more balanced OSCE activities in the\r\nhumanitarian sphere.\r\nWe believe it necessary to move away from the\r\npractice of limiting OSCE field activities to monitoring\r\npolitical situations, giving priority attention instead to\r\nspecific project activities in its reform process. Such\r\nactivities should be carried out transparently through\r\nthe mechanisms of the secretariat and the specialized\r\ninstitutions of the OSCE, taking into account the needs\r\nand requirements of the receiving States.\r\nFor the OSCE to be fully able to implement the\r\ntask initially set for it — to be a forum for broad and\r\nequal dialogue on the most significant issues — it is\r\nnecessary to overcome artificially created functional\r\nand territorial imbalances in the work of the\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\norganization. The Platform for Cooperative Security,\r\nadopted by the OSCE Istanbul Summit in 1999, is a\r\ngood basis for further promotion of its partner\r\ncooperation with the United Nations and other\r\ninternational and regional organizations. It is important\r\nto make full use of the potential of that cooperation in\r\nthe interests of the entire international community.\r\nMr. Kryzhanivsky (Ukraine): I have the honour\r\nto speak on behalf of the delegations of Georgia, Ukraine,\r\nUzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Moldova (GUUAM).\r\nAt the outset I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations (A/59/303).\r\nThe basis for such cooperation was envisaged in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, but it was only in the early\r\n1990s that the international community started to pay\r\nparticular attention to this issue. Since then, regional\r\norganizations have been increasingly recognized as an\r\nimportant instrument in international efforts aimed at\r\nachieving United Nations goals, especially in the area\r\nof peace and security. Indeed, during the past decade\r\nwe have witnessed many encouraging examples of that\r\nkind of cooperation, for example, the efforts of NATO,\r\nthe European Union and the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in the Balkans, or\r\nthe contribution of African Union and the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States to the settlement of\r\nconflicts in Africa.\r\nGiven the scope and complexity of the challenges\r\nfacing the international community, GUUAM firmly\r\nbelieves that enhanced cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations or arrangements is\r\nabsolutely indispensable in dealing with many of them.\r\nThe important role that can be played by regional\r\norganizations, primarily in the prevention, resolution\r\nand management of conflicts, but also in other areas, is\r\nwidely acknowledged.\r\nGUUAM is encouraged by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s efforts towards the creation and promotion of\r\nstrategic partnerships and cooperative arrangements\r\nwith regional organizations. In that process due account\r\nshould be taken of the comparative advantages and\r\nstrengths of individual organizations in order to make\r\njoint action to address the current challenges more\r\neffective and complementary. Of equal importance is\r\nthe provision by the international community of\r\nassistance to strengthen the capacities of regional\r\norganizations in the respective areas of their activities.\r\nThe establishment of institutionalized cooperation\r\nframeworks and channels of communication is necessary\r\nfor the coordination and efficiency of joint actions. In\r\nthat regard, GUUAM attaches great importance to the\r\nhigh-level meetings of the Secretary-General with\r\nregional organizations. We are encouraged by the fact\r\nthat the Secretary-General has asked the respective\r\nUnited Nations departments to lead the implementation\r\nprocess on the recommendations of the fifth high-level\r\nmeeting, as well as to develop practical follow-up\r\nplans for discussion during the next meeting. Taking\r\ninto account the broad range of issues that have been\r\npreviously discussed in those forums, we believe it\r\nwould be appropriate that at the sixth meeting between\r\nthe Secretary-General and regional organizations, to be\r\nconvened in mid-2005, due attention be given to the\r\ncurrent exchange of views, as well as to the\r\nrecommendations of the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change. GUUAM looks forward to its\r\nparticipation in that meeting.\r\nThe granting to GUUAM of observer status in the\r\nGeneral Assembly last year was an important initial\r\nstep in the development of its mutually beneficial\r\ncooperation with the United Nations, with the aim of\r\nachieving shared goals and principles. GUUAM is\r\ninterested in such cooperation and is ready to consider\r\nits contribution to activities of concern and importance\r\nto the United Nations in various areas.\r\nSince its establishment seven years ago, in\r\naddition to issues of economic cooperation, GUUAM\r\nhas been expanding its activities to many other spheres,\r\nincluding the security field.\r\nStrengthening regional security in all spheres of\r\nactivity and combating international terrorism,\r\norganized crime and drug trafficking are among the\r\nmain objectives of the GUUAM, as defined in its\r\ncharter. A number of concrete projects in those areas\r\nare now under development.\r\nThe GUUAM welcomes the Security Council\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee’s (CTC) endeavours to\r\nfacilitate dialogue and the exchange of information\r\nbetween regional organizations and is actively\r\nparticipating in CTC meetings with representatives of\r\nsuch organizations. Let me reiterate that the GUUAM,\r\nwhich strongly believes that the United Nations\r\nconstitutes the best possible framework for our\r\ncollective efforts in fighting terrorism, stands ready to\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\nfurther facilitate its cooperation with the Organization\r\nin this field.\r\nWith respect to today’s debate, the GUUAM\r\nattaches particular importance to the issue of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and European\r\nregional organizations and arrangements. We support\r\nthe further strengthening of interaction between the\r\nUnited Nations, the European Union, NATO, OSCE\r\nand the Council of Europe in the maintenance of peace,\r\nsecurity and stability on the European continent, the\r\npromotion of respect for the rule of law and human\r\nrights, and the facilitation of cooperation in the\r\neconomic and environmental areas.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to express the concern\r\nof the GUUAM over the continued lack of progress in\r\nthe settlement of protracted conflicts in post-Soviet\r\nterritory, namely in Abkhazia and South Ossetia,\r\nGeorgia; Nagorny Karabakh, Republic of Azerbaijan;\r\nand the conflict in the Republic of Moldova. They are\r\ncausing suffering to millions of people and threaten to\r\ndestabilize the situation in the entire OSCE region.\r\nThe GUUAM calls on all relevant international\r\norganizations, including the United Nations and the\r\nOSCE, to take decisive steps aimed at the final\r\nsettlement of those conflicts, with full respect for the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of\r\nAzerbaijan, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova. We\r\nstrongly believe that efforts to that end, including the\r\nfull implementation of the relevant decisions of the\r\nOSCE summits and ministerial meetings, should be\r\namong the major priorities for the OSCE.\r\nMr. Tanko (Nigeria): Nigeria is delighted to\r\nparticipate in this debate. It is gratifying to note that\r\nthe African Union, as the successor organization to the\r\nerstwhile Organization of African Unity (OAU), enjoys\r\na healthy relationship and cooperation with the United\r\nNations. We are confident that this and other efforts of\r\nthe United Nations will lead to improved cooperation\r\nand coordination between our two organizations,\r\nparticularly in the management of conflict, poverty\r\neradication, disease control and sustainable development.\r\nThe problem of persistent conflicts in various\r\nlocations in Africa and the increasing difficulty of\r\nfinding solutions to them continue to pose serious\r\nchallenges to the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity. While we acknowledge and appreciate the\r\nefforts made and the successes achieved to date, it is\r\nour belief that a great deal still has to be done.\r\nIn that regard, Nigeria and, indeed, the African\r\nUnion commend the United Nations for its consistent\r\nengagement in crisis management and peacekeeping in\r\nAfrica. We note the fundamental change that has taken\r\nplace in the perception and concept of peacekeeping\r\noperations, which now encompass issues such as the\r\nestablishment of requisite institutions to ensure the rule\r\nof law, the enforcement of human rights, the\r\nreintegration of troops and internally displaced\r\npersons, as well as the rehabilitation of infrastructure\r\nin countries emerging from conflicts. Accordingly, we\r\ncall on the United Nations to increase its present level\r\nof collaboration and assistance to regional and\r\nsubregional bodies in those areas. That would enhance\r\nthe capacity of those bodies in their efforts to maintain\r\npeace and security on the continent.\r\nWe welcome the establishment of the Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group on Conflict Prevention and Resolution\r\nin Africa. This is indeed a reflection of the\r\ndetermination of the United Nations to strengthen its\r\ncooperation with the African Union and other regional\r\norganizations in the quest to maintain peace and\r\nsecurity in Africa. In that regard, the appointment of\r\nspecial envoys by the African Union in areas where the\r\nUnited Nations is operating is another important step in\r\nthe cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAU. We believe that the use of regional strategies\r\ninvolving regional actors in the resolution of conflicts\r\nin Africa has been of great importance to the African\r\nUnion. That approach is consistent with Article 52 of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, which recognizes\r\nthe relevance and role of regional and subregional\r\norganizations in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nIn that connection, it is gratifying that the\r\nConstitutive Act of the African Union has —\r\nappropriately — upheld Article 33 of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, which enjoins Member States to adopt\r\nthe strategy of the pacific settlement of disputes\r\nthrough negotiation, mediation, conciliation or\r\narbitration, under the umbrella of regional agencies or\r\narrangements.\r\nConsequently, the African Union, through its\r\nPeace and Security Council, is now more focused and\r\nproactive in its approach to the maintenance of peace\r\nand security. That strategy has been greatly enhanced\r\nthrough the establishment of institutional cooperation\r\nfor conflict prevention, management and resolution.\r\nWe therefore reiterate our commitment to resolution\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\n57/48, adopted in 2002, which stresses the need for\r\ncloser cooperation and coordination between the\r\nAfrican Union and the United Nations. The resolution\r\nalso calls upon the United Nations system to continue\r\nto support the AU on an ongoing basis, in accordance\r\nwith the Cooperation Agreement between the two\r\norganizations.\r\nIt is also noteworthy that the resolution calls for\r\nassistance in the area of the training of troops and the\r\nstandardization of equipment for peacekeeping duties.\r\nWe believe that there is an urgent need to further\r\nenhance this process, in order to put an end to the\r\nrecurrent conflicts in Africa through additional joint\r\nefforts between the United Nations and the subregional\r\nand regional organizations in Africa. Such efforts and\r\ncooperation, in our view, will bring lasting, much-\r\nneeded peace and sustainable development to the\r\ncontinent. Accordingly, we call on the United Nations\r\nto cooperate further with subregional and regional\r\norganizations of the continent to address the root causes\r\nof conflicts and the factors that exacerbate them.\r\nIn that regard, we commend the assistance\r\nextended to the African Union by the United Nations in\r\nthe establishment of its Peace and Security Council,\r\nAfrican Standby Force and Military Staff Committee.\r\nWe also welcome the assistance and cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS),\r\nparticularly in the area of peacekeeping and peace-\r\nbuilding in Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire and Sierra Leone. It\r\nis gratifying to note that ECOWAS has been able to\r\naddress complex humanitarian issues in the subregion\r\nwith the active cooperation of the United Nations.\r\nNigeria endorses the memorandum of\r\nunderstanding and programme of work between\r\nECOWAS and the Office of the Special Representative\r\nof the Secretary-General for West Africa. We appreciate\r\nthe fact that the programme of work involves joint\r\nactivities in the areas of good governance, security-\r\nsector reform, electoral assistance, unemployment\r\namong young people and the control of the circulation\r\nof small arms and light weapons in the subregion.\r\nWe reiterate our commitment to the United\r\nNations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and\r\nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light\r\nWeapons in All Its Aspects, which was adopted in July\r\n2001. We call for increased United Nations assistance\r\nto the African Union and the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) to achieve the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action.\r\nWhile we welcome the progressive decrease in\r\nthe production and transfer of landmines in the\r\nsubregion, it is regrettable that landmines continue to\r\nimpede the development and security of peoples,\r\nespecially in African States emerging from conflicts. In\r\nthat connection, we call for the continued support of\r\nthe United Nations in demining the subregion.\r\nOur quest for global peace and security will\r\nprove unsuccessful unless we intensify our efforts to\r\neradicate poverty and disease and to control the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic. All those diseases and\r\nconstraints continue to pose grave inhibitions and\r\nchallenges to our developmental efforts. However, we\r\nappreciate the efforts of the United Nations and the\r\ncontribution of the international community in\r\ncombating those scourges in Africa.\r\nWe reiterate our commitment to the Framework for\r\nAction adopted at special Summit of the African Union\r\nheld in Abuja, as well as to the document adopted at this\r\nyear’s African Union Summit at Addis Ababa. It is\r\nworth noting that the Framework calls on African\r\ncountries to intensify their efforts and to mobilize\r\nresources for the prevention, care and treatment of\r\npeople infected by HIV/AIDS. There is consequently a\r\nneed for the United Nations system and the international\r\ncommunity to support Africa in its determination to\r\novercome those challenges. In our view, the need to\r\nfight those scourges is no longer an option but an\r\nimperative act of prudence and good conscience, if the\r\nlabour force in Africa is not to be wiped out.\r\nWhile we welcome the positive response of the\r\ninternational community to the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), it is, however,\r\nnecessary to stress that urgent measures must be taken\r\nto translate existing promises into action. Since the\r\nobjectives of NEPAD are intricately linked to the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, we believe that\r\nachieving both would constitute a rescue operation for\r\nthe African continent. Indeed, in our view, neither of\r\nthose objectives or goals can be achieved without the\r\nother. We therefore urge the United Nations system, the\r\nWorld Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the\r\ninternational community to increase their support for\r\nprojects identified under NEPAD.\r\nIn conclusion, we note with satisfaction that as\r\npart of its efforts towards enhancing cooperation\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations,\r\nthe United Nations Economic Commission for Africa is\r\nforging closer cooperation with the African Union,\r\nespecially in the implementation of NEPAD. We also\r\nnote with appreciation the Secretary-General’s decision\r\nto establish the Advisory Panel on International\r\nSupport for NEPAD. We expect that that cooperation\r\nwill result in the deployment of additional resources.\r\nWe believe that both Africa and the international\r\ncommunity stand to gain from such collaboration in\r\naddressing the challenges that confront the continent.\r\nMr. Sircar (Bangladesh): I would like to\r\ncongratulate you most warmly, Mr. President, on the\r\nmanner in which you are steering the work of this\r\nsession. I would also like in particular to commend the\r\nSecretary-General for his reports, which provide an in-\r\ndepth account of the growing cooperation in various\r\nfields between the United Nations and other\r\norganizations. The reports succinctly address the\r\ninstitutional efforts aimed at strengthening the\r\nrelationship between the United Nations and other\r\norganizations.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations provides a role\r\nfor regional and other organizations in the maintenance\r\nof peace and security in their respective regions. The\r\nUnited Nations has a mandate to intensify dialogue\r\nwith regional organizations. That includes exploring\r\nareas where those organizations constitute the ideal\r\ncomplement to the activities of the United Nations.\r\nEffective cooperation should be based on comparative\r\nadvantages, leading to complementarity of efforts.\r\nCooperation among international organizations is\r\ncrucial in an increasingly globalized world. The\r\nMillennium Declaration recognized the need for the\r\nUnited Nations to work more closely with\r\nparliamentarians in the areas of peace and security,\r\neconomic and social development, international law\r\nand human rights and democracy and gender issues.\r\nThe Deputy Secretary-General appropriately stated in\r\nher recent remarks at the 2004 parliamentary hearing\r\nthat parliamentarians could do much to help meet those\r\nglobal challenges. We have to explore how parliaments\r\ncould best assist in the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Better cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU) would have a constructive\r\neffect on the future of the United Nations. We have to\r\nwork hard and reinvigorate our commitments to find\r\nmodalities to enhance the parliamentary dimension of\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nThe state of world affairs has posed more\r\ncomplex and massive tasks for the United Nations.\r\nSome of those tasks are to eradicate poverty, ensure\r\npeace and security, protect the environment and combat\r\nterrorism. National parliaments could contribute a great\r\ndeal to bettering the lives of people around the world.\r\nThe role of regional organizations is important in the\r\nmanaging of issues at the regional and national levels.\r\nThey have a wealth of knowledge and experience from\r\nwhich the United Nations could greatly benefit by way\r\nof effective partnership and cooperation. The\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations should be guided towards strengthening\r\nthe capabilities of regional organizations.\r\nWe are encouraged to learn that the substantive\r\nrelationship between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union has been constantly expanding, in\r\nparticular since the IPU was granted observer status in\r\nthe General Assembly, in 2002. That cooperation now\r\ncovers a growing number of activities of mutual\r\ninterest to both organizations. The organizations pursue\r\nthe common goals of world peace, security and\r\ndevelopment: they are mutually reinforcing. The\r\nSecretary-General’s report has appropriately pointed\r\nout that IPU plays a significant role at the global level\r\nby organizing numerous events on the sidelines of\r\ninternational conferences and summits. In particular,\r\nthose events provide a legislative framework conducive\r\nto the implementation of the commitments that have\r\nbeen made.\r\nThe Commonwealth Parliamentary Association\r\n(CPA), another organization of parliaments, has 49\r\nmember States throughout the world. That organization\r\nis firmly committed to establishing global cooperation\r\naimed at achieving peace, prosperity and a variety of\r\nother goals around the world. I had the opportunity to\r\npreside over the forty-ninth Annual Plenary\r\nConference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary\r\nAssociation (CPA) in Dhaka in 2003. The Dhaka\r\nconference set the tone for partnerships with the\r\nobjective of attaining the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. I believe that the CPA has a wealth of\r\nknowledge and accumulated experience to share with\r\nthe United Nations. That opportunity, if pursued by the\r\nCPA in the future, would provide genuine and mutually\r\nreinforcing benefits.\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\nThe late President Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh\r\ninitiated the idea of forming the South Asian\r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), with\r\nthe overarching objective of forging broad-based\r\ncooperation among nations. That organization has\r\nachieved tremendous success in the field of socio-\r\neconomic development and cooperation on information\r\ncommunication technology. Next year, we will mark\r\nthe twentieth anniversary of the founding of SAARC.\r\nWe aspire to expand our collective agenda of peace,\r\nprogress and development in South Asia and to seek\r\nlinks with other subregional and regional groups. We\r\nstrongly believe that an institutional relationship\r\nbetween SAARC and the United Nations would\r\nstrongly support the realization of the objectives of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe practice of democracy is indispensable for\r\nmaintaining economic stability and social progress.\r\nBangladesh has come a long way in strengthening\r\ndemocracy and making it an integral part of our\r\nnational life. We have introduced the system of a\r\nneutral caretaker Government to oversee our\r\nparliamentary elections. The past three general\r\nelections in the country have been held under that\r\nsystem. Our democratically elected Parliament is the\r\nfocus of the decision-making process. Notably,\r\nBangladesh has been a unique example, in that for the\r\npast 13 years, both the Prime Minister and the leader of\r\nthe opposition have been women.\r\nThe United Nations must be the forum for\r\ncollective responses to the common problems of the\r\nEarth. The Organization can greatly benefit by drawing\r\nupon the experiences of a wide variety of regional and\r\ninternational organizations. We seek to foster the\r\nbuilding of a global parliament that is more efficient in\r\nits decision-making process, open to a larger number of\r\nvoices and more capable of taking effective decisions.\r\nThe report of the Panel of Eminent Persons on\r\nUnited Nations-Civil Society Relations (A/58/817 and\r\nCorr.1) provided some recommendations on engaging\r\nparliamentarians more systematically in the work of\r\nthe Organization. Those recommendations merit\r\nserious consideration. We also believe that the High-\r\nLevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change will\r\nproduce comprehensive proposals aimed at renewing\r\nthe United Nations and making it a more legitimate and\r\nmore effective instrument for mounting a collective\r\nresponse to the threats of our age.\r\nThe second World Conference of Speakers of\r\nParliaments will, in all probability, be held in\r\nSeptember 2005. It is our conviction that that event\r\nwill provide an occasion for building the will necessary\r\nto better define the political and operational\r\nresponsibilities of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in\r\nmatters relating to the promotion of peace and security,\r\ndemocracy, human rights and gender equality.\r\nIn conclusion, the United Nations is enduring a\r\nperiod of significant stress. Ironically, despite the efforts\r\nof the Organization and of others, war, conflict, poverty,\r\nhunger and malnutrition have remained global scourges\r\nthat have destroyed the lives and aspirations of millions\r\nof the world’s people. We firmly believe that all\r\nnations — big or small, weak or powerful — need the\r\nUnited Nations as much as the United Nations needs\r\nthem. It is only by combining our endeavours and by\r\nuniting our resolve that we will be able to attain our\r\nobjectives of peace, security, development and stability.\r\nThat is our commitment, and we must honour it.\r\nMr. Dube (Botswana): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the member States of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) — Angola, Botswana,\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho,\r\nMalawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South\r\nAfrica, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe —\r\nas well as the candidate country Madagascar. My\r\nstatement will focus on item 56 (s), that is on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nSouthern African Development Community.\r\nOn behalf of the SADC member States, I would\r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for his report\r\n(A/59/303) on cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional and other organizations.\r\nSince its establishment as the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Coordination Conference in 1980, SADC\r\nhas evolved as a dynamic organization capable of\r\nadapting its institutional framework, its focus on\r\nintervention and its strategic priorities to the\r\ncontinuously changing regional and international\r\npolitical, social and economic environment. SADC has\r\nmade good progress in restructuring itself to better\r\nserve the needs of its people by embarking on projects\r\nand programmes that seek to make a positive and\r\nindelible mark on the lives of millions of people in the\r\nregion.\r\nIn that context, I should point out that a regional\r\nindicative strategic development plan was adopted in\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\n2003 as a key policy framework for the\r\noperationalization of SADC’s common agenda and for\r\nthe attainment of deeper and broader levels of\r\neconomic integration and social development in the\r\nregion. The plan focuses on a wide range of issues,\r\nincluding peace, security, democracy, governance,\r\nHIV/AIDS, gender, economic integration and trade,\r\ninformation communication technology and science\r\nand technology, among others. A number of areas of\r\nintervention aimed at regional cooperation and\r\nintegration have been identified for implementation\r\nover the next 15 years. An overall goal, areas of focus,\r\nkey strategies and broad targets have been established\r\nfor each intervention area. Those targets are in line\r\nwith the Millennium Development Goals and with\r\ninternationally agreed development parameters.\r\nAt the SADC summit held in August 2004 in\r\nMauritius, the Indicative Strategic Plan for the Organ\r\non Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation (ISPO)\r\nwas launched to serve as an enabling instrument for the\r\nimplementation of the SADC developmental agenda\r\nembodied in the regional indicative strategic\r\ndevelopment plan. The core objective of the Organ is\r\nto create a peaceful and stable environment within\r\nwhich the region can endeavour to realize its socio-\r\neconomic objectives.\r\nHowever, a key factor for the implementation of\r\nthe Strategic Plan and the goals set by the Organ is the\r\navailability of resources. These resources will be an\r\nimportant factor in the success of both the regional\r\nindicative strategic development plan and ISPO. SADC\r\nrelies on contributions from its member States, but also\r\non financial and technical assistance from its partners\r\nin the international community. Increases in sources of\r\nfunding are essential for an effective realization of the\r\ngoals and the achievement of the targets that we have set.\r\nI do not want to dwell on the various problems\r\nfacing the SADC region. However, for the sake of\r\nemphasis, let me highlight the unprecedented\r\nHIV/AIDS crisis that has placed our region in a state of\r\nsevere vulnerability. Indeed, the SADC region is the\r\nepicenter of the global epidemic of HIV/AIDS.\r\nStatistics, we continue to observe, reflect a magnitude\r\nof the epidemic that has not been registered in any\r\nother part of the world. The majority of the countries in\r\nthe region remain the worst affected by any standards.\r\nSADC, for its part, however, has demonstrated,\r\nthrough the Maseru Declaration and plan of action, its\r\npriority commitment to combating the epidemic. While\r\nSADC member States will continue to implement\r\nnational and regional policies on HIV/AIDS, we solicit\r\nthe continued support and assistance of the United\r\nNations system and the international community in\r\naddressing this scourge.\r\nSADC commends United Nations Member States\r\nand the organizations and bodies of the United Nations\r\nsystem for their development cooperation with SADC,\r\nwhich SADC highly values. It is in this spirit that\r\nSADC initiated the process of obtaining observer status\r\nwithin the United Nations. Allow me to express our\r\ndeep appreciation to United Nations Member States for\r\nthe support extended for granting observer status to\r\nSADC. The draft resolution adopted by the Sixth\r\nCommittee earlier this month (A/C.6/59/L.5) will\r\nstrengthen and consolidate cooperation with the United\r\nNations to appropriately promote and enhance peace,\r\nstability, socio-economic development and the broader\r\nprinciples of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Petkov (Bulgaria): Allow me first to\r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession and to wish you the best of success in your\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nIt is a special honour for me to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly today, as I represent the Bulgarian\r\nchairmanship of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE). The OSCE comprises\r\nStates in Eurasia and the Euro-Atlantic area and is a\r\nregional security arrangement under the terms of\r\nChapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. We are\r\ncommitted to guaranteeing peace and stability as a pan-\r\nEuropean organization, and we fully cherish the United\r\nNations vision of effective multilateralism.\r\nI would like briefly to draw your attention to the\r\nbiennial draft resolution on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the OSCE. It provides a\r\ncomprehensive overview of the work of the\r\norganization. It shows the wide scope and depth of our\r\ncooperation, both in the field and on thematic issues.\r\nThe draft resolution, which is under discussion\r\namong delegations, underlines OSCE core activities in\r\nearly warning, conflict prevention, crisis management\r\nand post-conflict rehabilitation. It demonstrates how\r\nwe are adding new capabilities designed to tackle new\r\nthreats and challenges to security, policing, anti-\r\ntrafficking, border management and counter-terrorism.\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.38\r\nThese capacities have developed quickly and\r\neffectively since OSCE-United Nations cooperation\r\nwas last reviewed in 2002.\r\nCounter-terrorism deserves special attention. The\r\nshocking terrorist attacks in Madrid, Beslan and\r\nelsewhere demonstrate that none of our citizens can be\r\nsafe without joint and coordinated global action against\r\nsuch brutal acts. In our opinion, a decisive reform of\r\nregional security mechanisms is needed. We have to\r\nbuild up an effective network of technical and\r\nlogistical assistance among our organizations and\r\nprovide it with a specific counter-terrorism edge. This\r\nnetwork could thus respond instantly to the need to\r\ncombat terrorism. We are working closely with the\r\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and United\r\nNations Counter-Terrorism Committee and in the spirit\r\nof the relevant United Nations resolutions. We intend\r\nto take further practical steps and to assist OSCE States\r\nin enforcing the international legal standards enshrined\r\nin the relevant conventions and resolutions.\r\nI would also like to draw the Assembly’s\r\nattention to our increased focus on conflict resolution.\r\nIn the past two years, the OSCE has devoted\r\nsignificant efforts to achieving progress in resolving\r\nconflicts and diffusing tensions in the OSCE area. A\r\ngood example of practical cooperation in that context is\r\nKosovo, where the OSCE is a key pillar of the United\r\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo.\r\nEurope has a large number of highly capable\r\norganizations that are equipped to cope with a broad\r\nspectrum of security challenges. The more successful\r\nwe are, the greater the chances for peace and prosperity\r\nand the lighter the burden of the United Nations. The\r\nOSCE is constantly seeking to improve its political and\r\noperational contacts with regional and international\r\norganizations.\r\nTwo weeks ago, we all rejoiced at the historic and\r\npeaceful elections in Afghanistan. This was also an\r\nhistoric occasion for the OSCE, as it was the first time\r\nit launched an out-of-area operation. An election\r\nsupport team assisted the Afghan authorities and the\r\nUnited Nations in the election process. This\r\ndemonstrates the flexibility and effectiveness of the\r\nOSCE, its commitment to assisting its partners in\r\ncooperation as well as its effective cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations. We are now considering further\r\nways to share OSCE principles and experience with\r\ninterested States and regions.\r\nThere are two other areas of OSCE-United\r\nNations relations that I would like to highlight. The\r\nfirst is our cooperation with the United Nations\r\nEconomic Commission for Europe on economic and\r\nenvironmental issues. The second is our work in the\r\npolitical and military areas. In this case, the OSCE\r\nDocument on Small Arms and Light Weapons and the\r\nDocument on Stockpiles of Conventional Ammunition\r\ncomplement and even elaborate on United Nations\r\nwork in these fields.\r\nIn the next United Nations debate on OSCE-\r\nUnited Nations cooperation, to be held two years from\r\nnow, I am sure that we will be able to report on\r\nachievements in other areas such as anti-trafficking,\r\npolicing, and border management and security. These\r\nare growth areas for the OSCE, for which we hope to\r\ndraw on United Nations expertise.\r\nWe are living in a rapidly changing world in which\r\nregional, subregional and international organizations\r\nhave to rapidly adapt their collective response to\r\nthreats that put our global stability and regional\r\nsecurity at stake. The OSCE is doing its part in this,\r\nbut we think we can do even better. That is why we are\r\nconsidering how the OSCE can be made more effective\r\nin carrying out its diverse activities and made more\r\nrelevant as a forum for high-level political dialogue.\r\nThe OSCE Chairman-in-Office, the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Bulgaria, Mr.\r\nSolomon Passy, put forward a package of ideas for\r\ntransformation of the organization in recent\r\ncorrespondence to his colleagues from OSCE\r\nparticipating States. The main thrust of these ideas is to\r\nraise the political profile of the OSCE and to increase\r\nthe efficiency of its organs.\r\nThe OSCE and the United Nations speak a\r\ncommon language and have similar priorities in\r\naddressing contemporary threats to security. We have\r\nprovided input to the United Nations High-level Panel\r\nstudying global security threats, and we look forward\r\nto its recommendations.\r\nLet us set our agendas for the future in a\r\nharmonized approach to speed up reforms of old\r\nstructures, to defend the rule of law and fundamental\r\nhuman rights and to work for peace.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
