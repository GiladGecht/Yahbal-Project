United Nations assistance to the AU\r\nduring its transition from the Organization of African\r\nUnity has been of great importance. In that context, we\r\nwelcome the increased interaction between the Office of\r\nthe Special Adviser on Africa with the AU Commission.\r\nAs Africa continues to implement the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD), which is a\r\npartnership with the rest of the world, the Office of the\r\nSpecial Adviser on Africa is well placed to advocate\r\nprogress on the implementation and mobilization of\r\nsupport for NEPAD through the United Nations system.\r\nNow that the Commission of the African Union is fully\r\nfunctional, we believe that the assistance rendered\r\nduring the transition should be translated into concrete\r\nprogrammes of cooperation. In that regard, we applaud\r\nthe concrete steps taken by the World Food Programme\r\n(WFP) to enhance cooperation with the African Union,\r\nand we call for support in the four key priority areas\r\njointly agreed upon with the African Union.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAfrican Union in the area of peace and security, and\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nparticularly in peacekeeping missions and in brokering\r\npeace, is enhancing security in Africa. But it must be\r\nstressed that peacekeeping operations must go hand in\r\nhand with humanitarian efforts. That is true not only\r\nfor the conflict situation in Darfur but for other conflict\r\nsituations as well. When the international community\r\nis reluctant to respond generously to humanitarian\r\nappeals for Africa’s conflict and emergency situations,\r\nit regrettably sets back peace efforts and further\r\naggravates those situations. Therefore, it is important\r\nthat cooperation be deepened between the Security\r\nCouncil and the African Union’s Peace and Security\r\nCouncil, as well as between the United Nations system\r\nas a whole and the African Union Commission.\r\nI wish to point out that the challenges and the\r\nlevel of experience of regional organizations varies\r\nfrom region to region. That sharing of information and\r\nexperience will save scarce resources, prevent us from\r\nreinventing the wheel and enable us to adapt success\r\nstories to regional circumstances. In that respect, the\r\nquarterly magazine, Africa Renewal, continues to be an\r\neffective source of information. It not only\r\ndisseminates information on developments in Africa to\r\nthe world but also enables the five subregions of Africa\r\nto remain informed on developments in their own\r\nregion and on the continent as a whole.\r\nMr. Dauth (Australia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nI shall say a few words on the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community. In this regard, we associate\r\nourselves with the comments made by the\r\nrepresentative of the Republic of Botswana, who spoke\r\non behalf of all of us.\r\nThe Southern African Development Community\r\n(SADC) has long-standing relations with the United\r\nNations that go back as far as the struggle for\r\ndecolonization in Southern Africa. SADC, as a\r\ncommunity, continues to contribute to the realization of\r\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations and\r\nthus benefits immensely from this comity of nations.\r\nSADC has therefore requested the Secretary-General to\r\ngrant it accreditation as an observer to the General\r\nAssembly. We are confident that we can count on the\r\nsupport of all, in particular the regional organizations\r\nrepresented in the Assembly.\r\nIn March this year, SADC Heads of State and\r\nGovernment adopted its regional indicative strategic\r\ndevelopment plan. In formulating that plan, SADC\r\ntook into account the ongoing transformation of the\r\nAfrican Union and the launching of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). At the\r\nglobal level, economic challenges facing SADC\r\ninclude the process and the effects of globalization,\r\nwhich encompass, among other things, financial, trade\r\nand technological constraints. Thus, the regional\r\nindicative strategic development plan is aligned with\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. SADC continues\r\nto cooperate with the United Nations system through\r\nvarious programmes in areas such as peace and\r\nsecurity, health, education, the environment and\r\nsustainable resource management and trade. We\r\nappreciate the support of the United Nations system\r\nand call for increased resources for the Economic\r\nCommission for Africa.\r\nThe adverse climatic conditions of Southern\r\nAfrica result in recurring droughts and floods, leading\r\nto emergency situations including food shortages. In\r\nthat context, we welcome the establishment of the\r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\r\n(OCHA) Regional Support Office for Southern Africa\r\nand the Regional Inter-Agency Support Coordination\r\nOffice, which is proving to be effective in delivering\r\nand coordinating humanitarian assistance. Let me\r\nemphasize that the OCHA regional office can only\r\ncoordinate delivery. Assistance to complement the\r\nefforts of SADC must come from the international\r\ncommunity at large.\r\nAs the item under discussion is cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations,\r\nI would be remiss if I did not express my delegation’s\r\nthanks and appreciation to the European Union and other\r\ndevelopment partners, which continue to assist the\r\ndevelopment efforts of SADC countries in our region.\r\nThis brings me to a topic that is very close to my\r\nheart and for which I have worked for a number of\r\nyears since the independence of Namibia, namely, the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union.\r\nThe Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) has always\r\nadvocated a strong and effective multilateral system\r\nwith the United Nations at its centre. After all, IPU is\r\ncomprised of parliamentarians from Member States of\r\nour Organization, the United Nations.\r\nFollowing Namibia’s birth in 1990, IPU was one\r\nof the first international organizations my country\r\njoined. For the past 14 years, Namibia has been a loyal\r\nmember of IPU and has been privileged to witness the\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nexciting developments of the organization, particularly\r\nin the area of reform and, more importantly, its\r\ncooperation with the United Nations. As we all know, the\r\nUnion, founded in 1889, is an international organization\r\nunder which the world’s parliaments assemble.\r\nThe topic of cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union is indeed\r\nvery much in order, given the fact that, while the\r\nUnited Nations represents, for the most part, the\r\nexecutive arm of Member States, IPU represents the\r\nlegislative arm of Member States. It is therefore critical\r\nthat we applaud the observer status that the United\r\nNations has accorded IPU and the continued effort\r\naimed at improving the relationship between the two\r\norganizations.\r\nOver the past years, member parliaments of IPU\r\nhave asserted that it is important to approach solutions\r\nto global conflicts in a multidimensional manner to\r\nsupport and strengthen the United Nations system. As\r\nindicated in the report of the Secretary-General on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional and\r\nother organizations (A/59/303), IPU has been addressing\r\nissues similar to those concerning the United Nations.\r\nParliamentarians of the world, through IPU, have had\r\nto deal with issues of conflict, as witnessed in Iraq, the\r\nGreat Lakes region of Africa, the Middle East and other\r\nhot spots in the world. In its different forums, IPU has\r\naddressed issues relating to trade and development,\r\ninformation society, terrorism and the protection and\r\nthe promotion of human rights throughout the world.\r\nWe look forward to the recommendations of the High-\r\nlevel Panel to be issued later this year. Furthermore, as we\r\nmove towards the mid-term review of the implementation\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals, IPU, through the\r\nsecond Conference of Speakers and Presiding Officers of\r\nParliament, will pronounce itself on that very\r\nimportant development issue.\r\nIn conclusion, we support the conclusions of\r\nSecretary-General’s report relating to this question.\r\nMr. Bieri (Switzerland) (spoke in French): The\r\nimportance of cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the other international organizations hardly needs\r\nto be stressed. The aim is to achieve a better\r\ndistribution of tasks between the United Nations,\r\nwhich is the most important organization of a universal\r\nnature, and regional and sectoral organizations, which\r\nhave the goal of finding the best possible solutions to\r\nparticular problems of our time.\r\nThe pre-eminent role played by the United\r\nNations in peacekeeping and in authorizing the use of\r\nforce is, for us, a fundamental principle. Apart from\r\ncases of legitimate defence, force may be used only\r\nwith the approval of the Security Council.\r\nOur conception of the nature of relations between\r\nthe United Nations and regional organizations is based\r\non another principle — that of subsidiarity. With its 26\r\ncantons and 2,800 communes, Switzerland puts the\r\nprinciple of task-sharing into practice on a daily basis.\r\nThus we enable actors on the ground to formulate and\r\nthen to implement — in cooperation with higher\r\nauthorities — solutions that best respond to the needs\r\nof the local population.\r\nThere can be no doubt that major contemporary\r\nchallenges in the fields of security, sustainable\r\ndevelopment in all its aspects and respect for human\r\nrights need to be discussed at the international level\r\nwithin the institutions of the United Nations.\r\nNevertheless, regional and sectoral organizations have\r\nan essential role to play in the search for solutions that\r\nare appropriate to specific regional, social or cultural\r\ncontexts and to the implementation of such solutions.\r\nIn our view, organizations with a parliamentary\r\ndimension, such as the Inter-Parliamentary Union at\r\nthe global level and the Council of Europe and the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE) at the regional level, have a special role to\r\nplay in this context.\r\nSwiss institutions have traditionally taken an\r\nopen approach to civil society as a whole. Elected\r\nrepresentatives, in particular members of parliament,\r\nplay a key role in conveying the aspirations and the\r\nconcerns of civil society. We are therefore particularly\r\ninterested in the recent proposals to make the United\r\nNations more open to national parliaments and hence\r\nto new partners from civil society, the private sector\r\nand non-governmental organizations. We also noted\r\nwith great interest the recommendations of the recent\r\nCardoso report, which advocates, in particular,\r\nimproved participation by national parliaments in the\r\nwork of the United Nations. It is essential that the\r\nvoice of the people be heard, and historical experience\r\nhas shown that it is parliaments that are best able to\r\narticulate the aspirations of peoples to live together in\r\npeace, with respect for their identity.\r\nThe Council of Europe is an example of a\r\nregional organization that, thanks to a strong network\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nof conventions, is able to ensure an increasingly close\r\nunion among its members. Since the fall of the Berlin\r\nWall, the OSCE has been working hard to bring a new\r\nera of democracy, peace and unity to the European\r\ncontinent.\r\nSince Switzerland became a full member of the\r\nUnited Nations as a result of an initiative and a\r\ndecision by the Swiss people, the federal parliament\r\nhas shown great interest in the activities of the United\r\nNations. My country’s Government has been keeping\r\nparliament informed and consulting with it on the\r\npositions that it takes in the United Nations. It\r\nencourages parliamentarians to participate in General\r\nAssembly debates, which is why I have the honour of\r\naddressing the Assembly now, as chairman of the\r\nSwiss delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union\r\n(IPU) and as a member of the official Swiss delegation.\r\nThe opportunities for cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the IPU — the “parliament of\r\nparliaments” — are enormous, and deserve to be\r\ndeveloped. The text of the draft resolution on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the IPU,\r\nwhich will be submitted to the General Assembly, lays\r\nthe foundation for strengthening cooperation between\r\nthe two organizations and underscores the increasing\r\nparliamentary contribution and support that the IPU\r\ncan bring to the United Nations.\r\nThe decision to hold, in September 2005, a\r\nsecond conference of speakers of national parliaments,\r\nis an important symbol of this cooperation. It will be a\r\njoint United Nations-IPU meeting to consider possible\r\nways of strengthening the parliamentary dimension of\r\ninternational cooperation in the fields of peace and\r\nsecurity, economic and social development, international\r\nlaw, human rights, democracy and gender equality.\r\nThat is a specific example of collaboration\r\nbetween the United Nations and the IPU, aimed at\r\nenabling us to find global solutions to the problems\r\nconfronting us at the beginning of the twenty-first\r\ncentury — problems such as war, hunger, disease,\r\nunemployment and the inequitable distribution of\r\nwealth and of knowledge. My country, Switzerland, is,\r\nof course, prepared to play its part in resolving those\r\nenormous problems.\r\nMr. Løvald (Norway): Norway, as a founding\r\nmember of the Council of Europe, has always given\r\nthat organization high priority. During our current\r\nchairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the\r\nCouncil of Europe, we have worked to further enhance\r\nand strengthen the cooperation between the Council of\r\nEurope and other organizations. It is in that spirit that\r\nwe welcome this opportunity to review the status of the\r\ncooperation between the Council of Europe and the\r\nUnited Nations. We welcome the report prepared by\r\nthe Secretary-General. It serves as a useful basis for\r\ndiscussions on the development of relations between\r\nthe two organizations.\r\nThe Council of Europe has been implementing, in\r\nEurope, the ideas and principles of the United Nations.\r\nEuropean instruments and mechanisms work to secure\r\nthe principles of democracy, human rights and the rule\r\nof law for more than 800 million people. Those shared\r\nideas and principles have been applied through close\r\ncooperation between the Council of Europe and United\r\nNations organizations such as Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization, the United Nations Human Settlements\r\nProgramme, the World Health Organization and the\r\nInternational Labour Organization.\r\nWe welcome the further development of\r\ncooperation between the Council of Europe and the\r\nUnited Nations family. In an increasingly interdependent\r\nworld, the international political agenda is dominated by\r\nthe threat of terrorism. The Council of Europe and the\r\nUnited Nations share the view that the global threat of\r\nterrorism must be met with a global response. Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1566 (2004) is an important step\r\ntowards further consolidating international efforts\r\nagainst terrorism. The Council of Europe believes that\r\nany response to terrorism should be in accordance with\r\nthe values of democracy and the rule of law. We\r\nbelieve the Council of Europe’s Committee of Experts\r\non Terrorism will become an ever-more important\r\npartner for the Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee in the global fight against terrorism.\r\nThe Council of Europe is committed to promoting\r\nintercultural dialogue. Only through dialogue can we\r\npromote human rights, tolerance, good governance and\r\neconomic development and thereby promote stability\r\nand secure prosperity. Through increased cooperation\r\nwith regional and subregional organizations, we can\r\nimprove the interaction between various partners to\r\nbuild democratic societies based on the rule of law.\r\nThe Council of Europe, the United Nations and the\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\nhave, since 1994, met annually in a high-level tripartite\r\nmeeting. Several other organizations and institutions\r\nhave, over the years, contributed to that meeting. We\r\nlook forward to further developing the annual meeting\r\nas an arena for dialogue.\r\nWe note that, in his opening statement to the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral stressed the importance of rule of law\r\nnationally, as well as internationally. His perspective\r\nprovides us with a good basis for exploring\r\npossibilities to further enhance the cooperation\r\nbetween our two organizations.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to emphasize once again the close and\r\ncomprehensive cooperation between the Council of\r\nEurope and the United Nations. The Norwegian\r\nchairmanship looks forward to this opportunity to\r\nfurther develop these relations.\r\nMr. Atkinson (United Kingdom): I would like to\r\nstart by thanking the representative of Norway, who\r\nhas just spoken on behalf of the member States of the\r\nCouncil of Europe, and to fully endorse that statement.\r\nI would like to speak specifically about relations\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Council of Europe\r\nas an example of cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations.\r\nThe United Kingdom is pleased that this year’s\r\ndraft resolution on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Council of Europe recognizes the\r\nimportant role the Council of Europe plays in\r\npromoting and protecting human rights, the rule of law\r\nand pluralist democracy throughout Europe, thereby\r\nhelping to pursue the aims and ideals of the United\r\nNations.\r\nI was particularly pleased to see that the draft\r\nresolution also notes the constructive interest shown by\r\nthe Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe\r\nin the reform of the United Nations. I say this because I\r\nhave the honour to be a member of the Parliamentary\r\nAssembly and of its Political Affairs Committee, which\r\nproduced a report earlier this year entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations”.\r\nThat report encourages the United Nations to\r\nmake full use of the expertise of regional organizations\r\nsuch as the Council of Europe in addressing global\r\nthreats and in implementing the various programmes\r\nand activities of the United Nations. The experience of\r\nthe Council of Europe in specific areas such as\r\ndeveloping democratic security and stability, its\r\nactivities in the promotion and the protection of human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, confidence-building\r\nmeasures, the protection of national minorities,\r\npromoting equal opportunities between women and\r\nmen and the fight against racism can only strengthen\r\nand complement the work of the United Nations as it\r\nseeks to respond to the new global threats of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe report also calls for the introduction of a\r\nparliamentary dimension to the work of the General\r\nAssembly. The long experience of the Parliamentary\r\nAssembly of the Council of Europe reinforces the\r\nmessage that elected members of national parliaments\r\ncan come forward with solutions to problems that\r\nGovernments — and the United Nations itself — may\r\nhave difficulty solving. Where intergovernmental\r\nactivity and diplomacy have failed at the top,\r\nconversations between parliamentarians can start\r\ninitiatives that can succeed at the bottom.\r\nRelations between the Council of Europe and the\r\nUnited Nations go back over 50 years, and our\r\ncooperation continues to improve. This cooperation\r\ntakes many forms, including meetings between bodies\r\nof our two organizations. An example of that was a\r\nmeeting in Paris last February between a Parliamentary\r\nAssembly delegation and members of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\r\nChange. This exchange of views proved beneficial for\r\nboth sides, as it highlighted the role that regional\r\norganizations such as ours could play — not as\r\nautonomous players, but in cooperation with the United\r\nNations in responding to global threats and challenges.\r\nKosovo provides other examples of cooperation\r\nas once again, at the request of United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE), the Council of Europe will be mounting an\r\nelection observation mission for the forthcoming\r\nelections to the Kosovo Assembly. UNMIK has also\r\nrecently signed two agreements that will pave the way\r\nfor two Council of Europe human rights conventions to\r\nbe applied to Kosovo. These are the Framework\r\nConvention for the Protection of National Minorities\r\nand the European Convention for the Prevention of\r\nTorture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or\r\nPunishment.\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nAs UNMIK’s recent signing of the two Council\r\nof Europe agreements illustrates, the Council of\r\nEurope’s principal contribution to human rights is its\r\nlegal instruments. The most well known is, of course,\r\nthe European Convention on Human Rights, which\r\nbuilt upon the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nThe Council of Europe’s Framework Convention for\r\nthe Protection of National Minorities is another legally\r\nbinding instrument based on principles established in\r\nUnited Nations texts.\r\nI should also highlight the Tripartite High-Level\r\nMeeting held in Vienna in February this year between\r\nrepresentatives of the United Nations, the Council of\r\nEurope and the OSCE. That meeting discussed how to\r\nrespond to threats to security and stability in the\r\ntwenty-first century and how to improve cooperation.\r\nThe participants agreed to step up the fight against\r\nracism, xenophobia, all forms of religious intolerance\r\nand discrimination. They also highlighted the Council\r\nof Europe’s conventions and monitoring mechanisms\r\nin this field and urged closer cooperation between\r\npartner organizations.\r\nParticipants at the meeting also underlined the need\r\nfor a common and effective framework to combat acts of\r\nterrorism, which gravely impact on the enjoyment of\r\nhuman rights, in particular the right to life, and stressed\r\nthe need to respect human rights under international\r\nlaw. In that regard, they welcomed the Council of\r\nEurope’s Guidelines on Human Rights and the Fight\r\nagainst Terrorism and the work currently under way.\r\nWe in Europe do not forget that we too have\r\nexperienced our 9/11s, most recently on 3/11 this year\r\nin Madrid, 8/24 in the air over Russia, followed by 9/3\r\nat Beslan. Which of our Member States here will be\r\nnext? To win this war requires the support of every\r\nmember of the United Nations.\r\nThe Council of Europe’s Committee of Experts\r\non Terrorism recently concluded that the Council of\r\nEurope could bring further added value to the fight\r\nagainst terrorism through focused and specifically\r\ntargeted instruments dealing with the prevention of\r\nterrorism and covering existing gaps in international\r\nlaw on action against terrorism.\r\nThe international legal framework aimed at\r\ncombating terrorism is already extensive, and the highest\r\npriority should be given to obtaining the widest possible\r\nratification and implementation of existing agreements.\r\nThe United Kingdom remains of the view that the most\r\nvaluable additional legal instrument would be a United\r\nNations comprehensive convention on terrorism.\r\nThese are just a few of the areas of cooperation\r\nthat exist between our two organizations. I am sure that\r\nthe good relations that exist will continue and will\r\nimprove in the coming years. The Council of Europe\r\nputs much emphasis on improving synergies between\r\ninternational organizations and reducing any\r\nduplication that may exist. That is why cooperation\r\nwith international organizations will be on the agenda\r\nfor the third Council of Europe Summit, which will be\r\nhosted by Poland next year.\r\nIn conclusion, the Council of Europe looks to the\r\nUnited Nations to take the lead on global conflict\r\nprevention and human rights issues. In turn, the\r\nCouncil of Europe, as the only truly pan-European\r\norganization, can enhance the ideals laid down by the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and make important\r\ncontributions in advancing the universal goals and\r\nvalues of the United Nations throughout Europe.\r\nI reiterate on behalf of the United Kingdom the\r\nneed for cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional and other organizations to continue and\r\nimprove where possible, and for the United Nations to\r\nmake full use of the expertise of regional organizations,\r\nsuch as the Council of Europe, in addressing global\r\nthreats and in making the United Nations a more\r\neffective organization.\r\nMr. Diarra (Mali) (spoke in French): My\r\ndelegation also associates itself with the statement\r\nmade by the delegation of Nigeria on behalf of the\r\nAfrican Union. Allow me to express the great\r\nappreciation of my delegation for the high quality of\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and other\r\norganizations (A/59/303) now under consideration.\r\nMy delegation’s observations will be primarily\r\nfocused on cooperation with the African Union, with\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and,\r\nfinally, on the relationship between the United Nations\r\nand the International Organization of la Francophonie.\r\nAt the outset, my delegation welcomes the\r\nexistence of a framework for consultation between the\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General and the heads of\r\nregional organizations. The review of that mechanism,\r\nplanned for 2005, will provide an opportunity to lay\r\ndown plans for practical follow-up for the future.\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nThe United Nations contribution to establishing\r\nthe newly created African Union institutions has been\r\nconcrete and important. The Office of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Special Adviser on Africa has actively\r\nparticipated in formulating the strategic framework of\r\nthe Union and in mobilizing international efforts for\r\nthe implementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). The contribution of the\r\nSecretary-General’s inter-institutional Advisory Panel\r\nhas also made it possible to strengthen capacities in the\r\narea of NEPAD sectoral policies.\r\nThe new regional and international context calls\r\nfor the creation of an African defence and security\r\nsystem and for reorienting the scope and missions of\r\nsubregional and continental security institutions. We\r\nwelcome the participation of United Nations experts in\r\nestablishing the AU Peace and Security Council and in\r\ndrawing up the Common African Defence and Security\r\nPolicy. The strengthening of the capacity of the Peace\r\nand Security Council to act promptly and to coordinate\r\nits actions requires a sustained United Nations effort to\r\npromote the implementation of the early warning system,\r\nthe creation of an African standby force and the drawing\r\nup of a memorandum of understanding on relations\r\nbetween the African Union and subregional mechanisms\r\nfor conflict prevention, management and resolution.\r\nThe spread of small arms and light weapons is a\r\nmajor source of concern in terms of security on the\r\ncontinent. The assistance provided by the United\r\nNations Development Programme, through its\r\nProgramme for Coordination and Assistance for\r\nSecurity and Development, for the implementation of\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States\r\nMoratorium on Small Arms and Light Weapons should\r\nbe strengthened and expanded to other subregions of\r\nthe continent.\r\nThe adoption of the African Union’s Plan of\r\nAction for the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism\r\nand the establishment of the African Centre for Study\r\nand Research on Terrorism, inaugurated in October\r\n2004 in Algeria, are Africa’s most recent responses to\r\nthe threat of international terrorism. To succeed, these\r\ninitiatives require the support and the technical and\r\nfinancial assistance of the United Nations system.\r\nMoreover, conflict situations in Africa are\r\ncharacterized by the forced recruitment of children\r\nunder the age of 18. The United Nations and the\r\nAfrican Union must work to pool their actions in\r\nmanaging this situation.\r\nThe report under consideration highlights the\r\ncooperation now existing between the United Nations\r\nsystem and the AU in peacekeeping efforts. Regarding the\r\nspecific situation in Somalia, the establishment of a\r\ntransitional parliament and the election of Mr. Abdullahi\r\nYusuf Ahmed as President of the Republic of Somalia\r\nopens the way to the restoration of peace and security\r\nin that country. United Nations support in the\r\nconsolidation of that process is urgently needed.\r\nMore generally speaking, we encourage the\r\nUnited Nations to conclude arrangements with the\r\nAfrican Union and subregional organizations, to\r\ninvolve them in planning and strategic management for\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations in Africa.\r\nFurthermore, my delegation welcomes the\r\ncontribution of the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights towards strengthening\r\ncapacity in the area of human rights, particularly the\r\nrights of women and children, including by providing\r\nassistance for the establishment of an African human\r\nrights documentation centre.\r\nSupport of the United Nations system to Africa in\r\nthe areas of humanitarian assistance, the management\r\nof natural disasters, food security and the dissemination\r\nof information is essential to alleviate the suffering of\r\nthe most vulnerable population groups. We hail the\r\nopening in Addis Ababa of a World Food Programme\r\nliaison office to the African Union.\r\nMy delegation takes note of the constructive\r\ncooperation existing between the United Nations and\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference on\r\npolitical, economic, social and humanitarian issues. In\r\nparticular, we believe that the two organizations should\r\nshoulder primary responsibility for assisting the\r\nPalestinian people in its legitimate quest to recover its\r\ninalienable right to self-determination and to the\r\ncreation of an independent State. To that end, the\r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of\r\nthe Palestinian People and the Division for Palestinian\r\nRights must be supported and strengthened.\r\nThe record of cooperation between the\r\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie (OIF)\r\nand the United Nations over the period under\r\nconsideration is instructive. Whether it be in the area\r\nof early warning, conflict prevention and management,\r\nsupervision of elections, strengthening capacity for\r\ninternational negotiations, advancement of gender\r\nissues or the creation of education-for-all programmes,\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nthe OIF has proved itself to be a dynamic organization.\r\nThe OIF contribution to a successful first phase of the\r\nWorld Summit on the Information Society, held in\r\nGeneva, augurs well for the success of the second\r\nphase, planned for Tunis in November 2005. The OIF\r\nis making a significant contribution to strengthening\r\nmultilingualism in the United Nations system. That is a\r\nnoble effort, and it deserves to be supported.\r\nMr. Vila Coma (Andorra) (spoke in French): I\r\nhave the honour of speaking under agenda item 56 (j),\r\non cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), as discussed in Part\r\nFive of the Secretary-General’s report (A/59/303)\r\nbefore us today. In that connection, allow me to\r\nunderscore the interest shown in a May 2004 letter\r\nfrom our Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed to the\r\nSecretary-General (A/59/97, annex). In that letter, he\r\nstated the position of the Government of Andorra.\r\nAndorra fully supports the Secretary-General’s\r\nefforts to strengthen cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the IPU. My country’s support is\r\nmanifested also in the backing our parliamentary\r\ndelegation has given to the IPU’s recommendations\r\nconcerning the conclusions of the Panel of Eminent\r\nPersons on United Nations-Civil Society Relations,\r\nwhich were discussed at the 110th Inter-Parliamentary\r\nAssembly, held in Mexico from 15 to 23 April 2004.\r\nAndorra also supports the consultations devoted\r\nto defining a common conception of how to bring a\r\nparliamentary dimension into the work of the United\r\nNations. We also welcome the significant increase in\r\nthe contribution made by parliaments when dealing\r\nwith various United Nations subjects.\r\nWe should like to stress four points in particular.\r\nFirst, the developing cooperation between the IPU and\r\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization in the realm of education seems to us\r\never more relevant.\r\nSecondly, in the realm of peace and security, I\r\nshould like to highlight the superb teamwork between\r\nthe IPU and the United Nations system in fighting\r\nterrorism.\r\nThirdly, in the realm of social development, I\r\nwant to hail the cooperation between the IPU and the\r\nCommittee on the Elimination of Discrimination\r\nagainst Women, with a view to ensuring more in-depth\r\nconsideration of gender-specific issues.\r\nFinally, as regards sustainable development, the\r\nfull panoply of cooperation and joint work done by the\r\nUnited Nations and the IPU is helpful not only in\r\nanalysing how far we have come towards attaining the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, but also in preparing\r\nfor the second World Conference of Speakers of\r\nParliament, scheduled for September 2005 in New York.\r\nThe Andorran Government welcomes the role\r\nplayed by the IPU in all these realms and is happy to\r\nmake its contribution to development assistance; next\r\nyear we will reach the goal set three years ago of\r\nexpanding that assistance.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to stress the Andorran\r\nGovernment’s support for cooperation between\r\nGovernments and parliaments in the international\r\nsetting of the United Nations. Andorra has always\r\njoined in sponsoring a variety of draft resolutions and\r\nwill continue to do so in pursuit of the goal of actively\r\nsupporting such cooperation. We should like to pay\r\ntribute to the Chilean delegation for its coordination on\r\nthis item.\r\nMr. Severin (Romania): Today we are addressing\r\none of the main issues in the contemporary debate on\r\ninternational relations. Cooperation with regional\r\norganizations is a key issue for the United Nations with\r\nregard to maintaining world peace and security,\r\nensuring opportunities for development and tackling\r\nthe new threats and challenges to our society. With the\r\nsupport of regional organizations, the United Nations\r\ncan build a more stable foundation for peace and a\r\nbetter life in all regions of the world. The synergetic\r\npartnership of the United Nations with regional\r\norganizations invites optimal use of resources and\r\ncapabilities.\r\nThe world is not yet a truly global place; or,\r\nbetter put, the world is global but is not, and will not\r\nbe, homogeneous. The world is truly global to the\r\nextent that the most important phenomena, processes\r\nand trends are interlinked, and major events are echoed\r\nand have repercussions far from where they take place.\r\nThe world is also global because ideas and information\r\ncirculate freely, thereby making people aware of one\r\nanother and, eventually, dependent on one another.\r\nOn the other hand, the sources of danger, the\r\nopportunities and the challenges are local, as are the\r\ncultural, familial and societal background against\r\nwhich one reacts to, and copes with, those dangers,\r\nopportunities and challenges. The conjunction of these\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nfacts and factors provides global relevance to local\r\nrealities. The enhancement of political power and the\r\nrationale behind it might be global, but the resources\r\nthat are the basis of any power are local. Therefore,\r\nultimately, any political action is local. In fact, any\r\nglobal action is a local action with a universal impact.\r\nGlobalization therefore imposes local empowerment,\r\nregional integration, inter-regional cooperation and,\r\nmore generally, subsidiarity.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, regional organizations\r\nhave certain unique advantages — faster deployment\r\ncapabilities, better use of resources, closer knowledge\r\nof political realities on the ground, among others —\r\nthat make them the United Nations partners of choice\r\nin dealing with the whole spectrum of objectives on\r\ntoday’s international agenda. That point is central to\r\nRomania’s vision of the reform of the United Nations\r\nand of international relations. Recently, in July 2004,\r\nRomania organized a Security Council debate on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations in stabilization processes (see\r\nS/PV.5007). That was not a one-time event, but will be\r\nfollowed up as a dominant theme of Romania’s elected\r\nmandate in the Security Council.\r\nRecent remarkable examples of good cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations\r\ninclude the European Union peace enforcement\r\nmission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nNATO’s taking over command of the International\r\nSecurity Assistance Force and the field activities of the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE) and the European Union in South-Eastern\r\nEurope and the southern Caucasus. Those examples\r\nillustrate the numerous advantages of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations,\r\nas well as the wide variety of possible inter-\r\ninstitutional arrangements. I would also like to point\r\nout the cooperation that exists between the United\r\nNations and the Council of Europe, as I also hold the\r\nchairmanship of the Council of Europe’s Parliamentary\r\nAssembly Subcommittee on External Relations.\r\nThose two organizations have worked closely on\r\nseveral missions and in many international\r\nconferences. I would mention just a few by citing the\r\ncooperation measures with the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo, most notably in the\r\nareas of human rights, legal reform, education and\r\nculture; the cooperation between the Council of Europe\r\nand the former United Nations Mission in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina on legal and human rights programmes,\r\nthe implementation of the European Convention on\r\nHuman Rights and the reform of prisons and detention\r\ninstitutions; and the increased mutual contribution to\r\ninternational efforts against terrorism.\r\nOn the recommendation of its Parliamentary\r\nAssembly, the Council of Europe is currently\r\nintensifying its relationship with the United Nations.\r\nThe members of the Subcommittee on External\r\nRelations are all here in New York to exchange views\r\nwith United Nations officials on common issues of\r\nconcern and on how to reinforce cooperation between\r\nour organizations. The Council of Europe has built up\r\nbroad experience on key issues on the global agenda.\r\nWithin the United Nations, we are committed draw the\r\nbest possible value from that experience and to be an\r\nactive part of the United Nations and the adaptation of\r\nthe international framework to today’s new realities.\r\nIt is obvious that the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe have common goals and many\r\nsimilar visions, but different means. They could\r\ntherefore develop their respective effectiveness through\r\nsynergy. Among many other things, the United Nations\r\ncould make use of the Council of Europe’s concept of\r\ndemocratic security, its unique mechanism of\r\ntransnational parliamentary monitoring and its\r\nexperience in transnational enhancement of the rule of\r\nlaw and human rights through the European Court of\r\nHuman Rights and recognizing an individual’s right to\r\nhave recourse to it. It could also make use of the\r\nCouncil of Europe’s practices concerning the\r\ndevelopment of local self-government on the basis of\r\nthe ideas of decentralization, devolution and\r\nsubsidiarity and on structured dialogue and cooperation\r\namong local communities within the Congress of Local\r\nand Regional Authorities.\r\nWhile the need for enhanced cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and regional organizations is\r\nwidely recognized and welcomed, the best way to\r\nachieve that is still under consideration. Romania trusts\r\nthat this topic will feature prominently in the report of\r\nthe High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\r\nChange. In that context, I should also mention the\r\nimportance of the hearings organized this year in Paris\r\nby the Council of Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly\r\nGeneral Committee on Political Affairs and Security\r\nwith the members of the High-level Panel. We hope\r\nthat the conclusions of those debates will be reflected\r\nin the final document of the Panel.\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nSimilarly, I should mention that, from a\r\ncooperative perspective, the Parliamentary Assembly\r\nof the Council of Europe has adopted a number of\r\nresolutions and recommendations on the subject of\r\nstrengthening the United Nations. We believe that it\r\nwould be fair and wholly justified for similar ideas\r\ncoming from regional organizations such as ours to be\r\ntaken into consideration by the United Nations and that\r\nrelevant United Nations documents make explicit\r\nreference to those contributions.\r\nAs we search for best modes of cooperation we\r\nmust keep in mind that the differing characteristics of\r\nregional organizations in terms of membership,\r\nresource availability and institutional capacity, as well\r\nas the uniqueness of each particular situation, defy the\r\nconstruction of a universal model of cooperation.\r\nNevertheless, as we have heard today, some general\r\nprinciples should guide cooperative processes, namely,\r\nthe primacy of Chapter VIII of the Charter and of the\r\nrole of the United Nations and the Security Council in\r\npreserving international peace and security. Likewise,\r\none should accept as universal the principle that\r\nmeasures to increase security and protect stability must\r\nnot be taken at the expense of respect for human rights\r\nand individual freedoms.\r\nIf our discussions today are to serve a meaningful\r\npurpose, cooperation should be based on the\r\ncomparative advantages of the United Nations and of\r\nregional organizations. Those comparative advantages\r\nshould also determine the most appropriate\r\norganization to be used in a given conflict situation.\r\nFor that reason, cooperation must be an ongoing\r\nprocess culminating in the evaluation of lessons\r\nlearned and best practices. We therefore regret the fact\r\nthat General Assembly resolutions on cooperation with\r\nregional organizations still lack substance, vision and a\r\npragmatic approach. We are thinking in particular of\r\ndocuments referring to United Nations relations with\r\nthe Council of Europe, the OSCE and the European\r\nUnion. We recognize that the system of fundamental\r\nvalues promoted by those European organizations —\r\nespecially by the Council of Europe — is not shared by\r\nall United Nations Member States. We should also\r\nadmit that — apart from the basic rights and freedoms\r\nwhich are universal — there exists a kind of\r\ndemocratic variability that reflects different cultural\r\nbackgrounds.\r\nHowever, the goal of the United Nations should\r\nbe to develop respect for diversity in such a way as to\r\nmake universal values more vibrant, and not more\r\nirrelevant. We therefore believe that United Nations\r\ndocuments should highlight the virtues of the values\r\ndefined and developed within various regional\r\norganizations such as the European ones I have just\r\nmentioned. At the same time, United Nations\r\ndocuments should lead to the establishment of\r\nappropriate forums in which regional organizations\r\ncould present, explain and defend their specific values.\r\nReinforcing cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional organizations also requires innovative and\r\npragmatic efforts to pool together all the resources\r\navailable to make optimal and rational use of those\r\nresources in any given situation. There is, however, a\r\ngreater need to develop the capacity of regional\r\norganizations to make full use of their potential assets.\r\nWe can thus identify the most relevant issues for\r\nthe debate on how to increase cooperation and, where\r\nneeded, coordination between the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations: subsidiarity, comparative\r\nadvantages, funding, mechanisms of effective\r\ncoordination and linkage, communication and\r\nexchange of information, regional capacity-building,\r\noversight and feedback. A benchmark for such\r\nincreased cooperation would be to make progress in\r\nconflict prevention, in the management of post-conflict\r\nsituations and in advancing the settlement of so-called\r\nfrozen crises.\r\nIn that connection, there are several frozen\r\nconflicts in the Euro-Atlantic area, in Nagorny\r\nKarabakh, Transdniestria and South Ossetia, among\r\nothers. These crises clearly need the regional\r\norganizations to enhance their approaches, under the\r\ngeneral oversight of the United Nations and the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThere is growing cooperation among regional\r\norganizations themselves, as witnessed by partnership\r\nagreements for logistical and military support. A\r\npraiseworthy illustration of effective multilateralism at\r\nwork is the trilateral cooperation that is developing\r\namong the African Union, the European Union and the\r\nUnited Nations, which is aimed at alleviating the\r\nsuffering of the over 2 million people who are in need\r\nas a result of the Darfur crisis.\r\nAs the world body responsible for international\r\npeace and security, the Security Council has a clear\r\nrole to play in assisting capacity-building and funding\r\nfor the regional organizations that need it. The Council\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nmight thus consider appealing for more energetic\r\nsupport from the international donor community for\r\nregional peace and security initiatives.\r\nFinally, I would like to stress the importance of\r\ninvolving inter-parliamentary regional assemblies, such\r\nas the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of\r\nEurope, in the cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional organizations. Generally speaking, the\r\ndevelopment of a parliamentary dimension within the\r\nUnited Nations is very much needed. As part of such a\r\nproject, I would suggest that the United Nations\r\nestablish advisory councils for regional inter-\r\nparliamentary assemblies and for elected local and\r\nregional authorities. In that respect, I would like to\r\nexpress support for the proposal included in the report\r\nof the Panel of Eminent Persons on United Nations-\r\nCivil Society Relations (A/58/817 and Corr.1)\r\nconcerning the establishment by the Secretary-General\r\nof an elected representatives liaison unit, which, among\r\nother missions, should have the capacity to organize\r\ncommunication with — and integrate the contributions\r\nof — regional inter-parliamentary assemblies.\r\nBefore ending, I would like to comment on the\r\nstability and democratization of my own country and,\r\nindeed, of Eastern and Central Europe in general,\r\nwhich are largely due to the dynamics of regional\r\nintegration. Support from the European Union and the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Romania’s\r\nemulation of governance patterns in countries members\r\nof those organizations has strengthened our advance\r\ntowards democracy and the rule of law. Not only were\r\nwe recipients of multilateral expertise in the field of\r\neconomic development and regional peace and\r\nstability, but we ourselves gradually became promoters\r\nof cooperative frameworks and initiatives aimed at\r\nenhancing regional cohesiveness in addressing the\r\nsecurity climate in the Balkans.\r\nGiven our membership in — and 2001\r\nchairmanship of — the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe, our current membership in the\r\nSouth-East European Cooperation Process and our bid\r\nfor European Union membership, Romania rightly\r\nvalues regional undertakings and can contribute to\r\nidentifying within the United Nations the most\r\nadequate means to foster cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations in peace and\r\nsecurity and development activities. The stakes are\r\nvery high. We must reach the kind of cooperation\r\nbetween our universal Organization and our regional\r\nundertakings that will enable us to address every issue,\r\nto respond to every crisis and to end any conflict.\r\nMr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French):\r\nBefore delving into the heart of the matter, I would like\r\nto thank the Secretary-General for the exhaustive\r\nreport he has made available to us (A/59/303), which\r\nwill be the essential underpinning for our discussions\r\nof agenda item 56, entitled “Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional and other organizations”.\r\nWe would have liked to speak of all the themes\r\nthat make up this agenda item, as they all seem\r\nimportant to us. Obvious time constraints, however,\r\ncompel us to be selective and thus to confine our\r\nstatement to cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the African Union (AU), the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion (IPU) and the International Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie (OIF).\r\nGiven its geographical size, the AU is the\r\nbroadest of regional political organizations. Its impact\r\non the way in which world affairs are addressed is\r\ntherefore far from negligible; I would venture say it is\r\ndecisive. In fact, over the years, the former\r\nOrganization of African Unity, which has since become\r\nthe AU, has proven an aptitude and capacity for\r\ncontributing to peacekeeping and the settlement of\r\nconflicts. The latest of these initiatives was the\r\ndispatching of African troops to Darfur. Strengthening\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the AU\r\ncould thus only serve the cause of peace, as, through\r\nthe logistical and financial assistance the United\r\nNations could provide, it would enhance Africa’s\r\npotential for becoming involved in shouldering its\r\ninternational responsibilities.\r\nIn other areas, such as the economic, social,\r\nhumanitarian and cultural spheres, this cooperation,\r\nwhich remains limited, should also be stepped up. It is\r\nto the credit of the United Nations that it has already\r\ntaken on board the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and the programme to fight\r\nHIV/AIDS while waiting for the 2005 summit on the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) to definitively\r\nspecify its level of commitment in fighting poverty.\r\nIn recent years, we have seen a strengthening of\r\nthe ties between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union. There is no need to dwell on all\r\nthat has been undertaken, but I cannot fail to mention\r\nthe historic Millennium Summit, held here in 2000,\r\nwhich began to draw the United Nations and the IPU\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\ncloser together and which led to the IPU being granted\r\nobserver status.\r\nWhat parliaments can contribute to the United\r\nNations therefore seems to no longer be a question.\r\nIndeed, through their decisive involvement in the\r\ncurrent vital issues facing humankind — the quest for\r\npeace, cooperation for development and fighting\r\npoverty, among others — parliaments have shown that\r\nthey have become indispensable actors in international\r\nlife, leading some to speak of parliamentary diplomacy.\r\nOn 19 and 20 October, a Parliamentary Hearing\r\nwas held at United Nations Headquarters, with an\r\ninteractive debate on major issues such as arms control,\r\npeacekeeping operations and the role of women,\r\nparticularly in post-conflict rebuilding. The outcome of\r\nthe Hearing strongly confirmed that involvement, as\r\ndid that of the 111th Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, just\r\nheld in Geneva, which clearly set out the role of\r\nparliaments in strengthening multilateral non-\r\nproliferation mechanisms, in preserving biodiversity\r\nand in the resolute support they must provide to the\r\nBeijing Declaration and Platform for Action.\r\nMy delegation supports the IPU’s request for\r\nmore time to consider the proposals contained in the\r\nreport of the Panel of Eminent Persons on United\r\nNations-Civil Society Relations — the Cardoso report.\r\nWe would also like to congratulate the Permanent\r\nObserver of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and his\r\nteam for their hard work in advancing the ideals of IPU\r\nhere in the United Nations.\r\nIn a few weeks, Burkina Faso will host the tenth\r\nSummit of la Francophonie under the theme of “La\r\nFrancophonie: a united community that supports\r\nsustainable development”. That theme is meant to\r\nremind the francophone family — and, indeed, all of\r\nhumanity — that only sustainable, united development\r\nof the entire planet constitutes the best response for\r\nensuring international peace and security. The\r\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie thus\r\nadopts one of the Millennium Development Goals that\r\nis a key objective of the United Nations: to promote\r\nsustainable development for our world, which is the\r\nonly way to discourage conflicts forever and to ensure\r\ninternational peace.\r\nThis is not the first example of the commitment\r\nof the Organization of la Francophonie to issues at the\r\nheart of United Nations concerns. In fact, since its\r\ncreation the Organization of la Francophonie has\r\nundertaken several initiatives in cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations, all of which have promoted greater\r\nrapprochement among peoples and assisted in the daily\r\nstruggle for the well-being of humanity. One example\r\nof such cooperation deserving of encouragement is the\r\nObserver Mission of the Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie to the United Nations, which should be\r\ncommended for its efforts to further strengthen and\r\ngive greater importance to those relations.\r\nWe must recognize that regional organizations\r\nprovide an ideal springboard for achieving the goals of\r\nthe United Nations. In that spirit, my delegation\r\nsincerely hopes that the draft resolutions submitted in\r\nthe context of agenda item 56 to enhance this kind of\r\npartnership will be adopted by consensus.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call upon the\r\nrepresentative of Congo to speak on behalf of the\r\nEconomic Community of Central African States.\r\nMr. Ikouebe (Congo) (spoke in French): It is my\r\nhonour today to address the General Assembly on item\r\n56 (g), cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nEconomic Community of Central African States\r\n(ECCAS), a community that groups the following 11\r\ncountries of Central Africa: Angola, Burundi,\r\nCameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, the Central\r\nAfrican Republic, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Chad and my\r\ncountry, the Congo, which is the current Chair of the\r\nsubregional organization.\r\nFirst, let me emphasize the great interest and\r\nimportance my delegation attaches to this debate on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations, which is an expression of the necessary\r\ninteraction among all entities that must work together\r\nto build peace, settle conflicts and promote all aspects\r\nof development.\r\nIn associating myself with the statement made by\r\nNigeria on behalf of the African Union, I would like to\r\nreaffirm our continent’s gratitude to the international\r\ncommunity, in particular the United Nations system,\r\nfor the support given to Africa in its efforts for peace,\r\nsecurity and development.\r\nForty-eight hours ago, in this very Hall, we\r\nparticipated in a debate on international support for the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development, a\r\nprogramme that gives a major role to the African\r\nregions, in particular the economic communities. Thus,\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nI shall speak about one of those communities — the\r\nEconomic Community of Central African States.\r\nWith respect to cooperation between the United\r\nNations and ECCAS, I would first like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his excellent report on this\r\nquestion (A/59/303) and reaffirm our commitment to\r\nstrengthening the partnership between the United\r\nNations and our subregional organization, especially at a\r\ntime when the geopolitical situation is developing in a\r\npositive direction in a subregion that only yesterday was\r\nconsidered to be one of the most troubled in Africa.\r\nThe multidisciplinary mission that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral sent to our region from 8 to 22 June 2003 opened\r\nup many perspectives. We await with great interest\r\nimplementation of the relevant recommendations\r\ncontained in the report issued following that mission.\r\nLast January’s ECAAS Summit in Brazzaville focused\r\nparticularly on those recommendations and entrusted\r\nthe head of State of the Congo with pursuing steps with\r\nthe Secretary-General to establish a permanent United\r\nNations office in Central Africa. The office would be a\r\nstrong political presence, aimed at strengthening that\r\npartnership and promoting a comprehensive and\r\nintegrated approach to the problems of peace, security\r\nand development in the subregion. In that context, we\r\nwelcome the response of the Secretary-General, who\r\nhas committed himself to undertaking an intensive\r\nstudy to assess thoroughly all aspects of this question.\r\nIt was in that spirit that the Brazzaville Summit\r\nwelcomed the preparations for the international\r\nconference on the Great Lakes and expressed its hope\r\nthat all ECCAS members would be fully involved in it.\r\nToday, a few weeks before the convening of the\r\nconference in Dar es Salaam on 19 and 20 November,\r\nwe welcome the fact that all countries neighbouring the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, a State\r\nstrategically located at the heart of the problem area,\r\nhave been invited to participate fully in that meeting,\r\nwhich should open up new horizons for coexistence\r\nand cooperation in that region. We place great hopes in\r\nthat long-awaited meeting, and we wish to assure the\r\nUnited Nations and the African Union, the co-\r\norganizers of the event, of our commitment and that we\r\nwill make our most positive contribution.\r\nAs was underlined in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, and in the light of the conclusions presented\r\nby the multidisciplinary mission that I have just\r\nmentioned, several areas provide a reference\r\nframework for cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand ECCAS. I shall cite only a few of urgent concern for\r\nour Governments as they seek to strengthen subregional\r\nintegration and to make existing mechanisms effective.\r\nFirst, assistance is required to ensure the proper\r\nfunctioning of our system for collective security: the\r\nCouncil for Peace and Security in Central Africa and\r\nits support organs, the Central African early warning\r\nsystem and the Multinational Force for Central Africa.\r\nWe also await assistance in planning and equipment\r\nfor organizing joint military exercises to carry out a\r\nsimulation of peacekeeping operations. After the success\r\nof the first joint exercise, known as Biyongho 2003,\r\norganized at Franceville, Gabon, in the presence of a\r\nmilitary adviser of the United Nations Department of\r\nPeacekeeping Operations and with the participation of\r\nmilitary contingents of the subregion, we plan to repeat\r\nthat experience in Chad in 2005 and hope for substantial\r\nassistance from the international community.\r\nIn our efforts to create a free-trade zone, we are\r\ncounting on the support of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, which could assist us in\r\nstrengthening the free movement aspect of our project\r\nfor integration.\r\nIn many countries of the subregion, there is a\r\nneed to implement disarmament, demobilization and\r\nreintegration programmes to consolidate the peace\r\nprocesses under way.\r\nFinally, the battle against poverty, HIV/AIDS and\r\nmalaria is a priority that gained the attention of the\r\nmultidisciplinary mission and that should receive\r\nincreased support of the international community, in\r\nparticular the United Nations system.\r\nWith respect to the aforementioned areas for\r\ncooperation, we can conclude that Central Africa\r\nexpects a great deal from the United Nations, which\r\nhas already provided it with two instruments necessary\r\nfor its integration strategy: the United Nations Standing\r\nAdvisory Committee on Security Questions in Central\r\nAfrica, which for us is the appropriate framework for\r\ncooperative action, and the Subregional Centre for\r\nHuman Rights and Democracy in Central Africa. We\r\nbelieve that continued support for those two bodies, as\r\nwell as technical, material and financial assistance to\r\nthe secretariat of the Economic Community of Central\r\nAfrican States, will strengthen the partnership between\r\nthe United Nations and our region.\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nIn conclusion, it is on the basis of the experience\r\ngained within the framework of cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations, and in view of the numerous challenges\r\nthat remain to be met, that we are submitting a draft\r\nresolution designed to strengthen the partnership\r\nbetween the United Nations and our community. We\r\nhope that this text will have the backing of all Member\r\nStates, so that such international consensus can serve to\r\nencourage us to move forward and make progress.\r\nMr. Samy (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Chapter\r\nVIII of the Charter of the United Nations lays the\r\ngroundwork for cooperation between international and\r\nregional organizations in the area of peacekeeping and\r\ninternational security. Experience has shown the need\r\nto strengthen such cooperation to include economic\r\nand social development in the developing countries.\r\nHere Egypt would like to cite several examples of\r\nand frameworks for the importance of dynamic and\r\ncoordinated interaction between the United Nations\r\nand the regional organizations while emphasizing the\r\nspecific nature and scope of the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations and of regional organizations.\r\nLet me begin with Africa. I cannot overstate the\r\nimportance of cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional and subregional organizations in\r\nstrengthening peace, security and stability on the\r\ncontinent. The development of the relationship\r\nbetween the Security Council and regional\r\norganizations is of particular importance. It is clear that\r\nthe peoples and States involved in a given conflict in a\r\nparticular region are in the best position to have a more\r\ncomprehensive and in-depth understanding of the\r\nissue. African regional and subregional organizations\r\nare therefore likely to come up with important and\r\ninnovative ideas to find the most appropriate\r\nframework for a lasting political settlement.\r\nThe most interesting aspect of these\r\ndevelopments is the variety of relationships between\r\nthe United Nations, the African Union and subregional\r\norganizations. The African organizations and the\r\nUnited Nations have participated side by side in\r\npolitical mechanisms designed to implement peace\r\nagreements in transitional stages. We have also seen\r\nthe smooth transformation of the peacekeeping forces\r\nof the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) and of the African Union under the\r\numbrella of two United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations — in Côte d’Ivoire and in Burundi.\r\nThe African countries have shown a strong sense\r\nof responsibility in coping with armed conflicts that\r\nhave tribal, ethnic or other political aspects within their\r\nStates. Indeed, the contribution of ECOWAS was\r\nimportant and effective in coping with the emerging\r\nconflicts in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire at\r\nthe political and security levels.\r\nThe Inter-Government Authority on Development\r\nhas also played an extremely important role in the\r\npeace process in Somalia and in the Sudan, with\r\nconcrete assistance from the League of Arab States.\r\nThe African Union has shouldered important\r\nresponsibilities in peacekeeping in Burundi and is now\r\ndefining the central role which will be given it in the\r\nSudan, Somalia and elsewhere.\r\nThe multidimensional contribution of Africa must\r\ntake place within the context of a genuine interaction\r\nbetween the Security Council and regional and\r\nsubregional African organizations, in order further to\r\ndevelop effectively the relationship between the United\r\nNations and those organizations. To enhance the\r\neffectiveness of the process, we will be asking the\r\nSecurity Council to tackle conflicts around the world at\r\na subregional level, pinpointing the causes of conflicts\r\nwhile transcending narrow political interests or\r\nconsiderations.\r\nWe hope that the United Nations, through its\r\nthree major bodies, will devise the means to bring\r\nabout peace and security in Africa on the basis of the\r\nInternational Conference on Peace, Security,\r\nDemocracy and Development for the Great Lakes and\r\nby dealing effectively and constructively with the\r\nproblems in the Sudan and Somalia in East Africa.\r\nIn discussing the importance of strengthening\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nand subregional organizations, we must recall the\r\nspecial and historical ties that bind the United Nations\r\nand the League of Arab States. The two organizations\r\nhave all along faced similar historical, economic,\r\npolitical and social challenges. Egypt has coped, and\r\ncontinues to cope, with important international\r\nresponsibilities in order to strengthen the role of the\r\nArab League and enable it to attain its objectives.\r\nHere we would emphasize the need to strengthen\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nLeague of Arab States at all levels, in particular in the\r\npolitical, social and economic areas. The objectives of\r\nsuch strengthened cooperation are the maintenance of\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nregional and international peace and security; full and\r\nlasting respect for the principles of the Charter and of\r\nprovisions of international law; and support for\r\ndisarmament efforts, decolonization and the right to\r\nself-determination of peoples under foreign\r\noccupation, in particular the right of the Palestinian\r\npeople to self-determination and to the establishment\r\nof an independent State.\r\nEgypt, which has the honour of hosting the\r\nLeague of Arab States, wishes to urge the greatest\r\npossible support for the role played by the League of\r\nArab States. There is no doubt that the responsibility of\r\nthe members of the League and of its secretariat is\r\nextremely important, given present circumstances and\r\nthe serious challenges facing it.\r\nIn that respect, Egypt hopes to obtain the support\r\nof Member States for the draft resolution that has been\r\nsubmitted on the strengthening of cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the League of Arab States.\r\nAllow me to mention another framework of\r\ninteraction with the Organization in the context of\r\ncooperation between the developing countries and the\r\nUnited Nations — the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Organization (AALCO). For nearly five\r\ndecades now, that organization has been playing a key\r\nrole in strengthening cooperation between African and\r\nAsian countries in the area of international law. Its\r\ninitiatives have been favourably received at various\r\nUnited Nations conferences, in particular those dealing\r\nwith treaty rights and the law of the sea. That\r\norganization has made a specific contribution to efforts\r\nto achieve an international global regime that is based\r\non equality and equity among States.\r\nDuring its fortieth session in the year 2000, the\r\norganization recognized the Bangkok Principles on the\r\nstatus and treatment of refugees. It also defined the\r\nshared interests of African and Asian countries on a\r\nnumber of recent relevant issues under consideration\r\nby the United Nations and other international\r\norganizations with which it has concluded cooperative\r\nagreements on various aspects of international law.\r\nThat has allowed it to make a contribution to the\r\ncreation of a global legal regime that is equitable and\r\nbased on the principles of equality and cooperation in\r\ninternational relations.\r\nIt should be noted that AALCO has set itself the\r\ntask of making its expertise available to the States of\r\nAsia and Africa and to supply them, on request,\r\nadvisory services in the area of international law.\r\nWe would like to stress Egypt’s gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General and to the Secretariat and staff\r\nmembers for their efforts to enable the Organization to\r\nfulfil its mission and develop and modernize its\r\nmethods of work. Egypt would like also to urge\r\nmembers to adopt the draft resolution contained in\r\ndraft resolution A/59/L.1 on cooperation between the\r\nAsian-African Legal Consultative Organization and the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish to emphasize the need for\r\nan increased awareness of the fact that there exists a\r\nshared set of values and customs that are universally\r\nrecognized, as expressed in the Charter and in\r\ninternational conventions of the United Nations\r\nsystem. That is why we emphasize the fact that, while\r\nit is important to strengthen cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations at all levels,\r\nnevertheless the particular values of each country make\r\nit impossible to impose specific regional values on all\r\nMembers of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Butagira (Uganda): I thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report (A/59/303) on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nand other organizations. In my statement, I will confine\r\nmyself to a few areas of the report.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the strengthened and\r\ndynamic cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe African Union (AU) — in particular the AU Peace\r\nand Security Council — in various fields. The African\r\nUnion has established a standby force to deal with\r\nconflicts on the continent. More resources, in the form\r\nof logistics, will be required to make that force\r\neffective, and the United Nations can play a vital role\r\nin mobilizing the necessary resources. The AU has\r\nassumed ownership of conflict resolution on the\r\ncontinent. However, it should be stressed that the\r\nprimary responsibility for international peace and\r\nsecurity still rests with Security Council. Therefore, the\r\nAU’s involvement should not mean abdication; there\r\nshould be complementarities.\r\nThe Office of the Special Adviser on Africa\r\nshould be strengthened by staffing it with highly\r\nqualified and experienced people so that it can play an\r\neffective role as an advocate for increased assistance to\r\nAfrica, especially in the economic field. The Office\r\nshould also help in various capacity-building efforts\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nundertaken by the African Union. The United Nations\r\nhas helped to mainstream programmes of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development into national\r\npoverty reduction strategy papers. My delegation\r\ncommends the Special Adviser, Mr. Ibrahim Gambari,\r\nfor his tireless efforts in that direction.\r\nThe United Nations should also strengthen the\r\nrole of the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) Resident Coordinator at the country level by\r\nproviding his office with adequate financial resources.\r\nThere should be more coordination and harmonization\r\namong the various United Nations agencies represented\r\nat the country level, under the overall coordination of\r\nthe UNDP Resident Coordinator. Civil society actors\r\nshould also be involved in an advisory capacity in the\r\nwork of United Nations agencies and of Governments.\r\nThe Secretary-General initiated meetings with\r\nheads of regional organizations in 1994 to discuss\r\nthematic topics such as poverty, organized crime and\r\npeace and security. The outcomes of those meetings\r\nhave contributed to the success of the work of the\r\nUnited Nations in those fields. My delegation\r\ncommends that initiative and would like it extended to\r\nthe regional heads of the East African Community.\r\nThat organization was granted observer status in the\r\nGeneral Assembly last year. For the moment, the\r\nCommunity consists of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda;\r\nRwanda and Burundi are about to join. It is pursuing\r\nregional integration in all fields — the economic; the\r\npolitical, including the coordination of defence policy;\r\nthe cultural and others. In such a dynamic institution,\r\nthe United Nations has a strong and reliable partner\r\nwith which to attain its goals.\r\nMoreover, the United Nations should enhance its\r\nworking relationship with the Intergovernmental\r\nAuthority on Development (IGAD). Already, that\r\norganization is playing a vital role in the conflict\r\nresolution area with regard to the Sudan and Somalia\r\npeace talks. We expect a greater United Nations role in\r\npost-conflict peace-building and reconstruction,\r\nespecially in the wake of the recent successful\r\nconclusion of the Somalia peace talks in Nairobi. More\r\nshould be done to expedite the peace talks between the\r\nGovernment of the Sudan and the Sudanese People’s\r\nLiberation Army and Movement. The peace dividend\r\nin the southern Sudan will have a welcome ripple\r\neffect in Uganda.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the cooperation between\r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and the United\r\nNations. The importance of involving parliamentarians\r\nin the work of the United Nations can hardly be\r\noveremphasized. Such cooperation was strengthened\r\nwhen IPU was granted observer status by General\r\nAssembly resolution 57/32 of 19 November 2002.\r\nParliaments, by internalizing the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, can play an important role in their\r\nimplementation. This would also be true of the\r\noutcomes of major United Nations conferences such as\r\nthe Monterrey Consensus.\r\nVery often, parliamentarians scrutinize international\r\nagreements and conventions before they are\r\n“domesticated” as municipal laws. It is therefore\r\nimportant to include parliamentarians both in\r\ngovernmental delegations to the General Assembly and\r\nin delegations negotiating multilateral treaties. In that\r\nway, parliamentarians would be meaningfully involved\r\nin the work of the United Nations. My delegation\r\nwelcomes the annual parliamentary hearings at United\r\nNations Headquarters in New York as yet another\r\nuseful forum for cooperation between the IPU and the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Sawar (Pakistan): This statement deals with\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization (ECO). I shall\r\nalso take this opportunity to speak about future\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the South\r\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).\r\nPakistan has the privilege of being a founding member\r\nof all three of those organizations.\r\nThe Organization of the Islamic Conference is\r\none of the largest intergovernmental organizations. Its\r\n57 members and three observer States come from Asia,\r\nAfrica and Europe. As the collective voice of the\r\nMuslim world, the OIC has been engaged over the\r\nyears in a constructive and cooperative relationship\r\nwith the United Nations, reinforcing common efforts in\r\npursuit of peace and development.\r\nThe OIC has endeavoured to promote better\r\nunderstanding and dialogue among various\r\ncivilizations and cultures. It has undertaken significant\r\nmeasures aimed at fostering peace, promoting social\r\nand economic development, combating ethnic or racial\r\nintolerance and seeking an end to the causes of\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\ninjustice and instability, which are constant threats to\r\nworld peace and security.\r\nIn the aftermath of the tragic events of\r\n11 September 2001, the Islamic world, under the\r\nauspices of the OIC, joined the international\r\ncommunity in our common fight against international\r\nterrorism. The OIC has been emphatic in its\r\ncondemnation of terrorism; it has adopted a convention\r\naimed at dealing with that scourge. The Convention\r\nprovides a comprehensive framework for dealing with\r\nthis problem while upholding the Charter’s cardinal\r\nprinciple of self-determination, and acknowledges the\r\nlegitimacy of freedom struggles against foreign\r\noccupation and alien domination.\r\nWe are pleased to refer to the report of the\r\nSecretary-General (A/59/303), which recapitulates the\r\nprogress achieved during the past year by the United\r\nNations system and the OIC in promoting their shared\r\ngoals of international peace and security and\r\ndevelopment. We welcome the effective contacts and\r\nconsultations that the two organizations have\r\nmaintained over the past several years.\r\nThe two organizations have regularly interacted\r\non a number of political issues, and their mutually\r\nsupportive role and determination to promote\r\nnegotiations to resolve conflict continue to receive\r\nwide international support. Representatives from the\r\nUnited Nations attended the Tenth Session of the\r\nIslamic Summit Conference in Malaysia in 2003 and\r\nthe Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers held in\r\nTehran and Istanbul in 2003 and 2004, respectively. We\r\nwould like to see the two organizations work more\r\nclosely in addressing and resolving some of the\r\nconflicts in the Muslim world, including Palestine,\r\nIraq, Afghanistan and Kashmir. More work needs to be\r\ndone by all concerned to address the root causes of\r\nthese conflicts and to promote justice and peace.\r\nWe are of the view that the two parties should\r\ncontinue to examine ways and means of further\r\nexpanding and diversifying their cooperation by\r\nidentifying new areas. We welcome the meeting held in\r\nVienna in July 2004, which identified several proposals\r\nfor joint projects between the United Nations and the\r\nOIC. Cooperation between the two organizations has\r\ntaken place on numerous occasions in the past, and we\r\nwould like to encourage the regularization of this\r\ntrend, with at least one general meeting of\r\nrepresentatives of the United Nations Secretariat and\r\nthe OIC each year. This formal interaction will further\r\nenhance cooperation between the two organizations.\r\nPakistan has the proud privilege of chairing one\r\nof the two main committees of the OIC, namely the\r\nStanding Committee on Scientific and Technological\r\nCooperation. The Pakistan-based Committee is\r\nresponsible for promoting cooperation in the field of\r\nscience and technology among the Muslim countries.\r\nPakistan is also host to the Islamic Chamber of\r\nCommerce and Industry.\r\nThe Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO)\r\nis another major regional cooperation organization\r\nseeking to promote the socio-economic development of\r\nits member States on the basis of their common needs\r\nand in keeping with the challenges on the global\r\neconomic scene. The organization was founded by\r\nPakistan, Iran and Turkey as the successor to the\r\nRegional Cooperation for Development organization.\r\nIn 1992, it was expanded to include Afghanistan and\r\nthe newly established Central Asian States of\r\nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan\r\nand Tajikistan, as well as Azerbaijan.\r\nThe ECO has played an important role in\r\nstrengthening and promoting multidimensional\r\nregional economic cooperation among its member\r\ncountries. It has identified four priority areas for\r\nintense regional cooperation, namely, trade, transport,\r\ncommunication and energy. The project-oriented\r\nAlmaty Outline Plan underscores the importance that\r\nECO member States attach to the development of the\r\ntransport and communications infrastructure linking\r\nthe ECO member States with one another and with the\r\noutside world. The conclusion of two important\r\nagreements — the ECO Transit Trade Agreement and\r\nthe Transit Transport Framework Agreement — has\r\ngiven further impetus to the expansion of regional\r\ntrade and economic cooperation.\r\nThe ECO region covers territory of more than 7\r\nmillion square kilometres with a population of nearly\r\n350 million people. The region has immense natural\r\nresources, and its members have the political will to\r\ntap those resources for the mutual advantage of all. The\r\npresidential elections in Afghanistan constitute an\r\nimportant landmark in the peace process and augur\r\nwell for peace and stability in Afghanistan. Peace and\r\nstability in Afghanistan need to be bolstered by socio-\r\neconomic development and the integration of the\r\nAfghan economy with those of its neighbours.\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nThe Economic Cooperation Organization can serve\r\nas a vehicle not only for the post-war reconstruction of\r\nAfghanistan, but also for the development and\r\nintegration of the economies of the region, which have\r\nborne the brunt of the conflict in Afghanistan.\r\nThe ECO already has in place the blueprints for\r\nthe region-wide development of transport and\r\ncommunications infrastructure, facilities for trade and\r\ninvestment, banking and insurance, culture and\r\neducation and the effective use of the region’s vast\r\nenergy resources. We expect the United Nations system\r\nand the international community to support the efforts\r\nof the ECO and its member States in order to realize\r\nthese blueprints, for the benefit not only of the region\r\nbut also of the world at large.\r\nThe South Asian Association for Regional\r\nCooperation (SAARC), representing the seven\r\ncountries of South Asia — Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,\r\nMaldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka — was\r\nlaunched in Dhaka in December 1985 at the first-ever\r\nSummit Meeting of the South Asian Heads of State or\r\nGovernment. SAARC seeks to promote the welfare of\r\nthe peoples of South Asia and to improve their quality\r\nof life by accelerating economic growth, social\r\nprogress and cultural development in the region.\r\nSAARC also aims at strengthening cooperation with\r\nother developing countries and with international and\r\nregional organizations with similar aims and objectives.\r\nThe highest authority of the Association rests\r\nwith the SAARC heads of State or Government, who\r\nmeet annually at the summit level. To date, 12 summits\r\nhave been held. The twelfth SAARC Summit, held in\r\nIslamabad in January 2004, raised hopes and opened up\r\nnew avenues for regional cooperation among the South\r\nAsian countries. SAARC member States are\r\ndeveloping modalities for dialogue partnerships with\r\nother regions. SAARC countries have also decided to\r\nseek observer status in the United Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express our hope\r\nand confidence that United Nations cooperation with\r\nboth the OIC and the ECO will continue to flourish, to\r\nthe mutual benefit of the three organizations. We also\r\nhope that a new chapter will soon begin in the\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and SAARC.\r\nPakistan, as a proud member of the United Nations, the\r\nOIC, the ECO and SAARC, will remain actively\r\ninvolved in the work of all four organizations.\r\nMs. Napoli (Italy) (spoke in Italian; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): Allow me, first of all, to\r\nreiterate Italy’s heartfelt support for the action that the\r\nEuropean Union (EU) has been undertaking for some\r\ntime now to strengthen cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the national parliaments of Member States,\r\nwhich are brought together in their international\r\nassembly, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU).\r\nIn line with the orientations of the EU, Italy\r\ndevotes great attention to that issue, including at the\r\nnational level. That is illustrated by the fact that my\r\ncountry has decided to become a sponsor of the draft\r\nresolution presented by Chile on the question of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the IPU.\r\nThe draft constitutes another major step towards more\r\nintense cooperation between our two organizations.\r\nThe foundations of that cooperation were established by\r\nthe 1996 cooperation agreement and were significantly\r\nenhanced by resolution 57/32, of 19 November 2002,\r\nwhereby the IPU was granted observer status in the\r\nwork of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation believes that our common efforts\r\naimed at forging a true, productive partnership between\r\nthe United Nations and the IPU have produced\r\nimportant results in recent years. However, work needs\r\nto be done to ensure that the achievements we have\r\nmade will provide the basis for further progress. In that\r\nregard, I wish to recall the recent adoption by the IPU\r\nExecutive Committee of a document that identified the\r\npriority areas on which to focus cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations in the next few years. Italian\r\nparliamentarians worked hard to achieve that outcome,\r\nwhich will make it possible to better structure the\r\nIPU’s contribution to the work of the United Nations.\r\nThe IPU has an important role to play in ensuring\r\nthat members of parliaments throughout the world\r\nrealize the importance of United Nations peacekeeping,\r\nas well as the enormous political, logistical and\r\nfinancial challenges peacekeeping entails.\r\nParliamentarians can encourage the Governments of\r\nMember States to help the Organization to overcome\r\nshortfalls in commitment and equipment, thereby\r\nsupporting the peace processes in countries where\r\npeacekeeping operations have been deployed.\r\nMoreover, I am pleased to note that, in the\r\nconclusions contained in his report on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the IPU, Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan recognized the role that the IPU\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nplays in contributing to reaching the main objectives of\r\nthe international community, and hoped for more\r\nsystematic involvement on the part of parliamentarians,\r\nparliaments and the IPU in the activities of the United\r\nNations. Many of the recommendations contained in\r\nthe report of the Panel of Eminent Persons on United\r\nNations-Civil Society Relations — the so-called\r\nCardoso Panel — took that same approach.\r\nOn that last point, it is nonetheless important to\r\nspecify clearly that the establishment of inter-\r\nparliamentary mechanisms and structures in the\r\nframework of an inter-governmental organization such\r\nas the United Nations must include strict respect for\r\nthe principles of independence and separation of\r\npowers, and that it is necessary to avoid useless\r\nduplication of mechanisms that already exist in the IPU\r\nframework. Those features of the Cardoso Panel’s\r\nrecommendations were the subject of talks between the\r\nIPU President, Secretary-General Kofi Annan and\r\nFernando Cardoso, Chairman of the Panel of Eminent\r\nPersons. Consultations in that regard are under way\r\nwith the presidents of various national parliaments.\r\nThe President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, The\r\nHonourable Pier Ferdinando Casini, has already\r\nparticipated in those meetings. He has, moreover,\r\npointed out that if we want public opinion to\r\nunderstand the United Nations, parliaments are, and\r\nremain, an irreplaceable filter, and the IPU can play a\r\ngreat role to that end.\r\nMy delegation believes that the second Conference\r\nof Presiding Officers of National Parliaments, which will\r\ntake place in September 2005, represents the most\r\nsuitable forum to convey to the United Nations the\r\nassessments of the world parliamentary community on\r\nsuch issues.\r\nIt is the firm conviction of my delegation that we\r\nmust maintain our commitment to further strengthening\r\nthe parliamentary dimension of international\r\ncooperation and the involvement of parliamentarians in\r\nthe activities of the United Nations. We believe that\r\nbecause that dimension, by virtue of the natural role of\r\nparliamentarians as a trait d’union between civil\r\nsociety and national Governments, can provide\r\nprecious added value to efforts aimed at attaining the\r\nobjectives of the United Nations with regard to the\r\ngreat issues of peace and security, economic and social\r\ndevelopment, international law and human rights, and\r\ndemocracy and equal opportunity. The Italian\r\nParliament and its members are ready, together with all\r\ntheir colleagues in the IPU, to meet that challenge with\r\nenthusiasm, as is undoubtedly the United Nations.\r\nMr. Pfanzelter (Austria): As a host country to\r\nthe United Nations and other international and regional\r\norganizations, Austria has always worked for closer\r\ninter-organizational dialogue, especially on the policy-\r\nmaking level. It has also been our policy to promote\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations in the field of peacekeeping.\r\nFor the past 35 years, Austria, together with the\r\nInternational Peace Academy, has organized annual\r\nseminars in Vienna. This year, representatives of\r\nAfrica, the European Union and the United Nations\r\ndiscussed peace operations in Africa. In 2005, we plan to\r\ndiscuss peacekeeping partnerships in Africa, with special\r\nemphasis on cooperation between the European Union\r\nand the United Nations. We are convinced that those\r\nseminars will continue to make a useful contribution to\r\nimproving inter-organizational cooperation, and we\r\nintend to keep the focus of the seminar on Africa.\r\nI should like to make a few remarks on the\r\ncooperation of the United Nations with the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE), the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nOrganization (CTBTO), the Council of Europe and the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union.\r\nLet me turn first to the OSCE. Next year will\r\nmark the thirtieth anniversary of the Helsinki Final\r\nAct. We are proud to host the OSCE, the only\r\ninclusive, multidimensional forum for comprehensive\r\npolitical and security dialogue which brings together\r\n55 States, from Vancouver to Vladivostok.\r\nToday’s threats to security and stability are of\r\nsuch a complex and diverse nature that no single\r\ninstitution or country is able to combat them\r\neffectively alone. The OSCE and the United Nations\r\nhave always been close partners in efforts to promote\r\nhuman rights, democracy and peace. That is\r\nparticularly true of the work of both organizations in\r\nthe field. The OSCE is making an important\r\ncontribution as an essential part of the United Nations\r\nInterim Administration in Kosovo, in particular for\r\ncapacity- and institution-building in the field of\r\ndemocratization, human rights and the rule of law, as\r\nwell as in the area of basic and advanced training for a\r\nmulti-ethnic, community-based Kosovo Police Service.\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nThere is also cooperation between the OSCE in\r\nAbkhazia and in South Ossetia. The role of the OSCE\r\nin elections support and monitoring, most recently in\r\nAfghanistan, and in preparing the Kosovo Assembly\r\nelections is another example.\r\nCounter-terrorism and the fight against\r\ntrafficking in human beings are priority activities of the\r\nOSCE. It works very closely with the United Nations\r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime in promoting and\r\nimplementing the 12 universal terrorism-related\r\nconventions and protocols.\r\nSecondly, turning to the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty Organization, let me say that the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) has\r\nbeen one of Austria’s main priorities in the field of\r\ndisarmament since the Treaty was opened for signature\r\neight years ago, in 1996. As the host country for the\r\nPreparatory Commission for the CTBTO, Austria has\r\nassumed a special responsibility for the successful\r\npreparation for the entry into force of the CTBT.\r\nSince the provisional technical secretariat of the\r\nCTBTO Preparatory Commission took up its work at\r\nthe Vienna International Centre in 1997 under the\r\nleadership of Executive Secretary Wolfgang Hoffman,\r\nmuch progress has been achieved. The impressive\r\nnumber of signatures and ratifications demonstrates the\r\ngrowing support for that Treaty. A total of 173 States\r\nhave signed, and 119 States have deposited their\r\ninstruments of ratification. Unfortunately, the number\r\nof States whose ratification is required for the CTBT’s\r\nentry into force stagnates at 33. We must therefore\r\nintensify our efforts to convince those countries to\r\nratify the Treaty.\r\nIn that context, Austria welcomes the joint\r\nministerial statement of 23 September in support of the\r\nCTBT.\r\nThirdly, with respect to the Council of Europe,\r\nAustria appreciates the high quality of the cooperation\r\nof the United Nations with the Council of Europe and\r\nsupports the ongoing work involving the Council of\r\nEurope and the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights as well as the Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees, both of which cover areas which are dealt\r\nwith at the regional level by the Council of Europe. I\r\nam confident that the States Members of the United\r\nNations and the States members of the Council of\r\nEurope will continue to support and intensify dialogue\r\nbetween the two organizations.\r\nFourthly, concerning the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion, two years ago Austria supported the resolution\r\non cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union and the observer status of\r\nthe IPU. By including the IPU in its debate, the\r\nGeneral Assembly acknowledges the voices of the\r\nelected representatives and the fact that it will benefit\r\nfrom their valuable contributions and gain additional\r\ndemocratic legitimacy. Austria therefore welcomes the\r\nstrengthening of the cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union and\r\nsupports this year’s draft resolution on the IPU.\r\nMr. Mabhongo (South Africa): My delegation\r\nwelcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nagenda item entitled “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional and other organizations”,\r\ncontained in document A/59/303. We hope that this\r\ndebate will help us in our joint efforts to review our\r\nachievements and also inform decisions on future\r\ncooperation.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement\r\nmade by Mr. Abubakar Tanko, Minister of State for\r\nForeign Affairs of Nigeria, in his capacity as current\r\nChairperson of the African Union.\r\nWe have observed the remarkable development of\r\nthe cooperation between the African Union and the\r\nUnited Nations, which has resulted in a number of\r\npositive developments that have been important in the\r\nevolution of the African Union. We commend the\r\ndevelopments that have taken place during the period\r\nunder review. We wish in particular to note the\r\nfollowing.\r\nLet me turn first to the establishment of the\r\nOffice of the Special Adviser on Africa. Since its\r\nestablishment, the head of that Office has participated\r\nin a series of meetings organized by the Chairperson of\r\nthe African Union, thereby contributing to the\r\nformulation of the vision and strategic framework of\r\nthe African Union.\r\nIn addition, the Office has held discussions with\r\nthe African Union on a project to monitor capacity-\r\nbuilding efforts that will enable African countries to\r\nrespond effectively to conflicts.\r\nThe United Nations hosted a training programme\r\non the drafting of the Protocol relating to the\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nestablishment of the Peace and Security Council of the\r\nAfrican Union together with its rules of procedure. The\r\nPeace and Security Council was officially launched in\r\nAddis Ababa in May 2004.\r\nCommendable work has also been done in the\r\nfollowing areas: the provision of ongoing support in\r\nthe area of HIV/AIDS to the African Union; the\r\nestablishment of a World Food Programme liaison\r\noffice to the African Union; the operationalization of\r\nthe third phase of the support provided by the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) to the Peace\r\nand Security Directorate of the African Union; and the\r\nprovision of public information services to the African\r\ncontinent.\r\nThe United Nations has also contributed to the\r\nstrengthening of the structures of the African Union.\r\nWe are proud of this and of the other forms of support\r\nprovided by the United Nations to our continental\r\norganization. We believe that the strengthening of the\r\nstructures of the African Union will give it the capacity\r\nit needs to address the challenges facing our continent.\r\nWe are encouraged to note that more African\r\ncountries are joining the African Peer Review\r\nMechanism — a voluntary self-evaluation mechanism.\r\nThe recent launch of the Pan-African Parliament in\r\nJohannesburg, South Africa, in September 2004, heralded\r\nthe dawn of a new era on the African continent. We are\r\npleased that the first speaker of this important body is a\r\nwoman. This and the allocation of 50 per cent of the\r\ncommissioner posts of the African Union to women are\r\nan indication of the determination of African leaders to\r\npromote the empowerment of women.\r\nWe believe that our debate today should not only\r\nfocus on our achievements, but also help us jointly to\r\nidentify areas that need further improvement. In this\r\nregard, I wish to refer to the integrated socio-economic\r\nprogramme for the development of Africa, the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).\r\nThrough NEPAD we hope to confront the challenges of\r\npoverty and underdevelopment in our continent. A\r\nnumber of important pledges to provide resources to\r\nNEPAD have been made. Unfortunately, those pledges\r\nhave not yet been fulfilled. We note the role of the\r\nOffice of the Special Adviser on Africa in advocating\r\nin favour of NEPAD. We hope that this Office will\r\ncontinue to promote the provision of resources for the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD programmes.\r\nAfrica is still faced with several conflict\r\nsituations which hinder progress towards peace and\r\nprosperity. We believe that the Peace and Security\r\nCouncil of the African Union will be a useful tool to\r\npromote cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe African Union in the area of conflict prevention\r\nand resolution.\r\nThe African Union has demonstrated its\r\nwillingness to tackle issues of conflict on the continent\r\nin support of the United Nations through the\r\ndeployment of forces in new and expanding\r\npeacekeeping activities, within both the United Nations\r\ncontext and the regional framework. To enhance its\r\nregional framework, the African Union is also in the\r\nprocess of establishing its own regional African\r\nStandby Force.\r\nIn conclusion, while there is a clear\r\ndemonstration of political will on the part of African\r\nleaders to confront the challenges facing our continent,\r\nthe African Union still faces a shortage of financial and\r\ntechnical resources. We believe, therefore, that\r\nimproved cooperation with the United Nations can also\r\nhelp in this regard.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General (A/59/303)\r\nhas appropriately reflected the progress that has been\r\nmade by African subregional organizations. South\r\nAfrica will continue to contribute to the strengthening\r\nof the Southern African Development Community\r\n(SADC). The Summit of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of SADC took a decision that the\r\nCommunity should apply for observer status in the\r\nUnited Nations. We strongly believe that this is a\r\npositive step that will further enhance the existing\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and Africa.\r\nAs stated in the report of the Secretary-General, a\r\ndraft resolution sponsored by the Permanent Mission of\r\nMauritius in its capacity as Chair of SADC has been\r\nsubmitted to the United Nations Secretariat. We urge\r\nall countries to support this draft resolution when it is\r\npresented for action.\r\nMr. Pourgourides (Cyprus): Thank you,\r\nMr. President, for giving me the floor on this important\r\nagenda item concerning cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional and other organizations.\r\nThere is an increased need to intensify this cooperation\r\nin order to address the challenges facing the\r\ninternational community today.\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nFirst of all, I would like to align myself with the\r\nprevious speakers in expressing my delegation’s\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his report on\r\nagenda item 56.\r\nAs a member of the delegation of the Republic of\r\nCyprus to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council\r\nof Europe and Chairman of the Subcommittee on\r\nHuman Rights of the Assembly, I will focus on the\r\nrelationship between the Council of Europe and the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nI am pleased to note, as outlined in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s comprehensive report on the cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Council of Europe,\r\nthat there has been productive and fruitful cooperation\r\nbetween the two organizations in the period under\r\nreview.\r\nThe Council of Europe and the United Nations\r\nemerged at a similar point in history and share a\r\ncommon set of values and goals in promoting peace\r\nand prosperity and respect for the rule of law.\r\nCooperation between the two organizations is\r\nlongstanding, dating back to the creation of the Council\r\nin 1949. The United Nations and the Council of Europe\r\nare complementary and mutually reinforcing in their\r\nendeavours to protect and strengthen democracy,\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule\r\nof law. The two organizations both have long and\r\nnoteworthy experience in promoting peace and\r\ncontributing to conflict prevention, confidence-\r\nbuilding and long-term post-conflict peacebuilding in\r\nmany countries. Both organizations are particularly\r\ninvolved in the fight against discrimination, terrorism,\r\nracism and xenophobia and strive to promote equal\r\nopportunity and equal treatment for men and women in\r\norder to secure a better future, based on universally\r\nheld values and rights.\r\nThe protection of human rights is at the forefront\r\nof the Council of Europe’s work. The European\r\nConvention on Human Rights is one of the most\r\nsignificant and effective human rights treaties currently\r\nin force. It is mandatory for all member States of the\r\nCouncil of Europe, each of which has accepted the\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the European Court of\r\nHuman Rights.\r\nThe European Court of Human Rights provides\r\nan effective way of safeguarding the human rights of\r\nmillions of European citizens. Like all the other\r\nmember States of the Council of Europe, my country\r\nattaches great importance to the effective functioning\r\nof the Court, which has delivered some landmark\r\ndecisions on cases concerning human rights, including\r\ndecisions affecting Cyprus, such as the seminal\r\nLoizidou case.\r\nThis brings me to the crucial issue of the speedy\r\ndisposal of cases before the Court, as well as the\r\neffective implementation of its decisions, matters to\r\nwhich I am duty-bound to refer in my capacity as\r\nchairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights of the\r\nCouncil of Europe. The speedy disposal of cases and\r\nthe prompt execution of the judgements of the\r\nEuropean Court of Human Rights are essential to the\r\ncredibility and effectiveness of the European\r\nConvention on Human Rights as a constitutional\r\ninstrument of European public order that significantly\r\ncontributes to the democratic tradition of the continent.\r\nSmaller States, for which international legality is\r\nof utmost importance and which must rely heavily on\r\nthe full implementation of the decisions of the Court\r\nfor their protection, are particularly supportive of the\r\nrole of the European Court of Human Rights.\r\nThe Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of\r\nEurope is also very much interested in the reform\r\nprocess of the United Nations. To that end, we debated\r\nin our Assembly the report on strengthening the United\r\nNations and adopted Parliamentary Assembly\r\nresolution 1373 of 2004, which contains important\r\nproposals for strengthening the United Nations. Our\r\naim in the Parliamentary Assembly is to use all\r\navailable means at our disposal to assist in giving a\r\nparliamentary dimension to the world Organization.\r\nAs already stated, the Council of Europe is\r\npredominantly a human rights organization. We believe\r\nthat without respect for human rights, the world cannot\r\nenjoy peace and security. We in the Council of Europe,\r\nof course, share the United Nations concern for threats\r\nto international peace and security caused by terrorism,\r\nbut we strongly believe that the fight against terrorism\r\nmust be conducted in ways and with means that fully\r\nrespect human rights and fundamental freedoms. The\r\nfight against terrorism must never be allowed to\r\ndegenerate into torture and inhuman or degrading\r\ntreatment, the prohibition of which is absolute.\r\nIn July 2003, Protocol No. 13 to the European\r\nConvention on Human Rights entered into force. The\r\neffect of that historic protocol is to abolish the death\r\npenalty in all circumstances. The European continent,\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nwith one sad exception, no longer imposes the death\r\npenalty. We regard that as a great achievement. Both\r\nthe Parliamentary Assembly and the Committee of\r\nMinisters are currently engaged in an ongoing dialogue\r\nwith those observer States that retain the death penalty.\r\nIn the Council of Europe, we are also actively taking\r\nsteps against racism. We look forward to a continent\r\nfree of racial discrimination and are also working\r\nmethodically against the trafficking of human beings\r\nand for the effective protection of national minorities.\r\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that the Council of\r\nEurope and the United Nations can benefit mutually\r\nfrom one another’s work. The overlap existing on\r\nsubjects examined by the two organizations need not\r\nmean the repetition of the same work but, rather,\r\ncomplementarity and reinforcement in their respective\r\nfields of action. Especially with regard to promoting\r\npeace, stability and the rule of law, we believe that the\r\nalready close cooperation between the Council of\r\nEurope and the United Nations could and should be\r\nfurther enhanced.\r\nMr. Menon (Singapore): At the outset, my\r\ndelegation would like to thank and commend the\r\nSecretary-General for his excellent report on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nand other organizations (A/59/303), and for his\r\ninitiative in promoting such cooperation over the years.\r\nWe would also like to welcome the biennialization of\r\nthis agenda item and the consolidation of the\r\nSecretary-General’s reports into a single report.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report shows how wide-\r\nranging United Nations cooperation with regional and\r\nother organizations has been. In my own region, the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), an\r\norganization comprising 10 member States, has been\r\nbroadening and deepening its cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations. Details of this cooperation can be\r\nfound in the Secretary-General’s report and in the\r\nstatement delivered by the distinguished Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic on behalf of ASEAN, with which my\r\ndelegation fully associates itself.\r\nIt is also clear from the report that the United\r\nNations does not conduct the same cooperative\r\nactivities with each regional organization. To do so\r\nwould not make sense because every region has its own\r\nunique characteristics, priorities and needs, depending\r\non its philosophy and stage of development. The\r\ncultural and political diversity of different regions\r\nbrings a certain richness to the various cooperative\r\nactivities with the United Nations. We are all the better\r\nbecause of it. It is also interesting to learn from the draft\r\nresolutions initiated by different regional organizations\r\non this subject and the statements of various Member\r\nStates that the Assembly heard today, what they value\r\nin their cooperation with the United Nations.\r\nHowever, on the subject of draft resolutions, my\r\ndelegation is sad to observe that in recent years, some\r\ndraft resolutions on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations, instead of being\r\nadopted by consensus, are voted upon. To those who do\r\nnot know the background to such votes, it can create\r\nthe wrong impression that some Member States are\r\nopposed to United Nations cooperation with those\r\nregional organizations, when, in reality, there is no\r\nsuch opposition. The United Nations as a whole and its\r\ncomponent entities have always sought to work within\r\ntheir mandates.\r\nHaving said that, one would assume that those\r\ntabling the draft resolutions are proud of what their\r\nregional organizations are doing in cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations. In that regard, having a vote on a\r\ndraft resolution on cooperation with the United Nations\r\nis something that members of the regional\r\norganizations concerned should try to avoid. It is not\r\ndifficult to achieve a consensus draft resolution. All it\r\ntakes is to keep the text brief and focused on what\r\none’s regional organization values in its cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations, leaving contentious and\r\ndivisive issues aside, especially issues that do not\r\nenjoy an international consensus.\r\nWhy then do we keep seeing votes on some of\r\nthese draft resolutions? First, my delegation has\r\nobserved that some countries seem to believe that it is\r\nnatural for the General Assembly to endorse, pay\r\ntribute to, acknowledge or take note of certain values,\r\nstandards and practices of common cultural heritage\r\nwithin their regional organization of which they are\r\nparticularly proud. Those countries do not seem to\r\nunderstand that in an organization comprising\r\nMembers from all over the world, others of a different\r\nheritage do not necessarily share the same views on\r\nthose values, standards and practices. Sadly, some of\r\nthem would go so far as to insist on those elements,\r\neven after other countries have expressed concerns and\r\nreservations. Under those circumstances, for countries\r\nthat do not agree, the only way for them to express\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\ntheir reservations and concerns is to call for a vote on\r\nthe draft resolution or at least on the problematic\r\nelements of the draft.\r\nSecondly, my delegation has observed that some\r\ncountries seem to rare for the occasional fight, and,\r\nthanks to their creativity every year, certain divisive\r\nissues keep coming up in various forms in draft\r\nresolutions in the Main Committees and the plenary.\r\nThe unfortunate net result is to distract the Assembly’s\r\nattention from the important subjects in question and to\r\ndeny consensus on the relevant draft resolutions, as in\r\nthe case of the drafts on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations.\r\nIt is the fervent hope of my delegation that\r\nwisdom will prevail and that we will all recognize, for\r\nour common good, that there is a time and a place to\r\ndebate issues that are clearly divisive in a constructive\r\nmanner and that we will all recognize that scoring a\r\nvictory through a narrow vote on contentious issues,\r\nissues on which there is no international consensus, not\r\nonly achieves nothing but generates acrimony and\r\ndiscredits this institution that we all profess to cherish.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report (A/59/303), which describes\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Organization (AALCO).\r\nWe are pleased to see the ever-stronger relationship\r\nand the gradual expansion of cooperation between the\r\ntwo organizations.\r\nBorne out of the spirit of the Bandung\r\nConference, AALCO is the only intergovernmental\r\nlegal consultative institution in the Asian-African\r\nregion. Over the years, AALCO has closely followed\r\nthe latest developments in international law, carried out\r\nin-depth studies on international law issues of common\r\nconcern to its member States, provided advice on\r\ninternational law to its member States and provided\r\nthem with a forum for cooperation on legal issues of\r\ncommon interest. AALCO has thus provided guidance\r\nto Asian and African States in their participation in\r\ninternational legal practice and has contributed to the\r\nprogressive development and codification of\r\ninternational law. AALCO has now become a regional\r\ninternational organization with unique influence in the\r\nfield of international law. We believe AALCO will see\r\nits influence grow further with the increase in its\r\nmembership and the expansion of its activities.\r\nSince it attained United Nations Permanent\r\nObserver status in 1980, AALCO has seen its cooperation\r\nwith the Organization grow increasingly close. Several\r\nUnited Nations organs and other international\r\norganizations are regularly present at AALCO’s annual\r\nsessions and make topical presentations. Likewise,\r\nAALCO has attended relevant meetings within the\r\nUnited Nations system and participates actively in the\r\nconsideration of relevant items.\r\nA quick review of its agenda reveals the priority\r\nthat AALCO consistently accords legal issues and\r\nother matters of concern to the United Nations. At its\r\nforty-third annual session, held in June in Bali,\r\nIndonesia, AALCO considered such agenda items as\r\nthe law of the sea, recent developments related to the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, an international anti-\r\ncorruption legal instrument, jurisdictional immunities of\r\nStates and their property, the World Trade Organization as\r\na framework agreement and code of conduct for world\r\ntrade, and cooperation aimed at combating the\r\ntrafficking of women and children. The session\r\nstrengthened understanding in the area of cooperation\r\namong its member States on those agenda items.\r\nThe cooperation between AALCO and the\r\nInternational Law Commission is particularly\r\nnoteworthy. Regular attendance by AALCO and the\r\nCommission at each other’s annual or regular sessions,\r\nthe presentation of reports on the progress of their\r\nrespective work and exchanges of views have helped\r\nAsian and African States keep abreast of the most\r\nrecent developments in international legislation and\r\nhave enabled them to make their own contributions to\r\nthe progressive development and codification of\r\ninternational law.\r\nAs a member of both the United Nations and\r\nAALCO, China is pleased to see the constantly\r\nexpanding cooperation between those two\r\norganizations. It is our hope that cooperation between\r\nAALCO and the United Nations aimed at promoting\r\nthe progressive development and codification of\r\ninternational law and in other areas of common\r\nconcern will be further strengthened and that it will\r\nbecome a model for closer cooperation among global\r\nand regional organizations aimed at further promoting\r\nworld peace and development. The Chinese\r\nGovernment will, as always, continue to help to\r\nenhance AALCO’s role, increase its impact and\r\npromote closer cooperation between it and the United\r\nNations.\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nMr. Laotegguelnodji (Chad) (spoke in French):\r\nMy delegation is always greatly pleased and justly\r\nproud to see Mr. Jean Ping, a noble son of Central\r\nAfrica, presiding over the work of the General\r\nAssembly. For more than three years, my delegation\r\nhas observed that each time issues concerning Central\r\nAfrica have been considered — whether it be in the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in the Security Council or even in\r\nthe Economic and Social Council — a son of Central\r\nAfrica has always presided over the debate. Again this\r\nyear, we have not broken with tradition, since here\r\nMr. Ping is at the helm of the General Assembly, and\r\nfor an entire year of leadership. In the view of my\r\ndelegation, those are positive signals that destiny is\r\nsending to the countries and peoples of Central Africa,\r\nbrought together in the Economic Community of Central\r\nAfrican States (ECCAS), so that they can be heard and so\r\nthat bilateral partners and the international community\r\nwill support them in their development efforts.\r\nThat is why, in expressing my delegation’s\r\nsupport for the statements made by the representative\r\nof Nigeria on behalf of the African Union and by the\r\nrepresentative of the Congo on behalf of the member\r\nStates of ECCAS, I should like to say that, yes, the\r\nStates of Central Africa have certainly been heard,\r\njudging by the complexity and depth of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report before us with regard to cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and ECCAS.\r\nThe report, whether it is addressing the\r\ncontinental organization — the African Union — itself\r\nor ECCAS — one of the Union’s subregional pillars —\r\nhighlights all the salient characteristics of cooperation\r\nbetween those two African institutions, emphasizing\r\nthe concrete achievements resulting from that dynamic\r\ncooperation. In that regard, my delegation sincerely\r\ncongratulates the Secretary-General on his significant,\r\ncomprehensive report.\r\nAll of the Organization’s efforts in the past three\r\nyears to benefit Central African countries culminated with\r\nthe sending in 2003, at the initiative of the Security\r\nCouncil, of an interdisciplinary fact-finding mission of\r\nthe Department of Political Affairs to the 11 ECCAS\r\nmember countries. One of the mission’s conclusions\r\nand recommendations that my delegation would like to\r\nemphasize is the proposal to appoint a special envoy of\r\nthe Secretary-General for Central Africa.\r\nAlthough the interim report of the assessment\r\nmission (S/2003/1077) was considered in a public\r\nmeeting of the Security Council — the 4871st meeting —\r\non 24 November 2003, my delegation would like to\r\nreiterate that we hope the appointment of a special\r\nenvoy would be only an intermediate step. In fact, the\r\nmission recommendation with respect to a special\r\nenvoy could eventually lead to the establishment of a\r\ncomprehensive, integrated and lasting strategy in\r\nwhich subregional and United Nations organs\r\noperating in Central Africa would work together on all\r\npolitical, economic and humanitarian issues affecting\r\nall the States of the subregion. From that perspective,\r\nthe opening of a United Nations office in Central\r\nAfrica to efficiently coordinate all issues related to the\r\ndevelopment and consolidation of peace in Central\r\nAfrica would be welcome. In the light of my country’s\r\nexperience in conflict settlement in Central Africa and\r\nits geo-strategic situation in the subregion, Chad’s\r\nauthorities have authorized me to express their\r\nreadiness to welcome and host a United Nations office in\r\nCentral Africa should such a noble and useful project see\r\nthe light of day in the months or years to come.\r\nI used the phrase “consolidation of peace”\r\nbecause we find that nearly all of Central Africa’s\r\nhotspots of conflict either have been or are in the\r\nprocess of being extinguished, one after another.\r\nTherefore, we have reasons for hope. The eventual\r\nadoption by consensus of the draft resolution on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and ECCAS —\r\nof which my country is a sponsor — would likely\r\nstrengthen the benefits of such cooperation.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation hopes to see all the\r\nStates members of ECCAS, without exception,\r\nparticipate actively in the preparations for holding and\r\nfollowing up the forthcoming international conference\r\non the Great Lakes region.\r\nMr. Kaludjerovic (Serbia and Montenegro): It is\r\nwith pleasure that I take this opportunity to address\r\ntwo specific issues on our agenda: cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Council of Europe.\r\nThe issues on the agendas of those organizations\r\nare closely connected; that is why cooperation between\r\nthem is of vital importance. The same goes for their\r\ncooperation with the United Nations aimed at\r\nfacilitating the resolution of some of the problems that\r\nwe are facing in today’s Europe — even more so,\r\nbecause the maintenance of international peace and\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nsecurity requires a multidisciplinary approach with the\r\nparticipation and active contribution of a large number\r\nof international institutions.\r\nAt this point, I would like to emphasize the very\r\nuseful cooperation established among the three\r\norganizations in my country, especially among the\r\nUnited Nations, OSCE and Council of Europe offices\r\nin Belgrade, Podgorica and Pristina.\r\nAs a partner with the Government of Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, the OSCE has been actively involved in\r\nthe reform of election systems, the judiciary and the\r\npolice, and in the strengthening of institutions,\r\nparticularly the role of Parliament, the rule of law and\r\nlaw enforcement. In southern Serbia, the OSCE\r\nmission played a key role in containing potential ethnic\r\nconflicts by creating conditions for the peaceful\r\ndevelopment of that part of Serbia. Moreover, OSCE\r\nhas been a promoter of regional activities in border\r\nmanagement, in line with the decisions of the Ohrid\r\nConference on Balkan Border Security.\r\nAs stated in the Secretary-General’s report, there\r\nis a special form of cooperation between the United\r\nNations and OSCE and other regional organizations in\r\nour province of Kosovo and Metohija. Through the\r\nPillar system of the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), the\r\nOSCE has been particularly involved in institution-\r\nbuilding, the promotion of human rights, police\r\ntraining, media and elections. We are fully confident\r\nthat the further promotion of cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the OSCE, as well as OSCE offices\r\non the ground, will contribute to better minority\r\nprotection, the faster return of refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons and establishment of the fate of\r\nmissing persons.\r\nAs regards the United Nations and Council of\r\nEurope, we are convinced that the further advancement\r\nof their already extensive cooperation will help avoid\r\noverlapping of activities and enable the more efficient\r\nuse of resources and knowledge, thus making it\r\npossible to address even more of the needs of the\r\ncountries in which they operate.\r\nJoint United Nations and Council of Europe\r\nactivities in the field of the restoration and protection\r\nof cultural heritage in Kosovo and Metohija are of\r\nimmense importance to my country, especially in the\r\ncontext of the work of the Independent International\r\nCommission for Cultural Heritage in Kosovo, jointly\r\nset up by the Council of Europe, the European\r\nCommission and UNMIK after the March violence in\r\nKosovo and Metohija. We expect that that cooperation\r\nwill further benefit from the active participation of\r\nthose organizations at the forthcoming international\r\ndonors conference for the restoration of destroyed\r\ncultural monuments in Kosovo and Metohija, to be\r\nheld under UNESCO auspices at the very beginning of\r\nnext year.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to underline\r\nthe importance of the efforts of the Council of Europe\r\nconcerning decentralization in Kosovo and Metohija,\r\nwhich in many of its aspects converges with the plan of\r\nthe Republic of Serbia.\r\nHere let me touch on some activities that in our\r\nview merit particular attention and the need for a\r\ncommon approach. First is the area of the fight against\r\norganized crime and border management. The United\r\nNations and the OSCE held a joint conference devoted\r\nto those issues in Vienna this year to promote\r\ncooperation and assess the needs of countries in order\r\nto strengthen their capacities in those areas.\r\nNext, there is ample room to strengthen existing\r\ncooperation in the fight against terrorism by clearly\r\ndividing the roles among organizations and making the\r\nbest use of their complementary advantages. In the first\r\nhalf of 2004, a joint United Nations-OSCE conference\r\ndevoted to the fight against terrorism was held in\r\nVienna. Indeed, on the OSCE Permanent Council’s\r\nagenda for today is the fight against terrorism and\r\ncooperation between United Nations and OSCE in that\r\nregard.\r\nThe field of environmental protection is a\r\nparticularly promising area for United Nations-OSCE\r\ncooperation, as United Nations experience can be used\r\nto strengthen existing OSCE mechanisms in that field.\r\nIn that context, a memorandum of understanding\r\nbetween the OSCE, the United Nations and the\r\nEconomic Commission for Europe is currently being\r\nworked out in order to provide a legal framework for\r\nfuture joint activities.\r\nOf no less importance is the expansion of\r\ncooperation between the Council of Europe and the\r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations, particularly\r\nthose dealing with issues similar to those considered by\r\nthe Council of Europe, such as the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),\r\nUNESCO and the Office of the United Nations High\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. In 2003, at the\r\ninitiative of my country, it was agreed that the UNHCR\r\nrepresentative participate in the meetings of the\r\nCommittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe and\r\nits working bodies when issues of importance to both\r\norganizations were discussed — such as refugees and\r\ninternally displaced persons — with a view to stepping\r\nup cooperation between the two bodies and avoiding\r\noverlap.\r\nIn view of the fact that the activities of the United\r\nNations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe\r\nconverge and complement each other in many respects,\r\nwe are confident that by strengthening the existing\r\ncooperation they could provide additional assistance\r\nnot only to my country but to the region of South-\r\nEastern Europe as a whole.\r\nMr. Amayom (Kenya): Thank you, Mr. President,\r\nfor giving me this opportunity to make a brief\r\nintervention on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the African Union (AU), as well as on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Organization (AALCO).\r\nRegional and other organizations have\r\nundoubtedly become pillars of development. They have\r\ncontributed on all multisectorial issues, including the\r\npromotion and preservation of international peace,\r\nstability and security, and sustainable development.\r\nConsequently, those organizations have gained\r\nrecognition for the work they have done and for the\r\nrole they have played in complementing the functions\r\nof the United Nations. My delegation therefore aligns\r\nitself with the statement made by the delegation of\r\nIndonesia when introducing draft resolution A/59/L.1, on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and AALCO.\r\nKenya believes that cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional and other organizations is\r\nimportant and needs to be encouraged. We hold the\r\nview that the challenging issues facing the world can best\r\nbe addressed collectively. My delegation appreciates the\r\nenormous achievement realized from the continued\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nand other organizations as indicated in the report of the\r\nSecretary General contained in document A/59/303.\r\nThe African Union has been actively involved in\r\nthe fields of capacity-building, promotion of peace in\r\nconflict areas and sustainable development and has\r\nalso collaborated with the United Nations Office for\r\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs on those\r\nissues. The two organizations have also cooperated in\r\npeacekeeping, protection and promotion of human\r\nrights, conflict management, health and poverty\r\neradication, as well as children’s issues. In that regard,\r\nwe would like to note our appreciation for the\r\nassistance provided by the United Nations in\r\npeacekeeping and crisis management on the continent\r\nof Africa.\r\nAs a regular troop-contributing country, we\r\nwelcome the decision by the AU to establish a standby\r\nforce. That is in line with the Brahimi report\r\n(A/55/305), which called for complementing United\r\nNations efforts with regional peacekeeping forces. My\r\ndelegation looks forward to the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport on implementation of the recommendations of\r\nthe Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations to\r\nenhance African peacekeeping capability. We call on\r\nthe international community to assist the AU to realize\r\nthe establishment of that desired force. My delegation\r\nalso welcomes the establishment of the Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group on Conflict Prevention and Resolution\r\nin Africa, which will undoubtedly strengthen\r\ncooperation between the two organizations.\r\nWe welcome the overwhelming support accorded\r\nto the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\ninitiative by the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity. We take the view that the successful\r\nimplementation of its objectives, as well as the\r\nfulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals, are\r\ncontingent on the support that will be accorded by our\r\ndevelopment partners. The HIV/AIDS pandemic and\r\nother debilitating diseases, as well as endemic poverty\r\nand unfair trade practices, continue to militate against\r\nsustainable development.\r\nWe note with satisfaction, however, the\r\ncontinuing efforts of AALCO towards strengthening\r\nthe role of the United Nations and its various organs in\r\nthe areas of combating corruption, international\r\nterrorism and drug trafficking, as well as human rights\r\nissues. It is also working to enhance the rule of law, to\r\nensure wider adherence to related international\r\ninstruments and to promote the objectives and principles\r\nset out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration.\r\nIn view of the important role played by AALCO,\r\nwe support initiatives to expand and enhance its\r\ncooperation with the United Nations and welcome draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.1, introduced this morning by the\r\nAmbassador of Indonesia.\r\n29\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nMy delegation would also like to extend its\r\nappreciation to the Government of Indonesia for\r\nsuccessfully hosting the forty-third session of AALCO\r\nin June 2003. Kenya has been honoured with the task\r\nof taking up the chairmanship of AALCO for the\r\nperiod 2005-2006. We shall endeavour to ensure\r\ngreater cooperation between AALCO and the United\r\nNations. Consequently, Kenya will be hosting\r\nAALCO’s forty-fourth session in Nairobi in June 2005,\r\nat a time when the organization will be observing its\r\nfiftieth anniversary. My delegation takes this\r\nopportunity to invite all member States to Nairobi for\r\nthe forty-fourth session.\r\nIn conclusion, Kenya remains supportive of the\r\nSecretary-General; we must pool resources with a view\r\nto fostering fruitful cooperation in the search for long-\r\nterm solutions to global challenges.\r\nMr. Grigore (Republic of Moldova): My\r\ndelegation endorses the statement made by the\r\ndelegation of Ukraine on behalf of the States members\r\nof the GUUAM group — Georgia, Ukraine,\r\nUzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Moldova. We would like to\r\naddress several additional points that are of particular\r\ninterest to my country.\r\nI would like to join other delegations in thanking\r\nthe Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nand other organizations (A/59/303). It provides a clear\r\nand meaningful overview, and forms an excellent basis\r\nfor our debate today. My delegation supports the\r\napproach taken to conduct a single joint debate on all\r\nthe agenda items concerning cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional and other organizations. It\r\nallows us to make a general assessment of best\r\npractices with a view to ensuring complementarity\r\nbetween the efforts of the United Nations and regional\r\nand other organizations in tackling the most important\r\nissues on the global agenda, as well as to deciding on\r\nthe way forward for enhanced cooperation.\r\nWe believe that the debates in the General\r\nAssembly on this issue should not only address the\r\ntechnical issues of interaction between the United\r\nNations and various regional and other organizations,\r\nbut also allow for scrutiny of the results of their\r\ncommon efforts, because only progress made towards\r\naccomplishing shared goals can be considered a\r\nmeasure of the effectiveness of their cooperation.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the efficient\r\ncollaboration between the Secretariat, as well as United\r\nNations bodies and agencies, and the Council of\r\nEurope, which remains the leading regional\r\norganization in promoting democracy, human rights\r\nand the rule of law. The Republic of Moldova, as the\r\ncountry that held the chairmanship of the Committee of\r\nMinisters of the Council of Europe in the second half\r\nof 2003, is well aware of the value of this cooperation.\r\nWe also acknowledge, as does the report, the contribution\r\nof the Inter-Parliamentary Union to achieving the major\r\ngoals and objectives of the international community, and\r\nare looking forward to the Second Conference of\r\nSpeakers of Parliaments in 2005.\r\nAs an active member of the Black Sea Economic\r\nCooperation Organization (BSEC), the Republic of\r\nMoldova appreciates the initiation of joint programmes\r\npertaining to fields of common interest for both the\r\nUnited Nations and BSEC. We value the improved\r\ncooperation, including in the area of peace and security\r\non the African continent, between the United Nations\r\nand the International Organization of la Francophonie,\r\nof which Moldova is a member.\r\nI would like to single out the issue of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is\r\nof the utmost importance for my country. The United\r\nNations and the OSCE have shared interests on the\r\nEuropean continent — to strengthen the rule of law and\r\ndemocracy and to promote human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, as well as to contribute to\r\nconflict prevention and post-conflict peacebuilding.\r\nAlthough very concise on this issue because of its\r\nnew format, the report takes stock of the important\r\nefforts that both organizations have made to improve\r\ntheir interaction, at the level of secretariats, as well as\r\namong their missions in the field, as is the case in\r\nKosovo and Georgia. Some significant steps have also\r\nbeen taken within the framework of the tripartite\r\nprocess of informal consultations among the United\r\nNations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe with a\r\nview to enhancing cooperation in areas such as\r\ncombating terrorist acts and human trafficking, curbing\r\norganized crime and corruption and fostering economic\r\nand environmental cooperation. There is good\r\ninteraction between the OSCE and the Economic\r\nCommission for Europe, the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United\r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime, the Office of the\r\n30\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nand the United Nations Development Programme.\r\nWith its unique and comprehensive approach to\r\nsecurity, stressing human rights, as well as political\r\nmilitary issues, the OSCE remains the primary\r\ninstrument for early warning, conflict prevention, crisis\r\nmanagement and post-conflict rehabilitation in the\r\nregion. This aspect, however, is reflected less in the\r\nreport, probably because the cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the OSCE on the issue of conflicts\r\nthat are not dealt with by the Security Council is only\r\nsporadic.\r\nThere are, however, many unresolved issues on\r\nthe OSCE security agenda that deserve close attention\r\nfrom the United Nations. One of those issues is the\r\ncontinued existence of so-called frozen conflicts in the\r\nBlack Sea-South Caucasus region — in Moldova,\r\nGeorgia and Azerbaijan. Those conflicts have far-\r\nreaching implications for international peace and\r\nsecurity, regional stability and development. Despite\r\nOSCE efforts, international mediation has not been\r\nsuccessful in resolving those conflicts. The OSCE\r\nChairman-in-Office acknowledged the threat posed by\r\nthe frozen conflicts during his briefing to the Security\r\nCouncil in May 2004, and appealed to Council\r\nmembers to contribute to their resolution.\r\nAs my delegation has pointed out during previous\r\nsessions, United Nations bodies and agencies and the\r\nOSCE could and should discover new areas of\r\ncooperation to facilitate the settlement of frozen\r\nconflicts. All the capabilities of both organizations\r\nmust be used to that end; they must not be hindered by\r\nconcerns about the so-called division of labour.\r\nIt is increasingly evident that we must urgently\r\nstep up joint efforts to deal with the political conflict in\r\nthe eastern part of my country. The Republic of\r\nMoldova has systematically informed the relevant\r\ninternational organizations of the danger posed by this\r\nprotracted conflict and of our efforts to resolve it. Over\r\nthe years, the Republic of Moldova has worked in good\r\nfaith with all the actors involved in the settlement\r\nprocess. While working in a spirit of compromise, the\r\nMoldovan authorities have firmly maintained that any\r\nsettlement proposal or solution to the political conflict\r\nmust be based on the respect for the sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of the country. Despite the\r\nconstructive approach of the Moldovan authorities in\r\ntheir dialogue with the self-appointed Transdniestrian\r\nleaders and with other participants in the multilateral\r\nnegotiating framework, the lack of tangible results after\r\n12 years of negotiations has demonstrated the inefficiency\r\nof the existing regional settlement mechanism.\r\nAlso, it has become clear that the self-proclaimed\r\nTransdniestrian authorities do not sincerely desire the\r\ncountry’s reintegration. Backed by influential foreign\r\nactors, the separatist leaders have manipulated the\r\nnegotiating process towards other ends than those set\r\ninitially. The failure to end the process of the\r\nwithdrawal of foreign troops, munitions and\r\narmaments, as stipulated in the 1999 Istanbul OSCE\r\nSummit documents, has also not facilitated the\r\ncomplete settlement of this political conflict.\r\nThe overall situation in the region has\r\nsignificantly worsened, especially in 2004, when\r\nseparatist paramilitaries continuously attempted to\r\nconsolidate their presence in some portions of the\r\nsecurity zone and to take control of a number of\r\nvillages, railways stations and other property currently\r\nunder the jurisdiction of the constitutional authorities.\r\nThe separatist regime systematically violates most\r\nhuman rights, even children’s right to education. This\r\nregion remains an area of illegal production and\r\ntrafficking of arms that are likely to reach other\r\nconflict zones, a lawless territory of smuggling and\r\nultimately a threat to regional security and stability.\r\nThis is why the Republic of Moldova calls for a more\r\nactive and result-oriented involvement on the part of the\r\nUnited Nations and European regional organizations, in\r\nparticular the OSCE and the European Union.\r\nWe believe that it is essential to deploy an\r\ninternational monitoring mission under the auspices of\r\nthe OSCE and EU along the porous Transdniestrian\r\nsegment of the eastern border of Moldova with a view\r\nto curbing the illegal activities of the separatist regime.\r\nWe deem it necessary to modify the components of the\r\nexisting peacekeeping mechanism, which is lacking in\r\neffectiveness and impartiality, and to replace it with a\r\nnew one under a clear international mandate.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova is strongly committed\r\nto solving this political conflict peacefully, on the basis\r\nof the respect for the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of the country. By launching an initiative for a\r\nstability and security pact for Moldova, President\r\nVladimir Voronin invited all concerned parties to reach\r\nconsensus in order to guarantee the independence,\r\nsovereignty and integrity of a democratic Moldovan\r\n31\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nState, embarked upon the path to European integration.\r\nHolding an international conference on this issue could\r\nprovide useful insights on the measures to follow.\r\nMy delegation also believes that both the United\r\nNations and the OSCE should insist on ensuring strict\r\nand full implementation of their resolutions and\r\ndecisions with relevance to the conflict situations.\r\nNoting with concern the halt in the withdrawal of\r\nforeign military forces from the territory of Moldova in\r\n2004, we would like to emphasize once again the\r\nurgency of completing this process in accordance with\r\nthe 1999 OSCE Summit decisions, which the General\r\nAssembly specifically upheld by adopting the relevant\r\nprovisions in its resolutions of 1999, 2000, 2001 and\r\n2002 on cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe OSCE.\r\nFinally, my delegation looks forward to the\r\nadoption at the current session of a meaningful and\r\nsubstantive resolution on the cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the OSCE that would candidly\r\nassess the situation on the ground and contribute to\r\nsolving the difficult problems existing in the OSCE\r\nregion.\r\nThe Acting President: In view of the long list of\r\nspeakers still inscribed on my list, we will prolong this\r\nevening’s meeting until 6.30 p.m.\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): My delegation fully\r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Ukraine on behalf of the Georgia,\r\nUzbekistan, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Republic of Moldova\r\nGroup (GUUAM) on the agenda item entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nand other organizations”. I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to present our national perspective on the\r\nitem under consideration, and in particular on sub-\r\nitems (d), (f), (n) and (p).\r\nOn sub-item (n), the cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), we took note of the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General (A/59/303), which is,\r\nregrettably, more statistical than analytical or thought-\r\nprovoking. We were surprised that, even in the reported\r\nenumeration of the joint activities of the United\r\nNations and the Organization for Security and Co-\r\noperation in Europe (OSCE), we failed to find any\r\nreference to the cooperation between the two\r\norganizations in the field of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, except for counter-\r\nterrorism measures. The logical question is the\r\nfollowing: is there any cooperation, or at least\r\ninteraction, between the United Nations and the OSCE,\r\nas defined by Article 52 of Chapter VIII of the United\r\nNations Charter on regional arrangements with the\r\nmain purpose of “dealing with such matters relating to\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security”?\r\nIf yes, then why is the authority to deal with evident\r\nthreats to the peace and security of its Member States,\r\nentrusted to the OSCE by the General Assembly, not\r\ncovered in the report as a matter of priority?\r\nIt is also worrisome that both organizations, in\r\ntheir cooperation, pay inadequate attention to existing\r\nthreats to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of\r\ntheir member States. Having studied the report and\r\nother relevant documents for the past several years,\r\nAzerbaijan has not noticed any serious consideration or\r\nassessment of the settlement processes of the armed\r\nconflicts existing in the OSCE area, or, at least, none in\r\nthe consultations held on a regular basis at all levels\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OSCE.\r\nHere, I wish to express a note of caution. The\r\nUnited Nations and the OSCE are the only\r\ninternational organizations that are responsible for\r\nmaintaining peace and security in Azerbaijan.\r\nTherefore, we are justified in expecting the OSCE to\r\nfulfil its mandate and in expecting the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council to utilize this regional arrangement\r\nfor implementing Council resolutions upholding the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of this United\r\nNations Member State. For that reason, it is incumbent\r\non both organizations to respond to the appeals of their\r\nmember States and effectively counter the threats to\r\nthese States’ security.\r\nNevertheless, it is encouraging to see the range of\r\nactivities specified in the report. They are diverse and\r\nvary from putting an end to the trafficking of human\r\nbeings to fighting corruption. Azerbaijan would like to\r\nrequest that this list of activities be substantially\r\namended through analyses of and reports on the\r\nachievements and, perhaps, failures of the negotiation\r\nprocesses seeking to resolve conflicts in the OSCE\r\narea, in particular of those processes based on Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. The consequences and\r\nimplications of the conflicts for the peace and\r\ndevelopment of the affected countries are devastating\r\nand merit serious consideration and appropriate\r\ncooperative actions by both organizations.\r\n32\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nAnother important sphere of cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the OSCE concerns the\r\nhumanitarian dimension. Unfortunately, while this sort\r\nof activity is ongoing in the field, the report does not\r\nmention it at all.\r\nAzerbaijan also believes that the transition from\r\nrelief to development could represent a truly practical\r\nopportunity for coordinating the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations and the OSCE, given the latter’s\r\nexperience in stabilization and post-conflict\r\nrehabilitation in the Balkans.\r\nWe are pleased to see noted in the report that the\r\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Europe\r\n(ECE) enjoys a close working relationship with OSCE\r\nin the economic and environmental areas. Azerbaijan\r\nhopes that that relationship will result in target-\r\noriented projects to be implemented on the ground.\r\nTurning to sub-item (d), cooperation of the\r\nUnited Nations with the Black Sea Economic\r\nCooperation Organization (BSEC) offers great\r\nopportunities for fostering growth and promoting\r\nsustainable development. The role and potential of that\r\norganization should be reviewed in light of the ongoing\r\ndevelopment in the region, including the enlargement\r\nof the European Union. We note with satisfaction the\r\npositive trends in BSEC development. In our view,\r\nextended inter-agency dialogue, partnerships with all\r\nstakeholders and financial support will have a direct\r\nimpact on BSEC institutional capacities and make it\r\nmore responsive to the needs of the region, which\r\nmembers are looking forward to.\r\nWe recognize the vital role inter-agency dialogue\r\nand collaboration plays in effective and timely\r\nimplementation of the development agenda of the\r\nBlack Sea Economic Cooperation Organization. In that\r\nspecific context, we would like to underline the role of\r\nthe United Nations. We appreciate the strengthening of\r\ncollaborative arrangements between BSEC and United\r\nNations system organizations and fully concur with the\r\nrecommendation of the Secretary-General to continue\r\nthat cooperation in fields of common interest and his\r\ncall on the specialized agencies to formulate and\r\nimplement joint programmes.\r\nThe further contribution of the United Nations\r\nand the ECE to the work of BSEC in the field of\r\ntransportation is crucial. In the meantime, we look\r\nforward to the expansion of cooperation between ECE\r\nand BSEC to include the areas of trade facilitation and\r\nsustainable energy. We would also like to highlight the\r\nprogress in cooperation between BSEC and the Food\r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,\r\nwhich we believe is making a good contribution to the\r\nsustainable development of agriculture in the region\r\nand, ultimately, to strengthening the capacities of BSEC\r\nmember States in achieving their common objective of\r\neradicating hunger and poverty. The dialogue between\r\nBSEC and the World Bank and the World Trade\r\nOrganization should also be further promoted.\r\nAzerbaijan places special emphasis on\r\ncooperation with BSEC. During our two consecutive\r\nchairmanships of BSEC, we pursued a priority-based\r\napproach and contributed to translating that approach\r\ninto operative targets. Based on the resources available\r\nand existing comparative advantages, we identified the\r\nstrengthening of inter-State cooperation in the fields of\r\nenergy and development of transport networks as\r\npriorities. We fully welcome, therefore, the adoption\r\nand further implementation of the Baku Declaration on\r\nenergy and cooperation. For our part, we are resolved to\r\nfurther contribute to energy supply security and\r\ndevelopment of oil and gas pipeline networks, including\r\nthrough the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, on which\r\nwe have recently witnessed substantive progress.\r\nThe delegation of Azerbaijan would like to\r\nextend its support to the draft resolution to be\r\nsubmitted under this agenda sub-item and invites\r\nMember States to consider co-sponsoring it.\r\nTurning to sub-item (p), on cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference (OIC), Azerbaijan believes that the\r\ndetermination of the United Nations and OIC to further\r\nstrengthen existing cooperation, by developing specific\r\nproposals in designated priority areas is crucial. In that\r\nregard, we welcome the information contained in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, in particular concerning the\r\nmeeting held in Vienna from 13 to 15 July 2004, which\r\nevaluated the existing United Nations-OIC cooperation\r\nmechanisms and produced a number of proposals to\r\nenhance that cooperation. In order to deepen the\r\nrelations between the two organizations and in view of\r\nthe scope of the regions affected by conflicts, we are\r\nconvinced that the two organizations should cooperate\r\nmore closely in conflict prevention, crisis management\r\nand post-conflict rehabilitation.\r\nOn sub-item (f), regarding cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Council of Europe, my\r\n33\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\ncountry highly appreciates the continued practice of\r\ndirect contacts between the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe, carried out by the secretariats and\r\nspecialized agencies of both organizations. Both\r\norganizations pursue the same aims and ideals, namely,\r\nto maintain international peace and security, to develop\r\nfriendly relations among nations and to achieve\r\ncooperation in solving international problems, as\r\nenshrined the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nExpressing our support for the draft resolution on this\r\ntopic, we believe that the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe could cooperate more actively in\r\nconflict prevention, crisis management and post-\r\nconflict peace-building, each of them through their\r\nown instruments. By doing so they would complement\r\neach other’s activities.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 57/32 of 19 November\r\n2002, I now call on Mr. Sergio Páez, President of the\r\nCouncil of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.\r\nMr. Páez (Inter-Parliamentary Union) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): For many years, the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion (IPU) has been engaged in developing a wide-\r\nranging programme of cooperation with the United\r\nNations and support for its agenda. We believe that that\r\nis a natural evolution for two organizations that pursue\r\nthe same objectives, albeit from their respective\r\ninstitutional standpoints and interests.\r\nTwo years ago, in recognition of its standing as\r\nthe world organization of national parliaments, the\r\nAssembly granted observer status to the IPU. Since\r\nthat time, the relations between the two organizations\r\nhave taken on new impetus and significance, and it is\r\nour intention to continue to build on those foundations\r\nin the future.\r\nThis is a time when the United Nations is seeking\r\nto reinforce its links with the legislative branches of\r\nGovernment. It is not alone is seeking to do so. In fact,\r\nit is a sign of the times. Many multilateral\r\norganizations are turning to publicly elected\r\nrepresentatives in the hope of narrowing the gap\r\nbetween peoples’ hopes and the requirements of\r\neffective global governance.\r\nI will not dwell here on the subject of the recent\r\nreport published by the Panel of Eminent Persons on\r\nUnited Nations-Civil Society Relations, known as the\r\nCardoso Panel (A/58/817 and Corr.1). The matter has\r\nalready been addressed in the General Assembly\r\ndebate. What is more, the report is essentially about\r\ncivil society, a category to which the world’s\r\nlegislatures do not belong. I would, however, like to set\r\nout my vision of what cooperation between the United\r\nNations and IPU is, and what it is destined to become.\r\nIn 2000, IPU mobilized the leaders of the world’s\r\nparliaments for a ground-breaking conference that took\r\nplace in this Assembly Hall on the eve of the\r\nMillennium Summit. The declaration that emanated\r\nfrom that historic gathering stressed the wish of the\r\nworld’s parliaments to contribute to international\r\ncooperation, with the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union at the core of their efforts, and\r\nthat point was acknowledged by the world’s heads of\r\nState and Government.\r\nAs we approach the fifth anniversary of the\r\nMillennium, IPU is preparing once again to mobilize\r\nspeakers and presiding officers of parliaments for the\r\nsecond World Conference of Speakers of Parliaments,\r\nto be held here in New York in September 2005. I need\r\nnot tell you that the year 2005 will be an important one\r\nin the history of this world Organization. The United\r\nNations will be celebrating its sixtieth anniversary and\r\ncarrying out its first five-year review of the\r\nMillennium Declaration. It will thus be a time when\r\nthe Organization will be gauging its own progress on\r\nreform, which has become a matter of increasing\r\nurgency for its membership.\r\nIn that context, it is important that\r\nparliamentarians help to bring about change and play a\r\nmore dynamic and decisive role in all fields of\r\ninternational cooperation, in addition to supporting a\r\nmultilateralism that is more effective and\r\ncomprehensive. In that context, the second World\r\nConference of Speakers of Parliaments, to be held in\r\n2005, will be of singular importance.\r\nIn the effort to assist the United Nations to\r\nachieve its goals, make its case and meet its\r\nchallenges, parliamentary bodies constitute a rich\r\nresource and an invaluable institutional support. The\r\nsuccess achieved to date in the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals already owes much to\r\nthem. That is why we believe that the report that we\r\nwill be presenting on the structure and functioning of\r\nparliamentary mechanisms in the context of\r\nmultilateral cooperation will be both timely and\r\nvaluable for the international system.\r\n34\r\nA/59/PV.39\r\nAgainst the backdrop of those broader questions,\r\nit should not be forgotten that the IPU is an action-\r\noriented organization — one that is constantly aware of\r\npeople’s day-to-day needs. Indeed, the IPU is involved\r\nwhenever major political nation-building initiatives are\r\nunder way and whenever the United Nations is hard at\r\nwork helping countries emerge from conflict. That was\r\nthe case, for example, in Timor-Leste, where we\r\nworked hard to help establish the new Legislative\r\nAssembly. An IPU needs-assessment mission will be in\r\nAfghanistan assisting in a programme aimed at the\r\nconsolidation of the new Parliament in Kabul. Yet\r\nanother mission will be in Amman, working with Iraq’s\r\nInterim Assembly in preparing the ground for the\r\nConstitutional Assembly that will, God willing, be\r\nelected at the beginning of next year.\r\nDrawing on this extensive practical experience\r\nand on the efforts made by the IPU over the years to\r\ndevelop the normative aspects of democracy, we are\r\nalso working on a systematic framework of democracy\r\nindicators within countries. The framework thus\r\ncreated will identify legitimate representation\r\nmechanisms and the institutional practices of\r\nparliaments that allow them to operate as effective\r\nlegislative and oversight institutions.\r\nOver the past two days, the Annual Parliamentary\r\nHearing at the United Nations, which traditionally\r\nbrings together the members of Parliament present in\r\nthe General Assembly, has been debating the theme of\r\ndisarmament, lasting peace and post-conflict\r\nreconstruction.\r\nSpeakers of Parliaments, legislators from all over\r\nthe world, high-level officials from the United Nations\r\nand eminent experts representing a broad range of\r\npolitical thought held a rich and active exchange of\r\nviews.\r\nThrough this multiplicity of activities, as set forth\r\nin the Secretary-General’s report on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union, as well as others to which I\r\nreferred earlier, the IPU is bringing the parliaments to\r\nthe United Nations, and the United Nations to the\r\nparliaments. Throughout we have maintained that this\r\nis a two-way relationship. One the one hand, the IPU\r\nmobilizes those parliamentarians with practical\r\nexpertise in dealing with specific issues and helps them\r\ninteract with each other and with relevant United\r\nNations bodies. On the other, the United Nations takes\r\nsteps to improve understanding and knowledge of its\r\naims and objectives, thereby enabling parliamentarians\r\nto serve as its political arm.\r\nI feel in duty bound to take this opportunity to\r\nreiterate the IPU’s commitment systematically and with\r\nthe necessary political resolve to work every day to\r\nstrengthen peace processes the world over, promoting\r\nformal education in support of lasting peace and taking\r\ninitiatives to ensure peaceful coexistence at the local\r\nand global levels.\r\nCollective security is today a specific moral\r\nimperative and a pressing need on the part of our\r\npeoples, to which we must respond quickly and\r\neffectively. This solid and tangible commitment to\r\npeace and collective security will be a key priority for\r\nthe world’s parliaments, in keeping with their\r\nhumanistic principles and their fundamental values and\r\nwith the principles of the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.25 p.m.\r\n"
