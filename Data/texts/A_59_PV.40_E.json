The Executive Secretary of\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nOrganization (CTBTO), Mr. Wolfgang Hoffmann, has\r\nalready given an account of the CTBTO’s activities\r\nduring the past year. I will, therefore, in my brief\r\nstatement, concentrate on the activities to promote the\r\nentry into force of the Treaty.\r\nThe Treaty was adopted by the General Assembly\r\non 10 September 1996 (resolution 50/245) and was\r\nopened for signature two weeks later on 24 September.\r\nToday, the Treaty has been signed by 173 States,\r\nincluding all five nuclear States, and has been ratified\r\nby 119. Regardless of the high acceptance the Treaty\r\nenjoys, it has not yet entered into force. For the Treaty\r\nto enter into force, the deposit of the instruments of\r\nratification of 44 States listed in annex II to the Treaty\r\nis required. This rather exceptional rule was developed\r\nin order to guarantee that all those States which\r\npossessed nuclear knowledge would be bound by the\r\nTreaty. Of those 44 States whose ratification is\r\nrequired, 33 have ratified.\r\nAs it already seemed likely when the Treaty was\r\nnegotiated that with this process for entry into force,\r\nadditional efforts would be needed to guarantee entry\r\ninto force, a mechanism to promote this was developed\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nin article XIV of the Treaty. Accordingly, the first\r\nConference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the\r\nCTBT, convened to consider measures to accelerate the\r\nratification process, was held in Vienna in October\r\n1999 under the presidency of Japan, the second in New\r\nYork in November 2001 under the presidency of\r\nMexico, and the third, under the presidency of Finland,\r\nin September 2003 in Vienna.\r\nIn the Final Declaration adopted by consensus at\r\nthe Conference last year, the participating States\r\nstressed the importance of prompt signature and\r\nratification by those whose ratification was needed for\r\nits entry into force but which had not yet ratified. It\r\nwas noted that recent international events had made the\r\nTreaty’s entry into force as urgent as when it had first\r\nbeen negotiated. The prevention of the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction was one of the most\r\nimportant challenges facing the world. Furthermore,\r\nthe Conference considered it essential to maintain\r\nmomentum in building a verification regime capable of\r\nmeeting the Treaty’s verification requirements upon its\r\nentry into force. That verification system would be\r\nunprecedented in its global reach after entry into force\r\nand would thereby ensure that States were maintaining\r\ntheir Treaty commitments.\r\nDespite the fact that the Treaty has not entered\r\ninto force, its fundamental objective can be said to\r\nhave been achieved insofar as all States have continued\r\nto refrain from detonating nuclear explosions. The\r\nConference thus called upon all States to continue their\r\nmoratoriums on nuclear weapon test explosions and all\r\nother nuclear explosions.\r\nIn adopting the Final Declaration, the Conference\r\nalso adopted a list of concrete measures to be taken to\r\npromote the early entry into force of the Treaty. This is\r\na novel approach, which I hope will serve its purpose\r\nand bring us a bit closer to the Treaty’s entry into\r\nforce. The list consists of 12 measures. They need not\r\nbe enumerated here, as they can be found in the\r\ndeclaration. I would, however, like to highlight a few\r\nof them. Finland was elected to serve as coordinator in\r\norder “to promote cooperation, through informal\r\nconsultations with all interested countries aimed at\r\npromoting further signatures and ratifications”. There\r\nis already a tradition of appointing the country that has\r\nserved as chairman for the article XIV Conference to\r\nact as the coordinator. There are two new measures that\r\nhave significantly broadened the resources available\r\nfor promotional activities and which are important\r\ninnovations.\r\nFirst, it was decided to establish a contact list of\r\ncountries that have already ratified the Treaty to serve\r\nas volunteers to assist the coordinator in various\r\nregions. On the basis of that list of volunteers, the\r\nfollowing countries were chosen as regional\r\ncoordinators: for Africa, South Africa; for Eastern\r\nEurope, Ukraine; for Latin America, Chile and\r\nVenezuela; for North America and Western Europe,\r\nAustria, Canada and Spain; and for South-East Asia\r\nand the Pacific, Japan, Korea and the Philippines. The\r\nrole played by those regional coordinators has been\r\nmost encouraging. They have been able to keep the\r\nquestion of ratification on the agendas of various\r\nregional summits and seminars and of other high-level\r\npolitical meetings, and thus to raise awareness of the\r\nimportance of the Treaty.\r\nSecondly, it was agreed that ratifying States\r\nwould consider appointing a special representative to\r\nassist the coordinating State in its function of\r\npromoting the entry into force of the Treaty.\r\nConsequently, the States parties elected Ambassador\r\nJaap Ramaker from the Netherlands as the Special\r\nRepresentative to assist the coordinating country.\r\nThrough his visits, Ambassador Ramaker will\r\nencourage those countries that have not yet ratified the\r\nTreaty to do so. He will provide the States he visits\r\nwith background information on the significance of the\r\nTreaty, including on its role and function in the wider\r\ncontext of nuclear arms control, disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation.\r\nI would like to draw attention to a meeting which\r\ntook place here a month ago, on 23 September 2004.\r\nOn the initiative of the Foreign Ministers of Japan,\r\nAustralia, the Netherlands and Finland, Foreign\r\nMinisters and other high-level representatives from 45\r\ncountries met and signed a statement in which they\r\nappealed to all countries that had not yet done so to\r\nsign and ratify the Treaty without delay. They\r\nfurthermore called upon all countries to continue a\r\nmoratorium on nuclear weapon test explosions or any\r\nother nuclear explosions. That meeting was the second\r\nof its kind. The first had taken place two years earlier,\r\nalso here in New York, in September 2002. After the\r\nmeeting, countries that had not been able to attend\r\nwere offered the opportunity to associate themselves\r\nwith the statement. As a result, a total of 64 countries\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nhave decided to adhere to it. Two years ago the number\r\nof countries associated with the statement was 50.\r\nThe Treaty enjoys broad support. That has been\r\ndemonstrated both by the high-level attendance at the\r\nmeetings and by the number of signatures and\r\nratifications. Nevertheless, the Treaty has not yet\r\nentered into force. But the wide support for the Treaty\r\nmakes us confident that we will succeed in reaching\r\nthe final goal, although much still remains to be done,\r\nespecially considering the ongoing preparations for the\r\n2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nAs the coordinator for the activities to facilitate\r\nthe entry into force of the CTBT, Finland appeals to all\r\nsignatory States to join forces to remove the obstacles\r\nstill preventing it. By convincing all those States that\r\nhave not yet signed or ratified the Treaty of its\r\nimportance, we shall ensure the Treaty’s entry into\r\nforce.\r\nMrs. Lima da Veiga (Cape Verde) (spoke in\r\nFrench): It is a great honour for me to be participating\r\nin this debate on agenda item 56 — “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and other\r\norganizations” — on the basis of the excellent report of\r\nthe Secretary-General (A/59/303). The report shows\r\nthat the new partnership between the United Nations\r\nand regional organizations is of particular importance\r\nas we move towards our common goals, including the\r\npromotion of peace, stability and development. That\r\ncooperation is also in line with our desire to revitalize\r\nthe Organization and is essential to achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nIn 1994, the Secretary-General introduced the\r\npractice of convening regular meetings between senior\r\nofficials of the United Nations and leaders of regional\r\norganizations. That practice has proven very useful\r\nbecause it helps to strengthen inter-regional dialogue,\r\npromotes the sharing of experience and creates\r\ndesirable synergies among the various programmes. We\r\nbelieve that this cooperation will continue to increase\r\nnot only because of the resources made available, but\r\nalso because of the creativity of the various players as\r\nthey carry out the recommendations and implement the\r\nfollow-up plans arising from those meetings.\r\nThe delegation of Cape Verde associates itself\r\nwith the statement made by Nigeria on behalf of\r\nAfrica. We welcome cooperation between the African\r\nUnion and the African regional organizations in many\r\nspheres. That cooperation has enabled us to identify a\r\ncommon approach and to find complementarity in such\r\nareas as conflict management, peace-building and\r\npeacekeeping, and the implementation of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). The\r\nestablishment of the Ad Hoc Working Group on\r\nConflict Prevention and Resolution in Africa, the Ad\r\nHoc Advisory Group on African Countries emerging\r\nfrom conflict and the Secretary-General’s Office of the\r\nSpecial Adviser on Africa are all welcome initiatives\r\nthat contribute to strengthening that cooperation.\r\nCape Verde is a member of the Community of\r\nPortuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP). I am pleased\r\nto support the statement made yesterday morning by\r\nthe representative of Sao Tome and Principe on behalf\r\nof the member States of the Community. As the\r\nAssembly will recall, that statement dealt with the\r\ndesire of Portuguese-speaking countries for\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCommunity to be formally established, in the spirit of\r\nthe Charter and the various General Assembly\r\nresolutions on the need to strengthen contacts and\r\nidentify areas of cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional and other organizations.\r\nAlthough it is not a traditional so-called regional\r\norganization, the CPLP is an intergovernmental\r\norganization that brings together eight member\r\ncountries from four continents that share a common\r\nlanguage and history and, above all, common interests.\r\nThe organization is based on three main pillars:\r\nreaching political and diplomatic agreement,\r\ncooperating on development matters and promoting the\r\nPortuguese language. The CPLP’s overall goals are to\r\npromote peace, democracy, the rule of law, human\r\nrights and social justice. Because it promotes inter-\r\nregional dialogue, the organization has concluded\r\ncooperation agreements with other regional entities, as\r\nwell as with agencies of the United Nations system.\r\nDespite its short history, it has already had positive\r\nexperiences, working in close cooperation with other\r\nregional organizations such as the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States and the Economic\r\nCommunity of Central African States, managing crises\r\nand promoting peace in some of its member countries.\r\nIt is therefore my hope that the draft resolution on\r\nthis matter to be introduced at this meeting will be\r\nsupported by all Member States.\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nMr. Katsareas (Greece): Greece wholeheartedly\r\nsupports the cooperation of the United Nations with\r\nregional organizations. That cooperation has proved\r\nfruitful in many fields, and has become a very useful\r\ninstrument in addressing the many regional problems\r\nof our times.\r\nI want to refer especially to the Black Sea\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization (BSEC). Greece\r\nis a founding member of the group, as well as the sole\r\ncountry among its 12 member States to be a full\r\nmember of the European Union. Greece will assume\r\nthe chairmanship of BSEC as of 29 October. My\r\ncountry, as a future chair of the organization, will do its\r\nbest both to promote its goals and to strengthen its\r\nstanding in the family of international organizations,\r\nespecially those related to the United Nations system.\r\nAs a regional economic organization, BSEC\r\ncovers a geographic area encompassing the Balkans,\r\nthe Caucasus and the Black Sea littoral States. BSEC\r\naims at contributing to regional and international\r\npeace, security, stability and welfare by developing\r\neconomic and trade relations between its member\r\nStates. It has become a forum for discussion and\r\ncooperation on areas ranging from energy to transport\r\nand from trade, economic development, the\r\nenvironment and tourism to agriculture, small- and\r\nmedium-sized enterprises, combating crime and\r\nterrorism and emergency relief.\r\nAlthough BCEC is not directly involved in\r\npeacekeeping and conflict management, it renders its\r\ncontribution to peace and security through economic\r\ncooperation and through the implementation of so-\r\ncalled soft security measures. Since its transformation\r\ninto an international organization, BSEC has taken\r\nimportant steps towards the elaboration and promotion\r\nof projects enjoying a high level of regional\r\ncooperation and developmental impact in the BSEC\r\nregion. In that context, we welcome the report of the\r\nSecretary-General (A/59/303) which deals, inter alia,\r\nwith the cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nBSEC. We also support his recommendations that the\r\nUnited Nations and all specialized agencies,\r\norganizations and programmes of the United Nations\r\nsystem should continue to hold consultations with\r\nBSEC and formulate and implement programmes\r\npertaining to areas of common interest.\r\nIn conclusion, I welcome the presence among us\r\nof the Acting Secretary General of BSEC, Ambassador\r\nTugay Uluçevik, who will deliver a statement on behalf\r\nof the Organization.\r\nMr. Danesh-Yazdi (Islamic Republic of Iran):\r\nLet me begin by joining previous speakers in\r\nexpressing my appreciation to the Secretary-General\r\nfor his inclusive and informative reports submitted\r\nunder agenda item 56, entitled “Cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and regional and other\r\norganizations”. While we are discussing this agenda\r\nitem today, I wish to confine my remarks to the report\r\nthat deals with the cooperation between the United\r\nNations and three organizations with which the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran has the privilege of being more\r\nclosely associated, namely, the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference (OIC), the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization (ECO) and the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Organization (AALCO).\r\nRepresenting the Islamic world as its collective\r\nvoice, OIC is one of the largest intergovernmental\r\norganizations, the main aim of which is to enhance\r\nsolidarity and cooperation among all its members in\r\nvarious fields and to make an effective contribution to\r\nthe international community’s endeavours in pursuit of\r\npeace and development. Over the years, OIC has been\r\nengaged in constructive and fruitful cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations and other international\r\norganizations.\r\nIn the same spirit, we have noted the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s encouraging words on cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, which form a part of his report in\r\ndocument A/59/303. They indicate that, during the\r\nperiod under review, consultations at all levels\r\ncontinued to be conducted on a regular basis between\r\nthe United Nations and OIC on a wide range of issues,\r\nincluding those of a political, economic, social and\r\nhumanitarian nature.\r\nWe welcome the continuation of the effective\r\ncontacts and consultations between the United Nations\r\nand OIC on a number of highly important political\r\nissues, particularly those pertaining to Iraq,\r\nAfghanistan, Palestine and the Sudan. We also\r\nwelcome their cooperation in the past two years on the\r\nsubjects of conflict prevention and the fight against\r\nterrorism.\r\nIt is also encouraging to note that cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations system and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference is increasing in\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\na wide range of socio-economic areas of mutual\r\ninterest. In that context, the general meeting between\r\nthe two sides to evaluate the existing mechanisms of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and OIC and\r\ntheir institutions, which was held at the United Nations\r\nOffice at Vienna from 13 to 15 July 2004, was a\r\nwelcome initiative. It produced a number of proposals\r\nand decisions on a series of joint projects to be\r\nimplemented by the institutions in areas such as\r\nscience, technology, trade, food security, agriculture,\r\nhuman resources development, the environment,\r\nhealth, the arts and education.\r\nWe have also noted with satisfaction that the\r\nUnited Nations and its institutions have continued to\r\ncarry out joint activities and to exchange information\r\nwith the specialized and affiliated institutions and\r\nsubsidiary organs of the OIC, including the Islamic\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the\r\nStatistical, Economic and Social Research Training\r\nCentre for Islamic Countries, the Islamic Development\r\nBank and the Islamic Centre for the Development of\r\nTrade, in support of social, economic and cultural\r\ndevelopment. Given the ever-increasing importance of\r\nIslamic countries in the political, economic and social\r\nequations of today’s world, we firmly believe that the\r\nexpansion of cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the OIC has become all the more instrumental for\r\nthe maintenance of global peace and security.\r\nTurning to the issue of cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization (ECO), we found it encouraging that,\r\naccording to the report of the Secretary-General, the\r\nvarious bodies and specialized agencies of the United\r\nNations system and the secretariat of the ECO have\r\ncontinued their endeavours to expand the scope of their\r\ncooperation in a variety of areas. We believe that the\r\nexisting pace of cooperation, including on joint\r\nprogrammes and projects, between ECO and various\r\nUnited Nations bodies should be accelerated and\r\nencouraged within the United Nations system.\r\nIn that context, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme should be more involved in the area of\r\ncapacity-building with the ECO secretariat and its\r\nrelevant programmes. We have noted with satisfaction\r\nthat, in the period under review, cooperation between\r\nthe ECO and the United Nations Conference on Trade\r\nand Development in the area of transit transport has\r\nbeen expanding and, at the same time, continues to\r\nencompass the areas of regional investment and trade\r\nefficiency. The measures taken by the International\r\nTrade Centre to extend its technical cooperation to\r\nboost business and trade within the region, including\r\nby encouraging the participation of the business\r\ncommunity in exchanging views with the leaders of\r\nECO member States, has been a very useful initiative\r\nthat deserves proper attention.\r\nWe are pleased to learn from the report that the\r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific\r\n(ESCAP) continues to play an active role in the ECO\r\nregion through the provision of technical assistance,\r\ncapacity-building in the economic fields, the\r\nnetworking of trade and investment, information\r\nexchanges and multinational, multi-modal and transit\r\ntransport. Indeed, there are still enormous opportunities\r\nto extend such cooperation between ESCAP and the\r\nECO to other areas. The new phases of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme and the ECO to coordinate control over\r\nillicit drugs, the cooperation of the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund with ECO to address HIV/AIDS and\r\nadolescent health and the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization’s cooperation with the ECO in the\r\ndevelopment of the agricultural sector and food\r\nsecurity are but a few other samples of solid\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the ECO\r\nthat deserve to be welcomed and further strengthened.\r\nThe Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nOrganization (AALCO), is a dynamic body that\r\nprovides an opportunity to a large number of Asian and\r\nAfrican countries to actively contribute to the\r\nprevalence of the rule of law in international relations.\r\nIt has undertaken various studies on international legal\r\nsubjects of common concern to the two continents. In\r\ncooperation with the United Nations, that organization\r\nhas also played a significant role in harmonizing the\r\npositions of Asian and African countries with regard to\r\ninternational legal issues.\r\nAs the report of the Secretary-General illustrates,\r\nthe commitment of the AALCO to cooperate\r\neffectively with the United Nations system has\r\ncontinued in the period under review through\r\nsystematic and consistent analysis of the agenda items\r\nof the Sixth Committee and the International Law\r\nCommission. The commentaries and recommendations\r\nof the organization remain a source of knowledge for\r\nits member States in their deliberations on issues\r\nbefore the General Assembly and continue to be\r\nreflected, directly or indirectly, in the proceedings of\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nUnited Nations legal bodies. The wide range of topics\r\non the agenda of that consultative organization is a\r\nclear illustration of the capacity and resolve of the\r\norganization to contribute positively to collective\r\nefforts aimed at tackling the new challenges facing the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe AALCO continues to maintain on its agenda\r\nthe issues of refugees, trade law, crime prevention and\r\ncombating corruption, all of which also rank high on\r\nthe United Nations agenda. We are also pleased at the\r\nfact that, during recent years, new avenues have been\r\nidentified for improved and strengthened cooperation\r\nbetween the AALCO and United Nations programmes,\r\nspecialized agencies and relevant subsidiary bodies.\r\nWe hope that those efforts will produce a positive and\r\nfruitful outcome. Indeed, those developments should be\r\nwelcomed and further enhanced.\r\nWe need to mobilize all the resources and tools at\r\nour disposal to address the tremendous global\r\nchallenges facing humankind. Undoubtedly, the\r\nstrengthening of cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations is a key element in\r\nthat respect. My delegation believes that expanding\r\nrelations between the United Nations and regional and\r\nother organizations — including the OIC, the ECO and\r\nthe AALCO — through high-level contacts, regular\r\nconsultations and technical meetings could serve that\r\nnoble objective and contribute to the fulfilment of the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Tesfu (Ethiopia): At the outset, I would like\r\nto thank the Secretary-General for his report on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nand other organizations, contained in document\r\nA/59/303. We believe this debate will contribute to our\r\nefforts by helping us to review the achievements made\r\nthus far and by informing our decisions on future\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe close follow-up by the Secretary-General and\r\nthe Office of the Special Adviser on Africa has\r\ncontributed significantly to furthering the efforts of the\r\nAfrican Union. Specifically, the Office of the Special\r\nAdviser has made a special contribution to furthering\r\nthose efforts.\r\nThe United Nations has hosted a training\r\nprogramme on the drafting of the protocol on the\r\nestablishment of Peace and Security Council of the\r\nAfrican Union and of its rules of procedure. I would\r\nlike to recall that the Peace and Security Council was\r\nofficially launched in Addis Ababa in May 2004. The\r\nUnited Nations has also contributed to strengthening\r\nthe other structures of the African Union. We\r\nappreciate that and the other contributions provided by\r\nthe United Nations to our continental organization.\r\nEthiopia recognizes the United Nations for its\r\nconsistent engagement in peacekeeping operations in\r\nAfrica in general, and in the Horn of Africa in\r\nparticular. Ethiopia notes the fundamental change in\r\nthe perception and concept of peacekeeping operations,\r\nwhich now address issues such as the establishment of\r\nthe institutions needed to ensure the rule of law, the\r\nenforcement of human rights, the reintegration of\r\ntroops and internally displaced persons and the\r\nrehabilitation of infrastructure in countries emerging\r\nfrom conflict.\r\nAfrica still faces several conflict situations that\r\nare hindering progress towards peace, security and\r\nprosperity. We believe that the Peace and Security\r\nCouncil of the African Union will be a useful tool to\r\nincrease cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe African Union in the area of conflict prevention.\r\nThe African Union has also demonstrated its\r\nwillingness to tackle conflict in the continent, in\r\nsupport of the United Nations, through the deployment\r\nof forces in new and expanding peacekeeping\r\nactivities, both within the United Nations context and\r\nin the regional framework.\r\nIn conclusion, although there is a clear\r\ndemonstration of political will on the part of African\r\ncountries to confront the challenges, the African Union\r\nstill faces a shortage of financial and technical\r\nresources. We believe that improved cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations will facilitate the provision of the\r\nrequired assistance in all aspects.\r\nMr. Cools (Belgium) (spoke in French): During\r\nthis joint debate I should like to refer to sub-item (j) of\r\nagenda item 56, entitled “Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union”.\r\nBelgium attaches great overall importance to\r\nopening up our Organization’s work to the outside\r\nworld. Our debates in this forum, as well as the\r\nresolutions we adopt, would have no meaning unless\r\nthey were made known to public opinion and the civil\r\nsocieties of our countries. It is also important that our\r\nwork benefit from the contributions of civil society.\r\nGenuine revitalization of the General Assembly will\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nonly occur if we take into account that essential\r\nopening up.\r\nNational parliaments have a particular role to\r\nplay in civil societies. As representatives elected by the\r\nwhole of the population, parliamentarians serve in a\r\nsense as interpreters for the people. They are the link\r\nbetween the international and local levels, and between\r\nthe concerns and expectations of people around the\r\nworld and the decisions we take here.\r\nLet us not forget that the Charter begins with the\r\nwords “We the peoples of the United Nations”. Our\r\nOrganization must maintain contact with the peoples\r\nand continue to listen to them, in particular through\r\ntheir elected representatives. The Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion and the United Nations are important partners in\r\nthat regard. Belgium is pleased to note the incremental\r\nstrengthening in recent years in the cooperation\r\nbetween the two organizations, as can be seen in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report. We hope that that\r\ncooperation will continue to be strengthened in the\r\nfuture.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation attaches particular\r\nimportance to the holding, at New York in September\r\n2005, of the second Conference of Presiding Officers\r\nof National Parliaments, which will be a joint meeting\r\nwith the United Nations. We believe that it is important\r\nthat the Conference be held under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations in order to tangibly strengthen the links\r\nbetween the two organizations.\r\nBelgium fully supports the draft resolution\r\ncontained in document A/59/L.5, which was put\r\nforward by Chile and which we also have co-\r\nsponsored. In that regard, my delegation would like to\r\nemphasize that the text of the draft resolution was the\r\nsubject of extensive consultations and that it was\r\namended to take into account the views expressed\r\nduring those consultations. We therefore hope that the\r\ndraft resolution will be adopted by consensus.\r\nMr. Martirosyan (Armenia): First of all, I would\r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for the informative\r\nreports he has submitted to us.\r\nToday we are seeing that growing globalization\r\nalso has effects on international organizations. On the\r\none hand, those organizations complement each other’s\r\nactivities; and, on the other hand, they sometimes\r\noverlap and duplicate each other. We also see increased\r\ninvolvement on the part of international non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in current global\r\nprocesses, often competing with traditional\r\nintergovernmental bodies. At the same time, new\r\nthreats and challenges are emerging, forcing a review\r\nof the objectives and operational capacities of\r\ninternational and regional organizations. It is therefore\r\nnot surprising that almost all organizations are\r\ncurrently considering some kind of reform or review\r\nprocess to enable them to meet the challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century and adapt to new realities.\r\nThe issue of cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional and other organizations has now\r\nbeen considered by the General Assembly for many\r\nyears, and that discussion is expanding in scope and\r\nessence by gaining new inputs and ideas. That is a\r\nwelcome change that reflects current world\r\ndevelopments.\r\nWe have seen this agenda item grow, just as we\r\nhave seen an increase in the number of regional\r\norganizations. That is a reflection of the international\r\ncommunity’s acknowledgement of the importance of\r\nthose organizations, their complementary character and\r\nthe contributions they can make to our common efforts\r\naimed at finding solutions to global challenges.\r\nMoreover, that is a recognition that regional\r\norganizations bring knowledge and expertise pertinent\r\nto the region in which they are involved, with detailed\r\nand profound understanding of the developments in,\r\nand specificities of, their respective regions and,\r\nsometimes, even their ways of dealing with those\r\nproblems.\r\nArmenia has extensive cooperation with a\r\nnumber of the regional organizations under discussion\r\ntoday. I would like to touch upon several of them.\r\nThe priorities that are being dealt with in the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE) and the Council of Europe are concomitant\r\nwith the issues currently on the United Nations agenda.\r\nIn that context, we welcome the ongoing cooperation\r\nwithin the framework of the tripartite process of\r\ninformal consultations among the United Nations, the\r\nOSCE and the Council of Europe. Active cooperation\r\namong those regional organizations helps to address\r\nissues of concern locally and to advance the cause\r\nglobally.\r\nDuring the past 12 years, Armenia has developed\r\nvaluable cooperation with the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe. That cooperation\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\ncovers diverse areas: from mediation towards a\r\nresolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict to issues\r\nof economic and environmental dimension. It also\r\ncovers the subjects of security frameworks, assistance\r\nin electoral processes, anti-corruption activities and\r\nmany others.\r\nThe joint meeting in Armenia in May 2004 on\r\nenvironmental and security issues in the south\r\nCaucasus, organized by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme and the OSCE, was a good\r\nexample of cooperation between regional and\r\ninternational organizations in the region. The meeting\r\naimed at identifying areas where the decline in\r\nenvironmental protection could pose a threat to human\r\nsecurity and result in conflicting situations, creating\r\ninstability in the region.\r\nThe fight against corruption also seems to be a\r\nfeasible area for cooperation between the United\r\nNations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe. Major\r\nattention is given to this issue within the OSCE vis-à-\r\nvis newly independent States. In May 2003, Armenia\r\nhosted a national conference on the fight against\r\nmoney laundering and the financing of terrorism. That\r\nmeeting was organized by the Armenian Government,\r\nthe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the\r\nWorld Bank and the OSCE, in close collaboration with\r\nthe Council of Europe. Each of those organizations had\r\na valuable contribution to make in the fight against that\r\nscourge by applying their expertise and knowledge.\r\nThat was an excellent example of cooperation among\r\nthose organizations and Member States towards\r\nachieving common goals.\r\nAt the beginning of this year, Armenia assumed\r\nthe chairmanship of the OSCE Forum for Security\r\nCooperation for the first time. During our tenure in the\r\nChair, the security dialogue continued as an ingredient\r\nin the overall approach to confidence-building\r\nmeasures. There were extensive discussions on the\r\ndraft decision on standard elements of end-user\r\ncertificates and the verification procedures for the\r\nexport of small arms and light weapons. A decision\r\nwas also adopted on OSCE principles for export\r\ncontrols of man-portable air defence systems. Those\r\nissues are today becoming items for discussion in the\r\nFirst Committee.\r\nThe OSCE is one of the few organizations to deal\r\nextensively with conflict prevention and resolution. A\r\nnumber of regional conflicts are under its\r\nconsideration. One such conflict in need of peaceful\r\nsettlement is that of Nagorno-Karabakh, the resolution\r\nof which is one of the OSCE’s important mandates,\r\nexercised through the Minsk Group. The personal\r\nrepresentative of the Chairman-in-Office conducts\r\nmonthly monitoring in the area of the conflict and\r\npresents his monthly reports to the OSCE. The United\r\nNations and the Secretary-General also receive regular\r\nreporting on the situation by the Minsk Group.\r\nThe Nagorno-Karabakh peace process has its ups\r\nand downs, yet it seems to be picking up some speed\r\nnow. The Armenian Government fully supports the\r\nefforts of the co-chairpersons of the Minsk Group. We\r\nalso express our hope for a just and lasting solution to\r\nthat protracted conflict.\r\nSeveral statements emphasized the consequences\r\nof the conflicts in our region, often presenting a\r\ndistorted picture and ignoring their root causes.\r\nHowever, we think that the role of regional\r\norganizations such as the OSCE is to create a\r\nfavourable environment in which to address root\r\ncauses and eliminate the consequences of Stalinist\r\nnational policies. That would make possible the\r\nestablishment of durable peace and stability in the\r\nregion. We strongly believe that only a comprehensive\r\napproach to those complex issues will allow us to\r\novercome the totalitarian legacy.\r\nIn its conflict prevention and post-conflict\r\nrehabilitation efforts, the OSCE has accumulated vast\r\nexperience in the area of confidence-building\r\nmeasures. It is well known that implementation of such\r\nmeasures requires combined efforts and persistence to\r\nmove ahead. In that respect, the contribution of\r\nregional organizations in the establishment and\r\nadvancement of regional cooperation is exceptional.\r\nArmenia firmly believes that the rule of law and\r\nrespect for human rights are indispensable to achieving\r\nlasting peace, stability and security. In that regard, we\r\nattach particular importance to the work of the Council\r\nof Europe, which has unique experience in promoting\r\nthe universal values of human rights and democracy.\r\nWith the accession of all the States of the\r\nSouthern Caucasus to the Council of Europe, our\r\nregion has been embraced in the pan-European family.\r\nWe believe that membership has not only ensured the\r\nirreversibility of the democratic processes in individual\r\ncountries, but that it will also have far-reaching\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\npositive effects for the stabilization of the situation in\r\nthe region.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to welcome the\r\ncontinued cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe League of Arab States. I am pleased to inform the\r\nAssembly that Armenia is in the final stage of\r\nconsidering its observer status with that organization.\r\nIn that respect, I would like to thank all the countries\r\nthat rendered their support to us.\r\nMr. Shin Kak-soo (Republic of Korea): At the\r\noutset, I would like to express my heartfelt\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive report on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional and other organizations\r\n(A/59/303). The Republic of Korea has attached\r\nimportance to greater cooperation and interaction\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and other\r\norganizations. A holistic approach encompassing both\r\nglobal and regional perspectives is therefore vital if we\r\nare to fully address the many issues of common\r\nconcern.\r\nGlobal issues such as terrorism, the proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction and environmental\r\ndegradation are so far-reaching that they affect distinct\r\ngeographical regions in different ways. Accordingly,\r\nregional organizations are often well suited to offer\r\nregion-specific remedies and approaches that can\r\nreinforce global efforts to address those issues. In that\r\nregard, the United Nations should further continue to\r\npursue the strengthening of cooperation with regional\r\nand other organizations.\r\nI would now like to draw the Assembly’s\r\nattention to the regional organizations and\r\narrangements in East Asia that are of specific interest\r\nto us.\r\nAs a full dialogue partner of the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Republic of\r\nKorea welcomes increasing the interaction and\r\ninterface between the United Nations and ASEAN. The\r\nannual conference on conflict prevention, conflict\r\nresolution and peace-building that has been held jointly\r\nby ASEAN and the United Nations since 2001 is an\r\nexcellent example of close cooperation between the\r\ntwo institutions. Furthermore, we welcome and support\r\nthe decision of the ASEAN ministerial meeting this\r\nyear to give active consideration to requesting observer\r\nstatus at the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation sees great potential for close\r\ncooperation between ASEAN and the United Nations\r\non security matters. The ASEAN seminar held in\r\nJakarta in February this year discussed the idea of an\r\nASEAN security community. At that meeting, the\r\ndiscussion centred on how the United Nations could\r\nuse its extensive resources and experience to help\r\nASEAN strengthen its ability to deal with regional\r\nsecurity issues, including non-traditional issues. In our\r\nview, joint activities related to humanitarian assistance,\r\npreventive measures and an early warning system merit\r\nfurther consideration.\r\nMy country emphasizes the importance of the\r\npartnership between ASEAN and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) noted in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report. The ASEAN-UNDP\r\nPartnership aims to help narrow the development gap\r\nboth within ASEAN countries and between ASEAN\r\nand other regions of the world, as well as to integrate\r\nASEAN more broadly into the Asia-Pacific Economic\r\nCooperation, the World Trade Organization and other\r\nmultilateral institutions. We support that valuable\r\npartnership, which particularly focuses on bridging the\r\ndevelopment gap, and expect its continued\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe ASEAN Regional Forum currently assumes\r\nan important role in strengthening Asia-Pacific\r\npolitical and security cooperation. The Forum also\r\npursues increased cooperation with the United Nations\r\non political and security cooperation, particularly in\r\nthe areas of preventive diplomacy and peace-building.\r\nWe hope to see the Forum build up its capacity in\r\ncoordinating inter-Asian security matters, in close\r\npartnership with the United Nations.\r\nThe Republic of Korea strongly believes in the\r\nimportance of cooperation between the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU) and the United Nations.\r\nThe IPU, an excellent forum in which citizens’ voices\r\ncan be heard, has been an essential link between the\r\ncitizens of the world — as represented by their\r\nparliamentarians — and the United Nations. Moreover,\r\nnational parliaments play a vital role as the central\r\ninstitutions that adapt and translate global norms and\r\nagreements into domestic laws.\r\nIn that regard, we reaffirm our support for IPU\r\nefforts to provide greater parliamentary contributions\r\nand enhanced support to the United Nations.\r\nFurthermore, we fully endorse the IPU’s efforts to\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nconsult parliamentarians on the recommendations made\r\nby the Panel of Eminent Persons on United Nations-\r\nCivil Society Relations, in order to engage\r\nparliamentarians in the work of the United Nations in a\r\nmore systematic way.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation looks forward to\r\nincreased cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional and other international organizations with a\r\nview to reinforcing each other’s capacities and\r\nachieving synergistic outcomes.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In accordance\r\nwith resolution 44/6 of 17 October 1989, I give the\r\nfloor to the Secretary General of the Council of\r\nEurope, Mr. Terry Davis.\r\nMr. Davis (Council of Europe): I am proud to\r\nstand before the Assembly today as the new Secretary\r\nGeneral of the Council of Europe.\r\nThe United Nations and the Council of Europe\r\nshare the same goals. At the Council of Europe, we are\r\ncommitted to the ideals and principles enshrined in the\r\nfounding Charter of the United Nations. The cause of\r\nthe United Nations is the cause of the Council of\r\nEurope.\r\nThe Council of Europe today encompasses more\r\nthan 800 million men, women and children throughout\r\nour continent of Europe. Many live in societies in the\r\nthroes of rapid social, economic and political\r\ntransition. Many are abused and brutalized. Others are\r\nvictims of armed conflict and discrimination, and live\r\nin socially excluded and marginalized families. Their\r\nplight makes a mockery of social justice and human\r\nrights. The same applies to many more millions outside\r\nEurope.\r\nIn response, we must all join forces to build fair\r\nand free societies in which peace, human rights and the\r\nrule of law can flourish and thrive. These are global\r\nissues and global concerns; they call for global\r\nresponses. But if such responses are to be effective,\r\nthey must be based on grass-roots support. That is\r\nwhere the Council of Europe and other regional bodies\r\ncome in.\r\nLike the United Nations, the Council of Europe\r\nwas born out of the ashes of the Second World War.\r\nReconciliation, reconstruction and the prevention of\r\nnew conflicts are the hallmark of the Council’s\r\nstatutory mission. It was conceived as a structure to\r\nfoster ever greater unity among its member States, on\r\nan equal footing, through the widest possible\r\ncooperation and joint standard-setting.\r\nNot only does the Council of Europe share the\r\ncauses and concerns of the United Nations, but in many\r\nareas we have a common agenda. That is another\r\nreason why I am proud to address the Assembly today\r\nas the representative neither of the old Europe nor of\r\nthe new Europe, but of one Europe which shares a\r\ncommon commitment to make the world a better, fairer\r\nand safer place. I am equally proud to have listened to\r\nseveral members of the Council of Europe\r\nParliamentary Assembly who have already taken part\r\nin this debate and given it a parliamentary dimension.\r\nOne of the most striking examples of cooperation\r\nand complementarity between our two organizations in\r\nthe past was the conclusion in 1950 of the European\r\nConvention on Human Rights. The European\r\nConvention is directly and expressly derived from the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, and remains\r\none of the foremost examples of the implementation of\r\nthe Universal Declaration’s values on a regional level.\r\nToday, through the European Court of Human\r\nRights, it offers protection to people in all of our 46\r\nmember States. The Council of Europe brings together\r\nthose countries on the basis of a commitment to\r\nimplement, together, the principles of human rights,\r\nparliamentary democracy and the rule of law and of\r\nsharing collective responsibility for safeguarding and\r\npromoting those principles.\r\nIn the course of our work, we have developed\r\nexcellent cooperation with the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees and the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights on issues such\r\nas the status of refugees and the treatment of asylum\r\nseekers and displaced persons in Europe. Needless to\r\nsay, we stand ready to extend and deepen our\r\ncooperation with the United Nations in this field.\r\nOne of the gravest threats to human rights today\r\nis terrorism, which strikes indiscriminately across our\r\nplanet, as the people of New York and the staff of the\r\nUnited Nations know only too well. We in Europe also\r\ncarry the scars of terrorist attacks. During this year\r\nalone, terrible terrorist atrocities have been perpetrated\r\nin Russia, in Spain and in Turkey. Terrorism is not a\r\nnew experience for us, but the scale and ferocity of the\r\nmost recent attacks, coming so soon after the atrocities\r\nin Indonesia and other countries elsewhere in the\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nworld, have increased our determination to put the\r\ncampaign against terrorism at the top of our agenda.\r\nTerrorism requires intensive cooperation between\r\nGovernments and between international organizations,\r\nbut we must not use the need for partnership as an\r\nexcuse to neglect our individual responsibilities. The\r\nCouncil of Europe, for its part, has adopted a threefold\r\napproach based on increased legal cooperation, respect\r\nfor human rights and the promotion of intercultural and\r\ninterreligious dialogue.\r\nThe obligation to take appropriate measures to\r\nprotect fundamental human rights by trying to prevent\r\nterrorist attacks is reflected in 11 Council of Europe\r\nconventions, ranging from special measures to deal\r\nwith cybercrime and money laundering to a\r\nstraightforward attempt to combat that evil by means\r\nof an updated convention on the suppression of\r\nterrorism.\r\nOf course, combating terrorism requires a proper\r\nbalance between legitimate measures to counter\r\nterrorist acts and protect the lives of men, women and\r\nchildren on the one hand, and the need to protect other\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms on the other.\r\nThat is why the Council of Europe has also adopted\r\nspecial guidelines — the Guidelines on Human Rights\r\nand the Fight against Terrorism. They represent the\r\nfirst-ever international legal instrument on this issue.\r\nWe must defend the values for which we stand.\r\nWe must combat terrorism. But we must do so in\r\naccordance with international law, including the laws\r\naffecting human rights and the treatment of refugees. If\r\nwe behave like terrorists, we will destroy our own\r\ncredibility, we will descend to their level and we will\r\nincrease support for them.\r\nAs the Council of Europe’s Committee on the\r\nPrevention of Torture recently put it, any State that\r\nauthorizes or condones acts by its officials which\r\namount to either torture or inhuman or degrading\r\ntreatment diminishes its standing in the eyes of the\r\ninternational community. The same can be said of a\r\nState that makes use of statements that officials of\r\nanother country have obtained through resort to such\r\nacts.\r\nWe must be constantly vigilant if the absolute\r\nprohibition of torture is to be upheld. This is true not\r\nonly for Europe, it is true the world over. To abandon\r\nuniversally recognized values can only undermine the\r\nfoundations of democratic societies committed to the\r\nrule of law.\r\nThat is why the Council of Europe attaches so\r\nmuch importance to the International Criminal Court.\r\nIt is our firm position that the Court must have global\r\njurisdiction, and that no country should be exempt\r\nfrom it. Since the creation of the Court, the\r\nParliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has\r\nconstantly encouraged our member States and observer\r\nStates to ratify the Statute of the Court. Forty-four\r\nStates members of the Council of Europe have now\r\nsigned the Rome Statute, and 38 of them have ratified\r\nit. We expect the rest to do so in the near future.\r\nThe events of 11 September 2001 and subsequent\r\nevents, including the recent tragedy of Beslan, have\r\nalso underscored the need to address the rights of\r\nvictims and their families. That is why we are currently\r\nengaged in drafting additional guidelines in response to\r\nthis need, and I very much hope they, too, will provide\r\na point of reference. However, if we are to deal with\r\nthose factors which may encourage terrorism, we\r\ncannot do so in just one country or one continent. We\r\nmust break down cultural and religious barriers and\r\ntalk with each other to foster mutual understanding,\r\nreduce prejudice and promote a universal commitment\r\nto the same fundamental values.\r\nIn that context, at the Council of Europe we are\r\nstrengthening our cooperation with the League of Arab\r\nStates and the Organization of the Islamic Conference.\r\nOnly two weeks ago, the Director General of the\r\nIslamic Educational, Cultural and Scientific\r\nOrganization was in Strasbourg to launch a series of\r\njoint projects.\r\nDialogue is also a prerequisite for fighting racism\r\nand xenophobia. Here the Council of Europe has been\r\nparticularly active through our European Commission\r\nagainst Racism and Intolerance, which is an\r\nindependent watchdog dealing with human rights\r\nissues in those areas.\r\nThe forthcoming entry into force of Protocol No.\r\n12 to the European Convention on Human Rights,\r\nwhich includes a general prohibition on discrimination,\r\nis another important step by the Council of Europe. It\r\nwill implement the recommendations of the Durban\r\nWorld Conference against Racism.\r\nAnother milestone in the protection of human\r\nrights in Europe was the entry into force last year of\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nProtocol No. 13 to the European Convention on Human\r\nRights. This protocol committed our members to the\r\nabolition of the death penalty in all circumstances. I am\r\nproud to report to you today that since none of our 46\r\nmember States now resort to capital punishment, I am\r\nthe representative of a genuine death-penalty-free zone.\r\nWe look forward to the day when the representatives of\r\nother continents can say the same thing.\r\nThe Council of Europe is also active in many\r\nother areas, and, in several cases, cross-fertilization\r\nwith the United Nations has proved beneficial for both\r\nof us. I give only the four following examples of this:\r\nfighting trafficking in human beings; combating\r\nviolence against children and the sexual exploitation of\r\nchildren; upholding the rights and dignity of people\r\nwith disabilities; and promoting the participation of\r\nwomen in conflict prevention, conflict resolution and\r\npeace-building. In all these fields, we have worked and\r\nwill continue to work closely with the United Nations.\r\nHowever, promoting and defending human rights\r\nand the rule of law is not just a question of drawing up\r\nappropriate texts. What is of vital importance is\r\nensuring that they are implemented and apply to all.\r\nThat is why I welcome the recent agreement\r\nbetween the United Nations Interim Administration\r\nMission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Council of\r\nEurope on the application in Kosovo of the European\r\nConvention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman\r\nor Degrading Treatment or Punishment and our\r\nFramework Convention for the Protection of National\r\nMinorities. The conclusion of this agreement not only\r\nconfirms UNMIK’s commitment to the standards of the\r\nCouncil of Europe but will also allow our monitoring\r\nbodies to examine how UNMIK and the Provisional\r\nInstitutions of Self-Government have put these\r\nstandards into practice.\r\nOur European Committee for the Prevention of\r\nTorture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or\r\nPunishment will have unlimited access to any place\r\nwithin Kosovo where persons under the authority of\r\nUNMIK are deprived of their liberty. However, before\r\nwe can start our activities in Kosovo, similar\r\narrangements must be concluded with the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization for places of detention\r\nadministered by the Kosovo Force.\r\nTurning to other areas of our responsibility, I\r\nwould like to draw your attention to the fact that the\r\nCouncil of Europe is currently celebrating 50 years of\r\nEuropean cultural cooperation in support of democratic\r\nvalues. We have designated 2005 as the European Year\r\nof Citizenship through Education. The Year is intended\r\nto draw attention to the crucial contribution of\r\neducation, both formal and informal, the development\r\nof active citizenship, the quality of participation in a\r\ndemocratic society and the development of democratic\r\nculture. It will be the beginning of a sustainable\r\nprocess and is linked to the United Nations Decade of\r\nEducation for Sustainable Development and the United\r\nNations Decade for Human Rights Education.\r\nCooperation and interaction between our two\r\norganizations covers many other areas and locations. I\r\nshould certainly have said something about our\r\ncontacts with the United Nations Observer Mission in\r\nGeorgia, which has been in regular contact with the\r\nCouncil of Europe and has been most helpful to our\r\nvisiting delegations.\r\nI could have explained how, along with the\r\nOrganization for Security and Co-operation in Europe,\r\nwe meet annually with the United Nations. Allow me\r\nto say how much I am looking forward to being the\r\nhost for our next tripartite meeting in Strasbourg in\r\nFebruary, when we will look into how we can work\r\ntogether on promoting the rule of law and addressing\r\nsome of the threats to freedom of the media.\r\nI would have liked to have spent more time\r\ntelling you about the interest of the Parliamentary\r\nAssembly of the Council of Europe in strengthening\r\nthe United Nations as mapped out in a resolution\r\nadopted in February. Our parliamentarians welcome the\r\nforward-looking attitude of Secretary-General Annan\r\nand fully back the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change, which he set up. Our\r\nparliamentarians also advocate the introduction of a\r\nparliamentary dimension into the work of the General\r\nAssembly and a reform of the Security Council to\r\nmake it more representative.\r\nI must add a brief reference to the World Summit\r\non the Information Society, to which our Committee of\r\nMinisters addressed a message before last year’s\r\nGeneva meeting. We reaffirmed the indivisibility and\r\ninterdependence of all human rights and their\r\nimportance for democracy, the rule of law and\r\nsustainable development, and we underscored the\r\nCouncil of Europe’s determination to maintain and\r\nstrengthen these values in the development of the\r\ninformation society.\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nI could and should have said more about the\r\nimportance of migration and the role that multilateral\r\nbodies can play in building bridges and understanding\r\nbetween the cultures and peoples of the world. Like\r\nSecretary-General Annan, we wish to create a human\r\nrights framework that recognizes the disparities of\r\nwealth between the North and the South and that\r\nrecognizes the legitimate rights of people to migrate in\r\nsearch of a better life.\r\nAs I hope you have seen, the Council of Europe\r\nand the United Nations share the same goals. We are\r\nworking together to achieve them. Your cause is our\r\ncause.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In accordance\r\nwith General Assembly resolution 477 (V) of\r\n1 November 1950, I now call on the observer for the\r\nLeague of Arab States.\r\nMr. Mahmassani (League of Arab States) (spoke\r\nin Arabic): It is a pleasure for me to express my\r\nwarmest congratulations to you on your election to the\r\npresidency of the fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress my most sincere congratulations to the\r\npresident of the fifty-eighth session for his wise\r\nconduct of the work of the previous session. I would\r\nalso like to thank the Secretary-General for the report\r\npresented on the close multidisciplinary cooperation\r\nbetween the League of Arab States and the United\r\nNations in facing the dangers and challenges that\r\nthreaten world peace and security.\r\nThe League of Arab States and its specialized\r\nagencies believe that we must continue to strengthen\r\nand intensify cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the specialized agencies in all areas, as mentioned\r\nin the report of the Secretary-General (A/59/303). The\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nLeague of Arab States from 2002 to 2004 has covered\r\nall areas of activity, including a meeting between the\r\nUnited Nations and the League of Arab States and their\r\nspecialized agencies. A conference was also held on\r\nthe Arab States’ implementation of the United Nations\r\nProgramme of Action on the Illicit Trade in Small\r\nArms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects. The Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights set up an expert committee for the Arab region\r\nto comment on the Arab Charter on Human Rights,\r\nwhich was adopted at the Arab Summit held in May\r\n2004 in Tunis.\r\nThere has also been cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations, its funds and programmes and the\r\nLeague of Arab States in the areas of development and\r\npopulation and with the World Bank in the areas of\r\nhuman development and the infrastructure of\r\nknowledge. The International Civil Aviation\r\nOrganization, the Arab committee on civil aviation, the\r\nInternational Telecommunication Union, the World\r\nHealth Organization and the League of Arab States\r\nhave also continued to cooperate in a number of areas\r\nin which they are competent. An agreement between\r\nthe League of Arab States and the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) has been signed as well as a new\r\ncooperation programme that includes an agreement on\r\npractical activities in the area of promoting tolerance\r\nand dialogue and communication.\r\nThe League of Arab States has also participated\r\nin the United Nations programmes for the fight against\r\ndrug trafficking. We have held seminars to encourage\r\nthe adoption of international instruments to fight\r\nterrorism and the ratification of the United Nations\r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime and\r\nits Protocols. A sectoral meeting between the United\r\nNations and the Arab League on financing the\r\nMillennium Development Goals will take place in\r\nDecember in Italy.\r\nThe Arab League’s efforts to strengthen\r\ncooperation with the United Nations in all areas aim to\r\npromote consultations and the study of all possible\r\nways to apply the Organization’s resolutions, be they in\r\nthe area of disarmament, the fight against terrorism or\r\nthe peaceful settlement of conflicts.\r\nOne of the Arab League’s priorities is to find a\r\njust and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian\r\nconflict that would be in accordance with international\r\nlaw, the Madrid terms of reference, and the Arab peace\r\ninitiative, by strengthening cooperation between the\r\ntwo organizations to face up to global perils and\r\nthreats, to bring about peace and security in the region\r\nand to free the Middle East of nuclear weapons and\r\nother weapons of mass destruction in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions on the subject.\r\nCooperation between the League of Arab States\r\nand the United Nations is based on Arab heritage and\r\nculture, which call for tolerance and peaceful\r\ncoexistence with others.\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In accordance\r\nwith General Assembly resolution 35/2 of 13 October\r\n1980, I now call on the Secretary-General of the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Organization,\r\nMr. Wafik Kamil.\r\nMr. Kamil (Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nOrganization) (spoke in French): As Secretary-General\r\nof an Asian-African organization and as a son of\r\nAfrica, welcome the fact that you, Sir, a son of Africa\r\nyourself, are guiding the work of the General\r\nAssembly as it moves through a very critical period of\r\ndealing with hotspots and great challenges to the peace\r\nand security that are so sorely needed in order to\r\nensure development. I am confident that under your\r\npresidency, the Assembly will attain the noble purposes\r\nof this session.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAllow me also to pay a cordial tribute to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Julian Robert Hunte, President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. Since this\r\nagenda item is a biennial one, I was not here last year\r\nto congratulate him. Our full appreciation and gratitude\r\nalso go to Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his staff\r\nfor their continuous hard work and commitment.\r\nMr. Annan’s efforts towards global peace and stability\r\nare an inspiration to us all. We thank him for his\r\nexcellent report contained in document A/59/303,\r\nwhich gives clear guidelines for consideration of\r\nagenda item 56 (a) to (t).\r\nOn behalf of the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Organization (AALCO), it is a great\r\nhonour for me to address the General Assembly, which\r\nis rightly considered to be the parliament of world.\r\nThis session is taking place on the eve of the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations. As\r\nwe all know, the United Nations was set up at the end\r\nof the Second World War, primarily to save succeeding\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war. Despite the fact\r\nthat the scourge of war remains — with both inter-State\r\nand intra-State conflicts taking place in many parts of\r\nthe world, and with the rising menace of international\r\nterrorism — one can confidently assert, after reflecting\r\nupon the past six decades, that today the United\r\nNations, with its specialized agencies, is carrying out\r\ndiverse activities that are helping to realize the\r\naspirations and hopes of the peoples of the United\r\nNations in diverse areas. These include the promotion\r\nof human rights, assistance to refugees, protection of\r\nthe environment, the advancement of education,\r\nsecuring health for all, improving trade relations\r\nbetween States, and so forth, all with the ultimate aim\r\nof making our planet Earth a peaceful and a better\r\nplace to live for present and succeeding generations.\r\nThe United Nations, its specialized agencies,\r\nother international organizations and regional\r\norganizations are the only instruments available for\r\neffectively responding to the current challenges. The\r\ncomplexity of global problems has turned the United\r\nNations into a special setting for developing fruitful\r\ncooperation. Close cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations is a decisive factor\r\nin meeting the challenges faced by the international\r\ncommunity. That is where the raison d’être for\r\norganizations such as AALCO lies. AALCO has\r\nendeavoured since its inception to act as a forum for an\r\nexchange of views among Asian and African countries\r\non issues of international law and, to the extent\r\npossible, to strive to bring about consensus among\r\nmember States. This is not a fragmented approach of\r\nconfrontation, but rather a contributive and\r\ncollaborative effort to bring about equality among\r\nStates, based on just legal tenets.\r\nIn my view, it is indisputable that the significance\r\nof international law has increased many-fold since the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations. A crystal-clear\r\nreflection of that development is such that almost every\r\naspect of international significance is spoken in the\r\nlanguage of law. Therefore, the indispensability of the\r\nrule of law needs to be recognized by both weaker and\r\nstronger States. It also needs to be recognized that both\r\nby general and particular interests can be realized only\r\nthrough the framework of the rule of law. This has\r\nbeen repeatedly proved in the past despite certain\r\nsetbacks. However, there is a need to bridge the gap\r\nbetween the rhetoric and the reality.\r\nAs the Secretary-General of a regional legal\r\norganization, may I say that regional organizations are\r\nin a relatively better position to enable the United\r\nNations to benefit from their experience and capacity\r\non issues of common interest. They are indispensable\r\nfor managing issues at the regional and national levels.\r\nTherefore, I emphasize that cooperation between\r\nregional organizations and the United Nations should\r\nbe guided towards strengthening the capabilities of\r\nregional organizations. In that regard, I am proud to\r\nsay that relations between AALCO and the United\r\nNations in the past many decades have grown in\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nstrength, in consonance with the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter. To keep pace\r\nwith the changing times and requirements, I envision\r\nthe two organizations expanding and diversifying their\r\ncooperation through identifying new areas. We need to\r\nenhance and consolidate cooperation between AALCO\r\nand the United Nations in general, and within the\r\norganizations of the United Nations system in\r\nparticular.\r\nAs a regional organization, AALCO is dedicated\r\nto enhancing and contributing to the work of the\r\nUnited Nations, particularly in the field of international\r\nlaw and in the territory of two of the most populous\r\ncontinents of the world: Asia and Africa. The Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Organization now has 47\r\nmember States with a combined population of 4.2\r\nbillion. We realize that the synergy that AALCO has\r\nbeen able to forge with the United Nations, its\r\nspecialized agencies and other international\r\norganizations contributes immensely towards one of\r\nthe tasks entrusted to the General Assembly by Article\r\n13 of the United Nations Charter: “encouraging the\r\ndevelopment of international law and its codification”.\r\nMy endeavour today will primarily be to\r\nhighlight the various activities carried out by AALCO\r\nover the past two years and how AALCO has\r\ncontributed towards further strengthening cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations.\r\nAt the recently concluded forty-third session of\r\nthe organization, held in Bali, Indonesia, from 21 to\r\n25 June 2004, AALCO had 16 items on its agenda;\r\nprior to that, at the forty-second session of the\r\norganization, held in Seoul, Republic of Korea, from\r\n16 to 20 June 2003, it had 15 items on its agenda. All\r\nof those items were of contemporary relevance to\r\ninternational law. Owing to time constraints, it will not\r\nbe possible for me to elaborate on all of those topics;\r\nhowever, I would like to delve into AALCO’s work\r\nprogramme on some of those agenda items, which\r\nharmonize with the work of the United Nations system\r\nin many areas.\r\nConsideration of the work of the International\r\nLaw Commission is a statutory obligation for AALCO.\r\nSince its inception, AALCO has contributed to the\r\nwork of the Commission by presenting Asian-African\r\nperspectives. Secretariat reports on the work carried\r\nout by the Commission at its sessions contribute to\r\nthoughtful deliberations at AALCO’s annual sessions,\r\nwhich are further enriched by the participation of\r\nmembers of the Commission. The International Law\r\nCommission recognizes the significance of AALCO’s\r\ncontribution, and over the years the relationship\r\nbetween the Commission and AALCO has become\r\nextremely tight. An important initiative in that regard\r\nwas the convening of joint meetings of AALCO and\r\nthe Commission in conjunction with the AALCO Legal\r\nAdvisers Meeting that is held on the sidelines of\r\nGeneral Assembly sessions. Last year, the meeting\r\nfocused upon the Commission’s work on the subjects\r\nof the responsibilities of international organizations,\r\nshared natural resources and jurisdictional immunities\r\nof States and their property. The joint meeting for this\r\nyear is scheduled to take place on 10 November 2004,\r\nand we intend to deliberate on international liability for\r\ninjurious consequences arising out of acts not\r\nprohibited by international law, diplomatic protection\r\nand shared natural resources, in particular\r\ntransboundary waters. I do hope that the meeting of\r\nAALCO and the Commission on the sidelines of the\r\ncurrent Assembly session and those to come will gain\r\nin strength and become even more beneficial for\r\nAALCO’s member States.\r\nThe contribution of AALCO to the development\r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea is well recognized. Concepts such as exclusive\r\neconomic zones and archipelagic States had their\r\norigin in AALCO deliberations. More than 20 years\r\nafter the entry into force of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the law\r\nof the sea remains high on AALCO’s agenda, with our\r\nwork programme now focusing on developments\r\nwithin the institutions established by the Convention.\r\nAt our most recent session, held in Bali, we also\r\nreflected upon the process of amendment of the\r\nConvention, as set out in its article 312. The resolution\r\nadopted at that session requested me, inter alia, to\r\nstudy the feasibility of convening a special meeting of\r\nAALCO member States for the purpose of addressing\r\ndevelopment and implementation of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. Recently, we also\r\nentered into cooperative administrative arrangements\r\nwith the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea\r\nfor the mutual exchange of publications and to invite\r\nparticipation in each other’s meetings.\r\nAnother important item on our work programme\r\nconcerns the legal issues surrounding the Palestinian\r\nproblem. AALCO has not remained oblivious to the\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nquestion of Palestine; we have been carefully\r\nmonitoring it and have been updating our member\r\nStates on the developments in the region for nearly 30\r\nyears now. Serious concern and condemnation of\r\nviolent Israeli acts against innocent Palestinians were\r\nexpressed at both the Seoul and Bali sessions of\r\nAALCO. The recent advisory opinion of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, declaring the\r\nconstruction of the wall in the occupied territory to be\r\nillegal, clearly demonstrates on which side the legal\r\nright lies.\r\nInternational terrorism continues to threaten the\r\npeace and security of places where it occurs. In a\r\nglobalized world, it has become easier for the\r\nperpetrators of heinous acts of terror to strike at will.\r\nTerror erupts like a volcano in different parts of the\r\nworld and brings untold sorrow and suffering to all\r\nthose affected, whatever their nationality. Recent\r\nattacks in the Middle East, Spain, Indonesia, the\r\nRussian Federation, India and elsewhere bear ample\r\ntestimony to that fact. Words fail me in condemning\r\nthe onslaught on innocent civilians. No system of law\r\nor justice can justify those acts.\r\nThe fight against terror, as many of my\r\ncolleagues have said before me, cannot be fought in\r\nisolation. The sole solution lies in multilateralism.\r\nHowever, a definition of terrorism continues to elude\r\nthe international community and that, in turn, becomes\r\nan obstacle to the elaboration of a comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism. AALCO has\r\nbeen following the debate in the United Nations Ad\r\nHoc Committee for the elaboration of a comprehensive\r\nconvention on terrorism, as well as in the Security\r\nCouncil’s Counter-Terrorism Committee. AALCO\r\nhopes that ways and means will be found within United\r\nNations forums to achieve consensus on the issue, so\r\nthat the international community will have a firm legal\r\nfoundation for taking strong measures to combat real\r\nterrorism — as one among other transnational\r\ncrimes — through effective and collective international\r\nefforts. AALCO is working hard to find a draft\r\ndefinition for terrorism — to be sent to the Chairman\r\nof the Sixth Committee Working Group on this\r\nmatter — which will hopefully help to solve this\r\ntremendous obstacle.\r\nLet me now draw attention to the United Nations\r\nConvention against Corruption. Corruption is a global\r\nproblem, which poses a serious threat to the\r\ndevelopment of States and developing countries in\r\nparticular. Corruption, apart from affecting the public\r\nat large, also causes reduced investment, social\r\npolarization, lack of respect for the rule of law and\r\nhuman rights, undemocratic practices and the diversion\r\nof funds intended for development and essential\r\nservices. It also affects the ability of Governments to\r\nprovide basic services to their citizens and to\r\nencourage sustainable economic, social and political\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe United Nations Convention against\r\nCorruption is the first legally binding instrument on the\r\nissue with a global scope. It calls for States parties to\r\nenact implementing national legislation corresponding\r\nwith the Convention’s obligations.\r\nOne of the Convention’s groundbreaking features\r\nconsists of its provisions relating to the recovery of\r\nlaundered State assets. The implementation of those\r\nprovisions, if carried out both in letter and in spirit,\r\nwill go a long way towards fostering international\r\ncooperation aimed at curbing the menace of corruption.\r\nAALCO’s current work programme focuses on the\r\ncompilation of national anti-corruption legislation to\r\nestablish a network among law enforcement agencies\r\nand to assist member States in implementing the\r\nConvention. Plans are under way to organize a one-day\r\nspecial meeting on that topic during our forty-fourth\r\nsession, scheduled to take place in Kenya next year —\r\nwith, I hope, the active cooperation of the United\r\nNations, its specialized agencies and the African\r\nUnion.\r\nThe entry into force of the United Nations\r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime\r\ntook place in record time. The Convention, inter alia,\r\nemphasizes the role that regional organizations can\r\nplay in the attainment of its objectives. AALCO is\r\naware of the Convention’s importance in fighting the\r\nmenace of crimes such as drug trafficking and\r\ntrafficking in persons. We have been updating our\r\nmember States with regard to developments pertaining\r\nto the Convention and have been encouraging them to\r\nconsider becoming parties to the Convention and its\r\nthree Protocols.\r\nIn the light of the importance attached to the\r\nConvention, during the recently concluded 2004\r\nsession in Bali, a one-day special meeting on\r\nestablishing cooperation against trafficking in persons,\r\nespecially women and children, was convened with the\r\nfull support and participation of the Government of the\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nRepublic of Indonesia, the United Nations Office on\r\nDrugs and Crime, the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), UNICEF\r\nand the International Organization for Migration. The\r\nBali session mandated the secretariat with preparing\r\nmodel legislation to assist member States in enacting\r\nimplementing legislation for the Convention. At the\r\nfirst session of the Conference of Parties to the\r\nConvention and Its Protocols, held in Vienna from\r\n28 June to 9 July this year, the Organization actively\r\nparticipated as an observer. Views expressed by\r\nmember States and panellists during that special one-\r\nday meeting were submitted for the consideration of\r\nthe Conference and later adopted as a Conference\r\ndocument.\r\nUnder the auspices of the World Intellectual\r\nProperty Organization (WIPO), the development of a\r\nlegal regime for the international protection of\r\nexpressions of folklore is in progress. Therefore, I\r\npersonally proposed that member States consider\r\nincluding that topic on AALCO’s work programme.\r\nMy initiative found ready support among member\r\nStates, and that topic was extensively deliberated at the\r\nBali session for the first time. I believe that AALCO\r\ncan usefully contribute to the codification process now\r\nunder way in the Intergovernmental Committee on\r\nIntellectual Property and Genetic Resources,\r\nTraditional Knowledge and Folklore as part of the\r\nwork of WIPO.\r\nIntersessional activities are a very important\r\nelement of AALCO’s work programme. In cooperation\r\nwith United Nations agencies, two important seminars\r\nwere recently convened at our headquarters in New\r\nDelhi. In January 2003, mindful of the importance\r\nattached to children’s issues, we organized jointly with\r\nUNICEF a one-day seminar on the legal protection of\r\nchildren under international law. The discussion was\r\norganized under the following topics: the protection of\r\nchildren under the 1989 Convention on the Rights of\r\nthe Child and other related international instruments;\r\ninternational cooperation against trafficking in children\r\nand sex abuse; and the effective domestic\r\nimplementation of children’s rights and their protection\r\nthrough national legislation.\r\nAALCO’s refugee protection efforts —\r\nparticularly the 1966 Bangkok Principles on the Status\r\nand Treatment of Refugees and its revised consolidated\r\ntext of 2001 — are also well recognized. The topic of\r\nthe status and treatment of refugees has been included\r\non our work programme and agenda since 1963. In\r\nassociation with the UNHCR, AALCO organized a\r\ntwo-day seminar on strengthening refugee protection in\r\nmigratory movements, held on 17 and 18 October 2003\r\nin New Delhi. At Bali, member States entrusted me\r\nwith the mandate of preparing a study, with technical\r\nand limited financial assistance from the UNHCR,\r\nentitled “Statelessness: an overview from the African,\r\nAsian and Middle East perspectives”.\r\nThose are some of the ways in which AALCO has\r\nbeen contributing to the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations. However, despite the work of the\r\nOrganization, its specialized agencies and several\r\nregional organizations, the world is far from peaceful.\r\nMuch remains to be done so that we can create a\r\npeaceful and prosperous world for “we the people of\r\nthe United Nations”. The more than 6 billion people\r\nwho inhabit this planet have high hopes and aspirations\r\nthat the United Nations will ensure for them a peaceful\r\nand prosperous world in which the rule of law reigns\r\nsupreme.\r\nThe role of the United Nations has been\r\ncommendable in developing a normative framework\r\nwith respect to many fields, including economic and\r\nother relations. As I stated earlier, the common\r\ndenominator of international relations should be the\r\nability to function within the framework of a legal\r\norder that upholds the rule of law. Perhaps that task is\r\nenormous, but it is also essential. In that regard,\r\nAALCO will strive to contribute positively to the\r\nstrengthening of the Organization’s role by way of\r\nencouraging our member States to arrive at a consensus\r\non issues related to international law so that we can\r\nattain the common objective of truly establishing the\r\nrule of law in international relations.\r\nIn conclusion, long ago the French Revolution\r\nadopted the famous concept “liberty, equality,\r\nfraternity”. That slogan remains very valid, but I\r\nbelieve we should adapt it to our current needs and\r\nimplement it, beginning with fraternity, which will\r\ndefinitely lead us to equality. That, in turn, will pave\r\nthe way to a true liberty that is free from many of\r\ntoday’s scourges. Under the banner of the United\r\nNations, that work programme — “fraternity, equality,\r\nliberty” — will prove that the Organization remains the\r\nheadquarters of peace, hope and security for we the\r\npeople of the world.\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Before\r\nproceeding, I should like to inform members that the\r\nAssembly will take action on draft resolutions later this\r\nmorning, after we have heard all the speakers in the\r\ndebate. Therefore, perhaps we should try not to speak\r\nat too great a length — certainly not at greater length\r\nthan the heads of State or Government spoke during the\r\ngeneral debate.\r\nIn accordance with General Assembly resolution\r\n46/8 of 16 October 1991, I now give the floor to the\r\nobserver of the Caribbean Community.\r\nMr. Mohammed (Caribbean Community): On\r\nbehalf of the Secretary-General of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity, I have the honour to make the following\r\ncontribution to the debate on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional and other organizations.\r\nAs an organization bringing together 15 small\r\ndeveloping States, the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) places great importance on the United\r\nNations as the pre-eminent multilateral instrument\r\nthrough which, in the words of the Secretary-General,\r\ncommon solutions to common problems can be sought.\r\nConsequently, the Community’s continued cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations is a critical aspect of its efforts\r\nto attain its objective of improving the well-being of its\r\ncitizens and laying the foundation for the peaceful and\r\nsustainable development of all CARICOM member\r\nStates.\r\nIn July 2003 the Caribbean Community\r\nsecretariat attended the fifth high-level meeting\r\nbetween the United Nations Secretary-General and the\r\nheads of regional organizations. The main theme was\r\nthe new challenges to international peace and security,\r\nincluding international terrorism. The meeting also\r\ntouched on the less traditional threats such as poverty,\r\norganized crime and human rights violations, which\r\nform part of what we see as the multidimensional\r\nnature of security.\r\nLittle did we know that, a few months later, an\r\ninternal political crisis in one of our member States\r\nwould suddenly take on an international dimension and\r\nrequire the ministrations of the United Nations. In his\r\nreport to the General Assembly on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and other\r\norganizations (A/59/303), dated 1 September 2004, the\r\nSecretary-General highlights the role played by the\r\nregional organization CARICOM in seeking to help the\r\nHaitian parties find a political and peaceful solution to\r\nthe political impasse which would respect\r\nconstitutional dictates as well as regional and\r\nhemispheric commitments, and subsequently by the\r\nUnited Nations in seeking to stabilize the situation.\r\nThat effort at the pacific settlement of a local\r\ndispute by a regional agency, in keeping with Chapter\r\nVIII of the United Nations Charter, was a necessary\r\nthough ultimately searing experience for the\r\nCommunity. Its ripples continue to be felt, and\r\nconcerns linger.\r\nCARICOM continues to devote its time, energies\r\nand limited resources to a critical list of other issues of\r\nimmediate relevance to the Community.\r\nThe present situation of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity, and of the wider region, has been further\r\ncompounded by the ravages of a series of powerful\r\nhurricanes. Several States were severely affected, but\r\nthe most devastated were Haiti, Grenada and the\r\nCayman Islands. The human toll was most tragic in\r\nHaiti, where some 2,000 persons lost their lives and\r\nover 200,000 remain without shelter. In Grenada, in a\r\nmatter of a few hours, the development progress of a\r\nsmall but vibrant State was obliterated. That country’s\r\neconomic base of agriculture and services was entirely\r\nwiped out, and 90 per cent of its housing stock\r\ndestroyed. This was a grim demonstration of the fact\r\nthat the vulnerability of small States is not a mere\r\nconcept but a stark reality that threatens this category\r\nof member States — small island developing States —\r\nof the international community.\r\nI would like to take advantage of this opportunity\r\nto express the Community’s appreciation for the\r\nsolidarity displayed by the international community\r\nand by the United Nations and its specialized agencies,\r\nparticularly in their initial efforts to assist those States,\r\nbut also for the launching of the United Nations flash\r\nappeal for Grenada and Haiti. The various forms of\r\nassistance and emergency relief thus provided have had\r\na multiplier effect by generously supplementing the\r\nefforts of the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response\r\nAgency (CDERA), whose resources, as well as the\r\nCommunity’s, have been stretched to the breaking\r\npoint by the magnitude of the devastation.\r\nAt the same time, it is also quite clear that the\r\nCommunity’s emergency response capacity has\r\nbenefited from cooperation with the United Nations in\r\nthe domain of disaster management. Over the past four\r\nyears, this cooperation with the United Nations system\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nhas taken place within the context of the development\r\nand the implementation of a framework that links\r\ndisaster management to sustainable development. The\r\napplication of information and communication\r\ntechnologies in disaster management is seen as a\r\ncritical area for development.\r\nThe establishment of the CARICOM Single\r\nMarket and Economy (CSME) is one of the key\r\npriorities of the Community. That undertaking seeks to\r\ncreate a seamless economic space by the end of 2005\r\nallowing for the free movement of the key factors of\r\nproduction — persons, capital, goods and services.\r\nNew institutions will have to be established, key\r\namong which is the Caribbean Court of Justice, and\r\nnew principles implemented. The Court will require\r\nenabling domestic legislation and, in some member\r\nStates, constitutional amendments, a potential source\r\nof delay. Financing arrangements have been put in\r\nplace to ensure the complete independence of the\r\nCourt. The Regional Judicial and Legal Services\r\nCommission, established last year, has since appointed\r\nthe President of the Court. In its original jurisdiction,\r\nthe Court will adjudicate disputes arising from the\r\noperations of the single market and single economy.\r\nThe support of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) has enabled the Community to\r\nmake progress in the establishment of the Court as well\r\nas to initiate a process of administrative reform at the\r\nnational level. The structures and systems of\r\ngovernance within the Community are also under\r\nreview to facilitate the workings of the CSME.\r\nThe need for a strong and vibrant single market\r\nand economy has been amply demonstrated as the\r\nregion faces new challenges to its traditional export\r\nindustries. The sugar industry, which has been the\r\nbackbone of the economic, fiscal, social and political\r\nwell-being in several of our member States, has now\r\njoined the banana industry as the latest victim of an\r\nadverse World Trade Organization (WTO) decision.\r\nThe ravages of the series of hurricanes on our tourism\r\nindustry also points to difficult economic times ahead.\r\nAt the same time, the region is negotiating in a number\r\nof theatres for improved market opportunities and\r\ntrading rules that accommodate the special\r\ncircumstances of small, vulnerable economies.\r\nIn June this year, CARICOM joined in the\r\ncelebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD), the United Nations institution which puts\r\nthe well-being of the developing countries at the centre\r\nof its work programme. We hope that the decisions\r\ntaken on that landmark occasion will be implemented\r\nto the benefit of all our peoples.\r\nIn that regard, the wise words of the outgoing\r\nSecretary-General of that institution are most pertinent:\r\n“In order to integrate developing countries\r\nfully into the world trading system, we need not\r\nonly successful trade negotiations but we must\r\nalso address what has been called the problem of\r\nthe ‘dark side of the moon’ — the supply-side\r\nconstraints”.\r\nThe countries of the region have emphasized the\r\nmultifaceted nature of security and have called on the\r\ninternational community to pursue an integrated\r\napproach in resolving the security issues affecting\r\nStates. While a new emphasis has been placed on\r\nterrorism — and that concern should not be\r\ndownplayed — other issues affecting the security of\r\nsmall States remain critical to the region’s\r\ndevelopment.\r\nHuman resource development and capacity-\r\nbuilding are seen as critical components of the\r\nCommunity’s efforts to better position itself in the\r\nglobal environment by developing strategic vision,\r\nskills and knowledge and by delivering improved\r\nservices and effective management. It is critical to have\r\nsuch capacity-building in the domain of information\r\ntechnology in order to bridge the digital divide.\r\nCARICOM looks forward to further cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations in the area of training and\r\nknowledge management.\r\nIn the area of health, CARICOM appreciates the\r\nsignificant support it receives from the United Nations\r\nsystem, especially with respect to the fight against the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic. The Joint United Nations\r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS has worked closely with the\r\nPan-Caribbean Partnership against AIDS in the fight\r\nagainst that scourge, with the assistance of other\r\ndonors. Important aspects of that approach have been\r\nto strengthen institutional capacity, prepare national\r\nplans for access to care and treatment for affected\r\npersons and promote the social inclusion of people\r\nliving with HIV/AIDS. The Pan-Caribbean Partnership\r\nhas also benefited from the support of agencies of the\r\nUnited Nations system through the interface with\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nmajor pharmaceutical companies to negotiate cheaper\r\nprices for antiretroviral drugs.\r\nThe Community’s response to those and other\r\nissues form part of the report prepared and submitted\r\non implementation of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. The CARICOM Secretariat wishes to express its\r\nappreciation to the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme for its assistance to the region in preparing\r\nthat report.\r\nThe Community is fully engaged in preparations\r\nfor the International Meeting to Review the\r\nImplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action,\r\nto be held in Mauritius from 10 to 14 January 2005.\r\nMuch has already been said in the general debate about\r\nthe importance that the CARICOM States and all small\r\nStates attach to the high-level participation of all\r\nUnited Nations Member States in order to reaffirm the\r\ninternational community’s political commitment to the\r\nProgramme of Action and advance towards\r\nimplementation of the goals established in the\r\nProgramme.\r\nThe Caribbean Community looks forward with\r\nconfidence to continued close collaboration with the\r\nUnited Nations system, which has been a supportive\r\npartner in the region’s efforts to improve the well-\r\nbeing of its people.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In accordance\r\nwith General Assembly resolution 55/161, of\r\n12 December 2000, I call upon the observer of the\r\nEconomic Community of Central African States.\r\nMr. Cosme (Economic Community of Central\r\nAfrican States) (spoke in French): As I am taking the\r\nfloor for the first time at the fifty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Economic Community of\r\nCentral African States (ECCAS) would like to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your outstanding election to\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nninth session. I also congratulate your predecessor,\r\nMr. Julian Hunte, for the manner in which he led the\r\nwork of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nsession.\r\nWe also express our appreciation and thanks to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for the support the\r\nUnited Nations has lent to the process of regional\r\nintegration in Africa, in particular in Central Africa. In\r\nthat regard, we note with satisfaction that the latest\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and regional and other\r\norganizations (A/59/303) stresses the need for the\r\ninternational community to help ECCAS to achieve\r\neconomic integration and to implement its programmes\r\nfor peace and security.\r\nSir, we are convinced that your intrinsic qualities\r\nand long experience in international affairs will ensure\r\nthat, under your leadership, the General Assembly will\r\nrecover the vitality that, in the past, enabled it to leave\r\nits mark on the history of the United Nations, in\r\nparticular in the area of peacekeeping and in ensuring\r\nthat Central Africa and the entire African continent\r\nwill be well represented through you.\r\nSir, your election to preside over the Assembly\r\ncomes only a few years after the Assembly granted\r\nECCAS observer status under resolution 55/161 of\r\n12 December 2000. That strengthens our conviction\r\nthat the United Nations has truly integrated Central\r\nAfrica as part of its priorities. In that context, ECCAS\r\nwelcomes the fact that the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States and the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community have been accorded observer\r\nstatus in our universal Organization.\r\nOur main objective in taking the floor in the\r\nAssembly today is to refer to the cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and Central Africa as represented\r\nby ECCAS. In that context, we recall that in June 2003,\r\na multidisciplinary mission of the United Nations, led\r\nby the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs,\r\nvisited our country in order to determine the main lines\r\nof a multifaceted assistance for our subregion. The\r\nUnder-Secretary-General presented his report to the\r\nSecurity Council and, consequently, our organization\r\nwould like to know what the follow-up would be to the\r\nrecommendations made in his report.\r\nCentral Africa is a potentially rich region, but it\r\ncontinues to face armed conflicts and the even more\r\ndisturbing situation resulting from the fragility of our\r\neconomies and growing poverty. However, I would like\r\nto stress that significant progress has been made in\r\nrestoring peace and security in our subregion. Central\r\nAfrica has seen the number of its serious conflicts\r\nreduced over the last two years. Currently, only 3 of 11\r\ncountries face relatively serious crises: Burundi, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Chad. A short\r\ntime ago, 7 of the 11 countries were suffering crises.\r\nThat encouraging trend should be followed with\r\ninterest and should gain the support of the international\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\ncommunity in order to prevent new types of tension\r\nfrom arising and further destabilizing our region. This\r\nis why we should pay all due attention to the\r\ninstitutional crisis that affected the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe last year and to the\r\ninternational mercenary situation in the Republic of\r\nEquatorial Guinea during the first quarter of this year.\r\nThe ongoing border disputes and cross-border\r\nhumanitarian crises such as that currently on the border\r\nbetween Chad and the Sudanese province of Darfur are\r\nbut a few of the situations that continue to be of great\r\nconcern to us. In this respect, through the Council for\r\nPeace and Security in Central Africa, a collective\r\nsecurity mechanism for Central Africa, we plan to\r\nspecifically emphasize the prevention of conflicts, the\r\npromotion of political dialogue and mediation, the\r\nmonitoring of elections and good governance, with the\r\nhope of being able to adequately deal with peace,\r\nsecurity and socio-economic development.\r\nThe United Nations Economic Commission for\r\nAfrica, in its 2004 report on the African economic\r\nsituation, stresses that only five African countries have\r\nachieved the objective of the 7 per cent economic\r\ngrowth required to reduce poverty. Among those\r\nStates, three are members of ECCAS, namely, Angola,\r\nEquatorial Guinea and Chad. The two others are\r\nBurkina Faso and Mozambique. Peace is thus the\r\nindispensable prerequisite for economic growth.\r\nOn a social and economic level, real efforts are\r\nbeing undertaken in our States, but such efforts still do\r\nnot allow us to achieve the results hoped for,\r\nparticularly in the fight against poverty. The\r\nunemployment rate among young people is still very\r\nhigh, while AIDS and malaria continue to spread and\r\nto affect the most active parts of our society.\r\nCompetition among a growing population is\r\nincreasingly harsh for access to resources that are less\r\nand less abundant.\r\nIn order to face these various challenges,\r\nECCAS’ highest authorities have recommended the\r\nimplementation of several sectoral policies, including\r\nin the following areas: prevention and resolution of\r\nconflicts, food security, agricultural development and\r\nthe environment, the development of commercial\r\ninfrastructure and trade, energy, new information and\r\ncommunication technologies, gender, the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS, and the implementation of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development, which we will\r\nbe following up in Central Africa.\r\nThe implementation of these guidelines has had\r\nencouraging results in some areas, as exemplified by\r\nthe ongoing fruitful dialogue among ECCAS, the\r\nUnited Nations and the European Union with a view to\r\nmaking the early warning mechanism for Central\r\nAfrica operational, the progressive opening up of the\r\nborders of ECCAS member States to the citizens of\r\nother member States of the Community as part of the\r\nfree circulation of persons, the launching of a free\r\ntrade area on 1 July 2004 and the creation of an energy\r\npool for Central Africa.\r\nThe challenges are enormous, certainly, but the\r\nnecessary political will does exist. The priority areas\r\nidentified during the recent mission of the United\r\nNations Department of Political Affairs to ECCAS\r\nshould allow us, in the long term, to provide the\r\nfollowing: training in the collection and analysis of\r\npolitical information for the personnel of the\r\noperations centre of ECCAS’ early warning mechanism\r\nfor Central Africa; assistance and training in election\r\nsupervision, so that ECCAS staff can monitor elections\r\nin member States; training in cartography, to allow\r\nECCAS to make a decisive contribution to solving\r\ncross-border disputes among its member States; the\r\nsupport of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations\r\nin planning the next multinational military exercise,\r\n“Bahr-el-Ghazel”, which ECCAS will be organizing in\r\n2005 in Chad; and the establishment of a subregional\r\noffice of the United Nations in Central Africa to\r\nfacilitate cohesion and subregional integration and put\r\nan end to conflicts affecting the subregion.\r\nNeedless to say, the assistance that we are\r\nrequesting from our partners is to help Central\r\nAfrica — the bridge between the other regions of the\r\ncontinent — become an area of peace, dialogue and\r\nprosperity, attributes which are essential in the process\r\nof integration and in Africa’s development. ECCAS\r\ntherefore launches an appeal to this Assembly, as we\r\nhave in the past, to adopt the draft resolution on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and ECCAS,\r\nto be presented by the Republic of Congo, which\r\ncurrently holds the presidency of our Community.\r\nFinally, we express the wish that within the\r\ngeneral context of the reform of the United Nations,\r\ncooperation between subregional organizations and the\r\nUnited Nations be reinforced to a greater extent, with a\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nview to facilitating a more effective contribution by\r\nregional economic communities to the realization of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In accordance\r\nwith General Assembly resolution 54/5 of 8 October\r\n1999, I now call on the acting Secretary-General of the\r\nBlack Sea Economic Cooperation Organization,\r\nMr. Tugay Ulucevik.\r\nMr. Ulucevik (Black Sea Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization): It is indeed a privilege and a singular\r\nhonour for me to represent the Black Sea Economic\r\nCooperation Organization (BSEC) at the fifty-ninth\r\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly and to\r\naddress the Assembly. At the outset, I would like to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, upon your election as President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session.\r\nThe foundations of BSEC were laid in 1992 as a\r\npolitical initiative for economic cooperation in the\r\nwake of the tremendous changes that had taken place\r\nin the world. The winds of change continue to blow at\r\nthe dawn of the twenty-first century and are, indeed,\r\nbecoming stronger. The process of globalization, with\r\nall its consequences, is under way.\r\nThe members of the international community are\r\nbecoming increasingly interdependent in economic and\r\ntechnical terms. New dangers and challenges threaten\r\nthem all equally. They are becoming increasingly\r\naware that international terrorism is indiscriminate in\r\nits targets and seeks to undermine their common\r\nvalues. Based on their awareness that our globe is\r\nundergoing an important phase of adaptation to new\r\nrealities, opportunities and challenges, the member\r\nStates of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation took the\r\nhistoric step of transforming that political initiative\r\ninto a full-fledged international organization.\r\nUpon the ratification of its charter on 1 May\r\n1999, BSEC was born with a legal identity on the\r\ninternational scene. Its Permanent International\r\nSecretariat is based in Istanbul, Turkey. With the recent\r\naccession of Serbia and Montenegro, BSEC now\r\ncomprises 12 member States, with a geographical area\r\ncovering the Balkans, the States bordering the Black\r\nSea and the Caucuses.\r\nAt its fifty-fourth session, the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly, through resolution 54/5 of\r\n8 October 1999, granted observer status to BSEC, a\r\nlandmark development that enabled BSEC to take its\r\nplace in the family of international organizations.\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 55/211 of 20 December\r\n2000, on cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nBSEC, opened up new avenues for BSEC to develop\r\ncooperation or working relationships with other\r\norganizations within the United Nations system and\r\nbeyond. The Black Sea Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization (BSEC) has signed cooperation\r\nagreements with the United Nations Economic\r\nCommission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP) and the United\r\nNations Industrial Development Organization\r\n(UNIDO).\r\nBSEC has also developed cooperation with the\r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United\r\nNations (FAO), World Trade Organization (WTO),\r\nWorld Tourism Organization and World Bank. The\r\nprocess of establishing a formal framework for\r\ncooperation between BSEC and the World Bank and\r\nFAO is in progress.\r\nAt this point I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\r\nfactual report contained in document A/59/303, which\r\ndeals, inter alia, with the status of the cooperative\r\nrelationship between BSEC and various United Nations\r\norganizations during 2003 and 2004. We appreciate his\r\nrecommendation that the United Nations, the\r\nspecialized agencies and other organizations and\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations system should\r\ncontinue to hold consultations with BSEC and\r\nformulate and implement joint programmes pertaining\r\nto fields of common interest.\r\nThe BSEC member States, wishing to be in a\r\nbetter position to meet the challenges of the era of\r\nglobalization and the information age, adopted the\r\nBSEC Economic Agenda in April 2001. Its main goal\r\nis to strengthen, through a project-based approach,\r\nexisting collaboration and to expand it into new fields.\r\nThe Project Development Fund was established\r\nin October 2002 in keeping with the project-based\r\napproach embodied in the BSEC Economic Agenda. Its\r\npurpose is to facilitate the development and promotion\r\nof projects involving high regional cooperation and\r\nwith development impact in the BSEC region at the\r\nearly stages of their conception. The Fund is\r\nconstituted on the principle of voluntary contributions\r\nfrom the BSEC member States, the Black Sea Trade\r\nand Development Bank and other BSEC-related bodies\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nand BSEC observers. Contributions from outside\r\ndonors are also welcomed. Following the entry into\r\nforce this year of the Manual of Operations of the\r\nBSEC Project Development Fund, the project-\r\ngenerating mechanism of BSEC has begun operating\r\nand is showing great promise. I wish to avail myself of\r\nthis opportunity to appeal to all international financial\r\ninstitutions, multilateral and bilateral donors and to\r\nStates enjoying observer status in BSEC to explore the\r\npossibility of contributing to the activities of the BSEC\r\nProject Development Fund financially and in the form\r\nof technical assistance.\r\nBSEC aims at contributing to regional and\r\ninternational peace, security, stability and welfare by\r\ndeveloping economic and trade relations between the\r\nmember States of the organization. BSEC represents a\r\nforum for discussion and cooperation on areas ranging\r\nfrom energy to transportation, trade and economic\r\ndevelopment, the environment, tourism, agriculture,\r\nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises, combating crime,\r\nterrorism, emergency relief and mitigation of the\r\naftermath of natural and man-made disasters.\r\nAs a regional economic organization, BSEC is\r\nnot directly involved in peacekeeping and conflict\r\nmanagement. It renders its contribution to peace and\r\nsecurity through economic cooperation and by\r\nimplementing so-called soft security measures. Besides\r\nthose, the Agreement among the Governments of the\r\nBSEC Participating States on Cooperation in\r\nCombating Crime, in particular in its Organized Forms\r\nand its Additional Protocol has already entered into\r\nforce. The Additional Protocol on Combating\r\nTerrorism has been finalized and is expected to be\r\nsigned in March 2005 in Bucharest.\r\nOn 25 June of this year the BSEC Council of the\r\nMinisters of Foreign Affairs met in a special session in\r\nIstanbul and adopted by consensus a statement on the\r\nBSEC contribution to security and stability. In that\r\nstatement, BSEC members denounced and condemned\r\nall acts of terrorism, some of which have also been\r\nperpetrated in recent years on the territories of BSEC\r\nmember States. They stated that terrorism cannot be\r\nassociated with any religion, ethnic group or\r\ngeographic area and that there can be no justification\r\nfor terrorism whatsoever.\r\nThe entire world, and first and foremost the\r\nmember States of BSEC, was shocked and deeply\r\nsaddened by the dastardly act of terrorism perpetrated\r\nagainst children and other civilians in the Russian town\r\nof Beslan. The BSEC Chairman-in-Office, the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Georgia, promptly issued a\r\nstatement on behalf of the BSEC member States and\r\ncondemned in the strongest possible terms terrorism in\r\nall its forms and manifestations.\r\nWe once again pay homage to the innocent\r\nvictims of this and many other previous despicable acts\r\nof terrorism.\r\nOver the past decade, the BSEC region has\r\nbecome an integral part of the European political and\r\neconomic landscape. Moreover, the whole BSEC\r\nregion has become the immediate neighbour of the\r\nenlarged European Union (EU) as of 1 May 2004. This,\r\nindeed, is a landmark development with far-reaching\r\nconsequences.\r\nAt present, one BSEC member State, namely\r\nGreece, is also a member of the EU. Three other BSEC\r\nmembers, namely, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey will\r\njoin the EU as full members in the near or not too\r\ndistant future. Consequently, the boundaries of the\r\nenlarged EU will also cover a significant part of the\r\nBSEC region, including a long coastline along the\r\nBlack Sea. Thus, the EU will become a major Black\r\nSea player. Mention should also be made in this\r\ncontext of the fact that the Black Sea region is\r\nbecoming Europe’s major transportation and energy\r\ntransfer corridor.\r\nThe Black Sea Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization serves as a model of cooperation,\r\nbringing together countries belonging to different\r\ncultures and varying histories, through cooperative\r\nactivities that bridge differences and develop a\r\ncommon vision for the future of the region. This will\r\nhelp BSEC assert its place and role in the new\r\nemerging European architecture.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to thank, on\r\nbehalf of my secretariat, those representatives who, in\r\ntheir statements on the agenda sub-item under\r\nconsideration, made references to BSEC and\r\nhighlighted its role, activities and relationship with the\r\nUnited Nations system. I wish also to pay tribute to the\r\nPermanent Mission of Georgia, representing the current\r\nChairman-in-Office of BSEC, for initiating\r\nconsultations on a draft resolution to be submitted to\r\nthe General Assembly on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and BSEC. I appeal to Members for its\r\nadoption by consensus when it comes before this body.\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nAn action by the General Assembly based on the\r\nrecommendation of the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral will give new impetus to BSEC’s cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations and its specialized agencies\r\nand others in the pursuit of the lofty objectives and\r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations, as well as those of the Black Sea Economic\r\nCooperation Organization. BSEC will continue to play\r\nits role with determination to strengthen multilateral\r\ncooperation to meet the global challenges of this\r\nmillennium.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In accordance\r\nwith the General Assembly resolution 33/18 of\r\n10 November 1978, and decision 53/453 of\r\n18 December 1998, I now call on the observer for the\r\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie.\r\nMr. Bouabid (International Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie) (spoke in French): The International\r\nOrganization of la Francophonie (OIF) has consistently\r\nsought to develop its synergy with the United Nations,\r\ngiven the two organizations’ common objectives,\r\ncomplementary mandates and respective comparative\r\nadvantages.\r\nToday, at a time when the international\r\ncommunity must reaffirm the authority of the United\r\nNations and its capacity to act, we deem crucial any\r\ncontribution to helping the United Nations attain the\r\ngoals and purposes set out in the Charter. Regional\r\norganizations, including the one I have the honour of\r\nrepresenting, have demonstrated that their particular\r\ncontributions can be useful and relevant.\r\nLast November President Abdou Diouf,\r\nSecretary-General of the International Organization of\r\nla Francophonie, made an official visit to the United\r\nNations. He emphasized the OIF’s firm commitment to\r\nmultilateralism, pluralism and consultation and\r\nrecalled the determination of the French-speaking\r\ncommunity to see the United Nations play a central\r\nrole in international relations.\r\nOur cooperation with the United Nations is now\r\nwell established. Its quality is being enhanced and it\r\ncovers more areas, and the number of countries\r\ninvolved is increasing. We are pleased that the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations acknowledged\r\nthis fact, and we are grateful to him for his personal\r\nefforts to ensure that cooperation further develops.\r\nSeveral delegations have taken the floor during\r\nthis debate to reiterate their satisfaction at the positive\r\nmanner in which this cooperation has developed. We\r\nare grateful to them for their ongoing support, and we\r\nwill continue to ask for their assistance in order to\r\nachieve even greater progress, as we all are aware that,\r\nin the final analysis, the beneficiaries of the process\r\nwill be the peoples of our Member States.\r\nOur cooperation is encompassing more and more\r\nareas: peace, security, support for democracy, human\r\nrights and the rule of law, and economic and social\r\ndevelopment. In July 2003, the OIF participated in the\r\nfifth high-level meeting of the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations on new threats to peace and\r\nsecurity. Following up on that meeting, last April the\r\nOIF held a joint workshop with the United Nations on\r\nearly warning and conflict prevention. Cooperation\r\nbetween our two organizations in that area is ongoing\r\nand will culminate, as noted in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General, in the holding of an international\r\nseminar on the same topic. Our objective is to\r\nelaborate agreed, practical recommendations aimed at\r\nputting in place early-warning operational procedures\r\nto help promote conflict prevention more effectively.\r\nRegional actors, including subregional organizations\r\nand civil society, will, of course, also be involved with\r\nthe workshop.\r\nThe OIF provides ongoing support for the United\r\nNations and uses the United Nations system in order\r\nbetter to work for peace and stability in its member\r\nStates. Side by side with the United Nations and the\r\nrelevant regional organizations, we are working for\r\nreconciliation and stability in many of our member\r\ncountries: Comoros Islands, Côte d’Ivoire, the Central\r\nAfrican Republic, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and Haiti, where we are working with the rest\r\nof the international community to bring about a\r\npeaceful settlement and a swift return to stability and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nSuch efforts are aimed also at the mobilization of\r\nour member States aimed at their greater participation\r\nin the new peacekeeping operations established by the\r\nUnited Nations this year in certain French-speaking\r\ncountries. Our Secretary-General, together with the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, has asked the\r\ncountries of the French-speaking community to make\r\navailable French-speaking civilian police troops and\r\ncontingents to peacekeeping operations in Haiti, Côte\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nd’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nBurundi.\r\nThe OIF welcomes its enhanced cooperation with\r\nthe Electoral Assistance Division of the Department of\r\nPolitical Affairs. The best practices identified at the\r\nmeeting of the United Nations and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, held in Paris in February\r\n2004, on comparative electoral policies will be useful\r\nin the context of the numerous activities we are\r\nplanning to undertake next year. In the Central African\r\nRepublic, Côte d’Ivoire and Haiti, we will work with\r\nthe United Nations and UNDP in connection with the\r\nelections scheduled for 2005.\r\nLa Francophonie remains convinced that a more\r\nequitable world order will not be possible unless all\r\ncountries are involved in the decision-making\r\nprocesses on the adoption of universal norms and on\r\nthe evolution of globalization. We are seeking to\r\nensure that all our member States are involved in this\r\nprocess, through French-speaking consultations and\r\nsupport for individual participation by our member\r\ncountries in major global conferences, including those\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThis year we have held consultations to prepare\r\nfor the World Summit on the Information Society, the\r\nlast part of which will be held in Tunisia in 2005, and\r\nfor the International Meeting to Review the\r\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, to be held in Mauritius next January. We are\r\nalso supporting the efforts of those two French-\r\nspeaking countries in order to ensure the success of the\r\nevents they will be hosting.\r\nLa Francophonie, which is committed to\r\nmultilateralism, is carrying out various programmes\r\naimed at enabling our member States to participate\r\nmore actively in the work of the United Nations and of\r\nother multilateral forums. As noted in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General, the OIF has organized, jointly with\r\nseveral United Nations bodies, training courses in the\r\neconomic and trade areas seeking to enhance the\r\nnegotiating capacity of developing Francophone\r\ncountries.\r\nThe OIF has consistently supported\r\nmultilingualism in the United Nations system because\r\nwe wish to see our member countries play their full\r\npart as Members of the United Nations. Our support for\r\nmultilingualism represents an important aspect of our\r\ncooperation with the United Nations system. Our\r\nprogramme on Francophone junior professional\r\nofficers, which is financed by the Intergovernmental\r\nAgency of la Francophonie, enables us directly to\r\nsupport the efforts of the United Nations by making\r\navailable French-speaking junior professional officers\r\nto the Secretariat and to specialized agencies. We\r\nwould like to thank in particular the Department of\r\nPublic Information for its ongoing readiness to explore\r\nwith us possibilities for cooperation to strengthen\r\nmultilingualism, particularly as concerns the United\r\nNations web site.\r\nWe welcome our strengthened cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations on development. The signing of a\r\nnew agreement between UNDP and the OIF enables\r\neach organization to obtain assistance from the other in\r\nthe context of implementing the follow-up and\r\nassessment of projects on the ground and will certainly\r\nstrengthen cooperation in various areas that will help\r\nall our member countries.\r\nTurning to the question of sustainable\r\ndevelopment, our Energy and Environmental Institute\r\nand UNDP have been working together, making the\r\nbest possible use of their respective comparative\r\nadvantages, on several projects related to the\r\nimplementation of the conclusions and\r\nrecommendations of the Johannesburg Summit on\r\nSustainable Development. A new agreement is now\r\nbeing finalized that will create a partnership aimed at\r\nstrengthening the national capacities of our developing\r\nmember States, particularly in Africa, in formulating\r\nprojects that could receive financing from the Global\r\nEnvironment Facility.\r\nIndeed, sustainable development is a key area of\r\nour cooperation with the United Nations, particularly\r\nin Africa. For that reason, the heads of State or\r\nGovernment of Francophone countries will meet on\r\n26 and 27 November in Africa — in Ouagadougou,\r\nBurkina Faso — for their tenth summit on la\r\nFrancophonie as a united force for sustainable\r\ndevelopment. We are certain that the outcome of that\r\nsummit will lead to fresh opportunities for cooperation\r\nbetween the OIF and the United Nations.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In accordance\r\nwith General Assembly resolution 3369 (XXX) of\r\n10 October 1975, I call on the observer for the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference.\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nMr. Lamani (Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference) (spoke in Arabic): It is a great honour to\r\naddress the General Assembly on cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference (OIC). I would like to convey the greetings\r\nof the Secretary-General of OIC and to wish the\r\nAssembly every success in its work at the fifty-ninth\r\nsession.\r\nAs this is the first time I have addressed the\r\nGeneral Assembly at the current session, I would like\r\nto extend my sincere congratulations to you,\r\nMr. President, and to your colleagues in the Bureau, on\r\nyour elections to those high offices. We are confident\r\nthat the session will be very ably directed under your\r\nleadership. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Julian Robert Hunte, and to the\r\nmembers of the Bureau of the previous session, for\r\nsteering the work of the Assembly so successfully\r\nduring their tenure in office.\r\nWe have read with interest the report of the\r\nSecretary-General contained in document A/59/303. It\r\ncontains informative details pertaining to the ongoing\r\ncooperation between our two organizations during the\r\nperiod under review. I wish to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress our sincere thanks and appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for that important and valuable\r\nreport and for his leadership role in enhancing\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nand other organizations in areas of common concern.\r\nWe also would like to commend the Secretariat for its\r\npart in the preparation of the report, which also\r\nincludes contributions from other bodies of the United\r\nNations system.\r\nAs before, the Secretary-General’s report is\r\ndevoted to the status of implementation of the\r\nprogrammes and activities in priority areas of\r\ncooperation, jointly developed by our two\r\norganizations and their respective agencies and bodies\r\nduring the period under review. As the report reflects,\r\nthe progress of implementation is encouraging. On\r\nbehalf of the General Secretariat of the OIC and its\r\nspecialized institutions, I would like to reassure the\r\nGeneral Assembly that we remain dedicated to the joint\r\ntasks we are pursuing.\r\nIn his capacity as chairman of the OIC Group at\r\nHeadquarters, the Deputy Permanent Representative of\r\nTurkey has introduced draft resolution A/59/L.12, on\r\nthe subject of cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the OIC. I would like to draw the Assembly’s\r\nattention to two particularly significant operative\r\nparagraphs of that draft.\r\nFirst, in operative paragraph 3, our two\r\norganizations are requested to continue to cooperate\r\nin their common search for solutions to global\r\nproblems, such as questions related to international\r\npeace and security, disarmament, self-determination,\r\ndecolonization, fundamental human rights, emergency\r\nrelief and rehabilitation, social and economic\r\ndevelopment and technical cooperation. In that regard,\r\nwe would like to affirm that we will continue to play\r\nour role in maintaining meaningful and effective\r\ncontacts between our two organizations and between\r\nour respective agencies and institutions. Those contacts\r\nwill continue to be strengthened through the support of\r\nthe OIC offices in New York and in Geneva, and\r\nthrough the various OIC contact groups and\r\ncommittees.\r\nSecondly, in operative paragraph 8 of the draft\r\nresolution, the specialized agencies and other\r\norganizations of the United Nations system are\r\nencouraged to continue to expand their cooperation\r\nwith the subsidiary organs and specialized and\r\naffiliated institutions of the OIC, particularly by\r\nnegotiating cooperation agreements, and through the\r\nnecessary contacts and meetings of the respective focal\r\npoints for cooperation in priority areas of interest to\r\nour two organizations. That directive has obviously\r\nemerged from the encouraging reports on the outcome\r\nof cooperation among the subsidiary organs and\r\nspecialized institutions of our two organizations during\r\nthe period under review. We look forward to further\r\nstrengthened, better-coordinated and mutually\r\ncooperative interactions among those agencies and\r\ninstitutions in their respective areas of interest in the\r\nfuture.\r\nI shall conclude my statement, as in past years,\r\non the same note of hope and expectation for future\r\ncooperation between our two organizations in all areas\r\nof common concern and in the best interests of our\r\nmember States. While we can leave it to history to\r\npronounce its judgement on the outcome of our\r\ncooperation, the demands of the global village, which\r\nsucceeding generations will inherit, place some\r\ncommon responsibilities on our shoulders today. In\r\nassuming those responsibilities, we pledge to you the\r\nfull and continuous cooperation and support of the\r\nOIC.\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.40\r\nThe President (spoke in French): We have heard\r\nthe last speaker in the debate on sub-items (a) to (t) of\r\nagenda item 56.\r\nI should like to inform members that, at the\r\nrequest of the sponsors, action on draft resolutions\r\nA/59/L.5/Rev.1 and A/59/L.11 will be taken at a later\r\ndate.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolutions A/59/L.1, L.3, L.6, L.7, L.8, L.12, as orally\r\nrevised, and L.13.\r\nDraft resolution A/59/L.1 is entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAsian-African Legal Consultative Organization”.\r\nBefore taking action, I would like to say that, since its\r\nintroduction, Australia has joined the list of sponsors.\r\nMay I take that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/59/L.1?\r\nDraft resolution A/59/L.1 was adopted (resolution\r\n59/3).\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.3 is entitled “Cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization”.
