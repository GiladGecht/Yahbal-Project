(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda items 12 and 41\r\nReport of the Economic and Social Council (A/59/3\r\nand Add.1)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/59/160)\r\nReport by the Secretary-General (A/59/346)\r\nThe role of the United Nations in promoting a new\r\nglobal human order\r\nThe President: In connection with agenda item\r\n12, I would like to recall for the members of the\r\nAssembly that, pursuant to resolution 58/316 of 1 July\r\n2004, the Assembly, on the recommendation of the\r\nGeneral Committee, decided at its 2nd plenary\r\nmeeting, on 17 September 2004, to consider agenda\r\nitem 12 in its entirety at a plenary meeting.\r\nI would also like to remind members that at its\r\n18th plenary meeting, on 4 October 2004, the\r\nAssembly was informed that the General Committee\r\ntook note of the clarification that, in implementing\r\nresolution 58/316 to consider agenda item 12 in its\r\nentirety in a plenary meeting, the relevant parts of\r\nChapter I of the report that are under agenda items\r\nalready allocated to the Main Committees will be\r\nconsidered by the Committee concerned for final\r\naction by the General Assembly.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I give the floor\r\nto the President of the Economic and Social Council,\r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Marjatta Rasi, to introduce the\r\nreport of the Economic and Social Council.\r\nMs. Rasi: It is my honour to present the report of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council for 2004, which is\r\nbefore the Assembly in document A/59/3 and\r\nAddendum 1.\r\nOver the last few years, the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil has made significant strides in addressing the\r\ninternational development agenda in a holistic,\r\ncoherent and coordinated manner. That has been\r\nachieved largely by bringing together important\r\ninstitutional stakeholders in one forum to address the\r\ndevelopment challenges of our time, by promoting\r\nintegrated and coordinated implementation of the\r\noutcomes of the United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits, by effectively coordinating the activities of\r\nthe United Nations system, by pursuing a\r\ncomprehensive approach to the issues of peace and\r\ndevelopment and, above all, by providing a forum for\r\ndialogue on the emerging challenges of development,\r\ntheir policy implications and how to design effective\r\ninternational responses. That has enabled the Council\r\nto attract a large number of high-level policy-makers,\r\nheads of United Nations agencies, funds and\r\nprogrammes and important stakeholders, including\r\ncivil society.\r\nThis year witnessed not only further\r\nstrengthening of those trends but also some innovative\r\napproaches to promoting dialogue on issues of concern\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\nto the policy-makers. The policy dialogue of the high-\r\nlevel segment on the world economic situation and\r\ninternational cooperation was enriched by the\r\npresentation of the report of the World Commission on\r\nthe Social Dimension of Globalization and led to\r\ncandid discussion on that issue. That was perhaps the\r\nfirst time that the Council engaged in such a way on\r\nthe issue of globalization, which remains the defining\r\nfeature of our time.\r\nAs mandated by the General Assembly, the\r\nspecial high-level meeting of the Council with the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\r\nOrganization focused this year on specific areas of the\r\nMonterrey Consensus and their impact on the\r\nrealization of the Millennium Development Goals. It\r\nhelped maintain the political momentum on financing\r\nfor development, building on the closer relationship\r\nfostered with the Bretton Woods institutions and World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO) during the financing for\r\ndevelopment process. Owing to the Economic and\r\nSocial Council’s increased cooperation with the World\r\nBank, the International Monetary Fund, the WTO and\r\nother United Nations bodies working in economic\r\ndevelopment, the special high-level meeting of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council has developed into a\r\nstrategic platform where actions in support of the\r\nMonterrey Consensus are discussed.\r\nAt its high-level segment, the Council addressed\r\nthe extremely important theme of resources\r\nmobilization and an enabling environment for poverty\r\neradication in the least developed countries (LDCs).\r\nThat theme was anchored in the follow-up to the\r\nBrussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed\r\nCountries. The concerns of the LDCs were thereby\r\nfirmly placed at the forefront of the international\r\nagenda, providing an opportunity to reflect on how to\r\nwork towards mobilizing resources to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals in the LDCs.\r\nThe Ministerial Declaration that was adopted this\r\nyear reaffirms our commitment to implementation of\r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action in a timely manner.\r\nIt points to the need for creating an overall enabling\r\nenvironment for national and international actions to\r\neradicate poverty, promote sustainable development\r\nand strengthen the partnership between the LDCs and\r\nthe international community, if we are to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals in those countries.\r\nThe coordination segment this year achieved\r\nsignificant progress on the issue of gender\r\nmainstreaming in the entities of United Nations system\r\nand in the work of intergovernmental bodies. All\r\nUnited Nations entities have been asked to develop\r\naction plans with time lines for implementing the goals\r\nagreed at the 1997 session of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. That will help strengthen commitment and\r\naccountability at the highest levels within the United\r\nNations system. The Council also recommended that\r\nthe General Assembly encourage its committees and\r\nother intergovernmental bodies, to take further\r\nmeasures to integrate gender perspectives\r\nsystematically into all areas of their work.\r\nWithin the coordination segment, the Council\r\nalso reviewed United Nations system support to rural\r\ndevelopment in developing countries. This area was a\r\nfollow-up to last year’s Ministerial Declaration. The\r\nCouncil reaffirmed its commitment to promoting\r\npartnerships for sustainable rural development between\r\nentities of the United Nations system, Member States,\r\nthe private sector and non-governmental organizations\r\n(NGOs), and it urged the United Nations system\r\norganizations to help countries further their agenda in\r\nrural development efficiently.\r\nAt the operational activities segment it was\r\nbroadly recognized that the system is indeed becoming\r\nbetter coordinated and more coherent and effective in\r\nsupporting national development efforts to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other\r\ninternationally agreed goals.\r\nIt was, at the same time acknowledged, that\r\nfurther progress is needed to ensure genuine national\r\nownership and leadership of the national development\r\nprocess. Along with adequate and predictable\r\nresources, greater alignment and integration of United\r\nNations activities with national processes and priorities\r\nare essential objectives. The Council has thus\r\ncontributed in a substantive manner to preparing the\r\nground for the triennial comprehensive policy review\r\n(TCPR), to be discussed by the General Assembly\r\nshortly.\r\nAn important innovation this year was the\r\norganization of a joint event with the operational and\r\nhumanitarian affairs segments of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, that helped focus discussion on the\r\nissue of transition from relief to development. During\r\nthe discussions, it was stressed that there was a need to\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\ndevelop a common understanding of when transition\r\nstarts and how rehabilitation and reconstruction should\r\nbe linked. In pursuing that further, the Council\r\nemphasized the need for a more inclusive dialogue\r\nwith Member States on that complex issue.\r\nAt the humanitarian affairs segment, the Council\r\ncalled for enhanced collaboration within the United\r\nNations system. The Council felt the need to clarify the\r\nrespective roles of entities within the United Nations\r\nsystem and address their inherent complementarities in\r\nthe field of humanitarian assistance. Coordination of\r\nemergency humanitarian assistance was also a priority\r\nfor this year. To that end, two thematic panel\r\ndiscussions on strengthening response to natural\r\ndisasters, with an emphasis on capacity-building, and\r\nmaintaining a field presence in high-risk environments\r\nprompted a lively and productive discussion.\r\nHopefully, the agreed outcomes of the session will\r\nenhance the coordination efforts of the United Nations\r\nsystem in that important area.\r\nThe general segment, as in previous years,\r\naddressed a whole range of issues, including the\r\nquestion of the graduation of the least developed\r\ncountries. That has proven to be one of the most\r\nintractable issues. However, I am happy to report that\r\nthe Council has now succeeded in developing a\r\nconsensual approach on the issue, which will greatly\r\nfacilitate the smooth transition of the least developed\r\ncountries towards their graduation.\r\nOne of the major achievements of the Economic\r\nand Social Council has been its increasing involvement\r\nin countries emerging from conflict and its increasing\r\ncollaboration with the Security Council in such\r\nmatters. As requested by the framework resolution\r\nestablishing the Ad Hoc Advisory Groups on Guinea-\r\nBissau and Burundi, an assessment of their functioning\r\nwas completed in May 2004. It was found that the\r\nGroups had done constructive work in support of the\r\ncountries concerned through their broad, open and\r\nparticipatory approach, in fruitful collaboration with\r\nUnited Nations system organizations and the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, and in their strong advocacy for\r\nadequate resources for peace building and\r\nreconstruction. The Council has thus extended the\r\nmandates of both Groups.\r\nWithin the context of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil’s work on conflict prevention and peace-\r\nbuilding, it is my pleasure to announce that, under a\r\nseparate mandate, the Council decided in July 2004 to\r\nreactivate the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti. The\r\nactivities of that Group will focus on a long-term\r\ndevelopment programme for the country. The\r\ncomposition of the Group will be announced shortly\r\nand we can expect it to begin work as soon as possible.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council is perhaps the\r\nonly Charter body that has shown immense capacity to\r\nreform, innovate and adapt to the changing realities\r\nand challenges of development. It has been a\r\ncontinuous process and it is still under way. To enrich\r\nthat process, a panel discussion was organized where a\r\nnumber of interesting proposals were presented for\r\nfurther enhancing the role of the Council. Hopefully,\r\nthe Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change will give those efforts further\r\nimpetus.\r\nI would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the\r\nactive and effective participation of the non-\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs) and other parts of\r\ncivil society in this session of the Council. A\r\nsignificant number of preparatory regional meetings\r\nwere organized by the informal regional networks.\r\nThey also organized a forum on the margins of the\r\nhigh-level segment and made substantive contributions\r\nto the work of the Council.\r\nThe United Nations Charter emphasizes that\r\npeace and security and development are indivisible. In\r\nthis spirit it is important that the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil enhance its cooperation with the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I thank the\r\nPresident of the Economic and Social Council. I give\r\nthe floor to the representative of Barbados, speaking on\r\nbehalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).\r\nMr. Hackett (Barbados): I would like to thank\r\nthe President of the Economic and Social Council, the\r\nPermanent Representative of Finland, on the\r\nintroduction of the report of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. Her very comprehensive report clearly\r\noutlines the range of activities of the Council and I\r\nwould like to commend it for its work over the past\r\nyear.\r\nMy intervention is on agenda item 41, namely,\r\nthe role of the United Nations in promoting a new\r\nglobal human order. I have the honour to make this\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\nstatement on behalf of the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) Member States of the United Nations.\r\nThe delegation of Guyana, whose former\r\nPresident, the late Cheddi Jagan, was a champion of\r\nthat concept, will be addressing the issue later in the\r\njoint debate.\r\nI would like, on behalf of the other CARICOM\r\nmember States, to support the proposal. The evolving\r\nprocess of globalization is leading to the greater\r\nintegration of markets, larger economies of scale and\r\nhigh levels of prosperity for some. At the same time,\r\nwe are also being confronted by growing inequalities\r\nin the distribution of its benefits. Disparities between\r\nrich and poor within and among countries have\r\nincreased, and this has had an adverse effect on human\r\ndevelopment. These challenges facing the international\r\ncommunity suggest the need for coherent multilateral\r\napproaches in addressing today’s global problems. We\r\nbelieve that a concept of a new global human order\r\noffers a framework for integrating the economic,\r\nenvironmental, social, cultural and political aspects of\r\ndevelopment, and we call on Members of the United\r\nNations to give careful consideration to the proposal.\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nThe operationalization of this approach to\r\ndevelopment can best be undertaken, we believe, under\r\nthe auspices of a global body such as the United\r\nNations. Indeed it is opportune to use the United\r\nNations in this manner, given that the underlying\r\nobjective of the new global human order could provide\r\na sound platform, not only for achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, but also for the\r\npromotion of development over the long term. This\r\nwill be a central challenge as we prepare for the review\r\nsummit which will be held next year at the beginning\r\nat the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Karran (Guyana): In taking the floor to\r\naddress agenda item 41 on the role of the United\r\nNations in promoting a new global human order, I align\r\nmy delegation fully with the remarks made on this item\r\nby the representative of Barbados on behalf of the\r\nStates members of the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM).\r\nAs we stated in the Assembly when this item was\r\nfirst introduced by the Guyana delegation, its aim is to\r\npromote a new and enlightened partnership for peace\r\nand development, involving all actors of the world\r\ncommunity, based on mutual respect, democratic\r\ngovernance and popular participation, so as to\r\ncomprehensively address the challenges of sustainable\r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication and to arrest the\r\never-growing disparities among and within countries.\r\nOur memorandum to the Secretary-General\r\ncontained in document A/59/283 sets out our views on\r\nthe proposal for a new global human order.\r\nThe consensus that emerged from the series of\r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits during the\r\n1990s established the fact that the eradication of\r\npoverty was a central challenge for national and\r\ninternational policy. In this context, the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals outline the principal targets to be\r\nmet to combat poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy,\r\nenvironmental degradation and discrimination against\r\nwomen. The indications are, however, that there is now\r\nbarely enough time to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. The window of opportunity to\r\nhalve poverty by 2015 is quickly closing. In addition to\r\ntargeted plans and strategies, a rapid scaling-up of\r\ninternational cooperation will be required if those\r\ntargets are to be met.\r\nThe structural challenges to the pursuit of human\r\ndevelopment are compounded by the problems of war\r\nand conflict in some parts of the world, which tend to\r\ndisplace development from the agenda of the\r\ninternational community. With the widening of\r\nconcepts of security and the strengthening of local and\r\nglobal interaction between its different dimensions, the\r\ndevelopment agenda could become further\r\nmarginalized. This tendency could perpetuate the status\r\nquo and create new imbalances in international\r\nrelations, thus reinforcing the patterns of inequality\r\nthat have prevailed over the past decade. The\r\nindissoluble link between development, peace and\r\nsecurity must be addressed, since, if the development\r\nagenda fails, peace is certain to be imperilled — and\r\nvice versa. We are hopeful that the outcome of the\r\nSecretary-General’s High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change will help us to address these\r\nchallenges in a mutually complementary fashion.\r\nIt must also be emphasized that the threat to\r\ndemocracy that is inherent in any failure to pay\r\nattention to development is real. Development policies\r\nover the past decade have been discussed largely in\r\nterms of whether or not they enable a country to take\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\nfull advantage of a world economy that is more closely\r\nintegrated than at any other time in history. Far from\r\nredistributing global wealth — the goal that has\r\nanimated most of the development discourse since the\r\n1960s — we appear to be faced, instead, with the\r\nredistribution of global poverty. According to the 2003\r\nHuman Development Report, which gave us the first\r\nglimpse of the progress made in attaining the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, some 54 countries\r\nwere poorer in 2000 than they were in 1990.\r\nIt is also cause for concern that, in value terms,\r\nthe human development index has fallen dramatically\r\nin 21 countries since the report was first published in\r\n1990. In most cases, those countries embraced\r\nmacroeconomic reform, trade liberalization, open\r\ninvestment rules and improved fiscal management.\r\nThose policies did not automatically produce the\r\nexpected benefits. Notwithstanding this situation, we\r\nshare the basic belief that fast and sustained\r\nemployment-intensive growth is the only means of\r\neffectively reducing poverty.\r\nThe wide disparity in the economic and social\r\nconditions of the developed and developing countries\r\nis matched by an equally serious difference in their\r\nperspectives on development policy. An urgent\r\nreconciliation of the widely divergent views of the\r\npartners on world economic and social issues is a\r\nprerequisite for progress in the future. The mere\r\npapering over of those differences will ultimately fail\r\nthe test of implementation.\r\nThe new global human order is a genuine and\r\nearnest attempt to find common ground on which\r\nfuture international cooperation can be solidly founded\r\nin order to provide a comprehensive and holistic\r\nframework for development cooperation. Far from\r\ncompeting with other initiatives and proposals already\r\nin existence and currently being pursued, it is intended\r\nas a complementary device for facilitating consensus\r\non what actions we must take. Conceivably, it could\r\nalso serve as a safety valve if or when, for whatever\r\nreason, the established negotiating processes flounder\r\nor fail.\r\nThe new global human order is simultaneously a\r\nphilosophical framework and a practical agenda for\r\ndevelopment. Its concrete proposals include a\r\ncomprehensive and definitive solution to the debt\r\nproblem; the fashioning of new policies on official\r\ndevelopment assistance; the mobilization of new and\r\nadditional resources; the strengthening and, if\r\nnecessary, reshaping of global institutions; the\r\ndevelopment of a more central role for the United\r\nNations in global economic policy-making; and a\r\nreview of the role of the Bretton Woods institutions\r\nand the World Trade Organization to increase the focus\r\non human development.\r\nA central challenge for the international\r\ncommunity is finding the political will to energize our\r\nefforts to create a new development paradigm for the\r\ntwenty-first century. My delegation intends to work\r\nwith others of like mind to explore with development\r\npartners the outer limits to which they would wish to\r\ngo in development cooperation. Such a dialogue could\r\nestablish the basic terms and conditions of a new\r\npartnership and, at the same time, provide a certain\r\ndegree of predictability and reliability to our\r\ncooperation.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the best forum for\r\nundertaking such reconciliation and consensus-building\r\nis the United Nations. The over-arching mandate of its\r\nCharter and its status as the most representative of\r\ninternational institutions render the United Nations\r\nideally suited to promoting agreement among Member\r\nStates.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to contend that a new global\r\nhuman order is not a stand-alone process with respect\r\nto development, but instead, an all-embracing solution\r\nto the challenges of development. Our approach is to\r\ncreate a framework to allow various initiatives to\r\ncontribute to the larger goal and to identify additional\r\nmeasures necessary to fill the gaps and overcome the\r\nstructural impediments to reversing the growing\r\ndisparities between rich and poor countries, with a\r\nfocus on human development.\r\nIn this spirit, my delegation will work with\r\nMember States in presenting a draft resolution to\r\naddress the next steps in the consideration of this\r\nproposal.\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): I wish to join in thanking the\r\nPresident of the Economic and Social Council,\r\nAmbassador Marjatta Rasi, for her introduction of the\r\nReport of the Council and to congratulate her on her\r\nable and efficient leadership of the Council during\r\n2004. The Council made good progress in the\r\ndischarge of its mandate and in reaching decisions on\r\nmost of the issues before it, although a few issues\r\nremain unresolved.\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\nThe annual high-level meeting of the Economic\r\nand Social Council with the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, the World Trade Organization, and the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD) once again provided a welcome\r\nopportunity for dialogue and the exchange of views on\r\nthe implementation of commitments and on the\r\nmanagement of the global economy. What is of\r\nparticular importance for us is that this process should\r\nbe strengthened to maximize the potential for such a\r\nforum to influence decision-making on macroeconomic\r\npolicies and development cooperation.\r\nJamaica continues to believe that more efforts\r\nshould be made to ensure that the outcome of the high-\r\nlevel meeting is taken beyond mere presidential\r\nsummaries. We should seek to produce a more practical\r\nand action-oriented document, committing each\r\ninstitution to concrete steps to develop coherence and\r\nconsistency in policies and operational activities.\r\nWe should also continue to improve the\r\npreparatory process to ensure that the discussions are\r\nmore narrowly defined to accommodate a sharper focus\r\non critical issues. One day alone does not allow enough\r\ntime for handling an agenda so broad.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council should also\r\nendeavour to foster ongoing contact with those\r\nagencies beyond the one-day meeting for regular\r\nexchange of information and to promote continued\r\ncoordination on international economic policies.\r\nWith respect to participation, we wish to\r\nemphasise the importance of the involvement of\r\nUNCTAD on an equal basis with all other participants,\r\nand we insist that this be acknowledged explicitly in\r\nthe description of the meeting and in its\r\ndocumentation. We attach great value to UNCTAD’s\r\nrole in providing analytical perspectives and in its\r\nrecommendations on policy matters, which must find\r\nan important place in the discussions.\r\nThe report shows that the work of the Economic\r\nand Social Council in the various segments was\r\ncarefully planned and managed so as to ensure the\r\norderly completion of its business within the time\r\nconstraints.\r\nAll of this work needs to be well publicized, as\r\nmany important issues received attention. The high-\r\nlevel segment examined the mobilization of resources\r\nfor poverty eradication, especially in the least\r\ndeveloped countries, and many new initiatives were\r\nproposed to stimulate implementation of the Brussels\r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nIn the coordination segment, we were pleased by\r\nthe decision to focus on gender mainstreaming and on\r\nrural development, which should be pursued in order to\r\nensure that they are both given greater emphasis in\r\nimplementation programmes, particularly for the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe provision of relief in humanitarian\r\nemergencies, highlighted in one segment, is one of the\r\nmost visible aspects of the work of the United Nations.\r\nIn the context of continued problems of underfunding,\r\ntherefore, we wish to once again urge increased\r\ncontributions to the humanitarian activities, as they\r\nremain one of the most effective examples of activities\r\nthat give a positive image to the United Nations.\r\nIn the operational activities segment, valuable\r\ncontributions were made for the triennial\r\ncomprehensive policy review, which will be debated\r\nduring this session of the General Assembly. The\r\ncritical issues revolve around increasing the core\r\nfunding to operational activities, the simplification and\r\nharmonization of procedures, the strengthening of the\r\nresident coordination system and the emphasis on the\r\ndelivery and effectiveness of technical assistance so as\r\nto maximize the potential of the United Nations system\r\nto contribute to the achievement of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nWith regard to the general segment, we continue\r\nto believe that the pressures of time and the scope of\r\nwork require better arrangements for managing the\r\nissues before it. Of particular importance is the need\r\nfor more time to be devoted to analysing the work\r\nbeing done by the subsidiary bodies and to giving\r\ndirection on current programmes and future activities.\r\nSome elements of the work of this segment are\r\nstill outstanding. We make particular mention of the\r\nissue of international cooperation on tax matters, which\r\nwe consider to be an important area for making\r\nprogress towards better global governance. We are\r\ndisappointed at the resistance that has so far prevented\r\nfull agreement on this issue. The advantages of reform\r\nare clear, and the benefits will accrue to all. There is no\r\nhidden agenda. The objective is cooperation through\r\nthe establishment of an intergovernmental structure\r\nthat is inclusive and broadly representative. It is our\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\nhope that the issue will be completed during the\r\nresumed session next week.\r\nDuring the course of the year, the issue of reform\r\nand revitalization of the Council was addressed in a\r\npanel discussion. Those discussions were useful, but it\r\nis time for the process to be moved from the discussion\r\nlevel to the consideration and adoption of concrete\r\nproposals for reform. We feel it is important that the\r\nEconomic and Social Council should be strengthened\r\nin its coordination role and that its influence and\r\neffectiveness should be increased. Current trends in\r\nglobalization and interdependence have increased the\r\nneed at the global level for greater coordination,\r\nmonitoring and management of international economic\r\nrelations.\r\nInstitutional reform is needed at three levels. The\r\nfirst level involves increasing the role of the Council in\r\noverall management by bringing under its auspices\r\ncoordination of the various agencies dealing with trade,\r\nfinance and technology. Some proposals have been\r\nmade to create a new entity. While this is also possible,\r\nthere is no reason why the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil could not be transformed to become the\r\nvehicle for an increased role for the United Nations in\r\nthe management of the global economy.\r\nSecondly, there is also need for a review of the\r\nlogistical arrangements for the meetings of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, especially with\r\nreference to the duration and scheduling of sessions, as\r\nwell as the question of venue. In our view, greater\r\nefficiency would result from having two annual\r\nsessions and concentrating the Council’s work in New\r\nYork. We are in general support of the reform measures\r\nproposed by Ambassador Rosenthal at the conclusion\r\nof his presidency in 2003. We would also add that there\r\nis need to make improvements in the system of panel\r\npresentations so that they can become a better source\r\nof information, new ideas and new initiatives on the\r\nvarious items.\r\nThirdly, the Economic and Social Council should\r\nexpand its collaboration with the other organs of the\r\nUnited Nations, in particular the Security Council, in\r\norder to ensure its participation in the consideration of\r\nthe economic and social dimensions of conflict\r\nsituations. We are aware of the important role played\r\nby the ad hoc advisory groups in Africa, and we\r\nwelcome the formation of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group\r\non Haiti, which should play a role in mobilizing\r\nassistance for development in Haiti and in helping to\r\ndirect the building of its economic underpinnings for\r\nstability and economic improvement.\r\nIn general, we believe that the Economic and\r\nSocial Council should be assertive in this role, in\r\naccordance with its responsibility under the Charter for\r\nthe management of economic cooperation. To that end,\r\nwe think it is desirable that the Council should meet on\r\nan ad hoc basis throughout the year, as the need arises,\r\nto respond to situations of economic crisis and to make\r\nrecommendations on measures to be taken.\r\nTurning now to agenda item 41, the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in promoting a new global human\r\norder — which is being considered jointly in this\r\ndebate — the Permanent Representative of Barbados\r\nspoke on behalf of the Caribbean Community. For now,\r\nwe will make only a few general remarks.\r\nJamaica believes that it is important for the\r\nUnited Nations to be a force in formulating core\r\nprinciples, norms and policies that advance the\r\ncommon interests of humanity. A world order which is\r\nfounded on equitable principles provides a framework\r\nfor action to promote global welfare. That is of value\r\nto all of us. It is that aspiration to ideals that underpins\r\nthe onward march in human progress and the fulfilment\r\nof the destiny of humankind. Our higher instincts and\r\nspiritual values lead us towards seeking the\r\nachievement of the common good. This is not just a\r\nphilosophical idea or a moral issue. It is the basis for\r\nhuman security and, ultimately, human survival. The\r\ninterests of peace and social justice and economic\r\nwelfare are closely linked, and it is through a process\r\nof increased cooperation anchored in core values and\r\nobjectives that we will be able to surmount the great\r\nchallenges of our time and to apply remedies to\r\nproblems that afflict a large percentage of humanity,\r\nparticularly in the developing countries.\r\nWe therefore give our full support to the\r\ndevelopment of a strong political consensus on\r\nprinciples and values in order to forge a global\r\npartnership to benefit all peoples. We believe that the\r\nproposals made by the representative of Guyana on the\r\nelements of a framework of a new global human order\r\nprovide constructive guidelines for the policies of the\r\nUnited Nations and Member States. We support the\r\ncreation of a process through the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil or the General Assembly to develop those\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\nproposals further for the adoption of a declaration by\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Krasnov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian):\r\nBelarus believes that this year represents an important\r\nstage on the way towards restoring the former role and\r\ninfluence of the Economic and Social Council on the\r\norganization of the activities of United Nations bodies\r\nin the economic, social, ecological and humanitarian\r\nspheres. We are generally satisfied with the results of\r\nthe council’s session. The Council made a significant\r\ncontribution to the triennial policy review of\r\noperational activities of the United Nations system and\r\nto strengthening coordination of United Nations\r\nhumanitarian assistance.\r\nBelarus highly commends the work of the\r\nCouncil’s Bureau in seeking and using effective new\r\nmechanisms to improve the working methods of the\r\nCouncil, which is an important coordinating body of\r\nthe United Nations system.\r\nOn a positive note, we would cite the new\r\npractice of joint meetings of the various segments of\r\nthe substantive session of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil on related issues and the informal dialogue\r\norganized by the Bureau in May on the issue of the\r\nCouncil’s reform. Significant work was done by the\r\nBureau to carefully prepare the significant events of\r\nthe Council and to increase the number of participants\r\nat April’s special high-level meeting of the Economic\r\nand Social Council, on financing for development, with\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions, the World Trade\r\nOrganization and the United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Development.\r\nHowever, we regret that the Council has not been\r\nable to fully meet its responsibility under the United\r\nNations Charter of effectively monitoring and\r\norganizing the work of its functional commissions. It is\r\nimportant to move from a routine, automatic approval\r\nof the commissions’ reports and decisions to a\r\ncomprehensive and critical analysis and, if necessary,\r\nthe correction of those decisions.\r\nWe believe that the Economic and Social Council\r\nshould further strengthen its role in coordinating and\r\nstrategically guiding the operational activities of the\r\nUnited Nations system. We are ready to support\r\nproposals for the Council’s reform that provide for\r\nannual consideration by the Council of implementation\r\nof the General Assembly resolution on the triennial\r\npolicy review of operational activities of the United\r\nNations system.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council should further\r\nstrengthen its interaction with the Security Council in\r\norder to pool efforts to create conditions favourable for\r\nreconstruction and development of States that have\r\nsuffered armed conflicts.\r\nBelarus supports the Council’s decision to focus,\r\nat the high-level segment and the coordination segment\r\nof the Council’s 2005 substantive session, on issues\r\nrelated to achieving internationally agreed\r\ndevelopment goals, including those of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. That substantive session should serve as\r\nan important stage for review of implementation of the\r\ndecisions adopted at the Millennium Summit and other\r\nrecent major international forums held in recent years\r\nin the economic, social and related fields under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations. If successful, the\r\nsession of the Economic and Social Council will\r\nprovide the necessary prerequisites for the success of\r\nthe United Nations major high-level event next year.\r\nLike the United Nations as a whole, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council is currently at a difficult\r\nstage in the reform and the revitalization of its\r\nactivities. Given our experience and knowledge, the\r\nRepublic of Belarus is ready and able to make a\r\nconstructive contribution to that process for the benefit\r\nof all Member States of the Organization. That\r\naspiration is the basis of our decision to submit our\r\ncandidature for election to the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil for the 2007-2009 term. Traditionally, Belarus\r\ndevotes special attention to the Council, as it is the\r\nmost important coordinating body responsible for\r\npriority areas of the Organization’s activity.\r\nIn that regard, we look at the Council’s work in\r\nthe context of its responsibility for developing a\r\nconstructive dialogue with partners in order to seek and\r\nadopt the optimal decisions for the improved\r\nfunctioning of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Saleem Saifullah Khan (Pakistan): It is a\r\ngreat honour and privilege for me to welcome the\r\nreport of the Economic and Social Council for the year\r\n2004 on behalf of the Pakistan delegation. The\r\nmembers of the Bureau, under the able stewardship of\r\nthe President of the Council, Ms. Marjatta Rasi, have\r\ndone a commendable job in bringing out this\r\ncomprehensive report. We compliment them all for a\r\njob well done.\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\nSix decades ago, under the United Nations\r\nCharter, we committed ourselves to achieve\r\ninternational cooperation for resolving international\r\neconomic, social, cultural and humanitarian problems.\r\nWe also pledged to promote higher standards of living,\r\nfull employment, and the conditions for economic and\r\nsocial progress and development. The Economic and\r\nSocial Council, as one of the major organs of the\r\nUnited Nations system, has a central role to play\r\ntowards the realization of those objectives and\r\ncommitments.\r\nThe most important role for the Council is to\r\ncreate the conditions that would lead to a genuine\r\nglobal partnership for economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment — a role that the Council seeks to\r\nperform through system-wide coordination of United\r\nNations activities in the economic and social spheres.\r\nThe report under consideration today thus\r\npresents a good opportunity to review the activities\r\nundertaken by the Council to achieve those objectives.\r\nThis year the special high-level meeting of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council with the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization took\r\nplace on 26 April. The special meeting has become a\r\nmajor platform for substantive deliberations on the\r\nimplementation of the Monterrey Consensus. We feel\r\nthat this process needs to be strengthened further to\r\nmake the existing cooperation between the United\r\nNations and other international economic organizations\r\neffective and meaningful.\r\nThe other important element of the Council’s\r\nactivities is the high-level segment that focuses on a\r\nspecific theme each year. This year’s theme addressed\r\nresource mobilization for the least developed countries\r\n(LDCs) in the context of the Programme of Action for\r\nthe LDCs. The draft ministerial declaration adopted by\r\nthe Council on that theme recognized the weak\r\nimplementation of the LDC Programme of Action. The\r\ndeclaration expressed the concern that this trend would\r\nlead to a failure to reach the targets set by the\r\nProgramme of Action and underscored the need to\r\nredouble global efforts to create an enabling\r\nenvironment at all levels in order to eradicate poverty\r\nand promote sustainable development of the LDCs.\r\nIt is regrettable that, despite intensive\r\nconsultations during the substantive session of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council this year, member States\r\nwere unable to reach an agreement on the themes for\r\nthe multi-year work programme, with the exception of\r\nthe theme for 2005. That theme, which will focus on a\r\nreview of the progress made in achieving\r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), will\r\nafford the Economic and Social Council an important\r\nopportunity to provide input for the 2005 high-level\r\nevent.\r\nWe are quite encouraged to see the Council\r\nassume an active role in a number of key areas through\r\nits spearheading of a number of important initiatives in\r\nthe past several years. The Council’s manifesto on\r\npoverty eradication, drawn up in 1999 during the high-\r\nlevel segment, provided the critical conceptual basis\r\nfor the MDGs. Similarly, the establishment of the\r\nInformation and Communication Technologies Task\r\nForce, the international endorsement of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development and the holding\r\nof the International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment would not have been possible without the\r\ncritical and substantive input of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council. The Council has also been entrusted\r\nwith the task of conducting an integrated and\r\ncoordinated follow-up of the major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits in the economic, social and\r\nrelated fields. This is in addition to its responsibility to\r\nmonitor and assess the follow-up to the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development.\r\nIn order to enable the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil to perform these important tasks, we will have\r\nto bolster its strengths and eliminate its shortcomings.\r\nThe ambit of the Council’s activities is undergoing a\r\npositive expansion, which indeed is a very welcome\r\ndevelopment. We strongly believe that the Economic\r\nand Social Council can and must act as the central\r\nplatform for global dialogue to promote coherence,\r\nconsistency and coordination of trade, development\r\nand financial policies.\r\nThe inequities and exclusive nature of the process\r\nof globalization only makes such an integrated\r\napproach an urgent contemporary imperative. The\r\nposition of the Economic and Social Council in the\r\ninternational organizational architecture eminently\r\nqualifies it to perform this unique role of overseeing\r\nand coordinating economic and social decisions at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels.\r\nDevelopment issues have economic and social\r\ndimensions, and those two dimensions are becoming\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\nincreasingly intertwined. An integrated approach to the\r\neconomic and social aspects of development would\r\nhelp avoid duplication and overlap, besides ensuring\r\nstrengthened coordination and optimal utilization of\r\nresources at all levels. The principal objective should\r\nbe to promote growth, equity, coherence and humanism\r\nin national and international policies.\r\nA major shortcoming commonly attributed to the\r\nEconomic and Social Council is its inability to enforce\r\nits decisions and its relative powerlessness in\r\ncomparison to the international financial, trade and\r\neconomic institutions. Pakistan believes that the\r\nEconomic and Social Council should optimize its\r\nresources and opportunities — including through\r\nimproving its programme of work — and serve as an\r\ninstrument to strengthen multilateralism. It should\r\nprovide a quality platform for high-level engagement\r\nby member States, international institutions, civil\r\nsociety and the private sector for discussions on\r\nemerging global trends, harmonize global policies and\r\nidentify common but differentiated responsibilities for\r\nglobal action.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council should play a\r\nrole in managing globalization and promoting equitable\r\nsocio-economic development. The goals set out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration must continue to guide efforts\r\nin that direction. Security in its most comprehensive\r\nsense can be assured only when there is simultaneous\r\nprogress in addressing security threats as well as social\r\nand economic challenges. To this end, the Council\r\nshould also play a key role in the preparations for the\r\n2005 major event, which will focus on the follow-up to\r\nthe Millennium Summit and the integrated follow-up to\r\nUnited Nations conferences. The high-level and\r\ncoordination segments of the 2005 substantive session\r\nof the Economic and Social Council should develop\r\nconcrete recommendations on the basis of a review of\r\nthe commitments made in the Millennium Declaration,\r\nin particular the MDGs, MDG-based reports prepared\r\nby a large number of countries, reports of regional\r\ncommissions and the work of the functional\r\ncommissions to achieve the MDGs.\r\nWe clearly see the close and interdependent\r\nnature of peace and development and fully realize that\r\none is unsustainable without the other. We therefore\r\nbelieve that the process of United Nations reform\r\nwould not be complete without according equal\r\nemphasis to enhancing the role of the United Nations\r\nin promoting the global development agenda and\r\nwithout empowering its various organs, including the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. This should be in\r\naddition to restoring the primacy of the General\r\nAssembly as the supreme organ of the United Nations.\r\nFinally, there is a growing recognition that the\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations need to closely\r\ncooperate and coordinate their work in order to avoid\r\nduplication of efforts and to effectively address the\r\nmultidimensional crises facing the world today. In that\r\nregard, the proposal for establishing ad hoc composite\r\ncommittees with representation from the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, the General Assembly and other\r\nstakeholders needs to be seriously considered.\r\nMr. Hannesson (Iceland): I would like to begin\r\nby thanking the Ambassador Marjatta Rasi, the\r\nPresident of the Economic and Social Council, for\r\nintroducing the 2004 report of the Council (A/59/3 and\r\nAdd.1), which provides a good overview of its work.\r\nAs Iceland is hoping to be elected to the Council next\r\nweek, my delegation would like to address a few issues\r\nwhich it finds of particular interest.\r\nThe international community has committed itself\r\nto addressing the problems and challenges facing the\r\npoorest countries in the world. As we all know, the\r\nprogress has been mixed, and while a number of\r\ncountries have progressed at an unparalleled rate,\r\nothers have lost headway and need urgent attention.\r\nThat is particularly true for sub-Saharan Africa.\r\nAccelerated progress towards meeting\r\ninternationally agreed goals, such as the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), requires the concerted\r\nefforts of developing and developed countries alike.\r\nIceland intends to contribute its share to achieving the\r\nMDGs, and it is anticipated that by 2009 Iceland’s\r\nofficial development assistance will be more than\r\ndouble its current level.\r\nNext year will be particularly important in our\r\nglobal fight against poverty. The major event that will\r\ntake place here in New York will be a vital opportunity\r\nfor assessing where we stand in relation to the MDGs.\r\nIn light of that, the themes of the 2005 Economic and\r\nSocial Council high-level and coordination segments\r\nare particularly relevant, and we appreciate that they\r\nwill have a major input into the 2005 high-level review\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nNext year we will also have a very important\r\nevent in the field of women’s issues and promotion of\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\ngender equality, as the forty-ninth session of the\r\nCommission on the Status of Women will be dedicated\r\nto the review of the Beijing Platform for Action and\r\nthe outcome of the twenty-third special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We have done an excellent job at\r\nthe United Nations in formulating agreements on\r\nwomen’s rights, but we urgently need to live up to\r\nthose agreements.\r\nGender mainstreaming is one way of improving\r\ngender equality, and Security Council resolution 1325\r\n(2000) was a step forward in that direction. However, it\r\nis also important that we strengthen our efforts to\r\nsecure its full implementation, especially regarding\r\nwomen’s participation in decision-making. It is also\r\nvital that the policy of gender mainstreaming be\r\nimplemented, monitored and evaluated on all levels in\r\nother areas, such as development.\r\nFinally, I would like to mention human rights.\r\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the\r\nVienna Declaration and Programme of Action declare\r\nall human rights to be universal and inalienable.\r\nProtection and promotion of human rights is a primary\r\nresponsibility of Governments.\r\nIn relation to human rights, Iceland would like to\r\nexpress its deep concern that the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil failed to approve a resolution last summer to\r\nreverse the Commission on Human Rights decision\r\n2004/117 on human rights and human responsibilities.\r\nThat decision, together with the pre-draft declaration\r\non human rights and human responsibilities, constitutes\r\na direct assault on the foundations of human rights and\r\ninternational human rights law by claiming that such\r\nrights are conditional. It is our duty to protect all\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, regardless of\r\nour varying political, economic and cultural systems.\r\nMr. Azor (Haiti) (spoke in French): The report of\r\nthe Secretary-General before us is of considerable\r\nimportance in the context of achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. The same is true of the item\r\nentitled “The role of the United Nations in promoting a\r\nnew global human order”.\r\nMy delegation welcomes with great satisfaction\r\nthe proposals concerning the commemoration in 2006\r\nof the tenth anniversary of the resumed fiftieth session\r\nof the General Assembly on public administration and\r\ndevelopment, contained in the report in document\r\nA/59/346.\r\nThe weakness of State institutions in developing\r\ncountries is without any doubt a serious obstacle to\r\ntheir socio-economic development and harms their\r\nchances for achieving sustainable development. It\r\nnecessarily leads to poor management of available\r\nresources and favours corruption. Therefore, it is\r\nindisputable that an efficient public administration can\r\nplay a vital role in the process of social organization\r\nand the creation of wealth — to which we all aspire.\r\nSince the 1970s, many countries have applied\r\nmethods of private sector management to public\r\nenterprises. Applying the laws of the market to the\r\npublic sector, however, has not necessarily improved\r\nthe performance of the administration. It should be\r\nnoted that the notion of governance emerged in order\r\nto correct the malfunctions in administration by\r\nstressing certain values such as equity, transparency\r\nand accountability in government affairs.\r\nWe concur with many other countries that we\r\nmust strike a balance between reform of administration\r\nand reform of governance. In other words, we must\r\nsucceed in establishing an administration based on the\r\nrule of law and a shared governance, with social and\r\ncultural aspects as a common denominator, if we really\r\nwish to build up a genuine leadership class capable of\r\nguiding the new changes that the State is undergoing.\r\nThat endeavour must stress the need to establish\r\nand comply with adequate legislation to strengthen\r\nState institutions. Proper training and rational handling\r\nof public sector human resources, encouraging and\r\nstimulating expertise and innovation, and using\r\ninformation technologies can all strengthen public\r\nadministration.\r\nIn the legislation of States, careers and\r\nadvancement in public administration are generally\r\nguaranteed; that is often what motivates officials. The\r\nfailure to respect that requirement is harmful to the\r\nproper functioning of public administration and\r\nintensifies the frustration and lack of interest felt by\r\nstaff, often leading to acts of irresponsibility and\r\ncorruption. It is likewise important that the\r\nqualifications of public officials be consonant with\r\ntheir duties.\r\nToday my country is irrevocably committed to a\r\npath of transition that aims to be both viable and\r\nirreversible. We need to emphasize the re-\r\nestablishment and normal functioning of our national\r\ninstitutions, which have been weakened or that simply\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\ndo not exist as a result of the various socio-political\r\ncrises that the country has undergone. In that regard,\r\nthe provisional Government intends to reform the\r\nHaitian public administration — without resorting to\r\nwitch hunts — so as to enable it to play its proper role\r\nin the development process.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the resolve expressed\r\nby the international community to help restore and\r\nstrengthen Haitian national institutions in full respect\r\nfor the rule of law. We encourage a long-term\r\nassistance strategy based on specific measures to\r\nprovide lasting remedies for the shortcomings of our\r\ninstitutions. If we are to meet the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, we must address significant\r\nstructural challenges in view of the situation of socio-\r\neconomic decay and poor institutional functioning in\r\nour developing countries.\r\nI turn now to the extremely important question of\r\nthe role of the United Nations in promoting a new\r\nglobal human order. Creating a new global human\r\norder was once the great concern of philosophers and\r\nstatesmen. Even in medieval times, there were those\r\nwho wrestled with metaphysics in order to give\r\nhumankind its proper place in the universe.\r\nIn 1945, almost 60 years ago, the founders of this\r\nOrganization eloquently reformulated that humanistic\r\ntheory in their own fashion by articulating, in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and the promotion of\r\nsocio-economic development among the main purposes\r\nand principles of the world Organization. Later, the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights enshrined the\r\nsacred nature of respect for the physical integrity of\r\nhuman individuals and their social and economic\r\nrights, which are the foremost among rights. Thus, we\r\nmust restore humankind to its true place. The 2000\r\nMillennium Declaration is a genuine model for human\r\nrehabilitation.\r\nUnfortunately, the course of history, with its\r\nprocession of wars, atrocities, slavery and the slave\r\ntrade, racial discrimination and xenophobia, amounts\r\nto a series of systematic violations of human rights.\r\nTerrorism, organized transnational crime, the illicit\r\ndrug trade and the HIV/AIDS pandemic are all grave\r\nthreats to the survival of humankind.\r\nNowadays, hunger and poverty threaten the\r\nsurvival of humankind on our planet. It is dismaying\r\nand painful to note that most of our brothers huddle in\r\nfilth and seek shelter in shantytowns. The correlation\r\nbetween migration and poverty is growing ever more\r\ndirect and challenges our leaders to the highest degree.\r\nHundreds of millions of human beings live in\r\nsubhuman physical conditions, with the sole prospect\r\nof poverty and a marginal existence before them. They\r\ndo not even have access to drinking water. More than\r\n1.2 billion people in the developing world survive on\r\nless than $1 a day, while 800 million suffer from\r\nmalnutrition and 153 million children under the age of\r\nfive are dangerously underweight.\r\nMoreover, education is denied to a multitude of\r\nchildren who never manage to finish their primary\r\nstudies. Epidemics are killing our peoples. The process\r\nof environmental degradation is accelerating, with\r\noften disastrous consequences. My country recently\r\npaid the price of that with the passage of tropical storm\r\nJeanne. The rights of our peoples are constantly being\r\ntrampled underfoot.\r\nFurthermore, the requirements of economic\r\nglobalization — which are often ill-suited to the socio-\r\neconomic realities of our States, prioritizing the laws\r\nof the market to the detriment of human beings — do\r\nnot offer our peoples opportunities but impoverish\r\nthem and may well give rise to social disruption and\r\nsituations of grave political instability, thus delaying\r\nthe process of development.\r\nDevelopment, through the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, means breaking down\r\nthe barriers of ignorance and poverty and elevating\r\nhuman beings to their full dignity. That will require the\r\ngenuine commitment of the leaders of developing\r\ncountries, resolved to adopting a policy of reform and\r\nto strengthening governance to the benefit of their\r\npopulations. If we are to achieve those objectives, it is\r\nalso essential that we aim at a global partnership in\r\nwhich the rich countries reaffirm their commitment to\r\nproviding genuine assistance.\r\nIt is true that States must be determined to\r\nundertake the genuine democratization of societies and\r\nthe effective rebuilding of institutions. However, the\r\nsupport of the United Nations is highly necessary in\r\nassisting Governments to formulate efficient policies to\r\naddress the challenges and to grasp the opportunities of\r\nan urbanizing world.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation echoes the appeal\r\nmade by the Secretary-General in 2003 in his report on\r\nthe implementation of the Millennium Declaration, in\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\nwhich he wrote that access to the markets of the\r\ndeveloped countries, increased official development\r\nassistance and debt relief would give the developing\r\ncountries a fair chance of reducing the extreme poverty\r\nthat prevails within their borders.\r\nMs. Iamsudha (Thailand): This statement is\r\nbeing delivered on behalf of the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Thailand to the United Nations.\r\nThailand firmly believes that the realization of a\r\npeople-centred approach to development and the\r\nempowerment of individuals, particularly through the\r\ngoals of poverty eradication, achieving full\r\nemployment and enhancing social integration, is\r\ninextricably linked to international peace and security.\r\nIn that conviction, Thailand attaches great importance\r\nto the work of the Economic and Social Council, which\r\nis the principal policy body of the United Nations, after\r\nthe General Assembly, entrusted with the formal\r\nauthority for coordinating activities related to\r\ninternational economic and social development.\r\nMy delegation has carefully studied the report\r\nsubmitted by the Economic and Social Council and\r\nwishes to share some views to contribute to the\r\nstrengthening of the Council’s work, as follows.\r\nThailand believes that the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) could serve as a basis for\r\ndefining a more action-oriented Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and for providing more focus to the Council’s\r\nwork and agenda. However, the Council should be\r\ngiven an increased and clearly defined role as a forum\r\nfor reviewing and evaluating the United Nations\r\nsystem-wide efforts to achieve the MDGs.\r\nIn this globalized and fast-moving world, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council’s credibility very much\r\ndepends on its ability to respond in a more timely and\r\nflexible manner to current crises or opportunities. As a\r\nresult, it may be imperative for the Council to enjoy\r\nthe flexibility of holding, on an as-needed basis, more\r\nad hoc focus meetings on critical and urgent issues.\r\nIn order to increase its visibility and political\r\nprofile, the Economic and Social Council would need,\r\nas a priority, to increase its expertise and specialization\r\nin economic and social issues. The Council may also\r\nbenefit from the convening of increased high-level\r\npolicy debates on cross-sectoral economic and social\r\ndevelopment issues, involving a cross-section of\r\ngovernmental representatives, as well as those from the\r\ninternational financial institutions, civil society and the\r\nprivate sector. Consideration of such interrelated issues\r\nas global macro-economic strategy and management,\r\nthe adequacy of funds for financing development, and\r\nthe implementation of the MDGs should be\r\nencouraged, as they could greatly assist the Economic\r\nand Social Council in the conduct of its work.\r\nTo streamline and enhance the efficiency of its\r\nwork, the Economic and Social Council needs to focus\r\nits activities on its primary raison d’être, which is\r\nserving as an overarching policy body for the\r\nnumerous programmes and commissions it oversees.\r\nWith regard to its relationship with other bodies,\r\ninstitutions and civil society, the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil should continue to develop public-private\r\npartnerships, and promote public awareness of\r\ndevelopment issues. As one of civil society’s main\r\nformal links with the United Nations, the Council\r\nshould continue to identify ways that would enable\r\ncivil society to more efficiently and substantively\r\ncontribute to its work. There should be greater\r\nemphasis on the involvement of the private sector in\r\nthe United Nations global development agenda.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council should also\r\ndevelop more established coordination with\r\ninternational financial organizations and regional\r\neconomic groupings — for example the World Bank,\r\nthe International Monetary Fund, the World Trade\r\nOrganization, the Group of Eight and the Group of\r\nTwenty — by encouraging them to present their annual\r\nreports for comment and evaluation by the Council.\r\nSuch an approach is not intended to be intrusive, but to\r\nensure overall coherence, to strengthen each\r\norganization’s political accountability and to foster\r\ngenuine partnerships with the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn addition to forging closer partnerships with\r\nother related organizations, the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil also needs to expand its coordination with the\r\nSecurity Council on specific economic security\r\nsituations, as well as enhance coordination with the\r\nGeneral Assembly to strengthen complementarity and,\r\nat the same time, avoid unnecessary duplication of\r\nwork.\r\nIn Thailand’s view, the concept of creating a\r\nframework for the promotion of a new global human\r\norder emphasizes the strengthening of multilateral\r\ndevelopment cooperation and the adoption of a holistic\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\napproach to socio-economic development. Given the\r\nuniversal nature and recognition of the mandates of the\r\nUnited Nations, this global body should undeniably\r\nhave the principal role in promoting a new global\r\nhuman order. Hence, the role and capacity of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council as the principal\r\ncoordinating organ of the United Nations for economic\r\nand social development must also be strengthened to\r\neffectively contribute to the promotion of a global\r\nhuman order.\r\nThailand supports all initiatives and efforts to\r\nstrengthen the role of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. The presentation of its candidature for\r\nelection to the Council this year very much reflects\r\nhow determined Thailand is to actively contribute to\r\nand strengthen the work of the Council, as well as to\r\nhelp bridge the gaps and forge partnerships among\r\ndeveloped, developing and least developed countries\r\nfor the full and effective realization of internationally\r\nagreed development goals.\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): My delegation is\r\npleased to participate in the General Assembly\r\ndeliberations on the report of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil (A/59/3 and Add.1). I would like to express\r\nour deep appreciation to Ambassador Marjatta Rasi of\r\nFinland, the President of the Council, for her able\r\nstewardship and valuable contribution to the successful\r\nwork of the Economic and Social Council during 2004.\r\nWe are pleased to note the Council’s increasing\r\nengagement in promoting economic and social\r\ndevelopment through its policy guidance and\r\nrecommendations. We recognize the important role of\r\nthe Council in ensuring coordinated follow-up to and\r\nimplementation of all major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits, which focused on the need\r\nfor action in line with agreed commitments. In our\r\nview, as its tasks are pursued, the contribution of the\r\nCouncil and the entire United Nations to economic and\r\nsocial development will be widely recognized. The\r\nelaboration of a multi-year working programme based\r\non a cross-sectoral approach is an important added\r\nvalue that further strengthens the Council’s role in the\r\nreview and follow-up process, and we look forward to\r\nthat programme’s early adoption.\r\nMy delegation emphasizes the importance of\r\nincreased interaction by the Council with international\r\nfinancial and trade institutions. We consider the spring\r\nmeetings of the Council, in the broader context of\r\nfinancing for development, to constitute an important\r\ndialogue for promoting coherence, maintaining a\r\ncollaborative approach and evaluating the efficiency of\r\nthe follow-up mechanism to Monterrey.\r\nIn the implementation process, the support of the\r\nfunctional commissions is crucial, and in this regard\r\nwe value their efforts to consolidate their work. We\r\nlook forward to the thirteenth session of the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development and believe\r\nthat a policy session should produce action-oriented\r\npolicy options based on the outcome of the review\r\nsession and the details of each thematic review. Policy\r\ncoherence is essential, and the session should identify\r\npossible actions in which cross-cutting issues are\r\nidentified in the means of implementation.\r\nAzerbaijan supports the strengthening of the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees (UNHCR). Furthermore, we believe that the\r\nUNHCR request that a mechanism be established to\r\naddress the complex problem of internal displacement\r\nwill be positively considered. In the meantime, we\r\nwelcome the Council’s recommendation to increase the\r\nmembership of the Executive Committee of the High\r\nCommissioner’s Programme.\r\nWe value the efforts to streamline the working\r\nmethods of the Council, including through improving\r\ndialogue with the Bureaux of the functional\r\ncommissions. That would allow the Council to focus\r\nits attention on the specific issues requiring the\r\nmobilization of a system-wide response from the\r\nUnited Nations. In this connection, we consider\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions 50/227 and 52/12 B to\r\nconstitute a basic framework for continuing those\r\nefforts.\r\nIn conclusion, let me stress the importance of the\r\ncontribution of the Economic and Social Council to the\r\npreparations for the high-level plenary meeting of\r\n2005, in accordance with General Assembly resolution\r\n58/291.\r\nMr. Suazo (Honduras) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\nstatement will relate to item 12 of the agenda: the\r\nreport of the Economic and Social Council (A/59/3 and\r\nAdd.1). Allow me first to express my thanks to\r\nAmbassador Marjatta Rasi of Finland for her\r\nintroduction of the report and for the excellent job that\r\nshe has been doing at the head of the Council during\r\nthe past year.\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\nMy delegation would like to make some purely\r\nprocedural comments in this regard. The report of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council is of particular\r\nimportance to developing countries, in particular the\r\nleast developed countries, countries falling under the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\r\nInitiative and small island States that are highly\r\nvulnerable environmentally. Honduras falls into those\r\ncategories in more than one respect, and that is why we\r\nhave particular interest in this report. It basically gives\r\nan overview of activities relating to the coordination of\r\ninternational cooperation and the related political\r\ndecision-making process. At the same time, it presents\r\nthe General Assembly with recommendations\r\nconcerning the policies to be pursued.\r\nSince this is the first time that the report is being\r\nconsidered and presented directly to the Assembly for\r\napproval, this new procedure deserves special attention\r\nand consideration. As everyone knows, in the past the\r\nvarious topics and sections of the report were\r\nconsidered in the Second Committee of the General\r\nAssembly. That enabled delegations to hear and\r\nexchange opinions with the officials responsible for the\r\nvarious divisions of the Secretariat’s Department of\r\nEconomic and Social Affairs in order to discuss\r\neconomic and social policies.\r\nThis interaction made it possible to raise\r\nquestions, deal with complaints, propose solutions and\r\nclarify concepts concerning the contents of the report\r\non areas of the Council’s work. It also eased the\r\nlegislative process of the Committee before draft\r\nresolutions passed on to the Assembly.\r\nThe reform approved at the last session has now\r\nleft us without this essential step of consultation and\r\ndialogue, as the report has now come directly to the\r\nplenary. This is a matter of concern, and we believe\r\nthat a mechanism needs to be found to rectify this lack\r\nof communication, coordination and information\r\nbetween delegations and the Department of Economic\r\nand Social Affairs of the Secretariat.\r\nDelegations, particularly those to which I referred\r\nearlier — small island States, the least developed\r\ncountries and the HIPC countries — cannot be\r\ndeprived of up-to-date information on issues that are\r\nsosensitive for their development. At the same time,\r\nwe need to consider the possibility of facilitating the\r\nactivities of delegations, as they work in the General\r\nAssembly. Generally speaking, delegates to the\r\nEconomic and Social Council are, by the nature of the\r\nsubject matter, representatives in the Second\r\nCommittee. Missions now have to redouble their\r\nefforts during consideration of the Council’s report in\r\nplenary.\r\nLastly, my delegation wishes to point out the\r\nneed for greater and better coordination between the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Security\r\nCouncil. Steps taken thus far are positive, but much\r\nremains to be done. The constant reform and\r\nrevitalization of the Economic and Social Council is a\r\njoint undertaking.\r\nIn the course of this debate, my delegation will be\r\nproposing, together with some other friendly countries,\r\na draft resolution on public administration and\r\ndevelopment, which we hope will receive the support\r\nof this Assembly. The draft resolution is designed to\r\nfollow up on programmes to combat corruption and\r\npromote good practices in the management of public\r\nservices, information technology at the service of the\r\ncivilian population and e-government. Its main purpose\r\nis to provide follow-up to the legislative process in this\r\nregard, which previously took place in the Second\r\nCommittee on a consensus basis.\r\nIn a constructive spirit, we shall be looking at the\r\npossibility of recommending the inclusion of specific\r\neconomic and social items on the agenda of the Second\r\nCommittee.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on these two agenda items. The\r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its\r\nconsideration of agenda items 12 and 41.\r\nAgenda items 35 and 47\r\nCulture of peace\r\nNotes by the Secretary-General (A/59/201 and\r\nA/59/223)\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.15)\r\nSport for peace and development: International Year\r\nof Sport and Physical Education\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/59/268)\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.9)\r\nThe Acting President: I invite the representative\r\nof Tunisia to introduce draft resolution A/59/L.9.\r\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): On\r\nbehalf of the delegation of Tunisia, I would like to read\r\nto the General Assembly the following statement:\r\nAs we are celebrating the fifty-ninth anniversary\r\nof the International Day of the United Nations, we\r\naffirm our respect for the noble purposes and principles\r\nof the United Nations Charter, for which it was created.\r\nThese objectives include working for peace, security\r\nand development and the means to achieve these ends.\r\nAt a time when the international community is\r\npreparing to celebrate the year 2005 as the\r\nInternational Year of Sport and Physical Education, in\r\naccordance with resolution 58/5, adopted unanimously\r\non 3 November 2003, Tunisia would like to take this\r\nopportunity to reiterate its thanks to States, regional\r\nand international organizations and the United Nations\r\nspecialized agencies, all of which supported the\r\nadoption of that resolution.\r\nWe hope that draft resolution A/59/L.9, which is\r\naimed at implementing the desired objectives in the\r\nfields of education, health and society and at\r\nconsolidating peace and development throughout the\r\nworld, will receive support and consideration by all\r\nparties.\r\nTunisia is convinced of the importance of sport\r\nand physical education, which are vital factors for\r\nmental and physical health and serve to promote social\r\ncohesion. My country reaffirms that the cultural and\r\ndevelopment dimensions of this draft resolution are\r\nconsonant with international goals, in particular the\r\nMillennium Declaration, which called for greater\r\ncooperation, coordination, tolerance, solidarity,\r\nconsultation and dialogue.\r\nIn our view, it is up to the international\r\ncommunity to establish sound foundations for physical\r\nand sport-related activities within the framework of the\r\nnecessary material and social conditions, so as to\r\ncounter anything that could impede sports activities\r\nand development. These include items that would\r\nendanger mental and physical health, in particular,\r\nsteroid use — doping — or using sportsmen for\r\ncommercial purposes. This means that we must adopt\r\nsome mechanisms that would enable us to protect\r\nathletes under the principles articulated in the United\r\nNations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It also\r\nrequires that we confront any person or situation that\r\nmight try to flout the rules of sports conduct or act in\r\ncontravention of the rules of fair play.\r\nOnce again, we would like to say that health,\r\ndevelopment, peace and education are the four\r\ndimensions that this draft resolution wishes to\r\nstrengthen. Those objectives can be implemented only\r\nthrough close cooperation among all of the sport and\r\ninternational agencies, so that we can adopt effective\r\nand innovative measures that will make a contribution\r\nto implementing the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nparticularly in developing countries, and to helping\r\nthem to build their capacities and adopt practical\r\nmeasures in sport-related activities and physical\r\neducation.\r\nTunisia hopes that the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity and all concerned parties will be\r\ncoordinated so that we can hold programmes and\r\npurposeful events on all levels during the International\r\nYear for Sport and Physical Education that will enable\r\nus to attain the draft resolution’s objectives by\r\npromoting activities to strengthen the principle of sport\r\nwithout violence or steroid use. We hope that in 2005\r\nthe international sporting community will be able to\r\nadopt an international convention to fight the use of\r\nsteroids, as well as a sports “code of good practice”.\r\nI now have the honour to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.9, entitled “Sport as a means to\r\npromote education, health, development and peace”.\r\nSince the publication of that document, the following\r\ncountries have joined the list of sponsors: Argentina,\r\nArmenia, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Brunei\r\nDarussalam, Cape Verde, the Central African Republic,\r\nCosta Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, El Salvador, Eritrea, Georgia, Ghana,\r\nIndonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan,\r\nLiechtenstein, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Malaysia,\r\nMoldova, Monaco, Mongolia, Oman, Pakistan, Palau,\r\nPanama, Portugal, Rwanda, Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, the Sudan,\r\nThailand, Timor-Leste, Trinidad and Tobago,\r\nTurkmenistan, Ukraine, Viet Nam and Yemen.\r\nThe draft resolution before us — which is based\r\non General Assembly 58/5 — has garnered broad\r\nsupport and is the result of collective effort; we\r\nengaged in thorough consultations before submitting it\r\nto the Assembly along with the above-mentioned\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\ncountries. I should like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress sincere appreciation and thanks to all the\r\ndelegations and United Nations organs that took an\r\ninterest in the draft resolution for their contributions\r\nand for helping us to achieve the desired objectives of\r\nthe International Year for Sport and Physical\r\nEducation. In particular, I wish to thank Mr. Adolf Ogi,\r\nSpecial Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for\r\nDevelopment and Peace, and Jacques Rogge, President\r\nof the International Olympic Committee, for their\r\nconstant efforts in that regard.\r\nLike resolution 58/5, this draft resolution\r\naddresses the objectives of sport and physical\r\neducation in today’s world. It calls upon Governments\r\nand governmental agencies, as well as other sport-\r\nrelated bodies, to organize international sporting events\r\ncommemorating the International Year for Sport and\r\nPhysical Education and thus to express their\r\ncommitment to implementing one of its objectives:\r\nstrengthening the role of sport and physical education\r\nin development programmes and policies in order to\r\nspread a culture of peace and the values of dialogue\r\nand understanding among peoples. The draft resolution\r\nalso seeks to encourage Governments and international\r\nsporting bodies to undertake development projects and\r\npartnerships that will assist in the implementation of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and will help\r\ndeveloping countries to build their sport and physical\r\neducation capacities. Moreover, the draft resolution\r\nproposes a range of measures aimed at helping us to\r\nmake sport and physical education a way to make the\r\nworld safer. It stresses that international conventions\r\nmust be implemented to prevent the use of steroids in\r\nall sports.\r\nWe have learned that, in the light of the various\r\ncommitments that have been undertaken, Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan will launch the International Year\r\nfor Sport and Physical Education on 5 November 2004\r\nrather than on 27 October. Accordingly, operative\r\nparagraph 2 should read:\r\n“Decides to launch, on 5 November 2004,\r\nthe International Year for Sport and Physical\r\nEducation, as a means to promote education,\r\nhealth, development and peace”.\r\nIn conclusion, the Tunisian delegation, together\r\nwith the other sponsoring delegations, would like to\r\nexpress the hope that the General Assembly will adopt\r\nthis draft resolution and launch the International Year\r\nfor Sport and Physical Education — a year that will\r\nhelp to ensure peace, security and development\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of the Philippines to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.15.\r\nMr. Baja (Philippines): I have the honour to\r\nintroduce the Philippine draft resolution entitled\r\n“Promotion of cooperation among religions”\r\n(A/59/L.15), under agenda item 35, “Culture of peace”.\r\nThe brevity of our draft resolution is in\r\nconformity with the Assembly’s decision to streamline\r\nall draft resolutions. Although the draft is self-\r\nexplanatory, we will soon hold informal consultations\r\non it, in keeping with customary practice.\r\nThe Philippines introduced a draft resolution last\r\nyear on the same subject. We let the concept germinate\r\nin the minds of delegation members and in their\r\ncapitals for a year. Recent positive developments have\r\nreinforced our belief that it is now opportune to\r\nintroduce a revised version during the current session. I\r\nshould just like to highlight three of those encouraging\r\ndevelopments.\r\nFirst, the Panel of Eminent Persons created by the\r\nSecretary-General last year to review the relationship\r\nbetween civil society and the United Nations stated in\r\nparagraph 156 of the results of its work — also known\r\nas the Cardoso report (A/58/817) — that some civil\r\nsociety constituencies, including religious and spiritual\r\ngroups, “deserve greater attention by the United\r\nNations because of their explicit representational roles\r\nor wide memberships”. I should like to cite five\r\nimportant functions of religious and spiritual groups\r\nmentioned in the same paragraph. They provide\r\npowerful community leadership, shape public opinion,\r\nprovide advice on ethical matters, facilitate\r\nreconciliation between conflicting communities and\r\nidentify the needs of vulnerable groups. Nations are\r\naware of those important functions. Their reiteration by\r\nthe Panel of Eminent Persons reminds us of the\r\nuniversal understanding on the need for the elimination\r\nof all forms of religious intolerance.\r\nSecondly, UNESCO made significant conclusions\r\nin its report entitled “Promotion of religious and\r\ncultural understanding, harmony and cooperation” (see\r\nA/59/201), transmitted in accordance with resolution\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\n58/128. I would like to refer to a number of UNESCO’s\r\nconclusions.\r\nFirst, the report states, in paragraph 33:\r\n“A particularly important dimension of the\r\ndialogue among civilizations is interreligious\r\ndialogue, which implies dialogue both among\r\nreligions and within a single religion. Indeed, the\r\nkey issue raised by the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations is the place of ethics in the\r\nrelationship between societies, peoples and\r\nindividuals.”\r\nSecondly, paragraph 35 states:\r\n“In this context, world religions and beliefs\r\ncould contribute tremendously to the promotion\r\nof a culture of peace if they resolve to, on the one\r\nhand, collectively face the problems confronting\r\nthe world today, such as terrorism and sectarian\r\nviolence, while, on the other hand, practice\r\ntolerance within their respective religious\r\ncommunities and in their inter-faith relations.”\r\nThirdly, the heads of State or Government of the\r\nAsia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) decided at their summit,\r\nwhich took place earlier this month in Hanoi and was\r\nco-chaired by Viet Nam and the Netherlands, to launch\r\nan initiative entitled “Interfaith Dialogue”. ASEM is an\r\ninterregional grouping of States members of the\r\nEuropean Union and of the Association of South-East\r\nAsian Nations, China, Japan and the Republic of\r\nKorea. The theme of this landmark ASEM initiative,\r\nsponsored by Indonesia and the United Kingdom, is\r\n“Building interfaith harmony within the international\r\ncommunity”. Its objectives are, first, to foster mutual\r\nrespect among all faiths and religions in Asia and\r\nEurope, secondly, to propose recommendations to\r\nactualize interfaith harmony within the international\r\ncommunity and, thirdly, to enhance the role of\r\nreligious civil society in the conduct of second-track\r\ndiplomacy.\r\nDuring the most recent ASEM summit, the\r\nPhilippine President, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo,\r\nstrongly supported the Indonesian and British proposal\r\nfor an interfaith dialogue to help prevent terrorism and\r\nto promote religious understanding as a component of\r\nthe dialogue among civilizations and cultures. In that\r\nregard, the President also called for the activation of\r\nthe ASEM caucus in the United Nations to give\r\nimpetus to the idea.\r\nAll those developments validate the vision of the\r\nSpeaker of the Philippine Congress, Mr. José de\r\nVenecia, who proposed the topic to the leaders of the\r\nUnited States, the European Union and Asia as early as\r\ntwo years ago as a subject whose time for serious\r\nconsideration and action has come. The Secretary of\r\nForeign Affairs of the Philippines highlighted this\r\ntheme in his address to the General Assembly last\r\nmonth.\r\nThose three developments underpin the\r\nimportance of the draft resolution that my delegation is\r\nintroducing today. The Philippines has publicly\r\nrecognized the important functions of religious and\r\nspiritual groups as outlined by the Panel of Eminent\r\nPersons on United Nations-Civil Society Relations. In\r\nfact, the Philippines translated this recognition into\r\nconcrete action when it utilized the services of an\r\ninterfaith group in helping to solve our problem in the\r\nsouthern Philippines.\r\nThe Philippines, based on its own experience,\r\nstrongly endorses the UNESCO conclusions on the\r\nvital role that religions play in the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations and in the promotion of the culture of\r\npeace.\r\nOther developments stress the urgent need for\r\ncooperation among religions. Senegal is reported to be\r\norganizing, in the near future, an international\r\nconference of all religions to seek their views on how\r\nthey can contribute to alleviating pressing international\r\nconcerns. The religious leaders of Eritrea and Ethiopia\r\nreportedly met to help carve out a lasting peace\r\nbetween their two countries. During the general debate\r\nlast month, the President of the Government of Spain\r\nproposed the creation of an alliance of civilizations\r\nbetween the Western and the Arab and Muslim worlds,\r\nand he intends to submit a proposal to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the establishment of a high-level group to\r\nconsider the matter.\r\nIn our host country, the United States, there are\r\ninterreligious fellowships that are successfully\r\ncooperating to help themselves and the homeless and to\r\naddress other social problems. Other countries have\r\ntheir own interfaith mechanisms, supported by their\r\nGovernments or by non-governmental organizations.\r\nAll these positive national experiences have to be\r\nmade known and to be shared. This is the reason why\r\nthe Philippines is proposing, in its draft resolution, that\r\nthe Secretary-General seek the views of Governments\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\nand other bodies on how cooperation among religions\r\ncan be promoted and further enhanced.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like once again to invite\r\nthe attention of this body to the Declaration issued by\r\nthe Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional\r\nReligions, held in Kazakhstan. They expressed their\r\ncommon desire for peace, aversion to violence, support\r\nfor development, promotion of harmony and mutual\r\nunderstanding and cooperation for the avoidance of\r\nconflict and the fostering of goodwill — the raison\r\nd’être of A/59/L.15.\r\nMr. Hackett (Barbados): I have the honour to\r\nspeak, on behalf of the States members of the\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM), on agenda item\r\n47, entitled “Sport for peace and development:\r\nInternational Year of Sport and Physical Education”.\r\nI would like first of all to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report contained in document A/59/268,\r\nwhich describes activities undertaken and planned in\r\nsupport of the International Year.\r\nCARICOM countries endorse the objectives of\r\nthe United Nations system for the International Year of\r\nSport and Physical Education, as summarized in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, and we are committed to\r\nundertaking activities in support of the Year.\r\nWe agree that sport can be used as a powerful\r\npromoter of development and peace. Furthermore, we\r\nbelieve that this can begin with children, since sport is\r\na participatory way for children and young people to\r\nlearn values and lessons that can be long lasting. That\r\nis why CARICOM countries appreciate the efforts of\r\nthe Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport\r\nfor Development and Peace in raising awareness with\r\nregard to strengthening physical education and sport in\r\neducation systems. We also applaud UNICEF for\r\nplacing greater emphasis on this issue in its work\r\nprogrammes.\r\nSport also promotes the spirit of friendship,\r\nsolidarity and fair play and teaches teamwork,\r\ndiscipline, leadership, trust, respect for others and even\r\ncoping skills. Sporting activities can provide a\r\nsupportive and self-sustaining environment that can\r\nhelp to prepare young people to meet the difficult\r\nchallenges that they are almost certain to experience in\r\ntheir lives.\r\nCARICOM countries have a long history of using\r\nsport in schools for such child-development purposes.\r\nChanging societal values are, however, creating new\r\nchallenges for successfully incorporating sports in this\r\nway, and we look forward to working with UNICEF\r\nand UNESCO in incorporating sports and physical\r\neducation into some of their country and regional\r\nCaribbean programmes.\r\nAs cricket-playing countries, we also encourage\r\nUNICEF to include the global and regional governing\r\nbodies of cricket-playing countries in their partnerships\r\nwith the sports world. The CARICOM region will host\r\nthe Cricket World Cup Championship in 2007, and we\r\nbelieve that the period between now and the start of the\r\nchampionship would be an opportune time for the\r\nlaunch of such a partnership.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nSport serves as a bridge linking different nations,\r\ndifferent civilizations and different beliefs. The\r\ncontemporary Olympic Games have reinforced the\r\nhuman pursuit of the spirit of peace, development and\r\nself-improvement. The Olympic concept of “higher,\r\nfaster and stronger” is already deeply rooted in the\r\nhearts of the peoples of the world, including its youth.\r\nThis was clearly shown by the success of the XXVIIIth\r\nOlympic Games and the 12th Paralympic Games in\r\nAthens this year. Here we would like to thank the\r\nGovernment and the people of Greece for their\r\ncontribution to that effort.\r\nThe United Nations, in the context of promoting\r\nworld peace and development, has done a great deal of\r\nwork to publicize the Olympic spirit. The General\r\nAssembly adopted a resolution last year proclaiming\r\n2005 the International Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation. We hope that the international community\r\nwill take advantage of this opportunity to abide by the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United\r\nNations, promote peace and development through\r\nsport, advocate dialogue and exchange among different\r\ncivilizations, and strive to build a world of peace and\r\nprosperity.\r\nThe Chinese Government attaches great\r\nimportance to the development of sport. Our\r\nfundamental goal is to achieve better health for the\r\npeople and improve the national physique. Since 1995,\r\nwhen the Chinese Government promulgated the\r\n“Programme to Build National Health”, China has\r\nwitnessed a series of marked achievements in its\r\nundertakings in the area of sport. Public awareness of\r\nhealth and how to improve it has been heightened,\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\nmass sports activities are multiplying, and physical\r\neducation is a major course requirement at the primary,\r\nsecondary and tertiary educational levels.\r\nAt this year’s Olympic Games in Athens, the\r\nChinese team won 32 gold medals — a historical\r\nrecord. At the 12th Paralympics which followed, the\r\nChinese team ranked first in terms of gold medals and\r\ntotal number of medals. Chinese athletes have added a\r\nremarkable chapter to the annals of the Games in their\r\nbirthplace, sharing Olympic glory and the Olympic\r\ndream with lovers of the Olympics the world over.\r\nIn 2008, China will host the XXIXth Olympic\r\nGames and the 13th Paralympic Games in Beijing. The\r\nChinese Government and people are working whole-\r\nheartedly and making every effort to prepare for those\r\nevents. The construction of stadiums and facilities and\r\nthe development of the necessary bio-environmental,\r\nsocial and urban infrastructure are all under way in an\r\norderly manner. We will continue to work with the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee and other\r\nGovernments further to display the Olympic spirit and\r\ntry our utmost to make the Beijing Olympic Games a\r\nwonderful occasion to maintain peace, promote\r\ndevelopment, enhance exchanges among different\r\ncivilizations, and strengthen friendship among the\r\npeoples of all countries.\r\nMr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French): I\r\nwill be speaking on agenda item 47 today.\r\nMy delegation took note with great interest of the\r\nreport by the Secretary-General on sport in the service\r\nof peace and development and the International Year of\r\nSport and Physical Education. We are also pleased that\r\nthis report is being discussed at the same time as the\r\ndraft resolution on sport as a means of promoting\r\neducation, health, development and peace.\r\nBoth texts underline once again the fact that sport\r\ncan make a remarkable contribution to the promotion\r\nof peace and to the pursuit of several development\r\ngoals — be they individual, social, cultural or\r\neconomic. Sport encompasses fundamental human\r\nvalues that correspond to those of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations — for example, respect for opponents,\r\nacceptance of rules, fair play and team spirit.\r\nSwitzerland has for a long time now been taking\r\na variety of measures to promote the effective use of\r\nsport for peace and development.\r\nAt the initiative of Mr. Adolf Ogi, Special\r\nAdviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for\r\nDevelopment and Peace and former President of the\r\nSwiss Confederation, Switzerland held the\r\nInternational Conference on Sport and Development at\r\nMacolin in February 2003. That event brought together\r\n380 representatives of 55 countries, from all segments\r\nof society, to exchange information and to compare\r\ntheir experiences. The Macolin Declaration and the\r\nrecommendations that were adopted on that occasion\r\nare a source of inspiration and guidelines throughout\r\nthe world for activities in the field of sport and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn its development cooperation and humanitarian\r\naid activities, Switzerland supports numerous projects\r\nand programmes in which sport is considered a means\r\nof achieving human, social and economic goals.\r\nThe International Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation is an excellent opportunity to raise the\r\nawareness of various levels of society as to the\r\ntremendous potential of sport in the promotion of\r\npeace, development and health. This Year of Sport\r\n2005 will also encourage cooperation between different\r\nactors and will enable them to form lasting\r\npartnerships. Switzerland will contribute to the\r\nrealization of those goals at the international and\r\nnational levels.\r\nAt the international level, my country intends to\r\ncontinue to support Mr. Adolf Ogi, Special Adviser to\r\nthe Secretary-General on Sport for Development and\r\nPeace, and to provide financing and logistical support\r\nto the United Nations Office in Geneva for the\r\nInternational Year of Sport and Physical Education. We\r\nwill be convening the second International Conference\r\non Sport and Development in Macolin from 4 to\r\n6 December 2005. This Conference will be the\r\nhighlight, and will also mark the end, of the\r\nInternational Year of Sport 2005. Switzerland will also\r\npublish a brochure on “Sport for Development and\r\nPeace” in which authors from different countries will\r\npresent a synthesis of current experiences and\r\nconclusions and will identify development\r\nopportunities that can still be exploited.\r\nWe will continue systematically to integrate sport\r\nin Switzerland’s development cooperation and\r\nhumanitarian aid and to strengthen its role by regularly\r\nexchanging information with bilateral and multilateral\r\ndevelopment organizations.\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\nAt the national level, Switzerland has established\r\na national committee for the International Year of Sport\r\nconsisting of Government bodies, sport associations,\r\nnon-governmental organizations, and representatives in\r\nthe fields of business and science. The committee’s\r\nmandate is to coordinate activities with schools, sport\r\nassociations, non-governmental organizations and the\r\nbusiness and science spheres. It is expected that several\r\nthousand events will be organized in Switzerland to\r\nmark the International Year of Sport.\r\nAt the national level, the events planned include\r\n“Schools on the Move”, where, in more than 1,000\r\nclasses, children will play sports every day during the\r\nschool term; “Switzerland on the Move”, which will\r\nfeature a sporting event in which the entire population\r\ncan take part, to be held in the majority of\r\nSwitzerland’s 2,900 communes; and, finally, an\r\neducational campaign on sport and development in\r\nSwiss schools.\r\nThe draft resolution to be discussed today fully\r\nreflects this spirit. It invites all actors to strengthen\r\ntheir commitment and their cooperation in the field of\r\nsport for development and peace, with the aim of\r\nachieving not only a healthier but also a more just and\r\npeaceful world. As the host nation of the International\r\nOlympic Committee and of numerous other private\r\nsport associations, Switzerland fully supports this draft\r\nresolution.\r\nMs. Moore (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States delegation welcomes today’s\r\nconsideration of the Assembly’s agenda item “Sport for\r\npeace and development: International Year of Sport\r\nand Physical Education”.\r\nThe United States has a long history of\r\nsupporting international athletic events for\r\nprofessionals and amateurs, including hosting eight\r\nmodern Olympic games. One of America’s proudest\r\ninventions, baseball, has proven to be one of America’s\r\nproudest exports. Little league baseball and softball\r\nleagues have been formed in over 75 countries, with\r\n180,000 teams serving nearly 2.7 million boys and\r\ngirls.\r\nThe United States Government supports\r\ninternational athletic competitions because they\r\npromote understanding and respect for cultural\r\ndiversity, foster international partnerships and increase\r\ngreater awareness of global social issues, such as\r\nhuman rights, the role of women in society, and drug\r\nprevention. Moreover, they generate a deep sense of\r\nnational pride.\r\nAs President Bush recognized just last week in\r\nhosting the United States Olympic team at the White\r\nHouse, international sport allows a country to show its\r\nvalues and character. He praised the virtues that sport\r\ncan reflect: being humble in victory, gracious in defeat,\r\nexpressing compassion for competitors and\r\ndemonstrating great tolerance and diversity within a\r\ncountry.\r\nToday, the Assembly can support the United\r\nNations ideal of teaching the world’s youth not merely\r\nabout sport, but how to use sport to promote friendship,\r\nmutual understanding and well-being. Our delegation\r\njoins the consensus on today’s draft resolution in\r\nsupport of that ideal.\r\nWe thank the Secretariat for its report, entitled\r\n“Sport for peace and development: International Year\r\nof Sport and Physical Education”, contained in\r\ndocument A/59/268 of 16 August 2004. The United\r\nStates will continue to refer to it as we plan activities\r\nfor the International Year and to that end we invite\r\ninput from civil society organizations with a sport\r\nfocus. We look forward to reviewing initiatives to use\r\nsport as a means of promoting intercultural, post-\r\nconflict and peace-building dialogues, as the report\r\nsuggests.\r\nThe report correctly states that sport brings\r\nindividuals and communities together and that it can be\r\na powerful vehicle through which the United Nations\r\ncan work towards achieving its goals. In that vein,\r\nconcerning the draft resolution, the United States\r\nwould like to note that world leaders at the Monterrey\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and at the Johannesburg World Summit\r\non Sustainable Development agreed to support the\r\ninternationally-agreed goals, including those contained\r\nin the Millennium Declaration. We would have\r\npreferred to see the reference in the draft resolution\r\nchanged to that effect.\r\nAlso, we note the report’s review of anti-doping\r\nefforts. The United States supports the process under\r\nway at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization with respect to the negotiation of\r\nan international convention against doping in sport.\r\nThe United States recognizes that the code of good\r\npractice contemplated in the draft resolution would\r\nextend beyond the issue of anti-doping; however, it\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\nwould be appropriate for States drafting such a code to\r\ntake into account the World Anti-Doping Code of\r\nMarch 2003, which has the support of more than 150\r\ncountries. In particular, it would be helpful to avoid a\r\nduplication of effort or the possibility of a conflict\r\nbetween those two instruments.\r\nThe United Nations increasingly attests to the\r\nunifying power of sport and in turn we find the United\r\nNations flag flying over more and more sporting\r\nvenues. Every year, the United Nations hosts more than\r\n12,000 athletes right outside this Hall for a friendship\r\nrun to warm-up for the New York City Marathon, the\r\nworld’s largest spectator sporting event. The next\r\nfriendship run is soon: Saturday, 6 November, at 8 a.m.\r\nThe United States hopes that the International\r\nYear will further dialogue around the world, as we\r\nstrongly believe that sport can be a useful tool of\r\ndiplomacy. Among our sport diplomacy programmes\r\nare those to help educators teach children the\r\nimportance of diversity and cultural understanding,\r\ndone in connection with the National Football League\r\nand foreign citizens studying in the United States as\r\nFulbright scholars. Also, for the first time, the United\r\nStates hosted last summer the International Children’s\r\nGames and Cultural Festival for 2,200 foreign youth.\r\nOur diplomacy initiatives offer training programmes\r\nfor participation by the disabled and other programmes\r\nsend American basketball players abroad to conduct\r\ncoaching clinics and youth tournaments.\r\nDuring the International Year in 2005, the United\r\nStates will host major athletic events. Those include,\r\nfor example, the World Spring Speed Skating\r\nChampionships, the Federation Internationale de\r\nNatation Swimming World Cup, the Luge World\r\nChampionships, the Cycling Elite Track\r\nChampionships, the Show Jumping and Dressage\r\nWorld Cup, and the Union Cyclist Internationale Track\r\nCycling World Championships. These types of\r\nexchanges forge constructive partnerships within the\r\ninternational community not only between athletes, but\r\nalso between organizers, hosts and spectators.\r\nTurning to physical education, for many years the\r\nUnited States President’s Council on Physical Fitness\r\nand Sports has served well as an advisory committee of\r\nvolunteer citizens. Through various creative initiatives,\r\nthe Council promotes health, physical activity, fitness\r\nand enjoyment for people of all ages, backgrounds and\r\nabilities through participation in physical activity and\r\nsport. To promote those activities, President Bush\r\ndesignated May 2004 as our National Physical Fitness\r\nand Sports Month.\r\nSport exercises a deep hold on the human\r\nimagination which is virtually universal and which\r\ndoes not seem to vary from society to society at that\r\nlevel of emotion. Sport transcends all perceived\r\nbarriers across ethnicities, ages, genders, religions and\r\nabilities. It reminds us of our common humanity.\r\nMr. Al-Zaabi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): On behalf of the delegation of the United\r\nArab Emirates, it gives me great pleasure to start my\r\nstatement by thanking the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport and for the valuable information contained\r\ntherein, which we expect to enrich our deliberations on\r\nthis item.\r\nTen years ago, the General Assembly started\r\nobserving the Olympic Truce, a 1,200-year-old sacred\r\nGreek tradition, to prove once again that humanity has\r\na propensity for peace and dialogue, and not for\r\nfighting and wars. The Truce requires the cessation of\r\nall acts of hostility to allow spectators to come and\r\nwatch the competitions and to return to their homes\r\nsafely.\r\nThough the achievement of peace and stability\r\nrequires compliance with the principals of the Charter\r\nand the provisions of relevant international laws and\r\nconventions, the process of promoting and\r\nconsolidating peace should be implemented through\r\nmechanisms of mutual understanding and based on\r\nrespect for and partnership among various cultures,\r\nreligions and civilizations. Those principles were\r\nreflected in the idea of the Olympic Truce, which calls\r\nfor equality and fair competition, regardless of ethnic\r\nbackground, religion, race or nationality of the\r\nathletes. It is an exemplary tool for instilling those\r\ngreat values and disseminating a culture of peace,\r\ntolerance, conciliation and harmony among countries\r\nand peoples.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates welcomes the\r\ninitiatives aimed at strengthening cooperation and\r\npartnership between the United Nations system and the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee, which has already\r\nled to joint activities to advance development, mobilize\r\nhumanitarian assistance, protect the environment and\r\nimprove health and education services. In that context,\r\nwe stress the need to exert special efforts to assist\r\ndeveloping countries, especially the smallest and\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\npoorest among them, to rebuild the infrastructure of\r\ntheir sports institutions and meet training requirements\r\nso that they can actively participate in the Olympic\r\nGames. We also affirm the importance of reaching an\r\ninternational consensus on a code of good practice for\r\nsport and for introducing strategic partnership\r\nprogrammes for all stakeholders and sports-related\r\norganizations, including sports associations and the\r\nprivate sector, in order to disseminate a culture of\r\npeace and to realize sustainable human development.\r\nFurthermore, partnership programmes will also help in\r\ncombating violence, terrorism, crime, illicit trade in\r\ndrugs and many other vices that beset our societies.\r\nIn accordance with the directives of His Highness\r\nSheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, President of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates, and the instructions of his\r\nbrothers, the members of the Federal Supreme Council,\r\nthe rulers of the emirates, great attention has been\r\ndevoted to promoting sport in the youth sector, in\r\nparticular in traditional sport and leisure activities.\r\nEfforts made in that direction have resulted in the\r\nestablishment of the Zayed Sport City in 1979, as a\r\ncultural monument in the region, the Supreme Council\r\nof Youth and Sports and the National Olympic\r\nCommittee, which develops strategies to promote and\r\nsponsor sport activities in the United Arab Emirates,\r\nincluding training, refereeing and fair competition.\r\nAdditional substantial budgetary resources were\r\nallocated to promote the establishment of new and\r\nmodern sports clubs, associations and specialized\r\nteams and modern stadiums across the country. As a\r\nresult, the number of sports clubs in the United Arab\r\nEmirates has increased from 8 in 1970 to 31 clubs\r\ntoday. The number of sports associations and unions\r\nhas also increased — from 3 in 1973 to 23 today —\r\nand that is in addition to 8 girls’ clubs and 25\r\nspecialized sports clubs, including, among others, a\r\nmarine club, a disabled persons’ club, an equestrian\r\nclub, a camel-racing club, a chess club and a wrestling\r\nclub. Those clubs allow the youth of the United Arab\r\nEmirates to develop their skills and to participate\r\neffectively in many regional and international\r\ntournaments and competitions, including the Olympic\r\nGames, where they have won several medals — the\r\nmost recent case being Sheikh Ahmed bin Mohammad\r\nal-Hasher al-Maktoum, who won the first gold medal\r\nfor the United Arab Emirates in the men’s double trap-\r\nshooting competition at the most recent Olympic\r\nGames in Athens in 2004.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates believes that sport and\r\nphysical education should hold a fundamental place in\r\nthe educational system and development, since those\r\ndisciplines contribute to the physical, psychological,\r\neducational and social balance of children and youth.\r\nFirmly convinced of that approach, the United Arab\r\nEmirates has incorporated physical education in its\r\neducational system, including at the primary and\r\nuniversity levels, in order to develop the mental, moral,\r\nphysical and social skills of students.\r\nMany other leisure activities are vigorously\r\npursued in the United Arab Emirates, including those\r\norganized through the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts\r\nclubs, which are now among the most active\r\nmovements in Asia, particularly in the field of\r\nimproving the environment and implementing national\r\nprogrammes to promote public awareness of\r\nhumanitarian, social, health and development\r\nactivities.\r\nIn conclusion, we hope that the United Nations\r\nobservance of the International Year of Sport and\r\nPhysical Education in 2005 will promote the concept of\r\nsports for all. We also call for advancing and\r\nintensifying international efforts to promote and\r\nimplement initiatives for the advancement of human\r\ndevelopment and to integrate sports activities and their\r\nnoble values in the educational and development\r\nstrategies and programmes of countries to further\r\ninteraction and communication among different\r\ncultures and civilizations and to build peace. We also\r\nlook forward to reaching international consensus in\r\norder to elaborate an anti-doping convention to prevent\r\nthe abuse of drugs in all sports activities and to\r\ndevelop sports for youth in a healthy and sound\r\nenvironment that promotes discipline, leadership, self-\r\nconfidence and interactions among societies.\r\nMr. Mongkolnavin (Thailand): My delegation\r\nhas the pleasure of addressing this Assembly on agenda\r\nitem 35, “Culture of peace” and agenda item 47, “Sport\r\nfor peace and development: International Year of Sport\r\nand Physical Education”.\r\nOn agenda item 35, my delegation attaches\r\nparamount importance to the culture of peace. The\r\nThai Foreign Minister stressed in his statement,\r\ndelivered during the general debate, that cultivation of\r\na culture of peace is necessary for today’s world. We\r\nneed to create peace through our diversity and, indeed,\r\nthrough a holistic approach.\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\nIn that regard, my delegation welcomes the report\r\nof the Director-General of the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO), entitled “International Decade for a\r\nCulture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of\r\nthe World (2001-2010)” (A/59/223), which provides a\r\ncomprehensive review of the work carried\r\nout by various international organizations and\r\nrecommendations with regard to the Programme of\r\nAction on a Culture of Peace that will help us realize a\r\nculture of peace in eight areas, namely: education;\r\nsustainable economic development and social\r\ndevelopment; respect for all human rights; equality\r\nbetween women and men; democratic participation;\r\nunderstanding, tolerance and solidarity; participatory\r\ncommunication and the free flow of information and\r\nknowledge; and international peace and security.\r\nMy delegation shares the viewpoint expressed in\r\nparagraph 102 of the report that “it is of paramount\r\nimportance that Member States develop and sustain\r\naction-oriented strategies and activities in support of\r\nculture of peace and non-violence”, especially for\r\nwomen and children, society’s most vulnerable\r\nmembers.\r\nTurning to agenda item 47, my delegation\r\nstrongly supports the use of sport as a means to\r\ncultivate peace, foster understanding and promote\r\ndevelopment. The current Government views the\r\npromotion of sports and health care — as well as using\r\nsport as a means to promote child development and to\r\nfight against drug addiction — as national policies.\r\nTherefore, my delegation supports the proclamation of\r\n2005 as the International Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation, which advocates for the concept of “sport\r\nfor all”, the integration of physical education into the\r\neducational curriculum and encourages the use of sport\r\nas a platform for intercultural, post-conflict, peace-\r\nbuilding dialogue and the dissemination of information\r\nabout the value of sport and physical education for\r\ndevelopment and peace. In that connection, my\r\ndelegation also welcomes the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the topic, contained in document A/59/268.\r\nIndeed, not only is sport important to us because\r\nit helps us to live a healthier lifestyle, it also promotes\r\nsocial interaction, relationships and business\r\npartnerships and cultivates a culture of peace. In that\r\nregard, my delegation wishes to congratulate Greece\r\nfor the successful organization of the Olympic Games\r\nin Athens.\r\nFor our part, my delegation was proud to see Thai\r\nathletes participate in the fullest spirit of sportsmanship\r\nand with determined dedication in the Olympic Games\r\nin Athens. We are also proud of the achievements of\r\nour athletes, medal winners or otherwise. Those\r\nathletes have indeed succeeded in generating greater\r\nawareness of the importance of the true value of sport\r\namong the Thai public, as well as acting as an impetus\r\nfor the Government to reinforce its strategy to raise the\r\nstandard of sport and promote development of athletic\r\ntalent in Thailand.\r\nMy delegation is of the view that every person,\r\nwhether young or old, can benefit from sport. Children,\r\nin particular, can benefit tremendously from sport, as it\r\nhelps them in their overall developmental process,\r\npromotes their self-expression and helps them to build\r\nsocial connections, as well as keeping them away from\r\nillegal activities, such as drugs and crime. This\r\nphilosophy is in line with the Thai saying that sport is a\r\nmagic medicine or, in a Western understanding, sport is\r\na panacea.\r\nFrom the social perspective, my delegation is\r\npleased to see the growing number of women and\r\ndisabled persons involved in sport. Some of them have\r\nbecome Olympic gold medallists. Sport can also help\r\npeople living with HIV/AIDS to overcome stigma and\r\ndiscrimination. Through participation in sport, these\r\npeople can embark on the path of regaining their self-\r\nconfidence and reintegrating once again into society.\r\nDomestically, the Thai Government fully\r\nappreciates the value of sport. This year, many\r\ninitiatives were introduced in order to promote\r\nawareness and better understanding of the value of\r\nsport. For example, the Thai Government organized a\r\ncountrywide outdoor aerobics event, with the Prime\r\nMinister playing an instrumental role. This reflects the\r\nimportance that the Thai people give to sport and the\r\nbenefits it brings. It is also a manifestation of solidarity\r\nand harmony that has brought Thai people from\r\ndifferent ages, backgrounds and religions together in a\r\npeaceful manner. Last month, a workshop chaired by\r\nthe Prime Minister was organized in order to discuss\r\nthe “roadmap for sport” for Thailand, an initiative that\r\nis believed to enhance the value of sport and raise the\r\nstandard of athletic skills and sportsmanship of Thai\r\npeople, especially children.\r\nIn this time of increasing conflicts, sport can be\r\ninstrumental in developing a platform for intercultural,\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\npost-conflict and peace-building dialogue. In addition,\r\nsport can play a crucial role in bringing people together\r\nafter conflict has ended, promoting trust and friendship\r\nand helping in the reconstruction process of a\r\ncommunity. The United Nations has an important role\r\nto play in promoting sport in this regard. To this end,\r\nmy delegation supports the creation of a code of good\r\npractice to enhance the cooperation between Member\r\nStates and international sports bodies, especially the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) which deserves particular\r\ncommendation for its continued effort in promoting\r\nsport as a tool for development and peace. My\r\ndelegation looks forward to the fourth International\r\nConference of Ministers and Senior Officials\r\nresponsible for Physical Education and Sport, to be\r\norganized by UNESCO in December this year, to\r\ndiscuss the development-related themes of sport\r\npertaining to the International Year for Sport and\r\nPhysical Education in 2005.\r\nTo conclude, my delegation wishes to pledge our\r\ncontinued support to promoting sport for all and also\r\nwishes to urge the United Nations system and its\r\npartners to further their efforts in promoting sport for\r\neducation, health, development and peace through\r\nparticipation through all sectors of the society.\r\nMs. Tariq Aziz (Pakistan): A profound\r\ntransformation is under way in international relations.\r\nThe dangerous balances of the cold war have been\r\nreplaced by the complex and equally dangerous\r\nrealities of our world today. It is a world marked by\r\nintensifying globalization — of economics, production,\r\ntrade and information, on one side, and terrorist\r\nviolence, poverty and disease, on the other. The\r\ngrowing asymmetries in power among States,\r\ndiscrimination in the dispensation of international\r\njustice, repression of people’s legitimate aspirations\r\nand growing socio-economic disparities have\r\nprecipitated new threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity. Acknowledging that wars begin in the minds\r\nof people and that it is in the minds of people that the\r\ndefence of peace must be constructed, the General\r\nAssembly adopted the Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction on a Culture of Peace on 13 September 1999.\r\nThe Declaration defines this culture of peace as a\r\nset of values, attitudes and behaviours based on the\r\nfollowing: respect for life; ending violence and\r\npromoting the idea and practice of non-violence\r\nthrough education, dialogue and cooperation; full\r\nrespect for the principles of sovereignty, territorial\r\nintegrity and political independence of States and non-\r\nintervention in matters that are essentially within the\r\ndomestic jurisdiction of any State, in accordance with\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and international\r\nlaw; full respect for and promotion of all human rights\r\nand fundamental freedoms; commitment to the\r\npeaceful settlement of conflicts; and respect for and\r\npromotion of the rights of everyone to freedom of\r\nexpression, opinion and information.\r\nArticle 3 of the Declaration proclaims that the\r\nfuller development of a culture of peace is integrally\r\nlinked to the right of all people to self-determination.\r\nAll people, including those living under colonial or\r\nother forms of alien domination or foreign occupation,\r\nare entitled to exercise their inherent right to self-\r\ndetermination. The Declaration further calls for\r\nelimination of all forms of racism, racial\r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance\r\namong all civilizations, peoples and cultures, including\r\ntowards ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities.\r\nThus, nations and peoples have separate political\r\nexistences, but, as the General Assembly has\r\nrecognized, understanding, tolerance and solidarity\r\namong all civilizations, peoples and cultures are\r\nessential to promoting a culture of peace. That is the\r\nparadigm that must be constructed for the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nIn the post-11 September scenario,\r\nmisunderstandings and suspicions between different\r\nfaiths and cultures have been accentuated. Some\r\nquarters have utilized this to advance their self-serving\r\nthesis of an inevitable clash of civilizations. Some\r\nStates that are occupying and oppressing other people\r\nhave exploited it to justify the repression of people of\r\nother faiths and cultures. Extremists commonly vilify\r\nother religions and cultures, spreading prejudice and\r\nhate. Our own religion, Islam, has been so vilified and\r\ndefamed. Such dangerous trends are deliberately\r\nfuelled by those who believe they will gain from a\r\nclash of religions and cultures. These trends of hate\r\nand intolerance need to be firmly addressed and\r\neffectively reversed by the international community.\r\nCooperation — and not the clash of civilizations —\r\nmust be the paradigm for our collective endeavours.\r\nPromotion of understanding, harmony and cooperation\r\namong religions and cultures is the indispensable\r\navenue through which we can lift the veil of ignorance,\r\nmisconception and prejudice that have become so\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\ntragically pervasive in recent times. We agree with the\r\nrecommendations of the report transmitted by the\r\nSecretary-General on a culture of peace that a\r\nparticularly important dimension of the dialogue\r\namong civilizations is inter-religious dialogue, which\r\nimplies dialogue both among religions and within a\r\nsingle religion. Indeed, the key issue raised by the\r\ndialogue among civilizations is the place of ethics in\r\nthe relationship between societies, peoples and\r\nindividuals. Inter-religious dialogue could be an\r\nimportant factor in highlighting the dynamic interplay\r\nbetween spiritual traditions and their specific cultures\r\nby focusing on their mutual contributions and\r\nexchanges.\r\nIt is therefore of vital importance that the\r\ninternational community encourage inter-religious\r\norganizations and movements working for peace to\r\nengage in a more effective and active dialogue and\r\ncooperation with a view to promoting harmony and\r\ncoexistence. Ethnicity, religion, culture, language or\r\nrace must not be allowed to become a source of\r\ndivisiveness.\r\nWe must be the catalysts of change and not the\r\nprophets of doom. We must affirm the indivisibility of\r\nthe human race. We must reassert our common\r\nhumanity and common universal values.\r\nThe President of Pakistan, General Pervez\r\nMusharraf, has outlined a concrete strategy of\r\nenlightened moderation which seeks to promote socio-\r\neconomic emancipation, human resource development,\r\nand the just and peaceful resolution of disputes, with a\r\nview to advancing cooperation and preventing\r\nconfrontation between cultures and civilizations —\r\nespecially between Islam and the West.\r\nEnlightened moderation is a vital strategic option\r\nto prevent the current international system from\r\ndissolving into interminable conflict and strife.\r\nPromoting the concept of enlightened moderation\r\nwould be a fitting response to the enormous global\r\nchallenges which the world confronts today.\r\nThe Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace\r\nencourages Member States to take action for the\r\npromotion of a culture of peace at the national and\r\ninternational levels. Accordingly, under this item,\r\nduring the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly\r\nPakistan initiated a draft resolution for the promotion\r\nof religious and cultural understanding, harmony and\r\ncooperation, which was adopted by consensus by the\r\nGeneral Assembly in February 2004. This year, too, we\r\nhave submitted a draft resolution under this agenda\r\nitem highlighting the same principles to enhance\r\nhuman well-being, freedom and progress everywhere\r\nby uniting efforts to secure universal peace. It is our\r\nhope that the General Assembly will again adopt by\r\nconsensus Pakistan’s draft resolution on the promotion\r\nof religious and cultural understanding, harmony and\r\ncooperation. That would be a categorical, authoritative\r\nand global rejection of the messages of intolerance,\r\nhate and discrimination emanating from hate-mongers.\r\nMr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan): By proclaiming\r\nthe International Decade for a Culture of Peace and\r\nNon-violence for the Children of the World, the United\r\nNations has recognized the diverse civilizational\r\nachievements of humankind, crystallizing cultural\r\npluralism and creative human diversity.\r\nThe report of the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on\r\nagenda item 35 provides an overall strategy on the part\r\nof the international community regarding the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action on a\r\nCulture of Peace. It also reflects the broad range of\r\nactivities carried out by the United Nations system,\r\ninternational institutions and civil society, which\r\ntogether have made an important contribution to the\r\nobjectives of the International Decade for a Culture of\r\nPeace and Non-violence for the Children of the World.\r\nWe consider it important for UNESCO, as the\r\nlead United Nations agency for the Decade, to achieve\r\nan effective coordination of the efforts of all the key\r\nactors and stakeholders to ensure the consistent\r\nimplementation of the Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction.\r\nAnother UNESCO report on the promotion of\r\nreligious and cultural understanding, harmony and\r\ncooperation underscores the fact that a particularly\r\nimportant dimension of the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations is inter-religious dialogue, which is a key\r\nfactor in highlighting the dynamic interplay between\r\nspiritual traditions and their specific cultures.\r\nResolution 58/128 underlines the importance of\r\npromoting understanding and tolerance among peoples\r\nin all their diversity in the areas of religion, belief,\r\nculture and language. We share the view that, under\r\ncurrent conditions, it is of fundamental importance to\r\nrenew our common commitment to a true culture of\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\npeace by strengthening our efforts to develop dialogue\r\nand mutual understanding.\r\nKazakhstan is a peace-loving and tolerant\r\ncountry. Our experience has effectively demonstrated\r\nthat different ethnic groups, religions and confessions\r\ncan coexist and flourish in favourable conditions of\r\npeace and internal stability. We believe that world\r\nreligions and confessions could contribute\r\ntremendously to the promotion of a culture of peace.\r\nIt is precisely for that reason that, at the initiative\r\nof the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, a\r\nCongress of Leaders of World and Traditional\r\nReligions was convened in our country in September\r\n2003 which enjoyed wide support on the part of the\r\ninternational community. The forum was attended by\r\nhierarchs of the main world religions and confessions,\r\nwho gathered together in Kazakhstan to discuss the\r\nmost important issues of concern to humankind. The\r\nmeeting made a valuable contribution to the promotion\r\nof a culture of peace and dialogue among civilizations.\r\nThe leaders and representatives of world\r\nreligions, who participated actively in the work of the\r\nforum, stated loud and clear that every nation and\r\nevery religion chooses its own road to the Creator and\r\nthat they all were against terrorism, fanaticism and\r\nreligious intolerance. They agreed that it was time to\r\naddress pressing political and spiritual problems\r\nthrough a constructive inter-religious dialogue and\r\ndecided to convene such congresses regularly.\r\nKazakhstan had the privilege of chairing the\r\nforum and of leading the process of its\r\ninstitutionalization. In that regard, a secretariat of the\r\nCongress of Leaders of World and Traditional\r\nReligions was established in Kazakhstan. Currently, the\r\nsecretariat is actively working out a charter of the\r\nCongress of Leaders of World and Traditional\r\nReligions, which is to be submitted for discussion at\r\nthe next meeting of the secretariat of the Congress in\r\nMay 2005.\r\nThe secretariat has endorsed in principle the\r\nconcept of the second Congress of Leaders of World\r\nand Traditional Religions, which is tentatively\r\nscheduled to be held in Astana, the capital of\r\nKazakhstan, from 12 to 14 September 2006.\r\nWe believe that this initiative should be fully\r\nsupported by the United Nations and promoted by its\r\nMember States and by regional and non-governmental\r\norganizations. Kazakhstan is open to cooperation with\r\nall interested parties in the follow-up of the outcomes\r\nof the first Congress of Leaders of World and\r\nTraditional Religions.\r\nResolution 58/5 recognizes the important role of\r\nsport in the implementation of internationally agreed\r\ndevelopment goals. The report entitled “Sport for\r\npeace and development: International Year of Sport\r\nand Physical Education” confirms that sport offers a\r\nnatural partnership for the United Nations and is a\r\npowerful instrument through which the Organization\r\ncan work towards achieving its important goals.\r\nWe believe that the proclamation of the year 2005\r\nas the International Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation will broaden the general perception of sport\r\nand encourage the further development of intercultural,\r\npost-conflict, peace-building dialogue. We believe also\r\nthat the International Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation provides an opportunity to promote the\r\nvalue of sport, and it is imperative that initiatives\r\nwithin the framework of the International Year have\r\nlong-term effects.\r\nWe reaffirm that sport and physical education\r\nplay an important role in the promotion of peace and\r\ndevelopment and friendly relations among nations.\r\nThey represent effective measures to combat crime as\r\nwell as drug and tobacco addiction. We also concur\r\nwith the view that the practice of sport is vital to the\r\nholistic development of young people, fostering their\r\nphysical and emotional health.\r\nThe development of sport is a priority area of the\r\nnational policy of Kazakhstan. The country fully\r\nsupports the ideals of humanism and friendship\r\nbetween nations. The Republic has set up a paralympic\r\ncommittee and established various sports federations\r\nand is strengthening its international ties in the area of\r\nsport.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to join other speakers in\r\nstressing that today, more than ever, we need to\r\npromote the value of peace. Kazakhstan is looking\r\nforward to extending continued support for the\r\ncoordinated efforts to promote sustainable peace and\r\nsecurity in the world.\r\nMs. Gallardo (El Salvador) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nMy delegation welcomes this opportunity to speak on\r\nagenda item 35, “Culture of peace”.\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\nThe Government of El Salvador has attached\r\nparticular importance to this item since we signed the\r\n1992 Peace Accords at Chapultepec, Mexico.\r\nSalvadorans have embarked on a process of learning\r\nhow to translate those agreements into true peace. This\r\ninternal process has paved the way for us to strengthen\r\nthe rule of law and respect for human rights. We have\r\nlearned that peace-building, as one of the essential\r\nelements of the culture of peace, is possible only if\r\nthere is resolve on the part of those who have laid\r\ndown their weapons to enter into a debate and to\r\nexchange ideas with regard to the differences that are\r\ninherent in every society.\r\nEl Salvador would like to take this opportunity to\r\nreaffirm its commitment to working together with the\r\nUnited Nations family to explore, to innovate and to\r\nimplement initiatives and strategies aimed at fostering\r\nthe peaceful resolution of conflicts. Unfortunately, the\r\ncurrent state of affairs shows that new threats to peace\r\nand collective security have arisen that transcend\r\nborders. The Government’s efforts, at both the national\r\nand international levels, are directed towards creating\r\nmechanisms to alleviate the worsening social,\r\neconomic and environmental conditions.\r\nWe are fully convinced that preventing\r\nfrustration, intolerance and violence is at the heart of\r\nthe very notion of a culture of peace. The\r\nmanifestations of international terrorism, which are\r\nattempting to destabilize the effectiveness of the\r\nmultilateral system and imperil the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, compel us to redouble\r\nour efforts to engage in a dialogue among cultures and\r\nreligions.\r\nThe Declaration and Programme of Action on a\r\nCulture of Peace provides a comprehensive frame of\r\nreference within which Governments, international\r\norganizations and civil society can direct their\r\nactivities towards specific actions aimed at the\r\nestablishment of a culture of peace in the new\r\nmillennium. In this regard, we endorse sports as a tool\r\nthat facilitates peaceful coexistence. In that context, El\r\nSalvador has joined in sponsoring the draft resolution\r\nintroduced by Tunisia.\r\nAs has been acknowledged on many occasions,\r\npeace is not merely the absence of conflict. It is an\r\nevolving, participatory and dynamic process within\r\nsociety that requires us to be creative, to learn to be\r\ntolerant and to engage in dialogue. International\r\ncooperation thus provides a mechanism for\r\nrapprochement and respect among human beings in the\r\nsearch for solutions to conflicts. But that also involves\r\na degree of responsibility among various cultures and\r\nlevels of development.\r\nSalvadorans bear faithful testimony to the fact\r\nthat peace is possible only when the path of national\r\nreconciliation is chosen, making room for dialogue to\r\nresolve internal disputes, with political will leading to\r\nthe creation of joint democratic institutional\r\nmechanisms, and respect for authority and the rule of\r\nlaw providing for a new form of coexistence. We know\r\nthat there can be no peace without development. Thus\r\nthe Government of El Salvador is sparing no effort to\r\nachieve a secure peace in which security and\r\ndevelopment become a way of life for the majority of\r\nthe people.\r\nIn his report contained in document A/59/223, the\r\nSecretary-General sets out a number of important\r\nelements for our consideration that we must keep in\r\nmind as we embark on the task of evaluating progress\r\nmade in the implementation of the commitments\r\nundertaken in the context of the International Decade\r\nfor a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the\r\nChildren of the World.\r\nMember States now have an opportunity to share\r\nuseful experiences in terms of the implementation of\r\nthese commitments at the national level. The\r\ndissemination of values that foster tolerance, peace and\r\nlearning, through formal and informal education, and\r\nof new attitudes and behaviours that instil a culture of\r\npeace should be carried out by means of innovative,\r\ncross-cutting programmes in public policy —\r\notherwise, the peace to which we are committed will\r\nnot be sustained.\r\nThe Government of El Salvador agrees with all\r\nthose who have recognized that the right to peace is a\r\nfundamental human right. It is a third-generation right\r\nthat the General Assembly recognized in resolution\r\n39/11 of 12 November 1984 and that the members of\r\nthe Organization of American States reaffirmed in the\r\nCaracas Declaration, adopted on the occasion of the\r\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nadoption of its charter.\r\nWe reaffirm our commitment to the education for\r\npeace programme, an initiative launched by UNESCO.\r\nWe are convinced that the teaching of values,\r\nbehaviours and attitudes necessarily requires a constant\r\n29\r\nA/59/PV.41\r\nlearning process in children and adults. Respect for\r\nhuman rights must be learned and transmitted if we are\r\nto build a culture of peace. In El Salvador in recent\r\nyears we have strengthened our approach through\r\ninnovative programmes to teach the idea of peace at all\r\nlevels, including through education for boys and girls\r\nfrom a very early age.\r\nAs the constitution of UNESCO states, since wars\r\nbegin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men\r\nthat the defences of peace must be constructed.\r\nSalvadorans have learned that peace means finding a\r\nway of living together with others in friendship,\r\nturning to reason and not to violence when our\r\ndifferences set us apart.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like the issue of the\r\nculture of peace to be included in the framework of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals; we should all work\r\ntogether to achieve our common objectives.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.\r\n"
