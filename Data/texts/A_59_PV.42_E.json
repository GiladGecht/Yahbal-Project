That is because,\r\nin our ever-changing world, where peace is threatened\r\nand where ethical issues are of growing importance,\r\nthe culture of peace offers present and future\r\ngenerations values that can help them to shape their\r\ndestiny and to participate actively in building a fairer,\r\nfreer and more prosperous society at the family,\r\nnational, regional and global levels as they await the\r\nadvent of a more peaceful world.\r\nI should like, on behalf of the Togolese\r\ndelegation, to congratulate the Secretary-General and,\r\nthrough him, the Director-General of the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) for the reports that they have\r\nsubmitted to us, which detail the action taken by the\r\nUnited Nations system and Member States since the\r\nproclamation of the decade 2001-2010 as the\r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nViolence for the Children of the World. In that respect,\r\nwe welcome the action and initiatives taken under the\r\nauspices of UNESCO since the proclamation of the\r\nDecade, and especially the role being played by the\r\nUniversity for Peace, the United Nations Development\r\nFund for Women, the International Labour\r\nOrganization and United Nations University.\r\nAt the initiative of the President of the Republic,\r\nMr. Gnassingbé Eyadema, Togo has striven for several\r\nyears to maintain a climate of peace and good\r\nunderstanding in Africa, and especially in the Western\r\nAfrican subregion. The many actions undertaken by the\r\nTogolese Head of State — such as the adoption of the\r\nAgreement on Non-Aggression and Defence in Western\r\nAfrica and his involvement in the settlement of several\r\ncrises, including that in Côte d’Ivoire — demonstrate\r\nTogo’s desire for peace to reign throughout the\r\ncontinent.\r\nAmong the actions undertaken at the international\r\nlevel that should be consolidated in the long term, we\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nwould briefly note certain examples that the Togolese\r\ndelegation believes to be essential.\r\nIn certain parts of the world, such as Africa, the\r\nachievements of nation States created in artificially\r\ndelineated geographical spaces must be resolutely\r\nconsolidated. It is well known that those circumstances\r\nhave weakened the sense of the peoples living in those\r\nspaces that they belong to the same national\r\ncommunity. That phenomenon has assumed a new\r\ndimension, in particular, since the democratization\r\nprocess in Africa — which has sought to take account\r\nof the specificities of each people — was unfortunately\r\nblown off course by pressures from beyond the\r\ncontinent.\r\nThe inevitable consequence of all this is that the\r\nmarch towards democratization has been accompanied\r\nin most African countries by socio-political turbulence\r\nthat has gravely unravelled the social fabric and\r\nundone post-independence efforts for national\r\ncohesion. Moreover, the current crises, tensions and\r\nconflicts in Africa — more often than not fratricidal —\r\nare also largely related to the accelerated march\r\ntowards democratization undertaken by most African\r\nStates.\r\nBeyond the consolidation of the nation State, we\r\nbelieve that the effective management of post-conflict\r\nperiods, especially in Africa, is another essential aspect\r\nof the promotion of a culture of peace. To that end, we\r\nmust above all develop and enhance the efforts made in\r\nthat regard by the United Nations system.\r\nIn that respect, we must promote the practice of\r\nensuring that future peace agreements are more closely\r\nassociated with the development of a culture of peace\r\nand that they include, first and foremost, national\r\nprogrammes on the culture of peace that will conduce\r\nto the implementation of sustainable development\r\nprojects. Moreover, as affirmed in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, social justice and the elimination of\r\npoverty are essential to the establishment and\r\nmaintenance of peace and security within and among\r\nnations. Similarly, as the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme confirms in its wise proposals, human-\r\ncentred development is both a prerequisite to peace and\r\na consequence of it.\r\nThus, it is important to ensure that this other\r\ndimension — the elimination of poverty — be the\r\nobject of special attention in the campaign to promote\r\nthe culture of peace. Peace is not merely the absence of\r\nwar; it is clear that it is also intimately linked to\r\neconomic development.\r\nDespite the efforts of African States to reform\r\ntheir economies and broaden their democratic space,\r\nthey continue to face economic and financial\r\ndifficulties that do not allow them to guarantee their\r\npeople the bare minimum for survival. In certain cases,\r\nsuch as that of Togo, those difficulties are even\r\nexacerbated by the imposition of unjust economic\r\nsanctions on account of the so-called democratic\r\ndeficit. Such coercive measures make the ideal of\r\npeace an even more distant prospect for their peoples.\r\nHence, any effort to abandon the culture of\r\nviolence — as the Programme of Action of the\r\nInternational Decade and the activities undertaken in\r\nthe framework of the dialogue of cultures and\r\ncivilizations so eloquently confirmed — is undermined\r\nfrom the start by the fact that the populations\r\nconcerned continue to live in total privation and are\r\ndenied their fundamental rights. Therefore, interaction\r\nbetween the culture of peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment remains the cornerstone of the enterprise\r\nto which the international community must henceforth\r\ndevote itself.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s reports stress not only\r\nthe actions already undertaken, but also the need to\r\npursue and strengthen them further in the future. We\r\nhope that States and the international community,\r\narmed with the necessary political will, will succeed in\r\ntranslating into reality the basic and legitimate\r\naspirations of peoples to a world of peace and justice,\r\nfree of misery and poverty.\r\nMrs. Chassoul (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAllow me at the outset to thank you, Sir, for your\r\nexcellent leadership of the work of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nOn 31 July 1997, the representatives of\r\nBangladesh, Côte d’Ivoire, El Salvador, the\r\nPhilippines, Guinea-Bissau, Honduras, Namibia,\r\nNicaragua, Panama, Senegal, Venezuela and Costa\r\nRica called for the inclusion of an additional item on\r\nthe agenda of the fifty-second session of the General\r\nAssembly. That item was “Culture of peace”.\r\nThe establishment of the United Nations system,\r\nbased on universally shared values and objectives, was\r\nin itself an important step forward in the shift from a\r\nculture of war and violence to one of peace and non-\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nviolence. The international instruments adopted under\r\nUnited Nations auspices and the declarations and plans\r\nof action that emerged from its world conferences have\r\nhelped to enshrine the culture of peace and reflect the\r\ndevelopment and consolidation of shared norms, values\r\nand goals.\r\nAbolishing war, which has become a worse\r\nscourge than ever before, must be pursued as the\r\nprincipal objective of humankind. That task requires\r\nnot only changes in war’s structures and institutional\r\nmanifestations, but also replacing the deep cultural\r\nroots of the culture of violence and war with the\r\nculture of peace.\r\nGlobal history attests to the dominance of the\r\nculture of war. For centuries, men have used weapons\r\nto resolve conflicts with their neighbours, be they\r\ninternal or with other States. Regrettably, violence\r\nreigns in human relations and the events of recent years\r\nbear out that fact. We have learned here that the main\r\nareas for action to promote and strengthen the culture\r\nof peace are education, sustainable economic and\r\nsocial development, human rights, gender equality,\r\ndemocratic participation and the promotion of\r\nunderstanding, tolerance and solidarity.\r\nAccordingly, the features of the culture of peace\r\nare non-violence and respect for human rights; respect\r\nand solidarity among all peoples; dialogue among\r\ncultures; linking peace with democratic participation\r\nand sustainable human development; the free\r\ndissemination of information and knowledge;\r\ncontaining and preventing conflicts; peace-building in\r\npost-conflict situations; and equality between men and\r\nwomen. All of those must be backed up by projects in\r\nwhich people actively participate in radically\r\ntransforming their own values, attitudes and conduct.\r\nWhile matters relating to human rights are an\r\nimportant component of the culture of peace, the\r\nconcept of that culture also encompasses other issues\r\nof great significance. All States must strengthen the\r\nculture of peace. We must cooperate with international\r\norganizations, civil society, community leaders,\r\nparents, teachers at all levels of education, journalists\r\nand, in brief, everyone living on this Earth of ours.\r\nThe opportunity or ability to speak on the culture\r\nof peace reflects the aspiration to a world free from\r\nwar and genuine awareness of the dangers we face.\r\nYear after year, the General Assembly urges\r\nMember States to give impetus to their activities to\r\npromote a culture of peace and non-violence, extending\r\nthem by its fifty-eighth session to national, regional\r\nand international plans. They have also been urged to\r\nwork to promote peace and non-violence at all levels,\r\nrecognizing that respect for and acceptance of religious\r\nand cultural diversity, tolerance, dialogue and\r\ncooperation in an atmosphere of trust and\r\nunderstanding can help in fighting discrimination,\r\nintolerance and hatred and thereby strengthen world\r\npeace, social justice and peaceful coexistence among\r\npeoples.\r\nIn conclusion, Costa Rica is a peace-loving\r\ncountry. Over 50 years ago, my country completely and\r\nunilaterally renounced the use of force and entrusted its\r\nsecurity to international law and multilateral machinery\r\nfor the peaceful settlement of disputes. Peace means\r\nharmony among the various sectors of society,\r\nbalanced relationships among people and peoples, and\r\nthe repudiation of violence and hatred in human\r\nrelations.\r\nMr. Limon (Suriname): The delegation of\r\nSuriname would like to speak on item 47, entitled\r\n“Sport for peace and development: International Year\r\nof Sport and Physical Education”.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of Barbados on behalf of\r\nthe States members of the Caribbean Community.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his report on\r\nthe item, contained in document A/59/268. The report\r\nreiterates the important contribution that sport and\r\nphysical education can make to achieving peace and\r\ndevelopment, in particular human development. The\r\nGovernment of Suriname agrees with that statement.\r\nWe continue to support the objectives of the United\r\nNations system for the International Year of Sport and\r\nphysical Education in 2005.\r\nSuriname is of the view that sport, peace and\r\ndevelopment need to be seen in a broader perspective.\r\nTheir mutually reinforcing and supporting ability is\r\nbeing recognized by the international community.\r\nSport has always been an important factor in bringing\r\npeople together in peace, and physical education has\r\nalways been an important means in the bringing-up of\r\nchildren in Surinamese communities and to increase\r\ntolerance and understanding among the different\r\ncultures and ethnic groups in Surinamese society.\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nWe support the goal of creating interest in human\r\ndevelopment issues in the world of sport and the\r\nbroadening of the perception of sport to encompass\r\n“sport for all”. On the basis of those principles, the\r\nGovernment of Suriname will, in the year 2005,\r\nincrease its activities in the area of youth sport and\r\nmass sport activities. Recreational and leisure activities\r\nwill be available for participation by the public,\r\noffering everyone an opportunity to increase good\r\nhealth.\r\nActions are now being taken to bring sport and\r\nrecreation closer to the community, especially the so-\r\ncalled working class neighbourhoods, the districts and\r\nthe interior of Suriname. Those activities are aimed at\r\nthe increased participation of youth, women and people\r\nwith disabilities. We believe that they will assist in the\r\nfurtherance of tolerance among the different cultures in\r\nSurinamese society and that Surinamese youth will be\r\ngiven additional opportunity to participate in physical\r\nactivities and, in so doing, to display their talents for\r\ncertain sports.\r\nIt is important to mention that, whenever we turn\r\nto sport, physical education and training, the\r\noverarching objective of the Surinamese Government\r\nis to prevent anti-social behaviour and to improve the\r\nquality of life. In harmony with its “sport for all”\r\nactivities, the Government of Suriname will continue\r\nto pursue its “competition-tailored” sport agenda.\r\nMy delegation is of the view that the United\r\nNations and the United Nations system are best suited\r\nto assist in defining and advancing the global sport\r\nagenda and to make the year 2005 a significant year for\r\nsport and physical education. We acknowledge the\r\nactivities already undertaken by the United Nations\r\nsystem, in particular the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization, the Special\r\nAdviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for\r\nDevelopment and Peace, and the United Nations Fund\r\nfor International Partnerships.\r\nThe elaboration of an anti-doping convention in\r\nall sport activities is a relevant exercise that will result\r\nin a legal document that should contribute to enhancing\r\nfair competition and the meaning of competition sport.\r\nWe expect the International Year of Sport and\r\nPhysical Education — the year 2005 — to make a\r\ndifference in our perception and utilization of sport. As\r\nstated by the Secretary-General in his report,\r\n“The International Year of Sport and Physical\r\nEducation in 2005 is intended to provide an\r\nopportunity to promote the value of sport as a\r\nserious partner for the achievement of\r\ndevelopment and peace goals.” (A/59/268, para.\r\n29)\r\nEnhancing the significance of sport in order to\r\nenable it to make a meaningful contribution to\r\ninternational peace and development requires a global\r\npartnership with the participation of all, including the\r\nsport-related private sector, the international sport\r\nfederations, the non-governmental organizations and\r\ngrass-roots organizations. The United Nations system\r\nis deemed capable of uniting them all.\r\nMr. Gillerman (Israel): At the outset, let me\r\nthank you once again, Sir, for your able stewardship\r\nand assure you of Israel’s utmost cooperation. In\r\naddition, let me take this opportunity to thank the\r\nSecretary-General and his staff for the work they have\r\ndone in producing the useful and informative report\r\nbefore us.\r\nSports are indeed very powerful. Not only gauges\r\nof the limits of human potential, they can also be used\r\nto foster international friendship and harmony and to\r\nbridge the global seams of friction. They are, in fact,\r\nan international forum of their own. And now, as we\r\napproach the beginning of the International Year of\r\nSport and Physical Education in 2005, we should be\r\nhopeful that the positive elements of sport will be the\r\nonly ones that manifest themselves.\r\nAnyone who remembers the “ping-pong\r\ndiplomacy” of the early 1970s cannot help but believe\r\nin the potential of sport to help foster openness and\r\ninternational cooperation. “The ping heard around the\r\nworld,” as Time magazine called it then, was a sign of\r\nsport’s ability to break though seemingly unbreachable\r\nbarriers. Pursuant to resolution 58/5, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has urged Governments to give serious\r\nconsideration to how sport could be more\r\nsystematically included in plans to improve people’s\r\nlives, especially those of children living in poverty or\r\nwith disease or conflict.\r\nOur troubled region has seen small glimmers of\r\npromise in that regard, and we are always hopeful that\r\nthey are signs of the chances of a more peaceful era.\r\nFor example, last year’s Japanese-Israeli-Palestinian\r\nChildren’s Friendship Soccer Match, held in Tokyo,\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nhosted 11 Palestinian children and 11 Israeli children in\r\na symbolic week of friendly, athletic activity.\r\nI would also note this year’s success of the Bnei\r\nSakhnin football team, the first Israeli-Arab football\r\nteam to win the Israeli Cup and, as a result, to\r\nrepresent Israel in the Union of European Football\r\nAssociations Cup. As the Israel Football Association\r\nChairman has said,\r\n“The coexistence shown here today should be an\r\nexample to the rest of the world. A team which\r\nconsists of Jews, Christians, Muslims and\r\nforeigners representing an Arab town could act as\r\nabridge for peace.”\r\nAnd as journalist Salem Joubran has said,\r\n“If Jews and Arabs can play together and win a\r\ncup, they can also do business together and\r\nsimply live together.”\r\nUnfortunately, sport can sometimes be abused\r\nand made to serve as a sword as much as a shield.\r\nRegrettably, some would use the opportunities they\r\npresent to work in diametric opposition to the goals we\r\nhold dear. For example, the Palestinian Authority\r\ncontinues to use sporting events to present terrorists as\r\nrole models for youth. This past year, a youth sport\r\ngathering was named after Marwan Zalum, who was\r\nresponsible for killing at least seven people, including\r\nan infant, and injuring dozens more in Jerusalem. The\r\nevent was held under the authority of Yasser Arafat and\r\nhis Ministry of Youth and Sport. Within the framework\r\nof a sporting event for young people, the Chairman of\r\nthe corrupt Palestinian Authority’s Legislative Council\r\npraised the terrorist and a film was shown about his\r\nlife.\r\nBut the invidious subversion of sport reaches far\r\nbeyond our region. For years, racism and anti-\r\nSemitism at European football games have been an\r\nincreasingly disturbing phenomenon. That problem\r\ndoes not seem to have abated. On the contrary, in many\r\nfootball stadiums in Europe, neo-Nazi blocs use games\r\nto build contacts and recruit new members. Racist and\r\nanti-Semitic songs are employed and code words and\r\nsigns are used to allude to xenophobic platforms. That\r\nis particularly disturbing in the context of the recent\r\nrise in anti-Semitism in Europe, as it serves as both a\r\nbarometer and an aggravating factor of that despicable\r\ntrend.\r\nIt is in that context that Israel commends the\r\nwork of organizations that are working to combat those\r\nnefarious activities. Particular praise should go to\r\nFootball Against Racism in Europe (FARE), which\r\nputs a tremendous amount of effort into building grass-\r\nroots efforts against racism in football. This week,\r\nFARE is engaging in its fifth annual Action Week, and\r\nIsrael wishes it the heartiest success in its very\r\nworthwhile endeavours.\r\nPerhaps the most important example of the\r\ncapability of sport to reflect the world it comes from,\r\nboth positively and negatively, is the Olympic Games.\r\nAs the report states, “sport is about participation,\r\ninclusion and citizenship. It brings individuals and\r\ncommunities together, highlighting commonalties and\r\nbridging cultural and ethnic divides.” (A/59/268,\r\npara. 7) The Olympic Games is the supreme\r\nexpression of that, and it is in that context that my\r\ndelegation would like to congratulate Greece on a\r\ntremendously successful and peaceful twenty-eighth\r\nOlympiad.\r\nIsrael is proud of its athletes’ performance at the\r\nOlympics and of the feeling of international\r\nbrotherhood manifested at this year’s Games. Its only\r\nregret was the dismaying inability of certain countries,\r\nsuch as Iran, to put aside the irrational politics of\r\nhatred and to allow all athletes to compete in the spirit\r\nof international harmony and hope for which the\r\nGames were intended, instead of forcing them to obey\r\nimmoral political agendas.\r\nNo matter how successful the holding of an\r\nOlympiad may be, it is always a time of lingering\r\nsadness for Israel. For the Israeli people, the very idea\r\nof the Olympics cleaves to the memory of the 1972\r\nGames in Munich, when gunmen from the terrorist\r\ngroup Black September broke into the Olympic village,\r\ndisguised as athletes, and killed 11 Israeli athletes,\r\ncoaches and referees, violating the sanctity of the\r\nvillage and of the Olympic Truce. That heinous act of\r\nterror was the very antithesis of the Olympic ideal.\r\nInstead of avoiding politics and conflict, the terrorists\r\nused the games as yet another venue for murder and\r\nhatred. It was one of the most atrocious subjugations of\r\nsport to a set of morally bankrupt political desires\r\nwithin memory.\r\nWe cannot allow that tragedy, which mars the\r\nannals of the Games, to be forgotten. Thus, it is very\r\ndisappointing that the International Olympic\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nCommittee has not yet found an appropriate manner to\r\nofficially observe the memory of the fallen Israeli\r\nathletes. If it wants to demonstrate that the concept of\r\nthe Olympic Truce is not merely a wistful illusion,\r\nIsrael calls on it to do so without fail.\r\nAs the report says, “Sport can cut across barriers\r\nthat divide societies, making it a powerful tool to\r\nsupport conflict prevention and peacebuilding efforts,\r\nboth symbolically at the global level and practically\r\nwithin communities.” (ibid., para. 9) Israel strongly\r\nendorses that proposition and calls on all countries to\r\nuse the opportunities provided by sport to foster peace\r\nand development. Israel pledges to fully support that\r\nendeavour.\r\nMs. Pérez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): The San\r\nFrancisco Charter set the grounds of what should have\r\nbeen a new system of international relations that would\r\navoid the terrible experiences of the two world wars of\r\nthe twentieth century. The fundamental goal contained\r\nin its first paragraph is “to save succeeding generations\r\nfrom the scourge of war” and to achieve the creation of\r\nan equitable and democratic international order focused\r\non respect for the dignity of all human beings as\r\nequals.\r\nThe Organization we belong to was created to\r\nserve the purposes of international security and peace-\r\nkeeping based on the principles of sovereign equality\r\nfor all its Members, the peaceful settlement of\r\ninternational conflicts, the non-use or threat of use of\r\nforce, and non-intervention in States’ internal affairs.\r\nWe were also promised that all States would achieve\r\neconomic and social development.\r\nNonetheless, with the approach of the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, we are witnessing\r\nthe rise of a sad economic and social situation\r\nthreatening the human race. The foreign debt of the\r\npoor countries, accounting for $50 billion dollars in\r\n1964, currently amounts to $2.6 trillion. In the 21 years\r\nfrom 1982 to 2003, the poor world paid $5.4 trillion in\r\ndebt servicing, which means that the debt’s current\r\nprincipal has been paid more than two-fold to the rich\r\ncountries.\r\nOfficial development assistance, to which\r\ndeveloped countries committed 0.7 per cent of their\r\ngross national product 34 years ago, has only reached\r\n0.22 per cent, which is less than a third.\r\nMore than 800 million people are starving. About\r\n500 million children live in extreme poverty, more than\r\n120 million do not attend school, around 150 million in\r\nthe developing world suffer malnutrition, and 11\r\nmillion under the age of five die each year of\r\npreventable diseases. Every day, 30,000 people die in\r\ndeveloping countries because drugs, 90 per cent of\r\nwhich are under pharmaceutical transnational patents,\r\nare very expensive or unavailable. Approximately 3.1\r\nmillion people suffering from AIDS are under the age\r\nof 15, yet only 1 per cent of infected Africans have\r\naccess to retroviral medicines and some 6,000\r\nyoungsters between the ages of 15 and 24 are infected\r\nwith that terrible disease each day.\r\nFurthermore, the lives of million human beings\r\non the planet are also threatened by the aggressive\r\nplans of the only super-Power in a unipolar world,\r\nwhich has arrogated the right to launch pre-emptive\r\nattacks against 60 or more developing countries and\r\nwhose plans for domination are supported, among\r\nothers things, by military satellites spying on every\r\nsquare kilometre of Earth, as well as by vast amounts\r\nof armaments, particularly nuclear weapons.\r\nIt is regrettable that most developed countries\r\ndevote themselves to distorting conflict settlements,\r\ninvoking their so-called responsibilities to protect and\r\ntheir supposed right to undertake humanitarian\r\ninterventions, concepts that are contrary to the United\r\nNations Charter and to international law and only\r\naggravate the root causes of armed confrontations,\r\nwhich range the gamut from widespread poverty to the\r\ncontrol of natural resources considered strategic.\r\nToday more than ever, it is essential to foster an\r\nenvironment of international peace. It is indispensable\r\nto defend a culture of peace and non-violence that\r\npromotes dialogue among civilizations, the right of all\r\npeoples to self-determination, and solidarity as\r\nfundamental values wherewith to tackle global\r\nproblems so that the responsibility to solve them is\r\nshared, meeting the needs of those who most require it.\r\nIn that sense, Cuba reiterates its adherence to\r\nmultilateralism and multilaterally-agreed solutions,\r\npursuant to the United Nations Charter and\r\ninternational law, as the only acceptable means to\r\naddress international problems. Only in such a way can\r\nthere be peace and development for all.\r\nOur delegation supports the activities carried out\r\nwithin the framework of the International Decade for a\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nCulture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of\r\nthe World by the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization, as well as the\r\nglobal strategy for the implementation of its\r\nProgramme Of Action.\r\nFor Cuba, sport and the Olympic ideal\r\nundoubtedly strengthen friendship and fraternity\r\namong peoples — indispensable components of the\r\npromotion of peace, development and cooperation\r\namong nations. Our contribution to that effort is based\r\non a broad international cooperation programme\r\nimplemented without consideration of gain not only in\r\nthe field of sport, but also in the spheres of health care\r\nand education, by thousands of Cuban specialists and\r\ntechnicians who offer their services in solidarity with\r\ndozens of countries. They do so despite the strict\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\non our country by our powerful northern neighbours,\r\nwhose current leaders have strengthened its intensity\r\nthrough the implementation since 30 June of a new\r\nplan to destroy the Cuban nation.\r\nLet us plant ideas, and all the weapons created by\r\nthis civilization will become obsolete. Let us plant\r\nideas, and the irreparable destruction of our living\r\nnatural environment may be prevented. Let us share the\r\nhope that a better world is possible.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nthe Observer of the Holy See.\r\nArchbishop Migliore (Holy See): For many\r\ndecades now, the need to promote an effective culture\r\nof peace has been widely acknowledged and, since\r\n1967, the Popes, too, have played their part, sending a\r\nmessage on the first day of January every year to all\r\npeople of good will, each time proposing a fresh theme\r\nconcerning peace and how to achieve it. Those\r\nmessages have already started to build up a mosaic of\r\ntopics and experiences for the promotion of a culture of\r\npeace in the sense under discussion today.\r\nIt is very clear that the world needs peace now as\r\nmuch as ever. My delegation is pleased to seize this\r\noccasion to reiterate its confidence in the United\r\nNations as one of the key institutions at mankind’s\r\ndisposal for the spread of a culture of peace.\r\nAs the Secretary-General mentions in his recent\r\nreport on the work of the Organization, we need only\r\nconsider the increase in United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations during the past year. Similarly, this year has\r\nalso seen the creation of a Counter-Terrorism\r\nExecutive Directorate in the struggle to uphold and\r\nprotect human rights and the rule of law. With the\r\nnecessary cooperation from all its Members, the United\r\nNations can truly be an effective instrument of the\r\npolitical will of the world’s nations.\r\nIn spite of those successes and initiatives, such as\r\nthe goals of globalization within the International\r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for\r\nthe Children of the World — the usually more\r\ndominant culture appears sometimes to trigger cultural\r\nreactions against true peace and to create suspicions\r\nabout it. Similarly, globalization seems unable to\r\nprevent threats to peace because cultural revivalism\r\ntends to create walls that separate people from one\r\nanother. Cynicism emerges from misunderstandings\r\namong peoples that are the results of unnecessary\r\nbarriers. The concept of security itself has come to\r\ncreate a continuing tension between national,\r\ninternational and global security interests.\r\nTo address the problems of security at any cost,\r\nall labours toward authentic peace must be nurtured\r\nunceasingly, balancing threat-based with cooperative\r\nsecurity interests. The defence of peace, so often a\r\nfragile entity, must be reinforced. That can be achieved\r\nby cultivating in the minds of all people of good will\r\nthe imperative to become in some way agents of peace.\r\nMaking peace a reality is possible through the\r\neducation of consciences that an openness and respect\r\nfor others can produce.\r\nAt its fifty-eighth session, the General Assembly\r\nconsidered resolutions on the International Decade for\r\na Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children\r\nof the World, on the University of Peace, and on\r\nreligious and cultural understanding, harmony and\r\ncooperation. All three are vital elements of building\r\npeace in the world, but the last item warrants special\r\nattention today. We agreed in last year’s resolution that\r\n“acts of violence, intimidation and coercion motivated\r\nby religious intolerance… are on the increase in many\r\nparts of the world and threaten the enjoyment of human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms” (resolution 58/128,\r\neleventh preambular paragraph).\r\nNonetheless, we have to acknowledge that there\r\nis already a foundation to build upon in the area of\r\ninter-religious cooperation — for example, the various\r\nmeetings organized by the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization in Central Asia,\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nthe Mediterranean region, both North and West Africa\r\nand the Asia-Pacific region. Those discussions have\r\ncovered such areas as terrorism, conflict resolution,\r\nHIV/AIDS, and the role of religious leaders in easing\r\ntensions, in counteracting the hijacking of religious\r\nvalues for use as a pretext to justify violence, and in\r\nsupporting disarmament and non-proliferation.\r\nThe devastating effects of conflict usually last\r\ngenerations, making reconciliation and any semblance\r\nof normal life extremely difficult, if not impossible.\r\nAlthough there has been much focus on weapons of\r\nmass destruction, we cannot ignore the many other\r\nforms of weapons used in conflicts around the world.\r\nHere, in this discussion, the Holy See raises this point\r\nin order to call for a more energetic commitment to\r\nunderlining the deep linkages between the promotion\r\nof the culture of peace and the strengthening of the\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation process.\r\nWhile it is true that the other name of peace is\r\nauthentic development for all peoples, my delegation\r\nalso believes that an important engine of that peace is\r\npolitical will. Harnessing it will greatly assist this\r\nAssembly in moving forward from the imputed\r\nperception of being a mere forum for analysis or a\r\nresolution-making machine into a real locus for the\r\ncultivation of transparency and the building-up of\r\nconfidence. With political will, the untapped moral\r\nresources of nations can emerge to transform\r\ncivilizations so that, finally, they learn to treasure life\r\nand promote peace.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I wish to\r\ninform the General Assembly that, at the request of its\r\nsponsors, the Assembly will take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.15 at a later date.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.9, entitled “Sport as a means to\r\npromote education, health, development and peace”, as\r\norally revised.\r\nI wish to inform the Assembly that, since the\r\ndraft resolution’s submission, the following countries\r\nhave become co-sponsors: Andorra, the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya, Malta, Myanmar, Peru, San Marino,\r\nSuriname, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly wishes to\r\nadopt draft resolution A/59/L.9, as orally revised?\r\nDraft resolution A/59/L.9, as orally revised, was\r\nadopted (resolution 59/10).\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The General\r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 35.\r\nMay I take it that General Assembly decides to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 47?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 40\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the special session\r\non children\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/59/274)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Members will\r\nrecall that, on Monday 25 October 2004, at the fourth\r\ninformal meeting of the General Committee, which was\r\nopen to all Member States, Mr. Olara Otunnu, Under-\r\nSecretary-General and Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict,\r\ngave an informative and enlightening briefing on the\r\ntopic of children and armed conflict in order to\r\nenhance our consideration of this item.\r\nMr. Hamburger (Netherlands): I have the\r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The\r\ncandidate countries Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and\r\nCroatia; the countries of the Stabilization and\r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Albania,\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, the Former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, and Serbia and Montenegro;\r\nand the European Free Trade Association countries\r\nIceland and Norway, members of the European\r\nEconomic Area, align themselves with this statement.\r\nAt the special session on children in May 2002,\r\nwe committed ourselves to a Declaration and Plan of\r\nAction with the promising title “A world fit for\r\nchildren”. We also agreed to look into the progress and\r\nachievements of the goals outlined in the Plan of\r\nAction by including this item on the agenda of the\r\nfifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. The\r\nEuropean Union welcomes the present review, as it\r\nattaches great importance to the agreed concrete and\r\naction-oriented goals in the outcome document. It is\r\nour responsibility and duty to translate those goals into\r\nactions.\r\nThe end review of the World Summit for Children\r\nshowed that progress in creating a better world for\r\nchildren has been unequal. Millions of children still\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nlive in abject poverty, deprived of growing up in\r\ndignity and of access to education and other essential\r\nservices that could have offered them opportunities to\r\nmake a future of their own. Poverty is the main\r\nbottleneck in the realization of children’s rights.\r\nPoverty eradication is therefore at the heart of the\r\ndevelopment strategies adopted by the European Union\r\nand we believe that creating a world fit for children is\r\ncreating an enabling environment that has an impact on\r\nthe lives of children and their families. In\r\nimplementing our overarching policies on poverty\r\nalleviation, we focus on children by mainstreaming the\r\ngender and human rights, including children’s rights,\r\nset forth in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\r\nThe European Union acknowledges the fact that\r\nmany Governments have addressed the four priority\r\nareas in “A world fit for children” in their poverty\r\nreduction strategies and that progress has been\r\nachieved, notably in the areas of basic education,\r\nhealth, water and sanitation. However, there is concern\r\nthat few of the poverty reduction strategies place\r\nsignificant focus on child protection.\r\nThe European Union attaches great importance to\r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child and its\r\nOptional Protocols, which provide a comprehensive\r\nnormative framework for our policies in promoting and\r\nprotecting children’s rights, including in crises\r\nsituations. The European Union welcomes the fact that\r\nthe Committee on the Rights of the Child has produced\r\ngeneral comments on a number of important themes,\r\nsuch as on adolescent health and on HIV/AIDS,\r\nthereby giving guidance to States parties as to the\r\nimplementation of the provisions of the Convention\r\nand its Optional Protocols. We believe that this will\r\nhelp in developing and implementing child-focused\r\npolicies in the priority areas that are highlighted in the\r\nPlan of Action of the outcome document. We welcome\r\nthe fact that children’s rights are integrated into the\r\nwork of the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF), the International Labour Organization and\r\nother relevant organs of the United Nations. The\r\nEuropean Union calls upon all entities of the United\r\nNations system to continue working towards an\r\nintegrated response. Close coordination of respective\r\nactivities remains vital.\r\nThe European Union’s commitment to the cause\r\nof children is reflected in its policies, as well as in its\r\nefforts in developing partnerships and in mobilizing\r\nresources to promote children’s rights through the\r\nEuropean Union and its member States’ budgets. That\r\napproach is illustrated by the extensive input provided\r\nto the formulation of the European Union Guidelines\r\non Children and Armed Conflict by a range of\r\nchildren’s rights entities — including UNICEF, Save\r\nthe Children and the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict —\r\nand the cooperation on children’s rights training that is\r\nbeing pursued by UNICEF and the European\r\nCommission.\r\nIn that regard, States parties’ national plans of\r\naction for children are important instruments to put in\r\nplace mechanisms for meaningful partnerships, the\r\nallocation of resources, partnerships, implementation,\r\nmonitoring and evaluation. The European Union\r\ntherefore calls upon States parties that have not yet\r\ndone so to prepare or strengthen national action plans\r\nwith a set of specific time-bound and measurable goals\r\nand targets. In so doing, they should cooperate with\r\ncivil society actors, including the non-governmental\r\norganizations working for and with children, as well as\r\nwith children themselves.\r\nIt is important to involve children, as they have\r\nthe right to be taken into account in matters affecting\r\ntheir own lives. They have the right to play an active\r\nrole and to express their opinions in the community\r\nand society, not only on specific plans of action and\r\nprogrammes for children, but also on all programmes\r\nthat affect their lives. We recognize the need to ensure\r\nthat all children and young people are included without\r\ndiscrimination on the grounds of disability, gender,\r\nethnic origin, social status or any other cause, and to\r\nmake particular efforts to ensure that all children and\r\nyoung people benefit from development programmes.\r\nI would like to focus briefly on two priority areas\r\nthat are highlighted in the Plan of Action of the\r\noutcome document. One is providing quality education;\r\nthe other is combating HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe European Union is convinced that education,\r\nespecially of girls and women, is central for poverty\r\nreduction, the achievement of sustainable development\r\nand the construction of democratic, prosperous\r\nsocieties. The European Union reaffirms its strong\r\ncommitment to the Education for All (EFA) goals and\r\nto the second and third Millennium Development Goals\r\non achieving universal primary education by 2015 and\r\neliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary\r\neducation, preferably by 2005. We therefore urge all\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nStates to take all necessary measures to eliminate\r\nobstacles to the full realization of the right to\r\neducation, with particular emphasis on the education of\r\ngirls.\r\nAddressing the gender gap should be a key policy\r\npriority in the education plans of Governments for\r\nimproving access and quality. Considering the\r\nnecessity to increase funds and to improve the quality\r\nof education interventions, the European Union\r\nsupports the EFA Fast Track Initiative as an evolving\r\nglobal partnership of developing and donor countries\r\nand agencies to support global EFA goals. The\r\nEuropean Union underlines the need for education to\r\nbe protected and restored in conflict and post-conflict\r\nperiods. It considers education to be a key component\r\nof crisis-related policies and of reconstruction\r\nprogrammes. The European Union calls on all States to\r\npay special attention to the impact of HIV/AIDS on\r\neducation systems and the role education can play in\r\nconfronting HIV/AIDS vigorously and to take the\r\nappropriate measures to reinforce action in that area.\r\nAchieving the Millennium Development Goal of\r\nuniversal primary education requires special attention\r\nto the needs of marginalized groups of children and\r\nyoung people who are excluded from education,\r\nincluding those with disabilities, orphans and other\r\nchildren made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS, and other\r\ndisadvantaged groups.\r\nI wish to say a few more words on combating\r\nHIV/AIDS. Across the world, nearly 14 million\r\nchildren have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS and their\r\nnumbers will nearly double to 25 million by the end of\r\nthe decade. Moreover, millions have been made\r\nvulnerable by the disease, as HIV/AIDS both thrives\r\non and exacerbates other challenges, including poverty,\r\narmed conflict and gender discrimination. It rolls back\r\ndecades of progress in child survival. The European\r\nUnion calls upon all States to take immediate and\r\nnecessary measures — policies and programmes\r\nalike — to respond to the needs of millions of children\r\norphaned or affected by HIV/AIDS and their\r\ncaretakers.\r\nThere is an urgent need to massively scale up\r\nassistance and mobilize partnerships with the\r\ninternational donor community and national\r\nGovernments. The rapid delivery of resources is\r\nurgently needed. The European Union reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and\r\nmalaria. It welcomes the activities of the Global Fund\r\nto Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and\r\nencourages specific attention for children infected and\r\naffected by HIV/AIDS in developing countries. It\r\nrecognizes the role of older people in caring for\r\nchildren orphaned or affected by HIV/AIDS and the\r\nneed to include them in poverty reduction programmes.\r\nRelevant also is the need to ensure that young people\r\nhave access to accurate information, education and\r\nservices to promote sexual and reproductive health,\r\nand especially to help them to avoid HIV infection.\r\nAs we said in our statement to the Committee on\r\nthe Rights of the Child, sexual and reproductive health\r\nand rights are essential in the fight against HIV and\r\nAIDS, poverty and maternal and child mortality. The\r\nrights of young people concerning their own sexual and\r\nreproductive health are still too frequently ignored or\r\noverlooked. We again acknowledge the important work\r\ncarried out by UNICEF and the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund in creating awareness of and\r\nincreased access to information and services for young\r\npeople and adolescents.\r\nFinally, while acknowledging all the good work\r\nthat has been done so far, we have to remain focused\r\non the need to ensure that the follow-up to the outcome\r\nof the special session will bring about genuine\r\nimprovement in the lives of children. It is not about us\r\nreviewing year after year how much progress we have\r\nmade. It is about them and about how much of a future\r\nthey have.\r\nMr. Hackett (Barbados): On behalf of the States\r\nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM),\r\nMembers of the United Nations, I have the honour to\r\nmake this statement on agenda item 40, “Follow-up to\r\nthe outcome of the special session on children”, which\r\nseeks to provide the perspective of CARICOM\r\ncountries on that issue.\r\nI would first like to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his report in document A/59/274 on the follow-up\r\nto the United Nations special session on children,\r\nwhich was held in May 2002. The report\r\ncomprehensively outlines the progress made and the\r\nareas requiring further action in realizing the\r\ncommitments set out in the document “A world fit for\r\nchildren”.\r\nThe future survival of humankind depends in\r\nlarge part on how we now can implement policies to\r\nsafeguard and nurture our children. In that connection,\r\nthe 2002 special session on children was historic in\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nmany respects, but particularly so since close to\r\n190 countries adopted the Declaration and Plan of\r\nAction. It is also to be noted that the international\r\ncommunity overwhelmingly supported the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child, rendering it the most\r\npowerful human rights instrument for children.\r\nCARICOM countries have placed great focus on\r\nthe implementation of the Plan of Action to achieve the\r\nset of goals for children and young people that are an\r\nintegral part of the Declaration — promoting healthy\r\nlives, promoting quality education, protecting children\r\nagainst abuse, exploitation and violence, and\r\ncombating HIV/AIDS.\r\nCARICOM Governments, in fulfilment of their\r\ncommitment to creating a world fit for children, took\r\nimmediate steps after the special session to formulate a\r\nregional strategy. That led to the endorsement of the\r\nCARICOM regional framework for action by the\r\nCARICOM Council of Ministers for Human and Social\r\nDevelopment, which provides the basis for the\r\nimplementation of the strategy. CARICOM very much\r\nappreciates the support provided by the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) to national Governments,\r\nas well as to the CARICOM regional secretariat, in that\r\nwork.\r\nIn addition, virtually all CARICOM countries\r\nhave started the preparation of national plans of action\r\nfor children, and a few have even completed them.\r\nThis indicates that priority issues for children are being\r\nreflected in the national planning processes within our\r\nregion. What is particularly noteworthy is the fact that\r\nthere was a broad consultative process in the\r\ndevelopment of those national plans of action,\r\ninvolving not only Government agencies, but also civil\r\nsociety and international and regional organizations.\r\nThe evolution of Caribbean societies is currently\r\nat a phase in which almost two thirds of their\r\npopulations are under the age of 30. That phenomenon\r\npresents both opportunities and challenges for national\r\nand regional development and helps to explain why\r\nthis agenda item is of particular importance to\r\nCARICOM countries. Indeed, we believe that young\r\npeople have to play a significant role in the continuing\r\nbuilding and maintenance of our stable and democratic\r\nsocieties. It therefore becomes essential that their\r\nassets be harnessed. Significant investments have been\r\nmade in most of the CARICOM countries to ensure\r\nthat children get a good start on life with a view to\r\nattaining the goals of the Plan of Action. Efforts in the\r\nregion continue to build on lessons learned and shared\r\nexperiences from other countries.\r\nOn the first goal of promoting healthy lives,\r\nnearly all CARICOM countries have immunization\r\nprogrammes in place, which contributes to higher\r\nfigures on child survival rates. The second goal of\r\nprotection against abuse, exploitation and violence is\r\nproving to be more challenging, as incidences in all\r\nthree areas continue unabated. CARICOM countries\r\nhave, however, committed themselves to improving\r\nstandards for child protection.\r\nRegarding the goal of providing quality\r\neducation, CARICOM member States view education\r\nas an investment in human resources and as a means\r\ntowards achieving economic and social development.\r\nArticle 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild, which speaks explicitly to the responsibility of\r\nStates to make education accessible to all children, has\r\nbeen given special attention by the countries of the\r\nregion. Thus it will be found that, throughout the\r\nregion, boys and girls alike are entitled to free primary\r\nand secondary education and, in some cases, tertiary as\r\nwell.\r\nOn the issue of combating HIV/AIDS, we do\r\nshare the view of the Secretary-General that the\r\nHIV/AIDS epidemic is a massive and increasing\r\ndisaster for children. Similarly to the global situation, a\r\nlarge number of Caribbean children under the age of 15\r\nare either infected with the HIV virus or living with\r\nAIDS. Additionally, the high incidences of infection\r\nare orphaning many children. Another aspect of the\r\ndisease in the region has been the high level of mother-\r\nto-child transmission. For CARICOM countries, the\r\nspectre of HIV/AIDS destroying one of our greatest\r\nresources — our children and youth — is daunting.\r\nThe Governments of the region, however, have\r\nresponded with a focus on prevention and treatment\r\nprogrammes. All member States now have national\r\nAIDS programmes and Governments strive to allocate\r\nadditional financial resources to fight HIV/AIDS.\r\nAlthough CARICOM countries are making good\r\nprogress in the attainment of the goals of the Plan of\r\nAction, there remain significant challenges in a number\r\nof areas. For example, there still exists in many of our\r\ncountries a weak national statistical capacity,\r\nparticularly in accessing disaggregated data on the\r\npriority areas of the Plan of Action. In that regard,\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nCARICOM countries welcome the initiative of\r\nUNICEF to develop a new round of multiple indicator\r\ncluster surveys that will provide data for reporting on\r\nprogress towards the child-related Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, as well as the goals of “A world\r\nfit for children”. We certainly hope that UNICEF will\r\ninclude the countries of the Caribbean subregion in\r\nthose indicator cluster surveys.\r\nAnother major challenge is the problem of youth,\r\ncrime and violence in our societies. We certainly need\r\nto do more to invest in the period of adolescence in\r\ntrying to combat the increasing incidence of violence\r\nand sexual abuse. In that regard, CARICOM countries\r\nwill seek to adopt a process that is more inclusive of\r\nchildren and young people themselves in all phases of\r\nfollow-up processes at the national and regional levels.\r\nAnother challenge is the fact that the current level\r\nof available resources is proving to be inadequate and\r\nthere is a need for significant increases in financial\r\nresources to fund programmes. Indeed, it is\r\nindisputable that the global targets we have set require\r\nfurther financial assistance and fresh, new approaches.\r\nCARICOM member States therefore call for a\r\nrecommitment to the implementation of the Monterrey\r\nConsensus, particularly the targets for domestic and\r\ninternational resource mobilization and investment in\r\nbasic social and economic infrastructure, health,\r\neducation and social security programmes that pay\r\nspecial attention to children. Developing countries\r\nneed concrete action and support to make the targets of\r\nthe Plan of Action a reality. We believe that the world’s\r\nchildren cannot wait any longer for action to be taken.\r\nIn closing, we recognize that the obstacles to\r\nrealizing the rights of children in the twenty-first\r\ncentury are daunting, but fortunately, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has correctly pointed out in his report,\r\n“The goals of ‘A world fit for children’ are\r\nbenefiting from the widespread support among\r\nGovernments and international agencies for the\r\nMillennium Development Goals” (A/59/274,\r\npara. 94),\r\nfor a number of the Millennium Development Goals\r\ndirectly address the rights of children. Indeed, it can be\r\nargued that, since children represent one of the most\r\nvulnerable groups in society, the first Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goal of halving poverty by the year 2015\r\nis unlikely to be realized unless the problems of\r\nchildren are successfully addressed.\r\nRecognizing that reporting on the implementation\r\nof the Declaration and Plan of Action is key to\r\ndetermining the progress that is being achieved,\r\nCARICOM countries remain committed to preparing\r\nnational and subregional reports, particularly in 2006,\r\nin time for the commemorative plenary meeting\r\nscheduled for 2007. As I indicated earlier, CARICOM\r\nlooks forward to the support of international\r\norganizations, particularly UNICEF, in helping the\r\ncountries of the region in the collection and retrieval of\r\nthe vital information necessary for the conduct of the\r\nrequired in-depth reviews.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nThe Chinese delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his second annual report under agenda item\r\n40, contained in document A/59/274. The report gives\r\nquite a comprehensive account of the progress\r\nachieved at the country level over the past year in the\r\nfollow-up to the outcome of the special session on\r\nchildren. It identifies existing difficulties and problems\r\nand offers recommendations.\r\nThe Chinese delegation also notes that, of the 190\r\ncountries involved in the formulation of the Plan of\r\nAction and the text of “A world fit for children”, 170\r\nhave either taken or intend to take action. That marks a\r\nvery auspicious beginning.\r\nThe Chinese Government has always attached\r\ngreat importance to the development of children. In the\r\n1990s, the Chinese Government formulated and\r\nimplemented a decade-long national programme of\r\naction for childhood development. In May 2001, the\r\nChinese Government promulgated the national\r\nprogramme of action for childhood development for\r\nthe period 2001-2010, identifying development goals\r\nin the four areas of health, education, legal protection\r\nand environment. Those goals conformed to the global\r\nobjectives for children’s development, as specified at\r\nthe special session on children, and took fully into\r\naccount the current situation in the development and\r\nneeds of Chinese children.\r\nThe implementation of the national programme of\r\naction has already become an important component of\r\nthe follow-up to the special session. The regional and\r\nlocal Governments in China have drafted a series of\r\npolicies and implementation programmes for the\r\nrealization of the goals established at the special\r\nsession and provided the necessary human and\r\nfinancial resources to further advance that process.\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nSince its inception in 1990 as the focal point of\r\nchildren’s development, the National Working\r\nCommittee on Children, working under the auspices of\r\nthe State Council of China and consisting of\r\nrepresentatives of 32 Government departments and\r\nsocial groups, has made significant efforts to promote\r\nthe implementation of the law on the protection of\r\nminors, the law on compulsory education, the law on\r\nthe protection of the rights and interests of women, the\r\nlaw on maternal and infant health care, and other\r\nlegislation on the protection of the rights and interests\r\nof women and children so as to advance the\r\nimplementation of the national programmes of action\r\nfor women’s and childhood development, while\r\nstrengthening the lead role of Government at all levels\r\nand departments concerned in work relating to women\r\nand children and in promoting international exchanges\r\nand cooperation in that regard.\r\nThe largest non-governmental organization in\r\nChina, the All China Women’s Federation, focuses as\r\nalways on issues relating to children, such as their\r\nrights, protection, education, health, participation and\r\ndevelopment. Since the special session on children, the\r\nAll China Women’s Federation has incorporated the\r\nmoral and ethical education of minors into its overall\r\nwork and provided guidance on family education. It\r\nhas focused great attention on vulnerable groups of\r\nchildren and striven earnestly to protect children’s\r\nlegitimate rights and interests. It has prioritized girls\r\nand their growth so as to lay sound foundations for\r\ntheir future development. It has also mobilized\r\nextensive social resources to provide assistance to\r\nchildren in need.\r\nWe have made a good beginning of our\r\nimplementation of the national programme of action\r\nfor child development as a follow-up to the outcome of\r\nthe special session on children. However, we continue\r\nto face a wide range of problems and challenges in\r\nchild development in China as a result of numerous\r\nconstraints, including the level of social and economic\r\ndevelopment. For example, in poor regions child\r\ndevelopment continues to lag behind, the rights and\r\ninterests of children’s groups lack full guarantees and\r\njuvenile delinquency is on the rise.\r\nIn the light of those problems, the Chinese\r\nGovernment is taking active and effective steps to\r\naddress them, while vigorously developing its economy\r\nto eradicate poverty and to build a solid foundation for\r\nthe realization of children’s rights. We are also in the\r\nprocess of formulating a series of intervention policies,\r\nincluding ongoing projects aimed at compulsory\r\neducation in poor regions, financial aid for needy\r\nstudents, equal schooling opportunities for migrant\r\nchildren and legal assistance for minors.\r\nSince the special session on children was\r\nconvened more than two years ago, encouraging\r\nprogress has been made in carrying out follow-up\r\nactivities on a global scale. However, we must be fully\r\naware of two major obstacles to child development\r\nthroughout the world: poverty and a scarcity of\r\nresources. Poverty not only deprives children of what\r\nthey need, but also makes it difficult to sustain the\r\ngains achieved. The mounting threats to children’s\r\nwell-being, such as HIV/AIDS, conflict and instability,\r\nall have poverty as their root cause. In addition, the\r\nlack of resources — particularly the scarcity of\r\nresources at the disposal of developing countries for\r\nsocial development — limits child development.\r\nWe hope that the international community will\r\ncontinue to undertake efforts aimed at supporting child\r\ndevelopment. In that context, we appeal to the\r\ndeveloped countries to increase their official\r\ndevelopment assistance, to increase the proportion of\r\nthat assistance for children and to assume greater\r\ninternational responsibility for child development in\r\ndeveloping countries. At the same time, we hope that\r\nUNICEF will play an increasingly coordinated role\r\nwithin the United Nations system in the area of child\r\ndevelopment.\r\nChina will, as always, continue to take an active\r\npart in international cooperation on child development\r\nwith a view to promoting the survival, protection,\r\ndevelopment and participation of children and creating\r\na better future for them.\r\nMs. Mogaka (Kenya): My delegation has the\r\nhonour to participate in the debate on this important\r\nissue, namely, follow-up to the outcome of the special\r\nsession on children. We would like to take this\r\nopportunity to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for his report on the status of the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child (A/59/190).\r\nMy delegation welcomes the adoption in April by\r\nthe Commission on Human Rights of its resolution\r\n2004/48 on the rights of the child. That resolution is\r\ntimely, as it addresses general topics of implementation\r\nof the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other\r\ninstruments — protection and promotion of the rights\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nof the child; non-discrimination; protection and\r\npromotion of the rights of children in particularly\r\ndifficult situations; the prevention and eradication of\r\nthe sale of children, child prostitution and child\r\npornography; and recovery. My delegation recognizes\r\nthe efforts of the Executive Director of UNICEF,\r\nMs. Carol Bellamy, in pursuit of the well-being of the\r\nworld’s children.\r\nKenya has signed and ratified the Convention and\r\nits Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in\r\narmed conflict. Kenya has also signed the Optional\r\nProtocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and\r\nchild pornography.\r\nThe Government of Kenya enacted a\r\ncomprehensive Children’s Act in March 2002. By\r\npassing that legislation, the Government undertook to\r\nput in place safeguards for the realization of the rights\r\npromoted by the Committee on the Rights of the Child.\r\nIndeed, the Government has embarked on a very\r\ncomprehensive programme to implement the Act. A\r\nfamily court has been established to promote the\r\nwelfare of the family as the custodian of children’s\r\nrights. That is in line with the Committee’s\r\nrecommendation that Member States bring their\r\nlegislation, policies, programmes and juvenile justice\r\nsystems in line with the Committee’s requirements and\r\nthe rules of other relevant legal instruments.\r\nIn the education sector, the Government declared,\r\nin January 2003, free and compulsory primary\r\neducation. That has increased enrolment in primary\r\nschools by more than 1 million. Although that in turn\r\nhas put considerable strain on our educational\r\nfacilities, we are grateful to our development partners\r\nwho continue to support the Government in that worthy\r\ncause. In addition, a national reproductive health\r\nprogramme has been established to ensure the optimum\r\nhealth of our children from conception. Together with\r\nour adolescent reproductive health strategy, gender\r\npolicy and youth policy, the Government has put\r\nprogrammes in place to ensure that our children’s\r\nneeds are met at all levels of development.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic continues to ravage the African continent.\r\nThe effects of HIV/AIDS on family life are\r\ndevastating. Orphaned children are left without\r\nparental love and security. Often, they are also sick and\r\nare forced to drop out of school. In order to address\r\nthose issues, the Government of Kenya is committed to\r\npolicies aimed at improving the general welfare of\r\nchildren. Those include, inter alia, building and\r\nstrengthening governmental, family and community\r\ncapabilities to provide a palliative environment for\r\norphans and those affected by HIV/AIDS; ensuring\r\naccess to school, shelter and good health; and\r\nprotecting orphans and vulnerable children from all\r\nforms of abuse, violence, exploitation, discrimination\r\nand loss of inheritance.\r\nIn addition, a national policy on orphaned\r\nchildren will be finalized by the end of this year. The\r\npolicy will ensure that orphans are not discriminated\r\nagainst and that they enjoy full human rights. While\r\nthe Government will continue to enhance respect for\r\nchildren’s rights and to improve their welfare, there is\r\nconcern that the burden of external debt keeps\r\nincreasing at a time when official development\r\nassistance is decreasing, thus reducing Kenya’s\r\ncapacity for greater investment in the provision of\r\nbasic social services for its children.\r\nA wise man once said that the birth of a child is\r\nGod’s way of showing that He has not given up on the\r\nworld. Yet, when one looks at the situation of many of\r\nthe world’s children — particularly those in areas of\r\narmed conflict — the violence and abuse meted out to\r\nthese innocent victims is disheartening. My delegation\r\ntherefore wishes to express its appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for establishing the Office of the\r\nSpecial Representative for Children and Armed\r\nConflict to address critical issues pertaining to children\r\naffected by armed conflicts. We commend the good\r\nwork carried out over the years by the Special\r\nRepresentative, Mr. Olara Otunnu, and by his Office.\r\nWe also wish to thank him for the report he has\r\nprepared on this item and for the informative briefing\r\nhe gave two days ago outlining the role of his Office.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that the work of the\r\nOffice has resulted in greater visibility and advocacy of\r\nthis issue and that a comprehensive body of norms has\r\nbeen put in place to protect children in armed conflict.\r\nIn addition, the issue of children’s protection has been\r\nincluded in various peace accords. Despite all that,\r\nmany parties to conflicts continue to disregard those\r\nstandards, often with impunity. My delegation\r\nwelcomes the mainstreaming of the issue currently\r\ntaking place in the United Nations and its agencies, and\r\nwe concur with the appeal of the Special\r\nRepresentative with regard to the need to create a\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\npolitical and social climate that will make the abuse of\r\nchildren unacceptable.\r\nWe support the deployment of child protection\r\nadvisers in peacekeeping missions and the training of\r\npeacekeeping personnel in children’s protection and\r\nchild rights. As a major troop-contributing country and\r\nas the host of scores of young victims of armed\r\nconflict, Kenya supports initiatives aimed at the pre-\r\ndeployment training of peacekeepers serving in\r\nregional and United Nations peace operations.\r\nMy delegation is of the view that strengthening\r\nsubregional initiatives to end practices that are harmful\r\nto children, including the illicit exploitation of natural\r\nresources and the proliferation of small arms and light\r\nweapons, as well as the cross-border recruitment and\r\nuse of children in armed conflict, should be of\r\nparamount importance to all concerned.\r\nFinally, we welcome the emphasis placed on\r\nsupporting local institutions and regional networks\r\nwhereby indigenous norms and values for the\r\nprotection of women and children will be utilized,\r\ntogether with international judicial norms, to ensure\r\nlocal ownership and long-term sustainability. We will\r\ncontinue to support the United Nations in its efforts to\r\nput an end to the climate of impunity in which crimes\r\nare committed against children in the context of armed\r\nconflict. In this regard, all parties responsible for\r\ncrimes against children should be brought to justice.\r\nMr. Mabhongo (South Africa): We are honoured\r\nto deliver this statement under agenda item 40. South\r\nAfrica would like to associate itself with the statement\r\nmade by Namibia in the Third Committee under\r\nagenda item 103 on behalf of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) Group.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the comprehensive\r\nreport by the Secretary-General on the follow-up to the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s special session on children in\r\n2002. The report’s focus on progress achieved in\r\nrealizing the commitments set out in the outcome\r\ndocument of the special session, entitled “A World Fit\r\nfor Children”, assists in identifying problems and\r\nconstraints and makes invaluable recommendations on\r\nactions needed to achieve further progress.\r\nThe African Union’s African Common Position,\r\nentitled “Africa Fit for Children”, was presented at the\r\nspecial session on children. As more than half of\r\nAfrica’s population consists of children and young\r\npeople, we aptly stated in our Common Position that\r\nthe future of our continent lies in the well-being of our\r\nchildren and youth. The prospects for the socio-\r\neconomic transformation of Africa depend upon the\r\ninvestment in its young people. Today’s investment in\r\nchildren is tomorrow’s peace, stability, democracy and\r\nsustainable development. In that context, it is only by\r\nproviding young Africans with health care, education\r\nand confidence in a bright future that we will achieve\r\nour goals of social and economic development.\r\nConsequently, all States Members of the United\r\nNations adopted the Declaration and Plan of Action\r\nentitled “A World Fit for Children” at the historic\r\nspecial session. We committed ourselves to time-bound\r\ngoals for children and young people, with a particular\r\nfocus on promoting healthy lives, providing quality\r\neducation, protecting children against abuse,\r\nexploitation and violence, and combating HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe four major goal areas of the document entitled “A\r\nWorld Fit for Children” strongly reinforce the\r\nMillennium Declaration and Millennium Development\r\nGoals, seven of which directly address and affect the\r\nrights of children. Therefore, the agenda item on “A\r\nWorld Fit for Children” is closely linked with\r\ninternational efforts to ensure sustainable social and\r\neconomic development and to mobilize additional\r\nresources for much-needed investments in the health,\r\neducation and protection of children with a view to\r\ncontributing to broad-based poverty reduction and\r\nsocio-economic progress.\r\nAlthough progress has been made on the\r\ncontinent to integrate the goals of the special session\r\ninto national poverty-reduction strategies and national\r\nplans of action on children, much more needs to be\r\ndone. According to an advocacy and policy publication\r\nreleased this year, entitled The Young Face of NEPAD,\r\nAfrica accounts for only 12 per cent of the world’s\r\npopulation, yet has 43 per cent of the world’s child\r\ndeaths, 50 per cent of the world’s maternal deaths, 70\r\nper cent of those living with HIV/AIDS and a\r\nstaggering 90 per cent of the world’s children orphaned\r\nby HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, Africa’s children are\r\ncaught up in conflicts and are victims of violence,\r\ntrafficking and sexual and commercial exploitation.\r\nThe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) is regarded as an important vehicle for\r\ndelivering on our international commitments to\r\nchildren and ensuring the sustainability of their rights.\r\nNEPAD calls for bold leadership and for partnerships\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nbetween African Governments and their citizens and\r\nbetween Africa and the international community. The\r\nrights and welfare of children and the participation of\r\nyoung people should be central to these partnerships\r\nand to leadership if we are to honour our commitments\r\nalready made.\r\nOur regional and subregional structures — the\r\nAfrican Union and the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity — are playing an important role in\r\nmaintaining political support for the goals of the\r\nspecial session and in monitoring progress throughout\r\nmember countries. For example, the African Union and\r\nUNICEF are collaborating to establish a database on\r\nchild-related indicators for Africa, and a first\r\nmonitoring report on the state of Africa’s children has\r\nbeen prepared. My delegation supports the\r\nrecommendation that such mechanisms can be further\r\nutilized to facilitate the intercountry exchange of\r\nexperience and good practices in child-related\r\nprogrammes.\r\nSouth Africa’s National Programme of Action for\r\nChildren was developed following its ratification of the\r\nConvention on the Rights of Child in 1995. This has\r\neffectively mainstreamed issues affecting the lives of\r\nour children. It commits all spheres of government to\r\nefforts in this area and ensures that the rights of\r\nchildren remain on the agenda of the legislature, the\r\nexecutive and the judiciary. The National Programme\r\nis coordinated by the Office of the Rights of the Child\r\nin the presidency. This coordinating and monitoring\r\nbody works in partnership with Government\r\ndepartments and international agencies such as\r\nUNICEF, as well as with civil society.\r\nIn recent years there has been significant progress\r\nin developing and strengthening the system of social\r\nassistance — South Africa’s key instrument for direct\r\npoverty relief. By April 2004, my Government had\r\nsurpassed its target of registering 3 million children for\r\nthe child support grant. South Africa has made\r\nimprovements with regard to social security by\r\nincreasing the eligibility age of the child support grant\r\nto 14 years over the next three years, as a way of\r\nprogressively realizing and prioritizing children’s\r\nsocio-economic rights as enshrined in our constitution.\r\nEqual opportunities and access to quality\r\neducation is pivotal to all children in South Africa. In\r\nthis regard, the South African Schools Act promotes\r\naccess, quality and democratic governance in the\r\nschooling system. It ensures that all learners have\r\naccess to quality education without discrimination, and\r\nmakes schooling compulsory for children aged seven to\r\n15. The Act’s provision for democratic school\r\ngovernance through school governing bodies is in\r\nplace in public schools countrywide. The school\r\nfunding norms outlined in the Act prioritize redress\r\nand target poverty in funding allocations to the public\r\nschooling system.\r\nIn conclusion, we remain committed to the\r\npriorities outlined in the “World Fit for Children”\r\ndocument, and have organized our programmes to\r\nensure that they are in line with the aspirations of all of\r\nour children. One of the main priorities of South Africa\r\nis service delivery to children. Much has been achieved\r\nin this realm, but much more needs to be done. In order\r\nfor services to be delivered, policies and programmes\r\nmust be implemented. South Africa’s National\r\nProgramme of Action is well placed to ensure that such\r\nimplementation takes place. The Government of South\r\nAfrica will accelerate service delivery to children. We\r\nwill strengthen our resolve to do more for our children.\r\nMy delegation therefore wishes to take this\r\nopportunity fully to commit itself to the creation of a\r\nworld fit for our children.\r\nMs. Hull (United States of America): The United\r\nStates is pleased to speak on the follow-up to the\r\nUnited Nations special session on children. As we\r\nnoted at the time of the special session on children in\r\n2002, it represented great hope for children around the\r\nworld. The session resulted in a strong consensus that,\r\nfor both moral and practical reasons, we need to put\r\nchildren first. We salute the outstanding leadership of\r\nUNICEF on children’s issues and its courageous efforts\r\nto embody its mission statement to help children meet\r\ntheir basic needs and to expand their opportunities to\r\nreach their full potential. Indeed, this is the mission\r\nthat all of us should adopt and implement in our\r\nnational capacities.\r\nThe United States today reaffirms its commitment\r\nto work for children’s well-being everywhere. In this,\r\nthe tenth anniversary of the Year of the Family, we\r\nremind delegates that a stable, loving family\r\nenvironment is the best investment in children. As\r\nUNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy notes, the\r\nfamily is a child’s first line of protection.\r\nThe world today is confronted by political,\r\neconomic, and security opportunities and challenges\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nthat children in the twenty-first century must meet.\r\nHow can we help ensure that our children will be\r\nready?\r\nWe see three tracks that, when connected and\r\nacted upon simultaneously, will give our children the\r\nresources and the capacity to succeed. These are\r\nleading by example at home, engaging with the United\r\nNations and supporting other international efforts.\r\nAs to leading by example at home, if we, the\r\ninternational community, aspire to better lives for our\r\nchildren, we each must support our own families and\r\ncommunities at home. Protecting children and\r\nstrengthening families is a core concern of the United\r\nStates. As President Bush has said, the safety and well-\r\nbeing of our children is a shared priority for all\r\nAmericans, as well as for federal, state, and local\r\nauthorities.\r\nIn the United States, we have strengthened\r\nmechanisms for monitoring children’s web sites on the\r\nInternet. have strengthened laws against child\r\npornography. We have also given law enforcement new\r\ntools to prevent, investigate, and prosecute violent\r\ncrimes against children, and we are increasing\r\npunishment for federal crimes against children. We are\r\nnationally expanding and coordinating an alert system\r\nthat notifies the public about child abductions, and our\r\nPresident has signed a Promoting Safe and Stable\r\nFamilies Act to help states promote adoption for\r\nchildren in foster care and to provide post-adoptive\r\nsupport to families.\r\nThe second track concerns engaging with the\r\nUnited Nations. Diarrhoea alone kills the equivalent of\r\na jumbo-jet full of children every 4 hours.\r\nContaminated water, unsanitary living conditions,\r\nwater shortages, and poor hygiene kill 2 million\r\nchildren each year. Yet another 2 million children die\r\nbecause they lack access to immunization. And while\r\ndramatic progress has been made in reducing child\r\ndeaths, almost 10 million still die each year, with\r\nalmost 4 million of those deaths occurring in the first\r\n28 days of life.\r\nIn the face of that continuing tragedy, the United\r\nStates Agency for International Development has\r\nteamed up with UNICEF, the World Health\r\nOrganization, the World Bank, The Canadian\r\nInternational Development Agency and other\r\ndeveloping country, multilateral and bilateral partners,\r\nnon-governmental organizations and the Gates\r\nFoundation to form a new alliance called the Global\r\nChild Survival Partnership. Together, through global\r\nattention and action, we want to improve child health\r\nand save children from dying of preventable causes.\r\nWe commend Ms. Shahida Azfar, Interim Director of\r\nthe Partnership, for her leadership.\r\nWith respect to the third track, support for other\r\ninternational efforts, global partnerships are critical to\r\nwin the fight against the modern-day slavery of\r\ntrafficking in human beings. International cooperation\r\nhas helped prosecute nearly 8,000 perpetrators of\r\ntrafficking worldwide, resulting in more than 2,800\r\nconvictions last year. Since 2001, the United States\r\nGovernment has provided more than $295 million to\r\nsupport antitrafficking programmes in 120 countries.\r\nWe have launched Operation Predator to safeguard\r\nchildren from paedophiles, human traffickers,\r\ninternational sex tourists and Internet pornographers.\r\nWe have secured a commitment from the travel and\r\ntourism industry to develop a code of conduct to\r\nprevent the sexual exploitation of children in travel and\r\ntourism.\r\nEight thousand people — including thousands of\r\nchildren — will die today of HIV/AIDS, and many\r\nmore will be infected. President Bush is leading the\r\ninternational campaign to control this pandemic\r\nthrough the Emergency Plan for HIV/AIDS, which will\r\nprovide $15 billion over five years in a multifaceted\r\napproach. Not only does the Emergency Plan focus on\r\n15 targeted countries in Africa, the Caribbean and\r\nSouth-East Asia, but our Government also has bilateral\r\nagreements with over 100 other nations.\r\nOne pillar of the Emergency Plan is providing\r\ncare to 10 million AIDS orphans and people living\r\nwith HIV/AIDS. In the first 18 months of the Initiative\r\nto Prevent Mother to Child Transmission, 378,000\r\nwomen received services and an estimated 4,800\r\nchildren — who would otherwise have been\r\ninfected — were born HIV-free.\r\nAdditionally, the United States is the strongest\r\nsupporter of the Global Fund to fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, and was instrumental in its\r\nfounding. We have continued to be the largest donor.\r\nWith the Millennium Challenge Account, the\r\nUnited States has launched the most innovative\r\napproach to foreign affairs in the last 50 years. We\r\ninvest in those countries that are committed to ruling\r\njustly, investing in their people and encouraging\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\neconomic freedom. For the first year of that\r\nprogramme our Congress allocated $1 billion in\r\nfunding. We selected 16 countries to be eligible to\r\nreceive that assistance as they take steps to ensure a\r\nbrighter future for their children. To truly protect and\r\nimprove the lives of our children, we must each engage\r\nconstructively in international partnerships, while\r\ntaking concrete responsibility at home.\r\nOur thanks and appreciation go again to UNICEF\r\nfor helping coordinate this cause — and for the support\r\nit gives to parents, families, and communities around\r\nthe world striving to provide their children with health,\r\nhappiness, and opportunity. As our Secretary of State,\r\nColin Powell, has said,\r\n“There is no element of our society more\r\nvulnerable than our children and there is no group\r\nof people who will have a more direct impact on\r\nour future. They are our future. This new century\r\nwill be theirs, not ours.”\r\nMr. Tan Kee Kwong (Malaysia): On behalf of\r\nthe Malaysian delegation, I wish to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his report, which contains the\r\nsecond update of the progress made in the follow-up to\r\nthe special session of the General Assembly on\r\nchildren (A/59/274). We are pleased to join Mr. Kul\r\nGautam, Deputy Executive Director of UNICEF, who\r\nintroduced the report in the Third Committee on\r\n18 October, in noting that Governments are taking\r\nsubstantive measures to pursue the goals aimed at\r\ncreating “a world fit for children”, as envisaged in the\r\nDeclaration and Plan of Action adopted at the special\r\nsession in May 2002.\r\nIt appears that rapid progress has been achieved\r\nin certain areas while setbacks have occurred in others.\r\nWe note the Secretary-General’s assessment that while\r\nmany countries had taken concrete action in 2003 to\r\ntranslate the commitments made in 2002 into national\r\naction plans and policies, the overall rate of progress\r\nhas been uneven.\r\nThe situation seems to be more encouraging now.\r\nWe note especially that almost two thirds of the\r\ncountries in sub-Saharan Africa have opted to integrate\r\nthe goals of the special session into their poverty\r\nreduction strategies and that some 18 countries have\r\nadopted or intend to develop a national plan of action\r\nor policy paper on children.\r\nMy delegation remains sensitive to the fact that\r\nsome 30,000 children lose their lives every day for\r\npreventable reasons. While there is a clear and genuine\r\neffort to strengthen partnerships within the\r\ninternational community to increase child survival and\r\npromote healthy lives, more surely needs to be done to\r\nachieve the targets set by the Millennium Development\r\nGoals in areas such as reducing infant and under-five\r\nmortality, increasing routine immunizations and\r\nsupplies of vitamins for children, improving maternal\r\nhealth, reducing preventable diseases and providing\r\ngreater access to safe drinking water. Similarly, greater\r\nefforts are required to promote the other goals set at the\r\nspecial session, namely providing quality education,\r\nprotecting against abuse, exploitation and violence and\r\ncombating HIV/AIDS.\r\nMalaysia is pleased to participate in some of\r\nthose efforts at the regional and multilateral levels. At\r\nthe national level, many of our efforts have been\r\ncarried out in the context of the second National Plan\r\nof Action for Children, encompassing the period 2001\r\nto 2020. That Plan of Action was formulated in\r\nconformity with Malaysia’s Vision 2020 strategy, the\r\nprovisions of the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild, as well as the outcome document of the special\r\nsession on children.\r\nWhile the goals of “A world fit for children”\r\n(A/S-27/19/Rev.1) set a particular focus on four areas,\r\nministers in the East Asia and Pacific region, during\r\nthe Sixth East Asia and Pacific Ministerial\r\nConsultation on Children held in May 2003, identified\r\neducation as the overarching imperative for the region.\r\nIn addition, the ministers set four issues as regional\r\npriorities: action against commercial sexual\r\nexploitation and trafficking; fighting HIV/AIDS;\r\nimproving nutrition; and reducing maternal and\r\nneonatal mortality. Malaysia feels that those are\r\nimportant areas that might merit consideration in other\r\nregions as well.\r\nMy delegation commends the invaluable support\r\nand commitment demonstrated by the relevant United\r\nNations development agencies in gearing their\r\nactivities to assist and support Member States in\r\nimplementing the policies, plans and programmes\r\nproposed in the Plan of Action of the special session.\r\nWe urge the relevant United Nations agencies to\r\ncontinue their efforts to assist developing countries to\r\nestablish and strengthen their national capacity and\r\ninstitutions for the promotion and protection of the\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nrights of children. They could also explore the\r\npossibility of working in tandem with regional\r\norganizations, where appropriate, to assist Member\r\nStates achieve the goals set by the special session.\r\nMalaysia has consistently made a conscious\r\ndecision to set education as the cornerstone of the\r\nnational agenda. That commitment is underscored by\r\nthe fact that 20.6 per cent of the total development\r\nallocation under the Eighth Malaysia Plan, covering\r\nthe period 2001-2005, is allocated to education. In the\r\nbudget presented by the Government to Parliament\r\nrecently, the largest allocation is for the education\r\nsector, accounting for almost one quarter of total\r\noperating allocations.\r\nMalaysia’s national education policy is geared\r\ntowards providing basic education for a minimum of\r\nnine years. There is equal access to educational\r\nopportunities for both boys and girls, with the rate of\r\nenrolment between the two genders being almost at\r\npar — or 50.4 per cent boys and 49.6 per cent girls —\r\nexcept at the tertiary level where there is higher\r\nenrolment by girls as compared with boys. Having put\r\nin place educational facilities throughout the country\r\nfor the disabled, the Government has now made\r\nprimary education compulsory for all.\r\nWith a 98 per cent rate of enrolment in primary\r\nschool, the Government has now moved a step\r\nfurther — by embarking on the provision of quality\r\neducation to ensure that children have access to the\r\nbest learning system so that they will be able to cope\r\nwith the rapid progress of the information age. Efforts\r\nundertaken in that regard include modernizing schools,\r\nensuring that teachers are well-trained and equipping\r\nall schools with computer laboratories and information\r\nand communications technology equipment.\r\nA sum of RM 5.5 billion has been allocated under\r\nthe Eighth Malaysia Plan to further develop the health\r\nsector. Malaysia is constantly upgrading its medical\r\nfacilities and programmes. There has been a steady\r\ndecline in maternal and neonatal mortality in Malaysia,\r\nwhich currently stand at 0.2 per 1,000 pregnancies and\r\n5 per 1,000 live births, respectively. Health and\r\ncommunity clinics set up throughout the country\r\nprovide services such as immunization and normal\r\ndevelopment assessment for children and ensure that\r\nour children enjoy optimal health.\r\nMalaysia has become committed to the concept of\r\ntotal rehabilitation for disabled children since it was\r\nfirst highlighted in 1979 during an Asian conference\r\nfor the handicapped. Total rehabilitation entails a\r\nmultidisciplinary approach: rehabilitative services for\r\ndisabled children are provided by the Department of\r\nSocial Welfare through institutional services, with the\r\nMinistry of Health providing technical input. The\r\nDepartment has also forged smart partnerships with\r\nnon-governmental organizations by supporting them\r\nfinancially in the administration and management of\r\nthe institutional centres they operate.\r\nTurning to the issue of protecting children from\r\nabuse, exploitation and violence, the Child Act 2001,\r\nformulated in line with the provisions of the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, sets out\r\nprovisions for the care and protection of children in\r\nMalaysia. A Court for Children has been established,\r\nwhich allows the child concerned to participate in\r\ndiscussions and deliberations in court. In the area of\r\nchild abuse, Malaysia has developed mechanisms for\r\nchild protection, care and rehabilitation through the\r\nsetting-up of intersectoral teams at district and state\r\nhospitals to deal with suspected child abuse and\r\nneglect. A milestone in preventive measures is the\r\nestablishment of child protection teams, which set out\r\nmultiple programmes run by the community for the\r\ncommunity. Among other things, they conduct parental\r\neducation activities and serve as counselling centres.\r\nWhile having identified action against\r\ncommercial sexual exploitation and trafficking in\r\nchildren as the first of the four regional priorities for\r\nchild protection, Malaysia is mindful that that\r\nchallenge cannot be surmounted by any one country\r\nacting alone. Malaysia subscribes to the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Declaration on the\r\nCommitments for Children in ASEAN adopted in\r\n2001, the first document fully dedicated to ASEAN\r\nchildren in this millennium. Under that Declaration,\r\nASEAN has drawn up cooperation programmes to\r\ncombat child-trafficking and intercountry adoption. At\r\nthe same time, programmes have been put in place to\r\nprovide alternative family-care arrangements for the\r\nvictims of child abuse, neglect and exploitation, as well\r\nas to address the special needs of children with\r\ndisabilities.\r\nRecognizing the devastating impact of\r\nHIV/AIDS, which poses serious health and\r\ndevelopmental challenges to humankind and which\r\ndisproportionately affects the young, Malaysia\r\nparticipated actively at the Association of Southeast\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) Summit on HIV/AIDS\r\nconvened in Brunei Darussalam in November 2001 in\r\nconjunction with the 7th ASEAN Summit. The\r\nobjective was to give the issue of HIV/AIDS the\r\nhighest priority on the political agenda of the ASEAN\r\ncountries and to make a commitment to cooperate on\r\nintercountry and cross-border issues, as well as to\r\nexchange technical expertise and experiences in order\r\nto address the HIV/AIDS problem. On the home front,\r\nMalaysia continues to give very serious attention to\r\nmeasures to combat HIV/AIDS, though the reported\r\ncases of HIV infection are relatively small compared to\r\nour overall population. The Government has taken a\r\ncomprehensive and integrated approach to dealing with\r\nthis problem, which includes preventive measures,\r\ncare, support and treatment for those infected and\r\naffected by HIV/AIDS. The Government works closely\r\nwith non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in this\r\nregard, in particular the Malaysian AIDS Council\r\n(MAC), an umbrella organization headed by Datin\r\nPaduka Marina Mahathir.\r\nMalaysia’s Vision 2020, which sets out the\r\ndirection for the country’s development and progress\r\nover the next two decades, envisages that every child\r\nborn should be brought up in a healthy environment,\r\nprovided with all necessary protection against diseases,\r\nreceive proper nurturing, care and affection, receive\r\ngeneral and higher education as far as possible, receive\r\nappropriate skills in necessary fields, and be imbued\r\nwith cultural and human values. We are confident that\r\nthe well-being of children and women are reliable\r\nindicators of a healthy society and of good governance.\r\nTherefore, the Malaysian Government will continue to\r\npromote and facilitate the rights of the child, especially\r\nin the areas of protection, development and\r\nparticipation.\r\nMs. Espíndola (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nFirst of all allow me to thank the Secretary-General for\r\nhis report on progress made in follow-up to the\r\ncommitments that appear in the outcome document of\r\nthe twenty-seventh special session of the Assembly\r\nheld in May 2002.\r\nAt that session, the delegations of 190 countries\r\napproved a declaration and a plan of action entitled, “A\r\nWorld Fit for Children”, whereby their Governments\r\nundertook to achieve a set of objectives in a specific\r\ntime frame designed to enhance living conditions for\r\nchildren and young people, with particular attention\r\ngiven to promoting healthy lives; providing quality\r\neducation; protecting children from abuse, exploitation\r\nand violence and combating HIV/AIDS. The special\r\nsession served to empower and motivate each country\r\nwith a view to continuing to pursue actions and\r\nprocesses of change to benefit boys, girls and\r\nadolescents. In that regard, we are gratified to see the\r\nprogress that has been made in achieving the proposed\r\ngoals, as well as the widespread support that those\r\ngoals have received from Governments and\r\ninternational agencies.\r\nAll of us, as countries, need to direct our efforts\r\ntowards meeting basic needs so that children can enjoy\r\nhealthy lives and a prosperous future. In order to\r\nachieve that objective, it is vital for us to make the\r\nshift from words to the execution of plans and projects\r\nso as to create a world that gives them the security and\r\nprotection they need. The limited available resources to\r\nfund programmes intended to care for children and\r\nadolescents; inequalities in social, economic and\r\npolitical conditions; discrimination based on race or\r\ngender; the allocation of funds for arms purchases\r\ninstead of for bolstering children’s programmes; armed\r\nconflicts; lack of housing; the degradation of the global\r\nenvironment; an increase in the incidence of diseases,\r\nincluding those which were thought to have been\r\neradicated; hunger; malnutrition; lack of educational\r\nopportunities and family breakdown — these are\r\npressing problems that require urgent resolution and\r\nrepresent a challenge to the Governments of the world.\r\nEcuador reaffirms its commitment to the\r\nprinciples articulated in the Convention on the Rights\r\nof the Child, the Millennium Development Goals, and\r\nthe targets set at the special session of the General\r\nAssembly in 2002. Pursuant to those mandates and\r\nmindful of the importance of giving priority attention\r\nto young children and infants, Ecuador has effectuated\r\na set of policies intended to protect the rights of\r\nchildren and meet their needs.\r\nMy country has striven hard to increase\r\ninvestment in the social sphere, particularly that\r\nintended to meet the needs of children. However, the\r\ngrave economic crisis occurring in the country and the\r\nburden of external debt, which represents more than 40\r\nper cent of the national budget, have limited the\r\ndevelopment of the Ecuadorian people.\r\nIn the legislative sphere, the political constitution\r\nestablishes a new social and legal status for boy and\r\ngirl children designed to give effect to their rights as\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\ncitizens and affirm the principle of the superior\r\ninterests of the child, which dictates that their rights\r\nshall prevail over those of others. The new code for\r\nchildren and adolescents adopted in Ecuador is the\r\noutcome of a broad-ranging process in which civil\r\nsociety and public and private institutions throughout\r\nthe country took part. That instrument took as its\r\npremise the concept of all rights for all children and is\r\na clear token of the deep national commitment to\r\nmeeting the needs of boy and girl children and\r\nadolescents in Ecuador on a priority and urgent basis.\r\nWe believe that it is time to face up to the\r\nresponsibility of finding the right mechanisms that will\r\nenable us fully to execute the international\r\ncommitments adopted for children. However, the\r\nnecessary social investment is very often undermined\r\nby critical economic conditions, which severely affect\r\nthe most vulnerable social groups and frustrate\r\ndeveloping countries trying to achieve the target of\r\ndevoting at least 20 per cent of their national budgetary\r\nresources to basic social services. Accordingly, we\r\nneed to find ways and means of establishing lasting\r\nexternal solutions to this problem, since without the\r\nvital resources, it will be very difficult to counter the\r\ndeterioration in the quality of life of our children and\r\nadolescents.\r\nMy delegation believes that initiatives such as\r\nthose agreed to in the Millennium Declaration, Agenda\r\n21 and the Monterrey and Johannesburg Summits are\r\nof key importance. Such actions will help to enhance\r\nthe living conditions for the most affected sectors, so\r\nthat children can enjoy an environment that will allow\r\nthem to develop in all respects and to be fully\r\nintegrated into society.\r\nMr. Swe (Myanmar): I wish first of all to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for preparing the second report\r\non the follow-up to the outcome of the special session\r\non children for our deliberation.\r\nIt has been two years since we, the international\r\ncommunity, adopted the Declaration and Plan of\r\nAction and pledged to our children that we would build\r\na world fit for them. We have also set time-bound\r\ngoals, with particular focus on four areas. And today,\r\nfor the second time, we are reviewing those promises\r\nthat we have made to the children of the world.\r\nThe Secretary-General reports that since the\r\nspecial session on children, 25 countries have\r\ncompleted national plans of action for children and\r\nmany more have national plans under formulation.\r\nMany countries have incorporated the goals and\r\ncommitments of “A World Fit for Children” into other\r\nnational policy and planning instruments.\r\nThe set of goals adopted at the special session\r\ncomplements and reinforces the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Like many Member States,\r\nMyanmar is striving to achieve both sets of goals. To\r\nreinforce its efforts to create an environment that\r\nallows children to achieve their full potential,\r\nMyanmar acceded to the Convention on the Rights of\r\nthe Child in 1991, promulgated the Child Law in 1993\r\nand subsequently adopted the rules of the Child Law.\r\nThe Government of Myanmar has also established a\r\nnational programme of action for the promotion,\r\nprotection and development of children.\r\nWe are heartened that three quarters of the\r\nworld’s children receive routine immunizations and\r\nthat this has averted an estimated 2.5 million deaths per\r\nyear. Yet, we are shocked to learn that 1.4 million\r\nchildren under five years of age die annually from\r\nvaccine-preventable diseases. In Myanmar, the\r\nGovernment has successfully carried out immunization\r\nactivities throughout the length and breadth of the\r\ncountry. Full immunization coverage for all infants and\r\npregnant women against tetanus has been achieved\r\nsince 1990, and over 90 per cent of Myanmar’s\r\nchildren under the age of five have been immunized\r\nwith polio vaccine. In February 2003, Myanmar was\r\nable to declare the eradication of polio in the country.\r\nThe Secretary-General reports that the world\r\nremains on track to reach the international target for\r\nsafe drinking water. In Myanmar, in 2000 the\r\nGovernment launched a project to reduce by half the\r\nnumber of people without access to safe drinking water\r\nand sanitation facilities by 2015 and to achieve\r\nuniversal access to safe water and sanitation facilities\r\nby 2025.\r\nThe Secretary-General estimates that globally\r\nthere are from 104 million to more than 120 million\r\nschool children of primary age range. Education is an\r\nessential tool for every child. There is an old Myanmar\r\nproverb that says that education is the pot of gold that\r\nno one can steal. The Government of Myanmar places\r\ngreat importance on providing quality education for all\r\nchildren. In the past six years, 135 tertiary education\r\ninstitutions and more than 400 primary and secondary\r\nschools were established, 90 per cent them in rural\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nareas. The primary school attendance rate was\r\n95 per cent in the 2003-2004 academic year and,\r\naccording to figures collected across the nation for the\r\ncurrent academic year, nearly 100 per cent of school-\r\nage children now attend school.\r\nTo prevent and protect children from sexual\r\nexploitation, abuse and trafficking, the National\r\nCommittee for the Rights of the Child works closely\r\nwith the Myanmar National Committee for Women’s\r\nAffairs, the Myanmar Women’s Affairs Federation, the\r\nCommittee for Trafficking in Persons and national and\r\ninternational non-governmental organizations. As a\r\nState party to the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild, Myanmar has submitted its second periodic\r\nreport to the United Nations Committee on the Rights\r\nof the Child. In its concluding remarks, the Committee\r\nacknowledged that there have been many positive\r\ndevelopments in Myanmar relating to children.\r\nAnother major milestone in Myanmar’s efforts to\r\nprevent and protect children is its accession in March\r\n2004 to the United Nations Convention against\r\nTransnational Organized Crime and all its protocols.\r\nIn many cases, Myanmar has set national\r\nstandards higher than its international obligations. A\r\ncase in point is recruitment into the armed forces.\r\nEnlistment in the Myanmar Armed Forces is voluntary,\r\nand the minimum age for enlisting is 18 years. It is\r\nagainst the law for anyone under the age of 18 to enlist.\r\nTo ensure that no adolescent falls through any\r\nprocedural loophole, a committee for the prevention of\r\nthe military recruitment of underage children was\r\nrecently established and a national plan of action has\r\nbeen put in place.\r\nWe have also been successfully carrying out a\r\nprocess of national reconciliation in Myanmar. As a\r\nfirst step for our transition to democracy, a national\r\nconvention, which has successfully held its first\r\nsession, was able to bring together representatives from\r\nall strata of society, representatives of the various\r\nnational groups of Myanmar and representatives of\r\n17 major armed groups and 17 smaller armed groups.\r\nThose developments will greatly benefit our children\r\nand future generations. A peaceful, stable, democratic\r\nMyanmar is an integral part of the promise we give to\r\nour children.\r\nThe Secretary-General reports that over 2 million\r\nchildren under the age of 15 are infected with the HIV\r\nvirus and that the face of HIV/AIDS is young and\r\nfemale. The report also mentions that where HIV/AIDS\r\nis declining, it is primarily because young people have\r\nlearned to practice safe behaviour. Myanmar places\r\ngreat importance on educating our children. Its school-\r\nbased Healthy Life Skills HIV/AIDS Prevention\r\nEducation project (SHAPE), as part of the national\r\ncurriculum, is taught to primary, middle and high\r\nschool students. Its success has led to the expansion of\r\nSHAPE to SHAPE PLUS, a programme that reaches\r\nout to key groups outside of the formal education\r\nsystem. Myanmar also mobilizes civil society in its\r\nfight against HIV/AIDS. Our national non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and international non-\r\ngovernmental organizations play an integral role in our\r\nfight against HIV/AIDS. We thank them for their\r\nvaluable efforts. Our gratitude also goes to the relevant\r\nUnited Nations agencies for providing us with\r\nimportant and valuable support.\r\nWhile recognizing that the challenges we face to\r\nbuild a world fit for children are indeed daunting, I\r\nconclude by reiterating our strong and firm\r\ncommitment to that cause. We owe it to our future\r\nleaders — our children.\r\nMr. Shiweva (Namibia): My delegation\r\nexpresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for\r\nhis report before the Assembly on the follow-up to the\r\nUnited Nations special session on children, contained\r\nin document A/59/274.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report indicates that\r\noverall global trends show that many countries have\r\ntaken concrete steps to translate the commitments\r\nmade at the special session into national action plans\r\nfor children. That is indeed a very encouraging\r\ndevelopment.\r\nHowever, it is important to point out that\r\ndifferent regions have pursued the follow-up to the\r\nspecial session on children at different speeds. For\r\ninstance, while almost all countries in some regions\r\nhave completed their plans of action for children,\r\nothers, especially in the sub-Saharan region, are still in\r\nthe process of complementing their poverty reduction\r\nplans with specific policies and are developing national\r\naction plans on children. During the major event next\r\nyear, we will once again have the opportunity to take\r\nstock of the progress made in the implementation of\r\nthe commitments made at the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nThe Namibian Government views investing in\r\nchildren as consistent with the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), as most of the MDGs\r\ndirectly affect children’s future. In this connection, my\r\nGovernment adopted the National Programme of\r\nAction on Children in 1991, and made it part and\r\nparcel of the overall socio-economic development\r\nstrategy of the country. Our Government seeks to\r\npromote poverty reduction through stimulating\r\neconomic growth, investing in social sectors and\r\nfunding social safety nets. We maintain a social safety\r\nnet for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, orphans\r\nand persons with disabilities.\r\nThe Namibian Government recognizes that\r\nquality education directly contributes to human\r\ncapacity and productivity. Our Government’s\r\ncommitment to education is reflected in the large\r\namount of financial resources allocated to education\r\nevery year. We spent approximately 25 per cent of the\r\nnational budget on education.\r\nThe Namibian Government has made great\r\nprogress in making education effective, compulsory\r\nand accessible to all. In that connection, we have an\r\nearly childhood policy that encompasses children up to\r\neight years of age, starting with prenatal care for the\r\nmother. This policy was developed to streamline the\r\ndelivery of health, nutrition and educational services in\r\norder to improve children’s survival and ability to\r\nthrive. Furthermore, primary school enrolment rates in\r\nNamibia are higher for girls than for boys.\r\nDespite improvements in access to education, the\r\nschool dropout rate as a result of HIV/AIDS, poverty\r\nand hunger are a cause for concern. The other\r\nchallenge for our Government is the provision of\r\nquality education for our marginalized groups and\r\nthose living under extreme poverty. Access to primary\r\neducation for those groups is limited by various\r\nfactors, including the availability of schools within\r\nreasonable proximity, the required contributions to the\r\nschool development fund and normal costs associated\r\nwith attending schools.\r\nA combination of recurrent droughts, food\r\ninsecurity, the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and\r\npoverty is severely affecting our human development.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS epidemic is considered to be the single\r\ngreatest threat to sustainable human development and\r\nthe effort to meet the MDGs. About one in five\r\npregnant women are infected with HIV and the\r\ndevastating effects are felt everywhere, especially\r\namong our children. The epidemic has already reduced\r\nthe average lifespan of a newborn Namibian by more\r\nthan a decade and has resulted in a growing number of\r\norphans and other vulnerable children.\r\nExtended family networks have always supported\r\norphans and other vulnerable children. However, the\r\nscourge of HIV/AIDS is making it increasingly\r\ndifficult for families to cope with the growing number\r\nof orphans and other vulnerable children. This is\r\nparticularly true in the light of the fact that older\r\npersons are increasingly bearing the responsibility of\r\ncaring for orphans.\r\nThe Namibian Government, in realizing the\r\nimpending problem and wishing to ensure a\r\ncoordinated approach to the growing number of\r\norphans and other vulnerable children, has adopted a\r\nfive-year strategic plan for the period from 2001 to\r\n2006 and the National Policy on orphans and\r\nvulnerable children. These initiatives provide a\r\nframework for protecting and promoting the well-being\r\nof orphans and other vulnerable children.\r\nIn this connection, we wish to encourage all those\r\nStates that have not yet done so to put national\r\nstrategies in place for the protection and care of\r\norphans and vulnerable children. We also concur with\r\nthe Secretary-General that support for orphans and\r\nvulnerable children is reaching only limited numbers of\r\nthese children and there is a great need to expand the\r\nscope of this support to help guide and accelerate\r\nresponse.\r\nIn an effort to reduce child mortality, primary\r\nhealthcare delivery structures have been put in place in\r\nNamibia. These include the following: prevention and\r\nmanagement of diseases such as HIV/AIDS and\r\nmalaria; our Expanded Programme on Immunization;\r\nprogrammes on the control of diarrhoea and diseases\r\nand the control of acute respiratory infections; and the\r\npromotion of nutrition.\r\nAlthough the mortality rate for infants and\r\nchildren under five years old has been reduced by an\r\naverage of 2.5 and 2 per cent annually, it still remains\r\nhigh in rural areas. The main causes for mortality in\r\nchildren are diarrhoea, malaria, pneumonia,\r\nmalnutrition and HIV/AIDS. The rapid spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS undermines the preventive efforts of the\r\nGovernment to reduce diarrhoea and pneumonia-\r\nrelated deaths in children.\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nFinally, our Government is continuously\r\nsearching for innovative and creative approaches aimed\r\nat addressing the problems facing our children and\r\nbuilding on the progress we have already made. Hence,\r\ninternational cooperation is needed to augment these\r\nefforts.\r\nMs. Tincopa (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): The 1989\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child was a milestone\r\nthat required Governments to set priorities for the\r\npromotion and protection of the rights of children and\r\nto invest in their development. That framework was\r\nexpanded by the outcome documents of conferences,\r\nsummits and special sessions held since 1990. The\r\n2002 special session of the General Assembly on\r\nchildren is of particular importance, since it allowed\r\nthe international community to renew its political\r\ncommitment to children and adolescents by\r\nestablishing a set of priorities, including promoting\r\nhealthy lives, providing quality education, protecting\r\nchildren from abuse, exploitation and violence and\r\ncombating HIV/AIDS.\r\nPeru regards the well-being of girls, boys and\r\nadolescents as a key objective of development. In this\r\nregard, we recognize that they possess rights that the\r\nState is obliged to guarantee. As a result, we have a\r\nstrategic agenda of action that gives priority to\r\neradicating poverty and reducing social inequities by\r\nimplementing comprehensive policies and mechanisms\r\ndesigned to guarantee children’s economic, social and\r\npolitical opportunities. This is established in the long-\r\nterm policies of the National Agreement and the\r\nNational Plan to overcome poverty, which gives\r\npriority to the development of human capacities, in\r\nparticular regarding comprehensive protection for\r\nchildren, especially in the first three years of life. This\r\nwas also endorsed in the short-term economic, social\r\nand political commitment of our National Agreement,\r\nwhich calls for healthy lives for children under five\r\nyears old, giving preference to those under three years\r\nold.\r\nIn this regard, Peru has set in motion the National\r\nPlan of Action for Children and Adolescents for the\r\nperiod from 2002 to 2010, a document that was\r\nprepared in consultation with more than 200 State and\r\ncivil society institutions, which sets forth the actions,\r\nprogrammes and strategies that need to be followed in\r\norder to ensure respect for the rights of children and\r\nadolescents throughout their lives.\r\nThat plan is based on two convictions: that equal\r\nopportunity should start with children and adolescents\r\nand that quality of life and the full development of the\r\nindividual are prerequisites for the exercise and\r\napplicability of rights. Thus, the key goal of our Plan\r\nof Action is to achieve structural changes in the\r\nsituation of children and adolescents in Peru, whose\r\nreality continues to be characterized by inequality and\r\nsocial disparities: 66.2 per cent of children under four\r\nyears of age live in poverty, and 22.4 per cent in\r\nextreme poverty.\r\nThose conditions often have a negative impact on\r\nchildren and adolescents, in many cases leading them\r\nto a premature entry into the labour market, where they\r\nface abandonment, economic and sexual exploitation,\r\nunwanted and early pregnancies, drug addiction,\r\nalcoholism and sexually transmitted diseases such as\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nTo confront that harsh reality, the Government of\r\nPeru has made the fight against poverty and the\r\nreduction of social inequality one of its top priorities,\r\nand it has been working to that end in the areas of\r\nhealth, education and participation.\r\nWith respect to health, the Government is\r\nworking to ensure universal access to health care,\r\nincluding the right to free, quality sexual and\r\nreproductive health care on an ongoing basis, with the\r\npriority going to areas of greatest poverty and the most\r\nvulnerable sectors of the population. Special attention\r\nis given to the cases of children and adolescents with\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nThe Government is promoting education as the\r\ncentral element in its fight against poverty, ensuring\r\nuniversal and unrestricted access to comprehensive\r\neducation ranging from the most basic level to\r\nvocational training. That education is free and of good\r\nquality, and it promotes equality, strengthens\r\ndemocratic values and prepares citizens for an active\r\nintegration into social life.\r\nAs to participation, the Government is promoting\r\nthe participation of children and adolescents, making\r\nthem strategic actors in the country’s development.\r\nThat action seeks to counter problems such as youth\r\ngangs and alcohol and drug abuse, among others.\r\nI wish to refer to the difficult situation of\r\nthousands of children in the world who are recruited as\r\nsoldiers, sexually exploited, subject to the worst forms\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.42\r\nof child labour and exposed to abuse, discrimination\r\nand violence. As stated in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/59/274), the Millennium Development\r\nGoals do not explicitly include objectives concerning\r\nthe protection of children. That makes it necessary for\r\nGovernments to treat children as a priority in their\r\nnational planning.\r\nIn that context, Peru calls on the States of the\r\ninternational community and civil society to work\r\ntogether to ensure that children and adolescents have\r\nfull enjoyment of their rights. We note with satisfaction\r\nthat the question of the rights of the child is\r\nincorporated into the work of the relevant United\r\nNations bodies such as UNICEF, the International\r\nLabour Organization and UNESCO, among others.\r\nTo conclude, although Peru has made progress in\r\ncarrying out its commitments on the rights of children\r\nand adolescents, much remains to be done to ensure\r\ntheir full development. Peru reaffirms its commitment\r\nto children and adolescents and will continue working\r\nbecause they constitute the most important human and\r\nsocial element. We have a responsibility and a present\r\nand future obligation to them and to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
