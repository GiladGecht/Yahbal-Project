(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 28\r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/59/302\r\n(Parts I and II))\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.2)\r\nMr. Berruga (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nMexico speaks from this international rostrum to\r\nreaffirm its rejection of the implementation of\r\nunilateral laws or measures imposing economic\r\nblockades against any nation and of the use of coercive\r\nmeasures without the authorization provided for in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. Apart from their\r\nhumanitarian consequences, such measures are\r\ncontrary to international law and ultimately symbolize\r\na gradual abandonment of diplomacy and dialogue as\r\nthe way in which to resolve disputes among States.\r\nAs pointed out recently by the American scholar\r\nRobert Tucker,\r\n“Legitimacy arises from the conviction that\r\nState action proceeds within the ambit of the law,\r\nin two senses: first, that action issues from\r\nrightful authority, that is, from the political\r\ninstitution authorized to take it; and second, that\r\nit does not violate a legal or moral norm”.\r\nMexico agrees with that statement and reiterates that\r\nany kind of political, economical or military sanctions\r\nimposed on States must emanate only from the\r\ndecisions or recommendations of the Security Council\r\nor the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation has rejected the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial blockade imposed\r\nunilaterally against Cuba and has consistently\r\nsupported all General Assembly resolutions regarding\r\nthe need to put an end to it. Mexico is concerned that\r\nthis kind of resolution, submitted to the Assembly year\r\nafter year, is not having the intended transformative\r\neffect on reality. In other words, the majority position\r\nof the international community is being ignored, which\r\nis negatively affecting the purpose and usefulness of\r\nthese exercises. In that way, one of the pillars of\r\nmultilateralism — joint deliberations and the\r\nexpression of State positions through the vote — is\r\nbeing seriously damaged. In the light of the current\r\nspirit of reform in the United Nations system —\r\nreferred to by 141 delegations in the general debate —\r\nthis situation must be addressed as a central concern of\r\nthe international community.\r\nMexico has undertaken measures at the national\r\nlevel and has promoted actions at the regional level to\r\ncounteract the extraterritorial effects of any foreign law\r\nthat affects free trade and that violates international\r\nlaw to the detriment of any State, and we shall continue\r\nto do so. During the current session of the General\r\nAssembly, Mexico will renew for the thirteenth\r\nconsecutive time its support for the draft resolution on\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nlifting the economic blockade imposed by the United\r\nStates against Cuba (A/59/L.2), because unilateral\r\nmeasures affecting State sovereignty and freedom of\r\ntrade run counter to our foreign policy principles and\r\nto the spirit of the Charter.\r\nFor all those reasons, Mexico will once again\r\nvote in favour of the draft resolution.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nFor 12 consecutive years, resolutions have been\r\nadopted in the General Assembly urging all countries\r\nto comply with the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nwith the principles enshrined in the relevant\r\ninternational legal instruments and to repeal or\r\ninvalidate all laws and measures the extraterritorial\r\neffects of which affect the sovereignty of other States,\r\nthe legitimate interests of entities or persons under\r\ntheir jurisdiction and the freedom of trade and\r\nnavigation. Regrettably, the country concerned —\r\nwhich continues to act wilfully, to obstinately maintain\r\nthe wrong position and to ignore the just demands of\r\nthe international community — has failed to implement\r\nthe relevant Assembly resolutions.\r\nThe embargo and the sanctions imposed by the\r\nUnited States against Cuba have continued for more\r\nthan 40 years. The United States has claimed that their\r\npurpose is to enhance democracy, freedom and human\r\nrights in Cuba. But what are the realities?\r\nFirst, by attempting to use embargoes and\r\nsanctions to force another country to give up its\r\nindependently chosen development road — and even to\r\noverthrow the existing Government — the United\r\nStates has gravely violated the purposes and principles\r\nof the United Nations Charter and the basic norms\r\nguiding current international relations. This in itself\r\nhas distorted, mocked and violated the principles of\r\ndemocracy and freedom.\r\nSecondly, the embargo and sanctions of an\r\nextraterritorial nature imposed by the United States\r\nagainst Cuba have violated international law and the\r\nprinciples, objectives and rules of international trade.\r\nThey also run counter to the principles of free trade\r\nadvocated by the United States itself.\r\nThirdly, the embargo and sanctions imposed by\r\nthe United States against Cuba have seriously\r\nobstructed and constrained the Cuban people in their\r\nnation-building efforts to eradicate poverty, improve\r\npeople’s living standard and promote economic and\r\nsocial development. This poses a grave violation of the\r\nfundamental freedoms and human rights of the Cuban\r\npeople, including the right to subsistence and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nFourthly, if the United States and Cuba were to\r\nchange places, and if the United States were under an\r\neconomic, trade and financial embargo imposed by\r\nother countries for many years, how would the United\r\nStates feel? Would the United States still regard those\r\ncountries’ practices as acts aimed at enhancing its own\r\ndemocracy, freedom and human rights?\r\nCurrently, nearly 80 countries have suffered\r\neconomic losses as a result of the embargo and\r\nsanctions imposed by the United States against Cuba.\r\nThe international community is entitled to raise serious\r\nconcerns over such embargoes and sanctions and to\r\ndemand an immediate end to them.\r\nThe Chinese Government, which unwaveringly\r\nadheres to the purposes and principles of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations, advocates sovereign equality of\r\nStates and non-interference in one another’s internal\r\naffairs. We have made vigorous efforts for democracy\r\nand the rule of law in international relations. We firmly\r\nbelieve that countries should choose, according to their\r\nnational conditions, their own political, economic and\r\nsocial systems and development modes. We are of the\r\nview that State-to-State conflicts and disputes should\r\nbe solved through dialogue and cooperation on the\r\nbasis of equality and mutual respect.\r\nFor the aforementioned reasons, the Chinese\r\nGovernment opposes the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargoes and sanctions imposed by the\r\nUnited States against Cuba. We support the Cuban\r\nGovernment and people in their endeavours to\r\nsafeguard national independence and State sovereignty.\r\nWe hope that the United States Government will keep\r\npace with the times, replace confrontation with\r\ndialogue, embargoes and sanctions with\r\ncommunication and exchange, and earnestly implement\r\nthe relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\r\nChina, therefore, supports the draft resolution\r\nsubmitted by Cuba under the current agenda item.\r\nMr. Abdul Wahab Dolah (Malaysia): Malaysia\r\nremains fundamentally opposed to all forms of\r\nunilateral economic, commercial and financial\r\nsanctions and embargoes. Therefore, we once again\r\njoin the rest of the international community in calling\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nfor an immediate end to the embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States on Cuba and its people.\r\nSince its forty-seventh session the General\r\nAssembly has pronounced its rejection of the use of\r\nunilateral measures by one Member State to effect\r\npolitical reform in another, in this case the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States against Cuba. The adoption of resolution\r\n58/7 by the General Assembly on 4 November 2003,\r\nwith 179 Member States voting in favour, has\r\nunambiguously reflected the wishes of an\r\noverwhelming majority of countries to reject the\r\nembargo and to call for it to be immediately\r\nterminated. We are confident that at the current session\r\nthere will again be an overwhelming rejection of those\r\nunilateral measures.\r\nThe application of laws by the United States, in\r\nparticular the Torricelli and Helms-Burton Acts, and\r\nmeasures such as those implemented since June 2004\r\nfollowing the recommendations of the Commission for\r\nAssistance to a Free Cuba are clearly intended to hurt\r\nCuba and the Cuban people, including the most\r\nvulnerable — namely, children, women and the elderly.\r\nThey are also clearly aimed at limiting Cuba’s access\r\nto markets, capital, technology and investment, in\r\norder to exert pressure on Cuba to change its political\r\nand economic system or orientation. We view these as\r\nactions that are not consistent with the universally\r\naccepted principles of international law, the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations, World Trade Organization\r\nprinciples and relevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nThey are discriminatory in nature and undermine the\r\nprinciples of sovereign equality of States, fundamental\r\nhuman rights and the spirit of peaceful coexistence and\r\ngood neighbourliness among States.\r\nThe United States embargo against Cuba is not\r\nonly a violation of international law but, as confirmed\r\nby various reports, violates the right of the people of\r\nCuba to life, to well-being and to development, without\r\nany distinction in respect to age, gender, race, religious\r\nbelief, social situation or political ideology. The\r\nembargo has caused tremendous economic damage and\r\nhas aggravated the plight of the Cuban people, more\r\nthan two thirds of whom have lived all their lives under\r\nthe cloud of the United States unilateral embargo and\r\nsanctions regime.\r\nWe appeal to the United States, a staunch\r\nadvocate of free trade and good relations among\r\nnations, to respect the Charter of the United Nations\r\nand the norms and principles of international law. We\r\ncall on the United States to rethink its overall approach\r\ntowards Cuba and to evolve its policy from one of\r\nisolating its small neighbour to one of dialogue and\r\naccommodation. It is our fervent hope that, in the new\r\nspirit of the times, which promotes dialogue and\r\nunderstanding in a world of increasing interdependence\r\nand globalization, the United States would be able to\r\nevolve its policy on Cuba towards a more realistic\r\norientation and to place its relationship with its\r\nneighbour on a new footing.\r\nTherefore, we urge the United States to end the\r\ncurrent policy and to engage in serious dialogue to\r\nresolve problems with Cuba.\r\nMalaysia maintains excellent relations with both\r\nthe United States and Cuba. Nevertheless, Malaysia\r\nonce again reaffirms its commitment to respect for the\r\nfundamental principles of sovereign equality among\r\nStates, non-interference in their internal affairs and\r\nfreedom of international trade and navigation. We urge\r\nthe international community to continue to exert\r\nserious efforts to bring about an end to the unilateral\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against\r\nCuba.\r\nIn support of the principles of international law,\r\nthe United Nations Charter and the promotion of\r\nfreedom of trade, Malaysia, as in previous years, will\r\nvote in favour of draft resolution A/59/L.2.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): In the discussion of\r\ncoercive economic measures, including extraterritorial\r\nlaws, the Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement in\r\nDurban in August 2004 condemned the use of such\r\nmeasures, with a view to preventing countries from\r\nexercising their right to decide, by their own free will,\r\ntheir own political, economic and social systems. The\r\nMinisters also called on all countries not to recognize\r\nunilateral extraterritorial laws that impose sanctions on\r\nother States and foreign companies.\r\nSouth Africa views the continued imposition of\r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nagainst the Republic of Cuba as a violation of the\r\nprinciples of sovereign equality of States and non-\r\ninterference in the domestic affairs of sovereign States.\r\nThe action by the United States of America\r\nagainst the Republic of Cuba has lasted for almost 45\r\nyears. Yet, that long-standing economic, commercial\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nand financial embargo has been consistently rejected\r\nby a growing number of Member States to the point\r\nwhere the opposition to it has become almost\r\nunanimous. Indeed, I believe that the presence of such\r\na large number of Member States in the Assembly Hall\r\ntoday and their participation in these deliberations are\r\nindications of their opposition to unilateral\r\nextraterritorial measures.\r\nDuring this time, Member States have come to\r\nrecognize the importance of remittances and have\r\naccepted the significant contribution remittances make\r\nto the receiving families in developing countries, as\r\nwell as the role those remittances can play in the\r\npromotion of development in those countries. The\r\nvalue of remittances has thus been hailed in numerous\r\nUnited Nations resolutions, as well as other\r\ndeclarations, including the Monterrey Consensus of the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment.\r\nIn recent months, we have learned more about the\r\nrole that remittances can play in our quest to achieve\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. The potential role\r\nof those transfers from developed to developing\r\ncountries was recently highlighted in two important\r\nreports: first, in September 2004, a report on\r\ninnovative sources of financing for development\r\n(A/59/398, annex) containing a recommendation on\r\nremittances was considered at the summit of world\r\nleaders for Action Against Hunger and Poverty,\r\norganized by President Lula da Silva of Brazil.\r\nSecondly, in his note on innovative sources of\r\nfinancing for development (A/59/272), the Secretary-\r\nGeneral highlighted the issue of remittances as\r\ncontained in a preliminary summary of the soon-to-be\r\nreleased World Institute for Development Economics\r\nResearch study on new sources of development\r\nfinance. There have been several other similar reports\r\nfocusing on the role remittances can play in promotion\r\nof development in developing countries.\r\nSignificantly, at a recent discussion in the Second\r\nCommittee of a draft resolution on the international\r\nfinancial system and development (A/C.2/59/L.2), the\r\nUnited States delegation supported the role that\r\nremittances can play in promoting development. We\r\nwould hope that that view would become widely\r\naccepted within the United States Administration,\r\nwhich has targeted remittances in the most recent\r\ntightening of its embargo against Cuba. By reducing\r\nthe amount of, and placing further restrictions on,\r\nremittances Cuban Americans can send to their\r\nfamilies back home, the United States has transformed\r\nan instrument for development into an instrument of\r\npunishment and coercion.\r\nAt both the thirteenth Summit Conference of\r\nHeads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement (NAM), held in Kuala Lumpur in February\r\n2003, and again at the fourteenth NAM Ministerial\r\nMeeting, held in Durban in August 2004, NAM heads\r\nof State or Government expressed their rejection of\r\nunilateralism, which is increasingly leading to the\r\nerosion and violation of international law, to the use\r\nand threat of use of force and to pressure and coercion\r\nby certain countries as a means to achieve their policy\r\nobjectives. The NAM heads of State or Government\r\nalso expressed their firm opposition to unilateral\r\nmeasures as a means of exerting pressure on\r\ndeveloping countries as such measures are contrary to\r\ninternational law, international humanitarian law, the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and the norms and principles\r\ngoverning peaceful relations among States. They and\r\ntheir ministers stated specifically that the Helms-\r\nBurton Law and the D’Amato-Kennedy Act constitute\r\nflagrant violations of international law.\r\nSouth Africa is a country committed to working\r\ntowards a better world for all, one in which all nations\r\ncoexist peacefully. The achievement of such peaceful\r\ncoexistence requires that all nations adhere to the rule\r\nof law, including international law. The need to respect\r\ninternational law in the conduct of international\r\nrelations has been recognized by most members of this\r\nbody, as has been evidenced by the growing support for\r\nthe draft resolution on this item. In the 13 years that\r\nwe, the Member States of the United Nations, have\r\nbeen considering this item, support has grown steadily,\r\nfrom 59 Member States opposing the United States\r\nembargo on Cuba in 1992 to 179 in 2003.\r\nSouth Africa will again support the draft\r\nresolution before us today (A/59/L.2). We do so\r\nbecause the relentless and unilateral embargo has\r\ncaused untold suffering to the people of Cuba.\r\nConsidering the impact that the embargo has had on the\r\neveryday life of the people of Cuba, it is no surprise to\r\nsee that the overwhelming majority of Member States\r\nare here today to join with everyone else in supporting\r\nthe Cuban people.\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): We associate ourselves with\r\nthe statement that will be made later on by the\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nrepresentative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nIn view of the importance of this issue in relation\r\nto the situation in the Caribbean, I am speaking this\r\nmorning on behalf of the member States of the\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) to reaffirm our\r\nsupport for ending the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba.\r\nThe provisions of the United Nations Charter call\r\nfor respect for the sovereign equality of States, non-\r\ninterference in their internal affairs, the right of\r\npeoples to self-determination, the peaceful settlement\r\nof disputes and the maintenance of friendly relations\r\namong States. CARICOM attaches great importance to\r\nrespect for those principles, which are binding\r\nobligations for Member States. We therefore oppose\r\nthe imposition of unilateral punitive measures,\r\nespecially where they involve the extraterritorial\r\napplication of legislation that violates international law\r\nand restricts freedom of trade and navigation and the\r\nsovereignty and freedom of States. All of that has a\r\nparticular impact on the situation in the Caribbean,\r\nwhere the United States embargo inhibits the\r\ndevelopment of normal economic relations, distorts\r\ntrade and investment flows and impedes business\r\nopportunities among neighbouring States.\r\nFor CARICOM, Cuba is an important partner in\r\nour Caribbean relations and a country with which we\r\nhave well-established programmes of cooperation and\r\nties of friendship. In our view, the Republic of Cuba\r\nthreatens no one. We respect its sovereign rights and\r\nsupport its full integration into our system of\r\nhemispheric relations.\r\nThe embargo imposed against Cuba has gone on\r\nfor far too long and serves no other purpose than to\r\npreserve a state of tension between two neighbouring\r\ncountries, resulting only in the imposition of untold\r\nhardship and suffering on the people of Cuba.\r\nRegrettably, during this year, further measures were\r\nintroduced to tighten the embargo in relation to travel\r\nand financial transactions. It is all the more regrettable\r\nthat those measures are taking effect at a critical time\r\nfor the Cuban people, who have suffered so much from\r\nthe devastation caused by two hurricanes that struck\r\nthe island in recent months. Those disasters have\r\nunderlined the need for regional cooperation and\r\nsolidarity in the face of their economic and\r\nhumanitarian consequences. It also makes it even more\r\nimperative that the punitive measures that are having\r\nsuch detrimental effects on the welfare of the Cuban\r\npeople should be terminated.\r\nCARICOM shares long-established and friendly\r\nrelations with the United States of America, which we\r\ngreatly value. In that spirit, we urge its Government to\r\nrespect the verdict of the international community to\r\nbring an end to the embargo and to engage in\r\nconstructive dialogue and the normalization of\r\nrelations with Cuba. Such a step would remove a\r\nsource of tension and conflict and improve the\r\nprospects for peace, development and cooperation\r\nwithin the Americas.\r\nOur CARICOM delegations support the content\r\nof the draft resolution that is before the General\r\nAssembly and we will vote in support of its adoption.\r\nMr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): The\r\nVietnamese delegation would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his report entitled “Necessity of\r\nending the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America\r\nagainst Cuba”, contained in document A/59/302. We\r\nwarmly welcome the presence of Mr. Felipe Pérez\r\nRoque, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, at this\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly. My delegation\r\nwishes to associate itself with the statement made by\r\nthe delegation of Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nFor nearly half a century, the United States has\r\nbeen carrying out an embargo and blockade measures\r\nagainst its neighbour Cuba. Over the past 13 years,\r\nthose embargo and blockade measures have been\r\nfurther tightened by the promulgation and\r\nimplementation of the Helms-Burton Law and the\r\nTorricelli Act. Considering that situation a serious\r\nviolation of the Charter and the principles of\r\ninternational law, free trade and navigation, the\r\nGeneral Assembly has, over those past 13 years,\r\nadopted consecutive resolutions by overwhelming\r\nmajorities. The most recent such resolution was\r\nresolution 58/7, adopted at its fifty-eighth session with\r\n179 affirmative votes, calling for an end to the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States against Cuba. As reflected in the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General, it is the almost\r\nunanimous view of the international community that\r\nimplementation of extraterritorial legislation such as\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nthe Helms-Burton Law is unacceptable and must be\r\nrejected.\r\nThe economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nimposed by the United States against Cuba has lasted\r\ntoo long. It is indeed the longest embargo in history.\r\nWe cannot agree more with what was said in the\r\nstatement made on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina: this embargo serves no other purpose than to\r\npreserve tension between two neighbouring countries\r\nand impose untold hardship and suffering on the people\r\nof Cuba, especially women and children.\r\nWe note with great concern the report by the\r\nGovernment of Cuba that the direct damages endured\r\nby the Cuban people due to the implementation of the\r\nembargo represent about 2.5 times the gross domestic\r\nproduct of Cuba in 2003. We further express our\r\nconcern that while repeatedly refusing to end the\r\nembargo, as demanded in the 13 Assembly resolutions,\r\nthe United States has incessantly introduced additional\r\nmeasures such as restrictions on travel and the sale of\r\nlife-saving drugs, to mention a few, causing further\r\nhardship and suffering to the Cuban people and\r\nseriously hindering Cuba’s economic, cultural and\r\nsocial development.\r\nAs a nation that has suffered greatly from such\r\nembargoes and blockades, and proceeding from its\r\nfundamental foreign policy of respect for the legitimate\r\nright of each nation to choose its own social and\r\npolitical system and its own path of development, Viet\r\nNam opposes any unilateral embargo and blockade\r\nimposed by one State on any other. We have supported\r\nall the 13 Assembly resolutions demanding that the\r\nUnited States end its economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba. We are ready to\r\nsupport the draft resolution of the same nature\r\ncontained in document A/59/L.2. We hold that the\r\nUnited Nations should undertake early and concrete\r\nmeasures and initiatives to ensure the implementation\r\nof all the resolutions adopted. We wish to reaffirm our\r\nview that the differences between the United States and\r\nCuba, two neighbouring countries, should be resolved\r\nthrough dialogue and negotiations in a spirit of respect\r\nfor each other’s independence and sovereignty.\r\nWe would once again like to extend to the people\r\nof Cuba our sentiments of sincere friendship and\r\nsolidarity and our commitment to join other friendly\r\nnations in assisting them to overcome the hardship and\r\nsuffering resulting from this unjust embargo.\r\nMr. Kittikhoun (Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic) (spoke in French): It has been more than\r\nfour decades since the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial blockade was first imposed on the Republic\r\nof Cuba by the Government of the United States of\r\nAmerica. We profoundly regret the fact that this\r\nblockade continues to engender tensions in the\r\nrelations between the two neighbouring countries. In\r\nour opinion, it is time that those two countries enter\r\ninto serious negotiations aimed at finding a mutually\r\nacceptable solution as early as possible.\r\nIn today’s world of multifaceted cooperation\r\namong States, it is obvious that unilateral and\r\ndiscriminatory trade practices are unjustified. In fact,\r\nthe extraterritorial application of a country’s domestic\r\nlaws clearly runs counter to the principles and\r\nobjectives of the Charter of the United Nations. Under\r\nthe relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, a\r\nState Member must not promulgate or implement laws,\r\nregulations or measures whose extraterritorial effects\r\nwould affect the sovereignty of other States Members\r\nor freedom of trade.\r\nThe sovereign right of every nation to participate\r\nfreely in the international financial and trade systems is\r\nsacred. No country has the right to interfere in the\r\ninternal affairs of other countries, notwithstanding their\r\ndifferent social and political systems. As a sovereign\r\nand independent nation, the Republic of Cuba has the\r\nright to choose its own political system and model of\r\ndevelopment. So that it can reduce poverty and achieve\r\nsustainable development, Cuba must have the\r\nopportunity to maintain and promote trade relations\r\nwith all countries throughout the world. The\r\ninternational community has the duty to provide\r\nassistance and support to Cuba and its heroic people in\r\ntheir vigorous efforts to promote their economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic, together\r\nwith the overwhelming majority of Member States,\r\nwill continue to work to put an end to the economic,\r\nfinancial and commercial embargo against Cuba. That\r\npolicy — which is completely obsolete and contrary to\r\ninternational law — has not benefited either party thus\r\nfar. The Republic of Cuba is a Member of the United\r\nNations, and, as Members ourselves, we must do\r\neverything possible to help that country recover its\r\nlegitimate right to be integrated into the globalized\r\nworld economy.\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nIt is in that spirit that my Government will vote in\r\nfavour of the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/59/L.2.\r\nMr. Ismail (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): On the eve\r\nof its sixtieth anniversary, the United Nations continues\r\nto advocate multilateralism, respect for the collective\r\nwill of nations and implementation of decisions\r\nadopted by the international community. Rejection of\r\nthe unilateral measures imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba is essential, particularly at this\r\ntime.\r\nThe international community has been engaged in\r\na long process of promoting respect for the principles\r\nof the Charter, for the spirit and values of fraternity,\r\njustice, equality, cooperation among States and for\r\nconsolidation of States’ respect for the choices of\r\npeoples. That process has left its mark on our societies\r\nin its early historical phases by entrenching the rule of\r\nlaw and achieving social and political justice. Those\r\nare the parameters that enable us to assess a society’s\r\nrespect for common rights, freedom of choice of\r\nothers, legality and social justice — rights guaranteed\r\nto everyone under international law.\r\nFor 13 consecutive years, the item entitled\r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba” has remained on the agenda of\r\nthe General Assembly. The words “necessity of\r\nending” undoubtedly have legal weight; they firmly\r\nreflect unanimity and the collective will of Member\r\nStates. The General Assembly, by adopting the draft\r\nresolutions submitted under this item during that\r\nperiod, has constantly reaffirmed the right of peoples to\r\nself-determination. It has called upon all Member\r\nStates not to implement or accept unilateral measures\r\nor decisions by one State that contradict the Charter\r\nand the principles of good-neighbourliness and that by\r\nnecessity have extraterritorial effects.\r\nThe number of relevant resolutions adopted by\r\nthe Assembly and the broad support enjoyed by\r\nfriendly Cuba are the best proof that the Cuban\r\nquestion is just. The fact that 173 States voted in\r\nfavour of this draft resolution on behalf of Cuba during\r\nthe Assembly’s previous session demonstrated that the\r\ninternational community is becoming increasingly\r\naware of the dangers involved in the imposition of such\r\nsanctions against a Member State without a legal basis.\r\nCuba has demonstrated that it is an active\r\nmember of the international community. It continues to\r\nparticipate in various forums through multilateralism,\r\nchosen by everyone to resolve problems and to\r\novercome differences and obstacles.\r\nMy country still suffers from the effects of the\r\nunilateral economic sanctions that were also imposed\r\nby the United States in November 1997 and that were\r\nrenewed every year. It is regrettable that a great Power\r\nhas resorted to such unilateral and legally unjustified\r\nmeasures, whose only objective is to apply political\r\npressure on the Government of the Sudan, in flagrant\r\nviolation of the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe Sudan rejects, as a matter of established\r\nprinciple, the commercial, financial and economic\r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America\r\nagainst Cuba, and we will vote in favour of the draft\r\nresolution submitted by Cuba and entitled “Necessity\r\nof ending the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America\r\nagainst Cuba”. We urge all States to vote in favour of\r\nthe draft resolution to express strongly their rejection\r\nof such unilateral measures and decisions, which run\r\ncounter to international law and the Charter.\r\nMr. Mahiga (United Republic of Tanzania): It\r\nhas been 13 years since this agenda item first came\r\nbefore the Assembly for deliberation. I would like to\r\njoin previous speakers in reaffirming my delegation’s\r\nsupport for the draft resolution on the necessity of\r\nending the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America\r\nagainst Cuba (A/59/L.2) — an embargo which has\r\nlasted for 40 years. Our principled position is based on\r\ninternational law and is an expression of our solidarity\r\nwith the people of Cuba, who have been the main\r\nvictims of the embargo.\r\nTanzania firmly believes that the imposition of\r\nthe embargo against Cuba more than four decades ago\r\nis a serious violation not only of the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the Charter and international law, but also\r\nof the freedom of international trade. The situation was\r\nmade worse by the passing in 1991 of the Torricelli Act\r\nand in 1996 of the Helms-Burton Law, each of which\r\nwas intended to completely isolate Cuba from\r\ninternational trade and to cripple its economy, with\r\nsevere consequences for the daily lives of people of all\r\nages.\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nIn addition to breaching the sovereignty of third-\r\nparty States, as well as international law, the\r\nextraterritorial aspect of the embargo, as\r\ninstitutionalized by the Torricelli and Helms-Burton\r\nlegislation, has exacerbated the devastating damage\r\nalready done to the economy of Cuba over the past 10\r\nyears by disrupting trade relations between Cuba and\r\nthird-party nations. The embargo has seriously affected\r\nCuba’s economic and social sectors. It is estimated that\r\nas a direct result of the embargo over the past 45 years,\r\nCuba has suffered a staggering loss of more than $79\r\nbillion.\r\nIt is very encouraging and praiseworthy to note\r\nthat despite all those odds, and the fact that it has been\r\nworking under very difficult conditions, Cuba has\r\nmanaged to develop a world-class health and\r\neducational system, which it has generously shared\r\nwith other developing countries. Tanzania has not only\r\nbenefited from excellent training opportunities in\r\nvarious fields provided by Cuba, but has also, on a\r\ncontinuous basis, received advanced expertise in the\r\nfields of medicine. In addition to regular teams of\r\ndoctors, Tanzania has received from Cuba this year a\r\nconsiderable number of doctors who will specifically\r\nprovide much-needed services in hospitals in the rural\r\nareas of my country.\r\nThese world-class accomplishments in the social\r\nfield, achieved in the face of the persistent embargo,\r\nhave been made at costly sacrifice and are a\r\nremarkable demonstration of courage and fortitude by\r\nCuba. It is abundantly evident that Cuba’s\r\nachievements in health and education, as well as its\r\nprogress in other sectors of the economy and human\r\nendeavour, would have been greater if there had been\r\nno embargo, and Cuba would have been a more\r\nprosperous nation.\r\nAt a time when the international community is\r\nrallying around the Millennium Declaration and\r\nendeavouring to achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, Cuba has admirably accomplished most of those\r\nGoals. It has gone further and demonstrated its\r\nwillingness to share its experiences with others. Cuba,\r\ntoo, should be entitled to economic development and\r\nprosperity. Justice, human prosperity and human rights\r\nshould remain indivisible and should be enjoyed\r\nunconditionally by all.\r\nTanzania believes that it is within the realm of\r\npolitical possibility to find a way to lift the embargo\r\nand that international opportunities are available to that\r\nend, including through the United Nations.\r\nWe appeal to all States to refrain from applying\r\nlaws, and measures — and to lift any such existing\r\nlaws — that infringe on Cuba’s freedom of trade and\r\nnavigation, in accordance with the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I would\r\nlike to thank you, Mr. President, for giving me this\r\nopportunity to speak on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina on the agenda item entitled “The necessity of\r\nending the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America\r\nagainst Cuba”. The Group of 77 and China attaches\r\ngreat importance to this issue, as it concerns the\r\nimposition of extraterritorial measures that impinge on\r\nnational sovereignty, thereby undermining the\r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter and international\r\nlaw, while also severely curtailing freedom of trade and\r\ninvestment.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China calls for an\r\nimmediate end to the embargo. Such appeals were\r\nmade at the Havana South Summit. They have also\r\nbeen made in other Group of 77 declarations, as well as\r\nin the relevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nWe note with appreciation the positive support of\r\nthe majority of the membership of the United Nations\r\non this issue. We therefore support the appeal made by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his report (A/59/302) for an\r\nend to the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo. In this context, the Group of 77 and China\r\nwould like to reiterate the call made at the South\r\nSummit with regard to the following points.\r\nFirst, the developed countries must eliminate\r\nlaws and regulations that have adverse extraterritorial\r\neffects, as well as other unilateral economic coercive\r\nmeasures, because they are inconsistent with the\r\nprinciples of international law and of the Charter, as\r\nwell as with the principles of the multilateral trading\r\nsystem.\r\nSecondly, the South Summit has expressed its\r\nconcern about the impact of economic sanctions on the\r\ncivilian population and development capacities in the\r\ntargeted countries. The Group of 77 and China\r\ntherefore urges the international community to exhaust\r\nall peaceful methods before resorting to sanctions,\r\nwhich should be considered only as a last resort.\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nIf necessary, such sanctions should be established\r\nonly in strict conformity with the Charter, with clear\r\nobjectives and a clear time frame being set out and\r\nwith provision made for regular review. Precise\r\nconditions for their lifting should also be established,\r\nand they should never be used as a form of punishment\r\nor retribution.\r\nThe Group of 77 would like to recall the\r\nSummit’s sincere appeal to the United States\r\nGovernment to immediately lift the economic embargo\r\nthat has been imposed on the Republic of Cuba since\r\n1960. This embargo has lasted too long and serves no\r\nother purpose than that of maintaining tension between\r\ntwo neighbouring countries and imposing untold\r\nhardship and suffering on the Cuban people, especially\r\nwomen and children.\r\nFifthly, the G-77 is convinced that the\r\nreplacement of the embargo with better dialogue and\r\ncooperation will greatly contribute not only to the\r\nremoval of tension but also to the promotion of\r\nmeaningful exchange and partnership between two\r\ncountries whose destinies are linked by history and\r\ngeography.\r\nAs in the past, the G-77 and China will support\r\nthe draft resolution before us, and we urge all Member\r\nStates to join us in supporting it.\r\nMr. Musambachime (Zambia): Mr. President,\r\nallow me to take this opportunity to congratulate you\r\nand the other members of the Bureau for the able\r\nmanner in which you are presiding over this session. It\r\nis a source of great pride and honour for us to see you,\r\nMr. President, a distinguished son of Gabon, a brother\r\nnation to Zambia, doing such a commendable job.\r\nI have taken the floor to register my country’s\r\nappreciation of the report of the Secretary-General\r\ncontained in document A/59/302 entitled “Necessity of\r\nending the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America\r\nagainst Cuba”, which in many ways expresses the\r\nviews of the international community on the matter.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with and fully\r\nendorses the statement just given by the representative\r\nof Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nHowever, I wish to make a few observations on behalf\r\nof my country.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, it is now more than\r\nfour decades that the people of Cuba have been living\r\nunder the economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nimposed by the United States. During this period, this\r\nAssembly has adopted resolutions calling for its lifting,\r\nunderscoring the humanitarian consequences of the\r\nembargo on the people of Cuba.\r\nMy delegation has voted in support of all\r\nprevious resolutions on this item in order to underscore\r\nour respect for the provisions of international law, as\r\ncontained in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nAccordingly, my delegation will vote again in favour\r\nof draft resolution A/59/L.2, to be adopted on this item.\r\nWe appeal to other delegations to support this draft\r\nresolution.\r\nThe world has changed since 1959. Just as there\r\nis a need to align with the changed circumstances in\r\ninternational relations since then, it is necessary to\r\nreview the effectiveness of embargoes and sanctions.\r\nMy delegation feels that the embargo imposed on Cuba\r\nis a breach of international law and a violation of the\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter. In this regard,\r\nmy delegation finds the extra-territorial reach of the\r\nHelms-Burton and Torricelli Acts unacceptable. These\r\nActs infringe upon the sovereignty of other States and\r\nimpede international navigation and free trade as\r\nembodied in the provisions of the World Trade\r\nOrganization.\r\nMy delegation wishes to appeal to all United\r\nNations Member States to support the noble principles\r\nthat are enshrined in the Charter by voting\r\nunanimously for the immediate lifting of the embargo.\r\nGiven the importance of lifting this embargo, my\r\ndelegation supports the inclusion of this item in the\r\nagenda of the sixtieth session of the Assembly in order\r\nto allow the international community to be seized with\r\nthe issue until it is finally resolved.\r\nMr. Garza (United States of America) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The United States trade embargo on Cuba is\r\na bilateral issue that should not come before the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe aim of the draft resolution is to blame the\r\nUnited States for the communist regime’s failed\r\neconomic policies and to divert attention from its\r\nhuman rights record. Arguments to the effect that the\r\nUnited States is denying Cuba access to food and\r\nmedicine are baseless. Since 1992, the United States\r\nhas licensed over $1 billion in sales and donations of\r\nmedicine and medical equipment, with 80 per cent of\r\nthat figure in the form of donations. Moreover, since\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\n2001, the United States Government has licensed the\r\nexport of over $5 billion worth of agricultural\r\ncommodities. In that same period, over $700 million in\r\nagricultural products have actually been exported to\r\nCuba.\r\nLet us not forget that the United States is the\r\nsingle largest source of humanitarian assistance to\r\nCuba. Remittances from people in the United States to\r\nCuba have been estimated at close to $1 billion\r\nannually. It is also manifestly true that Cuba can, and\r\ndoes, in fact buy everything it needs — an estimated\r\n$4.3 billion in imports yearly — from nations other\r\nthan the United States.\r\nLet there be no doubt. If Cubans are jobless, if\r\nthey are hungry or lack medical care — as the regime\r\nadmits — it is owing to the failings of the current\r\nGovernment. The Government has shown no interest\r\nwhatsoever in implementing any economic or political\r\nreform that would lead to democratic change and a\r\nfree-market economy. A case in point: as of 1 October,\r\nthe Cuban Government is no longer issuing new\r\nlicenses for 40 different categories of self-employment.\r\nThat means that the Government will no longer allow a\r\nperson to run a small restaurant out of his or her home\r\nor even to perform as a clown at a children’s party.\r\nThat is absurd. Recently, the regime imposed\r\nconfiscatory penalties on the use of dollars in Cuba,\r\nreversing a decade-old policy. That kind of economic\r\nmismanagement is the reason why a country that 45\r\nyears ago had a per capita income equal to that of\r\nSpain is now one of Latin America’s most\r\neconomically desperate countries.\r\nThe Cuban Government is not a victim as it\r\ncontends, rather it is a tyrant, aggressively punishing\r\nanyone who dares to have a differing opinion. Castro\r\nhas steadfastly refused to allow any kind of political\r\nopening and continues to deny Cubans the human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms set forth in the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nIn March 2002, 75 members of the opposition,\r\nincluding independent journalists, economists, trade\r\nunionists and human rights advocates, were sentenced\r\nto an average of 20 years in prison. Such measures\r\nwere brutal even by the Cuban regime’s customary\r\nstandards. The regime continues to harass even those\r\nwho have been released, subjecting them almost daily\r\nto hours-long interrogations. For nearly two years,\r\nCuba has defied the very notion of respecting the will\r\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights by\r\nrefusing to permit a visit by his personal\r\nrepresentative.\r\nAs in the past, the Cuban Government will once\r\nagain portray support for this draft resolution as\r\nsupport for its repressive policies. We, for one, cannot\r\nsupport an economic opening with a country with such\r\nan abysmal record on economic and political issues.\r\nWe will be voting against this draft resolution and we\r\nurge all delegations to do the same.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Before I give\r\nthe floor to the next speaker, I should like to propose\r\nthat we now close the list of speakers for the debate on\r\nthis item.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Kwaw Win (Myanmar): I am taking the\r\nfloor to express our deep concern on the continuation\r\nof the embargo imposed against Cuba by the United\r\nStates. In that regard, my delegation also wishes to\r\nassociate itself with the statement made by Qatar on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nBoth as a matter of principle and in our capacity\r\nas a country affected by unilateral sanctions imposed\r\nby the United States of America, Myanmar fully\r\nsympathizes with the Cuban people and understands\r\nthe extent of the hardship and suffering caused by the\r\nembargo on the people of Cuba, particularly women\r\nand children. The will of the international community\r\nis clearly expressed every year through the adoption,\r\nwith overwhelming majorities, of the resolution calling\r\nfor an end to the embargo. Regrettably, the United\r\nStates Administration has not responded to that call,\r\nbut has even tightened measures against Cuba.\r\nMyanmar shares the view that the embargo does\r\nnot serve any purpose. It does not benefit either of\r\nthose countries or peoples. It jeopardizes the\r\ndevelopment efforts of Cuba. It denies the Cuban\r\npeople the right to food, the right to development and\r\nthe right to free trade and shipping. It prevents cultural\r\nand social exchanges and interaction between people in\r\nCuba and the United States. It limits the ability of the\r\nprivate sector to engage in mutually beneficial\r\ntransactions.\r\nAs a principled member of the international\r\ncommunity, Myanmar fully subscribes to the purposes\r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations, in\r\nparticular the principles of non-interference in the\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\ninternal affairs of another country and the sovereign\r\nequality of nations. My delegation also firmly believes\r\nthat it is the inalienable right of all States to choose\r\ntheir own political and economic systems based on the\r\nwishes of the people. We strongly hold the view that\r\nthe embargo against Cuba by the United States not only\r\ncontravenes the provisions of the United Nations\r\nCharter, but also is contrary to international law. My\r\ndelegation finds particularly objectionable those\r\nextraterritorial measures that infringe on the sovereign\r\nrights of other States.\r\nIn a globalized world, it is counterproductive to\r\nset artificial barriers between countries. It is not\r\nconducive to achieving better understanding among\r\npeoples of the world. Myanmar firmly believes that\r\nonly through dialogue and cooperation can countries\r\nnurture good neighbourly relations, ensure peace and\r\nstability, and promote common interests.\r\nMy delegation therefore reiterates its call for the\r\nimmediate end of the embargo by the United States\r\nagainst Cuba. As a country that has consistently\r\nsupported the draft resolution calling for the end of the\r\nembargo imposed by the United States against Cuba,\r\nmy delegation will vote again this year in favour of\r\ndraft resolution A/59/L.2.\r\nMr. Toro Jimenéz (Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): First of all I wish to\r\nconvey a cordial and warm greeting to the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Cuba, who is\r\npresent today — both on my own behalf and on the\r\nbehalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\r\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has firmly\r\nand repeatedly rejected the promulgation and\r\napplication of laws and regulatory arrangements with\r\nextraterritorial effects, which amount to a disregard for\r\nthe sovereignty of other States.\r\nThe blockade imposed on Cuba, which is\r\ncoercive and extraterritorial in nature, constitutes a\r\nunilateral act of force that contravenes the international\r\nlegal regime that governs economic and trade\r\nexchanges among countries.\r\nCommander Che Guevara, speaking at the\r\nGeneral Assembly in 1964, denounced the political\r\ncharacter of the imperialist domination of the blockade\r\nand its intensification through measures imposed by\r\nthe United States Department of Commerce that totally\r\nprohibited the sale of medicine and food to Cuba. With\r\nrespect to that, Che Guevara said that insofar as Cuba\r\nwas concerned, the United States of America had not\r\nimplemented the explicit recommendations of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development,\r\nheld that very year in Geneva, and had also recently\r\nprohibited the sale of medicines to Cuba. By doing so,\r\nit had divested itself, once and for all, of the mask of\r\nhumanitarianism with which it attempted to disguise\r\nthe aggressive nature of its blockade against the people\r\nof Cuba.\r\nThose words, pronounced by Commander Che\r\nGuevara, are a tangible demonstration of the\r\nimperialist nature of the blockade. The purpose has\r\nbeen to isolate, suffocate and immobilize Cuba, with\r\nthe impossible hope of bringing this heroic people to\r\ntheir knees and inducing them to give up their resolve\r\nto be sovereign and independent and to determine the\r\ncourse of their own history. From that date onward, the\r\nembargo has been intensified, broadened and deepened\r\nby means of legal instruments that seek to apply to all\r\nnations of the world that maintain commercial relations\r\nwith Cuba.\r\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union and Eastern\r\nEurope was used by right-wing sectors in the United\r\nStates to promote those legal instruments. The\r\nTorricelli Act, adopted by the United States Congress\r\nand signed by former President George Bush on\r\n23 October 1992, and the Helms-Burton Act adopted\r\non 12 March 1996 and signed by former President\r\nWilliam J. Clinton — also known as the Cuban Liberty\r\nand Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, or the Libertad\r\nAct — were yet further steps by the United States\r\ntowards building a universal empire based in\r\nWashington.\r\nSenator Torricelli himself said this shamelessly in\r\nparagraph six of section two of his draft law, where he\r\nsaid that the collapse of communism in the former\r\nSoviet Union and Eastern Europe allowed the United\r\nStates and the democratic community an unprecedented\r\nopportunity to promote a peaceful transition towards\r\ndemocracy in Cuba. That draft law had an introduction\r\nthat explained the political purpose of the law: to\r\npromote a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba by\r\nmeans of applying appropriate pressure on the Cuban\r\nGovernment and support for the Cuban people.\r\nAt the same time, the United States was\r\nintensifying the development of new weapons and the\r\ndeployment of troops around the world, trying to\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nimpose military rule and a global empire aimed at\r\nsubjecting all countries to the same conduct and the\r\nsame political and ideological thinking.\r\nThe attempt to crush the valiant and resolved\r\nCuban people through this kind of aggression has only\r\nled to an increase in the Cuban people’s awareness and\r\nhas consolidated their revolution. This is the real result\r\nof the blockade. Moreover, the international\r\ncommunity has understood this, and, within this\r\ninternational forum, has voted overwhelmingly in\r\nfavour of resolutions in support of this reality,\r\nbeginning in 1991. The votes in favour of the\r\nresolution increased in 2003 to 179.\r\nIn spite of this, the United States Government,\r\nbehind the international community’s back, instead of\r\nsuspending the blockade, has intensified it with other\r\nmeasures that now directly undermine family relations\r\nby restricting travel to Cuba by American and Cuban\r\ncitizens residing in the United States. Those further\r\nmeasures contravene human rights on a global level.\r\nThe health system, one of the pillars of the Cuban\r\nrevolution, has been subjected to blockade through\r\nillicit trading practices, preventing the sale by private\r\ncompanies of the technology necessary to maintain in\r\nworking order the instruments for the diagnosis and\r\ntreatment of patients. The same unlawful practices\r\nhave been applied in education, sport and culture.\r\nMy delegation, in solidarity with the Government\r\nand people of Cuba, reaffirms its position of rejecting\r\nthe promulgation and application of any kind of law or\r\nregulation with extraterritorial effects that infringe on\r\nthe sovereignty of other States. Since this situation has\r\nnot come to an end, we will vote in favour of the draft\r\nresolution that has been submitted for the consideration\r\nof this Assembly.\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I would like to begin by associating myself\r\nwith the statement delivered by the delegation of Qatar\r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter underscore the right of States to\r\nexercise their sovereignty over their own territory and\r\nestablish the need for non-interference in their internal\r\naffairs. All United Nations Member States, especially\r\nthe major Powers, are expected to respect the Charter,\r\nwhich is the constitution of this Organization and its\r\nprincipal frame of reference.\r\nThe embargo imposed on Cuba for over four\r\ndecades has subjected the country to all forms of\r\neconomic and social losses. It has entrenched the\r\nsuffering of the Cuban people, especially children and\r\nthe elderly. The embargo has also affected the Cuban\r\npeople’s intensive efforts to achieve well-being and\r\nprosperity.\r\nMy delegation commends Cuba’s continued\r\nefforts to conduct a constructive dialogue with the\r\nUnited States in order to settle all issues of dispute\r\nbetween the two countries on the basis of equality and\r\nsovereignty, mutual respect, non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of States and respect for the principles\r\nand purposes of the United Nations Charter, as well as\r\nprinciples of good neighbourliness. My delegation\r\nbelieves that the normalization of ties between the\r\nUnited States and Cuba is in the interest of the peoples\r\nof the two countries. We underscore the peoples’ right\r\nto select their political, economic, social and cultural\r\nsystems of their own free will and in accordance with\r\ninternational law. The increasing support of the\r\ninternational community for an end to this embargo on\r\nCuba is an affirmation of the need to respect the\r\npolitical, economic and social systems that every\r\ncountry selects of its own will and in light of its own\r\nnational interests.\r\nIn that regard, we would like to recall the final\r\ndocument of the Conference of Heads of State or\r\nGovernment of the Non-Aligned Movement held in\r\nKuala Lumpur, in which the participants again called\r\nupon the United States to end the trade, economic and\r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba. They also expressed\r\nconcern over the widening of the extraterritorial nature\r\nof the embargo on Cuba and the continuous new\r\nlegislative measures geared to intensifying it.\r\nWe would also like to note the declaration\r\nadopted by developing countries at the Group of 77\r\nand China South Summit, held in Havana in 2000, in\r\nwhich the participants categorically rejected laws and\r\nregulations with extraterritorial impact and all other\r\nforms of coercive economic measures.\r\nThe Summit expressed grave concerns about the\r\nimpact of economic sanctions on the development\r\ncapabilities of the countries targeted. It made a special\r\nappeal in the name of all the leaders of the developing\r\ncountries for the immediate lifting of the embargo. The\r\ninternational community has often expressed its\r\nrejection of the sanctions that have been unilaterally\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nimposed on Cuba and of their extension by the so-\r\ncalled Helms-Burton Act of the United States. That Act\r\nextends the jurisdiction of national legislation and\r\nencroaches on the sovereignty of other States that deal\r\nwith Cuba. That is incompatible with the principles of\r\nthe sovereign equality of States and of international\r\nlaw.\r\nExperience has shown that, for the most part,\r\nsanctions regimes have caused enormous material\r\ndamage and major economic loss for the civilian\r\ninhabitants of the countries targeted. In this regard, my\r\ndelegation hopes that all forms of the embargo imposed\r\nby the United States against Cuba will be lifted and\r\nthat the international community’s appeals, as\r\nexpressed by the General Assembly and others, will be\r\nadequately responded to by the United States. On that\r\nbasis, Syria will vote in favour of the draft resolution.\r\nMr. Moleko (Lesotho): Lesotho fully associates\r\nitself with and endorses the statement by the\r\nPermanent Representative of Qatar on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nOver the past 12 years, the Assembly has\r\noverwhelmingly supported the draft resolution entitled\r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba”. The support that has been\r\nexpressed by Member States in their statements during\r\nthis meeting of the Assembly truly reflects the fact that\r\nthe unilateral embargo and new measures aimed at\r\ntightening the blockade imposed by the United States\r\nof America against Cuba are contrary to the principles\r\nof international law, including those enshrined in the\r\nCharter, particularly the principles of the sovereign\r\nequality of States, non-intervention and non-\r\ninterference in their internal affairs and freedom of\r\ninternational trade and navigation.\r\nIn my delegation’s view, it is the sovereign right\r\nof the people of any country, including Cuba, to\r\ndetermine the system of government and the model of\r\ndevelopment most appropriate for their country. It is\r\nvery unfortunate that, in order to exercise that right,\r\nmillions of people in Cuba have to endure untold\r\nmisery caused by the economic blockade.\r\nMy delegation regards all coercive measures,\r\nwhether economic, political or otherwise, by one State\r\nagainst another, as dangerous and thus inadmissible.\r\nSuch measures can never enhance, but only\r\ncompromise, peace, security and stability. The\r\nGovernment of Lesotho therefore strongly opposes the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America against Cuba and\r\nurges the lifting of the economic blockade. We will\r\nvote in favour of draft resolution A/59/L.2.\r\nMr. Jenie (Indonesia): The General Assembly\r\nonce again finds itself addressing the issue of the\r\nnecessity of ending the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba. In this regard, Indonesia wishes\r\nto associate itself with the statement made by the\r\nPermanent Representative of Qatar on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nThe embargo and sanctions imposed against Cuba\r\nhave been in effect for more than 40 consecutive years.\r\nIt is regrettable, therefore, to note that 12 years after\r\nthe General Assembly adopted resolution 47/19, no\r\nsignificant measures have been taken towards lifting\r\nthe embargo.\r\nIt is a matter of principle that Indonesia has\r\nconsistently expressed its opposition to the\r\npromulgation and application by one Member State of\r\nlaws and measures whose extraterritorial effects\r\nimpinge on the sovereignty of other Member States.\r\nThese measures are contrary to the provisions of the\r\nCharter, which embodies the spirit of multilateralism.\r\nIndonesia recognizes the principles of the\r\nsovereign equality of States, non-intervention and non-\r\ninterference in their internal affairs and freedom of\r\ninternational trade and navigation as the underpinnings\r\nof multilateralism. These principles are enshrined in\r\nmany international legal instruments, none of which is\r\nbeing upheld or advanced by the embargo imposed\r\nunilaterally on Cuba.\r\nAfter four decades, we are facing an unwanted\r\nstalemate, despite the increasing opposition to the\r\nembargo. The fact of the matter is that the embargo\r\ndoes more harm than good. The embargo serves little\r\npurpose; it merely perpetuates a lose-lose situation.\r\nWhat the embargo amounts to is economic\r\nwarfare that causes considerable collateral damage. It\r\nharms economically those whom it is intended to\r\nbenefit politically. The people of Cuba are its main\r\nvictims. Innocent of all political charges, their futures\r\nand human rights are nevertheless being sacrificed.\r\nIndeed, they are being unjustifiably victimized by the\r\nembargo on a daily basis.\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nIt is also true that in this age of increasing\r\ninterdependence, globalization and universal\r\nacceptance of the Millennium Declaration, with its\r\ngoal of global partnership for development, the\r\nembargo lacks a legitimate frame of reference. In this\r\nregard, we join with those who have spoken in support\r\nof the need to bring to an end the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed against\r\nCuba.\r\nIn strong support of the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter and of international law, including the\r\nfreedom of international trade and navigation,\r\nIndonesia will again vote in favour of the draft\r\nresolution.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): I should like at the\r\noutset to associate myself with the statement made by\r\nthe representative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China.\r\nThe international community is still witnessing\r\nthe continuous suffering of the people of Cuba as a\r\nresult of the unjust economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed on them by the United\r\nStates Government. That unilateral blockade continues\r\ndespite repeated calls by the Assembly to bring it to an\r\nend. What is even more worrying is the fact that the\r\nblockade has been further strengthened under the\r\ncurrent United States administration, notwithstanding\r\nthe negative effects and human suffering experienced\r\nby the people of Cuba, particularly women, children\r\nand the elderly. Instead of promoting good relations\r\nwith its neighbour, the United States Government\r\ncontinues to pursue a hostile policy against the\r\nGovernment and the people of Cuba.\r\nThe embargo against Cuba runs counter to the\r\nletter and spirit of the United Nations Charter,\r\ninternational law and the Millennium Declaration. The\r\nblockade continues to cause damage not only to the\r\nCuban economy, but also to the social and cultural\r\ndevelopment of Cuban society, and it has deprived the\r\nCuban people of the opportunities and benefits derived\r\nfrom free trade and globalization. The embargo directly\r\nviolates the basic human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms not only of the people of Cuba, but also of\r\nthe citizens of the United States who would like to\r\nhave personal and business contacts with the people of\r\nCuba.\r\nNamibia strongly opposes the Torricelli Act and\r\nthe Helms-Burton Act, which have extraterritorial\r\neffect and violate the State sovereignty of Cuba and the\r\nprinciples and rules of the international trade system.\r\nIt is incomprehensible that the United States\r\nGovernment — which is well known for its advocacy\r\nof human rights and for its adherence to the rule of\r\nlaw — denies the people of Cuba the right to food,\r\nmedicine and education because of its political\r\nambitions. It is unfair for a country to impose its own\r\nphilosophy on another country against its will. Cuba\r\nposes no threat or danger to the United States. We\r\ntherefore reiterate that the policy of the United States\r\ntowards Cuba is inconsistent with the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nFor the past 12 consecutive years, the General\r\nAssembly has expressed its opposition to these\r\nunilateral sanctions through its resolutions. But those\r\nresolutions have not been implemented. That makes\r\none wonder why a double standard is applied in the\r\nimplementation of United Nations resolutions. As a\r\nresult, the people of Cuba continue to suffer under the\r\nblockade imposed by the United States. The draft\r\nresolution before us today is a reaffirmation of the\r\nCuban people’s inalienable rights to participate in free\r\ntrade and international navigation.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Namibia\r\ncontinues to uphold the principles of the peaceful\r\ncoexistence of nations, free trade and non-interference\r\nin the internal affairs of States. We therefore reiterate\r\nour call for the immediate and unconditional lifting of\r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nagainst Cuba. It is on that basis that my delegation will\r\nvote in favour of the draft resolution (A/59/L.2) before\r\nus.\r\nMr. Mirafzal (Islamic Republic of Iran): I should\r\nlike at the outset to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport (A/59/302 (Parts I and II)) under the agenda\r\nitem entitled “Necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America against Cuba” and to express\r\nour deep disappointment over the continuing embargo\r\nagainst that country. I would also like to associate\r\nmyself with the statement made by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nHistorically, unilateral economic measures used\r\nas a means of political and economic coercion against\r\ndeveloping countries have run counter to the spirit of\r\nthe United Nations Charter, which promotes solidarity,\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\ncooperation and friendly relations among countries and\r\nnations. Unlike our endeavours to create an enabling\r\nenvironment, such measures contravene all laws,\r\nprinciples and norms that govern international relations\r\nin the field of global trade and that promote increased\r\ncommercial and economic interactions among\r\ncountries.\r\nThe use of unilateral measures as a means of\r\npolitical and economic coercion against developing\r\ncountries has been condemned through decisions and\r\nresolutions adopted by various bodies of the United\r\nNations, particularly the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. The international\r\ncommunity should become more vocal about the need\r\nto repeal such measures and to prevent similar actions.\r\nThe adoption and implementation of unilateral\r\ncoercive measures and the use of embargoes prevent\r\nthe full achievement of economic and social\r\ndevelopment by the people of the affected countries,\r\nparticularly women and children, and negatively affect\r\ntheir well-being. They create obstacles to sustainable\r\ndevelopment and the full enjoyment of human rights,\r\nincluding the right of all people to a standard of living\r\nthat is adequate for their health and well-being and\r\nguarantees their right to food, medical care and\r\nnecessary social services. We must ensure that food\r\nand medicine are not used as tools to apply political\r\npressure.\r\nIt has now been established that unilateral\r\neconomic coercive measures jeopardize the legitimate\r\neconomic interests of the targeted developing\r\ncountries. The United Nations system and other\r\nrelevant international and multilateral organizations\r\nshould consolidate their efforts to create and strengthen\r\na supportive international economic environment that\r\ncan provide all countries with equal opportunities to\r\nbenefit from international economic, financial and\r\ntrade systems. They should also consider ways and\r\nmeans to compensate for the losses of countries\r\ntargeted by those who resort to such unilateral\r\nmeasures.\r\nIn showing our full solidarity with the people of\r\nCuba, my delegation not only will vote in favour of the\r\ndraft resolution (A/59/L.2) submitted under this item,\r\nbut also asks the international community to redouble\r\nits efforts to promote respect for international law and\r\nto create a just multilateral environment that is\r\nconducive to dialogue — an environment free from\r\nsanctions and embargoes.\r\nMr. Cherginets (Belarus) (spoke in Russian):\r\nToday, the General Assembly is once again considering\r\nthe item entitled “Necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”. Despite\r\nrepeated appeals in the past, the Government of the\r\nUnited States has still not taken any steps to\r\naccommodate the wishes of the international\r\ncommunity. Moreover, six months ago, the United\r\nStates authorities introduced new measures to tighten\r\nthe embargo against that sovereign and independent\r\nState.\r\nWe have been following this issue very closely\r\nfor another reason: the Republic of Belarus — a\r\ncountry that was a founding Member of the United\r\nNations, lost one out of every three of its citizens in the\r\nstruggle against fascism and is suffering more than any\r\nother country from the effects of the accident at the\r\nChernobyl nuclear plant — is being threatened by the\r\nsame kind of blockade. We must all realize and state\r\nfirmly that no State in the world has the right to punish\r\nentire peoples. It is time for that mentality to become a\r\nthing of the past. We cannot help asking why this lofty\r\nworld forum, the United Nations, considers questions\r\nof poverty eradication and high infant mortality rates\r\nbut fails to show consistency by preventing the\r\nsufferings of entire peoples.\r\nDr. Spock once said that no war, not even the\r\nmost victorious war, was worth even one tear of one\r\nchild. How many children’s tears are flowing today in\r\nthose countries on which the United States has imposed\r\na blockade? I would like to appeal to participants in\r\ntoday’s meeting to determine which country the United\r\nStates has helped through its imposition of an\r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade. There\r\nhave been no cases of even one people that have shown\r\nany sympathy for those kinds of actions.\r\nThe representative of the United States recently\r\nstated from this rostrum that the United States has\r\ngiven Cuba food and medications. That represents a\r\nstrange logic. You feel you have to bring somebody to\r\na state of starvation and destitution, and then you feel\r\nyou have to show your magnanimity. The remittances\r\nfrom the United States to Cuba, as was stated by the\r\nUnited States representative, constitute more than a\r\nbillion dollars. But, for some reason, he forgot to add\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nthat the Government of the United States has rescinded\r\nand forbidden the flow of those remittances in the\r\ndirection of Cuba.\r\nExperience has shown that unilateral attempts by\r\nStates to change the domestic political system of other\r\nStates by exerting any kind of pressure on them,\r\nparticularly military, political or economic pressure,\r\nare unacceptable and counterproductive. That is\r\nprecisely why we view the policy of the United States\r\nagainst Cuba as a series of dangerous steps that have a\r\nnegative impact on the security and stability not only\r\nof the region, but of the world as a whole.\r\nMy country demands the immediate lifting of the\r\nblockade against Cuba. We have always been in favour\r\nof the inalienable right of each State to determine its\r\nown model for the development of its own society.\r\nBelarus is pleased at the level of development achieved\r\nin our relations with Cuba. It is precisely the\r\ndevelopment of our commercial and economic\r\ntransactions that is our priority in our bilateral\r\nrelations. We have an open, reliable partner in Cuba —\r\none ready to engage in a dialogue of equals. We will\r\ncontinue to take steps, therefore, to enhance that\r\ncooperation and to develop friendly relations with\r\nCuba, and we urge all States to follow this example. In\r\nlight of this position, Belarus supports the draft\r\nresolution placed before the General Assembly today\r\nfor its consideration.\r\nMr. Chidyausiku (Zimbabwe): Like many others\r\nwho have spoken before us, my delegation welcomes\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General as contained in\r\ndocument A/59/302 (Parts I and II). Virtually all of the\r\nresponses of Member States and the relevant organs\r\nand agencies of the United Nations system contained in\r\nthe report have called for an immediate end to the\r\nunilateral embargo on Cuba. That clearly reflects the\r\ncommon view that the extraterritorial application of\r\nwhat is essentially a domestic law infringes on the\r\nsovereignty and legitimate interests of States and is\r\ninconsistent with the provisions of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nZimbabwe remains strongly opposed to all forms\r\nof economic, commercial and financial sanctions and\r\nembargoes on States, which run counter to the spirit of\r\nthe Charter of the Organization. We therefore view\r\nwith concern the continued application of a unilateral\r\npolicy of coercive economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo against Cuba. The application of laws, in\r\nparticular the Helms-Burton Act of 1996, that are\r\nintended to, inter alia, restrict the access of Cuba to\r\nmarkets, capital, investment and technology in order to\r\npressure it into changing its political and economic\r\nsystem or orientation, is a flagrant violation of the\r\nprinciples of international law, the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, the tenets of the World Trade\r\nOrganization, and numerous General Assembly\r\nresolutions. It is discriminatory in nature and\r\nundermines the principles of sovereignty, equality of\r\nStates and fundamental human rights.\r\nThe United States Administration has, in an\r\nunprecedented manner, escalated the worst embargo\r\npolicy against Cuba and the Cuban people as part of an\r\nimperial arrogance that blatantly violates the principles\r\nof international law, multilateralism and the will of the\r\ninternational community. In support of the principles of\r\ninternational law, the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nthe promotion of trade, Zimbabwe will, as in previous\r\nyears, vote in favour of draft resolution A/59/L.2,\r\nwhich is before us.\r\nMr. Own (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I would first like to join those who spoke\r\nbefore me in associating myself with the statement\r\ndelivered by the delegation of Qatar on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China with regard to this item.\r\nThe people of Cuba have been suffering from an\r\nunjust embargo that has lasted for over four decades.\r\nThis has led to grave unlimited losses that have\r\naffected all segments of Cuban society, especially the\r\nvulnerable ones, such as children, women and the\r\nelderly. This embargo has also limited the Cuban\r\nAdministration’s ability to import foodstuff,\r\nagricultural products, medical equipment and the\r\nmedicine required to treat the ill.\r\nThe imposition of the embargo and sanctions,\r\nwhich have been imposed in a unilateral and\r\nextraterritorial manner, often lead to grave\r\nconsequences and are in violation of the declared,\r\nrelevant principles of human rights and respect for\r\nhumanity, as well as international law and all\r\nconventions that govern relations between States.\r\nMoreover, those sanctions run counter to the\r\ninternational call for free trade and the implementation\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals and other goals\r\npertaining to development and the eradication of\r\npoverty.\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nThe international community has repeatedly and\r\nunequivocally rejected financial, commercial and\r\neconomic sanctions imposed on Cuba and on other\r\ncountries and peoples. That has been expressed in its\r\nadoption of many international resolutions passed in\r\nthe General Assembly of the United Nations in that\r\nregard.\r\nThe continuation of these oppressive measures,\r\nwhose impact and consequences affect the parties in\r\nconflict as well as third parties, only exacerbates\r\nhuman suffering and entrenches the causes of conflict\r\nand hatred between peoples who have common\r\ninterests. We must therefore take a realistic and\r\nrational approach towards finding appropriate,\r\ncivilized solutions to the many problems that have led\r\nto these measures, which we reject.\r\nIt is abundantly clear from many cases before us\r\nthat the use of sanctions and military force as a means\r\nof resolving disputes has become unacceptable and can\r\nonly lead to further unnecessary complications.\r\nIt is our responsibility, as civilized societies, to\r\nreject all forms of violence, including the imposition of\r\nsanctions and embargoes. We must use the reason and\r\nwisdom that God has blessed us with and engage in a\r\nconstructive dialogue to resolve all our disputes. This\r\nwill not be difficult if there is the necessary political\r\nwill.\r\nIn closing, I should like to reaffirm my country’s\r\nsupport for the draft resolution submitted by Cuba and\r\nour support for all international efforts aimed at\r\ncombating such oppressive measures.\r\nMr. Pérez Roque (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nMillions of Cubans are closely following what is\r\nhappening now in this Hall. Seventy per cent of them\r\nhave had to endure all their lives the longest blockade\r\nin history, imposed by the Government of the United\r\nStates on our homeland following the triumph of the\r\nCuban revolution.\r\nHowever, in voting today on the draft resolution\r\nentitled “Necessity of Ending the Economic,\r\nCommercial and Financial Embargo Imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”, the 191 States\r\nMembers of the United Nations will not only be taking\r\na decision on an issue of interest to Cuba; they will\r\nalso be voting in favour of respect for the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations, for international law, for the\r\nsovereign equality of States and for the self-\r\ndetermination of peoples — to ensure that no\r\nGovernment, however mighty, can punish Cuba or any\r\nother country for trading with or investing in it.\r\nToday we will be casting a vote against the\r\nextraterritorial enforcement of laws — a vote against\r\narrogance and disdain for the rights of others.\r\nI have here a curious document which the United\r\nStates has been distributing to all delegations —\r\nexcept, of course, to Cuba. I am struck by the fact that\r\nthe United States delegation, in its statement to the\r\nplenary, did not even try to say something new. Its\r\nrepresentative read out virtually word for word the\r\nstatement that was circulated to the rest of the\r\ndelegations. As we see it, this proves that they are\r\ntotally bankrupt of arguments. They find nothing new\r\nto say; they simply shamelessly repeat the same\r\nutterances from the same statement made in previous\r\nyears. This document lies so much and so often that it\r\ndeserves to be commented on. The United States\r\nmaintains that “the United States trade embargo against\r\nCuba is a bilateral issue that should not come before\r\nthe General Assembly”. It adds that it is clearly not a\r\nblockade, as the United States does not interfere with\r\nthe trade between Cuba and other nations.\r\nBut the General Assembly knows that the truth is\r\notherwise. It knows full well that this is not just an\r\nembargo and that the United States Government has\r\nunleashed a worldwide genocidal economic war on\r\nCuba. It knows that Cuba is prohibited from exporting\r\nto the United States and from receiving American\r\ntourists. We are prohibited from gaining access to\r\ntechnologies produced in that country and prevented\r\nfrom importing any product, piece of equipment or raw\r\nmaterial from the United States.\r\nThe Assembly also knows that the Torricelli Act,\r\nwhich has been in force since 1992 and is being strictly\r\nenforced, prohibits subsidiaries of United States\r\ncompanies in third countries from trading with Cuba. I\r\nwill cite just a few examples.\r\nThe Canadian subsidiary of the United States\r\ncompany Picker International was unable to sell Cuba\r\nspare parts for X-ray equipment, because it is a branch\r\nof an American company. Even a Canadian company\r\nhas been prohibited from selling spare parts for X-ray\r\nequipment to Cuba. French company Bull was unable\r\nto complete the sale to Cuba of ATM machines,\r\nbecause it was bought out by United States company\r\nDiebold — again, a French company, a company based\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nin France, cannot trade with Cuba. Refractarios\r\nMexicanos, a company from Mexico, was purchased by\r\nthe United States company Harbison Walker\r\nRefractory, and, from that time onward, was unable to\r\ncontinue selling to Cuba heat-resistant bricks used in\r\nfurnaces for cement production. I could go on and on,\r\ngiving endless examples that prove how companies\r\nbased in other countries are prohibited from trading\r\nwith Cuba.\r\nThe representative of the United States is well\r\naware, even though he may deny it, that no one\r\nanywhere in the world can sell a product or a piece of\r\nequipment to Cuba if it contains more than 10 percent\r\nof United States components. The import of a\r\nquadruple veterinary vaccine, which was to have been\r\nsupplied to our country by Dutch company Intervet,\r\nwas halted when the United States Government\r\ninformed that company that it could not sell the\r\nproduct to Cuba because it contained 10 per cent of an\r\nantigen made in the United States. At the same time,\r\nthe United States Government forbids any company in\r\nthe world from exporting a product or piece of\r\nequipment to the United States if it contains Cuban raw\r\nmaterials. A Japanese car manufacturer has to certify to\r\nthe United States Government that the metals used to\r\nmake the automobiles do not contain any Cuban nickel\r\nif they want to bring them into the United States. A\r\nEuropean producer of preserves has to prove that no\r\nCuban sugar was used in the manufacturing process if\r\nit wishes to export to the United States.\r\nThe American document also states that “The\r\nembargo regulations apply only to persons or entities\r\nsubject to United States jurisdiction”. If that is what it\r\nstates, then why, if it applies only to persons or entities\r\nsubject to United States jurisdiction, was Canadian\r\ncitizen James Sabzali, after seven years of\r\ninvestigation, sentenced last February by a\r\nPhiladelphia Federal Court to a year’s probation and a\r\n$10,000 fine for having sold to Cuba some resins that\r\npurify the drinking water supplied to the Cuban\r\npopulation? Why should the citizen of another country\r\nbe punished because he wanted to sell resin to Cuba\r\nthat is used to purify drinking water?\r\nWhy does the Torricelli Act prevent vessels from\r\nthe rest of the world from calling at Cuban ports, under\r\nthe threat of being blacklisted and denied access to\r\nAmerican ports for a period of six months? Why does\r\nthe Helms-Burton Act, in force since 1996, penalize\r\nbusinesspeople from the rest of the world who attempt\r\nto engage in business deals with Cuba?\r\nThe General Assembly has been informed that on\r\n4 May of this year, the United States Department of\r\nState sent a letter to the president of the Jamaican\r\ntourism company SuperClubs, warning him that if his\r\nbusiness with Cuba did not terminate within 45 days he\r\nwould be penalized under the Helms-Burton Act —\r\nwhich involved the denial of visas for him and his\r\nfamily to travel to the United States and the threat of\r\nfuture legal proceedings in United States courts.\r\nHow many businesspeople from countries\r\nrepresented in this Assembly have had to give up their\r\nintention of investing or dealing with Cuba because\r\nthey have been threatened with deprivation of visas for\r\nthemselves and their families when they wanted to\r\nenter the United States? And after all that I have\r\nmentioned here, which are just a few examples, the\r\nrepresentative of the United States has told us that the\r\nblockade is a bilateral issue. He tried to tell us that all\r\nthat was said in this debate — before Cuba had\r\nspoken — by 20 delegations representing their\r\ncountries is not true. We need more respect for the\r\nintelligence and for the responsible way in which other\r\ndelegations carry out their work.\r\nThe Government of the United States prevents\r\nCuba from using the dollar as a currency for trading\r\nwith the rest of the world. That is a fact. Our charges or\r\npayments in that currency are confiscated.\r\nIs it or is it not true — I address this question to\r\nthe representative of the United States — that your\r\nGovernment imposed a $100 million fine on the Swiss\r\nBank UBS simply because the latter received dollar\r\ntransfers from Cuba following the accrual of absolutely\r\nlegal earnings from our tourism and trade?\r\nAs of June this year, the media controlled by the\r\nMiami-based terrorist groups of Cuban origin have\r\nunleashed a crude campaign aimed at frightening the\r\nbanks that may have financial relations with Cuba. At\r\nthe same time, we have been receiving continuous\r\nreports that United States authorities are exerting\r\npressure on an ever-increasing number of banks from\r\nother countries in order to block currency transfers\r\nemanating from Cuba.\r\nFinally, on 9 October, Daniel Fisk, Deputy\r\nAssistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere\r\nAffairs, in addition to recognizing the efforts of the\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nUnited States Government to boycott tourism to Cuba\r\nfrom Europe, Canada and other countries, announced\r\nthat the United States had set up a Cuban Asset\r\nTargeting Group, with a view to freezing the\r\nmovements of hard currency towards and from Cuba. I\r\nrespectfully draw attention to the name of the\r\norganization that was set up — Cuban Asset Targeting\r\nGroup — in order to prevent our country from\r\nimporting goods, with its dollar income, and\r\npreventing any bank or company in the world from\r\ndoing so.\r\nAs a result of the foregoing, we concluded that all\r\nnecessary actions had to be promptly implemented in\r\norder to defend our country from the new acts of\r\naggression that attempt to prevent the use of the dollars\r\nthat we earn to pay for our imports. Therefore, 72\r\nhours ago, our President, Commander-in-Chief Fidel\r\nCastro, informed the public of the decision to replace\r\nthe circulation of the dollar with that of the convertible\r\nCuban peso throughout the national territory as an\r\nimmediate defensive response to the new forms of\r\naggression and the additional plans to prevent Cuba\r\nfrom using the dollar.\r\nConcerning this new episode in the United States\r\nblockade and our sovereign measures to defend\r\nourselves, the Permanent Mission of Cuba will be\r\nconveying additional information to each delegation.\r\nWould the United States delegation explain why\r\nCuba does not receive and has never received a credit\r\nfrom the World Bank or from the Inter-American\r\nDevelopment Bank? Because the United States\r\nGovernment prohibits it. In 2003, both international\r\nbanks, which are neither American-owned nor legally\r\nunder its control, loaned $14 billion to Latin America.\r\nWhy was not a single dollar lent to Cuba to build\r\nhouses, roads, hospitals or schools? Is it not Cuba, by\r\nchance, that is at the centre of the map of the\r\nAmericas?\r\nCan one blame the management of those banks,\r\nor do we have to acknowledge that they do not have\r\nthe power to make those loans, because of the\r\nresistance and opposition of the United States\r\nGovernment?\r\nIt is true that over the past three years we have\r\nbeen able to purchase food from the United States.\r\nHowever, we still have to overcome the draconian\r\nobstacles placed in the way of those sales, such as the\r\nneed for bureaucratic licenses, the obligation to pay in\r\nadvance and in cash — with no possibility of receiving\r\neven private credits — and the prohibition on Cuban\r\nvessels carrying such goods.\r\nThe United States delegation also maintains that\r\nits Government has introduced measures greatly\r\nfacilitating the export of medicines and medical\r\nsupplies to Cuba. The representative of the United\r\nStates also referred to figures that are false and appear\r\nto be based on fantasy. The General Assembly,\r\nhowever, knows that the truth is rather different.\r\nThe truth is that this year the United States\r\nGovernment prevented the Abbott company from\r\nselling Ritonavir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir to Cuba —\r\ntwo drugs that are necessary in the treatment of AIDS\r\npatients. As a result, Cuba had to purchase them from\r\nanother country, paying six times as much in order to\r\ndo so.\r\nThe truth — which must be told in this Hall — is\r\nthat the Government of the United States imposed a\r\nfine of $168,500 on Chiron Corporation because a\r\nEuropean subsidiary of that company had —\r\nsupposedly by mistake — sold two children’s vaccines\r\nto Cuba. The European subsidiary of Chiron\r\nCorporation sold those vaccines to Cuba, and the\r\nUnited States Government fined the company for\r\nhaving done so.\r\nThe text distributed by the United States in this\r\nHall today states that Cuba is using the draft resolution\r\nto justify its own political and economic woes. If the\r\nUnited States Government is so sure that Cuba uses the\r\nissue of the embargo as a pretext, why does it not lift it\r\nand leave us without a pretext? The United States must\r\nrespond; if it does not want to provide us with a\r\npretext, let it eliminate the embargo.\r\nIn his statement this morning, the representative\r\nof the United States said that Cuba is trying to blame\r\nthe United States and divert attention from the human\r\nrights situation in Cuba. He either made a mistake or\r\nhe lied — on two counts. First, Cuba is not trying to\r\nblame the United States. The United States has brought\r\nthe blame on itself; it does not need our help. Its\r\nactions are clear. It is clear to the Assembly that the\r\nembargo exists; it is made tougher every day, and is\r\nviciously applied, provoking almost unanimous\r\nrepudiation by the international community.\r\nSecondly, Cuba truly believes that the argument\r\nthat the embargo can be justified as a measure to\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nimprove human rights in Cuba makes no sense,\r\nbecause Cuba believes that the Government of the\r\nUnited States has less moral authority or credibility\r\nthan any other country in the world to talk of human\r\nrights in other countries. Given the unilateral wars that\r\nthat Government has undertaken in violation of\r\ninternational law and the Charter, ignoring the wishes\r\nGeneral Assembly; given the crimes that it has\r\ncommitted and its mass bombings of civilian\r\npopulations in other countries; given the fact that is it\r\nthe principal guarantor and protector of crimes that are\r\ndaily committed against the Palestinian people; given\r\nits inhuman and degrading treatment and torture of\r\nprisoners at the base at Guantanamo Bay and at Abu\r\nGhraib, as well as disappearance of some of the\r\nprisoners there; the Cuban delegation believes that the\r\nUnited States should at least remain silent out of\r\nshame, and deal with its own problems, which include\r\nsevere limitations on the public rights and freedoms of\r\nits own citizens.\r\nThe argument that the United States imposed the\r\nembargo in response to the decision by Cuba to defend\r\nitself from attempts by the United States to finance and\r\norganize an opposition within Cuba simply does not\r\nstand up. Those who are referred to in this country as\r\ndissidents are in fact mercenaries who receive money\r\nand directions from the Government of the United\r\nStates, and Cuba has a legitimate right to defend itself\r\nfrom them. It is we, the people and the Government of\r\nCuba, who are the dissidents — who are defying the\r\npressure and the system imposed upon us by the United\r\nStates.\r\nI referred earlier to the fact that the representative\r\nof the United States spoke today in Spanish. He should\r\nbear in mind that a great many emigrants from Mexico\r\nand other Latin American countries die on the United\r\nStates border as they try to emigrate — yet not a single\r\nword has been said in defence of their rights.\r\nThe United States text accuses us of using the\r\ndraft resolution to justify our poor economic policies. I\r\nbelieve that the United States text attempts to justify an\r\nembargo that is simply unjustifiable in the eyes of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nWhy does the United States Government not lift\r\nthe embargo against Cuba? Because it is afraid. It is\r\nafraid of our example. It knows that if the embargo is\r\nlifted, Cuba will make dramatic progress in its socio-\r\neconomic development. It knows that we will provide\r\nfurther evidence of the great potential of Cuban\r\nsocialism — the potential, not yet fully tapped, of a\r\ncountry without any kind of discrimination, with social\r\njustice and human rights for all citizens, not just for the\r\nfew. The United States Administration governs a large\r\nand mighty empire, but it is afraid of the example of a\r\nsmall rebellious island.\r\nWe are gathered here just five days away from the\r\nelections in this country — elections which we all\r\nawait with secret hope. It is true that the past four years\r\nhave been terrible for the world. Cuba, however, is\r\nlooking forward with optimism and confidence. It\r\nknows that it is right. It knows that time is on its side.\r\nIt can see the ever-increasing rejection of the embargo\r\nwithin the United States. It has not forgotten that the\r\nembargo has cost us more than $79 billion. Cuba\r\nknows that if the embargo is lifted, within a few years\r\nthere will be a tremendous improvement in the living\r\nstandards of its citizens. It knows, for example, that in\r\n10 years’ time our country could have built 1 million\r\nnew houses, providing shelter for some 4 or 5 million\r\nCubans.\r\nCuba also knows that if the embargo is not lifted\r\nand there is no end to the hostility that has prevailed\r\nfor over four decades, the situation will continue to be\r\ndifficult — although not impossible. Our people are\r\nsure that there is no human or moral constraint capable\r\nof hindering their advance towards a more prosperous\r\nand just country.\r\nIt is true that for the past 12 years the United\r\nStates Government has disregarded the resolutions\r\nadopted, with ever-increasing support, by this\r\nAssembly, demanding the end of the embargo against\r\nCuba. But that does not diminish the great importance\r\nof the act to be undertaken today by each and every\r\ndelegation on behalf of its people.\r\nThe Government of the United States has been\r\nthe only one today to defend the embargo.\r\nFurthermore, it is the only one publicly to have\r\nexpressed the hope that President Fidel Castro would\r\nnot recover from the fracture that he suffered as a\r\nresult of a fall. We have never before seen such a\r\ncomplete lack of courtesy and moral credibility —\r\neven from an opponent.\r\nBut it does not matter. President Fidel Castro has\r\nalready passed into history as a symbol of the\r\nresistance of peoples against imperialism and as a\r\nsymbol that a better world is possible. As for those\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nwho today defend the blockade on Cuba and who do\r\nnot want to see any improvements — well, no one will\r\nremember them tomorrow.\r\nOn behalf of the Cuban people, whose sons and\r\ndaughters have gone out to heal, to teach, to build and\r\nto fight side by side with every country that ever\r\nneeded Cubans; on behalf of the memory of the 2,000\r\nCubans who laid down their lives fighting colonialism\r\nand apartheid in Africa; on behalf of the 22,474 Cuban\r\nhealth workers currently rendering services in 67\r\ncountries of the third world; in the name of the Cuban\r\nteachers, who are now teaching over 17,000 young\r\npeople from 110 countries in our schools free of\r\ncharge; in the name of five young Cuban heroes who\r\nare enduring cruel and unjust prison terms in the\r\nUnited States because they were fighting terrorism; in\r\nthe name of the Cuban children who are entitled to live\r\nand enjoy a future different from that which their\r\nparents had to undergo and fight for in their\r\nhomeland — in sum, on behalf of a small country that\r\nis harassed because it wants to be free — I would\r\nrespectfully ask the Assembly once again to vote in\r\nfavour of the draft resolution submitted by Cuba.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): We have heard\r\nthe last speaker in the debate on this agenda item.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution\r\nA/59/L.2.\r\nBefore giving the floor to the representative of\r\nthe Russian Federation, who wishes to speak in\r\nexplanation of vote before the voting, may I remind\r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10\r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Chulkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The Russian Federation, like the\r\noverwhelming majority of other United Nations\r\nMember States, strongly condemns the United States\r\nblockade against Cuba and favours its lifting.\r\nOpposition on this issue is consistent and has not\r\nchanged. At successive General Assembly sessions, the\r\nRussian Federation has voted in support of the\r\nresolution calling for the ending of the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America against Cuba. The Russian\r\nFederation has consistently adhered to a position\r\nregarding the inadmissibility of applying unilateral\r\ndiscriminatory measures of an extra-territorial nature in\r\ninternational relations.\r\nIn today’s rapidly globalizing world, any attempts\r\nto isolate a given country are, in our view, counter-\r\nproductive. We are compelled to note with regret that\r\nthe recent actions by the United States administration,\r\nincluding its decision to tighten the unilaterally\r\nimposed sanctions against Cuba, are not helping to\r\nnormalize the Cuban-United States relationship. In this\r\nconnection, we are concerned at the latest step in the\r\nexacerbation of Cuban-United States relations, which\r\nis leading to increased confrontation between the two\r\ncountries and is hampering the establishment of a\r\nconstructive dialogue.\r\nThe coercive extraterritorial measures proclaimed\r\nand unilaterally adopted by the United States\r\nadministration run counter to the provisions of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and the recognized principles\r\nof international law. Their extraterritorial consequences\r\nseriously impinge on the sovereignty of other States,\r\nthe legitimate interests of persons — natural and\r\njuridical — that are subject to that jurisdiction, and\r\ncreate impediments to free trade and to the free\r\nmovement of capital at the regional and international\r\nlevels.\r\nWe are convinced that the lifting of the embargo\r\nand normalization of the United States-Cuban\r\nrelationship on the whole would help to improve the\r\nsituation around Cuba and promote its integration into\r\nworld and regional processes. We believe that that, in\r\nturn, would stimulate democratic and socio-economic\r\nreforms on the island.\r\nThe continuation of the commercial, economic\r\nand financial embargo against Cuba by the United\r\nStates is not in keeping with the spirit of the times and\r\nhampers the formation of a new, just world order in the\r\ntwenty-first century, one based on the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the\r\nprimacy of international law.\r\nGuided by the fundamental principles of the\r\nCharter regarding the inadmissibility of discriminatory\r\nmeasures or interference in the affairs of sovereign\r\nStates, the Russian Federation, pursuant to its position\r\ntaken at previous sessions of the General Assembly,\r\nwill also vote at this current session in support of draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.2, calling for the lifting of the\r\nembargo and for the normalization of Cuban-United\r\nStates relations, which would make it possible to turn a\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nnew page in the relationship between those two\r\ncountries and make a worthy contribution to the\r\nestablishment of peace, concord and stability in the\r\nregion.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): We have heard\r\nthe only speaker in explanation of vote before the\r\nvoting.\r\nThe General Assembly will now take a decision\r\non the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/59/L.2. A recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola,\r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia,\r\nAustralia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas,\r\nBahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus,\r\nBelgium, Belize, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei\r\nDarussalam, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi,\r\nCambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Cape Verde,\r\nCentral African Republic, Chile, China,\r\nColombia, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic,\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea,\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark,\r\nDjibouti, Dominica, Dominican Republic,\r\nEcuador, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea,\r\nEstonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Gabon,\r\nGambia, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Greece,\r\nGrenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau,\r\nGuyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland,\r\nIndia, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of),\r\nIreland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan,\r\nKazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait,\r\nKyrgyzstan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic,\r\nLatvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania,\r\nLuxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia,\r\nMaldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius,\r\nMexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Mozambique,\r\nMyanmar, Namibia, Nauru, Nepal, Netherlands,\r\nNew Zealand, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Oman,\r\nPakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay,\r\nPeru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar,\r\nRepublic of Korea, Republic of Moldova,\r\nRomania, Russian Federation, Rwanda, Saint\r\nKitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and\r\nthe Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, Sao Tome\r\nand Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, Seychelles, Sierra Leone,\r\nSingapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands,\r\nSomalia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan,\r\nSuriname, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland,\r\nSyrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-\r\nLeste, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago,\r\nTunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, Uganda,\r\nUkraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom\r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania, Uruguay, Venezuela\r\n(Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, Yemen,\r\nZambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst:\r\nIsrael, Marshall Islands, Palau, United States of\r\nAmerica\r\nAbstaining:\r\nMicronesia (Federated States of)\r\nDraft resolution A/59/L.2 was adopted by 179\r\nvotes to 4, with 1 abstention (resolution 59/11).\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Before giving\r\nthe floor representatives wishing to speak in\r\nexplanation of vote on the resolution just adopted, may\r\nI remind delegations that explanations of vote are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Hamburger (Netherlands): I have the\r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The\r\ncandidate countries Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia and\r\nthe countries of the Stabilization and Association\r\nProcess and potential candidates Albania, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro and the former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia align themselves\r\nwith this statement.\r\nThe European Union believes that the United\r\nStates trade policy towards Cuba should primarily be a\r\nbilateral issue without extraterritorial implications for\r\nthird countries. Therefore, the European Union again\r\nreiterates its opposition to the extraterritorial aspect of\r\nthe United States embargo that has been implemented\r\nin accordance with the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992\r\nand the Helms-Burton Act of 1996.\r\nThe European Union cannot accept that unilateral\r\nmeasures imposed by the United States on specific\r\ncountries limit its economic and commercial relations\r\nwith third countries, in this case Cuba. Therefore, in\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nNovember 1996, the European Union adopted a\r\nregulation and a joint action to protect the interests of\r\nnatural and legal persons from the European Union\r\nagainst the extraterritorial effects of the Helms-Burton\r\nAct.\r\nIn 1998, during their summit in London, the\r\nEuropean Union and the United States agreed on a\r\npackage of measures involving, inter alia, United\r\nStates agreement to suspend titles III and IV of the\r\nHelms-Burton Act and not to adopt any further\r\nextraterritorial legislation of that kind, as well as an\r\nagreement on both sides to increase investment\r\nprotection. The European Union expects that the\r\nUnited States will continue to act in accordance with\r\nthe commitments made.\r\nThe European Union’s policy towards Cuba,\r\nbased on its Common Position adopted in 1996, is clear\r\nand coherent. The main objective of the European\r\nUnion in its relations with Cuba is to encourage a\r\nprocess of peaceful transition to pluralist democracy\r\nand respect for human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms, as well as a sustainable economic recovery\r\nand an improvement of the living standards of the\r\nCuban people. The European Union underlines that it\r\nis willing to cooperate with Cuba in those fields on the\r\nbasis of a dialogue with the Cuban Government and\r\nCuban civil society, especially in the field of human\r\nrights. Constructive engagement still remains the aim\r\nof the European Union’s policy towards Cuba. We urge\r\nthe Cuban authorities to respond accordingly.\r\nThe European Union strongly condemns the\r\ncurrent human rights situation in Cuba, which has not\r\nshown any significant improvement since 2003. The\r\nongoing violations of human rights and the continuing\r\ndetention of a large number of prisoners of\r\nconscience — including those arrested and convicted\r\nin March and April 2003 — are still major concerns for\r\nthe European Union. The European Union calls for the\r\nimmediate release of or amnesty for all those detained\r\nfor political reasons and appeals to the Cuban\r\nauthorities to cooperate fully with international human\r\nrights bodies and mechanisms.\r\nThe European Union rejects the restrictions\r\nimposed on the embassies of most European Union\r\nmember States by the Cuban authorities, which impede\r\ndiplomatic contacts and constitute a de facto violation\r\nof the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.\r\nThe negative influence of the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America, as well as Cuban domestic\r\neconomic policy, seriously hamper the economic\r\ndevelopment of the island and negatively affect the\r\ndaily life of the Cuban population. With regard to the\r\nlatter — that is, Cuba’s domestic economic policy —\r\nwe are concerned about the imposition of new\r\nrestrictions on private enterprise with negative\r\neconomic consequences for many Cuban citizens.\r\nWith regard to the United States of America, we\r\nrepeat our view that the opening of the Cuban economy\r\nwould benefit all people and express our rejection of\r\nall unilateral measures against Cuba, which are\r\ncontrary to commonly accepted rules of international\r\ntrade. With regard to Cuba, the European Union urges\r\nthe Cuban authorities to bring about rapid, lasting and\r\nsubstantial improvements in the fields mentioned, in\r\nparticular with a view to ensuring the full respect for\r\nall human rights.\r\nFor all the foregoing reasons, and in spite of its\r\nserious criticism of Cuba, the European Union\r\nunanimously voted in favour of the resolution that has\r\njust been adopted.\r\nMr. Sardenburg (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nhave the honour to speak on behalf of the countries of\r\nthe Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) —\r\nArgentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil — and the\r\nassociated countries Bolivia, Chile and Peru. As in\r\nprevious years, MERCOSUR members and associated\r\ncountries voted in favour of the resolution that the\r\nAssembly has just adopted.\r\nThe application of coercive unilateral measures\r\ndoes not contribute to the promotion of democracy or\r\nrespect for and protection of human rights. Differences\r\nbetween States should be resolved through dialogue\r\nand understanding, in a constructive spirit. Coercive\r\nmeasures, such as sanctions or embargoes, are\r\nexceptions that should be resorted to only when all\r\nother means have been exhausted, and they must be\r\nfirmly grounded in international law. The\r\nextraterritorial enforcement of national legislation runs\r\ncounter to the need to foster dialogue and ensure\r\nfulfilment of the purposes and principles of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations and infringes upon the\r\nsovereignty of States.\r\nSanctions and embargoes that are not in\r\nconformity with the norms of international law serve\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\nonly to heighten tension. If, as in the present case, they\r\naffect the interests of third States, the international\r\ncommunity has even greater reason to be concerned\r\nand to speak out. In addition to having been repeatedly\r\nrejected by the General Assembly, the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America has been repudiated at a\r\nseries of international forums, such as the Organization\r\nof American States, the Rio Group, the Ibero-American\r\nSummit and the Latin American Economic System.\r\nThe embargo is equally incompatible with the legal\r\nobligations of members of the World Trade\r\nOrganization. Insisting on continuing to impose this\r\nkind of punitive measure — compounded recently by\r\nthe unilateral measures taken in May this year — is an\r\nexercise that is injurious to everyone and that weakens\r\nour ability to tackle the common challenges of our\r\ntime.\r\nThe countries of MERCOSUR and its associated\r\ncountries echo the international community’s almost\r\nunanimous rejection of the promulgation and\r\napplication of such unilateral and extraterritorial\r\ncoercive measures. Apart from the legal aspects, those\r\nmeasures do not promote the full reintegration of Cuba\r\ninto the region of the Americas.\r\nMr. Omura (Japan): Japan shares the concern\r\nexpressed by many delegations today regarding the\r\nextraterritorial application of jurisdiction arising from\r\nthe Helms-Burton Act of the United States, which is\r\nlikely to run counter to international law. My\r\nGovernment has been closely following the\r\nimplementation of the legislation as well as the\r\ncircumstances surrounding it, and its concerns remain\r\nunchanged. For that reason, my delegation voted in\r\nfavour of draft resolution A/59/L.2. While Japan\r\nsupports the resolution that has been adopted, as my\r\ndelegation stated here last year on the same occasion, it\r\nhas some questions as to whether the General\r\nAssembly is, in fact, the most suitable forum in which\r\nto address the very complex issue of the United States\r\nembargo against Cuba.\r\nJapan believes that it is desirable for both\r\ncountries to seek a solution through bilateral dialogue,\r\nand thus calls upon them to strengthen efforts to that\r\nend.\r\nMr. Aspelund (Iceland): Iceland voted in favour\r\nof the draft resolution. Iceland believes that it is not in\r\nthe best interest of the multilateral system for States to\r\napply unilateral trade sanctions outside the United\r\nNations system. However, I would like to make it clear\r\nthat Iceland’s vote in favour of the resolution is not\r\nintended to be, in any way, an indication of support for\r\nthe policies of the present Government of Cuba.\r\nIceland strongly condemns the human rights\r\nsituation in Cuba, in which many fundamental rights\r\nunder United Nations conventions are violated on a\r\nregular basis. Iceland supports the call for free media,\r\nfair trials, freedom of expression, the release of\r\npolitical prisoners and an end to arbitrary detentions —\r\nin other words, a full application of civil and political\r\nrights.\r\nMr. Sawford (Australia): Australia shares\r\nconcerns about the state of human rights and political\r\nfreedoms in Cuba, but we do not consider that isolating\r\nCuba through economic sanctions is an effective means\r\nof achieving human rights and political reform.\r\nAustralia has consistently expressed its\r\nopposition, as a matter of principle, to the\r\npromulgation and application by States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations of laws and measures the\r\nextraterritorial effects of which affect the sovereignty\r\nof other States, the legitimate interests of entities or\r\npersons under their jurisdiction, as well as freedom of\r\ntrade and navigation.\r\nIn Australia’s view, such laws and measures are\r\nnot justified by the principles of international law and\r\ncomity. Australia is therefore concerned about the\r\nextraterritorial aspects of the Helms-Burton Act of\r\n1996. For those reasons, Australia has again voted for\r\nthe resolution submitted under the agenda item.\r\nMr. Strømmen (Norway): The Norwegian\r\nGovernment believes there is a clear distinction\r\nbetween unilateral measures, on the one hand, and\r\nsanctions adopted by the international community,\r\nthrough the United Nations, on the other. In our view,\r\nno country should impose its legislation on third\r\ncountries. Norway has, therefore, once again voted for\r\nthe resolution on the necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America against Cuba.\r\nHowever, the embargo cannot in any way be used\r\nas a justification for the lack of civil and political\r\nrights in Cuba, and the continued persecution of\r\npeaceful dissidents, writers and journalists that takes\r\nplace on the island. The human rights situation in Cuba\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.44\r\ncontributes to the country’s isolation within the\r\ninternational community. We urge the Cuban\r\nGovernment to release all political prisoners.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): We have heard\r\nthe last speaker in explanation of vote.\r\nThe Cuban delegation has asked to speak in\r\nexercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, statements in\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the\r\nsecond and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nI give the floor to the representative of Cuba.\r\nMr. López Clemente (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nOnce again we have heard an explanation of vote from\r\nthe representative of the European Union (EU). The\r\nEU has explained that its vote has nothing to do with\r\nthe sufferings imposed on our people by the economic\r\nblockade of all of these years, but that it has to do with\r\nthe blockade’s extraterritorial aspect. We all know that.\r\nThe EU has expressed concern about human\r\nrights in Cuba, and that has become a paradigm for the\r\ndefence of mercenaries at the service of a foreign\r\nPower, who are trying to turn their homeland into a\r\nUnited States protectorate. The EU tries to ignore the\r\ngrave economic damage caused to our country and\r\nothers by the blockade, and the sufferings of our\r\npeople, who have undertaken, with great sacrifice, to\r\nestablish a healthier and more just and equal society. It\r\npretends to overlook the high levels of culture,\r\neducation, social protection, and medical coverage that\r\nthe people have achieved in spite of being subject to\r\nblockade and the aggressive policy pursued by the\r\nUnited States for more than 40 years. That policy has\r\nincluded military aggression, psychological war,\r\nbiological war and terrorist acts, among others.\r\nThe representative of the EU has tried to set aside\r\nall those facts, and that is part of the double standard\r\nthat applies in the world. The EU expresses its concern\r\nabout human rights in third-world countries and\r\ncondemns them for supposed violations of those human\r\nrights and so-called democratic norms.\r\nThe same delegations, however, try to avoid any\r\nreference to the violations of human rights committed,\r\nfor example, in the prisons of some countries of the\r\nthird world, or ignore electoral fraud when such\r\nviolations are committed by a major ally.\r\nThe representatives of the EU also need to\r\naddress their own problems of xenophobia, domestic\r\nviolence, gender inequality, racism, drugs, the\r\ndisintegration of their societies, and many other social\r\nproblems that they face. Cuba rejects, word for word,\r\nthe statement made by the representative of the EU,\r\nand repeats that we do not recognize the moral\r\nauthority of the EU to make such statements, which are\r\nbased on hypocrisy and double standards. The EU\r\nneeds to change its policy, respect our people and\r\nremedy its vacillating position, which lacks principle\r\nwhere Cuba is concerned.\r\nCuba will continue to pursue the path it embarked\r\non more than 40 years ago, for the benefit of its people,\r\nand in spite of opposition and aggression from the\r\ngreatest super-power in history. We know that some of\r\nthe representatives who have spoken here today have,\r\nto varying degrees, some misunderstandings. However,\r\nwe also know that the vast majority of the world’s\r\npeople respect and admire what we do and what we\r\nhave accomplished.\r\nThe Cuban people rose up to create its present\r\nand its future, and it will never turn back.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): May I take it\r\nthat it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude\r\nits consideration of agenda item 28?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
