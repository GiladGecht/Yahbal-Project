(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 15 (continued)\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic\r\nand Social Council\r\nLetter dated 25 August 2004 from the\r\nPermanent Representative of Greece to the\r\nUnited Nations addressed to the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly (A/59/358)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): As was\r\nannounced at the 43rd plenary meeting, on 27 October\r\n2004, the General Assembly will first proceed to a by-\r\nelection to elect a member of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, in accordance with rule 140 of the rules of\r\nprocedure.\r\nIn that regard, I should like to draw the attention\r\nof members to document A/59/358, containing a letter\r\ndated 25 August 2004 from the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Greece to the United Nations. In his\r\nletter, the Permanent Representative of Greece\r\nannounces that Greece would like to relinquish its seat\r\non the Economic and Social Council during 2005 in\r\nfavour of Spain.\r\nAs a result, a vacancy will occur and a new\r\nmember must therefore be elected to fill the unexpired\r\nterm of office of Greece, commencing on 1 January\r\n2005 and expiring on 31 December 2005.\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 4 of General\r\nAssembly resolution 2847 (XXVI), of 20 December\r\n1971, and taking into account that the vacancy will\r\noccur from among the Group of Western European and\r\nother States, the new member should therefore be\r\nelected from that region.\r\nI should like to inform the members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly that the candidate who receives a\r\ntwo-thirds majority of members present and voting will\r\nbe declared elected. In the case of a tie vote, there will\r\nbe a special restricted ballot limited to those candidates\r\nwho have obtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to\r\nthat procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In accordance\r\nwith rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall\r\nbe held by secret ballot, and there shall be no\r\nnominations.\r\nRegarding the vacancy, the Chairman of the\r\nGroup of Western European and other States for the\r\nmonth of August has informed the Secretariat that the\r\nGroup has endorsed Spain.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, we shall now proceed to the election by\r\nsecret ballot.\r\nI should like to inform members that, as of\r\n1 January 2005, the following States from the Group of\r\nWestern European and other States will be represented\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.45\r\non the Economic and Social Council: Belgium,\r\nCanada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Turkey and\r\nthe United States of America. The names of those eight\r\nStates should therefore not appear on the ballot.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like\r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the\r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no\r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a\r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process.\r\nBallot papers will now be distributed. I request\r\nrepresentatives to use only those ballot papers and to\r\nwrite on them the name of the one State for which they\r\nwish to vote. A ballot paper containing more than one\r\nname from the region will be declared invalid. The\r\nname of a Member State on a ballot paper that does not\r\nbelong to that region will not be counted at all.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Ms. Ioannou\r\n(Cyprus), Mr. Micanek (Czech Republic),\r\nMr. Seyoum (Eritrea), Mr. Mallia (Malta),\r\nMr. Realini (Monaco) and Ms. Fricot (Saint\r\nLucia) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 3.30 p.m. and\r\nresumed at 3.50 p.m.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The result of\r\nthe voting is as follows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers 185\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:     5\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 180\r\nAbstentions:     6\r\nNumber of members voting: 174\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 116\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nSpain 163\r\nGreece     3\r\nAustralia     2\r\nIceland     2\r\nUnited Kingdom     2\r\nDenmark     1\r\nSweden     1\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Having\r\nobtained the required two-thirds majority, Spain has\r\nthus been elected a member of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council for a term of office beginning on\r\n1 January 2005 and ending on 31 December 2005.\r\nI congratulate Spain, which has been elected a\r\nmember of the Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe General Assembly will next turn to the\r\nelection of 18 members of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil to replace those members whose term of office\r\nexpires on 31 December 2004. The 18 outgoing\r\nmembers are: Australia, Bhutan, Burundi, Chile,\r\nChina, El Salvador, Finland, Ghana, Guatemala,\r\nHungary, India, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Qatar, the\r\nRussian Federation, Sweden, the United Kingdom of\r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland, Ukraine and\r\nZimbabwe. Members will recall that Greece\r\nrelinquished its seat on the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, effective 1 January 2005, and that Spain has\r\njust been elected to fill that vacancy.\r\nAs of 1 January 2005, the following States will be\r\nrepresented on the Economic and Social Council:\r\nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belgium, Belize,\r\nBenin, Canada, Colombia, Congo, Cuba, Ecuador,\r\nFrance, Germany, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica,\r\nJapan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mozambique,\r\nNamibia, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Panama, Poland, the\r\nRepublic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Spain,\r\nTunisia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania and the United States of\r\nAmerica. The names of these 36 States should\r\ntherefore not appear on the ballots.\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 4 of General\r\nAssembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December\r\n1971, and taking into account the number of States that\r\nwill remain members of the Council after 1 January\r\n2005, the 18 members should be elected as follows:\r\nfour from the Group of African States, four from the\r\nGroup of Asian States, three from the Group of Eastern\r\nEuropean States, three from the Group of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States and four from the\r\nGroup of Western European and other States. The\r\nballot papers reflect that pattern.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that those\r\ncandidates, their number not exceeding the number of\r\nseats to be filled, who receive the greatest number of\r\nvotes and a two-thirds majority of members present\r\nand voting, will be declared elected. In the case of a tie\r\nvote for a remaining seat, there will be a special\r\nrestricted ballot limited to those candidates that have\r\nobtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to\r\nthat procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.45\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In accordance\r\nwith rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall\r\nbe held by secret ballot and there shall be no\r\nnominations.\r\nRegarding candidatures, the Chairmen of the\r\nrespective regional groups have informed the\r\nSecretariat of the following. For the four vacant seats\r\nfrom among the African States, the Group has endorsed\r\nfour candidates, namely Chad, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Guinea and South Africa.\r\nFor the four vacant seats from among the Asian\r\nStates, there are five candidates, namely, China, India,\r\nKazakhstan, Pakistan and Thailand.\r\nFor the three vacant seats from among the Eastern\r\nEuropean States, there are four candidates, namely,\r\nAlbania, Lithuania, the Russian Federation and the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\r\nFor the three vacant seats from among the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, three are five\r\ncandidates, namely, Brazil, Costa Rica, Honduras,\r\nMexico and Venezuela.\r\nFor the four vacant seats from among the Western\r\nEuropean and other States, the Group has endorsed\r\nfour candidates, namely, Australia, Denmark, Iceland\r\nand the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern\r\nIreland.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, we shall now proceed to the election by\r\nsecret ballot.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like\r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the\r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no\r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a\r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. I ask\r\nfor the usual cooperation of representatives during the\r\nvoting.\r\nI should also like to remind members that all\r\ncampaigning in the General Assembly Hall must cease\r\nduring the voting. That means, in particular, that once\r\nthe election has begun, no campaign materials may be\r\ndistributed in the Hall. All representatives are also\r\nasked to remain in their seats, in order that the voting\r\nmay take place in an orderly manner. I thank members\r\nagain for their cooperation.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process.\r\nBallot papers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E”\r\nwill now be distributed. I request representatives to use\r\nonly those ballot papers and to write on them the\r\nnames of the States for which they wish to vote.\r\nA ballot paper containing more names from the\r\nrelevant region than the number of seats assigned to it\r\nwill be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a\r\nballot paper that do not belong to that region will not\r\nbe counted at all.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Ms. Ioannou\r\n(Cyprus), Mr. Micanek (Czech Republic),\r\nMr. Seyoum (Eritrea), Mr. Mallia (Malta),\r\nMr. Realini (Monaco) and Ms. Fricot (Saint\r\nLucia) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 4.10 p.m. and\r\nresumed at 5.55 p.m.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The result of\r\nthe voting is as follows:\r\nGroup A — African States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 190\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 190\r\nAbstentions: 2\r\nNumber of members voting: 188\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 126\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nChad 184\r\nSouth Africa 183\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo 182\r\nGuinea 179\r\nGuinea-Bissau 2\r\nGroup B — Asian States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 190\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 190\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting: 190\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 127\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nIndia 174\r\nChina 157\r\nThailand 153\r\nPakistan 151\r\nKazakhstan 96\r\nIran 4\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.45\r\nGroup C — Eastern European States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 190\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 190\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of members voting: 189\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 126\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nLithuania 170\r\nRussian Federation 150\r\nAlbania 116\r\nThe former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia 113\r\nGroup D — Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 190\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 190\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting: 190\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 127\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMexico 139\r\nBrazil 135\r\nCosta Rica 116\r\nVenezuela 93\r\nHonduras 70\r\nBolivia 1\r\nGroup E — Western European and other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 190\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 190\r\nAbstentions: 5\r\nNumber of members voting: 185\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 124\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nIceland 178\r\nAustralia 176\r\nUnited Kingdom 176\r\nDenmark 174\r\nAustria 2\r\nFinland 1\r\nSweden 1\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority,\r\nAustralia, Brazil, Chad, China, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Denmark, Guinea,\r\nIceland, India, Lithuania, Mexico, Pakistan, the\r\nRussian Federation, South Africa, Thailand and\r\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland were elected members of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council for a three-year\r\nterm beginning 1 January 2005.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): There remain\r\ntwo seats to be filled: one seat from among the Eastern\r\nEuropean States and one seat from among the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States.\r\nWe shall therefore proceed to a restricted ballot.\r\nThis second round of balloting shall be restricted\r\nto the two States from among the Eastern European\r\nStates that were not elected but that obtained the\r\nlargest number of votes in the previous ballot, namely,\r\nAlbania and The former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia, as well as to the two States from among\r\nthe Latin American and Caribbean States that were not\r\nelected but that obtained the largest number of votes in\r\nthe previous ballot, namely, Costa Rica and Venezuela.\r\nThat is in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of\r\nprocedure.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like\r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the\r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no\r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a\r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process.\r\nBallot papers marked “C” and “D” will now be\r\ndistributed.\r\nMay I ask representatives to write on the ballot\r\npapers the name of the one State for which they wish to\r\nvote.
