(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nReports of the Fifth Committee\r\nThe President (spoke in French): If there is no\r\nproposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall\r\ntake it that the General Assembly decides not to\r\ndiscuss the reports of the Fifth Committee that are\r\nbefore the Assembly today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Statements will\r\ntherefore be limited to explanations of vote. The\r\npositions of delegations regarding the\r\nrecommendations of the Fifth Committee have been\r\nmade clear in the Committee and are reflected in the\r\nrelevant official records.\r\nMay I remind members that, under paragraph 7 of\r\ndecision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that,\r\n“When the same draft resolution is\r\nconsidered in a Main Committee and in plenary\r\nmeeting, a delegation should, as far as possible,\r\nexplain its vote only once, i.e., either in the\r\nCommittee or in plenary meeting, unless that\r\ndelegation’s vote in plenary meeting is different\r\nfrom the vote in the Committee.”\r\nMay I remind delegations that, also in accordance\r\nwith General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations\r\nof vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made\r\nby delegations from their seats.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the\r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the Fifth\r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that\r\nwe are going to proceed to take decisions in the same\r\nmanner as was done in the Fifth Committee, unless\r\nnotified otherwise in advance. I should also hope that\r\nwe may proceed to adopt without a vote those\r\nrecommendations that were adopted without a vote in\r\nthe Fifth Committee.\r\nAgenda item 108\r\nProgramme budget for the biennium 2004-2005\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/59/448)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill take a decision on the draft resolution\r\nrecommended by the Fifth Committee in paragraph 7\r\nof its report. The draft resolution is entitled “Estimates\r\nin respect of special political missions, good offices\r\nand other political initiatives authorized by the General\r\nAssembly and/or the Security Council: United Nations\r\nsupport to the Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed Commission”.\r\nThe Fifth Committee adopted the draft resolution\r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution\r\n59/12).\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of\r\nagenda item 108.\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.46\r\nAgenda item 123\r\nAdministrative and budgetary aspects of the\r\nfinancing of the United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/59/532)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill take a decision on the draft decision recommended\r\nby the Fifth Committee in paragraph 7 of its report.\r\nThe Fifth Committee adopted the draft decision\r\nwithout a vote.

Committee\r\n(A/59/250)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In paragraph\r\n1 (a) of the report, the General Committee recommends\r\nto the General Assembly that an additional item\r\nentitled “Andean Zone of Peace” be included in the\r\nagenda of the current session under heading A —\r\nMaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto include this item in the agenda of the current session\r\nunder heading A?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In paragraph\r\n1 (b), the General Committee further recommends that\r\nthe item be considered directly in plenary meeting.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto consider this item directly in plenary meeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I should like to\r\ninform members that the item entitled “Andean Zone\r\nof Peace” becomes item 161 on the agenda of the\r\ncurrent session.\r\nIn paragraph 2 (a) of the report, the General\r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that\r\nthe item entitled “Observer status for the South Asian\r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation in the General\r\nAssembly” be included in the agenda of the current\r\nsession under heading I — Organizational,\r\nadministrative and other matters.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto include this item in the agenda of the current session\r\nunder heading I?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In paragraph\r\n2 (b), the General Committee further recommends that\r\nthe item be allocated to the Sixth Committee.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto allocate this item to the Sixth Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I should like to\r\ninform members that the item entitled “Observer status\r\nfor the South Asian Association for Regional\r\nCooperation in the General Assembly” becomes item\r\n162 on the agenda of the current session.\r\nThe Chairman of the Sixth Committee will be\r\ninformed of the decision just taken by the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nIn paragraph 3 (a) of the report, the General\r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that\r\nan additional sub-item entitled “Election of a member\r\nof the International Court of Justice” be included as a\r\nsub-item of agenda item 15, “Election to fill vacancies\r\nin principal organs” under heading I — Organizational,\r\nadministrative and other matters.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto include this additional sub-item in the agenda of the\r\ncurrent session as a sub-item of agenda item 15 under\r\nheading I?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In paragraph\r\n3 (b), the General Committee further recommends that\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.46\r\nthis additional sub-item be considered directly in\r\nplenary meeting.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto consider this sub-item directly in plenary meeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I should like to\r\ninform members that the new sub-item becomes sub-\r\nitem (c) of agenda item 15 on the agenda of the current\r\nsession.\r\nIn paragraph 4 (a) of the report, the General\r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that\r\nthe item entitled “The situation in the occupied\r\nterritories of Azerbaijan” be included in the agenda of\r\nthe current session under heading A — Maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe representative of Armenia has asked for the\r\nfloor.\r\nI would first like to recall for members rule 23 of\r\nthe rules of procedure, which provides that:\r\n“Debate on the inclusion of an item in the\r\nagenda, when that item has been recommended\r\nfor inclusion by the General Committee, shall be\r\nlimited to three speakers in favour of, and three\r\nagainst, the inclusion.”\r\nI should like to stress that at this time we are not\r\ndiscussing the substance of any item.\r\nMr. Martirosyan (Armenia): We are facing a\r\nsituation today where an attempt is being made to\r\nintroduce a new agenda item, using procedural\r\nloopholes and under the pretext of urgency, in the\r\nabsence of factual evidence.\r\nThe General Committee, despite the fact that a\r\nnumber of General Committee members objected to the\r\ninclusion of that item based on valid concerns for the\r\nintegrity of the peace process, was forced to take a vote\r\nat the demand of Azerbaijan, thus breaking a several-\r\ndecades-long tradition of consensus in the General\r\nCommittee.\r\nThose representatives who spoke in the\r\nCommittee in favour of Azerbaijan’s proposal, all\r\nrepresenting the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference (OIC), supported the request based on their\r\nmembership in that respected organization. However, I\r\nwould like to emphasize that the Nagorny Karabakh\r\nconflict has no religious connotations. Attempts by\r\nAzerbaijan to artificially add a religious dimension to a\r\npolitical conflict are inadmissible and dangerous.\r\nMy country has always believed in, and acted in\r\nthe spirit of, the dialogue among civilizations. As one\r\nof the oldest Christian nations, we have made our own\r\nmodest contribution to the promotion of that dialogue\r\nby strengthening our centuries-old friendly ties with\r\nmany Muslim nations.\r\nWe are thankful to those OIC members who made\r\ntheir judgement based on the specificities of the\r\nsituation. I should like to appeal to those OIC members\r\npresent in this Hall to consider the issue from the\r\nperspective of its substance, roots and causes, rather\r\nthan on the basis of religious affiliation.\r\nLet me highlight several key points that I believe\r\nare crucial in the consideration of this issue. First,\r\nthere is no urgent situation that could justify the\r\nAzerbaijanis’ request to include a new item in the\r\nagenda of the current session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe memorandum attached to the Azerbaijani request\r\nprovides no factual information of any kind and is\r\ncertainly not of any urgent character. On the contrary,\r\nthe reasons offered to justify the request are totally\r\nfabricated and misrepresent the actual situation on the\r\nground.\r\nThe former autonomous region of Nagorny\r\nKarabakh has always been, and continues to be,\r\nArmenian-populated. There has therefore been no\r\nchange in the demographic situation there. As far as\r\nthe so-called settlements are concerned, there is no\r\nofficial policy of any kind by any official body to settle\r\nthe territories that came under the control of local\r\nArmenian forces.\r\nThis conflict has created refugees on both sides.\r\nBefore the conflict began, according to the last Soviet\r\nAzerbaijani census, there were more than 400,000\r\nArmenians living in Azerbaijan’s major cities, far from\r\nthe fighting. There were all forcibly driven out of their\r\nhomes and became refugees.\r\nThere are no Armenians in Azerbaijan today.\r\nThey became refugees and were given the chance to\r\nreturn to Nagorny Karabakh proper — and only\r\nKarabakh, which has always been overwhelmingly\r\nArmenian.\r\nThe Azerbaijani Government can make all sorts\r\nof accusations and can try to make use of the word\r\n“settlement”, which is loaded with connotations related\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.46\r\nto other conflicts. But they are alone in that exercise.\r\nNo observer, rapporteur or official — no one — who\r\nhas been to the region has raised the issue of illegal\r\nsettlements.\r\nAs for the territories surrounding Nagorny\r\nKarabakh, they have come under the control of\r\nNagorny Karabakh Armenians as a result of the war\r\nunleashed by Azerbaijan in an attempt to stifle the\r\npeaceful efforts of the people of Nagorny Karabakh to\r\nachieve self-determination. Today, Azerbaijan is trying\r\nto sell itself as a victim in the eyes of the international\r\ncommunity. But it is a victim of the aggressive policies\r\nand actions carried out by its own Government.\r\nThe people of Nagorny Karabakh responded to\r\nthe military onslaught in the same way as any other\r\npeople would: they defended their lives, their families,\r\ntheir homes and their land. At present, those\r\nterritories —\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I give the floor\r\nto the representative of Azerbaijan on a point of order.\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): I would like to refer to\r\nyour earlier statement, Mr. President, that all\r\nstatements in favour of or objecting to the\r\nrecommendation of the General Committee should be\r\nprocedural, not substantive. The representative of\r\nArmenia is touching on the substance of the question.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I give the floor\r\nto the representative of Armenia.\r\nMr. Martirosyan (Armenia): Rule 23 of the rules\r\nof procedure states that debate on the inclusion of an\r\nitem on the agenda “shall be limited to three speakers\r\nin favour of, and three against, the inclusion”. I am\r\nspeaking against.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I give the floor\r\nto the representative of Azerbaijan.\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): The day before\r\nyesterday, the General Committee decided to\r\nrecommend to the General Assembly that the item —\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I give the floor\r\nto the representative of Armenia on a point of order.\r\nMr. Martirosyan (Armenia): I have not yet\r\nfinished my statement. I ask for permission to complete\r\nit.\r\nThose territories currently serve as a buffer zone\r\nbetween Nagorny Karabakh and Armenia, since the\r\nconflict has not yet been settled. A 10-year self-\r\nmaintained ceasefire is holding, without a single\r\npeacekeeper on the ground separating the conflicting\r\nforces. The ceasefire is holding because of the military\r\nbalance, an indispensable component of which are\r\nterritories. There is regular monthly monitoring by the\r\nPersonal Representative of the current Chairman of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and his\r\nteam. His reports are presented to the broad OIC\r\nmembership. No incident or event of an urgent\r\ncharacter that would constitute a dangerous\r\ndevelopment has been observed or reported.\r\nThe Nagorny Karabakh peace process has picked\r\nup some speed over the past year. The package of\r\nissues under consideration covers the status of Nagorny\r\nKarabakh, security arrangements, territories, refugees\r\nand internally displaced persons, communications and\r\nthe lifting of the blockade. None of these tough,\r\ncomplex problems can be considered and finally\r\nresolved individually — separate from the package.\r\nExperience of the peace negotiations within the Minsk\r\nGroup from 1990 to 1997 explicitly demonstrated that\r\nit will be impossible to reach a final agreement on\r\nissues of mutual withdrawal from the territories in the\r\nabsence of a clear understanding on the final status of\r\nNagorny Karabakh.\r\nThe current attempts by Azerbaijan amount to the\r\ncreation of a parallel process, which would be\r\ndamaging to the prospects for peace and the resolution\r\nof the conflict. Armenia is committed to the\r\nnegotiations within the Minsk Group and stands ready\r\nto work constructively with the co-Chairmen towards a\r\ncomprehensive solution to the Nagorny Karabakh\r\nconflict. At the same time, I am authorized to state that\r\nif Azerbaijan separates individual components from the\r\ncomprehensive package, it should negotiate those\r\ncomponents directly with Nagorny Karabakh. That\r\nwould be in accordance with various Security Council\r\nresolutions that Azerbaijan tends to refer to selectively,\r\nwithout itself complying with the provisions.\r\nI would like to ask all Member States to take\r\naction against the request by Azerbaijan for the\r\ninclusion of this new agenda item.\r\nTwo days ago, while concluding the meeting of\r\nthe General Committee, you, Sir, announced that the\r\nagenda item would be considered under the heading\r\n“Maintenance of international peace and security”.\r\nThat is exactly the perspective from which we need to\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.46\r\nlook at this issue and make our judgement. The\r\nargument of urgency was brought up for the inclusion\r\nof a new agenda item. Yet there was no factual\r\njustification presented. During the past several days we\r\nheard the argument that this is a procedural issue. Yet\r\nthis so-called procedural issue may endanger the peace\r\nprocess, threatening the relative peace and stability in\r\nthe region, as explicitly acknowledged by several\r\ndelegations. In the face of this potential danger, I\r\ncannot but pose this question to the General Assembly:\r\nwho is going to bear the responsibility for the possible\r\nimplications of such so-called procedural issues?\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I would like to\r\nstress that we are not currently debating the substance\r\nof any question.\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): I would like first of all\r\nto draw the attention of the General Assembly to the\r\nfact that the statement by the Armenian Ambassador\r\nhas now clearly demonstrated that there is a major,\r\nacute problem between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and it\r\nshould be treated properly by this House.\r\nAnother accusation was made with regard to the\r\ncountries of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference (OIC). I would like to remind our\r\nArmenian colleague that the OIC is not a religious, but\r\na political organization, represented and respected\r\nacross a broad cultural and geographical spectrum.\r\nThe day before yesterday, the General Committee\r\ndecided to recommend, with no objection — I\r\nunderline the fact that there was no objection — to the\r\nGeneral Assembly that the item entitled “The situation\r\nin the occupied territories of Azerbaijan” be included\r\nin the agenda of this session. That decision by the\r\nGeneral Committee reconfirms that Azerbaijan’s\r\nrequest is legitimate and fully in line with the Charter,\r\nin particular with paragraph 2 of Article 11, in\r\naccordance with which the General Assembly may\r\ndiscuss any questions relating to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security brought before it by\r\nany Member of the United Nations, as well as Article\r\n14, in accordance with which the General Assembly\r\nmay recommend measures for the adjustment of any\r\nsituation, regardless of its origin, which it deems likely\r\nto impair the general welfare or friendly relations\r\namong nations.\r\nThe General Assembly is the chief deliberative,\r\npolicy-making and representative organ of the United\r\nNations. The very purpose of this house, as designed\r\nby its founders, is to serve as a forum for open debate\r\nand discussion on any issue. The Charter gives us, like\r\nany other Member State, the right to raise questions of\r\nvital importance to the security, sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of our country. We are ready for\r\nopen debate and discussion and believe no one has\r\nanything to hide. This delegation is certain that each\r\nand every member of the United Nations has the right\r\nto speak out and to be heard. Otherwise, what is the\r\nsense of being a member of the United Nations? We are\r\nconvinced that the General Assembly, upholding the\r\nletter and the spirit of the United Nations Charter, will\r\napprove the General Committee’s recommendation\r\ncontained in paragraph four of document\r\nA/59/250/Add.3.\r\nMr. Cengizer (Turkey): When the issue of the\r\ninclusion of an additional item on the agenda of the\r\nfifty-ninth session of the General Assembly, entitled\r\n“The situation in the occupied territories of\r\nAzerbaijan”, was discussed in the General Committee\r\nonly two days ago, no member of the Committee, nor\r\nany other member who took the floor, objected to the\r\nright of a Member State to raise before this Assembly\r\nmatters relating to the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity. That was the underlying reasoning of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) from the\r\nvery start.\r\nThe international community is aware that the\r\nsituation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan has\r\nnot shown any progress for more than 10 years now.\r\nWe within the OIC, like other interested parties, also\r\nsupport the efforts of the Minsk Group, and especially\r\nthe Prague Process, aimed at a peaceful resolution of\r\nthe conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\r\nHowever, unless we achieve due awareness in\r\ninternational public opinion of the frustration felt by\r\nthose who, on a daily basis, still have to go through the\r\nstrain caused by that long-standing conflict, we will\r\nrisk relegating the issue, as well, to the realm of so-\r\ncalled frozen conflicts.\r\nIt is time, therefore, that the General Assembly\r\naddress this issue in earnest in the framework of the\r\nrelevant United Nations Security Council resolutions,\r\nwhich emphasize the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan.\r\nBy doing so, we will also remain true to the spirit and\r\nletter of the relevant articles of our Charter, which\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.46\r\naccords to us certain responsibilities in matters relating\r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nWe sincerely hope that an honest, open and\r\nforthcoming debate of this issue will serve the cause of\r\na just and viable settlement of this conflict, which has\r\nbeleaguered the region for many years, so that all the\r\npeoples of the region can begin to look forward to\r\nmutual understanding, cooperation and shared\r\nachievements in this new century.\r\nMr. Khalid (Pakistan): Azerbaijan has requested\r\nthe inclusion of a new agenda item entitled “The\r\nsituation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan”, in\r\nthe agenda of the fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly. Pakistan believes that any Member State has\r\nthe right to request consideration of an issue that it\r\ndeems important. The Charter specifically provides,\r\nunder paragraph 2 of Article 11, that the General\r\nAssembly, “may discuss any questions relating to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security\r\nbrought before it by any Member of the United\r\nNations”. And article 14 provides that the General\r\nAssembly may recommend measures for the peaceful\r\nadjustment of any situation, regardless of origin, which\r\nit deems likely to impair the general welfare or friendly\r\nrelations among nations. Thus, the General Assembly\r\nhas the Charter-granted responsibility to consider such\r\nissues.\r\nOn 27 October, the General Committee decided\r\nand recommended that this issue be included in the\r\nagenda of the General Assembly’s current session.\r\nAccording to our understanding, it is the General\r\nCommittee’s prerogative to decide on the procedure to\r\nbe followed. While we feel that the procedural issue\r\nhas already been decided by the General Committee,\r\nthe General Assembly may also endorse the decision of\r\nthe General Committee. Pakistan supports the inclusion\r\nof this agenda item on the agenda of the fifty-ninth\r\nsession.\r\nMr. Hamburger (Netherlands): I have the\r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The\r\ncandidate countries Bulgaria, Romania, and Croatia,\r\nthe countries of the Stabilization and Association\r\nProcess and potential candidates Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, The former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia and Serbia and Montenegro, and the\r\nEuropean Free Trade Association countries Iceland,\r\nLiechtenstein and Norway, members of the European\r\nEconomic Area, align themselves with this statement.\r\nAs members of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), the countries of the\r\nEuropean Union support the continuous efforts of the\r\nMinsk Group toward a peaceful settlement of the\r\nNagorno-Karabakh conflict. The recent meetings\r\nbetween the Foreign Ministers of Armenia and\r\nAzerbaijan, which took place regularly in Prague this\r\nyear, have lead to productive discussions. Those\r\ndiscussions have given a strong impetus to the\r\nnegotiations. In September in Astana, the Co-Chairs of\r\nthe Minsk Group presented to the Presidents of\r\nArmenia and Azerbaijan their assessment of the\r\nsituation and a road map for the continuation of\r\nnegotiations. They are now awaiting a reply.\r\nThe European Union countries are of the opinion\r\nthat such a promising process, which is being handled\r\nwithin the Organization for Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe, should be allowed to develop without\r\ninterference. We understand the concerns of the\r\ndelegation of Azerbaijan, but we believe that this\r\nsession is neither the time, nor the venue, to pursue\r\nthis, and that the Azerbaijan initiative may jeopardize\r\nthe ongoing negotiations.\r\nThere was no unanimity in the General\r\nCommittee on the inclusion of the issue of Nagorno-\r\nKarabakh on the agenda, and the European Union\r\nwould have preferred that the issue had not been voted\r\nfor recommendation to the General Assembly.\r\nHowever, in light of all those considerations, the\r\nEuropean Union will abstain on the vote on this agenda\r\nitem.\r\nMr. Duclos (France) (spoke in French): Indeed\r\nmany speakers have referred to the Minsk Group and I\r\nthink it is quite legitimate and desirable from the point\r\nof view of the members of this Assembly that the\r\nposition of the Chairs of the Minsk Group be stated,\r\nand so I am speaking on behalf of them, that is, on\r\nbehalf of the Russian Federation, the United States and\r\nFrance. However, I have confined my comments to the\r\nfollowing procedural points.\r\nFirst, the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) is dealing with this\r\nquestion and has been doing so for a long time. It has\r\nbeen doing so in a serious-minded and active manner,\r\nparticularly within the Minsk Group. I will refer to one\r\nexample. The Minsk Group recently took the initiative\r\nof holding the Prague Process. The Prague Process\r\nconsists of meetings between the Foreign Ministers of\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.46\r\nAzerbaijan and Armenia, which has already lead to\r\nproductive discussions between the parties.\r\nAt the Astana meeting of the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States a month ago, the Minsk Group\r\nproposed an assessment of the situation and is awaiting\r\ncomments from the parties. Today, Azerbaijan has\r\nvoiced specific concerns regarding the situation in\r\nNagorno-Karabakh. We believe that those concerns can\r\nbe fully addressed within the format and according to\r\nthe procedures that already exist.\r\nSecondly, the introduction of a new item on the\r\nagenda of the General Assembly could have two\r\nnegative consequences. First, in light of the situation\r\nthat we have described, it would be harmful to efforts\r\nto find a just, lasting settlement to that problem,\r\nparticularly at this juncture. Secondly, it would make it\r\nimpossible to obtain consensus and could therefore be\r\ncounterproductive. We suggest that we avoid creating\r\nsuch a situation.\r\nThirdly, we have no doubt as to the sincerity of\r\nthe delegation of Azerbaijan when it states its\r\nconcerns, but we do not believe that this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is the right time or the right forum\r\nto assume this task.\r\nFourthly, we urge the parties to consider the\r\npossibility of a fact-finding mission of the OSCE as\r\none option for addressing this question.\r\nFinally, again from a procedural perspective, we\r\nare not convinced that this question meets the criteria\r\nof urgency and importance, as spelled out in Article 15.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): A recorded\r\nvote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Antigua and Barbuda,\r\nAzerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh,\r\nBarbados, Brunei Darussalam, Comoros, Cuba,\r\nDjibouti, Guyana, Honduras, Indonesia, Iran\r\n(Islamic Republic of), Jamaica, Kazakhstan,\r\nKyrgyzstan, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Malaysia,\r\nMaldives, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco,\r\nMyanmar, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan,\r\nRepublic of Moldova, Saudi Arabia, Somalia,\r\nSudan, Suriname, Togo, Turkey, Turkmenistan,\r\nUkraine, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan,\r\nYemen\r\nAgainst:\r\nArmenia, Gambia\r\nAbstaining:\r\nAlgeria, Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria,\r\nBelgium, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso,\r\nBurundi, Cameroon, Canada, Cape Verde, Central\r\nAfrican Republic, Chile, China, Colombia,\r\nCongo, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech\r\nRepublic, Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nDenmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt,\r\nEl Salvador, Estonia, Ethiopia, Finland, France,\r\nGhana, Greece, Guatemala, Hungary, Iceland,\r\nIndia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kenya,\r\nKuwait, Latvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia,\r\nLiechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg,\r\nMadagascar, Malta, Mauritius, Micronesia\r\n(Federated States of), Monaco, Namibia, Nepal,\r\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway,\r\nPanama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland,\r\nPortugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian\r\nFederation, Rwanda, Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines, San Marino, Sao Tome and Principe,\r\nSerbia and Montenegro, Sierra Leone, Singapore,\r\nSlovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, Spain, Sri\r\nLanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-\r\nLeste, Tonga, United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\nand Northern Ireland, United Republic of\r\nTanzania, United States of America, Vanuatu,\r\nVenezuela\r\nBy 42 votes to 2, with 99 abstentions, the General\r\nAssembly decided to include the item on its\r\nagenda.\r\n[Subsequently, the delegation of the Gambia\r\ninformed the Secretariat that it had intended to\r\nvote in favour; the delegations of Germany and\r\nUruguay informed the Secretariat that they had\r\nintended to abstain.]\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In paragraph\r\n4 (b), the General Committee further recommends that\r\nthe item be considered directly in plenary.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto consider the item directly in plenary?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I should like to\r\ninform members that the item entitled “The situation in\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.46\r\nthe occupied territories of Azerbaijan” becomes item\r\n163 on the agenda of the current session.\r\nIn paragraph 5 of the same document, the General\r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that\r\nagenda item 36, “The situation in the Middle East”,\r\nand agenda item 37, “Question of Palestine”, be\r\nconsidered separately.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto consider agenda item 36, “The situation in the\r\nMiddle East”, and agenda item 37, “Question of\r\nPalestine”, separately?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I call on the\r\nrepresentative of Israel.\r\nMr. Cohen (Israel): Allow me to express my\r\ndisappointment over the decision of the General\r\nCommittee to recommend that the Assembly split its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 36, on the situation in the\r\nMiddle East, and item 37 on the question of Palestine,\r\nwhich had been scheduled, according to a previous\r\ndecision, to be considered jointly. Progress demands\r\nefficiency and this is simply not a decision built on\r\nefficiency.\r\nJust a few weeks ago, this Assembly held a joint\r\ndebate on agenda item 52, “Revitalization of the work\r\nof the General Assembly”, and agenda item 54,\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations system”. Those\r\ninitiatives, as well as others, such as those set out in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration, call for a more efficient\r\napproach to our work whereby redundancies and\r\nduplicate processes are eliminated. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral wrote in “Strengthening of the United Nations:\r\nan agenda for further change”, the General Assembly\r\n“considers far too many overlapping items, and\r\nwith a frequency that is often not merited”\r\n(A/57/387, para. 16).\r\nGreat improvements are possible, however, if\r\nduplicative items can be combined and closely-related\r\nissues clustered into a single discussion, leading to\r\noutcomes of greater policy relevance and impact.\r\nIn many areas, those goals are being\r\nimplemented. For example, it was an efficient decision\r\nthis year to jointly consider agenda item 11, “Report of\r\nthe Security Council”, and agenda item 53, “Question\r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters”. It is unfortunate, however, that one of the\r\nonly subjects that is immune from streamlining,\r\nrevitalization and reform is the Arab-Israeli conflict. A\r\ntotal of 20 General Assembly meetings were devoted to\r\nIsrael at the fifty-eighth session. By way of contrast,\r\nnone was devoted to world hunger and only two were\r\ndevoted to HIV/AIDS. That does not do the credibility\r\nand reputation of the United Nations any good, nor\r\ndoes it help the General Assembly to play a\r\nconstructive role in world affairs, including in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nAs we have amply demonstrated over the years,\r\nwe are quite willing to debate the issues presented by\r\nour region’s difficult situation. At least by streamlining\r\nthe debate, however, we could have addressed the\r\nissues in a more determined, more serious and more\r\neffective manner. It is for that reason that we believe\r\nthe decision of the General Committee is imprudent\r\nand contrary to the goals of revitalization and reform\r\nthat should guide the work of this body in all its\r\naspects. Rather than break the consensus, however, we\r\nmerely dissociate ourselves from this decision.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of the\r\nfourth report of the General Committee.\r\nAgenda item 15 (continued)\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs:\r\n(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic\r\nand Social Council\r\nThe President (spoke in French): As members\r\nwill recall, when the 45th plenary meeting was\r\nadjourned yesterday, there still remained two seats to\r\nbe filled: one from among the Eastern European States\r\nand one from among the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, we shall proceed now to the third round of\r\nballoting, by secret ballot, for the two remaining seats.\r\nThe third round of balloting shall be restricted to\r\nthe two States from among the Eastern European States\r\nthat were not elected in the previous ballot, namely\r\nAlbania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia, and to the two States from among the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States that were not elected in\r\nthe previous ballot, namely Costa Rica and Venezuela.\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.46\r\nThat is in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of\r\nprocedure.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like\r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the\r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no\r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a\r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process.\r\nBallot papers marked “C” and “D” will now be\r\ndistributed.\r\nMay I ask representatives to write on the ballot\r\npapers the names of the States for which they wish to\r\nvote. Ballot papers marked “C” for the Eastern\r\nEuropean States will be declared invalid if they contain\r\nthe name of a State other than Albania or the Former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia or if they contain the\r\nnames of more than one State. Ballot papers marked\r\n“D” for the Latin American and Caribbean States will\r\nbe declared invalid if they contain the name of a State\r\nother than Costa Rica or Venezuela or if they contain\r\nthe names of more than one State.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Ms. Ioannou\r\n(Cyprus), Mr. Seyoum (Eritrea), Mr. Mallia\r\n(Malta), Mr. Micanek (Czech Republic),\r\nMs. Fricot (Saint Lucia) and Mr. Realini\r\n(Monaco) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 11.15 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 11.55 a.m.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The result of\r\nthe voting is as follows:\r\nGroup C — Eastern European States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 172\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 172\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of members voting: 171\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 114\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nAlbania 118\r\nThe former Yugoslav Republic\r\nof Macedonia 53\r\nGroup D — Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 172\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 172\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of members voting: 171\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 114\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nCosta Rica 112\r\nVenezuela 59\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority,\r\nAlbania was elected a member of the Economic\r\nand Social Council for a three-year term\r\nbeginning 1 January 2005.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): There still\r\nremains one seat to be filled from among the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States.\r\nWe shall therefore proceed to a third restricted\r\nballot. This fourth round of balloting shall be restricted\r\nto the two States from among the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States that were not elected but that\r\nobtained the largest number of votes in the previous\r\nballot, namely Costa Rica and Venezuela. That is in\r\naccordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like\r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the\r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no\r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a\r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process.\r\nBallot papers marked “D” will now be\r\ndistributed.\r\nMay I ask representatives to write on the ballot\r\npapers the name of the State for which they wish to\r\nvote. Ballot papers marked “D” for the Latin American\r\nand Caribbean States will be declared invalid if they\r\ncontain the name of a State other than Costa Rica or\r\nVenezuela or if they contain the names of more than\r\none State.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Ms. Ioannou\r\n(Cyprus), Mr. Seyoum (Eritrea), Mr. Mallia\r\n(Malta), Mr. Micanek (Czech Republic),\r\nMs. Fricot (Saint Lucia) and Mr. Realini\r\n(Monaco) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 12.10 p.m. and\r\nresumed at 12.30 p.m.\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.46\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The result of\r\nthe voting is as follows:\r\nGroup D — Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 173\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 172\r\nAbstentions: 2\r\nNumber of members voting: 170\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 114\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nCosta Rica 130\r\nVenezuela 40\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority,\r\nCosta Rica was elected a member of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council for a three-year\r\nterm beginning 1 January 2005.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The following\r\n18 States have thus been elected members of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council for a three-year term\r\nbeginning on 1 January 2005: Albania, Australia,\r\nBrazil, Chad, China, Costa Rica, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Denmark, Guinea, Iceland,\r\nIndia, Lithuania, Mexico, Pakistan, the Russian\r\nFederation, South Africa, Thailand and the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nI congratulate those States which have been\r\nelected members of the Economic and Social Council,\r\nand I thank the tellers for their assistance in this\r\nelection.\r\nThis concludes our consideration of sub-item (b)\r\nof agenda item 15.\r\nBefore adjourning the meeting, I should like to\r\nremind members that, at its 2nd plenary meeting, on\r\n17 September 2004, the General Assembly decided\r\nthat, during the final two weeks of Ramadan, from\r\nMonday, 1 November 2004, to Thursday, 11 November\r\n2004, the hours of plenary meetings and of meetings of\r\nthe Main Committees would be from 9.30 a.m. to 12.30\r\np.m. and from 2.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. at the latest.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.35 p.m.\r\n"
