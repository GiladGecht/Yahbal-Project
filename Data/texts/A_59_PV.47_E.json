(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.45 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 14\r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nreport of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (A/59/295)\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.18)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I invite\r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, to introduce the\r\nreport of the Agency for the year 2003.\r\nMr. ElBaradei (International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency: Every year brings new challenges and\r\nopportunities, and the past 12 months at the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have\r\nbeen no exception. The outlook for nuclear power is\r\nevolving, with increasing attention to its benefits as an\r\nenvironmentally clean source of electricity, but with\r\nconcerns remaining related to waste disposal, safety\r\nand security. Nuclear applications in human health,\r\nagriculture and other fields are increasingly\r\ncontributing to global sustainable development\r\ninitiatives and the Agency has redoubled its efforts to\r\nsupport those initiatives by improving the efficiency\r\nand extending the reach of its Technical Cooperation\r\nProgramme. Global cooperation in matters of safety\r\nand security has resulted in sustained improvements\r\noverall, but there is still much to be done. In the area of\r\nverification, the Agency’s activities remain at the\r\ncentre of efforts to curb nuclear proliferation and we\r\nhave continued to prove our ability to implement\r\nobjective and credible safeguards, but the international\r\ncommunity still faces a number of difficult challenges\r\nand has intensified its focus on how to strengthen the\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime. Today, I welcome\r\nthis opportunity to review with you some of the\r\nAgency’s work in each of these areas.\r\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of\r\ncivilian nuclear power. With 439 nuclear reactors\r\nworldwide, nuclear energy continues to account for\r\nabout 16 per cent of the world’s electricity production,\r\nkeeping pace with the steady growth in the global\r\nelectricity market.\r\nNear-term growth in nuclear capacity remains\r\ncentred in Asia and Eastern Europe owing to a\r\ncombination of factors, including the rise in demand\r\nfor electricity, the existence of a well developed\r\nindustrial infrastructure in those regions and the lack of\r\nindigenous alternatives in some countries.\r\nOver the longer term, it is clear that the need for\r\nsustained human development will require a substantial\r\ninvestment in energy generation in the coming decades.\r\nGiven its capacity for emissions-free electricity\r\ngeneration, nuclear energy has strong potential as a\r\nreliable baseline energy source. However, the degree to\r\nwhich nuclear energy is used will be shaped by the way\r\na given nation balances the risks associated with a\r\nnuclear accident against other risks — such as air\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\npollution or energy dependence. Clearly, not every\r\ncountry shares the view that improvements in the cost-\r\neffectiveness and safety performance of nuclear power\r\nwarrant its revival. Those are matters of complexity\r\nand legitimate debate and IAEA will continue its\r\nefforts to provide comprehensible, accurate\r\ninformation to ensure that the benefits and risks of\r\nnuclear technology are clearly and fairly understood.\r\nIAEA also continues to encourage and stimulate\r\ntechnological innovation related to power reactors,\r\nresearch reactors and other parts of the nuclear fuel\r\ncycle, in order to address concerns related to safety,\r\nproliferation and waste disposal. More than 20 IAEA\r\nmember States are currently involved in projects\r\nrelated to new reactor and fuel cycle designs.\r\nRegarding the long-term management of spent\r\nfuel and radioactive waste, progress continues to be\r\nslow, but steady. More than 50 countries now have\r\nspent nuclear fuel, including fuel from research\r\nreactors, stored in temporary sites awaiting disposal or\r\nreprocessing. At the Stockholm International\r\nConference on Geological Repositories held in\r\nDecember 2003, experts agreed that the majority of\r\ntechnological issues have been satisfactorily addressed,\r\nbut that social issues — such as public acceptance and\r\npolitical endorsement — are still problematic. IAEA\r\nhas been assisting many of its member States in\r\ndeveloping nuclear waste management and disposal\r\nstrategies and I am pleased to report a renewed interest\r\nin multinational approaches to spent fuel management\r\nand disposal.\r\nA major part of the IAEA’s scientific and\r\ntechnical work involves the transfer of peaceful nuclear\r\ntechnology in a variety of fields. Many of those\r\napplications are proving important tools for social and\r\neconomic development. An excellent example is the\r\napplication of nuclear technology to one of the basic\r\nelements in human survival: the food supply chain.\r\nOver the past four decades, the use of isotopes and\r\nradiation in food and agricultural research and\r\ndevelopment has yielded rich results: there are now\r\nmillions of hectares of higher-yielding crops all over\r\nthe world; disease-resistant plants, developed with\r\nradiation-induced mutation, provide economic benefits\r\nworth billions of dollars every year to the world’s\r\nfarmers; improvements in livestock production and\r\nhealth have been realized; and the control and\r\neradication of many insect pests has been made\r\npossible through radiation sterilization techniques.\r\nAnother crucial factor in development is access to\r\nsafe drinking water — a basic necessity unavailable to\r\nmore than one sixth of the world’s population. Isotope\r\nhydrology is being used in a broad variety of IAEA\r\nprojects to map underground aquifers, detect and\r\ncontrol pollution and monitor the safety of dams.\r\nAnother key area of IAEA work relates to human\r\nhealth, including our efforts to combat the growing\r\ncancer threat in the developing world. Of the estimated\r\n260 million new cancer cases expected in the next 20\r\nyears, approximately 175 million will require radiation\r\ntherapy, and 100 million of those will be in developing\r\ncountries that have neither the resources nor the\r\nexpertise to deal with that impending crisis. The\r\nAgency has been working with the World Health\r\nOrganization (WHO) and other partners to provide the\r\ntraining, expert missions and equipment needed to\r\nsupport national and regional cancer therapy\r\nprogrammes. But the size of the problem far outstrips\r\nour resources, and we have launched the Programme of\r\nAction for Cancer Therapy (PACT) to attract additional\r\nfunding and resources from both governmental and\r\nnon-governmental sources.\r\nThe IAEA’s technical cooperation programme\r\nprovides roughly $80 million of assistance per year in\r\nthese and other fields and is a principal mechanism for\r\nimplementing the Agency’s basic mission: “Atoms for\r\nPeace”. As more developing countries become member\r\nStates, the number of countries that benefit from\r\nassistance under the technical cooperation programme\r\ncontinues to grow. This year, we have an all time high\r\nof 111 member States participating in national, regional\r\nand interregional projects. To ensure the effectiveness\r\nof technical cooperation strategies, the IAEA\r\nsecretariat develops thematic plans to highlight nuclear\r\ntechnology benefits in key areas, assists States in\r\ndeveloping individually tailored country programme\r\nframeworks and ensures strong government\r\ncommitment to technical cooperation projects before\r\nthey are launched. And we continue to build and\r\nexpand partnerships with other international\r\norganizations and development partners, in some cases\r\ndrawing on their technical expertise to enhance the\r\nimpact of a nuclear technique.\r\nThe safety and security of nuclear activities\r\naround the globe remain key elements of the Agency’s\r\nmandate. Nearly two decades after the Chernobyl\r\naccident, it is gratifying to see that the Agency’s efforts\r\nhave been of tangible and sustained benefit, including:\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nour emphasis on defence in depth, risk management\r\nand international cooperation; our concerted drive to\r\nupgrade facilities with older design features; our\r\nassistance to developing member States in establishing\r\na solid radiation protection infrastructure; our emphasis\r\non safety and security in transport; and, particularly in\r\nrecent years, our dual focus on strengthening physical\r\nprotection at nuclear facilities and enhancing the\r\nsecurity of nuclear material and radioactive sources\r\nworldwide. Considerable progress has been achieved\r\nthrough those efforts. Nevertheless, the need to\r\nmaintain an effective and transparent global nuclear\r\nsafety and security regime remains a matter of high\r\npriority.\r\nThe development and adoption of legally binding\r\ninternational agreements has proven to be a powerful\r\nmechanism for enhancing safety worldwide. Since the\r\nChernobyl accident, four safety-related conventions\r\nhave been concluded under the IAEA’s auspices. The\r\nso-called early notification and assistance conventions\r\nserve to enhance international preparedness for, and\r\nresponse to, nuclear and radiological emergencies. The\r\nConvention on Nuclear Safety commits States parties\r\nto operate their nuclear power plants in accordance\r\nwith international benchmarks designed to maintain a\r\nhigh level of safety. And the Joint Convention on the\r\nSafety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of\r\nRadioactive Waste Management seeks to ensure that\r\nspent fuel and radioactive waste is managed and\r\ndisposed of in a manner that will protect people and the\r\nenvironment from radiological and other hazards.\r\nHowever, many States are not yet party to these\r\nconventions, and certain key areas of the nuclear fuel\r\ncycle are still not subject to conventions.\r\nThe process towards strengthening the\r\nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear\r\nMaterial (CPPNM) has made some progress. In July, at\r\nthe request of the Government of Austria and 24 co-\r\nsponsoring States, I circulated proposed amendments to\r\nthe CPPNM to all States parties. The aim of those\r\namendments, as proposed, is to extend the scope of the\r\nConvention to cover nuclear material used for peaceful\r\npurposes, not only in international transport and\r\nstorage but also in domestic transport, storage and use,\r\nas well as protection against sabotage of nuclear\r\nmaterial and facilities used for peaceful purposes.\r\nWhile consultations are ongoing to resolve a few\r\noutstanding issues, it is my hope that we can convene a\r\ndiplomatic conference early next year to amend the\r\nConvention and expand its scope. This is an important\r\npart of our efforts to enhance protection against nuclear\r\nand radiological terrorism.\r\nThe Agency promotes the acceptance of the\r\nentire corpus of IAEA safety standards as the global\r\nreference for protecting people and the environment\r\nagainst nuclear accidents and the harmful effects\r\nattributed to radiation exposure. We are making good\r\nprogress on the revision of those standards and on\r\nfilling in the remaining gaps in coverage. The\r\nestablishment of regional safety networks — such as\r\nthe Asian Nuclear Safety Network and the Ibero-\r\nAmerican Radiation Safety Network — will also\r\npromote the use of international safety standards and\r\nthe sharing of expertise on a more regional basis.\r\nThe IAEA’s safety review and appraisal services\r\nassist member States in the application of Agency\r\nsafety standards and provide useful feedback on their\r\neffectiveness. While those services originated\r\npredominantly in the field of nuclear installation safety,\r\nthey now extend to cover many areas of radiation,\r\nradioactive waste and transport safety as well. We are\r\nstill assisting some member States with safety upgrades\r\nat older installations with design vulnerabilities. As\r\nmore member States consider the extension of licences\r\nfor nuclear power reactors, we are also giving\r\nincreased attention to services that can identify and\r\naddress equipment ageing and relevant operational\r\nissues. And as we work towards the global acceptance\r\nof IAEA safety standards, safety reviews will be\r\nintegrated into fewer categories and focused\r\nincreasingly on the review of national self-assessments.\r\nIn the wake of the terrorist attacks of September\r\n2001, the IAEA moved swiftly to conduct a thorough\r\nreview of its existing programmes related to preventing\r\nacts of nuclear and radiological terrorism. The Agency\r\nhas sought to develop a comprehensive plan for\r\nupgrading nuclear security worldwide. Our work since\r\nthat time has been focused on measures to guard\r\nagainst thefts of nuclear and radioactive material and to\r\nprotect related facilities against malicious acts.\r\nAgency efforts to help member States improve\r\ntheir protection against nuclear and radiological\r\nterrorism are continuing at an exceptionally fast pace\r\non multiple fronts. In a relatively short span, much\r\nwork has been completed on assessing the security\r\nneeds of member States and providing necessary\r\ntraining. For example, since September 2001, working\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nin Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa, we have\r\nconducted more than 50 advisory and evaluation\r\nmissions and convened more than 60 training courses,\r\nworkshops and seminars. The IAEA also has\r\nstrengthened its cooperation on nuclear security issues\r\nwith other international organizations, including the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies, Interpol,\r\nEuropol, the Universal Postal Union and the World\r\nCustoms Organization, as well as the European\r\nCommission.\r\nWe have made significant progress in many\r\naspects of nuclear security, but much remains to be\r\ndone. While significant work remains on the\r\ndevelopment of international legal instruments, as well\r\nas relevant guidelines and recommendations, the\r\ngreatest emphasis is now being placed on addressing\r\nequipment needs and other tangible improvements and\r\non helping States take the steps needed to make their\r\nnuclear security programmes sustainable and self-\r\nreliant.\r\nThe IAEA has also been assisting member States\r\nin ensuring that their radioactive sources are safe and\r\nare either secured within their own countries or\r\nshipped back to suppliers. Information in the Agency\r\ndatabase on illicit trafficking makes it clear that a\r\nmarket continues to exist for obtaining and using\r\nradioactive sources for malicious purposes. We have\r\nbeen working with many countries to identify and\r\nsecure sources that are the most vulnerable and at the\r\nhighest risk. Those assistance efforts have been given\r\nhigh priority, and we expect the volume of those efforts\r\nto increase.\r\nThe verification challenges that the Agency has\r\nfaced in the past year further underscore the\r\nimportance of the Agency’s role in combating nuclear\r\nproliferation and the urgency of providing the Agency\r\nwith all the necessary means to perform its verification\r\nresponsibilities in an effective and credible manner.\r\nThe IAEA’s verification activities are designed to\r\nprovide assurance that nuclear material and facilities\r\nare used exclusively for peaceful purposes. In the early\r\n1990s, after the discovery of the clandestine nuclear-\r\nweapon programme in Iraq, the international\r\ncommunity committed itself to providing the Agency\r\nwith the authority to strengthen its verification\r\ncapability, using a mechanism referred to as the\r\nadditional protocol to provide assurance not only that\r\ndeclared nuclear material has not been diverted for\r\nnon-peaceful purposes, but equally important, that no\r\nundeclared nuclear material or activities exist.\r\nSince my report last year, the number of States\r\nwith additional protocols in force has increased\r\nappreciably, from 36 to 60. This broader authority,\r\nhowever, is still far from universal. One hundred\r\nthirty-three States remain without an additional\r\nprotocol in force, and 42 States parties to the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons still have\r\nnot even fulfilled their article-III obligation to bring\r\ninto force comprehensive safeguards agreements with\r\nthe Agency. I strongly urge all States that have not\r\ndone so to conclude and bring into force the required\r\nsafeguards agreements and additional protocols at an\r\nearly date.\r\nThe situation in the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea continues to pose a serious\r\nchallenge to the nuclear non-proliferation regime.\r\nSince December 2002, the Agency has not performed\r\nany verification activities in the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea and cannot therefore provide any\r\nlevel of assurance about the non-diversion of nuclear\r\nmaterial. We have continued to emphasize the need for\r\na comprehensive settlement of the Korean crisis\r\nthrough dialogue that addresses all the underlying\r\nissues, and it is my hope that the six-party talks will\r\nlead to such a settlement. I trust that any future\r\nsettlement will ensure, inter alia, the return of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to the nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation regime, and that the Agency will be\r\ngiven the necessary authority and resources to be able\r\nto fulfil its verification responsibilities in a credible\r\nmanner.\r\nThe Agency’s verification activities in the Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya over the course of this year have\r\nconfirmed that, for many years, the country pursued an\r\nundeclared nuclear programme which aimed at\r\nenriching uranium and which included the receipt of\r\nnuclear weapons design documents. Over many years,\r\nLibya failed to meet many of its obligations under its\r\nsafeguards agreement. However, last December, Libya\r\nrenounced its programmes for nuclear weapons and\r\nother weapons of mass destruction. In that connection,\r\nLibya has signed and implemented an additional\r\nprotocol and has actively cooperated with the IAEA’s\r\nefforts to verify its renunciation of its former nuclear-\r\nweapon programme. Our assessment to date is that\r\nLibya’s declarations of its past nuclear related\r\nactivities appear to be consistent with the information\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\navailable to, and verified by, the Agency. Further\r\ninvestigation is still needed, however, in order for the\r\nAgency to verify the completeness and correctness of\r\nLibya’s declarations of its nuclear activities. We will\r\ncontinue to pursue those questions as part of our\r\nroutine inspection activities in Libya.\r\nThe IAEA has continued to devote considerable\r\nattention to the implementation of safeguards in the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, and the IAEA Board of\r\nGovernors has adopted several resolutions relevant to\r\nIran’s former undeclared nuclear programme and its\r\nfailure, over an extended period of time, to meet many\r\nof its obligations under its safeguard agreement. The\r\nBoard has urged Iran, inter alia, to cooperate fully with\r\nthe Agency in the verification process. Since February\r\n2003, when the IAEA started its verification of Iran’s\r\nundeclared programme, the Agency has made steady\r\nprogress in understanding its nature and extent. Last\r\nDecember, Iran signed an additional protocol and has\r\nbeen acting as if the protocol were in force, pending its\r\nratification. Iran’s earlier interactions with the Agency\r\nwere regrettably marked by the provision of\r\ninformation that was at times changing, contradictory\r\nand slow in coming, a situation that led to repeated\r\nexpressions of concern by the Board. Iran’s\r\ncooperation since that time, however, has improved\r\nappreciably. IAEA inspectors have been provided\r\naccess to requested locations, and Iran has provided\r\ninformation requested by the Agency — although in\r\nsome cases Iran’s response has continued to be slow.\r\nAs a result of the Agency’s investigations, some\r\nissues have reached the point where any further follow-\r\nup needed will be carried out as part of routine\r\nsafeguards implementation. One issue remains central\r\nto understanding Iran’s nuclear programme, namely,\r\nthe extent and nature of its uranium enrichment\r\nactivities. Additional investigation is still ongoing, and\r\nI expect to be able to provide a comprehensive report\r\non progress to the IAEA Board of Governors later this\r\nmonth.\r\nAs of November of last year, the Board of\r\nGovernors has also asked the Agency to monitor Iran’s\r\nvoluntary suspension of enrichment related and\r\nreprocessing activities. However, Iran has reversed\r\nsome of the suspension measures initially undertaken\r\nin November 2003, and the Board has called on Iran to\r\nagain suspend all enrichment related and reprocessing\r\nactivities as a confidence-building measure. I have\r\ncontinued to stress to Iran that, in light of serious\r\ninternational concerns surrounding its nuclear\r\nprogramme, it should do its utmost to build confidence\r\nthrough these voluntary measures. I have also asked\r\nIran to pursue a policy of maximum transparency, so\r\nthat we can bring the outstanding issues to resolution\r\nand, over time, provide the required assurance to the\r\ninternational community. This is clearly in the interest\r\nof both Iran and the international community and\r\nshould lead to a dialogue among all interested parties\r\nwith a view to reaching a comprehensive settlement of\r\nall the underlying issues.\r\nThe IAEA’s mandate in Iraq under various\r\nSecurity Council resolutions still remains in effect. As\r\nI reported to the Assembly last year, at the time the\r\nAgency was asked to cease its Security Council\r\nverification activities in Iraq in March 2003, we had\r\nfound no evidence of the revival of nuclear activities\r\nprohibited under relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nNaturally, the international community is reassured that\r\nthese findings have since been validated. Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1546 (2004), inter alia, reaffirmed\r\nthe intention of the Council to revisit the mandate of\r\nthe Agency in Iraq. I hope that the Council will soon\r\nprovide guidance on the future of that mandate. It is\r\nclearly important to bring the whole question of\r\nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq to closure as early\r\nas possible and for the Agency to resume the necessary\r\nverification and monitoring activities in Iraq as soon as\r\nthe security situation permits, particularly in view of\r\nthe dual-use items that have been under IAEA custody\r\nin Iraq that would be susceptible to misuse.\r\nPursuant to the mandate given to me by the IAEA\r\nGeneral Conference, I have continued my consultations\r\nwith the States of the Middle East region on the\r\napplication of full-scope safeguards to all nuclear\r\nactivities in the Middle East and on the development of\r\nmodel agreements. Once again, I regret to report that I\r\nhave not been in a position to make progress on those\r\nfronts.\r\nThe General Conference has also asked me to\r\norganize a forum on the relevance of the experience of\r\nother regions with existing nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzones — including confidence-building and\r\nverification measures — for establishing such a zone in\r\nthe region of the Middle East. Based on my\r\nconsultations with States of the region, including\r\nduring my recent visit to Israel, I intend to organize\r\nsuch a forum early next year, and further consultations\r\nare in progress towards that end. I earnestly hope for\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nthis forum to be the beginning of a much-needed\r\ndialogue among States of the region on a security\r\nstructure that would undergird efforts to reach a\r\ncomprehensive settlement in the region.\r\nThe recent experience of the IAEA in verifying\r\nundeclared nuclear programmes has yielded a number\r\nof important lessons that are worth noting in this\r\ncontext. Perhaps the most important lesson is that\r\nverification and diplomacy, used in conjunction, can be\r\neffective. When inspections are accompanied by\r\nadequate authority, aided by all available information,\r\nbacked by a credible compliance mechanism and\r\nsupported by international consensus, the system\r\nworks. The Iraq experience demonstrated that\r\ninspections — while requiring time and patience —\r\ncan be effective, even when the country under\r\ninspection is providing less than active cooperation.\r\nPerhaps the most disturbing lesson to emerge\r\nfrom our work in Iran and Libya, however, is the\r\nexistence of an extensive illicit market for the supply\r\nof nuclear items, which clearly thrived on demand. The\r\nrelative ease with which a multinational illicit network\r\ncould be set up and operated demonstrates clearly the\r\ninadequacy of the present export control system, which\r\nrelies on informal arrangements that are not only non-\r\nbinding, but also do not include many countries with\r\ngrowing industrial capacity and do not provide for any\r\nsystematic sharing of information with the IAEA.\r\nA related lesson involves the accessibility of\r\nnuclear technology. The technical barriers to mastering\r\nthe essential steps of uranium enrichment and, for that\r\nmatter, to designing weapons, have eroded over time,\r\nwhich inevitably leads to the conclusion that the\r\ncontrol of technology, in and of itself, is not a\r\nsufficient barrier against further proliferation. This also\r\nleads to the important conclusion that ways and means\r\nshould be found to better control the sensitive parts of\r\nthe fuel cycle — namely, the production of enriched\r\nuranium and the reprocessing of plutonium.\r\nThe concept of multilateral control or oversight\r\nover proliferation-sensitive parts of the nuclear fuel\r\ncycle has been the subject of many studies and\r\ninitiatives over the years. Recent non-proliferation and\r\nsecurity challenges make it important and appropriate,\r\nhowever, that we revisit this subject. Several months\r\nago, I appointed a group of senior experts to look into\r\nvarious options for multilateral control. The group\r\nplans to submit a report next March on the results of its\r\nstudy.\r\nIn addition to the various components of the\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime that, as I mentioned,\r\nneed strengthening — including better control over\r\nsensitive aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle, increased\r\nefforts to secure and protect nuclear material and\r\nfacilities, a more inclusive and integrated export\r\ncontrol system and the need for all States to conclude\r\nadditional protocols — I should stress the importance\r\nof working collectively to address the sense of\r\ninsecurity and instability that persists in many\r\ncountries and regions. It is instructive that nearly all\r\nnuclear proliferation concerns are in areas of\r\nlongstanding conflict and instability.\r\nAs we proceed, it is important, in my view, to\r\nrecognize both the value and the limitations of the\r\nIAEA verification role. While the Agency can work\r\neffectively to bring to closure questions of compliance\r\nwith legal and technical requirements, the long-term\r\nvalue of these efforts can only be realized to the extent\r\nthat they are supported and reinforced by other\r\ncomponents of the non-proliferation regime, such as\r\nexport controls and compliance mechanisms.\r\nEqually, and perhaps more importantly, these\r\nefforts should be followed by the necessary political\r\ndialogue among concerned States to address underlying\r\nissues of insecurity and to build confidence and trust.\r\nThis overview of the past year highlights\r\nachievements and challenges in all areas of Agency\r\nactivity and reflects the dynamic nature of our\r\nprogramme in anticipating and responding to change.\r\nWhether a specific activity contributes to strengthening\r\nthe nuclear non-proliferation regime, to enhancing the\r\ntransfer and application of nuclear technologies, or to\r\nensuring safety and security in their use, our\r\ncommitment is always to respond to the needs and\r\npriorities of our member States.\r\nI would like to conclude by expressing my\r\ncontinuing gratitude to the Government of Austria,\r\nwhich has now served for over four decades as a most\r\ngracious and welcoming host to the IAEA.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to the representative of Canada to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.18.\r\nMr. Laurin (Canada): As the representative of\r\nCanada, and on behalf of the Chair of the Board of\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nGovernors of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA), I am honoured to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/59/L.18 on the annual report of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency. The following countries, along\r\nwith Canada, are sponsors of the text: Argentina,\r\nAustralia, Austria, Belgium, Chile, Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary,\r\nIndia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta,\r\nMonaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal,\r\nRepublic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, Romania,\r\nRussian Federation, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden,\r\nSwitzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\nand Northern Ireland and Uruguay.\r\nSince the document was first circulated, the\r\nfollowing have joined the list of sponsors: Andorra,\r\nArmenia, Austria, Belarus, Bolivia, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Colombia, Croatia,\r\nCyprus, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, Guatemala, Haiti,\r\nIceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Kazakhstan,\r\nKuwait, Mexico, Norway, Peru, Poland, Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, Slovakia, South Africa, Thailand,\r\nUkraine, United States of America and Venezuela. I\r\nhope that the new sponsors can be incorporated into the\r\nlist before we adopt the draft resolution before us.\r\nI also wish to thank the Director General of the\r\nIAEA, Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, for the statement he\r\nhas just made, which supplements the information\r\ncontained in the Agency’s annual report. All of this\r\nhighlights the scope and importance of the results\r\nachieved by the Agency over the past year.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe draft resolution before the General Assembly\r\nthis year is consistent with the format adopted last\r\nyear. It reflects an attempt to further rationalize our\r\nwork and that of our colleagues in Vienna, while\r\npreserving the essence of the message that the General\r\nAssembly’s adoption of the draft resolution sends to\r\nthe international community.\r\nIn this year’s draft resolution we note the exact\r\ndates and list the relevant resolutions and decision\r\nadopted by the Agency’s General Conference at its\r\n48th plenary meeting in September, retaining the\r\nsubstance of lengthier resolutions adopted in the past.\r\nThe draft resolution and the annual report give a\r\ndetailed account of activities in areas of specific\r\ninterest. So as to focus the attention of the Assembly\r\non the most significant activities of the Agency, the\r\ndraft resolution does not refer to resolutions adopted at\r\nthe most recent IAEA General Conference related to\r\nbudgetary or procedural issues. This means that, of 17\r\nresolutions adopted, only seven substantive resolutions\r\nare mentioned. Also mentioned is the sole decision\r\nadopted by the General Conference. In operative\r\nparagraph 2 of the draft resolution, the General\r\nAssembly would take note of the decisions and of each\r\nof those resolutions that relate to one of the three\r\npillars of the Agency’s activities, namely, nuclear\r\nsafety, technology transfer and verification of peaceful\r\nuse.\r\nIn closing, I would like to note that all the\r\ndecisions and resolutions adopted at the most recent\r\nGeneral Conference were a result of the constructive\r\nefforts of IAEA member States and were adopted by\r\nconsensus in Vienna. I also wish to thank Member\r\nStates for the broad support that this new approach and\r\nthe text of draft resolution A/59/L.18 have received\r\nover the course of the informal consultations that\r\nAmbassador Hall chaired in Vienna, which resulted in\r\nbroad and solid consensus. The consultations we have\r\nbeen holding over the past week in New York have also\r\nrevealed widespread support for the initiative. At the\r\ntime, we asked Member States present in the\r\nconsultations not to reopen issues already negotiated\r\nand agreed upon in Vienna.\r\nAt this stage, I would like to repeat the appeal to\r\nall States and to express the hope that draft resolution\r\nA/59/L.18 will be adopted by a broad majority and, if\r\npossible, by consensus.\r\nMr. Hamburger (Netherlands): I have the\r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU).\r\nThe Candidate Countries Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey\r\nand Croatia, the Countries of the Stabilization and\r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Albania,\r\nThe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia\r\nand Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the\r\nEFTA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway,\r\nmembers of the European Economic Area, align\r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nMr. President, allow me first of all to thank\r\nMr. Mohammed ElBaradei, the Director General of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Association (IAEA), for\r\nhis statement on the report of the IAEA activities in\r\n2004.\r\nThe EU commends the secretariat of the IAEA\r\nand its Director General for the excellent work done by\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nthe Agency and for the importance of the results\r\nachieved last year. EU member States welcome the\r\noutcome of the forty-eighth IAEA General Conference,\r\nheld in Vienna from 20 to 24 September 2004, and the\r\nresolutions and decisions that were adopted at the\r\nConference.\r\nEU member States are sponsors of the draft\r\nresolution on the report of the IAEA (A/59/L.18) and\r\nfully support its content. The draft resolution reflects\r\nbroad agreement among IAEA member States and is\r\nthe result of consultations held in Vienna. In that\r\nregard, we commend the efforts of the Chairman of the\r\nIAEA Board of Governors and hope that the present\r\ndraft resolution will be adopted by consensus.\r\nI should like to touch briefly upon a few elements\r\nof the role of the IAEA within the global nuclear non-\r\nproliferation regime and its contributions to that\r\nregime, as illustrated by the report (GC(48)/3)\r\nsubmitted to the Assembly under the provisions of the\r\nannex of General Assembly resolution 1145 (XII), and\r\ntransmitted by the note by the Secretary-General\r\ncontained in document A/59/295.\r\nThe EU continues to regard the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as the\r\ncornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime and\r\nas the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear\r\ndisarmament under article VI of the NPT. The EU\r\nbelieves that a nuclear non-proliferation regime of\r\nuniversal character, supported by a strong system of\r\ninternational safeguards, is an essential prerequisite for\r\ncollective security. In recent years, challenges to the\r\nTreaty and to the non-proliferation regime have\r\nhighlighted the necessity of full compliance and the\r\nneed to work actively towards universal adherence. In\r\nthat regard, the EU will continue its efforts to maintain\r\nthe authority and integrity of the Treaty.\r\nThe international safeguards system of the IAEA\r\nis an essential part of the global nuclear non-\r\nproliferation regime. It is a technical instrument in\r\nsupport of the political goal of sustaining an\r\nenvironment in which there can be the peaceful use of\r\nnuclear energy without the diversion of nuclear\r\nmaterial or the concealment of nuclear material and of\r\nnuclear activities directed to nuclear weapons. In that\r\ncontext, EU member countries recognize the continued\r\nneed for a properly funded safeguards system that is\r\nboth effective and cost-efficient and that is therefore\r\ncredible, robust and complied with.\r\nThe universal adoption and implementation of\r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreements and of their\r\nadditional protocols are prerequisites for an effective\r\nand credible safeguards system. In particular, the\r\nmeasures contained in the Additional Protocol are\r\ncrucial to strengthening the ability of the IAEA to\r\ndetect possible undeclared nuclear material and\r\nactivities and to provide assurances regarding the\r\nabsence of such activities. The EU therefore regrets\r\nthat the number of safeguards agreements and\r\nadditional protocols currently in force continues to be\r\nwell below expectations. The EU urges those States\r\nthat have not yet done so to sign and bring into force\r\ntheir respective safeguards agreements and additional\r\nprotocols.\r\nThe NPT confers a set of interrelated and\r\nmutually reinforcing obligations and rights on States\r\nparties. Full compliance with the Treaty and with the\r\nobligations deriving from it is of fundamental\r\nimportance. Therefore, the EU reiterates the IAEA’s\r\nspecific calls for compliance. The challenges to\r\ncompliance with the safeguards agreements must be\r\naddressed in a manner that upholds the integrity of the\r\nTreaty and the authority of the IAEA safeguards\r\nsystem, including through referral by the IAEA to the\r\nSecurity Council as appropriate.\r\nThe EU attaches the utmost importance to a high\r\nlevel of nuclear safety worldwide. Although safety is a\r\nnational responsibility, international cooperation on\r\nthis issue is indispensable. Nuclear safety is a\r\npermanent concern of the international community, and\r\nits continuous improvement should be the aim of all\r\nIAEA member States. The EU commends the Director\r\nGeneral and the secretariat of the IAEA for continuing\r\nto help member States during the past year to establish\r\nand maintain a stringent nuclear security framework\r\nfor nuclear installations and materials.\r\nFinally, the fight against terrorism and against the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction deserves a\r\nspecific reference, as it represents a challenge of\r\nparamount importance to the international community.\r\nEU member States strongly support all appropriate\r\nmeasures aimed at preventing terrorists from acquiring\r\nnuclear weapons. Although the primary responsibility\r\nfor the necessary nuclear security rests with member\r\nStates, the IAEA clearly has an essential role to play in\r\npreventing and combating nuclear terrorism. In that\r\nrespect, we look forward to cooperation between the\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nIAEA and the Security Council Committee established\r\npursuant to resolution 1540 (2004).\r\nIn conclusion, we all live in an increasingly\r\ninterdependent world in which we must ensure our own\r\nsecurity and safety and those of one another. That\r\ncertainly holds true for nuclear security and safety. By\r\nthe same token, all of us have an obligation to continue\r\nto ensure and enhance access for everyone to the\r\nbenefits of nuclear knowledge, technology, equipment\r\nand materials. The IAEA — with its central and\r\nindispensable role as the competent authority to help\r\nprovide, guarantee and verify nuclear safeguards and\r\nsafety and as the initiator and facilitator of cooperation\r\nin the area of nuclear technology — remains uniquely\r\nplaced to advance that goal. In view of that fact, the\r\nEU reaffirms its full support for the IAEA and is\r\npleased to sponsor the draft resolution on the report of\r\nthe IAEA, now before the Assembly.\r\nMr. Da Rocha Paranhos (Brazil) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): We, the countries members of the Common\r\nMarket of the South (MERCOSUR) — Argentina,\r\nBrazil, Paraguay and Uruguay — and the associated\r\nStates Bolivia, Chile and Peru, reaffirm our active and\r\nconstant commitment to the international community’s\r\nobjectives of non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament\r\nand promotion of the peaceful uses of atomic energy,\r\nguaranteeing the right of all States to develop research\r\nto produce and utilize nuclear energy for peaceful\r\npurposes.\r\nIn that connection, we emphasize the efforts of\r\nthe international community to strengthen the\r\neffectiveness and improve the efficiency of the\r\nsafeguards system, thus contributing to increased\r\ntransparency and mutual trust. At the same time, we\r\nconsider it necessary to continue to work to achieve a\r\ncost-effective verification mechanism with a high\r\ndegree of technical quality and credibility. We\r\nunderstand that strengthening the effectiveness and\r\nimproving the efficiency of the safeguards system of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) must\r\nbe in keeping with the preservation and consolidation\r\nof multilaterally negotiated international norms.\r\nWe welcome the new members of the IAEA and\r\ncall for the development of a consensus that would\r\ninclude the greatest possible number of countries to\r\nhelp create an atmosphere of trust and legitimacy with\r\nregard to decisions. Moreover, we recognize the\r\nimportance of the Action Plan for the Safety of\r\nRadiation Sources and the Security of Radioactive\r\nMaterials as an essential stimulus for the coordination\r\nof national and international efforts in that area.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish to point out that the joint\r\naccountability and control system implemented by the\r\nBrazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and\r\nControl of Nuclear Materials continues to establish\r\nparameters for cooperation between the Republic of\r\nArgentina and Brazil.\r\nMr. Hu Xiaodi (China) (spoke in Chinese): First\r\nof all, I would like to thank Director General ElBaradei\r\nfor his detailed report on the work of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) over the past year. We\r\nare glad to see that, with the joint efforts of the\r\nsecretariat and all member States, the Agency carried\r\nout plenty of work during the past year and made\r\nremarkable achievements. We wish to congratulate the\r\nsecretariat on those achievements and hope that, with\r\nthe support of all member States, the Agency will\r\ncontinue to play an active role in the fields of\r\npromoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy and the non-\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons.\r\nThis year marks the twentieth anniversary of\r\nChina’s accession to the IAEA. In the past 20 years,\r\nthe Chinese Government has actively supported the\r\nIAEA in its activities of promoting peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy and nuclear non-proliferation, as\r\nmandated by the Statute.\r\nIn the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy,\r\nChina has enjoyed extensive cooperation with the\r\nAgency and other member States in achieving fruitful\r\nresults. As of 2003, China dispatched more than 2,000\r\npeople to other member States for training and\r\nscientific visits, and also received more than 1,200\r\nexpert visitors through the Agency’s Technical\r\nCooperation (TC) programmes.\r\nIn the meantime, China has made voluntary\r\ncontributions of $13 million, in addition to other\r\ncontributions in kind, to the Agency. China has also\r\nprovided other member States with technological\r\npersonnel training for more than 2,000 people, and\r\norganized more than 200 meetings of the Agency.\r\nThrough participation in the Agency’s TC programmes,\r\nChina, as a developing country, has not only made\r\nprogress in the development of nuclear power at home,\r\nbut has also made appropriate contributions to the\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy in the region.\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nIn the field of nuclear non-proliferation, China\r\nstrongly supports the Agency’s efforts to enhance the\r\neffectiveness and efficiency of its safeguards regime.\r\nIn 2002, China ratified the Additional Protocol to the\r\nAgreement for the Application of Safeguards, being the\r\nfirst among the five nuclear-weapon States to do so. In\r\n2003, the Chinese Government published a white paper\r\nentitled, “China’s Non-Proliferation Policies and\r\nMeasures”, which systematically describes China’s\r\nnon-proliferation policy and practices, reflecting\r\nChina’s determination and sincerity with regard to non-\r\nproliferation.\r\nIn March 2004, China made a political\r\ncommitment to the IAEA Code of Conduct on the\r\nSafety and Security of Radioactive Sources. Since\r\nthen, China has implemented that commitment through\r\nthe promulgation of relevant laws and regulations, thus\r\nestablishing a national regulatory system.\r\nIn May 2005, China joined the Nuclear Suppliers\r\nGroup. Moreover, China has lent support to and played\r\na constructive role in the amendment process of the\r\nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear\r\nMaterial. It is our hope that States parties will reach a\r\nconsensus on the amendments at an early date, so that a\r\ndiplomatic conference on the amendments can be\r\nconvened. China will continue to play a supportive role\r\nand participate in the Agency’s activities.\r\nNow I would like to briefly introduce China’s\r\nposition on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nnuclear issue, and the Iran nuclear issue. The Chinese\r\nGovernment has shown great concern for the peace and\r\nstability of North-East Asia. We have all along\r\nadvocated that the Korean Peninsula should be\r\ndenuclearized and that the peace and stability of the\r\nNorth-East Asia region should be maintained through\r\ndialogue and peaceful consultations. While addressing\r\nthe nuclear issue, the legitimate security concerns of\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea should also\r\nbe addressed.\r\nFor that reason, China has been actively engaged\r\nin promoting peace and facilitating talks. China has\r\nhosted three rounds of the Six-Party Talks, which\r\nestablished the objectives of a denuclearized Korean\r\nPeninsula and peaceful settlement through dialogue.\r\nThe Six-Party Talks have already entered the stage of\r\nsubstantive negotiations and it is fair therefore, to say\r\nthat they have achieved positive results. Continuation\r\nof the talks and working to start a new round of the\r\nTalks at an earlier date are in the interest of all parties\r\nconcerned; this also represents the common wish of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe should also not lose sight of the fact that the\r\nissue concerning the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea is complex. We hope that all parties will remain\r\npatient and sincere and will show flexibility. China will\r\nadhere to its objective and just position and will\r\ncontinue its efforts, together with the international\r\ncommunity, to reach a peaceful settlement of the\r\nnuclear issue concerning the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea.\r\nOn the Iran nuclear issue, China stands for an\r\nappropriate resolution — within the framework of the\r\nIAEA — through dialogue and consultation. We hope\r\nIran will continue its comprehensive cooperation with\r\nthe Agency so as to clarify all the outstanding issues\r\nand ratify the Additional Protocol as soon as possible.\r\nAll parties should encourage Iran to continue to adopt\r\nmeasures conducive to enhancing trust and clarifying\r\ndoubts.\r\nChina supports all diplomatic efforts to resolve\r\nthe Iran nuclear issue at an early date, and is ready to\r\nkeep in touch with all the parties in that regard. It is\r\nour wish and belief that, with the concerted efforts of\r\nall parties, the Iran nuclear issue could be resolved\r\nproperly within the framework of the Agency. Such a\r\nresult is not only in the interest of all parties concerned\r\nbut also conducive to the maintenance of the\r\ninternational nuclear non-proliferation regime.\r\nMr. Akram (Pakistan): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing our appreciation to a dear friend,\r\nMr. ElBaradei, Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for presenting the\r\nAgency’s annual report. The Agency continues to\r\nperform a commendable role under the dynamic\r\nstewardship of Mr. ElBaradei, contributing to peace\r\nand security and socio-economic development in an\r\nincreasingly complex and challenging international\r\nenvironment. Pakistan assures Mr. ElBaradei and his\r\nteam of our full support.\r\nWe agree with the Agency’s assessment that\r\nglobal socio-economic development needs will require\r\na large increase in the supply of energy in the coming\r\ndecades. The role of nuclear energy will be crucial in\r\nsupplying part of that requirement, especially in view\r\nof its environmental friendliness and its sustainability,\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nwhich is needed for development, especially in the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe Agency has projected a 20 per cent increase\r\nin global nuclear requirements until 2020. We note\r\nwith interest, that most of that increase will be required\r\nby Asia since out of 31 reactors currently under\r\nconstruction worldwide, 20 are located in Asia and 19\r\nof the 28 reactors to be connected to the grids are in\r\nthe Far East and South Asia.\r\nThe pace of construction of the reactors could be\r\nfurther increased if States were not subjected to undue\r\nrestrictions. With innovative technologies, safe nuclear\r\npower plants are a reality and can be constructed in\r\nenergy-deficient developing countries. In that regard,\r\nthe IAEA’s role in the transfer of safe technology to\r\ndeveloping countries has assumed added significance.\r\nWe hope that the Agency will formulate a\r\ncomprehensive policy towards that end.\r\nThe Government of Pakistan attaches the highest\r\nimportance to the Technical Cooperation Programme of\r\nthe Agency, as it offers unique opportunities to the\r\ndeveloping countries for prosperity and economic\r\ngrowth with the availability of easy and affordable\r\nsources of energy. In view of Pakistan’s limited fossil\r\nfuel resources and the need to achieve a balance\r\nbetween the risks of industrial pollution and our\r\neconomic growth, we consider nuclear-power\r\ngeneration as an indispensable element of our national\r\nenergy strategy. For over 30 years, Pakistan’s two\r\nnuclear power plants, KANUPP and CHASNUPP, have\r\nenjoyed an excellent operational and safety record. The\r\nexistence of a reliable infrastructure relevant to the\r\nnuclear power plants has enabled us to commence work\r\non another nuclear power station — CHASNUPP II.\r\nPakistan’s future nuclear-power-generation\r\nactivities will not be confined to the installation of\r\nmore power plants, but extend to the utilization of\r\nsome of those facilities for powering desalination\r\nplants. As a result of collaborative efforts with the\r\nIAEA, a desalination unit at KANUPP has been in\r\nservice since 2000, producing about 450 cubic metres\r\nof fresh water per day through the desalination of sea\r\nwater.\r\nThe Agency has also played a commendable role\r\nin the health sector — especially in the treatment of\r\ncancer and tuberculosis. In the agricultural sector, too,\r\ninnovative technologies have helped in the protection\r\nof crops and in enhancing agricultural productivity. A\r\nsustained effort would be required to allocate more\r\nresources to the IAEA to carry out further research\r\nwork in the health and agriculture sectors, which could\r\nimmensely reduce hunger, disease and poverty in the\r\nworld.\r\nPakistan is also applying the nuclear sciences to\r\nthe development of health and agriculture and the\r\nreclamation of wasteland. We appreciate the growing\r\ncooperation between the Pakistan Atomic Energy\r\nCommission and the IAEA in this field. This year,\r\nPakistan established its thirteenth nuclear medical\r\ncentre and is working on setting up five more such\r\ncentres, including the country’s first positron emission\r\ntomography diagnostic facility in Pakistan.\r\nIn agriculture, our centres continue to evolve new\r\ncrop varieties. We have established five demonstration\r\nfarms to utilize salinity-affected lands. Pakistan is also\r\ninterested in playing a substantive role in the\r\ninternational effort to promote the International Project\r\non Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles\r\n(INPRO) so that Pakistan can benefit from the safe,\r\ncost-effective and proliferation-resistant nuclear power\r\nplants of the future.\r\nWe are highly sensitive to the safety and security\r\nof our nuclear installations, particularly as we are\r\nextending our nuclear-power-generation capacities for\r\neconomic development. Pakistan has successfully\r\nestablished a strong safety culture in its nuclear\r\nactivities. We are diligently adhering to the principles\r\nof the Convention on Nuclear Safety, which Pakistan\r\nsigned at the time of its inception. We have further\r\nstrengthened security measures around our nuclear\r\ninstallations to avoid any possibility of sabotage or of\r\nthe illicit acquisition of or trafficking in nuclear\r\nmaterial. We will continue our active participation in\r\nthe Agency’s initiative to strengthen the Convention on\r\nthe Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. We are\r\ndesirous of an early conclusion of the deliberations on\r\nthe Convention, and hope that that important\r\ninstrument will establish more comprehensive\r\nobligations globally regarding the physical protection\r\nof nuclear materials, as well as of nuclear facilities. We\r\nhave, however, made it clear that any provisions in the\r\nnew Convention which can be construed as\r\nlegitimizing attacks on nuclear facilities are against\r\ninternational law and morality. This issue requires a\r\nsatisfactory solution.\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nAs part of our efforts to augment the safety and\r\nsecurity of nuclear installations and to prevent the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, Pakistan\r\nhas undertaken additional measures. These include,\r\nfirst, effective steps, in cooperation with the\r\ninternational community, to eliminate an underground\r\nproliferation network which had its tentacles in two\r\ndozen countries. We have cooperated closely with the\r\nIAEA in that endeavour and urge others concerned to\r\ndo likewise.\r\nSecondly, Pakistan has adopted wide-ranging\r\nmeasures to ensure foolproof security for its nuclear\r\nand strategic assets. Four years ago, we established a\r\nNuclear Command and Control Authority, which is\r\nresponsible for Pakistan’s nuclear and strategic assets.\r\nThose assets are vital for our strategic deterrence\r\nposture. There is no question of their falling into the\r\nwrong hands. Thirdly, in 2001 we created a nuclear\r\nregulatory authority for the safe operation of civilian\r\nnuclear plants. Fourthly, since 2000 Pakistan has been\r\nelaborating legislation to implement its obligations\r\nunder the Chemical Weapons Convention.\r\nFinally, last month Pakistan’s parliament\r\npromulgated a comprehensive Export Control Act to\r\ndeal with nuclear and biological weapons, material,\r\ngoods, technologies, equipment and their means of\r\ndelivery. Salient elements of our new law include a\r\nprohibition on the diversion of controlled goods and\r\ntechnologies, including re-export, trans-shipment and\r\ntransit; licensing and record-keeping; export control\r\nlists; and penal provisions of up to 14 years\r\nimprisonment and a fine of 5 million rupees. We are\r\nconfident that there will be no proliferation of weapons\r\nof mass destruction from Pakistan.\r\nThe safety and verification aspects of the IAEA’s\r\nmandate remain important pillars of the Agency’s\r\nwork. The Agency has initiated action with regard to\r\nthe safety of nuclear materials. There is a need to focus\r\nattention on securing “orphan” sources of such\r\nmaterials which are in immediate danger of falling into\r\nthe wrong hands. The Agency’s report highlights this\r\naspect, and we fully agree with the remedial measures\r\nsuggested in that regard.\r\nAs regards the strengthening of the Agency’s\r\nsafeguards system, Pakistan believes that the\r\nmaintenance of a proper balance between the\r\npromotional aspects and safety- or security-related\r\nconcerns in all of the Agency’s functions is essential.\r\nWe believe that States must fully comply with their\r\nrespective safeguards obligations. At the same time,\r\nthe Agency’s safeguards should not be used to serve\r\npartisan political objectives. Its verification regime will\r\nbe able to remain credible only if it is applied on a\r\nnon-discriminatory basis, as stipulated in the Agency’s\r\nstatutes. Cooperation and greater understanding is\r\nrequired among all the States members of the Agency\r\nso as to advance its mandate on the basis of\r\nimpartiality, equity and professionalism.\r\nThe Agency’s role should be consistent with its\r\nstatutes. Proposals for reform should be within the\r\nscope of the Statute. The IAEA is not an investigative\r\nagency. It cannot be asked to perform tasks which are\r\nbeyond the scope of its Statute or not approved by its\r\nmembership. Any reform in the Agency should be non-\r\ndiscriminatory and inclusive and take into account the\r\ndifferentiated nature of the obligations of its member\r\nStates. Finally, such reforms should not undermine the\r\nbalance between the promotional role of the Agency\r\nand the safety- or security-related concerns involved in\r\nits functions.\r\nWe all have great expectations of the IAEA in the\r\npromotion of the socio-economic development of\r\nmember States. The Agency’s technical cooperation\r\nrequires a reassessment of its current framework\r\nwhereby it can render assistance to member States on\r\nnon-discriminatory and equitable basis. Apart from\r\nensuring balance between the promotional aspects and\r\nverification, safety- and security-related functions, the\r\nfollowing measures could help in enhancing its\r\ncontribution to socio-economic development: first, the\r\npreservation of its technical nature and the prevention\r\nof the politicization of its agenda; secondly, a greater\r\nemphasis on the technical cooperation activities of the\r\nAgency and its contribution to the development and\r\npractical application of atomic energy for peaceful uses\r\nand technology transfers to developing countries;\r\nthirdly, the allocation of larger and more assured\r\nresources for technical cooperation activities,\r\ntechnology transfer and training facilities for\r\ndeveloping countries; and, fourthly, the greater\r\ninvolvement of developing countries in the design and\r\nimplementation of technical cooperation projects and\r\nincreased outsourcing to developing member States for\r\nits Technical Cooperation Programme.\r\nMs. Martina (Ukraine): On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, I would like to thank Mr. Mohamed\r\nElBaradei, Director General of the International\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his statement on\r\nthe main developments in the Agency’s activities\r\nduring 2004. Ukraine commends the secretariat of\r\nIAEA and its Director General for the excellent work\r\ndone by the Agency, as well as for the important results\r\nachieved over the past year.\r\nI would also like to extend our welcome to the\r\nnew members of the Agency: the Republic of Chad, the\r\nIslamic Republic of Mauritania and the Togolese\r\nRepublic.\r\nFifty years ago the United Nations General\r\nAssembly adopted its landmark resolution 810 (IX),\r\nentitled “International cooperation in developing the\r\npeaceful uses of atomic energy”, which called for the\r\nestablishment of the IAEA. Today, when the risk of\r\nnuclear proliferation has changed and increased, we\r\nhave no other choice but to use our best efforts to\r\nfurther strengthen the activities of the Agency to\r\nensure that nuclear technologies developed for peaceful\r\npurposes will not be misused for non-peaceful\r\nactivities.\r\nUkraine underscores the significance of the\r\nsafeguards system and the importance of the work done\r\nby the Agency to implement the safeguards provisions\r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT). We fully endorse measures envisaged\r\nby the Additional Protocol to the IAEA safeguards\r\nagreements. As of today, the preparatory activities for\r\nthe ratification of the Additional Protocol, signed by\r\nUkraine in 2000, have been completed and ratification\r\nis expected very soon.\r\nAs regards unresolved compliance matters,\r\nUkraine welcomes the historic decision by the Libyan\r\nleadership to give up its weapons of mass destruction\r\nprogrammes and to cooperate closely with the\r\ninternational community to that end.\r\nUkraine recognizes the inalienable right of Iran to\r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy. At the same time,\r\nwe support IAEA efforts aimed at providing credible\r\nassurances regarding the peaceful nature of Iran’s\r\nnuclear programme. Ukraine hails the signing by Iran,\r\nin December 2003, of the Additional Protocol to the\r\nIAEA safeguards agreement and hopes that that fact —\r\nalong with further active cooperation of the\r\nGovernment in Tehran with IAEA — will help remove\r\nconcerns over Iran’s nuclear activities.\r\nThe situation on the Korean Peninsula continues\r\nto cause concern. Ukraine shares the conviction that\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea should\r\nrelinquish its nuclear ambitions, resume its cooperation\r\nwith IAEA and return to compliance with its\r\nobligations under the NPT and the IAEA safeguards\r\nagreement without delay. We support an early\r\nsettlement of the crisis by political and diplomatic\r\nmeans, which we do not believe are exhausted. Ukraine\r\nhopes that the multilateral dialogue on that issue will\r\nbe continued.\r\nWe are confident that security and proliferation\r\nchallenges can only be met successfully by multilateral\r\ncooperation. Ukraine considers that the NPT is an\r\nexceptionally important global instrument to that end.\r\nUkraine is fully committed to the NPT and will\r\ncontinue its efforts to maintain the authority and\r\nintegrity of the Treaty.\r\nThis year marks the tenth anniversary of\r\nUkraine’s accession to the NPT. There is no doubt that\r\nUkraine’s landmark decision to relinquish its nuclear\r\ncapability and to accede to the Treaty contributed\r\nsignificantly to the enhancement of the international\r\nnon-proliferation regime and to global security.\r\nUkraine welcomes the adoption of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1540 (2004), which calls on all\r\nMember States to enact effective domestic controls to\r\nprevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nWe highly appreciate the IAEA’s readiness to assist\r\nStates in implementing that resolution.\r\nA strategy to counter nuclear terrorism should\r\ncover all types of risk, including the possible\r\nacquisition of nuclear weapons by terrorists or their\r\nproduction of various kinds of nuclear explosives from\r\neither nuclear or radioactive material. All possible\r\nmeasures have to be taken in order to provide proper\r\nprotection against malicious acts on facilities or\r\ntransport containers housing nuclear or radioactive\r\nmaterials.\r\nIn that context, Ukraine supports urgent measures\r\nto strengthen multilateral control over the nuclear fuel\r\ncycle and to improve the safety and physical protection\r\nof nuclear material and facilities. We welcome the\r\ncreation by the IAEA Director General of a group of\r\nexperts tasked with developing better approaches to\r\ncontrol the sensitive parts of the nuclear fuel cycle and\r\nwe look forward to the results of its work.\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nUkraine considers the Convention on the Physical\r\nProtection of Nuclear Material as one of the key\r\ninstruments for preventing nuclear proliferation and the\r\nrisk of nuclear terrorism. We reiterate our support for\r\nfinalizing the ongoing process of amendment of the\r\nConvention as soon as possible.\r\nThe newly revised Code of Conduct on the Safety\r\nand Security of Radioactive Sources is another\r\nimportant landmark instrument. We call upon all IAEA\r\nmember States that have not done so to adopt and\r\nimplement the Code of Conduct without delay.\r\nUkraine strongly supports IAEA activities to\r\nreinforce national programmes to identify, secure,\r\nrecover and facilitate the disposition of vulnerable\r\nnuclear and other high-risk radioactive materials. For\r\nUkraine that issue is of special importance, taking into\r\naccount the significant amount of fuel-containing\r\nmasses in the destroyed fourth power unit at the\r\nChernobyl nuclear power plant and the radioactive\r\nmaterial present in the Chernobyl exclusion zone.\r\nIAEA participation in resolving those problems, as\r\nwell as international assistance within the framework\r\nof bilateral and multilateral projects, should be\r\nadequate to solve the complex range of issues\r\npresented by the “Shelter” object and the Chernobyl\r\nexclusion zone.\r\nUkraine has filed its national report for the third\r\nReview Meeting of the Convention on Nuclear Safety\r\nto be held in 2005. The report clearly demonstrates our\r\nprogress and achievements in the field of nuclear\r\nsafety over past years.\r\nFor Ukraine, 2004 has been a year marked by two\r\noutstanding events: the commissioning of new power\r\nunits at the Khmelnitska and Rivnenska nuclear power\r\nplants. I would like to express our gratitude to all the\r\ninternational institutions that have made valuable\r\ncontributions to the completion of the units’\r\nconstruction, undertaking numerous research projects\r\nand expert examinations and elaborating the necessary\r\nrecommendations to that end. Today, we can certify\r\nthat the two new power units conform to the highest\r\nlevel of design safety standards of all the units\r\ncurrently operating in Ukraine.\r\nWe consider implementation of the IAEA\r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme to be the\r\ncornerstone of international cooperation in the peaceful\r\nuses of nuclear energy. We are pleased to see the IAEA\r\nsecretariat continuing its efforts to improve the\r\nProgramme’s effectiveness and efficiency through\r\nevaluations, audits and process reviews. Agency\r\nactivities in the field of nuclear sciences and\r\napplications in the non-power sector also contribute\r\nsignificantly to sustainable development.\r\nIn conclusion, Ukraine notes the importance of\r\nplacing greater emphasis in the Technical Cooperation\r\nProgramme for Europe on issues of safety and security,\r\nradiation and transport safety, management of\r\nradioactive waste, national health programmes,\r\nenvironmental issues and problems related to\r\ndecommissioning of nuclear power plants or their life\r\nextension, which remain priorities for my country\r\nwithin the framework of technical cooperation with the\r\nAgency.\r\nMr. Devamany (Malaysia): I join others in\r\nthanking Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for\r\nhis presentation to the General Assembly of the annual\r\nreport of the Agency for the calendar year 2003, as\r\ncontained in document GC(48)/3. It was a year of\r\nnotable success for the Agency in its efforts to ensure\r\nthat the benefits of nuclear technology were shared\r\nglobally for economic and social development. My\r\ndelegation commends the excellent work and efforts of\r\nthe Agency in fulfilling its mandate during the period\r\nunder review.\r\nMalaysia continues to recognize the value of\r\nnuclear technology for the achievement of sustainable\r\ndevelopment and the process of nation-building and the\r\nrole played by the Agency in this regard. We reaffirm\r\nour support for the Agency in its mission to promote\r\nand facilitate the development of nuclear technology\r\nfor peaceful uses, as embodied in Article II of its\r\nStatute.\r\nIn this connection, the Technical Cooperation\r\nProgramme of the Agency remains a crucial\r\ncomponent of its mandate and activities. Malaysia is a\r\nbeneficiary of this Programme, and we commend the\r\nIAEA Department of Technical Cooperation for its\r\ncontinuous efforts in discharging its statutory mandate\r\nfor the benefit of recipient member States, as well as\r\nfor its creditable achievements.\r\nThe success of the Technical Cooperation\r\nProgramme is very much determined by the sustained\r\navailability and sufficient level of financial resources.\r\nAs a member State that has long participated in and\r\nbenefited from the Programme, Malaysia has\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nconsistently fulfilled, in full and on time, its financial\r\nobligations to the Agency, including to the Technical\r\nCooperation Fund and the assessed programme costs.\r\nIn this connection, Malaysia is concerned over the\r\nshortfall in the current level of payments received in\r\n2004 for the Fund, as reported during the 48th Session\r\nof the General Conference of the Agency last\r\nSeptember.\r\nSimilarly, Malaysia is concerned over the fact\r\nthat pledges and payments to the Fund for 2004 stand\r\nat only 65.4 per cent of the target, with fewer than\r\n60 per cent of member States having made known their\r\nintentions. Malaysia urges other member States, both\r\ndonors and recipients, to disburse their target share in\r\nfull and on time. This should be done in the interest of\r\npromoting and safeguarding the inalienable, collective\r\nand individual national rights of member States to the\r\npeaceful uses of atomic energy through the\r\nProgramme, as envisaged under Article IV of the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT).\r\nIn relation to financial contributions pledged to\r\nthe Technical Cooperation Fund for 2005, Malaysia, in\r\npledging its full assessed target share, urges those\r\nmember States that have not yet done so to make their\r\npledges without delay. Member States should disburse\r\ntheir contributions in full at the earliest opportunity.\r\nReasonably assured financial resources would certainly\r\nfacilitate the Agency’s work in preparing a proposed\r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme for 2005, which\r\nwould be considered by the meeting of the Technical\r\nAssistance and Cooperation Committee of the Agency\r\nlater this month. We hope that the approved\r\nProgramme will be successfully implemented without\r\nhindrance or uncertainty.\r\nNuclear terrorism poses a serious threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. We must continue to\r\nbe vigilant and to consolidate our collective efforts to\r\nprevent terrorists and non-State actors from acquiring\r\nnuclear weapons and using them to achieve their\r\nobjectives. Malaysia has taken, and will continue to\r\ntake, appropriate measures to prevent this threat, in\r\naccordance with the principles of international law and\r\nthe relevant instruments, including Security Council\r\nresolution 1540 (2004). In this connection, Malaysia\r\nremains supportive of the continuous efforts of the\r\nIAEA in promoting nuclear security, in particular\r\nthrough providing assistance and technical support to\r\nmember States. Malaysia also believes that while\r\nmeasures to promote nuclear security and to combat\r\nnuclear trafficking should indeed be stepped up,\r\nserious efforts should concurrently be made to achieve\r\nthe total elimination of nuclear weapons to provide an\r\nabsolute guarantee against the use of such weapons.\r\nMalaysia supports IAEA verification activities, in\r\naccordance with Article III of the NPT, to ensure that\r\npeaceful nuclear technology is not transformed to fulfil\r\nmilitary purposes. As a State party to the NPT,\r\nMalaysia remains convinced that the continued\r\nexistence of nuclear weapons poses a threat to the\r\nsurvival of humanity and the planet and that their use\r\nwould have catastrophic consequences for our\r\ncivilization. In this connection, Malaysia is committed\r\nto pursuing particularly the total abolition and\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons, including new types of\r\nnuclear weapons. We strongly believe that the absolute\r\ngoal of a nuclear weapon-free world must remain high\r\non the international disarmament agenda. The\r\ncontinued possession, proliferation and improvement\r\nof nuclear weapons should be a source of great concern\r\nto the international community in the light of the grave\r\ndanger that they pose to international peace and\r\nsecurity. Malaysia believes that the States parties to the\r\nNPT must genuinely revisit the issue of compliance by\r\nboth the nuclear weapon States and the non-nuclear\r\nweapon States at the 2005 Review Conference here in\r\nNew York in May next year.\r\nMalaysia, on behalf of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement (NAM), has consistently expressed NAM’s\r\nappreciation to the Director General and secretariat of\r\nthe Agency for their reports to the Board of Governors\r\nof the Agency, in particular on the question concerning\r\nthe implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement\r\nin the Islamic Republic of Iran and in the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya. The NAM has reiterated its full confidence\r\nin the ability of the Director General and the Agency in\r\ndischarging their duties and responsibilities in an\r\nimpartial, effective and professional manner. The Non-\r\nAligned Movement countries believe that such\r\nquestions should be resolved within the mandate of the\r\nAgency.\r\nMalaysia once again expresses its appreciation to\r\nMr. József Rónaki of Hungary, President of the 48th\r\nregular session of the IAEA General Conference held\r\nlast September and to the Vice-Presidents for their\r\nleadership in guiding the General Conference to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion. My delegation commends\r\nMr. Ibrahim Othman of the Syrian Arab Republic for\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nthe efficient manner in which he chaired the\r\nCommittee of the Whole. Malaysia recognizes that\r\nnone of the resolutions adopted by the General\r\nConference require immediate follow-up action. This\r\nnotwithstanding, Malaysia has full confidence in the\r\nDirector General and the Agency to carefully examine\r\nall decisions and resolutions of the General Conference\r\nand to make appropriate recommendations thereto in\r\ndue course.\r\nIn this connection, my delegation would like to\r\nrefer to resolution GC(48)/RES/14 of the General\r\nConference, entitled “Strengthening the effectiveness\r\nand improving the efficiency of the safeguards system\r\nand application of the Model Additional Protocol”.\r\nMalaysia, like other Member Countries of NAM,\r\nattaches great importance to the effectiveness and\r\nstrengthening of the safeguards system, as well as to\r\nthe maintenance of an appropriate balance between the\r\nAgency’s verification and other statutory functions.\r\nNAM worked in good faith to ensure the\r\nconsensual adoption of the resolution. In the meetings\r\nof the Board of Governors during the preceding week,\r\nNAM expressed its serious concern over the\r\ncomplications that might arise if no clear distinction\r\nwas made between the legal obligations of member\r\nStates under their respective safeguards agreements\r\nand their voluntary commitments. Moreover, voluntary\r\ncommitments should be entered into for a specified\r\nperiod and should cease to be binding once the relevant\r\nrequirements have been met. Member States should\r\nrespect the fundamental principle that decisions and\r\nresolutions on safeguards issues should be compatible\r\nwith the relevant provisions of the Statute and the\r\nrights and obligations of States under relevant treaties\r\nand their safeguards agreements. Malaysia is indeed\r\npleased that those views are shared by other members\r\nof the Board of Governors.\r\nMalaysia recognizes that consensus was elusive\r\non the question of compatibility of decisions relating to\r\nsafeguards with the relevant provisions of the Statute.\r\nAs such, Malaysia and the member countries of NAM\r\ntake serious note of the fact that the statement by the\r\ndelegation of the Netherlands, on behalf of the\r\nsponsors of the resolution on that question, explicitly\r\nrecognized the importance of all the provisions of the\r\nStatute in that regard. However, that pronouncement\r\nfell short of the expectations of NAM on the definitive\r\nimportance of the relevant treaties and concluded\r\nsafeguards agreements. Similarly, Malaysia notes with\r\nconcern the attempts to amend the provisions of the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) through the Agency. Malaysia reiterates that the\r\n2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT is\r\nthe most appropriate forum to discuss any question\r\nrelating to the NPT.\r\nMalaysia joins other member States of the\r\nAgency that belong to the G-77 and China in\r\nexpressing confidence in, and supporting the candidacy\r\nof, Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, the current Director\r\nGeneral of the Agency, for a further term. The position\r\nof the Group was formally conveyed by the Vienna\r\nchapter of the G-77 on 7 September 2004. We hope\r\nthat his candidacy will be successful.\r\nFinally, Malaysia will join others in supporting\r\nthe draft resolution on this item that is now before the\r\nAssembly in document A/59/L.18. Malaysia considers\r\nthat text to be a procedural one, and its provisions\r\nshould remain as they are since the text reflects the\r\nbroad agreement reached among member States of the\r\nAgency in Vienna. We look forward to its adoption by\r\nconsensus.\r\nMr. Aboul Atta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nEgyptian delegation expresses its appreciation to\r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his\r\nstatement, in which he highlighted the Agency’s\r\nsingular contribution in 2003 to its major areas of\r\nresponsibility and activities. He also informed the\r\nAssembly of future challenges that we must be\r\nprepared to tackle.\r\nI also express our appreciation for the Director\r\nGeneral’s wise management, which has notably\r\nenhanced the Agency’s performance and left it better\r\nprepared to face current and future challenges with the\r\nprofessionalism and credibility we have come to\r\nexpect.\r\nThe report of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (A/59/295) stresses the importance of the\r\nAgency’s role in protecting the non-proliferation\r\nregime and in enhancing it and in preserving the\r\nregime’s credibility. The Agency has demonstrated that\r\nit is the principal body with the objectivity and\r\ncredibility to take concrete action to place safeguards\r\non the nuclear activities of States. The Agency is also\r\nmaking important, concrete efforts in the areas of\r\ntransfer of nuclear technology for numerous and\r\ndiverse peaceful uses, thus contributing to sustainable\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\ndevelopment in the majority of countries, in particular\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nWe hope that in the near future the Agency will\r\ngenerate many ideas and proposals to strengthen the\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime, particularly if\r\nagreement on those ideas — in a revised package so to\r\nspeak — can be reached at the 2005 Review\r\nConference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT). We imagine that the Agency\r\nwill be the main body for implementing those ideas\r\nand proposals, and we hope that the Agency will do so\r\nwith the same professionalism, objectivity and\r\ncredibility it has demonstrated in dealing with various\r\nsensitive issues.\r\nThe increasing role of the Agency in supporting\r\nand spreading the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, as\r\nwell as technical cooperation with member States,\r\ndeveloping States in particular, are no less important\r\nthan its verification and non-proliferation efforts,\r\nalthough those latter efforts receive the most attention\r\nin the press. Many efforts are being made to enhance\r\nthe Agency’s safeguards regime, and a similar impetus\r\nmust be given to the Agency’s activities in technical\r\ncooperation. The dramatic increase in the Agency’s\r\nmembership is due to the fact that member States in the\r\ndeveloping world have joined the IAEA essentially to\r\nbenefit from the Agency’s programmes and activities\r\nin peaceful nuclear applications and to use that\r\nassistance to achieve their development goals, in\r\naccordance with article IV of the NPT treaty.\r\nWe express our appreciation for developing and\r\nimproving the effectiveness and goals of technical\r\ncooperation programmes, especially in helping to\r\ndetermine the priorities of the States. We believe that\r\nthere should be greater focus on those programmes\r\nproviding concrete results and on early consultations\r\nwith member States on the details of projects\r\nundertaken by States. Egypt is fully prepared to\r\ncontinue its cooperation with the Agency in\r\nprogrammes related to economic development and\r\nother, related fields.\r\nWith respect to safeguards and verification, we\r\nstress once again that the lack of universality in\r\napplying the Agency’s comprehensive safeguards\r\nprevents those safeguards from being successful, as far\r\nas the threat of nuclear proliferation is concerned.\r\nComprehensive safeguards are the main foundation for\r\nnon-proliferation. Thus, we believe it is very important\r\nto continue working towards universality.\r\nEgypt has put forward many initiatives at the\r\ninternational and regional levels to counter the threat\r\nof nuclear proliferation. Twenty-five years ago, we\r\ncalled for the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in\r\nthe Middle East. The President of Egypt has also called\r\nfor a Middle East zone free of all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Egypt, through the IAEA, continues to call\r\nfor implementation of comprehensive Agency\r\nsafeguards for all nuclear installations in the Middle\r\nEast, without exception.\r\nDespite all those initiatives to promote security\r\nand stability in the region, Israel, one of the States of\r\nthe region, has shown no desire to act in a serious\r\nconstructive manner to counter the threat of nuclear\r\nproliferation in the Middle East. It continually rejects\r\nall initiatives to submit its nuclear facilities to the\r\nAgency’s international safeguards. That situation\r\nnegatively impacts on all efforts to tackle nuclear non-\r\nproliferation in general, in particular efforts in the\r\nMiddle East, and requires the international community\r\nto redouble its efforts to eradicate the threat of nuclear\r\nproliferation to international peace and security and to\r\nseek to apply the Agency’s comprehensive safeguards\r\nthroughout the Middle East. We believe that the forum\r\nthat the Director General is to hold early next year is\r\nan encouraging first step in tackling some of the issues\r\nrelated to establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in\r\nthe Middle East. We therefore express our support for\r\nthis initiative and declare our intention to participate\r\ntherein.\r\nAs for nuclear safety, the events of 11 September\r\n2001 have shown the urgent need to strengthen the\r\nefforts of the Agency and its programmes to protect\r\nnuclear materials and installations as well as other\r\nradioactive materials from the threat of international\r\nterrorism. Egypt believes that as long as there are\r\nnuclear materials not subjected to any international\r\nsupervision and monitoring, the threat of them falling\r\ninto terrorist hands will remain. Egypt has participated\r\neffectively in the Agency’s efforts to promulgate\r\nproposed measures and activities to avoid nuclear\r\nterrorism. Egypt believes that such efforts cannot\r\nsubstitute for national measures, that they in no way\r\nlessen the responsibility that States bear in dealing with\r\nsecurity issues and that they are voluntarily financed.\r\nEgypt looks forward to future efforts and measures in\r\nthis regard as being complementary to technical\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\ncooperation efforts and programmes, without impairing\r\nthe resources of the technical cooperation fund.\r\nWhile we welcome the efforts of the Advisory\r\nGroup on Nuclear Security set up by the Director\r\nGeneral, we hope that Member States will be kept\r\naware of its activities in a regular manner. We stress\r\nthat any production of fissile materials should meet the\r\nrequirement to subject nuclear materials, including\r\nstockpiled materials, to monitoring, which is consistent\r\nwith the objectives of the relevant Conventions.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to express our\r\ncontinued support for the IAEA as we face future\r\nchallenges. We would like once again to thank\r\nMr. Mohammed ElBaradei, Director General of the\r\nAgency, for all the efforts he has continued to make to\r\nattain the objectives of the Agency with his well-\r\nknown competence.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to Mr. Rao Inderjit Singh, the Minister of State\r\nfor External Affairs of India.\r\nMr. Singh (India): We congratulate the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the\r\nexcellent role it has been playing in promoting the use\r\nof nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and, in the\r\nprocess, ensuring that it is safe and secure. India has\r\nalways worked very closely with the IAEA as a partner\r\nin development.\r\nThis year marks the golden jubilee of the\r\nestablishment of the Department of Atomic Energy of\r\nIndia. Over the past fifty years, India’s atomic energy\r\nprogramme has come of age. The self-reliant research\r\nand development activities undertaken by the scientists\r\nof the Department of Atomic Energy have led to robust\r\nindustrial operations in heavy water power reactor\r\ntechnology and associated fuel cycle, heavy water and\r\nelectronics and instrumentation, which have all\r\ndemonstrated excellence in their commercial\r\nperformance. We are now well-poised to translate our\r\nresearch and development achievements into\r\ncommercial industrial activities related to fast power\r\nreactors and thorium reactors, as we continue to work\r\nfor rapid expansion of nuclear power capacity based on\r\nthermal reactors. This step is in tune with our long-\r\nstanding three-stage nuclear programme designed to\r\nmeet the emerging large-scale electricity requirements\r\nof the country through the use of our modest uranium\r\nand vast thorium resources.\r\nThe Prime Minister of India recently launched the\r\nconstruction of the first 500 megawatt electrical\r\nnuclear power plant based on fast breeder reactors in\r\nIndia at Kalpakkam. I recall the following points that\r\nour Prime Minister made on the occasion:\r\n“Energy security is an issue of vital\r\nimportance, particularly in the context of the\r\naccelerating pace of our economic growth. If we\r\nsucceed in instituting an optimal mix of energy\r\nresources in which nuclear energy is an important\r\ncomponent, we will be able to ensure our energy\r\nsecurity. India’s low per capita energy\r\nconsumption currently cannot for long go hand in\r\nhand with our quest for an accelerated pace of\r\neconomic growth. Energy security is therefore a\r\nnational imperative. We must break the\r\nconstraining limits of power shortages, which\r\nretard our development. Nuclear energy is not\r\nonly cost-effective, it is also a cleaner alternative\r\nto fossil fuels. We are determined as a nation to\r\nutilize its full potential for the national good. It\r\ncan also be a much-needed cushion against\r\nfluctuations of prices of petroleum products.”\r\nGiven the huge demand for energy in a fast-\r\ndeveloping economy like India, it has been our\r\nendeavour to develop comprehensive capabilities in the\r\nentire range of the nuclear fuel cycle, backed by\r\nresearch and development, and industrial and safety\r\ninfrastructure. India today is among the leading\r\ncountries that can reutilize spent fuel for production of\r\npower. This is essential to ensuring the sustained\r\navailability of nuclear power.\r\nIndia has made significant strides in developing\r\nnew technologies through indigenous research and\r\ndevelopment. The unique mixed plutonium-uranium\r\ncarbide fuel in fast breeder test reactors has had a\r\nremarkable performance record. With the successful\r\nreprocessing of spent fuel from fast breeder test\r\nreactors, the fuel cycle for this reactor has been closed.\r\nWork on a 300 megawatt electric advanced heavy\r\nwater reactor, a technology demonstration for thorium\r\nutilization, including several important developments\r\nin the thorium fuel cycle, is progressing well. The work\r\non a compact high temperature reactor is continuing.\r\nIndia is working on the construction of the\r\nsteady-state super-conducting tokamak, designed to be\r\nthe first 1000-second steady-state tokamak. This can be\r\nused for a number of physics investigations of\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nrelevance to the International Thermonuclear\r\nExperimental Reactor (ITER), which is an\r\nunprecedented international collaboration on the next\r\nmajor step for the development of fusion.\r\nIndia is a responsible nuclear Power. We have\r\ndeveloped our capability in this area in a self-reliant\r\nmanner and are fully conscious of the immense\r\nresponsibilities that come with the possession of such\r\nadvanced capabilities. We remain committed, at the\r\nsame time, to the objectives of non-proliferation.\r\nTherefore, as we continue to utilize our indigenous\r\nresources and capabilities to fulfil our national\r\ninterests, we are doing so in a way that meets the\r\nrequirements of those objectives. On the other hand,\r\nefforts to prevent proliferation should not impose\r\nundue restrictions on the development and utilization\r\nof nuclear energy.\r\nWe believe that it is incumbent upon all those\r\nwho have a stake in the future of nuclear energy to\r\nwork, in a constructive and cooperative manner,\r\ntowards elaborating more effective measures that\r\nwould check proliferation without constraining in any\r\nway the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Subject to this\r\nconsideration, India is willing to be a partner in this\r\neffort and shoulder the obligations that flow from it.\r\nIndia’s nuclear energy programme is operated\r\nunder the highest standards of safety and environment.\r\nSafety operations through the entire nuclear fuel cycle,\r\nfrom prospecting and mining of ores to the\r\nmanagement of waste, encompass all the aspects of\r\nsafety, including the radiological, industrial,\r\noccupational, fire and environmental spheres. An\r\nindependent entity, the Atomic Energy Regulatory\r\nBody, monitors safety in conformity with standards\r\nrecommended by the IAEA and the International\r\nCommission on Radiological Protection. Our\r\nindigenous reactors have multilayer safety features.\r\nThe safety record of our reactors is among the best in\r\nthe world.\r\nThe role of the IAEA in promoting several\r\ndevelopmental programmes for the betterment of\r\nhumankind by using nuclear technologies is unique,\r\nand must be encouraged and expanded. The Agency\r\nshould, however, continue to operate within its\r\ntechnical expertise and in a transparent manner. It\r\nshould not be utilized for political ends or objectives\r\nbeyond its original purpose, which is that of promoting\r\nsafe, secure and peaceful nuclear technologies.\r\nIndia has been an active supporter of IAEA\r\nprogrammes related to nuclear power, especially with\r\nregard to innovative nuclear reactors and fuel cycles.\r\nWe have also been an active partner in programmes\r\nrelated to the safety and security of radioactive\r\nsources, managing nuclear knowledge — including\r\nknowledge-preservation and knowledge-dissemination —\r\nand strengthening education and training for capacity-\r\nbuilding through networking. Several IAEA meetings,\r\ntraining programmes for IAEA fellows and scientific\r\nvisits continue to take place in India. Our scientists\r\nhave participated in a large number of IAEA expert\r\nassignments and coordinated research projects.\r\nWe re-emphasise that the IAEA, the unique,\r\nmultidisciplinary, science-and-technology organization in\r\nthe entire United Nations system, merits the unstinting\r\nsupport of the international community.\r\nMr. Sriwidjaja (Indonesia): Having listened with\r\ngreat interest to the comprehensive statement delivered\r\nby the Director General of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), who has highlighted the work\r\ndone and the developments that have taken place\r\nconcerning the IAEA during 2003-2004, my delegation\r\nwould like to take this opportunity to express its\r\nappreciation to Mr. Mohammed ElBaradei, IAEA\r\nDirector General, as well as to the IAEA secretariat for\r\ntheir significant and valuable work in fulfilling the\r\nthree pillars of the Agency’s mandate. Indonesia\r\npledges its full support to the IAEA, as one of the\r\norganizations of the United Nation system, to continue\r\nto uphold and maintain its central and universal role in\r\naddressing the enormous challenges ahead.\r\nIndonesia is looking into the possibility of\r\nincorporating nuclear energy into its national energy\r\npolicy for the period 2004 to 2020, as promulgated by\r\nthe Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, which\r\nconsiders nuclear energy an essential component of the\r\nlong-term energy needs of Indonesia. The results of the\r\nIAEA’s supporting project on a comprehensive\r\nassessment of various energy sources for electricity\r\ngeneration in Indonesia — conducted during 2001 and\r\n2002 — have been included in the long-term planning\r\nfor Indonesia’s energy policy.\r\nIn anticipation of the introduction of a nuclear\r\npower plant, the Indonesian Nuclear Energy\r\nRegulatory Agency has embarked upon a\r\ncomprehensive programme to develop the necessary\r\ninfrastructure — including personnel — particularly in\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nactivities connected with the licensing and inspection\r\nof nuclear power plants. The cooperation and\r\nassistance provided by the Agency with regard to\r\ncapacity-building in the area of regulatory authorities\r\nis therefore still needed. In addition, bilateral and\r\nmultilateral cooperation with advanced countries\r\nexperienced in developing and operating nuclear power\r\nplants has become a necessity.\r\nPursuant to the IAEA’s Technical Cooperation\r\nReport for 2003, my delegation notes with satisfaction\r\nthat commitments and support from Member States\r\nwere clearly marked by a significant increase in\r\nextrabudgetary resources for the Agency’s Technical\r\nCooperation Programme. A record high level of\r\nsupport — $11.8 million, up from $5.7 million in\r\n2002 — reflects a commitment to bring about change\r\nfor the improvement of socio-economic conditions\r\nthrough the use of nuclear technology for peaceful\r\npurposes. We also note with satisfaction that\r\n90 Country Programme Frameworks — 32 more than\r\nin 2002 — were utilized as planning tools to design,\r\nwithin the context of national priorities, technical\r\ncooperation projects that are now in place or awaiting\r\nfinal approval. In that connection, the Indonesian\r\ndelegation at the IAEA’s 48th General Conference,\r\nwhich was held in September 2004, officially\r\nsubmitted a new revised version of its Country\r\nProgramme Framework, which was signed in\r\nNovember 2000.\r\nBearing in mind the significance of Country\r\nProgramme Frameworks to national development, and\r\nthe Agency’s technical assistance programme, it is\r\nessential to reiterate the importance of international\r\ncooperation in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy, which is one of the fundamental pillars of the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT). The validity of article IV of the NPT and the\r\ninalienable right of all States parties to unimpeded and\r\nnon-discriminatory transfer of nuclear technology and\r\nmaterials to developing countries play an indispensable\r\nrole in catering to the requirements of national\r\ndevelopment. That is in line with the role of the\r\nAgency in assisting States parties to formulate\r\ninternational cooperative projects within the\r\nframework of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy\r\nthrough the development of effective programmes\r\naimed at improving their scientific, technological and\r\nregulatory capabilities based on each country’s priority\r\nneeds and decisions.\r\nFor over two decades, Indonesia has been\r\ncommitted to the promotion of the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy through the development and\r\nstrengthening of links and cooperation, both at the\r\nbilateral and multilateral levels, and especially with the\r\nIAEA. Through the support provided by its technical\r\nassistance programme, we have successfully applied\r\nnuclear techniques in many areas of national\r\ndevelopment programmes, including agriculture,\r\nindustry, health care and environmental protection. In\r\nview of the plan to introduce nuclear power in the\r\ncountry as a strategic component to obtain an optimal\r\nlong-term mix in Indonesia’s sustainable national\r\nenergy supply system, it is our intention to further\r\nstrengthen such cooperation, not only with the Agency\r\nbut also with countries that pioneered the application\r\nof this segment of nuclear technology.\r\nIndonesia notes the progress made in the field of\r\nnuclear verification. According to IAEA document\r\nGC(48)/11, on strengthening the effectiveness and\r\nimproving the efficiency of the safeguards system,\r\nincluding the implementation of additional protocols,\r\nthe number of safeguards agreements and additional\r\nprotocols signed or in force has increased markedly.\r\nThe total number of States with safeguards agreements\r\nhas now reached 149, while the number of States with\r\nadditional protocols in force has grown from 35 to 59.\r\nDespite the progress made so far, our task is not yet\r\ncompleted, as 108 States — including 17 with known\r\nsignificant nuclear activities — have yet to sign\r\nadditional protocols, while 25 States — including 12\r\nwith significant nuclear activities — have signed\r\nadditional protocols but still need to bring them into\r\nforce.\r\nMoreover, of the States parties to the NPT, 43\r\nhave yet to bring into force comprehensive safeguards\r\nagreements with the Agency, pursuant to that Treaty. If\r\nthe IAEA safeguards system is to be able to provide\r\ncredible assurances regarding non-diversion of nuclear\r\nmaterial and about the absence of undeclared nuclear\r\nmaterial and activities, it must be given the requisite\r\nauthority. Therefore, in line with document\r\nGC(48)/RES/14, Indonesia calls upon all States having\r\nmade non-proliferation commitments — in particular\r\nthose with significant nuclear activities — to bring into\r\nforce and implement the legal instruments of the\r\nstrengthened safeguards system.\r\nTo this end, Indonesia has initiated the\r\nimplementation of integrated safeguards at the State\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nlevel. We strongly believe that these measures will\r\nstrengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency\r\nof the safeguards system and the application of the\r\nmodel additional protocol, as well as the Agency’s\r\nverification system. We also strongly believe that\r\nStates — developing countries in particular — having\r\nAdditional Protocols in place, in their pursuit of the\r\ndevelopment, production, and application of nuclear\r\nenergy and knowledge for peaceful purposes, should be\r\ngranted preferential treatment in obtaining technical\r\ncooperation for the advancement of their national\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn the field of nuclear security and safety,\r\nIndonesia commends the IAEA’s efforts to assist\r\nMember States in increasing their nuclear security, as\r\nwell as the Agency’s high priority for formulating\r\nmeasures to prevent the theft of nuclear material and\r\nthe sabotage of nuclear facilities. The Agency’s shared\r\nconcern over the risk of radiological terrorism has\r\ngiven increased emphasis to improving the security of\r\nother radioactive material and to countering illicit\r\ntrafficking.\r\nIndonesia expresses its appreciation to the IAEA\r\nfor having dispatched expert missions to Indonesia\r\naimed at strengthening the physical protection of our\r\nnuclear and radiological infrastructure. Such technical\r\nassistance provided by the Agency is not merely\r\nembedded in the preparation of a conceptual\r\nframework, but is also central to improving the existing\r\nrules and regulations for nuclear safety and radiation\r\nprotection, as well as the enhancement of our human\r\nresources capabilities.\r\nIn this connection, Indonesia reiterates its widely\r\nshared view that nuclear security must be one of the\r\nworld’s priorities and, accordingly, calls upon all\r\nconcerned parties to do their utmost in supporting\r\nefforts to strengthen international cooperation, as\r\nhighlighted in the 48th General Conference resolutions\r\nGC(48)/RES/10 and GC(48)/RES/11, on measures to\r\nstrengthen international cooperation in nuclear,\r\nradiation and transport safety and waste safety, and\r\nprogress on measures to protect against nuclear and\r\nradiological terrorism, respectively.\r\nMr. López (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): We wish to\r\nthank Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General, for\r\nintroducing the annual report of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which covers the\r\nperiod from 1 January through 31 December 2003.\r\nAs can be seen clearly from the IAEA annual\r\nreport, the Cuban Government has continued to take\r\npositive steps that clearly show its political\r\ndetermination to comply with all obligations it has\r\nundertaken as a State party to the Nuclear Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty (NPT) and the Treaty for the\r\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco).\r\nOn 18 September 2003, the Republic of Cuba\r\nsigned both the IAEA comprehensive safeguards\r\nagreement and its Additional Protocol. Subsequently,\r\non 27 May 2004, we ratified the comprehensive\r\nsafeguards agreement and the corresponding\r\nAdditional Protocol. On 23 August 2004, Cuba\r\nsubmitted to the secretariat of the IAEA its initial\r\nreport on nuclear material, reaffirming Cuba’s\r\ndetermination to continue to strengthen its cooperation\r\nwith the IAEA in the development of peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy.\r\nIn addition, we wish to recall that on 5 and\r\n6 November 2003, as further evidence of our firm\r\ncommitment to peace and to multilateralism, my\r\ncountry hosted the 18th regular session of the General\r\nConference of the Agency for the Prohibition of\r\nNuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nThat event concluded successfully and adopted a final\r\ndocument, the Havana Declaration. The Conference\r\nwas an appropriate occasion for officially recognizing\r\nCuba’s ratification of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which\r\nallowed for the full entry into force of this international\r\ninstrument and the consolidation of the first densely\r\npopulated zone of the planet as a zone completely free\r\nof nuclear weapons. All of those actions are completely\r\nin line with our position of principle that military\r\ndoctrines based on the possession of nuclear weapons\r\nare unacceptable.\r\nIn turn, as a State party to the NPT, Cuba has\r\nbeen actively involved in the preparatory process for\r\nthe upcoming NPT Review Conference. We are\r\nconvinced that the only way to overcome limitations to\r\nthe NPT is precisely by complying with the objective\r\nof the total elimination of all nuclear weapons under\r\nstrict international verification. That would guarantee\r\nthe use of nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful\r\npurposes, which is the main objective of the IAEA.\r\nIn compliance with the provisions of the NPT, the\r\nlegitimate right of States to have full access to nuclear\r\nenergy for peaceful purposes must be respected. The\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nimposition of unilateral restrictive measures in the\r\nexchange of equipment, material and scientific and\r\ntechnological information for the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy must be halted. In addition, we reiterate\r\nour rejection of the approach that favours horizontal\r\nnon-proliferation, without bearing in mind the constant\r\nincrease in vertical proliferation.\r\nCuba places particular importance on the\r\nactivities of the IAEA, and we reiterate the need to\r\nachieve an adequate balance among the three basic\r\npillars of that organization, namely, technical\r\ncooperation, safety and verification.\r\nWe highlight the role of the IAEA, not only as a\r\nguarantor of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, but\r\nalso as an institution that promotes and implements\r\ninternational cooperation in that field. In that regard,\r\nmy country hopes the General Assembly will reaffirm\r\nthe Agency’s role, in accordance with the objectives\r\nand functions set out in its Statute in promoting\r\nresearch, development and the practical application of\r\natomic energy for peaceful purposes.\r\nWe believe that a balance must exist between\r\nresources devoted to cooperation activities and those\r\ndevoted to other activities of the Agency. In addition,\r\nmy Government recognizes the important role played\r\nby nuclear technology for sustainable development,\r\nand we feel that technical cooperation activities of the\r\nIAEA are a vital element in the transfer of technology.\r\nHistorically, Cuba has benefited from this\r\ncooperation, and there are excellent signs of\r\nimplementation, as well as an efficient use of\r\nresources. These resources have been aimed at priority\r\nprogrammes in the country in areas such as health,\r\nagriculture and industry, which have had a significant\r\nimpact as a result of their implementation. For\r\nexample, the implementation of a number of IAEA\r\ntechnical cooperation projects have contributed to\r\nimproving our radiotherapy services, an important\r\ncomponent in Cuba’s programme to combat cancer that\r\nit has carried out for a number of years.\r\nAs a result, and despite enormous difficulties\r\ncaused by the economic, commercial and financial\r\nblockade imposed on it, Cuba has continued to comply\r\nsystematically with its financial commitments to the\r\nIAEA.\r\nIn addition, Cuba wishes to reiterate its support\r\nfor the Regional Cooperative Agreement for the\r\nAdvancement of Nuclear Science and Technology in\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean.\r\nCuba supports the efforts of the IAEA to\r\nimplement programmes and activities aimed at\r\nproviding protection against nuclear terrorism without\r\naffecting the human and financial resources involved in\r\nsustainable socio-economic development. In that\r\nregard, my delegation wishes to reiterate that only\r\ninternational cooperation based on full respect for the\r\nprinciples of international law, as well as the purposes\r\nand principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter,\r\ncan provide an effective and sustainable response to\r\nthe scourge of terrorism worldwide, including\r\nterrorism in which weapons of mass destruction are\r\nused.\r\nThe use of selective non-transparent mechanisms\r\nthat function outside the United Nations and outside\r\ninternational treaties do not in any way provide an\r\nappropriate response to the phenomena of international\r\nterrorism, including terrorism involving the use of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, their delivery systems or\r\nrelated materials.\r\nMr. Kitaoka (Japan): Let me begin by expressing\r\nmy appreciation for the detailed report by\r\nMr. Mohammed ElBaradei on the activities of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\r\nAt present, the international nuclear non-\r\nproliferation regime is facing serious challenges, and\r\nstrengthening the non-proliferation regime is one of the\r\nmost important tasks requiring action on the part of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nAt the same time, nuclear energy remains an\r\nimportant source of energy and contributes to the\r\nstability of the energy supply and the prevention of\r\nglobal warming. The peaceful applications of nuclear\r\nenergy, which extend to such fields as health,\r\nagriculture and industry, are extremely beneficial to the\r\neconomic and social development of the international\r\ncommunity. It is for that reason that the dual role of the\r\nIAEA in promoting both the strengthening of the\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime and the peaceful use\r\nof nuclear energy has taken on increasing importance.\r\nToday I would like to mention briefly several of\r\nthe activities of the IAEA that Japan considers to be the\r\nmost important.\r\nFirst, strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation\r\nregime is one of Japan’s top foreign policy priorities.\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nNext year, 2005, is important in that it marks the\r\nsixtieth anniversary of the atomic bombings of Japan\r\nand the Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) will be\r\nconvened . The international community is widely\r\nexpected to renew its commitment to nuclear\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation at that Review\r\nConference and intensify its efforts towards the\r\nrealization of disarmament, particularly nuclear\r\ndisarmament.\r\nFor the purpose of achieving substantive\r\nreinforcement of the nuclear non-proliferation regime,\r\nstrengthening of IAEA safeguards will be key. Japan,\r\nfor its part, is continuing its efforts for the\r\nuniversalization of the NPT’s Additional Protocol,\r\nwhich it regards as the most realistic and effective\r\nroute to achieving that goal. I take this opportunity to\r\nurge those countries that have not yet concluded the\r\nAdditional Protocol to do so at the earliest possible\r\ndate.\r\nSecondly, the nuclear programmes of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea poses a threat\r\nto the peace and stability of the North-East Asia region\r\nand a major challenge to the international nuclear non-\r\nproliferation regime. Japan strongly urges the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to comply with\r\nall international agreements pertaining to nuclear\r\nissues, including the NPT, and to abandon all of its\r\nnuclear programmes, including its uranium enrichment\r\nprogramme, in their entirety under credible\r\ninternational verification.\r\nThirdly, with regard to Iran, it is essential that the\r\nIranian Government sincerely implement all\r\nrequirements of the relevant IAEA resolutions. Efforts\r\nby Iran to enhance transparency and thereby dispel the\r\ndeep concern of the international community will be\r\nessential for the early resolution of this issue.\r\nJapan highly appreciates Libya’s decision to\r\nabandon its nuclear programme and all other weapon\r\nof mass destruction programmes and move forward in\r\ncooperation with the international community. This\r\nrepresents one of the past year’s great successes. We\r\nstrongly urge other States of concern with respect to\r\nnuclear proliferation to follow Libya’s example and\r\ncommit to cooperating fully with the IAEA.\r\nFinally, as a result of Japan’s long years of\r\ncooperation, the implementation of integrated\r\nsafeguards began in September of this year, making\r\nJapan the first country engaged in large-scale nuclear\r\nenergy activities to implement those safeguards. In\r\nterms of both the enforcement of the measures and the\r\nexample that it sets for other countries, we regard the\r\nimplementation of integrated safeguards in Japan as a\r\ngreat accomplishment. Japan also welcomes the\r\ndecisions taken by the IAEA from the point of view of\r\nencouraging the effective use of the limited resources\r\navailable to us.\r\nThe international community is confronted with\r\nmajor challenges as it endeavours to strengthen the\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime. At the same time, the\r\nexpectations placed in the IAEA and the roles it is\r\nrequired to play have expanded. Be assured that Japan\r\nwill continue to provide active assistance to the IAEA\r\nin fulfilling its critical mission.\r\nMr. Dolgov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): We are happy to welcome the Director\r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA), Mr. ElBaradei, and we are grateful to him for\r\nhaving introduced the annual report of the Agency.\r\nRussia as an active member of the IAEA, is\r\npleased with the activities of the Agency and takes note\r\nof its important and increasing role and significance in\r\nstrengthening the international nuclear weapons non-\r\nproliferation regime and in providing for the necessary\r\nlevel of trust for cooperation in the peaceful uses of\r\natomic energy and the safe development of atomic\r\nenergy. We reaffirm the need to further strengthen the\r\nsafeguards system at the Agency and to enhance its\r\neffectiveness as the basis of the non-proliferation\r\nregime.\r\nThe particular relevance of effective action in the\r\narea of non-proliferation is dictated by the threat of\r\nweapons of mass destruction (WMDs) falling into the\r\nhands of terrorists. The savagery of recent terrorist\r\nacts, including in Russia, highlights the need to provide\r\nfor effective guarantees to prevent access by terrorists\r\nto WMDs, particularly by reinforcing the joint efforts\r\nto create a global system to deal with the relevant\r\nchallenges and threats, including nuclear ones.\r\nRussia advocates very close international\r\npartnership in this area and is taking an active part in\r\nworking in the area of non-proliferation. We were one\r\nof the initiators of Security Council resolution 1540\r\n(2004). We are a party to the Proliferation Security\r\nInitiative, and we were a sponsor of the plan of action\r\nof the Group of Eight in the area of non-proliferation.\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nThese initiatives are very much interlinked and should\r\nhelp to enhance the effectiveness of the WMD non-\r\nproliferation regime, which is particularly important on\r\nthe eve of the 2005 Review Conference of the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\r\nWe reiterate the key importance of the NPT in\r\nproviding for international security. Unfortunately, the\r\noutcome of the recent session of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee for the Conference did not inspire\r\noptimism. It is important that all parties to the Treaty\r\napproach the 2005 review mindful of the need to\r\npreserve the NPT and to enhance its effectiveness on\r\nthe basis of the non-proliferation regime.\r\nRussia has consistently advocated the further\r\nstrengthening of strategic stability. The Russian-\r\nAmerican Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions\r\ncame into force in June 2003 and constitutes a real\r\ncontribution to implementing the obligations under\r\narticle VI of the NPT. The importance of this Treaty\r\ntranscends bilateral relations and is in the interest of all\r\nStates. We also continue to implement the agreement\r\nbetween the Government of the Russian Federation and\r\nthe United States of America dated 18 February 1993\r\nregarding the use of highly enriched uranium derived\r\nfrom nuclear weapons.\r\nWe would like to reaffirm our support for the\r\nIAEA project on innovative nuclear reactors and fuel\r\ncycles, which is being carried out under the aegis of\r\nthe Agency pursuant to the resolution adopted by its\r\nGeneral Conference in 2000 on the subject of\r\nstrengthening the activities of the Agency relating to\r\nnuclear science, technology and applications. We view\r\nthat project as a practical step to implement the\r\ninitiative put forward at the Millennium Summit by the\r\nPresident of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, to\r\ndevelop nuclear technologies that are resistant to\r\nproliferation.\r\nRussia attaches great importance to the research\r\nand development of new nuclear technologies. In\r\nkeeping with our Government-endorsed strategy for\r\ndeveloping nuclear energy in Russia in the first half of\r\nthe twenty-first century, work is being carried out on a\r\nnumber of innovative projects using fast neutron\r\nreactors, which will make it possible to resolve the\r\nproblem of the use of weapons-grade plutonium in\r\nnuclear power stations with a fully closed fuel cycle.\r\nAllow me to dwell on a few aspects of the\r\nAgency’s activities that have great resonance around\r\nthe world. We have been following developments\r\nregarding the nuclear programme of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran and we continue to advocate the\r\nresolution of all outstanding questions in that regard\r\nthrough constructive interaction between Iran and the\r\nIAEA. We note the importance of prompt Agency\r\naction to switch its monitoring activities in that country\r\ninto normal, routine channels, as is now the case in\r\nmost States parties to the NPT, and we will work\r\ntowards attaining that goal in the future. We hope that\r\nIran will fully implement the provisions of the\r\nSeptember resolution adopted by the IAEA Board of\r\nGovernors. We view that resolution as the Board of\r\nGovernors plan of action, and we hope that by the\r\nNovember meeting of the Board it will be possible to\r\nclarify once and for all the questions that the Agency\r\nstill has concerning past activities of Tehran in this\r\narea.\r\nOn the questions surrounding the nuclear\r\nprogramme of the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea, we would like to note that Russia has made\r\npolitical and diplomatic efforts for the prompt\r\nresumption of talks to resolve North Korea’s nuclear\r\nproblems within the six-party format. A comprehensive\r\nresolution of the problem should include the\r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula, winding up\r\nthe military nuclear programme of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, the return of that country\r\nto the NPT regime and the renewal of its cooperation\r\nwith the IAEA, while providing for the legitimate\r\ninterests of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nthrough giving it security guarantees and creating\r\nconditions for the normal economic development of\r\nthat country.\r\nI would like to reaffirm our support for draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.18, entitled “Report of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency”. Russia, fully\r\ncognizant of the importance of the work done by the\r\nAgency, has joined in sponsoring that draft.\r\nMr. De Figueiredo (Angola): On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, I am pleased to convey to you,\r\nMr. President, our warm congratulations on your well-\r\ndeserved election. We are happy to see you presiding\r\nover the work of the General Assembly at its present\r\nsession. Your election is a recognition of your high\r\ndiplomatic skills and wide experience, as well as your\r\ncountry’s important role within the international\r\ncommunity. We also extend congratulations to your\r\nteam.\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nSince its foundation in 1957, the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has sought to\r\naccelerate and enlarge the contribution of nuclear\r\nenergy to peace, health and prosperity.\r\nWe have carefully reviewed the report of the\r\nAgency for 2003 and, in that regard, would like to\r\nexpress our appreciation for Agency activities\r\ndeveloped under the three pillars of technical\r\ncooperation, safety and verification. In particular, my\r\ndelegation appreciates the Agency’s endeavours in\r\ndeveloping nuclear applications and technologies for\r\nthe benefit of African States, assisting us in applying\r\nnuclear technologies in the quest for sustainable\r\ndevelopment. In Africa we are still far from reaching\r\nthe ultimate goal of providing our populations with\r\nadequate, healthy facilities, sufficient food and water\r\nand a safe environment.\r\nAt its forty-eighth session, the General\r\nConference of the IAEA approved three resolutions on\r\ntopics of the highest importance for the African\r\ncontinent: support for the African Union’s Pan-African\r\nTsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign;\r\ndevelopment of the sterile insect technique for the\r\ncontrol and eradication of malaria-transmitting\r\nmosquitoes; and the IAEA Programme of Action for\r\nCancer Therapy. The implementation of those\r\nprogrammes is extremely important as they contribute\r\nto saving lives, as well as to reducing poverty, in the\r\nAfrican region.\r\nTsetse flies — and the trypanosomiasis disease\r\nwhich they transmit — are a major transnational\r\nAfrican problem and one of the greatest constraints on\r\nthe socio-economic development of the African\r\ncontinent, affecting the health of humans and livestock,\r\nlimiting land use and causing increased poverty. The\r\ndisease claims the lives of tens of thousands of humans\r\nand millions of domestic animals every year,\r\nthreatening over 60 million people in 37 countries —\r\nmost of which are IAEA member States. Therefore, my\r\ncountry encourages the Agency to continue supporting\r\nAfrican member States in their efforts to use the sterile\r\ninsect technique to create tsetse-free-zones in Africa.\r\nWith regard to malaria, the development of the\r\nsterile insect technique for the control and eradication\r\nof mosquitoes is crucial. Malaria causes approximately\r\n2 million deaths yearly, with over 90 per cent of the\r\nworld’s malaria cases occurring in Africa. The Agency\r\nshould therefore intensify research with a view to\r\nenabling the use of the sterile insect technique for the\r\ncontrol and eradication of malaria-transmitting\r\nmosquitoes. IAEA research, however, needs to\r\nincreasingly involve more African and other\r\ndeveloping member States’ scientific and research\r\ninstitutes in their research programmes.\r\nThe increasing number of new cases of cancer\r\nand, consequently, the number of deaths it causes\r\nworldwide, particularly affects developing countries\r\nand threatens their socio-economic development. The\r\nuse of existing nuclear technology for diagnosis and\r\ntreatment could cure many cases of cancer if detected\r\nearly. Unfortunately, appropriate technologies,\r\nincluding cobalt radiotherapy, are not available for\r\nmost cancer patients in developing countries.\r\nConsidering the ongoing contributions of the\r\nAgency in the field of human health — in particular to\r\nnuclear medicine, including cobalt radiotherapy\r\nservices in developing countries — and the financial\r\nand other participation of member States and others in\r\nthe IAEA programme, we propose that the Agency\r\nstrengthen its involvement in international partnerships\r\nwith non-traditional donors in this area.\r\nThe Republic of Angola was admitted in 1999 as\r\na member of the IAEA and since then it has benefited\r\nfrom the assistance provided by the Agency under its\r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme. At present, we\r\nhave four ongoing national projects in the areas of\r\nnuclear physics, the diagnosis of animal diseases,\r\nradiotherapy and marine pollution. We have also been\r\nparticipating in several regional projects. However, it is\r\nimportant to stress that we can only maximize the\r\nbenefits from such assistance if it includes training our\r\nwell-educated nationals in nuclear science and\r\ntechniques.\r\nCapacity-building is of key importance to the\r\nAngolan Government programme. In that regard, we\r\nnote that through activities organized by the IAEA, our\r\ntechnicians participate in seminars, workshops,\r\nconferences, scientific visits, fellowship programmes\r\nand other events, while Agency expert missions — in\r\nthe framework of IAEA projects and programmes —\r\nhave been actively working in our country.\r\nAfrica attaches great importance to the Agency’s\r\nactivities related to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. The Agency’s role as international\r\nnuclear watchdog is considered by the Angolan\r\nGovernment to be of paramount importance. Therefore,\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nmy country expects that all NPT States parties will\r\nrespect the Agency’s statutory mandate to verify\r\ncompliance with the Treaty. The objective of the NPT\r\nis to rid the world of the nuclear threat, and that will be\r\npossible only if all nuclear weapons are eliminated.\r\nThe Republic of Angola has every reason to\r\nsupport the adoption of the report of the IAEA.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate His Excellency\r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei on the very efficient and\r\nexcellent manner in which he is leading the Agency.\r\nWe would like to emphasize the consistent impartiality\r\nwith which he carries out his functions.\r\nMr. Danesh-Yazdi (Islamic Republic of Iran): I\r\nwould like to begin by expressing our sincere\r\nappreciation to the Director General of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),\r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, for his informative report to\r\nthe General Assembly on the main developments in the\r\nAgency’s activities during 2003. We hope that his\r\ntireless efforts to advance the non-proliferation regime\r\nwill be crowned with success.\r\nThe present report of the IAEA, transmitted by\r\ndocument A/59/295, refers to various activities that the\r\nAgency has undertaken to fulfil its important and\r\nsensitive mandate. As the report indicates, 2003 was a\r\nyear of notable success for the Agency in its efforts to\r\nensure that the benefits of nuclear technology were\r\nshared globally for economic and social development.\r\nIndeed, the IAEA is required by its Statute to “seek to\r\naccelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic\r\nenergy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the\r\nworld”. That requirement not only entrusts the Agency\r\nwith a specific responsibility but also underlines the\r\nimportance of nuclear technology for the advancement\r\nof human society.\r\nAs a common heritage of humanity, nuclear\r\ntechnology has broad applications, ranging from\r\nmedicine and agriculture to providing a renewable\r\nenergy source. The applications of “atoms for health”,\r\nnuclear techniques and food production and managing\r\nthe world’s scarce resources of fresh water, referred to\r\nin the report, are gaining increasing importance as\r\ntools for social and economic development. Therefore,\r\nthe Agency can and should play a central role in the\r\nenhancement of technical cooperation among States\r\nparties, including by promoting the scientific,\r\ntechnological and regulatory capabilities of developing\r\ncountries through technology transfer and capacity-\r\nbuilding.\r\nA particular area in which nuclear technology has\r\nbeen increasingly seen as essential is related to nuclear\r\npower plants. The IAEA, in its resolution\r\nGC(43)RES/14 of 1 October 1999, recognized that\r\n“many countries consider nuclear power, being a\r\nclimatically benign source of energy, to be an eligible\r\noption under the Clean Development Mechanism of the\r\nKyoto Protocol”. In that context, the IAEA General\r\nConference requested the Director General to pursue\r\nefforts to strengthen the Agency’s technical\r\ncooperation activities aimed at improving the\r\nscientific, technological and regulatory capabilities of\r\ndeveloping countries by continuing to assist in, inter\r\nalia, nuclear energy production for those States that\r\npursue it as a component of their energy mix in the\r\ntwenty-first century. We welcome the report of the\r\nDirector General, in which he outlined the Agency’s\r\nactivities in those important areas.\r\nThe inalienable right of all States parties to\r\npeaceful applications of nuclear technology, without\r\ndiscrimination, constitutes the very foundation of the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT). In accordance with article IV of the NPT, States\r\nparties undertake to facilitate the fullest possible\r\nexchange of equipment, materials and scientific and\r\ntechnological information for the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy. The implementation of that basic\r\nprovision requires the adoption of a realistic and\r\nbalanced approach to the rights and obligations of the\r\nStates parties to the NPT. Indeed, such a balanced\r\napproach would guarantee the longevity of the present\r\nlegal regime by providing incentives for membership\r\nand compliance.\r\nThe provisions of the NPT and of the IAEA\r\nStatute with regard to the right to nuclear technology,\r\nas well as the imperative of technology cooperation\r\nand sharing among those who have accepted the\r\nobligations of non-proliferation, attest to the wisdom\r\nand understanding of the drafters of those two\r\nimportant documents. However, we should not allow\r\nthe idea to become entrenched that membership in the\r\nNPT and in the IAEA safeguards regime in fact\r\nconstitutes an impediment to peaceful use, while non-\r\nmembership is rewarded by acquiescence, as in the\r\ncase of the development of one of the world’s largest\r\nnuclear-weapon stockpiles, located in the Middle East.\r\nIf anything, the failure of the only party outside the\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nNPT in the Middle East to accept the obligations of the\r\nTreaty and of the safeguards regime should have\r\nresulted in punishment under the most severe\r\nrestrictions, rather than the reward of impunity.\r\nThe inalienable right of States parties to the NPT,\r\nenshrined in its article IV, shall not under any\r\ncircumstances be restricted so long as that right is\r\nexercised for peaceful purposes and under the IAEA\r\nsafeguards system. Accordingly, national efforts to\r\ndevelop, research, produce and use nuclear energy for\r\npeaceful purposes with a view to fostering economic\r\ndevelopment should not be hampered by ulterior\r\nexternal political considerations. No consideration\r\nother than the requirements of the Treaty should\r\npreclude the fulfilment of the rights and obligations of\r\nStates parties under the provisions of the Treaty.\r\nIran, as an original State party to the NPT, is\r\ncommitted to its obligations under the Treaty. At the\r\nsame time, we are determined to exercise our\r\ninalienable right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful\r\npurposes, as enshrined in article IV of the Treaty. Iran’s\r\ndecision and determination to pursue nuclear electricity\r\ngeneration is based on well-justified technical and\r\nfinancial grounds. The added value of limited fossil\r\nresources, the uses of those resources in other\r\nindustries, concern over environmental pollution and\r\nthe need to benefit from various energy options have\r\nconvinced the Iranian Government to decide to apply\r\nnuclear energy to electricity generation, with a total\r\ncapacity of 7,000 Megawatts by the year 2020. To that\r\nend, Iran has invested extensive human and material\r\nresources in that field. However, it should be clearly\r\nstated that — as has been repeatedly stated — nuclear\r\nand other weapons of mass destruction have no place\r\nin Iran’s defence doctrine, not only because of our\r\nreligious convictions and our obligations under the\r\nNPT and other relevant conventions, but also because\r\nof a sober strategic calculation.\r\nYet, illegitimate sanctions have targeted not only\r\nIran’s legitimate nuclear programme, but in fact the\r\ncountry’s whole industrial sector and all its possible\r\nsources of supplies of material and equipment. What\r\nIran has been able to achieve is primarily the result of\r\nthe intellect and hard work of Iranian scientists.\r\nRegrettably, a politically charged atmosphere of\r\nconcern has been orchestrated about this limited\r\npeaceful capability that has little to do with the\r\nobjectives of non-proliferation. Under such\r\ncircumstances, a mere clarification of intentions and\r\nsecurity doctrine may not suffice to convince all\r\npartners.\r\nTo remedy the situation, Iran has taken\r\nsignificant steps to further enhance confidence by, in\r\nparticular, signing and implementing an additional\r\nprotocol to its IAEA safeguards agreement in\r\nDecember 2003, as well as by maintaining a voluntary\r\nsuspension of its enrichment activities since last\r\nNovember. Iran is also currently engaged in\r\nnegotiations with France, Germany and the United\r\nKingdom to reach mutual objective assurances on\r\nnuclear cooperation, transparency and non-diversion.\r\nThose negotiations will bear fruit if mutual\r\nunderstanding, political will and good faith prevail.\r\nWe are pleased to note that the recent reports of\r\nthe Agency provide a clear indication that major and\r\ndecisive steps have been taken by both IAEA and Iran\r\ntowards resolving outstanding issues. The present\r\nverification activities, which go beyond the safeguards\r\nagreement and the additional protocol, represent an\r\nimportant achievement for both Iran and IAEA. It\r\nneeds to be borne in mind that the lack of identified or\r\nknown criteria and timelines on the basis of which Iran\r\ncould organize itself for robust inspections has required\r\nIran to provide information or to grant access,\r\nprimarily after requests were made by the Agency, but\r\nin particular, when a certain State, based on its already\r\nproved failed intelligence, occasionally raised concerns\r\nover irrelevant sites — concerns that have always\r\nproved to be wrong.\r\nHowever, in the spirit of cooperation and as\r\nconfirmed by the Agency’s report, action has been\r\ntaken to satisfy the requests of the Agency in the\r\nfullest and most speedy manner possible. Over 800\r\nperson-days of inspections have been carried out in\r\nIran since February 2003, amounting to one of the most\r\nrobust and intrusive verifications in the history of the\r\nAgency.\r\nOn the basis of the recent IAEA report, one can\r\nbriefly conclude that there has been no evidence of\r\ndiversion in Iran’s nuclear programme; that the Agency\r\nis making steady progress in understanding the nature\r\nand extent of Iran’s nuclear programme; that Iran is\r\nacting as if it had ratified the additional protocol and\r\nhas submitted over 1,030 pages of its initial\r\ndeclaration, pursuant to the additional protocol; that\r\nsome previously outstanding issues have reached the\r\npoint where the further follow-up needed will be\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\ncarried out as part of routine safeguards\r\nimplementation; and that, based on the Agency’s\r\nanalysis to date, it appears plausible that the\r\ncontamination found at various locations in Iran has\r\nnot been the result of the enrichment of uranium by\r\nIran. Those facts and conclusions provide a clear\r\npicture of Iran’s nuclear programme and remove the\r\nconcerns and ambiguities casting a shadow over its\r\npeaceful nature.\r\nBefore concluding my statement, I would like to\r\nemphasize the firm determination of the Government\r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran to continue its\r\ncooperation with the Agency, in good faith and with\r\nfull transparency. In our view, the progress achieved\r\nthrough our cooperation with IAEA will assist the\r\nAgency to draw definitive conclusions and to remove\r\nthis issue from its agenda in the near future.\r\nMr. Effah-Apenteng (Ghana): My delegation\r\nwishes to pay its compliments to Mr. Mohammed\r\nElBaradei, Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his continued\r\nprofessionalism and competence in managing the\r\naffairs of the Agency during the course of the past year.\r\nWe also wish to express our gratitude to him and his\r\nentire staff for the production of the Agency’s annual\r\nreport for 2003, which is the focus of the deliberations\r\nof the General Assembly today.\r\nDevelopments during the past year proved to be\r\nextremely challenging for the Agency. They also tested\r\nto the limit the ability of the organization to\r\nsuccessfully execute the mandate enshrined in its\r\nStatute. It is gratifying to note that, in handling those\r\ncomplex and sensitive situations, the Agency was\r\nguided by the principle that it is indeed only through\r\ninternational cooperation and mutual accommodation\r\nthat progress can be made in dealing with issues\r\npertaining to the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security and nuclear non-proliferation.\r\nGhana is highly appreciative of the support that it\r\nhas received from the Agency throughout the past year\r\nthrough the Technical Cooperation Programme. Ghana\r\nhas continued to strengthen its institutional and human\r\nresource capabilities in the application of nuclear\r\ntechnologies to problems of health, agriculture,\r\nindustry and the environment through relevant national\r\nand regional projects.\r\nDuring 2003, the Ghana Atomic Energy\r\nCommission continued to make more efficient use of\r\nthe Agency’s programmes for nuclear science and\r\ntechnology research, as well as of their applications to\r\nthe socio-economic development of Ghana. Notable\r\namong the research activities carried out was the\r\napplication of neutron activation analysis. Our research\r\nreactor was used for the characterization of major\r\naquifers in the eastern region of Ghana and for geo-\r\nchemical studies of granite bodies in southern Ghana.\r\nResearchers also undertook tasks involving\r\nradioisotope scanning of distillation columns for the\r\nnation’s oil refinery, and used non-destructive testing\r\ntechniques to inspect welds in the chemical and mining\r\nindustries.\r\nNuclear and biotechnological techniques are\r\nbeing used alongside conventional farming practices to\r\nsupport national agricultural projects aimed at\r\nincreasing food production through the tissue-culture\r\ntechnique and at increasing biodiversity through the\r\nintroduction of viable economic varieties obtained\r\nfrom mutation breeding.\r\nFor about a decade now, Ghana has been utilizing\r\nradiation processing to preserve food and sterilize\r\nmedical products. Over the years, appropriate\r\nmanpower has been developed to operate and utilize\r\nthe cobalt-60 gamma irradiator. We are now seeking\r\nventure capital or partnerships with the private sector\r\nto replace our old irradiator. We expect that such an\r\narrangement will inject the necessary financial\r\nresources to bring about the full commercialization of\r\nthat technology.\r\nIn the peaceful applications of nuclear techniques\r\nfor Ghana’s sustainable development, we shall\r\ncontinue to make efforts to ensure that radioactive\r\nsources are safe and secure. Stringent measures are\r\nbeing put in place at the national level to enhance the\r\nphysical protection of all facilities that house sources\r\nof ionizing radiation and nuclear materials against\r\nsabotage, theft and illicit trafficking. At the same time\r\nand in line with emergency responses to potential\r\nnuclear or radiological situations, the Radiation\r\nProtection Board and the National Disaster\r\nManagement Organization have produced a national\r\nemergency response plan. The roles and\r\nresponsibilities of various stakeholder institutions\r\nwithin the country have been identified and prepared\r\nfor emergency drills and exercises, which are to be\r\nconducted in the near future. Ghana shares the\r\nconcerns of the international community about the\r\nneed for nuclear safety and security, and recognizes the\r\n29\r\nA/59/PV.47\r\nimportance of the actions taken thus far to address the\r\nissue.\r\nAs is the case in many countries in Africa and in\r\nother tropical areas, malaria is a major source of\r\nconcern for our people, representing a significant\r\npercentage of mortality in Ghana. My delegation\r\nwelcomes the Agency’s efforts and research activities\r\naimed at combating malaria through the application of\r\nthe sterile insect technique. We look forward to early\r\nprogress in that valuable project.\r\nMy Government would like to place on record its\r\ngratitude to IAEA for establishing a second\r\nradiotherapy centre in our country. The Agency\r\nprovided all the equipment, training and expert\r\nservices. The two radiotherapy facilities are currently\r\nbeing used for the treatment of cancer patients from\r\nGhana and neighbouring countries in the West Africa\r\nsubregion.\r\nNuclear security is a precondition for nuclear\r\ncooperation and trade. However, it is no secret that\r\nthere are many countries that lack the necessary\r\nexpertise to develop and implement a State system of\r\nnuclear security. Verification challenges are constantly\r\nevolving, and the fact that potential proliferators\r\nconstantly seek access to new technologies requires\r\nthat the Agency continuously update its knowledge and\r\ndetection capabilities. In that regard, my delegation\r\nappeals to both IAEA and to member States that\r\npossess the requisite capabilities to assist developing\r\ncountries, in particular to close the security gap. At the\r\nsame time, it is imperative that solutions be found for\r\nthe management and disposal of spent nuclear fuel and\r\nradioactive waste.\r\nThe regime established by the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) has been, and\r\ncontinues to be, a key element in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. The NPT is the\r\ncornerstone of the international community’s efforts to\r\nsecure complete nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-\r\nproliferation. It is Ghana’s opinion that all nations must\r\ncooperate fully to enhance the effectiveness and\r\nsustainability of the Treaty. Ghana, for its part, attaches\r\ngreat importance to the reduction of military\r\nexpenditures, in accordance with the principles of\r\nundiminished security. We therefore urge all States to\r\ntransfer any peace dividends resulting from reductions\r\nin military spending to economic and social\r\ndevelopment activities.\r\nI would like to conclude by once again\r\nacknowledging that IAEA has been one of Ghana’s\r\nmost reliable development partners since our country\r\njoined the Agency, in 1960. Our second country\r\nprogramme framework, which constitutes the\r\nframework for medium-term technical cooperation\r\nbetween IAEA and Ghana, was signed a few months\r\nago. That document outlines mutually agreed strategies\r\nfor matching nuclear technology to national\r\ndevelopment priorities. Ghana’s cooperation with\r\nIAEA will focus on critical aspects of human health,\r\nwater resources development, crop production,\r\nlivestock development and the development of human\r\nresources for the application and development of\r\nnuclear technology and biotechnology in Ghana. I wish\r\nto take this opportunity to reaffirm the Government of\r\nGhana’s unwavering support for the Agency as it\r\nstrives to realize its statutory objectives of promoting\r\nthe safe and peaceful applications of nuclear\r\ntechnology for socio-economic development\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I would like to\r\ninform members that, at the request of the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya and as reflected in the Journal, the\r\nconsideration of agenda item 48, “Elimination of\r\nunilateral extraterritorial coercive economic measures\r\nas a means of political and economic compulsion”,\r\noriginally scheduled for today, Monday, 1 November\r\n2004, has been postponed to a later date.\r\nBefore adjourning the meeting, I would like to\r\ninform members that, at 2.30 p.m. today, we will\r\ncontinue our debate on agenda item 14, in order that\r\nthe General Assembly may take a decision on the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/59/L.18.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.35 p.m.\r\n"
