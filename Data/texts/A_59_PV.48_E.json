(Gabon)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Sevilla\r\nSomoza (Nicaragua), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 2.45 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 14 (continued)\r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nreport of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (A/59/295)\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.18)\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly\r\nwill continue its consideration of agenda item 14,\r\nentitled “Report of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency”. Members will recall that the General\r\nAssembly concluded debate on this item this morning.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution\r\nA/59/L.18. Before giving the floor to the speakers in\r\nexplanation of vote before the vote, may I remind\r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to\r\n10 minutes and should be made by delegations from\r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Kim (Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea): I am going to make a statement on behalf of\r\nmy delegation on our position on the draft resolution\r\nentitled “Report of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency”.\r\nFirst, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nis not a member of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency and is not a State party to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea broke away\r\nfrom IAEA in the early 1990s because the Agency had\r\nabandoned the principle of equity, reducing itself to a\r\npolitical tool of the super-Powers; and last year the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea withdrew from\r\nthe NPT in order to defend the supreme interests of the\r\nnation. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nhas no relations with either IAEA or NPT, and it is\r\nirrelevant for IAEA to report on the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea in its annual report.\r\nSecond, the draft resolution entitled “Report of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency” is aimed at\r\nmisleading the public regarding the nuclear issue of the\r\nKorean Peninsula in order to exert pressure on the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. The IAEA is\r\ncrying that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nis continuing its non-compliance with the safeguards\r\nagreement. Japan is claiming that the nuclear\r\nprogramme of the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea is a threat to peace and security in Northeast\r\nAsia, while the United States nuclear weapons\r\ndeployed on the Japanese islands and targeted at the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea serve peace\r\nand security. In addition, certain other countries are\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.48\r\nsaying that the withdrawal of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea from the NPT and its nuclear\r\nprogramme are challenges to the non-proliferation\r\nregime.\r\nHowever, all those arguments are based on the\r\nreversed logic of putting the cart before the horse,\r\nintentionally turning away from the intrinsic nature of the\r\nnuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula. The nuclear issue\r\nof the Korean Peninsula is the direct outcome of the\r\nhostile United States policy towards the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. It is a political and military\r\nquestion to be settled between the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea and the United States of America. If\r\nthe United States had not brought nuclear weapons onto\r\nthe Korean Peninsula, and if the United States had not\r\nthreatened a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, the nuclear issue\r\nand the withdrawal of the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea from NPT would not have cropped up.\r\nFrom the Agency’s approach to the recently\r\nexposed secret nuclear experiment of South Korea, we\r\nhave become even more aware of the injustice and\r\ndouble standards of the IAEA and of certain other\r\ncountries that feign concern over the nuclear issue of\r\nthe Korean Peninsula. How can we count on them\r\nregarding questions of the supreme interests of the\r\nState? My delegation thinks that if IAEA and certain\r\nmember countries really care about resolving the\r\nnuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula, they should\r\nshake off their prejudice, look at the question squarely,\r\nand urge the United States to give up its hostile policy\r\ntowards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nAs for the uranium enrichment programme, which\r\nis mentioned in the report, it is a fabrication of the United\r\nStates created in order to lay the blame for the nuclear\r\nissue of the Korean Peninsula at the feet of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. The allegation\r\nthat a secret uranium enrichment programme exists, like\r\nthe pre-emptive strike strategy, is characteristic of the\r\nUnited States in its self-righteousness, unilateralism and\r\nbellicosity. Figuratively speaking, the former is based on\r\nthe logic that if you repeat lies, they will become truth,\r\nwhile the latter is based on the assumption that if the\r\npedestrian across the street looks like he is going to strike\r\nyou, you strike him. The Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea is maintaining a high level of vigilance against that\r\nkind of mentality and manoeuvring of the United States.\r\nThe United States aggression towards Iraq\r\nteaches us a grave lesson. The United Nations\r\ninspection team, lead by the IAEA, searched the whole\r\nterritory of Iraq for nearly 10 years, including the\r\npresidential palaces, but did not give any confirmation\r\nthat Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction. The\r\nUnited States, clinging to that, invented the threat of\r\nIraqi weapons of mass destruction and thus justified its\r\nwar of aggression against Iraq.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has\r\nalready made it clear that, if the United States\r\nrenounces, in a practical manner, its hostile policy\r\ntowards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,\r\nincluding the nuclear threat, it is willing to scrap its\r\nnuclear deterrence accordingly. It is the consistent\r\nposition of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nto hold fast to the ultimate goal of the denuclearization\r\nof the Korean Peninsula and to settle the nuclear issue\r\npeacefully through talks and negotiations.\r\nThe delegation of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea, based on this point of view, will\r\nvote against the draft resolution, because it is not\r\nintended to contribute to resolving the nuclear issue on\r\nthe Korean Peninsula.\r\nThe Acting President: As you know, we have\r\nalready heard the only speaker in explanation of vote\r\nbefore the vote. The Assembly will now take a decision\r\non draft resolution A/59/L.18. Before proceeding to\r\ntake action on the draft resolution, I would like to\r\nannounce that, since the introduction of the draft\r\nresolution, the following countries have also become\r\nsponsors of A/59/L.18: the Philippines and Nicaragua.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested. We shall\r\nnow begin the voting process.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAlgeria, Andorra, Angola, Argentina, Armenia,\r\nAustria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh,\r\nBelarus, Benin, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nBrazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burkina\r\nFaso, Cameroon, Canada, Central African\r\nRepublic, Chile, China, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nCroatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic,\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark,\r\nDjibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El\r\nSalvador, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Germany,\r\nGhana, Greece, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras,\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.48\r\nHungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic\r\nRepublic of), Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica,\r\nJapan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Lao\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, Latvia, Lebanon,\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, Liechtenstein,\r\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Maldives,\r\nMalta, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Monaco,\r\nMongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar,\r\nNepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua,\r\nNigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama,\r\nParaguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal,\r\nQatar, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian\r\nFederation, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal,\r\nSerbia and Montenegro, Seychelles, Singapore,\r\nSlovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri\r\nLanka, Sudan, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland,\r\nSyrian Arab Republic, Thailand, Timor-Leste,\r\nTogo, Tonga, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United\r\nArab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\nand Northern Ireland, United Republic of\r\nTanzania, United States of America, Vanuatu,\r\nVenezuela, Yemen, Zambia\r\nAgainst:\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nDraft resolution A/59/L.18 was adopted by 123\r\nvotes to 1 (resolution 59/18).\r\n[Subsequently, the delegations of Cape Verde,\r\nEritrea, Georgia, Mauritius, Tajikistan and Viet\r\nNam informed the Secretariat that they had\r\nintended to vote in favour.]\r\nThe Acting President: Several representatives\r\nhave requested to exercise the right of reply. May I\r\nremind members that, in accordance with General\r\nAssembly decision 34/401, statements in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and five for the second and should be\r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Kitaoka (Japan): Japan would like to exercise\r\nthe right of reply to the statement in explanation of vote\r\nmade by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. In\r\nhis explanation, the representative of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea said that the United States\r\nnuclear weapons were targeted at the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea. That is totally untrue. As the only\r\nnation that has suffered the scourge of the atomic bomb,\r\nJapan is fully committed to the renunciation of the option\r\nof possessing nuclear weapons under relevant\r\ninternational treaties, including, inter alia, the non-\r\nproliferation treaty (NPT), and has consistently\r\nmaintained its three non-nuclear principles of not\r\npossessing nuclear weapons, not manufacturing them and\r\nnot allowing them to enter Japan.\r\nMr. Chun (Republic of Korea): I would also like\r\nto exercise the right of reply to the statement of the\r\nrepresentative of North Korea. My delegation rejects\r\nthe North Korean representative’s characterization of\r\nthe nuclear experiments conducted by some scientists\r\nin my country. As we have made clear on a number of\r\noccasions, including during the general debate of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in our Foreign Minister’s statement,\r\nthose experiments were isolated laboratory-scale\r\nresearch activities that a few scientists conducted on\r\ntheir own for purely scientific purposes. They have\r\nnothing whatsoever to do with a weapons programme.\r\nFurthermore, even though the Republic of Korea\r\nmaintains the sixth largest civil nuclear industry in the\r\nworld and depends on nuclear energy for 40 per cent of\r\nits supply of electricity, we do not have any enrichment\r\nor reprocessing facilities. We do not have any\r\nclandestine nuclear programmes as the North Korean\r\ndelegate has alleged.\r\nDespite the compelling economic imperative to\r\nreduce our dependence on imported nuclear fuel, we\r\nmaintain the policy of voluntarily abstaining from the\r\npossession of enrichment or reprocessing facilities\r\nsolely in the interests of the denuclearization of the\r\nKorean Peninsula. Scientific research for the peaceful\r\nuses of nuclear energy is a fundamental right that all\r\nparties to the NPT are guaranteed under article IV of\r\nthe treaty.\r\nAlthough the experiments previously referred to\r\nshould have been conducted with the proper authorization\r\nof my Government and been reported to the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in a timely manner, the\r\namount of nuclear material involved is too trivial to have\r\nany relevance to proliferation. Moreover, the disclosure of\r\nthose research activities resulted from my Government’s\r\npolitical determination to accept the new safeguards\r\nstandards set forth in the additional protocol to the IAEA\r\nsafeguards agreement, under which we declare all our\r\npast nuclear activities down to the level of scientific\r\nexperiments involving milligram units, and we thus have\r\nrectified any inadvertent reporting lapses. Therefore, there\r\nshould be no doubt left whatsoever regarding my\r\nGovernment’s firm commitment to nuclear non-\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.48\r\nproliferation norms, and we are providing full cooperation\r\nwith the IAEA to rectify any past reporting lapses.\r\nFinally, if North Korea does exactly as we have\r\ndone, and accepts the highest standards of nuclear\r\ntransparency, much of the international concern about\r\nNorth Korea’s nuclear programme will be resolved.\r\nMr. Kim (Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea): First, I am going to reply to the Japanese\r\nrepresentative. The Japanese representative, and Japan\r\ngenerally speaking, tries very hard to cover up its\r\nulterior motives with its three principles or by referring\r\nto Japan’s sacrifices from that nuclear bomb attack.\r\nActually, Japan, while approving the three principles,\r\nallows nuclear weapons of the United States to come\r\nand go through Japanese ports. Also, on the Japanese\r\nislands there are many United States military bases that\r\nare targeted against the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea. The Japanese representative cannot cover up\r\nall that reality.\r\nSecond, as for the South Koreans, I told the truth.\r\nThe South Koreans have done this secret experiment\r\nand we know that they have tried to develop nuclear\r\nweapons since the 1970s. And this experiment, which\r\nwas recently disclosed, was done in the 1980s. How\r\ncan we trust their commitment to the international\r\ncommunity?\r\nMr. Chun (Republic of Korea): I do not want to\r\nenter into a prolonged debate on nuclear issues or the\r\nallegations raised by the North Korean delegate in this\r\nforum. However, my delegation wishes to make the\r\npoint that we find it absurd that the most egregious and\r\ndetermined proliferator known to the world is abusing\r\nthis session to present a grossly distorted and\r\nexaggerated allegation about my country’s nuclear\r\nresearch activities, which have, as I said earlier, no\r\nrelevance to proliferation at all. What North Korea has\r\nto do first is dismantle its nuclear weapons programme\r\nentirely and accept the highest safeguard standards set\r\nforth by the additional protocol before it can consider\r\nitself qualified to criticize other countries’ peaceful\r\nnuclear research activities.\r\nMr. Kim (Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea): Our nuclear programme is already well known\r\nto the world. So, we are now trying to solve this with\r\nthe United States. This has come up because of the\r\nUnited States hostile policy of nuclear threat. As for\r\nthe South Korean nuclear programme, it had not been\r\nknown until recently. I think it is very dangerous since\r\nthey are boasting of having the sixth largest developed\r\nnuclear facilities. To this day it is not known how\r\ndangerous it is. Ours is known. South Korea’s is\r\nunknown.\r\nMr. Kitaoka (Japan): Japan will not repeat our\r\npoint because our message is very clear and is\r\nunderstood by 99 per cent of the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 14?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 26\r\nThe situation in Central America: progress in\r\nfashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy\r\nand development\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/59/307)\r\nMr. Hamburger (Netherlands): I have the honour\r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union. The candidate\r\ncountries Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia, the countries of\r\nthe Stabilization and Association Process and potential\r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, The former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and\r\nMontenegro and the European Free Trade Association\r\ncountries Iceland and Liechtenstein, members of the\r\nEuropean Economic Area, align themselves with this\r\nstatement.\r\nWe are discussing today the ninth and final report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the implementation of the\r\nGuatemalan peace agreements. In addition to summarizing\r\npolitical developments during the past year, the report seeks\r\nto assess the overall progress in consolidating the peace.\r\nThe evaluation comes at a critical juncture for Guatemala.\r\nThe United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala\r\n(MINUGUA) will close after 10 years, during which its\r\npresence has been essential to the implementation of the\r\naccords. The departure of MINUGUA will thus mark the\r\nbeginning of a new and necessary phase of the peace\r\nprocess. It will now be completely up to national actors to\r\nassume responsibility for the unequivocal implementation\r\nof the peace accords and to ensure adequate funding.\r\nOver the past two years, MINUGUA has already\r\nphased down its operations and carried out a transition\r\nstrategy designed to build national capacity. The efforts\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.48\r\nwere not only directed at key State institutions, such as\r\nthe Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman, but also\r\nat civil society organizations likely to remain engaged\r\nin peacebuilding efforts in the future.\r\nThe strategy also sought to guarantee adequate\r\nfollow-up for priorities relating to the peace accords by\r\nthe United Nations system in Guatemala. In that light,\r\nthe European Union would be in favour of a further\r\nUnited Nations presence to strengthen the Government\r\nin its efforts to improve the human rights situation. In\r\nthis respect, the establishment of an office of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights would make an\r\nimportant contribution. Impunity and threats to human\r\nrights activists by clandestine and illegal groups also\r\nneed special attention.\r\nAs is stipulated in the report, MINUGUA used\r\nthe final period to reinforce the peace agenda with the\r\nnew authorities, which took office in January 2004.\r\nThe Mission produced a comprehensive set of policy\r\nrecommendations and reviewed them with senior\r\nGovernment officials, governors, mayors, legislators,\r\njustice officials and leaders of civil society. During his\r\nvisit to Guatemala in May 2004, the Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Political Affairs, Sir Kieran Prendergast,\r\nunderscored to those actors that the peace accords\r\nshould remain Guatemala’s basic blueprint for\r\ndevelopment. The European Union would like to add\r\nits voice to that message.\r\nMeanwhile, continued support by the donor\r\ncommunity is important. The contributions made over\r\nthe years by the Group of Friends to the Peace Process\r\nand by the members of the Dialogue Group have been\r\ninvaluable. While expressing gratitude for those\r\ncontributions and for the support for MINUGUA over\r\nthe years, the European Union hopes that we will all\r\nremain engaged with peace accords-related projects\r\nand remain in a close political dialogue with the\r\nGuatemalan Government.\r\nMs. García Guerra (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nFirst and foremost, my delegation would like to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for the very comprehensive and\r\ndetailed report on the implementation of the peace\r\nagreements in Guatemala and the work of the United\r\nNations Verification Mission in Guatemala\r\n(MINUGUA).\r\nMy delegation looks forward with the same\r\ninterest to the additional report that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral will be presenting in the months ahead,\r\npursuant to the request made by the General Assembly\r\nin resolution 58/238. That report will mark the closing\r\nof the Mission after 10 years in operation. It will surely\r\nalso serve as a report on lessons learned.\r\nAs a neighbour and a friend of Guatemala, a\r\ncountry that has participated in a variety of good\r\noffices and reconciliation efforts in the Central\r\nAmerican region and a member of the Group of\r\nFriends to the Peace Process in Guatemala, Mexico has\r\nbeen closely following the work that MINUGUA has\r\nbeen doing over its 10 years of existence. As long as\r\nthe people, the Government and the political forces of\r\nthat country felt that the Mission’s presence was useful\r\nand necessary, Mexico supported the renewal of the\r\nMission’s mandate.\r\nAs the Secretary-General’s report well points out,\r\n“Through its verification, good offices,\r\ntechnical cooperation and public information,\r\nMINUGUA has made countless contributions,\r\nhelping over the years to remind Guatemalans of the\r\ncommitments they have made and to keep the\r\ncountry on the path of peace.” (A/59/307, para. 69)\r\nHowever, MINUGUA had to come to an end and\r\nyield to a phase in which national stakeholders would\r\nbecome the main actors responsible for overseeing and\r\nensuring compliance with the peace accords. In this\r\nnew phase, Guatemala will continue to enjoy the\r\nsupport of the United Nations and our support as a\r\nmember of the international community.\r\nDuring this transition period, the symbolic\r\nrelaunching of the peace accords, which President\r\nOscar Berger undertook when he took office less than a\r\nyear ago, is of great significance. With the help of\r\nMINUGUA, over the last 10 years the Government and\r\nthe society of Guatemala have made many major\r\nadvances. Among other things, an end was put to more\r\nthan three decades of armed conflict and human rights\r\nviolations perpetrated or supported by the State. The\r\nreintegration of ex-combatants into civilian life was\r\ncompleted. The military was dramatically reduced in\r\nsize, as was the military budget. The Presidential\r\nGeneral Staff was dismantled. In general, civilian\r\ncontrol over the armed forces has been strengthened.\r\nNotable progress has been made in promoting and\r\nprotecting human rights. Important legislative reforms\r\nin the area of elections and political parties have been\r\nadopted, in addition to laws for decentralization and\r\nlaws against discrimination. Today, Guatemala has a\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.48\r\ndemocratic system and a mature civil society that is\r\never vigilant about compliance with the peace\r\nagreements.\r\nHowever, in his report, the Secretary-General\r\nalso underscores that some of the commitments of the\r\nGovernment and Guatemalan society as a whole are\r\nstill outstanding. We believe that those commitments\r\nmust be fulfilled for the country to achieve sustainable\r\npeace based on a democratic and fair society. Those\r\ncommitments include compensation for victims of\r\nhuman rights violations perpetrated by the State during\r\nthe armed conflict, strengthening of the rule of law,\r\ngreater progress in the recognition and respect of the\r\nrights of indigenous peoples and their participation in\r\nsociety and greater progress on tax reform, which has\r\nbecome a matter of urgency.\r\nSome of those challenges are similar to those\r\nfaced by other countries in Central America, including\r\nmy own. For that reason and because of the\r\ngeographical, historical and cultural ties that Mexico\r\nshares with Guatemala, there is enormous potential for\r\ncooperation between the Governments of our two\r\ncountries in the post-MINUGUA phase that is about to\r\nbegin, aside from the cooperation that already exists at\r\nthe regional level.\r\nFor example, one priority of the Government of\r\nPresident Berger is to work for Guatemala’s full\r\nadherence to all instruments of international human\r\nrights law and, more specifically, to promote the\r\nestablishment in Guatemala of a local office of the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights. That issue is being debated in the\r\nCongress. We are also aware that the United Nations\r\nwould consider such an office to be a fundamental\r\ninstrument for continuing the job of verification on\r\nhuman rights — which to date has been done by\r\nMINUGUA — and for supporting national human\r\nrights institutions. Mexico has an office of the Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees in its own territory, and we are most willing\r\nto share with the Government of Guatemala our\r\nexperience with that office.\r\nMy delegation intends to submit to the Assembly\r\na draft resolution on the occasion of the conclusion of\r\nMINUGUA’s mandate and the beginning of a new\r\nphase in the peace process. We trust that this initiative\r\nwill gain the support of the Group of Friends and other\r\nMember States, which, for years now, have supported\r\nthis process.\r\nFinally, I thank Mr. Tom Koenigs, Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Guatemala\r\nfor the job he has done in the final phase of the\r\ntransition and the conclusion of the Mission. I also pay\r\ntribute to the entire staff of the Mission and the young\r\npeople of Guatemala who were involved in the\r\nNational Transition Volunteers Programme for their\r\ncommitment to the peace process in Guatemala.\r\nMr. Skinner-Klée (Guatemala) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): At the outset, we thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his ninth and final report on the United\r\nNations Verification Mission in Guatemala, contained\r\nin document A/59/307. We reaffirm our gratitude to the\r\nGroup of Friends of the Guatemalan peace process,\r\nwhich has supported us throughout the long process,\r\nmonitoring the situation in Central America in general\r\nand that in Guatemala in particular. We especially\r\nthank the Government of Mexico, which, year after\r\nyear, has facilitated the preparation of the draft\r\nresolution on this topic.\r\nFor many years now, at this time of the year, we\r\nhave taken up the agenda item on the situation in\r\nCentral America, including, of course, the situation in\r\nGuatemala. As is well known, the United Nations\r\nVerification Mission has operated in our country since\r\n1994. Its original purpose was to verify\r\nimplementation of a human rights agreement, but its\r\nmandate was expanded in December 1996 to assist the\r\nparties that signed the peace agreements by carrying\r\nout tasks of verification, facilitation, public\r\ninformation and good offices.\r\nThose peace accords continue to be a work in\r\nprogress, bringing great advances and seeing some\r\nsetbacks. We believe that this is not the moment to\r\napportion responsibility for the overall situation we\r\nface. Certainly, we agree with the report’s view that in\r\nGuatemala the foundations for a promising future have\r\nbeen laid and that a democratic framework has been\r\nconsolidated.\r\nThat was attested to by the general elections that\r\ntook place in November and December of last year and\r\ngave clear proof of being an open, transparent and\r\nlegitimate process. That is a considerable improvement\r\nin the political situation of Guatemala. Those elections\r\nenabled a peaceful and orderly transition to the\r\ncoalition Government headed by President Oscar\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.48\r\nBerger Perdomo, which is fully committed to\r\nimplementing the peace agreements. The peace\r\nagreements are a substantial part of the agenda of our\r\nGovernment, along with solving the problem of the\r\ndeeply felt needs of the population, which include the\r\nstrengthening and the institutionalization of civil\r\nsociety. For that reason, in September 2004, President\r\nBerger stated,\r\n“My plan of government incorporates the\r\npeace agreements and defines their implementation\r\nas the commitment of the whole nation. As\r\nPresident of Guatemala, I endorse the principle that\r\nsolid and lasting peace must be founded on\r\nparticipatory, social and economic development\r\naimed at achieving the common good and\r\nresponding to the needs of all our people,\r\nparticularly those still living in situations of extreme\r\npoverty.”\r\nIt is in this context that today we wish to thank all the\r\nMember States that made possible the extension of\r\nMINUGUA to 31 December of this year. As we said\r\nlast year, this has allowed us to capitalize on the\r\nconsiderable investment in effort and resources made\r\nby the United Nations in supporting all Guatemalans in\r\nconsolidating the peace process, democracy and\r\nsustainable development.\r\nIn Guatemala, despite the weakness of certain\r\nState institutions, we have made substantial progress in\r\npromoting the observance of human rights and building\r\na more inclusive and tolerant society. Still, we are\r\naware that, as the Secretary-General pointed out in his\r\nreport, there are still daunting challenges ahead, which\r\nis why the Government of President Berger is\r\ncommitted to strengthening the national institutions\r\nthat are preparing fully to take over the functions the\r\nMission carried out and are reinforcing the national\r\ncivil police and the national prison system.\r\nIt is in this spirit that we support an upgrading of\r\nthe in-country office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, as well as the link\r\nestablished with the United Nations for the purpose of\r\ncombating organized crime by means of a commission\r\nto investigate illegal groups and clandestine security\r\norganizations in Guatemala. We are certain that the\r\ninternational community, particularly the countries that\r\nare members of the Group of Friends, will go on\r\nlending us their support for the work aimed at\r\nstrengthening the institutions that promote the rule of\r\nlaw.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish to express our\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, his\r\nteam and the entire staff that was part of the United\r\nNations Verification Mission in Guatemala, which after\r\n10 years of fruitful work, is seeing the end of its\r\nmandate, leaving behind a significant legacy in our\r\ncountry — a shining example of the kind of success\r\nthat can be achieved through international cooperation\r\nin the interests of peace.\r\nMr. Dajer (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): First, I\r\nshould like to thank the Secretary-General for having\r\nsubmitted his report in document A/59/307 of\r\n30 August 2004 on the United Nations Verification\r\nMission in Guatemala (MINUGUA).\r\nThis December, after 10 years of operation,\r\nMINUGUA is programmed to be closed down. This\r\nmarks the end of the verification phase in the work of\r\nthe United Nations and the beginning of a new phase in\r\nthe process, whereby all Guatemalans will be doing the\r\nwork themselves. We are certain that Guatemala is\r\nready to meet that challenge. I should like to stress that\r\nthere is still a lot to be done and problems still to be\r\ndealt with. But, the situation today is far different from\r\nwhat it was in previous years.\r\nA little while ago, Guatemala had democratic\r\nelections and it mastered the challenges of the past in a\r\nmature manner. During the months that followed the\r\nchange of Government, as the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport shows, Guatemala showed that it could continue\r\nthe work that MINUGUA had begun. We agree with\r\nthe Secretary-General that the support of the\r\ncommunity of donors, which is crucial for the\r\nimmediate future, must continue. Colombia, as a friend\r\nof the peace process in Guatemala, welcomes the\r\nushering in of a new phase in the reconciliation and\r\npeace process and in the consolidation of Guatemala’s\r\ndemocratic institutions. We fully trust in the capability\r\nof national, regional and local authorities to continue\r\nthe process begun by MINUGUA. We stress the need\r\nfor continued international community support to be\r\nforthcoming in order to ensure the success of that\r\nprocess. This firm commitment to Guatemala is\r\nparticularly important in fighting the crime and\r\ninsecurity that Guatemala’s democracy and economy\r\nmust deal with.\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.48\r\nMr. Rock (Canada): I welcome this opportunity\r\nto take part this afternoon in this discussion as we mark\r\nthe end of the mandate of the United Nations\r\nVerification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA). The\r\nMission has been an excellent example of the\r\nimportant contribution that international peacekeeping\r\nmissions can make in the consolidation of peace in a\r\ncountry that has been affected by conflict. The Mission\r\nplayed an important role in the strengthening of human\r\nrights in Guatemala and Canada is proud to have\r\nsupported MINUGUA over the course of its\r\nmandate — both in terms of finances and through the\r\nparticipation of Canadian police and military\r\npersonnel. Canada views MINUGUA’s departure as a\r\npositive signal of the progress made in Guatemala\r\nsince the signing of the 1996 peace accords.\r\nThere is no question that Guatemala today is a\r\nvery different country. We believe that significant\r\nprogress has been made in strengthening democracy\r\nand in addressing social inequities. Canada is\r\nparticularly pleased with the strong direction given by\r\nthe Berger Administration for renewed commitment\r\nwith regard to the implementation of the peace accords,\r\nas well as the steps taken to acknowledge past wrongs\r\nand to promote reconciliation. We must, however, also\r\nrecognize that significant challenges remain to be\r\novercome in the effort to ensure full respect for human\r\nrights and equity and to improve security and access to\r\njustice for all Guatemalans.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIn this context, Canada welcomes the\r\nGovernment’s continued commitment to the\r\nestablishment of a commission to investigate illegal\r\narmed groups. The creation of that commission is\r\nimportant and necessary not only for the safety and\r\nsecurity of Guatemalan citizens, but also for the\r\nsuccess of democratic institutions in the country. All\r\nGuatemalans should work together not just to establish\r\nthis commission, but also to give it a strong mandate\r\nand operational capacity, which the country needs in\r\norder to create a corruption-free culture that can\r\nsupport democratic development.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nCanada also encourages the Guatemalan\r\nGovernment to work with the United Nations on the\r\nearly establishment of an office of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights in Guatemala. Such\r\nan office would constitute an important step in\r\nconsolidating the significant advances in human rights\r\nthat have already been made.\r\nIn closing, let me use this occasion to reaffirm\r\nCanada’s sincere commitment to working in\r\npartnership with our friends and our neighbours in the\r\nAmericas in pursuit of a better future for all the nations\r\nof the hemisphere.\r\nMr. Løvald (Norway): Even though many years\r\nhave past since the armed conflicts in Central America\r\nended, the region is still facing a number of major\r\nchallenges: the eradication of poverty, the\r\nconsolidation of democracy and the safeguarding of\r\nhuman rights. Good governance, sustainable economic\r\ndevelopment and strengthening of the judicial systems\r\ncontinue to be key issues.\r\nHowever, it is encouraging to see that the\r\nGovernments of Central America are continuing, and\r\neven stepping up, their fight against corruption.\r\nPeaceful and transparent elections are now the rule\r\nrather than the exception in Central America and bear\r\nwitness to the gradual consolidation of democracy in\r\nthose countries. We commend the United Nations\r\nagencies and the Organization of American States\r\n(OAS) on their long-standing support for the election\r\nprocesses, to which Norway has also contributed,\r\nparticularly in Guatemala, through the OAS. With the\r\nwithdrawal of MINUGUA in December, the United\r\nNations is closing the book on one of its most\r\nsuccessful peacebuilding missions after 10 years in the\r\nfield. We would like to commend both the Mission and\r\nthe United Nations on that outstanding contribution to\r\npeace and development in Guatemala.\r\nWe are confident that the country is now in a\r\ngood position to consolidate the peace process by\r\nimplementing the peace accords. We would like to\r\ncommend the President of Guatemala on his strong\r\ncommitment to the peace accords and for the progress\r\nwhich his Government has made in such important\r\nareas as completing the reduction of the armed forces.\r\nWe have no doubt that the peace accords will continue\r\nto serve as a road map and a national agenda for further\r\ndevelopment. However, new commitments and\r\nobjectives are now on the national agenda, such as the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. We hope that the\r\nconsultative group meeting, scheduled for the first half\r\nof next year, will look into those matters.\r\nAlthough the final withdrawal of MINUGUA is a\r\npositive sign, there is a great need for the international\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.48\r\ncommunity to continue supporting the implementation\r\nof the peace accords. Guatemala is still a developing\r\ncountry in a post-conflict situation. It is important that\r\nthere be adequate mechanisms in place for following\r\nthis up after December of this year, particularly in the\r\nrealm of justice and human rights. We fully agree with\r\nthe Secretary-General’s assessment that, in addition to\r\nthe strengthening of the Office of the Human Rights\r\nOmbudsman, the establishment of an office of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights is particularly\r\nimportant in connection with the departure of\r\nMINUGUA. Norway will continue its support for the\r\nstrengthening of the justice sector, the national civilian\r\npolice and the Office of the Human Rights\r\nOmbudsman.\r\nThe Acting President: We have thus heard the\r\nlast speaker in the debate on this item. The General\r\nAssembly has concluded this stage of its consideration\r\nof item 26.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.40 p.m.\r\n"
