(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.40 a.m.\r\nTribute to the memory of His Excellency Sheikh\r\nZayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, President of the United\r\nArab Emirates\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Before\r\nbeginning the discussion of the agenda item before us,\r\nit our sad duty to pay tribute to the memory of the late\r\nPresident of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Zayed\r\nbin Sultan Al-Nahyan, who passed away Tuesday,\r\n2 November 2004.\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I request the\r\nrepresentative of the United Arab Emirates to convey\r\nour condolences to the Government and the people of\r\nthe United Arab Emirates and to the bereaved family of\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan. I\r\ninvite representatives to stand and observe a minute of\r\nsilence in tribute to the memory of Sheikh Zayed bin\r\nSultan Al-Nahyan.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly observed a\r\nminute of silent prayer and meditation.\r\nMr. Grey-Johnson (Gambia): I am speaking on\r\nbehalf of the Group of African States. It is with a deep\r\nsense of sorrow and loss that we have learned of the\r\npassing away of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan,\r\nPresident of the United Arab Emirates, at the age of 86\r\nyears.\r\nSheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan goes down\r\nin history as the man who, in a short period of less than\r\n40 years, transformed an underdeveloped group of\r\nsmall islands in the Persian Gulf into a highly\r\ndeveloped modern nation. When he became the head of\r\nthe Emirate of Abu Dhabi in 1966, the State of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates was nothing but a collection of\r\nseven sheikhdoms. Very quickly, he crafted them all\r\ninto a strong federation and forged a unified nation,\r\nwhich he then led and served with dedication,\r\nsteadfastness and vision. He used his country’s oil\r\nwealth to enrich his people, to educate and enlighten\r\nthe populace and to transform the United Arab\r\nEmirates into a leading international financial and\r\nbusiness centre. His statesmanship also made it\r\npossible, even unavoidable, for the United Arab\r\nEmirates to assume prominent leadership positions, not\r\nonly in the Arab and Islamic worlds, but also\r\ninternationally and within the United Nations. He\r\nopened up his country to all peace-loving individuals\r\nregardless of nationality, as long as they had a\r\ncontribution to make to the development of his people.\r\nHe is known for his modesty and simplicity and the\r\nease with which he mixed freely with his subjects.\r\nPerhaps the international system can take a leaf\r\nfrom this great leader’s life of service to his people and\r\nto humanity at large when we consider issues of\r\ngovernance, international cooperation, human security\r\nand development and the empowerment of the poor and\r\nthe dispossessed. We extend our heartfelt condolences\r\nto the Government and the people of the United Arab\r\nEmirates, and may his soul rest in peace.\r\nMr. Jenie (Indonesia): I stand here in deep\r\nhumility today as the chairman of the Group of Asian\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.49\r\nStates for the month of November to pay tribute to the\r\nmemory of His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-\r\nNahyan, the President of the United Arab Emirates,\r\nwho departed this world two days ago.\r\nSheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan was nearly\r\n90 years old when he passed on, and he had dutifully\r\npresided over his nation for over 30 years. Despite his\r\nage, he remained an energetic man, tirelessly pursuing\r\nthe causes of Arab unity, tolerance and reconciliation.\r\nFor that, he was a respected figure in the international\r\ncommunity, particularly among Arab leaders.\r\nRegarding his governing methods in his country,\r\nSheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan once expressed\r\nthe following great insight:\r\n“I am not imposing unity on anyone. That is\r\ntyranny. All of us have our opinions, and these\r\nopinions can change. Sometimes we put all\r\nopinions together and then extract from them a\r\nsingle point of view. This is our democracy.”\r\nIt is this kind of wisdom that made him a\r\nremarkable leader and for which he will never be\r\nforgotten. It is also this kind of wisdom that guided\r\nhim in office. Through his wise and judicious use of\r\nthe nation’s generous oil resources, he transformed the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates into the beautiful and flourishing\r\ndesert country that it is today and enhanced the welfare\r\nof his people. It is through this achievement that\r\nSheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan won the eternal\r\nlove and admiration of his people for over three\r\ndecades, and for which he will always be remembered.\r\nOn behalf of the group of Asian States, I pay tribute to\r\nthis great and unforgettable Arab son and express\r\ncondolences to his family and to the Government and\r\npeople of the United Arab Emirates. May the soul of\r\nSheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan rest in peace.\r\nMr. Dapkiunas (Belarus): It is with deep sadness\r\nthat the Member State of the Eastern European Group\r\nof States learned about the passing of His Highness\r\nSheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, President of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates and ruler of Abu Dhabi.\r\nWe all pay tribute to His Highness Sheikh Zayed\r\nbin Sultan Al Nahyan’s tireless and wise leadership of\r\nthe United Arab Emirates since its formation in 1971.\r\nHis wisdom and energy lead the people of the United\r\nArab Emirates to prosperity and well-being. Having\r\ndedicated his life to the unification and strengthening\r\nof his country, His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan\r\nAl Nahyan has made it one of the wealthiest and the\r\nmost prosperous States in the region. Today, the United\r\nArab Emirates is a leading member of the Organization\r\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries and a regional centre\r\nfor banking and finance.\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al\r\nNahyan’s contribution to peace and security in the\r\nregion and the entire world cannot be overestimated.\r\nHis attitude toward his country’s neighbours, based on\r\ntrust and respect, has been a crucial factor in bringing\r\nthe countries of the region closer to each other. Today,\r\nthe League of Arab States is an influential international\r\norganization that plays an important role in\r\nstrengthening international security and stability. Its\r\nfriendly and fruitful relations with the United Nations\r\nmust, to a large extent, be attributed to the efforts of\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.\r\nAs a distinguished statesman, talented politician\r\nand diplomat, loving father, and a man of vision who\r\nlooked far into the future, His Highness Sheikh Zayed\r\nbin Sultan Al Nahyan rightfully enjoyed the profound\r\nrespect of the people of his country and the whole\r\nworld.\r\nThe member countries of the Group of Eastern\r\nEuropean States convey their deep condolences to the\r\nfamily of the late President and to the Government and\r\npeople of the United Arab Emirates.\r\nMr. Sevilla Somoza (Nicaragua) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I am honoured to take the floor on behalf of\r\nthe Group of Latin American and Caribbean States to\r\nconvey our most heartfelt condolences to the people\r\nand Government of the United Arab Emirates upon the\r\nmuch lamented death of their President, His Highness\r\nSheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, ruler of the\r\nEmirate of Abu Dhabi for 25 years and President of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates for 33 years.\r\nSheikh Zayed transformed his country, guided by\r\nhis great faith and a philosophy that stated that it was\r\nthe duty of every person to seek to improve the lives of\r\nhis people. His life’s work remains as a living tribute to\r\nhis devotion and unswerving conviction. The United\r\nArab Emirates have lost a great man of vision and\r\ngreat impact — that impact can be seen in the basic\r\ninfrastructure, as well as in great projects devoted to\r\nthe environment, education and the development of the\r\noil industry, whereby he turned the desert into an oasis.\r\nOver time, Sheikh Zayed won the recognition in his\r\nregion as a great statesman, and his international\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.49\r\nexperience strengthened his administration. He will be\r\nmissed and will be remembered particularly as a great\r\nman who was able to translate his dreams into reality\r\nfor the benefit of his people.\r\nWe share the sorrow of the royal family at this\r\ntime of mourning and sadness and, particularly, we\r\nextend to the people and Government of the United\r\nArab Emirates our full solidarity and send them\r\ncomfort in the hope that they can recover the strength\r\nto live.\r\nMr. McIvor (New Zealand): On behalf of Group\r\nof Western European and other States, I have the\r\nhonour to speak in tribute to His Highness Sheikh\r\nZayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, President of the United\r\nArab Emirates and ruler of Abu Dhabi, who sadly\r\npassed away on 2 November. Sheikh Zayed was a\r\nstrong and visionary leader of his people and a\r\nunifying force in the region. He played a central role in\r\nthe formation of the United Arab Emirates in 1971 and\r\nwas elected President of the new federation. With\r\nsubsequent re-elections, he continued to rule the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates for over 30 years — a period\r\nwhen the country prospered under his able leadership.\r\nDuring that time, Sheikh Zayed played a major role in\r\nthe formation of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which\r\nwas officially established in 1981. That was one of his\r\nmost lasting and admired achievements. On this sad\r\noccasion, I wish to convey the most sincere\r\ncondolences of the members of the Group of Western\r\nEuropean and other States to the Government and\r\npeople of the United Arab Emirates and Abu Dhabi,\r\nand to the family, friends and colleagues of Sheikh\r\nZayed.\r\nMr. Ghafari (United States of America): On\r\nbehalf of the United States, I extend my deepest\r\ncondolences to the Government and people of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates upon the passing of the founder\r\nof their country, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.\r\nSheikh Zayed lead his nation with exemplary\r\nleadership and tolerance. He avidly pursued\r\ndevelopment and modernization. His leadership and\r\nvision united seven independent emirates into one\r\nnation. His cherished friendship with the United States\r\nwill not be forgotten and will certainly be missed.\r\nSheikh Zayed will be remembered for his wise\r\ndirection, humanitarian leadership and tolerance.\r\nThe essence of Sheikh Zayed’s philosophy,\r\nderived from his deeply held Moslem faith, was that it\r\nis the duty of man to improve the life of his fellow\r\nmen. His record of leadership within the Emirates and\r\nthe international community demonstrated the\r\ndedication and seriousness with which he sought to put\r\nthat belief into practice. We appreciate this opportunity\r\nto honour a man whose contribution to his country and\r\nintimate involvement in our Organization will be\r\nmissed by all. We send our deepest sympathies to\r\nSheikh Zayed’s family members.\r\nMr. Al-Shamsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I am taking the floor before the General\r\nAssembly to thank it for this special tribute to the head\r\nof State of the United Arab Emirates, His Highness\r\nSheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, our dear brother.\r\nHe has returned to God, who called him back on the\r\n19th day of Ramadan, that is 2 November 2004. I\r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, his team and all the high officials of the\r\ninternational community, the representatives of\r\nregional groups and of Permanent Missions and State\r\nleaders for their condolences and for the moving\r\nexpressions of sympathy that they have addressed\r\nregarding our late, lamented leader. Those tributes have\r\nbeen marked by a generosity of spirit, paying tribute to\r\nhis wisdom, his generosity, his accomplishments and\r\ngood deeds and his effectiveness in the service of\r\nconcord, peace and harmony among peoples, for which\r\nhe remains a symbol and a testament — not only for\r\nhis people and his country, but also for the\r\ninternational community and for the region to which\r\nwe belong. At this sad time I find it hard to find words\r\nthat will enable me to convey to you with proper\r\neloquence the loss that we feel in the Emirates and\r\nthroughout the Arab and Muslim world, resulting from\r\nthe passing of this dear leader who always strove to\r\nrespect the principles of our Islamic religion and his\r\nheritage. Over more than 45 years, he worked and gave\r\ntirelessly to promote the good of his people. Despite\r\nthe extremely difficult circumstances under which he\r\nstruggled, he was able to leave behind him a precious\r\nand unique legacy of unity, solidarity, tolerance and\r\njustice, as well as human development and scientific\r\nand technological progress. He was a great\r\nhumanitarian and he will be remembered for that by\r\nposterity. His wisdom and his penetrating judgement\r\nwas employed in the service and unity of his country\r\nand his people, but, above and beyond that, he\r\ndemonstrated a diplomatic wisdom, skill and generous\r\nassistance that transcended our borders and served the\r\ncause of peace, development and dignity in all corners\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.49\r\nof the world. He never hesitated to devote his efforts\r\ntirelessly to strengthening brotherly relations and\r\nrelationships of friendship and mutual respect among\r\nall peoples of the world. He was unstinting in his\r\nassistance and support of the causes of peoples and\r\nnations. He oversaw the resolution of economic and\r\npolitical crises, as well as humanitarian crises caused\r\nby natural disasters. He won the friendship of nations,\r\nwhich esteem him greatly for his balanced and\r\nmeasured policies. Today, we all accept the decision of\r\nGod, who has called back our much-lamented,\r\ninspiring, courageous leader to his side. His stature is\r\ntruly international and far exceeds our national borders.\r\nHe strove to assure peace and security and his skills\r\nand qualities are famous, not only within our borders,\r\nbut also at the international level and especially in our\r\nregion.\r\nThe Sultan has left behind his son as the new\r\nruler, who came into office yesterday pursuant to the\r\nConstitution. He will be receiving the support of the\r\npeople. I thank the heads of State and Government for\r\ntheir condolences. Our country will continue to pursue\r\nits balanced policy with full respect for our\r\ninternational commitments and our legal obligations\r\nunder the Charter of the United Nations and the\r\nprinciples of international law.\r\nThe memory of our late, lamented leader, Sheikh\r\nZayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, will be an unquenchable\r\nsource of inspiration because of his work to promote\r\npeace and to build a more humane world. We trust in\r\nGod and may the peace of God be with you all.\r\nAgenda item 13\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice\r\n(A/59/4)\r\nReport by the Secretary-General (A/59/372)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): May I take it\r\nthat the Assembly takes note of the report of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In connection\r\nwith this item, the Assembly also has before it a report\r\nof the Secretary-General on the Secretary-General’s\r\nTrust Fund to Assist States in the Settlement of\r\nDisputes through the International Court of Justice,\r\nwhich has been circulated in document A/59/372.\r\nI call on Mr. Shi Jiuyong, President of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\nMr. Shi Jiuyong (International Court of Justice):\r\nIt is a great privilege and an honour for me, in my\r\ncapacity as President of the International Court of\r\nJustice, to address the General Assembly of the United\r\nNations on the occasion of its examination of the report\r\nof the Court for the period from 1 August 2003 to\r\n31 July 2004.\r\nFor more than a decade now, the Assembly has\r\ninvited the President of the International Court of\r\nJustice to present an annual review of the Court’s\r\nactivities and achievements. Before I summarize the\r\nevents of the preceding year, I should like to express\r\nmy gratitude for this opportunity, which I believe\r\ndemonstrates the Assembly’s ongoing interest in and\r\nsupport for the Court in its role as the principal judicial\r\norgan of the United Nations.\r\nIt is also a particular pleasure to address you\r\ntoday under the distinguished presidency of Mr. Jean\r\nPing, Minister of State, Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nCooperation and la Francophonie of Gabon, and the\r\ntenth African President of the Assembly. I congratulate\r\nhim on his election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session and applaud the\r\ncommitment made by him and his country to the\r\nUnited Nations mission to build a more caring world in\r\nwhich future generations are freed from the ravages of\r\nwar and underdevelopment. I should like to wish him\r\nall success in office and in particular with his initiative\r\nto pursue broadened consultations with the\r\ninternational community aimed at revitalizing and\r\nreforming the Organization.\r\nThe Court has transmitted its annual report to the\r\nAssembly, along with an introductory summary. As the\r\nreport is somewhat lengthy, I trust that the following\r\nrésumé will provide a useful overview of its essential\r\nelements.\r\nAs I reported last year, 191 States are parties to\r\nthe Statute of the Court, and more than 65 of them have\r\naccepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court in\r\naccordance with article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute.\r\nIn addition, approximately 300 treaties make reference\r\nto the Court with respect to the settlement of disputes\r\narising from their application or interpretation.\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.49\r\nSince I addressed the Assembly in October 2003,\r\nthe Court has held five sets of oral hearings relating to\r\nno fewer than 12 cases, with the hearings in all eight\r\ncases concerning the legality of the use of force having\r\nbeen held simultaneously. In addition, the Court has\r\nrendered final judgments in three cases and has\r\ndelivered one advisory opinion. That level of activity is\r\nunprecedented in the history of the Court, and, as a\r\nresult of such efforts, the number of cases on the\r\nCourt’s docket were reduced from 25 a year ago to 20\r\nat the end of the review period. Today, there are in fact\r\n21 cases on the General List, following the institution\r\nof proceedings by Romania against Ukraine on 16\r\nSeptember 2004. Given that in the 1970s the Court had\r\nvery few cases on its docket, and that from 1990 to\r\n1997 it had between nine and 13, the current number of\r\ncases represents a substantial workload.\r\nThe contentious cases pending before the Court\r\noriginate from all over the world: there are 11 between\r\nEuropean States, four between African States, two\r\nbetween Latin American States and one between Asian\r\nStates. In addition, there are two cases of an\r\nintercontinental nature. The Court’s international\r\ncharacter is also reflected in its composition. It\r\ncurrently has the benefit of members from Brazil,\r\nChina, Egypt, France, Germany, Japan, Jordan,\r\nMadagascar, the Netherlands, the Russian Federation,\r\nSierra Leone, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, the\r\nUnited States of America and Venezuela.\r\nThe cases included on the docket over the past\r\nyear illustrate the variety of international disputes that\r\nare customarily referred to the Court. The Court is\r\naccustomed to handling territorial disputes between\r\nneighbouring States that are seeking the determination\r\nof their land and maritime boundaries or a decision\r\nwith respect to sovereignty over particular areas.\r\nCurrently, there are four such cases on the General\r\nList, concerning, respectively, Nicaragua and\r\nHonduras, Nicaragua and Colombia, Benin and Niger,\r\nand Malaysia and Singapore.\r\nStates also regularly submit disputes to the Court\r\nconcerning the treatment of their nationals by other\r\nStates. That is the position in the extant cases between\r\nGuinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nbetween the Republic of the Congo and France, and\r\nalso in the recently decided case concerning Avena and\r\nother Mexican nationals.\r\nAnother category of cases that is frequently\r\nreferred to the Court concerns the use of force. Such\r\nproceedings often relate to events that have been\r\nbrought before the General Assembly or the Security\r\nCouncil. At the moment, the Court is seized of two\r\ncases in which Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia,\r\nrespectively, have sought the condemnation of Serbia\r\nand Montenegro for violations of the 1948 United\r\nNations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment\r\nof the Crime of Genocide. The Court is also dealing\r\nwith the cases on the legality of the use of force that\r\nare being pursued by Serbia and Montenegro against\r\neight member States of NATO. In those eight cases,\r\nSerbia and Montenegro is challenging the legality of\r\nthe military action of NATO member States in Kosovo.\r\nFinally, the Court is dealing with two cases against\r\nUganda and Rwanda in which the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo contends that it has been the victim of\r\narmed aggression.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, in the course of the period\r\nunder review, the Court rendered a judgment on the\r\nmerits in three cases and delivered one advisory\r\nopinion. I shall now deal with those decisions in\r\nchronological order.\r\nOn 6 November 2003, the Court handed down its\r\njudgment in the case concerning oil platforms, Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran v. United States of America. By way\r\nof background, in November 1992, the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran instituted proceedings against the\r\nUnited States of America arising from the attacks on\r\nand destruction of three Iranian offshore oil production\r\nplatforms by warships of the United States Navy in\r\nOctober 1987 and April 1988. In its application, the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran contended that those acts\r\nconstituted a “fundamental breach” of certain\r\nprovisions of the 1955 Treaty of Amity, Economic\r\nRelations and Consular Rights between the United\r\nStates and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and that they\r\nalso constituted a violation of international law. The\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran sought reparation for the\r\ndamage caused to its oil platforms.\r\nThe United States disputed the claim of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran and counterclaimed that the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran had violated the 1955 Treaty\r\nby attacking vessels in the Gulf and by otherwise\r\nengaging in military actions that were dangerous and\r\ndetrimental to commerce and navigation between the\r\ntwo countries. The United States also sought reparation\r\nfor any injury suffered.\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.49\r\nIn its judgment on the merits, the Court — having\r\ncarried out a detailed examination of the evidence\r\nprovided by the parties — held, first, that the actions of\r\nthe United States against the Iranian oil platforms\r\ncould not be justified as measures necessary to protect\r\nthe essential security interests of the United States, as\r\nenvisaged in article XX, paragraph 1 (d), of the 1955\r\nTreaty. The Court concluded that recourse to force\r\nunder that provision was permitted only if a party was\r\nacting in self-defence — that is to say, if it had been\r\nthe victim of an armed attack and if the actions taken\r\nwere necessary and proportionate.\r\nThe Court then examined the issue of whether the\r\nUnited States, in destroying the oil platforms, had\r\nimpeded their normal operation and prevented the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran from enjoying freedom of\r\ncommerce between the two territories, as guaranteed\r\nby article X, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of Amity. The\r\nCourt found that there was, in fact, no commerce\r\nbetween the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United\r\nStates in respect of oil produced by those particular\r\nplatforms at the time of the attacks. Consequently, the\r\nCourt held that neither the Islamic Republic of Iran’s\r\nsubmission nor its claim for reparation could be\r\nupheld.\r\nIn respect of the counterclaim of the United\r\nStates concerning the alleged breach by the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran of the obligations under the Treaty of\r\nAmity, the Court concluded, on the evidence before it,\r\nthat there had not been any impediment to commerce\r\nand navigation between the territories of the parties.\r\nConsequently, the Court held that the submissions and\r\nthe claim for reparation of the United States should\r\nalso be rejected.\r\nThe second of the judgments on the merits, in the\r\ncase requesting a revision of the Judgment of\r\n11 September 1992 in El Salvador v. Honduras —\r\nconcerning the land, island and maritime frontier\r\ndispute between El Salvador and Honduras, with\r\nNicaragua intervening — was delivered in December\r\n2003. The Chamber of the Court formed to deal with\r\nthat case found that El Salvador’s application for\r\nrevision of the 1992 Judgment was inadmissible. In its\r\nJudgment, the Chamber recalled, first, that under\r\narticle 61 of the Statute of the Court, a revision could\r\nonly be requested by a party upon satisfaction of the\r\nconditions contemplated by the Statute, namely, that\r\nthe revision should be “based upon the discovery of [a]\r\nfact” which must be “of such a nature as to be a\r\ndecisive factor”, and should have been “unknown to\r\nthe Court and also to the party claiming revision” when\r\nthe judgment was given.\r\nOne section of the boundary determined by the\r\n1992 Judgment followed the course of a river known as\r\nthe Goascorán. El Salvador claimed that it was in\r\npossession of scientific, technical and historical\r\nevidence that showed the previous course of the River\r\nGoascorán, and its avulsion in the mid-eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\nThe Chamber, however, held that the 1992\r\nJudgment had been based on El Salvador’s conduct\r\nduring the nineteenth century with regard to the course\r\nof the boundary at that time, and not on a\r\ndetermination of the original course of the river, so\r\nevidence of avulsion could not have been a decisive\r\nfactor.\r\nSecondly, El Salvador sought to rely on a newly\r\ndiscovered copy of an eighteenth century map and\r\nreport, which had been found in the Newberry Library\r\nin Chicago and that differed from the copies presented\r\nin evidence by Honduras in the original proceedings.\r\nHowever, the Chamber found that the copies produced\r\nby El Salvador varied only slightly from the ones used\r\nin 1992 and did not constitute a “decisive factor” as\r\nrequired by article 61 of the Statute.\r\nMoving on to the judgments delivered this year:\r\non 31 March 2004 the Court delivered its decision in\r\nMexico v. United States of America, a case concerning\r\nAvena and other Mexican nationals. Mexico had\r\ninstituted proceedings against the United States of\r\nAmerica regarding alleged breaches of articles 5 and\r\n36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of\r\n24 April 1963 that arose from the conduct of criminal\r\nproceedings against 52 Mexican nationals who had\r\nbeen tried, convicted and sentenced to death in the\r\nUnited States.\r\nThe Court’s first task was to consider the\r\napplicability of paragraph 1 (b) of article 36 of the\r\nVienna Convention, which sets out the obligations of a\r\nreceiving State in relation to consular notification.\r\nHaving found that the United States was subject to\r\nthose obligations, the Court determined the meaning of\r\nthe expression “without delay” in the context of the\r\nperformance of the requirements of paragraph 1 (b).\r\nOn the basis of that interpretation, the Court held\r\nthat in 51 of the cases the United States had breached\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.49\r\nits obligation to inform a foreign national of his rights\r\nto consular notification when “arrested or committed to\r\nprison or to custody pending trial or ... detained in any\r\nother manner”, and in 49 of the cases the United States\r\nhad failed to notify a Mexican consular post about the\r\ndetention of Mexican nationals. Then, noting the\r\ninterrelated nature of the three subparagraphs (a), (b)\r\nand (c) of paragraph 1 of article 36 of the Vienna\r\nConvention, the Court went on to find that in 49 of the\r\ncases the United States had breached its obligation\r\nunder subparagraph 1 (a) to enable Mexican consular\r\nofficers to communicate with, have access to and visit\r\ntheir nationals and that in 34 cases the United States\r\nhad violated its obligation under subparagraph 1 (c) to\r\nenable Mexican consular officers to arrange for legal\r\nrepresentation of their nationals.\r\nMexico had also alleged that the United States\r\nhad violated its obligation under article 36, paragraph\r\n2, of the Vienna Convention by failing to provide\r\nmeaningful and effective review and reconsideration of\r\nconvictions and sentences. The Court found that the\r\nUnited States had indeed breached that obligation in 3\r\ncases, but that the possibility of judicial re-examination\r\nwas still open in the other 49.\r\nThe Court held that the review and\r\nreconsideration of the convictions and sentences of the\r\nMexican nationals by United States courts would\r\nprovide adequate reparation for the violations of article\r\n36 of the Vienna Convention. Although the Court\r\nrecognized that the means of effecting the review and\r\nreconsideration were a matter for the United States to\r\ndecide, it expressed its view that it was the judicial\r\nprocess that was suited to such a task.\r\nFinally, on 9 July this year, in response to a\r\nrequest by the General Assembly, the Court rendered\r\nits Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the\r\nConstruction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian\r\nTerritory.\r\nBefore addressing the question posed by the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Court considered whether it had\r\njurisdiction to respond to the request and examined the\r\njudicial propriety of exercising its jurisdiction in that\r\ninstance. The Court found, unanimously, that it had\r\njurisdiction to give the advisory opinion and decided,\r\nby 14 votes to one, to accede to the request.\r\nHaving dealt with those preliminary issues, the\r\nCourt then addressed the legality of the construction of\r\nthe wall, as a precursor to dealing with the legal\r\nconsequences of its construction.\r\nThe Court found, by 14 votes to one, that the\r\nconstruction of the wall being built by Israel, the\r\noccupying Power, in the occupied Palestinian territory,\r\nincluding in and around East Jerusalem, and its\r\nassociated regime, are contrary to international law.\r\nWith regard to the legal consequences of these\r\nviolations, the Court distinguished between the\r\nconsequences for Israel, those for other States and\r\nthose for the United Nations. Turning firstly to the\r\nconsequences for Israel, the Court, by 14 votes to one,\r\nfound that Israel is under an obligation to terminate its\r\nbreaches of international law, and that it is under an\r\nobligation to cease forthwith the work of construction\r\nof the wall being built in the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritory, including in and around East Jerusalem, to\r\ndismantle forthwith the structure therein situated, and\r\nto repeal or render ineffective forthwith all legislative\r\nand regulatory acts relating thereto.\r\nThe Court further decided, again by 14 votes to\r\none, that Israel is under an obligation to make\r\nreparations for all damage caused by the construction\r\nof the wall in the occupied Palestinian territory,\r\nincluding in and around East Jerusalem.\r\nIn respect of the consequences for other States,\r\nthe Court found, by 13 votes to two, that all States are\r\nunder an obligation not to recognize the illegal\r\nsituation resulting from the construction of the wall\r\nand not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the\r\nsituation created by such construction and that, in\r\naddition, all States parties to the Fourth Geneva\r\nConvention relative to the Protection of Civilian\r\nPersons in Time of War of 12 August 1949, have the\r\nobligation, while respecting the United Nations Charter\r\nand international law, to ensure compliance by Israel\r\nwith international humanitarian law as embodied in\r\nthat Convention.\r\nFinally, with regard to the United Nations, the\r\nCourt found, by 14 votes to one, that the United\r\nNations, and especially the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council, should consider what further action\r\nis required to bring to an end the illegal situation\r\nresulting from the construction of the wall and its\r\nassociated regime, taking due account of the advisory\r\nopinion.\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.49\r\nIn the preparation of its advisory opinion, the\r\nCourt examined the international law principles\r\nrelating to the prohibition of the threat or use of force,\r\nand the extant rules governing the acquisition and\r\noccupation of territory. It also addressed the principle\r\nof self-determination, and considered the applicability\r\nof international humanitarian law and human rights law\r\nin the occupied Palestinian territory.\r\nAs well as reviewing these vital elements of\r\ninternational law, which are enshrined in numerous\r\ntreaties, including the United Nations Charter, and in\r\ncustomary law, and reflected in various resolutions of\r\nthe General Assembly, the Court also recognized the\r\nneed for the construction of the wall to be placed in a\r\nmore general context. In particular, the Court noted\r\nthat Israel and Palestine are under an obligation\r\nscrupulously to observe the rules of international\r\nhumanitarian law, and expressed the view that the\r\ntragic situation in the region can be brought to an end\r\nonly through the implementation in good faith of all\r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nThe Court also drew the attention of the General\r\nAssembly to the need for efforts to be encouraged with\r\na view to achieving as soon as possible, on the basis of\r\ninternational law, a negotiated solution to the\r\noutstanding problems and the establishment of a\r\nPalestinian State, existing side by side with Israel and\r\nits other neighbours, with peace and security for all in\r\nthe region.\r\nAs well as delivering these judgments and the\r\nadvisory opinion, the Court has completed the hearings\r\non the preliminary objections of the respondents in the\r\neight “Legality of Use of Force” cases brought by\r\nSerbia and Montenegro against States members of\r\nNATO. In addition, hearings on the preliminary\r\nobjections of Germany have recently taken place in the\r\nCertain Property (Liechtenstein v. Germany) case,\r\nwhich concerns Czechoslovakia’s treatment of the\r\nproperty of Liechtenstein nationals as German assets\r\nfollowing the Second World War. All nine cases are\r\ncurrently under deliberation.\r\nThe achievements of the Court during the review\r\nperiod reflects its commitment to dealing with cases as\r\npromptly and efficiently as possible, while maintaining\r\nthe quality of its judgments and respecting the\r\nconsensual nature of its jurisdiction.\r\nIt is gratifying to note the increased use of the\r\nCourt by States over recent years, and in order to meet\r\nthis growing demand and fulfil its judicial\r\nresponsibilities, the Court has taken further steps in the\r\nreview period to improve its judicial efficiency. Since I\r\nlast reported to the Assembly, the Court has undertaken\r\na thorough review of its working methods, and as a\r\nresult has introduced measures to enhance its internal\r\nfunctioning and encourage greater compliance by\r\nparties with previous decisions aimed at accelerating\r\nthe procedure in contentious proceedings.\r\nWith these aims in mind, the Court has recently\r\namended existing Practice Direction V and\r\npromulgated new Practice Directions X, XI and XII.\r\nAmended Practice Direction V clarifies that the four-\r\nmonth period for the presentation by a party of its\r\nobservations and submissions on preliminary\r\nobjections runs from the date of the filing of the\r\npreliminary objections. Practice Direction X requests\r\nthe agents of the parties to attend without delay any\r\nmeeting called by the President of the Court on a\r\nprocedural issue. Practice Direction XI provides that in\r\noral pleadings on provisional measures, parties should\r\nlimit themselves to dealing with matters that are\r\nrelevant to the criteria for the indication of such\r\nprovisional measures; it thereby addresses a problem\r\nwhich I noted in my speech to the Assembly last year.\r\nFinally, Practice Direction XII sets out the\r\nprocedure to be followed with regard to written\r\nstatements or documents submitted by international\r\nnon-governmental organizations in connection with\r\nadvisory proceedings. These additions to the Court’s\r\nPractice Directions will supplement its efforts to\r\nexpedite the examination of cases which have been\r\nreported to the Assembly in previous years.\r\nI should now like to draw the Assembly’s\r\nattention to a few matters concerning the budget of the\r\nCourt for the 2004-2005 biennium. The financial\r\nsupport of the General Assembly is greatly appreciated\r\nby the Court, and the Court in turn recognizes its\r\nresponsibility to apply those funds wisely.\r\nThe 2004-2005 biennium was agreed in advance\r\nof the General Assembly’s urgent request for an\r\nadvisory opinion on the legal consequences of the\r\nconstruction of a wall in the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritory. Both the public hearings and the delivery of\r\nthe advisory opinion attracted unprecedented world\r\nattention. Meeting the demands of the media and\r\nproviding adequate security placed a great burden on\r\nthe Court’s resources, and it is now clear that the Court\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.49\r\nwill require additional funds to cover its expenses for\r\nthe 2004-2005 biennium. I sincerely hope that the\r\nallocation of such funds will be authorized as soon as\r\npossible, so that the Court can rest assured that it has\r\nadequate financial support to perform its role in the\r\nyear ahead.\r\nIn the review period, the Court has continued to\r\nenhance its use of modern technology, building on the\r\nachievements that I outlined in October 2003.\r\nHowever, in order to continue this process and comply\r\nwith the wishes of the General Assembly in that\r\nregard, it is essential for the Court to have the benefit\r\nof a high-level professional officer in the\r\nComputerization Division. Therefore, the Court will\r\nrepeat the request made last year for the creation of a\r\npost to enable it to recruit a senior informational\r\ntechnology staff member with extensive experience and\r\nappropriate qualifications.\r\nFinally, on behalf of the Court, I should like to\r\nexpress thanks for the approval of a number of specific\r\nrequests. In particular, five new law clerk posts were\r\nconverted from temporary to established positions,\r\nand, on the recommendation of the United Nations\r\nSecurity Coordinator, two security posts were created.\r\nSince its establishment in 1946 — more than half\r\na century ago — the International Court of Justice has\r\ncontributed to the promotion and development of a\r\nunified international legal system, both by the\r\nadjudication of contentious disputes between States\r\nand by the exercise of its advisory function.\r\nIn the period under review, it has demonstrated its\r\nability to deal with a varied and demanding caseload. It\r\nhas clearly shown that it can react urgently and\r\nefficiently to meet the needs of States, as in the case\r\nconcerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals, and to\r\nrespond to requests from the General Assembly for an\r\nadvisory opinion. In performing its role as the principal\r\njudicial organ of the United Nations, the Court is\r\nalways conscious of the purposes and principles of the\r\nOrganization, and it is particularly aware of its\r\nresponsibility to contribute to the maintenance of peace\r\nand security in every region of the world.\r\nIn order to achieve these aims and perform its\r\nfunctions, the Court looks to the other principal organs\r\nfor support and guidance, recognizing that those organs\r\noperate on a strictly equal footing, each affording due\r\ndeference to the authority of the others.\r\nIt remains for me to thank the Assembly sincerely\r\non behalf of the International Court of Justice for its\r\nencouragement and assistance during the review\r\nperiod, and to express my hope that this cooperation\r\nand understanding will increase in the years to come,\r\nso that the Court can contribute to the vision of a\r\nrevitalized and effective United Nations.\r\nMr. Balarezo (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): First of\r\nall, on behalf of the Government and the people of\r\nPeru, we wish to convey our condolences on the death\r\nof the President of the United Arab Emirates.\r\nI wish to thank the President of the International\r\nCourt of Justice, Judge Shi Jiuyong, for his\r\nintroduction of the annual report on the work of the\r\nCourt. The International Court of Justice is the\r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations. Its\r\ncontribution to the peaceful settlement of disputes and\r\nto the rule of law at the international level has been\r\ncrucial since its inception and continues to be so today.\r\nBearing in mind the far-reaching importance of\r\nthe role of the International Court of Justice in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and its\r\ncontribution to achieving the fundamental purposes of\r\nthe United Nations through the peaceful settlement of\r\nlegal disputes between States, Peru deems it of the\r\ngreatest importance that the Court’s jurisdiction be\r\nuniversally accepted.\r\nToday only 65 States, including Peru, have\r\naccepted the binding jurisdiction of the Court pursuant\r\nto paragraph 2 of article 36 of the Statute of the Court.\r\nWe would urge all States that have not yet done so to\r\naccept the binding jurisdiction of the Court without\r\nconditions, to submit their disputes to this body, and to\r\ncomply with its rulings.\r\nIn 1989, the Secretary-General’s Trust Fund to\r\nAssist States in the Settlement of Disputes through the\r\nInternational Court of Justice was set up in order to\r\nsupport States prepared to resolve their disputes\r\nthrough the Court but deterred by the cost of the\r\nprocess or of abiding by the ruling.\r\nPeru welcomes the amendments made to the\r\nmandate of the Trust Fund, which are set out in the\r\nreport contained in document A/59/372. The expansion\r\nof the eligibility criteria whereby States may receive\r\nfinancial assistance from the Fund and the\r\nestablishment of a mechanism for advances are\r\npositive changes which will undoubtedly make it\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.49\r\npossible for more States to consider recourse to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice for the peaceful\r\nsettlement of their disputes.\r\nPeru expresses its recognition to those States that\r\nhave made contributions to the Fund and echoes the\r\nappeal of the Secretary-General to States,\r\nintergovernmental organizations, national institutions\r\nand non-governmental organizations, as well as natural\r\nand legal persons, to continue to make voluntary\r\ncontributions to the Fund. The increasing number of\r\ncases that have been submitted for the Court’s\r\nconsideration — which is currently approximately\r\n20 — attests to the commitment of States to peaceful\r\nmeans for the settlement of disputes and is a clear\r\ndemonstration of the international community’s\r\nincreasing trust in this jurisdictional authority.\r\nThe Court — precisely because of the many cases\r\nbefore it and recognizing how important it is that\r\njustice be administered not only efficiently, but in a\r\ntimely manner — has again reviewed its working\r\nmethods, and in July it adopted effective additional\r\nlegal guidelines aimed at expediting cases. Peru\r\nappreciates that review and respectfully urges the\r\nCourt to persevere in that effort.\r\nMy country also wishes to highlight the work of\r\nthe Court in publicizing its activities and decisions.\r\nThe dissemination of information by electronic\r\nmeans — particularly the Court’s web site — are\r\nsignificant tools for ensuring that the Court’s valuable\r\nactivities are widely known. Peru commends the Court\r\nfor that work and encourages it to consider options\r\nwith regard to further publicizing its judicial activities\r\nin all of the official United Nations languages. In that\r\nconnection, so as not to incur additional expense, we\r\nshould explore the possibility of academic institutions\r\nworking together to translate documentation and\r\nmaking it available to interested parties through\r\nelectronic means.\r\nFinally, I should like to reaffirm the resolve of\r\nPeru —a country that has historically demonstrated its\r\nstrict respect for international law and peaceful means\r\nfor the settlement of disputes — to continue to support\r\nthe International Court of Justice in carrying out the\r\nlofty responsibilities entrusted to it by the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nMr. Kitaoka (Japan): It is my great pleasure and\r\nhonour, on behalf of the Government of Japan, to\r\naddress the Assembly under the presidency of His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jean Ping.\r\nFirst of all, I would like to express my sincere\r\nappreciation to Judge Shi Jiuyong, President of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ), for his\r\ncomprehensive presentation on the report of the ICJ\r\n(A/59/4) today. My delegation would like to express its\r\ngratitude and support for the achievements of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice over the past year.\r\nThere is a growing awareness among nations that\r\nthe international community must establish law and\r\norder and that international law should play a greater\r\nrole in that regard. International law is a dynamic legal\r\nsystem that has continued to evolve over time.\r\nNeedless to say, interpreting and implementing\r\ninternational law require not only profound knowledge\r\nof the law, but also wisdom and far-sightedness on the\r\npart of the international community. From that point of\r\nview, the importance of the role of the Court, as the\r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations, cannot\r\nbe overstated.\r\nJapan is a State that believes in the rule of law\r\nand steadfastly upholds the principle of the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes. The Secretary-General, in his\r\naddress to the General Assembly on 21 September this\r\nyear, also reaffirmed the importance of respect for the\r\nrule of law. Japan appreciates the achievements of the\r\nCourt in the past year, during which — despite a high\r\nnumber of cases on the docket — the Court managed to\r\ndeliver judgments and an opinion based on in-depth\r\nconsideration of the relevant legal issues. This year, we\r\nhave also witnessed some notable decisions involving\r\ncontroversial issues in international law. The question\r\nof whether or not the Court should remain within the\r\ntraditional area of international law, applying only\r\nestablished jurisprudence, requires further discussion.\r\nBut it is a fact that the international community is\r\ndeveloping rapidly and that we require a system of\r\nlaws capable of addressing the latest situations\r\nconfronting the world. Therefore, with regard to\r\ninterpretations of the individual issues of international\r\nlaw that were highlighted by the Court, I believe that\r\nnations will eventually come to a common\r\nunderstanding.\r\nTo conclude my statement, I would like once\r\nagain to underscore the great importance attached to\r\nthe International Court of Justice as the keeper of law\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.49\r\nand wisdom in our world. Japan will continue to\r\ncontribute to the invaluable work of the ICJ.\r\nMr. Rastam (Malaysia): I wish to join you,\r\nMr. President, and others in expressing the sincere\r\ncondolences and deep sympathy of my delegation to\r\nthe delegation of the United Arab Emirates upon the\r\ndemise of His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-\r\nNahyan, the late President of that country.\r\nMy delegation wishes to thank Judge Shi\r\nJiuyong, President of the International Court of Justice\r\n(ICJ), for his eloquent presentation of the report of the\r\nCourt (A/59/4). That comprehensive document is\r\nextremely useful in enabling Member States to\r\nunderstand and appreciate the complexity of the work\r\nof the Court and the complex issues that the Court\r\ndeals with.\r\nMalaysia would like to command the Court for its\r\ncontribution to the peaceful settlement of international\r\ndisputes between States and to the development of\r\ninternational law. It is self-evident that, if the\r\ninternational community wishes to resolve and prevent\r\nconflicts in a peaceful manner, it needs an impartial\r\nthird party that is competent to deal with the relevant\r\nlegal questions. The Court has undoubtedly played an\r\nimportant and influential role in the promotion of\r\npeace and harmony between nations and peoples of the\r\nworld through observance of the rule of law and by\r\nhelping to resolve disputes between States through\r\nlegal means, as well as by giving advisory opinions on\r\nlegal questions referred to it in accordance with\r\ninternational law. Malaysia recognizes that role and has\r\nfull confidence in the Court’s competence and ability\r\nto serve as the principal judicial organ of the United\r\nNations, as stipulated in the Charter of the United\r\nNations and the Statute of the ICJ.\r\nThe Court has been accessible to all States for the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. Acceptance of the\r\nCourt’s compulsory jurisdiction signifies that a nation\r\nis willing to acknowledge the adjudicative powers of\r\nthe Court in all legal disputes regarding the\r\ninterpretation of a treaty, any question of international\r\nlaw and the interpretation of other international\r\nobligations. Malaysia is pleased to note that, since\r\n1946, the Court has delivered 79 judgments and given\r\n25 advisory opinions. The increased use of the Court is\r\nstrong evidence that the level of confidence in the\r\nCourt is extremely high, for the reason that it can\r\ntrusted to be impartial and effective. We are pleased\r\nthat the Court has handed down very high-quality\r\njudgments and advisory opinions.\r\nMalaysia’s belief that the Court is the most\r\nappropriate avenue for the peaceful and final resolution\r\nof disputes when all efforts in diplomacy have been\r\nexhausted has been further strengthened by the\r\nconfidence that we and the international community\r\nhave in the role, function and accomplishments of the\r\nCourt. Malaysia itself has submitted to the Court cases\r\nof territorial disputes, in mutual agreement with the\r\nother parties concerned, for adjudication by the Court.\r\nMalaysia will fully respect the Court’s decision in such\r\ncases, consistent with its abiding adherence to\r\ninternational law. We firmly believe that respect for the\r\nCourt’s decisions would make a significant\r\ncontribution to enhancing the Court’s stature and\r\nprestige and, in turn, inculcate a culture of respect for\r\nthe rule of law at the international level.\r\nMy delegation believes that the significant\r\nincrease in the number of cases on the docket of the\r\nCourt as of 31 July 2004 augurs well for the\r\nprogressive development of international law and the\r\nrole of the Court as a dispute-settlement mechanism.\r\nWe note the acceptance by 65 States of the Court’s\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction in accordance with article 36,\r\nparagraph 2, of the Statute, and that some 300 bilateral\r\nor multilateral treaties provide for the Court to have\r\njurisdiction in the resolution of disputes arising out of\r\nthe application or interpretation of those respective\r\ntreaties. These welcome developments clearly\r\ndemonstrate the increasing confidence in the decisions\r\nof the Court and reliance on the settlement of disputes\r\nthrough adjudication, rather than by the use of force.\r\nThis manifestation of confidence in the rule of law is\r\nparticularly important at a time when the world is\r\nfacing many daunting threats and challenges.\r\nIn view of the increased workload of the Court,\r\nthere is an urgent need to strengthen its capacity to\r\nefficiently dispose of the cases before it, as well as to\r\nundertake the additional administrative responsibilities\r\narising therefrom. At the same time, we are pleased to\r\nnote that the Court reviewed its procedures and\r\nworking methods so as to further increase its\r\nproductivity. As emphasized in the report, even after\r\ntaking various measures, the Court will require\r\nadditional funds for the 2004-2005 budget because of\r\nthe extraordinary and unforeseen costs associated with,\r\ninter alia, security requirements and media demands\r\nincurred in connection with the issuance of the\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.49\r\nadvisory opinion on the question of the Legal\r\nConsequences of the Construction of a Wall in the\r\nOccupied Palestinian Territory.\r\nThat advisory opinion — which, inter alia, ruled\r\nthat the construction of the wall by Israel, the\r\noccupying Power, is contrary to international law and\r\nthat Israel is under obligation to terminate its breaches\r\nof international law — is indeed a significant milestone\r\nin the long-running effort to bring to an end the\r\nsuffering of and dire humanitarian consequences faced\r\nby the people in the occupied Palestinian territory and\r\nto ensure a just and lasting solution to the question of\r\nPalestine. Malaysia is pleased to have participated,\r\nthrough both written and oral submissions, in the open\r\nhearings at the Court in February 2004. We consider\r\nthe whole process of seeking and rendering the\r\nadvisory opinion to have been a clear manifestation of\r\nthe healthy relationship between the General Assembly\r\nand the Court, as envisaged under the Charter. We are,\r\nhowever, very disappointed that the advisory opinion\r\nhas not been heeded by Israel.\r\nMy delegation takes note of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the Secretary-General’s Trust\r\nFund, as contained in document A/59/372. We note the\r\nSecretary-General’s appeal to all States and other\r\nrelevant entities to give serious consideration to\r\nmaking contributions to the Fund, which has had a\r\ndecreasing level of resources since its inception. We\r\nalso note the revision in the terms of reference of the\r\nFund.\r\nMalaysia commends the efforts undertaken by the\r\nInternational Court of Justice to increase public\r\nawareness and understanding of its work in the judicial\r\nsettlement of international disputes, its advisory\r\nfunctions, case law and working methods, as well as its\r\nrole within the United Nations, through its publications\r\nand lectures by the President, members of the Court,\r\nthe Registrar and members of the Registry staff. We\r\nwelcome the Court’s distribution of press releases and\r\nbackground notes, as well as its handbook, aimed at\r\nkeeping the public informed about its work, functions\r\nand jurisdiction. We concur with the view that the\r\nCourt’s web site has been extremely useful and well\r\nutilized by diplomats, lawyers, academicians, students\r\nand interested members of the public as an important\r\nsource of access to the Court’s judgments, which\r\nconstitute the most recent developments in\r\ninternational case law. We hope that the Court will be\r\ngranted adequate resources to allow it to continue to\r\nfulfil its mandate and meet the demands of an\r\nincreasing workload.\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I should like first of all to join with all\r\nprevious speakers who have expressed their sincere\r\nand heartfelt condolences to our brothers from the\r\ndelegation of the United Arab Emirates for the loss of\r\ntheir leader, His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan\r\nAl-Nahyan, who was an eminent and very worthy man.\r\nI would also like to pay tribute to the President of\r\nthe International Court of Justice and to express\r\nappreciation to him for his efforts to strengthen the\r\nauthority of the rule of international law. I would like\r\nto thank him for his comprehensive statement on the\r\nwork of the Court for last year.\r\nSyria is deeply convinced of the important and\r\nfundamental role of justice in the life of peoples and\r\nnations. We believe that the International Court of\r\nJustice, as the main instrument of the United Nations\r\nfor the application of justice among nations, is\r\nqualified to protect rights and settle disputes.\r\nThe countries of the Arab region, including my\r\nown country, Syria, witnessed the first forms of justice\r\nwith the Code of Hammurabi thousands of years ago.\r\nThose countries stress the fact that our world today is\r\nin dire need of strict international order of justice that\r\nwould fulfil the requirements and deal with the\r\ndevelopments that have taken place in all fields in the\r\nregion in the past decade.\r\nSome of the disputes have often become open\r\nbloody conflicts, which undermine international peace\r\nand security. In that regard, we believe that the Charter\r\nis still the instrument that will make it possible to\r\nresolve many of those disputes. As its Statute makes\r\nclear, the International Court of Justice is called upon\r\nto address those disputes. An increasing number of\r\nStates have had recourse to the International Court of\r\nJustice in the past few years in order to resolve\r\ndisputes and put an end to contentious issues with other\r\nStates.\r\nHere, I would again like to reaffirm the\r\nimportance of ensuring adequate and needed funding\r\nfor the mandates of the Court so that it can do its job\r\nproperly.\r\nThe report submitted by Judge Shi Jiuyong,\r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, refers to\r\na large number of cases of which the Court has been\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.49\r\nseized recently, as well as the results achieved and the\r\nrespect that those decisions have received. I would like\r\nto refer in particular to the advisory opinion, which\r\nwas adopted almost unanimously, condemning the\r\nconstruction of a wall by Israel on occupied Palestinian\r\nterritory. The members of the Court stated almost\r\nunanimously that the building of that wall on occupied\r\nPalestinian territory was contrary to international law\r\nand that Israel should refrain from its violations put an\r\nend to the building of the wall and make the necessary\r\nreparations. We should also note that in its advisory\r\nopinion the Court stated that all States are bound not to\r\nrecognize the legal situation arising from the building\r\nof the wall and should press Israel to respect\r\ninternational humanitarian law, as embodied in the\r\nFourth Geneva Convention.\r\nThe advisory opinion also declared that the\r\nUnited Nations, including the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly, should take all necessary measures\r\nto put an end to the unlawful situation that has arisen\r\nfrom the building of the wall; we expect those bodies\r\nto play their proper role.\r\nThe International Court of Justice, the instrument\r\nthat the United Nations has for carrying out justice, has\r\nexpressed its opinion. What is more important,\r\ntherefore, is to implement the advisory opinion. The\r\npeoples of the world who believe in justice are waiting\r\nfor the implementation of the advisory opinion. Justice\r\nis not simply an opinion; its true value lies in its\r\nimplementation.\r\nWe believe that the peoples of the United Nations\r\nare anxious to see justice prevail, including justice for\r\nthe future of the Palestinian people, and to see the\r\nestablishment of its own independent State on its own\r\nterritory. Yet the world continues to witness Israel’s\r\nrejection of the provisions of international law and of\r\nthe International Court of Justice’s advisory opinion.\r\nSyria once again expresses its respect for the role\r\nand work of the Court, and along with other States\r\nMembers of the Organization that are devoted to\r\njustice and the rule of law, we will be relentless in our\r\nefforts to strengthen the role of the International Court\r\nof Justice in all respects.\r\nMr. Gómez Robledo (Mexico) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): My delegation wishes to convey its\r\nappreciation to the President of the International Court\r\nof Justice, Judge Shi Jiuyong, for the very detailed\r\nreport that he has presented to the General Assembly.\r\nMexico wishes to pay tribute once again to the\r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations for its\r\nconstant contribution to the development of\r\ninternational law and the promotion of justice among\r\nStates. The spectacular increase in the number of cases\r\nreferred to the Court is a clear and palpable sign of the\r\npolitical backing of the international community for its\r\njudicial practices, its impartiality and its independence.\r\nThe current workload of the Court greatly differs\r\nfrom the meagre number of cases submitted to it not so\r\nlong ago, for example, in the 1970s. At the present\r\ntime, the Court faces the challenge of resolving 21\r\ncases. Unquestionably, the end of the cold war helped\r\ntremendously to induce States to have recourse to the\r\nCourt to solve their disputes through peaceful means,\r\nso as not to endanger international peace and security,\r\nor justice.\r\nIn the context of constant growth and evolution,\r\nthe Court has not overlooked the needs resulting from\r\nits own success. Expediting the processing of cases and\r\nimproving its methods of work have been key factors\r\nin the strategic operational planning of the Court, with\r\na view to responding to current demands and the\r\ncomplexity that many cases have acquired from a\r\nprocedural point of view.\r\nMexico appreciates the efforts of the Court in that\r\narea, and encourages parties involved in contentious\r\ncases to cooperate fully with the Court and to follow its\r\nguidelines. In particular, we warmly welcome the\r\nrecent measures taken by the Court to enhance its\r\nproductivity, in terms of internal functioning, with the\r\ngoal, among other things, of shortening the period of\r\ntime between the conclusion of written activities, and\r\nthe opening of the oral proceedings. At the same time,\r\nMexico welcomes the adoption of a set of reforms to\r\nthe Court’s practical guidelines.\r\nThese comments on the activities of the Court are\r\nmerely the direct result of the recent first-hand\r\nexperience of Mexico, in the case in which my country\r\nwas involved with the United States — the case of\r\nAvena and Other Mexican Nationals v. The United\r\nStates of America. That was the first time that Mexico\r\ntook part in a contentious case before the Court. A\r\ndecision of such far-reaching importance could be\r\ntaken only if there was well-founded trust in the\r\nseriousness, strict legal standards and impartiality of\r\nthe Court. Mexico was not disappointed by the Court.\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.49\r\nConcerning the procedures in that case, the Court\r\nwas able to induce the parties not to delay the phases\r\nof the case, given the vital importance of the rights and\r\nthe laws at stake. The parties fully cooperated with the\r\nCourt, and the Court worked determinedly to meet the\r\nexpectations of the parties. Upon the request of the\r\napplicant, the Court ordered provisional measures in\r\norder to safeguard Mexico’s rights. The United States\r\nfully respected the Court’s order concerning\r\nprovisional measures.\r\nWith regard to the ruling on the substance of the\r\nissue, the Court, once again, did international law and\r\njustice a distinguished service. The actions of the Court\r\nresolved an issue which negotiations between the\r\nparties had not been able to achieve, over many years.\r\nIn Avena, the Court spelled out the scope of the\r\nobligations stemming from article 36 of the Vienna\r\nConvention on Consular Relations, regarding the right\r\nto notification of and information about, consular\r\nassistance, and clarified aspects which the parties\r\nwished to see defined, since the ruling in the LaGrand\r\ncase. In Avena, the Court spelled out the criteria which\r\ngovern the question of restitution, following violations\r\nof obligations stemming from article 36 of the Vienna\r\nConvention on Consular Relations.\r\nLastly, in Avena, the Court established principles\r\nwhich must be observed, generally, by all States parties\r\nto the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. In\r\nshort, Mexico was fully satisfied as regards the\r\napplication it made, and the pleas that it addressed to\r\nthe Court.\r\nWe convey our congratulations to Slovakia, for\r\nhaving joined this year the family of States recognizing\r\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the Court, pursuant to\r\nparagraphs 2 and 3 of article 36 of the Court’s Statute.\r\nSlovakia brings the number of States that have\r\ndeposited such declarations to 65. We urge the States\r\nthat have not already done so or those that have\r\nwithdrawn their declarations to accept, once and for\r\nall, the compulsory jurisdiction of the International\r\nCourt of Justice.\r\nRegarding the judicial practices of the Court, we\r\nshould note the key role the Court has played in\r\ndeveloping case law relating to questions concerning\r\nthe delimitation of maritime zones between States. The\r\ncase most recently brought before the Court by\r\nRomania against Ukraine, concerning a disputed\r\ndelimitation in the Black Sea, is an example of that\r\ntrend. Mexico will be monitoring those developments\r\nvery closely and we will be continuing its efforts on\r\nthe regional level to enable coastal States of the\r\nCaribbean Sea that so wish to draw on the financial\r\nmeans to obtain the necessary technical and legal\r\nassistance to begin bilateral negotiations on maritime\r\ndelimitation or even resort to judicial settlement. For\r\nthe third consecutive year Mexico has provided\r\nfinancial resources to the trust fund for maritime\r\ndelimitation in the Caribbean Sea, whose purpose is to\r\nprovide resources for technical assistance, as I just\r\nmentioned, in the area of maritime delimitation.\r\nIn that context, Mexico would also like to convey\r\nits appreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-General\r\nfor the review of the mandate of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Trust Fund to Assist States in the Settlement\r\nof Disputes through the International Court of Justice.\r\nWe encourage all States in a position to do so to make\r\ncontributions to that Fund.\r\nThe Court will continue to play a distinguished\r\nrole in the international judicial arena, which has been\r\nstrengthened by new institutions to benefit the\r\ninternational community. Mexico will continue to\r\nsupport all those mechanisms and institutions so as to\r\npromote the peaceful settlement of disputes among\r\nStates.\r\nThe Organization is experiencing the winds of\r\nchange. Mexico is convinced that institutional reforms\r\noccasioned by the process of change now under way\r\nshould not be confined to just one principal organ of\r\nour Organization. The reform process needs to be\r\ncomprehensive and, accordingly, it should embrace all\r\nthe principal organs of the United Nations, including\r\nthe International Court of Justice. Given the\r\nexpectation of possible changes in the composition of\r\nthe principal organs of the Organization, Mexico urges\r\nMember States to reflect upon the potential\r\nconsequences of those changes on the composition of\r\nthe Court. Mexico is ready to contribute to that\r\ndiscussion and at an appropriate time will be putting\r\nforward more detailed ideas on that issue.\r\nMr. Lavalle-Valdés (Guatemala) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): My delegation wishes to add its condolences\r\nto those expressed on the passing of the head of State\r\nof the United Arab Emirates.\r\nThe illustrious Grotius highlighted the need of\r\nhuman communities for law to govern their activities\r\nin order to ensure their survival, adding that that\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.49\r\ngeneralization applied to the human race as a whole. It\r\nmight be thought that, given the far-reaching changes\r\nthat have taken place in international relations since\r\nthe age of the great Dutch thinker, his comment, which\r\nas far as he was concerned related to all States then\r\nexisting, is very far from being applicable without\r\nqualification to the community of modern States. We,\r\nhowever, believe that Grotius’s ideas are still\r\nfundamentally valid. All the more so, since, as distinct\r\nfrom the events of his era, the activities of States and\r\nof individuals not fully controlled by such States can\r\ncause tremendous damage to the human race as a\r\nwhole.\r\nFor those who spoke Latin the close affinity\r\nbetween the concepts of law, judge and judgement —\r\nor, respectively, ius, iudex and iudicium — was\r\nobvious. It is as if, except for those absolutely\r\nprimitive laws that we believe no longer exist, there\r\ncan be no law without judges. Indeed, in a large\r\nnumber of juridical systems law is conceived of as\r\nsomething so inseparable from those who perform it\r\nthat their activity comes to be the principle modality of\r\nexpressing the law. Thus, it is understandable that for\r\ncenturies now States have occasionally referred their\r\ndisputes to ad hoc bodies of a judicial character. For\r\nsimilar reasons, much more recently, some States have\r\ndone the same on the regional and subregional levels,\r\nthrough collective intergovernmental organs of a much\r\nmore markedly judicial nature but which, despite their\r\nrelative permanency, generally lack comprehensive\r\njurisdiction.\r\nIt is also understandable, then, that there should\r\nbe a court equally competent to be seized of disputes\r\nbetween States, but whose jurisdiction is totally\r\ncomprehensive and in which practically all States\r\nparticipate or may participate. I am, of course,\r\nreferring to the International Court of Justice. If we\r\nregard the International Court of Justice more as a\r\ncontinuation than as a successor of the venerable\r\nPermanent Court of International Justice — which is\r\nhighly justifiable — it is plain that the Court to which I\r\nrefer is the is the one that was founded under the latter\r\nname in 1922, and then, in 1946, with changes that\r\nsimply reflected the new international order, it became\r\nthe Court whose report we are now considering and\r\nwhose activities in recent years have expanded in an\r\nimpressive fashion.\r\nThe annual consideration in the Assembly of the\r\nreport of the International Court of Justice, although it\r\nfollows an already traditional pattern, has not become a\r\nmere rote procedure, but is a real opportunity for\r\nMember States to study the report and to listen with\r\ngreat interest to the statement that that President of that\r\nvenerable institution makes. In that regard, I would like\r\nto say that we are all very grateful for the extremely\r\nimportant participation of the President of the Court in\r\nthis meeting, as he is able to make the contents of the\r\nreport come to life, enhancing to the highest degree the\r\nvalidity of our debate through his comments.\r\nConsideration of the report in the plenary meeting of\r\nthe Assembly is also an appropriate opportunity and a\r\nunique occasion for Member States wishing to do so to\r\nvoice their opinions about the Court in general and,\r\nmore specifically, about the work that it is doing, as\r\nwell as about the practical functioning of the Court.\r\nThus, we have before us a document of the\r\ngreatest interest and usefulness, owing not only to the\r\nfar-reaching topics that it addresses, but also to the\r\nscope and precision of the report and the care that has\r\ngone into its design and preparation. We also commend\r\nthe sound judgement of its authors in presenting\r\ninformation that is not overburdened with detail, but\r\nstill meets the need we all feel to familiarize ourselves\r\nwith the multiple activities of the Court, which cover a\r\nfairly broad range and which derive directly from the\r\nimplementation of the corresponding provisions of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and the Statute of the\r\nCourt.\r\nI would like to address some practical aspects of\r\nthe report (A/59/4). Paragraph 249, we believe, should\r\nreflect not only the amended Practice Directions, but\r\nalso the other amendments that were proposed. We\r\nwould like in the next report to include all the proposed\r\namendments to the Practice Directions. We know that\r\nthe texts appear on the Internet, but, all the same, we\r\nwould like to see them in the report.\r\nWe would like to reaffirm to the President of the\r\nCourt our profound appreciation for his attendance\r\nhere once again to introduce the report of his\r\ninstitution; and we would like to extend our thanks to\r\nthe secretariat of the Court for having prepared this\r\nvaluable document.\r\nMr. Ayua (Nigeria): This statement is being read\r\nout on behalf of the Permanent Representative of\r\nNigeria to the United Nations, His Excellency\r\nAmbassador Aminu Bashir Wali, who is unavoidably\r\nabsent.\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.49\r\nThe Nigerian delegation wishes to express its\r\nappreciation to Judge Shi Jiuyong, President of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ) for the\r\ncomprehensive annual report (A/59/4) now under\r\nconsideration. We commend the Court for the wide-\r\nranging activities covered in the report and the\r\nprinciples of justice and international law, which it\r\ncontinues to uphold.\r\nNigeria reiterates its conviction that the ICJ\r\nremains the only international court of universal\r\ncharacter with general jurisdiction concerning the\r\nsettlement of disputes freely submitted to it by\r\nsovereign States. In this regard, Nigeria is not only a\r\nState party to the Statute of the Court but is also one of\r\nthe 65 States that has deposited with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral a declaration of acceptance of the Court’s\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction in accordance with article 36,\r\nparagraph 2, of the Statute. Indeed, this formed the\r\nbasis of Nigeria’s acceptance of the October 2002\r\ndecision of the Court on the land and maritime\r\nboundaries dispute with Cameroon, the implementation\r\nof which has proceeded under the aegis of the Nigeria-\r\nCameroon Mixed Commission.\r\nNigeria commends the Court for upholding the\r\nrule of law within the United Nations system, as well\r\nas its positive contribution to international peace and\r\nsecurity through its invaluable adjudicative role in\r\nresolving varied disputes among States. We also note\r\nthe advisory opinion offered by Court in July 2004 on\r\nthe question of the legal consequences of the\r\nconstruction of a wall in the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritory.\r\nNigeria welcomes the increased confidence that\r\nStates continue to show in the Court’s ability to resolve\r\ntheir disputes. This is evident in the 26 cases referred\r\nto the Court from all over the world during the period\r\nunder review, out of which 20 are now pending. In\r\naddition to enlarging the number of ad hoc judges\r\nchosen by States parties to handle the growing number\r\nof cases referred to the Court, it is gratifying to note\r\nthe continuation of the Court’s periodic reviews of its\r\nprocedures and working methods, including added\r\nmeasures adopted in July this year, aimed at enhancing\r\nthe internal functioning of the Court, together with\r\npractical steps taken to increase the number of\r\ndecisions rendered each year by shortening the period\r\nbetween the closure of written proceedings and the\r\nopening of oral proceedings.\r\nOur delegation further commends the adoption of\r\namended Practice Direction V and new Practice\r\nDirections X, XI and XII, which we consider as\r\nsignificant steps towards increasing the effectiveness\r\nand efficiency of the Court in light of the growing\r\nnumber of cases being referred to the Court by States.\r\nWe urge the Court to continue fulfilling its role as the\r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations with\r\nutmost care and firmness. We believe that adequate\r\nfunding of the Court would enable it keep pace with\r\nthe advancement of modern technology, which it\r\nrequires for the discharge of its functions. In this\r\nregard, the pending request of the Court for a modest\r\nexpansion of its Computerization Division from one to\r\ntwo professional officers deserves favourable\r\nconsideration. This request needs to be considered in\r\ntandem with the Court’s extrabudgetary expenditures\r\noccasioned by the offer of its advisory opinion on the\r\nquestion of the legal consequences of the construction\r\nof a wall in the occupied Palestinian territory, as well\r\nas the measures taken by the Court to enhance the\r\nsecurity and safety of its staff and premises.\r\nWe note with appreciation the contributions made\r\nduring the period under review by Finland, Norway\r\nand Mexico to the Secretary-General’s Trust Fund to\r\nAssist States in the Settlement of Disputes through the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. We commend the\r\nSecretary-General for the review of existing procedures\r\ngoverning the eligibility rules for application for\r\nfinancial assistance by States which lack the necessary\r\nfinancial resources to cover expenses in connection\r\nwith either a dispute submitted to the Court by way of\r\na special agreement or in connection with the\r\nexecution of a judgment. A revision would no doubt\r\nassist in meeting the needs of all States wishing to call\r\nupon the Court to settle their disputes peacefully and\r\nwould encourage them to do so, thus fulfilling the\r\nobjective that informed the establishment of the Fund.\r\nFinally, Mr. President, let me reaffirm Nigeria’s\r\ncommitment to the provisions of the Statute of the\r\nCourt, recognizing that this will enhance respect for\r\ninternational law.\r\nMr. Yáñez-Barnuevo (Spain) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAllow me to begin by conveying the most heartfelt\r\ncondolences of the Spanish delegation to the delegation\r\nof the United Arab Emirates on the occasion of the\r\nrecent death of His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan\r\nAl-Nahyan, head of State of the United Arab Emirates.\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.49\r\nAt the beginning of this session of the General\r\nAssembly, the Secretary-General highlighted the value\r\nof the rule of law both within States and in\r\ninternational relations. Just a few days ago the Security\r\nCouncil held a debate on the same issue from the\r\nstandpoint of the role of the United Nations in post-\r\nconflict peace-building. As we are now considering in\r\nthe Assembly the report of the International Court of\r\nJustice (ICJ), and having heard the very useful\r\nstatement by Judge Shi Jiuyong, its President, this\r\nopportunity is particularly timely because the Court is\r\na key body and a principle organ of the United Nations\r\nin ensuring that the rule of law genuinely prevails in\r\ninternational relations in an increasingly complex\r\nworld.\r\nThe ICJ report reveals — and this is something\r\nwe note with satisfaction — that States have been\r\nreferring many cases to the ICJ in recent years. This is\r\na good sign, not only in terms of the quantity, when\r\ncompared to the not-too-distant past, but also in terms\r\nof the clearly increasing acceptance of the rule of law\r\nby States of all regions of the world, both developed\r\nand developing, in the context of international disputes\r\nof a wide-ranging nature.\r\nSecondly, we need to stress the intensive judicial\r\nwork that the Court has been carrying out in the period\r\ncovered by the report, with its various oral proceedings\r\nthat have led to three rulings and the issuance of an\r\nAdvisory Opinion, together with a large number of\r\nfindings in pending cases.\r\nThese facts in themselves indicate that the Court\r\nis becoming a very active body, and it is foreseeable\r\nthat its activities will further expand over the next few\r\nyears, given the number of cases that still have to be\r\nresolved and those that are steadily being added to its\r\nlist. For this reason, we welcome the fact that the Court\r\nhas undertaken a review of its working methods, a fact\r\nthat has already led to a number of measures to\r\nimprove its internal functioning and, as far as possible,\r\nexpedite proceedings.\r\nThis intensive work on the part of the Court is\r\ndue to the fact that the Court embodies the principle of\r\nthe equality of States before international law. As a\r\nthird impartial party, it acts as the guardian of\r\ninternational law, thus safeguarding the maintenance of\r\na coherent international legal order, as described by the\r\nPresident of the Court himself.\r\nIn applying international law, the Court is helping\r\nto develop it and to spell out its functions, as may be\r\nnoted, for example, in the declaration of the Court in\r\n2001 concerning the obligatory nature of the findings\r\nthat establish provisional measures. Compliance by\r\nStates with such provisional measures is undoubtedly a\r\nkey factor in peace.\r\nWe should also underscore the importance of the\r\nadvisory function of the Court, as can be seen from the\r\nOpinion issued in July 2004 on the legal consequences\r\nof the construction of a wall in the occupied\r\nPalestinian territory, an opinion requested by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. This Advisory Opinion bears\r\nwitness to the fact that international law, applied to a\r\nspecific issue, may play a relevant role in addressing a\r\nprolonged conflict situation, such as the one in the\r\nMiddle East, which affects the whole international\r\ncommunity and which demands a speedy resolution\r\nthat would be satisfactory to all parties in the interests\r\nof peace and justice.\r\nI have already said that it is foreseeable that in\r\nthe next few years the Court will have a very heavy\r\nworkload. This is something that we should not\r\noverlook, because, if we want it to be an efficient\r\njudicial organ in the service of the international\r\ncommunity, we must give an appropriate response to\r\nthe staffing and physical needs that this will generate.\r\nAccordingly, we cannot reject the modest proposals\r\nthat the Court has presented to the General Assembly\r\nin this regard, as happened, to some extent, last year.\r\nOne needs only to read the report to understand\r\nthat the activity of the secretariat of the Court is\r\ndependent on limited resources in a number of areas,\r\nand it would be appropriate to gradually increase those\r\nresources, in particular when it comes to the\r\napplication of modern information technologies.\r\nAs regards the Court’s budget for the next\r\nbiennium, my delegation believes that it would be\r\nincumbent upon us to support its proposals, so that it\r\ncan adequately carry out its valuable judicial function\r\nin the service of peace and in ensuring the rule of law\r\nin international relations.\r\nMr. Lobach (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): Mr. President, allow me first of all to express\r\ngratitude to the President of the International Court of\r\nJustice (ICJ), Judge Shi Jiuyong, for the very important\r\nreport on the work of the Court that was introduced in\r\nthe General Assembly today.\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.49\r\nThe Russian Federation has traditionally paid\r\ncontinuous attention to the work of the ICJ and has\r\nfully supported it. The Court is a unique international\r\nbody that plays the leading role in carrying out one of\r\nthe main objectives of the United Nations — namely,\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes between States. The\r\nRussian delegation greatly appreciates the work of the\r\nCourt, which has been successful in the discharge of its\r\nduties.\r\nIt is worth noting that in recent years the work of\r\nthe Court has been characterized by a steady increase\r\nin the number of issues referred to it by States for\r\nconsideration. There has also been an expansion in the\r\ntopics it deals with, as well as in the areas it covers.\r\nThis trend is very telling of a constantly growing\r\nauthority of the ICJ and its judgments. We believe that\r\nthis should be completed by a universal practice of\r\nconcise and unconditional implementation of\r\nobligations by States bound to them by these Court\r\nrulings. Unswerving fulfilment of this requirement,\r\nstemming from the United Nations Charter and the\r\nCourt’s Statute, are essential in order to ensure the\r\nprimacy of law in international affairs.\r\nAdvisory Opinions issued by the Court at the\r\nrequest of United Nations bodies and its specialized\r\nagencies on various legal issues are of utmost\r\nimportance. In our view, States must be extremely\r\ncautious in their use of this instrument, particularly\r\nwhen the application pertains to situations relating to a\r\ndispute between parties, one of which does not\r\nrecognize the jurisdiction of the Court as binding upon\r\nthem. The Court must bear this in mind when\r\nexercising its Advisory jurisdiction. We believe that its\r\nAdvisory Opinions must not hinder the search for\r\npolitical settlements.\r\nWe welcome the efforts of the leadership of the\r\nCourt to enhance the effectiveness of its work and to\r\nimprove its methods. We also welcome recent\r\nadditional measures taken to rationalize the internal\r\nfunctioning of the Court and to increase the number of\r\njudgments rendered annually.\r\nIn conclusion, the Russian delegation would like\r\nto express its gratification at the fact that issues\r\npertaining to the financing of the Court, the expansion\r\nof its composition and the improvement of the\r\ntechnical equipment provided to it have been addressed\r\nsuccessfully of late. We are confident that the as-yet-\r\nunresolved problems will be promptly addressed,\r\nthereby enabling the Court effectively to continue its\r\nwork.\r\nMr. Butagira (Uganda): Let me first express our\r\ncondolences to the United Arab Emirates upon the\r\nuntimely death of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan. May God\r\nrest his soul in eternal peace.\r\nAllow me to express our appreciation to President\r\nShi Jiuyong for his very articulate and most succinct\r\nintroduction of the report of the International Court of\r\nJustice, contained in document A/59/4. We further\r\ncongratulate him and his colleagues for the excellent\r\nwork they are carrying out in fulfilment of their\r\nmandate as judges of the principal judiciary organ of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nUganda recognizes the fundamental role played\r\nby the Court in the resolution of international disputes\r\nbetween States, as well as its consultative status with\r\nboth the General Assembly and the Security Council\r\non legal issues.\r\nUganda notes that the Court has a large number\r\nof cases pending before it; there are more than 20 on\r\nits docket. Needless to say, justice delayed is justice\r\ndenied. That notwithstanding, however, the Court has\r\nmade commendable progress, especially with regard to\r\nits recent Judgments.\r\nIt would be insensitive not to appreciate the\r\ndilemma faced by the Court when respondents embark\r\non measures that either stall the process or require the\r\nCourt to sideline its workload in order to deal more\r\nexpeditiously with provisional measures that have to be\r\ndecided upon urgently. However, given the nature of\r\nthe cases brought before the Court, that is to be\r\nexpected, and the Court has to find the proper\r\nequilibrium in its responses to the challenges raised.\r\nHence, I am happy to note the measures taken, inter\r\nalia, to rationalize the work of the Registry, make\r\ngreater use of information technology, improve its own\r\nworking methods and secure greater collaboration from\r\nthe States parties involved. The shortening and\r\nsimplifying of proceedings is a welcome development.\r\nSuch measures are bound to reap dividends for both the\r\nCourt and the parties in both the short and the long run.\r\nConversely, we urge parties to reduce, to the\r\nextent possible — without compromising their cases —\r\nthe number and volume of written pleadings as well as\r\nthe length of oral arguments.\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.49\r\nThe decisions rendered in all cases provide an\r\ninvaluable and indispensable tool to the international\r\nlegal regime. This vital function is further augmented\r\nby the Court’s publications, from which my\r\nGovernment has benefited, as, indeed, have many\r\nothers. States, legal entities, the media and academia\r\nhave also benefited tremendously from the Court’s web\r\nsite, which features the full texts of the Court’s\r\njudgments, advisory opinions and orders, including\r\nsummaries of previous cases.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate my\r\nGovernment’s commendation of the excellent services\r\nand direction provided by the Court despite the\r\nnumerous obstacles it faces given the diversity,\r\ncomplexity and volume of its work and the relatively\r\nlimited funding, resources and support staff available\r\nto it.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): May I take it\r\nthat it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude\r\nits consideration of agenda item 13?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On Monday\r\nmorning, 8 November 2004, in addition to the items\r\nalready scheduled for that meeting, the General\r\nAssembly, as the last item, will resume consideration\r\nof agenda item 56, Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional and other organizations, so as to\r\ntake action on draft resolutions A/59/L.5/Rev.2,\r\nA/59/L.11, A/59/L.14, and A/59/L.19, under sub-items\r\n(i), (j), (q) and (t), of agenda item 56.\r\nAlso, on Thursday afternoon, 18 November,\r\nfollowing the items already scheduled for that meeting,\r\nthe General Assembly will consider as the last item,\r\nagenda item 161 (Andean Zone of Peace).
