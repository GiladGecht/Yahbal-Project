(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hâmid Karzai, President of the\r\nTransitional Islamic State of Afghanistan\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nTransitional Islamic State of Afghanistan.\r\nMr. Hâmid Karzai, President of the Transitional\r\nIslamic State of Afghanistan, was escorted into\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Hâmid Karzai,\r\nPresident of the Transitional Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Karzai: Nelson Mandela once\r\ndescribed his countrys transition to democracy as a\r\nlong journey to freedom comprising many milestones,\r\neach a realization of new opportunities for him and his\r\nnation. We, the Afghan people, started our journey to\r\nstability and democracy almost three years ago. I am\r\ndelighted to report that, 18 days from today, our people\r\nwill go to the polls for the first time to elect their\r\nPresident, marking the most significant milestone in\r\nour journey.\r\nAs the presidential elections will mark the end of\r\nthe transitional period set forth in the historic Bonn\r\nAgreement, I would like to outline some of\r\nAfghanistans achievements over the past three years\r\nand discuss our challenges.\r\nMuch has changed in my country, but no change\r\nis more visible than the confidence of the Afghan\r\npeople in the future of our country. We have seen that\r\nconfidence in the return of more than 3.5 million\r\nrefugees who are now rebuilding their lives. We have\r\nseen that confidence in the enthusiasm of families who\r\nare sending their boys and girls to school, rebuilding\r\ntheir homes and setting up their businesses. And we\r\nhave seen that confidence in the enthusiasm of 10.5\r\nmillion Afghans who have registered to vote in the\r\nupcoming elections.\r\nEarlier this year, the Constitutional Loya Jirga\r\nadopted an enlightened Constitution establishing a\r\ndemocratic Islamic republic. It guarantees equal rights\r\nand equal protection for all citizens  men and\r\nwomen. The vision of the Constitutional Loya Jirga is\r\nbecoming a reality. Approximately 42 per cent of the\r\nregistered voters are women, and women will make up\r\nat least 25 per cent of our future parliament. Our\r\nConstitution also guarantees freedom of speech and\r\nfreedom of the press.\r\nDuring the past year, we enacted the election law,\r\nestablished the necessary mechanism to organize and\r\nmanage elections and completed voter registration, and\r\nwe are now preparing to hold presidential and\r\nparliamentary elections. Thanks to the cooperation of\r\nour two brotherly neighbours, Pakistan and Iran,\r\nhundreds of thousands of Afghans still living in those\r\ncountries will also participate in the election.\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nIn partnership with the international community,\r\nwe have intensified our efforts to rebuild our national\r\nsecurity institutions. Today, there are 15,000 national\r\narmy soldiers and nearly 30,000 national police\r\nofficers providing security to our citizens. We are\r\ngrateful to the thousands of International Security\r\nAssistance Force and coalition troops that are assisting\r\nour security forces. We have also taken steps towards\r\ndisarming, demobilizing and reintegrating private\r\nmilitias. Nearly all of the heavy weapons have been\r\ncollected from the city of Kabul, and thousands of\r\nformer combatants have been disarmed in various parts\r\nof the country.\r\nWe have continued the reconstruction of our\r\ncountry. At the Berlin conference this year, the\r\ninternational community renewed its commitment to\r\nrebuilding Afghanistan. The generous pledges that we\r\nreceived in Berlin will be committed to national\r\nreconstruction and development programmes that will\r\ncreate economic opportunities for our citizens and will\r\nfurther promote economic growth throughout the\r\nregion. Eradicating poverty and meeting the\r\neducational and health needs of our citizens will\r\ncontinue to remain among our top priorities. We will\r\ncontinue to focus on building our roads to re-establish\r\nAfghanistan as the land bridge for transcontinental\r\ntrade. Upon completion of Afghanistans ring road,\r\nevery major Central Asian capital will be less than 32\r\nhours from the Persian Gulf and the port of Karachi.\r\nWhile our achievements are significant, we\r\ncontinue to face challenges. Terrorism remains one of\r\nour main challenges. The remnants of terrorism\r\ncontinue to attack our citizens and to threaten our\r\nsecurity. As long as terrorism continues to exist in our\r\nregion, neither Afghanistan nor our neighbours nor,\r\nindeed, the rest of the world can be safe. Eliminating\r\nthe remnants of terrorism in Afghanistan and in the\r\nregion requires not only continued support from the\r\ninternational community, but also strong and sincere\r\ncommitment from other countries in the region. To stop\r\nthe movement of terrorists across borders, the countries\r\nin the region must cooperate closely.\r\nThe cultivation and trafficking of narcotics is\r\nanother major challenge to Afghanistan and to the rest\r\nof the world. Drug profits finance terrorism and\r\nundermine our efforts to build a healthy and legitimate\r\neconomy. Afghanistan is fully committed to\r\neliminating this menace. However, we cannot succeed\r\nwithout the strong partnership of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nPoverty remains another serious challenge. Even\r\nthough we have made considerable progress over the\r\npast three years, we are still one of the poorest\r\ncountries. We still have the second-highest infant and\r\nmaternal mortality rates in the world, and we have one\r\nof the highest illiteracy rates. Very few Afghans have\r\naccess to safe drinking water, and only 6 per cent of the\r\nAfghan population has reliable access to electricity.\r\nOur achievements have not come without a cost.\r\nDuring the elections for the Constitutional Loya Jirga,\r\nterrorists did everything to disrupt the process,\r\nincluding bombing an elementary school and killing\r\nmore than 20 children. During the registration for the\r\nelections, terrorists showed their desperation by\r\nintensifying their attacks. They bombed vehicles\r\ncarrying women registration workers, killed civilians\r\nwho carried registration cards and bombed religious\r\nschools, killing children.\r\nThose attacks have not stopped our people from\r\npassing one milestone after another. The valuable role\r\nof the international community has been crucial to our\r\nsuccess. Nations from different continents with\r\ndifferent cultures and religions have come together to\r\nhelp rebuild Afghanistan. That is a clear example of\r\ncooperation among civilizations. On behalf of the\r\nAfghan people, I thank all the nations that have\r\nsupported us with their troops and resources, especially\r\nthe United States of America, Japan, Germany, the\r\nUnited Kingdom, Canada, Italy, Spain, France and\r\nTurkey. We are most grateful to the United Nations for\r\nthe commitment and engagement of United Nations\r\nagencies and employees during the past three years. We\r\nespecially appreciate the personal commitment and\r\ndedication of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan;\r\nhis Deputy Special Representative, Mr. Jean Arnaud;\r\nand his Special Representative, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi,\r\nwhose wisdom and leadership have guided us\r\nthroughout the journey.\r\nAfghanistan is on the road to recovery from the\r\ndevastation of more than two decades of war. Much has\r\nbeen accomplished in the past three years. Yet\r\nestablishing a stable, democratic and prosperous\r\nAfghanistan requires sustained and collaborative\r\nefforts by the Afghans, by our neighbours and by the\r\ninternational community. We, the Afghan people, will\r\ndo our share. Working together for a stable and\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nprosperous Afghanistan not only is a good example of\r\nsuccessful international cooperation, but will also\r\ncontribute to regional prosperity and global security.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Hâmid Karzai, President of the Transitional\r\nIslamic State of Afghanistan, was escorted from\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Her Excellency Ms. Tarja Halonen,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Finland\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Finland.\r\nMs. Tarja Halonen, President of the Republic of\r\nFinland, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations Her Excellency Ms. Tarja Halonen,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Finland, and to invite her\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Halonen (Finland): In todays\r\nglobalized world, security and prosperity are\r\ninseparable. There can be no lasting peace in any part\r\nof the world when millions of people suffer every day\r\nfrom deprivation, poverty, armed conflicts and\r\nterrorism. There is no human dignity when even the\r\nmost basic human rights of millions of people are\r\nviolated every day. There is no equality as long as\r\nthere is discrimination because of gender, race or\r\nbeliefs. There is no fairness when international and\r\ndomestic rules favour the rich and powerful and\r\noppress the poor and weak.\r\nWe, the family of nations, cannot remain on the\r\nsidelines. We need multilateral tools to meet the\r\nchallenges of a globalized world. We must develop and\r\nenhance our multilateral institutions. This applies\r\nespecially to the United Nations, whose position in\r\npromoting peace and development is unique.\r\nMember States have given the Security Council\r\nthe primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. The members of the\r\nSecurity Council  and especially its permanent\r\nmembers  must display a common will and\r\ncompromise on narrowly defined national interests.\r\nThe other nations must then show support for the\r\nSecurity Councils position and its decisions.\r\nBefore the war in Iraq, however, the international\r\ncommunity failed. Conflicting national interests\r\nprevailed over common will. There was not enough\r\ncommitment to act within the boundaries of Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. Some nations resorted to the use\r\nof force, which was not in accordance with\r\ninternational law.\r\nBut now we must turn our eyes and energies to\r\nthe future. We need to restore security and stability in\r\nIraq so that the building of democracy and prosperity\r\ncan begin in earnest. Finland is participating in the\r\ntraining of Iraqi police forces and we have decided to\r\ncontribute 1 million for security for staff members of\r\nthe United Nations system working in Iraq.\r\nThere is no sustainable alternative to\r\nmultilateralism. The international community must\r\nrecognize its collective responsibility. We must be able\r\nto intervene and prevent situations in which human\r\nrights are seriously violated.\r\nWe cannot afford to let the Darfur situation get\r\nout of hand. The United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity must be able to act in time, effectively and\r\nas long as needed. I thank the Secretary-General for his\r\npromise of action today.\r\nGlobalization could and should be a force for a\r\nbrighter future for all people. However, globalization\r\nas we experience it today falls far short of this promise\r\nand is ethically and politically unsustainable. To\r\nimplement the Millennium Declaration, we need to\r\nmake globalization more fair and attentive to peoples\r\nneeds and aspirations. This requires more coherence,\r\ncloser and better international cooperation and stronger\r\ndemocratic States that work for fairness at home and\r\nabroad.\r\nWe must act without delay in order to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. We have agreed on\r\nadditional resources, we have agreed on local\r\nownership and we have agreed on good governance.\r\nLet us deliver on these promises. The poor of the world\r\ncannot wait. We must make the 0.7 per cent target on\r\ndevelopment assistance a reality. We need to give\r\nopen-minded consideration to new and innovative\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nproposals for additional development funding,\r\nincluding international taxation.\r\nOne concrete indication of the desire to\r\nimplement the Millennium Declaration is the World\r\nCommission on the Social Dimension of Globalization.\r\nThe Commission has drafted numerous\r\nrecommendations which the United Nations system\r\nshould study before the review of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration next autumn. Tanzania and Finland will\r\npresent an initiative for this session of the General\r\nAssembly to deal with the Commissions\r\nrecommendations in the United Nations.\r\nThe United Nations has a key role today and\r\ntomorrow in promoting peace, security, economic\r\nprosperity, social welfare, human rights and the rule of\r\nlaw. Finland gives full support to the broad reform of\r\nthe United Nations that is now underway. The time is\r\nripe for a reform of the Security Council and the\r\nexpansion of its membership so that it better\r\ncorresponds to todays world. We also need to vitalize\r\nthe General Assembly and give the Economic and\r\nSocial Council the role envisaged in the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nI hope that when we meet here at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters a year from now, we can proudly note\r\nthat we have taken concrete steps towards a better\r\nworld. This is a responsibility that all of us share and I\r\nknow it requires a lot of work from all of us, but, dear\r\ncolleagues, let us do it.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of Finland for the statement she has just\r\nmade.\r\nMs. Tarja Halonen, President of the Republic of\r\nFinland, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President\r\nof the Republic of Mozambique\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill hear a statement by the President of the Republic\r\nof Mozambique.\r\nMr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President of the\r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Joaquim\r\nAlberto Chissano, President of the Republic of\r\nMozambique, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Chissano (Mozambique): Mr. President,\r\non behalf of the people and the Government of the\r\nRepublic of Mozambique, I would like to congratulate\r\nyou upon your election as President of the fifty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\r\nWe are delighted to see a distinguished son of Africa in\r\nthe stewardship of the highest organ of the United\r\nNations, which shows the confidence the world places\r\non your experience, wisdom and proven skills. Let me\r\nalso pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Julian Robert Hunte, Minister for\r\nExternal Affairs, International Trade and Civil Aviation\r\nof Saint Lucia, for successfully having presided over\r\none of the most productive sessions of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI wish to commend the Secretary-General for his\r\ncontinued devotion to the fundamental ideals of our\r\nOrganization, stressing the importance of\r\nmultilateralism, with a view to addressing the global\r\nchallenges before us, such as to eradicate poverty,\r\nhunger, pandemic diseases and illiteracy and to bring\r\nabout development, peace and stability.\r\nI speak before this Assembly at a time when\r\nMozambique is preparing to conduct its third multi-\r\nparty general elections, to be held on\r\n1 and 2 December 2004.\r\nHaving had the privilege of leading my country\r\nthrough many challenges, moving from war to peace,\r\nfrom destruction to reconstruction, from economic\r\ndecline to economic growth and development, I felt I\r\nshould allow other elected sons and daughters of\r\nMozambique the opportunity to take up the noble task\r\nof conducting the affairs of the nation, leading to\r\nfurther gains. This is therefore my very last attendance\r\nof a session of the General Assembly in my capacity as\r\nHead of State and Government.\r\nAfter the elections, I will join civil society and\r\ncontinue to make my humble contribution to the efforts\r\non the prevailing challenges still facing Mozambique,\r\nAfrica and the world, particularly in the areas of peace\r\nand the promotion of cultural, social and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nI have been attending sessions of the General\r\nAssembly since 1975, first in my capacity as Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and then as President of\r\nMozambique. I cherish every moment I have spent here\r\nat the United Nations, as part of the global efforts to\r\ncollectively find solutions to the problems around the\r\nworld. It has been, indeed, quite a rewarding\r\nexperience as, through our common resolve, we have\r\nbeen able to successfully advance the decolonization\r\nprocess in Africa and elsewhere, while engaging in the\r\nstruggle for peace and stability, poverty eradication and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAs I depart, allow me to share some reflections\r\non the role played by our universal Organization, the\r\nUnited Nations. Reaffirming the inalienable right of all\r\npeoples to self-determination and independence, in\r\naccordance with the principles and objectives set forth\r\nin the Charter of the United Nations and General\r\nAssembly resolution 1514 (XV), Mozambique attained\r\nits independence from colonial rule in 1975. Since\r\nthen, the country has been actively involved in the\r\nUnited Nations, has progressively improved its\r\nrelations with the Organization and its related bodies\r\nand has received strong, multidisciplinary support.\r\nSince then, 60 territories worldwide have become\r\ndecolonized, and millions of people today are able to\r\nexercise their right to self-determination.\r\nIt was on 16 September 1975 that, for the first\r\ntime, I had the privilege of addressing the General\r\nAssembly from this rostrum. I was then the Foreign\r\nMinister of my country, and I was expressing the\r\ngratitude of the people and the Government of\r\nMozambique for our admission as a Member of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWhen Mozambique was admitted, the United\r\nNations was composed of 144 Member States,\r\ncompared to 191 in 2004. That shows the extent of the\r\ngrowth of our Organization. In Africa, countries such\r\nas Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, South Africa and\r\nWestern Sahara were not yet independent or were\r\nunder apartheid domination. On other continents, the\r\nsituation was very similar.\r\nThe cold war was at its peak and the arms race\r\nwas a dominant feature of international politics. The\r\nfocus of the Non-Aligned Movement was on\r\nadvocating the interests of the developing countries, on\r\nraising international awareness of the dangers and risks\r\nof a nuclear confrontation and on the struggle for the\r\nestablishment of a new international economic order.\r\nIn those days of high political tensions, international\r\ndialogue was characterized by confrontation and\r\nintolerance. Today, international dialogue is more one\r\nof consultation and the search for consensus. The\r\nconstructive dialogue existing among Africa and the\r\nGroup of Eight, the European Union, the Association\r\nof Southeast Asian Nations, the South American\r\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR) and other regional\r\ngroupings are good examples of the prevailing new\r\ninternational political mood. Throughout this process,\r\nthe United Nations has played an important role.\r\nSoon after its independence, my country had to\r\nface the economic and social consequences stemming\r\nfrom its decision to close its border with Southern\r\nRhodesia, in compliance with a United Nations\r\nresolution that imposed sanctions on that neighbouring\r\nTerritory. It was a costly measure, but because it\r\nachieved its aim of ending the illegal regime in that\r\nTerritory, we feel proud to have taken that action.\r\nDuring that period, Mozambique enjoyed\r\nimportant support from the United Nations, particularly\r\nin the areas of health, education, rural development,\r\nadvocacy and emergency assistance for the victims of\r\nwar and natural disasters.\r\nFollowing many years of a destabilizing war, the\r\nGovernment and the Mozambique National Resistance\r\n(RENAMO), the former guerrilla group, signed the\r\nGeneral Peace Agreement on 4 October 1992. Soon\r\nafter the signing of the Agreement, the Security\r\nCouncil approved the establishment of the United\r\nNations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) to\r\nmonitor and verify its implementation.\r\nWe deeply appreciate the resolute and decisive\r\ninvolvement of the United Nations in the peace\r\nprocess, with the mobilization of human, material and\r\nfinancial resources. That strong support from the\r\ninternational community, combined with our peoples\r\nwill and determination to achieve peace, led to what\r\nmany regard as the first example of a successful United\r\nNations peacekeeping mission in Africa.\r\nDuring the last 12 years of peace, our country has\r\nbenefited from considerable support from the United\r\nNations and its various specialized bodies for\r\nreconstruction and development activities. That\r\nsupport has been critical for economic growth and the\r\ngradual improvement of the peoples living conditions.\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nIn 2000, unprecedented floods devastated\r\nMozambique. Those floods affected the central and\r\nsouthern parts of the country, causing heavy losses of\r\nhuman lives and infrastructure. Again, the response of\r\nthe United Nations and the international community to\r\nthe disaster was commendable. We take this\r\nopportunity to reiterate our gratitude to both the United\r\nNations and the international community in general for\r\ntheir unconditional support, without which the losses\r\ncould have been heavier.\r\nAs a result of sound economic and social policies\r\nand an enabling political environment, we have been\r\nable to record encouraging progress. The absolute\r\npoverty rate decreased from 69.5 per cent in 1997 to\r\n54.1 per cent in 2003. From 1997 to 2003, real average\r\ngross domestic product growth was 8 per cent.\r\nWe wish to recognize the critical role played by\r\nour development partners in assisting our country as it\r\nembarked on its steady progress. Their continued\r\nassistance will be critical to ensuring the sustainability\r\nand the irreversibility of the political, economic and\r\nsocial gains made so far.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic in Mozambique is a\r\ngrowing threat to sustainable development. Together\r\nwith malaria, tuberculosis and cholera, it is\r\njeopardizing decades of economic and social\r\ndevelopment. Without an aggressive response by the\r\nyear 2020, 20 per cent of the agricultural labour force\r\nin Mozambique will be lost to HIV/AIDS, and it is\r\nestimated that life expectancy will drop to 36 years by\r\n2010.\r\nWithin the framework of the African Union and\r\nits programmatic vision, the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development (NEPAD), Africa has been\r\nmaking important strides towards its renaissance and\r\nthe ownership of its destiny. In that endeavour, we have\r\nwitnessed a further strengthening of democracy on the\r\ncontinent. Moreover, Africa has been increasingly\r\ndischarging its responsibility with regard to the\r\nmaintenance of peace and stability on the continent.\r\nToday we are building self-confidence around\r\nAfrica and creating the necessary conditions for\r\nsustainable development. Through NEPAD we are\r\nraising the ownership spirit surrounding African\r\nleaders to bring about significant changes in Africas\r\ndevelopment. The recognition that success can only be\r\nachieved through partnership among all stakeholders is\r\na step forward in the establishment of public-private\r\npartnerships, regional integration and cooperation\r\namong different regions in Africa.\r\nWe would like to commend the decision of the\r\nSecretary-General to appoint an advisory panel on\r\ninternational support for NEPAD.\r\nDuring the last few years, we have witnessed\r\nglobal action towards the materialization of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals around the world. In\r\nthat endeavour, we have registered mixed results with\r\nencouraging developments on one side and visible\r\nsetbacks on the other.\r\nWe have seen a strong determination by\r\ndeveloping countries to achieve the Goals through\r\nrelevant domestic actions and policies. However,\r\ndespite such a clear commitment to improvement of the\r\nliving conditions of our respective peoples, our goals\r\nmay not be realized, due mainly to an unfavourable\r\ninternational environment, including insufficient flows\r\nof official development assistance and foreign direct\r\ninvestment.\r\nConsequently, we are failing in the creation of the\r\nnecessary conditions for the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. We will not be able to\r\nachieve the 3 per cent economic growth worldwide that\r\nis required for reducing poverty by half by 2015, while\r\nsub-Saharan Africa records a disappointing level of\r\neconomic growth.\r\nThe flow of financial resources for the most\r\nneeded regions is decreasing. Market access remains a\r\nchallenge for both developing and developed countries.\r\nPandemic diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, are\r\naggressively eroding the productive capacity of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nWe therefore need concerted global action to\r\neffectively address those challenges. The meeting of\r\nworld leaders for action against hunger and poverty\r\nheld at the United Nations yesterday was an\r\nencouraging renewal of the commitment of the\r\ninternational community to make the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals a reality. The final declaration that\r\nwas adopted should be the guide to our collective\r\naction against hunger and poverty.\r\nThe success of the ongoing reforms should be\r\nmeasured against an effective improvement of global\r\ngovernance and the strengthening of multilateralism,\r\nwith the General Assembly assuming a central role in\r\nthe conduct of global issues. The United Nations\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nshould pursue a multilateral approach that truly reflects\r\nthe current realities of the world, rather than entrench\r\nan anachronism inherited from the end of the Second\r\nWorld War.\r\nI urge you to continue the process of reform of\r\nour Organization, in order to have a Security Council\r\nthat is democratic, representative, equitable and\r\ntransparent. I urge you to continue with the agenda for\r\neconomic and social development.\r\nI feel honoured for having shared experiences\r\nwith Your Excellencies. I will keep and cherish\r\nmemories of the long and difficult, but gratifying\r\nmoments that we have spent together, building\r\nconsensus around vital issues for our Organization and,\r\nindeed, for our world. They were precious moments of\r\nlearning and of individual and collective enrichment.\r\nI express my profound gratitude to the United\r\nNations family for all the support they have given to\r\nme and to my country. I plead for the continuation of\r\nthat solidarity to Mozambique, with the aim of\r\neradicating poverty, hunger and endemic diseases.\r\nI leave you with a sense of having fulfilled my\r\nduty and given my humble contribution to the cause of\r\nliberation, peace and development of Mozambique,\r\nAfrica and the world as a whole.\r\nThe goal of complete decolonization has not yet\r\nbeen fulfilled, as the fate of 16 Non-Self-Governing\r\nTerritories has yet to be determined. We continue to\r\nlook for the day when the agenda of the General\r\nAssembly will contemplate neither colonies nor Non-\r\nSelf-Governing Territories.\r\nI look forward to a successful fifty-ninth session,\r\none in which we will focus on the priority actions for\r\nthe present year and for the years ahead. Whatever we\r\ndo, we must be able to give real hope to our nations\r\nand peoples  hope not just to live, but also to live\r\nwell and safely; hope not only to continue to be free,\r\nbut to be free in decency and dignity.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of Mozambique for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nMr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President of the\r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Blaise Compaore, President of\r\nBurkina Faso\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of Burkina\r\nFaso.\r\nMr. Blaise Compaore, President of Burkina Faso,\r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Blaise\r\nCompaore, President of Burkina Faso, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Compaore (spoke in French): The\r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly is of critical\r\nimportance to us, not only because of the urgent\r\nquestions on our agenda, but also because of the\r\ndistinct honour bestowed upon Africa through your\r\nsplendid election to the presidency of our venerable\r\nAssembly. Burkina Faso congratulates you warmly\r\nand, in its capacity as Vice-President of the Assembly,\r\npledges you its full and complete cooperation so that\r\nyou may successfully fulfil your tasks.\r\nI also wish to pay a tribute to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Julian Hunte, who effectively guided the\r\ndeliberations of the fifty-eighth session.\r\nOur Assembly is meeting at a time when the\r\ninternational community finds itself confronted with\r\ngrowing poverty in the countries of the South,\r\nterrorism and fratricidal wars. On the African\r\ncontinent, we can certainly welcome restored peace in\r\nAngola, Liberia and Sierra Leone, but Africa continues\r\nto be riven by many conflicts, particularly in Burundi,\r\nCôte dIvoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nand the Sudan. In Iraq, an uncontrollable situation is\r\ngradually plunging that country into chaos, while\r\ndialogue still seems to be impossible among the\r\nprotagonists in the Middle East. In the struggle against\r\nterrorism, we must humbly acknowledge that we are\r\nfar from having developed an appropriate and effective\r\nstrategy to eradicate that scourge. Killing and the\r\ndestruction of human life are on the rise in several\r\nregions of the world.\r\nAnd yet, people of good will and international\r\nassociations and organizations remain mobilized to\r\noffer solutions and to restore harmony. That is\r\nexemplified by the peace initiatives of the Southern\r\nAfrica Development Community in the Great Lakes\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nregion, of the African Union in Darfur, and of the\r\nAccra summit on the crisis in Côte dIvoire, which,\r\nunder the sponsorship of the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations, has revived a spark of hope for\r\nnational reconciliation in that country. The\r\nGovernment and the people of Burkina Faso reaffirm\r\ntheir support for the Linas-Marcoussis and Accra III\r\nAgreements. I wish to reiterate Burkina Fasos\r\ncommitment to joining any initiative aimed at\r\nconsolidating peace and stability on the continent.\r\nPeace and security are not the sole safeguards of\r\norder and global political stability. In its ability to\r\nsatisfy the basic needs of mankind, human security is\r\nanother important aspect thereof. Ever since the 1995\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen,\r\nthe international community has recognized that the\r\ngreatest challenge confronting humankind is that of\r\npoverty. Poverty compromises fundamental human\r\nrights, undermines the dignity of individuals and\r\nfamilies, and threatens the political, economic and\r\nsocial stability of States.\r\nOf what value is globalization if it ignores such\r\nessential concerns of peoples as economic progress,\r\nnutrition, health, education and employment? The\r\nespecially alarming situation in Africa must be recalled\r\nin this Assembly: a feeble growth rate, an ongoing\r\ndecline in per capita production, a slow increase in the\r\nliteracy and education rates, the ravages of hunger and\r\naffliction, endemic underemployment and a disturbing\r\nlag in science and technology.\r\nIn the face of such a state of affairs, African\r\nleaders have undertaken to show more leadership in the\r\nformulation of economic and social policies. The\r\nconvening of an African Union summit in\r\nOuagadougou on 8 and 9 September on employment\r\nand poverty alleviation in Africa was an example of\r\nthat growing awareness and new vision. In the course\r\nof that meeting, together with our development\r\npartners, we agreed that macroeconomic stability and\r\nsustained growth are necessary, but insufficient to\r\nreduce poverty. We therefore agreed, inter alia, to make\r\nemployment the centrepiece of our economic and\r\nsocial policies and to strengthen cooperation between\r\nthe regional economic communities in the areas of\r\nemployment, training and health care. The\r\nOuagadougou conference also decided to establish a\r\nfollow-up mechanism for decisions made at the\r\nnational, regional and continental levels.\r\nAfrica needs the effective assistance of the\r\ninternational community to enhance the quality of its\r\neconomic choices in order to improve the living\r\nconditions of its peoples. From this rostrum, I therefore\r\ncall on our development partners to act along three\r\nprincipal vectors. First, they must respect the\r\ncommitments undertaken at various forums to increase\r\nofficial development assistance and to provide\r\nsignificant debt relief. Secondly, they must establish\r\nrules to organize international trade on a more just and\r\nequitable basis. Thirdly, they must implement the\r\nrecommendations of the report of the World\r\nCommission on the Social Dimension of Globalization.\r\nLet us see to it that, in September 2005, as we convene\r\nthe United Nations high-level event on the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, relevant consideration and\r\nconcrete actions will already have been undertaken to\r\nthat end.\r\nFor the francophone community, the themes of\r\nsolidarity and sustainable development will be\r\nconsidered at the tenth conference of heads of State\r\nand Government, to be held in November in Burkina\r\nFaso.\r\nWe believe that the economic and social well-\r\nbeing to which our peoples aspire can be achieved\r\nwithin the framework of the rule of law. For its part,\r\nBurkina Faso has resolutely opted for democracy, and\r\nour determination has been fortified through free and\r\nopen electoral consultations for some 12 years now. We\r\nare fully resolved to embed democracy in our\r\ninstitutions and in our society, convinced as we are that\r\nit represents one path of hope for our country.\r\nThe United Nations must serve as a guide in the\r\nmanagement of international affairs. If it is to play that\r\nrole successfully and accomplish its task, it needs to be\r\ndeeply democratized. In other words, it must listen to\r\nthe majority of States and civil society organizations so\r\nas better to serve the common interest.\r\nAll signs point to the urgent need to reform the\r\nUnited Nations reform and to adapt it better than ever\r\nto the legitimate aspirations of nations. Every State,\r\nsmall or large, must assume its responsibility and be\r\naccountable for decisions taken for the common good.\r\nToday, were the Security Council to grow\r\ndemocratically and equitably in its representation of\r\nAfrica, Latin America and a large portion of Asia and\r\nEurope, it would enjoy greater political and moral\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nresources to meet the challenges of peace and\r\ndevelopment throughout the world.\r\nWithin the new United Nations that we so\r\nsincerely desire, the situation of the Republic of China\r\non Taiwan will finally be resolved fairly and\r\nacceptably. Reason dictates that that country, which\r\ncooperates with a large part of the international\r\ncommunity and makes a valuable contribution to\r\nuniversal civilization, should be rapidly integrated into\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nWith the valuable assistance of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, we have laid the foundations of a vast\r\nprogramme to reform our Organization. This\r\nconstruction must produce an edifice sufficiently solid\r\nto meet the countless challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nBurkina Faso for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Blaise Compaore, President of Burkina Faso,\r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of\r\nthe Republic of Madagascar\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Madagascar.\r\nMr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of the\r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Marc\r\nRavalomanana, President of the Republic of\r\nMadagascar, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of the\r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nPresident Ravalomanana (spoke in French):\r\nMore than ever, Africa is making headlines in the\r\ninternational community. Unfortunately, it is more\r\nabout crises, wars and problems of failing States that\r\nare attracting the worlds attention. Yet, some positive\r\naspects do exist.\r\nAfrican countries are resolutely taking their\r\ndestiny into their own hands. Good governance is no\r\nlonger an empty word. Democracies are developing\r\nand taking root. The fight against corruption is\r\nseriously under way. In many States on the continent,\r\nthere is a strong willingness for peace, security and\r\nstability, as well as better conditions for development.\r\nAfrican countries are deciding to unite in order to\r\nstrengthen their abilities. The African Union, the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development (NEPAD), the\r\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the\r\nSouthern African Economic Community, as well as\r\nother organizations, are becoming more and more\r\nefficient in resolving conflicts on the African\r\ncontinent. They are gradually gaining the respect of\r\ntheir partners from Europe, America and Asia.\r\nFor its part, Madagascar has successfully\r\nundertaken major reforms in order to ensure stable\r\ndemocracy and good governance, to establish a trustful\r\npolicy, to protect freedom of the press, to decentralize\r\nand evolve the administrations functions and\r\nresponsibilities and, lastly, to encourage international\r\ninvestment.\r\nMadagascar is seeking to play an active and\r\nefficient role in African and international\r\norganizations. We strongly support the strengthening of\r\nthe United Nations. We endorse the enlargement of the\r\nmembership of the Security Council in order to have a\r\nbetter balance between developed and developing\r\ncountries. It is high time for Africa to obtain a\r\npermanent seat, and this is also the case for Germany,\r\nBrazil, India and Japan, which are major contributors\r\nto the United Nations.\r\nMadagascar supports any effort to promote peace,\r\ndemocracy and the rule of law in Africa. We are\r\ndevoted to good governance, respect for human rights\r\nand the fight against terrorism in Madagascar and\r\nelsewhere in Africa. Recent examples attest to our firm\r\npolitical will, including Madagascars strong support\r\nfor the declaration for free elections, signed in Port\r\nLouis; its participation in the Moroni Agreement to re-\r\nestablish peace in the Comoros; and its signing of the\r\nagreement on human rights in Geneva.\r\nMadagascar has made great progress, which has\r\nbeen recognized by international institutions and the\r\nmajor Powers. Economic and political development has\r\nbecome a reality in our country. However, we are also\r\nthreatened by natural disasters, such as cyclones, as\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nwell as by the rise in oil prices, by the debt burden and\r\nby the lack of access to the markets of industrialized\r\ncountries. We are concerned by the slow\r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action\r\nadopted by the international community in 2001. We\r\nneed more foreign investment on our continent, both in\r\nthe public and private sector.\r\nI urge the Assembly to assume more\r\nresponsibility for a just and fair world and urge\r\nMembers to assume more responsibility for Africa.\r\nAfrica is ready to take its destiny into its own hands.\r\nWe are aware of our own responsibilities; however, we\r\nmust share them. The globalization of the economy\r\nmust go hand in hand with the globalization of\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nWe know of success stories relating to this kind\r\nof responsibility. Nevertheless, we have experienced\r\nsome cases, mainly in Africa, where the world has\r\nfailed in its responsibilities with resulting tragic\r\nrepercussions. Let us look at the African continent. Do\r\nnot forget the catastrophes of the past nor overlook the\r\ncatastrophes of the present. But, above all, consider the\r\npotential of our future. How will Africa look in 10 or\r\n20 years? Can we imagine this?\r\nAfrica can become a flourishing continent; it has\r\nenormous potential, which may be the source of\r\nprosperity for both Africans and the world. First of all,\r\nit has human potential. More than half of the African\r\npeople are under the age of 25. Todays young Africans\r\nare more open and more dynamic. They can narrow the\r\ngap between the past and the challenges of today. They\r\ndeserve a better education and professional training\r\nthat is suited to the needs of the market. Education-for-\r\nall programmes are vital. Investing in education is\r\nmore profitable than any other investment in poverty\r\nreduction. Africans destiny will depend on the\r\neducation of our young people.\r\nWomen in Madagascar are sometimes more\r\npersistent than men. They deserve more than their\r\ntraditional role within the family. Let us give them the\r\nchance to fulfil themselves, to enjoy the same rights as\r\nmen. All of us will benefit from their wisdom and\r\ndedication.\r\nI would now like to speak about agricultural\r\npotential. In Madagascar, more than half of the arable\r\nland is still unexploited. We can double or triple the\r\nproductivity rate. Let us help farmers to organize\r\nthemselves, to use better seeds and modern irrigation\r\nsystems and to obtain easier access to fertilizers. Let us\r\nset up infrastructures to develop markets. Let us\r\nsimplify land registration. Let us institute appropriate\r\nfinancial systems to encourage farmers to become\r\nentrepreneurs. Let us set up infrastructure and systems\r\nfor the processing of natural products. Let us build\r\nfood processing units and undertake related activities.\r\nLet us extend the food chain. Let us develop food\r\nprocessing networks in rural areas. The green\r\nrevolution that the Secretary-General spoke about\r\nrecently is not a dream.\r\nNext, I wish to speak about economic potential.\r\nDevelopment at the base, sustained by international\r\ninvestment, will generate high economic growth.\r\nMadagascar experienced economic growth of 9.6 per\r\ncent in 2003, and we hope to achieve the same\r\nperformance in 2004 and 2005. This is also possible\r\nfor other African countries. With such a high economic\r\ngrowth rate and more than 900 million consumers, the\r\nAfrican market will become increasingly worthwhile.\r\nAs to energy, we are all aware of the fact that the\r\nworld energy situation is critical and affects not just\r\nour economies but our ecology as well. What potential\r\nexists in Africa? Half of the African countries, like\r\nMadagascar, could produce an abundant supply of\r\nhydraulic energy; only 7 per cent of this potential is\r\nexploited; only 1 per cent of the worlds solar energy\r\ncomes from Africa. Let us conclude an agreement on\r\nenergy development in Africa. The potential lies in\r\nreforestation and in the Kyoto process.\r\nThen, there is ecological potential. In addition to\r\nthe energy and the climate, we can share the values of\r\nour nature with the world. Seventy per cent of\r\nMadagascars plants and fauna are endemic. At\r\npresent, we cannot truly assess the extent to which they\r\nwill be of benefit for medicine, as well as in other\r\nfields.\r\nWith all this potential, the development of Africa\r\nis in the interest of the great Powers. Their leaders\r\nshould know what African development can offer to\r\nworld prosperity, peace and security. Africa is a\r\ncontinent of the future. Africa can become a\r\nflourishing continent. Let us seek a common vision and\r\nfind new approaches to develop Africa.\r\nAfrica is ready for a new future. We Africans are\r\nready to resolve armed conflicts. We are ready to win\r\nthe war against poverty and other diseases. We are\r\nready for enhanced democracy and good governance.\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nWe are ready to work and cooperate closely for peace,\r\nstability and security. We are ready for an open market\r\nsystem. We are ready to strengthen our abilities. We are\r\nready for competition. We are ready for new\r\nleadership. We are ready for a new Africa.\r\nThat is why we ask for international rules that are\r\nacceptable to and accepted by all countries, be they\r\nlarge or small. We are asking for mutual respect. We\r\nare asking for closer cooperation.\r\nWe are asking for a comprehensive plan for the\r\ndevelopment of Africa. We are asking for a Marshall\r\nPlan for Africa: a plan that should be based on the\r\nNEPAD objectives; a plan that includes the Evian\r\nSummit objectives and measures, adopted by the\r\nGroup of Eight, but that goes even further; a plan that\r\nis more than just an emergency measure; an\r\nappropriate plan that promotes all the assets  the\r\nentire potential  of Africa. Let us act at once and\r\nwithout delay to implement it.\r\nLet us promote the potential of Africa. The\r\nimpact for African people and for the international\r\ncommunity will be enormous.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of Madagascar for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nMr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of the\r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mikhail Saakashvili, President of the\r\nRepublic of Georgia\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Georgia.\r\nMr. Mikhail Saakashvili, President of the\r\nRepublic of Georgia, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Mikhail\r\nSaakashvili, President of the Republic of Georgia, and\r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Saakashvili (spoke in English): It is\r\nmy pleasure and honour to represent my country today\r\nat the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly of\r\nthe United Nations. Let me begin by expressing my\r\ndeep appreciation for Mr. Julian Hunte, for the\r\nleadership and vision with which he conducted the last\r\nsession, and by congratulating Mr. Jean Ping on his\r\nassumption of the presidency of this session.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress my Governments deep gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General for his leadership, for his strong\r\ncommitment and hard work to make the United Nations\r\na more responsive and efficient body. The Government\r\nof Georgia reaffirms its strong support for the\r\nimportant work carried out around the world by this\r\ngreat institution and to all who serve it.\r\nThe beginning of the new millennium marks a\r\ngreat opportunity for the global community of nations\r\nthat make up the United Nations  a community\r\nwhose collective responsibility is to help strengthen\r\nthose institutions that promote and protect the\r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations, so that we can more effectively tackle the\r\nchallenges and the issues facing the world today and so\r\nthat together we can enhance our shared ability to\r\npromote peace, alleviate suffering, expand liberty and\r\nadvance human development with renewed wisdom\r\nand courage.\r\nThe belief that we must be able to adapt to great\r\nchange while remaining faithful to a set of core ideas\r\nand values is one that has special resonance in Georgia\r\ntoday, for few countries have witnessed greater\r\ntransformation in the past year  and fewer still have\r\ndone so with a clearer sense of purpose. In some\r\nrespects, Georgias revolution has made our small\r\nnation  willingly or unwillingly  a test case for the\r\nmodern challenges of democratic transition and\r\nperhaps for a revised formula for international relations\r\nin our increasingly interconnected and complex world.\r\nNearly a year has passed since our dramatic Rose\r\nRevolution graced the cover of newspapers and\r\ntelevision broadcasts around the world. This revolution\r\nhad at its core one simple demand: the creation of a\r\nstable, equitable and functional democracy. It gives me\r\ngreat pride, Mr. President, to inform you that we have\r\naccomplished that demand in ways that few abroad or\r\nat home ever imagined possible. And I am enormously\r\nproud of my people, whose courage, unity and\r\nsteadfast belief in a better future made our revolution\r\nand transformation possible. It is because of the\r\nGeorgian people that our experiment in democracy is a\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nsuccess, and because of their sacrifice and\r\ndetermination that we have achieved such impressive\r\nresults today.\r\nIn less than a year, we have proven the depth and\r\nbreadth of our commitment to democracy successfully\r\nby holding three sets of elections  presidential,\r\nparliamentary and regional  which were recognized\r\nby all observers as free and fair expressions of the\r\npublic will.\r\nWe have proven that we can take care of people\r\nsuch as the teachers of my country, who just a few days\r\nago received as much as 12 years in back pay from our\r\nGovernment. I was recently told by a local governor of\r\nhow one such teacher  who had not been paid since\r\nour independence  had just received her payment for\r\nall of those years. For all of those years, that brave\r\nwoman, who sacrificed her health and her livelihood\r\nfor the education of younger generations while\r\nsurviving on the meagre income from a small plot of\r\nland, watched as our corrupt officials  at her expense\r\nand that of her compatriots  were creating their own\r\nwealth, constructing huge mansions and filling their\r\nSwiss bank accounts. Finally she got her money back.\r\nShe also watched the corrupt officials chased away\r\nfrom power and held accountable under our legislation.\r\nNever again will loyal public servants have to\r\nharvest food from their gardens to make ends meet.\r\nNever again will they have to face a Government that\r\ndisrespects their dignity. Protecting people like that\r\nteacher is the reason why we have confronted\r\ncorruption in Georgia so vigorously, since corruption\r\nthreatened the very fabric of our society. By first going\r\nafter government officials who were corrupt and who\r\nenjoyed a near-untouchable status, and then seeking to\r\naddress the institutional aspects  the corruption that\r\nbasically gave rise to such government officials  we\r\nhave been able to reinstate the rule of law and create\r\nlasting change in the system.\r\nThat is why we conducted a radical downsizing\r\nof our security services, police and customs by up to 50\r\nper cent. Instead of poorly paid government\r\nofficials  civil servants who were not given any real\r\nsalaries and who were compelled to extort money from\r\ntheir fellow citizens  we have now introduced new\r\nsalaries that are sometimes 8 to 10 times greater than\r\nthose paid previously, as well as new rules of the game.\r\nWe have introduced new salaries that are\r\nsometimes eight to 10 times larger than those paid\r\npreviously, as well as new rules of the game. We have\r\nintroduced the first-ever civilian leadership in defence,\r\nsecurity and law-enforcement bodies. We have made\r\nthese painful choices because we know that, unless we\r\nchange the system itself, we cannot change the corrupt\r\nbehaviour of our State officials. It is those officials\r\nwho are responsible for the corrupt behaviour of\r\nbusinesses  not the businessmen themselves.\r\nIt is we who are responsible for failing to build a\r\nbetter future for our citizens. Winning this battle will\r\nmean that all citizens of my country will finally have a\r\nchance to live in a normal State  where merit rather\r\nthan money makes a difference, and where rules and\r\nlaws firmly and clearly govern peoples actions.\r\nAs I said earlier, in order to make such changes\r\npermanent and sustainable, we have raised salaries six,\r\neight or even tenfold for public servants, so that\r\nincentives are aligned, a fair system can flourish and\r\npeople can serve the State with dignity and honour.\r\nThat is why we have created a new tax system\r\nthat clarifies and simplifies both the payment and the\r\nadministration of taxes  creating the lowest-tax\r\nregime and the least complicated tax code in the\r\nregion, and eliminating institutional sources of\r\ncheating and corruption.\r\nTo hesitate or move cautiously at this critical\r\nstage would mean reneging on the promises we have\r\nmade and returning to business as usual in this part of\r\nthe world. Our people will not forgive any hesitation.\r\nI believe that we cannot refrain from initiating\r\nreforms and taking radical steps at this time if we truly\r\nwant to build a better future and forever change the\r\nrules of the game.\r\nBut Georgia today is a visibly different State than\r\nit was one year ago, with fewer games and new rules.\r\nThat is why those who fled Georgia throughout the past\r\ndecade  one of decay and crisis  are now starting\r\nto return to their homeland. They are putting their\r\nskills, talents, ideas and energy to work for their new\r\ncountry. There is a great deal of new energy and a new\r\noptimism, which we are happy to observe.\r\nThere is a renewed sense of hope and a renewed\r\nsense of purpose that speaks of unity and the unique\r\nstrength that comes with it. Georgias experiment in\r\ndemocracy is an ongoing success, not simply because I\r\ndeclare it or wish it, but, rather, because the people of\r\nGeorgia continue to embrace it. We are a nation that\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nhas a strong cultural heritage and identity, but that at\r\nthe same time celebrates and cherishes religious and\r\nethnic tolerance and religious freedom as part of that\r\nidentity and that heritage. We are a nation that believes\r\nin the sanctity of rule of law and a strong judicial\r\nsystem.\r\nOne thing is clear: democracy is thriving in our\r\npart of the world although many people thought it\r\nwould not be possible. That is because the principles of\r\ndemocratic governance are reflected in our national\r\nidentity and universal desire to be free.\r\nThe creation of a successful State depends on the\r\nability of its institutions to act maturely and\r\nresponsibly in the face of shared challenges. In this\r\nnew millennium, it is clear to all responsible nations\r\nthat one issue above all others unites us as we seek to\r\npromote lasting peace, security and prosperity: the\r\ncommon war on terrorism.\r\nAs a member of the global coalition that seeks to\r\neliminate the threat of terrorism, Georgia has made,\r\nand will continue to make, contributions wherever\r\npossible and wherever necessary. Our willingness to\r\nact responsibly and to contribute is evident today in\r\nKosovo and in Iraq  and soon will be in\r\nAfghanistan  all places to which we have sent our\r\nforces to serve alongside others in the pursuit of peace\r\nand freedom. For terrorism knows no greater enemy\r\nand no greater force than the one embodied in a free\r\nsociety.\r\nToday I am proud to announce Georgias newest\r\ncontribution to freedom: our offer to send fresh troops\r\nto Iraq to serve in the special protection force for the\r\nUnited Nations Mission in Iraq. In offering our\r\nservices to the United Nations Mission, we are hopeful\r\nthat our presence will foster lasting stability, prosperity\r\nand freedom for the Iraqi people  freedom worthy of\r\nall those who live in the region at large.\r\nIn the context of our cooperation with\r\ninternational anti-terrorist efforts, we especially value\r\nthe work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee of the\r\nSecurity Council, and we support the idea of\r\nstrengthening the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nAt this point, however, one could reasonably ask\r\nwhy such a small country  one of fewer than\r\n5 million people  is so out in front in its international\r\ncommitments to fighting terrorism and in contributing\r\nto that global cause. The answer is as painful as it is\r\nsimple. Simply put, Georgias commitments to fighting\r\nterrorism reflect our deep understanding of the\r\ndestruction that it can and has wrought in our own\r\ncountry and in our immediate neighbourhood. Georgia\r\nunderstands that we must do all we can to defeat\r\nterrorism.\r\nUnfortunately, Georgia today is still dealing with\r\nthe results of unresolved separatist conflicts in two\r\nparts of our country  Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\r\nThose conflicts have resulted in loss of life, the\r\ndestruction of property, and the forced exodus and\r\nethnic cleansing of 300,000 Georgians, thus creating a\r\nlarge population of internally displaced persons. Those\r\nconflicts cannot remain unresolved; we as a country\r\nwill never get used to the loss of control over that part\r\nof the territory or to the plight of those who have been\r\ndeprived of their livelihoods and their basic human\r\nrights.\r\nGeorgias new democracy is committed to\r\nresolving these conflicts, because no democracy can\r\nallow black holes to exist on its territory. Indeed, their\r\nexistence is fundamentally incompatible with progress,\r\ndevelopment and lasting stability. No democracy can\r\ntolerate them on its territory.\r\nToday, we are living in an era where the civilized\r\nnations of the world are united in a global war on\r\nterrorism, and, in that world, neither Georgia nor the\r\nrest of the international community can afford to look\r\nthe other way. Uncontrolled zones breed crime, drug\r\ntrafficking, arms trading and, most notably, terrorism.\r\nThe threats posed by violent separatism affect the\r\nsecurity not only of Georgia but of the entire Caucasus.\r\nIn places like Abkhazia, on the shores of the Black\r\nSea, these lawless zones have the potential to affect\r\nEuropean security as long as the situation there\r\nremains unresolved.\r\nThe lawless territories of Abkhazia and South\r\nOssetia are safe havens for mini-dictatorships, tightly\r\ncontrolled by elite groups that seek to profit from the\r\ncriminal status quo. It causes me pain to say that, in\r\nthese extremely closed societies  by and large cut off\r\nfrom the rest of the world  children grow up with\r\nguns in their hands instead of books. Their heads are\r\nfilled with hatred and intolerance, instead of respect for\r\ndifference and appreciation for cultural diversity.\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nWe must put an end to this cycle of destruction.\r\nWe must do more to eliminate the threats to peace and\r\nsecurity that have for too long retarded our\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAs we seek to find lasting solutions to these\r\nfrozen conflicts, once again Georgia can be\r\nconsidered a test case. Our success in that respect\r\nwould be your success, too. Here, I want to state in the\r\nclearest of terms that Georgia is fully committed to\r\nsolving these conflicts through solely peaceful means.\r\nGeorgia will not and cannot use violence to solve these\r\nconflicts, because no democracy can go to war against\r\nits own people.\r\nWhat all parts of Georgia need today is\r\ndevelopment, investment, security and lasting\r\neconomic growth. We will peacefully reincorporate\r\nSouth Ossetia and Abkhazia, so that all citizens of\r\nGeorgia can share in the fruits of our success.\r\nI believe that the most effective mechanism for\r\nestablishing Georgias unity is the creation of a strong\r\neconomy, where those who are not yet sure if they want\r\nto remain outside Georgia will be given real incentives\r\nand chances to benefit from a prosperous, tolerant and\r\nsuccessful State  a place where they and their\r\nchildren will be able to find jobs, earn stable incomes,\r\nand have access to new opportunities and investments.\r\nIn a strengthened economy, all of Georgias\r\ninhabitants will know that they live in a State that is\r\nable to care for and look after them  in sickness and\r\nin health. These are the qualities that an economically\r\nstrong and democratically vibrant Georgia will\r\nguarantee all its citizens. We must do everything\r\npossible to realize that vision if we want to build a\r\nunited future. As Georgia looks to the future, it does so\r\nwith a clear and understandable plan. Today, I would\r\nlike to introduce the idea of a new stage-by-stage\r\nsettlement plan, designed to speed the resolution of\r\nthese conflicts.\r\nStep one is to initiate confidence-building\r\nmeasures, so that new forms of trust are established\r\nthat create lasting human bonds between peoples.\r\nThose measures could include exchanges and links\r\nbetween various non-governmental organizations \r\nyouth group to youth group, student to student,\r\njournalist to journalist, athlete to athlete, health-care\r\nworker to health-care worker, mother to mother  so\r\nthat more citizens and more segments of our society\r\ncan learn to understand one another and to trust one\r\nanother.\r\nBuilding confidence means pursuing joint\r\neconomic projects that create wealth where today there\r\nis want and create profits where today there is poverty.\r\nBuilding confidence means restoring and guaranteeing\r\nthe right of internally displaced persons to return to\r\ntheir native homes.\r\nWe can and must build confidence between\r\npeoples, as the first precondition for peace. We can and\r\nmust do more to protect human rights through\r\ninternational police forces in places like Gali and\r\nthrough the existing Human Rights Office of the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\r\nlocated in Gali.\r\nTogether, we could move on to step two, which\r\nwould focus on specific measures aimed at achieving\r\ndemilitarization and a truly international format for a\r\npeacekeeping operation in our area, transforming the\r\ncurrent peacekeeping operation into a broad\r\ninternational operation, so that the people of those\r\nregions can live free from fear of uncontrolled militias,\r\nirregulars and violent gangs, which hold us all hostage\r\nto the status quo.\r\nThose steps will require monitoring, verification\r\nand transparency, so that we can achieve the necessary\r\nresults.\r\nThe third stage, step three, envisions a global\r\nsolution with global guarantees that would lead to the\r\nestablishment of the fullest and broadest form of\r\nautonomy  one that protects culture and language\r\nand guarantees self-governance, fiscal control and\r\nmeaningful representation and power-sharing at the\r\nnational government level. Most important, it would\r\nlead to an autonomy that empowers average people, so\r\nthat isolated elites no longer act as the sole decision\r\nmakers over peoples future.\r\nGeorgia greatly appreciates the support rendered\r\nby the Group of Friends and the Geneva process, as\r\nwell as the concepts and principles contained within\r\nthe Boden document, which should be transmitted to\r\nthe Abkhaz side.\r\nNow is the time to enhance those commitments;\r\nnow is the time for the international community to do\r\nmuch more. Simply put: the international community\r\ncan no longer afford to look the other way when gross\r\nviolations of human rights take place in separatist\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nenclaves, just as they can no longer afford to ignore the\r\nsecurity risks that emanate from those black holes and\r\nsmugglers safe havens.\r\nThe relevance of that point was brought to the\r\nattention of the world after terrorists seized a school of\r\ninnocent children in Beslan, surprising and shocking\r\nthe world with their brutality. The people of Georgia\r\nwere deeply shocked, and we of course condemn that\r\nbrutal act and express deep sympathy to the families of\r\nthe victims of that terrible tragedy, which sent\r\nshockwaves through every Georgian household.\r\nAs we know, the terrorists that seized the school\r\nare common enemies of Russia and Georgia alike. We\r\nhad seen such individuals  notorious for their acts of\r\ndestruction, violence and killing  when they\r\nunleashed the same kind of bloodshed in the name of\r\nAbkhaz separatism 10 or 11 years ago. Those terrible\r\nevents prove once again that we cannot afford to ignore\r\nthe dangerous linkages that exist between the\r\nseparatism on one side of the Caucasus mountains and\r\nthe violence on the other side.\r\nAll separatists sow the seeds of great instability,\r\nand lawless zones can be sanctuaries for criminals who\r\nconduct acts of terror. It is our moral obligation to put\r\nan end to the unilateral practice of reaching out to\r\nseparatists without the consent or knowledge of the\r\nauthorities of the central Government in Tbilisi. In\r\norder to defeat that evil, we must not allow double\r\nstandards to persist. I believe that we can work\r\ntogether with other countries in that respect.\r\nThe time has come for Georgia and Russia to\r\nenter a new stage of cooperation whose goal is to\r\ndefeat that common enemy. It is our moral obligation\r\nand profound responsibility to join forces more\r\nrobustly in that cause.\r\nI firmly agree with President Putin that we can\r\nnever negotiate with terrorists or cut deals with killers.\r\nBut we may  and we should  work with moderate\r\nelements who seek peace without violence.\r\nWe must reach out to every segment of society.\r\nWe must do away forever with the Basayevs of the\r\nworld, no matter what side of the border they terrorize,\r\nand reach out to ordinary, peace-loving people. All\r\nforms of violent separatism  whether in Tskhinvali,\r\nGrozny or Sukhumi  represent destabilizing factors\r\nfor Russia and Georgia alike.\r\nI am confident that, by working together more\r\nrobustly, we can make great progress in reducing that\r\nshared risk. I believe that there are a number of\r\nconcrete initiatives on which we can embark today that\r\nwill bring immediate results  initiatives that again\r\nconfirm Georgias status as a test case for the\r\npromotion of a foreign policy that leads us away from\r\nthe outdated politics of domination, advancing, instead,\r\nour shared interest and the great potential for regional\r\ncooperation.\r\nThat means finally coming to grips with the need\r\nto close outdated Russian military bases, left over from\r\nthe past and from a country that no longer exists.\r\nLet me be clear: while we appreciate any help in\r\nstrengthening our security structures so as to make us a\r\nmore responsible contributor to international peace and\r\nsecurity, Georgia is firm in its position that we will not\r\nhave any new foreign military bases on our territory.\r\nToday, Georgia needs bridges, not bases; roads,\r\nnot rockets. And we need cooperation, not competition,\r\nwhen it comes to eliminating sources of instability and\r\nterror.\r\nThe mechanics of the new relationship with\r\nRussia means pooling our resources and efforts to\r\ncreate a joint anti-terrorism centre to counter common\r\nthreats. It means expanding joint border patrols to the\r\nentire Russian-Georgian border, so that no area is left\r\nexposed. Thus the era of zero-sum thinking can be\r\nreplaced with policies that lead to a win-win situation.\r\nThat is my fundamental conviction.\r\nThose efforts will require greater sharing of\r\ninformation and intelligence, and a greater degree of\r\ntrust  all of which Georgia stands ready to provide.\r\nWhy? Because such actions serve the cause of peace;\r\nbecause they are part of what it means to remain a\r\nresponsible member of the international community of\r\nnations; and, finally, because we have no reasonable\r\nalternative: failure is not an option.\r\nIn order to replace the mistrust and\r\nmisperceptions that sometimes derail our progress,\r\nGeorgia today proposes the establishment of new\r\nbilateral bodies to deal with issues between us and\r\nRussia, in which bilateral issues and misgivings could\r\nbe regularly discussed and considered. We should\r\nbegin considering the establishment of such a body so\r\nthat our relations never again suffer from\r\nmisunderstanding or misinterpretation.\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nWe should, together, consider issues such as the\r\nprotection of the rights of Russian citizens now living\r\nin Georgia so that no inhabitant of Georgia ever feels\r\nforgotten or unprotected. At the same time, of course,\r\nsuch relations would be based on the principles of\r\ninternational law and mutual respect for each others\r\nindependence.\r\nAll this and more is necessary because there is\r\nnothing more important than serving the cause of\r\npeace. And I am confident and optimistic that my\r\ncolleague, President Putin, desires the very same for\r\nhis people. I believe that Georgia will remain a test\r\ncase in our part of the world in the near future as we\r\nbuild democracy and further advance cooperation.\r\nCooperation among the United States, the\r\nEuropean Union, Russia and the countries of the\r\nCaucasus must become the litmus test for this new\r\nrelationship. Whether it is the fight against terrorism or\r\nthe development of energy or of transit and trade lines,\r\nthe region must become a model of cooperation and\r\nstability that benefits everybody.\r\nWe are firmly on the path towards integrating into\r\nregional security structures that serve the stability and\r\nsecurity of everybody in the region. Georgia is\r\nbecoming an increasingly functional, performing State,\r\nafter being a failed State just one year ago. We now\r\nhave a budget that is three times bigger than it used to\r\nbe. Our structures are much more efficient than they\r\nused to be. Our people are more optimistic than they\r\nused to be. We could be a major part of those\r\nstructures, and we offer ourselves as a responsible\r\nmember of the local and international communities. I\r\nam sure that, by following that path, we can unlock the\r\ngreat potential of this crucial and great region for\r\npeace, prosperity and stability  a task I look forward\r\nto pursuing with all of Georgias friends and\r\nneighbours.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of Georgia for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Mikhail Saakashvili, President of the\r\nRepublic of Georgia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ivan Gaparovič, President of the\r\nSlovak Republic\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the Slovak\r\nRepublic.\r\nMr. Ivan Gaparovič, President of the Slovak\r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Ivan\r\nGaparovič, President of the Slovak Republic, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Gaparovič (spoke in Slovakian;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): Let me begin\r\nby congratulating you, Sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession. I am convinced that your work in that\r\nimportant post will ensure further progress towards the\r\nattainment of our common goals. I wish you the\r\ngreatest of success and pledge the full support of our\r\ndelegation. I should also like to take this opportunity to\r\nthank your predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Saint Lucia, for his excellent work\r\nand, above all, for his personal contribution to the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly.\r\nThis is the first time that the Slovak Republic has\r\nparticipated in the general debate of the General\r\nAssembly as a member of the European Union (EU).\r\nSlovakia fully endorses the position set out earlier by\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the\r\nNetherlands on behalf of the EU. I am convinced that\r\nthe enlarged EU will further strengthen its constructive\r\npartnership with the United Nations.\r\nThe international community is now facing\r\nchallenges and threats that were unknown when the\r\nCharter of the United Nations was drafted. The\r\nmultilateral mechanisms set out in the previous century\r\nhave proved to be less than adequate. Recent global\r\nevents  accompanied by an increase in new and\r\npotentially more dangerous and destructive threats \r\nhave clearly demonstrated that no country can cope\r\nwith security issues single-handedly, let alone tackle\r\nthem over the long term. There is now a greater need\r\nthan ever before for international solidarity, together\r\nwith a sense of responsibility on the part of all United\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nNations Member States for consolidating peace and\r\nstability.\r\nThe Slovak Republic is convinced that a\r\nmultilateral approach is the best response to emerging\r\nthreats, and that the role of the United Nations in\r\nmaintaining global security is irreplaceable. In\r\naddition, we agree with the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, that the United Nations can maintain\r\nsuch a status only if it is able to carry out its basic\r\nfunctions effectively, embark upon internal reform and\r\nadapt to current conditions. To that end, the only way\r\nforward involves strengthening the authority of United\r\nNations institutions by making their work and\r\ndecision-making mechanisms more efficient. That is\r\nwhy we have welcomed the establishment of the High-\r\nLevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. Its\r\nwork will undoubtedly rank among the most important\r\ncontributions made towards reform in the history of the\r\nUnited Nations. We believe that that team of eminent\r\npersonalities will provide a realistic definition of how\r\nthe United Nations can contribute to global security\r\nand development. Slovakia will help to turn those\r\nobjectives into reality.\r\nMr. Vohidov (Uzbekistan), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nWe perceive the issue of reforming the Security\r\nCouncil in the same light. Reform should involve not\r\nonly enlarging the Security Council, but also making\r\nits working methods and the implementation of its\r\ndecisions more efficient. The Slovak Republic\r\ncontinues to support the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil with both permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers, with the aim of ensuring a balanced regional\r\ndistribution of seats, including greater representation\r\nfor the Eastern European region.\r\nIn addition, I am confident that this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly will help to build a global security\r\nsystem by strengthening and consolidating the anti-\r\nterrorism coalition under the auspices of the United\r\nNations, along with the Counter-Terrorism Committee\r\nof the Security Council.\r\nContinuing terrorist attacks are leading to\r\nsignificant changes in the area of global security.\r\nTerrorists do not shy away from perpetrating the\r\ncruellest and most bestial of acts; nor  as the recent\r\nevents in Beslan have shown  do they hesitate to take\r\nthe lives of innocent children. Terrorism poses a threat\r\nto everyone; no one can be neutral or indifferent. It is\r\nnecessary that we be resolute and jointly mobilize our\r\nefforts in combating it.\r\nThe Governments of Member States must fight\r\nmore effectively against this inhuman phenomenon\r\nthrough mutual support, the implementation of\r\ninternational law and improved cooperation between\r\ninternational and regional organizations. The 12 United\r\nNations anti-terrorism conventions and protocols are of\r\nthe utmost importance in the fight against terrorism,\r\nand the Organization must continue to play a key role\r\nin bolstering legal instruments in that battle. The\r\nSlovak Republic supports the prompt approval of a\r\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism as a\r\nwhole, along with a convention aimed at averting acts\r\nof nuclear terrorism.\r\nMaintaining international peace and security has\r\nalways been one of the Slovakias main priorities. We\r\nhave long contributed military units, observers and\r\nequipment to United Nations peacekeeping missions.\r\nSince our accession to the United Nations, in January\r\n1993, we have participated in 14 Organization-led\r\nmissions, ranging from military observer missions to\r\nhumanitarian and demining operations to peacekeeping\r\nduties.\r\nSince the beginning of the 1990s, the Slovak\r\nRepublic has dedicated itself both militarily and\r\npolitically to the peace process in the Balkans.\r\nNonetheless, Slovakia has never abandoned its efforts\r\nto help bring reconciliation and humanitarian aid to\r\nother parts of the world. We have gained respect for\r\nour participation in United Nations peacekeeping\r\nmissions in Africa and the Middle East.\r\nSlovakia also contributes to the training of\r\npeacekeeping forces. In line with General Assembly\r\nresolutions, the Slovak Government sponsored a\r\nUnited Nations seminar held in the Slovak Republic\r\nlast May, which was attended by a wide range of\r\ndelegates from more than 70 Member States. The\r\nseminar discussed the conclusions of the Brahimi\r\nreport (A/55/305), which highlighted the importance of\r\nstandardized training for United Nations peacekeeping\r\nmissions.\r\nIn recent years, the number of attacks on United\r\nNations personnel has increased alarmingly. Slovakia\r\nis a signatory to the Convention on the Safety of\r\nUnited Nations and Associated Personnel and appeals\r\nto all those countries that have not yet done so to\r\nendorse that important international legal instrument,\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nwhich guarantees the protection of United Nations\r\nstaff.\r\nStabilizing the Western Balkans is a global\r\npriority and has a direct effect on the stability of\r\nEurope. For that reason, it is also one of Slovakias\r\nforeign policy priorities. We have fully supported the\r\nactivities of the United Nations to date in using its\r\nauthority effectively to help resolve the conflicts in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, in the Serbian-Montenegrin\r\nprovince of Kosovo and in the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia. Slovakias proactive approach\r\nin that regard was demonstrated by the political stance\r\nit adopted towards the resolution of those conflicts, as\r\nwell as its participation in peacekeeping missions: the\r\nStabilization Force for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the\r\nKosovo Force for the Province of Kosovo.\r\nWe believe that resolving the situation in the\r\nprovince of Kosovo is a prerequisite for the\r\nstabilization of the Western Balkans as a whole.\r\nKosovo still represents a potential source of regional\r\ninstability. That is why we attach great importance to\r\nnext years evaluation to be carried out as part of the\r\nKosovo Standards Implementation Plan. A favourable\r\nresult in that evaluation could launch a process under\r\nwhich the future status of the Serbian-Montenegrin\r\nprovince would be defined by the United Nations. We\r\nperceive the United Nations activities, including the\r\nUnited Nations Interim Administration Mission in\r\nKosovo, as being of great importance in the search for\r\na solution that is acceptable to all parties concerned, in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolution 1244\r\n(1999).\r\nThe Slovak Republic welcomed the transfer of\r\npower to a temporary, sovereign and independent\r\nGovernment in Iraq at the end of June. The Interim\r\nCouncil, which was recently established by the\r\nNational Conference, represents a significant step\r\nforward in preparing for the elections to be held in\r\nJanuary 2005.\r\nI call upon the Assembly to join us in our\r\nabsolute condemnation of all acts of violence\r\ncommitted in Iraq aimed at spreading chaos and\r\ninstability, whether by means of assassinations, the\r\ntaking of hostages or the intimidation of civilians and\r\npublic figures.\r\nWe welcome the determination of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to continue providing humanitarian aid and\r\nsupport for the political process in Iraq. We believe\r\nthat the United Nations must play a leading role in\r\nsupporting the Iraqi people and the Government in\r\ntheir efforts to rebuild their society.\r\nImproving the security situation in Iraq is an\r\nessential condition for building long-term stability,\r\ndemocracy, peace and prosperity in the country. A\r\nSlovak unit specialized in locating and destroying\r\nlandmines, weapons and ammunition is currently\r\nengaged in a humanitarian mission there. In addition,\r\nSlovakia has stepped up its participation by joining a\r\nprogramme for training Iraqi police officers.\r\nThe Slovak Republic supports and appreciates the\r\nefforts of the international community to establish\r\nsecurity and stability in Afghanistan. The International\r\nSecurity Assistance Force (ISAF) is playing a vital\r\nrole, demonstrating how essential international\r\ncooperation can be. The most pressing issues we\r\ncurrently face with regard to creating stability in\r\nAfghanistan are, first, the forthcoming elections and,\r\nsecondly, laying down the foundations of democracy.\r\nIn addition to those political processes, establishing\r\nfavourable conditions for economic development is\r\nalso essential for Afghanistans long-term stability. The\r\nSlovak Republic is contributing to such efforts through\r\nits participation in ISAF and its planned involvement\r\nin provincial reconstruction teams.\r\nThe Middle East peace process must continue in\r\naccordance with the road map set out by the Quartet\r\nand endorsed by the Security Council, which envisages\r\nthe establishment of two separate Israeli and\r\nPalestinian States in 2005. Both sides should fulfil\r\ntheir obligations stemming from that plan and previous\r\nUnited Nations resolutions. They should also rely upon\r\nthe international Quartet for help and good counsel\r\nwhen taking those steps.\r\nAs we are convinced that international peace,\r\nsecurity and development are closely linked, official\r\ndevelopment assistance and cooperation with\r\ndeveloping and transition countries are becoming an\r\nintegral part of Slovakias foreign policy. Slovakias\r\nEuropean Union membership and its growing\r\neconomic potential provide both an opportunity and the\r\nobligation to cooperate in the field of development.\r\nThis year, the Slovak Government has allocated 25\r\nmillion for development assistance. In 2005, that figure\r\nis set to rise to almost 30 million. As a new donor\r\ncountry, Slovakia must work to further improve and\r\nformalize its mechanisms for providing official\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\ndevelopment assistance. It is doing so with the support\r\nof the European Commission and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme.\r\nSevere humanitarian crises also pose a threat to\r\npeace and security in the modern world. Such crises are\r\nnot necessarily the result of armed conflicts alone, but\r\nthey sometimes have the potential to cause such\r\nconflicts. The international community has the means\r\nto intervene in humanitarian crises. With respect to the\r\ncurrent humanitarian and security crisis in the\r\nSudanese region of Darfur, I am convinced that the\r\ninternational community, in cooperation with the\r\nSudanese Government, will find a solution to the\r\nsituation through economic and financial assistance.\r\nThe Slovak Republic has provided humanitarian aid to\r\nthat region and supports the continuation of peaceful\r\nnegotiations towards resolving the humanitarian and\r\nsecurity crisis there.\r\nThe Slovak Republic is fully aware of the\r\nenormity of the tasks facing the United Nations in the\r\nfield of ensuring global peace and security. In that\r\nregard, I would like to highlight that Slovakia is a\r\ncandidate for a seat as a non-permanent member of the\r\nSecurity Council for the term 2006-2007 in the\r\nelections to be held at the next session of the General\r\nAssembly, in the fall of 2005. I can assure the\r\nAssembly that in every respect, the Slovak Republic is\r\nready to take on the responsibilities arising from\r\nmembership in that key organ of the United Nations.\r\nAs my countrys Head of State, I feel it is important to\r\nmake this personal pledge before the highly esteemed\r\nsession of the General Assembly. We want to use our\r\nmembership of the Security Council to intensify\r\ncooperation with Member States in all regions and to\r\nbe a dependable partner when seeking consensus in the\r\nresolution of complicated global policy issues.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to wish this years\r\nsession of the General Assembly the greatest of\r\nsuccess. May it reach conclusions that promote\r\ncooperation among Member States, international and\r\nregional organizations, and non-governmental\r\norganizations and associations  based, above all,\r\nupon the principle of multilateralism.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Slovak\r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ivan Gaparovič, President of the Slovak\r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, President\r\nof the Republic of Zambia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of\r\nZambia.\r\nMr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, President of the\r\nRepublic of Zambia, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Zambia, and to invite him\r\nto address the General Assembly.\r\nPresident Mwanawasa: I am deeply honoured to\r\nhave this opportunity to address the General Assembly\r\non behalf of the people of Zambia.\r\nI would like to begin by congratulating Mr. Ping\r\non his assumption of the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. As one of the 21\r\nVice-Presidents for the current session, Zambia pledges\r\nhim its support and cooperation. I would also like to\r\npay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Julian Robert Hunte\r\nof Saint Lucia, for the efficient manner with which he\r\npresided over the proceedings of the fifty-eighth\r\nsession. I wish to extend our sincere appreciation to\r\nSecretary-General Annan for his relentless dedication\r\nto the cause of international peace, security and\r\neconomic development.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly convenes\r\nat a time when vexing problems plague the world\r\ncommunity. Zambia believes that the key to addressing\r\na host of such difficult global issues as terrorism,\r\nHIV/AIDS and the humanitarian tragedy in Darfur is to\r\nfind multilateral solutions, often within the context of\r\nan effective United Nations. Indeed, that is what I\r\nwould call a multilateral imperative. With that in mind,\r\nZambia welcomes the report of the Secretary-General\r\non the work of the Organization.\r\nIt is also Zambias hope that this session will\r\nbuild on past achievements to advance the global\r\nagenda. Accordingly, Zambia supports the convening\r\nof the high-level plenary meeting next year in New\r\nYork on the Millennium Development Goals, to which\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nwe committed ourselves in 2000. We firmly believe\r\nthat all Member States have a collective responsibility\r\nto implement the commitments set forth in the\r\nDeclaration.\r\nMy delegation supports the ongoing reforms of\r\nthe United Nations. Zambia shares the concerns of\r\nother countries that this important process has not yet\r\nbeen completed. Zambia believes that the reforms\r\nshould address the concerns of developing countries. In\r\nthat regard, we look forward to the progress reports on\r\nthe reforms. Zambia appreciates the recent initiatives\r\nof the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\neighth session on the revitalization, reform and\r\nenhancement of the working methods of the General\r\nAssembly. My delegation stands ready to continue\r\nactively participating in the reform process during this\r\nsession. We commend the President and his\r\npredecessor for the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly as the highest deliberative and decision-\r\nmaking organ of the United Nations.\r\nRegarding the reform of the Security Council,\r\nZambia remains concerned about the lack of progress. I\r\ntherefore appeal to this Assembly to support the efforts\r\nof the Security Council to enhance its decision-making\r\nand liaison methods during this session.\r\nAs I stated at the outset, Zambia believes in\r\nmultilateralism, which continues to be an indispensable\r\ninstrument for achieving global consensus on\r\nimportant, life-saving issues. As a global community,\r\nwe face challenges that are transnational and\r\ninterconnected in nature. It is essential that we take\r\nadvantage of the immense problem-solving potential of\r\nmultilateralism. Unilateralism should have no place in\r\nthis global era. Zambia reaffirms its support for the\r\nUnited Nations initiatives in the fight against global\r\nterrorism and the proliferation of small arms and any\r\nform of weapon of mass destruction. We call upon the\r\ninternational community to take all necessary steps\r\nwithin the purview of the United Nations to combat the\r\nscourge of terrorism in all its manifestations. That\r\nscourge needs to be fought relentlessly, with total\r\ncommitment and vigour. Zambia also pledges to\r\ncontinue supporting the Counter-Terrorism Committee\r\nof the Security Council.\r\nMy delegation would like the United Nations and\r\nthe world community at large to assist Member States\r\nin building their capacity to fight international\r\nterrorism. And we want to express our heartfelt\r\nsympathy for the innocent victims of terrorism in\r\nRussia, here in New York and elsewhere.\r\nZambia expresses its profound dismay at the\r\ncontinued unrest in the Middle East and the impasse in\r\nthe Palestinian-Israeli peace process. We call on the\r\nparties to that longstanding conflict to allow for full\r\nimplementation of the Quartets road map. Zambia\r\nreiterates that the road map offers a viable solution to\r\nthe Middle East question. We endorse and support the\r\ninitiatives for a peaceful settlement of the Middle East\r\ncrisis. In the same vein, Zambia welcomes the adoption\r\nof Security Council Resolution 1546 (2004) on Iraq.\r\nWe fully realize that economic, social and\r\npolitical development is the primary responsibility of\r\neach individual country. We are pleased that the Group\r\nof Eight countries continue to support the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development (NEPAD), the\r\nprimary objective of which is eradicating the\r\nincreasing poverty on our continent and putting\r\nAfrican countries on the path of sustainable economic\r\ngrowth. We recognize that the new initiative is by\r\nAfricans and for Africans, but we cannot ignore the\r\nvital importance of assistance from the international\r\ncommunity through increased official development\r\nassistance.\r\nExternal debt has continued to consume a large\r\nproportion of the national incomes of developing\r\ncountries, especially the least developed countries\r\n(LDCs). The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)\r\nDebt Initiative was established to assist highly\r\nindebted poor countries to reduce external debt to\r\nsustainable levels. Admittedly, the HIPC Initiative does\r\nhelp reduce the effects of indebtedness. However, it\r\nhas some inherent problems which inhibit the full\r\nrealization of its benefits. The international community\r\nmust, therefore, continue exploring innovative\r\napproaches toward debt elimination. In that\r\nconnection, we applaud the efforts of President Lula of\r\nBrazil in his search for the appropriate financing\r\nparadigm for the eradication of poverty and hunger.\r\nAs we endeavour to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, we are very concerned with the\r\nplight of the LDCs, which constitute 70 per cent of the\r\nworlds population. These countries are likely to miss\r\nthe target we set of reducing by half the number of\r\npeople living in extreme poverty and hunger by 2015.\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nLet me briefly change direction and say a few\r\nwords about certain positive developments in my\r\ncountry, a place where freedom truly is on the march.\r\nAs you know the Programme of Action for the\r\nLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010\r\nwas adopted in Brussels in 2001. Since then, Zambia\r\nhas committed herself to serious economic reform,\r\nincluding privatization, trade liberalization, the\r\nadoption of poverty reduction strategies and the\r\ncreation of an environment conducive to both local and\r\nforeign investment. While we are doing our part, we\r\nexpect corresponding action from the international\r\ncommunity, as agreed upon in the Programme of\r\nAction. Without assistance, all of our efforts will be\r\nrendered futile. Our aim is to graduate one day soon\r\nfrom an LDC to a developing country.\r\nIn addition, I am proud to say that my\r\nadministration is based on the rule of law. For example,\r\nwe have embarked on an ambitious review of our\r\nconstitution in order to provide ourselves with a\r\ndocument that will stand the test of time. We call on\r\nour cooperating partners and well-wishers to support us\r\nin this important endeavour.\r\nThis year and next  2004 and 2005  are\r\nimportant years in the lives of our people. I call your\r\nattention to four important events that are taking place\r\nin our country during this period.\r\nFirst, on 24 October 2004, we shall celebrate the\r\nfortieth anniversary of our national independence.\r\nThen, in February 2005, Zambia will be hosting the\r\nThird African Conference on Peace Through Tourism,\r\nthe high point of which will be a ceremony honouring\r\nthe hundredth anniversary of the birth of former United\r\nNations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld, who\r\ndied tragically in a plane crash in Ndola, Zambia.\r\nAlso next year, my country will celebrate the\r\nhundredth anniversary of the founding of the town of\r\nLivingstone, the tourist capital of Zambia and home of\r\nVictoria Falls, also popularly known as the adventure\r\ncentre of Africa.\r\nIn addition, next year we will commemorate the\r\none hundred and fiftieth anniversary of Dr. David\r\nLivingstones first glimpse of Victoria Falls, the\r\nworlds largest curtain of falling water, which we call\r\nMosi-O-Tunya, or the smoke that thunders.\r\nIt is my honour to invite your Excellencies, and\r\nthrough you all, all your citizens to come to Zambia\r\nand participate in these events.\r\nZambia also welcomes peace initiatives at\r\nregional, continental and global levels aimed at ending\r\nconflicts and wars in various parts of the world. It is\r\nfor this reason that Zambia has continued its active\r\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping missions.\r\nWith peace prevailing in Angola, that country is\r\nnow faced with the challenge of post-conflict\r\nreconstruction. Zambia calls on the international\r\ncommunity to double its assistance to Angola to help\r\ntackle the humanitarian situations such as the removal\r\nof landmines and the settlement and reintegration of\r\nformer combatants and refugees. I am pleased to report\r\nthat on 15 June 2004, Zambia and Angola witnessed\r\nthe repatriation of some 363 Angolan refugees in\r\nnorth-western Zambia, under the auspices of the Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees voluntary repatriation programme. This was\r\na good start to the programme, but more international\r\nsupport is needed.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to reiterate the imperative\r\nof finding multilateral solutions to the problems that\r\nconfront us. In our interdependent world, all of the\r\nproblems and challenges that we face can only be\r\naddressed through the concerted multilateral efforts of\r\nthe international community.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Zambia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, President of the\r\nRepublic of Zambia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Majesty Mohammed VI, King of\r\nMorocco\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the King of Morocco.\r\nHis Majesty Mohammed VI, King of Morocco,\r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in English): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Majesty King\r\nMohammed VI of Morocco, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nKing Mohammed VI (spoke in Arabic): I would\r\nlike to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession. This election is a tribute to Africa and to the\r\nbrotherly State of Gabon. I am sure that you will carry\r\non the commendable work initiated by your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, with a view to\r\nrevitalizing the role played by the United Nations and\r\nto enhancing its prestige.\r\nI should also like to pay tribute to Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, the Secretary-General, for his untiring efforts\r\nto achieve the objectives of our Organization. I want to\r\nassure him, once again, of our trust in him and of our\r\nfull support.\r\nThe world today is faced with major risks and\r\nperils of such magnitude that a renewed multilateral\r\nsystem is required. In that regard, we must ask\r\nourselves if the United Nations system, in its present\r\nform, is capable of providing effective solutions to the\r\nnumerous problems that are disrupting the international\r\norder.\r\nThe end of the cold war, along with progress in\r\nscience and technology and the opening of markets,\r\nshould have led to greater security and prosperity, but,\r\ninstead, the world is still encountering distressing\r\nconflicts, which cause considerable human and\r\nmaterial loss, to the detriment of development. Human\r\nvalues and ideals are on the decline, while fanaticism,\r\nextremism and terrorism are on the rise. The gap\r\nbetween a rich North and a poor South is widening.\r\nIt is Africa that suffers the most from the\r\nscourges of poverty, hunger, desertification and deadly\r\nepidemics, in addition to the problems of illegal\r\nimmigration, refugees and forced displacement. The\r\ncountries of the South cannot effectively cope with\r\nthese scourges on their own without successful\r\nregional and international coordination, as well as\r\neffective support for local development efforts.\r\nThese problems, and their pernicious impact,\r\nwhich is compounded by ethnic strife as well as by\r\nregional tensions and conflicts, not only cause terrible\r\nsuffering but also hamper progress, development,\r\nregional integration and the transition towards\r\ndemocracy. The international community is therefore\r\ncalled upon to pool its efforts so that the logic of\r\ndialogue and negotiation may prevail over that of\r\nforce, destruction and war. It must give fresh impetus\r\nto preventive diplomacy, at the regional and\r\ninternational levels, in order to preserve peace and\r\nsecurity on our continent.\r\nIn that regard, Morocco considers that the\r\nartificial dispute over the Sahara is, regrettably, still\r\nhindering the establishment of the Arab Maghreb\r\nUnion. I should like to reiterate my countrys readiness\r\nto cooperate in a sincere and determined way with the\r\nUnited Nations and all the parties concerned in order to\r\nachieve, within the framework of international legality,\r\na final, negotiated political solution that would\r\nguarantee the sovereignty, national unity and territorial\r\nintegrity of the Kingdom of Morocco, and enable the\r\ninhabitants of its southern provinces to manage their\r\nregional affairs by themselves, in a democratic, stable\r\nenvironment conducive to integrated development.\r\nSuch a solution would spare the area the risk of\r\nbecoming a hotbed of tension. It would also foster\r\nMaghreb integration and enable the region fully to play\r\nits role in the Mediterranean and in its relations with\r\nAfrican countries of the Sahel, thereby sparing the\r\nwhole of north-west Africa the risk of Balkanization\r\nand the threats of international terrorism.\r\nAs an active member of the African family and of\r\nthe international community, the Kingdom of Morocco\r\nis keen to continue cooperating with the United\r\nNations and the world community to settle disputes\r\nthrough peaceful means, volunteering to participate in\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions, as is currently\r\nthe case in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nin Côte dIvoire. Morocco is also eager to help bring\r\nabout reconciliation and the settlement of disputes\r\nthrough peaceful means, as illustrated by the mediation\r\nundertaken by my country to resolve the crisis in the\r\nMano River region.\r\nMorocco takes pride in contributing to African\r\nendeavours designed to meet the challenge of\r\nachieving peace, development, progress and good\r\ngovernance  the very objectives of the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development. Since the\r\naccomplishment of those ambitious goals exceeds the\r\ncapabilities of African countries and requires\r\nconsiderable resources, I urge the international\r\ncommunity to support this initiative and to find\r\ngenerous and effective solutions to the debt problem.\r\nMorocco has already taken steps in that direction.\r\nAs far as the Arab-Israeli conflict is concerned,\r\nmy country is as determined as ever to work with the\r\ninternational community to find a just, comprehensive\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nand lasting solution within the framework of\r\ninternational legality  a solution that guarantees\r\nIsraels withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories\r\nand the establishment of a viable, independent\r\nPalestinian State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,\r\nliving side by side, in peace and concord, with the\r\nState of Israel.\r\nI should like to stress that, as Chairman of the\r\nAl-Quds Committee, I am always ready to undertake\r\nwhatever initiatives are needed and to support\r\nmeaningful endeavours to restore peace to this region,\r\nwarning anew of the negative implications of the\r\nviolation of religious sanctities.\r\nMorocco hopes that no effort will be spared to\r\nhelp brotherly Iraq out of its current predicament and\r\nto support its Interim Government in its efforts to\r\nensure stability and security for Iraqis and to create the\r\nright conditions to initiate constructive dialogue and\r\norganize elections which will enable all components of\r\nthe Iraqi population to choose their institutions freely\r\nand peacefully.\r\nIn order to meet the challenges at this turning\r\npoint in history, the international community has no\r\nalternative but to revitalize the current multilateral\r\nsystem.\r\nAfter the First and Second World Wars, nations\r\nrealized that it was necessary to establish a global\r\nsystem to govern international relations, within the\r\nframework of law and legality. Setting up an\r\nalternative global system would not resolve the\r\nproblem of the fierce trade wars currently raging\r\nworldwide, nor the ethnic conflicts, ideological\r\nfanaticism and perils of terrorism, whether latent or\r\napparent. I am convinced that the United Nations,\r\nwhich has helped solve countless crises, is perfectly\r\ncapable of managing the current international situation\r\nin a peaceful and civilized way, by revitalizing the\r\nmultilateral system.\r\nSuch an objective, however, can be achieved only\r\nif the United Nations is provided with the kind of\r\nresources and means needed to meet the geo-strategic\r\nrequirements of the twenty-first century, and if its\r\nworking methods and its organs  including the\r\nSecurity Council  are reformed and invigorated. The\r\nUnited Nations system would then become an ideal\r\nforum for negotiation and interaction between cultures\r\nand religions. Furthermore, it would be effectively\r\ninstrumental in upholding human ideals, enhancing\r\nsecurity and stability and promoting sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMorocco, through its chairmanship of the Group\r\nof 77 and China and its participation in various\r\nregional and international events, including the Doha,\r\nMonterrey and Johannesburg conferences, has sought\r\nto contribute effectively to building this multilateral\r\nsystem, as a top priority on its diplomatic agenda. My\r\ncountry will continue to work for the implementation\r\nof the Millennium Goals, urging countries as well as\r\ninternational financial and trade institutions to honour\r\ntheir obligations. Morocco reaffirms its commitment to\r\nsupport the emergence of a new multilateral system\r\nbuilt on international legality, justice and equity and\r\ncooperation in social and economic relations, and\r\nbased on an efficient and dynamic United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nThis is the course of action to be taken to enhance\r\ntrust in the United Nations as the conscience of\r\nhumankind and the bedrock of a new world order,\r\nwhere the values of peace, global security, joint\r\ndevelopment, equality, tolerance, democracy and\r\nsolidarity prevail.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the King of Morocco for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nHis Majesty Mohammed VI, King of Morocco,\r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ricardo Lagos Escobar, President of\r\nthe Republic of Chile\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of\r\nChile.\r\nMr. Ricardo Lagos Escobar, President of the\r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ricardo Lagos Escobar,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Chile, and to invite him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nPresident Lagos Escobar (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nwish to express our satisfaction at seeing Mr. Ping\r\npreside over this fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly and we wish him a successful presidency.\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nEver since the signing of the Charter of San\r\nFrancisco, and before that during the time of the\r\nLeague of Nations, Chile has been firmly committed to\r\nthe international community, to multilateral\r\ncooperation and to the best values of peace, security,\r\ndevelopment and human rights which this Organization\r\nrepresents. Chile has been an active participant in the\r\ninternational system because we believe that\r\ngovernance at the global level is the logical extension\r\nof the institutional order that each State has achieved\r\nand can demonstrate in this global forum.\r\nWhile in the last century our main task was to\r\nestablish rules of coexistence and conduct for the\r\ninternational community, today, faced with the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century, that task, in our\r\nopinion, has become more urgent and ineluctable.\r\nWhat we have before us is a panorama of positive\r\nopportunities, on the one hand, and of complex threats,\r\non the other.\r\nFor countries such as ours, integration into the\r\nglobal community creates opportunities which a closed\r\nsociety would preclude. We see integration into the\r\nglobal community as providing possibilities for growth\r\nand for creating space for our efforts, and we feel that\r\nthis is the inescapable destiny of all of us. Countries\r\nneed freedom, peace, security and respect for\r\ninternational law; based on scrupulous respect for\r\ntreaties, we need to work towards the building of a\r\nshared global order.\r\nStability can be achieved only through\r\ngovernance under which all interests are represented.\r\nThus, voices are being raised in various countries in\r\norder to state the obvious: no one can shape the world\r\nthat is emerging except through agreements and\r\nnegotiations. The complexity of the world emerging\r\nbefore our eyes is too great to be handled in a\r\ncentralized or unipolar manner.\r\nOf course, little will be achieved if, at the same\r\ntime, each country does not put its own house in order.\r\nWithout justice, solidarity and respect for human\r\nrights, there can be no stable or genuinely beneficial\r\ngovernance in our own societies in the medium term. I\r\ntherefore believe that it is the responsibility of each of\r\nour societies to apply the principles of the United\r\nNations and to make them realities. We have an ethical\r\nduty to be efficient and effective in the attainment of\r\nthose goals and ideals.\r\nIt is clear, however, that globalization also\r\nincludes negative aspects that can affect us all. Today,\r\nwe are afflicted by such public evils as terrorism and\r\norganized crime; illicit trafficking in persons, arms and\r\ndrugs; and the money-laundering associated with those\r\nactivities.\r\nNothing is more counter to our principles than\r\nterrorism, a virtual dark force of globalization.\r\nAccordingly, here in the United Nations, Chile has\r\ncontributed through its efforts in chairing both the\r\nAl Qaeda/Taliban Security Council sanctions\r\nCommittee and the Counter-Terrorism Committee, key\r\ninstruments of the international community for waging\r\nthis combat. Globalization also has negative spill-over\r\neffects on the environment and exacerbates the\r\nmarginalization of millions of people in societies or\r\neven continents who are unable to achieve integration\r\ninto the global economy and global society.\r\nFaced with that reality of light and shadow,\r\ncountries like Chile have a stake in helping to improve\r\nthe positive aspects of globalization and to eliminate\r\nits negative aspects. But how do we turn those aims\r\ninto reality? In our view, the best way to guide the\r\nagenda of globalization is through multilateralism. It is\r\nin the strengthening of multilateralism that each\r\ncountry has a stake and a national task to fulfil.\r\nAs a non-permanent member of the Security\r\nCouncil, Chile has assumed its responsibility to the\r\nglobal community and has sought to act consistently\r\nwith our values and convictions. Last year, with regard\r\nto Iraq, we said that only the United Nations could give\r\nthe necessary legitimacy for the use of force and for\r\naddressing in an effective and unified manner the\r\nthreats to peace arising from that country. For that\r\nreason, and in order to be consistent with our\r\ncommitment to multilateralism, we said yes to the\r\nUnited Nations when the Security Council requested\r\nthe presence of a multinational interim force in Haiti.\r\nWe reacted in solidarity by dispatching to Haiti, in less\r\nthan 72 hours, a military force and humanitarian\r\nassistance.\r\nWe have shown that our region is capable of\r\nassuming the responsibilities required to ensure\r\ninternational peace and security. Not since the period\r\nof our national independence have forces from\r\ndifferent Latin American countries acted collectively\r\nand independently of the great Powers in a mission to\r\nmaintain peace in one of our countries. Today in Haiti,\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nthe troops of a number of Latin American countries,\r\nsupplemented by the joint Spanish/Moroccan force, are\r\nunder the command of a Brazilian general and the\r\nrepresentative of the Secretary-General is a Chilean.\r\nIf we wish to strengthen multilateralism, reform\r\nof the United Nations is becoming increasingly\r\nnecessary. Its ideals and founding purposes remain\r\nvalid, but, as a number of speakers have noted here, the\r\npower structure upon which the Organization was built\r\nat its inception corresponds to a world that is very\r\ndifferent from todays world. Not only do we need to\r\nexpand the Security Council to make it more\r\ndemocratic; comprehensive reform of the Organization\r\nis also needed. In addition, the United Nations needs\r\nspecialization, not a proliferation of similar\r\ninstitutions. It needs greater accountability and a more\r\ntransparent system of recruitment. It needs to derive\r\nthe maximum benefit from every last cent that it\r\nspends. Many of our States are making those or similar\r\nchanges in their own public systems. The United\r\nNations can be better than we can in that area. It is a\r\nchallenge for the Organization and for each of our\r\nStates.\r\nI had the opportunity to exchange ideas with\r\nsome members of the High-Level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change. That is why I am convinced\r\nthat the Panel will offer to the Secretary-General\r\nrecommendations aimed at strengthening two key\r\nareas: first, generate a political commitment that\r\nreaffirms the values of the Charter of the United\r\nNations; and, secondly, strengthen the system so that it\r\ncan face the challenges and opportunities of a world\r\nthat is more global than it was 60 years ago.\r\nThe world requires a larger and better United\r\nNations. We have unacceptable humanitarian crises,\r\nsuch as that in Darfur, Sudan; a steady deterioration in\r\nthe outlook for peace in the Middle East; and terrorist\r\nattacks, such as those in Beslan, Russia, and in front of\r\nthe Australian Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia.\r\nIn the Security Council, Chile supported the\r\ntransfer of national sovereignty to the people of Iraq,\r\nand we hope to see the elections scheduled for next\r\nJanuary. In the case of Afghanistan, United Nations\r\nelectoral assistance has been essential in the\r\npreparations for the elections scheduled for the\r\nbeginning of October.\r\nThe world to which we aspire will be better and\r\nreflect greater solidarity with the effective participation\r\nof citizens. In that spirit, we will host in Chile next\r\nyear the Third Ministerial Conference of the\r\nCommunity of Democracies.\r\nLikewise, we are convinced that globalization\r\nwill be better only if civil society is recognized as one\r\nof its principal actors. That consideration has been a\r\ndecisive factor in the Action against Hunger and\r\nPoverty, which we  together with the leaders of\r\nBrazil, France and Spain and the Secretary-General \r\nhave promoted to effectively contribute to the\r\nattainment of the Millennium Goals.\r\nYesterdays meeting presented us with a great\r\nchallenge: have specific answers within 12 months,\r\nbefore the next General Assembly session. Some of the\r\nactions proposed depend on governmental decisions;\r\nothers are the responsibility of multilateral\r\norganizations and civil society  particularly non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, the business community,\r\ntrade unions and universities. We say clearly: it is time\r\nto recognize that, in practical terms, the exclusive\r\nmonopoly of States or Governments in the international\r\nsphere has ended; everyone is called upon to\r\nparticipate.\r\nThe question is whether reform is possible. Why\r\nwould the powerful give up some of their power? Our\r\nmodest experience has shown us that one can negotiate\r\nfree trade, for example, with the worlds most\r\nindustrialized countries and reach agreements\r\nbeneficial to both sides. Today, trade agreements cover\r\ntwo thirds of our exports, more than half of which are\r\nalready free from tariffs. That has not been a simple\r\nmatter; it requires time, preparation and patience. And\r\nwhy not say this? It involves a degree of conflict with\r\nthe more developed countries. Trade agreements, in\r\nand of themselves, do not provide solutions for a set of\r\nissues that can be resolved only at the multilateral\r\nlevel.\r\nThat is why we need to successfully conclude the\r\nDoha round, because there, decisive issues are at stake\r\nthat we have not been able to resolve through bilateral\r\nnegotiation. There we must resolve the issue of anti-\r\ndumping, the situation of subsidized agricultural and\r\ntextile products, complex issues such as those related\r\nto intellectual property, and the question of how to deal\r\nwith pandemics by using generic or low-cost drugs.\r\nThose issues are multilateral in nature. We must\r\ntherefore deal with them multilaterally, and in doing so\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nwe must be strong  we, the countries that understand\r\nthat we are going to define more just trade rules.\r\nIt is in that area that common sense is of much\r\nmore help than dogmatism. One cannot ask others to\r\ngive up their fundamental interests, but neither can\r\nanyone hope complacently for unfair results. That is\r\nwhy integration into the global society is a stairway\r\nwith many steps. What is important is not to lose a\r\nsense of progress  progress towards trade that is free,\r\nbut fair; towards capital flows that are free, not\r\npredatory; towards cultural expansion, not destruction\r\nof what is local: our roots, what we are, our identities;\r\ntowards an exchange of ideas, not lockstep thinking \r\nin short, towards pluralism, so that we all can be better.\r\nI have tried to share with the Assembly the vision\r\nand the responsibilities of a country of the South  an\r\nopen country that is interdependent with the rest of the\r\nworld. Our modest experience has shown us that it is\r\nimperative to strengthen multilateralism as the only\r\napproach with the legitimacy necessary to ensure\r\ninclusive globalization that reflects solidarity  as has\r\nbeen said here, globalization with a human face.\r\nIn conclusion, todays world requires a larger, not\r\na smaller, United Nations and more, not less,\r\nmultilateralism. Our experience tells us that we can\r\nmake a reality of our shared dream  the dream that\r\nwas dreamt 60 years ago in San Francisco, but that\r\nnow obliges us to meet the challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century that is beginning.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Chile for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ricardo Lagos Escobar, President of the\r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Néstor Kirchner,\r\nPresident of the Argentine Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the President of the Argentine\r\nRepublic.\r\nMr. Néstor Kirchner, President of the Argentine\r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Néstor Kirchner, President\r\nof the Argentine Republic, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Kirchner (spoke in Spanish): I should\r\nlike at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-ninth session and to commend the outgoing\r\nPresident, Mr. Julian Hunte, for his work. I should also\r\nlike to express once again our appreciation for the\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to\r\npromote peace and multilateralism.\r\nWe have come from the South to renew our\r\nresolve to participate actively in United Nations efforts\r\nto promote peace, economic development and the\r\neradication of hunger and poverty. My country is\r\ngrateful for the endorsement of the Group of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States to occupy a seat on the\r\nSecurity Council for that regional Group as a non-\r\npermanent member during the period 2005-2006.\r\nThere, the Republic of Argentina will reaffirm its\r\nwillingness to promote consensus aimed at\r\nstrengthening international law and international peace\r\nand security. Those are values that we associate with\r\nrepresentative democracy, respect for human rights, a\r\nfair global trade system, a better distribution of the\r\nbenefits of globalization and the democratization of\r\ndecision-making in international organizations.\r\nThe United Nations must strengthen itself and\r\nmove forward in the establishment of valid rules and\r\nprocedures to guarantee international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe report of the High-Level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change could play a key role in this\r\narea. Its proposals should be properly discussed and\r\nagreed upon in order to implement concrete decisions\r\nthat reflect and meet the different perspectives and\r\ninterests of all Member States.\r\nWe are convinced that there is no acceptable\r\nalternative to multilateral action. Only through\r\ncollective debate and consensus could a majority of\r\ncountries ensure genuine action. The only legitimacy\r\nfor the use of force must come from the decisions of\r\nthe Security Council. Because of this, we support\r\nefforts to provide the Council with greater\r\ntransparency, and with the participation of the\r\ninternational community in its decisions, without this\r\nmeaning increasing the existing privileges or\r\nestablishing new categories.\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nThe Councils action should be innovative and\r\nexpress the political will of the international\r\ncommunity, all the while recognizing the fact that the\r\nprimary responsibility in avoiding conflicts will always\r\nrest with the parties involved.\r\nWe firmly condemn the acts of international\r\nterrorism and related crimes that have so deeply\r\nmarked the memory of the people of Argentina and of\r\nother nations of the world, making it the maximum\r\npriority. In this war against terrorism, we require the\r\nactive participation and cooperation of the entire\r\ninternational community, based on respect for\r\ninternational law.\r\nThere is a necessary link between respect for\r\nhuman rights and the fight against terrorism. And we\r\nmust preserve the balance between necessary defence\r\nand respect for human rights. In order to successfully\r\ntackle terrorism, we must ensure legitimacy by having\r\nthe support of international public opinion. According\r\nto this logic, the fight transcends the purely military\r\nand predominantly unilateral reaction.\r\nIn our view, modern threats to peace come from\r\nboth the criminal action of terrorism and the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, from\r\nmassive human rights violations and the absence of\r\ndemocratic political participation. But stability and\r\nsecurity are also affected by hunger and extreme\r\npoverty, by social exclusion, by ignorance and\r\nilliteracy, by the spread of disease and epidemics and\r\nby irreversible damage to the environment.\r\nAs a result, understanding that peace and\r\ndevelopment mutually reinforce each other, we must\r\nwork in a multilateral framework that promotes\r\nnational and international economic systems based on\r\nthe principles of justice, equity, democracy,\r\nparticipation, transparency, responsibility and social\r\ninclusion. Our commitment to peace and to the\r\nstrengthening of democracy in the world requires\r\ndecisive action, which makes it possible to combat\r\nhunger, illiteracy and disease. These phenomena\r\nweaken peoples autonomy and dignity and make it\r\ndifficult for them to exercise their full rights as\r\ncitizens.\r\nIn June 2005, the Third Inter-American Meeting\r\nof Ministers of Health and the Environment, which we\r\nare preparing, will work on the assessment of our\r\ncompliance with the Millennium Development Goals in\r\nthe region and will submit its conclusions to the\r\nSummit of Heads of State of the Americas, which will\r\ntake place in Argentina in November 2005.\r\nWe know that the problems that are linked to\r\ninequality and poverty cannot be resolved with social\r\npolicies that are based purely on assistance. Even when\r\nplans and programmes providing assistance are a\r\nnecessary resource, we should avoid the growth of\r\nsocieties that are divided between those who work and\r\nthose who receive assistance. In this framework, it is\r\nimportant for work to feature prominently on the\r\ninternational agenda, linked to freedom, justice,\r\nsecurity and protection, taking into account the fact\r\nthat it is the principal means of social integration.\r\nEconomic growth is a necessary prerequisite, but\r\nit alone is not enough to remedy the high rates of\r\nunemployment, lack of job security and work in the\r\ninformal sector besetting our societies. In the recent\r\npast, many of our countries we have experienced\r\nperiods of high growth with low rates of job creation,\r\nhigh concentrations of income and a significant\r\nincrease in poverty. It is clear evidence of the\r\nerroneous nature of the myth that economic growth has\r\ntrickle-down effects. Accordingly, it is important for us\r\nto pursue active policies that stimulate business and\r\nproductive investment and give priority to the\r\ngeneration of decent jobs, within a new model that\r\nendows economic change with a strong ethical\r\ncomponent. Decent jobs are a more effective\r\ninstrument for ensuring material and human progress\r\nand should become a goal during the international\r\ncommunity during the next decade.\r\nInstitutional conditions that would generate jobs\r\nare of a varied nature and depend on the specific\r\ncontext of every country. However, in developing\r\ncountries, the ability of democratic governments to\r\nmeet the legitimate demands of job creation from their\r\nsocieties are impaired by the protectionist measures\r\nthat limit trade, especially in the agricultural sector.\r\nThe developed world spends more than $300 billion a\r\nyear on production subsidies, a figure six times higher\r\nthan that of the direct aid given to poor countries. The\r\npoorest countries lose almost $40 billion a year\r\nthrough loss of exports due to the agricultural\r\nprotectionism of industrialized countries.\r\nThe world and the attitude of the developed\r\ncountries must change if we are to turn things around.\r\nNo political system or economic plan can be\r\nsustainable while we have the current critical levels of\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\npoverty and inequality. This is not something that will\r\nfavour a particular group of countries; it will promote\r\npeace and security throughout the world.\r\nIn addition, there is the problem of excessive\r\nexternal indebtedness, the current design of the\r\ninternational financial machinery and the role played\r\nby multilateral funding organizations. The 1990s, with\r\nits financial excesses at the global level, saw the\r\nexpansion of already oversized debts for a large\r\nnumber of countries. For the sake of the development\r\nof these countries and the international financial\r\nsystem itself, it is important to emphasize the idea that\r\neconomic growth is the central and decisive variable\r\nwhen it comes to capacity to pay and debt\r\nsustainability.\r\nDuring the recent international financial crises,\r\nmultilateral funding agencies made a series of mistakes\r\nin trying to resolve these problems. The solutions\r\nproposed spread to other countries, and this greatly\r\nmagnified the problem of hunger and poverty.\r\nArgentinas case is an example. After having\r\napplied throughout the 1990s the formulas proposed by\r\nthe multilateral financial agencies, the country\r\nexperienced a financial crisis that is still not entirely\r\nresolved. In 2002, the International Monetary Fund\r\n(IMF) made a serious mistake in diagnosing the\r\nproblem that led to major prognostic errors and poor\r\npolicy recommendations.\r\nOn the basis of our more recent experience, and\r\nbecause of the debt experience, we conclude that we\r\nhave to provide greater leeway to national authorities.\r\nWe need a different relationship with the IMF, one\r\nfavouring a solution consistent with the countrys\r\ncapacity to pay, sustainable over the medium and long\r\nterm and supportive of the principles of equality, social\r\njustice, the fight against poverty, hunger and\r\nunemployment.\r\nWe must promote the reformulation of fiscal\r\naccounting methods in the majority of countries, and in\r\nparticular in the international financial organizations,\r\nwith the aim of excluding investment in infrastructure,\r\nfrom current spending in the calculation of surpluses.\r\nWe know that fiscal surpluses are necessary in\r\norder to stabilize economies and respect obligations to\r\nthe international financial community, but it must be\r\nunderstood that no surplus is defensible. When\r\nsurpluses are achieved, thanks to the elimination of\r\ninvestment in physical and social infrastructure, this\r\naffects the possibility of political stability and growth,\r\nwhich turns something that was positive for countries\r\ninto an imbalance and a negative for the overall\r\nfunctioning of the economy.\r\nFrom the tragedy of excessively indebted\r\ncountries, we conclude that simple formulas which\r\nclaim to be universal and applicable under any\r\ncircumstance, at any time and in any place are only\r\nideological approaches to concrete issues that must be\r\nresolved with realism, flexibility and proactive\r\nattitudes.\r\nWe take responsibility for the adoption of alien\r\npolicies that led us to the worst of all worlds. But it is\r\nnot enough for the multilateral lending agencies simply\r\nto acknowledge their mistake in recommending,\r\nrequiring and supporting such policies. What we need\r\nis an urgent and drastic structural reform of the IMF\r\nthat will enable it to prevent crises and help to resolve\r\nthem. From a lender of development funds it has\r\nbecome a creditor demanding concessions. This trend\r\nhas to change. Otherwise, we will be confined to\r\nstructural reforms of a theoretical nature the results of\r\nwhich will guarantee nothing to anyone, and then a\r\nseries of self-critical reviews.\r\nMeanwhile, in our countries inequality will\r\nincrease because of the implementation of those\r\nreforms. The excluded millions those reforms have\r\ncreated will weep and poverty will spread. Mea culpas\r\nwill be uttered, and we will see the growth in the\r\nnumber of poor people, if we bother to notice them.\r\nThat is why we say that what is most in need of\r\nstructural reform are the international lending agencies.\r\nOn another subject, we firmly support United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations set up through the\r\nappropriate organs. This year we have doubled our\r\nmilitary and police staff in peacekeeping operations;\r\ncurrently Argentina is involved in eight of the present\r\n16 operations.\r\nThe recently created United Nations Stabilization\r\nMission in Haiti is of particular importance. It is the\r\nonly mission established by the Security Council today\r\nthat is located on American soil. The region has made a\r\ncommitment to help the poorest country in the\r\nAmericas to return to the path of growth and freedom\r\nand to guarantee democracy as the best way of\r\nensuring dignity, social and economic development and\r\nfull respect for human rights.\r\n29\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nIn that regard, Argentina reaffirms its position of\r\nprinciple based on universal respect for human rights\r\nand for international humanitarian law. The history of\r\nArgentina explains my Governments firm position on\r\nan issue that is now part of its identity as a democratic\r\nnation.\r\nInternational disputes must be settled through\r\npeaceful means. The United Nations has established,\r\nthrough different resolutions of the General Assembly\r\nand the Special Committee on the Situation with regard\r\nto the Implementation of the Declaration on the\r\nGranting of Independence to Colonial Countries and\r\nPeoples, that the question of the Malvinas South\r\nGeorgia and the South Sandwich islands is a special\r\ncolonial situation, which must be resolved through\r\nbilateral negotiations between my country and the\r\nUnited Kingdom. The decolonization Committee has\r\nexpressed itself repeatedly on this issue, and we greatly\r\nappreciate its work to promote the resolution of this\r\nquestion. We reaffirm once again the constant\r\nwillingness of my country to reach a just, peaceful and\r\nlasting solution to this sovereignty dispute, which is an\r\nissue of great importance for the people of Argentina.\r\nWe urge the United Kingdom to comply promptly with\r\nthe international communitys appeal and to resume\r\nnegotiations.\r\nIn the southern framework, we are committed to\r\nprotecting the international communitys interests in\r\nAntarctica by ensuring that all activities there are\r\ncompatible with the Antarctic Treaty and with its\r\nMadrid Protocol on Environmental Protection. The\r\nestablishment of the Antarctic Treaty secretariat in\r\nBuenos Aires is already a reality. We are grateful for\r\nthe assistance of those who always supported\r\nArgentina as home of the secretariat, which\r\nundoubtedly will contribute to achieving the main\r\nobjectives of the Antarctic Treaty system.\r\nAs a peace-loving State committed to\r\nmultilateralism, Argentina has always supported the\r\nsettlement of disputes through negotiation and\r\ndialogue, in keeping with equity and justice. In that\r\nrespect, our country fully supports the achievement of\r\na stable and lasting peace in the Middle East, based on\r\nthe inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-\r\ndetermination and to an independent, viable State,\r\nwhile at the same time supporting the right of Israel to\r\nlive in peace with its neighbours within safe and\r\ninternationally recognized borders. We hope that the\r\nparties will resume negotiations with a view to\r\nresolving their differences and will comply with their\r\nrespective obligations under the road map  a plan\r\nwhich Argentina, along with the rest of the\r\ninternational community, considers the best way to\r\nachieve a lasting and just peace in the region.\r\nThe Argentine Republic supports the attainment\r\nof the objectives of reducing hunger and poverty and\r\nthe provision of safe drinking water and sanitation,\r\nwhich were the main topics of the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, held in Johannesburg\r\n10 years after the Rio de Janeiro Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development.\r\nThe protection of the atmosphere is of special\r\nconcern to us, with respect not only to the ozone layer,\r\nbut to all the action needed to attenuate climate change\r\nand to help adapt to the changes that are already taking\r\nplace  which are at the root of the severe weather\r\nconditions that affect developing countries in\r\nparticular. In view of our concern, and convinced of the\r\nneed for the prompt entry into force of the Kyoto\r\nProtocol, we have invited to Buenos Aires the tenth\r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in order to\r\nhelp to give greater impetus to our joint effort to adapt.\r\nI hope to be able to welcome and host Government\r\ndelegations at the high-level segment that I will have\r\nthe honour of opening in Buenos Aires.\r\nFor that reason, we are calling upon the\r\nAssembly to show the necessary strength, courage and\r\nresolve to create a world of justice and equity and to\r\nput an end to the unfair rules often imposed by\r\nmultilateral financial institutions, which cause very\r\ndifficult problems for many countries and which\r\nincrease poverty.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nArgentine Republic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Néstor Kirchner, President of the Argentine\r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of\r\nthe Peoples Democratic Republic of Algeria\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the President of the Peoples\r\nDemocratic Republic of Algeria and former President\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\n30\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nMr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of the\r\nPeoples Democratic Republic of Algeria, was\r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika,\r\nPresident of the Peoples Democratic Republic of\r\nAlgeria and former President of the General Assembly,\r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Bouteflika (spoke in Arabic): I feel\r\nespecially proud as an African to see that Mr. Jean Ping\r\nis presiding over this session of the General Assembly.\r\nI believe that his qualities as a human being and his\r\nvast experience are a valuable asset to the United\r\nNations at a difficult time in international relations,\r\nwhen the Organization must play an even greater role\r\nin accordance with its mission and the expectations of\r\nthe peoples of the world. In order to discharge fully its\r\nresponsibilities and the tasks entrusted to it, the United\r\nNations must now adjust and adapt, and must reform\r\nthe structures and machinery that will enable it to\r\nstrengthen its capacity for action.\r\nThere is still much tension in the international\r\nsituation; indeed, new sources of instability and\r\nuncertainty are appearing. A comprehensive approach\r\nis required, given the inextricable interdependence of\r\nall those issues on all levels  political, economic,\r\nsocial and cultural. Today more than ever, security is\r\none and indivisible. Security cannot even be conceived\r\nof without a determined struggle against terrorism. It\r\ncannot shirk the requirement that it step up efforts for\r\nconflict settlement and prevention, nor can it disregard\r\nthe pressing need to encourage worldwide development\r\nthat is balanced, equitable and sustainable. It must be\r\nbased on genuine dialogue  a dialogue between\r\nreligions, cultures and civilizations.\r\nThere is no doubt at all that excellent work has\r\nbeen done, since the struggle against terrorism became\r\nthe absolute priority of the international community.\r\nYet, despite the efforts made and resources put towards\r\nthat struggle, there remains much to be done. In\r\nparticular, it is essential that we reach agreement\r\nquickly on a common definition of terrorism so that we\r\ncan be clear about the legitimacy of the struggle of\r\npeoples against foreign occupation and can stop\r\naccepting distorted, confused, ill-conceived viewpoints\r\nthat see terrorism as part of just one geographical\r\nregion, religion, culture or civilization. Drafting a\r\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism is more\r\nurgent and important than ever before. It is something\r\nwe have been calling for now, for more than ten years.\r\nVery close to Algeria, there is a conflict between\r\nthe Polisario Front and the Kingdom of Morocco that\r\nhas been going on for almost 30 years. It is a\r\ndecolonization issue that has not been resolved. The\r\nUnited Nations has clearly established that Western\r\nSahara remains a non-self-governing territory under\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1541 (2004). As in the case\r\nof Brunei, Surinam, Belize and Timor-Leste, the peace\r\nplan was unanimously accepted by the Security\r\nCouncil and provides a just and definitive framework\r\nfor a settlement, through the Saharawi peoples free\r\nexercise of their inalienable right to self-determination.\r\nIn seeking a satisfactory solution, Algeria has\r\nalways supported the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations and his personal envoy, Mr. James Baker, who\r\nhas truly earned the respect of our Organization for his\r\ntireless efforts. Algeria will continue to support the\r\nUnited Nations peace plan and remains fully available\r\nto contribute towards the implementation of the plan,\r\nin order to strengthen stability in our region and\r\nsolidarity among our peoples.\r\nHere I would reiterate that Algeria cannot decide\r\nthe future of the Western Sahara for its people and does\r\nnot want to do so. Any attempt to address the issue of\r\nthe Western Sahara in a context other than that of\r\ncompleting the decolonization process  part of the\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations  will result in\r\nthe failure of that process and will delay a final\r\nsettlement.\r\nIntensive efforts are underway within the African\r\nUnion to ensure peace and security in Africa, efforts\r\nthat are leading to prospects for settlement of regional\r\nconflicts. Those efforts reflect Africas firm resolve to\r\nbecome part of a new era of stability, security and\r\nprogress.\r\nThe conditions for establishing a genuinely\r\nbalanced and mutually beneficial partnership between\r\nAfrica and its partners through the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development (NEPAD), have never been as\r\nfavourable as they are today. A promising change in\r\nthat relationship is now emerging and gaining\r\nimportance. For that reason it is extremely important to\r\ncontinue encouraging Africa as it seeks to succeed in\r\nits work towards peace, development and integration,\r\nwhich it has firmly started.\r\n31\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nIn the occupied Palestinian territories the peace\r\nprocess is deadlocked, more than ever before. It is now\r\nmore difficult to find a just and lasting solution to the\r\nArab-Israeli conflict because of the brutal repression of\r\nPalestinian civilians; endless attacks against the\r\nPalestinian Authority, its institutions and its leaders;\r\nthe continuation of a settlement policy; the building of\r\nthe separation wall, in violation of international law as\r\naffirmed by the International Court of Justice; Israels\r\nrejection of obligations entered into in Oslo and its\r\nmanoeuvering to take everything of substance away\r\nfrom the road map.\r\nIn that same region, the Iraqi people face a tragic\r\nsituation and many complex challenges that require the\r\nsupport of the international community and the United\r\nNations.\r\nAt the dawn of the millennium, we all undertook\r\nto take up the challenges that we wanted to face\r\ntogether through a responsible global partnership. In all\r\nsincerity, can we be content with the meager results\r\nachieved to date? It is our hope that the summit in\r\n2005, incidentally the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, will be an opportunity for us to\r\nconfirm our commitments and to finally take the bold\r\nsteps that are needed to translate commitments into\r\naction, to eradicate poverty, destitution and\r\ndeprivation, promote sustainable development and\r\nensure peace and stability for all peoples.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Peoples\r\nDemocratic Republic of Algeria for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of the\r\nPeoples Democratic Republic of Algeria, was\r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Junichiro Koizumi, Prime\r\nMinister of Japan\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Japan.\r\nMr. Junichiro Koizumi, Prime Minister of Japan,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Junichiro Koizumi, Prime\r\nMinister of Japan, and inviting him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Koizumi (Japan): Today, the international\r\ncommunity is striving to meet challenges that the\r\nfounders of the United Nations could not have\r\nenvisioned sixty years ago. The fight against terrorism\r\nand efforts to ensure non-proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction are just a few examples of those\r\nchallenges.\r\nJapan has always pursued international\r\ncooperation centring on the United Nations. As the\r\ninternational community faces new realities, the United\r\nNations must adapt and address them.\r\nThe United Nations was created to bring about a\r\npeaceful, prosperous, and just world. To that end,\r\nMember States have united their strengths to promote\r\ninternational cooperation. Convinced that it can\r\ncontribute to creating a better world through its own\r\ncapabilities, Japan has endeavoured steadfastly to fulfil\r\nits role as a responsible United Nations Member. Our\r\nactivities in Iraq and Afghanistan offer excellent\r\nexamples.\r\nIn Iraq, based on the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions, Japan has joined international efforts to\r\nassist in the Iraqi peoples own struggle towards a\r\ndemocratic and prosperous nation. Japan has been\r\ncooperating with the Iraqi people to help them improve\r\ntheir daily life and rebuild the foundation of their\r\npublic life.\r\nThe humanitarian and reconstruction activities of\r\nJapans Self-Defence Forces and its financial\r\nassistance of $5 billion are working in tandem to that\r\nend. In order to promote international solidarity, Japan\r\nwill host the third Meeting of the Donors Committee\r\nof the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for\r\nIraq next month.\r\nIn Afghanistan, Japan has from the very\r\nbeginning taken the lead in assisting national\r\nreconstruction efforts. Japan hosted the International\r\nConference on Reconstruction Assistance to\r\nAfghanistan in January 2002. Japan has been actively\r\npromoting Afghan efforts for disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and reintegration. The Afghan people\r\nare working hard to prepare for presidential as well as\r\nparliamentary elections. Those elections are the most\r\n32\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nimportant milestones for a new, democratic\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nThe international community and the United\r\nNations must stand by the Afghan and Iraqi peoples in\r\ntheir strenuous efforts to rebuild their countries.\r\nWeapons of mass destruction, missiles and\r\nterrorism threaten international security in todays\r\nworld. Japan is the only country ever to have suffered\r\nnuclear devastation. As such, Japan has been at the\r\nforefront in promoting nuclear disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation. Japan hopes to achieve a peaceful and\r\nsafe world free of nuclear weapons. Furthermore,\r\nJapan has collaborated with other countries to prevent\r\nStates of concern and non-State actors from acquiring\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nWe must allow no room for terrorism to prevail.\r\nIn the fight against terrorism, Japan is doing its utmost\r\nto strengthen domestic legislation and related\r\nmeasures, and will continue to cooperate with other\r\ncountries.\r\nThe nuclear and missile issues on the Korean\r\npeninsula present a serious challenge to the peace and\r\nstability of north-east Asia and to the international\r\ncommunity as a whole. Japan is determined to continue\r\nto seek a comprehensive resolution of the nuclear and\r\nmissile issues and the abduction issue in line with the\r\nPyongyang Declaration. The six-party talks must go\r\nforward. The benefit that the Democratic Peoples\r\nRepublic of Korea would receive by resolving those\r\nissues would be substantial. There is no benefit for it in\r\ncontinuing to pursue its nuclear programme.\r\nAfter the Second World War, Japan experienced a\r\ndramatic economic recovery, with the help of the\r\ninternational community. On the basis of our own\r\nexperience, we are keenly aware that, in promoting\r\ninternational cooperation, self-help efforts are essential\r\nto overcoming difficulties and achieving a prosperous\r\nsociety. Japans official development assistance\r\ntherefore has been based on the principles of ownership\r\nand partnership.\r\nEnvironmental conservation must also proceed\r\nhand in hand with economic development. Japan has\r\ntaken the lead in global efforts in such areas as climate\r\nchange and environmental protection.\r\nIn addressing development challenges, including\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, Japan will move\r\nforward, making further efforts for the strategic and\r\neffective use of official development assistance,\r\nbearing those principles in mind.\r\nThe protection and empowerment of individuals\r\nand communities is the foundation of international\r\npeace and security. That is why Japan is advocating the\r\nconcept of human security. Based upon that idea, Japan\r\nis making efforts to realize a seamless transition from\r\nhumanitarian assistance to reconstruction support in\r\ncountries such as Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and\r\nTimor-Leste.\r\nIt is my strong belief that there can be no stability\r\nand prosperity in the world unless Africas issues are\r\nresolved. Japan initiated the process of the Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development\r\n(TICAD) in 1993. Last year, Japan organized\r\nTICAD III, with the participation of 89 countries and\r\n47 international organizations. African countries are\r\nnow promoting regional collaboration through the\r\nAfrican Union and working to implement the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development (NEPAD).\r\nThe collaboration between TICAD and NEPAD is\r\nsignificant, because both processes are grounded in the\r\nprinciples of ownership and partnership. A stable and\r\nprosperous Africa depends upon the promotion of trade\r\nand investment, together with official development\r\nassistance. This autumn, Japan will host the TICAD\r\nAsia-Africa Trade and Investment Conference.\r\nToday, in Africa, we are witnessing the unfolding\r\nof another humanitarian crisis. We share the\r\ninternational communitys grave concern over Darfur.\r\nJapan has decided to provide humanitarian assistance\r\nof $21 million. In addition, Japan intends to provide in-\r\nkind assistance to the Sudanese refugees in Chad.\r\nIn East Asia, there has been remarkable economic\r\ndevelopment. Japan has been working with the\r\ncountries in the region to build solid foundations for\r\ntheir own efforts towards economic development. In\r\nthat region, active efforts are also under way to foster\r\ncommunity-building. Building upon the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Plus Three, I have\r\nadvocated the idea of an East Asia community.\r\nThis year, Japan is a candidate for non-permanent\r\nmembership on the Security Council. Japan, if elected,\r\nwill redouble its efforts to play a constructive and\r\ninnovative role in the Council, based on its global\r\ncontributions.\r\n33\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nAs the international community rises to meet the\r\nchallenges we face in todays world, the United\r\nNations must not be left on the sidelines. We need a\r\nstrong and effective United Nations. Indeed, we must\r\ncreate a new United Nations for the new era. I applaud\r\nthe timely initiative by the Secretary-General of\r\nestablishing the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change. I trust that the Panel will\r\npresent the Secretary-General with a bold and\r\nambitious plan for reforming the United Nations.\r\nPeace and security, and economic and social\r\nissues are increasingly intertwined. The response of the\r\nUnited Nations must be coordinated and\r\ncomprehensive. United Nations agencies and organs\r\nmust be effective and efficient. Changes are needed\r\nthroughout the United Nations system.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council must be at the\r\ncore of those changes. In recent years, the role of the\r\nSecurity Council has expanded dramatically in scope\r\nand nature. The Security Council must fulfil its\r\nexpanded role, with the maximum cooperation and\r\nparticipation of the international community.\r\nTo that end, the Security Council must improve\r\nits representation to better reflect todays world. In\r\naddition, the Council must be provided with adequate\r\nresources to address challenges effectively. Countries\r\nwith the will and the resources to play a major role in\r\ninternational peace and security must always take part\r\nin the Councils decision-making process. The Security\r\nCouncil therefore needs to be expanded, both in its\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories, adding new\r\nmembers from both developing and developed\r\ncountries.\r\nThe universal purpose of the United Nations \r\nour common goal  is to maintain international peace\r\nand security. In striving towards that goal, each\r\nMember State must fulfil its role, commensurate with\r\nits own capabilities.\r\nIt is our conviction that peace cannot be achieved\r\nthrough force alone. On the basis of that conviction,\r\nJapan has played an active and distinctive role. Japan\r\nhas made considerable resources available for United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations, as well as for\r\nreconstruction efforts to assist in the consolidation of\r\npeace. Japans Self-Defense Forces have conducted\r\nhumanitarian and reconstruction activities in such areas\r\nas Timor-Leste and Iraq.\r\nSuch global contributions to peace are rooted in\r\nthe fundamental, cherished beliefs of the Japanese\r\npeople, who have been seeking an honoured place in an\r\ninternational community that strives for peace and\r\nprosperity. Those contributions are, I believe, greatly\r\nappreciated by the international community.\r\nRecent United Nations peace operations show\r\nthat there are many dimensions to the achievement and\r\nconsolidation of peace. Making peace a reality requires\r\ncomprehensive efforts, ranging from peace-building to\r\nnation-building. Japans role has thus become\r\nincreasingly vital to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, which is precisely the mandate of\r\nthe Security Council. We believe that the role that\r\nJapan has played provides a solid basis for its\r\nassumption of permanent membership of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn order to better reflect todays world, it is also\r\nnecessary to remove the enemy State clauses from\r\nthe Charter, as the General Assembly has already\r\nrecognized those provisions to be obsolete.\r\nThe scale of assessments for Member States\r\nneeds to be more balanced.\r\nNext year, the United Nations will celebrate its\r\nsixtieth anniversary. We will hold a high-level plenary\r\nmeeting to review progress on all of the commitments\r\nin the Millennium Declaration. Development, global\r\nsecurity and United Nations reform are all high on the\r\nagenda. Changes are needed on all fronts. The time has\r\ncome to make a historic decision to reform the United\r\nNations, and the Security Council in particular.\r\nTime is limited. Our future  the future of the\r\nUnited Nations  is at stake. I would like to call upon\r\nthe members of this body to work together and take a\r\nbold step towards the creation of a new United Nations\r\nfor the new era.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Japan\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Koizumi, Prime Minister of Japan, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\n34\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nAddress by Mr. José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero,\r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Spain\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom\r\nof Spain.\r\nMr. José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Spain, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency José Luis Rodríguez\r\nZapatero, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Spain, and\r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Zapatero (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): This is\r\nthe first occasion on which I have addressed the\r\nGeneral Assembly on behalf of my country; I am very\r\npleased to do so. My country is an old country  a\r\ndiverse country, with several languages and various\r\ntraditions and cultures. Our country is European,\r\nMediterranean and Ibero-American in character.\r\nI am speaking on behalf of a country that has had\r\nits share of difficult experiences throughout history. It\r\nis a country in which some people who are alive today\r\nhave known a civil war, a dictatorship that lasted for\r\nalmost four decades and a democracy that is now 25\r\nyears old and that has brought great progress. We have\r\nalso known the scourge of terrorism for more than 30\r\nyears  terrorism that has taken so many lives.\r\nOver the past 30 years, Spanish men and women\r\nhave learned a great deal about terrorism. We learned\r\nearly on how evil it is. We became familiar with it. We\r\nlearned how to defy it and how to withstand its blows\r\nwith courage and dignity. We have learned how to fight\r\nit. Precisely because they have experienced it for 30\r\nyears that the citizens of my country felt deeply the\r\npain of the American people on 11 September 2001.\r\nWe knew how they felt; we know how they feel. Here\r\nin New York, I would like to convey the heartfelt\r\nsolidarity of the people of Spain with the great nation\r\nof the United States.\r\nWe fully understand the terrible pain that in\r\nrecent years has been inflicted upon Jakarta, Bali,\r\nCasablanca, Riyadh and Beslanq. We know all about\r\nkidnappings, bombings and cold-blooded killings. We\r\nknow what compassion means.\r\nOn 11 March this year, a terrorist attack in\r\nMadrid took the lives of 192 people. We had never\r\nexperienced that kind of terrorism before, but we were\r\nfamiliar with the bloodshed and the pain that it caused.\r\nI would like, from this rostrum, to express my deep\r\nappreciation to all nations for their solidarity with our\r\ncountry when we were suffering so deeply after the\r\nbrutal attack in Madrid.\r\nSpanish men and women were not afraid. On the\r\nday after the bombings, millions of people left their\r\nhomes and took to the streets and squares of our cities\r\nand towns. Once again, we expressed our\r\ncondemnation, disgust and total contempt for terrorist\r\nbrutality.\r\nThirty years of resisting terrorism has taught us\r\nthat the risk of a terrorist victory rises sharply when, in\r\norder to fight terror, democracy betrays its fundamental\r\nnature, when Governments curtail civil liberties, put\r\njudicial guaranties at risk or carry out pre-emptive\r\nmilitary operations. This is what my people have\r\nlearned: it is the rule of law, democracy and political\r\nmethods that make us stronger and make them weaker.\r\nWe will resist terrorism. Our history endorses our\r\nresolve. We will pursue our fight against terrorism, but\r\nwe will do so respecting domestic and international\r\nlaw; we will do so with respect for human rights and\r\nfor the United Nations  and in no other way. It is not\r\nonly the ethics of our beliefs that move us. It is above\r\nall our belief in ethics. Our conviction is that\r\nlegality  only legality  will enable us to prevail in\r\nthe fight against terrorism.\r\nNothing justifies terrorism. Like the plague, it has\r\nno justification. But like the plague, it has roots that\r\ncan and must be uncovered. We can and must rationally\r\nanalyse how it emerges and how it grows, so that we\r\ncan fight it rationally.\r\nTerrorism is insanity and death, and regrettably\r\nthere will always be fanatics who are ready to kill to\r\nimpose their insanity through force, ready to scatter the\r\nseed of evil. The seed of evil cannot take root when it\r\nfalls on the rock of justice, well-being, freedom and\r\nhope, but it can take root if it lands on the soil of\r\ninjustice, poverty, humiliation and despair.\r\nRedressing the major political and economic\r\ninjustices that devastate our world would therefore\r\ndeprive terrorists of their popular support. The more\r\npeople there are who have decent living conditions\r\naround the world, the safer we will all be.\r\n35\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nIn this context, I would like to speak about Iraq.\r\nBut first of all I would like to speak about the\r\nthousands of victims of this conflict: the Iraqis, the\r\nsoldiers, the civilians who have lost their lives. We\r\nextend to them and to their countries our steady\r\nsolidarity.\r\nThe overwhelming majority of people in Spain\r\nspoke out against the war. We were not persuaded by\r\nthe arguments offered by those who promoted the war.\r\nWe expressed our views in the Spanish Parliament and\r\nin the streets. We spoke out loudly, we shouted. We\r\nalso said that winning the war would be much easier\r\nthan winning the peace. Peace must be our task  a\r\ntask that requires more courage, more determination\r\nand more heroism than the war. That is why the\r\nSpanish troops returned from Iraq.\r\nIn any event, what really matters now is to help\r\nfully restore the sovereignty and independence of\r\nIraq  a democratic Iraq at peace with its neighbours.\r\nWe will spare no effort in that task. And so Spain\r\nactively participated in the drafting of Security Council\r\nresolution 1546 (2004) and will continue to offer\r\npolitical and financial support for the process of\r\npolitical normalization and strengthening Iraqi\r\ndemocratic institutions.\r\nThere will be neither security nor stability in the\r\nworld as long as the Middle East conflict continues to\r\nbleed. That conflict is the primary tumour for many\r\nsources of instability.\r\nSpain firmly supports resolutions adopted by the\r\nUnited Nations, and other instruments such as the\r\nQuartets road map, which is yet to be implemented.\r\nThe time we are wasting is to be measured in terms of\r\nhuman lives.\r\nSpain stands by Israel against the terrible scourge\r\nof terrorism, against which it is entitled to defend itself\r\nby legitimate means. Spain firmly defends the\r\nestablishment of a viable, democratic Palestinian State\r\nthat can live in peace and security with the State of\r\nIsrael. Israel will be able to count on the international\r\ncommunity to the extent that it respects international\r\nlaw, but the placement of the dividing wall fails to do\r\nthat.\r\nSpain will spare no political, diplomatic or\r\ncooperation effort to try and bring about the peace that\r\nis so needed in the Middle East. But from this rostrum,\r\nwe would also like to extend an urgent appeal to the\r\nUnited States, the European Union, Russia and the\r\nUnited Nations to implement the road map. Those are\r\nfour powerful players indeed, and we want to see them\r\nexerting decisive diplomatic pressure.\r\nIn the humanitarian field, Spain has contributed\r\nseveral million euros to help alleviate the terrible crisis\r\nin Darfur. However, the Sudanese authorities must,\r\nwithout delay, take all measures necessary to end the\r\natrocities, bring the perpetrators to justice and\r\nnormalize the situation in the region. It is also\r\nnecessary for the rebel groups and militias to respect\r\nthe ceasefire and show a constructive attitude at the\r\nnegotiating table. In this context, we must support the\r\ninitiatives of the African Union.\r\nSpain believes we can no longer passively accept\r\nthe continuation of Africas forgotten conflicts, and\r\nthat is why, with partners in the European Union, we\r\nsupported the establishment of the African Peace\r\nFacility, an instrument designed to promote regional\r\nsolutions to crises in Africa.\r\nIn the Maghreb, Spain is pursuing an active and\r\ncomprehensive policy to enhance political stability and\r\neconomic and social development in the region.\r\nRegional integration and interdependence with Spain\r\nand Europe is, we believe, the way to reach those\r\ngoals.\r\nWith regard to Western Sahara, Spain strongly\r\nsupports the search for a just and definitive political\r\nsolution that is accepted by all parties and respects the\r\nprinciples set forth in the resolutions of the United\r\nNations. From this rostrum I appeal to all the parties\r\ninvolved to redouble their efforts, within the\r\nframework of dialogue and negotiations established by\r\nthe United Nations, to resolve a conflict that has\r\ndragged on for far too long.\r\nMay I confirm Spains commitment to\r\npeacekeeping operations  a fundamental part of\r\neffective multilateralism that we are seeking to\r\nencourage. Our political commitment is reflected in\r\nspecific contributions in the form of military\r\ncontingents for Afghanistan and Haiti, in accordance\r\nwith explicit Security Council mandates.\r\nPeace and security will spread through the world\r\nonly with the strength of the United Nations, the\r\nstrength of international legality, the strength of human\r\nrights, of democracy, of men abiding by the law, with\r\nequality of men and women, with equality of\r\n36\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nopportunities, no matter where people are born. We\r\nreject those who would manipulate us or wish to\r\nimpose any kind of religion or belief. The strength of\r\neducation and culture is essential, for culture is always\r\npeace. Let us ensure that our perception of others is\r\ncoloured by respect. There must be dialogue among\r\npeoples.\r\nThus, as a representative of a country created and\r\nenriched by divers cultures, in this Assembly I want to\r\npropose an alliance of civilizations between the\r\nWestern and the Arab and Muslim worlds. Some years\r\nago a wall fell. We must now prevent hatred and a lack\r\nof understanding from building another wall. Spain\r\nproposes to the Secretary-General  whose work at\r\nthe head of this organization we firmly support  the\r\npossibility of establishing a high-level group to move\r\nahead with this initiative.\r\nThis is the house of nations, but I see only\r\nwomen and men. I hear only the voices of women and\r\nmen who represent billions of other women and men.\r\nMany of these voices  many feeble and barely\r\naudible, the voices of children, the weak, the\r\nhopeless  come from lands devastated by poverty\r\nand inequality.\r\nMr. Zarif (Islamic Republic of Iran), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nIt is they whom I now want to address to declare\r\nthat Spain strongly supports the Millennium\r\nDeclaration Goals with respect to development,\r\npoverty eradication and the preservation of the\r\nenvironment. Poverty is the main cause of uncontrolled\r\nmigration flows. But no wall, no matter how tall, can\r\nprevent those who suffer from trying to escape poverty\r\nin order to recover their dignity as human beings.\r\nFor those reasons, we are firmly committed to the\r\npolitical declaration we adopted yesterday within the\r\nframework of the International Alliance Against\r\nHunger  promoted by President Lula da Silva \r\nwhich establishes new ways to fund development. The\r\nGovernment of Spain will substantially increase its\r\nofficial development assistance in order to reach the\r\nthreshold of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product.\r\nIn order for there to be peace, security and hope\r\nall over the world, international instruments for the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights need to be\r\nstrengthened and effectively implemented. That is one\r\nof the basic pillars of our foreign policy. Our objectives\r\nare the signing and ratification of the Optional Protocol\r\nto the Convention against Torture, the universal\r\nabolition of the death penalty, the effort to end\r\ndiscrimination against women, gender-based violence\r\nand discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation,\r\nthe protection of children and the combating of child\r\nabuse and exploitation, and the strict observance of\r\nhuman rights in the fight against terrorism and crime.\r\nWorld peace and security require respect for\r\nlegality. Therefore, Spain wishes to promote the\r\neffective functioning of the International Criminal\r\nCourt. To that end, I call upon all States that have yet\r\ndone so to ratify the Statute of the Court fully,\r\nunconditionally and without delay and thus help us in\r\nour common endeavour to build a world that is more\r\njust.\r\nMy Government wholeheartedly supports the\r\nUnited Nations reform process set out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration and endorses the Secretary-\r\nGenerals initiatives for the reform and institutional\r\nstrengthening of the Organization. Spain believes that\r\nit is essential for the future of the international order\r\nthat the reform be aimed at ensuring effective\r\ncompliance with United Nations resolutions, in\r\nparticular those of the Security Council.\r\nThe Security Council must be made more\r\nrepresentative, democratic, effective and transparent.\r\nTo that end, Spain is willing to consider new proposals\r\nfor achieving consensus on increasing the number of\r\nnon-permanent members and on the use of the veto\r\npower.\r\nI want to reaffirm Spains commitment to the just\r\ncauses of the Latin American peoples and to\r\nconsolidating democratic systems and political stability\r\nin the region. I reaffirm our support for economic\r\nprogress aimed at reducing inequality and\r\nstrengthening social cohesion. Within the European\r\nUnion, we will continue to promote a closer\r\nrelationship with that region through the development\r\nof a strategic partnership between both sides of the\r\nAtlantic.\r\nI would not wish to conclude my statement\r\nwithout referring to the question of Gibraltar. Every\r\nyear, the General Assembly reiterates its calls to Spain\r\nand the United Kingdom to pursue bilateral\r\nnegotiations in order to reach a definitive solution to\r\nthe dispute. I affirm that my country will continue its\r\nwillingness to negotiate a solution that benefits the\r\n37\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nregion as a whole and heeds the wishes of that non-\r\nautonomous territory.\r\nThe United Nations was born of necessity and\r\nideals. It was built by women and men who affirmed\r\ntheir faith in understanding among peoples and\r\ncultures. They left us a legacy of utopia. They thought\r\nthat everything was within their reach: the settlement\r\nof old conflicts, the eradication of poverty, rights for\r\nall human beings. Today we could ask ourselves, what\r\nis within our reach?\r\nAlmost everything is. It is true that the history of\r\nhumankind does not give us many reasons to be\r\noptimistic. Nor does the world today offer us many\r\nreasons to feel superior to the men that preceded us.\r\nOne out of three countries in the world does not have a\r\nfree system. Torture continues to exist. There are more\r\nthan 30 armed conflicts around the world today. Half of\r\nthe war victims are children. Millions of people are\r\nsuffering from AIDS. One billion human beings subsist\r\non a dollar a day. More than 800 million adults are\r\nilliterate. More than 150 million children are without\r\naccess to any kind of education. More than 1 billion\r\npeople lack safe drinking water. No, we human beings\r\ncannot feel very proud of ourselves.\r\nWe must fight to overcome this situation. We, the\r\nSpanish women and men of today, are resolved to make\r\nit possible for the women and men who come after us\r\nto be able to say: yes, they did do it.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Spain for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, Prime Minister\r\nof the Kingdom of Spain, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Fatos Nano, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Albania\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Albania.\r\nMr. Fatos Nano, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nAlbania, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Fatos Nano, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Albania, and inviting him\r\nto address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Nanos (Albania): It is my special pleasure to\r\naddress the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly\r\nof the United Nations. This universal forum has\r\nenabled the peoples of the world to coordinate and\r\nharmonize their efforts in preserving peace and\r\nsecurity, in achieving prosperity and upholding the\r\nvalues of human civilization.\r\nI would like to congratulate you, Mr. President,\r\non being elected to preside over this august body and\r\nto express my confidence in your successful\r\nleadership.\r\nI would also like, on behalf of Albania, to convey\r\nto the Secretary-General our highest appreciation for\r\nhis leading contribution to the fulfilment of the\r\nhistorical mission of the United Nations and to the\r\naspirations of our peoples for a better world in which\r\nonly peace, democracy and economic prosperity reign.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly takes place\r\nin a milestone year for Europe. Only a few months ago,\r\na historic event vitalized the dream of a more united\r\nand stronger Europe. Ten European countries, sharing a\r\ncommon aspiration for integration, were admitted into\r\nthe European Union.\r\nThe Albanian Government and society are\r\nengaged in an all-round European integration process,\r\nand they are carrying out necessary reforms with the\r\nnecessary political will and drive.\r\nAlbania is working to strengthen the democratic\r\ninstitutions and capacities of its central and local\r\ngovernment with a view to bringing its legislation and\r\nconditions into line with European Union standards,\r\nprogressively achieving concrete and measurable\r\nresults, as previously defined.\r\nDetermined to make our contribution to regional\r\nand global security, the Albanian Government\r\nconsiders the countrys integration into NATO to be\r\none of its major objectives. The NATO Istanbul\r\nSummit last June commended the progress made by my\r\ncountry in this regard and encouraged the deepening of\r\nreforms. It welcomed Albanias contribution to\r\nregional stability and cooperation and committed to\r\nassess our further progress at the next NATO summit,\r\nwhich would hopefully mark the start of negotiations\r\nfor our full membership in the alliance. We believe that\r\nthe commitments set up in the framework of the\r\nAdriatic Charter are also contributing to meet NATO\r\n38\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nstandards, to the benefit of regional stability and\r\nsecurity.\r\nWe remain truly convinced that the respect and\r\nprotection of human rights and freedoms are the main\r\npillars of a pluralist democratic society. The\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Albania will continue\r\nto constantly demonstrate its commitment to a full\r\nimplementation of the standards enshrined in the\r\nUnited Nations and Council of Europe conventions, as\r\nwell as the relevant documents of regional\r\norganizations, such as the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe, in which we are playing a\r\nvery active role. We will continue to do so in the future\r\nas well. By adopting contemporary legislation and by\r\nbecoming a party to other recently adopted\r\ninternational instruments on human rights, Albania has\r\nassociated itself with countries that are enforcing a\r\nnumber of national strategies and programmes focusing\r\non specific population groups, especially women,\r\nchildren, persons in need and minorities, among others.\r\nIn recent years, the Albanian Government has\r\nstarted to periodically submit reports to the committees\r\nof the six main United Nations human rights treaties\r\nand is taking their recommendations into serious\r\nconsideration. It is our belief that these international\r\nmechanisms play a significant and important role as\r\nguardians of the common human values we have\r\ntogether adopted.\r\nAlbania, as one of the 191 signatory countries of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration, remains fully committed\r\nto implementation of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, which have been properly reflected in a national\r\nstrategy for social and economic development. The\r\npattern of our sustained economic growth, which is at 6\r\nto 7 per cent for the seventh consecutive year, is a good\r\nsupport base for the whole society to maintain higher\r\nstandards of respect for human rights and to fight\r\npoverty and crime. I would like to take this opportunity\r\nto thank the United Nations specialized agencies for\r\ntheir valuable assistance in support of the\r\nimplementation of these objectives nationwide and on\r\na central and local level.\r\nThe Albanian Government is pleased to note that\r\nan ever-healthier climate of confidence and relations of\r\nbilateral and multilateral cooperation are prevailing in\r\nthe South-Eastern European region. The countries of\r\nthe region are fully engaged in a process that will lead\r\nus clearly toward Euro-Atlantic integration and at the\r\nsame time continually remove us from the extremist\r\ntendencies that caused a number of conflicts in the last\r\ndecade. The regional policy of my Government is\r\nguided by the motto: the more integrated in the\r\nregion, the more integrated in Europe. In\r\nimplementing this policy, Albania is cooperating as\r\nnever before with all the countries of the region by\r\nmaking borders less relevant, opening up to one\r\nregional market the implementation of free trade\r\nagreements and free movement corridors, and\r\nstimulating foreign direct investment. We are\r\nespecially cooperating with the common fight against\r\norganized crime and all kinds of illegal trafficking. In\r\nthe meantime, Albania is reinforcing its border\r\nmanagement and control, guided by the European\r\nUnion and NATO standards.\r\nMy country will hold general parliamentary\r\nelections by the middle of next year. We are committed\r\nto doing all that is required to ensure that the election\r\nprocess is fully compatible with international standards\r\nfor free and fair elections. To that end, we are\r\ncommitted to continuing to work with relevant\r\nspecialized institutions on elections by fully\r\nimplementing especially OSCE/Office for Democratic\r\nInstitutions and Human Rights (ODIHR)\r\nrecommendations. For us, the process and standards\r\nare more important than the results of the elections.\r\nIn the context of strengthening regional\r\ncooperation, my country is committed to a more\r\nenhanced partnership with all regional organizations\r\nand initiatives that serve the promotion of good\r\nneighbourly relations; the strengthening of regional\r\npeace, security and stability; ensuring political support\r\nfor integration into Euro-Atlantic structures, and\r\nattracting financing for national and regional projects\r\nin priority fields such as energy, transportation and\r\ntelecommunications.\r\nOn its path towards European integration, the\r\nSouth-East European region is still facing pending\r\nchallenges, such as the future of Kosovo. Albania\r\ngreatly appreciates the recent democratic and\r\nintegration developments in Kosovo, thanks to the\r\nefforts of the respective peoples and the partnership of\r\nits self-governing institutions with the United Nations\r\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).\r\nAllow me at this point to congratulate Mr. Soren\r\nJessen-Petersen, Special Representative for Kosovo of\r\nthe United Nations Secretary-General, in assuming this\r\nvery important duty.\r\n39\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nThe Albanian Government shares the view that\r\nthe time has come for a rapid and coherent\r\nimplementation of the policy of standards of a\r\nmultiethnic democracy and European status for\r\nKosovo. This would be the key to the solution of a\r\nnumber of other issues. We truly hope that the question\r\nof the final status of Kosovo will reach a final solution\r\nsoon, for the sake of the people of Kosovo and for the\r\nenhancement of the Europeanization process of the\r\nwhole region.\r\nIn the meantime, we support all efforts to build a\r\ndemocratic and multicultural society in Kosovo that is\r\ngoverned by the rule of law, ethnic and religious\r\ntolerance and cohabitation. Particularly helpful in this\r\nregard would be the further energizing of UNMIKs\r\ntransfer of authority to the legitimate institutions of\r\nKosovo that are already being anchored to European\r\nintegration agendas.\r\nWe believe that in the upcoming October\r\nparliamentary elections, the Albanian and other ethnic\r\ncommunities of Kosovo will demonstrate their best\r\nvalues, taking a major step toward the consolidation of\r\nmultiethnic democracy in the region. We also hope that\r\nthe Serbian minority in Kosovo will assume its\r\nresponsibilities and, through a free vote, make their\r\ncontribution to the European future of Kosovo. Their\r\nparticipation in all levels of the democratic institutions\r\nof Kosovo would further contribute to the\r\nconsolidation of peace, stability and the European\r\nperspective in the whole region.\r\nMy Government supports a stimulation of direct\r\ndialogue between Pristina and Belgrade, both on\r\npolitical and technical issues. This is fundamental in\r\nresolving the pending problems and is in accordance\r\nwith the spirit of regional and European integration.\r\nThe tragic terrorist attack one year ago in\r\nBaghdad, which took the lives of 22 people, including\r\nUnited Nations Under-Secretary-General Sergio Vieira\r\nde Mello, is still fresh in our memories. Such hideous\r\nand punishable acts, which continued in the following\r\ndays and months there and in other countries of the\r\nworld, such as Turkey, Spain, Russia, Indonesia and\r\nothers, show that terrorism is today the biggest threat\r\nto international peace and security, to stability and to\r\nthe values of world democracy and civilization.\r\nIn the global effort to combat terrorism, our\r\ncountries have already understood that, first of all, it\r\ncannot be identified with one people, one religion, one\r\nrace or only certain groups of society. We believe that\r\nthe fight against terrorism will only be successful if we\r\njoin efforts. In that context, we support the\r\nstrengthening of international cooperation among\r\nStates and international organizations, in which the\r\nUnited Nations has an irreplaceable role.\r\nThe Albanian Government has been consistently\r\ncommitted to making its contribution as an active\r\nmember of the international coalition against terrorism.\r\nWe have peacekeeping troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\r\nWe have signed, ratified and now are implementing 12\r\nUnited Nations conventions and protocols against\r\nterrorism. We are doing the same with the relevant\r\nresolutions of the Security Council, cooperating with\r\nand presenting regular reports to the Council. The\r\nAlbanian Government salutes the decision of the\r\nSecurity Council to play a more active role in the fight\r\nagainst threats stemming from the possession and\r\ntrafficking of weapons of mass destruction. We support\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1540 (2004).\r\nAlbania has, on the other hand, taken all\r\nmeasures for the implementation of the Code of\r\nConduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive\r\nSources of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA), convinced that this international instrument is\r\nextremely important to preventing threats stemming\r\nfrom the misuse of radioactive materials. Albania has\r\nalready taken the decision and will soon sign the\r\nProtocol Additional to the Safeguards Agreement of\r\nthe IAEA. This year, Albania also joined the\r\nProliferation Security Initiative, with its respective\r\ncommitments that will create benefits for all.\r\nPeace and stability have not been fully\r\nestablished in certain regions of the world. The United\r\nNations and the Security Council are the authorities\r\nmandated by the Charter to preserve peace and security\r\nglobally. It is only natural that crisis-solving solutions\r\nand initiatives in such hot spots around the globe as\r\nIraq, the Middle East, Afghanistan, Sudan and so on\r\nremain high on their agenda. We believe that a more\r\nactive engagement of the international community is\r\nrequired in finding the most suitable and lasting\r\nsolutions for those crisis situations, as is the further\r\nenhancement of the role and effectiveness of the\r\nUnited Nations structures.\r\nIn that regard, the Albanian Government\r\nwelcomed the unanimous adoption of Security Council\r\nresolution 1546 (2004) of 8 June on Iraq, approving the\r\n40\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nprovisional Government of Iraq and transferring to it\r\nauthority and sovereignty, the independence and\r\nterritorial integrity of Iraq, Iraqi Government control of\r\nthe armed forces and, in particular, the holding of\r\ndemocratic elections in early 2005. The progress made\r\nin Iraq is due to the cooperation between the Iraqi\r\nGovernment forces and those of the Coalition. We\r\nwould wish, however, to see a further lowering of\r\ntensions and a full stop to violence. We would wish for\r\nincreased security, more stability and the establishment\r\nof a democratic society.\r\nThat is why we strongly condemn the strategy of\r\nviolence and hostage-taking to achieve political goals,\r\nsometimes cloaked under a religious veil, and we join\r\nour voice to those of all the international actors that\r\nhave called for an immediate stop to those acts. The\r\nAlbanian Government supports the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations to provide the assistance necessary to\r\nbuild national democratic institutions in Iraq and to the\r\nholding of free and democratic elections early next\r\nyear.\r\nMy Government also follows with great concern\r\nthe developments in the Middle East. Like the whole\r\ninternational community, we hope to see an end put to\r\nthe deterioration of the situation in the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories, where violence towards the\r\ncivilian population is increasingly claiming innocent\r\nlives, especially those of women and children. On the\r\nother hand, we condemn any terrorist act against the\r\ncivilian population, irrespective of whose name it is\r\ncommitted in.\r\nThe Albanian Government strongly believes that\r\npeace can and should be achieved only through\r\ndialogue and negotiation. We are convinced that the\r\nSecurity Council, the Quartet and the international\r\ncommunity have the authority and the capacity to\r\nestablish a stable peace in Palestine and throughout the\r\nMiddle East based on the Security Councils\r\nresolutions and the road map. The international\r\ncommunity should continue to monitor closely the\r\nimplementation of the road map in order to avoid any\r\ndeviation from or change, misinterpretation or blocking\r\nof it by the parties to the conflict.\r\nCurrent developments and realities in the\r\ninternational arena, and the acute problems and\r\nchallenges we are all facing  such as preserving\r\npeace and security, facing the threats and dangers of\r\nterrorism, the fight against poverty and fatal diseases,\r\nthe effects of globalization and environmental\r\ndegradation  have increasingly sharpened the need to\r\nrevitalize our Organization. The Albanian Government\r\nis fully supportive of the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to reform the Organization, in particular the\r\ninitiatives taken regarding the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. We join with the voices that call for a stronger\r\nUnited Nations and for more efficient organs and\r\nmechanisms engaged in monitoring the implementation\r\nof obligations by United Nations Member States, in\r\nparticular those concerning global security.\r\nWe therefore think that the time has come to have\r\na more representative, more transparent and more\r\nflexible Security Council that could better reflect\r\ncurrent realities. Its enlargement with permanent and\r\nnon-permanent members would increase the\r\npossibilities for all States Members of the United\r\nNations to contribute to the preservation of\r\ninternational peace and stability. It would be a\r\nsignificant step towards the completion of United\r\nNations reform.\r\nMy country is willing to contribute further to the\r\nactivities of the United Nations, especially in the\r\nglobal and regional agendas related to sustainable\r\neconomic and social development and the protection of\r\nfundamental freedoms and human rights universally.\r\nTo that end, Albania has modestly presented for the\r\nfirst time its candidacy to become a member of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council for the period\r\n2005-2007. We hope we shall succeed.\r\nA few weeks ago, the whole world witnessed the\r\nsuccessful conclusion of the Olympic Games in\r\nAthens. Gathered around the Olympic torch, sportsmen\r\nand women demonstrated how closely nations can\r\nstand with one another and how we can get rid of\r\nhatred and conflict from our midst. Let the symbol of\r\nOlympic peace and fraternity help us to build a better,\r\nmore secure world for us and for generations to come.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Albania for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Fatos Nano, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nAlbania, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\n41\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nAddress by Mr. Göran Persson, Prime Minister\r\nof the Kingdom of Sweden\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Göran Persson,\r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Sweden.\r\nMr. Göran Persson, Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Sweden, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Göran Persson, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Sweden, and inviting him\r\nto address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Persson (Sweden): A few weeks ago, 200\r\ninnocent children were killed by terrorists in Beslan.\r\nToday alone, 1,700 children will be born marked by\r\ndeath from HIV/AIDS from their first breath. Also\r\ntoday, hundreds of children will die from starvation,\r\nbullets or mines in numerous parts of the world.\r\nHas this world become a better place than it was\r\na generation ago? Yes, I still believe it has. Democracy\r\nis more widespread than ever before. The cold war has\r\ncome to an end. Fewer people are suffering from\r\nfamine.\r\nBetter  but still, this world is not a good place.\r\nAs long as children die of famine, as long as war and\r\nviolence end lives that have barely started, the world is\r\nnot good. As long as children die from curable diseases\r\nsuch as malaria and tuberculosis, we  the political\r\nleaders of our countries  have not done enough.\r\nWe need a stronger commitment, a stronger link\r\nbetween words and deeds. We must pull together, more\r\ndetermined than ever. Each individual carries a\r\nresponsibility to take action for the sake of the\r\ncollective. We need a stronger United Nations.\r\nI want to see progress. Sweden is a staunch\r\nsupporter of United Nations reform efforts. While\r\nadvocating reforms, we believe that the core principles\r\nof the United Nations Charter remain as valid as ever.\r\nThreats to international peace and security must be met\r\ncollectively. The use of force is permitted only as a last\r\nresort and when authorized by the Security Council,\r\nunless it is an act of self-defence.\r\nWe need to make the United Nations more\r\nrelevant. We need a United Nations that can act early\r\nand quickly, in an integrated, sustainable and\r\nlegitimate manner. Last year, the Secretary-General\r\ncalled upon us all to take decisive action in order to\r\nsafeguard multilateralism. He will need our strong\r\nsupport to follow up on the report of the High-Level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change.\r\nFor the Security Council to remain legitimate,\r\nrepresentative and relevant, its composition must better\r\nreflect the world of today. Since the adoption of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, a small number of countries\r\nhave emerged as key political and economic Powers.\r\nThose countries should be given a role which is\r\ncommensurate with their importance. We also need a\r\nSecurity Council that ensures the legitimate interests of\r\nsmall and medium-sized countries. An expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council should not undermine its efficiency.\r\nA way to safeguard this would be to limit the use of the\r\nveto power. I hope that the High-Level Panel will\r\npresent a bold proposal that will end the present\r\nstalemate. A joint seat for the European Union should\r\nnot be ruled out as an option for the future.\r\nManaging transition from conflict to peace has\r\nbecome a primary responsibility of the United Nations.\r\nA standing committee of the Security Council to advise\r\nit on post-conflict transition issues would facilitate that\r\ntask. The Economic and Social Council must be more\r\neffective in bridging the gap between peacekeeping,\r\npeace-building and development.\r\nStill, weapons of mass destruction constitute one\r\nof the main threats to international peace and security.\r\nThe threat of terrorism in connection with the\r\nproliferation of such weapons is real.\r\nThe need for strong policies in disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation is acute. The nuclear-weapon States\r\nmust show real progress towards disarmament. Efforts\r\nto combat proliferation must be strengthened.\r\nCompliance with existing treaties leaves much to be\r\ndesired, and must improve.\r\nA wave of terrorist acts has shaken the world in\r\nthe past few years. The months when we have not had\r\nto mourn victims of terrorism are easily counted. We\r\nare all repelled by the barbaric acts of terrorism around\r\nthe world, from Beslan to Jakarta. Nothing can be\r\ncrueller than the violent, senseless and tragic loss of\r\ninnocent lives. All States must work together to\r\npreserve a democratic, secure and open society. That is\r\nhow we will defeat terrorism.\r\nBut we must also admit that we will never be\r\nsuccessful if we fail to defeat the causes of terrorism.\r\nFor me, it is clear: fanaticism and fundamentalism\r\n42\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nexploit peoples sense of injustice and lack of hope.\r\nPoverty, oppression, insecurity, intolerance, absence of\r\ndemocratic structures and lack of political freedom \r\nthey are all part of the breeding ground.\r\nThe fight against terrorism must be carried out\r\nwith determination. There are no short cuts: human\r\nrights must be respected; international law must be\r\nfollowed. Our global human rights instruments aim at\r\nprotecting the individual. But just as human beings are\r\nequal, so are States, big and small. International law is\r\nthe ultimate guarantee that all States, no matter their\r\nsize or power, are treated equally. For the sake of all\r\nnations, we need a strong multilateral system.\r\nThe conflict between Israelis and Palestinians\r\ncontinues to take innocent lives, causing unending\r\nhuman tragedy. Commitment from the parties to a\r\npeaceful solution and an end to occupation is crucial.\r\nOn the Israeli side, excessive violence, extrajudicial\r\nkillings, settlement activity and destruction of property\r\nmust end. Israels right and obligation to protect its\r\npeople must be exercised within the context of\r\ninternational law. On the Palestinian side, areas of\r\nparticular concern remain corruption, and security and\r\npolitical reform. The indiscriminate and horrendous\r\nterrorist attacks must stop, and the Palestinian\r\nAuthority must do more to achieve that.\r\nTo realize the vision of two States  a viable and\r\ndemocratic Palestine living in peace and security side\r\nby side with an Israel within secure and recognized\r\nborders, on the basis of Security Council resolutions\r\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  the parties need to meet\r\ntheir obligations. The road map of the Quartet is the\r\ntool to achieve this, but both sides must demonstrate a\r\nwill to use it.\r\nIn Iraq, a united international community should\r\ngive the Iraqi people all necessary support for the\r\nbuilding of an independent and democratic Iraq. To\r\nthat end, the role of the United Nations is vital. What\r\nIraq and the whole region need is not a new war, but a\r\nnew peace.\r\nIn Afghanistan, the security situation remains\r\nworrying. The attacks against national and\r\ninternational assistance workers are unacceptable. The\r\ninternational community should stand by Afghanistan\r\nin building a stable, secure and democratic society.\r\nThe size and scope of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations have expanded dramatically. I\r\nwelcome the trend towards peacekeeping operations\r\nwith broad and comprehensive tasks, including the\r\nprotection of vulnerable civilian populations.\r\nChildren continue to be victims of war and\r\nconflict. Nothing can be more important than the life\r\nand health of children. The late Swedish Prime\r\nMinister Olof Palme used to say that it is not\r\nmeaningful to talk about my children and your\r\nchildren; it is all about our children  the only\r\ntangible connection to the future that we have. Their\r\nprotection should be paramount to all of us.\r\nFour years ago, Security Council resolution\r\n1325 (2000) on women, peace and security was\r\nadopted. It was a groundbreaking achievement. But\r\nnow we need to do more to translate its common\r\nobjectives into concrete improvements for women\r\naround the world.\r\nAn increasing number of United Nations and\r\nother peacekeeping missions are set up in Africa.\r\nWhile hardship is the plight of countless men, women\r\nand children on the continent, Africa today brings hope\r\nof a more vigorous leadership to confront its\r\nchallenges. President Thabo Mbeki showed the way\r\nwith his bold New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) initiative. From that followed\r\nthe creation of the African Union, which is now\r\nestablishing itself as a decisive body for addressing\r\nviolent conflicts.\r\nInternational law should guide us in all our\r\ncollective efforts to attain freedom from weapons of\r\nmass destruction and terrorism, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and respect for human rights. Our finest\r\nachievement in international law in recent years is the\r\ncreation of the International Criminal Court. I call on\r\nthe Security Council to consider the possibility of\r\nreferring matters to the Court. Sovereignty entails\r\nresponsibility. The prevention of atrocities requires\r\ninternational action if Governments fail to assume their\r\nresponsibility.\r\nAt the Stockholm International Forum on the\r\nprevention of genocide last January, we pledged to\r\nshoulder our responsibility to protect potential victims\r\nof genocide, mass murder and ethnic cleansing. We\r\npledged to ensure that the perpetrators of genocidal\r\nacts are brought to justice. And we pledged to\r\ncooperate in the United Nations on these efforts.\r\nDiscussions on the definition of genocide should never\r\nstop us from taking action when it is called for.\r\n43\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nThe recent Security Council resolution, resolution\r\n1564 (2004), on the terrible tragedy in Darfur is a\r\nnecessary step in this direction. I particularly welcome\r\nthe request to establish an international commission of\r\ninquiry. My Government stands ready to give the\r\nSecretary-General our full support in that task.\r\nI also welcome the appointment by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of Professor Juan Méndez as his Special\r\nAdviser on the Prevention of Genocide. That will serve\r\nto make clear the link between massive and systematic\r\nviolations of human rights and threats to international\r\npeace and security.\r\nAnother issue of serious concern is the use of the\r\ndeath penalty. For me, as a democrat and humanist, it\r\ncan never be accepted. I want us to make every effort\r\nto seek the abolishment of the death penalty.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration and the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals are at the core of the worlds\r\nefforts to put an end to hunger and poverty. The\r\ncollective political will to give priority to sustainable\r\nglobal development, over short-term national interests,\r\nwill be the decisive factor in turning promise into\r\nreality.\r\nRich countries must fulfil their commitments. I\r\nam proud to tell you that Sweden will reach its national\r\ngoal of 1 per cent of gross national income for official\r\ndevelopment assistance in 2006. But development\r\nassistance alone will not yield the needed results. Both\r\nthe developed and the developing world must move\r\nforward on a number of other issues. And Sweden will\r\ndo its part.\r\nWe have translated the international agenda into\r\nnational policy, giving the entire range of government\r\nactivities one single objective: to contribute to\r\nequitable and sustainable global development. We will\r\nact in a coherent way with that single objective in\r\nevery field, whether trade, environment or agricultural\r\npolicy. But this is not enough. Other decisive areas are\r\ngood governance and transparency, democracy and\r\nhuman rights, women and workers rights. Let us end\r\nthe blame game. Let us focus on getting the job done.\r\nNext year, we will gather in this Hall for a\r\nsummit meeting to review progress on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration. By\r\nthen, we will also have reflected on the findings of the\r\nHigh-Level Panel and the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nIt will be a decisive moment for the United\r\nNations. It will be a chance for us, the Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, to show that we believe in collective\r\naction and that we will shoulder our responsibility for\r\nmaking our international institutions stronger and more\r\neffective.\r\nLet us not fail the United Nations at this most\r\ncritical juncture. Let us not shirk our responsibilities in\r\nthe face of complex new realities. Let us choose a\r\nsecure and prosperous future for all.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Sweden for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Göran Persson, Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Sweden, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Bernard Makuza, Prime\r\nMinister of the Rwandese Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Rwandese\r\nRepublic.\r\nMr. Bernard Makuza, Prime Minister of the\r\nRwandese Republic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Bernard Makuza, Prime\r\nMinister of the Rwandese Republic, and inviting him\r\nto address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Makuza (Rwanda) (spoke in French): Allow\r\nme at the outset to convey to the President my\r\nGovernments congratulations on his election to\r\npreside over the fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe have no doubt that his wisdom and experience\r\nwill be of great service to the Organization at a time\r\nwhen it must make important decisions, in particular\r\nconcerning the reform of the Security Council. He will\r\nsurely do honour to all Africa.\r\nI also take this occasion to express our gratitude\r\nand congratulations to Mr. Julian Hunte for the\r\nexcellent quality of his presidency at the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nIn April this year, the whole world joined\r\nRwanda in our observance of the tenth anniversary of\r\n44\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nthe 1994 genocide, in which more than a million of our\r\ncitizens  men, women and children  were\r\nmassacred by the former Government, which\r\ninstitutionalized hatred, discrimination and\r\nsectarianism.\r\nWe thank in particular the General Assembly and\r\nthe Security Council for joining us in this Hall last\r\n7 April to pay tribute to the memory of the victims in\r\nRwanda and to renew our commitment to ensuring that\r\nthe horrors of genocide do not occur again, in any part\r\nof the world.\r\nThat tragedy of genocide and its many\r\nconsequences obliged us in Rwanda to undertake the\r\nnational and collective duty of examining our\r\nconscience. We believe we have learned so much in\r\nsorrow from that task that we have undertaken concrete\r\nmeasures in that respect.\r\nIn the process, we created the National Unity and\r\nReconciliation Commission, which has led the national\r\ndialogue over the last five years. We have also\r\nundertaken vast reforms at all levels and in many areas\r\nof national life, which, among other things, enable\r\npeople to develop initiatives and to participate in\r\ndecisions affecting their own development. We have\r\nthus adopted a new constitution, which, for the first\r\ntime in the history of our country, was conceived by\r\nthe people of Rwanda themselves and drafted\r\naccording to the ideas, concerns, aspirations and\r\npriorities of the people and not according to those of\r\nso-called legal experts from other continents. This new\r\nconstitution guarantees the freedoms and fundamental\r\nrights of the people, brings together universal\r\nprinciples and national realities, but also, and above\r\nall, offers measures to exclude once and for all from\r\nour society the poor governance that led to the\r\ngenocide in 1994.\r\nWe have carried out important legal reforms that\r\nhave indeed restored our judicial system. In the search\r\nfor justice that will restore and reconcile our people,\r\nwe have introduced traditional participatory\r\njurisdiction  known as Gacaca  to judge the\r\nthousands of those presumed to be implicated in the\r\ncrimes committed during the genocide.\r\nWe are also now transforming our economy by\r\nemphasizing innovation, competitiveness, the role of\r\nnew information and communication technology and\r\nthe improvement of public services as the appropriate\r\nway to achieve economic growth and lasting national\r\ndevelopment. We have carried out other reforms in the\r\nareas of education, health, security and the\r\nadvancement of women in public administration to\r\nsuch an extent that today Rwanda leads the countries\r\nhaving the largest number of women elected to national\r\ndecision-making posts.\r\nRwanda is contributing, albeit modestly, to all the\r\npeace processes underway in our region and other areas\r\nof Africa. In this context, my Government did not\r\nhesitate to respond to the appeal of the African Union\r\nregarding Darfur and sent a military mission to\r\ncontribute to the efforts of the international community\r\nand the Sudanese Government to restore peace to this\r\nsorely tested region of our dear continent.\r\nWe feel that the international community also\r\nneeds to engage in some soul-searching in order to\r\nreflect on the lessons to be learned from the failures of\r\nthe past and to re-examine its responses to crisis\r\nsituations such as the genocide of 1994 in Rwanda. We\r\nshould therefore ask ourselves if we really do have a\r\nsystem of early warning in place to detect emerging\r\ncrises. Can we say that today, more than yesterday, we\r\nhave the political will necessary to respond decisively\r\nand appropriately around the world to these emerging\r\ncrises? Is the worlds division into major Powers\r\nzones of influence not continuing today  just as it did\r\nin 1994 in Rwanda  to prevent the United Nations\r\nfrom formulating just and effective responses to crisis\r\nsituations?\r\nEvery Member of this Assembly is certainly\r\naware of the magnitude and the frightening scope of\r\nterrorism as well as the challenge it poses to\r\ninternational peace and security. Indeed, from the\r\nRussian Federation, through Spain, Indonesia, Kenya\r\nand to the United States, terrorists are causing\r\ndevastation, even using innocent women and children\r\nto achieve their unspeakable goals.\r\nThe Great Lakes region in Africa is certainly\r\nacquainted with terrorism. Indeed, the forces that\r\ncommitted genocide in Rwanda, namely Rwandas\r\nformer Forces armées rwandaises (ex-FAR) and the\r\nINTERAHAMWE continue to bring death and\r\ndevastation with unsurpassed cruelty to the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Burundi and Rwanda. You all\r\ncertainly know of their most recent and sinister deed,\r\ncarried out barely two months ago, when this same\r\ngroup, together with the Forces nationales de libération\r\n(FNL) rebels of Burundi, attacked a refugee camp in\r\n45\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nBanyamulenge in Gatumba, Burundi, and massacred\r\n160 innocent people  men, women and children \r\nbecause of their ethnic origin.\r\nThe most incomprehensible and unacceptable\r\nthing for us is the well-known fact that the bases of all\r\nthese groups are located in the east of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and that their leaders are well-\r\nknown, but that no serious international action has\r\nbeen undertaken, to date, to destroy these bases and to\r\narrest their leaders. And yet, in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, almost in the very same\r\nlocation as these genocidal forces, there is a well-\r\narmed United Nations force, which is costing the\r\ninternational community a mere $700 million per year.\r\nWe need to seriously ask ourselves whether the\r\ninternational community has learned any lessons from\r\nthe tragedy of Rwanda. In our humble view, the United\r\nNations should assume its responsibilities and take the\r\nnecessary measures to disarm, demobilize and\r\nrepatriate the terrorist and genocidal groups in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, which continue to\r\ndestroy with impunity entire communities in our region\r\nand which have been the source of two wars in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, directly involving\r\nup to eight African countries.\r\nMy Government feels that, just as the\r\ninternational community has the responsibility or\r\nobligation to guarantee the protection of individuals in\r\nserious danger, it is also responsible for protecting and\r\nsupporting those who have escaped from those\r\nsituations. It is in this context that, since 1994, the\r\nGovernment of Rwanda has reserved 5 per cent of its\r\nannual budget for priority contributions to the health\r\ncare and education needs of those who escaped the\r\ngenocide. In the same spirit, and during the current\r\nsession of the Assembly, a draft resolution will be\r\nsubmitted, requesting the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations to mobilize the entire United Nations\r\nsystem to give financial support to our domestic\r\nefforts, which remain, despite everything, insufficient\r\nwith regard to the real  if not vital  needs\r\nparticularly of the orphans, widows and victims of\r\nsexual abuse. We hope that it will receive your support.\r\nMy Government has followed with great interest\r\nthe current discussions regarding reform in the Security\r\nCouncil. Rwanda, which has been the subject of debate\r\nalmost continuously in the Council for 14 years, is\r\nmore sensitive than many other nations to the need to\r\nmake this powerful body of our Organization more\r\nrepresentative and democratic. We feel, in particular,\r\nthat it is high time to end the marginalization of the\r\ncontinents of Africa and Latin America by granting\r\nthem permanent seats in the Security Council.\r\nWhile emphasis is quite rightly being given to the\r\nexpansion of the Council and regional representation,\r\nwe firmly believe that equal attention should be\r\ndevoted to improving the Councils methods of work\r\nand that emphasis should be placed on their\r\ntransparency. We hope that this aspect will be taken\r\ninto account by all the parties concerned; otherwise,\r\nthis reform will be cut short and will not have any real\r\nimpact. In particular, we are deeply concerned that an\r\nunwritten rule, nowhere to be found in print, seems to\r\nhave reserved the initiative for making proposals only\r\nto the permanent members of the Security Council.\r\nEven more worrying is the apparent division of the\r\nworld into spheres of influence, with each permanent\r\nmember having the almost absolute and exclusive right\r\nto propose draft resolutions and presidential statements\r\nrelating to its own zone of influence. This situation\r\ndoes no credit to the Organization and seriously\r\nundermines the credibility of the Security Council and\r\nits decisions.\r\nMy Government has taken note of the\r\nimprovements which have been made towards greater\r\nefficiency in the International Criminal Tribunal for\r\nRwanda, and encourages the Office of the Prosecutor\r\nand the Registry to pursue their efforts to end the waste\r\nand corruption which have characterized the Tribunal.\r\nAnd it is from that standpoint that we guarantee our\r\nfull support for the Tribunal in the implementation of\r\nits completion strategy. We are awaiting the upcoming\r\nconclusion of agreements regarding the transfer of\r\ncertain accused to be tried, as well as some who have\r\nalready been convicted and who will serve their\r\nsentences in Rwanda, which we feel is a token of trust\r\nand of restored cooperation.\r\nIn conclusion, for us, support for economic\r\ndevelopment remains one of the greatest raisons dêtre\r\nof the Organization. As I speak, as members know,\r\nhundreds of thousands of people in Africa are facing\r\nhunger, poverty and disease and are living in great\r\ndespair. The United Nations, therefore, needs to\r\nmobilize, concentrate and guide all our collective\r\nefforts to attain the Millennium Development Goals\r\nand to pull the African continent out of its current\r\npolitical and economic difficulties. Here, the New\r\n46\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nPartnership for Africas Development (NEPAD) is a\r\nkind of reassuring road map and framework, that is\r\nhelping us to bring about the rebirth and prosperity of\r\nAfrica.\r\nThus, this universal family of nations should\r\nreject the current situation with half of us living in\r\naffluence, prosperity and good health, while the other\r\nhalf is dying of hunger and disease, which all of us\r\ntogether can prevent and eradicate. Let us, therefore,\r\nwork all together to change this situation.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRwandese Republic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Bernard Makuza, Prime Minister of the\r\nRwandese Republic, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Phil Goff, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Trade of New Zealand.\r\nMr. Goff (New Zealand): Fifty-nine years ago the\r\nUnited Nations was established by nations determined\r\nto work collectively to find alternatives to conflict as a\r\nmeans of resolving disputes and to create a stable,\r\nsecure and more just and prosperous world. Devastated\r\nand exhausted by world war for the second time within\r\n25 years, nations put their faith in multilateralism and\r\nin this body in order to avoid future wars. The name\r\nUnited Nations evoked the unity of humankind, in\r\nwhich our shared needs and common humanity were\r\nmore important than our differences.\r\nIt is obvious as we consider the world today that\r\nwe have achieved that vision only in part. Yes, world\r\nwars have been avoided. International covenants have\r\nset out universally agreed human rights standards\r\nagainst which the performance of governments can be\r\nmeasured. International law has been developed and\r\nstrengthened. As Kofi Annan emphasized this morning\r\n(see A/59/PV.3), putting the rule of law into effect at\r\nhome and internationally is essential to achieving a\r\nfair, just and civilized world. Cooperation has achieved\r\nadvances in meeting social, economic and\r\nenvironmental needs.\r\nBut much more remains to be done. War, more\r\noften within than across the boundaries of States, has\r\ntaken the lives of tens of millions of people since 1945,\r\nmost of them civilians. Weapons of mass destruction\r\nhave accumulated and access to them has spread to\r\nmore countries. New diseases such as HIV/AIDS have\r\nemerged, with devastating consequences. The gap\r\nbetween rich and poor countries has widened, not\r\ndiminished.\r\nThis year the Secretary-Generals High-Level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change will put\r\nforward proposals for reforming and strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations, aimed at ensuring its relevance and\r\neffectiveness in addressing these issues. It is critical\r\nthat we seize this unique opportunity to institute\r\npositive reforms and not squander it by adopting\r\nnarrow, self-interested and inflexible responses. Nor\r\nwill a lowest-common-denominator approach achieve\r\nwhat we all require.\r\nReform is long overdue. The composition of the\r\nSecurity Council cannot go on reflecting the world as it\r\nwas in 1945. An expanded Security Council and reform\r\nof outmoded electoral groupings is necessary for the\r\nCouncil to be representative of the international\r\ncommunity as it is today. Those changes will\r\nstrengthen the Councils mandate and enhance its\r\ncredibility as the pre-eminent organ of the United\r\nNations. No solution, of course, will satisfy the\r\nviewpoint of every Member nation. A willingness to\r\ncompromise on a package of proposals will be\r\nessential. But clearly, enhancing the representation of\r\nareas such as Asia, Latin America and Africa must be\r\nan objective, and account must be taken of the\r\nsignificant contributions to the United Nations of\r\nnations such as Japan.\r\nWhile the High-Level Panel will focus on reform\r\nof the United Nations and security considerations,\r\ndevelopment goals to create a fairer world and promote\r\neconomic and social progress in the developing world\r\nare further vital considerations for the United Nations\r\nin the year ahead. For hundreds of millions of people,\r\nstarvation, disease and poverty are more immediate\r\nthreats than the concerns others of us have about\r\nterrorism and security.\r\nWe are now at a turning point in achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Improving the quality\r\nand quantity of development assistance is crucial.\r\nHowever, real and lasting progress to meet\r\ndevelopment challenges is also dependent on building\r\na fairer, more open and equitable global trading\r\nsystem. Countries of the Organization for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development (OECD) spend\r\n$360 billion each year on subsidizing agricultural\r\n47\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nproduction in a way that excludes opportunities for the\r\ndeveloping world to export  not only to OECD\r\ncountries, but to third markets as well. That sum\r\ndwarfs the amount the OECD countries provide in\r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nNew Zealand welcomes the progress made at the\r\nWorld Trade Organization General Council meeting in\r\nGeneva in July, which put the Doha Development\r\nAgenda back on track. Agriculture is at the heart of the\r\nround; the European Union and United States\r\nagreement to eliminate all agricultural export subsidies\r\nis particularly welcome.\r\nThe United Nations must also adapt itself to the\r\nchanging nature of security and humanitarian concerns.\r\nThe concept of national sovereignty being paramount\r\nand standing in the way of international intervention in\r\nlocal conflicts cannot be sustained. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has challenged us,\r\nif humanitarian intervention is, indeed, an\r\nunacceptable assault on sovereignty, how should\r\nwe respond to a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica  to\r\ngross and systematic violations of human rights\r\nthat offend every precept of our common\r\nhumanity? (A/54/2000, para. 217)\r\nThe International Commission on Intervention\r\nand State Sovereignty concluded two and a half years\r\nago that sovereign States have the responsibility to\r\nprotect their own citizens from avoidable catastrophe:\r\nfrom mass murder and rape, from starvation. When\r\nthey are unwilling or unable to do so, that\r\nresponsibility must be borne by the broader community\r\nof nations.\r\nWe are today witnessing a humanitarian and\r\nhuman rights catastrophe in Darfur. The World Health\r\nOrganization reports that up to 10,000 people a month\r\nare dying or being killed. The very young and the\r\nelderly are most vulnerable.\r\nA few days ago, by its resolution 1564 (2004), the\r\nSecurity Council resolved to support an enlarged\r\nAfrican Union monitoring mission, demanded that all\r\nparties cease all violence and human rights violations\r\nand threatened further steps against the Government of\r\nthe Sudan if it fails to disarm the militias and protect\r\ncivilians.\r\nWithin the General Assembly, countries must\r\nwork together in a united and determined way to\r\nenforce those provisions and prevent the tragedy that is\r\nunfolding. History will not forgive those who stand in\r\nthe way of protecting 1.5 million refugees in that\r\nregion and allowing them to return safely to their\r\nhomes. It is also important that those responsible for\r\nthe mass murders and the abuse of human rights there\r\nbe held to account for their actions. There must be no\r\nimpunity for such crimes.\r\nThat is true in Darfur, and is also true of those\r\nresponsible for the destruction of East Timor and the\r\nmurder of people there in 1999. The ad hoc tribunals in\r\nIndonesia have failed to bring to justice those who are\r\nresponsible. That failure can only encourage such\r\npeople to commit further atrocities, believing that they\r\nwill never be held responsible for their actions.\r\nNew Zealand welcomes the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court and the role that it will\r\nnow play in dealing with genocide, war crimes and\r\ncrimes against humanity. It urges all countries which\r\nhave not yet done so to accede to the convention\r\nestablishing that body and to recognize its jurisdiction.\r\nIn the area of conflict resolution, we face today\r\ntwo major challenges: in Afghanistan and in Iraq. New\r\nZealand has strongly supported efforts to bring security\r\nand stability to Afghanistan. As a small country we\r\nhave contributed more than NZ$ 80 million in military\r\nand development assistance. We welcome progress\r\ntowards presidential elections next month and the\r\nessential democratic mandate that they will provide to\r\nthe Government.\r\nStrong international support, however, will be\r\nnecessary to meet the challenges which lie ahead. That\r\nincludes ending the production and trading of drugs.\r\nAfghanistan provides about 75 per cent of the world\r\ntrade in opiates. The money derived funds warlords\r\nand organized crime and undermines the ability of the\r\nlegitimate Government to function.\r\nNew Zealand deplores the violence in Iraq, which\r\ncontinues to harm or take the lives of so many people,\r\nand the circumstances which have contributed to that\r\nviolence. We call on those responsible for taking the\r\nlives of innocent people to end their violence. They\r\nnow have access to a political process which they\r\nshould use to promote their views and interests. A\r\ncredible election process is vital to creating an Iraqi\r\nGovernment which has a popular mandate. The United\r\nNations has a key role to play in that process, but\r\nadequate security and a safe environment are first\r\nnecessary for that to occur. New Zealand will continue\r\n48\r\nA/59/PV.4\r\nto support the interim Iraqi authority and the United\r\nNations in their efforts to restore security, peace and\r\nprosperity to the Iraqi people, who have suffered for so\r\nlong.\r\nIn Iraq and elsewhere, close attention also needs\r\nto be given to the protection of United Nations staff.\r\nThe General Assembly this year will consider an\r\nintegrated security strategy for the United Nations,\r\nwhich will incorporate a system-wide review of the\r\nUnited Nations security apparatus, accountability and\r\nresources. The Convention on the Safety of United\r\nNations and Associated Personnel must be\r\nstrengthened and supported by all States Members of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nNew Zealand condemns all acts of terrorism and\r\nwill continue to contribute strongly to the campaign\r\nagainst terrorism. In particular, we condemn the\r\ninhumanity of terrorists in Beslan who sacrificed\r\nchildren as pawns in pursuit of their political\r\nobjectives. However, attempts to suppress terrorism by\r\nforce will not by themselves be enough unless we also\r\naddress the causes which drive people to support,\r\nfinance or be recruited into terrorism.\r\nIn that regard, no action will be more important\r\nto the undermining of terrorism today than finding a\r\njust and sustainable solution to the conflict between\r\nIsrael and the Palestinian people. The international\r\ncommunity must work with those countries to\r\novercome the failure of leadership, the lack of resolve\r\nand the cycle of violence and retaliation which stand in\r\nthe way of solving that conflict.\r\nFinally, in the Pacific region, New Zealands own\r\nneighbourhood, we can celebrate the progress which\r\nhas been made in Bougainville and in the Solomon\r\nIslands in ending conflict and re-establishing the rule\r\nof law. In both cases, a concerted regional response\r\nwith the support of the United Nations has been\r\neffective. In Bougainville, that response created peace\r\nfrom a situation where a 10-year civil war had resulted\r\nin widespread devastation and the loss of thousands of\r\nlives.\r\nIn the Solomon Islands, the intervention of the\r\nRegional Assistance Mission has restored the rule of\r\nlaw by its elected Government in place of the anarchy\r\ncreated by armed militias. More than 3,500 weapons\r\nhave been collected and destroyed, social services and\r\na credible budgetary progress restored and militiamen\r\nand corrupt elements from the police and Government\r\narrested and charged.\r\nMuch however, remains to be done to meet the\r\nwide-ranging challenges which confront the Pacific\r\nregion, including environmental threats, ethnic\r\nconflict, poor law enforcement and governance and the\r\nthreat of disease. Regional solutions are being applied\r\nby the Pacific Islands Forum through greater\r\ncollaboration and integration in addressing problems.\r\nInternational cooperation through processes such as the\r\n10-year Review of the Barbados Programme of Action\r\nset to take place in Mauritius next year will also help.\r\nIn conclusion, 59 years from the end of the\r\nSecond World War and the establishment of the United\r\nNations, the world continues to face major challenges\r\nto its security and well-being. The opportunity exists\r\nthis year for us to consider and improve the ways by\r\nwhich the Assembly can address the problems faced by\r\nhumanity and make a difference. Success or failure to\r\ndo so will be the collective responsibility of all of us.\r\nThe meeting rose at 8.10 p.m.\r\n"
