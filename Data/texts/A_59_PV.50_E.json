(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.40 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 16\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and\r\nother elections: election of seven members of the\r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/59/131)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Pursuant to\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 42/450 of 17 December\r\n1987, the Assembly elects the members of the\r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination upon their\r\nnomination by the Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe Assembly has before it document A/59/131,\r\nwhich contains the names of the countries nominated\r\nby the Economic and Social Council to fill the\r\nvacancies in the Committee that will occur as a result\r\nof the expiration, on 31 December 2004, of the terms\r\nof office of China, Ethiopia, Japan, Nigeria, the\r\nRepublic of Korea, Tunisia and Uruguay.\r\nThose States are eligible for immediate\r\nre-election.\r\nI should like to remind members that, after\r\n1 January 2005, the following States will still be\r\nmembers of the Committee: Argentina, Armenia, the\r\nBahamas, Benin, Brazil, Canada, the Central African\r\nRepublic, the Comoros, Cuba, France, Gabon,\r\nGermany, India, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran, Mexico, Monaco, Nicaragua, Pakistan, the\r\nRepublic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, South\r\nAfrica, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of\r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States\r\nof America and Zimbabwe.\r\nTherefore, those 27 States are not eligible in this\r\nelection.\r\nI should now like to inform members that the\r\nfollowing Member States have been nominated by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nThe three African States, for three vacancies, are\r\nAlgeria, Ghana and Kenya.\r\nThe three Asian States, for three vacancies, are\r\nChina, Japan and the Republic of Korea.\r\nThe one Latin American and Caribbean State, for\r\none vacancy, is Jamaica.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, all elections should be held by secret ballot,\r\nand there shall be no nominations. However, I should\r\nlike to recall paragraph 16 of General Assembly\r\ndecision 34/401, whereby the practice of dispensing\r\nwith the secret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs\r\nwhen the number of candidates corresponds to the\r\nnumber of seats to be filled should become standard,\r\nunless a delegation specifically requests a vote on a\r\ngiven election.\r\nIn the absence of such a request, may I take it that\r\nthe Assembly decides to proceed to the election on the\r\nbasis of dispensing with the secret ballot?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.50\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Since the\r\nnumber of States nominated from among the three\r\nregional groups corresponds to the number of seats to\r\nbe filled in each of those groups, may I therefore take\r\nit that the Assembly wishes to declare those States\r\nnominated by the Economic and Social Council from\r\namong the African States, the Asian States and the\r\nLatin American and Caribbean States — namely,\r\nAlgeria, China, Ghana, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya and the\r\nRepublic of Korea — elected members of the\r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination for three-\r\nyear terms of office beginning on 1 January 2005.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I congratulate\r\nthe seven States that have been elected members of the\r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination.\r\nWe have thus concluded our consideration of\r\nagenda item 16.\r\nAgenda item 17\r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs\r\nand other appointments\r\n(g) Appointment of members of the Committee\r\non Conferences\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/59/107)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): As indicated in\r\ndocument A/59/107, and as the terms of office of\r\nAustria, Ethiopia, Jamaica, Jordan, Nepal, Tunisia and\r\nthe United States of America will expire on\r\n31 December 2004, the President of the General\r\nAssembly is required to appoint, during this session of\r\nthe General Assembly, seven members to the vacant\r\nseats on the Committee on Conferences. The new\r\nmembers will take up their functions for a period of\r\nthree years, beginning on 1 January 2005.\r\nAfter holding consultations with the Chairmen of\r\nthe regional groups of the African, Asian, Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean and Western European and\r\nother States, I have appointed Austria, China, Egypt,\r\nJamaica, Kenya, Nepal and the United States of\r\nAmerica as members of the Committee on Conferences\r\nfor a term of office commencing on 1 January 2005.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes\r\nnote of those appointments?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): May I take it\r\nthat the General Assembly decides to conclude its\r\nconsideration of sub-item (g) of agenda item 17?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n(h) Appointment of members of the Joint\r\nInspection Unit\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/59/108)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): As indicated in\r\ndocument A/59/108, the General Assembly is required,\r\nduring the fifty-ninth session, to appoint four members\r\nto fill the vacancies in the Joint Inspection Unit that\r\nwill arise from the expiration of the term of office on\r\n31 December 2005 of Ms. Doris Bertrand-Muck\r\n(Austria), Mr. Ion Gorita (Romania), Mr. Wolfgang M.\r\nMünch (Germany) and Mr. Louis-Dominique\r\nOuédraogo (Burkina Faso).\r\nAs is also indicated in document A/59/108, in\r\naccordance with article 3, paragraph 1, of the Statute of\r\nthe Joint Inspection Unit, the President of the General\r\nAssembly shall consult with Member States to draw up\r\na list of four countries that would be requested to\r\npropose a candidate for appointment to the Joint\r\nInspection Unit.\r\nAfter holding the necessary consultations, I\r\nshould like to communicate to the Assembly that the\r\ninformation that I have received from the Chairmen of\r\nthe respective Groups of States.\r\nFor the single seat from among the Group of\r\nAfrican States, the Group has nominated Senegal. For\r\nthe single seat from among the Group of Eastern\r\nEuropean States, the Group has nominated Hungary.\r\nFor the two seats from among the Group of Western\r\nEuropean and other States, the Group has nominated\r\nFrance and Turkey.\r\nIn accordance with article 3, paragraph 1, of the\r\nStatute of the Joint Inspection Unit, France, Hungary,\r\nSenegal and Turkey will therefore be called upon to\r\nsubmit the names of candidates and their curricula\r\nvitae highlighting their relevant qualifications for the\r\nposts to be filled.\r\nAfter holding the necessary consultations referred\r\nto by article 3, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Joint\r\nInspection Unit, including consultations with the\r\nPresident of the Economic and Social Council and with\r\nthe Secretary-General in his capacity as Chairman of\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.50\r\nthe United Nations System Chief Executives Board for\r\nCoordination, I shall propose to the Assembly a list of\r\nqualified candidates for appointment to the Joint\r\nInspection Unit.\r\nWe have thus concluded the current stage of our\r\nconsideration of sub-item (h) of agenda item 17.\r\nAgenda item 25\r\nImplementation of the resolutions of the\r\nUnited Nations\r\nThe President (spoke in French): It is my\r\nunderstanding that there is no request to consider this\r\nitem during this session.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to defer consideration of this item to the\r\nsixtieth session, and to include it in the provisional\r\nagenda of the sixtieth session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 56 (continued)\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional and other organizations\r\n(i) Cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the International Organization of\r\nla Francophonie\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.19)\r\n(j) Cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.5/Rev.2)\r\n(q) Cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Pacific Islands Forum\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.11)\r\n(t) Cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Community of Portuguese-\r\nspeaking Countries\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.14)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Members will\r\nrecall that the Assembly held the debate on this agenda\r\nitem and its sub-items (a) through (t) at its 38th to 40th\r\nplenary meetings, on 21 and 22 October 2004.\r\nI give the floor to the representative of Chile to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/59/L.5/Rev.2.\r\nMr. Donoso (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I have\r\nthe honour to announce to the General Assembly that,\r\nfollowing intensive and fruitful consultations among\r\nthe interested parties, we have reached a consensus on\r\ndraft resolution A/59/L.5/Rev.2, on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union. We wish to thank the more than\r\n100 sponsors of the draft resolution from all regions of\r\nthe world. The following countries have joined the list\r\nof sponsors: Australia, Burundi, Cyprus, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Estonia, the former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Tunisia.\r\nWe understand that the phrase “the usual\r\ncourtesies” in operative paragraph 3 of the draft\r\nresolution means that there will not be any exclusion of\r\nparticipants in the second World Conference of\r\nSpeakers of Parliaments at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters in September 2005.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I give the floor\r\nto the representative of Sao Tome and Principe to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/59/L.14.\r\nMr. Ferreira (Sao Tome and Principe): On behalf\r\nof Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau,\r\nMozambique, Portugal, Timor-Leste and Sao Tome and\r\nPrincipe, I have the honour to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.14 under agenda item 56 (t), entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCommunity of Portuguese-speaking Countries”.\r\nThe Community of Portuguese-speaking\r\nCountries (CPLP) was founded on 17 July 1996 and\r\nbecame a United Nations observer on 18 November\r\n1999. The CPLP brings together 240 million people in\r\neight countries on four continents. Its member States\r\nbelong to regional organizations such as the European\r\nUnion, the African Union, the Organization of\r\nAmerican States and the Association of South-East\r\nAsian Nations.\r\nThe CPLP is devoting special attention to the\r\npolitical situation in Guinea-Bissau. Last week, the\r\nCPLP Council of Ministers met in Lisbon and decided\r\nto establish a temporary CPLP office in Guinea-Bissau.\r\nThat office will assist Guinea-Bissau in its national\r\ndialogue and reconciliation and also in determining its\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.50\r\nspecific and urgent needs so that the country can return\r\nto the path of stability.\r\nIn collaboration with the Economic Community\r\nof West African States and the Special Representative\r\nof the Secretary-General for Guinea-Bissau, we are\r\nhelping to rebuild confidence at the national level. The\r\nCPLP is certain that the United Nations and the\r\nregional organizations to which Guinea-Bissau belongs\r\nwill work in close cooperation to rescue the country\r\nfrom the cycle of violence, poverty, instability and\r\nisolation.\r\nThe actions of the CPLP demonstrate that we\r\nhave been implementing the rules of multilateralism\r\nand have been cooperating with the United Nations.\r\nNow we want to formalize that role and broaden that\r\ncooperation by contributing to development and\r\ninternational security. For example, we would like to\r\nsee the establishment of fruitful cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations, so that the CPLP can contribute to the\r\nimplementation of the goals of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nIn operative paragraph 1 of the draft resolution,\r\nthe General Assembly invites the Secretary-General to\r\nundertake consultations with the Executive Secretary\r\nof the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries,\r\nwith a view to promoting cooperation between the two\r\nsecretariats. In that regard, joint efforts aimed at\r\npolitical facilitation, such as in Guinea-Bissau,\r\nconstitute one area that could be explored.\r\nIn operative paragraph 2, the Assembly requests\r\nthe specialized agencies and other bodies and\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations to cooperate to this\r\nend with the Secretary-General and the Executive\r\nSecretary of the CPLP. I wish to draw the attention of\r\nmembers to the fact that the CPLP has already signed\r\ncooperation agreements with a number of United\r\nNations organs and agencies — namely, the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization, the World Food Programme and the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment — but that much more work remains to\r\nbe done.\r\nFinally, the draft resolution asks the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to submit a report on the implementation of\r\nthe present resolution to the General Assembly at its\r\nsixty-first session.\r\nThe members of the CPLP are introducing this\r\ndraft resolution to the Assembly for its consideration.\r\nOur delegations thank all Member States for\r\nconsidering the draft resolution. We hope that it will be\r\nadopted by consensus.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to the representative of Lebanon to introduce\r\ndraft resolution A/59/L.19.\r\nMr. Assaf (Lebanon) (spoke in French): I have\r\nthe honour to take the floor on behalf of the\r\nfrancophone group and the sponsors to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.19, entitled “Cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the International Organization\r\nof la Francophonie”.\r\nLebanon — which had the honour to host the\r\nNinth Summit of la Francophonie in 2002, devoted to\r\nthe theme “Dialogue of cultures” — remains faithful to\r\nits francophone heritage and will continue to play its\r\nrole in the International Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie (IOF).\r\nI should like to thank the Secretary-General for\r\nthe high quality of his report (A/59/303) submitted\r\nunder agenda item 56, entitled “Cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and regional and other\r\norganizations” — particularly section X of the report,\r\non the International Organization of la Francophonie. I\r\nshould also like to thank the Secretary-General of the\r\nIOF for his constant efforts to promote both the role of\r\nthe IOF and the development of its relations with the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe draft resolution before us was sponsored by\r\n77 countries. It includes a 10-paragraph preambular\r\npart and a 16-paragraph operative part. The preambular\r\npart reflects the importance of regional cooperation in\r\nmultilateral relations and the establishment and\r\ndevelopment of democracy, as well as respect for the\r\ndialogue among civilizations and for cultural and\r\nlinguistic diversity. It recalls the importance of the\r\nfight against poverty and the principles on which\r\ncooperation between the IOF and the United Nations is\r\nbased.\r\nThe operative part underscores the positive\r\nparticipation of the IOF in the work of the United\r\nNations and the cooperation between the two\r\norganizations in conflict prevention and other fields of\r\nmutual interest, as well as the role of the IOF in\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.50\r\ninternational conferences, under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe operative part also welcomes the fact that the\r\ntenth summit conference of la Francophonie will be\r\ndevoted to solidarity for sustainable development. It\r\nreflects the cooperation that exists between the IOF\r\nand the United Nations and between the IOF and the\r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations system to\r\npromote development and the elimination of poverty.\r\nLastly, on behalf of the sponsors, it is my\r\npleasure to invite the General Assembly to give its full\r\nsupport to draft resolution A/59/L.19.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now take a decision on draft resolutions\r\nA/59/L.5/Rev.2, A/59/L.11, A/59/L.14 and A/59/L.19.\r\nWe turn first to draft resolution A/59/L.5/Rev.2,\r\nentitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union”.\r\nSince the introduction of the draft resolution,\r\nCameroon has joined the list of sponsors.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/59/L.5/Rev.2 without a vote?\r\nDraft resolution A/59/L.5/Rev.2 was adopted\r\n(resolution 59/19).\r\nThe President (spoke in French): We turn now to\r\ndraft resolution A/59/L.11, entitled “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Pacific Islands\r\nForum”.\r\nI give the floor to the representative of the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Chief, General Assembly Affairs\r\nBranch, Department for General Assembly and\r\nConference Management): I would like to inform\r\nrepresentatives that in operative paragraph 17 of draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.11, the Assembly would call upon\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Human Rights to provide technical support to\r\nPacific Islands Forum members to contribute to the\r\nregional efforts in promoting awareness and knowledge\r\nof all international human rights treaties.\r\nIt is envisaged that this activity would be\r\nfinanced from extrabudgetary resources. Hence, the\r\nadoption of the draft resolution would not entail any\r\nadditional appropriation for the biennium 2004-2005.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Before taking\r\naction on draft resolution A/59/L.11, I would like to\r\ninform the Assembly that since its introduction, the\r\nfollowing countries have joined the list of sponsors:\r\nArmenia, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, the\r\nCzech Republic, Grenada, India, Indonesia, Iceland,\r\nIreland, Japan, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic,\r\nLithuania, Malaysia, Nepal, the Republic of Korea,\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, Suriname, Thailand and\r\nUkraine.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/59/L.11 without a vote?\r\nDraft resolution A/59/L.11 was adopted\r\n(resolution 59/20).\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.14 is entitled “Cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Community of Portuguese-\r\nspeaking Countries”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/59/L.14 without a vote?\r\nDraft resolution A/59/L.14 was adopted\r\n(resolution 59/21).\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.19 is entitled “Cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the International Organization\r\nof la Francophonie”.\r\nBefore we take action on the draft resolution, I\r\nwould like to inform the Assembly that, since its\r\nintroduction, the following countries have joined the\r\nlist of sponsors: Costa Rica, Liechtenstein and\r\nThailand.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/59/L.19 without a vote?\r\nDraft resolution A/59/L.19 was adopted\r\n(resolution 59/22).\r\nThe President (spoke in French): May I take it\r\nthat it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude\r\nits consideration of sub-items (i), (j), (q) and (t) of\r\nagenda item 56?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 10.10 a.m.\r\n"
