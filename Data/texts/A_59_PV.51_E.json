(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.55 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 39\r\nStrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian\r\nand disaster relief assistance of the United Nations,\r\nincluding special economic assistance\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/59/332)\r\n(a) Strengthening of the coordination of emergency\r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/59/93,\r\nA/59/374)\r\n(c) Assistance to the Palestinian people\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/59/121)\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.24)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): With regard to\r\nsub-item (b) of agenda item 39, “Special economic\r\nassistance to individual countries or regions”, I would\r\nlike to recall for the members of the General Assembly\r\nthat, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 58/316\r\nof 1 July 2004, the Assembly, on the recommendation\r\nof the General Committee, decided at its 2nd plenary\r\nmeeting, on 17 September 2004, to allocate this sub-\r\nitem to the Second Committee.\r\nI would also like to recall for members that, as\r\nindicated in the programme of work of the General\r\nAssembly and schedule of plenary meetings (document\r\nA/INF/59/3/Rev.1), sub-item (d) of agenda item 39,\r\n“Emergency international assistance for peace,\r\nnormalcy and reconstruction of war-stricken\r\nAfghanistan”, will be considered in a joint debate with\r\nagenda item 27, “The situation in Afghanistan and its\r\nimplications for international peace and security”, on\r\nWednesday, 8 December 2004.\r\nMr. van den Berg (Netherlands): I have the\r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU).\r\nThe candidate countries Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania\r\nand Turkey, the countries of the Stabilization and\r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Albania,\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro,\r\nand the European Free Trade Association (EFTA)\r\ncountry Iceland member of the European Economic\r\nArea, align themselves with this statement.\r\nThe issue of humanitarian coordination is at the\r\ncore of the ongoing debate about improving the quality\r\nand effectiveness of humanitarian aid. The EU, along\r\nwith others, has put coordination at the top of the\r\nhumanitarian agenda. However, the EU believes that\r\nhumanitarian coordination should not be limited to\r\nhumanitarian actors alone. An effective response to\r\ntoday’s humanitarian challenges requires us to broaden\r\nour view and to include political, military and\r\ndevelopment partners in our dialogue on humanitarian\r\nissues.\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nTurning to the issue of humanitarian\r\ncoordination, in humanitarian crises more than in other\r\nsituation, coordination is of paramount importance.\r\nGood coordination literally saves lives. I truly believe\r\nthat we can congratulate ourselves on the progress\r\nmade in this particular field in recent years. I refer to\r\nthe Consolidated Appeals Process and the way in\r\nwhich the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs (OCHA) has been taking the lead in\r\ncoordination matters. The European Union wishes to\r\nreiterate here its commitment to both the Consolidated\r\nAppeals Process and OCHA.\r\nMoreover, I would like to explicitly express our\r\nsupport for the Secretary-General’s Emergency Relief\r\nCoordinator, Jan Egeland, and his unwavering efforts\r\nnot only to deal with humanitarian suffering but to\r\nmake the rest of the world deal with it, too. His work in\r\nrelation not only to the Darfur crisis but also to\r\nnorthern Uganda and Colombia are very good\r\nexamples in that respect.\r\nThe Darfur crisis has not yet come to an end;\r\ntime is running out for even more people. During the\r\nmeeting of the Economic and Social Council, the\r\nEuropean Union commended attempts by the Office for\r\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to\r\nensure access for humanitarian organizations and\r\ncoordinated humanitarian action. We are currently\r\nseeing vastly improved access and far better\r\ncoordinated action. However, the human suffering in\r\nDarfur is still terrible, and progress is too slow. The EU\r\ncalls upon the Government of the Sudan and other\r\nparties to the conflict to better protect the civilian\r\npopulation. The European Union also urges the\r\ninternational community to do what we failed to do\r\nsufficiently in the beginning: make the relief operations\r\npossible financially.\r\nAs I said, coordination should be inclusive rather\r\nthan restricted to only some stakeholders. In recent\r\nyears, the discussion on humanitarian action and\r\ncoordination has mainly been a debate between United\r\nNations agencies and donor Governments. It is time for\r\nothers to join the debate in a more systematic way, so\r\nas to strive for more effective aid delivery and for more\r\nsustainable results.\r\nFirst, I would like to look at links between\r\nhumanitarian assistance and development cooperation.\r\nDevelopments in many countries and regions force us\r\nto do so. We have to make the transition from\r\nemergency aid to development in countries such as\r\nAfghanistan, Liberia and Angola, in order to give the\r\npeople of those countries a new perspective. Although\r\nwe realize that more needs to be done, when it comes\r\nto transition the European Union welcomes the work\r\ndone by the Joint Working Group on Transition Issues\r\nof the United Nations Development Group and the\r\nExecutive Committee on Humanitarian Affairs. Even\r\nmore than during the relief phase, during transition\r\nnational Governments should be given the opportunity\r\nand means to assume their responsibilities, and civil\r\nsociety should be given the chance and capacities to\r\nmake its own positive contribution to the rebuilding of\r\npost-conflict countries. If Governments and non-\r\ngovernment actors play those roles, the United Nations\r\nrole should be limited to support and capacity-building.\r\nClearly, more funding is required for transition\r\nand reconstruction purposes, if only to prevent\r\ncountries from reverting to conflict. Well-established\r\nfunding mechanisms, which exist for humanitarian and\r\ndevelopment purposes are lacking here. The European\r\nUnion is aware of that and is working on ways to\r\nimprove its performance in countries in transition. The\r\nEuropean Commission’s concept for linking relief to\r\ndevelopment will provide guidance in that regard.\r\nHumanitarian coordination must not only include\r\nnational and local Governments; equally important is\r\nthat the affected populations themselves are better\r\nlistened to by not only just the United Nations and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs), but also by their\r\nown Governments. Until now, in too many cases we\r\nhave all focused on working for, rather than working\r\nwith, the people. By better listening to and\r\ncoordinating with Governments, NGOs and affected\r\npopulations, and by building local capacities, we can\r\nensure better ownership and participation and increase\r\nthe chances for sustainable results.\r\nThe voices of NGOs, international as well as\r\nnational, can and should be better listened to, for\r\ninstance in the framework of the consolidated appeals\r\nprocess and the Common Humanitarian Action Plan.\r\nNGOs have often been present in crisis areas longer\r\nthan the United Nations and may have a better\r\nknowledge of tailor-made solutions for the population\r\nat risk. The European Union wants to build on NGO\r\nexperience and wants to further include them in\r\nhumanitarian coordination. One way of doing so might\r\nbe to ensure that discussions within United Nations\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\ncountry teams include all Inter-Agency Standing\r\nCommittee (IASC) partners whenever appropriate.\r\nUnited Nations integrated missions are one of the\r\nsymbols of improved and broadened coordination. The\r\nEuropean Union accepts the concept of integrated\r\nmissions as a more coherent and efficient approach to\r\ncrises. However, it is clear that such missions include\r\nthe risk of United Nations humanitarian action being\r\nperceived as part of a larger political agenda. The\r\nUnited Nations and its Member States must therefore\r\norganize integrated missions in such a way that there\r\ncan be no misunderstanding about the independent,\r\nimpartial and neutral character of the humanitarian part\r\nof a mission.\r\nThe security of humanitarian workers is at stake\r\nmore than ever before. We have to find answers to the\r\nnew security threats that we encounter in Iraq,\r\nAfghanistan and elsewhere. The changing security\r\nenvironment and the United Nations response to new\r\nsecurity challenges are extremely important for the\r\nfuture of humanitarian assistance. We have seen an\r\nunprecedented increase in attacks on relief workers and\r\nin the number of casualties, and the United Nations and\r\nNGOs have been forced to suspend their operations in\r\nvarious countries.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the opportunity to\r\ndiscuss that issue in the General Assembly. We\r\nacknowledge that, although the situation is more\r\nthreatening in some crises than in others, new threats\r\nneed to be taken into account worldwide. We therefore\r\nwelcome the work done by the United Nations to\r\nreassess the changing security situation and to come up\r\nwith new answers. However, the EU would urge that\r\nrisk management not turn into risk aversion. Risk\r\naversion will lead to a reduction of the United Nations\r\nresponse capacity and, hence, affect its credibility.\r\nIt is our firm belief that respect for international\r\nhumanitarian law is not only the best way to forestall\r\nthe suffering of innocent people in conflict, but also the\r\nbest protection for relief workers. For the safety of\r\nrelief workers, it is essential that humanitarian action\r\nand responsibility be clearly separated from military or\r\npolitical actors. Member States should therefore ensure\r\ncoherence between their humanitarian and military\r\npolicies and actions, both inside the United Nations as\r\nwell as outside, and should in general further the\r\ndebate between humanitarian and military actors. In\r\nthat respect, we welcome the new IASC reference\r\npaper on the civil-military relationship in complex\r\nemergencies.\r\nI should now like to say a few words on\r\nfinancing. The 2004 mid-year report of the OCHA\r\nhighlights a number of sobering trends in that respect.\r\nThus far in 2004, less humanitarian financing seems to\r\nhave been made available than during the previous two\r\nyears. Unfortunately, a new major crisis was required\r\nto increase the overall level of funding. We call upon\r\nall countries and Governments to help alleviate\r\nhumanitarian suffering and to transform their pledges\r\ninto payments.\r\nEven more important, from a coordination point\r\nof view, is the uneven distribution of funding, with\r\nsome appeals being better funded than others or one\r\nsector being better covered than others. That uneven\r\ndistribution justifies the United Nations call for more\r\nunearmarked funding, which in turn justifies our call\r\nfor better and comparable needs assessments. The\r\nEuropean Union, which is participating in the good\r\nhumanitarian donorship process, is deliberately looking\r\nfor ways to fund according to needs. In order to attract\r\nmore funding, United Nations agencies should better\r\ncoordinate, prioritize and ensure quality.\r\nEvery year natural disasters cause more victims\r\nand suffering than man-made crises. Moreover, there is\r\nreason to believe that in the future there will be an\r\nincrease in natural disasters such as floods and\r\ndroughts. For those reasons and others, the European\r\nUnion welcomes the renewed attention given to\r\ndisaster response by the Emergency Relief Coordinator.\r\nWe also support the work of the secretariat for the\r\nInternational Strategy for Disaster Reduction,\r\nespecially its endeavours to prepare for the Kobe\r\nconference on disaster reduction. We believe that the\r\ndecision to focus the conference on capacity-building,\r\npreparedness, coping mechanisms and ownership is a\r\nright one, because that will best limit damage and loss\r\nof lives in the long run. It is time to divert attention\r\nfrom disaster relief to disaster reduction, and to give an\r\nimportant role to national and local Governments and\r\nto people in disaster-prone areas themselves.\r\nThe European Union recognizes that the\r\ninternational community is failing to invest sufficiently\r\nin disaster preparedness and disaster reduction.\r\nInvesting in those areas might prove to be more cost\r\neffective than investing in disaster response. However,\r\nsuch investment should be accompanied by\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nGovernments giving priority to disaster-reduction\r\npolicies as well as to the implementation of those\r\npolicies.\r\nOn the issue of disaster response, the European\r\nUnion reaffirms the leading role played by OCHA, the\r\nUnited Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination\r\nStandby Team and the International Search and Rescue\r\nAdvisory Group. A collaboration arrangement between\r\nthe existing United Nations instruments and a new\r\nEuropean Union disaster response mechanism has\r\nrecently been worked out. We look forward to seeing it\r\nimplemented in the field.\r\nMr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): On\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, we would like to\r\nexpress to the Secretary-General our deep appreciation\r\nfor the documents submitted under sub-items (a) and\r\n(c) of agenda item 39, entitled, “Strengthening of the\r\ncoordination of humanitarian and disaster relief\r\nassistance of the United Nations, including special\r\neconomic assistance”, and in particular the report\r\ncontained in document A/59/374, entitled\r\n“International cooperation on humanitarian assistance\r\nin the field of natural disasters, from relief to\r\ndevelopment”.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China are of the opinion\r\nthat the report in document A/59/374 constitutes a\r\ngood basis for our discussion. The report was\r\nsubmitted pursuant to resolution 58/25, in which the\r\nAssembly requested the Secretary-General to submit a\r\nreport on the progress made in improving the\r\ninternational response to natural disasters and to update\r\nthe activities of the International Search and Rescue\r\nAdvisory Group in response to resolution 57/150 and\r\nother subsequent United Nations resolutions on the\r\nissue.\r\nThe problems posed by natural disasters are of\r\ncrucial importance to developing countries, given the\r\nlong-term nature of those disasters and their adverse\r\nimpact on affected populations and on the environment\r\nand on the social and economic development of\r\naffected countries. It is therefore crucial that we\r\nexamine the measures that must be taken to improve\r\nthe response capacity of affected countries and the\r\nassistance that the international community can\r\nprovide in that regard.\r\nIn that connection, I would like to emphasize that\r\nthe guidelines contained in the annex to resolution\r\n46/182, adopted on 19 December 1991, constitute the\r\nmain pillars for humanitarian assistance for the Group\r\nof 77 and China. As set out in that resolution, the\r\nprinciples of neutrality, humanity and impartiality are\r\nthe guidelines for all measures undertaken in providing\r\nhumanitarian assistance in natural disasters. It is\r\nessential that humanitarian assistance not be politicized\r\nand that it be provided at the request of concerned\r\nGovernments. Those principles have been, and\r\ncontinue to be, the basis for all responses to\r\nhumanitarian emergency requests for assistance. They\r\nshould therefore constitute the criteria by which we\r\nmeasure the effectiveness of the assistance of the\r\nUnited Nations and other actors.\r\nIn that context, the primary responsibility for the\r\norganization and delivery of humanitarian assistance\r\nshould fall on the States concerned. It is also\r\nfundamental to build strong capacities at the regional\r\nand national levels in order to strengthen cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and other humanitarian\r\nassistance organizations. The States whose populations\r\nare in need of emergency humanitarian assistance as a\r\nresult of natural disasters should endeavour to facilitate\r\nthe work of humanitarian organizations, in particular\r\nby safeguarding the delivery of food, shelter and\r\nmedical help.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has pointed out in his\r\nreport, the strengthening of the national response\r\ncapacity remains one of the most effective means of\r\ncarrying out rapid assessments of situations and\r\ncoordinating the initial response, given that local\r\nresponders are better able to overcome many obstacles\r\nthat can hinder rapid response in such disasters. While\r\nit may not be possible to prevent natural disasters,\r\nearly warning and preparedness could help mitigate\r\ntheir impact, particularly in terms of the human\r\nsuffering caused by natural disasters.\r\nThe use of space-based and remote-sensing\r\ntechnologies is particularly important in preventing,\r\nmanaging and mitigating natural disasters. There is\r\ntherefore an urgent need to promote access to and\r\ntransfer of technology related to early warning systems\r\nto developing countries affected by natural disasters. It\r\nis also of paramount importance to strengthen national\r\ncapacities, to transfer appropriate technologies and to\r\ndevelop early warning systems to avoid or minimize\r\nthe impact of natural disasters.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China would like to\r\nemphasize the need to ensure more equitable\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\ndistribution of humanitarian assistance across\r\nhumanitarian emergencies, including those of a\r\nprotracted nature. We have noted that the assistance\r\nprovided in emergency situations that enjoyed wide\r\nmedia coverage has been abundant. By contrast, as\r\nsoon as the media lights fade, resources tend to become\r\nscarce. That is particularly so in certain areas when the\r\nmore difficult task of recovery and reconstruction\r\nbegins. In that regard, the Group of 77 and China\r\nwould like to reiterate the importance of strengthening\r\ninternational cooperation, particularly through the\r\neffective use of multilateral mechanisms, to provide\r\nhumanitarian assistance during all phases of a disaster,\r\nfrom relief to mitigation to development, including\r\nthrough the provision of adequate resources. The\r\nGroup of 77 and China would also like to underscore\r\nthe importance of the international community’s fully\r\ntaking into account the specific needs of least\r\ndeveloped countries facing natural disasters.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China once again reaffirm\r\nthat voluntary contributions for humanitarian\r\nassistance should not impact negatively on the\r\nresources allocated to international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn accordance with the practice in previous\r\nsessions, the Group of 77 and China will submit a draft\r\nresolution on international cooperation in humanitarian\r\nassistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief\r\nto development. The Group of 77 is very pleased at the\r\ngrowing support that that draft resolution has received\r\nand looks forward to the growing international\r\nconsensus around that issue this year. That consensus\r\nconstitutes a message of hope to those affected by\r\nnatural disasters every year.\r\nMs. Rouse (Grenada): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the member States of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) on this agenda item.\r\nCARICOM, while aligning itself with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of Qatar on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China, would like to make the\r\nfollowing additional remarks.\r\nCARICOM would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his reports on this agenda item and also\r\nMr. Jan Egeland, Under-Secretary-General for\r\nHumanitarian Affairs, for his presentation to the\r\nGeneral Committee yesterday.\r\nThe Caribbean region has been devastated by\r\nhurricanes in the past few months. From Trinidad and\r\nTobago in the south to the Bahamas in the north, hardly\r\nany State has been left untouched. The Bahamas and\r\nCuba were each struck by more than one hurricane,\r\nwhile Jamaica suffered extensive property damage and\r\neconomic losses. However, the two countries in our\r\nregion that were most severely affected were Grenada\r\nand Haiti.\r\nIn Haiti, extensive flooding caused by Hurricane\r\nJeanne in Gonaives resulted in the loss of more than\r\n1,900 lives and affected 90 per cent of the population\r\nin that city. Gonaives became completely cut off, and\r\nthere were widespread shortages of food, water, shelter\r\nand other basic necessities of life. Fortunately, as we\r\nall know, the United Nations already had a strong\r\npresence in Haiti, and the various agencies were able to\r\nmobilize themselves quickly and provide essential\r\nsupplies of food and water as well as emergency\r\nshelter for the affected population.\r\nGrenada suffered major destruction as a result of\r\nthe passage of Hurricane Ivan on 7 September and\r\nexperienced a most horrifying period thereafter.\r\nNeighbouring Caribbean nations reached out helping\r\nhands to Grenada, but the magnitude of the devastation\r\nin that country is beyond the capacity of the Caribbean\r\nto address satisfactorily by itself.\r\nIn a matter of hours, Grenada went from being a\r\nmiddle-income developing country with a well-run\r\nadministrative State machinery to a ravaged land. It is\r\nironic as well as lamentable that it took this disastrous\r\nhurricane season to reinforce the point that the small\r\nisland developing States have been making for some\r\ntime — namely the need for special and differential\r\ntreatment because of, among other things, our\r\nvulnerability to natural disasters.\r\nThe United Nations agencies in the Caribbean\r\nresponded quickly and efficiently to the regional\r\nemergencies. The Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA) performed its\r\ncoordinating role commendably, while the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO), the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) and the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) also\r\nreacted to the immediate needs of the people.\r\nThe Flash Appeal organized at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters on 24 September, targeted at helping\r\nHaiti and Grenada, was instrumental in highlighting\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nthe problems as well as procuring assistance for these\r\ntwo nation-States.\r\nWe are hopeful that the monies pledged to both\r\ncountries by the Flash Appeal as well as the donors’\r\nconference in Washington, D.C., will be disbursed as\r\nquickly as practicable. When the fabric of a country is\r\ndestroyed, help is needed immediately — not only to\r\nprovide emergency aid to the population, but also to\r\nstart the reconstruction process. CARICOM proposes\r\nthat the United Nations should seek to enhance the\r\nmeans of accessing and utilizing funds promised by the\r\ndonor community to countries in crisis.\r\nWe believe, based on the Grenada experience,\r\nthat it is crucial for the United Nations agencies in the\r\nregion to have a mechanism that will enable a more\r\ntimely implementation of programmes and a more\r\nrapid disbursement of funds.\r\nGiven the importance of this issue, we would also\r\nlike to call for enhanced cooperation and collaboration\r\nbetween the United Nations agencies in the Caribbean\r\nand the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response\r\nAgency (CDERA), which is the agency responsible for\r\ndisaster management in the Caribbean.\r\nThe United Nations and its agencies have\r\nprovided, over time, critical help for CARICOM\r\ncountries affected by natural disasters. UNDP has\r\nsupported disaster mitigation, capacity-building and\r\ninstitutional strengthening in support of Montserrat’s\r\npost-emergency resettlement programme. CARICOM\r\nis grateful for the support received over time, and this\r\nstatement is intended to reflect not only that gratitude\r\nbut also the hope that the suggested mechanism of\r\nenhanced cooperation and collaboration with our\r\nregional agencies will benefit the peoples in our\r\nregion.\r\nMr. Wali (Nigeria): Let me start by expressing\r\nmy country’s profound condolences to the Palestinian\r\npeople on the untimely death of their leader, Chairman\r\nYasser Arafat. May the Almighty God be with the\r\nPalestinian people, and may light perpetual shine upon\r\ntheir fallen hero.\r\nTurning to the issue before us today, and speaking\r\non behalf of the African Union, I should like to\r\nwelcome the ongoing efforts of the United Nations\r\naimed at strengthening the coordination of emergency\r\nhumanitarian assistance. For us in Africa, the\r\nunenviable record of conflicts on the continent\r\nunderscores the importance attached to policy\r\ncoherence and coordination among both donors and\r\nUnited Nations agencies in the delivery of\r\nhumanitarian assistance. The pivotal role of the Office\r\nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)\r\ncannot be overemphasized.\r\nWe in Africa continue to lament the existence of\r\na serious gap between relief and development, which\r\nmust be addressed in order to ensure a smooth\r\ntransition from humanitarian emergency assistance to\r\npost-conflict reconstruction and development. We\r\ncontinue to lament also the lack of adequate local\r\ncapacities to ensure that the long-term needs of the\r\naffected population continue to be addressed.\r\nThe past decade has witnessed increasingly\r\nviolent conflicts and complex humanitarian challenges.\r\nIn the face of these realities, the African Union has\r\nundertaken institutional and political reforms to\r\naddress those challenges on the continent in the\r\nframework of its Constitutive Act and the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). The\r\nefforts of the African Union in Burundi and, more\r\nrecently, in the Darfur region of the Sudan, through the\r\nestablishment of the Ceasefire Commission and the\r\nexpanded African mission in the Sudan, are clear\r\ndemonstrations of the renewed commitment of African\r\nleaders for the African Union to assert itself on the\r\ncontinent.\r\nIt is therefore with great anticipation that we\r\nawait the release in a few weeks of the report of the\r\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change,\r\nwith the expectation that many of the issues\r\nhighlighted in today’s debate will be duly addressed.\r\nIn discussing this important agenda item, one\r\ncannot but be reminded of the tragic events which\r\nunfolded in Rwanda in 1994 and which clearly\r\nrequired emergency humanitarian intervention on the\r\npart of the international community. The consequences\r\nof our failed efforts continue to haunt us even today\r\nthrough the eyes of the survivors, such as orphans,\r\nwidows and victims of sexual violence, as well as\r\npeople afflicted with HIV/AIDS.\r\nLast year, in this very Hall, the Assembly,\r\nthrough a well-celebrated commemorative ceremony,\r\nrenewed the hope of both victims and survivors by\r\nsending a clear message that the international\r\ncommunity has not forgotten, and will not forget, the\r\ntragic events of Rwanda, and that, more importantly,\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nthat the international community will ensure that such\r\nheinous acts will never again be repeated in Africa or\r\nin any other part of the world.\r\nIt will be recalled that it was on the basis of an\r\nAfrican Union resolution that this world body\r\nunanimously adopted resolution 58/234, by which it\r\ndesignated 7 April as the International Day of\r\nReflection on the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda. In the\r\nsame resolution the Assembly\r\n“Encourages all Member States,\r\norganizations of the United Nations system and\r\nother relevant international organizations to\r\nconsider promoting implementation of the\r\nrecommendations contained in the report of the\r\nIndependent Inquiry into the actions of the United\r\nNations during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda”.\r\nBuilding on that General Assembly resolution,\r\nthe Executive Council of the African Union, at its\r\nsession in Addis Ababa last July, adopted Decision\r\nEX.CL/Dec.l54(V) in which it requested the African\r\nUnion and the United Nations to implement the\r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the\r\nInternational Panel of Eminent Personalities\r\ncommissioned by the Organization of African Unity,\r\nand those contained in the report of the Independent\r\nInquiry into the actions of the United Nations during\r\nthe 1994 Rwanda genocide, commissioned by the\r\nSecretary-General — also known as the “Carlsson\r\nreport”.\r\nIt is therefore in that connection that I wish to\r\nbring to the fore of this debate today, under this agenda\r\nitem — which we in the African Union believe to be\r\nthe most appropriate forum — and to advocate the\r\nplight of the survivors of the 1994 genocide in\r\nRwanda, particularly the orphans, widows and victims\r\nof sexual violence. The African Union is convinced\r\nthat effective and well-resourced programmes to assist\r\nthe survivors would not only restore their dignity but\r\nwould help promote reconciliation and healing in\r\nRwanda.\r\nAt this juncture I should like to express, on behalf\r\nof the African Union, appreciation to the donor\r\ncommunity and United Nations agencies for the\r\nassistance provided to the Government and people of\r\nRwanda since the 1994 genocide.\r\nThe African Union intends to table a resolution\r\nunder this agenda item in the weeks ahead, aimed at\r\nensuring that adequate assistance is directed towards\r\nsupport for the genocide survivors in Rwanda. The\r\nAfrican Union would appreciate the support of the\r\ninternational community, as was the case last year.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China): The Chinese\r\ndelegation would like to thank the representative of\r\nQatar for the statement he delivered on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China. The Chinese delegation also\r\nwishes to thank the Secretary-General for the reports\r\nhe has submitted under this item and contained in\r\ndocuments A/59/93, A/59/332 and A/59/374, among\r\nothers. China also takes this opportunity to express its\r\nappreciation to the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which under the\r\nleadership of Under-Secretary-General Jan Egeland has\r\nmade great efforts to coordinate the humanitarian\r\nassistance of the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation has observed that in his report on\r\nstrengthening the coordination of emergency\r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations\r\n(A/59/93), the Secretary-General cited many facts and\r\nfigures in his overview and assessment of such\r\nassistance for the past year. The report noted that\r\nnatural disasters remain a global threat and that\r\nfrequent armed conflicts and the plight of tens of\r\nmillions of refugees and internally displaced persons,\r\ncoupled with the threat posed by the rampant spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS, have made humanitarian assistance even\r\nmore challenging.\r\nThe increase in recent years in the diversity of\r\nhumanitarian actors, including armed forces, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and private sector entities,\r\nhighlights the need to strengthen coordination. It\r\nshould be emphasized that in providing humanitarian\r\nassistance to the affected countries, the United Nations\r\nand the international community should be guided by\r\nthe principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality\r\nestablished in the annex to General Assembly\r\nresolution 46/182, and that such assistance should be\r\nprovided at the request and with the consent of the\r\naffected country, whose wishes, culture and customs\r\nshould be respected.\r\nNatural disasters and complex emergency\r\nsituations have led to an increased demand for\r\nhumanitarian assistance. Adequate funding is the\r\nprerequisite for carrying out assistance activities. The\r\nUnited Nations Inter-agency Consolidated Appeal\r\nProcess has played an important role in humanitarian\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nfunding. However, we are concerned that in recent\r\nyears there has been a steady decline in resources\r\nmobilized through that channel and hope that OCHA\r\nwill step up its efforts in that respect. At the same time,\r\nwe appeal once again to the donor countries that are\r\nable to do so to make greater contributions to\r\nhumanitarian assistance.\r\nThe safety and security of United Nations\r\nhumanitarian personnel has become a subject of\r\ngrowing concern. Since last year, United Nations\r\npersonnel engaged in humanitarian assistance have\r\ncontinued to come under attack and have even been\r\ntaken as hostages and detained for long periods. In the\r\nbomb attack on the United Nations office in Iraq last\r\nyear, 24 United Nations personnel, including the\r\nSecretary-General’s Special Representative for Iraq,\r\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, made the ultimate\r\nsacrifice, while many others were injured. The United\r\nNations suffered devastating losses in that incident.\r\nThe Chinese delegation strongly condemns such\r\nterrorist acts.\r\nIn August this year, China acceded to the\r\nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and\r\nAssociated Personnel. Following that, the Chinese\r\nGovernment has taken part in activities that promote\r\nthe safety of United Nations personnel pursuant to the\r\nprovisions of the Convention. China will work with\r\nother States parties in fulfilling its treaty obligations.\r\nChina is a disaster-prone country that is\r\nfrequently hit by earthquakes, floods, droughts and\r\nother disasters, suffering heavy losses as a result. Last\r\nyear, China suffered a direct economic loss of over $20\r\nbillion due to the effects of natural disasters. In spite of\r\nthat, the Chinese Government has, within its\r\ncapabilities and through bilateral channels, provided\r\nemergency and humanitarian relief goods such as food,\r\nmedicines, mosquito nets, tents and blankets to\r\ndeveloping countries affected by disasters. Last year,\r\nChina’s rescue team joined the search and rescue\r\nefforts in Bam, Iran, in the aftermath of an earthquake.\r\nThese assistance activities have fully demonstrated our\r\ncompassion for, and solidarity and friendship with, the\r\naffected Governments and peoples.\r\nThe Chinese delegation supports the proposal by\r\nthe Secretary-General with regard to the transition\r\nfrom relief to development in humanitarian assistance\r\nfor natural disasters. The proposal will help increase\r\nthe capacity of the affected countries in their\r\nrehabilitation and reconstruction efforts.\r\nIn areas such as disaster management and\r\nimproving search and rescue capabilities, we are ready\r\nto share our experiences and information with other\r\ncountries with a view to enhancing international\r\ncooperation in those fields.\r\nIn conclusion, the Chinese delegation would like\r\nto thank OCHA for the attention and assistance it has\r\ngiven to disaster-affected areas in China over the past\r\nyear. We offer our support for the recent initiative by\r\nMr. Egeland on building partnerships with Asian\r\ncountries in order to enhance international cooperation\r\nin disaster relief.\r\nMr. Baum (Switzerland) (spoke in French):\r\nSwitzerland attaches particular importance to the\r\ndiscussion on strengthening the coordination of\r\nhumanitarian aid. All Member States and observers are\r\nthus given the opportunity to undertake a necessary\r\nexchange of views on the essential areas of United\r\nNations action. We note that the general trends\r\nanalysed by the Secretary-General in his report have\r\nbeen confirmed by the facts to date. Allow me to refer\r\nto some of the cases of greatest concern, in which\r\nawareness of the problem and the will to act remain\r\nslow, in the view of my delegation.\r\nFirst, humanitarian organizations’ unconditional\r\naccess, without obstacles, to people in distress must be\r\nguaranteed. We must find ways of improving, in a\r\ntangible way and without delay, the protection of\r\ncivilian populations, particularly women and children.\r\nWe also need to strengthen cooperation between the\r\nvarious bodies of the United Nations, while at the same\r\ntime respecting their individual mandates.\r\nSecondly, with regard to the management of the\r\nsecurity system of the United Nations as a whole, the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General correctly stresses the\r\nshortcomings of the system currently in place, which\r\ndoes not allow the Organization to effectively deal with\r\nall of the challenges that it must face. We would like to\r\npoint out that it is, first and foremost, the host\r\nGovernment that must ensure that security is sufficient.\r\nMoreover, we see that the humanitarian imperative to\r\nease suffering wherever it occurs has led agencies and\r\nhumanitarian organizations to increase their exposure\r\nto risk, at the cost of the unacceptable loss of many\r\nlives. In this respect, we stress the importance of basic\r\nand ongoing training in matters of security at all levels\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nand throughout the United Nations system, and we\r\nwould urge that security system management be\r\nincluded in the regular budget of the Organization. We\r\nwould also urge that attacks against humanitarian staff\r\nbe condemned with the utmost firmness, and that those\r\nguilty be punished according to national provisions and\r\ninternational obligations, such as the provisions of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC).\r\nThirdly, we are convinced that one of the most\r\neffective ways to improve in a sustainable way the\r\nprotection of civilian populations, as well as the\r\nsecurity of staff, property and buildings of\r\nhumanitarian organizations, involves respecting,\r\nwithout exception, the provisions of international\r\nhumanitarian law. Both State and non-State parties\r\nmust at all times respect and ensure the respect of\r\nevery provision of the Geneva Conventions.\r\nSwitzerland calls upon all States that have not yet done\r\nso to ratify the additional protocols to the above-\r\nmentioned conventions, as well as the Rome Statute of\r\nthe ICC.\r\nWe would like to reiterate the singular nature of\r\nhumanitarian action, which must remain based on\r\nuniversally recognized principles of impartiality,\r\nneutrality and independence. In that respect, two\r\nconcrete issues merit our attention.\r\nFirst, protection and assistance activities must be\r\nplanned, implemented and assessed by civilian\r\nhumanitarian staff, and in that connection we invite\r\nthese humanitarian staff with a specific protection\r\nmandate to strengthen that mandate. We also have to\r\ntake due account of the specificity of humanitarian\r\naction in setting up the so-called integrated missions of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nSwitzerland attaches high priority to the\r\nqualitative improvement of the coordination of\r\ninternational humanitarian action by means of the\r\nInter-Agency Standing Committee, particularly by\r\ndeveloping joint methodologies for assessing needs, by\r\nestablishing strict behavioural norms for humanitarian\r\nstaff and by integrating HIV/AIDS awareness in the\r\nagendas of humanitarian organizations. We particularly\r\nwelcome the recent conclusion and current\r\ndissemination of the operational guidelines for resident\r\ncoordinators and country teams for the implementation\r\nof a collaborative approach in dealing with internal\r\ndisplacement.\r\nFinally, we support the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendations, according to which a direct\r\nconceptual link must be established between, on the\r\none hand, the response in the case of natural and man-\r\nmade disasters, and on the other, the strengthening of\r\nprevention and preparation activities in emergency\r\nsituations. National authorities bear the primary\r\nresponsibility in those efforts and that must be stressed,\r\nas must the need to involve all stakeholders in\r\npreparation and prevention, if we are to attain\r\nsustainable results. The World Conference on Disaster\r\nReduction, which will be held in Kobe in January\r\n2005, represents a unique opportunity to increase\r\nawareness at all levels.\r\nMr. Siv (United States): I thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his thorough and wide-ranging reports on\r\nhumanitarian assistance. He has recognized our\r\nsuccesses as an international community and has also\r\npointed out where we continue to fall short of\r\nexpectations.\r\nLast year, I optimistically spoke in the Assembly\r\nof a glimmer of hope for the future of the Sudan. While\r\nI still hope that peace is possible, I despair at the\r\ncontinuing humanitarian tragedy in Darfur. Villages\r\nhave been burned and hundreds of thousands displaced.\r\nWomen have been raped. Men, women and children\r\nhave been killed. Civilians have been taken hostage.\r\nBoth parties to the conflict have obstructed\r\nhumanitarian access. The Sudanese Government has\r\nforcibly relocated civilians from camps for internally\r\ndisplaced persons. This is in direct contravention of\r\ninternational humanitarian law and Security Council\r\nresolutions 1556 (2004) and 1564 (2004).\r\nUnited Nations agencies, non-governmental\r\norganizations, the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross and others are carrying out admirable work to\r\nsave lives in Darfur. The United States has contributed\r\nover $300 million in humanitarian aid to Darfur and\r\neastern Chad since the beginning of the conflict. This\r\nalready exceeds our pledges for the entire fiscal year,\r\nand we will give more. We applaud the decision of the\r\nSecurity Council to meet in Nairobi to highlight the\r\nneed for the conflicting parties in the Sudan to restore\r\npeace to the country. We continue to support the work\r\nof the African Union and its efforts to expand its\r\nmonitoring presence in Darfur.\r\nHowever, we must work together to provide far\r\nbetter protection for civilians. A lack of coordination\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\namong United Nations agencies on the ground in\r\nemergency situations continues to plague humanitarian\r\nefforts in the Sudan and elsewhere. We encourage the\r\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and United Nations\r\nagencies to establish clear leadership in assisting and\r\nprotecting internally displaced persons. We commend\r\nthe establishment of the Inter-Agency Internal\r\nDisplacement Division within OCHA. That will\r\nprovide clear leadership in meeting the unique\r\nhumanitarian needs of the internally displaced.\r\nIn addition to United States financial support for\r\nthe Division, last month the United States Agency for\r\nInternational Development finalized its policy on\r\nassistance to internally displaced persons. It is our\r\nintention to ensure that that policy statement will both\r\nreaffirm our commitment to meeting the needs of such\r\npersons and enhance the coordination and reliability of\r\nthe response, both within our Government and in the\r\ngreater humanitarian community.\r\nThe United States applauds the work being done\r\nby humanitarian workers throughout the world, who\r\nbring hope and life to people in need. We lament the\r\nloss of two NGO staff in the Sudan during the past\r\nmonth. The United States appreciates the attempt by\r\nUnited Nations agencies to balance the crucial need to\r\nprovide for the safety and security of humanitarian\r\npersonnel with the need to reach victims of\r\nemergencies. That and other challenges have led my\r\ncountry to contribute to the independent evaluation of\r\nthe impact of integrated humanitarian aid missions that\r\nis being jointly managed by OCHA and the Department\r\nof Peacekeeping Operations. We look forward to\r\nlearning from the results of that study in early 2005.\r\nAs we begin humanitarian negotiations during the\r\nfifty-ninth session of the General Assembly, let us take\r\nsteps aimed at alleviating humanitarian crises and\r\nreducing the effects of natural disasters throughout the\r\nworld.\r\nMr. Løvald (Norway): The concept of integrated\r\nmissions for United Nations peace operations has a\r\nnumber of important dimensions. In my intervention\r\ntoday, I will focus on the humanitarian dimension,\r\nclosely linked, as it is, with the safety and security of\r\nhumanitarian personnel.\r\nNorway supports the integrated-mission\r\napproach. We see it as a way of creating greater\r\ncoherence in the activities of the United Nations,\r\nmaking it more effective in managing crises, in\r\nrestoring peace and security and in creating stability\r\nand good governance in failed or failing States. The\r\nmilitary and civilian police elements of such missions\r\nhave a crucial role in establishing security, which is an\r\nessential precondition for the delivery of humanitarian\r\nassistance.\r\nWe have already gained some experience in\r\nmission integration, although we lack a clearly defined\r\nmodel. It is probably neither possible nor desirable to\r\nestablish a rigid organizational template for integrated\r\nmissions. Mission design must be adapted to the\r\nparticular circumstances in a given area. Integration\r\nprovides a sense of direction, but it needs to be\r\npractised wisely if we are to make full use of the skills\r\nand competencies of the various parts of the United\r\nNations system in the humanitarian, development and\r\npeacekeeping areas.\r\nThe recent experience of integrated missions in a\r\ncountry such as Liberia has caused concern in the\r\nhumanitarian community. While some of the tension\r\nobserved may be specific to that situation, the debate\r\nhas brought to the surface the inherent dilemma of how\r\nto maximize the gains from integration while\r\nminimizing its costs to the humanitarian role of the\r\nUnited Nations. Several questions need to be asked. Is\r\nit at all possible to have a clear command and control\r\nstructure while at the same time separating\r\nhumanitarian or development operations from the\r\npolitical and military elements? Should integrated\r\nplanning at the Headquarters level be the upper limit of\r\nour ambition? If not, how can we ensure that the\r\nnecessary space for humanitarian action is maintained\r\nwithin an integrated mission framework in field\r\noperations?\r\nWe appreciate the Organization’s awareness of\r\nthe urgent need to profit from lessons learned and to\r\nidentify best practices. Norway would like to commend\r\nthe expanded core group of the Executive Committee\r\non Humanitarian Affairs for initiating a joint\r\nindependent study of issues relating to the interface\r\namong peacekeeping, humanitarian and development\r\nactivities in integrated missions. As a major\r\nhumanitarian actor, the United Nations must itself\r\nensure that humanitarian action is in line with the\r\nfundamental principles of impartiality, independence\r\nand neutrality. The Organization cannot risk\r\ncompromising those principles by having humanitarian\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\naction too closely associated with a military or political\r\nmission.\r\nIn our view, the more active a conflict is, the\r\nstronger is the case for maintaining a clear and visible\r\ndistinction between humanitarian agencies, on the one\r\nhand, and the political and military parts of a United\r\nNations operation, on the other. The way in which the\r\nparties involved perceive that distinction has a direct\r\nbearing on the security of humanitarian personnel.\r\nProtection measures can certainly be taken to increase\r\nthe security and safety of humanitarian workers, but\r\nsuch measures may also reduce the workers’ access to\r\nthose who need their protection and assistance. The\r\nsupport and confidence of the local population and of\r\nthe parties to the conflict have traditionally been the\r\nbest protection for humanitarian workers. The new\r\nsafety and security measures are not likely to\r\ncompensate for the loss of such legitimacy.\r\nThe serious deterioration in the situation of\r\nhumanitarian workers in places such as Afghanistan\r\nand Iraq has made them deliberate targets — “soft\r\ntargets” — for actors with violent political agendas. In\r\nthat respect, this year’s report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/59/93) is no less alarming than last year’s, which\r\npointed out “a disturbing trend of blatant disrespect for\r\nhumanitarian work” (A/58/89, para. 11). The\r\ninternational community cannot ignore those serious\r\nchallenges.\r\nThere is a need for greater awareness of the\r\npractical dilemmas and risks that are likely to arise in\r\nthe interface between military and humanitarian action\r\nin the field. Norway appreciates the work done in the\r\nUnited Nations to develop generic and specific\r\nguidelines for such interaction. The focus should now\r\nbe on bridging the gap between those guidelines and\r\nmilitary doctrine and practice.\r\nWhen military personnel perform humanitarian or\r\nreconstruction projects to win over the hearts and\r\nminds of the local population, there is a risk of blurring\r\nmilitary and humanitarian roles, which can give rise to\r\nmisconceptions regarding humanitarian work. In our\r\nview, the United Nations must organize its missions in\r\nsuch a way that they can contribute to the maintenance\r\nand, where necessary, to the restoration of a\r\nhumanitarian space. That is no less important when\r\nhumanitarian action takes place alongside non-United\r\nNations peacekeeping or multilateral forces.\r\nNorway has been a staunch supporter of a strong\r\nUnited Nations role in the coordination of all\r\nhumanitarian action in a crisis area. We must not get to\r\nthe point where the humanitarian community outside\r\nthe United Nations prefers not to be associated with a\r\nUnited Nations mission because the mission may be\r\nperceived as undermining basic humanitarian\r\nprinciples. Integrated missions could drive a wedge\r\nbetween United Nations and non-United Nations\r\nhumanitarian agencies, which could be a serious\r\nsetback to the Organization’s lead role in the\r\nhumanitarian field. Weakening international\r\ncoordination would also have a broad negative impact\r\non the humanitarian cause.\r\nThe Consolidated Appeals Process (CAP) plays a\r\nkey role in enhancing the position of the United\r\nNations in the coordination of humanitarian assistance,\r\nbut that is contingent upon the involvement of all\r\nrelevant actors. In cases where the CAP is replaced by\r\nmechanisms that also address transitional and long-\r\nterm issues, it is vital that the development of a\r\ncommon humanitarian action plan be inclusive. A\r\ncommon understanding of the humanitarian context, of\r\nneeds assessments and of the roles and responsibilities\r\nof all humanitarian actors is essential if coordination is\r\nto be effective.\r\nWe welcome the forthcoming United Nations\r\nlaunch of a work plan for the Sudan for 2005. That is a\r\npositive step but, in the present phase of the peace\r\nnegotiations and peace planning, it is important to\r\navoid duplication in the planning and coordination\r\nprocesses. It is therefore critical that the United\r\nNations work plan be produced and launched in\r\npartnership with all relevant actors.\r\nThe future of the concept of integrated missions\r\ndepends upon whether such missions can in practice\r\nreconcile the fulfilment of the various mandates of\r\ntheir component parts with a more coherent United\r\nNations response in the field, thereby producing the\r\ndesired impact on the overall peace process. A more\r\ncoherent response is not in and of itself a sufficient\r\ncriterion for judging the success of an integrated\r\nmission. The manner in which the humanitarian\r\ncomponent is integrated has broad ramifications that\r\nextend beyond the peace process in question. An open\r\nand honest debate on those issues should be\r\nencouraged.\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nMr. Ravi (India): We would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for the reports presented under this\r\nitem and for the useful introduction provided by the\r\nUnder-Secretary-General of the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\r\nWe associate ourselves with the statement made\r\nby the representative of Qatar on behalf of the Group\r\nof 77 and China.\r\nBefore making my substantive comments on the\r\nagenda item under discussion today, I should like to\r\npay tribute to the memory of President Yasser Arafat,\r\nleader of the Palestinian people for almost four\r\ndecades. I had the privilege of meeting Yasser Arafat\r\nduring his visit to India in the mid-1980s. Like millions\r\nof others around the world, I too was struck by his\r\ncharismatic leadership. On behalf of India, and on my\r\nown behalf, I join others in conveying condolences to\r\nthe Palestinian leadership and the members of the\r\nbereaved family.\r\nThe number of countries requiring humanitarian\r\nassistance as a result of complex emergencies has\r\nremained constant over the past year. The overall\r\nrequirements for humanitarian assistance remain at\r\napproximately the same level as in previous years. We\r\nnote with concern, however, that the pattern of funding\r\nhumanitarian activities remains uneven, leaving some\r\ncountries substantially under-financed. The case of the\r\nCentral African Republic, which received only 5 per\r\ncent of its requirements in 2003, is the most glaring\r\nexample of that. That underscores the importance of\r\nallocating resources fairly to all countries in need. The\r\nUnited Nations should be seen to be above\r\nhumanitarian favouritism and seen as not forgetting\r\nthose humanitarian emergencies that no longer have the\r\nbenefit of the so-called CNN effect. In order to do that,\r\nthe United Nations must avoid regional imbalances and\r\nuneven funding of humanitarian needs. Only then will\r\nuniversal trust in the United Nations system be\r\npreserved.\r\nThe allocation and availability of resources for\r\nhumanitarian assistance remain matters of vital\r\nconcern. We therefore support the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendation inviting donors to continue efforts to\r\nmake available increased amounts of earmarked\r\nfunding for relief assistance. We also support the need\r\nfor some predictability in the funding provided for\r\nhumanitarian activities. However, situations of\r\nhumanitarian emergencies are mostly unpredictable.\r\nHow funding can be provided for such activities on a\r\ntotally predictable basis therefore remains unclear.\r\nThe problems associated with the way\r\nhumanitarian assistance and humanitarian actors are\r\nperceived have emerged as an area of concern in recent\r\nyears. Continuing attacks on humanitarian workers in\r\nsome situations of conflict have caused those questions\r\nto be of growing concern to the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community. Attacks on humanitarian\r\npersonnel must be condemned as unjustified.\r\nThe report also notes that warring parties must\r\nrecognize the neutral and impartial nature of\r\nhumanitarian action. That is understandable. However,\r\nfor that to happen, United Nations humanitarian action\r\nshould not only be neutral, but also be seen to be\r\nneutral. We would underscore the need for broad\r\ntransparency, accountability and a democratic\r\nintergovernmental process of debate and agreement.\r\nHumanitarian assistance should strictly abide by the\r\nbasic principles of neutrality, humanity and\r\nimpartiality, as set out in Assembly resolution 46/182.\r\nHumanitarian action should also be apolitical and\r\noffered at the request of the recipient Government.\r\nThose principles should also hold good for integrated\r\nmissions. The concern of the Secretary-General on the\r\nquestion of access in providing humanitarian assistance\r\nis well placed. However, the issuance of visas, travel\r\npermits and custom clearances fall within the purview\r\nof the national Governments.\r\nGiving humanitarian action a local face could be\r\nhelpful in conveying the right message behind the\r\nhumanitarian action. Humanitarian assistance\r\npersonnel should in the main be hired with the\r\nprinciple of geographical proximity in mind and with\r\ndue attention paid to the importance of the familiarity\r\nof the personnel with the location and nature of a given\r\ncrisis. That could be done by including personnel who\r\nbelong to the area or who have prior experience with\r\nsimilar emergencies. Both the efficiency and the\r\nperception of humanitarian action might be improved\r\nin that way. The report also speaks of the need for\r\nhumanitarian personnel to be sensitive to local customs\r\nand traditions. Local resources, procured locally or\r\nfrom the neighbourhood, and the use of locally hired\r\ntransport would be seen as a positive measure by\r\nrecipients of humanitarian assistance, apart from\r\nbuilding capacity locally and reducing time delays.\r\nRegional approaches, where possible or applicable,\r\nmight also be useful.\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nFor humanitarian assistance to be effective in\r\nsituations involving a multiplicity of actors, the\r\ncoordination function should not be allowed to\r\noverwhelm humanitarian action on the ground, lest the\r\nformer should become the most important\r\npreoccupation of the humanitarian effort. Where such\r\ncoordination becomes necessary, the national\r\nGovernment would be best placed to coordinate\r\nhumanitarian assistance. We would also underscore the\r\nneed to fully respect the principle of national\r\nsovereignty.\r\nMr. Haraguchi (Japan): Although there have\r\nbeen some positive developments in the field of\r\nhumanitarian assistance, such as the repatriation of a\r\nlarge number of refugees, serious humanitarian crises\r\nand disaster spots still remain — and are in some cases\r\neven increasing in various parts of the world. It is\r\nreally moving to hear of the assistance activities being\r\ncarried out by brave and kind-hearted humanitarian\r\nworkers in those places. However, it is becoming all\r\nthe more urgent for us to find an effective answer to\r\nthe question of how we are to maintain humanitarian\r\nassistance activities in high-risk environments in which\r\nhumanitarian workers are increasingly exposed to\r\ndanger.\r\nWe believe it is time to re-examine the basic\r\nobjectives of our humanitarian assistance under the\r\ncurrent circumstances. Given the enormous needs and\r\nthe limited resources available, I am afraid our\r\nhumanitarian assistance would not be sustainable, if its\r\nbasic objective were simply to perpetually provide\r\npeople in distress with the necessary assistance. In our\r\nview, our humanitarian assistance must be geared\r\ntoward creating a situation in which people can live\r\nwithout assistance. Let me elaborate a little on that\r\npoint.\r\nWe believe that a proper combination of\r\nownership on the part of the people in need and\r\npartnership on the part of the outside supporters is the\r\nkey to creating a situation where humanitarian\r\nassistance eventually becomes unnecessary. The sense\r\nof ownership derives from the fact that the people\r\nthemselves own their lives, dignity and future;\r\npartnership on the part of the international community\r\nstems from the belief it has the duty to help those in\r\ndire straits who are trying to help themselves. Our\r\nhumanitarian assistance should not become a one-way\r\ntransaction, with charity going from donors to\r\nrecipients. In our view, it should be based on joint\r\nundertaking between donors and recipients as equal\r\npartners. We have learned from our experience that the\r\nproactive participation of recipients in the planning and\r\nimplementing phases of humanitarian assistance makes\r\nthat assistance more effective.\r\nFor example, there have been cases in which we\r\nassigned traditional leaders a central role in the\r\nmanagement of refugee camps at the suggestion of the\r\nrefugees themselves. Those leaders turned out to be\r\nquite successful. I believe that that kind of approach is\r\nvery much in line with the concept of human security\r\nthat Japan has been promoting, one that tries to protect\r\npeople in distress and encourage them to develop a\r\nsense of ownership of their destiny and to empower\r\nthem, in response to their ownership, through\r\npartnership. Of course, that approach has to be\r\npromoted in close collaboration with the Government\r\nof the country concerned.\r\nThere are several points that I consider important\r\nin making this approach successful. The first is the\r\nneed to expand the base of the partnership. The number\r\nof actors should be increased to include as many as\r\npossible of those who participate in humanitarian\r\nassistance activities on the basis of shared\r\nhumanitarian considerations. Humanitarian assistance\r\nneed not and should not be the monopoly of developed\r\ncountries. South-South cooperation should also be\r\nexplored. That is why Japan enthusiastically supports\r\nUnder-Secretary-General Jan Egeland’s efforts to\r\nexpand partnership, particularly with Asian countries.\r\nThe second is the need to go down into the field.\r\nTo carry out humanitarian assistance effectively, we\r\nalways have to be attentive to the concrete needs of\r\npeople on the ground, unfettered by prejudice. In that\r\ncontext, we attach importance to frank dialogue with\r\npeople in need. By doing so, we believe we will be\r\nable to understand the real, specific and concrete needs\r\nof people in distress and foster their sense of\r\nownership. For example, it was because of such frank\r\ndialogue that Japan started contributing to the school\r\nfeeding programme of the World Food Programme. We\r\nfound that the programme very well matched the actual\r\nneeds of the people because it benefited the local\r\ncommunity three times: by purchasing agricultural\r\nproducts from the local community, by providing meals\r\nto children at school and by giving them additional\r\nmeals to eat at home.\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nThirdly, in order to provide humanitarian\r\nassistance that leads to reconstruction, development\r\nand, eventually, a durable solution to a humanitarian\r\ncrisis, a holistic approach is needed, with close\r\ncollaboration among those engaging in conflict\r\nprevention, peace-building and development. It is\r\nessential to overcome the so-called gap between\r\nemergency relief and reconstruction. Recognizing that,\r\nJapan is now, for example, undertaking a\r\ncomprehensive regional development programme\r\ncalled the Ogata Initiative in one region of\r\nAfghanistan. That programme aims at making a\r\nseamless transition from relief to development. In\r\nadopting such a holistic approach, we believe it is\r\nimportant that the experience and know-how of the\r\nUnited Nations country team be fully respected. Close\r\ncoordination between peacekeeping operations and\r\nhumanitarian and reconstruction efforts is\r\nindispensable, and the activities of a country team\r\nunder a resident coordinator or a humanitarian\r\ncoordinator should be fully utilized in such coordinated\r\nefforts, with due consideration of the costs and\r\nbenefits.\r\nSo far, I have been discussing assistance to the\r\nvictims of man-made miseries. However, we should not\r\nforget that there are also natural disasters such as\r\nfloods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, droughts,\r\ntyphoons, hurricanes and cyclones. Sometimes,\r\nhundreds of thousands of people lose their lives or\r\ntheir livelihoods. We also need to be prepared to\r\nmitigate the damage caused by natural disasters. Japan\r\nis to host the United Nations World Conference on\r\nDisaster Reduction in Kobe next January. At the\r\nconference, we hope to discuss desirable ways of\r\nsharing the experiences and know-how of each country\r\nwith a view to strengthening the resilience of nations\r\nand communities in the face of disasters and ways of\r\nfostering partnership among the participating countries,\r\ninternational agencies and stakeholders.\r\nWe need to discuss humanitarian principles more\r\nactively at the United Nations, with a view to\r\nproviding appropriate guidance to the relevant\r\nhumanitarian actors. But it is meaningless to repeat the\r\nsame discussions in the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. One idea would be to\r\ngive each organ a different focus. For example, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council might aim at providing\r\nguidance to United Nations agencies in discharging\r\ntheir humanitarian mandates, and the General\r\nAssembly might strive to discuss fundamental values\r\nto be shared in humanitarian assistance. That is just\r\none idea. We welcome other innovative ideas on\r\nrevitalizing our work in the field of humanitarian\r\nassistance and hope to deepen our discussion in order\r\nto achieve more effective humanitarian activities.\r\nMr. Al-Shamsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): At the outset, I would like, on behalf of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates, to extend my sincerest\r\ncondolences to the brotherly people of Palestine, its\r\nleadership and the family of the late President Yasser\r\nArafat. We reaffirm the support of the United Arab\r\nEmirates for the Palestinian people and leadership in\r\ntheir efforts to realize their legitimate rights and goals\r\nof establishing an independent State in Palestine.\r\nI associate myself with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China. I also thank the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations for his valuable report on the topic of\r\nhumanitarian assistance. We fully agree with the\r\nconclusions of the report on the tragic humanitarian\r\nconditions of millions of people around the world and\r\nthe challenges and dangers facing relief assistance\r\noperations.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates would like to express\r\nits appreciation for the work done by the United\r\nNations in the field of humanitarian and relief\r\nassistance and wishes to underline the principal role of\r\nthe United Nations in monitoring and evaluating\r\nhumanitarian and relief assistance. We support the\r\nrecommendations contained in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General, especially those related to helping\r\npoor countries build their national institutional\r\ncapacities and to establishing the necessary\r\ncoordination among all humanitarian assistance\r\norganizations in order to meet the challenges and\r\ndangers posed by natural disasters and wars, by means\r\nof an international strategy to deal with natural\r\ndisasters at all stages, from early warning to relief,\r\nreconstruction and development.\r\nIn that context, we urge the donor countries and\r\nthe international financing institutions to increase their\r\ncontributions in order to fund humanitarian and relief\r\nactivities in fulfilment of the principles of international\r\nsolidarity and interdependence, and the United Nations\r\nCharter. In the meantime, we emphasize the importance\r\nof strengthening the authority and role of international\r\nlaw in settling disputes and eliminating the causes of\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\narmed conflicts, which all cause humanitarian\r\ndisasters. We also reaffirm the importance of taking the\r\nnecessary measures to protect humanitarian personnel\r\nand to compensate them for any losses they incur.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General outlines the\r\ntragic humanitarian situation in the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories, where more than 3,000 innocent\r\ncivilians were killed as a result of continuing random\r\nmilitary attacks by the Israeli occupation forces. The\r\nreport also refers to the curfews and closures imposed\r\nby the Israeli occupation forces, which have resulted in\r\nhuge losses to the Palestinian economy.\r\nIsraeli practices included the construction of an\r\nexpansionist wall, land confiscation and the destruction\r\nof wells, all of which led to an increase in the levels of\r\nunemployment, poverty and internally displaced\r\npersons. The latter have reached 16,000 persons,\r\nunemployment has reached 30 per cent and those living\r\nunder poverty levels amount to nearly 63 per cent.\r\nTwenty-two per cent of Palestinian children also suffer\r\nfrom malnutrition. On the basis of this we again call\r\nupon the international community to intervene\r\ndecisively, to end the humanitarian tragedy that the\r\nPalestinian people are living under, to force Israel to\r\ncease immediately its military attacks and to end the\r\npolicy of closures and siege of Palestinian towns and\r\ncities.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates notes with grave\r\nconcern the difficulties and dangers that personnel\r\nworking in delivering humanitarian assistance are\r\nfacing, particularly the Palestinians who face problems\r\nin providing this assistance because of the violence and\r\nthe constraints of Israeli forces restricting mobility. We\r\ncall upon Israel to provide protection for those who\r\nwork in humanitarian assistance organizations, and to\r\nfacilitate the work in accordance with international law\r\nand treaties.\r\nIn recognizing the importance of humanitarian\r\nand development assistance and of promoting security\r\nand peace in the world, the United Arab Emirates has\r\nfulfilled all of its financial obligations to the United\r\nNations humanitarian assistance activities, the last of\r\nwhich was a contribution of $1,028,000 to\r\nreconstruction next year, as well as providing\r\n$30 million for reconstruction in Afghanistan and\r\n$215 million for reconstruction in Iraq. Aside from\r\nthat, the United Arab Emirates provided direct\r\ndevelopment assistance to many developing countries\r\nthrough its national organizations, such as Abu Dhabi\r\nDevelopment Fund, which provided a total assistance\r\nof $29 billion in 2002 to 56 countries all over the\r\nworld. The commitment of the United Arab Emirates to\r\nprovide emergency, long-term humanitarian assistance\r\nto areas affected by natural disasters and armed\r\nconflicts around the world was manifested in many\r\nactivities, such as the operation of Emirates Solidarity,\r\nwhich succeeded in removing 60,000 landmines from\r\n5 million square metres in South Lebanon and turned\r\nthem into arable and inhabitable lands. The United\r\nArab Emirates Red Crescent Society is the largest non-\r\ngovernmental agency in the country engaged in\r\nproviding relief and foreign assistance to affected\r\ncountries. It has provided a total assistance of\r\n$1 billion to more than 95 countries during the last\r\n4 years. The United Arab Emirates Red Crescent\r\nSociety provides directly and through the United\r\nNations humanitarian agencies, relief and development\r\nassistance to countries affected by armed conflicts as\r\nwell as to post-conflict countries, the latest of which\r\nwas the reconstruction project of Jenin refugee camp.\r\nThe Society is also preparing to build 200 houses in\r\nRafah in Gaza. The Dubai Relief City, which was\r\nestablished in 2003 for the purpose of providing\r\nintegrated services and facilities to national and\r\ninternational humanitarian organizations, is a clear\r\nmanifestation of our commitment to support\r\ninternational efforts aimed at coordinating and\r\nenhancing global humanitarian assistance. Preparations\r\nare presently underway for the second Dubai\r\nInternational Conference on International Aid in April\r\n2005. I also look forward to the World Conference on\r\nDisaster Reduction, which will be held in Japan in\r\nJanuary 2005. We hope it will lead to strengthening\r\ninternational efforts aimed at mitigating natural\r\ndisasters around the world.\r\nMrs. Barghouti (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nWe learned today with great sadness of the passing of\r\nour President and leader, Yasser Arafat. We very much\r\nappreciate this gesture of holding a meeting this\r\nafternoon at the General Assembly during which all\r\ndelegations will be able to present their condolences.\r\nWe would have hoped to be able to present to this\r\nAssembly a more optimistic and positive picture of the\r\neconomic, social, cultural and environmental situation\r\nin the occupied Palestinian territories, including East\r\nJerusalem, while examining the item relating to\r\nassistance to the Palestinian people. But, unfortunately,\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nthe situation of occupied Palestine is deteriorating day\r\nby day. We are risking an economic and humanitarian\r\ncatastrophe, if the international community does not\r\nfind rapid solutions in all areas and at all levels to put\r\nan end to this ongoing tragedy.\r\nIt is clear that the root causes for the deterioration\r\nin the current situation in occupied Palestine are\r\nessentially the continuing Israeli occupation, the\r\ncreation of barriers, blockages, colonial expansionism,\r\nconfiscation of land and the building of the\r\nexpansionist wall, and the resultant confiscation of\r\nthousands of dunams of land and the ruining of the\r\nlives of thousands of Palestinians. Since September\r\n2000, Israel has intensified its bloody war against the\r\nPalestinian people. That has led to about 3,500 deaths\r\nand 50,000 injuries; a lot of these people are\r\npermanently injured and cannot lead normal lives.\r\nFurthermore, the occupation forces have bombarded\r\nand destroyed a great number of public and private\r\nbuildings, uprooted trees, and intentionally damaged\r\nthe infrastructure, including roads and water and\r\nsanitation networks.\r\nThese Israeli practices against the Palestinian\r\npeople are considered war crimes and flagrant\r\nviolations of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which\r\nrequires that the international community renew its\r\nefforts to put pressure on Israel to end the occupation\r\nand to apply its commitments in conformity with the\r\nprovisions of the Convention. Israel should abide by\r\nthe international will, which is asking it to stop its\r\naggression, its destruction and its racist, expansionist\r\npolicy. In this respect, we must underscore the\r\nindividual and collective responsibility of the\r\nContracting Parties to the Convention to ensure that the\r\nprovisions of the Convention are respected and\r\nimplemented in all areas.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General contained in\r\ndocument A/59/121 refers in detail and\r\ncomprehensively to the difficult situation facing the\r\nPalestinian people and the economic and humanitarian\r\ncrises they are experiencing, which increases their\r\nsuffering and creates difficulties in meeting their basic\r\nneeds. The report also points to the problem of\r\nunemployment and the increasing levels of poverty,\r\nwhich have reached over 63 per cent in the West Bank\r\nand 75 per cent in the Gaza Strip. The report also refers\r\nto the fact that Israel has methodically imposed\r\nrestrictions on the movement of goods and people\r\nwithin Palestine and across borders. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral himself states in paragraph 11 that that\r\ncontinues “to be the proximate cause of the Palestinian\r\nhumanitarian and economic crises”.\r\nThe report also stresses in paragraph 9 that the\r\noccupying forces continue “to inflict daily hardship\r\nand humiliation on Palestinians, through closures,\r\ncurfews, house demolitions, targeted assassinations,\r\nsettlement activities, the use of deadly weapons in\r\nhighly populated areas and the use of disproportionate\r\nforce”.\r\nWe are particularly concerned about the actions\r\nof the occupying forces against the institutions of the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies, including\r\nthe obstacles and difficulties they impose upon\r\norganizations that are trying to provide essential\r\neconomic and humanitarian assistance to the\r\nPalestinian people. The report points out that the\r\noccupying forces are imposing restrictions on the\r\nfreedom of movement of United Nations staff and are\r\nobstructing humanitarian assistance, the result being\r\nthat such assistance must be scaled back or completely\r\nhalted. In fact, United Nations agencies are rendering\r\nassistance to the Palestinian people under very difficult\r\nconditions as a result of the measures employed by the\r\noccupying forces — assistance and support that the\r\nPalestinian people urgently need. In that regard, we\r\nagree with the report’s observation, in paragraph 85,\r\nthat “the significance of the United Nations agencies\r\nand their role in the occupied Palestinian territory has\r\nnever been greater — nor has there ever been a time\r\nwhen it has been more difficult to operate”.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation would like to take\r\nthis opportunity to express its gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report and for his efforts to\r\nsupport the Palestinians and their just cause. I would\r\nalso like to convey our deep appreciation for the role of\r\nthe United Nations and its relevant agencies in\r\nproviding humanitarian and economic assistance to the\r\nPalestinian people, which undoubtedly contributes to\r\nalleviating their pain and suffering.\r\nMy delegation would like in particular to thank\r\nour brothers and sisters in Arab countries who have\r\ntaken in the seriously wounded and provided medicines\r\nand emergency medical assistance, as well as for their\r\ngreat assistance in safeguarding the structure and\r\nfunctioning of the Palestinian Authority and in\r\nproviding assistance to the Palestinian people in\r\ngeneral. We also extend our thanks to all friendly\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nStates, to the European Union and Japan in particular,\r\nfor having provided us with humanitarian assistance\r\nand for having supported our people in general. In\r\naddition, we thank all the donor countries and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations that have provided\r\nemergency humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian\r\npeople.\r\nIn that regard, we must firmly confront all Israeli\r\nmeasures against donor States and bodies, including\r\nassassinations and attacks carried out by Israel against\r\nthe staff and headquarters of humanitarian agencies.\r\nThe international community must provide protection\r\nfor those extending assistance, in line with\r\ninternational humanitarian law.\r\nI would like to add that just and lasting peace and\r\nstability in the region in general essentially requires\r\nnot only the full withdrawal of Israel from the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories, including East Jerusalem and the\r\nGolan, but also the exercise by the Palestinian people\r\nof their right to self-determination and to establish a\r\nsovereign State on their own territory. If that does not\r\nhappen, there will be no possibility of making progress\r\nin the peace process. Nor will we be able to talk about\r\nregional development or regional cooperation with\r\nIsrael, the occupying Power. We wish to underscore the\r\nimportance of the role of the United Nations in\r\nbringing about just and lasting peace on the basis of its\r\npermanent responsibility with respect to the Palestinian\r\nissue.\r\nI would like to conclude my statement by quoting\r\nagain from the report of the Secretary-General. In\r\nparagraph 87 he states:\r\n“Humanitarian and financial assistance will\r\nnot by themselves serve as a solution to the\r\npolitical crisis affecting the lives of the\r\nPalestinians and Israelis. A solution regarding the\r\nstatus of the Palestinian people, as well as the\r\neconomic situation and humanitarian crisis, is\r\nlinked directly to respect for international law\r\nand the achievement of a peaceful resolution of\r\nthe conflict.”\r\nMr. Zoumanigui (Guinea) (spoke in French): I\r\nwould first of all like to convey the condolences of my\r\ndelegation to the Palestinian people and to the family\r\nof the deceased President Arafat. We hope that God\r\nwill be merciful on him and that his soul will rest in\r\npeace.\r\nAllow me to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nreports (A/59/93 and A/59/374) on the strengthening of\r\nthe coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation supports the statement made by\r\nthe representative of Qatar on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China, as well as the statement by the\r\nrepresentative of Nigeria on behalf of the African\r\nUnion. I would now like to make a few comments in\r\nmy national capacity.\r\nThe importance of considering this agenda item,\r\nwhich stems from resolution 46/182, led world leaders\r\nto underscore, in the Millennium Declaration and\r\nelsewhere, the importance of protecting vulnerable\r\npopulations suffering from natural disasters, genocide,\r\narmed conflict and other humanitarian emergencies.\r\nOur consideration of the reports of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral makes it possible for us to both catalogue the\r\nconsequences of natural disasters and underscore the\r\nresponsibilities of the international community and of\r\nregional, subregional and national actors in the areas of\r\ndisaster prevention and management. In that regard,\r\nmy delegation is pleased at the diversity of actors who\r\nprovided humanitarian assistance during the past year.\r\nWe should now assess their efforts in order to ascertain\r\nbest practices.\r\nWith regard to the transition from relief to\r\ndevelopment, we commend the drafting of a report by\r\nthe Joint Working Group on Transition Issues. We\r\nagree that United Nations bodies should define\r\ncommon measures to help United Nations country\r\nteams to collate and plan the principal elements of a\r\ntransition strategy.\r\nWith respect to the issue of gender imbalance and\r\nprotection against sexual exploitation and abuse, we\r\nwelcome the consideration of establishing a network of\r\nstructures that lead to awareness-raising measures,\r\nwhile at the same time using legal instruments and\r\ntherapy. It is my delegation’s view that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s bulletin (ST/SGB/2003/13) on special\r\nmeasures for protection from sexual exploitation and\r\nsexual abuse is a handbook that should guide all the\r\nhumanitarian actors.\r\nOn the same subject, implementation in the field\r\nof a complaint procedure is an encouraging step\r\nforward. This is also the case with the elaboration and\r\nlaunching by the Department of Peacekeeping\r\nOperations of a gender resource package for people\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nworking in peacekeeping. We also note with interest\r\nthe importance of catastrophe prevention, as referred to\r\nin the report.\r\nThis year, the choice of the theme, “Learning\r\nfrom today’s disasters for tomorrow’s hazards”, within\r\nthe context of the celebration of the International Day\r\nfor Disaster Reduction, should further mobilize the\r\ninternational community in the prevention and\r\nmanagement of disasters. For that reason, my\r\ndelegation supports the Secretary-General’s suggestion\r\nthat national capacities for planning and prevention be\r\ndeveloped in countries affected by natural disasters,\r\nand we welcome the creation by United Nations bodies\r\nof the so-called virtual centre for the coordination of\r\nfield operations.\r\nWith respect to the question of the security of\r\nUnited Nations and associated personnel and the staff\r\nof humanitarian organizations, as well as access to\r\nhumanitarian aid for beneficiaries, we stress once again\r\nthe obligation on all parties to respect the relevant\r\nGeneral Assembly and Security Council resolutions.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General on the obligation\r\nof parties to conflicts and local actors to respect the\r\nneutral, impartial nature of humanitarian operations\r\nbeing led by humanitarian actors. In return, however,\r\nthese actors should take better account of the local\r\ndynamics and reassure the local population of the\r\nprinciples underlying their actions.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to pay due\r\nhomage to United Nations and associated personnel\r\nand to the staff of humanitarian organizations for the\r\ncourage, devotion and determination they demonstrate\r\nin carrying out their tasks, often in very difficult and\r\ndangerous circumstances.\r\nThe diversity of the humanitarian actors and the\r\nmultidimensional character of the questions to be\r\naddressed require that there be better coordination\r\nwithin the United Nations system on the one hand, and\r\non the other, between the United Nations and the other\r\nactors, namely, intergovernmental humanitarian\r\norganizations and regional, subregional and national\r\norganizations. Furthermore, the questions underlying\r\nthe financing of humanitarian actions are of great\r\nconcern despite the improvements that are taking\r\nplace.\r\nWe note with satisfaction the proposal to increase\r\nthe scope of use of the Central Emergency Revolving\r\nFund and support the Secretary-General’s proposal to\r\nincrease the ceiling to $100,000 allocated to a country\r\nthat has suffered a disaster.\r\nOnce again, we appeal to donors to continue their\r\nefforts in mobilizing resources for disaster prevention,\r\nas well as for relief to victims of disaster. In that\r\ncontext, we fully support the solemn appeal by the\r\nrepresentative of the African Union for the\r\nexamination and adoption by consensus in the plenary\r\nof the draft resolution on the victims of the genocide in\r\nRwanda.\r\nWith respect to complex emergency situations,\r\nmy delegation welcomes the reference made to the\r\nWest African region and to the consideration of an\r\nintervention at the subregional level. The Assembly\r\nwill understand my delegation’s position because it is\r\nknown that countries emerging from conflict in that\r\nregion — that is, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau\r\nand Côte d’Ivoire — share a common frontier with my\r\ncountry, which since 1989 has continued to provide a\r\ngenerous welcome to refugees. Above all, the\r\nhumanitarian, social and economic, environmental and\r\nsecurity consequences faced by Guinea as a result of\r\nthis influx of refugees have been aggravated by the\r\nrebel attacks of 2000 coming from our frontiers with\r\nLiberia and Sierra Leone.\r\nAware of the requirements for peace, security and\r\ngood cooperation, the Government of Guinea has\r\nalways been involved in the search for solutions to\r\nconflicts and the consolidation of peace for the benefit\r\nof all the people of the subregion. The holding in\r\nConakry, on 20 May 2004, of a summit of the heads of\r\nState of the Mano River Union, which was enlarged to\r\ninclude the heads of State of Mali and Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nwas a reflection of that determination.\r\nAt the international level, the Government has\r\ncontinued to appeal to the international community to\r\nfind a viable solution to the humanitarian consequences\r\nstill facing my country. While the meeting of the\r\nconsultative group on Guinea in Paris on 25 and\r\n26 June 1998 — organized by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and the World\r\nBank — and the 9 July 1998 Day of Solidarity with\r\nGuinea, organized in New York by the Department of\r\nPolitical Affairs and UNDP, were encouraging signs, it\r\nshould be pointed out that there has not been\r\nappropriate follow-up at the international level. In that\r\ncontext, my delegation would like to emphasize that\r\nthe Republic of Guinea, which remains faithful to its\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nAfrican humanism and respects its international\r\ncommitments, will continue to demonstrate\r\nunderstanding in the management of conflicts in the\r\nsubregion and the humanitarian questions on its own\r\nterritory.\r\nHowever, my delegation wishes to stress that the\r\ninternational community should follow the example of\r\nGuinea, which has fulfilled its duties of responsibility-\r\nand burden-sharing, and assume its responsibilities and\r\nconfront current challenges. Today, the south-east of\r\nGuinea continues to be a subject of concern for my\r\nGovernment. We hope that the international\r\ncommunity, and the United Nations in particular, will\r\nnot delay in contributing to the search for a durable\r\nsolution in order to prevent the whole subregion from\r\nbeing affected.\r\nFinally, it should be said that the consequences of\r\nnatural and man-made disasters affect millions of\r\npeople, particularly the vulnerable — namely, women,\r\nchildren and the elderly. They are the involuntary\r\nvictims of tragedies and they require all our assistance.\r\nWe welcome the inclusion of an item on limiting the\r\nconsequences of natural disasters in the agenda for the\r\ninternational meeting for the 10-year review of the\r\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action.\r\nWe continue to believe that the meeting — and\r\nalso the World Conference on Disaster Reduction to be\r\nheld in Kobe, Japan, from 18 to 22 January 2005 —\r\nwill have a positive outcome. My country, the Republic\r\nof Guinea, which has particular interest in this issue,\r\nwill be present at those meetings and will not fail to\r\nmake its contribution.\r\nMr. Ercin (Turkey): At the outset, I would like to\r\nextend our profound condolences to the Palestinian\r\npeople on the grave loss of their leader.\r\nTurkey associates itself with the statement\r\ndelivered by the representative of the Netherlands on\r\nbehalf of the European Union on the agenda item that\r\nwe are discussing today. I would like to expound on\r\nsome of our views, particularly with respect to the\r\nSecretary-General’s report entitled “International\r\ncooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of\r\nnatural disasters, from relief to development”,\r\ncontained in document A/59/374.\r\nPremature loss of life due to natural disasters\r\ncontinues to affect a great number of people\r\nworldwide, hitting vulnerable groups particularly hard.\r\nAs indicated in the report of the Secretary-General, it\r\nis estimated that in 2003 and 2004 natural disasters\r\nclaimed the lives of 75,000 people, affected more than\r\n284 million people and caused more than $65 billion\r\nworth of material damage. We should pause a moment\r\nand consider that we are talking about human lives\r\nhere, not just numbers.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General emphasizes,\r\nthis year again, the disturbing upward trend in the\r\noccurrence and impact of natural disasters. The\r\nSecretary-General also underlines the fact that natural\r\nand man-made emergencies will continue to increase in\r\ntheir regularity and intensity owing to current trends in\r\nurbanization, environmental degradation and climate\r\nchange. It is becoming more obvious than ever that,\r\nwithout coordinated efforts to improve preparedness\r\nand response and address risk and vulnerability, the\r\neffects of disasters on people and human settlements\r\nwill become more deadly and costly.\r\nIt is incumbent upon every responsible member\r\nof the international community to join forces in\r\ntackling these challenges. In fact, given the nature of\r\ntoday’s interconnected world, there is no alternative to\r\nthat approach. My country has been a keen supporter of\r\nincreased international cooperation in countering such\r\nemergencies.\r\nTurkey finds itself, in its geography, prone to\r\nnatural disasters, in that Mother Nature has repeatedly\r\ndisplayed in our country the less friendly side of her\r\nstrength and ferociousness. The massive earthquakes in\r\n1999 led to great human and material losses. On the\r\nbright side, however, there were positive outcomes as\r\nwell. Recognizing their shared vulnerability and the\r\nvirtue in pooling their efforts together, Turkey and\r\nGreece established the Joint Hellenic Turkish Standby\r\nDisaster Response Unit (JHET-SDRU) to provide\r\ntimely and effective humanitarian assistance when\r\nnecessary.\r\nAmong the lessons drawn from the 1999\r\nearthquakes was the recognition of the importance of\r\nstrengthening international urban search and rescue\r\nassistance and rendering it more effective. With that in\r\nmind Turkey assumed the responsibility of presenting a\r\nnew resolution on this topic to the fifty-seventh session\r\nof the General Assembly in 2002. Resolution 57/150\r\nwas the product of long and lengthy deliberations and\r\ndiscussions. Operative paragraph 9 of General\r\nAssembly resolution 57/150 requests the Secretary-\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nGeneral to submit a comprehensive, updated report\r\nwith recommendations on progress in the improvement\r\nof efficiency and effectiveness in the provision of\r\ninternational urban search and rescue assistance, taking\r\ninto account the extent of utilization of the Guidelines\r\nof the International Search and Rescue Advisory\r\nGroup.\r\nWe would like to thank the Secretariat for the\r\nSecretary-General’s combined report contained in\r\nA/59/374, which was prepared pursuant to General\r\nAssembly resolutions 58/25 and 57/150. We welcome\r\nall the efforts to streamline the work of the United\r\nNations, and we consider that compilation of reports on\r\nsimilar issues is a positive step in that direction, as\r\nlong as these reports strive to reflect all the\r\ndevelopments and the progress made on the issues at\r\nhand.\r\nThe merits of the report are evident. Nonetheless,\r\nafter very careful consideration, we have concluded\r\nthat the relevant parts of the report fall short of our\r\nexpectations. In our opinion, it is not as comprehensive\r\nas we would have wished. Indeed, important\r\ndevelopments that have taken place on international\r\nurban search and rescue operations since 2002 are not\r\nadequately reflected in the report. For instance, more\r\ninformation could have been provided for the activities\r\nof the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group\r\n(INSARAG); it would have been useful to include\r\nreferences to the standardization of the INSARAG\r\nguidelines. The measures taken to overcome\r\nadministrative difficulties in search and rescue\r\noperations should have been mentioned in a more\r\ndetailed manner.\r\nSome general recommendations are not sufficient\r\nto contribute to improving the effectiveness and\r\nefficiency of international urban search and rescue\r\noperations.\r\nIn addition, the late issuance of the report left\r\nvery little time for Member States to form their\r\npositions. For that reason, we decided not to rush to\r\nsubmit a resolution on urban search and rescue\r\nassistance. Instead of repeating the resolution 57/150\r\nwording once again, we will work, with the\r\ncooperation of all parties concerned, to review what\r\nhas been done so far in this period; take stock of\r\nrelated activities; and consider to formulate a draft\r\nresolution that will focus on progress in the\r\nimprovement of efficiency and effectiveness in the\r\nprovision of international urban search and rescue\r\nassistance, particularly taking into account the extent\r\nof utilization of the INSARAG Guidelines.\r\nMr. Adel (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): We would\r\nlike to support the statement of the representative of\r\nQatar on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and the\r\nstatement of the representative of Nigeria on behalf of\r\nthe African Group. I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for presenting the documents on this very\r\nimportant and vital issue on our agenda, to which\r\nEgypt attaches special importance.\r\nPromoting the coordination of humanitarian\r\nassistance extended by the United Nations in cases of\r\ndisaster, including special economic assistance, should\r\nbe a main priority of the United Nations and other\r\nrelevant United Nations organizations and specialized\r\nagencies. Egypt reaffirms once again that supporting\r\nand building the institutional capacities of countries\r\nrequires the support and coordinating of cooperation\r\nbetween the different systems working in the area of\r\nhumanitarian assistance to face natural disasters and\r\nthe impact of wars and conflicts. This is carried out\r\nthrough implementation of a comprehensive method\r\nfor dealing with natural disasters in all areas, starting\r\nwith the early warning phase, followed by the relief\r\nphase, then by reconstruction and development. Egypt\r\ncalls upon all donor States and international financing\r\ninstitutions to increase their contribution to provide\r\nrelief and humanitarian assistance. This is so not only\r\nin response to the magnitude of crises and disasters in\r\nthe last few years, but also in implementation of the\r\nprinciple of international solidarity and\r\ninterdependence and in implementation of the spirit\r\nand letter of the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe reports of the Secretary-General (A/59/93\r\nand A/59/374) affirm that natural disasters and\r\nenvironmental emergencies constitute a grave danger\r\nthat threatens the poorest people in the world. In the\r\nyear 2003, 700 natural disasters occurred, which led to\r\nthe death of 75,000 people, and economic losses that\r\nexceeded $75 billion. This rate of casualties is nearly\r\nseven times that of the previous year.\r\nOn the other hand, we would like to note that the\r\npattern of financing humanitarian assistance is still not\r\nadequate, since a number of adversely impacted\r\ncountries got only five per cent of their needs in 2003.\r\nI have provided these examples and figures to clarify\r\nthe extent of the gap between the number of disasters\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nand suffering and what is available at the moment in\r\nterms of humanitarian assistance.\r\nIn this context, my delegation calls upon the\r\nrelevant organizations and donor States to take into\r\nconsideration the recommendations contained in the\r\ntwo reports of the Secretary-General, also, to support\r\nthe current preparatory work for the United Nations\r\nWorld Conference on Disaster Reduction, which will\r\nbe held next January in Japan, and to use the\r\nopportunity provided by the Conference to reaffirm\r\nonce again the policies of disaster reduction and its\r\npromotion.\r\nThere can be no doubt as to the imperative need\r\nfor the provision of humanitarian assistance, a task\r\nundertaken by the United Nations in many parts of the\r\nworld. However, it is a task fraught with risk and\r\ndifficulties. It requires that ways and means be found\r\nto safeguard the safety and security of United Nations\r\nstaff and of personnel working for humanitarian\r\nassistance organizations, so that they can fully carry\r\nout their duties.\r\nWe have noted with increasing concern, as stated\r\nin the Secretary-General’s report (A/59/332), the\r\ncontinuous exposure of United Nations personnel to\r\nrisks that include kidnapping, physical violence,\r\nrobbery, theft, intimidation and long-term detention. A\r\nnew and more dangerous pattern has emerged, as\r\nmanifested in the direct attack on United Nations\r\nheadquarters that occurred in Baghdad in August last.\r\nEgypt believes that there is an urgent need for the\r\nUnited Nations to take an active role in expanding and\r\nsafeguarding protection for those who work in the area\r\nof humanitarian assistance, and it emphasizes the fact\r\nthat such protection should not be merely legal in\r\nnature. We must concentrate on promoting the political\r\nwill of States, whether or not there is a host country\r\nagreement with the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation looks forward to receiving the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General next year on this issue\r\nconcerning the establishment of the necessary\r\nstructures, arrangements and capacity-building to\r\npromote the effectiveness of the United Nations\r\nsecurity system.\r\nI shall now touch on ways of providing assistance\r\nto the Palestinian people. I should like to begin by\r\nextending my sincere condolences on the passing of\r\ntheir late President and leader, Yasser Arafat. His\r\npassing is not a loss only to the Palestinian people but\r\nto the world as a whole. I am fully confident that the\r\nPalestinian people and their new leadership will spare\r\nno effort in working to restore their right to live like\r\nthe rest of humankind — as free citizens in an\r\nindependent State.\r\nEgypt calls on the international community once\r\nagain to intervene decisively in order to deal with the\r\nhumanitarian catastrophe that the Palestinian people\r\nare facing. Daily they must endure unprecedented\r\nsuffering, and therefore efforts must be made to\r\naddress the tragic situation in the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritories.\r\nWhat the Palestinian people are facing, under the\r\nyoke of Israeli occupation, not only is destroying the\r\ninfrastructure of the West Bank and Gaza, and the\r\nfinancial and natural resources of the Palestinian\r\npeople; it is a blatant violation of their legitimate and\r\ninalienable rights. The practices of the Israeli army\r\nextend to targeting unarmed civilians, many of them\r\nwomen and children, as well as extra-judicial\r\nexecutions and collective punishment through the\r\nimposition of siege and closures.\r\nSieges, closures and curfews have led to a total\r\nparalysis of the Palestinian economy, and more than a\r\nmillion Palestinians are living in terrible poverty. In\r\naddition, Israeli operations have displaced nearly\r\n10,000 Palestinians, who now have no shelter at all.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General (A/59/121)\r\nhas noted another negative element which has led to\r\nincreased suffering on the part of the Palestinian\r\npeople: the construction of the separation wall and its\r\nimpact on the lives of the Palestinians and on the\r\nterritorial integrity of a future Palestinian State. This\r\njeopardizes the two-State solution set out in Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1397 (2002).\r\nEgypt appreciates the positive role undertaken by\r\nthe United Nations and its specialized agencies in\r\nproviding humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian\r\npeople, and particularly what the United Nations Relief\r\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near\r\nEast (UNRWA) is doing for 4 million Palestinian\r\nrefugees.\r\nEgypt calls on donor States to increase their\r\nsupport for such activities by providing the necessary\r\nfinancial assistance to breach the current financing gap\r\nso as to provide the necessary humanitarian assistance\r\nto the Palestinians and to take a firm stand regarding\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nany practices that hinder the delivery of such assistance\r\nto those who need it.\r\nEgypt would request that the report of the\r\nSecretary-General to be presented next year include an\r\nanalysis of the activities of the United Nations with\r\nrespect to the humanitarian situation in the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories and the difficulties it faces in\r\nproviding humanitarian assistance. Even more\r\nimportantly, proposals on how to deal with these\r\ndifficulties should be made in order to enable the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil to adopt appropriate resolutions in this area.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to emphasize that we\r\nbelieve that the assistance provided to the Palestinian\r\npeople is only a first step. It is a means and not an end.\r\nThe goal is clear: for the Palestinian people to be able\r\nto determine their destiny freely, in an independent and\r\nsovereign State capable of economic development. To\r\nthat end, we must ensure the implementation of all\r\nrelevant resolutions of the United Nations, particularly\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and subsequent\r\ninternational, national and regional resolutions and\r\ninitiatives, which emphasize the linkage between\r\neconomic and political issues.\r\nMr. De Rivero (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nshould like at the outset to express the condolences of\r\nthe delegation of Peru to the delegation of Palestine on\r\nthe death of President Yasser Arafat.\r\nToday we are seeing a trend towards increased\r\nhumanitarian action on the part of the United Nations.\r\nWe are not only protecting civilians in armed conflict,\r\nbut also providing assistance in the aftermath of natural\r\ndisasters. Such efforts represent the very essence of\r\nhumanitarian work. However, we are now moving into\r\nother areas of operation ranging from gender issues to\r\nthe process of transition to development, to AIDS.\r\nI think that today it can be said that humanitarian\r\nwork is becoming the principal activity of the United\r\nNations. Although this seems to us here at the United\r\nNations to be a normal state of affairs, it is seen very\r\ndifferently in many academic circles and by\r\ncontemporary international-relations analysts.\r\nMany of them quite rightly believe that the\r\nexpansion of the humanitarian work of the United\r\nNations is a very clear indication that the Organization\r\nis failing in the fulfilment of its principal mandate —\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nToday the proliferation of unresolved civil conflicts is\r\ncreating a series of humanitarian crises on a vast scale,\r\nwhich are transforming the United Nations — without\r\nus hardly noticing it — into a kind of global intensive-\r\ncare operation. It is as if we were becoming another\r\nlarge-scale global Red Cross.\r\nThe truth is that, although the primary mission of\r\nthe United Nations is to maintain peace and security, it\r\nfinds itself doing principally humanitarian work. We\r\nshould therefore be concerned at the fact that, as the\r\nscope of humanitarian assistance work expands,\r\ninsufficient efforts are being made to resolve the\r\nconflicts that are multiplying throughout the\r\ndeveloping world.\r\nFor that reason, it is important that reports on\r\nhumanitarian assistance in conflict situations call on\r\nthe Security Council to shoulder its responsibility for\r\nthe prevention and resolution of conflicts — conflicts\r\nwhich are giving rise to the need for humanitarian\r\nassistance.\r\nThe main function of humanitarian assistance is\r\nto alleviate human suffering, but today we are\r\nextending it to include transition to development. This\r\nconcept of transition to development is confusing. In\r\none of his reports, the Secretary-General himself\r\nadmits that and states that it leads to differing\r\ninterpretations that make financial contributions more\r\ndifficult.\r\nMy delegation agrees with the Secretary-General\r\nwhen he states that the concept of transition to\r\ndevelopment is confusing. But it is also illusory,\r\nbecause it makes us think that development is just\r\naround the corner, when in reality development has\r\nbecome a quest that is as elusive as the quest for\r\nEl Dorado. According to the Human Development\r\nReports of the World Bank and the report of the world\r\nsummit in Geneva, of the 140 developing countries,\r\nonly 13 saw growth of more than 3 per cent in personal\r\nincome in the past 23 years. The great majority of\r\ndeveloping countries saw no growth in personal\r\nincome, or growth of less than 3 per cent, which is the\r\nminimum needed to begin to conquer poverty.\r\nTherefore, today’s grave world economic\r\nsituation is not exactly a situation of transition to\r\ndevelopment. More than 4.8 billion people — nearly\r\ntwo thirds of humanity — are living on $2 a day. The\r\nMillennium Declaration is therefore realistic; it aims\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nnot at development, but at reducing poverty, which is\r\nnot the same thing.\r\nFor all of those reasons, my delegation fully\r\nagrees on the need for a more realistic and more\r\nmodest approach in the post-assistance period, which\r\nshould only extend over a limited time period\r\nfollowing a humanitarian crisis or disaster. The post-\r\nassistance phase should not be considered a\r\nmetaphysical period of transition to development,\r\nbecause that term can be confused with nation-\r\nbuilding — something that is very difficult to achieve\r\nand that can ultimately discourage financing for\r\nhumanitarian and rehabilitation purposes, since it is\r\nextremely difficult to determine how long the transition\r\nto elusive development will last. That is how we\r\ninterpret the conclusions of the Executive Committee\r\non Humanitarian Affairs/United Nations Development\r\nGroup Working Group on Transition Issues.\r\nMy delegation is convinced that the most\r\neffective and least controversial humanitarian activity\r\nof the United Nations is disaster relief. Although\r\nhumanitarian aid in conflict situations has sometimes\r\nbrought harsh criticism of the Organization and\r\nsometimes generates politicized spin concerning\r\nhumanitarian aid, that has not been the case with\r\nnatural disasters. No population forgets the United\r\nNations flag unfurled a few hours after an earthquake,\r\na flood or a hurricane, as was recently the case with\r\nHurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica\r\nand the Dominican Republic, and with the earthquakes\r\nin Turkey and Iran.\r\nFrom the creation of the United Nations Disaster\r\nRelief Office — a joint initiative of Peru, Turkey and\r\nother countries — to the establishment of the\r\nInternational Search and Rescue Advisory Group\r\n(INSARAG) and of the United Nations Disaster\r\nAssessment and Coordination team, humanitarian\r\ndisaster relief has only enhanced the Organization’s\r\nprestige. One can say that in natural disasters, the\r\nUnited Nations is in a win-win position in comparison\r\nwith other humanitarian activities. For those reasons,\r\nPeru supported Turkey’s initiative and was a sponsor of\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 57/150, adopted by\r\nconsensus, which was aimed at strengthening the\r\neffectiveness and coordination of urban search and\r\nrescue assistance. We asked the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to\r\ndisseminate that resolution broadly so that countries\r\ncan take it into account in their national plans to deal\r\nwith natural disasters.\r\nToday, natural disasters — particularly those of a\r\nhydrological nature, such as hurricanes, floods,\r\ncyclones, droughts and famine — are increasing.\r\nTherefore, United Nations activities in the area of\r\nnatural disasters will have to be strengthened. In that\r\nrespect, we must lend our full support to OCHA. The\r\nincrease in natural disasters also requires coordinated\r\nand joint efforts at the regional level. Recently, the\r\ncountries members of the Andean Community adopted\r\nthe Andean disaster prevention and response strategy.\r\nThe Andean strategy will enable us to incorporate\r\ndisaster reduction, as both a prevention policy and a\r\ndevelopment strategy, into the national agendas of the\r\nfive members of the Community. The main subjects\r\nbeing developed will relate to five thematic clusters of\r\nour strategy, such as the strengthening of institutions,\r\ninformation and early warning systems, scientific and\r\ntechnological research, mutual disaster relief and a\r\nculture of prevention for the population.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that in August 2004 Peru\r\nhosted a meeting of the INSARAG Regional Group of\r\nthe Americas, which is aimed specifically at\r\nstrengthening technical disaster management capacities\r\nin the Latin American and Caribbean region. We hope\r\nthat the World Conference on Disaster Reduction to be\r\nheld at Kobe next year will provide an opportunity to\r\nwork on reducing vulnerability to disasters and that it\r\nwill produce commitments and positive initiatives.\r\nIn that context, I should like to highlight what the\r\nSecretary-General pointed out in his report with regard\r\nto private sector participation in support of\r\nhumanitarian emergency responses. In fact, it would be\r\nvery appropriate to think about promoting private\r\nparticipation to support disaster responses. I am sure\r\nthat many companies that engage in global commerce\r\nwould be interested in participating. Perhaps we should\r\npromote a compact between multinational enterprises\r\nand the United Nations aimed at disaster relief.\r\nMoreover, in the light of the Organization’s\r\nenormous experience and prestige in the area of\r\ndisaster relief, OCHA should publish an annual report\r\non its activities related to natural disasters, in which it\r\ncould assess its experiences and make\r\nrecommendations to further improve these important\r\nactivities, which will have to be expanded in the future,\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\ngiven the greater frequency of disasters due to global\r\nwarming.\r\nIn conclusion, I cannot fail to pay tribute to all\r\nthe men and women who have sacrificed their lives for\r\nhuman dignity, in keeping with their humanitarian\r\nresponsibility, and to express once again my thanks and\r\nwishes for success to the Under-Secretary-General for\r\nHumanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief\r\nCoordinator, Mr. Jan Egeland.\r\nMr. Mpundu (Zambia): On behalf of my\r\nGovernment, I wish to express our sincere condolences\r\nto the Palestinian National Authority on the demise of\r\nPresident Yasser Arafat. Zambia recalls his\r\nextraordinary leadership.\r\nI should like to commend the Secretary-General\r\nfor the reports contained in documents A/59/93,\r\nA/58/293 and A/59/374, on emergency humanitarian\r\nassistance. My delegation finds those reports to be very\r\nuseful. My delegation also commends the Under-\r\nSecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and\r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator, Mr. Jan Egeland, for\r\nhis detailed briefing on the subject on 10 November\r\n2004. Zambia agrees with his assessment of the\r\nsituation and shares his concerns about the decline in\r\nthe resources that are being provided to meet the\r\ndemands of humanitarian assistance worldwide.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of Nigeria on behalf of the\r\nAfrican Union. We agree with the view that\r\nhumanitarian assistance must be extended to the\r\ngenocide survivors in the Republic of Rwanda and\r\nelsewhere. In order to raise the profile of this agenda\r\nitem, it is my delegation’s view that this issue should\r\ncontinue to be dealt with in plenary meetings of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe also align ourselves with the statement\r\ndelivered by Qatar on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina.\r\nOwing to the worldwide increase in the demand\r\nfor humanitarian assistance, it is of primary importance\r\nto develop a coordinated approach with regard to how\r\nthat assistance is delivered, in order to ensure that there\r\nis no duplication of programmes and that costs can be\r\nheld down.\r\nIn view of the many factors involved in the\r\nimplementation of humanitarian activities, it is\r\nimperative to exercise an optimal and comprehensive\r\ncooperation strategy in order to achieve the intended\r\nresults. Coordination brings about efficiency in the\r\nutilization of limited resources. In that regard, my\r\ndelegation wishes to commend the efforts of the Office\r\nof the Emergency Relief Coordinator over the past\r\nyear, as outlined in his reports.\r\nWhile financial and material resources are\r\nnecessary for the delivery of humanitarian assistance,\r\nthe success of that assistance is largely dependent upon\r\nthe conduciveness of the environment. My delegation\r\nis aware of the many challenges under which\r\nemergency relief is delivered, especially in conflict\r\nsituations. It is for that reason that the safety and\r\nprotection of humanitarian personnel is paramount.\r\nThat protection must be a shared responsibility of the\r\ninternational community. We call upon Member States\r\nto cooperate with the United Nations to ensure the\r\nsafety of humanitarian assistance and field staff.\r\nThe continuing strife around the world has\r\nresulted in increased demand for humanitarian\r\nassistance. In that regard, we welcome the launch by\r\nthe Secretary-General of an appeal to Member States to\r\nraise an estimated $1.7 billion to support humanitarian\r\nactivities.\r\nAt this juncture, I wish to say a few words about\r\nmy country, Zambia, and our experiences with disaster\r\nrelief management. After years of food deficit, my\r\nGovernment put in place during the 2002-2003\r\nagricultural season measures designed to promote\r\nagricultural production to increase food security in the\r\ncountry. Among others, such measures included the\r\nintroduction of an agriculture import-support\r\nprogramme targeting vulnerable members of our\r\ncommunities through the provision of agricultural\r\ninputs, the introduction of outgrower schemes, the\r\ndevelopment of fisheries and the promotion of\r\nirrigation schemes. Those measures have further\r\nenhanced the capacity of the Government to respond to\r\nhumanitarian situations in the country. I am pleased to\r\nsay that, as a result of that agriculture policy, Zambia\r\nhas moved from deficit to surplus production, with an\r\nestimated production of 1.12 million metric tonnes of\r\nmaize in the 2002-2003 farming season.\r\nThrough the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs, my delegation would like to\r\nappeal to the Secretary-General to support Zambia’s\r\ncapacity-building in order to enable it to respond to\r\nhumanitarian situations.\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nIn May of this year, the Government of the\r\nRepublic of Zambia declared the HIV/AIDS pandemic\r\na national disaster. The pandemic mostly affects the\r\nproductive age group of our society. That disease\r\nshould be confronted with the same vigour as other\r\ndisasters. Accordingly, my Government will continue\r\nto count on the international community for support to\r\nconquer that scourge.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation appreciates the\r\nwork of the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs, in particular as regards the\r\nissues that the Emergency Relief Coordinator has\r\nbrought to the fore in his reports. It is now up to\r\nMember States to provide the resources required to\r\nconfront the looming humanitarian crises around the\r\nworld.\r\nMr. Chulkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): I would like to begin my statement by\r\nexpressing my sincere condolences to the leadership of\r\nthe Palestinian people and the family of President\r\nArafat on the passing away of President Arafat.\r\nThe Russian Federation commends the activities\r\nof the United Nations system aimed at strengthening\r\nthe coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance.\r\nWe note the leading role played in that process by the\r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\r\n(OCHA). We stress in particular the efforts aimed at\r\nenhancing the efficiency of the respective coordination\r\nmechanisms and instruments while taking into account\r\nnew humanitarian activities related, first of all, to the\r\nincreased global terrorist threat and the risks taken by\r\nhumanitarian workers in the field.\r\nThe problem of ensuring the physical safety of\r\nhumanitarian personnel has recently become a\r\nparticularly urgent matter. In that connection, we\r\nemphasize the need to take effective measures in that\r\narea in accordance with the Convention on the Safety\r\nof United Nations and Associated Personnel. We also\r\ndeem it necessary to work for a broader scope of legal\r\nprotection for United Nations personnel by finalizing\r\nthe protocol to the Convention. We note the efforts of\r\nthe Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) to\r\ndevelop a general framework for the establishment of\r\nrelations between humanitarian and military\r\norganizations in complex emergency situations. It is\r\nvital to stress that, in its search for an adequate\r\nresponse to new challenges and threats, the\r\nhumanitarian community should consistently be guided\r\nby the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality\r\nand impartiality. At the same time, as was justly\r\nstressed in the report (A/59/332) of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, humanitarian personnel should observe\r\ngenerally accepted and locally agreed security\r\npractices and be sensitive to local traditions and\r\ncustoms.\r\nThe protection of civilians in armed conflict has\r\nrecently been among the priority problems on the\r\ninternational humanitarian agenda. Despite the whole\r\nrange of current international instruments on human\r\nrights and international humanitarian law it is still\r\ninnocent civilians — including children, women, older\r\npersons and those belonging to what are usually\r\nreferred to as vulnerable groups — who are the first\r\naffected in armed conflict. The situation regarding the\r\nprotection of civilians calls for systematic and\r\ncoordinated measures at the international, regional and\r\nnational levels. Account should be taken of the\r\nproblem of protecting civilians, which has both a\r\nhuman rights and a humanitarian dimension. It is\r\nobvious that the humanitarian component is now very\r\nmuch in demand, especially as an element of an overall\r\nstrategy aimed at crisis prevention, as well as at the\r\nvarious stages of post-conflict settlement. There is no\r\ndoubt that humanitarian work should be based on the\r\nnorms of the Charter of the United Nations and basic\r\nhumanitarian principles. Its effectiveness depends\r\nlargely upon how it is inscribed in the efforts of the\r\ninternational community aimed at political settlement.\r\nPost-conflict peacebuilding and rehabilitation and\r\nprioritizing the matter of transitioning from relief to\r\ndevelopment continue to be urgent issues. We believe\r\nthat effective and smooth transition to development is\r\nkey to the success of international humanitarian and\r\npost-conflict peacebuilding efforts and to laying the\r\ngroundwork for dynamic social and economic\r\ndevelopment. We believe that at the stage of deploying\r\na humanitarian operation, attention should be paid to\r\nplanning and programming of development-oriented\r\nelements of assistance. All this requires an adequate\r\nand coordinated response on the part of the\r\ninternational community, with the United Nations\r\nplaying the leading role.\r\nWe note an increased interaction between the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Security Council\r\nwith regard to post-conflict situations. We believe that\r\nthis will help the United Nations system organizations\r\nto balance and coordinate their efforts in this area.\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.51\r\nIn the current situation there is a growing need to\r\npredict emergencies, take preventive measures and\r\nensure a timely response on the part of both national\r\nand international humanitarian agencies. In this regard\r\nadequate measures should be provided in cooperation\r\nwith national governments to reinforce planning\r\nmechanisms for emergencies.\r\nWe support continued efforts to strengthen\r\nnational early warning systems, assess damage and\r\nmitigate the consequences of natural disasters. All this\r\nshould facilitate the creation of a global network for\r\nurgent warning in case of major emergencies in order\r\nto ensure coordination among national rescue agencies\r\nand adjust the mechanisms allowing effective use of\r\nthe available national potential in international rescue\r\noperations.\r\nThe Russian Federation attaches great importance\r\nto global efforts to implement the International\r\nStrategy for Disaster Reduction and we consider\r\ncommitment to its purposes a key prerequisite to attain\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, especially in\r\nvulnerable countries and regions of the world. We\r\nwelcome the work done by the secretariat for the\r\nStrategy to prepare the World Conference on Disaster\r\nReduction to be held in January 2005 in Kobe. We\r\nbelieve that the Conference should become an\r\nimportant stage in international efforts to reduce the\r\nthreat of disasters, and to further improve the United\r\nNations work in this area through a global assessment\r\nof the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and\r\nPlan of Action for a Safer World. Russia is\r\nparticipating actively in the preparation of the\r\nConference and is making a concrete contribution to its\r\norganization.\r\nA key task is to further improve tools for the\r\nmobilization of funds and, at the same time, to enlarge\r\nthe donor base. The Consolidated Inter-Agency\r\nAppeals remains the main mechanism in this process.\r\nTheir preparation procedure and structure should be\r\nfurther enhanced. Furthermore, quite a number of them\r\nstill lack resources. In this regard it would be expedient\r\nto provide the appeals with flexibility allowing non-\r\ntraditional donors, including those who are ready to\r\nrender humanitarian assistance in kind, to increase\r\ntheir participation in international humanitarian\r\ncooperation.\r\nRussia commends the United Nations efforts to\r\ndraw the attention of international public opinion to the\r\nproblems of the so-called forgotten emergencies. We\r\nshare the view that such situations cause human\r\nsuffering no less that those that are closely followed by\r\nthe international community. We are continuing to\r\nprovide our contribution to humanitarian assistance in\r\nmany countries of the world. As was the case last year,\r\nwe provided humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia,\r\nEritrea, Iran, China, Algeria, Ecuador, Tajikistan,\r\nKyrgyzstan, Georgia, Moldova and provided voluntary\r\ncontributions to the World Food Programme to provide\r\nassistance to the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea and Angola, and to the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\r\nfor the region of Southern Africa in the amount of 11\r\nmillion dollars and 2 million dollars respectively. Next\r\nyear we are going to maintain our contribution to the\r\nWorld Food Programme in the amount of 11 million\r\ndollars. These figures also prove that our country is\r\ngradually restoring its donor potential.\r\nIt is to a large extent through the humanitarian\r\nactivities that the United Nations has wielded its\r\npolitical and moral authority in the world. And it is\r\nwithin our means to further reinforce its role in the\r\nworld.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I should like to\r\nmake an announcement concerning the programme of\r\nwork of the plenary meeting of the General Assembly.\r\nOn the morning of Tuesday, 23 November 2004, the\r\nGeneral Assembly will consider agenda item 163,\r\nentitled “The situation in the occupied territories of\r\nAzerbaijan”.
