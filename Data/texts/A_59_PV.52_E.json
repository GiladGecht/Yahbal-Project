(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 2.45 p.m.\r\nTribute to the memory of His Excellency Mr. Yasser\r\nArafat, late President of the Palestinian Authority\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Before we take\r\nup the items on our agenda this afternoon, it is my sad\r\nduty to pay tribute to the memory of His Excellency\r\nMr. Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestinian\r\nAuthority, who passed away today, 11 November 2004.\r\nPresident Yasser Arafat, who was considered by\r\nhis people as the father of the nation, dedicated his life\r\nto the establishment of a Palestinian State. By signing\r\nthe Oslo Accords he accepted the principle of the\r\npeaceful co-existence of two States, Palestine and\r\nIsrael. The best tribute to President Arafat would be the\r\nachievement of his dream of an independent\r\nPalestinian State living in peace and cooperating with\r\nall its neighbours.\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I request the\r\nObserver of Palestine to convey my condolences to the\r\nPalestinian people and to the bereaved family.\r\nI invite representatives to stand and observe a\r\nminute of silence in tribute to the memory of President\r\nYasser Arafat.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly observed a\r\nminute of silence.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nthe Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General: For nearly four decades,\r\nYasser Arafat expressed and symbolized in his person\r\nthe national aspirations of the Palestinian people. He\r\nwas one of those few leaders who was instantly\r\nrecognizable by people in any walk of life all around\r\nthe world.\r\nPresident Arafat will always be remembered for\r\nhaving led the Palestinians, in 1988, to accept the\r\nprinciple of peaceful coexistence between Israel and a\r\nfuture Palestinian State. By signing the Oslo Accords\r\nin 1993, he took a giant step towards the realization of\r\nthat vision. It is tragic that he did not live to see it\r\nfulfilled. Now that he has gone, both Israelis and\r\nPalestinians, and the friends of both peoples\r\nthroughout the world, must make even greater efforts\r\nto bring about the peaceful realization of the\r\nPalestinian right to self-determination.\r\nThirty years ago this week, Yasser Arafat stood in\r\nthis Hall when he became the first representative of a\r\nnon-governmental organization to speak to a plenary\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly. One year later, the\r\nGeneral Assembly adopted resolution 3237 (XXIX),\r\nconferring on the Palestine Liberation Organization the\r\nstatus of observer in the Assembly and in other\r\ninternational conferences held under United Nations\r\nauspices.\r\nBut the relationship between the United Nations\r\nand the Palestinian people is far deeper and broader,\r\nand dates back much longer than that. For 55 years, the\r\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine\r\nRefugees in the Near East has provided humanitarian\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nassistance, health care, housing and education to\r\nPalestinians. Today, there are a total of 19 United\r\nNations agencies and bodies lending their assistance to\r\nthe Palestinian people. We must, and will, continue that\r\nwork for as long as the Palestinian people need our\r\nhelp.\r\nTogether with our partners, we will also continue\r\nour efforts to achieve the full implementation of the\r\nroad map, as endorsed by the Security Council in\r\nresolution 1515 (2003). Our goal is the realization of a\r\njust, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle\r\nEast based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967),\r\n338 (1973) and 1397 (2002). That includes as its\r\ncentrepiece the establishment of a sovereign,\r\ndemocratic, viable and contiguous Palestinian State\r\nliving side by side in peace with a secure Israel.\r\nAlthough Chairman Arafat did not live to see the\r\nattainment of those goals, the world will continue to\r\nstrive towards them.\r\nToday our condolences go to Chairman Arafat’s\r\nwife and young daughter, for whom his death is a\r\npersonal tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers also go to\r\nhis wider family — the wider family of the Palestinian\r\npeople — in the hope that they will find the strength,\r\nvision and courage to look ahead to the possibility of a\r\npeaceful settlement, for the benefit of succeeding\r\ngenerations.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call His\r\nExcellency Mr. Crispin Grey-Johnson, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Gambia, who will speak on\r\nbehalf of the Group of African States.\r\nMr. Grey-Johnson (Gambia): I speak in the\r\nname of the Group of African States. The Group of\r\nAfrican States at the United Nations is profoundly\r\nsaddened by the passing away this morning of\r\nMohammed Yasser Abdul-Raouf Qudwa Al-Husseini,\r\ncommonly known as Yasser Arafat, President of the\r\nPalestinian Authority.\r\nPresident Arafat was the personification of\r\nPalestinian nationalism. Since 1957, when he founded\r\nthe Fatah movement in Kuwait, to the very last minute\r\nof his life, he lived for and advanced the Palestinian\r\ncause. Through his exemplary leadership, a Palestinian\r\nidentity was forged, amplified and consolidated, and\r\nthe question of Palestine was elevated from a mere\r\nfootnote to full centre stage of international\r\nnegotiations and discourse. The movement for the\r\nindependence of the Palestinian people grew into the\r\ncreation of the Palestine Liberation Organization in\r\n1964, with a military wing — the Palestine Liberation\r\nArmy — added to it in 1970.\r\nIn recognition of his efforts to have his people\r\nrenounce violence, embrace peace and recognize the\r\nState of Israel through the Declaration of Principles,\r\nwhich he signed with the Israelis in 1993, Mr. Arafat\r\nwas awarded the Nobel Peace Prize along with Shimon\r\nPeres and Yitzhak Rabin of Israel. In 1994 the\r\nPalestinian Authority was created by the Oslo Accords,\r\nand he was elected its first President two years later —\r\na position he held until his death this morning at the\r\nage of 75.\r\nAbu Ammar, as he was affectionately called by\r\nhis people, committed his entire life to the cause of\r\nfreedom for all the world’s oppressed people, for the\r\nliberation of the Palestinian people and the return of\r\ntheir heritage — a cause he vociferously defended on\r\nnumerous occasions in this very Hall. For good or for\r\nill, he has left his footprints on the sands of time. It is\r\nour fervent prayer that the peace that he sought for his\r\npeople throughout the course of his life will soon\r\nradiate not only among Palestinians, but also among all\r\npeople in the Middle East and beyond.\r\nWe extend our heartfelt condolences to his\r\nfamily, to the Palestinian Authority and to all the\r\npeople of Palestine. May his soul rest in peace.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to Mr. Rezlan Ishar Jenie of Indonesia, to speak\r\non behalf of the Asian States.\r\nMr. Jenie (Indonesia): I join you today as\r\nChairman of the Group of Asian States to pay tribute to\r\nPresident Yasser Arafat, who passed away on\r\n11 November 2004 at 3.30 a.m., Paris time.\r\nWe join the Palestinian people in mourning his\r\ndeath and regret that he did not live to see the birth of\r\nan independent Palestine. As the father of the\r\nPalestinian people, he kept the dream of an\r\nindependent homeland burning ever brightly. However,\r\na prolonged illegal occupation, which continues even\r\ntoday, prevented this from becoming a reality during\r\nhis lifetime.\r\nI would like to recall that exactly 30 years ago, in\r\nNovember 1974, President Arafat, the symbol of the\r\ngenuine Palestinian struggle for independence, first\r\nspoke at a plenary meeting of the General Assembly of\r\nthis Organization. It was clear then that his firm\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nstruggle for the independence of his country did not\r\nblind him to the need for compromise. On that historic\r\noccasion he offered an olive branch to facilitate a\r\npeaceful settlement of the political issues surrounding\r\nPalestine’s independence.\r\nIn the years following that address, despite the\r\nmany adversities he had to endure, President Arafat’s\r\ndetermination to lead the Palestinian people to a just\r\nand lasting peace never wavered. Arming himself with\r\ncourage and hope, he brought the peace of the brave to\r\nthe Oslo Accords of 1993 and to the subsequent talks\r\nin Washington.\r\nHis permanent desire was justice and peace for a\r\npeople who were only too familiar with the harshness\r\nof oppression. Having been awarded the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize in 1994, he made known the depth of his desire\r\nfor peace by stating, “We will discover ourselves\r\nthrough peace more than we did through confrontation\r\nand conflict”. Peace, he reasoned, was indispensable to\r\nPalestinian ambitions for independence and\r\nsovereignty.\r\nYet the ferocity of the repression of the\r\nPalestinian people did not lessen over the years. But he\r\nmatched its intensity with his commitment and undying\r\noptimism. Because of this, he was a much loved and\r\nrespected figure, not only by the Palestinian people but\r\nby many all over the world, including Asia.\r\nDespite repeated attempts and negotiations —\r\nincluding the famous road map brokered by the Quartet\r\nin 2002 with the objective of setting up a two-State\r\nsolution in 2005 — he was effectively prevented from\r\nfully leading his people to peace or to the creation of a\r\nPalestinian State. His last days were unfortunately\r\nspent as a virtual prisoner in his compound in\r\nRamallah.\r\nThough his hope for gaining independence for the\r\npeople of Palestine has not been achieved, that does\r\nnot mean that the flame for independence has been\r\nextinguished. Palestine has lost its beloved leader, but\r\nthe people have not lost their esteem and desire for\r\nliberty and independence.\r\nAll of Asia extends heartfelt condolences to the\r\npeople of Palestine and the bereaved family. We pray\r\nto God the Almighty for the late President Yasser\r\nArafat and for his family to be blessed with patience\r\nand strength in this time of deep sorrow.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to Mr. Andrei Dapkiunas, the representative of\r\nBelarus, to speak on behalf of the Eastern European\r\nStates.\r\nMr. Dapkiunas (Belarus): On behalf of the\r\nGroup of Eastern European States, I have the sad duty\r\nof expressing a deep sense of grief and compassion on\r\nthe passing away of President Yasser Arafat.\r\nThe life and work of President Arafat were\r\ninseparably connected with the struggle of the\r\nPalestinian people for their inalienable rights for a\r\nbetter and safer future in their homeland.\r\nPresident Arafat will be remembered as a lifelong\r\nand committed advocate of the Palestinian cause and\r\nan important participant in the historic 1993 Oslo\r\nAccords. The Nobel Peace Prize of 1994 was a\r\ndeserved acknowledgement of President Arafat’s role\r\nand contribution to the peace process in the Middle\r\nEast.\r\nAs a person and as a statesman, Yasser Arafat has\r\nleft a significant and undisputed imprint, not just on\r\nthe modern history of the Middle East, but on world\r\npolitics of past decades as well.\r\nOn behalf of the delegations of the States of the\r\nEastern European Group, I convey deep condolences to\r\nthe family of the late President Arafat and the\r\nmourning people of Palestine, the homeland he loved\r\nso much and devoted his whole life to. May his soul\r\nrest in peace.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I give the floor\r\nto Mr. Eduardo Sevilla Somoza, representative of\r\nNicaragua, speaking on behalf of the Group of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States.\r\nMr. Sevilla Somoza (Nicaragua) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): On this occasion of profound sadness for the\r\nPalestinian people, I wish, on behalf of the members of\r\nthe Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, to\r\npay tribute to the memory of President Yasser Arafat,\r\nan historic figure who had an impact on the world until\r\nhe drew his last breath.\r\nThe great majority of Palestinians feel they have\r\nlost their leader, their master, the father of the State.\r\nUnquestionably, he symbolized the feelings of his\r\npeople. In his person he represented the aspirations of a\r\nwhole people, raising to a world level his conviction\r\nfor the establishment of a sovereign State.\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nThe countries of the Group of Latin American\r\nand Caribbean States express our most heartfelt\r\ncondolences upon the passing of President Arafat to\r\nthe Palestinian people and all members of his family,\r\nparticularly Suha, now the widow of President Arafat,\r\nand her young daughter, Zahwa.\r\nOur feelings of solidarity and support at this time\r\nof such sorrow and distress also go most particularly to\r\nAmbassador Nasser Al-Kidwa and the other members\r\nof the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe countries of the Group urge the Palestinian\r\npeople and its leaders to keep alive the ideals of their\r\ngreatest representative with a view to creating a free\r\nand sovereign Palestinian State, economically viable,\r\nbut above all, dedicated to peace, not only for Palestine\r\nbut for the whole of the Middle East and the rest of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I call on\r\nMr. Don MacKay, representative of New Zealand, to\r\nspeak on behalf of the Western European and Other\r\nStates Group.\r\nMr. MacKay (New Zealand): As Chairman of the\r\nWestern European and Other States Group, I would\r\nlike to address the Assembly today to express\r\ncondolences and sympathies to the family of President\r\nArafat and to the Palestinian people on the passing of\r\nYasser Arafat, President of the Palestinian Authority.\r\nOver the last four decades President Arafat came\r\nto symbolize the Palestinian national movement and\r\nthe aspirations of the Palestinian people. President\r\nArafat was respected by the Palestinians and others as\r\na leader who symbolized their long search for\r\nstatehood and independence and led the Palestinians to\r\na historic acceptance of the principle of peaceful\r\ncoexistence between Israel and a future Palestinian\r\nState.\r\nThe Palestinian leadership will now have to\r\nshoulder the heavy burden and responsibility of\r\ncarrying that vision of two States living side by side in\r\npeace and security and bringing it to fruition. It is to be\r\nhoped that the international community will provide\r\nevery support it can to achieve this vision.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I give the floor\r\nto Mr. Omar Bashir Mohamed Manis, the\r\nrepresentative of Sudan, on behalf of the Arab States.\r\nMr. Manis (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): The late\r\nPresident Arafat continued to work to achieve the\r\nlegitimate aspirations and dreams of the Palestinian\r\npeople to have an independent Palestinian State with\r\nAl-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, to spread peace and\r\nestablish stability, and for it, he sacrificed everything\r\nthat was precious to him in order to achieve this noble\r\ngoal. He endured all forms of unjust treatment, torture,\r\nsiege, humiliation and displacement for this just cause.\r\nThe Arab and Islamic nation, with the loss of\r\nPresident Arafat loses a symbol of Palestinian struggle\r\nand a strong, unique and distinguished leader in the\r\nhistory of the Palestinian struggle. It has lost a fighter\r\npresident that was at the forefront of all efforts to unite\r\nthe Arab position in the darkest of moments and\r\ncircumstances. He worked with true faith and real\r\ninteraction in order to keep the Palestinian cause — the\r\ncentral cause of all Arabs — alive, despite the\r\nintransigence and the oppression of the Israeli\r\noccupation forces that have rejected all binding\r\nresolutions, and to regain usurped Palestinian rights.\r\nDespite forced imprisonment and his recent\r\nillness, he worked to mobilize sincere Arabic and\r\ninternational efforts towards the peace process, taking\r\ncourageous and insightful decisions in order to pursue\r\na peaceful settlement and the establishment of a\r\nlegitimate and independent Palestinian State through\r\nhard and serious negotiations until these efforts were\r\ncrowned with the signing of many agreements.\r\nDespite the tragedy of losing President Arafat\r\ntoday, we trust that the peace process and the path that\r\nhe has drawn for his people in calling for their\r\nlegitimate right to the liberation of Palestine from the\r\noccupiers and for establishing their legitimate State on\r\nPalestinian soil, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,\r\nwill always be a beacon.\r\nWith hearts that are heavy with pain and sadness\r\nand with deep faith and surrender to the will of God we\r\nare shocked by the loss of brother President Yasser\r\nArafat, whose loss is a source of great sadness and\r\ngrief to the Palestinian people, to the Arab and Islamic\r\nnations and to all peace-loving countries and peoples,\r\nas well as to all those who care about the peace process\r\nin the Middle East.\r\nOn behalf of the Arab Group, we offer our\r\ndeepest and sincerest condolences to the family of the\r\nlate President and to the heroic Palestinian people and\r\nto Arabs everywhere and to all the peace-loving\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\npeoples who seek liberation, and we call on God\r\nAlmighty to grant him heaven with the martyrs and the\r\nrighteous for they are the best of companions.\r\nThe Palestinian people, with the loss of their\r\nPresident Yasser Arafat, have lost a courageous fighter,\r\nan inspirational and steadfast leader who never\r\nwavered in his diligent effort to liberate Palestine, in\r\nhis honourable and brave national struggle and in his\r\nreal belief in the justice of his people’s cause and the\r\nlegitimacy of their struggle over the decades. President\r\nArafat led the struggle of the Palestinian people with\r\ngreat wisdom and insight. He firmly defended the\r\nlegitimate rights of the Palestinian people, while\r\nmaintaining the unity of their parties, without\r\ndiscriminating against any. He remained committed to\r\nhis national principles with rare strength, willpower\r\nand courage. We hope his inspiration will continue to\r\nbe a beacon for his people and for the Palestinian\r\nleaders, so that they may achieve the aspirations that he\r\nsought all his life to accomplish.\r\nAlthough President Arafat is absent today, his\r\nideals and principles will survive and will continue to\r\nbe our guiding light. We are from God and to Him we\r\nshall return.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nthe representative of the Netherlands, who will speak\r\non behalf of the European Union.\r\nMr. Van den Berg (Netherlands): On behalf of\r\nthe countries of European Union (EU), I would like to\r\nconvey our profound condolences to Madame Arafat,\r\nto the family of the deceased and to the Palestinian\r\npeople.\r\nThe Palestinian people have lost a historic leader\r\nand a democratically elected President. Mr. Arafat’s\r\ndevotion and single-minded commitment to the\r\nPalestinian national cause throughout his life has never\r\nbeen in doubt. He did not live to see the birth of a\r\nPalestinian State. However, the European Union will\r\nwork with the Palestinian authorities and the\r\ninternational community to contribute to realizing the\r\naspirations of the Palestinian people.\r\nThe European Union would like to commend the\r\nPalestinian leadership for their demonstration of\r\ndignity and responsibility in order to maintain the\r\nPalestinian institutions at this difficult time. We also\r\npay tribute to the Palestinian people, who support their\r\nleadership. We wish to stress that the Palestinian\r\npeople can count on the undiminished support of the\r\nEuropean Union on the path towards a peaceful,\r\ndurable and just settlement of the conflict. We are\r\nconvinced that this goal can be achieved for both\r\nIsraelis and Palestinians.\r\nOn a more personal note, we, the Permanent\r\nRepresentatives of the European Union, would also\r\nlike to convey our heartfelt condolences to our\r\ncolleague Nasser Al-Kidwa, the Permanent Observer of\r\nPalestine, who lost a President, as well as a family\r\nmember. Our sympathies are with him. May Nasser\r\nhave the strength and the courage to overcome this\r\ngrave loss.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nthe representative of Malaysia, who will speak on\r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nMr. Rastam (Malaysia): I have the honour and\r\nthe sad duty to speak on behalf of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement (NAM) on this solemn occasion to pay\r\ntribute to the memory of the late President Yasser\r\nArafat, who passed away on 11 November 2004. I\r\nextend the sincere condolences and heartfelt\r\nsympathies of the member countries of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement to Madame Suha Arafat and the\r\nfamily, the Observer Delegation of Palestine to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Palestinian Authority and all\r\nPalestinians, over the passing of President Yasser\r\nArafat, a loving father and husband, a learned tutor and\r\nan inspiring leader of the Palestinian people.\r\nPresident Arafat was not only a leader of the\r\nPalestinians, but was also among the influential leaders\r\nwithin the Non-Aligned Movement. Together with our\r\nPalestinian brothers and sisters, the member countries\r\nof NAM mourn with great sadness and deep sorrow his\r\nuntimely departure.\r\nPresident Arafat will be forever remembered, not\r\nonly by Palestinians but also by people from all parts\r\nof the world, for his immense courage, enormous\r\nsacrifice and strong determination in championing and\r\nprotecting the inalienable right to self-determination of\r\nthe people of Palestine and their claim to their own\r\nsovereign homeland. He devoted his life to that\r\nstruggle — against all odds — for almost four decades,\r\nincluding suffering the indignity of being virtually\r\nimprisoned by the Israelis at the Muqataa in Ramallah.\r\nPresident Arafat will indelibly remain the icon of the\r\nPalestinian struggle against injustice, against brutal\r\noppression, against subjugation, as well as against the\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nforces that seek to deny the Palestinian people their\r\ndignity, freedom and independence. It must be\r\nremembered that until his death, President Arafat\r\nremained the duly elected leader of the Palestinian\r\npeople and therefore had the right to represent them,\r\nalthough certain quarters did not wish to acknowledge\r\nthat.\r\nPresident Arafat’s leadership of the Palestinian\r\npeople may have come to an end, but, his legacy of\r\niron will and fighting spirit, which he lived by all his\r\nlife will continue to inspire the Palestinian people and\r\nthose who share the legitimate cause of the\r\nPalestinians. The Non-Aligned Movement is confident\r\nthat our brothers and sisters in Palestine will remain\r\ncalm and stand united during this most difficult time,\r\nin order to collectively address the many challenges\r\nahead.\r\nThe memory of President Arafat should serve to\r\nmotivate all Palestinians to display solidarity in order\r\nto secure, without delay, an independent and sovereign\r\nState of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nAs a fitting tribute to President Arafat’s memory, NAM\r\nwill continue to support the struggle of the Palestinians\r\nto achieve a just, comprehensive and lasting peaceful\r\nsettlement of the question of Palestine and the\r\nestablishment of the State of Palestine, living side by\r\nside with the State of Israel in peace within secure and\r\nrecognized borders. NAM will remain strongly\r\nsupportive of all endeavours aimed at addressing the\r\nPalestinian question, a question that has been high on\r\nthe agenda of the Non-Aligned Movement since the\r\nMovement’s establishment in September 1961.\r\nNAM calls upon all Member States of the United\r\nNations, and in particular members of the Quartet, to\r\nclosely monitor the situation in Palestine, as well as to\r\nrestrain Israel from exploiting, in any manner, the\r\npresent circumstances. We believe that it is timely for\r\nurgent measures to be taken to implement the road map\r\nfor peace in the Middle East without any further delay.\r\nThe contributions of President Yasser Arafat to\r\nthe Movement will long be remembered within NAM.\r\nHis untimely departure is a great loss, not only to the\r\nPalestinian people, but also to all people who believe\r\nin the just struggle that he led. May God Almighty\r\nbless his soul with mercy and compassion.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nthe representative of Turkey, who is speaking on behalf\r\nof the Organization of the Islamic Conference.\r\nMr. Cengizer (Turkey): It is my solemn and sad\r\nduty to speak on behalf of the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference on our loss of a valiant leader of\r\nthe Palestinian people, President Yasser Arafat. As\r\nevidenced by the numerous speakers who have taken\r\nthe floor before me, representing the four corners of\r\nthe world, this is a sad day for all humanity.\r\nThe Muslim world, about to observe the felicitous\r\noccasion of Eid Al-Fitr, grieves, but in a most\r\nmeaningful way. The Muslim world joins its\r\nPalestinian brothers and sisters in this great loss. More\r\nthan anyone else, President Arafat epitomized the\r\nrightful struggle of his people. There is no doubt that\r\nthe flame he lit and nurtured with singular courage and\r\ndetermination against all odds, yet which burned\r\nunabated for more than half a century, will continue\r\nuntil Palestinian statehood is achieved.\r\nIn that spirit, we stand with our Palestinian\r\nbrothers and sisters in their implacable grief and pay\r\nheartfelt tribute to President Arafat’s unforgettable\r\nmemory and struggle for justice, which he sought until\r\nthe very end. We pray for his soul, his family and his\r\nbrethren all over the world, and we salute once again\r\nhis ideals, which will never fade away.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the\r\nfloor to the representative of Senegal, Mr. Paul Badji,\r\nChairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the\r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People.\r\nMr. Badji (Senegal) (Chairman of the Committee\r\non the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the\r\nPalestinian People) (spoke in French): On behalf of the\r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of\r\nthe Palestinian People, I wish to express how deeply\r\nsaddened we are by the death of Mr. Yasser Arafat,\r\nChairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization and President of the\r\nPalestinian Authority.\r\nThe Palestinian people have lost a most ardent\r\nleader of their cause, a determined fighter, an\r\nunequalled strategist and a visionary leader who for\r\ndecades was the living symbol of the courage, tenacity,\r\nresistance and unity of the Palestinian people and of\r\ntheir legitimate aspiration to freedom, sovereignty and\r\nnational independence.\r\nOver the last 10 years President Arafat undertook\r\na historic fight to achieve what he often called the\r\npeace of the brave and the goal of establishing the\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nState of Palestine, living side by side with Israel — a\r\ngoal that would bring peace, security and stability to\r\nthe region.\r\nThe Committee hopes that in these times of\r\nhardship the Palestinian people will remain united and\r\ndetermined to continue on the road to peace marked\r\nout by President Arafat. We will support the\r\nPalestinian people until their inalienable rights are\r\nfully realized, in perfect harmony with international\r\nlegality.\r\nThe Committee will continue to work for a\r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the\r\nquestion of Palestine, in conformity with the relevant\r\nUnited Nations resolutions and international law. The\r\nCommittee believes that the road map remains the best\r\nway to attain a comprehensive, just and lasting\r\nsettlement of the question of Palestine through the\r\nestablishment of two States, Israel and Palestine, based\r\non the 1967 borders and the relevant United Nations\r\nresolutions. Any unilateral act by either party will not\r\ncontribute to a lasting settlement unless it is in\r\nconformity with the spirit of negotiations between the\r\ntwo sides and the road map. The Committee hopes that\r\nthe Quartet and the international community will\r\ncontinue to work to achieve that goal. That would be\r\nthe best tribute to President Arafat.\r\nThe Committee conveys its deepest condolences\r\nto the family of President Arafat, the entire Palestinian\r\npeople and Mr. Nasser Al-Kidwa, our fellow\r\nCommittee member, on the occasion of this cruel loss.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nMr. Amr Aboul Atta, chargé d’affaires of Egypt.\r\nMr. Aboul Atta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nAssembly is meeting today at a time of great sorrow,\r\nnot just for the Arab world but for the entire free\r\nworld. Yesterday we lost a brave fighter, a steadfast\r\nleader and a unique nationalist, the late President\r\nArafat.\r\nThe Government and the people of Egypt offer\r\ntheir sincerest condolences to the brotherly Palestinian\r\npeople and the Palestinian Authority and its institutions\r\non the occasion of the death of the late President\r\nArafat. He embodied the national struggle for freedom\r\nand independence in our modern-day history.\r\nThe memory of peoples and the pages of history\r\nhave never forgotten the great sacrifices that were\r\nmade by symbols of national struggle such as Nelson\r\nMandela and Mahatma Ghandi. The two achieved the\r\ndream of freedom and national independence. The\r\nname of the late President Arafat will forever remain a\r\nsymbol of the history of the Palestinian people’s\r\nnational struggle since Israel first occupied the territory\r\nof Palestine and since the Palestinians first strove for\r\nself-determination.\r\nYasser Arafat was not just a symbol of the\r\nnational struggle against foreign occupation; he was a\r\ndedicated political leader. He exerted every effort\r\npossible and bore great hardships and suffering to carry\r\nthe olive branch and extend his hand in peace in order\r\nto achieve a political settlement that would end the\r\nbloodshed of innocent people, recover all rights and\r\nachieve self-determination for an entire people, ending\r\na conflict that has clouded our lives for decades.\r\nRegrettably, fate did not allow President Arafat to\r\nachieve the fruit of his long struggle, fulfil his long-\r\nheld wish to pray at Al-Aqsa Mosque and see the free\r\nflag of the State of Palestine fly high over the West\r\nBank and the Gaza Strip as a symbol of an independent\r\nPalestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nHistory will not forget that at a time when human\r\nrights are defended and the principles of international\r\nlaw and international legitimacy are respected, as are\r\nthe will and firm right of peoples to self-determination,\r\nthe leader of an Arab people lived under a humiliating\r\nsiege for more than two years in his own land and in\r\nhis own country, deprived of even the most basic\r\nhuman rights.\r\nThe leadership and people of the Arab Republic\r\nof Egypt have full and unwavering confidence that the\r\nvalues and principles that guided President Arafat in\r\nthe struggle of his people over many long years will\r\nnot be lost. The Palestinian people will rapidly\r\novercome their sorrow to rally around a national\r\nleadership that will continue the struggle to achieve a\r\njust and comprehensive peace and regain all\r\nPalestinian rights.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East is continuing to\r\ndevelop rapidly and successively. Some developments\r\nserve to intensify feelings of frustration and despair,\r\nbut some do provide a ray of hope for a future that may\r\nbe brighter for the generations to come. We are very\r\nhopeful that the course of action that President Arafat\r\ninitiated will be continued and that the next stage will\r\nsee a real activation of the peace process and a return\r\nby both parties to the negotiating table, especially\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\ngiven the increased attention by the main international\r\nparties with a view to reactivating the peace process\r\nand proposing serious initiatives in this regard.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I call on the\r\nobserver of Palestine.\r\nMs. Barghouti (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nWith great sorrow and sadness, the Palestinian\r\nleadership and the entire Palestinian people wish it to\r\nbe known that President Arafat — the leader, the\r\nteacher, the son and the symbol of Palestine, the\r\narchitect of its current national movement, the hero of\r\nall of its battles for freedom and independence —\r\npassed away at the dawn of this day.\r\nPresident Arafat has left this world, and his great\r\nheart has stilled. His pure spirit has returned to its\r\ncreator. But he will remain as long as his great people\r\nremain, because he was a leader of their political\r\nstruggle and their great march to build a national\r\nidentity on their national soil. He was the symbol of\r\ntheir aspiration for the establishment of an independent\r\nPalestinian State, with its capital at Al-Quds al-Sharif,\r\nand for their liberation from the shackles of\r\ndisplacement, refugee status and occupation. Today we\r\nhave lost the great leader of our struggle, one who\r\nstrove for the freedom of his nation — the great leader\r\nof the movement for national liberation and\r\nindependence. But he has left us a great universal and\r\nnational legacy — one that represents our hope for a\r\nbright future of peace, freedom and development for\r\nour people and for all peoples.\r\nPresident Arafat has passed on — he who was\r\nraised on the streets of Jerusalem and who lived his life\r\nin the hope that it would become the capital of an\r\nindependent Palestine. Today, his tomb looks towards\r\nAl-Quds al-Sharif. He will lie close to Al-Aqsa, with a\r\nhandful of the soil of Al-Quds al-Sharif.\r\nIn two days’ time we will celebrate the thirtieth\r\nanniversary of the historic statement delivered by\r\nPresident Arafat to the Assembly in 1974, the\r\nstatement that placed the Palestinian people and their\r\nlegitimate political rights on the international agenda\r\nand made the question of Palestine one of the most\r\nprominent just causes. He introduced the cause of the\r\nPalestinian people to the Assembly not just as a\r\nhumanitarian question or a question of refugees, but as\r\nan issue involving a people struggling for their right to\r\nself-determination and independence. Since that time,\r\nthe United Nations has addressed the question of\r\nPalestine in all its aspects and by every means in\r\nfulfilment of its permanent legal, moral and political\r\nresponsibility towards the Palestinian people.\r\nThe Palestinian people will miss President\r\nArafat’s great courage, attachment to principle, clear\r\nstrategic vision and wise leadership. But the\r\nPalestinian people can take solace in the knowledge\r\nthat they do not stand alone in their just struggle for\r\nfreedom and independence. The generous support of all\r\nmembers of the Assembly means a great deal to us and\r\ngives us confidence in the justice of our cause and the\r\ninevitability of our triumph. We thank the Assembly,\r\nthe Secretary-General and all fraternal and friendly\r\nStates for their sincere expressions of condolence and\r\ntheir warm sentiments, which we greatly appreciate.\r\nWe will be sure to convey them to the Palestinian\r\nleadership and to the family of the late President.\r\nIn this regard, we would like to inform the\r\nAssembly that the mission of Palestine will be open\r\nfrom 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Monday and Tuesday, 15 and\r\n16 November, to all delegations wishing to express\r\ntheir condolences on the passing of the President.\r\nWe are of God, and to Him we return.\r\nAgenda item 39 (continued)\r\nStrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian\r\nand disaster relief assistance of the United Nations,\r\nincluding special economic assistance\r\n(a) Strengthening of the coordination of emergency\r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/59/93 and\r\nA/59/374)\r\n(c) Assistance to the Palestinian people\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/59/121)\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.24)\r\nMr. Zain (Malaysia): I would like first of all to\r\nexpress our deepest sorrow and grief over the untimely\r\npassing of President Yasser Arafat and to convey our\r\ncondolences to the Palestinian people.\r\nMy delegation would like to express its\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive report under agenda item 39 (c),\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\n“Assistance to the Palestinian people”, covering the\r\nperiod May 2003 to April 2004, as contained in\r\ndocument A/59/121.\r\nThe past year has been marked by dramatic\r\nevents. It had offered new hope of a peaceful solution\r\nto the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, pursuant to the\r\npublication by the Quartet of the performance-based\r\nroad map. Hopes were subsequently raised even further\r\nwhen the Prime Ministers of Israel and of Palestine\r\ncommitted themselves to working collectively towards\r\nthe full implementation of the road map. The Aqaba\r\nSummit had also lent necessary impetus in that\r\nconnection. However, the implementation of the road\r\nmap has stalled, thereby rendering the achievement of\r\nthe envisaged peaceful solution elusive. Even as we\r\nmeet here today, events in and relating to the Middle\r\nEast region are still unfolding with uncertainty.\r\nAlthough they may not necessarily be at the\r\ncentre of global and political attention, the role and\r\nfunctions of United Nations agencies and other\r\nhumanitarian organizations in the occupied territories\r\nare crucial and indispensable. Malaysia has noted with\r\nutmost concern that, as pointed out in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General, the provision by United Nations\r\nagencies and programmes of a variety of types of\r\nassistance to the Palestinian people has as its backdrop\r\nan increasingly difficult humanitarian situation in the\r\noccupied Palestinian territory.\r\nSuch assistance has been provided, and continues\r\nto be provided, under difficult circumstances, in the\r\nface of the dire consequences of the repressive\r\nadministrative and security regimes and measures\r\nimposed by the Government of Israel. These have\r\nnegatively affected the well-being of the Palestinian\r\npeople. They also hamper the ability of United Nations\r\nagencies in the field to carry out their work.\r\nMy delegation strongly urges Israel to allow\r\nunfettered access to staff members of United Nations\r\nagencies and humanitarian workers in the occupied\r\nterritories. We are alarmed over an observation in the\r\nreport that it has become increasingly difficult for\r\nUnited Nations agencies to operate there, given that the\r\nimportance of those agencies and their role in the\r\noccupied territories has never been greater.\r\nAs a matter of priority, the Government of Israel\r\nmust ease restrictions and work closely with United\r\nNations agencies, donors and humanitarian\r\norganizations to ensure that aid and development\r\nprojects are delivered in a timely and comprehensive\r\nmanner. We believe that the effective steps currently\r\nbeing undertaken by the Palestinian Authority to\r\naccommodate Israel’s security concerns will facilitate\r\nsuch an effort.\r\nAll of this notwithstanding, Malaysia is satisfied\r\nwith the performance of the relevant United Nations\r\nagencies in carrying out various efforts and\r\nprogrammes to provide a variety of types of economic,\r\nhumanitarian and social assistance to Palestinian\r\ncivilians and institutions, as reflected, in considerable\r\ndetail, in paragraphs 21 through 64 of the report. The\r\never-growing sector of “unmet needs”, as documented\r\nin paragraphs 80 through 84 of the report, requires\r\nparticularly focused attention. All these efforts and\r\nprogrammes, if successfully implemented, could\r\ncertainly create the necessary environment to facilitate\r\nthe achievement of sustainable peace in the region.\r\nWe are concerned, however, that the\r\nimplementation of practically all of these efforts and\r\nprogrammes is being hindered by a lack of financial\r\nand other resources. We urge the international donor\r\ncommunity to increase its contributions to this cause.\r\nThe international community must not lose its focus\r\ndespite the challenges facing it and the sense of\r\nhopelessness. For their part, the Government and the\r\npeople of Malaysia will continue to extend assistance,\r\nin their own small way and within their means, to our\r\nbrothers and sisters in Palestine.\r\nMalaysia supports the continued efforts being\r\nmade to support the peace process by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Special Coordinator for the Middle\r\nEast Peace Process and Personal Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General to the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization and the Palestinian Authority. We\r\nwelcome the attempts that have been made to ensure\r\neffective coordination between the relevant institutions\r\nof the Palestinian Authority, the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community. Malaysia urges the Special\r\nCoordinator and his Office to continue with such\r\nefforts and to intensify them where possible and\r\nnecessary.\r\nHowever, the success of those efforts, as\r\neveryone knows, will be highly contingent upon the\r\nfullest cooperation extended by the Government of\r\nIsrael and its apparatus. Therefore, we call upon Israel,\r\nthe occupying Power, to cooperate in the interests of\r\nensuring peace in the long term.\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nThe construction by Israel of the separation wall\r\nin the occupied Palestinian territory, including in and\r\naround East Jerusalem, has added a new dimension to\r\nthe problem of providing assistance to the Palestinian\r\npeople. It has had an adverse impact on the living\r\nconditions and freedom of movement of Palestinian\r\ncivilians. The impact of the wall on Palestinian lives\r\nand on the territorial integrity of a future State of\r\nPalestine is prejudicial to the very idea of the two-State\r\nsolution, as envisaged in Security Council resolution\r\n1397 (2002). The International Court of Justice, in its\r\nadvisory opinion rendered last July, concluded that the\r\nconstruction of the wall in the occupied territories was\r\ncontrary to international law, that such construction\r\nshould be stopped and reversed, that those completed\r\nsections of the wall should be dismantled and removed,\r\nand that Israel should make reparations to those\r\naffected by such construction. The General Assembly\r\nresponded expeditiously to the advisory opinion by\r\nadopting resolution ES-10/15. We urge all Member\r\nStates, in particular Israel, to take all measures\r\nnecessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of\r\nthe resolution. We also urge the Security Council to\r\nseriously look into this matter.\r\nNo matter how substantial the amount of\r\nfinancial resources that are available, humanitarian and\r\nfinancial assistance will not forever and by itself\r\nresolve the political crisis affecting the lives of the\r\nPalestinians and the Israelis. The solution remains in\r\nthe ending of occupation, respect for international law\r\nand the achievement of a peaceful resolution of the\r\nconflict. The events of the past year have demonstrated\r\nto us how desperately the people of the Middle East\r\nneed a political solution to their protracted conflict.\r\nPeace will remain elusive unless all parties concerned,\r\nthe region and the wider international community are\r\nprepared to play their part responsibly and with a high\r\ndegree of political will.\r\nMy delegation reaffirms the permanent\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations, including the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council, towards\r\nthe question of Palestine until it is resolved in all its\r\naspects on the basis of international law. As a member\r\nof the Quartet, the United Nations is well placed to\r\nplay a pivotal role towards achieving a just,\r\ncomprehensive and lasting peace settlement and\r\ntowards achieving the inalienable rights of the\r\nPalestinian people. In that connection, my delegation\r\nbelieves that it would be only sensible for Member\r\nStates to join the consensus in support of draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.24 on this agenda item.\r\nMr. Laurin (Canada): Canada would like to take\r\nthis opportunity to present its vision on strengthening\r\nthe coordination of humanitarian assistance.\r\nCoordination is vital because of its direct impact in the\r\nfield. Ultimately, we all are working to meet the needs\r\nof affected populations. Protecting civilians in armed\r\nconflict is central to this objective.\r\nCanada was pleased with the Secretary-General’s\r\ndecision to emphasize the protection of civilians in\r\narmed conflict as an annual theme for the treaty\r\nratification campaign. This is an important opportunity\r\nfor States to show their commitment to fulfilling their\r\npromise under paragraph 26 of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration to “expand and strengthen the protection of\r\ncivilians in complex emergencies”.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s decision also coincides\r\nwith the fifth anniversary of two pivotal Security\r\nCouncil resolutions related to this topic: resolution\r\n1265 (1999) of September 1999 and resolution 1296\r\n(2000) of April 2000. Those two resolutions, along\r\nwith the resulting discussions and actions, represent a\r\nturning point where the international community\r\nrecognized — beyond the security of humanitarian\r\nconvoys — the security of people and the need to act to\r\nprotect them. We are pleased with the progress that has\r\nbeen made in recent years, but now we must work to\r\nimplement this normative framework.\r\nThe international community must react strongly\r\nto violations of international humanitarian law and\r\nhuman rights. It must promote the responsibility of\r\naffected States to ensure that civilians are protected,\r\nand be prepared to react when those States do not\r\nprotect civilians. We must make more effective use of\r\nthe tools we have developed over the past five years to\r\nprotect civilians, and we must create new ones when\r\nwarranted. An energetic battle must be waged against\r\nimpunity.\r\nWe believe that specialized United Nations\r\ncountry teams and humanitarian and resident\r\ncoordinators must be better equipped to address\r\nprotection-related issues. Their ability to effectively\r\nidentify those issues and to develop relevant strategies\r\nto meet the challenges that occur in crisis situations\r\nmust be enhanced. Our efforts should take gender\r\nissues into account. We hope that the Inter-Agency\r\nStanding Committee’s recently completed review of its\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\n1999 policy statement on gender mainstreaming in\r\nhumanitarian assistance will be able to support efforts\r\nin that regard.\r\nWe also think that regional organizations can and\r\nmust play a more active role in promoting civilian\r\nprotection. We strongly encourage the United Nations\r\nto enhance its dialogue with those organizations so\r\nthey can do so. We commend the African Union’s\r\ncreation of the position of Special Representative for\r\nthe protection of civilians in armed conflict, and we are\r\nfollowing its cooperation with the United Nations with\r\ngreat interest.\r\nThere have recently been timely, highly\r\nconstructive discussions among humanitarian actors\r\nabout how to increase the security of personnel while\r\nmaintaining a presence in difficult field situations. We\r\nattach great importance to the efforts and\r\nrecommendations proposed by the Secretary-General\r\non how to strengthen the United Nations security\r\nmanagement system. In particular, we support the\r\nemphasis placed on decentralization in the field. This\r\nshould begin to respond to certain concerns expressed\r\nby humanitarian actors. We invite the United Nations\r\nhumanitarian agencies to support the reformed security\r\nmanagement system and to ensure that it responds to\r\ntheir needs.\r\nIt is important to clarify the interrelationship\r\nbetween political, humanitarian and military actors.\r\nThe clarification of each role is tied to the evolving\r\nsecurity context in the United Nations. This has notable\r\neffects on humanitarian coordination in the field. States\r\nmust continue to ensure that military activities do not\r\ninadvertently undermine humanitarian principles and\r\nactivities. The guidelines on civil-military coordination\r\nissued by the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA) are a useful reference.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIn principle, Canada supports the concept of\r\nintegrated missions but believes that determining when\r\nrecourse to that kind of mission is required should be\r\nfacilitated by increased dialogue with United Nations\r\nhumanitarian assistance actors. Integrated missions\r\nmake it possible to react to crises in a more consistent\r\nand effective manner, in particular by taking\r\nhumanitarian factors into account in political decisions\r\nand by strengthening the protection of civilians. The\r\nsuccess of such missions depends on solid cooperation\r\nbetween political, peacekeeping, humanitarian and\r\ndevelopment segments of the United Nations under the\r\ncritical leadership of the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General and the humanitarian and resident\r\ncoordinators. We are pleased that OCHA and the\r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations are working\r\ntogether to assess the experience acquired to date in\r\nimplementing integrated missions.\r\nProviding timely, flexible resources that are\r\nproportional to the needs of various crises remains a\r\ndifficult objective to achieve. For the past year, donors\r\nhave made constant progress in pursuing the Good\r\nHumanitarian Donorship initiative. Donors are\r\nendeavouring to establish a comprehensive definition\r\nof humanitarian action for statistical purposes and to\r\nharmonize the reporting requirements of humanitarian\r\norganizations. Last October, donors met in Canada to\r\nrenew their commitment to making progress and to\r\nidentify ways to give concrete expression to that\r\ncommitment. The Good Humanitarian Donorship\r\ninitiative is part of the long-term outlook, and its\r\nsuccess will help improve the international response to\r\npopulations in crisis situations.\r\nWhile endeavouring to become better\r\nhumanitarian donors, we are striving to respond more\r\nconsistently to transition situations. Donors themselves\r\noften undermine their humanitarian assistance\r\ninvestments by not helping the target countries to\r\nimplement the necessary foundations for lasting peace\r\nand stability when they emerge from a crisis. In that\r\nregard, we appreciated the discussions among States at\r\nthe Economic and Social Council last July, and we\r\nbelieve that such dialogue must continue. We also\r\nbelieve that United Nations agencies must play a\r\nleadership role in helping the international community\r\nmeet that challenge.\r\nAgain this year, millions of people throughout the\r\nworld were seriously affected by natural disasters.\r\nUnfortunately, the hurricane season did not spare the\r\nAmericas and Asia, and this is a sad reminder of our\r\ncontinued vulnerability in the face of such\r\ncatastrophes. They demonstrated the benefits of relying\r\non the strengths of existing multilateral, regional and\r\nlocal partnerships to avert disaster and to intervene in\r\nemergencies. More than ever, States play a central role\r\nin ensuring that natural disaster prevention is a top\r\nnational priority.\r\nIn closing, I wish to say that effective\r\nhumanitarian action is not an abstract concept. In the\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nfield it finds direct expression in responding to the\r\nrights of people in danger. We must therefore take steps\r\nthat are highly tangible as well as political. Many\r\nexamples come to mind: ratifying and implementing\r\ninternational instruments that contribute to the\r\nprotection of civilians, promoting General Assembly\r\nresolutions that allow for improved international\r\nresponse, and building the capacities of both countries\r\nin crisis situations and the organizations that support\r\nthem. Because of its fundamental importance, Canada\r\nwill continue to promote more effective humanitarian\r\naction.\r\nMr. Kim Sam-hoon (Republic of Korea): Before\r\nI begin my statement, I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to extend my deep condolences to the\r\npeople of Palestine on the passing away of President\r\nYasser Arafat early this morning.\r\nI would like to begin by commending the\r\nSecretary-General for his unswerving dedication to the\r\nOrganization’s work on behalf of the world’s needy\r\npeoples. I also thank the Under-Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Jan Egeland, and his staff at the United Nations\r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\r\n(OCHA) for their focused approach in dealing with the\r\nissue of coordinating emergency humanitarian\r\nassistance. We believe that, with strengthened\r\ncoordination, humanitarian assistance will more\r\neffectively reach those in need, and we fully support\r\nthat important goal.\r\nThe importance of cooperation and coordination\r\namong United Nations agencies in humanitarian work\r\ncannot be overstated. In the area of disaster\r\nmanagement and risk reduction, we believe that\r\nhumanitarian and development organizations should\r\nwork together and strengthen coordination so that they\r\nmay make better use of lessons learned. This\r\nknowledge-sharing will allow them not only to respond\r\nbetter to immediate crises but also to more\r\nsystematically develop institutional and legislative risk\r\nreduction mechanisms.\r\nFurthermore, information management is a\r\ncritical component of emergency response because\r\neffective emergency response depends on access to\r\ntimely and reliable information. In that regard, my\r\ndelegation fully supports the efforts of the Inter-\r\nAgency Task Force on Disaster Reduction to\r\nstandardize, aggregate and link disaster-related data\r\nfrom various sources.\r\nThe recent kidnapping of three United Nations\r\nelection monitors in Afghanistan underscores the point\r\nthat the work of the United Nations in assisting people\r\nin need around the world has become an immensely\r\ndangerous endeavour. The Republic of Korea believes\r\nthat there is no higher priority for the United Nations\r\nas an organization than to ensure the safety and\r\nsecurity of its own personnel. Indeed, in many parts of\r\nthe world, security is a prerequisite for programme\r\ndelivery. Moreover, lack of security and inadequate\r\nattention to the safety of United Nations and local staff\r\nin the field can have pernicious effects, such as eroding\r\nstaff morale and stifling initiative. Accordingly, we\r\nexpress our deep concern at the recent heightened\r\nattacks against the United Nations and other\r\nhumanitarian personnel. There can be no excuse for\r\nsuch horrific actions towards aid workers, and we hope\r\nto see the perpetrators of these attacks brought to\r\njustice as soon as possible.\r\nIn this regard, the Republic of Korea welcomes\r\nthe Secretary-General’s recent initiative to strengthen\r\nsecurity for United Nations humanitarian assistance\r\nand other staff in response to the new security climate.\r\nWe believe that many of the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposals, such as an integrated security structure at\r\nthe field level and at Headquarters, merit serious\r\nconsideration. At the same time, there are some aspects\r\nof the proposal that require further clarification. We\r\nlook forward to participating in a rigorous discussion\r\non the Secretary-General’s initiative.\r\nAs the Secretary-General rightly pointed out,\r\ngender differences and inequalities influence the\r\ncapacities and vulnerabilities of affected populations\r\nand affect the overall effectiveness of humanitarian\r\nresponse. In this connection, we support the renewed\r\nefforts to strengthen gender analysis in the common\r\nhumanitarian action plans. Moreover, it is essential for\r\nus to ensure that projects included within the\r\nConsolidated Appeals Process (CAP) coincide with an\r\nagreed analysis of priority needs and response.\r\nNevertheless, we are concerned that there\r\ncontinue to be serious gaps in integrating gender into\r\nhumanitarian response and assistance. The systematic\r\nimplementation of gender mainstreaming guidelines in\r\nfield operations remains weak. There is also a need to\r\nincorporate gender and age-disaggregated data into\r\neach key sector of the planning of humanitarian\r\nassistance. In all of these efforts, my delegation\r\nbelieves it is essential that we remain cognizant of\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nwomen’s unique role and plight in emergency\r\nsituations and that we tailor our response accordingly.\r\nGender is not a discrete issue to be tackled\r\nindependently. Rather, it is central to our efforts to\r\nprovide effective humanitarian assistance during\r\nemergency situations.\r\nIn an era of scarce and dwindling resources, the\r\nRepublic of Korea attaches great importance to the\r\ntransparent and appropriate allocation of humanitarian\r\nassistance funds. We support the Good Humanitarian\r\nDonorship initiative, which aims to ensure that\r\nhumanitarian assistance is provided in accordance with\r\nhumanitarian principles and based on demonstrable\r\nneeds. Furthermore, we anticipate that the needs\r\nassessment framework and matrix, recently developed\r\nwithin the Consolidated Appeals Process, will allow\r\ncountry teams to better organize information on\r\nbeneficiaries. Moreover, my delegation is of the view\r\nthat the stringent monitoring of humanitarian\r\nassistance funds disbursed during emergency situations\r\nis crucial to ensure the optimal utilization of scarce\r\nresources. For this reason, we remain strong supporters\r\nof the Appeals Process system, because we believe that\r\nit helps ensure that humanitarian assistance actually\r\nreaches those in need.\r\nNew and complex emergencies are increasingly\r\ncharacterized by interrelated humanitarian crises.\r\nEffectively tackling these emergencies requires\r\nviewing humanitarian assistance as one component in a\r\nlong-term effort towards rehabilitation and\r\ndevelopment. Accordingly, a focus on the broader\r\ntransition from relief to development is vital to\r\nensuring long-term success. In this regard, we\r\nunderscore the importance of finding the appropriate\r\nbalance between short-term quick-impact projects and\r\nlonger-term institution-building, particularly in an\r\nenvironment of scarce resources.\r\nThe complex emergencies of the twenty-first\r\ncentury demand new multifaceted solutions.\r\nStrengthening the coordination of humanitarian\r\nassistance during these emergencies should remain a\r\nkey priority of the United Nations, and the Republic of\r\nKorea firmly pledges its support towards this end.\r\nMr. Sinaga (Indonesia): Allow me at the outset\r\nto express my delegation’s deep condolences to the\r\nGovernment and people of Palestine with regard to the\r\npassing away of President Yasser Arafat today.\r\nMy delegation wishes to express our sincere\r\nappreciation for the reports of the Secretary-General on\r\nhumanitarian assistance issues (A/59/93, A/59/374).\r\nMy delegation notes with concern the scale and large\r\nnumber of natural disasters that occurred in 2003 and\r\n2004, which have affected more than 284 million\r\npeople and caused more than $65 billion worth of\r\nmaterial damage. We are pleased that the timely and\r\neffective response by Governments and the\r\ninternational community to these disasters has\r\ncontinued to be critical in saving lives and mitigating\r\ntheir effects. We also support the efforts of the United\r\nNations to expand the participation of Member States\r\nin its disaster response network as well as foster a\r\nregional approach to natural disaster response.\r\nCurrent trends in urbanization, environmental\r\ndegradation and climate change imply that natural and\r\nman-made emergencies will continue to increase in\r\ntheir regularity and intensity. In this regard, we as\r\nMember States need to improve our response, capacity\r\nand preparedness so as to reduce vulnerability. We\r\nneed to continue to improve disaster management\r\nabilities and enhance regional capacity while\r\nembracing risk reduction as a core principle.\r\nAllow me to turn now to the issue of\r\nhumanitarian assistance given to countless undergoing\r\nor emerging from a humanitarian crisis, induced by\r\nconflict or natural causes. While I confirm my\r\ndelegation’s appreciation to the United Nations for its\r\nsupport of the countless people affected by natural and\r\nman-made disasters, we are concerned that the global\r\nlevel of financing for humanitarian operations often\r\nremains insufficient, especially in African countries,\r\nwhere the magnitude of the problem is considerable.\r\nBeyond this, the core issue in the transition from relief\r\nto development is that funds are often insufficient for\r\nimplementation programmes.\r\nIndonesia would like to emphasize the\r\nimportance of enhanced international cooperation,\r\nincluding through the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations, with the consent of the affected\r\ncountries and according to the principles of humanity,\r\nimpartiality and neutrality, as guaranteed by\r\ninternational law and emphasized in General Assembly\r\nresolution 46/182 of 19 December 1991. That would\r\nassist countries in their efforts to build capacity and\r\nhelp them to predict, prepare for and respond to natural\r\ndisasters.\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nInternational awareness of humanitarian problems\r\nhas grown considerably over the years. In that\r\nconnection, many Governments have greatly improved\r\ntheir preparedness in, for example, facilitating the\r\nreturn and resettlement of refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons.\r\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said with\r\nrespect to the situation in Palestine. Despite the\r\nincreasingly difficult humanitarian situation there,\r\nUnited Nations agencies continue to render assistance\r\nto the Palestinian people. Such assistance is provided\r\nunder complex circumstances, characterized by\r\nclosures, curfews, incursions and other measures\r\nimposed by the Israeli military, all of which negatively\r\naffect the well-being of the Palestinian people and\r\nhinder the efforts of the United Nations. Indonesia\r\njoins the community of nations in calling upon the\r\nGovernment of Israel to halt all actions that encroach\r\non the territorial rights of the Palestinians, to strictly\r\nobserve the provisions of international law and to\r\nimplement the road map.\r\nFurthermore, it must be emphasized that the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees (UNHCR) should remain a purely\r\nhumanitarian and non-political agency. Humanitarian\r\nassistance must be delivered only with the consent of\r\nthe affected country and with respect for the\r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and national unity of\r\nStates. We must maintain the practice that the affected\r\nState must have the primary role in coordinating\r\nhumanitarian relief efforts, with UNHCR providing\r\nsupport as requested by the State.\r\nMr. Kulyk (Ukraine): At the outset, I would like\r\nto commend the Secretary-General for the thorough\r\nanalysis and action-oriented recommendations\r\ncontained in his report on strengthening the\r\ncoordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of\r\nthe United Nations (A/59/93).\r\nMy delegation notes with satisfaction the\r\nexpanded activities of the Office for the Coordination\r\nof Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the efforts to\r\nstrengthen the role of the Inter-Agency Standing\r\nCommittee as one of the key mechanisms for policy\r\nalignment and integrated response on the part of all\r\nUnited Nations agencies.\r\nLooking back at developments over the past year,\r\none should recognize the persistence of serious\r\nhumanitarian challenges. Restricted humanitarian\r\naccess, non-compliance with international\r\nhumanitarian law and humanitarian principles and\r\ncontinued attacks on humanitarian workers could all\r\nagain be mentioned in that regard, but it is even more\r\ndisturbing that humanitarian concerns such as the\r\nspread of HIV/AIDS, sexual exploitation and the abuse\r\nof civilians in humanitarian crises have been looming\r\nlarge.\r\nMy delegation appreciates the progress made in\r\nstrengthening the United Nations response in the areas\r\nof emergency preparedness, contingency planning and\r\ndisaster management at both the system-wide and the\r\nfield levels.\r\nAs the Secretary-General’s report emphasizes, the\r\npast year saw a number of tragic losses of humanitarian\r\npersonnel and alarming disrespect for their work and\r\nspecial role. Such a climate of insecurity cannot be\r\ntolerated. My delegation takes this opportunity to urge\r\nthe Governments and parties concerned to fully ensure\r\nthe safety and security of humanitarian staff and the\r\nlegal prosecution of those responsible for attacks\r\nagainst United Nations personnel.\r\nUkraine is concerned at the alarming spread of\r\nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic in humanitarian crises, which\r\nfurther amplifies the suffering of the civilian\r\npopulation. It is particularly discouraging that\r\nHIV/AIDS, coupled with famine and natural disasters,\r\nis driving ever-larger parts of nations towards\r\ndestitution. In that context, we would like to stress the\r\nneed to ensure the full and effective implementation of\r\nthe General Assembly’s Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS, which sets the stage and the agenda for\r\ndealing decisively with the epidemic in conflict\r\nsituations. Integration of HIV/AIDS considerations\r\ninto humanitarian programmes, beginning with\r\nconsolidated appeals and humanitarian action plans,\r\nare also essential to facilitate a comprehensive\r\nresponse to HIV/AIDS in emergency settings.\r\nEfforts to address that problem will be more\r\nsuccessful if they are reinforced by concrete action on\r\nthe part of Member States, particularly by developing\r\nnational strategies that address the spread of HIV\r\namong humanitarian workers and international\r\npeacekeepers. As one of the major troop-contributing\r\ncountries to United Nations peacekeeping operations,\r\nUkraine has been among the first to incorporate\r\nHIV/AIDS awareness, prevention and safe behaviour\r\nin predeployment training for its peacekeeping units.\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nWith respect to humanitarian financing issues, my\r\ndelegation notes with appreciation the reported\r\nprogress in a number of areas under the Good\r\nHumanitarian Donorship initiative. We welcome the\r\ndevelopment of the United Nations Needs Assessment\r\nFramework and Matrix and the work on a commonly\r\nagreed definition of what constitutes humanitarian\r\nassistance and component elements. In our view, it is\r\nequally important to ensure that the assistance provided\r\nis effectively managed and channelled to the priority\r\nareas.\r\nWe would also like to stress the need for better\r\nalignment between humanitarian assistance and long-\r\nterm development strategies. The establishment of a\r\nstanding mechanism comprised of the secretariats of\r\nthe Executive Committee on Humanitarian Affairs, the\r\nUnited Nations Development Group and the Executive\r\nCommittee for Peace and Security is only a partial\r\nresponse to the needs of ensuring effective transition\r\nfrom relief to development. Therefore, ways to\r\nenhance cooperation between humanitarian agencies\r\nand development institutions should be further\r\nexplored.\r\nWith respect to the transition from relief to\r\ndevelopment, I cannot but refer to the experience of\r\nUkraine in mitigating the consequences of the\r\nChernobyl disaster. Now, more than 18 years after that\r\ntragic accident, the impact of the catastrophe on the\r\nlives of millions of affected people continues to pose\r\nan enormous challenge to my country. My delegation\r\nbelieves that the recent transfer of coordination\r\nfunctions for Chernobyl-related activities of the United\r\nNations from OCHA to the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme will stimulate resource\r\nmobilization and enhance the impact of the\r\nprogrammatic activities in this field. We also strongly\r\nhope for the continued support of the donor community\r\nin funding relevant development and health projects in\r\nthe field.\r\nAs we attach special significance to the role of\r\nthe United Nations in strengthening the international\r\nresponse to the consequences of the Chernobyl\r\ncatastrophe, Ukraine, together with other interested\r\ndelegations, took the initiative of planning a special\r\nplenary meeting in the spring of 2006, within the\r\nframework of the sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly to honour the victims of the Chernobyl\r\ndisaster and to raise public awareness about the long-\r\nterm consequences of the catastrophe. I hope the\r\ninitiative will be supported by all Member States, and I\r\nencourage representatives of civil society, the private\r\nsector and the donor community to intensify their\r\nefforts in addressing Chernobyl-related problems.\r\nIn that context, my delegation would like\r\nparticularly to highlight the increased role of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs). Among recent\r\nexamples, I am pleased to note that the Ukraine-based\r\ninternational NGO Chernobyl Union, which unites\r\n7 million people affected by the Chernobyl catastrophe,\r\npresented its Mercy Ambassador award medal to the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations for his\r\noutstanding efforts aimed at mitigating and minimizing\r\nthe long-term consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.\r\nMr. Sawford (Australia): Today, in too many\r\nplaces around the world, communities are affected by\r\ncrises, natural disasters and conflict. This has a very\r\nhuman cost, but it also sets back development and\r\nundermines efforts to reduce poverty and achieve\r\nsustainable development. Australia continues to\r\nprovide rapid and generous support for the survivors of\r\ncrises and disasters, both within our region and\r\nglobally. We contribute to relief efforts for emergencies\r\nwherever they occur, but our highest priority is the\r\nAsia-Pacific region, a region that is often ravaged by\r\nnatural disasters and that is not immune to conflict.\r\nMember States are focusing on how best to ensure the\r\nmost effective response to humanitarian needs. I would\r\nlike to highlight seven of the issues Australia considers\r\nessential in this area.\r\nThe first is the protection of civilians. Protection\r\nof civilians affected by armed conflict is primarily the\r\nresponsibility of national Governments. Sadly, we need\r\nlook no further than Darfur to see evidence of how\r\nviolence, especially sexual violence, has become a\r\ndeliberate tactic to terrorize communities. The use of\r\nrape in conflict is particularly abhorrent.\r\nThe second is to improve security and access for\r\nhumanitarian personnel. Humanitarian assistance\r\ncannot be delivered if those delivering it are not able to\r\noperate safely. But the very nature of humanitarian\r\naction means that it is often needed most in areas of\r\ninstability. The challenge is to manage the risk\r\neffectively. We know that the Secretary-General has\r\nalso made this a priority in his consideration of new\r\nmeasures to ensure the safety of United Nations\r\npersonnel.\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nThird, we must integrate humanitarian assistance\r\ninto the broader United Nations response to complex\r\nemergencies, but in a way that upholds humanitarian\r\nprinciples. More needs to be done to better define,\r\nassess and operationalize integrated missions. Australia\r\nis pleased to be supporting the review, addressing just\r\nthese issues, conducted jointly by the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the Department\r\nof Peacekeeping Operations and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Group.\r\nThe fourth issue is using humanitarian response\r\nto lay the groundwork for recovery and reconstruction.\r\nSaving lives is only the beginning. Recovery must be a\r\nshared priority for humanitarian, development, peace\r\nand security actors. We are supportive of the focus that\r\nthe United Nations is giving to transition and are keen\r\nto contribute actively to discussions on these issues.\r\nThe fifth is to find more effective ways to\r\nrespond to natural disasters, to prevent, prepare for and\r\nmitigate their effects and to integrate disaster risk\r\nreduction into national development strategies — a key\r\npoint for next year’s World Conference on Disaster\r\nReduction, to be held in Japan.\r\nSixth, we must strengthen further the system for\r\nhumanitarian coordination. Again, while some progress\r\nhas been made, events in Darfur earlier this year, as\r\nagencies scrambled to meet vast humanitarian needs,\r\nindicate that there is still room for improvement,\r\nparticularly in the area of preparedness.\r\nSeventh and last, we must ensure that gender\r\naspects are properly assessed and are integrated into\r\nthe planning, implementation and evaluation of\r\nhumanitarian action. We also recognize the critical part\r\nwomen play as peace-builders. To find solutions which\r\nlead to lasting peace, we must find better ways to\r\nharness their potential as agents for positive change.\r\nAt the Economic and Social Council, Australia\r\nemphasized our support for the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs and its role. I\r\nwould like to reiterate that support here today. We look\r\nforward to continuing to work with the Office and\r\nother humanitarian actors within and outside the\r\nUnited Nations system. Our collective aims must be to\r\nstrengthen humanitarian policy and advocacy, to\r\nincrease the effectiveness and impact of humanitarian\r\nprogrammes and to define ways to effectively monitor\r\nour performance. The ultimate goal of all of this, of\r\ncourse, is to improve the outcome for people affected\r\nby conflict, crisis or disaster.\r\nMs. Feller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): I would\r\nlike to echo the expression of condolences extended to\r\nthe Palestinian people by the Chairman of the Group of\r\nLatin American and Caribbean States upon the death of\r\nPresident Yasser Arafat.\r\nMore than 2,500 deaths were caused by the\r\nhurricane season which struck the Caribbean barely a\r\nmonth ago, in addition to the thousands of injured and\r\nthe almost total destruction of infrastructure. We know\r\nthat most of the deaths occurred among the poorest\r\nsection of the population, who were without access to\r\ninformation or basic services.\r\nIn the past 12 months, approximately 285 million\r\npeople have been affected by natural disasters, and the\r\nproperty losses amounted to $65 billion. Those are\r\nextremely disquieting figures, especially because, in\r\nspite of the tremendous efforts of the international\r\ncommunity, the frequency with which these disasters\r\ntake place has markedly increased — and with it, the\r\nnumber of victims.\r\nIt is vital for us to stop just reacting to the\r\nsituation and to develop specific long-term plans of\r\naction. As in many other areas, our capacity to respond\r\nto natural disasters will improve in proportion to our\r\nefforts to promote development. In this regard, and as\r\npart of a comprehensive strategy, we need to focus our\r\nefforts as States and as the international community on\r\nguaranteeing full access to basic health services,\r\neducation and information for the most marginalized\r\npopulations.\r\nLikewise, the effectiveness of early warning\r\nmechanisms will be gauged by the extent to which they\r\ninvolve members of the communities in disaster-prone\r\nareas, especially those that are particularly vulnerable\r\nbecause of poverty and social exclusion.\r\nMy delegation reaffirms the principles of\r\nhumanity, neutrality and impartiality which govern the\r\nprovision of humanitarian assistance both in cases of\r\nnatural disasters and in complex emergencies.\r\nLikewise, we believe that it is the key responsibility of\r\nthe State to initiate, organize, coordinate and provide\r\nhumanitarian assistance in its territory. In that\r\nconnection, our countries should step up their\r\nendeavours to create the right channels, both nationally\r\nand locally, to ensure rapid and efficient delivery of\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nassistance to victims as well as unrestricted access for\r\nhumanitarian personnel to affected areas.\r\nSimilarly, it is the responsibility of States, in\r\nclose cooperation with civil society and humanitarian\r\norganizations, to identify exactly what assistance is\r\nneeded to avoid an uncontrolled flow of aid, which\r\nultimately would fail in its purpose.\r\nAt the same time, the setting of timetables for the\r\nprovision of international assistance is another key\r\npoint. That would ensure resources for the\r\nreconstruction phase, including matters of primary\r\nimportance such as preventing epidemics, rebuilding\r\nand, above all, providing decent living conditions for\r\nvictims.\r\nThe United Nations, particularly the Economic\r\nand Social Council, must strengthen its leadership and\r\ncoordination capacities with regard to the endeavours\r\nof the international community in this regard. We\r\nbelieve it is important to recognize the significant role\r\nplayed in such cases by the communication media and\r\nnon-governmental organizations. For that reason, we\r\nbelieve that, in natural and humanitarian disasters, it is\r\nessential to establish channels of communication with\r\nall actors involved in prevention and in rebuilding, so\r\nas to share experiences, harmonize the indicators used\r\nto measure the effects of disasters and undertake\r\ncomprehensive action.\r\nIt is no secret to anyone that the growing number\r\nof natural disasters is directly linked to the continuing\r\ndestruction of our environment. Thus, it is essential to\r\nbegin by carrying out national plans to protect the\r\nenvironment, as well as to ensure effective\r\nmanagement of natural resources. My delegation would\r\nlike to appeal to all States to sign and ratify the\r\nexisting treaties in this area, particularly the Kyoto\r\nProtocol, whose full implementation would make a\r\nsignificant contribution to stabilizing our ecosystem.\r\nLastly, I wish to stress that humanitarian\r\nassistance is a collective undertaking. It must be\r\ncarried out in accordance with international law and\r\ninternational humanitarian law. Rarely has the\r\ninternational community shown as much solidarity, as\r\nin cases of natural disaster, where political and other\r\ninterests take second place. That should be the general\r\npattern in all cases of humanitarian emergencies. We\r\nneed to continue to redouble our efforts to set up a\r\nclear and more effective strategy for averting tragedies\r\nthat we can prevent.\r\nMr. Baatar (Mongolia): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing my condolences on behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of Mongolia to the bereaved\r\nfamily and the Palestinian people on the passing away\r\nof their father, husband and leader, the late President\r\nYasser Arafat.\r\nMy delegation wishes to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his reports on the agenda items under\r\nconsideration. Mongolia associates itself with the\r\nstatement delivered earlier by the representative of\r\nQatar on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nDuring the past decade, natural disasters have\r\nincreased worldwide. The sevenfold increase in\r\ndisaster fatalities in 2003, as compared with the\r\nprevious year, is a grim reminder of the immense\r\npower of natural disasters. The past year has witnessed\r\ndifferent types of natural disasters in various parts of\r\nthe world, mostly in developing countries. According\r\nto the World Disasters Report 2004, when disasters\r\noccurred in countries with high human development,\r\nan average of 44 people were killed per event, while\r\n300 people per event were killed in countries with low\r\nhuman development. However, when natural hazards\r\ntake place, they do not discriminate between rich or\r\npoor countries. Disasters are a humanitarian challenge\r\nand an impediment to achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nHumanitarian action and disaster reduction is one\r\nof the core functions of the United Nations. The role of\r\nthe United Nations in advocating principles of\r\nneutrality, impartiality, humanity and respect for the\r\nsovereignty of States during humanitarian activities is\r\nvery important. Humanitarian problems should be\r\nsolved through international cooperation and a\r\ncommon approach.\r\nWe share the concern regarding the increased\r\ninvolvement of commercial organizations and military\r\nforces in relief activities. The relevance and\r\nconsequences of the provision of humanitarian\r\nassistance by military actors should be studied\r\ncarefully.\r\nWe welcome the Organization’s effort to respond\r\nto disasters with coherence and effectiveness, while\r\nintegrating immediate relief measures with long-term\r\nstrategies for disaster prevention. The strengthening of\r\nthe coordination of the humanitarian and disaster relief\r\nassistance of the United Nations greatly depends upon\r\nincreased support from the extended donor community.\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nMeanwhile, the United Nations needs to further\r\nexplore mechanisms to ensure that there are\r\nappropriate resources for humanitarian activities.\r\nMongolia supports and stresses the importance of the\r\nGood Humanitarian Donorship initiative.\r\nNatural hazards cannot be avoided, but their\r\ndramatic consequences can be greatly reduced through\r\nappropriate preparedness and risk-reduction measures,\r\nincluding education, technology development, land-use\r\nplanning and environmental protection. Devising\r\nindicators and targets to monitor and to evaluate the\r\nresponses to natural disasters, at the national and\r\nregional levels might be a useful exercise as part of the\r\nendeavours to achieve the Millennium Development\r\nGoals.\r\nThe utilization of modern technology, especially\r\nthe Internet for early warning and alert systems, should\r\nbe further explored and introduced in the field. We\r\nwelcome the new Platform for the Promotion of Early\r\nWarning, which was established in Bonn under the\r\nauspices of the International Strategy for Disaster\r\nReduction.\r\nThe passing year witnessed dramatic and\r\ndisturbing occasions when humanitarian personnel\r\nwere directly attacked while performing their noble\r\nduty. Safety and security are essential preconditions for\r\nthe delivery of humanitarian assistance. Regarding\r\nnational measures taken to prevent and respond to\r\nsecurity incidents that involve the United Nations and\r\nits associated personnel, Mongolia acceded to the\r\nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and\r\nAssociated Personnel in February 2004.\r\nMongolia is vulnerable to a variety of natural\r\ndisasters such as severe snowfalls, droughts, flash\r\nfloods and earthquakes. At the start of the new\r\nmillennium, Mongolia had already been hit hard by\r\nthree years of countrywide droughts in summer and by\r\ncalamitous winters. In particular, the economically\r\nvital livestock industry was devastated. The country is\r\nstill trying hard to recover from that disaster. Mongolia\r\nis grateful to the United Nations and other donors for\r\nthe assistance they have given and for the positive\r\nresponse to the joint appeal by the United Nations and\r\nthe Government of Mongolia during that time.\r\nFurthermore, I would like to note our\r\nappreciation of the work of the United Nations to\r\nstrengthen and develop a variety of disaster response\r\ntools for assisting and supporting national response\r\ncapacity. Here I would like to particularly underline the\r\nongoing project by the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) and other international partners in\r\ndeveloping a long-term strategy and building\r\ninstitutional capability for disaster preparedness and\r\nmanagement in Mongolia.\r\nWith the support of the UNDP, the Government\r\nof Mongolia has taken important steps. We have moved\r\nfrom military to civilian control of disaster\r\nmanagement, with the adoption of a new Law on Civil\r\nProtection in June 2003, and the establishment of the\r\nNational Disaster Management Agency in January\r\n2004.\r\nThe natural disaster response capacity of\r\nMongolia is still in need of improvement. More\r\nimportantly, it is the people who must be prepared\r\nbecause the measure of our success will be the\r\nreduction of people’s dependence on handouts and\r\nappeals and their ability to create the livelihoods of\r\ntheir choice without fear of disaster.\r\nThe Government of Mongolia appreciates the\r\nJuly 2004 mission by the United Nations Disaster\r\nAssessment and Coordination Standby Team\r\n(UNDAC), which analysed disaster response in my\r\ncountry. The team’s recommendations, contained in the\r\nreport, are valuable and practical for improving\r\ndisaster response systems.\r\nWe have taken note of the UNDAC team’s\r\nprecaution that the natural disaster with the greatest\r\nimpact in Mongolia would be an earthquake in\r\nUlaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia, in which a\r\nconsiderable number of the entire population reside.\r\nThus, we are looking forward to cooperation with our\r\ninternational assistance partners in building urban and\r\nrescue capacity in Mongolia.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to\r\nexpress my country’s full support and further\r\ncooperation with the United Nations in discharging its\r\nlife-saving tasks in the humanitarian field. My\r\ndelegation believes that the World Conference on\r\nDisaster Reduction, to be held in January 2005, in\r\nKobe, Japan, will become a milestone in advancing our\r\ncommon interest in disaster reduction. The Mongolian\r\ndelegation is prepared to participate actively in that\r\nconference.\r\nMr. Kamanzi (Rwanda): Allow me to begin by\r\njoining other delegations in expressing my\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nGovernment’s condolences to the Palestinian Authority\r\nand the Palestinian people on the death of their leader,\r\nPresident Yasser Arafat.\r\nMy delegation would like to align itself with the\r\nstatement delivered on behalf of Member States of the\r\nAfrican Union by the representative of Nigeria, and the\r\nstatement delivered by the representative of Qatar on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe General Assembly is aware that the 1994\r\ngenocide in Rwanda completely decimated the social,\r\neconomic and political fabric of the country. Ten years,\r\nlater as a result of the noble and concerted efforts of\r\nthe Government of Rwanda and some members of the\r\ninternational community, progress has been achieved,\r\nin both economic and political terms. However, the\r\nmost vulnerable members of our society, the survivors\r\nof the genocide — particularly the orphans, widows\r\nand victims of sexual violence — continue to suffer\r\nfrom the effects of the genocide and live desperate\r\nlives characterized by poverty, disease and\r\nhopelessness.\r\nThe Rwandan Government has worked tirelessly\r\nto improve the conditions of life and health of the\r\ngenocide survivors. Since 1994, it has allocated 5 per\r\ncent of its annual expenditures to assisting groups of\r\ngenocide survivors. However, this Assembly is aware\r\nthat Rwanda has limited means, and while we\r\nrecognize and appreciate the support that the\r\ninternational community has given us in this area so\r\nfar, we would like to note that living conditions for the\r\ngenocide survivors remain desperate.\r\nOn behalf of the Government and people of\r\nRwanda, we would therefore like to call upon all\r\nMember States to support the draft resolution the\r\nAfrican Union intends to introduce under agenda item\r\n39 (a), entitled “Strengthening of the coordination of\r\nemergency humanitarian assistance of the United\r\nNations”.\r\nFinally, in view of the serious situation in which\r\nsurvivors of the genocide find themselves, my\r\nGovernment would like to appeal to members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to begin to consider how they can\r\nwork with United Nations agencies, funds and\r\nprogrammes to support the survivors of the 1994\r\ngenocide in Rwanda.\r\nMr. Zenna (Ethiopia): Sir, allow me to express\r\nmy deepest sorrow on the passing away of a great\r\nleader, President Yasser Arafat, and to express my\r\ncondolences to the people, the Government and the\r\nfamily of the late President.\r\nI wish to extend my sincere appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his revealing report, entitled\r\n“Strengthening the coordination of emergency\r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations”, as\r\ncontained in document A/59/93. I would like to share\r\nwith the Assembly our experience in humanitarian\r\nassistance in the area of coordination and transition\r\nfrom relief to development and partnership.\r\nIt is to be recalled that the frequently occurring\r\ndrought in Ethiopia made 13.2 million people\r\nvulnerable to an acute food crisis in 2003. However,\r\nthrough the coordinated and collaborative efforts of the\r\nGovernment of Ethiopia, the agencies, funds and\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations system, the donor\r\ncommunity, non-governmental organizations and other\r\nentities, the food crisis was effectively curtailed.\r\nTherefore, let me seize this opportunity to thank all our\r\npartners for their cooperation and partnership in\r\nhelping Ethiopia to avert the threatened food crisis of\r\n2003.\r\nIn spite of the enormous amount of activity that\r\nwas deployed to reverse the potentially devastating\r\n2003 situation, natural calamities continue to impede\r\nour efforts to mitigate the effects of drought.\r\nAccording to an assessment made by the United\r\nNations multi-agency team, some 10 per cent of the\r\npopulation, or about 8 million people, currently remain\r\nvulnerable and in need of emergency relief assistance.\r\nBased on that assessment, crop failure exists in\r\ndifferent parts of the country due to unfavourable rains\r\nduring the so-called “belg” season.\r\nSeveral areas are of special concern, including\r\nthe Somali region, East and West Hararghe, and the\r\nSouthern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region\r\n(SNNPR). Some of the zones in the SNNPR most\r\naffected by the serious drought of 2002-2003 are again\r\nunder serious threat. The season’s crop performance by\r\nthe SNNPR was the poorest, with an estimated yield\r\nloss ranging from 50 to 90 per cent. The physical status\r\nof livestock is reported at the moment to be generally\r\ngood, due to the availability of failed crops as livestock\r\nfeed resources, as well as occasional rain, but there is\r\nno certainty how long those conditions will last. In\r\ngeneral, the food security prospects are extremely poor,\r\nand, according to the assessment of the multi-agency\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nteam, around 500,000 metric tons of food aid is\r\nrequired.\r\nIn the area of non-food requirements, an effective\r\nway to conduct the assessment is required. In that\r\nregard, coordination needs to be strengthened with\r\nrespect to non-food needs assessment and needs\r\ndetermination, as well as on resource mobilization for\r\ncapacity-building. In order to have a better articulated\r\nmanagerial system for the assessment, implementation\r\nand monitoring of non-food assistance, coordination\r\nbetween the Government and other stakeholders,\r\nincluding United Nations agencies, needs to be\r\nenhanced.\r\nThe underlying causes of food insecurity and\r\nissues of recovery, assets protection and sustainable\r\ndevelopment of the affected areas in my country must\r\nbe addressed. In that connection, the Government has\r\ncontinued to exert maximum efforts to mitigate the\r\neffects of recurrent drought. From the launching of the\r\nPoverty Reduction Strategy Papers and prioritizing and\r\nimplementing the food security strategy to\r\nstrengthening the Early Warning System, the\r\nGovernment continues relentlessly in its efforts to\r\nmitigate the effects of drought. In that regard, my\r\nGovernment takes this opportunity to thank the\r\ninternational community for its prompt support to our\r\nlong-term solutions, in accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 58/24. Also, in this connection,\r\nwe commend members of the Group of Eight for their\r\nstatement of commitment at their recent annual\r\nmeeting to end famine in Ethiopia and the Horn of\r\nAfrica.\r\nFinally, in underscoring the importance of\r\npartnership, let me share with you what the Prime\r\nMinister of Ethiopia recently stated in relation to\r\nEthiopia’s Action Plan to meeting the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals as they apply to hunger:\r\n“We have agreed with our development\r\npartners that the farmers will need support to the\r\ntune of $500 million a year for five years if we\r\nare to achieve our objective of ensuring food\r\nsecurity within that time. There has also been an\r\nunderstanding that the Ethiopian Government\r\nshould cover 40 per cent of the cost from its own\r\nrevenue. We have in our most recent budget\r\nallocated slightly over $230 million, which is\r\nmore than 40 per cent of the required cost.\r\nLikewise, many of our development partners are\r\nbeginning to respond quickly and generously. As\r\nlong as we all do our share, I am confident that\r\nimplementation will be as good as the strategy we\r\nhave articulated and that, therefore, we will attain\r\nour objective of achieving food security within\r\nfive years.”\r\nEthiopia has presented a draft resolution under this\r\nitem, and we are counting on the support of all\r\nMember States.\r\nMr. Shacham (Israel): Israel understands that\r\ntoday is a day of profound sorrow for our Palestinian\r\nneighbours. Yet this day also presents an opportunity\r\nfor renewed momentum in a quest for peace between\r\nour two peoples. We hope that all parties will seize this\r\nopportunity to fashion a better future together.\r\nI will confine my comments today to agenda sub-\r\nitem 39 (c), “Assistance to the Palestinian people”.\r\nIsrael shares the belief of the international\r\ncommunity that all people, in the Middle East and\r\nelsewhere, should be able to live prosperous and full\r\nlives in security and peace, with standards of living\r\nbefitting universal human dignity. The Palestinian\r\npeople, of course, are no exception to that. On the\r\ncontrary, Israel is particularly interested in the\r\nconditions of all our neighbouring communities,\r\nespecially the Palestinians. Well-being within a nation\r\nhelps to foster harmony between nations. The\r\nPalestinian people are not our enemies; they are our\r\nneighbours, and we seek to live side by side with them\r\nin mutual respect and mutual dignity. Both Israelis and\r\nPalestinians deserve to live in security and in peace.\r\nThe suffering of both peoples is a humanitarian\r\nproblem, and the right of both peoples to self-\r\ndetermination must be respected.\r\nIn exceedingly difficult security conditions, Israel\r\ncontinues to do all that it can to help the Palestinian\r\npeople meet their humanitarian needs. That ranges\r\nfrom direct financial and humanitarian assistance to\r\nparticipation in multilateral endeavours alongside other\r\nmembers of the international community, and to the\r\nserious consideration given to humanitarian needs\r\nwithin the context of Israel’s security imperatives. Let\r\nus not forget, after all, that Israel does that while\r\nconfronting a brutal Palestinian terror campaign\r\nagainst its citizenry — a war that, in subverting any\r\nchances for peace, does immense harm to both the\r\nPalestinian and Israeli peoples, a battle against\r\nterrorists who have no respect for life or for law and\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nwhose violence endangers Palestinian lives just as it\r\ntargets Israeli ones.\r\nThis terror is of no assistance to the Palestinian\r\npeople. It is terror that causes hardship, not hardship\r\nthat causes terror. It is terror that is the enemy of peace\r\nand the enemy of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples\r\nalike. It is terrorism that makes humanitarian assistance\r\nand progress towards peace so difficult. It is the\r\nterrorists who hide among civilians and see any\r\nhumanitarian gesture as merely an opening for further\r\nattacks. That is the difficult reality in which\r\nhumanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people must\r\nbe examined. Israeli security measures are made\r\nnecessary by that reality, and the humanitarian\r\nsituation cannot be properly considered without an\r\nappreciation of the context and the causes that have\r\nbrought it about.\r\nThe report before us recognizes some of Israel’s\r\ncontributions and sacrifices, as well as some of the\r\ndifficulties it faces because of its constant need to\r\nbalance the humanitarian needs of the Palestinians with\r\nthe security needs of Israelis. As the report notes in\r\nparagraph 7, “The Palestinian Authority did not bring\r\nan end to violence and terrorism. It failed to reform its\r\nsecurity apparatus according to provisions of the road\r\nmap”. And because of that, the report states in\r\nparagraph 9, “Reprehensible terrorist attacks by\r\nPalestinian groups continue to visit carnage and fear on\r\nIsraelis”. The report also notes in paragraph 52 that\r\n“data showed a clear relationship between political or\r\nsecurity developments and the severity of access\r\nrestrictions”, because those restrictions are not\r\narbitrary but rather come out of a response to terrorism.\r\nAccordingly, as the report notes in paragraph 88,\r\n“Effective steps by the Palestinian Authority to lessen\r\nIsrael’s security concerns would facilitate” the effort to\r\nimprove the conditions of the Palestinian people.\r\nIsrael has done its utmost, together with the\r\ndonor community and international organizations, to\r\npromote assistance to the Palestinian population. Yet,\r\nas the report notes, as soon as new humanitarian\r\narrangements are put into effect, terror groups find a\r\nway to use them to their own advantage to carry out\r\nviolent attacks against Israelis. One example, discussed\r\nin the report, is the smuggling earlier this year of\r\nterrorists — who were hiding in a shipping\r\ncontainer — into an Israeli port, where they embarked\r\nupon a shooting rampage, killing and wounding several\r\nIsraeli civilians.\r\nUntil a Palestinian leadership emerges that is\r\nwilling and capable of acting to eliminate the terrorism\r\nthat constantly disrupts the hopes for peace in the\r\nregion, Israel will work to help the Palestinian people,\r\neven as it works to maintain the safety of its citizens.\r\nProblems remain and dilemmas are faced in the light of\r\nthe continuing terrorist threat, but Israel is committed\r\nto facilitating and assisting the improvement of the\r\nhumanitarian situation.\r\nWe are pleased to say that this year revenues have\r\nbeen transferred from Israel to the Palestinian\r\nAuthority on schedule each month, accounting for\r\nnearly $50 million monthly. Israel has developed a\r\nmuch more efficient working relationship with\r\nhumanitarian organizations on the ground, and new\r\noperating procedures have been instituted at\r\ncheckpoints and crossing points to speed the transfer of\r\nhumanitarian shipments, such as ambulances and the\r\nlike. In addition, special trucking terminals now\r\noperate between the West Bank and Israel to provide an\r\nongoing system of transport for produce and other\r\ngoods.\r\nSome 25,000 Palestinian workers and merchants\r\nenter Israeli daily from the West Bank and Gaza, with\r\nnearly 20,000 more working in Israeli communities\r\nwithin those territories and in the industrial parks\r\nadjacent to them. Trade with Israel accounts for more\r\nthan 80 per cent of the trade of the Palestinian\r\nAuthority. We feel, and act on, a responsibility towards\r\nour neighbours. In fact, despite the continuing\r\ncampaign of terrorism, trade between Israel and the\r\nPalestinian Authority increased by 16 per cent from\r\n2002 to 2003. In a further effort to ease the economic\r\nburden on the Palestinian people, and despite the\r\nsecurity challenges involved, Israel facilitates\r\ntransportation and crossings between Palestinian areas\r\nand neighbouring countries — for example, the Rafah\r\ncrossing to Egypt and the Damia and Allenby bridges\r\nto Jordan.\r\nPerhaps the most important initiative that Israel is\r\ntaking upon itself to alleviate the situation is the\r\ndisengagement plan. Prime Minister Sharon’s bold and\r\ncourageous plan — which was recently ratified by the\r\nKnesset, Israel’s parliament — involves the\r\ndismantling of civilian localities and military\r\ninstallations in Gaza and the northern West Bank by\r\nthe end of next year. It aims to stabilize the\r\nhumanitarian and security situation, providing Israelis\r\nwith greater security, providing Palestinians with\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\ngreater control over their lives and facilitating greater\r\nfreedom of movement for people and goods.\r\nAs the international community — including the\r\nQuartet — has recognized, the disengagement plan has\r\nthe potential to jump-start the peace process and to\r\nbring both sides back to the course projected by the\r\nroad map. We are hopeful that, by facilitating greater\r\nPalestinian self-determination and by urging the\r\nPalestinian leadership to live up to its own obligations\r\nand commitments, the peace process can regain its\r\nfooting. It can and must be hoped that that initiative,\r\ncombined with a return to the road map, will facilitate\r\na true form of assistance to both the Palestinian and\r\nIsraeli peoples.\r\nAs Prime Minister Sharon said in his statement\r\non the eve of the adoption by the Knesset of the\r\ndisengagement plan on 25 October:\r\n“I have repeatedly and publicly said that I support\r\nthe establishment of a Palestinian State alongside\r\nthe State of Israel. I have repeatedly and openly\r\nsaid that I am willing to make painful\r\ncompromises in order to put an end to this\r\nongoing and malignant conflict between those\r\nwho struggle over this land, and that I would do\r\nmy utmost in order to bring peace. …\r\n“We have no desire to permanently rule\r\nover millions of Palestinians … Israel, which\r\nwishes to be an exemplary democracy, will not be\r\nable to bear such a reality over time. The\r\ndisengagement plan presents the possibility of\r\nopening a gate to a different reality”.\r\nAll those measures, and the significant assistance\r\nof the international community, are important — but\r\nnone are a substitute for peace. Neither the Israeli nor\r\nthe Palestinian people will realize the prosperity, the\r\nsecurity and the dignity they deserve until there is an\r\nend to the brutal strategy of terrorism and a\r\ncommitment to resolve outstanding issues in a spirit of\r\nmutual recognition and mutual compromise. No peace\r\ncan come without a Palestinian leadership focused on\r\nthe creation of a viable, democratic, accountable and\r\npeaceful Palestinian State, rather than one focused on\r\nthe demise of the Israeli State.\r\nPart of the assistance provided to the Palestinian\r\npeople must, therefore, involve a concerted effort to\r\nbring an end, finally and irreversibly, to the morally\r\nbankrupt strategy of terrorism that has brought untold\r\nsuffering to both Israelis and Palestinians. It must\r\nencourage an approach that seeks to build Palestinian\r\ninstitutions committed to coexistence, not conflict.\r\nWith a reformed leadership that is ready to take\r\nresponsibility and is ready to treat victimhood as a\r\ncondition to be remedied, rather than a strategy to be\r\nfostered, the Palestinian people will find in Israel a\r\nwilling, responsible and committed negotiating partner\r\nfor peace, in accordance with the Road Map process.\r\nThis is the path to true peace, security and stability for\r\nboth peoples and one that we must all work towards.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In accordance\r\nwith General Assembly resolution 45/6 of 16 October\r\n1990, I now give the floor to the Observer of the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross.\r\nMr. Paclisanu (International Committee of the\r\nRed Cross): On behalf of the International Committee\r\nof the Red Cross (ICRC), allow me to thank you,\r\nMr. President, for giving me the floor at this fifty-ninth\r\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly.\r\nThe ICRC wishes to take this opportunity to\r\nbriefly share, at the outset, its views concerning\r\npresent-day conflict environments and the approaches\r\nwe have adopted, with the aim of rendering\r\nhumanitarian action both more effective and safer.\r\nToday’s conflict environment is mainly\r\ncharacterized by the number and complexity of non-\r\ninternational armed conflicts, sometimes with external\r\ninvolvement. In certain parts, there is an increasing\r\npolarization taking place. This renders the acceptance\r\nof independent and neutral humanitarian action\r\nextremely difficult, because it engenders the conviction\r\nthat all involved in such action are in fact taking sides.\r\nThis conviction is further reinforced when\r\nhumanitarian action is seen as being instrumentalized\r\nthrough its integration by State actors as an additional\r\ntool in the pursuit of their military strategy and\r\npolitical objectives. As a consequence, there is a risk\r\nthat humanitarian principles will be eroded, that\r\nhumanitarian action will be rejected and that the\r\nsecurity of humanitarian personnel will be seriously\r\ncompromised.\r\nThe ICRC, therefore, strongly believes that, in\r\norder for it to fulfil the mandate it has received from\r\nStates to protect and assist victims of armed conflict,\r\nthe neutrality and independence of humanitarian action\r\nmust be vigorously defended. Humanitarian work must\r\nbe independent, i.e. distinct from political decision-\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nmaking processes and perceived as such. It must be\r\nneutral in that humanitarian action and political-\r\nmilitary action should be kept clearly separate,\r\navoiding the blurring of lines produced by the\r\nintegration of humanitarian responses into an overall\r\nmilitary strategy. For these reasons, the ICRC cannot\r\nsubscribe to approaches that combine political, military\r\nand humanitarian tools in the midst of armed conflict\r\nor violence.\r\nIn this regard, the ICRC insists on respect for the\r\nidentity, mandate and operating principles of each\r\nseparate actor. The extent of its coordination on the\r\nground with other actors would thus depend on the\r\ndegree to which the perception of the ICRC as a\r\nneutral and independent organization can be preserved.\r\nIn our view, the ICRC’s choice to retain\r\nimpartiality, independence and neutrality as key\r\nprinciples of its identity and action forms a good basis\r\nfor coordination, which needs to rely on a clear\r\nrepartition of roles and responsibilities among various\r\nactors. This is an essential ingredient for realistic and\r\nmeaningful humanitarian coordination, which, in the\r\nface of the dimensions and complexity of humanitarian\r\nneeds, is necessary in order to render humanitarian\r\naction more effective. This is the ultimate and unique\r\ngoal of all coordination efforts.\r\nFor the ICRC, coordination involves regular\r\ndialogue and consultation aimed at publicizing\r\nprogrammes and activities and avoiding duplication, at\r\nexchanging views and experiences that help contribute\r\nto improving responses and enhancing security. The\r\nICRC considers that such complementarity among\r\nhumanitarian actors flows from their distinct mandates,\r\nexpertise and operating principles and methods. Within\r\nthe framework of this approach, the ICRC coordinates\r\nwith, but is not coordinated by, other humanitarian\r\nactors. This fact is vital for the ICRC, if it is to\r\npreserve its independence and neutrality, which\r\nunderlies its acceptance by all parties to an armed\r\nconflict and thereby enables it to fulfil its specific\r\nmandate.\r\nIt is in this perspective that the ICRC participates\r\nin United Nations multilateral coordination\r\nmechanisms and structures, both at Headquarters and\r\nin the field, such as the Inter-Agency Standing\r\nCommittee, of which it is a standing invitee, and the\r\nUnited Nations country teams. Through such regular\r\ndialogue and mutual consultation with other\r\nhumanitarian actors on thematic issues and operational\r\nquestions, the ICRC contributes to the common goal of\r\nmore effective humanitarian action. At the bilateral\r\nlevel, for example, the ICRC/Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees high-level\r\nmeetings have become a regular event. This year’s\r\nJune meeting saw discussions on humanitarian action\r\nand security in a changing conflict environment, as\r\nwell as on cooperation between the two organizations\r\non specific issues, such as resettlement of former\r\ncombatants. Again, in August, two new documents\r\nguiding the relationship between the ICRC and the\r\nWorld Food Programme entered into force. These will\r\nsignificantly facilitate exchanges of information,\r\nknowledge and material resources between the two\r\norganizations.\r\nFinally, the ICRC is convinced that it remains of\r\nvital importance to engage and maintain a transparent\r\ndialogue with all actors, while respecting the operating\r\nprinciples and distinct mandates of each, if\r\nhumanitarian coordination is to bear its full fruits.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In accordance\r\nwith General Assembly resolution 47/4 dated\r\n16 October 1992, I now give the floor to the Observer\r\nof the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\r\nMr. Dall’Oglio (International Organization for\r\nMigration): The International Organization for\r\nMigration (IOM) is pleased to contribute to these\r\ndeliberations today as one of the agencies participating\r\nin the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, which, since\r\nthe adoption of resolution 46/182, has become the\r\nprincipal mechanism for the coordination of operations\r\nrelated to humanitarian and relief disaster assistance.\r\nThe support, protection and stabilization of populations\r\nforced to leave their homes because of conflict or\r\nnatural disasters is an area in which IOM has, over the\r\nyears, come to specialize. It is active in a number of\r\nareas relevant to both emergency response and\r\ntransition phases.\r\nIOM fully shares the recommendations made in\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on strengthening\r\nthe coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance\r\nof the United Nations and would like to offer some\r\ncomments on two issues we consider of particular\r\nrelevance at this time.\r\nFirst, we would like to observe that considerable\r\nefforts have been made over the past few months to\r\nimprove the combined capacities of humanitarian\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nactors to provide a more timely, predictable and\r\ncoordinated response to crises of internal displacement,\r\nstarting with a more proactive field level response. In\r\naddressing crises associated with internally displaced\r\npersons, members of the Inter-Agency Standing\r\nCommittee (IASC) have opted for a collaborative\r\napproach in recognition that such an institutional\r\nframework currently represents the most appropriate\r\nmodality to mobilize the broad range of expertise\r\navailable in the system.\r\nUnder the leadership of the Emergency Relief\r\nCoordinator, the commitment of all involved agencies\r\nto pursue the collaborative approach has gained\r\nmomentum, and a number of tools to assist in its\r\nimplementation have recently been developed. Among\r\nthem, we would like to stress the relevance of the\r\nefforts to strengthen the Internal Displacement\r\nDivision of the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA), a more vigorous and\r\nproactive role for the Humanitarian Coordinator in\r\nproviding United Nations country teams with strategic\r\ncoordination of protection and assistance to internally\r\ndisplaced persons, and the shared definition of a\r\nprocedural road map for the assignment of tasks among\r\nIASC members.\r\nIn addition, the guidance note on durable\r\nsolutions for displaced persons — refugees, internally\r\ndisplaced persons and returnees — recently developed\r\nby the United Nations Development Group represents a\r\nvaluable measure to streamline population\r\ndisplacement issues into common country assessment\r\nand United Nations Development Assistance\r\nFramework (UNDAF) processes so as to facilitate\r\ntransitional programming.\r\nAll of the above are useful, important and timely\r\nmeasures. They must now produce the expected results.\r\nThe situation in Darfur is an example of the\r\ncomplex coordination required to address a crisis of\r\nenormous proportions. Under the leadership of the\r\nHumanitarian Coordinator, IOM has recently initiated\r\nthe development and implementation of the\r\nManagement and Coordination Mechanism on the\r\nVoluntary Return of Internally Displaced Persons in\r\nDarfur, which will provide for appropriate monitoring\r\nand reporting mechanisms to ensure that the return of\r\ninternally displaced persons remains safe, free and\r\nvoluntary. This activity is pursuant to the signature on\r\n21 August of a memorandum of understanding between\r\nthe Government of the Sudan, IOM and the United\r\nNations, which laid the basis for a commitment to the\r\nvoluntary returns of internally displaced persons.\r\nSecondly, for IOM, being part of the\r\nConsolidated Appeals Process — for which the global\r\nlaunch for 2005 took place just few hours ago — is\r\nanother key element of our IASC involvement. IOM is\r\nin fact participating in five of the 14 appeals that have\r\nbeen launched today. Indeed, we recognize the\r\nConsolidated Appeals Process as a strategic planning\r\nand programming process, not just a resource\r\nmobilization tool. In all honesty, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral indicated, it is of concern that the pattern of\r\nresponse does not necessarily reflect real improvement\r\nin the process and the end product, nor does it\r\nnecessarily reflect the most pressing needs.\r\nI would like to conclude these remarks by\r\nreaffirming the value IOM attaches to its participation\r\nin the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and our\r\nsupport for the on-going collaborative efforts,\r\nincluding those described above, taken by the\r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator to advance a shared\r\nenvironment for the attainment of key humanitarian\r\npolicies and goals. Finally, we take this opportunity to\r\nrenew to Under-Secretary-General Egeland and to his\r\nteam at OCHA, on behalf of IOM’s Director General,\r\nour sincere appreciation for their professionalism,\r\ndedication and inclusiveness in their collaboration with\r\nour organization.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): In accordance\r\nwith General Assembly resolution 49/2 of 19 October\r\n1994, I now call on the Observer of the International\r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\r\nMs. Powell (International Federation of Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): This agenda item\r\nand the debate in the General Assembly plenary is in\r\nmany respects the centrepiece of the presentations\r\nmade by the International Federation of Red Cross and\r\nRed Crescent Societies (IFRC) in the United Nations\r\neach year.\r\nPermit me to refer to my own country, Jamaica.\r\nWe have recently experienced a need for properly\r\ncoordinated humanitarian assistance. The Jamaica Red\r\nCross, of which I am the President Emeritus, was\r\nprofoundly involved in preparing for and responding to\r\nHurricane Ivan, which struck in September. Once the\r\nhurricane’s path was established, our staff and\r\nvolunteers took part, along with the relevant\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nGovernment agencies, in meetings convened by the\r\nNational Office of Disaster Preparedness. Community-\r\nbased teams were trained prior to the arrival of the\r\nhurricane. Once it struck, we identified the people in\r\nneed, managed the emergency shelters and prepared\r\ndetailed assessments of the damage and requirements,\r\nwhich enabled vulnerability to be properly addressed.\r\nThe experience of Grenada illustrates the impact\r\nof Hurricane Ivan on our region. At least two thirds of\r\nthe homes in Grenada were destroyed. The country’s\r\neconomy is traditionally based on tourism and cash\r\ncrops such as nutmeg. Given that a nutmeg tree takes\r\nseven years to bear its first fruit, the economic impact\r\nof this disaster is clear. Once again, we see how\r\nimportant it is to integrate disaster preparedness and\r\nrisk reduction into national development planning.\r\nThe debate this year takes place amidst rising\r\nconcern on the part of agencies, Member States, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and the communities\r\nthemselves about the ways in which humanitarian\r\nassistance programmes are conceived and delivered.\r\nOne of the main reasons for concern is that\r\nhumanitarian assistance today is very different from\r\nwhat it was in the past.\r\nMany important issues that the IFRC has advocated\r\nfor decades have only recently been prioritized by\r\nGovernments. It is fortunate that the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals have placed a clear emphasis on\r\nvulnerability and need. That is perhaps the most\r\nimportant new development in how the international\r\ncommunity considers humanitarian assistance.\r\nAs a regular participant in the work of the Inter-\r\nAgency Standing Committee (IASC), the IFRC has the\r\nadvantage of being in constant dialogue with United\r\nNations partners and others about the priorities and\r\ndirections of humanitarian assistance. Our role, as the\r\nco-chair of the IASC Inter-Agency Task Force on\r\nDisaster Reduction, has brought forth some points\r\nworthy of note today by Member States and by the\r\nwider international community.\r\nThere are currently two important initiatives that\r\nwhich deserve special attention. One is the process\r\nknown as good humanitarian donorship. It encourages\r\nthe strengthening, effectiveness, efficiency and\r\ntimeliness of humanitarian action, as well as the\r\nnecessity of long-term commitments. And here, we\r\nmust commend the Government of Canada for hosting\r\nthe October 2004 meeting in Ottawa.\r\nThe other initiative, recently launched by the\r\nUnited Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator seeks to\r\nreview the capacity of global humanitarian response.\r\nThis initiative originates from the concern that the\r\ninternational community is often unable to meet the\r\nbasic needs of populations affected by emergencies and\r\ncrises. We look forward to further discussion of this\r\nissue at the Inter-Agency Standing Committee\r\nPrincipals meeting in Geneva in December. We will\r\nbring forward the experiences of our members\r\nworldwide to this meeting. We strongly believe that\r\nresponse is not only the task of international actors, but\r\nit is most frequently provided at the national level and,\r\nvery often, by Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies at\r\nthe community level.\r\nCommunity resilience, which is the theme of the\r\nFederation’s 2004 World Disasters Report, should be\r\nintegrated into the way that humanitarian assistance is\r\nconceived and provided. In this context, we are paying\r\nclose attention to the forthcoming World Conference\r\non Disaster Reduction, to be held in Kobe in January\r\n2005. The International Federation of Red Cross and\r\nRed Crescent Societies (IFRC) has been invited to\r\nmoderate one of the high-level round tables, where we\r\nhope to stimulate discussion on challenges, needs and\r\nopportunities in disaster risk reduction initiatives\r\nworldwide. We have accepted this opportunity and are\r\nworking with the International Strategy for Disaster\r\nReduction and all the stakeholders to prepare for that\r\nimportant event. We sincerely hope that the Conference\r\nwill take account of the IFRC project on international\r\ndisaster response, laws, rules and principles, all of the\r\nconcerns of the International Decade for Natural\r\nDisaster Reduction.\r\nOur experience shows that coordinating\r\nhumanitarian assistance has become increasingly\r\nchallenging. This reflects not only the complexity of\r\nthe issue, but also the sharp growth in the number of\r\nstakeholders. This coordination is, of course, welcome.\r\nAccordingly, it is the reason why another of the\r\nimportant events of this year is so vital, namely the\r\nconsideration of the recommendations contained in the\r\nCardoso Report, which is the Report of the Panel of\r\nEminent Persons on United Nations and Civil Society\r\nRelations. We highlight the importance of this because\r\nour role as the auxiliary to Government and the bridge\r\nto civil society has given us many insights into the\r\nurgency of this need. Without community involvement,\r\ncoordinated solutions are unlikely.\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.52\r\nFinally, the challenge for all of us is not simply to\r\ncoordinate humanitarian assistance, but to make sure\r\nthat this assistance reaches people like those in\r\nGrenada, and reaches them quickly, effectively and\r\nlastingly.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): We have heard\r\nthe last speaker in the debate on agenda item 39 and its\r\nsub-items (a) and (c). I should like to inform Members\r\nthat, at the request of the sponsors, action on draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.24 will be taken at a later date. The\r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 39 and its sub-items (a)\r\nand (c).\r\nAgenda item 35 (continued)\r\nCulture of peace\r\nNotes by the Secretary-General (A/59/201 and\r\nA/59/223)\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.15/Rev.1)\r\nThe President (spoke in French): Members will\r\nrecall that the Assembly held a debate on agenda item\r\n35 at its 41st and 42nd plenary meetings on 26 and\r\n27 October 2004. In connection with this item, the\r\nAssembly now has before it draft resolution\r\nA/59/L.15/Rev.1.\r\nThe General Assembly will now take action on\r\ndraft resolution A/59/L.15/Rev.1 entitled “Promotion\r\nof interreligious dialogue”. Before we take action, I\r\nwould like to indicate that, since its preparation, the\r\nfollowing sponsors have been added to resolution\r\nA/59/L.15/Rev.1: Argentina, Bangladesh, Myanmar,\r\nPeru, Thailand and Uruguay.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\nresolution A/59/L.15/Rev.1.\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 59/23).\r\nMr. Gatan (Philippines): My delegation is\r\npleased to take this opportunity to thank the Assembly\r\nfor the adoption by consensus of the resolution on the\r\npromotion of interreligious dialogue. I would like in\r\nparticular to thank the 24 delegations that sponsored\r\nthe resolution coming from all continents of the world.\r\nMay I also thank the delegations that provided\r\nconstructive inputs and facts for the resolution, both in\r\nform and substance, particularly the observer\r\ndelegations of the Holy See, of the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference, the delegations of the European\r\nUnion, Argentina, Switzerland, Canada and others\r\nduring the consultations convened by the Philippines.\r\nThis resolution is a landmark in United Nations history,\r\nopening the door of the United Nations to partnership\r\nwith civil society in general and the religious sector in\r\nparticular. We look forward to a fruitful interaction\r\nwith faith-based organizations in the years ahead.\r\nMr. Smagulov (Kazakhstan): The General\r\nAssembly has just adopted a resolution that is very\r\nimportant in raising awareness in the international\r\ncommunity of the need to promote interreligious\r\ndialogue. The resolution recognizes the commitment of\r\nall religions to peace and stability in the world. We\r\nthank the delegation of the Philippines for its input in\r\nthe promotion of interreligious dialogue. This issue has\r\nbecome particularly vital in Kazakhstan, as in many\r\nother countries. We attach great importance to the\r\npromotion of religion, religious and cultural\r\nunderstanding, harmony and cooperation.\r\nWe also consider it important that the resolution\r\nrefers to the first Congress of Leaders of World and\r\nTraditional Religions held in Astana, the capital of\r\nKazakhstan, in September 2003. This international\r\nforum made a valuable contribution to the promotion\r\nof the culture of peace and dialogue among\r\ncivilizations.\r\nA second congress will be held in Kazakhstan in\r\nSeptember 2006 to further address pressing political\r\nand spiritual problems. We believe that that event will\r\nbe fully supported by States Members of the United\r\nNations and by regional and non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of\r\nagenda item 35.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I should like to\r\nremind members that, as of Monday, 15 November\r\n2004, the General Assembly and its Main Committees\r\nwill revert to their usual practice of holding meetings\r\nfrom 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.\r\nWe are almost at the end of Ramadan.
