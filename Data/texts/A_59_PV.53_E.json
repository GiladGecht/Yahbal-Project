(Gabon)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Chowdhury\r\n(Bangladesh), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda items 50 and 51\r\nReport of the International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and\r\nOther Serious Violations of International\r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of\r\nRwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for\r\nGenocide and Other Such Violations Committed in\r\nthe Territory of Neighbouring States between 1\r\nJanuary and 31 December 1994\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nninth annual report of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal (A/59/183)\r\nReport of the International Tribunal for the\r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Serious\r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia\r\nsince 1991\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\neleventh annual report of the International\r\nTribunal (A/59/215)\r\nThe Acting President: At the outset, let me wish\r\nall delegates, hearty Eid greetings on the occasion of\r\nthe holy festival of Eid Al-Fitr.\r\nThe General Assembly will now consider, in a\r\njoint debate, items 50 and 51 of its agenda.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of the\r\nninth annual report of the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for Rwanda?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the\r\nAssembly takes note of the eleventh annual report of\r\nthe International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Mr. Erik\r\nMøse, President of the International Criminal Tribunal\r\nfor Rwanda.\r\nMr. Møse: It is a great honour to address this\r\ndistinguished Assembly and to present the ninth annual\r\nreport of the International Criminal Tribunal for\r\nRwanda (ICTR). The period under review is from 1\r\nJuly 2003 to 30 June 2004, but this occasion also\r\nprovides an opportunity to assess the results so far of\r\nthe third mandate of the Tribunal from 2003 to 2007 in\r\nlight of the implementation of the Tribunals\r\ncompletion strategy.\r\nDuring the period under review, the ICTR\r\ndelivered five trial judgements involving nine accused.\r\nAnother judgement was delivered on 15 July 2004.\r\nThis brings the total number of judgements rendered by\r\nthe ICTR since the first trial started in January 1997 to\r\n17, involving 23 persons. The next judgement is\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\nexpected in a couple of months. Never before has the\r\njudicial output been so high.\r\nIn 2003, the Tribunal commenced four new trials\r\ninvolving a total of 10 accused. In 2004, we started\r\nthree new trials concerning six detainees.\r\nConsequently, 25 persons are currently on trial,\r\nincluding those accused whose trials commenced in the\r\nsecond mandate. At present, we therefore have a total\r\nof completed and ongoing cases involving 48 persons.\r\nThe ongoing trials involving the 25 accused may\r\nbe divided into two groups: multi-accused and single-\r\naccused cases. Five trials are multi-accused cases,\r\ncomprising a total of 22 persons. These trials are\r\nvoluminous and complex. They are by necessity time-\r\nconsuming, because the prosecution and the defence\r\nwill call a large number of witnesses. I am therefore\r\npleased to report that there has been considerable\r\nprogress in the Butare trial (six accused) and the\r\nMilitary I case (four accused). In both trials, the\r\nprosecution recently closed its case after having called\r\n59 and 82 witnesses, respectively. The defence teams\r\nwill commence their cases in January 2005. In the\r\nGovernment trial, the third multi-accused case\r\ninvolving four accused, there are only about 12\r\nremaining prosecution witnesses.\r\nThe progress in these three multi-accused trials is\r\na significant step towards the implementation of the\r\nICTR completion strategy. Our experience with multi-\r\naccused cases shows that the presentation of the\r\ndefence case usually requires less time than the\r\nprosecution case because of less extensive cross-\r\nexamination. The two remaining multi-accused cases\r\nare at a very early stage. The Military II trial\r\ncommenced on 20 September 2004 and has been\r\nslowed down by illness. The Karemera et al. trial,\r\nwhich started in November 2003, will commence de\r\nnovo, following a recent Appeals Chamber ruling to\r\nthis effect. These two trials will be given priority in\r\n2005.\r\nTurning now to single-accused cases, they are\r\nless complicated than multi-accused trials and require\r\nless time. The Tribunal has delivered judgements in\r\nthree single-accused trials since the presentation of our\r\nlast annual report. The Gacumbitsi trial started on\r\n28 July 2003, and judgement was delivered on 17 June\r\n2004 after 31 trial days. The Ndindabahizi case started\r\non 1 September 2003 with judgement on 15 July 2004\r\nafter 27 trial days. In the Muhimana trial, which\r\ncommenced on 29 March 2004, the parties closed their\r\nrespective cases after 34 trial days. Judgement is\r\nexpected in early 2005. These three recent trials\r\nconfirm the Tribunals capacity to complete single-\r\naccused cases in less than a year even when the judges\r\nsitting in these cases are also conducting multi-accused\r\ntrials. Let me add that last week the prosecution also\r\nclosed its case in the Simba trial, which started on\r\n30 August 2004.\r\nIn order to ensure maximum judicial output, it is\r\nimportant to find the right balance between the multi-\r\naccused and single-accused trials. The eight trials\r\ncurrently in progress are taking place in three\r\ncourtrooms only. This makes our task difficult and\r\nrequires careful long-term planning. Single-accused\r\ncases are normally slotted in when there are breaks in\r\nthe voluminous trials, so-called twin-tracking, or they\r\nare heard in morning or afternoon shifts simultaneously\r\nwith other trials. We are anxious to ensure the steady\r\nprogress of the multi-accused trials. Once they are\r\ncompleted, there will be only single-accused cases left.\r\nLet me stress that the workload of the Tribunals\r\nAppeals Chamber is also very significant. During the\r\nperiod under review, four appeals from judgements and\r\n33 interlocutory appeals were filed. In July 2004, the\r\nAppeals Chamber delivered judgement in the\r\nNiyitegeka case. Judgement in the Ntakirutimana case\r\nwill be rendered later this year.\r\nAs mentioned in our annual report, the\r\ncommencement of four new trials in 2003 was due to\r\nthe arrival of five ad litem judges that year. Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1512 (2003) increased their number\r\nto nine. The remaining four ad litem judges arrived in\r\nArusha in September 2004 and made it possible to start\r\ntwo new trials. These nine judges, selected on the basis\r\nof the criteria enumerated in the Statute of the\r\nTribunal, form an excellent team together with the nine\r\npermanent judges (including one new permanent judge\r\nfrom St. Kitts and Nevis and one from Sri Lanka), and\r\nthey have already made significant contributions to the\r\nTribunal. I would like to reiterate our appreciation to\r\nthe General Assembly for having elected a pool of 18\r\nad litem judges. We also look forward to drawing on\r\nthe remaining nine ad litem judges when the\r\nappointments of the ad litem judges presently in\r\nArusha come to an end.\r\nBased on the progress made during the last year, I\r\nam pleased to confirm that the ICTR is on schedule to\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\ncomplete all trials by 2008, as required by Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1503 (2003). In conformity with\r\nthat resolution, the ICTR Prosecutor will concentrate\r\non those individuals that are alleged to have been in\r\npositions of leadership and to bear the gravest\r\nresponsibility for the crimes committed. The latest\r\nversion of our completion strategy, dated 26 April\r\n2004, is contained in document S/2004/341, and I refer\r\ndelegations to that document for further information.\r\nOn 23 November 2004, the Prosecutor and I will meet\r\nin the Security Council and present our six-month\r\nassessment of the implementation of the completion\r\nstrategy, in accordance with Council resolution 1534\r\n(2004).\r\nEven though we are on schedule, there are dark\r\nclouds on the horizon. The ICTR can comply with the\r\ntime frames established in the Security Council\r\nresolution only if it is provided with sufficient\r\nresources. Unfortunately, certain Member States have\r\nfailed to pay their contributions to the two ad hoc\r\nTribunals. As a consequence, the Controller has frozen\r\nthe recruitment of new staff to the Tribunals. So far,\r\nthat has not had any significant effect on the ICTR\r\ncompletion strategy. We have been able to keep the\r\ntrials going, but the situation is becoming critical.\r\nMore than 80 staff members have left the Tribunal\r\nsince the freeze was imposed, and the number of\r\nvacancies is increasing every month. Many vacant\r\nposts are directly linked to the judicial production of\r\nthe ICTR.\r\nLet me provide some illustrations. As of today,\r\nthere are nine vacant posts for legal officers in the\r\nthree Chambers, the recruitment for which has been put\r\non hold as a consequence of the freeze. Those nine\r\nlegal officers would have worked under the direct\r\nsupervision of the judges. Several permanent and ad\r\nlitem judges have no associate legal officers. The\r\njudges are now sharing legal officers through ad hoc\r\narrangements. This situation cannot continue.\r\nThe Prosecutors office is also faced with serious\r\nproblems. In the Appeals section, 5 out of 11 legal\r\nposts are vacant. There are 16 vacancies in the Trial\r\nsection, greatly reducing the capacity of the nine trial\r\nteams. The Registrys ability to provide support to the\r\njudicial process is also affected. Furthermore, the lack\r\nof resources affects the defence teams.\r\nIt is a paradox that indispensable financial\r\ncontributions are not paid when the Tribunal is doing\r\nits utmost to complete its task. We cannot maintain the\r\nspeed if the brakes are on. A slowing down of the\r\njudicial process may also mean that Member States\r\nhave to pay their contributions for longer periods of\r\ntime. As stated in our annual report, the Tribunal\r\nstrongly recommends that it continue to receive\r\nsufficient resources to enable it to comply with the\r\ndeadlines set by the Security Council.\r\nThe Tribunal appreciates the cooperation of the\r\nRwandan authorities. Last year I reported that there\r\nhad been a steady flow of witnesses from Kigali to\r\nArusha. I am pleased to state that the situation remains\r\nthe same. On request, we are also receiving\r\ndocumentation from the judicial proceedings in\r\nRwanda in order to evaluate fully the credibility of our\r\nwitnesses. That is important to the integrity of the\r\nproceedings in Arusha. Let me stress that both\r\nparties  the prosecution and the defence  must\r\nreceive the necessary assistance to carry out their\r\ninvestigations in Rwanda.\r\nThere are 17 indicted persons who remain at large\r\nand who continue to evade justice. Some of them are\r\nalleged to have been the architects of the events in\r\nRwanda in 1994. The Tribunal calls on those States in\r\nwhich those accused are found to intensify their\r\ncooperation with the ICTR and to facilitate their arrest\r\nand transfer to Arusha. Member States should also\r\nremain receptive to discussions relating to the possible\r\ntransfer of cases of indictees and suspects at large to\r\ntheir respective jurisdictions for trial. Following a\r\nrequest for transfer by the Prosecutor, it will be for the\r\nTrial Chambers to decide whether a person shall be\r\ntransferred.\r\nLet me add that cooperation within the Tribunal\r\nis excellent. The President, the Prosecutor and the\r\nRegistrar meet regularly in the Coordination Council\r\nand are in frequent contact more generally. The ICTR\r\nstaff continues to be committed and hardworking.\r\nFinally, let me reiterate our appreciation to those\r\nsix Member States that have entered into agreements\r\nfor the enforcement of sentences handed down by the\r\nICTR. Let me also express our thanks to all Member\r\nStates for their cooperation, including arrests, transfers\r\nof indicted persons to Arusha and facilitating the travel\r\nof witnesses. The Tribunal also thanks the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his continued support.\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\nThe Acting President: I call on Mr. Theodor\r\nMeron, President of the International Criminal Tribunal\r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia.\r\nMr. Meron: I am deeply honoured to address the\r\nAssembly to present the eleventh annual report of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia (ICTY). At the outset, I wish to thank the\r\nMember States of the United Nations for the critical\r\nsupport they have long afforded the Tribunal. We are\r\nworking tirelessly to accomplish our important\r\nmission, and I am pleased to report that, despite\r\nsubstantial obstacles, we are making tremendous\r\nstrides.\r\nSince I last reported to the Assembly one year\r\nago, the Tribunal has continued the steady march of\r\nprogress in achieving its mission. The Trial Chambers\r\nand the Appeals Chamber have continued to hear and\r\ndispose of a record number of cases, and we have\r\nimplemented a number of reforms to increase the\r\nefficiency and the pace of our proceedings. Consistent\r\nwith the completion strategy endorsed by the Security\r\nCouncil, those initiatives, both internal and external,\r\nensure that the Tribunals energies and resources are\r\nconcentrated on senior leaders suspected of being most\r\nresponsible for crimes within the Tribunals\r\njurisdiction.\r\nEven though we are proud of the gains we have\r\nmade, we recognize that there is always room for\r\nimprovement. We are constantly seeking ways to\r\nincrease the efficiency of our proceedings and to\r\nreduce the costs of our operations, without sacrificing\r\nthe quality of our work.\r\nWe have redoubled our efforts to ensure that the\r\nStates of the former Yugoslavia do all they can to arrest\r\nindicted individuals who remain at large, and Serbia\r\nand Montenegros delivery to the Tribunal of Ljubisa\r\nBeara, who was indicted for atrocities at Srebrenica, is\r\nnoteworthy. As we strive to fulfil the Tribunals\r\nmission, however, we are growing deeply alarmed by\r\nthe current fiscal circumstances and the effect they are\r\nbeginning to have on our work, and by the fact that a\r\nnumber of important indictees remain at large.\r\nWith those concerns in mind, we eagerly invite\r\nthe cooperation of all Member States as we seek to\r\nbring to justice the perpetrators of the atrocities that\r\nscarred the Balkans in the 1990s and devastated\r\nhundreds of thousands of lives, and to contribute\r\nfurther to the reconciliation of the peoples of the\r\nformer Yugoslavia.\r\nFirst let me review for the Assembly some of the\r\nTribunals chief accomplishments during the past year.\r\nThe Tribunals activities have continued at a fast pace,\r\nhonouring the Tribunals commitment to the Security\r\nCouncil and to the General Assembly. The Tribunals\r\nTrial Chambers have continued to work at full capacity,\r\nholding morning and afternoon sessions, often running\r\nsix trials simultaneously. During the year in review, the\r\nChambers worked on 35 merits case and five cases of\r\ncontempt, all at various phases of the proceedings.\r\nThey rendered 11 judgements, some on the merits and\r\nothers concerning sentencing.\r\nCertainly the most high-profile trial has been that\r\nof Slobodan Milosevic, former head of State of the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia, which proceeded\r\nbefore Trial Chamber III. Following the departure from\r\nthe trial  and, sadly, the passing  of Presiding\r\nJudge May, we were able to continue the functioning of\r\nthe trial by applying, for the first time in the ICTY, rule\r\n15(bis), which we amended in 2002 and which allowed\r\nus to replace Judge May immediately with Judge\r\nBonomy. In February of this year, the prosecution\r\nrested its case, and the defence opened its case at the\r\nend of August.\r\nThe Appeals Chamber, during the year in review,\r\ndisposed of a record number of appeals. The Chamber\r\ncompleted 17 interlocutory appeals, four appeals from\r\njudgements on the merits, and one request for review.\r\nThe Appeals Chamber also altered its internal working\r\nprocedures to ensure that appeals continue to be treated\r\nas expeditiously and fairly as possible.\r\nOver the past year, we have adopted several\r\nimportant reforms to conserve the Tribunals resources\r\nfor the prosecution of senior officials. Internally, we\r\namended our rules to facilitate the implementation of\r\nthe completion strategy and to enforce the objectives of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1503 (2003) and 1534\r\n(2004). At a special plenary session in April, the\r\nJudges of the Tribunal amended rule 28(A) of the rules\r\nof procedure and evidence to require that a group of\r\njudges  namely, the President and Vice-President,\r\nalong with the Presiding Judges from each of the three\r\nTrial Chambers  verify that each new indictment\r\nfiled by the Prosecutor concentrates on one or more\r\nsenior leaders suspected of being most responsible for\r\ncrimes within the Tribunals jurisdiction. Indictments\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\nthat meet this seniority requirement proceed in the\r\nordinary manner; those that do not will be returned to\r\nthe Prosecutor.\r\nThe permanent Judges of the Tribunal also\r\nunanimously adopted an amendment to rule 11(bis), the\r\nrule governing the transfer of cases involving mid- and\r\nlower-level accused to national jurisdictions where the\r\naccused would receive a fair trial and would not be\r\nexposed to the death penalty. Prior to the amendment,\r\nthe rule permitted a case to be referred only to the\r\nnational jurisdiction in which the alleged crimes\r\noccurred or in which the accused was arrested. Now,\r\nhowever, we have expanded rule 11(bis) to allow the\r\ntransfer of cases to any national jurisdiction with the\r\nwill and the judicial capacity to afford the accused a\r\nfair trial  again, so long as the death penalty is not an\r\navailable punishment.\r\nThat amendment creates an additional mechanism\r\nfor the referral of cases out of the Tribunals\r\njurisdiction, thereby improving the Tribunals\r\nefficiency. By transferring lower- and intermediate-\r\nlevel defendants, we enhance the critical involvement\r\nof national Governments in bringing reconciliation and\r\njustice to the region. A trial chamber has been tasked\r\nwith considering requests from the Prosecutor for the\r\ntransfer of cases to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia\r\nand Montenegro, and Croatia. Its role is to verify that\r\nthe conditions stated by the Security Council and our\r\nrules of procedure and evidence have been met in\r\nterms of the defendants seniority and the availability\r\nof due process in the domestic courts, before the cases\r\ncan be transferred. One of these national jurisdictions,\r\nI am pleased to report, is very close to being ready to\r\naccept transfer cases of lower- and intermediate-level\r\nofficials.\r\nOfficials from the Tribunal have worked closely\r\nwith the Office of the High Representative to create the\r\nspecial chamber for war crimes prosecutions in the new\r\nState Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. An\r\nImplementation Task Force and nine working groups\r\nwere established, and those groups are nearing\r\ncompletion of their work in preparing the Sarajevo war\r\ncrimes chamber to receive transferred cases. The\r\nBosnian authorities expect that the chamber will be\r\noperational by January 2005, and the Tribunal is\r\nprepared to begin transferring cases as soon as\r\npracticable.\r\nAs the Balkan region moves toward stability,\r\nthese national courts should  and, I trust, will \r\nassume a major role in bringing offenders to justice,\r\nachieving reconciliation in the area, and promoting the\r\nrule of law. However, they can do so only if they are\r\nnot used for political purposes and if they meet\r\ninternational standards of due process and fair trial. To\r\nthat end, other members of the international\r\ncommunity have begun lending support to the fledgling\r\nSarajevo tribunal. At a diplomatic conference held in\r\nOctober 2003 at The Hague, Ambassador Fassier, the\r\nSenior Deputy High Representative for Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, joined me in explaining the function of\r\nthe chamber and the need for States to support the\r\nproject. As a result, supporters pledged more than 16\r\nmillion euros in contributions to defray start-up costs\r\nduring the chambers first two years. Additional\r\npledges were made to help fund years three through\r\nfive of the project. The delivery of such financial\r\nsupport is crucial to ensuring the successful operation\r\nof the new war crimes chamber.\r\nThe Tribunal is engaged in a number of initiatives\r\ndesigned to expedite the process of preparation for an\r\neventual transfer of cases from the ICTY to Croatia and\r\nSerbia and Montenegro. For example, the Tribunal\r\norganized an extensive programme for Croatian judges\r\nand prosecutors who are likely to take part in the trial\r\nof war crimes cases. During my first official visit to\r\nCroatia, in early November 2004, I was impressed by\r\nthe growing professionalism of the County Court in\r\nZagreb and of the Supreme Court of Croatia. The\r\nTribunal also hosted a week-long visit, organized by\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme, by seven\r\njudges of the newly established department for war\r\ncrimes in the Belgrade District Court. This court is\r\ndeveloping important war crimes trial capability.\r\nThe availability of national war crimes courts to\r\nwhich the Tribunal can transfer intermediate and\r\nlower-level cases will go a long way towards helping\r\nus fulfil the goals of the completion strategy. We have\r\nmade great progress towards that end during the last\r\nyear. The judges of the Tribunal held several plenary\r\nsessions in which, among other things, we adopted the\r\nrule amendments that I mentioned earlier. The plenary\r\nsessions in December 2003 and May of this year\r\nfocused heavily on the completion strategy, including\r\nongoing measures to enhance the efficient operation of\r\nthe Tribunal.\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\nIn addition to the rule changes to which I\r\nreferred, several other developments during the past\r\nyear have made the Tribunals operation smoother and\r\nimproved its efficiency. We have established a\r\nscheduling working group that forecasts the duration of\r\ntrials and judgement-drafting periods, to ensure that\r\ncourtroom space is used to its maximum capacity. This\r\nworking group, composed of members of the Registry,\r\nChambers and the Prosecutors office, has succeeded in\r\noverseeing the efficient progress of trials and use of the\r\nTribunals facilities.\r\nFinally, we have extended the powers of ad litem\r\njudges to perform pre-trial functions in a greater\r\nnumber of cases, thereby making full use of the ad\r\nlitem judges service and aiding trial readiness. In\r\nrelation to the ad litem judges, however, I would\r\nunderscore, as I noted in my letter to the United\r\nNations Legal Counsel, that it is of critical importance\r\nthat the elections of ad litem judges be held as early as\r\npossible in 2005. Early elections will enable the\r\nTribunal to achieve the most timely and efficient\r\norganization of trials possible.\r\nI would also note that we continue our efforts to\r\nwork with the Governments of the States of the former\r\nYugoslavia. Cooperation with Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nis good, but cooperation with Republika Srpska\r\nremains insufficient. This is especially the case with\r\nrespect to fugitives who remain at large and access to\r\nwartime documentation. Moreover, except for the case\r\nof Ljubia Beara, indicted for his alleged role in the\r\nwar crimes in Srebrenica, there has still been virtually\r\nno cooperation by Serbia and Montenegro with respect\r\nto the arrest of fugitives, access to evidence and the\r\ngranting of waivers of immunity to enable witnesses to\r\nprovide statements or testify before the Tribunal. While\r\nthe Croatian authorities cooperation has improved\r\nconsiderably, we expect them to exert their utmost\r\nefforts until Gotovina is in The Hague.\r\nI hope it is clear by now that the Tribunal has\r\nmade every possible effort to stay on track with the\r\ncompletion strategy during the last year. I must report,\r\nhowever, that financial difficulties are beginning to\r\nthreaten our capacity to run on all cylinders. Although\r\nsome Member States have fulfilled their financial\r\ncommitments to the Tribunal for 2004  including\r\nmost recently the Russian Federation, to whom I wish\r\nto express my special appreciation, and all the other\r\npermanent members of the Security Council  far too\r\nmany other States have not met their obligation to\r\nsupport the Tribunals mission, and their payments\r\nhave fallen into arrears.\r\nAt this time, outstanding contributions for 2004\r\nand previous years amount to an unacceptably high\r\npercentage of the Tribunals yearly budget. As a result,\r\nthe Secretary-General determined in May to keep all\r\nexpenditures at a minimum and imposed a recruitment\r\nfreeze on all posts and a severe reduction in all other\r\nexpenditures.\r\nThe freeze is beginning to have a devastating\r\neffect on the Tribunal. Since it was implemented in\r\nMay, well over 100 staff members have left the\r\nTribunal, which represents more than 10 per cent of\r\nour numbers. This loss of staff jeopardizes our efforts\r\nto execute the completion strategy. More to the point,\r\nthe hiring freeze leaves us unable not only to hire new\r\nstaff members, but even to replace those who leave.\r\nAlso, the perceived lack of support from the\r\ninternational community cannot help but influence staff\r\nmorale and motivation.\r\nWe are striving hard to do more with less, but we\r\ncan redistribute workloads for only so long. Inevitably,\r\nthe hiring freeze will cripple our ability to operate\r\nefficiently and to fulfil the goals of the completion\r\nstrategy. As an institution with only a limited mandate\r\nand of impermanent duration, we already face\r\ndifficulties in recruiting and retaining talented staff\r\nmembers, who are attracted, naturally, to more\r\npermanent employment with greater opportunities for\r\nadvancement at other institutions. This intrinsic\r\ndisadvantage, coupled with the hiring freeze, poses a\r\nserious threat to our completion goals.\r\nDespite these financial troubles, we are doing all\r\nthat we possibly can to stay on track with the\r\ncompletion strategy. However, I repeat my previous\r\ncall and that of my predecessors for each and every\r\nMember State to do its full part to assist the work of\r\nthe Tribunal. Twenty fugitives remain at large and must\r\nbe arrested. This number includes Radovan Karadzić,\r\nRatko Mladić and Ante Gotovina. In this regard, I urge\r\nthe General Assembly to be mindful of the risks posed\r\nto international justice in seeming to allow fugitives\r\nthe false hope that they can outrun and outlast the\r\nTribunal. With the end of the Tribunals lifecycle in\r\nsight, we must together guard against compromising\r\nthe legacy of justice and reconciliation in the former\r\nYugoslavia. As I have often said, the Tribunals\r\nhistoric mission will not have been achieved as long as\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\nsenior-level accused have not been brought to justice at\r\nThe Hague.\r\nThe Tribunal is now more than 10 years old.\r\nWhen its creators established it in 1993 as the first\r\ninternational war crimes chamber since Nuremberg,\r\nthey hoped it would do more than simply mete out\r\njustice to individual wrongdoers. They hoped that it\r\nwould also help create an impartial record of atrocities\r\ncommitted during the Yugoslav conflicts and offer\r\nvictims a sense of accountability and dignity. And they\r\nhoped that in so doing it would contribute to\r\nreconciliation and reconstruction in the republics of the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. I am proud to say that the Tribunal,\r\nwith the General Assemblys support, is tirelessly\r\nstriving to fulfil those hopes.\r\nIt would exceed the capacity of any single court\r\nto bring more than a partial reckoning to the vast scale\r\nof the crimes that marred the Balkans in the 1990s \r\nthe murders, rapes and deportations, the acts of torture,\r\ndestruction and cruelty.\r\nIf it was with slowness at first, the Tribunal has\r\nhelped to bring to account a considerable number of\r\naccused of high rank, and it is doing so with\r\nconfidence and efficiency. By throwing into stark relief\r\nthe consequences of ethnic and religious hatred, the\r\ntrials held by the Tribunal have demonstrated the\r\nviciousness of those who built their power by\r\nencouraging their followers to embrace such hatred.\r\nThe Tribunal has thus made a fundamental and\r\nlasting contribution to bringing justice to the peoples\r\nof the former Yugoslavia. In addition, the Tribunals\r\nvery existence has served an educational function far\r\nbeyond the borders of the Balkan region. Due in no\r\nsmall part to the Tribunal, and the wisdom of the\r\nUnited Nations in creating it, international\r\nhumanitarian and human rights law today hold greater\r\ncurrency and are better understood throughout the\r\nworld than they were a decade ago.\r\nThe types of cases on the Tribunals docket are\r\nnecessarily large and complex and our proceedings are\r\nnecessarily lengthy and costly. Often the crimes\r\ncharged were connected to entire military campaigns\r\nand occurred over the course of months or years across\r\nmany locations and involved several defendants.\r\nWith many counts of indictments, tens or\r\nhundreds of witnesses, thousands of pages of\r\ndocuments  most of which must be translated from\r\nSerbo-Croatian into English and French, the Tribunals\r\nworking languages  the trials are extremely complex.\r\nIn the plenary session scheduled for 6 December, the\r\njudges will consider additional important proposals for\r\nfurther expediting trials and appeals.\r\nIt is difficult to put a price tag on international\r\njustice. At the very least, justice for the former\r\nYugoslavia cannot be cheap. Due process must be fully\r\nrespected, and it is critical to bear in mind all that is\r\ngained through the Tribunals work.\r\nAfter some 10 years the Tribunal has established\r\nan impressive and unprecedented body of\r\njurisprudence on both substantive international\r\nhumanitarian and criminal law and, equally important,\r\non criminal procedure and evidence. The Nuremberg\r\nTribunal left us with important judgements on war\r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity, but it had far less\r\nto say on international procedural and evidentiary law.\r\nOur judgements on both procedural and\r\nsubstantive law now supply a foundation for all\r\ninternational criminal courts, and our success serves as\r\na model for national prosecutions of those who commit\r\nwartime atrocities. Our leading decisions on\r\ninternational humanitarian law will provide essential\r\nguidance for the tribunals in the former Yugoslavia,\r\nand our staff members are sharing and will continue to\r\nimpart their valuable experience in training the staff of\r\nthese nascent courts.\r\nOur jurisprudence will likewise contribute to the\r\nsuccess of other courts designed to enforce\r\ninternational humanitarian law, including various\r\nnational courts as well as the Special Court for Sierra\r\nLeone and the International Criminal Court, both of\r\nwhich have used our Tribunal as a model.\r\nIn establishing this Tribunal, the international\r\ncommunity pledged to bring to justice persons\r\nsuspected of having inflicted terrible atrocities on their\r\nfellow human beings. It pledged to eliminate impunity,\r\nnot through vengeance but through the rule of law and\r\nby upholding the basic principles of human rights and\r\ndue process. With the full support of all Member\r\nStates, we look forward to continuing that important\r\nwork and to providing a jurisprudential example for\r\ncriminal tribunals still to come.\r\nMr. Hamburger (Netherlands): I have the\r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union, the\r\ncandidate countries Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\nCroatia, and the European Free Trade Association\r\ncountries Iceland and Liechtenstein, members of the\r\nEuropean Economic Area, align themselves with this\r\nstatement.\r\nFirst of all I would like to thank Judge Møse,\r\nPresident of the International Criminal Tribunal for\r\nRwanda (ICTR) and Judge Meron, President of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia (ICTY), for their briefings earlier this\r\nmorning.\r\nThe European Union believes strongly in the\r\nprinciple of no impunity for the most serious crimes of\r\nconcern to the international community as a whole.\r\nBoth the ICTY and the ICTR were created to hold\r\nindividuals accountable for such crimes. Peace, justice\r\nand the rule of law are inextricably linked, and both\r\nTribunals have made valuable contributions towards\r\nreconciliation and the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity in the countries that they have served.\r\nThe European Union would therefore like to\r\nreaffirm its full support for the ICTY and the ICTR,\r\nand it commends their entire staff in their efforts to\r\nbring justice to victims of the most heinous crimes.\r\nThe European Union wishes to express its\r\nappreciation for the eleventh annual report of the ICTY\r\nand the ninth annual report of the ICTR. The EU\r\nwelcomes the developments and improvements\r\nachieved during the past year. In the period under\r\nreview, the ICTR delivered five trial judgements\r\ninvolving nine accused. Thus by the end of 2004 a total\r\nof 25 persons will be on trial, bringing the total number\r\nof accused whose trials have been completed or are in\r\nprocess to 48.\r\nFurthermore, the European Union notes that the\r\nthree Trial Chambers of the ICTY examined six trials\r\non the merits and two cases of contempt and rendered\r\ntwo judgements on the merits and nine sentencing\r\njudgements arising from nine guilty pleas. In addition,\r\nthe EU notes that the Appeals Chamber disposed of a\r\nrecord number of appeals.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the commitment\r\nof the presidents of both Tribunals to the completion\r\nstrategy, as well as to the reforms of the structure and\r\noperation of the Tribunals during the reporting period.\r\nThe Tribunals should indeed make every effort to\r\nrespect the deadlines as stipulated by Security Council\r\nresolutions 1503 (2003) and 1534 (2004). In that\r\nrespect the European Union notes that the international\r\ncommunity also has a commitment. Sufficient\r\nresources, cooperation, assistance and the support of\r\nMember States are essential to the work of the\r\nTribunals.\r\nIt is crucial that States cooperate with regard to\r\nrequests for access to archives and documents, securing\r\nthe appearance in court of prosecution witnesses and\r\nthe arrest and transfer of indictees still at large. We\r\nreiterate in particular the need to intensify efforts to\r\narrest and transfer Radovan Karadzić, Ratko Mladić\r\nand Ante Gotovina to the ICTY and Felicien Kabuga to\r\nthe ICTR for trial.\r\nIn particular, the European Union would like to\r\nreaffirm that cooperation by Rwanda and by the\r\ncountries of the western Balkans with the Tribunals\r\nremains essential. Furthermore, the EU is concerned\r\nabout the impact which the non-payment of\r\nassessments by Member States has on the work of the\r\nTribunals. It might seriously endanger their ability to\r\nfulfil their mandate within the framework of the\r\ncompletion strategy.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the efforts made\r\nby both Tribunals to transfer cases to domestic\r\njurisdictions and the activities in the area of national\r\ncapacity-building. The EU would like to restate its\r\nappeal to the Tribunals to ensure that the necessary\r\nstandards of fair trial, independence and full respect for\r\nhuman rights are respected within trials in national\r\ncourts.\r\nFinally, I would like to reassure the Tribunals of\r\nthe full support of the European Union and to thank all\r\nthe members of the Tribunals and their Chambers,\r\nAppeals Chambers and Registries, as well as the\r\nOffices of the Prosecutors, for their contribution to\r\npeace, justice and the rule of law.\r\nMr. Drobnjak (Croatia): Croatia has aligned\r\nitself with the statement of the European Union on this\r\nsignificant agenda item. In addition, I would like to\r\nemphasize in brief several points of particular\r\nimportance for my country.\r\nCroatia highly commends the report of the\r\nPresident of the International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia (ICTY) and is pleased with the fact\r\nthat it takes accurate note of the continuous and\r\ncomprehensive efforts that Croatia has invested in\r\nensuring full cooperation with the Tribunal. I would\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\nlike to take this opportunity to thank President Meron\r\nfor his words of praise for Croatia in this regard.\r\nThe successful implementation of the completion\r\nstrategy remains at the forefront of Croatias approach\r\nto the Tribunal. The fulfilment of this strategy in\r\naccordance with the 2004, 2008 and 2010 benchmarks,\r\nas outlined in Security Council resolutions 1503 (2003)\r\nand 1534 (2004), must remain our priority. Croatia\r\nstands ready to contribute to that goal to the best of its\r\nabilities.\r\nRespecting the benchmarks is not just a question\r\nof the effective administration of justice. Just as\r\nimportant, it adds to the confidence-building and\r\nstabilization processes in the region. We are already\r\napproaching the first of the three completion strategy\r\nbenchmarks  the completion of all investigations by\r\nthe end of 2004. With the investigative process done, it\r\nshould be easier to focus on the remaining tasks and\r\nshift necessary resources, on both the technical and the\r\npolitical sides of the spectrum, in that direction.\r\nThe referral of cases to competent national\r\njurisdictions for trial remains one of the pillars of the\r\ncompletion strategy. Croatian judges and prosecutors\r\nare ready for that serious task. In several cases they\r\nhave already demonstrated their high professional\r\nstandards in that demanding and enormously sensitive\r\ndomain. I would like once again to express our\r\ngratitude to the Tribunal and its experts for the\r\nvaluable technical and counselling assistance provided\r\nto Croatias judiciary, thus helping it to enhance its\r\ncapacity to prosecute war-crime cases in a professional\r\nand non-biased manner.\r\nThe area of the former Yugoslavia is turning into\r\na zone of peace and stability. As I speak, the Croatian\r\nPrime Minister, Mr. Ivo Sanader, is making an official\r\nvisit to Serbia and Montenegro, strengthening good\r\nneighbourliness, confidence-building and cooperation\r\nbetween Zagreb and Belgrade. The past is not\r\nforgotten  nor should it be. But it is the future that\r\nguides and inspires us. It is against the background of\r\nnew regional stability that we must evaluate the work\r\nof the ICTY and the imperative to complete its\r\nremaining tasks efficiently and on time.\r\nCroatia has already stated from this rostrum that\r\ncertain interpretations by the Prosecutor regarding the\r\nhistorical background and political genesis of the\r\nconflict in the former Yugoslavia, as well as the\r\ncharacter of the consequent military operations,\r\nappeared not to be fully in line with the General\r\nAssembly resolution on the occupied territories of\r\nCroatia or with the spirit of several important Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. However, that will in no way\r\nimpede Croatias readiness to cooperate fully with the\r\nICTY. After all, the Tribunal remains the place where\r\nthe innocence or guilt of any and every indicted person\r\nmust be determined. It has been wisely said that justice\r\nis truth on the march. We are confident that both justice\r\nand truth will be served well.\r\nAs an early advocate of the Tribunal and its\r\ngoals, Croatia has established a long and largely\r\nsuccessful record of cooperation with the ICTY. Being\r\na candidate country for membership in the European\r\nUnion, Croatia is perfectly aware of the importance of\r\ncooperation with the ICTY. Croatia will therefore\r\ncontinue to fulfil all of its related obligations and will\r\ntake, within its own borders, all measures required for\r\nprosecuting the perpetrators of war crimes.\r\nMr. Rahman (Malaysia): I should like to thank\r\nThe Honourable Judge Erik Møse, President of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), and The\r\nHonourable Judge Theodor Meron, President of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\r\n(ICTY), for introducing the reports of the two\r\nTribunals and for their excellent leadership of the\r\nTribunals during the respective reporting periods. The\r\nreports provide a comprehensive review of the progress\r\nof the work of the Tribunals, as well as of the\r\ndifficulties encountered by them. We commend both\r\nPresidents, as well as the members of the Chambers,\r\nProsecutors and the Registries of both Tribunals for the\r\nprogress achieved so far.\r\nMalaysia continues to believe strongly in the\r\nimportance of upholding the principles of justice and\r\nequality, which international humanitarian law stands\r\nfor. We regard adherence to the rule of law as a\r\nnecessary basis for upholding those principles. The\r\nTribunals were established, among other reasons, to\r\nbring to justice persons allegedly responsible for\r\nviolations of international humanitarian law and to\r\ncontribute to the restoration of peace by promoting\r\nreconciliation in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda.\r\nSince their creation, the Tribunals have played a\r\nsignificant role in clearly demonstrating that genocide\r\nand other serious violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law cannot be tolerated. The Tribunals\r\nexist in order to ensure that the perpetrators of\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\ngenocide and other serious violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law will not get away with impunity.\r\nThe work of the Tribunals is of immense\r\nimportance in bringing to justice the perpetrators of\r\natrocities and in the development of international\r\njustice and international law. There is no doubt that the\r\ndecisions of the Tribunals have contributed to the\r\nprogressive and constructive development of case law\r\nin the spheres of general international law and\r\ninternational humanitarian law in respect of different\r\nquestions of procedure and competence, as well as in\r\nsubstantive issues of considerable importance. The\r\nTribunals have led to pioneering advocacy for victim-\r\noriented restitutive justice in international criminal law.\r\nMalaysia is pleased to note that the both the\r\nICTY and ICTR have focused considerable efforts on\r\nthe implementation of their completion strategies, as\r\nset out in Security Council resolutions 1503 (2003) and\r\n1534 (2004). The completion strategies call on the\r\nICTY and the ICTR to take all possible measures to\r\ncomplete investigations by the end of 2004, to\r\ncomplete all trial activities at first instance by the end\r\nof 2008 and to complete all work by 2010. We take\r\nnote of the substantial structural changes that have\r\nbeen made in order to facilitate that process.\r\nI would first like to comment on the activities of\r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.\r\nMalaysia is pleased to note from the report that the\r\nICTR has undertaken further measures to improve its\r\nperformance in expediting proceedings in the interest\r\nof completing its mandate. These improvements have\r\nenabled the Tribunal to accelerate its work towards\r\ncompleting all trials by 2008. One of the biggest\r\nstructural reforms of the ICTR has been the\r\nappointment of its own Prosecutor, following, perhaps,\r\na belated acknowledgement by the Security Council\r\nthat it would not be possible for one person to hold the\r\nposition of Prosecutor for two Tribunals. We commend\r\nthe work of the Prosecutor, Mr. Hassan Jallow, who\r\ntook office in September 2003, and note his efforts in\r\ntaking steps to ensure the implementation of the\r\ncompletion strategy through the Completion Strategy\r\nMonitoring Committee. With the establishment of the\r\nAppeals section, the work of the Court has been further\r\naccelerated.\r\nThe enlargement of the pool of ad litem judges\r\nfor the Tribunal from four to nine would allow the\r\nTribunal to increase its judicial productivity and meet\r\nthe demands imposed by the rise in cases. The Tribunal\r\nmust be in a position to undertake its tasks efficiently,\r\nso that detainees are spared undue delay in the\r\ncompletion of their trials. With the appointment of\r\nthese ad litem judges, the ICTR should be able to meet\r\nits target of completing all trials by 2008. My\r\ndelegation is pleased that a Malaysian judge has been\r\nappointed and is able to contribute to the process\r\nthrough his service as an ad litem judge.\r\nI would now like to turn to the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. My\r\ndelegation notes with appreciation that the Tribunal has\r\nundergone structural and operational reform during the\r\nreporting period. The most significant internal reform\r\nwas the amendments of rule 28 and 11 bis of the Rules\r\nof Procedure and Evidence to enable the Tribunal to\r\ndetermine the seniority criterion in the review and\r\nconfirmation of new indictments and the expansion of\r\nthe national jurisdiction, so that cases involving\r\nintermediate and lower-level accused can be\r\ntransferred to national jurisdiction.\r\nMalaysia notes that one of the durable legacies of\r\nthe ICTY will be the strengthened criminal justice\r\nsystem in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The establishment\r\nof a special chamber for war crimes prosecutions is\r\ncrucial to enable the ICTY to complete its work by\r\n2008. The establishment of this War Crimes Chamber\r\nis part of the wider ongoing judicial reform in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina. We are pleased to note that the\r\nestablishment of the task force by the Tribunal has\r\nhelped accelerate the establishment of this Chamber,\r\nwhich is expected to be fully operational in 2005\r\nfollowing the amendments in the Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina Parliament.\r\nWe also note that, while the ICTY has made\r\nevery effort to be more efficient and expedite matters\r\nmore quickly, one of the biggest challenges is the\r\nreluctance of some States in the region to offer full\r\ncooperation, in particular their refusal to turn suspects\r\nover to the Tribunal. As indicated in the report, there\r\nhas been no major progress in the arrest and transfer of\r\nindictees, except in Croatia. We are concerned that the\r\nlack of cooperation could prevent the Tribunal from\r\nmeeting its 2008 deadline. The countries concerned\r\nmust meet, without hesitation, the call for cooperation\r\nby the Prosecutor.\r\nThe work of the ICTY and the ICTR has greatly\r\ncontributed to the field of post-conflict justice  not\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\nonly in furthering international criminal jurisprudence\r\non matters such as individual responsibility, the ability\r\nto exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed in\r\ninternational conflicts, but also in terms of procedural\r\nrefinements. In reiterating its fullest support for both\r\nthe Tribunals, Malaysia calls, once again, on the\r\ninternational community to give full and sustained\r\nsupport to the Tribunals in carrying their mandate and\r\nobjectives. The sustained commitment by major\r\nPowers is also crucial. The delivery of justice is\r\nimportant for a sustainable peace-building process.\r\nWithout justice there will be no peace.\r\nMr. Ozawa (Japan): At the outset, I would like to\r\nthank both President Theodor Meron and President\r\nErik Møse for presenting their annual reports to the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Japan appreciates their efforts to\r\nimplement the completion strategies for both Tribunals,\r\nand hopes that they will strengthen those efforts. The\r\nfact that we have now received the eleventh annual\r\nreport of the ICTY and the ninth annual report of the\r\nICTR indicates very clearly that many years have\r\npassed since the establishment of the two Tribunals. A\r\nprolonged judicial process does not necessarily\r\ncontribute to better justice, and this is why, we believe,\r\nthe Security Council endorsed the completion\r\nstrategies. The Presidents of both Tribunals should do\r\ntheir utmost to ensure that this goal is met, and to\r\ncomplete the first phase of the completion strategy, the\r\ninvestigation work, by the end of this year.\r\nAllow me to make a few comments on the work\r\nof the ICTY. First of all, I would like to express my\r\nsincere condolences on the passing of Judge Richard\r\nMay this past July. We commend his contribution to\r\nthe work of the Tribunal, and in particular his able\r\nleadership in his capacity as Presiding Judge of the\r\nMilosevć trial.\r\nRegarding the speed of the work of the ICTY\r\nChambers, we acknowledge the fact that the Tribunals\r\nthree Trial Chambers ran six trials simultaneously\r\nthroughout the year covered by the report. We hope the\r\nTrial Chambers will continue its work in this manner in\r\norder to maintain and further enhance the efficiency of\r\nthe Court.\r\nNeedless to say, the continuity of the work of the\r\nICTY is very important. In this regard, we hope that\r\nthe permanent judges to be elected in the elections on\r\nThursday, 18 November, in the General Assembly will\r\nheed the importance of this continuity and promote the\r\ncompletion strategies by making plans regarding the\r\nschedule of the trials well in advance of the\r\ncommencement of their terms on 17 November 2005.\r\nIn a similar light, we also hope that the terms of the ad\r\nlitem judges will be examined with the aim of\r\nmaintaining the continuity of the work of the ICTY.\r\nThe ICTY was established to bring to justice\r\nthose responsible for serious violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law committed in the territory of the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. As such, Japan fully shares the\r\nconcern expressed by the Prosecutor that Radovan\r\nKaradzić, Ratko Mladić and Ante Gotovina are yet to\r\nbe arrested. It is therefore essential that the countries\r\nconcerned cooperate and provide support, not only in\r\nthe process of arresting those fugitives but also by\r\nproviding other necessary means for obtaining access\r\nto witnesses, archives and other crucial evidence. Such\r\ncooperation is required in order to avoid any waste of\r\ntime in fulfilling the mandate of the ICTY.\r\nNext, let me turn to the work of the ICTR. First,\r\nwe have been impressed by the fact that the\r\nNdindabahizi trial, which began on 1 September 2003,\r\nwas completed in less than one year, with judgement\r\nbeing rendered on 15 July 2004. We were likewise\r\npleased to note that in the Muhimana trial, which\r\ncommenced on 29 March 2004, 19 prosecution\r\nwitnesses were heard in a period of 20 trial days. These\r\nresults confirm that the efficiency of the trials has been\r\nenhanced.\r\nSecondly, my Government welcomes the\r\ncommencement of work by Mr. Jallow, the Prosecutor\r\nof the ICTR, whose position was established by\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1503 (2003). We commend\r\nthe fact that Mr. Jallow has communicated with the\r\nRwanda Government on a regular basis and is\r\nconducting more in-depth discussions with it on the\r\ntransfer of cases to Rwanda. It is especially\r\ncommendable that he has made efforts to get the local\r\npeople more involved in the judicial process, which\r\nenables them to achieve justice while maintaining\r\nownership. Japan hopes that the cooperation and\r\ndialogue between the ICTR and the Rwanda\r\nGovernment will be further strengthened.\r\nAs a final point, let me reiterate one lesson that\r\nwe have learned from the ICTY and the ICTR. The\r\nmember States cannot fund the expenses for the pursuit\r\nof justice unlimitedly. The Secretary-General pointed\r\nthat out in his report on the rule of law and transitional\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\njustice, and the importance of that lesson was also\r\nunderscored by many of the Member States\r\nparticipating in the open debate at the Security Council\r\non 6 October. The Secretary-General stated in his\r\nreport that\r\nThe stark differential between cost and number\r\nof cases processed does raise important\r\nquestions In addressing these cost-related\r\nissues, high priority should be given to\r\nconsideration of the need to provide for an\r\neffective system for delivery of justice.\r\n(A/2004/616*, para. 42)\r\nAlthough we do note from the presentations by\r\nthe Presidents of both tribunals that efforts have been\r\nmade to address that issue, the current gap between\r\ncost and the number of cases processed is still\r\ninappropriate. We believe that the operation and cost of\r\nthe Tribunals should be phased down in accordance\r\nwith the completion strategies. With those concerns in\r\nmind, Japan strongly hopes that the ICTY and the\r\nICTR will continue to maximize their efforts to\r\nconduct fair trials in an efficient and effective manner,\r\nunder the leadership of their Presidents, in order to\r\nfulfil their commitments to the completion strategies\r\nendorsed by the Security Council.\r\nMr. Shin (Republic of Korea): At the outset,\r\nallow me to express my sincere gratitude to the\r\nPresident of the International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia (ICTY), Judge Theodor Meron, and\r\nto Judge Erik Møse, President of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), for their\r\ndetailed and informative reports.\r\nI also would like to express my deep appreciation\r\nto Ms. Carla del Ponte, the Chief Prosecutor of the\r\nICTY, and its 25 judges, including nine ad litem\r\njudges, for their hard work and dedication to the\r\nrealization of international justice. My heartfelt thanks\r\nalso go to Mr. Hassan Bubacar Jallow, the Chief\r\nProsecutor of the ICTR, and its 25 judges.\r\nSince they were established as the precursor of a\r\npermanent international criminal court in the 1990s,\r\nthe ICTY and the ICTR have made great contributions\r\ntowards the development of international criminal law\r\nand international humanitarian law by accumulating\r\nimportant judicial precedents regarding genocide,\r\ncrimes against humanity and serious war crimes.\r\nThanks to the pioneering work of the two Tribunals,\r\nvaluable lessons are now available for the International\r\nCriminal Court, which has just begun investigations in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda.\r\nThose lessons are also applicable to the Special Court\r\nfor Sierra Leone, war crimes prosecutions in Kosovo,\r\nthe East Timor Special Panels for Serious Crimes and\r\nthe Extraordinary Chambers of Cambodia.\r\nWe believe that, in order to achieve the objective\r\nof eliminating the culture of impunity that exists during\r\narmed conflicts and post-conflict situations, it is\r\nimportant for the international community to establish\r\na seamless web of transnational justice that can\r\nembrace both international and domestic jurisdictions\r\ntogether. Through such efforts, the international\r\ncommunity will be able to avoid any impunity gap that\r\nmay arise out of the presence of various judicial organs\r\ndesigned to punish international crimes, including\r\ninternational courts, special hybrid courts and domestic\r\ncourts. Furthermore, it would be desirable to explore\r\nthe possibility of creating a consulting mechanism\r\namong the various judicial bodies to share valuable\r\nexperiences and information on the operation of the\r\ncourts. In our view, now is the time for the\r\ninternational community to seriously consider how to\r\navert or minimize the possible fragmentation of\r\ninternational jurisprudence on international criminal\r\nlaw that could result from having diverse judicial\r\ninstitutions.\r\nMy Government commends the tireless efforts of\r\nthe ICTY and the ICTR to enhance efficiency in their\r\nproceedings, which will better enable them to carry out\r\ntheir completion strategy within the target date. The\r\ncompletion strategy they have pursued involves\r\nconducting trials simultaneously while referring cases\r\nof relatively less serious importance to domestic\r\njurisdictions equipped with the necessary capacity and\r\npersonnel. That approach allows the two Tribunals to\r\nfocus on the most senior echelon of perpetrators who\r\nhave committed egregious crimes of international\r\nconcern, opening the door to achieving the\r\ncomplementarity of international and domestic\r\njurisdiction in an effective manner.\r\nOne of the important lessons the two Tribunals\r\nhave demonstrated to the international community is\r\nthe wisdom of mapping out a division of work between\r\ninternational and domestic jurisdictions at an early\r\nstage of trials. In light of their deterrent effect, it is\r\nnatural that international criminal courts should\r\nconcentrate on the most important cases, both for the\r\nseriousness of the crimes involved and the symbolic\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\nmeaning of putting high-level, high-profile suspects on\r\ntrial. Moreover, the enormous cost of running the two\r\nTribunals makes it both desirable and imperative to\r\nfollow that division of work in order to lessen their\r\nheavy resource burden. The Republic of Korea hopes\r\nthat the International Criminal Court, the Special\r\nCourts and other courts will take full account of that\r\nvaluable lesson in their future activities.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation deems it crucial for\r\nthe international community to provide assistance to\r\nthe relevant domestic courts to facilitate their exercise\r\nof judicial functions in a transparent manner. We also\r\nappreciate the valuable cooperation of those States that\r\nhave signed an agreement with the United Nations to\r\nallow persons convicted by the Tribunals to serve out\r\nsentences in their territory or to provide assistance in\r\nthe relocation of witnesses.\r\nThe Republic of Korea would like to underscore\r\nthe pressing need for the Governments in the regions to\r\nfully cooperate in arresting the accused who remain at\r\nlarge and to procure witnesses, documents and other\r\nrelevant evidence. It is a source of concern for us that\r\nRadovan Karadzić, Ratko Mladić and Ante Gotovina,\r\nthree high-level leaders indicted by the ICTY, and\r\nFelicien Kabuga, indicted by the ICTR, have not yet\r\nbeen apprehended and brought before the Tribunals.\r\nWe believe that the Tribunals work will not be\r\ncomplete until those individuals are brought to justice.\r\nIn that regard, current efforts to apprehend those\r\nindictees should be intensified. We ask for prompt,\r\nconcerted action by the States in the regions to bring\r\nthe accused in for trial in order to allow the Tribunals\r\nto finish their trials by 2008 and to complete the\r\nappeals phase by 2010.\r\nWhile we support the two Tribunals recently\r\nadopted reforms to refer cases involving mid- and low-\r\nlevel criminals to national court jurisdictions, we also\r\nnote the importance of outreach programmes to dispel\r\nany possible wrong-headed notion that international\r\njustice is dispensed in a less than transparent way. My\r\ndelegation considers the practice of negotiating guilty\r\npleas, which was introduced in 2002, to be helpful in\r\neconomizing costs. However, the Tribunals must strike\r\na delicate balance between the need to preserve a sense\r\nof justice for victims and the international community\r\nand the interests of delivering justice in a cost-efficient\r\nway. Against that backdrop, it is essential for the States\r\nexercising jurisdiction over the cases to maintain\r\nvisibility of justice and to engage in outreach activities,\r\nboth on their own and in cooperation with the ICTY\r\nand ICTR.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation reaffirms its strong\r\nsupport for the work of the ICTY and the ICTR in\r\nadministering international criminal justice and in\r\nsetting valuable and important precedents in\r\ninternational criminal law and international\r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nMr. Loncar (Serbia and Montenegro) (spoke in\r\nSerbian; English text provided by the delegation): At\r\nthe outset, allow me to thank you, Sir, for the\r\nopportunity to present, on behalf of the State Union of\r\nSerbia and Montenegro and in my capacity as a\r\nmember of the National Council for Cooperation with\r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia (ICTY), our positions on the question under\r\nconsideration. I would also like to thank the President\r\nof the ICTY for his comprehensive briefing.\r\nFirst of all, let me take this opportunity to\r\nreaffirm that Serbia and Montenegro advocates the\r\nadministration of international justice through the\r\nindividualization of criminal responsibility. As a\r\nUnited Nations Member State in particular, Serbia and\r\nMontenegro recognizes its obligation to cooperate with\r\nthe ICTY. My country believes that it is in the best\r\ninterest of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro,\r\nas well as of the other States that emerged from the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, to bring to justice all those\r\nresponsible for grave violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law, irrespective of their ethnic origin,\r\neither in proceedings before the ICTY or in trials\r\nbefore the national courts.\r\nI am pleased to be in a position to report on the\r\nlatest aspects concerning cooperation between Serbia\r\nand Montenegro and the Tribunal. Following several\r\nelection campaigns  early parliamentary elections in\r\nSerbia late last year; presidential elections in Serbia in\r\nJune this year; and municipal elections in Serbia in\r\nDecember  that resulted in certain technical delays in\r\ncooperation in the first half of this year, the National\r\nCouncil for Cooperation with the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia was\r\nestablished as a legal and competent body and became\r\nfully operational in July. Serbia and Montenegro is\r\nproviding effective assistance to the Office of the\r\nProsecutor and the ICTY in tracking down,\r\ninterviewing and taking testimony from witnesses and\r\nsuspects. The Council of Ministers of Serbia and\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\nMontenegro and the Government of the Republic of\r\nSerbia have so far granted waivers for State, official\r\nand military secrets to 316 members of the army, police\r\nofficers and Government officials.\r\nSince the new National Council was created, 53\r\nwaivers have been granted, including those to be\r\nconfirmed at the session of the National Council\r\nscheduled for 16 November, for which the Government\r\nof Serbia has already granted waivers. The National\r\nCouncil for Cooperation with the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, acting on\r\nrequests from the Office of the Prosecutor for waivers,\r\nhas granted all waivers requested by 15 September.\r\nThe requests received after that date are currently\r\nbeing processed by the Council and will be completed\r\nwithin a reasonable period of time. Thus, not all\r\nrequests for waivers mentioned in the present report\r\nhave been met. As I said, new requests for waivers are\r\ncoming in every day and are being duly processed.\r\nThe Office of the Prosecutor has so far been\r\nprovided with several thousand documents, including\r\nclassified documents from sessions of the Supreme\r\nDefence Council, the Parliament of the Republic of\r\nSerbia, the Counter-Intelligence Service of the Army of\r\nSerbia and Montenegro, the Ministry of the Interior of\r\nSerbia and Montenegro, and so on. Since the new\r\nNational Council was constituted, 21 requests for\r\ndocuments have been granted.\r\nI am afraid that I cannot fail to mention certain\r\nobjective obstacles that State officials and civil\r\nservants have encountered in fulfilling requests for\r\ndocuments. Most of the documents originate from 1991\r\nand 1992 and some are unavailable due to negligent\r\npractices or misconduct by some officials. In such\r\ncases, criminal proceedings have been instituted. Some\r\nof the documents were destroyed in the 1999 North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization air strikes, since most\r\nwere kept in military and police facilities that were\r\nexposed to severe fire. We have to bear in mind that\r\nsome requests for documents are not entirely precise\r\nand that the Office of the Prosecutor should provide\r\nadditional clarification. Despite the obstacles and\r\nsometimes complicated administrative and bureaucratic\r\nprocedures, the pace of making the documents\r\navailable to the Prosecutor has significantly improved\r\nin recent months.\r\nThe competent State authorities, particularly with\r\nrespect to Ratko Mladić, are undertaking a number of\r\ncredible and verifiable activities to establish whether\r\nhe is in the territory of our country. Several operations\r\nhave already been undertaken, but no viable evidence\r\nhas emerged that Mladić is in the territory of the State\r\nUnion.\r\nAs a sign of intensified cooperation with the\r\nICTY, several high-ranking State officials met with the\r\nPresident of the ICTY, Judge Meron, and Chief\r\nProsecutor Del Ponte. The President of the National\r\nCouncil, Minister Ljajic, met with the top ICTY\r\nofficials in The Hague in September. The Chief\r\nProsecutor visited Belgrade on 30 September and\r\n4 October and met Serbia and Montenegros top\r\nGovernment representatives, including the President of\r\nthe State Union, Mr. Marović; the President of Serbia,\r\nMr. Tadić; Foreign Minister Dracović; and the Serbian\r\nPrime Minister, Mr. Kostunica. The exchange of visits\r\ndemonstrated the readiness of Serbia and Montenegro\r\nto continue to cooperate fully with the ICTY in all\r\nsectors, on the one hand, and the understanding of its\r\ninternal difficulties, on the other. Those visits have\r\nsignificantly contributed to the re-establishment of an\r\natmosphere of mutual confidence and openness.\r\nOn 9 October, Colonel Ljubia Beara of the\r\nRepublika Srpska Army and one of the most wanted\r\nsuspects in the Srebrenica massacre, voluntarily\r\nsurrendered to the Serbian authorities. He was\r\nimmediately transferred to The Hague, accompanied by\r\nthe Minister of Justice of Serbia, Mr. Stojkovic.\r\nCounting Colonel Beara, the number of indictees\r\ntransferred from Serbia and Montenegro to the\r\nTribunal since January 2003 amounts to 24. Serbia and\r\nMontenegro continues to take all necessary measures\r\nto arrest the remaining fugitives who are believed to be\r\nin its territory.\r\nThe authorities of Serbia and Montenegro,\r\ntogether with the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europes Representative Office in\r\nBelgrade, have launched a campaign to raise public\r\nawareness in Serbia and Montenegro on the need to\r\ncooperate with the ICTY.\r\nSuccessful cooperation with the ICTY also means\r\nadequate public understanding and support for the\r\npeople of Serbia and Montenegro vis-à-vis the actions\r\nof the competent authorities. At this point, cooperation\r\nwith the ICTY should go both ways, particularly with\r\nregard to provisional release until trial of some of the\r\nindictees who surrendered voluntarily and for whom\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\nthe Government of Serbia provided proper guarantees\r\nto the Tribunal. The authorities of Serbia and\r\nMontenegro and the Government of the Republic of\r\nSerbia continue to work hard to fulfil their\r\ninternational obligations to the ICTY. One of the ways\r\nto fulfil those obligations successfully is to voluntarily\r\nsurrender accused persons.\r\nAlong with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and\r\nMontenegro has adopted a regional approach to\r\ncooperation with the ICTY. After the visit of the\r\nPresident of the National Council to Sarajevo earlier\r\nthis year, a joint commission of competent authorities\r\nfrom the two countries was established to monitor the\r\nborder and stop fugitives from crossing it.\r\nSerbia and Montenegro adds its voice in support\r\nof the Tribunals completion strategy as specified in\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1503 (2003) and 1534\r\n(2004). The essential precondition for the success of\r\nthat strategy is the existence and ability of domestic\r\njurisdictions to try referred cases and to meet\r\ninternational legal standards in the proceedings.\r\nThe Ovčara case is currently being tried by the\r\nWar Crimes Panel of the Belgrade District Court, in\r\nclose cooperation and consultation with the ICTY. The\r\nBelgrade District Court War Crimes Prosecutor is also\r\nactively cooperating with the ICTY Prosecutor in\r\npreparing other cases, as a result of which another case\r\nwas transferred to the Belgrade District Court.\r\nOur authorities  namely, the Ministry of Justice\r\nof the Republic of Serbia  have drafted and sent to\r\nthe parliament a new law regulating witness protection\r\nand the recognition of evidence gathered in\r\nnon-domestic courts and prosecution offices. Serbia\r\nand Montenegro is willing and adequately prepared to\r\nprosecute referred cases in its own courts. The\r\nBelgrade District Court and its judges and the War\r\nCrimes Prosecutor are professionally and technically\r\ncapable of prosecuting those cases according to\r\ninternationally recognized standards of justice. That\r\nwas recognized by the Prosecutor in the Kovačević\r\ncase when the accused was transferred to Serbia\r\ndespite the strong pressure brought to bear on the\r\nauthorities in 2002 and 2003 to have him arrested and\r\ntransferred to The Hague. That case demonstrates that\r\nthere is a need for a two-way, mutually beneficial\r\nmodel of cooperation with the ICTY. Serbia and\r\nMontenegro awaits the transfer of further cases to be\r\nprocessed before its domestic courts.\r\nIn order to improve our capacity to prosecute war\r\ncrimes, we look forward to further training\r\nopportunities for judges and prosecutors from Serbia\r\nand Montenegro. We look forward to similar\r\nopportunities with regard to assistance in amending\r\ndomestic criminal legislation in line with ICTY\r\nstandards.\r\nAll of Serbia and Montenegros leaders \r\nincluding President Marović, Serbian President Tadić,\r\nPrime Minister Kotunica and Foreign Minister\r\nDraković  advocate the fulfilment of all of Serbia\r\nand Montenegros obligations to the ICTY. We believe\r\nthat the future of all the countries of the former\r\nYugoslavia lies in their integration with Europe. That\r\nwill not be possible without full reconciliation among\r\nthe peoples of the former Yugoslavia. Serbia and\r\nMontenegro will continue to cooperate fully with the\r\nICTY. Our domestic courts are now ready to bring to\r\njustice all those individually responsible for the war\r\ncrimes committed in the territory of the former\r\nYugoslavia.\r\nMr. Kusljugić (Bosnia and Herzegovina): Allow\r\nme to take this opportunity to thank the President of\r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia (ICTY), Judge Theodor Meron, and Chief\r\nProsecutor Carla Del Ponte for their annual report\r\n(A/59/215) and for their very clear and straightforward\r\nmessages with regard to the Tribunals current\r\nproblems, which they articulated in their statements.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina once again reaffirms its\r\nsupport for the Tribunal and commends its entire staff\r\nfor their efforts to prevent impunity and bring to justice\r\nthose responsible for the most serious crimes against\r\nhumanity, thereby setting new milestones in\r\ninternational criminal justice.\r\nIn the 11 years of its existence, the ICTY has\r\nestablished itself as an impartial, professional and\r\ncompetent institution. Its role was twofold. On the one\r\nhand, its historical role was to set the record straight\r\nand to individualize responsibility for some of the most\r\ngruesome crimes against humanity, thereby relieving\r\nthe participants to the conflict of collective guilt. On\r\nthe other hand, but no less important, was its role as a\r\npioneer in international criminal justice, thereby\r\npaving the path for the Rome Statute and the\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court. In\r\nthe meantime, preventing impunity has become a\r\nwidely accepted international practice, and the\r\ninvestigations, processes and verdicts of both the ICTY\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\nand the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda\r\n(ICTR) have become an important part of international\r\njudicial practice.\r\nOne hundred and four accused war criminals have\r\nappeared in proceedings before the ICTY. Fifty-two of\r\nthem have received Trial Chamber judgements, 30\r\nhave received their final sentences and 10 convicts\r\nhave already served their sentences.\r\nWe regret to learn from President Meron that\r\ninternational financial assistance for the Tribunal\r\nappears to be drying up. On behalf of my country, I\r\nwould like to reiterate the call to the main contributors\r\nto continue their support to the Tribunal for as long as\r\nit is necessary.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina would like in particular\r\nto underscore the role of the Tribunal in the\r\nindividualization of war crimes as a precondition for\r\nsustainable interethnic reconciliation in the country and\r\nin the region as a whole. We believe that the gestures\r\nmade by indictees who not only pleaded guilty but also\r\nexpressed remorse to the victims for the crimes they\r\ncommitted represent a milestone in the reconciliation\r\nprocess. In that respect, the increase in the number of\r\nguilty pleas has particular significance legally and\r\nhistorically, as well as for the hundreds of thousands of\r\nthe victims of war crimes.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina remains determined to\r\ncontinue to meet its obligations with regard to\r\ncooperation with the ICTY. Our record with respect to\r\nthe arrest and transfer of indictees still at large,\r\nrequests for documents, access to archives and ready\r\navailability of witnesses has improved in the last year.\r\nLast Monday, the human rights chamber of the\r\nConstitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\naccepted the report of the Government of the\r\nRepublika Srpska on the events in and around\r\nSrebrenica in July 1995. The report not only contains\r\nthe names of more than 7,800 victims and discloses\r\nseveral new locations of mass graves, it also accepts\r\nthe share of responsibility placed upon the Republika\r\nSrpska and expresses remorse to the families of the\r\nvictims. By completing its report, the Special\r\nCommission on Srebrenica laid a foundation for\r\nsuccessful post-war reconciliation.\r\nHowever, despite the evident progress in\r\ncooperation with the Tribunal, many indicted war\r\ncriminals have still not been apprehended. That creates\r\na major obstacle to interethnic reconciliation because,\r\nin order for the country to come to terms with its tragic\r\npast and move on, all indictees must go to The Hague\r\nto face justice. That was also the reason Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina was denied membership in the Partnership\r\nfor Peace at NATOs Istanbul Summit in June of this\r\nyear. Allow me to quote what NATO leaders said in\r\nthat regard at Istanbul.\r\nWe are concerned that Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nparticularly obstructionist elements in the\r\nRepublika Srpska entity, has failed to live up to\r\nits obligation to cooperate fully with ICTY,\r\nincluding the arrest and transfer to the\r\njurisdiction of the Tribunal of war crimes\r\nindictees, a fundamental requirement for the\r\ncountry to join Partnership for Peace.\r\nThe European Union has also reiterated that full\r\ncooperation with the ICTY on the part of the countries\r\nof the Western Balkans remains the essential element\r\nof the European Unions Stabilization and Association\r\nProcess. The Union also underscored that failure to\r\ncooperate fully with the ICTY would seriously\r\njeopardize further movement towards the European\r\nUnion. It is therefore clear that the failure to cooperate\r\nfully with the ICTY is now the main obstacle to Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovinas becoming a stable, peaceful and\r\nprosperous European democracy.\r\nCriminal files against 5,908 persons have been\r\nsubmitted to the Prosecutors Office for review, but\r\nonly about 100 persons have been brought before the\r\ncourts. Hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of\r\nsuspected perpetrators of serious war crimes committed\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina have therefore not even\r\nbeen charged. They include community members,\r\noutsiders who may have contributed to the outbreak of\r\nviolence and bystanders who did not participate in\r\ncrimes but also did not intervene to stop them.\r\nBased on its exit strategy, the ICTY intends to\r\ntransfer to domestic courts the dossiers of unfinished\r\ninvestigations and investigative materials. It will then\r\nbe up to domestic judicial and prosecutorial authorities\r\nto act on those cases. That process will begin next year\r\nand will represent a serious test for the maturity of the\r\ndomestic courts. It will also be an important step in the\r\nbuilding of institutions of justice in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, which will contribute to significant\r\nprogress towards the creation of a society based on the\r\nrule of law and respect for human rights. In that\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\nrespect, it is very important to complete the process of\r\nstaffing and budgeting the special war crimes chamber\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovinas State Court while taking\r\ninto account the considerable workload to be put\r\nbefore it in the near future.\r\nRegarding the external component of the ICTYs\r\ncompletion strategy, Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nwelcomes the cooperation between the ICTY and the\r\nOffice of the High Representative in the process of\r\nestablishing a special chamber for war crimes\r\nprosecutions in the State Court of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. We call upon Member States to provide\r\nthe necessary technical and financial support for its\r\nfunctioning. We also fully support the significant work\r\nbeing done by the missions of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in the\r\nregion to promote the rule of law, including by\r\nstrengthening national judicial systems and supporting\r\npolice reform. The monitoring of domestic war crimes\r\ntrials constitutes an essential contribution in that\r\nregard. We welcome proposals for greater involvement\r\nby the OSCE in support of the ICTYs completion\r\nstrategy.\r\nMr. Strømmen (Norway): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing Norways full recognition of the\r\nachievements and the high standards of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)\r\nand the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia (ICTY), as reflected in various judgements\r\nand in the reports before us (A/59/183 and A/59/215).\r\nWe would like to thank the Presidents of the Tribunals\r\nfor the detailed annual reports, which in our view\r\naccurately reflect the progress made during the period\r\nunder review.\r\nWhile the work of the Tribunals has played a\r\ncrucial role in advancing the cause of justice in\r\nRwanda and the former Yugoslavia, the Tribunals have\r\na broader significance as well. They represent effective\r\nsystems of international criminal law and leave a\r\nlegacy of international jurisprudence that can guide\r\nother courts, including the International Criminal\r\nCourt, and discourage the commission of the worst\r\ncrimes of international concern. Thus they contribute\r\nto the development of international criminal justice and\r\nthe fight against impunity for mass atrocities in\r\ngeneral.\r\nDuring the period under review, cooperation\r\nbetween the two Tribunals has been enhanced and\r\nexpanded to include the Special Court for Sierra Leone\r\nand the International Criminal Court. Norway\r\nappreciates the increased exchange of information and\r\nexperience and the undertaking of joint activities,\r\nwhich help to strengthen international criminal justice.\r\nWe commend both Tribunals on their efforts to\r\nput the completion strategies into effect. The Tribunals\r\nhave increased their efficiency significantly, and both\r\nare on schedule. However, their financial situation of\r\nthe Tribunals is deeply worrying and could severely\r\nthreaten the implementation of the completion\r\nstrategies. Sixty per cent of Member States are in\r\narrears. The financial situation has led to a freeze on\r\nnew recruitment, which prevents both Tribunals from\r\nrecruiting, and even replacing, essential personnel. We\r\ntherefore appeal to all States that have not yet done so\r\nto honour their financial commitments and to pay their\r\nassessed contributions as soon as possible.\r\nAccording to the report of the ICTR, 25 persons\r\nwill be on trial by the end of 2004, bringing the\r\nnumber of accused whose trials have been completed\r\nor are in process to 48. The ICTY has also continued to\r\noperate at full capacity, running six trials\r\nsimultaneously, and has rendered judgements in a\r\nrecord number of trials and appeals proceedings.\r\nNorway is pleased to be able to finance the\r\nconstruction of a fourth courtroom at the ICTR, which\r\nwill further increase the Tribunals trial capacity. That\r\ncontribution is testimony of our continuing strong\r\nsupport for the Tribunal, which was underlined by\r\nNorwegian Prime Minister Bondeviks visit to the\r\nTribunal on 11 October.\r\nIn implementing the completion strategies both\r\nTribunals have resolved to concentrate on the most\r\nsenior leaders suspected of bearing the greatest\r\nresponsibility for the crimes within their jurisdiction.\r\nAt the same time, the Tribunals have focused on\r\ntransferring cases involving intermediate and low-level\r\noffenders to national jurisdictions. That is essential if\r\nthe Tribunals are to complete their work by the\r\ndeadline of 2010. It is equally important that they\r\nreceive the full support and cooperation of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe are encouraged by the establishment of the\r\nWar Crimes Chamber of the State Court of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and the intent to commence domestic war\r\ncrimes prosecutions in January 2005. We are also\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\npleased to hear that preconditions for referring cases to\r\nRwandan courts have been established.\r\nThe Tribunals increased cooperation with States,\r\nrelevant institutions and non-governmental\r\norganizations is partly a result of the expanded\r\nactivities and continuous development of the\r\nTribunals outreach programmes. Norway commends\r\ntheir efforts to strengthen national jurisdiction in their\r\nhandling of war crimes cases and to provide accurate\r\ninformation about their activities in order to raise\r\nawareness of, and support for, their work.\r\nNorway welcomes the unanimous adoption by the\r\nSecurity Council in March of a resolution reaffirming\r\nthe need to intensify efforts to arrest and transfer the\r\nmain fugitive indictees and bring them to trial \r\nincluding Radovan Karadzić, Ratko Mladić and Ante\r\nGotovina to the Yugoslav Tribunal and Felicien\r\nKabuga to the Rwanda Tribunal. Unless the highest-\r\nranking indictees are brought to justice, the main\r\nmission of the Tribunals will not be fulfilled. We\r\napplaud the Croatian authorities for their improved\r\ncooperation during the period under review, and we\r\nexpect them to continue doing their utmost to ensure\r\nthat General Gotovina is brought to The Hague.\r\nAll States must honour their international\r\nobligations to cooperate with regard to requests for\r\naccess to archives and documents, surrendering\r\nindictees, providing full and effective assistance with\r\nregard to witnesses, giving financial and material\r\nsupport and, not least, providing practical assistance in\r\nthe enforcement of sentences. The Norwegian\r\nGovernment has demonstrated its willingness to\r\nconsider applications from the ICTY concerning the\r\nenforcement of sentences and, subsequently, in\r\nconformity with national law, to receive a limited\r\nnumber of convicted persons to serve their sentences in\r\nNorway. We encourage other States to prove their\r\ncontinued commitment to the work of the Tribunals\r\nthrough concrete action in this crucial field.\r\nLet me conclude by thanking all the members of\r\nthe Tribunals for their tireless efforts in carrying out\r\nour common task. I can assure you that we will stand\r\nby our long-term commitment to the successful\r\ncompletion of the missions assigned to the two\r\nTribunals by the Security Council.\r\nMs. Moore (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States remains strongly committed to\r\nsupporting the International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). The United\r\nStates appreciates the work of both Tribunals in\r\nbringing to justice those most responsible for serious\r\nviolations of international humanitarian law.\r\nWith regard to the ICTY, we must all work\r\ntogether to ensure success of the Security Council-\r\nendorsed completion strategy that seeks to conclude\r\ninvestigations by the end of 2004, trials by 2008 and\r\nall work by 2010. To fulfil that programme, Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia must\r\nfulfil their legal obligations to cooperate fully with the\r\nICTY. Such cooperation includes not only access to\r\narchives and witnesses, but also apprehending all\r\nfugitive indictees within their territory and transferring\r\nthem to The Hague, most notably Ratko Mladić,\r\nRadovan Karadzić, and Ante Gotovina. In that regard,\r\nwe note that the Republika Srpska has failed to render\r\na single fugitive indictee to the Tribunal and Serbia and\r\nMontenegros cooperation has deteriorated to a\r\nstandstill in the past 12 months. The United States and\r\nothers in the international community have made clear\r\nthat upholding international obligations to the ICTY is\r\na prerequisite for further integration into the Euro-\r\nAtlantic community.\r\nSerbia and Montenegros lack of cooperation with\r\nthe ICTY also undermines the confidence of the\r\ninternational community that it is willing and able to\r\nprosecute fairly and effectively perpetrators of war\r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity. Until Serbia meets\r\nits cooperation obligations, we do not see domestic\r\ntrials of ICTY indictees as a realistic option. We call on\r\nall authorities in Serbia, especially the Prime Minister\r\nas head of the Government, to act immediately to\r\napprehend and render to The Hague all fugitives hiding\r\nin the country.\r\nWe continue to support efforts to help create the\r\ncapacity for credible domestic trials of low- and mid-\r\nlevel war crime cases throughout the region. We note\r\nthe significant work being done in Sarajevo in that\r\nregard and urge other States to contribute to this court\r\neither through direct financial assistance or in-kind\r\ncontributions.\r\nThe United States has completed the transfer to\r\nthe United Nations of all of its 2004 assessed\r\ncontributions for the ICTY and is committed to\r\nsignificant financial and diplomatic support to the\r\nICTY.\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\nWith regard to the ICTR, first we note and\r\ncommend the increased pace of trials under the\r\nleadership of its President. We urge all States,\r\nespecially the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the\r\nRepublic of the Congo and Kenya, to fulfil their\r\ninternational obligations to apprehend and transfer to\r\nthe Tribunal Felicien Kabuga and all other persons\r\nwithin their territory who have been indicted for war\r\ncrimes by the ICTR. Those fugitive indictees continue\r\nto incite conflict in the Great Lakes region and must be\r\nactively pursued and apprehended, as called for\r\nrepeatedly by the Security Council.\r\nMr. Awanbor (Nigeria): I would like to\r\ncongratulate Judge Erik Møse, President of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR),\r\nand Judge Theodor Meron, President of International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY),\r\nfor their detailed reports on the activities of their\r\nrespective Tribunals.\r\nThe Nigerian delegation appreciates the fact that\r\nthe Tribunals are engaged in an historic and\r\nfundamental undertaking that is of great significance\r\nfor humanity. They indeed reaffirm the collective\r\nresolve of Member States of the United Nations to\r\nensure respect for international humanitarian law,\r\nfundamental human rights and the rule of law. By\r\nestablishing those two Tribunals, the international\r\ncommunity has resolved to put a stop to the\r\nperpetration of genocide and other heinous crimes\r\nagainst humanity.\r\nMy delegation is, therefore, delighted to note the\r\nsignificant progress made by both the ICTY and the\r\nICTR in fulfilling their respective mandates concerning\r\nprosecution of persons responsible for serious\r\nviolations of international humanitarian law in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia since 1991 and in Rwanda between\r\n1 January and 31 December 1994.\r\nIt is gratifying to note that the cooperation\r\nbetween the two Tribunals has been expanded and\r\nstrengthened to include the Special Court for Sierra\r\nLeone and the International Criminal Court. The\r\nexchange of information and experience and the\r\nundertaking of joint activities by those two judicial\r\nbodies have contributed greatly to the strengthening of\r\ninternational criminal justice. In that regard, we believe\r\nthe pioneer work of the Registrar of the ICTR in the\r\narea of restitutive justice has impacted positively on\r\nthe Statute of the International Criminal Court.\r\nIt is our belief that the Rwanda Tribunal, through\r\nits work, has made a significant contribution to the\r\nenrichment of international jurisprudence and the\r\nrejection of the culture of impunity by replacing it with\r\nthe values of accountability and the rule of law. For\r\nexample, the Tribunals decisions are already creating a\r\nsubstantial body of case law, which is being\r\nacknowledged by the ICTY and by national courts\r\nacross the world. It is pertinent to mention that during\r\nthe period under review, the ICTR released a second\r\nedition of its CD-ROM on basic documents and case\r\nlaw, covering the period from 2001 to 2002.\r\nAccordingly, we commend the ICTR for having\r\ndelivered 17 judgments involving 23 accused since the\r\ncommencement of the first trial in January 1997. It is\r\nencouraging to learn that 20 accused have been\r\nconvicted and three acquitted and that 25 persons will\r\nalso be on trial by the end of this year, bringing the\r\ntotal number of accused persons to 48. We note that the\r\ntrials of 16 current detainees are expected to start from\r\n2005 onwards.\r\nConcerning the completion strategy, it is\r\ngratifying that the ICTR is on schedule to complete all\r\ntrials by 2008, in accordance with Security Council\r\nresolution 1503 (2003). It is proper that the Prosecutor\r\nwould concentrate on those individuals who held\r\nleadership positions as bearing the gravest\r\nresponsibility for the crimes committed, while those\r\nthat have been classified as having participated in\r\nmedium- to low-level crimes would be transferred to\r\nnational jurisdictions for trial. We call for the\r\ncooperation of States to facilitate the arrest and transfer\r\nof the 17 indictees and 16 suspects who remain at\r\nlarge. For that purpose we further call for the\r\nstrengthening of national legal systems in the effort to\r\nensure a smooth transfer of identified individuals to\r\nnational jurisdictions for trial.\r\nWe commend the Rwanda Tribunal for its efforts\r\nto enhance its operational efficiency through the\r\nmanagement reforms and organizational restructuring\r\nundertaken in the immediate Office of the Registrar\r\nand other important sections of the Judicial and Legal\r\nServices Division, as well as the Division of\r\nAdministrative Support Services. The re-amalgamation\r\nof the witnesses and victims support mechanisms of the\r\nRegistry into a single section and remerger of the\r\nmanagement of the United Nations Detention Facility\r\nwith that of the Defence Counsel to form the Defence\r\nCounsel and Detention Management Section are\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\nimportant changes. We commend the Registrars\r\ndetermined efforts and initiative to promote better\r\nknowledge and awareness at various levels of civil\r\nsociety about the work of the ICTR, particularly, in\r\nRwanda and the Great Lakes region. We appreciate the\r\nsignificant improvements in both the records-keeping\r\nand the dissemination of judicial documents at ICTR\r\nby the provision of an up-to-date database of the\r\njudicial records intended for public access through the\r\nTribunals web site.\r\nConcerning the ICTY, we commend the important\r\ninitiatives taken by the Tribunal to increase the\r\nefficiency and pace of its proceedings, which has\r\nenabled the Trial Chambers to examine six trials on the\r\nmerits, two cases of contempt, two judgements on the\r\nmerits, and nine sentencing judgements arising from\r\nnine guilty pleas. It is equally remarkable that the\r\nAppeals Chamber was able to dispose of 17\r\ninterlocutory appeals, four appeals from judgement and\r\none request for review, during the period under review.\r\nWe note with satisfaction the internal reforms in\r\nICTY, which are geared towards the Tribunals\r\ncompletion of its work within the deadline. It is\r\nsignificant that the internal reforms included new\r\namendments to Rules of Procedure and Evidence to\r\nensure that all indictments confirmed by the Tribunal\r\nmeet the Security Councils directives and to authorize\r\nTrial Chambers to refer a case to any jurisdiction in\r\nwhich the accused could have a fair trial, without the\r\nimposition of death penalty.\r\nIt is also noteworthy that the Tribunal continued\r\npreparing the States in the region for the prosecution of\r\nwar crimes cases. In this regard, the concerted efforts\r\nto facilitate trial readiness by way of supporting legal\r\nreform, witness protection, detention facilities,\r\ncapacity-building, seminars and training for personnel\r\nof domestic courts throughout the territories of the\r\nformer Yugoslavia are steps in the right direction.\r\nFinally, the ICTR and ICTY need the sustained\r\nsupport of the international community. In particular,\r\nadequate financial resources should be made available\r\nto them to complete their work within the stipulated\r\ntime. Nigeria reaffirms its continued support for the\r\nwork of the Tribunals in concert with the collective\r\nresolve to fight impunity and abuse of international\r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nMr. Mwandembwa (United Republic of\r\nTanzania): Like others who have spoken before us, my\r\ndelegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, as contained in document A/59/183, and the\r\nninth annual report delivered before this Assembly by\r\nJudge Erik Møse, the President of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda. We would also like to\r\nthank Judge Theodore Meron, President of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia for the eleventh annual report of the ICTY.\r\nMy delegation wishes to commend the work done by\r\nthe ICTR during the period under review. Since July\r\n2003, the ICTR has commenced 5 new trials involving\r\n11 accused. Our experience over the past years\r\nindicates that the ICTR has increased its pace to deal\r\nwith new cases.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the most recent version\r\nof completion plan that was submitted to the Security\r\nCouncil on 30 April 2004. It is our hope that the\r\nTribunal will get the much needed resources to\r\nfacilitate the implementation of the completion\r\nstrategy. We call upon Member States to pay their\r\ncontributions to the ad hoc tribunals in order to\r\nfacilitate their work.\r\nTurning to the ICTR, my delegation wishes to\r\ncommend the ICTR Prosecutor, Mr. Hassan Bubacar\r\nJallow, for his efforts to increase the number of\r\nprosecutions and to conduct speedy trials. Since he has\r\ntaken office, the Prosecutor has drawn up an action\r\nplan for the completion strategy. Under his leadership,\r\nthe tracking team has been revamped and greater\r\ncooperation has been sought from countries holding\r\nsome of the fugitives. We also commend the\r\nProsecutor, not only for his frequent and constant\r\npresence in Rwanda, the location of the crime and of\r\nthe Investigation Division Office, but also for greater\r\ncooperation with the Rwandan Government.\r\nAs host country to the ICTR, Tanzania has\r\nworked closely with the Tribunal. We have fully\r\nimplemented the Host Country Agreement and\r\nfacilitated other needs through the Joint Facilitation\r\nCommittee of senior representatives of Tanzania and\r\nthe ICTR.\r\nNow that the Tribunal is working towards\r\ncompletion of its work in the year 2008, my delegation\r\nwishes to invite the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community to locate some international\r\njudiciary body to the Tribunal facility after completion\r\nof the Tribunals work. Much has been invested to put\r\nin place the infrastructure there, therefore it is only\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\nreasonable to start thinking on how best to re-employ\r\nthe facility for the benefit of international community.\r\nMr. Kamanzi (Rwanda): My delegation wishes\r\nto thank you for the opportunity provided by this\r\nmeeting, at which we have heard statements from the\r\nPresidents of the International Criminal Tribunals for\r\nRwanda and the former Yugoslavia. My delegation\r\nwishes to confine its remarks to the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda. We would like to thank\r\nand congratulate the President of the ICTR, Judge Erik\r\nMøse for his statement, and we welcome his\r\nconfirmation that the completion strategy is on course.\r\nThe Rwanda Government would like to assure Judge\r\nMøse and the General Assembly of our continued\r\nsupport for the Tribunal.\r\nThis November, we mark 10 years since the\r\nSecurity Council adopted the resolution establishing\r\nthe ICTR. We recognize that this provides a good\r\nopportunity for us to take stock and make an\r\nassessment of the Tribunals performance so far. We\r\nshould also ask ourselves what needs to be done to\r\nensure that the Tribunal continues to improve its\r\nefficiency and effectiveness so that it can complete its\r\nwork within the agreed timeframe.\r\nSince it began its work, the ICTR has completed\r\ntrials of 9 individuals. The trials of a further 11 have\r\nbeen completed at the first instance and await appeal.\r\nThe trials of 25 individuals are on-going, while a\r\nfurther 17 individuals are awaiting trial. Eight\r\nindividuals whom the ICTR has targeted for\r\nprosecution, including one of the key masterminds and\r\nfinanciers of the genocide, Felicien Kabuga, remain at\r\nlarge. We call upon all Member States to cooperate\r\nwith the Tribunal to ensure that all indictees face\r\njustice.\r\nAlthough we recognize and commend the\r\nTribunal for its work so far, we should point out that 10\r\nyears ago, when the ICTR was established, we had\r\nhoped that by now more progress would have been\r\nachieved. We note that, originally, the Office of the\r\nProsecutor (OTP) had identified more than 300 big\r\nfish for prosecution before the Tribunal completed its\r\nwork. Today, the completion target of the Tribunal is\r\nsignificantly more modest. If it apprehends and puts on\r\ntrial the suspects still at large, and completes the trials\r\nof the suspects still awaiting trial and those whose\r\ntrials are still in progress or awaiting appeal, the\r\nTribunal will have completed the trials of 77\r\nindividuals when it concludes its work. Given that the\r\ntrials of only 20 of these individuals have been\r\ncompleted at the first instance or appeal in the last 10\r\nyears, it is imperative that the Tribunal should work\r\neffectively and that it be given the requisite support by\r\nthe General Assembly to complete its remaining\r\nworkload in the next six years.\r\nMy Government recalls that the transfer of cases\r\nfrom the Tribunal to Rwandan jurisdiction was\r\nenvisaged as central to the objective of bringing the\r\nperpetrators of the genocide to justice when the ICTR\r\nwas established 10 years ago. Although the process of\r\ntransferring cases has not yet begun, we hope that it\r\nvery soon will. We stand ready to facilitate the process\r\nwherever possible.\r\nMy Government also recognizes that transferring\r\nat least 40 cases to Rwanda for trial may be the only\r\nrealistic way for the Tribunal to complete its work\r\nwithin the time frame outlined in the completion\r\nstrategy.\r\nWith respect to the concern expressed about the\r\nfact that the death penalty remains on Rwandas statute\r\nbooks, we would like to take this opportunity to\r\nreiterate our assurances that the death penalty will not\r\nbe exercised with respect to cases transferred from the\r\nICTR.\r\nWe would also like to note that Rwanda will\r\nrequire support for training its investigators, lawyers\r\nand judges, as well as upgrading its court facilities and\r\ninfrastructure, in order to handle the trials with the\r\nhighest level of professionalism and efficiency. This\r\nassessment is supported in the ninth annual report of\r\nthe Tribunal. My Government is in discussion with the\r\nTribunal on the matter and we expect that it will be a\r\nfeature of our discussions under this agenda item next\r\nyear.\r\nMy Government appreciates the support of the\r\ninternational community, which enabled it to construct\r\na detention facility in Rwanda that meets international\r\nstandards. We expect that convicts will now serve\r\nsentences in Rwanda. That will contribute to the\r\nprocess of reconciliation, healing and eradicating the\r\nculture of impunity, as the people will now be able to\r\nmake a direct link between crimes committed and\r\npunishments rendered.\r\nThe Rwandan Government welcomes the\r\nprogress made in improving the overall efficiency and\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\neffectiveness of the Tribunal over the past 12 months.\r\nThe people of Rwanda continue to expect the Tribunal\r\nto deliver justice to the authors and planners of the\r\n1994 genocide. Justice is a central and indispensable\r\ncomponent of the process of reconciliation and national\r\nrenewal in Rwanda. We therefore consider it vital for\r\nthe Tribunal to succeed in the tasks that we, as States\r\nMembers of the United Nations, have set out for it.\r\nMy Government would like once again to renew\r\nits commitment to working in support of the three\r\norgans of the Tribunal, as we have done over the past\r\n10 years.\r\nWe are concerned that late payment or non-\r\npayment of assessed contributions by Member States to\r\nthe Tribunal has resulted in serious financial\r\ndifficulties, leading to recruitment freezes and a\r\nslowdown in its work. This slowdown comes at a time\r\nwhen we expect the Tribunal to be working steadily\r\ntowards implementing its completion strategy. It is\r\nimperative that Member States make their\r\ncontributions on time, in full and without conditions if\r\nwe are to realize the goals outlined in the completion\r\nstrategy.\r\nFinally, my delegation would like to bring to the\r\nattention of the General Assembly the plight of many\r\nof the survivors of the 1994 genocide, who live in\r\nconditions of enormous hardship. Most genocide\r\nsurvivors, particularly orphans, widows and victims of\r\nsexual violence, are poorer and more vulnerable today\r\nthan they were 10 years ago. In particular, the\r\nAssembly should note the plight of thousands of\r\nwomen who contracted HIV as a result of being raped\r\nduring the genocide. While the people who either raped\r\nthem or gave the orders for them to be raped receive\r\ncare and treatment at the detention facility in Arusha,\r\nthe victims have received no such care, and as a result\r\nmany have since died of AIDS. We urge the Assembly\r\nto recognize the seriousness of the condition of such\r\npeople and to support a draft resolution to assist the\r\nsurvivors of the Rwanda genocide, which will be\r\nintroduced in plenary meeting during this session by\r\nthe representative of Nigeria on behalf of the States\r\nmembers of the African Union.\r\nMs. Katungye (Uganda): As we collectively\r\nreflect upon the ninth annual report of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the eleventh\r\nreport of the International Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia (ICTY), eloquently introduced by the\r\nrespective Presidents of the Tribunals, it is incumbent\r\nupon us to take stock of the steps the international\r\ncommunity has taken to redress the grave mistakes that\r\nenabled such horrific tragedies to happen in the first\r\nplace. In so doing, we must evaluate both the successes\r\nand the failures of the two International Tribunals as\r\nholistically and frankly as possible. To do any less\r\nwould be to dishonour the memory of the victims of\r\ngenocide and other grave crimes against humanity.\r\nWe would like to express our sincere condolences\r\non the passing of Judge Richard May, whose invaluable\r\ncontribution to the work of the Tribunal and other\r\nbodies lives on.\r\nThe role of international tribunals in the field of\r\ninternational criminal justice is a vital one. It behoves\r\nus to strengthen that role in the context  and in the\r\ninterests  of international peace and justice, both of\r\nwhich are prerequisites for stable communities and for\r\ndevelopment. Moreover, the records obtained from the\r\ntribunals are an invaluable resource that should be used\r\nto forge healing and reconciliation among the peoples\r\nof Rwanda, the Balkans and affected neighbouring\r\ncountries. They also contribute significantly to the rule\r\nof law and justice globally.\r\nI shall refer first to the ninth report of the\r\nRwanda Tribunal. Last year in the Security Council we\r\nheard about how the Tribunal for Rwanda was plagued\r\nby lack of sufficient funding, inadequate staff and trials\r\nthat were unduly delayed, to the chagrin and\r\nconsternation of the victims and their families, as well\r\nas of the international community.\r\nHaving noted the negative impact that insufficient\r\nfunding and staffing has caused in the past, we believe\r\nthat the fact that the Controller had to freeze\r\nrecruitment of new staff in the period under review\r\nrepresents a setback.\r\nFailure by Member States to pay their\r\ncontributions to the Tribunal is not new and may be the\r\nresult of a genuine inability to do so on the part of the\r\naffected States, especially those facing development\r\nchallenges. The Tribunal must not be allowed to suffer\r\nas a result of that inadequacy. New and creative ways\r\ncould, perhaps, be found to meet those needs. We\r\ncannot overemphasize the need to provide the Tribunal\r\nwith sufficient resources to allow it complete its cases\r\nwithin the allotted time frame.\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\nThe report also refers, in paragraph 68, to eight\r\ndefence counsel being withdrawn for reasons\r\nconstituting exceptional circumstances. Perhaps, in\r\nthe spirit of transparency and to help us to draw\r\nimportant lessons therefrom, it might have been useful\r\nfor the report to expound on that further. Nonetheless,\r\nhaving heard this morning from President Erik Møse, it\r\nis clear that this situation needs urgent redress.\r\nOn a happier note, it is heartening to see that in\r\nthe same period  that is, from 1 July 2003 to 30 June\r\n2004  there has been significant progress in the\r\nhandling of cases, from new trials to trials in progress\r\nand completed cases, as reflected in the report.\r\nHowever, even as we laud this progress, we need\r\nto point out that the figure of 48 accused persons being\r\nheld accountable may appear less significant in a\r\nsituation where hundreds of thousands of innocent\r\nmen, women and children were brazenly killed. On the\r\nother hand, we, as the international community, must\r\ncommend the Security Council for its intervention to\r\nensure that by 2008 the Tribunal will have completed\r\nall its trials. To this end, we urge all States, which are\r\nrequired to do so, to arrest and transfer all the indictees\r\nand suspects who are still at large. Further, we need to\r\nassist the Prosecutor, Mr. Hassan B. Jallow, in his\r\nefforts to transfer the individuals identified by him for\r\ntrial in national jurisdictions. We also welcome his\r\nappointment of a Completion Strategy Monitoring\r\nCommittee and recognize the positive impact\r\nengendered by the very cooperative spirit existing\r\nbetween his Office and the Rwandan Government.\r\nYet another significant success of the Tribunal\r\nhas been the adoption of Security Council resolution\r\n1512 (2003), which allowed the use of additional ad\r\nlitem judges. The benefits are self-evident with the\r\ncommencement of new trial proceedings, which in turn\r\nhave resuscitated the hopes of the victims. This\r\nimpetus must be expanded, and we are glad that the\r\nTribunal is already in the process of doing so.\r\nThe Government and people of Rwanda have\r\ndemonstrated through their legal system, the Gacaca\r\ncourts, that they are capable of handling some of the\r\ngenocidaires within their national jurisdiction. We,\r\ntherefore, have no hesitation in recommending that\r\nthose persons found to have been medium- to low-level\r\nparticipants in the 1994 genocide be subjected to\r\nRwandas national jurisdiction. In addition, we urge\r\nthat the Rwandan Government be assisted, when\r\nnecessary, to strengthen their judicial system.\r\nWe have noted the appeal by the Tribunal for\r\nresources to enable it engage the services of uncertified\r\ntranslators, with a view to meeting the challenges\r\nposed by the increased need for translation during\r\ntrials. In our view, this is a fair request and should be\r\nanswered in the affirmative. It is also a reasonable\r\nrequest, as uncertified translators will not only be\r\ncheaper but also faster to hire. This will lead to\r\nspeedier trials, while adhering to the principles of\r\nnatural justice. Lack of adequate translation not only\r\ndetracts from the rights of the victims and defendants\r\nbut also slows down the implementation of justice.\r\nWe believe the Tribunal is cognizant of the need\r\nfor the Rwandan people to perceive that justice is\r\nindeed being meted out. We see this from the efforts of\r\nits External Relations and Strategic Planning Section to\r\nreach out, involve and regularly inform the Rwandan\r\npopulace of the trials as they develop and are\r\nconducted.\r\nLikewise, we would like to thank the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia (ICTY) for the tremendous strides it has\r\ntaken in overcoming the obstacles it has faced to\r\nachieve progress.\r\nWe need to address the appeals made by\r\nPresident Theodor Meron in his statement this\r\nmorning. Furthermore, we need to support the\r\nimportant reforms initiated by the ICTY, in conformity\r\nwith its commitment to the completion strategies and\r\nthe objective of conforming to the requirements of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1503 (2003) and 1534\r\n(2004).\r\nBoth the ICTR and the ICTY, together with the\r\nInternational Criminal Court and the Special Court for\r\nSierra Leone, are evidence that the international\r\ncommunity is determined to bring to justice the\r\nperpetrators of genocide, war crimes and grave crimes\r\nagainst humanity. Therefore, we think it all the more\r\nimportant to remember the old adage that an ounce of\r\nprevention is better than a pound of cure, and we have\r\nto put in place early warning systems that alert the\r\nworld about events that lead to such crimes. We can no\r\nlonger afford to sit on the fence in the wake of\r\ngenocide or other such grave crimes.\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.53\r\nFinally, it is apparent from the reviews that both\r\nTribunals have made visible improvements in the\r\nperiod under review and continue to seek partnerships\r\nwith interested countries and international\r\norganizations to improve even more. For this, they\r\nmust be congratulated.\r\nThe lesson to be drawn from all this is that never\r\nagain should the international community ignore the\r\ndevelopments of genocide while it is being carried out\r\nagainst a people. It is costly, not only in terms of\r\nhuman suffering and societal trauma, but also in terms\r\nof the time, money and resources spent on trying to\r\nrepair the damage. Moreover, only a fraction of the\r\ndamage can indeed be redressed, irrespective of our\r\nbest intentions and efforts.\r\nTrials can be very lengthy, and if the victims\r\nsense that they are being hampered, they will feel\r\ndoubly betrayed. The old adage that justice delayed is\r\njustice denied is very pertinent.\r\nIn conclusion, the recommendations made in both\r\nreports are quite modest and pertinent and should,\r\ntherefore, be addressed. In so doing, the victims will\r\nreceive some form of respite and healing, while the\r\nperpetrators are finally brought to account for their\r\nheinous crimes.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate for this meeting. May I take it,\r\ntherefore, that it is the wish of the General Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda items 50 and 51?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.40 p.m.\r\n"
