(Gabon)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Chowdhury\r\n(Bangladesh), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 49\r\nOceans and the law of the sea\r\n(a) Oceans and the law of the sea\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/59/62 and\r\nAdd.1, A/59/63, A/59/126)\r\nReport on the work of the United Nations\r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on\r\nOceans and the Law of the Sea at its fifth\r\nmeeting (A/59/122)\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.22)\r\n(b) Sustainable fisheries, including through the\r\n1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the\r\nProvisions of the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982\r\nrelating to the Conservation and Management\r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory\r\nFish Stocks, and related instruments\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/59/298)\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.23)\r\nThe Acting President: Before proceeding\r\nfurther, I should like to inform members that this\r\nmorning’s meeting will be adjourned at 12.45 p.m.\r\nImmediately thereafter, there will be an informal\r\nsegment to hear statements by the representatives of\r\ntwo non-governmental organizations, namely\r\nGreenpeace International and the Natural Resources\r\nDefense Council. Members are invited to remain for\r\nthis segment.\r\nI now give the floor to the representative of\r\nBrazil to introduce draft resolution A/59/L.22.\r\nMr. Dos Santos (Brazil): I have the honour to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/59/L.22, entitled “Oceans\r\nand the law of the sea”, under item 49 (a) of the\r\nagenda. The other draft resolution, which is under item\r\n49 (b) on sustainable fisheries, will be introduced by\r\nthe representative of the United States.\r\nSince the publication of the draft resolution, the\r\nfollowing countries have become sponsors: Austria,\r\nBelgium, Brazil, Canada, Cyprus, Czech Republic,\r\nDenmark, Fiji, Finland, France, Greece, Honduras,\r\nHungary, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Malta, Marshall\r\nIslands, Mexico, the Federated States of Micronesia,\r\nMonaco, Namibia, the Netherlands, New Zealand,\r\nNorway, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sri\r\nLanka, Sweden, Trinidad and Tobago, the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the\r\nUnited States of America.\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nThe draft resolution is the result of a substantial\r\nseries of open-ended consultations among delegations.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to express my appreciation\r\nto all delegations for their active participation and\r\nconstructive spirit. I wish to thank, in particular, Mr.\r\nMarcos de Almeida of Brazil and Ms. Jennifer McIver\r\nof New Zealand for acting as coordinator and vice-\r\ncoordinator, respectively, of the informal consultations\r\non this draft resolution, and\r\nMs. Holly Koehler of the United States for the\r\ncoordination of the fisheries draft resolution. I also\r\nexpress my gratitude to the Director, Mr. Vladimir\r\nGolitsyn, and the staff of the Division for Ocean\r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea for their highly\r\nprofessional assistance, which, as usual, contributed\r\ndecisively to the success of our work.\r\nThe draft resolutions and today’s debate are\r\nexpressions of the General Assembly’s commitment to\r\nissues relating to oceans and the law of the sea,\r\nespecially as we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the\r\nentry into force of the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which represents a\r\nmonument to international cooperation in the history of\r\nthe treaty-making process.\r\nThe importance of the Convention is firmly\r\nexpressed in draft resolution A/59/L.22, which refers to\r\nthe legal framework, the maintenance and\r\nstrengthening of international peace and security and\r\nthe sustainable development of uses of and activities\r\nrelated to the oceans and seas. In that regard, several\r\nparagraphs are repeated from previous resolutions\r\nbecause they reaffirm our continuing needs.\r\nThe draft also reflects the importance of capacity-\r\nbuilding for developing States, so that they can\r\nimplement the Convention, fulfil their obligations and\r\nbenefit from ocean resources, as well as participate in\r\nall forums and processes dealing with issues related to\r\nthe oceans and the law of the sea.\r\nWith the examination of information on the outer\r\nlimits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical\r\nmiles, submitted by Brazil on 17 May 2004, the work\r\nof the Commission on the Limits of the Continental\r\nShelf has increased, and several States have advised of\r\ntheir intentions to make submissions in the near future.\r\nThose facts have given rise to some concern regarding\r\nthe need to improve the capacity of the Commission to\r\nhave concomitant meetings of several subcommissions.\r\nThis has been expressed in the draft resolution by the\r\nrequest to the Secretary-General to submit proposals to\r\nthe next session of the General Assembly on how to\r\naccommodate the requirements of the Commission.\r\nAs in previous years, the draft resolution also\r\ncovers a wide array of issues directly relevant to the\r\nsustainable development of the oceans and seas. It\r\nrequests the Secretary-General to report to the sixty-\r\nfirst session of the General Assembly on the role of the\r\n“genuine link” in relation to the duty of flag States to\r\nexercise effective control over ships flying their flag\r\nand the potential consequences of non-compliance with\r\nduties and obligations of flag States, as described in\r\nrelevant international instruments.\r\nThe draft also covers questions of piracy and\r\narmed robbery at sea, marine pollution, the smuggling\r\nof migrants, marine science, regional cooperation and\r\ninter-agency coordination and cooperation. It\r\nwelcomes the adoption or entry into force of new\r\nconventions and protocols relating to the law of the sea\r\nand highlights the work of the International Seabed\r\nAuthority, the International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea, the International Maritime Organization, the\r\nConference of Parties to the Convention on Biological\r\nDiversity, the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme, the International Labour Organization and\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency.\r\nThe draft resolution decides to establish an ad\r\nhoc open-ended informal working group to study issues\r\nrelating to the conservation and sustainable use of\r\nmarine biological diversity beyond areas of national\r\njurisdiction and decides to convene a second\r\ninternational workshop on the regular process for\r\nglobal reporting and assessment of the state of the\r\nmarine environment, including socio-economic\r\naspects.\r\nOn the United Nations Open-ended Informal\r\nConsultative Process, the draft resolution recalls the\r\ndecision to review the effectiveness and utility of the\r\nConsultative Process at the Assembly’s sixtieth session\r\nand recommends that the Consultative Process\r\norganize discussions around fisheries and its\r\ncontribution to sustainable development, marine debris\r\nand other issues discussed at previous meetings.\r\nSir, allow me now to make a few remarks on\r\nbehalf of my country. Brazil has always been an active\r\nand enthusiastic supporter of the Convention and of\r\nefforts to put its provisions into practice. The\r\nConvention is also known as the constitution of the\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\noceans, and it is becoming part of the consuetudinary\r\nlaw, without yet having achieved universal status.\r\nNonetheless, the implementation of the\r\nConvention faces obstacles, in particular for the\r\ndeveloping States because of their need for capacity-\r\nbuilding in a wide range of interrelated matters and the\r\nneed to improve marine science. In that respect, the\r\nestablishment of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal\r\nWorking Group will play a fundamental role in\r\nbringing us the actual knowledge regarding the\r\nmultiple uses of deep sea biodiversity, the richness of\r\nwhich is restricted to those who have advanced\r\ntechnology to explore its usefulness, for example in the\r\nareas of health and food improvement.\r\nBrazil considers that the Second International\r\nWorkshop on the Global Marine Assessment will be\r\ndecisive in establishing the process recommended by\r\nthe Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. We expect\r\nthat its work will be fruitful, and States must bear in\r\nmind the need to integrate and coordinate efforts on the\r\nconservation of the oceans.\r\nBrazil also recognizes the usefulness of the\r\ninformal Consultative Process in helping the General\r\nAssembly to understand broad, complex and\r\nmultifaceted issues. Taking into account the review of\r\nits effectiveness at the next session, Brazil considers\r\nthat the informal Consultative Process must be more\r\neducative and illustrative, rather than act as a forum for\r\ndiscussing issues and making recommendations to the\r\nAssembly.\r\nFinally, the choice of the areas of focus for next\r\nyear’s informal Consultative Process is timely in view\r\nof the 2005 review of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, particularly the topic of “Fisheries and its\r\ncontribution to sustainable development”. The topics\r\nchosen reflect once more the need to link cross-cutting\r\nissues such as capacity-building, regional cooperation\r\nand integrated ocean management through existing\r\nprogrammes and institutions. How best to enhance\r\nthose linkages in a manner consistent with the\r\nobjectives of the Convention is the fundamental reason\r\nfor setting up the informal Consultative Process.\r\nNow that we have highlighted the achievements\r\nand current challenges concerning ocean issues, let us\r\ntake this occasion, on the tenth anniversary of the entry\r\ninto force of the Convention, to reaffirm the\r\ncommitment of our countries and of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole to the task and vision we set out\r\nfor ourselves in 1982 when the Convention was\r\nconcluded.\r\nMr. Hamburger (Netherlands): I have the\r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union and\r\nthe European Community as a party to the Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea. The candidate countries\r\nBulgaria, Romania and Croatia, the countries of the\r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential\r\ncandidates Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and\r\nMontenegro align themselves with this statement.\r\nToday we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the\r\nentry into force of the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). For the European\r\nUnion (EU), the ratification today by another EU\r\nmember State, Denmark, adds a special touch to the\r\ncelebration.\r\nThe Convention and its implementing Agreement\r\nare a milestone in the world’s efforts to manage the\r\nworld’s oceans. Looking back at the achievements of\r\nthe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the\r\nSea, we must agree not only that a wide variety of\r\nissues was dealt with in the Convention, but also that\r\nthe text of the Convention has proved to be flexible\r\nenough to deal with problems that have arisen since its\r\nconclusion. It is worth mentioning that in many\r\nrespects the provisions of the Convention have\r\nacquired the status of international customary law.\r\nNineteen ninety four saw the conclusion of the\r\nAgreement, which greatly facilitated the entry into\r\nforce of the Convention for many States. The two\r\nintegrated instruments have proved to be a remarkably\r\nuseful tool for the governance of oceans. Indeed, we\r\nbelieve that those instruments will serve us all well in\r\nthe future and that there is no need to reconsider any of\r\ntheir provisions at this stage.\r\nEven though many States have already expressed\r\nconsent to be bound, we believe that we must continue\r\nto strive for universality. We call on all those States\r\nthat have not yet done so to become parties to the\r\nConvention and the implementing Agreement as soon\r\nas possible.\r\nWe regret that many seafarers still face dangers\r\nrelated not only to the safety of ships or the situation at\r\nsea itself, but also to the prevalent dangers of piracy\r\nand armed robbery at sea. The European Union notes\r\nwith great concern that criminal activities still threaten\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nshipping and imply danger for the seafarers, as well as\r\nfinancial losses for the operators of commercial\r\nshipping vessels. It is imperative that all States do their\r\nutmost to prevent piracy and armed robbery at sea. In\r\nparticular, there is a responsibility of States to prevent\r\nsuch acts from occurring in maritime areas under their\r\njurisdiction or from ships flying their flag. We\r\ncommend the efforts being made in this respect by the\r\nInternational Maritime Organization (IMO), as well as\r\nthose by a number of regional cooperative\r\nprogrammes.\r\nAll States, especially coastal States to straits used\r\nfor international navigation, should respect the right of\r\ninnocent passage through such straits for every vessel.\r\nFurthermore, port States should do their utmost not to\r\nhinder access to ports, thus respecting the freedom of\r\nmaritime trade and the freedom of transit between\r\nports, irrespective of flag.\r\nOn the issue of security and safety at sea, we\r\nwould like to highlight the importance of addressing\r\nthe issue of the transport by sea of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. We recall the importance of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1540 (2004) on the prevention of\r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and\r\nwe reiterate the support expressed by the European\r\nUnion for the Proliferation Security Initiative. This\r\nimportant Initiative includes a willingness to cooperate\r\non preventing the transport of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction by sea.\r\nSimilarly, the revision of the IMO Convention for\r\nthe Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of\r\nMaritime Navigation and its Protocol on fixed\r\nplatforms located on the continental shelf should be\r\nnoted. In these ongoing negotiations, important\r\nprovisions are to be added to the existing instrument,\r\nenhancing efforts against terrorism, as well as\r\nproviding for the penalization of the transport of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, dual-use goods and\r\ndelivery systems, by providing clear and mutually\r\nagreed rules on boarding ships on the high seas. The\r\nEuropean Union considers that an important aspect of\r\nthose amendments is that they will provide a clear and\r\nagreed legal framework for intervening with shipping\r\nwhen well-founded suspicions of the shipment of\r\nweapons of mass destruction arise.\r\nBy 2025, more than 75 per cent of the total world\r\npopulation is expected to be living on the coast, highly\r\ndependent on the sea and its resources. We have an\r\nobligation to ensure the viability of the ocean’s\r\nenvironment, which is deteriorating at an alarming rate\r\ndue to the over-utilization of marine resources,\r\npollution and climate change. This will be a particular\r\nchallenge for the twenty-first century. Proper ocean\r\ngovernance requires action that is forward-looking and\r\nbased on the precautionary principle, rather than\r\nmerely reactive to the problems of the day. As\r\ntechnology and science progress, we face new\r\nchallenges regarding how best to protect the oceans\r\nagainst destructive practices.\r\nThe European Union attaches great importance to\r\nensuring the protection of the marine biodiversity of\r\nthe oceans, in areas under the responsibility of coastal\r\nStates, as well as in those beyond the limits of national\r\njurisdiction. In our region, this important work is\r\nalready being undertaken within regional sea\r\nconventions and programmes, such as the Helsinki\r\nCommission (HELCOM) for the Baltic Sea, the\r\nBarcelona Convention for the Mediterranean sea, the\r\nOSPAR Convention for the North-East Atlantic, and\r\nthe Black Sea Convention. With respect to the\r\nmaritime areas under the responsibility of the States\r\nmembers of the European Union, the European\r\nCommission is developing a strategy for the protection\r\nof the marine environment. This strategy will be\r\nfinalized in 2005. We would also like to highlight the\r\nfact that pollution accidents at sea, which have caused\r\nserious damage within the European Union, have\r\naccelerated the need for measures to protect sensitive\r\ncoastal areas within the European Union.\r\nWhile the Convention on the Law of the Sea sets\r\nout a global regulatory framework for areas under\r\nnational jurisdiction and the high seas, the situation is\r\nless clear with respect to the protection of the\r\nbiodiversity of the high seas and the Area. The\r\nEuropean Union recognizes the need to regulate\r\npractices, including bottom trawling, which may be a\r\nthreat to deep-sea marine biodiversity and to\r\nvulnerable marine ecosystems. The legal framework\r\nand the implementation of measures to protect\r\nbiodiversity beyond the limits of national jurisdiction\r\nneed to be improved and addressed urgently by the\r\ninternational community. At this time, not enough is\r\nknown about the marine environment in these areas, in\r\nparticular the ecosystems of the deep sea. This\r\nstrengthens the need to apply the precautionary\r\nprinciple in all activities carried out in deep-sea areas.\r\nThus we should strengthen our resolve to act only with\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nthe greatest care in such areas by giving full effect to\r\nthe provisions of the Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\nand other international conventions, such as the\r\nConvention on Biological Diversity.\r\nThe European Union believes that there is a need\r\nto begin a process aimed at addressing this matter.\r\nSuch a process should take into account the relevant\r\nprovisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity\r\nand the decisions of the Seventh Meeting of the\r\nConference of the Parties to that Convention. That\r\nmust be done in a manner that gives effect to the\r\nConvention of the Law of the Sea and other relevant\r\ninstruments, building on the conclusions of the joint\r\nPlan of the Johannesburg conference, as well as on\r\nother related instruments. We note the decision in the\r\ndraft resolution before us on oceans and the law of the\r\nsea to establish an ad hoc open-ended working group to\r\nstudy issues relating to conservation and the\r\nsustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond\r\nthe areas of national jurisdiction, and we look forward\r\nto participating in its work. The European Union also\r\nwelcomes the steps that the General Assembly has\r\nproposed in this year’s annual fisheries and oceans\r\ndiscussions, which called on States and regional\r\nfisheries management bodies to protect vulnerable\r\nmarine ecosystems from destructive practices —\r\nprotection to which concerted international action on\r\nillegal, unregulated and unreported fishing will also\r\ncontribute.\r\nMany discussions on the governance of oceans\r\nhave taken place in the Open-ended Informal\r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the\r\nSea. This year we participated in the fifth meeting, and\r\nduring the next meeting in 2005 a decision will have to\r\nbe prepared for as to whether the General Assembly\r\nwould like to continue this process for a further three\r\nyears. The European Union could support, in principle,\r\nthe continuation of the United Nations Open-ended\r\nInformal Consultative Process. However, while we\r\nhave learned a lot about a great many issues related to\r\nthe governance of oceans, we recognize that there is\r\nroom for improvement and that a detailed and\r\nindependent evaluation of the quality and practical\r\nresults of the process should take place before a\r\ndecision is taken on the modalities of its possible\r\ncontinuation.\r\nIt is important to establish whether this process\r\nhas, in fact, led to a better understanding of the\r\nmanagement of the oceans and to a better and more\r\ncoherent approach of ocean issues by States and\r\nrelevant international organizations.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating our\r\nappreciation for the annual report on oceans and the\r\nlaw of the sea produced by the Secretariat. It provides\r\na wealth of information and presents an almost\r\nexhaustive compilation of relevant developments. I\r\nwould also like to reiterate that the European Union\r\nconsiders the General Assembly to be the place to\r\ndiscuss the report, as this is the most inclusive forum\r\nfor discussion of such matters.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear a statement by The Honourable Kjell Magne\r\nBondevik, Prime Minister of Norway.\r\nThe Honourable Kjell Magne Bondevik, Prime\r\nMinister of Norway, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Kjell Magne Bondevik,\r\nPrime Minister of Norway. I invite him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Bondevik (Norway): The United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea has rightly been\r\nlabelled the constitution of the oceans. As we celebrate\r\ntoday the tenth anniversary of its coming into force, we\r\nreaffirm its fundamental importance as the undisputed\r\noverarching legal framework for all peaceful uses of\r\nthe seas and oceans. Our challenge lies in ensuring full\r\nimplementation of the Convention, through loyal\r\nimplementation of our obligations and effective\r\nutilization of the possibilities its provisions prescribe.\r\nI will focus on three main topics: first, the\r\ncontribution of the Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\nto the international legal order and international peace\r\nand security; secondly, environmental challenges; and\r\nthirdly, measures to secure the sustainable management\r\nof our living marine resources.\r\nThe Convention promotes international peace and\r\nsecurity by establishing clarity and predictability with\r\nrespect to all activities in the oceans. The instrument\r\ndefines the limits of territorial waters, national zones\r\nand the continental shelf. It also guarantees the\r\nfreedom of navigation beyond the territorial sea and\r\nthe right of passage through the territorial sea,\r\ninternational straits and archipelagic waters. The\r\nConvention carefully balances a number of interests\r\nand thus fosters friendly relations and cooperation\r\namong all nations. That balance constitutes the basis\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nfor the rule of law on the oceans and is a key\r\ncontribution to the international legal order.\r\nWhile the rules and principles of the Convention\r\nprovide a stable legal framework, our security\r\nchallenges change. Piracy and armed robbery at sea are\r\nincreasing. Proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and, in particular, the danger of such\r\nweapons coming into the hands of terrorists, are a\r\nmajor threat to international peace and security, and\r\nsuch proliferation by sea is unfortunately a real risk.\r\nUnder Security Council resolution 1540 (2004),\r\nall nations are obliged to prevent proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. Nations must cooperate\r\nto that end, thus we welcome the efforts made within\r\nthe International Maritime Organization (IMO). Of\r\nparticular importance are the recent amendments to the\r\nInternational Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea\r\nand the ongoing process to substantially strengthen the\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts\r\nagainst the Safety of Maritime Navigation.\r\nFurthermore, Norway is an active participant in the\r\nProliferation Security Initiative aimed at strengthening\r\nour national and collective ability to prevent and stop\r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nAs a major shipping nation, we are deeply\r\nconcerned about the increase in piracy and armed\r\nrobbery at sea in certain parts of the world. In addition\r\nto support for multilateral efforts against that\r\nincreasing challenge, we are actively engaged in\r\nbilateral cooperation with other nations. And in all our\r\nefforts to counter piracy, terrorism, and proliferation of\r\nsuch weapons at sea, the Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea serves as the basic legal framework for developing\r\nnew initiatives.\r\nShipping carries more than 90 per cent of world\r\ntrade. It is the most energy-efficient and ecologically\r\nsound mode of freight transportation. Preserving\r\nworkable conditions for commercial shipping must,\r\ntherefore, be a priority to us all. Shipping interests\r\nmust, however, always be weighed against\r\nenvironmental considerations and the legitimate\r\ninterests of the coastal populations of the world.\r\nWe have seen several environmental catastrophes\r\ncaused by shipping accidents over the last years. This\r\nclearly illustrates the need for measures to further\r\nprotect the environment. In that regard, we welcome\r\nthe new IMO measures to prevent oil pollution from\r\nvessels, including the decision to speed up the phasing\r\nout of single hull tankers. Shipping security is\r\ninextricably linked to the obligation of flag States to\r\nfully shoulder their responsibilities, which cannot be\r\neffectively discharged without a genuine link between\r\nthe flag State and the ships flying its flag.\r\nI urge all flag States to comply with their\r\nobligations under international law to make sure that\r\ntheir ships meet international security standards. States\r\nwithout an effective maritime administration and an\r\nappropriate domestic legal framework must refrain\r\nfrom operating shipping registries.\r\nStates have a general responsibility to protect and\r\npreserve the marine environment and living resources\r\nin all ocean areas. How best to carry out that\r\nresponsibility has increasingly been debated. The IMO\r\nhas discussed the establishment of Particularly\r\nSensitive Sea Areas, while marine protected areas have\r\nbeen debated within the framework of the Convention\r\non Biological Diversity. Some have argued that we\r\nneed a revision of the Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea itself to clarify and strengthen our environmental\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nI believe that we are best served by adopting a\r\nfocused, practical and targeted approach in order to\r\naddress the problems at hand within the existing legal\r\nframework. When a problem is identified, specific\r\nmeasures to deal with it effectively should be adopted\r\nby the relevant international body or the national\r\nauthority concerned. In line with that approach,\r\nNorway is actively working to prevent the destructive\r\npractice of bottom trawling in vulnerable areas. Within\r\nour 200-mile zone, protected areas have been\r\nestablished. These include areas within our economic\r\nzone where bottom trawling is prohibited.\r\nI welcome last week’s decision by the North-East\r\nAtlantic Fisheries Commission to ban all trawling in\r\nfour areas, within its regulatory area, in accordance\r\nwith Norwegian proposals. In other vulnerable high\r\nseas areas the relevant regional fisheries management\r\narrangements should also engage actively in order to\r\nprevent harmful bottom trawling. Where such\r\ncompetent bodies do not exist, I would urge coastal\r\nStates to work together in order to establish them as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\nBased on the close cooperation of the States with\r\nthe best local knowledge, such regional arrangements\r\nare the best tools for ensuring the sustainable\r\nmanagement of marine living resources and preventing\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\ndestructive practices. These arrangements also have a\r\nkey role to play in preserving marine biodiversity in\r\ngeneral.\r\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the\r\nUnited Nations (FAO) reports that the global situation\r\nof marine fish stocks continues to deteriorate. That\r\nbroad statement does not apply to all stocks in all\r\nwaters and zones, but overall it gives reason for\r\nincreasing concern. We must prevent any further\r\ndepletion of living marine resources through\r\nsustainable resource management and the fight against\r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\r\nThe Convention recognizes the responsibility of\r\ncoastal States for the sustainable management of living\r\nresources in their maritime zones. Through the 1995\r\nFish Stocks Agreement, States are obliged to cooperate\r\nin the management of straddling and highly migratory\r\nfish stocks. In discharging those responsibilities, the\r\ncoastal States and regional arrangements are afforded\r\nbroad discretion in choosing the most appropriate\r\nmanagement measures. A lack of complete scientific\r\ndata can never serve as an excuse for failing to\r\nimplement responsible management measures.\r\nOur resource management efforts must be\r\ncomprehensive and ecosystem-based in order to match\r\nthe complexity of nature. In line with this thinking, my\r\nGovernment is now working on a comprehensive\r\nmanagement plan for the Norwegian part of the\r\nBarents Sea. That plan, which will guide our activities\r\nand the measures we take for the next 15 years, will\r\nencompass aspects relevant not only to resource\r\nmanagement, but to the marine environment as a\r\nwhole.\r\nHowever responsible and precautionary the\r\ncoastal States and the regional management\r\narrangements might be in their management, their full\r\npurpose will not be served as long as we are struggling\r\nwith illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\r\nSignificantly, the Secretary-General states in his report\r\non sustainable fisheries that illegal, unreported and\r\nunregulated fishing in all its forms presents a major\r\nobstacle to achieving sustainable fisheries both in areas\r\nunder national jurisdiction and on the high seas.\r\nCurbing such fishing is therefore among the most\r\nimportant measures we can take to protect marine\r\nresources. Obviously, a huge responsibility here rests\r\nwith the flag State. Unfortunately, some States allow\r\nvessels to fly their flag without ensuring that their\r\nfishing practices are legal and sound.\r\nInternational instruments such as the 1995 Fish\r\nStocks Agreement and the 1993 FAO Compliance\r\nAgreement are essential. Regrettably, the number of\r\nratifications is still much too low. In other words, there\r\nseems to be a lack of political will to deal effectively\r\nwith this problem. I appeal to all States to make sure\r\nthat vessels flying their flag do not engage in illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated fishing.\r\nIn my statement, I have repeatedly referred to\r\ncommon obligations and shared responsibilities. We\r\nshare the responsibility to fully implement the\r\nConvention and achieve its full potential. There are,\r\nhowever, differences between the States parties’\r\nabilities to implement the various provisions and to\r\ntake advantage of the possibilities provided by the\r\nConvention. Norway therefore notes with satisfaction\r\nthe widespread consensus that capacity-building is a\r\nmain challenge in relation to the law of the sea. As part\r\nof our development aid programmes, we will continue\r\nto make funds and expertise available to those States\r\nthat need such support.\r\nIn closing, let me state that it has been a pleasure\r\nto address law of the sea issues on the day of the tenth\r\nanniversary of the coming into force of the\r\nConvention. It has been a particular pleasure to do this\r\nbefore the General Assembly — the universal forum\r\nfor taking stock of broader developments of law of the\r\nsea and ocean affairs and setting out our collective\r\npriorities.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of\r\nNorway for the statement he has just made.\r\nThe Honourable Kjell Magne Bondevik was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nMr. Hackett (Barbados): I have the honour to\r\nmake this statement on behalf of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nToday, the international community is rightly\r\ngiving due recognition to the tenth anniversary of the\r\nentry into force of the 1982 United Nations Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea. CARICOM delegations are\r\nproud to note that, of the 145 parties to the Convention,\r\nall CARICOM Governments are parties to this\r\nmultilateral treaty, negotiated painstakingly over many\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nyears and which lays down widely accepted\r\nfundamental rules of international law governing all\r\nuses of ocean space.\r\nSeveral States have, however, not yet become\r\nparties to the Convention. We would, accordingly, urge\r\nthem to give this matter further positive consideration,\r\nwith a view to achieving universal adherence to the\r\nConvention in the shortest possible time, as a tribute to\r\nthe many negotiators from all regions who played such\r\npivotal roles in shaping several of its key substantive\r\nprovisions.\r\nCARICOM delegations wish to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his very comprehensive report\r\nunder this agenda item. We wish also to commend the\r\nDirector of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law\r\nof the Sea, Mr. Golitsyn, and his dedicated staff for the\r\nvery proficient manner in which they continue to\r\ndischarge their responsibilities, especially in light of\r\nthe ever-increasing areas that are the focus of\r\ndelegations’ attention. We are encouraged by the fact\r\nthat, in the 10 years since its entry into force, the\r\nConvention has, to a large extent, shaped national\r\npolicies, practices and legislation on ocean affairs,\r\nparticularly with reference to its maritime\r\njurisdictional aspects. In addition, State practice with\r\nrespect to maritime zones has shown strong adherence\r\nto the principles and rules established by its provisions.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General notes, inter\r\nalia, that, while more than 40 treaties and protocols to\r\ntreaties on the delimitation of maritime boundaries\r\nhave been concluded since November 1994, a number\r\nof unresolved issues related to sovereignty over land or\r\nisland territory, overlapping and extensive maritime\r\nclaims and the particular geographical predicaments of\r\ncertain countries continue to encumber relations\r\nbetween States with opposite and adjacent coasts. We\r\nencourage States to settle their disputes in that regard\r\nby peaceful means, including those set out in the\r\nConvention and in accordance with international law.\r\nIn the Caribbean region, two separate arbitration\r\nproceedings are currently under way with a view to\r\nsettling amicably and definitively, by referral to\r\narbitral tribunals constituted under the Convention, the\r\nrespective maritime boundaries of the States\r\nconcerned. In addition, other States of the region are\r\nengaged in bilateral negotiations with a view to\r\nconcluding delimitation agreements.\r\nCARICOM delegations continue to be\r\nappreciative of the initiative of the Government of\r\nMexico regarding the Conference on Maritime\r\nDelimitation in the Caribbean, and they express their\r\nthanks to that Government for its generous financial\r\ncontributions of almost $100,000 over the past few\r\nyears to the trust fund for assistance to States\r\nparticipating in the Conference. Accordingly, we look\r\nforward to the convening of future meetings of the\r\nConference and to assistance from the trust fund, upon\r\nthe request of participating States, in order to contract\r\nthe necessary consultancy services.\r\nThe Secretary-General draws attention to a\r\nnumber of failings on the part of States parties during\r\nthese last 10 years: the proclamation of de facto\r\nexclusive economic zones under various other\r\ndesignations, thus creating confusion and uncertainty\r\nespecially as to the rights and obligations of other\r\nStates; the lack of harmonization of national legislation\r\nwith the provisions of the United Nations Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea; non-observance of the time-\r\nhonoured tradition of regular reporting to the United\r\nNations by coastal States of new legislation on\r\nmaritime zones; and failure to deposit with the\r\nSecretary-General, under the Convention, charts\r\nshowing straight baselines and archipelagic baselines,\r\nas well as the limits of the territorial sea, exclusive\r\neconomic zones and the continental shelf.\r\nCARICOM delegations therefore wish to urge\r\nStates parties to the Convention to ensure that\r\nmeasures taken in the areas identified by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral are in conformity with the Convention and that\r\nthe international community is made aware of any such\r\ninternational legal developments by transmitting such\r\ninformation to the Secretary-General for dissemination\r\nin accordance with his obligations as depositary.\r\nWe wish to reiterate our unconditional support for\r\nthe institutions established by the Convention, namely,\r\nthe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority and the Commission on\r\nthe Limits of the Continental Shelf. We commend them\r\non the highly effective manner in which they have been\r\ncarrying out the various responsibilities assigned to\r\nthem under the Convention since their establishment.\r\nFor example, the International Seabed Authority has\r\nentered into exploration contracts with all seven\r\npioneer investors in accordance with the regulations on\r\nprospecting and exploration for polymetallic nodules in\r\nthe area. It has made progress on developing rules,\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nregulations and procedures for the exploration of\r\npolymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese\r\ncrusts, and it has begun evaluation of available data\r\nand information related to the areas reserved for its\r\nfuture use.\r\nCARICOM delegations also wish to take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate Mr. Satya Nandan on his\r\nre-election to the post of Secretary-General of the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority for a further four-year\r\nterm in the recent elections, which were held under the\r\nTrinidad and Tobago presidency of the Authority’s\r\nAssembly. We pledge to him our continued full support\r\nin the discharge of his duties.\r\nThe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea,\r\nwhich has among its 21 judges two jurists from\r\nCARICOM countries — Judge Dolliver Nelson of\r\nGrenada, its current President, and Judge Anthony\r\nLucky of Trinidad and Tobago — has dealt over the\r\nlast eight years with a number of cases involving the\r\nprompt release of vessels and requests for provisional\r\nmeasures. We welcome the Tribunal’s contribution to\r\nthe development of the jurisprudence of the law of the\r\nsea in its few short years of its existence.\r\nThe Commission on the Limits of the Continental\r\nShelf, in addition to devising and consolidating its\r\nprocedures for the submission of claims, has addressed\r\nthe first request, submitted by the Russian Federation,\r\nand has now received its second submission, from\r\nBrazil. CARICOM delegations welcome the\r\nwillingness of the Commission to assist States, at their\r\nrequest, in the preparation of their submissions and\r\nother actions by the Division for Ocean Affairs and the\r\nLaw of the Sea aimed at building capacity among\r\ncoastal States. This will enable them to make, in a\r\ntimely manner, their own submissions in relation to the\r\nlimits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical\r\nmiles from the baselines from which the breadth of the\r\nterritorial sea is measured.\r\nTen years after the 1982 United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea entered into force,\r\nfurther actions are still required of States to give full\r\nforce and effect to the Convention’s provisions in their\r\nnational legislation. Perhaps it would be timely for\r\nGovernments to give consideration to establishing\r\noverarching national marine policies encompassing all\r\naspects of ocean affairs, in addition to developing\r\nnational mechanisms that can ensure the broadest\r\npossible coordination on all ocean-related matters at\r\nthe national level and in order to be in a better position\r\nto cooperate with other States.\r\nCARICOM delegations further note that an\r\nimportant development took place at the Fourteenth\r\nMeeting of States Parties to the Convention, held in\r\nNew York in June this year. Aside from addressing\r\nfinancial and administrative issues related to the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, it was\r\nagreed that the agenda for the Fifteenth Meeting of\r\nStates Parties should include a new item relating to the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General under the Convention’s\r\narticle 319. While there are other forums in which\r\nmatters concerning oceans and the law of the sea are\r\nconsidered, we believe that the meetings of States\r\nparties represent the logical forum for discussion of\r\nissues pertaining to implementation of the Convention.\r\nThe inclusion of that agenda item, we believe, will\r\nbroaden the work of the meetings of States parties\r\nbeyond their current focus on administrative and\r\nbudgetary matters. We look forward to the resumption\r\nof the report by the Secretary-General, in accordance\r\nwith his obligation under article 319.\r\nWe also wish to commend the Co-Chairpersons of\r\nthe United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea for their\r\nsuccessful conduct of the fifth meeting, held earlier\r\nthis year. Regarding the issue of new sustainable uses\r\nof the oceans, including the conservation and\r\nmanagement of the biological diversity of the seabed in\r\nareas beyond national jurisdiction, which was\r\ndiscussed at the last meeting, we are of the view that\r\nthe benefits to be derived from areas to which the\r\nprinciple of the common heritage of mankind applies\r\nmust be accessible to all mankind and not just limited\r\nto the commercial interests that seek to exploit its rich\r\nbiodiversity for profit.\r\nCARICOM delegations wish to highlight the need\r\nfor States and competent regional and international\r\norganizations to take all necessary measures to address\r\nthe risks to the biodiversity of vulnerable marine\r\necosystems, including in areas beyond national\r\njurisdiction posed by, inter alia, destructive fishing\r\npractices such as high seas bottom trawling. We look\r\nforward to the discussion at the sixth meeting of the\r\nConsultative Process of the topics identified in the\r\ndraft resolution, namely, “fisheries and its contribution\r\nto sustainable development” and “marine debris”, as\r\nwell as the review of issues discussed at previous\r\nmeetings.\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nWe support the proposal contained in draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.22 for the establishment of an open-\r\nended informal working group to study issues relating\r\nto the conservation and sustainable use of marine\r\nbiological diversity beyond areas of national\r\njurisdiction, and we look forward to the topical report\r\nof the Secretary-General on the important issues that\r\nthe working group will consider. With respect to\r\ninstitutional arrangements, CARICOM delegations\r\nwelcome the establishment of the Oceans and Coastal\r\nAreas Network, a new inter-agency mechanism for\r\ncoordination and cooperation on issues relating to\r\noceans and coastal issues within the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nCARICOM delegations would wish again to\r\nhighlight the importance that they attach to the security\r\nand environmental implications arising from the\r\nmaritime transportation of radioactive materials and\r\nthe corresponding lack of adequate liability and\r\ncompensation regimes. Due note has, however, been\r\ntaken of recent developments in this sphere within the\r\nframework of the International Atomic Energy Agency,\r\nand CARICOM delegations look forward to the\r\noutcome of the work of the Expert Group on\r\nInternational Nuclear Liability.\r\nWe would also like to draw attention to the draft\r\nresolution currently before the Assembly on promoting\r\nan integrated management approach to the Caribbean\r\nSea, pointing to its unique biodiversity and highly\r\nfragile ecosystem, as well as our concern regarding the\r\nintensive use of its waters for maritime transport. We\r\ntherefore seek the cooperation of the international\r\ncommunity in assisting Caribbean States in taking\r\nappropriate steps for the preservation and protection of\r\nthis most precious natural resource, which is vital to\r\nthe well-being of the countries of the region.\r\nCARICOM delegations wish to express our\r\nappreciation for the cooperation and assistance in the\r\nregion from international organizations, our bilateral\r\npartners and the specialized agencies of the United\r\nNations, such as the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme and the International Maritime\r\nOrganization. We look forward to continued\r\ncooperation with them in order to achieve our common\r\ngoals in this area.\r\nThe seas and oceans — man’s last frontier — and\r\nthe important role they play in mankind’s future must\r\nnever be underestimated. The proper management on a\r\nsustainable basis of the world’s seas and oceans and\r\ntheir resources, both living and non-living, is therefore\r\nvital to the economic and social well-being of present\r\nand future generations. Consequently, all of the issues\r\nrelated thereto must be addressed, we believe, in a\r\nholistic and harmonious manner by all States.\r\nThe Acting President: I am greatly pleased to\r\nwelcome Mr. Geoff Regan, Minister of Fisheries and\r\nOceans of Canada, whom I now invite to make a\r\nstatement.\r\nMr. Regan (Canada) (spoke in French):\r\nMr. President, I very pleased to join you on this\r\nimportant day, the tenth anniversary of the entry into\r\nforce of the law of the sea, for the adoption of the draft\r\nresolution on oceans and the law of the sea (A/59/L.22)\r\nand the draft resolution on sustainable fisheries\r\n(A/59/L.23).\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWhen Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin\r\naddressed this body in September, he laid out his views\r\non the challenges facing the United Nations and the\r\nreforms he saw as necessary to put our common\r\nhumanity at the centre of the United Nations agenda.\r\nHe suggested that it was our collective obligation to\r\nleave a better world for our children and that, in that\r\nregard, only international cooperation and technical\r\nassistance can bring lasting solutions. Furthermore, he\r\nunderscored the global need for an oceans policy that\r\nallows us to rebuild our fish stocks. To that end, he\r\nsaid, access to fisheries must be better regulated under\r\ninternational law. In the context of those remarks, I\r\nthink that we can all agree that today is a good day for\r\nthe United Nations and a good day for the oceans of\r\nthe world.\r\nWe are pleased that the provisions of the\r\nsustainable fisheries draft resolution recognize the need\r\nto combat destructive fishing practices in international\r\nwaters where sensitive ecosystems exist. Indeed,\r\npractices must be addressed, at the global and regional\r\nlevels, through effective international fisheries\r\ngovernance.\r\nThis draft resolution generally reflects Canadian\r\npractices in our domestic waters. In areas where highly\r\nsensitive marine ecosystems are known to exist and\r\nwhere there is scientific evidence that fishing practices\r\nare having a long-term adverse effect on the\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\necosystem, targeted action is taken to mitigate effects\r\nthrough the application of various management\r\nmeasures. This could include gear modifications,\r\nseasonal and area closures, or the establishment of\r\nmarine protected areas where long-term measures are\r\nrequired.\r\nCanada’s position is that no specific gear type is\r\ninherently destructive, depending on how it is used.\r\nFrom experience, we know that all gear types can have\r\nnegative impacts, which is why we need to work\r\ntogether on solutions. Consultations on management\r\npractices have been and will remain an integral part of\r\nCanadian decision-making. If we are to be effective,\r\nstakeholders need to be part of the solution.\r\nWe also welcome the decision set out in the draft\r\nresolution on oceans and the law of the sea (A/59/L.22)\r\nto establish an ad hoc working group to consider the\r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological\r\ndiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction. We\r\nbelieve this working group will be able to address\r\nissues such as destructive fishing practices.\r\nI am here today to share with you Canada’s views\r\nconcerning our collective responsibility to take on the\r\nproblem of irresponsible fishing actions on the high\r\nseas so we can stop the pillage of our global resource.\r\nThe oceans of the world have always fed and nurtured\r\nus. Our history of returning the favour has not been so\r\ngenerous. It was not until the latter part of the\r\ntwentieth century that we began to do serious damage.\r\nThe world has learned at its peril that just because\r\ntechnology allows us to fish faster and more efficiently,\r\nit does not mean that we have the wisdom to use that\r\ntechnology properly. The collective mismanagement of\r\nour oceans has had inevitable consequences.\r\nDespite the best will in the world and three\r\ndecades of international efforts, fish numbers remain\r\ndismally depressed. By Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates,\r\nmore than 70 per cent of the world’s fisheries are\r\ndepleted or nearly depleted. This is particularly\r\nworrisome when we consider that, according to the\r\nWorld Resources Institute, approximately one billion\r\npeople, mostly in developing countries, rely on fish as\r\ntheir primary animal protein source.\r\nWhether we are talking about cod in the North\r\nAtlantic, big-eye tuna in the Pacific, orange roughy on\r\nthe Indian Ocean, or Patagonian toothfish in the\r\nAntarctic, for all intents and purposes, far too many\r\nspecies are overexploited.\r\nIllegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, for\r\nexample, is estimated to represent about 30 per cent of\r\nthe world’s total catch. We cannot lose sight of the role\r\nthat fisheries subsidies have played in the ongoing\r\ndecline of many commercial species. Clearly,\r\nGovernment programmes that encourage excess fishing\r\ncapacity and overfishing must be eliminated. While\r\nmember countries of the World Trade Organization are\r\nnow working towards this goal, it is essential to\r\neliminate the economic incentives that encourage\r\noverfishing.\r\nCanada is a maritime nation bounded by three\r\noceans, with the world’s longest coastline. It will come\r\nas no surprise to you, then, when I say that our fishery\r\nhas always been a critical part of Canadian life and\r\ntradition, culturally, socially and economically. Many\r\nof our communities were founded on the wealth of this\r\nresource.\r\nFor centuries, the cod fishery was central to the\r\neconomy and culture of thousands of communities and\r\nthe livelihoods of tens of thousands of\r\nNewfoundlanders and Labradorians. The collapse of\r\nthe cod stocks in the nineties represented one of the\r\nmost tragic points in the history of that province, and\r\nfor all of Canada. Today, too many Canadians are\r\nseeing their livelihoods being put at greater risk. They\r\nhave an understandable impatience with a perceived\r\nlack of international action, which has led to much\r\nfrustration regarding their fishery. The imperative for\r\nreal action and results on ocean conservation issues in\r\nCanada — particularly the ecosystems of our\r\ncontinental shelf beyond 200 miles — has never been\r\ngreater.\r\nThe sad truth is that something is obviously not\r\nworking, and we all share in the responsibility to do\r\nsomething about it, within our respective jurisdictions\r\nand together, on regional and global fronts.\r\nOn the domestic front, we are taking action —\r\nbased on scientific evidence and the hard lessons that\r\nwe have learned.\r\nWe have started transforming our fisheries\r\ngovernance regimes. But fisheries are only a part of the\r\nbroader picture of oceans ecosystems. Our links to the\r\noceans are broad and the impact of our actions there is\r\ndiverse. To help understand and correct our\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nshortcomings, Canada established an Oceans Action\r\nPlan. Its goal is to revitalize our activities and\r\ninitiatives by basing decision-making processes on\r\nsound science, by focusing first and foremost on the\r\nhealth of marine ecosystems, and by using new oceans\r\ntechnologies wisely to halt our destructive practices.\r\nBut the fact is, no matter what efforts we make in\r\nour own jurisdictions, they will be fruitless unless\r\nmatched with cooperative actions at regional and\r\nglobal levels and with the necessary political will. For\r\necosystems know no administrative bounds. As\r\nresponsible managers we need to set aside our\r\njurisdictional constraints and manage oceans and the\r\nresources they harbour as a common property, one for\r\nwhich we are collectively responsible.\r\nThe Government of Canada recently made\r\nconsiderable investments to implement a new strategy\r\nto address overfishing. Our immediate and more\r\npressing focus was the Grand Banks of Newfoundland\r\nand Labrador, where, because of overfishing, species\r\ncurrently under moratoria faced commercial extinction\r\nwithin five years. We committed over $45 million to\r\nexpand our monitoring, control and surveillance of the\r\narea currently managed by the Northwest Atlantic\r\nFisheries Organization (NAFO) and to find cooperative\r\nways of addressing non-compliance and overfishing by\r\nworking more closely with our NAFO partners. These\r\nefforts have yielded positive results to date. We are\r\nseeing some improvements, although important\r\nchallenges remain. Our bilateral interventions,\r\nespecially those by Prime Minister Martin, have\r\nhighlighted how international the issue of overfishing\r\nis, and how significant support is for finding a global\r\nsolution to the problem.\r\nDuring the past 15 years, the international\r\ncommunity has developed a series of tools and\r\ninstruments to tackle this problem. Canada played a\r\nkey role in the development of some of them, like the\r\nUnited Nations Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks Agreement and the Convention\r\non Law of the Sea.\r\nBut while the world’s negotiators and diplomats\r\nhave been prolific in their endeavours, we decision\r\nmakers have been weak in our actions. It is now time\r\nto act, before it is too late.\r\nI have agreed to be part of the Ministerial High\r\nSeas Task Force with colleagues from Australia, Chile,\r\nNamibia and New Zealand, with the Minister of\r\nEnvironment for the United Kingdom as Chair. This\r\nTask Force will consider specific ways to expose\r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing\r\nactivity and combat this activity on a global level.\r\nOn a complementary track, Canada is initiating\r\nan international process to address global overfishing.\r\nHeads of State and leaders have given their support for\r\nmoving in this direction.\r\nCanada will launch this effort with an\r\ninternational conference on the governance of high\r\nseas fisheries from 1 to 5 May 2005 in St. John’s,\r\nNewfoundland and Labrador. The conference will\r\ndiscuss existing international fisheries governance and\r\nareas where there may be gaps and impediments for\r\nimplementation. Its key focus will be on the United\r\nNations Fish Stocks Agreement. I am pleased to invite\r\nthe fishing nations of the world to attend the St. John’s\r\nconference. For we need to move from words to action,\r\ntogether.\r\nOur vision is that the St. John’s conference will\r\nlaunch a process that results in global standards for an\r\neffective monitoring regime, including consistent\r\nsanctions for non-compliance. Obviously, the purpose\r\nin all of this is to revive and then operate sustainable\r\nand ecologically friendly fisheries the world over. That\r\nis a very tall order. Somehow we must develop a\r\nformula to benchmark standards that would lead us to\r\nconsistent successes. Otherwise, all our agreements are\r\nmere words on paper.\r\nPerhaps we can start by asking ourselves some\r\nquestions. Are we consistently adhering to our\r\ninternational obligations and commitments? Can we fill\r\nin the gaps with existing mechanisms or are new ones\r\nneeded? Do we have the scientific knowledge to\r\ninform decision-making about the management of\r\nocean resources and their ecosystems? Do we have\r\nsound information-sharing systems in place between\r\nStates and regional organizations?\r\nThe answers to such questions can help us\r\nestablish some of the benchmarking standards that we\r\nseek.\r\nIn the end, real progress means making difficult\r\nchoices. And this requires political courage. I\r\nacknowledge the complex nature of the enterprise.\r\nCompeting interests are made particularly sharp by the\r\nunequal levels of prosperity among nations, by\r\ntechnology outstripping capacity, by environmental\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nconcerns, and by international politics. The list may\r\nseem endless. But it must not deter us.\r\nCanada would not be so arrogant as to point\r\nfingers. All of us, in our frustration or sense of outrage,\r\noften want to point the finger of blame at someone\r\nelse. It is much better that we hold up a mirror.\r\nWe have in our hands the means, and I believe the\r\nwill, to do the right thing, for our children and our\r\nchildren’s children. It is clear that with today’s\r\nresolutions, and with the ongoing work of international\r\nbodies, we have begun to assemble the pieces of the\r\npuzzle. Our challenge now is to solve this puzzle, so\r\nthat our oceans are once again full of life.\r\nIf we fail, we will all be diminished, and not just\r\nin the loss of vital food sources. We will also be\r\ndiminished ethically, morally, and spiritually, in ways\r\nwe cannot yet calculate. None of us wants to be\r\nmarked down in the history books as the generation\r\nthat knew enough to act, that knew what had to be\r\ndone, yet failed nonetheless.\r\nI remain optimistic. I think we have the means to\r\nbe uplifted, so that in the years to come, our\r\ndescendants will say that humankind did learn from\r\npast mistakes, and did bring us back from the brink of\r\ndisaster, and that our oceans are, indeed, coming back\r\nto life.\r\nMr. Amayo (Kenya): Today, 10 years ago, the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\n(UNCLOS) entered into force. This anniversary\r\npresents an opportune time to reflect upon the\r\nachievements of the Convention over the past decade,\r\nas well as to explore its future direction and prospects.\r\nAt the outset, I wish to express my delegation’s\r\nappreciation to the Office of Legal Affairs and its\r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for\r\nthe comprehensive reports issued for this session.\r\nThese reports review developments over the past\r\ndecade and identify the main achievements and\r\nchallenges in the implementation of the Convention.\r\nMy delegation hopes that our efforts in the next decade\r\nfocus on addressing the myriad challenges that stand in\r\nthe way of implementation.\r\nThe Convention has been called the constitution\r\nof the seas, and with good reason. It is the primary\r\nsource of international law governing ocean affairs. At\r\npresent, there are 145 States parties to the Convention,\r\nand its principles are universally applicable. The three\r\nmain institutions established under the Convention\r\nhave made significant progress in their respective\r\nareas.\r\nThe Commission on the Limits of the Continental\r\nShelf continues to play a significant role in assisting\r\nStates in the preparation of submissions with respect to\r\nthe outer limits of the continental shelf. The revised\r\nrules of procedure were adopted in April 2004,\r\nsimplifying procedures for States wishing to prepare\r\nsubmissions. However, implementation of article 76 of\r\nthe Convention still poses a great challenge to many\r\nStates. We hope that the Commission’s continued focus\r\non technical assistance and capacity-building for States\r\nin the preparation of their submissions will help\r\nexpedite the submissions process. We urge that\r\nadequate resources be allocated to that vital function of\r\nthe Commission to help diversify programmes and\r\nmaximize the dissemination of expertise, particularly\r\nto developing coastal States.\r\nThe Government of Kenya has constituted an\r\ninter-ministerial technical committee to consider\r\ndelimitation of Kenya’s maritime zones. Issues under\r\nconsideration by that committee include the review of\r\nmaritime maps and charts deposited with the United\r\nNations prior to the adoption of the Convention,\r\nmodalities of delimiting maritime zones and a review\r\nof baselines. The committee is also considering a\r\ncomprehensive revision of Kenya’s maritime laws and\r\nother laws relating to exploration and exploitation of\r\nnatural and mineral resources within its maritime zones\r\nto ensure compliance with the Convention.\r\nA review of the work of the International Seabed\r\nAuthority (ISA) over the past decade shows significant\r\nprogress in administration and regulation of activities\r\nin the international seabed beyond national\r\njurisdiction. It has adopted a regulatory framework for\r\nprospecting and exploring for polymetallic modules,\r\nand work on the elaboration of similar regimes to\r\ngovern other resources in the seabed is under way. We\r\nencourage the Authority to continue collaborating with\r\ntechnical and scientific experts and institutions to\r\nensure a wider dissemination of marine scientific\r\nresearch.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that the Authority, in\r\nthe development of a regulatory regime for resources in\r\nthe area, gives due regard to the conservation and\r\nprotection of the marine environment and its rich\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nbiodiversity and to the need to ensure a balanced\r\ndistribution of the benefits of deep seabed resources.\r\nThe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea\r\n(ITLOS) plays an important role in the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes arising from the application and\r\ninterpretation of the Convention. The jurisprudence\r\nemanating from the Tribunal provides useful guidance\r\nto States in the management of maritime disputes. We\r\nurge adequate budgetary support to the Tribunal to\r\nfacilitate its smooth operation and effectiveness.\r\nIn 2002, the Assembly, upon the recommendation\r\nof the Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on\r\nOceans and the Law of the Sea, called for\r\nconsideration of ways to improve the management of\r\nrisks to maritime biodiversity. That was reiterated in\r\nresolution 58/240, which urged the protection of\r\nmaritime ecosystems and biodiversity in areas beyond\r\nnational jurisdiction. That was further reinforced by the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development’s Plan of\r\nImplementation and the seventh meeting of the\r\nConference of the Parties to the Convention on\r\nBiological Diversity, held in Kuala Lumpur in\r\nFebruary this year. It is evident that there is an urgent\r\nneed to increase focus on conservation and sustainable\r\nuse of biodiversity in marine areas beyond national\r\njurisdiction. That biodiversity constitutes a vast reserve\r\nof resources and organisms of significant economic,\r\nscientific and environmental value. A balance must be\r\nstruck between the need for economic exploitation and\r\nthe need for conservation.\r\nWe therefore urge that a working group be\r\nestablished to examine existing regimes in this area\r\nand to look into modalities for conservation and\r\nsustainable use of biodiversity and for the protection of\r\nvulnerable marine ecosystems.\r\nThe protection of the coastal and marine\r\nenvironment is of critical importance to Kenya. At the\r\nnational level, a comprehensive review of our maritime\r\nlaws is being undertaken to enhance protection\r\nmeasures and to ensure harmonization with\r\ninternational and regional instruments. At the regional\r\nlevel, Kenya participates in a number of initiatives,\r\nincluding the United Nations Environment Programme\r\nRegional Seas Programme and the activities\r\nundertaken under the auspices of the Nairobi\r\nConvention for the Protection, Management and\r\nDevelopment of the Marine and Coastal Environment\r\nof the Eastern African Region. We welcome the\r\noutcome of the Fifth Global Meeting of the Regional\r\nSeas, held in Nairobi from 25 to 27 November 2003,\r\nwhich culminated in the development of the regional\r\nseas strategic directions for 2004-2007. We further\r\nwelcome the launching of a project in July this year by\r\nthe Conference of States Parties to the Nairobi\r\nConvention to address the adverse effects of land-\r\nbased activities in the Western Indian Ocean region.\r\nThe 1995 Fish Stocks Agreement is critical for\r\nthe achievement of a sustainable global fisheries\r\nregime. In July 2004, Kenya acceded to that\r\nAgreement and is committed to its full implementation.\r\nWe urge States that are not yet parties to the\r\nAgreement to consider ratification and accession to the\r\nAgreement to ensure coordinated and cooperative\r\nefforts in the management of fisheries. It is through\r\nadherence to that Agreement and other related global\r\nand regional fisheries agreements that we will be able\r\nto attain our common goal of balancing the need to\r\ncontain the adverse effects of fishing on the marine\r\necosystem with the need to maintain fishing as a viable\r\neconomic activity.\r\nThe regional fisheries management organizations\r\nplay an important role in the implementation of the\r\n1995 Fish Stocks Agreement. We urge increased\r\nsupport and funding for those organizations to enhance\r\ntheir effectiveness. Initiatives in that regard should\r\nconcentrate on capacity-building for developing\r\ncountries to enable them to maximize their economic\r\npotential in their fisheries sectors, while at the same\r\ntime ensuring sustainability and conservation of marine\r\necosystems and biodiversity.\r\nThe Open-ended Informal Consultative Process\r\non Oceans and the Law of the Sea has proved quite\r\nuseful as a forum for the comprehensive exchange of\r\nviews on ocean affairs. The theme for this year, “New\r\nsustainable uses of the oceans, including the\r\nconservation and management of the biological\r\ndiversity of the seabed in areas beyond national\r\njurisdiction”, enabled participants to focus on this\r\ncomplex and sensitive subject. We urge greater focus\r\non this topic in our subsequent deliberations.\r\nAlthough gains have been made in the\r\nimplementation of the Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea and related agreements, full implementation is far\r\nfrom being achieved. This is the challenge before us as\r\nwe celebrate this tenth anniversary. We need to re-\r\nexamine our respective national implementation\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nmeasures and mechanisms to ensure better\r\nimplementation. This may call for a review of our\r\ninternal policies and legislation. It is noteworthy that\r\nlack of capacity is the main constraining factor for\r\nmany developing countries. Successive General\r\nAssembly resolutions have underscored the need to\r\nbuild capacity for developing countries. We note with\r\nappreciation that the United Nations has developed an\r\nintegrated mechanism consisting of a wide range of\r\nadvisory services, trust funds, training programmes and\r\ntechnical assistance to address that need.\r\nMr. Gómez Robledo (Mexico) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Today is cause for celebration in the United\r\nNations. The commemoration of the tenth anniversary\r\nof the entry into force of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea brings a festive\r\natmosphere to this room. For many, the Convention is\r\nalso known as the constitution of the oceans.\r\nOver this period of time, we have seen just how\r\nfundamentally important the Convention is for the\r\nmaintenance and strengthening of international peace\r\nand security, as well as for the sustainable management\r\nof the oceans and seas. Without any doubt, it has\r\nbrought stability, certainty and order to the use and\r\nmanagement of the immense oceanic space.\r\nHaving completed the first decade after entry into\r\nforce, the Convention has shown that it is one of the\r\nmost vigorous and visionary successes of this\r\nOrganization. Today its legal framework has been\r\nstrengthened, and it has promoted dynamism in the law\r\nof the sea. We are convinced that the Convention\r\ncontinues to provide the core standards around which\r\nall developments and activities in the oceans and seas\r\ndevelop.\r\nMarine scientific research is also one of the most\r\ndynamic sectors at the moment. The high degree of\r\nsophistication achieved in exploring the oceans has,\r\namong other things, facilitated the speedy generation\r\nof scientific data and their application in the area of\r\ntechnological innovation, and in this way we have\r\nmultiplied new discoveries.\r\nThis is even clearer when we think about the\r\nknowledge that we have of the biological diversity of\r\nthe ocean depths. Although science has made progress\r\nin this area, we feel that the international community\r\nstill does not have a complete vision of the\r\ninterrelationship among all the multidisciplinary\r\naspects of the conservation and sustainable use of\r\nmarine biodiversity, both on the high seas and on the\r\ninternational seabed.\r\nBecause of this, my delegation would like to\r\nexpress its great satisfaction with the setting up of an\r\nad hoc open-ended informal working group to study\r\nissues relating to the conservation and sustainable use\r\nof biological marine diversity beyond areas of national\r\njurisdiction. That is one of the most important aspects\r\nof the draft resolution on oceans and the law of the sea\r\n(A/59/L.22), and for that reason Mexico would like to\r\nexpress its thanks to all delegations that participated in\r\nthe negotiations on this draft resolution. All\r\ndelegations, without exception, contributed towards\r\nthis achievement.\r\nAs in previous years, Mexico notes that\r\nresolutions in this area have become guides for the\r\nprotection and preservation of the marine environment.\r\nGiven the gradual deterioration of the marine\r\nenvironment, we need urgent action to protect it, and in\r\nthis respect Mexico particularly welcomes the draft\r\nresolution’s reference to actions oriented towards the\r\nprotection of coral reefs.\r\nMexico is also convinced that there is a close\r\nrelationship between the protection of vulnerable\r\nmarine ecosystems and the safety of navigation. For\r\nthat reason, it is important that we have precise\r\nnautical charts in order to reduce the possibility of\r\nshipping accidents and their consequences for human\r\nlife and the marine environment in general. We urge\r\nthe international financial institutions and the\r\ncommunity of donors to redouble their efforts to\r\npromote training in developing countries in the\r\ndrawing up of nautical charts and in improving their\r\nhydrographic services.\r\nWe recognize that a great part of the\r\nenvironmental deterioration in coastal and marine areas\r\nis a result of land-based activities. For that reason, we\r\nencouraged the Consultative Process at its sixth\r\nmeeting to examine the subject with a view to\r\npromoting the overall application of the Global\r\nProgramme of Action for the Protection of the Marine\r\nEnvironment from Land-based Activities. We\r\nencourage it to give greater importance to the link\r\nbetween fresh water, the coastal area and marine\r\nresources in the application of the development\r\nobjectives set out in the Millennium Declaration, the\r\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation and the\r\nMonterrey Consensus on Financing for Development.\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nOne priority subject for Mexico is that of regional\r\ncooperation for the overall management of the oceans,\r\nand particularly for the effective implementation of the\r\nConvention. Of specific interest is the establishment of\r\ngeographic data and maritime delimitation. We are\r\nconvinced that regional initiatives, such as the\r\nMaritime Delimitation Workshop for Officials of the\r\nOrganization of the Eastern Caribbean States, are very\r\nuseful tools in the provision of the technical assistance\r\nneeded for that purpose by Caribbean States. Mexico\r\ncontinues to be committed to that initiative and\r\nrecently contributed for the third time to the conference\r\nassistance fund that was set up for the specific purpose\r\nof facilitating technical assistance to countries in\r\nnegotiations on maritime delimitation. We would like\r\nto thank the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of\r\nthe Sea for the invaluable help given to the conference\r\nin that respect.\r\nMexico would also like to express its support for\r\nthe work of the International Seabed Authority, and we\r\nthank its Secretary-General, Mr. Satya Nandan, and all\r\nthe staff under his direction. We attach great\r\nimportance to the work of the Authority in the\r\ncollection, analysis and dissemination of scientific\r\ndata, as well as its work in coordinating marine\r\nscientific research in line with article 143 of the\r\nConvention.\r\nIn that respect, we welcome the holding —\r\nalthough the circumstances were very difficult from a\r\nclimatic point of view — of the workshop for the\r\nestablishment of environmental baselines for future\r\ncontractors involved in the exploration of polymetallic\r\nsulphides and cobalt-rich crusts, held recently in\r\nKingston.\r\nWe are convinced that it is necessary to continue\r\nto support the voluntary fund in order to defray the\r\nparticipation costs of specialists from developing\r\ncountries in the meetings of the Legal and Technical\r\nCommission and the Finance Committee.\r\nWith regard to progress in discussions on\r\nregulating prospecting and exploration for polymetallic\r\nsulphides and cobalt crusts in the Area, Mexico\r\nbelieves that work should continue within the\r\nframework of the Authority to ensure that the draft\r\nregulations reflect the general principles of\r\ninternational law as they relate to the environment.\r\nSimilarly, and in light of the vulnerability of deep-sea\r\necosystems, we should also consider the possibility of\r\nincluding in the draft regulations strict liability for\r\ndamage to the marine environment of the Area. We\r\nmust not lose sight of the fact that article 304 of the\r\nConvention is a general provision that does not prevent\r\nthe ongoing development of standards on liability in\r\ninternational law.\r\nAnother area in which the promotion of capacity\r\nand cooperation with developing countries is important\r\nrelates to the application of article 76 of the\r\nConvention on the establishment of the limits of the\r\nouter continental shelf. We believe that without such\r\ntraining it will be practically impossible for a large\r\nnumber of countries to complete their presentations to\r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf\r\nby 2009. That aspect should be given urgent attention\r\nif we truly wish countries to be able to make their\r\npresentations to the Commission on time.\r\nIn that respect, we encourage the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to promote preparation training courses along\r\nthe lines proposed by the Commission on the Limits of\r\nthe Continental Shelf. We also feel it especially\r\nimportant that the Division for Ocean Affairs and the\r\nLaw of the Sea complete the training manual to help\r\nStates prepare their presentations.\r\nWe also thank the Secretary-General for his work\r\nin the preparation of the various reports under\r\nconsideration. We look forward to receiving his report\r\nunder article 319 of the Convention. In that respect, we\r\ninvite the Secretary-General to give increasing\r\nattention to the peaceful settlement of disputes in his\r\nmain report on oceans and the law of the sea. The\r\nsignificant contributions of the International Tribunal\r\nfor the Law of the Sea and the International Court of\r\nJustice in the peaceful solution of conflicts should also\r\nbe stressed.\r\nIn that context, we also thank Mr. Vladimir\r\nGolitsyn, Director of the Division for Ocean Affairs\r\nand the Law of the Sea, and his team for their excellent\r\nwork in promoting the implementation of the\r\nConvention.\r\nMr. Samy (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I wish to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nreports under the item “Oceans and the law of the sea”.\r\nThey reflect his important role and responsibilities,\r\nespecially those under the United Nations Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea with regard to managing ocean\r\naffairs and the law of the sea and to presenting\r\ncomprehensive annual and special reports.\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nThe reports under consideration today are of\r\nspecial significance in addressing the legal regime\r\narising out of the 1982 United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea, one of the most important\r\ninternational legal instruments. Its entry into force in\r\n1994 had considerable positive impact on the legal\r\nregime under the 1982 Convention. The international\r\ncommunity accords special importance to the\r\nConvention, as reflected in the growing number of\r\nStates acceding to it every year. It now has 154 States\r\nparties. We call on those members of the international\r\ncommunity that have not done so to accede to this\r\nimportant Convention.\r\nEgypt participated actively in the establishment\r\nof the three institutions of the Convention: the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority, the Commission on the\r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf and the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea. We therefore appeal to\r\nthe international community to implement the legal\r\nregime set forth in the Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea by applying its provisions at the national level. In\r\nthat regard, we call attention to the need to preserve\r\nspecial ocean resources, for we believe that maritime\r\nenvironmental protection is the responsibility of the\r\ninternational community as a whole. We wish in that\r\nrespect to commend the outstanding efforts made by\r\nthe International Seabed Authority and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nCurrent studies indicate that fisheries production\r\nis on the rise, yet future demands for fish will go unmet\r\nunless we improve the management of ocean and sea\r\nresources. That fact is all the more salient in the light\r\nof the failure of the current legal regime to protect\r\nfisheries and fish resources from exploitation beyond\r\ntheir natural capacity to replenish themselves. The\r\nproblem is compounded by reluctance and the lack of\r\npolitical will in some States to respect rules regulating\r\nquantities and methods of fishing. We therefore call on\r\nthose States to adhere to the 1995 Agreement for the\r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December\r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of\r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish\r\nStocks and to the Code of Conduct for Responsible\r\nFisheries. They should also draft rules on responsible\r\ntrading in ocean products in such a way that the\r\nConvention complements the Code.\r\nWe wish to note that the Convention assigns\r\nspecial importance to that matter. In article 192, it\r\nstresses the general obligation of States to protect and\r\npreserve the marine environment, and in 194 (5)\r\nfocuses on the preservation of depleted, threatened or\r\nendangered species and other forms of marine life. I\r\nwould further emphasize the important contents of\r\nparagraphs 262 of document A/59/62 on\r\nbioprospecting and its relation to and impact on the\r\nenvironment. Such activity highlights the need to\r\nimplement the Convention’s legal regime on scientific\r\nresearch into the deterioration of maritime ecosystems.\r\nDespite national efforts and a few success stories, we\r\nregret the ongoing general deterioration of the\r\nconditions of the oceans.\r\nIn that respect, I would note that Egypt has taken\r\ncertain important measures to protect some maritime\r\nenvironments and to declare certain ecosystems as\r\nprotected natural areas.\r\nMr. Sinaga (Indonesia): At the outset, I\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive report on oceans and the law of the sea,\r\nand the Division for Ocean Affairs and Law of the Sea\r\nfor its contribution to supporting the work of States\r\nMembers of the United Nations on this agenda item.\r\nMore than a decade has passed since the entry\r\ninto force of the 1982 United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea. As the report indicates,\r\n145 countries are now parties to the Convention. No\r\nConvention has enjoyed such wide participation within\r\nthe international community as this one. It constitutes a\r\nlandmark step by the international community towards\r\nregulating ocean affairs for the benefit of all mankind.\r\nIt codifies States’ practices in the context of their claim\r\nto portions of the sea adjacent to their coastal areas,\r\nand it introduces new legal frameworks on ocean-\r\nrelated activities beyond national jurisdictions, making\r\nit a veritable constitution of the oceans.\r\nLooking back, we can see that the lengthy\r\nprocess of negotiations preceding the adoption of the\r\nConvention was a reflection of the importance of\r\ndealing with delicate issues of ocean governance in\r\nsuch a way as to meet the interests and expectations of\r\nthe international community as a whole. That was\r\nfinally achieved by means of a workable compromise\r\nin various areas of ocean affairs. The implementation\r\nAgreement for particular issues relating to ocean\r\naffairs, concluded at a later stage, clearly reflected an\r\napproach aimed at securing the wider participation of\r\nStates in the Convention. In addition, further\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\narrangements on highly migratory and shared fish\r\nstocks were designed to enhance management and\r\nconservation measures for fisheries activities on the\r\nhigh seas.\r\nSeveral new issues relating to ocean affairs have\r\nnow emerged, as the report of the Secretary-General\r\nindicates. New technology has opened up new\r\nopportunities for States to exploit marine resources that\r\nwere not anticipated at the time of the adoption of the\r\nConvention. Further elaboration is needed, therefore, in\r\norder to ensure sustainability. We are now witnessing\r\nnew kinds of exploration of the living resources of the\r\nseabed in areas beyond national jurisdiction that bring\r\neconomic advantage. Although little information is\r\navailable on the matter at this time, the report alerts us\r\nto the possible impact of such activities on biological\r\ndiversity. The challenge for the international\r\ncommunity, therefore, is to manage those resources\r\nproperly in order to ensure that the benefits can be\r\nshared among all States, particularly the developing\r\nones.\r\nIt is worth noting that the report of the\r\nSecretary-General stipulates that the legal framework\r\nof the Convention serves as a reference and can be\r\napplied to issues relating to the conservation and\r\nmanagement of the biodiversity of the seabed in areas\r\nbeyond national jurisdiction. Against the backdrop of\r\nthe commemoration of the 10-year anniversary of the\r\nentry into force of the Convention, it would be wise to\r\nhope that States show a firm commitment to ensuring\r\nthat new ocean affairs issues will be addressed fairly,\r\ntaking into account the interest of developing\r\ncountries.\r\nMy delegation shares the view that capacity-\r\nbuilding constitutes an essential element to enable\r\ndeveloping States to take a more active part in\r\nconcerted efforts to manage and conserve marine\r\nresources. Like most developing countries, Indonesia\r\nattaches particular importance to the need for States to\r\nenhance cooperation through, inter alia, sharing\r\ninformation for capacity-building purposes. The\r\nimportance of the transfer of marine technology also\r\nseems relevant in that regard. It is through such\r\ncooperation that efforts to promote marine scientific\r\nresearch by coastal States in order to conserve marine\r\nresources can bear fruit.\r\nTechnical assistance from international\r\ninstitutions is also relevant and important, particularly\r\nwith respect to the preparation of submissions to the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.\r\nGiven the complicated technical aspects of the\r\nimplementation of article 76 of the Convention, such\r\nassistance would enable developing States, such as\r\nIndonesia, to meet the deadline suggested by the\r\nCommission. If States meet the deadline, that will\r\naccelerate the work of the Commission in making\r\nrecommendations on the matter.\r\nIt is interesting to note that this year in the Asia-\r\nPacific region we also witnessed the implementation of\r\nconservation management measures for highly\r\nmigratory fish stocks and shared fish stocks resulting\r\nfrom the Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995. The entry\r\ninto force of the Convention on the Conservation and\r\nManagement of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the\r\nWestern and Central Pacific Ocean on 19 June 2004\r\nwill be a test case for the efficacy of conservation\r\nmanagement introduced by the Fish Stocks Agreement\r\nprior to its review scheduled for 2006. My delegation\r\nis therefore of the view that that review should be\r\ndirected at improving conservation and management\r\nmeasures under the Agreement; it should not\r\ndiscourage the wider participation by States interested\r\nin joining the Agreement.\r\nIndonesia also takes note of the international\r\neffort to introduce more stringent controls in the\r\nprevention and suppression of acts of terrorism at sea.\r\nThe revisions and amendments to the various\r\nregulations and conventions adopted by the\r\nInternational Maritime Organization, such as the\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts\r\nagainst the Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA) and\r\nits Protocol of 1988, as well as the International Ship\r\nand Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code, are designed to\r\nmeet that objective.\r\nAs for the inclusion of provisions of the SUA\r\nConvention and its Protocol concerning ship boarding\r\non the high seas, Indonesia is of the view that that\r\neffort should be brought into line with international\r\nlaw in order to avoid unnecessary restrictions on\r\nfreedom of navigation. In that regard, the principle of\r\nflag State jurisdiction has to be respected.\r\nWhile acknowledging the importance of the war\r\nagainst terrorist acts in all their forms and\r\nmanifestations, we should not lose sight of the\r\nimportance of upholding the rule of international law.\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nOnly through concerted multilateral efforts can States\r\neffectively combat terrorism.\r\nOn the issue of enhancing maritime security,\r\nIndonesia has been implementing the ISPS Code, and\r\nby July 2004 several ports in Indonesia had met the\r\nrequirements of that Code. Similarly, together with\r\nMalaysia and Singapore, Indonesia has intensified joint\r\npatrol activities in the Malacca Strait. That\r\ncollaboration has successfully reduced the number of\r\nreported incidents. However, Indonesia would like to\r\nexpress its concern regarding the system for reporting\r\npiracy and armed robbery against ships used by the\r\nInternational Maritime Bureau.\r\nAs the Secretary-General’s report indicates, most\r\nattacks worldwide take place while ships are anchored\r\nor berthed, and Indonesia is no exception. Many\r\nincidents of armed robbery directed against such ships\r\nare reported to have occurred while ships were docked\r\nin ports, and therefore they do not meet the legal\r\ndefinition of piracy. That does not mean, however, that\r\nIndonesia tolerates such criminal acts in its territorial\r\nwaters — nor would we let the perpetrators of such\r\ncriminal acts go unpunished. Indonesia is fully aware\r\nthat the situation creates a negative image of the\r\nmaritime situation in our archipelago, and we are\r\ncommitted to combating such criminal acts. However,\r\nthe amalgamation of two different criminal acts into\r\none single classification for statistical purposes only\r\nresults in the distortion or misrepresentation of facts,\r\nsince different legal regimes apply to acts of piracy and\r\nacts of armed robbery against ships. Indonesia would\r\nlike that distinction to be upheld, consistent with\r\ninternational law.\r\nA review of the reporting system is also\r\nadvisable, as the criminal acts differ significantly in\r\nnature. Since the report of the IMB does not reflect the\r\nactual situation in the field, it can, in the final analysis,\r\nlead to the conclusion that maintaining such an\r\napproach would only give unfair treatment to the\r\naffected States, as they have to bear higher costs for\r\nsea transportation.\r\nIn light of the aforementioned, Indonesia is fully\r\naware of the importance of continued efforts of the\r\ninternational community to find a constructive and\r\nbalanced approach to address various issues of ocean\r\naffairs. It is, therefore, a distinct pleasure for my\r\ndelegation to co-sponsor draft resolution A/59/L.22. It\r\nis our sincere hope that all Member States will lend\r\ntheir support to the draft resolution.\r\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia) (spoke in French): First of\r\nall, may I take this opportunity to express my gratitude\r\nto the Secretary-General for the remarkable work he\r\nhas done in drawing up his detailed and exhaustive\r\nreport on oceans and the law of the sea (A/59/62 and\r\nAdd.1). My thanks also go to the Division for Ocean\r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea for their dedication to\r\nthe success of our work.\r\nWe are dealing with the agenda item entitled\r\n“Oceans and the law of the sea” on the very same day\r\nwe are celebrating the tenth anniversary of the entry\r\ninto force of the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea, a text of historic impact. The\r\nConvention has made an indisputable contribution to\r\nthe codification of international law of the sea and is\r\nan important milestone in the establishment of a global\r\nlegal framework for governance of the various marine\r\nareas and their living and non-living resources.\r\nWe take this opportunity to note with satisfaction\r\nthe operation and work of the institutions created under\r\nthe Convention, in particular the International Tribunal\r\nfor the Law of the Sea, the International Seabed\r\nAuthority and the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf.\r\nThe draft resolutions and today’s debate on the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General confirm the attachment\r\nof the General Assembly to matters relating to oceans\r\nand the law of the sea. This stems from a context\r\nnotably marked by fears related to the serious\r\nimplications that will arise for future generations from\r\nthe continuing degradation of marine ecosystems and\r\nfrom the over-exploitation of marine biological\r\nresources.\r\nAs reflected in the results of the World Summit\r\non Sustainable Development, there is increasing\r\nawareness of the importance of oceans and seas for the\r\nland ecosystem. They play a crucial role in assuring\r\nfood security, particularly for developing countries, in\r\nmaintaining economic prosperity and in contributing to\r\nthe well-being of present and future generations.\r\nThe protection and preservation of the marine\r\nenvironment and its fisheries resources are a source of\r\ncontinuing concern for Tunisia, a developing coastal\r\ncountry whose territorial waters are adjacent to the\r\nhigh seas. In fact, in the Mediterranean, a semi-\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nenclosed sea, the flora and fauna are increasingly\r\nthreatened by pollution from land-based and shipping\r\nsources.\r\nThe General Assembly has an essential role to\r\nplay in the area of protecting and sustainably using\r\nmarine resources; in other words, it has the role of\r\nguiding, monitoring and coordinating the programmes\r\nset up by specialized organs and institutions. In that\r\nrespect, the general legal framework provided by the\r\nConvention for the protection of the marine\r\nenvironment and the conservation of the ocean’s\r\nresources is a key accomplishment that should guide\r\nall international work in this area.\r\nThe other relevant international instruments, such\r\nas the 1975 Barcelona Convention and its amended\r\nprotocols, develop in particular the aspect of special\r\nprotected areas. Agenda 21, the Global Programme of\r\nAction for the Protection of the Marine Environment\r\nfrom Land-based Activities and the various actions\r\nundertaken by relevant international organizations of\r\nthe United Nations system are all reference points\r\nrelating to the protection of the marine environment\r\nand the conservation of the ocean’s resources.\r\nBy setting up a system for the exploitation of\r\nmarine resources beyond national jurisdiction that\r\nprovides for a fair sharing of the resources, the\r\nConvention has reflected the aspiration for a fair and\r\njust international economic order to govern oceanic\r\nspace. The concept of the common heritage of\r\nhumanity that it conveys crystallizes all the hopes of\r\ndeveloping countries for a world based on peace,\r\njustice, solidarity and progress for all.\r\nThat is why, while understanding the reasons\r\nmentioned for reconsideration of certain aspects of the\r\nregime as laid out in the Convention — that is, the\r\nadaptation of the Convention to new economic and\r\npolitical realities — Tunisia stresses the interest of\r\ndeveloping countries in preserving the spirit of the\r\nConvention. In that respect, we note with satisfaction\r\nthe compromise solution contained in the draft\r\nresolution before us, A/59/L.22, which consists of\r\nsetting up an informal open-ended working group with\r\nthe mandate of studying questions relating to\r\nconservation and the sustainable use of marine\r\nbiodiversity in zones situated beyond national\r\njurisdiction.\r\nMr. Sen (India): My delegation welcomes the\r\nopportunity to participate in the debate on this item\r\nduring the tenth anniversary year of the entry into force\r\nof the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea. We thank the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive reports on matters relating to the law of\r\nthe sea and ocean affairs.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea sets out the legal framework within which all\r\nactivities in the oceans and seas must be carried out.\r\nAccordingly, the need for its universal acceptance\r\ncannot be overemphasized, and we welcome the steady\r\nincrease in the number of States parties to the\r\nConvention.\r\nIt is a matter of deep satisfaction that all\r\nsubsidiary institutions under the Convention — the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority, the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Commission on\r\nthe Limits of the Continental Shelf — have made\r\nconsiderable progress in their respective areas of work\r\nin the past year. India has been working closely with\r\nall those institutions. We have invested heavily in the\r\nexploration of minerals in the deep seabed. We\r\ncontinue to incur considerable expense for collection of\r\ndata as a primary investor and now as a contractor.\r\nThe International Seabed Authority is currently\r\ninvolved in the development of a legal regime for\r\nprospecting and exploration of polymetallic sulphides\r\nand cobalt-rich crusts. We appreciate the role of the\r\nAuthority in the conservation of biodiversity in the\r\nArea, especially its elaboration of the rules, regulations\r\nand procedures to ensure the effective protection of the\r\nmarine environment, the protection and conservation of\r\nthe natural resources of the Area and the prevention of\r\ndamage to its flora and fauna from harmful effects that\r\nmay arise from activities in the Area.\r\nDuring the last session of the International\r\nSeabed Authority, India was elected a member of the\r\nCouncil in Group B, representing States that have made\r\nthe largest investment in seabed mining. We\r\ncongratulate Ambassador Satya Nandan on his\r\nre-election as Secretary-General of the Authority for\r\nanother four-year term.\r\nAt its thirteenth session, the Commission on the\r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf finalized and adopted a\r\nrevised set of rules of procedure on the basis of the\r\npractical experience gained by the Commission from\r\nreceiving and examining its first submission. We\r\nwelcome the revised set of rules of procedure. The\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nCommission is currently examining the second\r\nsubmission, made by Brazil on 17 May 2004.\r\nWe understand that a number of countries have\r\nindicated the submission of their claims between 2005\r\nand 2008. The developing countries that are in the\r\nprocess of preparing submissions to the Commission\r\nmight require help, in some cases to enhance their\r\ncapacity. In this regard, States that have expertise in\r\nthe delineation of the outer limits of the continental\r\nshelf could extend such cooperation by providing\r\nassistance to developing States.\r\nIndia has the requisite expertise on the\r\nassessment and mapping of the continental shelf and is\r\nwilling to extend cooperation in training to developing\r\ncountries for that purpose. In this context, we also\r\nwelcome the publication by the Division of Ocean\r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea of a training manual to\r\nassist States to develop the requisite knowledge and\r\nskills to prepare their submission in respect of the outer\r\nlimits of the continental shelf.\r\nMay I also add in this context, that in the spirit of\r\nSouth-South cooperation and to the extent appropriate\r\nand practicable, India is willing to share its\r\ntechnologies in fields ranging from ocean data\r\ncollection to anti-erosion capabilities and submersible\r\nenergy.\r\nThe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea\r\nhas been active as an independent judicial body,\r\nestablished by the Convention to adjudicate disputes\r\narising out of its interpretation or application. It has\r\ndecided a number of cases involving a wide variety of\r\nissues, such as freedom of navigation and other\r\ninternationally lawful uses of the seas. The\r\nenforcement of customs laws, refuelling vessels at sea,\r\nthe right of hot pursuit, conservation and sustainable\r\nuse of fish stocks, provisional measures and matters\r\ninvolving land reclamation. The Tribunal enjoys a high\r\nreputation for fairness and integrity.\r\nThe international community has continued to\r\nfocus, over the past year, on issues relating to\r\nnavigation, conservation and management of living\r\nmarine resources and conservation and management of\r\nthe biological diversity of the seabed in areas beyond\r\nnational jurisdiction.\r\nIn the area of navigation, we would like to\r\nexpress our serious concern with the increase in the\r\nreported incidents of piracy and armed robbery against\r\nships, which have risen to 3,041 in the period from\r\n1984 to the end of March 2003. The involvement of\r\nmilitia groups in kidnapping crews in politically\r\nvulnerable areas calls for close attention. Piracy attacks\r\nhave taken place in certain geographical hotspots, not\r\nin the open sea, but in territorial waters, while the ships\r\nwere at anchor or berthed.\r\nRegional cooperation in high-risk areas has been\r\nidentified as an important measure to combat crimes at\r\nsea. India, along with 15 other States of the region, has\r\nbeen involved in the ongoing efforts initiated by Japan\r\nto establish a regional cooperation agreement on anti-\r\npiracy measures. May I also add that the Indian navy is\r\nplaying a very useful and productive role in combating\r\npiracy in the seas adjacent to it.\r\nThe prevalence of illegal, unreported, and\r\nunregulated (IUU) fishing is causing severe problems\r\naffecting world fisheries, particularly in developing\r\ncountries and is likely to have far-reaching adverse\r\nconsequences for the long-term sustainable\r\nmanagement of fisheries. It is a matter of grave\r\nconcern that overfishing continues to take place in\r\ncontravention of applicable regional conservation\r\nregimes, and that States are not meeting their\r\nobligations to address complaints by their flag vessels\r\nand nationals.\r\nExcess capacity has been cited as a key factor in\r\nIUU fishing and overfishing in general. Hence,\r\nemphasis has been placed on the need for capacity\r\nreduction, where excess capacity exists, and on the\r\nneed to increase the capacity of developing States to\r\nachieve sustainable fisheries, both in areas under\r\nnational jurisdiction, and on the high seas. In this\r\ncontext, we agree with the recommendation made by\r\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United\r\nNations (FAO) technical consultation to continue to\r\nuse funds to assist developing States in collecting and\r\nassessing comprehensive data on IUU fishing.\r\nThe preservation of vulnerable marine\r\necosystems and biodiversity in areas beyond national\r\njurisdiction has been the focus in recent times in the\r\nsubsidiary bodies created by the Convention, and also\r\nin the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on\r\nBiological Diversity. It is currently estimated that\r\napproximately 98 per cent of known marine species\r\nlive in benthic environments and that more species live\r\nin benthic environments than in all other environments\r\non earth combined. The biological communities located\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nbeyond the national jurisdiction, on the deep seabed,\r\nsuch as sea mounds, deep sea corals, hydrothermal\r\nvents and other features, which include cold seeps and\r\npockmarks and soft-sediment environments, such as\r\nabyssal plains, trenches and submarine canyons, have\r\nbeen identified as vulnerable to fishing and marine\r\nscience research, including bioprospecting.\r\nThe discovery of deep seabed communities has\r\nopened opportunities for prospecting of\r\nchemosynthetic organisms, characterized by a\r\nmolecular structure allowing them to live in water\r\nexceeding 100 degrees Centigrade, at extremely high\r\npressures, extremophiles. Due to the species’ robust\r\nnature, for example, the enzymes can be exposed to\r\nharsh conditions and high temperature. Extremophiles\r\nare used in a number of industrial processes, ranging\r\nfrom liposomes for drug delivery and cosmetics, to\r\nwaste treatment, molecular biology and food and\r\nagricultural processes. It appears that the commercial\r\nuse of naturally occurring extremophiles is likely to\r\nincrease in the near future.\r\nThe impact of scientific research and\r\nbioprospecting on these fragile ecosystems, leading to\r\nhabitat loss and mortality, must be regulated in such a\r\nway as to ensure the sustainable use of biological\r\nresources, including the equitable sharing of benefits to\r\nhumankind as a whole, in accordance with the general\r\nprinciples of the Convention on the Law of the Sea and\r\nthe Convention on Biological Diversity.\r\nIn this connection, we would like to express our\r\nsupport for the establishment of the ad hoc and open-\r\nended informal working group envisaged in the draft\r\nresolution on oceans and the law of the sea (A/59/L.22)\r\nto study issues relating to the conservation and\r\nsustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas\r\nbeyond national jurisdiction.\r\nMr. Hannesson (Iceland): At the outset I would\r\nlike to commend the Secretariat, in particular the able\r\nstaff of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of\r\nthe Sea, headed by its new Director, Mr. Vladimir\r\nGolitsyn, for its comprehensive report on oceans and\r\nthe law of the sea (A/59/62), and the report on\r\nsustainable fisheries (A/59/298). Let me also\r\nacknowledge the professional manner in which the\r\ncoordinators, Mr. Marcos de Almeida (Brazil),\r\nMs. Jennifer McIver (New Zealand) and Ms. Holly\r\nKlehler (United States) conducted the informal\r\nconsultations on the omnibus and fisheries draft\r\nresolutions (A/59/L.22 and A/59/L.23, respectively).\r\nThese consultations turned out to be particularly\r\nchallenging this year, and we wish to thank all of the\r\nparticipants for their constructive contributions.\r\nIt is highly appropriate today, on the tenth\r\nanniversary of its entry into force, to recall the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which is\r\nwithout doubt one of the greatest achievements in the\r\nhistory of the United Nations. It is the first and only\r\ncomprehensive treaty in the field of the law of the sea.\r\nIt contains both codified rules of customary law and a\r\nnumber of innovations covering all uses, not only of\r\noceans and seas, but also their superjacent airspace and\r\nsubjacent seabed and subsoil.\r\nThe Convention on the Law of the Sea thus\r\nprovides the legal framework for all of our\r\ndeliberations on the oceans and the law of the sea. We\r\nwelcome the ratification of the Convention today by\r\nour neighbouring country, Denmark, and urge those\r\nStates that still have not ratified the Convention to do\r\nso in order to achieve the ultimate goal of universal\r\nparticipation.\r\nIt is imperative that the Convention be fully\r\nimplemented and its integrity preserved. Issues that\r\nwere settled at the Law of the Sea Conference should\r\nnot be reopened. In this respect, it must be borne in\r\nmind that the conclusions of the Conference are\r\nregarded as a package, individual States prevailing in\r\nsome areas but having to compromise on others.\r\nOn this occasion we note with satisfaction that\r\nthe three institutions established under the Convention\r\nare functioning well. The International Tribunal for the\r\nLaw of the Sea has already adjudicated a number of\r\ndisputes in this field. The International Seabed\r\nAuthority is actively preparing for future exploitation\r\nof mineral resources in the international seabed area.\r\nThe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf\r\nhas begun its consideration of the first submissions\r\nregarding the establishment of the outer limits of the\r\ncontinental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, and a\r\nnumber of coastal States, including Iceland, have stated\r\ntheir intention to make submissions within the next few\r\nyears. It must be ensured that the Commission will be\r\nable to fulfil the functions entrusted to it under the\r\nConvention, taking into account, in particular, the\r\nexpectation that new submissions will require parallel\r\nmeetings of several subcommissions for their\r\nexamination.\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nAs recognized in the draft omnibus resolution, it\r\nis important that States exchange views in order to\r\nincrease understanding of issues arising from the\r\napplication of article 76 of the Convention, thus\r\nfacilitating the preparation of submissions by States to\r\nthe Commission, in particular developing States. For\r\nthis purpose, the Law of the Sea Institute of Iceland\r\nand the Center for Oceans Law and Policy of the\r\nUniversity of Virginia School of Law co-hosted last\r\nyear a conference in Reykjavik on the legal and\r\nscientific aspects of continental shelf limits. The\r\nproceedings of the conference have now been\r\npublished in a book and the Law of the Sea Institute of\r\nIceland is in the process of distributing a copy to all\r\ndeveloping States.\r\nIn this context, it also gives me pleasure to\r\ninform the General Assembly of the decision by the\r\nGovernment of Iceland to make a contribution of\r\n$100,000 to the trust fund for the purpose of\r\nfacilitating the preparation of submissions to the\r\nCommission by developing States, in particular the\r\nleast developed countries and small island developing\r\nStates, and to facilitate compliance with article 76 of\r\nthe Convention. Furthermore, my Government has\r\ndecided to make a contribution of $50,000 to the trust\r\nfund to assist members of the Commission from\r\ndeveloping States to participate in its meetings.\r\nThe 1995 Fish Stocks Agreement is of paramount\r\nimportance, as it strengthens considerably the\r\nframework for the conservation and management of\r\nthose stocks by regional fisheries management\r\norganizations. The provisions of the Agreement\r\nstrengthen in many ways the relevant provisions of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\n(UNCLOS) and some of the provisions represent a\r\ndevelopment of international law in this area. However,\r\nthe effectiveness of the Agreement depends on its wide\r\nratification and implementation, and we encourage\r\nthose States that have not ratified the Agreement to do\r\nso.\r\nFollowing the initiative in the first two rounds of\r\ninformal consultations of States parties to the\r\nAgreement, the General Assembly decided last year, in\r\nits resolution 58/14, to establish an assistance fund\r\nunder part VII of the Agreement to assist developing\r\nStates parties in the implementation of the Agreement.\r\nThe United Nations and the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) have now\r\nconcluded an arrangement regarding the administration\r\nof the assistance fund. I am happy to inform the\r\nAssembly of the decision by my Government to make a\r\ncontribution of $50,000 to the assistance fund.\r\nIt is the view of the Government of Iceland that\r\nthe General Assembly should focus on specific issues\r\nthat have global implications, and not on issues that\r\nfall within the purview of the sovereign rights of States\r\nor under the responsibility of regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations. The General Assembly\r\nshould address issues that are global in nature and can\r\nonly be solved through global cooperation. We should\r\nthus address marine pollution, which respects no\r\nboundaries and must therefore be met with global\r\naction. We should also address the need for a level\r\nplaying field for the fisheries sector that encourages\r\nsustainable fisheries globally, including the need to\r\nremove fisheries subsidies. Further examples can be\r\nidentified. Conservation and the sustainable utilization\r\nof living marine resources is, on the other hand, a local\r\nand regional matter. We can, therefore, not accept\r\nopening the door for global micromanagement of\r\nfisheries, which are subject to the sovereign rights of\r\nStates or under the responsibility of regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations.\r\nIn this light, we are satisfied with the outcome of\r\nthe informal consultations on the omnibus and fisheries\r\nresolutions with respect to destructive practices that\r\nhave adverse impacts on marine biodiversity and\r\necosystems. The relevant paragraphs in the two draft\r\nresolutions recognize that it is for the relevant States or\r\nregional fisheries management organizations, as\r\nappropriate, to regulate these destructive practices and\r\nto take decisions on any interim or long-term\r\nmanagement measures. Iceland was among those States\r\nthat insisted that these paragraphs should apply, in\r\nprinciple, to areas both within and beyond national\r\njurisdiction. The rationale for this position is, of\r\ncourse, that vulnerable marine ecosystems located in\r\nthe exclusive economic zone require no less protection\r\nfrom destructive practices than those located on the\r\nhigh seas.\r\nIceland, like many other coastal States, has been\r\napplying area restrictions and closures as one of its\r\nfisheries management tools for many years. Within our\r\nnational jurisdiction, there are several areas that have\r\nvarious levels of protection, many of which offer\r\ncomplete protection for vulnerable habitats on the\r\nseabed. The area closures are the subject of continuous\r\nreview. Presently, Icelandic authorities are undertaking\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\na review with the specific purpose of reassessing the\r\nprotection currently given to vulnerable habitats,\r\nincluding deep-water corals, and the possible need for\r\nincreased protection. This review and other work\r\nundertaken in this field are based on a new report by a\r\nGovernment committee on Iceland’s policy on ocean\r\naffairs. The policy aims at maintaining the future\r\nhealth, biodiversity and sustainability of the ocean\r\nsurrounding Iceland in order for it to continue to\r\nsustain and promote the nation’s welfare.\r\nAt the regional level, Iceland took part only last\r\nweek in the establishment of an interim measure for the\r\nprotection of vulnerable deep-water habitats in the high\r\nseas of the North Atlantic Ocean. The North-East\r\nAtlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) agreed on an\r\ninterim prohibition of bottom-trawling and fishing with\r\nstatic gear on a number of seamounts and a section of\r\nthe Reykjanes ridge, south of Iceland, for a three-year\r\nperiod. During this interim period, the Commission\r\nwill assess its work on this issue, seek further scientific\r\nadvice and assess possible enforcement issues that may\r\narise, with the aim of having appropriate conservation\r\nand management measures in place by 2008. The\r\nCommission has shown its commitment to taking the\r\nnecessary action to protect vulnerable habitats, and it is\r\nimportant that such work be performed on a case-by-\r\ncase and scientific basis as recognized in the draft\r\nresolution on fisheries.\r\nIceland welcomes that increased attention is\r\nbeing devoted to ocean issues in the world. I would\r\nlike to share with you some of the more recent\r\ndevelopments in this respect within the Arctic Council,\r\nwhich Iceland currently chairs.\r\nLast week, the Arctic Council, in cooperation\r\nwith the International Arctic Science Committee,\r\nlaunched the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment\r\n(ACIA). The scientific message from this\r\ncomprehensive assessment is that the climate is now\r\nchanging faster across the Arctic then anywhere else in\r\nthe world. Those changes are impacting the\r\nenvironment and people in the Arctic region and have\r\nimplications for the world at large. More than half of\r\nthe Arctic region is ocean and the ACIA pays special\r\nattention to coastal and marine issues.\r\nThe assessment projects that the warming climate\r\nwill bring about ecosystem shifts in the ocean. As a\r\nresult, increased productivity is likely to occur among\r\nsome species of fish, including herring and cod. At the\r\nsame time, cold-water fish species and mammals are\r\nexpected to move northward or may even be forced\r\ninto decline. Furthermore, the thinning sea ice allows\r\nstronger wave generation by winds, causing increased\r\ncoastal erosion along Arctic shores. Those effects are\r\nalready apparent and much larger changes are projected\r\nto occur during this century.\r\nThe projected decline in Arctic sea ice will\r\nwidely increase access to natural resources in the\r\nArctic waters, including oil, gas and fish stocks. We\r\ncan expect that increased offshore developments in the\r\nArctic in the years to come will raise questions of\r\nnational sovereignty over resources and add to the need\r\nfor new and better adapted environmental protection\r\nregulations.\r\nIn the context of increased development and\r\nclimatic pressures on the Arctic marine environment, I\r\nwould like to draw particular attention to the Arctic\r\nCouncil’s Marine Strategic Plan for the protection of\r\nthe Arctic marine environment, to be submitted to the\r\nfourth Arctic Council Ministerial meeting next week.\r\nThe strategy is based on an integrated ecosystem-based\r\napproach to sustainable ocean management. In\r\nlaunching the strategy, the Arctic Council is\r\ncontributing in a significant way to the follow-up of\r\nthe Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.\r\nThe Arctic Marine Strategic Plan sets out the\r\nvision and goals, as well as a number of strategic\r\nactivities, to help address sustainable development of\r\nthe Arctic marine environment. Such a strategy should\r\noffer numerous opportunities. It will help us to\r\nconfront existing conditions, including pollution, and\r\nprovide a means to address new and emerging\r\nchallenges. One example is the possible opening of\r\nnew Arctic sea routes due to melting sea ice.\r\nThe decision by the General Assembly, in its\r\nresolution 57/141, to establish a regular process under\r\nthe United Nations for global reporting and assessment\r\nof the state of the marine environment, including socio-\r\neconomic aspects, acknowledges that international\r\naction is needed to prevent and counter marine\r\npollution and physical degradation of the marine\r\nenvironment. For us to succeed in that task, accessible\r\nand authoritative information and advice are needed,\r\nparticularly regarding the socio-economic\r\nconsequences of the degradation of the marine\r\nenvironment. The regular assessment process should\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nprovide the basis for responsible decision-making to\r\nimprove the situation.\r\nDuring the international workshop on the regular\r\nprocess held in conjunction with the fifth meeting of\r\nthe Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the\r\nLaw of the Sea, it emerged that more time is needed to\r\ndefine the basic objectives and scope of the regular\r\nprocess. The Government of Iceland is prepared to\r\ncontinue working with other interested countries in\r\norder to fulfil the mandate of resolution 57/141 and to\r\nlaunch, in due time, a regular process that is both\r\nfocused and prioritized.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the\r\nrepresentative of the United States to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.23.\r\nMr. Siv (United States): My delegation has the\r\nhonour to co-sponsor draft resolution A/59/L.22\r\nentitled “Oceans and the law of the sea”.\r\nBefore I introduce draft resolution A/59/L.23 on\r\nsustainable fisheries, I would like to make a technical\r\ncorrection to the text, as agreed upon in consultations.\r\nIn both paragraphs 66 and 67, following the words\r\n“including bottom trawling”, the comma should be\r\ndeleted and the word “which” replaced with the word\r\n“that”.\r\nI am honoured to introduce on behalf of the\r\nsponsors draft resolution A/59/L.23 on sustainable\r\nfisheries. I am pleased to announce that, since the\r\npublication of the draft resolution, the following\r\ncountries have become co-sponsors: Australia,\r\nBelgium Belize, Germany, Greece, Italy, Micronesia,\r\nPoland, Spain and Ukraine.\r\nThe United States thanks each delegation that\r\nworked to achieve those draft resolutions. We\r\nparticularly appreciate the assistance given to Holly\r\nKoehler, our representative, who coordinated\r\nnegotiation of the fisheries draft resolution this year.\r\nWe also appreciate the efforts of Marcos de Almeida of\r\nBrazil and Jennifer McIver of New Zealand, who\r\nco-chaired the oceans draft resolution with great skill\r\nand objectivity.\r\nA key element of the fisheries negotiations this\r\nyear was protecting sensitive underwater features and\r\nvulnerable marine ecosystems from destructive fishing\r\npractices. The draft resolution calls upon States and\r\nregional fisheries management organizations to\r\nurgently address the impacts of destructive fishing\r\npractices. To that end, it calls for the interim\r\nprohibition of such practices and the adoption of\r\nconservation and management measures. The United\r\nStates will work cooperatively with all States and\r\ninternational bodies engaged in regulating fisheries to\r\ngive effect to those provisions. The fisheries draft\r\nresolution also lays the foundation for the review\r\nconference mandated by the 1995 United Nations Fish\r\nStocks Agreement. It calls for renewed efforts to\r\nachieve sustainable aquaculture; to combat illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated fishing; and to address\r\nfishing overcapacity, harmful subsidies and derelict\r\nfishing gear.\r\nWe are also pleased that the fisheries draft\r\nresolution once again explicitly takes up the issue of\r\nshark conservation and management. We are still\r\nconcerned that many shark species remain vulnerable\r\nto exploitation due to their unique biology and lack of\r\neffective management. Unfortunately, progress in\r\nimplementing the 1999 Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization (FAO) International Plan of Action for\r\nthe Conservation and Management of Sharks has been\r\ndisappointing. We applaud the language on sharks\r\nstrengthening last year’s resolution. We look forward\r\nto continuing to work with all interested to implement\r\nit at the FAO and through relevant regional\r\norganizations.\r\nTurning to the draft resolution on oceans and the\r\nlaw of the sea, it is fitting that we will adopt that draft\r\nresolution today, the tenth anniversary of the\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea’s entry into force.\r\nThree years ago, in this forum, I announced the Bush\r\nAdministration’s support for that treaty. Now that the\r\nUnited States Senate committees have completed their\r\nhearings, the full Senate is in a position to approve\r\naccession to the Convention. The Bush Administration\r\nhopes that this will occur expeditiously so that the\r\nUnited States may join the other 145 parties to the\r\nConvention. We support the international community’s\r\nefforts to fully implement the provisions of the\r\nConvention and related agreements. That will achieve\r\nthe goal of establishing a legal order that will promote\r\nfreedom of the seas, the peaceful uses of the oceans,\r\nthe equitable and efficient utilization of their resources,\r\nthe conservation of their living resources and the study,\r\nprotection and preservation of the marine environment.\r\nThe highlight of this year’s draft resolution on\r\noceans (A/59/L.22) is the establishment of a working\r\ngroup to study issues relating to the conservation and\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nsustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond\r\nareas under national jurisdiction. Destructive practices\r\nneed to be addressed both within the exclusive\r\neconomic zones and beyond. However, the areas\r\nbeyond national jurisdiction present particular legal\r\nand logistical challenges for the international\r\ncommunity. In preparation for the meeting of the\r\nworking group in early 2006, the Secretariat will\r\nprepare a report on those issues, which may identify\r\noptions and approaches for promoting international\r\ncooperation. We anticipate that that report will be\r\nwritten in consultation with relevant international\r\nbodies and interested States. That way, it can serve as a\r\ncomprehensive and objective basis for the working\r\ngroup’s examination of these novel and difficult issues.\r\nThe draft resolution also requests the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to convene a second international workshop on\r\nthe regular process for global reporting and assessment\r\nof the state of the marine environment. Recent informal\r\ncontacts among States have revived hope that we can\r\nmake progress next June in establishing such an\r\ninformation collection process, which would provide\r\nessential information for scientists and policy makers.\r\nWe also look forward to the sixth meeting of the\r\ninformal Consultative Process, to be held in June. We\r\nwill focus on two important topics: marine debris, and\r\nthe role of fisheries in sustainable development. The\r\nConsultative Process has become a valuable means for\r\neducating United Nations delegations and for\r\nstimulating discussion that informs the negotiation of\r\nthe annual oceans and fisheries draft resolutions. It also\r\nhelps to coordinate the work of oceans-related bodies\r\nthroughout the year.\r\nTwo months ago, the United States Commission\r\non Ocean Policy released its final report. It highlighted\r\nfor the American people the importance of the oceans\r\nto the United States. As the Bush Administration\r\nprepares its response to the report, it is keenly aware of\r\none of the Commission’s major themes: many oceans\r\nissues are inherently international issues. We will\r\ncontinue working during the coming years with our\r\ninternational partners to make the world’s oceans safer,\r\ncleaner and more productive.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nThis year marks the tenth anniversary of the entry into\r\nforce of the United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea. That “constitution of the sea”, which came\r\ninto being after nearly 10 years of intense negotiations\r\nand consultations, has not only codified all the\r\navailable customary international law with respect to\r\nthe law of the sea, but has also further developed a new\r\nregime on the law of the sea, thus providing a basic\r\nlegal framework for human activities on the oceans.\r\nThe Chinese delegation wishes to pay high tribute to\r\nall those who have made a contribution to the\r\nConvention in the process of its negotiations.\r\nThe oceans and the sea are an integral whole, and\r\nall the aspects of that whole are closely interlinked. To\r\nmeet the serious challenges now facing ocean affairs\r\nrequires joint efforts by all of humanity — particularly\r\ncooperation among countries and the relevant\r\ninternational organizations. We encourage more\r\ncountries to accede to the Convention, and we welcome\r\nthe establishment of the Ocean and Coastal Areas\r\nNetwork. We hope that the Network will further\r\nstrengthen coordination among the relevant United\r\nNations agencies, between United Nations agencies\r\nand other relevant international organizations, and\r\namong various countries.\r\nThe Chinese Government attaches great\r\nimportance to the Convention and has actively\r\npromoted its implementation and the maintenance of\r\ninternational order on the oceans. The Chinese\r\nGovernment is pleased to see that the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea, the Commission on\r\nthe Limits of the Continental Shelf and the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority, which were established\r\nunder the Convention, have all made good progress in\r\nsettling maritime disputes, in delineating the outer\r\nlimits of the continental shelf and in exploring for\r\nresources and preserving the environment in the\r\ninternational seabed area. The Chinese Government is\r\nplaying and will continue to play its part in the work of\r\nthose agencies.\r\nThe Chinese delegation believes that the United\r\nNations has the responsibility and the ability to make\r\nan even greater contribution in the realm of the sea.\r\nOcean affairs, including matters related to the\r\nConvention, concern all humanity and therefore should\r\nbe discussed within the framework of the United\r\nNations. The Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea was\r\nestablished by General Assembly resolution 54/33 and\r\nextended by resolution 57/141 to help the Assembly to\r\nreview, in an effective and constructive manner, ocean\r\naffairs and the latest developments related to the law of\r\nthe sea.\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nThe establishment and extension of the\r\nConsultative Process is a reflection of the universal\r\nconcern in the international community about the issue\r\nof oceans. Over the past five years, the agenda of the\r\nConsultative Process has addressed nearly all areas of\r\nthe law of the sea, and the Process has become an\r\nimportant forum where all countries — including those\r\nnot party to the Convention — discuss issues related to\r\noceans and the law of the sea and coordinate their\r\npositions. The Chinese Government will, as always,\r\ncontinue to actively take part in and promote the\r\nProcess so that it can achieve further results.\r\nThe Chinese delegation has noted that, through\r\nits resolution 57/141, the General Assembly\r\nestablished a process for the global reporting and\r\nassessment of the state of the marine environment,\r\nincluding socio-economic aspects, both current and\r\nforeseeable, building on existing regional assessments.\r\nThe process is therefore of great significance to the\r\nprotection of the marine environment and to the\r\npromotion of sustainable development. The Chinese\r\nGovernment attaches importance to the global marine\r\nassessment process and has sent experts to participate\r\nin its work.\r\nThe Chinese delegation further believes that the\r\nglobal marine assessment process should operate\r\nwithin the United Nations framework, with the\r\nOrganization playing a leading role, and that it should\r\ntake full account of the views of all United Nations\r\nMember States. The process should also make the best\r\nuse of existing global and regional assessment\r\nmechanisms so as to avoid the overlapping of work and\r\nthe wasting of resources.\r\nActivities carried out under the global marine\r\nassessment process should be consistent with the\r\nConvention and should respect the sovereign rights and\r\njurisdiction of coastal States over marine areas under\r\ntheir national jurisdiction, as provided for under the\r\nConvention. The assessment areas should not be\r\ndetermined solely through the ecosystem approach; full\r\nconsideration should be given to the geographical areas\r\ncovered by existing effective regional mechanisms. It\r\nis not appropriate now to prejudge how many\r\nassessment areas there should be; the establishment\r\nand operation of the process should proceed gradually.\r\nThe present work should focus on two areas:\r\nsummarizing and assessing existing assessment\r\nmechanisms related to the marine environment, and\r\ngreatly strengthening the capacity-building of the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nChina is among the countries that have the largest\r\nnumbers of fishermen and fishing fleets. Food security,\r\npoverty reduction and social stability all depend on the\r\nsustainable development of fisheries. The Chinese\r\nGovernment is carrying out active cooperation through\r\nbilateral mechanisms, regional fishery management\r\norganizations and the FAO to promote the\r\nconservation, management and rational utilization of\r\nfishing resources.\r\nThe Chinese Government notes that the 1995\r\nAgreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\nof 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and\r\nManagement of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks came into force on 11 December\r\n2001. That Agreement has provided a basic framework\r\nfor establishing regional fishery management\r\nmechanisms. The Chinese Government has already\r\nsigned the Agreement and is now actively participating\r\nin regional fishery cooperation, in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of that Agreement. China has joined both the\r\nInternational Commission for the Conservation of\r\nAtlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the Indian Ocean Tuna\r\nCommission (IOTC) and has attended meetings of\r\nother relevant regional fishery organizations as an\r\nobserver. China has also signed the Inter-American\r\nTropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) Convention.\r\nLast July, China completed domestic legal\r\nprocedures for the ratification of the Convention on the\r\nConservation and Management of Highly Migratory\r\nFish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean,\r\nand preparations for becoming party to the Convention\r\nare well under way. The Chinese Government hopes\r\nthat, through various regional mechanisms, resources\r\ncan be properly conserved and managed so as to\r\nachieve the sustainable development of fisheries.\r\nThe Chinese Government attaches great\r\nimportance to the protection and management of the\r\nbiodiversity of the seabed in areas beyond national\r\njurisdiction. We believe that, at the present stage,\r\nrelevant research should be stepped up, taking full\r\naccount of the existing international seabed regime.\r\nThe Chinese delegation has noted that the International\r\nSeabed Authority has extensive responsibilities for the\r\nprotection and preservation of the marine environment\r\nof the seabed in areas beyond national jurisdiction.\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.54\r\nChina encourages the Seabed Authority and other\r\nrelevant international organizations to play an active\r\nrole in that respect.\r\nAs China is a coastal developing country, the\r\nChinese Government attaches great importance to the\r\npeace and tranquillity of the oceans, their sustainable\r\ndevelopment and the protection of the marine\r\nenvironment. The utilization and protection of the sea\r\nis an ongoing issue for humankind. The Chinese\r\nGovernment is ready to work with other countries and\r\ninternational organizations and to play its part in\r\nadvancing the cause of ocean affairs in the interests of\r\nhumankind.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
