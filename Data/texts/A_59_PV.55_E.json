(Gabon)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Chowdhury\r\n(Bangladesh), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 49 (continued)\r\nOceans and the law of the sea\r\n(a) Oceans and the law of the sea\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/59/62,\r\nA/59/62/Add.1, A/59/63 and A/59/126)\r\nReport of the United Nations Open-ended\r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and\r\nthe Law of the Sea at its fifth meeting\r\n(A/59/122)\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.22)\r\n(b) Sustainable fisheries, including through the\r\nAgreement for the Implementation of the\r\nProvisions of the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982\r\nrelating to the Conservation and Management\r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory\r\nFish Stocks, and related instruments\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/59/298)\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.23)\r\nMrs. Katungye (Uganda): Allow me, through the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, to thank the\r\nSecretary-General, as well as Mr. Felipe H. Paolillo\r\nand Mr. Philip D. Burgess, in their capacity as co-\r\nchairpersons of the Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, for their\r\nmost detailed, informative and analytical reports.\r\nAs we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the entry\r\ninto force of the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea, we can not help but be awed by the\r\nmilestones reached through its supplementation by\r\nStates, numerous challenges notwithstanding.\r\nAs my country has pointed out in the past, the\r\nprudent conservation and management of the oceans\r\nand seas is of great importance to us, even though we\r\nare a landlocked country. Our interest has been further\r\npiqued by the discussion on new sustainable uses of\r\noceans, including the conservation and management of\r\nthe biological diversity of seabed areas beyond national\r\njurisdiction, especially given the presence in them of\r\nunique and diverse species and ecosystems.\r\nOn the other hand, we note with concern the\r\nemerging shift by some countries from upholding the\r\nprinciple of holding all resources found in the seabed\r\nof the high seas to be for the benefit of mankind, to\r\ndebating whether or not those resources include\r\nbiological resources, such as envisaged in the\r\nConvention on Biological Diversity, with reference to\r\nperceived lacunae of the United Nations Convention on\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nthe Law of the Sea and the 1994 Agreement. We do not\r\nsee why a specific distinction should be made with\r\nrespect to deep seabed genetic resources.\r\nNevertheless, in furtherance of the common\r\nheritage of mankind, we encourage the International\r\nSeabed Authority, in partnership with States, investors\r\nand the scientific community, to continue to explore\r\nthe potential of cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts and\r\npolymetallic sulphides, while taking great caution to\r\nminimize the environmental impact arising from\r\nexploration of such mineral resources.\r\nWe also urge the exploration and bioprospecting\r\nof potential sources of medicine and other benefits\r\nderived from the biological resources of the seabed,\r\nwith these resources to be shared on an equitable basis.\r\nThe omnibus resolution encourages the\r\nintensification of efforts to build capacity and to\r\ncontinue to strengthen capacity-building activities in\r\nleast developed countries. Uganda would like to\r\nsupport the emphasis placed on targeting least\r\ndeveloped countries. Although a landlocked country,\r\nwe, too, have a stake in the management of the oceans\r\nand the seas, as enshrined in the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea and attendant\r\nagreements and other legal instruments. Further, the\r\nlessons drawn from marine research and protection\r\nregimes can be transposed to the management of large\r\ninland water bodies. As all are aware, Lake Victoria,\r\nwhich is the second-largest lake in the world, is an\r\nimportant resource for food, commerce and\r\ninternational transport in the East African region. It\r\nfaces the same challenges faced by most coastlines and\r\nseas.\r\nIn fact, the Food and Agricultural Organization of\r\nthe United Nations has been instrumental in helping us\r\nto analyse challenges and come up with relevant\r\nstrategies in promoting the sustainable use of the lake’s\r\nresources. As well, the International Maritime\r\nOrganization has, in the past, helped with study\r\nfellowships for some of our citizens. Those efforts\r\nneed to be augmented.\r\nThose two cases highlight the importance of the\r\ncontinuous involvement of all relevant United Nations\r\nprogrammes, funds, specialized agencies and other\r\norganizations in fostering the sustainable development\r\nof marine ecosystems.\r\nIn order to effectively help developing States, in\r\nparticular least developed States and small island\r\ndeveloping States, to implement the Convention, we\r\nurge all States and organizations in a position to do so\r\nto make voluntary contributions, financial or\r\notherwise, to the trust funds established under the\r\nConvention and the Agreement, as well as to the\r\nrelevant fellowship and fisheries programmes. We\r\nwould like to recognize the contribution made to those\r\nfunds by some countries, in particular Iceland this\r\nmorning.\r\nThe protection and preservation of the marine\r\nenvironment and its living marine resources are key,\r\nand we need to step up concerted efforts towards\r\neliminating or curtailing pollution and the physical\r\ndegradation of maritime ecosystems. Such protection\r\nshould take into consideration the proposals of the Plan\r\nof Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, which calls for maintaining the\r\nproductivity and the diversity of vulnerable marine and\r\ncoastal areas both within and beyond national\r\njurisdictions.\r\nFurther, in accordance with international law, we\r\nmust stem all destructive practices by vessels that\r\nadversely impact on vulnerable ecosystems. Those\r\npractices include deep-sea bottom trawling and the use\r\nof other destructive fishing gear.\r\nRegarding the issue of illegal, unreported and\r\nunregulated fishing activities, we would like to join\r\nother delegations in calling upon Member States to\r\ntake all necessary measures consistent with\r\ninternational law to prevent such unconscionable\r\npractices. We look forward to the forthcoming review\r\nconference of the United Nations Fish Stocks\r\nAgreement, which, we hope, will provide for the\r\nevaluation of the effectiveness of implementation of\r\nand participation in the Agreement. In the meantime,\r\nthe onus rests on Member States to counter, within\r\nexisting international laws, such infractions.\r\nEven more deplorable is human trafficking on the\r\nhigh seas and the smuggling of migrants, who face the\r\npossible loss of life and are subjected to health hazards\r\nand psychological trauma, among other things. States\r\nparties need to vigorously enforce the Protocol against\r\nthe Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air and\r\nthe Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish\r\nTrafficking in Persons, Especially Women and\r\nChildren, among other relevant conventions.\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nThe issue of the settlement of disputes is very\r\npertinent, and its inclusion in the omnibus resolution is\r\nwelcome. The International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea has significantly contributed to the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes, as envisioned by the\r\nConvention. Its role in interpreting and applying both\r\nthe Convention and the 1994 Agreement captures the\r\nfundamental character of the United Nations of\r\nmaintaining and strengthening international peace and\r\nsecurity. Also to be commended are the International\r\nSeabed Authority, the International Maritime\r\nOrganization and the Division for Ocean Affairs and\r\nthe Law of the Sea of the United Nations Secretariat\r\nfor their invaluable contributions in that regard.\r\nFinally, we wish to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor convening the fifth meeting of the Consultative\r\nProcess, which provided a very useful forum for\r\ndialogue and analysis and for forging common interests\r\nand goals.\r\nMr. Ozawa (Japan): At the outset, my delegation\r\nwishes to thank the coordinators of the two draft\r\nresolutions before us today. Our thanks also go to all\r\ncountries that contributed to the consultations in a\r\nspirit of cooperation and to all the staff of the Division\r\nfor Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the United\r\nNations Secretariat, which provided invaluable\r\nsupport. The Japanese Government is pleased to\r\nsponsor the draft omnibus resolution A/59/L.22, and\r\nwe hope that draft resolution A/59/L.23 on sustainable\r\nfisheries will also be adopted by consensus.\r\nToday is the tenth anniversary of the entry into\r\nforce of the United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea. Japan joins others in commemorating this\r\nanniversary, and, on this occasion, pays tribute again to\r\neveryone who worked so diligently to finalize, adopt\r\nand implement the Convention.\r\nToday, the number of member States parties to\r\nthe Convention is 145, and the number of States parties\r\nto the Agreement on the implementation of Part XI is\r\n117. We are pleased to see that these numbers are\r\ngrowing and that the Convention is becoming a more\r\nuniversal legal framework for ocean affairs.\r\nWe must note, however, that the international\r\ncommunity is facing a wide range of new issues,\r\nincluding transnational crimes, such as terrorism and\r\nillegal trafficking in drugs, and also issues relating to\r\nthe growing pressures on the marine environment.\r\nEach of the new issues needs to be addressed in a\r\nmanner that respects the spirit and provisions of the\r\nConvention, while maintaining its framework in\r\nprinciple.\r\nJapan is committed to the Convention and to the\r\norgans established under the Convention, namely, the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority, the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Commission on\r\nthe Limits of the Continental Shelf. We have actively\r\nparticipated in the work of those organs and are\r\ndetermined to contribute further to their activities.\r\nWith regard to the Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea, Japan attaches great importance to the role that the\r\nTribunal plays in the maintenance of the order and\r\nstability of the ocean. My delegation wishes to take\r\nthis opportunity to announce that Japan has decided to\r\nnominate Ambassador Shunji Yanai, the former\r\nAmbassador of Japan to the United States of America\r\nand an experienced diplomat with profound knowledge\r\nof international law, as a candidate for election as a\r\njudge of the Tribunal, at the elections to be held during\r\nthe fifteenth meeting of States parties to the\r\nConvention, scheduled for June 2005. As the largest\r\ncontributor to Convention organs in that it provides\r\n22 per cent of their budgets, Japan expresses its\r\ndetermination to continue to contribute to the activities\r\nof the Convention organs.\r\nAs for the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf, my delegation is pleased to note that\r\nProfessor Kensaku Tamaki, who was elected as a\r\nmember of the Commission in 2001, is contributing\r\nsignificantly to the work of the Commission. We\r\nrecognize that the importance of exchanging views\r\namong States in order to facilitate the preparation of\r\nsubmissions by States to the Commission is mentioned\r\nin paragraph 33 of the omnibus resolution. For that\r\npurpose, Japan wishes to demonstrate its determination\r\nto contribute further to the Commission’s work by\r\nhosting a symposium of experts in Tokyo.\r\nThe world continues to be plagued by the threats\r\nof piracy and armed robbery at sea. Of the more than\r\n400 incidents occurring annually worldwide, almost\r\nhalf of the incidents are concentrated in Asia.\r\nAs described in the omnibus resolution, Japan\r\nproposed to formulate a regional cooperation\r\nagreement on combating piracy and armed robbery\r\nagainst ships in Asia. After active negotiations over the\r\nlast three years, the final agreement was adopted on\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\n11 November of this year at the intergovernmental\r\nmeeting held in Tokyo.\r\nThat agreement will strengthen regional\r\ncooperation among maritime security organizations\r\nthrough the establishment of an information sharing\r\nsystem and a cooperative network dedicated to\r\ncombating piracy and armed robbery at sea. Japan\r\nhopes that the agreement will not only contribute to\r\nenhanced cooperation among States parties in Asia, but\r\nwill also serve as a very good example of regional\r\ncooperation. Japan is determined to continue its efforts\r\nto ensure safety for international navigation in Asia.\r\nAllow me, next, to touch upon the maritime\r\nenvironment. Surrounded by the sea on all sides, Japan\r\nconsiders the preservation of the marine environment\r\nto be extremely important, and thus, is committed to\r\nthe prevention of marine pollution at the international,\r\nregional and national levels. As a State party, not only\r\nto the United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea, but also to the Convention on the Prevention of\r\nMarine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other\r\nMatter, and the International Convention for the\r\nPrevention of Pollution from Ships, Japan is committed\r\nto the effective implementation of those conventions,\r\nand strongly urges every country that has not done so,\r\nto ratify the conventions.\r\nTo follow up on the results of the 2002 World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, the Japanese\r\nGovernment has been making efforts to contribute\r\nsignificantly to the enhancement of the ocean policies\r\nof coastal States, at the national, regional and global\r\nlevels. At the regional level, we are making steady\r\nprogress in strengthening the functioning of the\r\nsecretariat of the Northwest Pacific Action Plan.\r\nConcerning the 1996 Protocol to the Convention\r\non the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of\r\nWastes and Other Matter, Japan amended the relevant\r\nsections of its domestic law in May 2004 and is\r\npreparing to become a State party.\r\nJapan, as a responsible fishing State, and as a\r\nState party to the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea, has been earnestly addressing the\r\nconservation and management issues, as well as\r\nsustainable usage relating to marine resources,\r\nincluding straddling fish stocks and highly migratory\r\nfish stocks. Those efforts have been implemented\r\nindividually, bilaterally and multilaterally. We are\r\nseriously concerned about illegal, unreported and\r\nunregulated fishing activities — IUU fishing — and\r\nthe overcapacity issues in global fisheries, which\r\nundermine efforts aimed at the sustainable use of living\r\nmarine resources.\r\nMy Government has shown a commitment to\r\neliminating IUU fishing, in order to conserve the\r\nmarine ecosystem. Japan welcomes the initiative of the\r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United\r\nNations (FAO) to deal with those problems, including\r\nthe holding of intergovernmental technical\r\nconsultations in June and July 2004.\r\nIn that regard, we would like to stress the point\r\nthat, in discussing issues of conservation and\r\nmanagement and the sustainable use of living marine\r\nresources, we should make certain that the discussions\r\nare based on scientific evidence provided by competent\r\norganizations, such as the FAO and regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations. Those organizations have\r\nthe required specialized expertise to provide accurate\r\nassessments and they therefore offer a better forum for\r\nsuch discussions, as compared to the United Nations.\r\nIn concluding, I wish to reiterate that Japan will\r\ncontinue to contribute to the stability of the legal\r\nframework on ocean affairs, and thereby, to the\r\npromotion of prudent and equitable use of the sea by\r\nthe international community, in accordance with the\r\nConvention.\r\nMs. Sila (Samoa): As the present Chair of the\r\nPacific Islands Forum, I have the honour to speak on\r\nbehalf of those members who are represented at the\r\nUnited Nations, namely Australia, the Federated States\r\nof Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand,\r\nPalau, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of the\r\nMarshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga,\r\nTuvalu and Vanuatu.\r\nThe Pacific Islands Forum covers a region of\r\ndiverse States, including the least developed,\r\ndeveloping and developed, with varied constitutional\r\narrangements, economic links, population bases and\r\nother interests. Yet, as a group, we are collectively\r\nblessed with a vast expanse of interlocking ocean\r\nspaces, and a wealth of marine resources, woven\r\ntogether by our respective exclusive economic zones.\r\nIn that context, we share a common objective and\r\nrealize the critical value of the marine resources and\r\nenvironment in our region. We wish to ensure, as joint\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\ncustodians, the sustainable conservation and\r\nmanagement of those assets in our neighbourhood.\r\nAs we have often stated, developments in ocean\r\naffairs and the law of the sea remain of primary\r\nimportance to us. We consider the annual debate under\r\nthat agenda item, and its consequent resolutions, as\r\npart of an ongoing strengthening of the governance of\r\nthe oceans. Both resolutions enable the General\r\nAssembly, as a collective body, to take stock of the\r\nevents that have taken place in the course of the year in\r\na variety of forums, both within the United Nations\r\nsystem and beyond.\r\nIn that respect, we note the burgeoning number of\r\nissues raised in the context of the two oceans-related\r\nresolutions. While we have some concerns about the\r\nlength of the resolutions, we regard the active and lively\r\ndiscussions on the issues dealt with in them as a positive\r\nsign that Member States remain committed to pursuing\r\ninternational cooperation through the United Nations for\r\nthe proper and effective management of the global marine\r\nenvironment and its resources. We commend both\r\ncoordinators for the effective manner in which they\r\nconducted the negotiations, and the Division for Ocean\r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea for their able support and\r\norganization.\r\nOur group has continued to value the primacy of\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\nas the constitutional framework of the oceans and seas.\r\nIt is gratifying to witness the evolution and successful\r\nfunctioning of its subsidiary bodies, especially the\r\nwork and decisions this year of the Meeting of States\r\nParties, as well as critical work of the International\r\nSeabed Authority and the Commission on the Limits of\r\nthe Continental Shelf. The increasing number of new\r\nStates parties to the Convention and its related\r\ninstruments this year serves as a reminder of the\r\nConvention’s relevance, maturity and growing\r\nuniversality. We support all continuing efforts by this\r\nOrganization to encourage Member States to join the\r\nConvention and its related agreements.\r\nWe continue to strongly support the work and\r\nrole of the United Nations Open-ended Informal\r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the\r\nSea. We were pleased to see that once again the\r\nrecommendations from the Consultative Process\r\noffered a strong contribution to focus and expedite\r\ndebate and negotiations under this item. Equally, we\r\nwere gratified that those recommendations did not\r\nhamstring this year’s negotiations on the omnibus and\r\nfisheries resolutions.\r\nWe continue to view the Informal Consultative\r\nProcess as an opportunity for frank discussion on\r\nissues of practical import, which can be used to inform\r\nand expedite substantive debate during the General\r\nAssembly. In our view, the Process continues to prove\r\nits worth as a flexible, interactive and integrated forum\r\non oceans. The Pacific Islands Forum looks forward to\r\nre-endorsement of the mandate of the Consultative\r\nProcess next year, for a further term. In addition, we\r\nare well satisfied that discussions at the sixth meeting\r\nof the Consultative Process next year will focus on the\r\ntopic, “Fisheries and its contribution to sustainable\r\ndevelopment”.\r\nWe also look forward to the substantive work of\r\nthe inter-agency coordination mechanism, UN Oceans,\r\ngetting under way in the near future. We hope that the\r\noperation of this mechanism will draw together the\r\nvarious threads of work of the agencies and institutions\r\ninvolved in oceans issues and thereby complement the\r\nbenefits of integration that the Consultative Process\r\nalready provides.\r\nOur group is pleased that the Assistance Fund\r\nestablished under Part VII of the 1995 Fish Stocks\r\nAgreement is now operational. In particular, we\r\nrecognize the importance to small island developing\r\nStates of capacity-building to implement both the\r\nConvention and the Agreement. The framework\r\nestablished by the Assistance Fund represents a\r\nconcrete opportunity for small island developing States\r\nto that end and for the advancement of their fisheries\r\naspirations generally — but only if Member States take\r\nup the invitation to make voluntary contributions to the\r\nFund. We are pleased, therefore, that renewed priority\r\nwas given this year to capacity-building and trust funds\r\nand fellowships. We hope that this outcome in the\r\ncontext of the omnibus resolution is transformed into\r\ngenerous action by Member States in the coming year.\r\nIn terms of regional implementation of the\r\nConvention and the Agreement, we are delighted to\r\ninform the Assembly that the Convention on the\r\nConservation and Management of Highly Migratory\r\nFish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean\r\nentered into force on 19 June this year. Since that date,\r\nseveral additional commitments to the Convention\r\nhave been received and we welcome efforts by other\r\nimportant States towards ratification and accession in\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nthe near future. We look forward to the first meeting, in\r\nDecember this year, of the Western and Central Pacific\r\nTuna Commission, established under the regional\r\nConvention, and to ongoing positive and cooperative\r\nrelationships with all fishing nations in the context of\r\nthis important regional institution. We continue to urge\r\nother distant-water fishing nations with a real fisheries\r\ninterest in our region to work towards becoming a\r\nparty to this Convention.\r\nWe take this opportunity to refer to the Pacific\r\nIslands Forum Regional Oceans Policy, which our\r\nleaders approved in 2002. It elaborates guiding\r\nprinciples that serve as a template for members in our\r\ngroup to develop national ocean policies.\r\nAt the Pacific Islands Regional Oceans Forum\r\nheld in Fiji in February this year, representatives from\r\nour countries, as well as oceans experts, discussed the\r\nkey oceans issues confronting us and worked on\r\ndeveloping an implementation process for our Regional\r\nOceans Policy. The result of this work is a Framework\r\nfor Integrated Strategic Action — in other words, an\r\naction plan for integrated implementation of our\r\nOceans Policy in the region. The Framework was\r\nendorsed by Pacific Islands Forum leaders in August\r\nthis year. We are proud of these achievements, which\r\nwe believe will ensure sustainable use of the ocean and\r\nits resources in our region by Pacific Islands\r\ncommunities and others into the future.\r\nOur Framework for Strategic Action will be\r\npresented in Mauritius in January 2005 at the\r\nInternational Meeting to Review the Implementation of\r\nthe Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. We\r\nlook forward to the opportunity that Meeting will\r\nprovide, as well as other future opportunities, to\r\ndiscuss oceans and fisheries issues of critical\r\nimportance to small island developing States.\r\nWe have followed closely this year’s developments\r\nin the two oceans-related draft resolutions, including, and\r\nin particular, issues relating to bottom-trawling,\r\nprotection of marine biodiversity and illegal, unregulated\r\nand unreported (IUU) fishing.\r\nComing from a region that has a high\r\nconcentration of vulnerable marine ecosystems,\r\nincluding coral reefs and underwater seamounts, we are\r\nwell aware of, and firmly support, the need to take\r\nurgent action to prevent and manage the effects of\r\ndestructive fishing practices, including bottom-\r\ntrawling, that have adverse impacts on vulnerable\r\nmarine ecosystems. In that context, we were pleased\r\nthat all States were able to reach agreement on a\r\npackage of short-, medium- and longer-term responses\r\nto problems caused by those practices. We will be sure\r\nto take the necessary action in our own region in that\r\nregard and will welcome further discussion next year\r\nof progress around the globe.\r\nWe also welcome the decision this year to\r\nestablish a new open-ended ad hoc informal working\r\ngroup on marine biodiversity beyond national\r\njurisdiction. There is a clear need to establish a forum\r\nwhere the gamut of issues relating to governance,\r\nconservation and management of marine resources and\r\nenvironment beyond national jurisdiction can be\r\nopenly and constructively discussed and where options\r\nfor a coordinated international response can be\r\ndeveloped. It is critical that all States have an equal\r\nopportunity to participate in these discussions, given\r\nthe significance of the subject matter. We certainly plan\r\nto endeavour to participate actively and constructively\r\nin accordance with our primary interest in oceans and\r\nlaw of the sea matters.\r\nFinally, Pacific Islands Forum members continue\r\nto view IUU fishing as one of the greatest threats to the\r\nfuture sustainability of our regional marine resources\r\nand environment. We stand in firm support of the need\r\nto take urgent action against such fishing activities and\r\ncommit ourselves to work, particularly within the\r\ncontext of our new regional organization, to do\r\neverything possible to rid our region of IUU fishing.\r\nWe continue to urge our partners to cooperate with us\r\nin achieving that goal.\r\nMr. Maquieira (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I am\r\ngoing to make my statement in English owing to the\r\nfact that some of the countries I am going to speak\r\nabout are English-speaking countries.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI have the honour to speak on behalf of 16 States,\r\nnamely: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica,\r\nDominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador,\r\nGuatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua,\r\nPanama, Paraguay and Uruguay.\r\nFor the States Parties to the 1982 United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, the celebration of\r\nthe tenth anniversary of its entry into force is\r\nparticularly significant. After a decade, the Convention\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nhas demonstrated itself to be one of the most visionary\r\nmilestones of the United Nations. The General\r\nAssembly has rightly reaffirmed the unified character\r\nof the Convention and the need to maintain its\r\nintegrity. At the same time, the States parties to the\r\nConvention are aware that it has to be understood\r\nagainst the background of an ever-evolving context\r\ndetermined to a large extent by the dynamic progress in\r\nthe field of marine scientific research and marine\r\ntechnology.\r\nThe current debate is also significant due to the\r\nimportant work and debates at the fifth meeting of the\r\nUnited Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea; both draft\r\nresolutions on this agenda item launch processes in\r\nrelation to the conservation and sustainable use of\r\nmarine biodiversity beyond areas of national\r\njurisdiction.\r\nThe conservation and sustainable management of\r\nmarine biodiversity, including the protection of marine\r\nvulnerable ecosystems located beyond the limits of\r\nnational jurisdiction, has been at the forefront of the\r\nconcerns of the international community in recent\r\nyears. We have witnessed this, not only in the context\r\nof the General Assembly work relating to oceans, but\r\nalso in other forums like the International Seabed\r\nAuthority, and the Conference of the Parties to the\r\nConvention on Biological Diversity, just to mention\r\ntwo.\r\nDecision VII/5, the latest decision on marine and\r\ncoastal biological diversity of the Conference of the\r\nParties to the Convention on Biological Diversity,\r\ndevoted much attention to the question of marine\r\nbiodiversity beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\r\nUndoubtedly, the work of that body has served as a\r\nguide for launching a set of processes reflected in the\r\ndraft resolutions before us.\r\nThe dramatic developments and discoveries in the\r\nfield of marine scientific research in recent years have\r\nshifted our understanding of marine living organisms\r\nin the deep sea beyond national jurisdiction. The\r\ninternational community has come to understand the\r\nkey importance of marine biodiversity to the overall\r\necology of the planet and its current and potential\r\ncontributions to sustainable development. Conservation\r\nand sustainable use of marine biodiversity are vital;\r\nhowever, our understanding of the various\r\nmultidisciplinary issues related to biodiversity in the\r\nhigh seas and the international seabed area remains\r\nfragmentary. We need integral, interdisciplinary and\r\nintersectoral approaches to deal with oceans issues.\r\nFinally, the problems of ocean space are closely\r\ninterrelated and need to be considered as a whole.\r\nIn that regard, we welcome the establishment of\r\nan open-ended ad hoc informal working group to study\r\nissues related to the conservation and sustainable use\r\nof marine biological diversity beyond areas of national\r\njurisdiction. We look forward to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, which will assist the working group\r\nin preparing its agenda. We encourage States to provide\r\ntheir input and their knowledge on matters to be\r\nexamined by the working group.\r\nWe are conscious of the adverse impact on the\r\nmarine ecosystems and the stocks of some fish, as a\r\nresult of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, as\r\nit is stated in detail in the draft resolution on\r\nsustainable fisheries. We are convinced of the\r\nrelevance of the actions that the draft recommends,\r\nincluding regional and subregional cooperation, and we\r\nconsider they must be implemented in accordance to\r\nthe International Plan of Action of the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)\r\nto prevent, combat and eliminate illegal, unreported\r\nand unregulated fishing.\r\nWe are also concerned by the adverse impact of\r\ndestructive practices on marine vulnerable ecosystems\r\nlocated beyond national jurisdiction, in particular, high\r\nseas bottom trawling. We are well aware of the\r\ndevastating effects of such practices on the marine\r\necosystems.\r\nThere is a general obligation to protect and\r\npreserve the marine environment, including rare or\r\nfragile ecosystems. In this regard, we are aware that\r\nthe precautionary principle calls for urgent action.\r\nTherefore, we appreciate the steps provided for in the\r\ndraft resolution on sustainable fisheries calling upon\r\nStates or regional fisheries management organizations\r\nto consider interim prohibitions of destructive fishing\r\npractices in vulnerable marine ecosystems of the high\r\nseas. In this respect, we look forward to the discussions\r\nof these issues next year, with a view to reviewing the\r\nmeasures taken in accordance with the draft resolution\r\nin two years time.\r\nWe encourage all States to give serious\r\nconsideration to the full implementation of the\r\nmeasures prescribed in the text to eliminate destructive\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nfishing practices on the high seas in order to make it a\r\nmeaningful process for the benefit of present and\r\nfuture generations.\r\nWe understand that the measures called for in the\r\ndraft resolution are fully consistent with the\r\nConvention and international law, and particularly with\r\nthe rights and obligations of coastal States within areas\r\nof national jurisdiction.\r\nWe also note that in this year’s draft resolution on\r\nfisheries the conservation and management of sharks\r\nhas again been mentioned. We are convinced of the\r\nneed to fully implement the FAO International Plan of\r\nAction for the Conservation and Management of\r\nSharks and to take urgent measures at the national level\r\nor, as appropriate, at the regional level, to avoid the\r\npractice of shark finning.\r\nWe consider that capacity-building is crucial in\r\norder for developing countries to be able to fully\r\nimplement the law of the sea framework and the\r\nvarious actions called for in the draft resolutions.\r\nTherefore, we acknowledge the critical role of regional\r\ninitiatives in this regard.\r\nIn that context, we appreciate the operation of the\r\nAssistance Fund of the Conference on Maritime\r\nDelimitation in the Caribbean, intended to facilitate\r\ntechnical assistance in this field. We encourage States\r\nand private entities in a position to do so to contribute\r\nto this Fund.\r\nWe also would like to commend the International\r\nSeabed Authority for the preparation of a\r\ncomprehensive and outstanding 10-year report on the\r\noccasion of the tenth anniversary of the establishment\r\nof the Authority. We highly appreciate the work of the\r\nAuthority towards the implementation of its mandate.\r\nWe also attach priority importance to the\r\nestablishment of a regular process for global reporting\r\nand assessment of the state of the marine environment,\r\nincluding socio-economic aspects. We recognize the\r\nurgent need to launch the preparatory stage towards its\r\nestablishment in line with the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation and General Assembly resolutions\r\n57/141 and 58/240.\r\nWe consider that maritime transport of\r\nradioactive materials and hazardous waste requires\r\neffective prevention and liability regulations to\r\nsufficiently guarantee the safety of coastal States. We\r\nare concerned in particular by the use of the oceans and\r\nseas off our coasts as routes for the transportation of\r\nradioactive waste, and that is why we regret the\r\nattitude of some shipping countries that do not provide\r\nadequate information on such shipments and their\r\nroutes in a timely manner. For that reason, we highlight\r\nthe approval by the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency in March 2004 of the Action Plan for the\r\nSafety of Transport of Radioactive Material.\r\nWe appreciate all reports of the Secretary-General\r\nunder this agenda item. However, with regard to\r\ndocument A/59/62, we are convinced that any\r\ncommercially oriented activities involving the\r\nbiological diversity of the Area are ruled by the\r\nprinciples embodied in the Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea and the Convention on Biological Diversity.\r\nTherefore, the biological diversity in the deep seabed\r\nbeyond national jurisdiction, as part of the Area, is part\r\nof the common heritage of humankind. The access to\r\nits genetic resources should be subject to the sharing of\r\nbenefits, taking into account equity and the objective\r\napproach of marine scientific research.\r\nFinally, we would like to thank Mr. Marcos\r\nAlmeida of Brazil and Ms. Jennifer McIver of New\r\nZealand for the coordination of the oceans resolution.\r\nOur thanks go also to Ms. Holly Koehler of the United\r\nStates for her coordination of the sustainable fisheries\r\nresolution. Our appreciation goes to the Co-Chairs of\r\nthe fifth Meeting of the Informal Consultative Process,\r\nAmbassador Felipe Paolillo of Uruguay and Mr. Philip\r\nBurgess of Australia. Lastly, we would like to thank\r\nMr. Vladimir Golitsyn and the team of the Division for\r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for the high\r\nquality performance of their responsibilities.\r\nMr. Navoti (Fiji): My delegation associates itself\r\nfully with the statement presented earlier by the\r\nrepresentative of Samoa on behalf of the Pacific Island\r\nForum members.\r\nAs the Assembly has heard, for those of us in the\r\nPacific the ocean is vital and important. It dominates\r\nour lives both in terms of livelihood and economic\r\nadvancement. The health and stewardship of the ocean\r\nare of critical importance; the sustainable and\r\nresponsible utilization of its resources, both within and\r\noutside national jurisdiction, is crucial in insuring the\r\nintergenerational enjoyment of its many benefits.\r\nOver the years, the General Assembly has been\r\ngiving growing attention to the issues that affect\r\noceans and fisheries. The promulgation of the United\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which\r\nprovides the legal framework for all our deliberations\r\non the oceans and the law of the sea, is without doubt\r\none of the biggest and most historic achievements of\r\nthe United Nations. It is the first and only\r\ncomprehensive treaty in the field of the law of the sea\r\nthat contains both codified rules of customary law and\r\na number of innovations, covering all uses not only of\r\noceans and seas, but also of their superjacent air space\r\nand subjacent seabed and subsoil.\r\nWhile acknowledging the lead role of the United\r\nNations in this area, Fiji, for its part, stands united with\r\nother Pacific Islands Forum member States in\r\nsafeguarding our ocean heritage, as it is indeed a\r\ntreasure not only for us, but also for all of humanity.\r\nProtecting the Pacific Ocean and its resources has\r\nalways been central to Fiji’s policy. For the first time,\r\nthe countries of the South Pacific are cooperating to\r\ndraft a comprehensive ocean policy that will have a\r\nlarge bearing on the region’s future. We are using all\r\nour abilities and skills to enlist whatever assistance we\r\ncan to make sure all countries in the region receive the\r\nmaximum return from the regional tuna fisheries. This\r\nhas major international significance because it is the\r\nlargest remaining sustainable source of a seafood\r\ncommodity that is essential for the global market.\r\nFiji thanks those countries that are working with\r\nour region to help us get a just and equitable return\r\nfrom these important resources. We express particular\r\nthanks to the United States for its regional fisheries\r\ntreaty with certain Pacific Island nations, including\r\nFiji. Our islands have entered a new phase of\r\ncooperation in the tuna industry through the Western\r\nand Central Pacific Tuna Convention, which came into\r\neffect in June.\r\nMy delegation is very mindful of the importance\r\nof the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation in relation\r\nto fisheries, in particular the commitment made therein\r\nto restore depleted fish stocks on an urgent basis and,\r\nwhere possible, not later than 2015. The wide\r\napplication of the precautionary approach and\r\necosystem approach to the conservation, management\r\nand exploitation of fish stocks, including straddling\r\nand highly migratory fish stocks, is of utmost\r\nimportance, and we therefore welcome the call\r\ncontained in this year’s draft resolution on fisheries for\r\nStates to cooperate towards that end.\r\nSurrounded by a massive and almost unpoliceable\r\nocean, Fiji, like most of its Pacific neighbours, admits\r\nthat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing\r\nremains one of the greatest threats to marine\r\necosystems. If that practice is allowed to continue\r\nwithout setting up appropriate measures to combat it, it\r\nwill continue to have serious and major implications\r\nfor the conservation and management of ocean\r\nresources. We support the call in the fisheries draft\r\nresolution for States, subregional and regional fisheries\r\norganizations and management to fully comply with all\r\nexisting obligations and to combat IUU fishing and to\r\nurgently take all necessary steps to implement the Food\r\nand Agriculture Organization’s International Plan of\r\nAction to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal,\r\nUnreported and Unregulated Fishing.\r\nWe cannot overemphasize the importance of\r\nresponsible fisheries in marine ecosystems. Fiji, like\r\nmany other Member States, is delighted at the\r\ninclusion in this year’s draft resolution of a call for\r\nurgent action towards the putting in place an interim\r\nprohibition of destructive fishing practices, including\r\nbottom-trawling, which have an adverse impact on\r\nvulnerable marine ecosystems, including seamounts,\r\nhydrothermal vents and cold-water corals located\r\nbeyond national jurisdiction.\r\nWe are particularly pleased to note the further\r\ncall for members of regional fisheries management\r\norganizations or arrangements without the competence\r\nto regulate bottom fisheries to expand their competence\r\nto address the impact of destructive fishing practices,\r\nincluding bottom trawling, and to ensure compliance\r\nwith such measures. Since our region was among those\r\nwhich were the most vocal in calling for a global\r\nmoratorium on bottom trawling, and because our\r\nregional fisheries organization lacked such\r\ncompetence, the inclusion of such a call now is indeed\r\na major victory.\r\nWe welcome the recognition of bottom trawling\r\nas a fishing practice that poses a potential threat to\r\nmarine ecosystems and welcome the call for short-,\r\nmedium- and long-term actions against that practice.\r\nFiji looks forward to the next report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in particular the section on the actions taken\r\nby States and regional fisheries management\r\norganizations giving effect to the call for the regulation\r\nof bottom trawling.\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nBoth of this year’s draft resolutions on fisheries\r\nand the oceans, as in the past, give prominence to the\r\nissue of capacity-building. Member States, like the\r\noceans, have differing depths in their ability to\r\nparticipate and fulfil their obligations under the\r\nConvention. We support the call for States and\r\ninternational financial institutions to continue to\r\nstrengthen capacity-building activities in the field of\r\nmarine scientific research, and we welcome recent\r\ncapacity-building initiatives such as those of the\r\nNippon Foundation of Japan and the Hamilton Shirley\r\nAmerasinghe Memorial Fellowship programme.\r\nMy country is fortunate to have been a\r\nbeneficiary of the capacity-building initiatives and\r\nassistance provided by the United Nations and other\r\norganizations in matters related to the law of the sea.\r\nFor that, we are grateful.\r\nFiji is acutely aware of the time period identified\r\nin the Convention for submissions on the establishment\r\nof the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond 200\r\nnautical miles. We note that the Commission on the\r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf has begun its\r\nconsideration of the first submissions to be received so\r\nfar. For our part, we are now working together with\r\nregional organizations to explore ways of fulfilling our\r\nobligations in that regard.\r\nWe welcome the decision contained in the draft\r\nresolution on the oceans and the law of the sea to\r\nestablish an ad-hoc open-ended informal working\r\ngroup to study issues relating to the conservation and\r\nsustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond\r\nareas of national jurisdiction. We commend the idea\r\nbehind that initiative, and my delegation stands ready\r\nto participate cooperatively with others in the ensuing\r\ndiscussions. We hope that, ultimately, appropriate and\r\npossible options and approaches to promote\r\ninternational cooperation and coordination for the\r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological\r\ndiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction will be\r\ntaken.\r\nIn conclusion, Fiji commends the work of the\r\nSixth Committee in formulating this year’s draft\r\nresolutions. Active participation and a constructive\r\nspirit of compromise will indeed have decisively\r\ncontributed to its success. Fiji also commends the\r\nSecretariat and the Division for Ocean Affairs and the\r\nLaw of the Sea for their valuable work on oceans,\r\nfisheries and law of the sea matters.\r\nMr. Nakayama (Federated States of Micronesia):\r\nMy remarks will be brief, but their brevity does not\r\ndiminish my delegation’s concerns with respect to the\r\nagenda item under consideration. Those concerns are\r\ndeeply held.\r\nMicronesia agrees and fully associates itself with\r\nthe statement delivered earlier by the representative of\r\nSamoa on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum group.\r\nMy delegation is grateful for the comprehensive\r\nannual report on oceans and the law of the sea\r\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General. We also thank the\r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for\r\nthe important work they carry out in this area and for\r\ntheir unwavering support in facilitating the work of the\r\ninformal negotiations. I must also refer with gratitude\r\nto the dedicated efforts of so many delegations.\r\nNaturally, we must give special thanks to Brazil, the\r\nUnited States and New Zealand as coordinators of the\r\ndraft resolutions before the Assembly.\r\nMy delegation is not in unfamiliar territory in\r\nspeaking here today on this subject. We know too well\r\nthe significant role that the oceans play in the lives of\r\nour people. Micronesia, a developing nation, is an\r\nocean State. Micronesian history began in the days\r\nwhen man explored the seas in rafts and canoes. The\r\nseas bring us together; they do not separate us. Our\r\noceans sustain us. Their resources enrich us. Our\r\npeople continue to rely on the bounties of the ocean for\r\nsustenance and economic development.\r\nExperience has shown us that the state of ocean\r\naffairs, to put it plainly, remains precarious. The\r\nindiscriminate destruction of ocean resources\r\ncontinues. For example, large-scale pelagic drift-net\r\nfishing, while generally on the decline, remains a threat\r\nto marine living resources.\r\nThe continuing shipment of plutonium and\r\nradioactive wastes through our exclusive economic\r\nzones remains of great concern. Our Pacific Ocean is a\r\nvital breadbasket for the entire planet. Any\r\ntransshipment accident could have a serious impact on\r\nthe livelihood of our peoples and our economies and\r\nwould be felt far beyond our shores for many\r\ngenerations to come.\r\nUnauthorized fishing in zones of national\r\njurisdiction and on the high seas and illegal, unreported\r\nand unregulated fishing continue to be of concern.\r\nMicronesia has a vast, exclusive economic zone rich in\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nfish resources. Like all small developing Pacific island\r\nStates, we simply cannot act alone to manage and\r\nmonitor illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in\r\nareas under our national jurisdiction. We require the\r\ncooperation of other States to take greater enforcement\r\nmeasures to ensure that their vessels do not engage in\r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. States must\r\nalso ensure that even when their vessels are authorized\r\nto fish in areas of national jurisdiction, they comply\r\nfaithfully with the terms of that authorization.\r\nOf increasingly serious concern is the threat to\r\nmarine habitats and the adverse impact on vulnerable\r\nmarine ecosystems caused by deep-sea trawling.\r\nBecause it occurs at great depths and in areas beyond\r\nnational jurisdictions, some may still not take this\r\nthreat seriously. It is also fair to say that as science\r\nlearns more about the impact of deep-sea trawling on\r\nmarine biodiversity, the problem will become more\r\nobvious. The seventh meeting of the Conference of the\r\nParties to the Convention on Biological Diversity\r\nexplicitly called on the United Nations to take action.\r\nAlthough we realize that the issue will continue to be\r\ndebated for years, we strongly fear that time is not on\r\nour side. The precautionary principle should guide our\r\ndeliberations in addressing our concerns on this\r\nsubject.\r\nPreparing a submission to establish its extended\r\ncontinental shelf is a difficult task for a country such as\r\nmine, even within the extended time frame. In the case\r\nof Micronesia, we lack the basic capacity and the\r\nexpertise necessary to acquire and collate the highly\r\ncomplex scientific data required for submission. That\r\nproblem is further exacerbated by the lack of financial\r\nresources to actually get the work done. Without\r\ntargeted assistance from the donor community, we will\r\nfind it extremely difficult to make the required\r\nsubmission to the Commission.\r\nMy delegation is most gratified to note the\r\nsignificant achievements made at the regional level\r\nwithin the context of the Fish Stocks Agreement under\r\nthe Convention on the Law of the Sea. This year, the\r\nPacific region welcomed the entry into force of the\r\nConvention on the Conservation and Management of\r\nHighly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and\r\nCentral Pacific Ocean. The Convention is testament to\r\nour regional commitment and to the cooperative\r\napproach adopted by coastal States and distant-water\r\nfishing nations towards sustainable conservation and\r\nmanagement of our valuable fish stocks. We call on\r\nStates and entities that participated in the process of\r\nestablishing the Convention to assign high priority to\r\ncooperating fully in its administration.\r\nMy delegation is most humbled by the decision to\r\nmake the Federated States of Micronesia the host of the\r\nWestern and Central Pacific Tuna Commission,\r\nestablished under the regional convention. My country\r\nlooks forward to hosting the final preparatory\r\nconference for the establishment of the Commission\r\nand the inaugural session of the Commission. Those\r\nmeetings will be held consecutively early next month\r\nin our capital.\r\nMr. Hahn Myung-jae (Republic of Korea): At\r\nthe outset, allow me to express my gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive and\r\ninformative report on oceans and the law of the sea\r\n(A/59/62). I also thank Mr. Marcos de Almeida of\r\nBrazil and Ms. Holly Koehler of the United States for\r\ntheir excellent work in coordinating the two draft\r\nresolutions, A/59/L.22 and L.23. In addition, we thank\r\nthe staff of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law\r\nof the Sea for their hard work and invaluable assistance\r\nto Member States, and also thank Division Director\r\nVladimir Golitsyn.\r\nToday we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the\r\nentry into force of the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea. With 145 States parties, the\r\nConvention continues to solidify its status as the\r\nessential constitution for the oceans and the sea. We\r\nurge those States that have not yet done so to become\r\nparty to the Convention at the earliest possible date so\r\nthat we may achieve the collective goal of universality.\r\nThe oceans and the seas are an invaluable\r\nresource for humankind’s welfare, providing food,\r\nmineral resources and a means of trade and\r\ntransportation. Unfortunately, serious misuse of the\r\noceans and the seas continues to threaten their health.\r\nToday, trafficking in weapons of mass destruction,\r\nnarcotics and even humans through maritime transport\r\nis of grave concern to the international community. My\r\nGovernment supports and will actively participate in\r\nefforts to maintain peace and security on all the seas of\r\nthe world.\r\nThe Republic of Korea is party to the Convention\r\nfor the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the\r\nSafety of Maritime Navigation and its Protocol.\r\nMoreover, we actively participate in the International\r\nMaritime Organization’s ongoing review of those\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\ninstruments as part of its efforts to strengthen the\r\nmeans of combating such unlawful acts, including\r\nterrorism at sea. In order to further improve maritime\r\nsecurity, we believe that flag States and port States\r\nmust intensify cooperation to ensure safe navigation,\r\nincluding taking measures to eliminate the persistent\r\nprevalence of piracy and armed robbery at sea.\r\nThe Republic of Korea welcomes the adoption by\r\nthe International Maritime Organization of\r\namendments to the 1973 International Convention for\r\nthe Prevention of Pollution from Ships. The Korean\r\nGovernment is currently implementing measures to\r\nensure protection of the ocean environment, including\r\nthe establishment of a phase-out scheme for 86 single-\r\nhull tankers, 45 of which are used to carry heavy-grade\r\nfuel oil. In that regard, we urge flag and port States to\r\ntake appropriate measures to prevent the operation of\r\nsub-standard vessels.\r\nMy Government has enacted a law on controlling\r\npollutant discharges to the coast from land-based\r\nsources, and we are implementing an across-the-board\r\nmarine environment policy to improve seawater quality\r\nand preserve the ecosystem in the areas within our\r\nnational jurisdiction.\r\nFurthermore, we are expanding regional\r\ncollaboration with China, Japan and Russia, among\r\nothers, through the Northwest Pacific Action Plan and\r\nthe Partnership in Environmental Management for the\r\nSeas of East Asia. The Republic of Korea remains\r\ncommitted to expanding and strengthening its efforts to\r\nprotect and preserve the marine environment in the\r\nregion and beyond.\r\nOn the global front, the Republic of Korea\r\nwelcomes the recent progress in the establishment of\r\nthe Global Marine Assessment. At the same time we\r\nunderscore that, in the light of the serious degradation\r\nof the marine environment, the Global Marine\r\nAssessment must exert focused and well-calibrated\r\nefforts to take concrete measures under article 200 of\r\nthe Convention on the Law of the Sea to counter the\r\noceans’ physical degradation and pollution.\r\nWe also support the International Seabed\r\nAuthority’s work to protect the marine environment,\r\nconserve the natural resources of the Area and\r\nminimize damage to the flora and fauna that may result\r\nfrom prospecting and exploration for mineral resources\r\nin the area.\r\nThe Republic of Korea is engaged in various\r\nactivities at the national, subregional, regional and\r\nglobal levels to uphold and implement the provisions\r\nof the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation on\r\nsustainable fisheries. Efforts to eliminate illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated fishing are being\r\nundertaken with the utmost determination. Moreover,\r\nas party to the Compliance Agreement, the Republic of\r\nKorea is taking a strong stance on regulating the\r\nactivities of vessels flying its flag, in order to ensure\r\neffective marine conservation and management.\r\nWe also note that there is a danger that deep sea\r\nbottom-trawling may irreversibly damage the sensitive\r\nand delicate deep-sea environment. We underscore the\r\nneed to improve our understanding and knowledge of\r\nthe deep sea, especially its biodiversity and\r\necosystems. In that regard, we would like to point out\r\nthe need to step up marine scientific research activities\r\nregarding deep-sea biodiversity in accordance with the\r\nLaw of the Sea Convention. We are of the view that the\r\nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and relevant\r\nregional fisheries management organizations should\r\nplay the main role in the conservation and the\r\nsustainable use of fishery resources and the protection\r\nof deep-sea biodiversity. We therefore urge the FAO\r\nand other relevant regional fisheries management\r\norganizations to seriously take up the issue.\r\nFinally, we welcome the establishment of the\r\nOceans and Coastal Areas Network (UN-Oceans) as a\r\nmuch needed inter-agency coordination mechanism on\r\noceans and coastal issues. We have high hopes that the\r\nvarious United Nations organizations and other\r\ninternational bodies will actively engage in UN-\r\nOceans.\r\nMr. Rahman (Bangladesh): It is a matter of great\r\njoy for all of us to be celebrating today, 16 November,\r\nthe tenth anniversary of the entry into force of the 1982\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. My\r\ndelegation is pleased to see that the Convention, which\r\nis rightly considered to be the constitution of the seas\r\nand oceans, has almost achieved universality, with 145\r\nStates parties. We also note the successful holding of\r\nthe fourteenth Meeting of States Parties in June 2004.\r\nTherefore now is an opportune moment for us to assess\r\nthe progress made and to set our future goals.\r\nBangladesh attaches particular importance to the\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea as the agreed legal\r\nframework for all peaceful uses of the seas and oceans.\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nThe Convention defines the limits of territorial waters,\r\nnational zones and the continental shelf. It also\r\nguarantees the freedom of navigation beyond the\r\nterritorial sea and the right of passage through the\r\nterritorial sea, international straits and archipelagic\r\nwaters. We remain committed to full implementation of\r\nthe Convention.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, Bangladesh is a\r\ncoastal country inhabited by a nation with seafaring\r\ntraditions. The sea, therefore, plays a vital role in our\r\nlives. There is no denying the fact that the Convention\r\nis one of the most significant developments in the\r\nevolution of the concept of the exclusive economic\r\nzone. The Convention has attributed sovereign rights to\r\nthe coastal States over the living and non-living\r\nresources within the exclusive economic zone in a\r\njurisdictional framework.\r\nAs a State party to the Convention, Bangladesh\r\nhas remained deeply committed to its provisions. Since\r\nratifying the Convention in 2001 we have been taking\r\nthe necessary measures at the national level to update\r\nour legislation in that regard. We will continue to work\r\nwith others in ensuring a fair share for all of the\r\noceanic resources under the framework of the\r\nConvention.\r\nThe offshore areas of Bangladesh and our\r\nexclusive economic zone are among the richest in the\r\nworld in terms of biodiversity and energy potential.\r\nHowever, that treasure trove of natural resources is\r\nbeing seriously threatened by increasing pollution,\r\ncaused both by land-based activities and by ocean-\r\ngoing vessels. Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to\r\nthe effects of a major oil spill, which could pollute\r\nlarge areas of the coastline and destroy the livelihood\r\nof thousands of inhabitants of the coastal belt. The\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea contains detailed\r\nprovisions for both the management and control of\r\npollution, as well as for maritime scientific research\r\nand environmental protection. Bangladesh calls for\r\nenhanced international cooperation for capacity-\r\nbuilding in the areas of combating and controlling\r\npollution and promoting environmental protection and\r\ncoastal management.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that the\r\nprincipal objective of an ecosystem-based approach to\r\nfisheries management should be directed towards\r\nmitigating the impacts of fishing on marine ecosystems\r\nwhile maintaining fishing as a viable economic\r\nactivity. Bangladesh considers it important to forge\r\ngreater international cooperation in long-term\r\nconservation, management and sustainable use of\r\nmarine living resources of the world’s oceans and seas.\r\nWe also remain deeply committed to combating illegal\r\nfishing, piracy and other crimes at sea.\r\nThe 1982 Convention provides for the\r\nexploration and exploitation of the riches of the deep\r\nsea beyond the limits of national jurisdiction as the\r\ncommon heritage of humankind. All countries,\r\ndeveloped and developing, can benefit from nature’s\r\nbounty. We hope that the United Nations Open-ended\r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law\r\nof the Sea will ensure that the benefits derived from the\r\nexploration and exploitation of this common heritage\r\nof humankind are fairly shared by all.\r\nWe believe that the capacity-building of the\r\nStates parties to the Convention constitutes an essential\r\nelement, particularly for the developing countries, to\r\nenable a more active part in the management and\r\nconservation of marine resources. We agree with the\r\nSecretary-General’s observation that there is an\r\nincreasing need for capacity-building in developing\r\ncountries, in particular with respect to the preparation\r\nof submissions to the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf.\r\nBangladesh welcomes the establishment of\r\nseveral trust funds and assistance programmes under\r\nthe Convention in that regard. Such funds would help\r\nthe developing countries, including Bangladesh, build\r\ntheir capacity for sustainable exploration and\r\nexploitation of marine resources. Technical assistance\r\nmay take such forms as training on legal issues,\r\nassistance in preparation of national submissions\r\nregarding delineation of the continental shelf, joint\r\nsurveys for coastal and seabed mapping and surveys of\r\nmarine resources.\r\nMy delegation thanks the Secretary-General for\r\nhis report; it is indeed a useful document to chart our\r\nfuture programmes. We would also like to place on\r\nrecord our appreciation for the institutions established\r\nby the Convention — the International Tribunal for the\r\nLaw of the Sea, the International Seabed Authority and\r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate my\r\ndelegation’s hope for our common endeavours towards\r\nthe betterment of all our peoples through a fair and\r\nsustainable exploitation of marine resources.\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nMr. Kupchyshyn (Ukraine): This year’s debate is\r\nespecially notable as it marks the tenth anniversary of\r\nthe entry into force of the 1982 United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. Ukraine is firmly\r\ncommitted to the Convention, which represents a\r\nsignificant achievement by the international\r\ncommunity, as well as important testimony to United\r\nNations efforts to codify and develop international law.\r\nIts importance is even more evident today. The\r\nConvention has proved to be not only a charter within\r\nwhich all activities related to oceans and seas should\r\nbe carried out, but also a basis for a comprehensive\r\nsystem of economic and political cooperation in\r\nmarine-related matters.\r\nAs a country actively participating in the\r\ninternational community’s efforts to preserve the\r\nmarine environment and to maintain and manage fish\r\nstocks, Ukraine has become a party to the 1995 Fish\r\nStocks Agreement, which ensures the conservation and\r\nmanagement of those stocks on the basis of the\r\nprinciple of responsible fishing on the high seas. I\r\nwould like to take this opportunity to call on other\r\nStates that have not yet done so to accede to that\r\ninstrument in order to achieve the broadest possible\r\nparticipation.\r\nMy country has continuously attached great\r\nimportance to the issue of fisheries. Ukraine’s\r\nlegislation on fisheries was developed on the basis of\r\nthe provisions and principles of the Fish Stocks\r\nAgreement, well before Ukraine became a party to the\r\nAgreement. Nowadays, further practical steps to\r\nimplement the provisions of the Fish Stocks Agreement\r\nare being taken. They include the adoption of a number\r\nof legal documents designed to enhance the role of the\r\nState in conducting ocean fishing and increasing the\r\nresponsibility of vessel owners.\r\nThe overexploitation of living marine resources\r\nthrough excess fishing capacities continues to be of\r\nconcern to the international community. As a\r\ngeographically disadvantaged country bordering a sea\r\npoor in living resources and suffering from the\r\ndepletion of fish stocks in its exclusive economic zone,\r\nUkraine places special emphasis on the problem of\r\nillegal, unregulated and unreported fishing. We\r\nstrongly believe that all States should apply effective\r\nmeasures for the conservation, management and\r\nexploitation of fish stocks in order to protect living\r\nmarine resources and preserve the marine environment.\r\nBetter international cooperation is needed in this\r\nsphere, and a crucial role has to be played by the\r\nrelevant regional organizations, which should further\r\nenhance their cooperation with distant-water fishing\r\nStates and geographically disadvantaged nations.\r\nUkraine emphasizes the need to ensure effective\r\ncoordination and cooperation in integrated ocean\r\nmanagement, facilitate sustainable fisheries, enhance\r\nmaritime safety and protect the marine environment\r\nfrom pollution. In that context, we note with\r\nsatisfaction the ongoing work on the establishment,\r\npursuant to the recommendation of the World Summit\r\non Sustainable Development, of a regular process\r\nwithin the United Nations for global reporting and\r\nassessment of the state of the marine environment. We\r\nhope that further practical steps will be taken to\r\nestablish such a regular process.\r\nThe institutions established within the framework\r\nof the Convention are essential components of the\r\nglobal system for the rule of law and the maintenance\r\nof peace and security on the oceans.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that the International\r\nSeabed Authority, while examining the reports\r\nsubmitted by contractors, continues the elaboration of\r\nrules, regulations and procedures to ensure the\r\neffective protection of the marine environment and the\r\nconservation of the natural resources of the Area. We\r\nreaffirm the crucial role of the International Tribunal\r\nfor the Law of the Sea in the process of the\r\ninterpretation and the implementation of the 1982\r\nConvention and the Fish Stocks Agreement.\r\nSubstantial progress has been made by the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf,\r\nwhich has received its first submissions regarding the\r\nestablishment of the outer limits of the continental\r\nshelf beyond 200 nautical miles. At the same time, it is\r\nimportant to provide further assistance to developing\r\ncountries facing substantial difficulties in the process\r\nof preparing such submissions, primarily because of\r\nthe lack the necessary technical, scientific and\r\nfinancial resources.\r\nThe number of cases of piracy and armed robbery\r\ncontinues to be of major concern to the international\r\ncommunity. Such cruel and unlawful acts not only have\r\na negative economic impact on maritime transportation\r\nbut also constitute a real threat to the lives of crew\r\nmembers. Active measures by States and international\r\nand regional organizations are needed to combat and,\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nmore important, to prevent such illegal acts at sea and\r\nbring the perpetrators to justice.\r\nThe international community should devote more\r\nattention to the issue of preventing terrorist acts at sea.\r\nIn that regard, universal participation in and proper\r\nimplementation of the Convention for the Suppression\r\nof Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime\r\nNavigation and other related instruments are of\r\nparamount importance. We also welcome the entry into\r\nforce of the two optional protocols to the United\r\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized\r\nCrime, one concerning the smuggling of migrants and\r\nthe other on the prevention, suppression and\r\npunishment of trafficking in persons.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to underline the\r\nimportance of the Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, which\r\nfacilitates the General Assembly’s annual review of\r\ndevelopments in ocean affairs. I would also like to\r\nexpress our appreciation to the Secretary-General for\r\nboth the quality and the scope of the reports submitted\r\nunder this agenda item; they are powerful tools\r\nfacilitating international cooperation and coordination.\r\nThe activities of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the\r\nLaw of the Sea continue to be intensive and thus\r\nworthy of our praise.\r\nMr. Araníbar Quiroga (Bolivia) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): It is an honour for the Bolivian delegation to\r\naddress the General Assembly on the occasion of the\r\ntenth anniversary of the entry into force of the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, an\r\ninternational legal instrument with a universal and\r\nunitary character of paramount importance for the\r\nsustainable development of oceans and seas.\r\nThe Convention was opened for signature on\r\n19 December 1982 at Montego Bay, Jamaica, and its\r\nentry into force in 1994 marked a new era for\r\ninternational development. It gave shape to the ideals\r\nof more than 150 countries of all regions of the world,\r\nwhich over a period of 14 years focused their efforts on\r\nestablishing a broad regime for resolving all issues\r\nrelated to the law of the sea, conscious of the fact that\r\nproblems regarding marine areas are closely linked and\r\nmust be considered as a whole.\r\nToday we commend the political will expressed\r\nby the international community and the participation in\r\nsuch a vitally important instrument by countries with\r\nvarying levels of socio-economic development,\r\nincluding coastal, archipelagic, island and landlocked\r\nStates, as well as States that are geographically\r\ndisadvantaged with respect to ocean spaces.\r\nBolivia ratified the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea, conscious of that legal instrument’s\r\nstrategic importance for international law and as a\r\nbasis for cooperation at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to explain\r\nthe unique situation of Bolivia with respect to ocean\r\nspaces and the law of the sea. At the present time, and\r\nas a consequence of its temporary and forced isolation,\r\nBolivia participates in the group of landlocked\r\ncountries and supports the Almaty Programme of\r\nAction: Addressing the Special Needs of Landlocked\r\nDeveloping Countries within a New Global Framework\r\nfor Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked and\r\nTransit Developing Countries.\r\nMoreover, I would like to underline paragraph 57\r\nof the report of the Secretary-General on oceans and\r\nthe law of the sea, contained in document A/59/62,\r\nwhich states that\r\n“In yet another development that was\r\nreported on recently, Bolivia raised the issue of\r\nits access to the sea at several major regional and\r\nbilateral meetings, in an attempt to start a\r\ndialogue regarding the century-old demand by\r\nBolivia for a sovereign outlet to the Pacific\r\nOcean coast.”\r\nWe welcome the fact that the Secretary-General\r\nhas referred to Bolivia’s claim for a free, useful and\r\nsovereign outlet to the Pacific Ocean and request that\r\nhe continue to provide information on this matter to the\r\nGeneral Assembly in subsequent reports.\r\nOctober was the one hundredth anniversary of the\r\n1904 Treaty. We do not wish to further elaborate on\r\nBolivia’s historical and legal rights to the coast of the\r\nPacific Ocean. In that regard, we have distributed to all\r\ndelegations the Blue Book on the Maritime Claim of\r\nBolivia. Also, an official document of the General\r\nAssembly has been distributed under the symbol\r\nA/59/445, containing the Declaration on the Centennial\r\nof the 1904 Treaty by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs\r\nand Worship of Bolivia.\r\nHowever, it is necessary to recall that as a\r\nconsequence of the Pacific War, Bolivia lost more than\r\n120,000 square kilometres of its territory, 400\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nkilometres of the Pacific Ocean coast and enormous\r\nmining resources. The war caused Bolivia the loss of\r\nits free and sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean and\r\nthe mutilation of a very important part of its territory,\r\nincluding all the raw materials and natural resources\r\nthat this territory held, and still holds.\r\nMoreover, we recall for the international\r\ncommunity that Bolivia had a coast line and free access\r\nto the Pacific Ocean from 1825 to 1879, in other\r\nwords, during 54 years of its history as a republic. For\r\nthat reason, on the centennial of the 1904 Treaty, which\r\nended the Pacific War, we firmly assert that the Treaty\r\ndid not solve what it was intended to solve, since it was\r\nimposed by force and the politics of fait accompli. The\r\n1904 Treaty meant Bolivia’s loss of its free, sovereign\r\nand useful access to the sea, and that is why that\r\ninternational agreement has prevented the attainment\r\nof a final and satisfactory solution to the problems\r\npending between Bolivia and Chile.\r\nFurthermore, it must be said most clearly that\r\nChile has not complied in a permanent manner with its\r\nobligations under the 1904 Treaty. In that respect, it\r\nshould be mentioned that in circumstances of decisive\r\nimportance for the history of Bolivia, such as the\r\nChaco War and the national revolution, Chile clearly\r\ndid not comply with its commitment and obligation of\r\npermitting free transit, owing to interests of a different\r\nkind.\r\nPresently, the recent privatization of seaports by\r\nthe Government of Chile is creating a new kind of\r\nrelationship between Bolivia and private companies. It\r\nis creating a relationship different from the kind that\r\nshould exist between two States that need to enter into\r\ndialogue on one of the principle issues of the Treaty:\r\nseaports. It should be underlined that in recent months\r\nthe Government of Bolivia has had strong and\r\nimportant differences with the Government of Chile\r\nwith respect to fulfilment of obligations under the 1904\r\nTreaty, in particular with respect to the free-transit\r\nregime and the privatization of the seaport of Arica.\r\nConsidering that the integration of South America\r\nis making progress and that Bolivia’s request to free\r\nmaritime access has become a stumbling block in the\r\npath of integration, Bolivia reaffirms its willingness to\r\nundertake a reasonable, constructive and integrated\r\napproach with Chile and reaffirms that it will not alter\r\nits demand, as it is founded on deep historical, moral\r\nand legal grounds.\r\nIn any case, in the spirit of integration that\r\nprevails in the new millennium, the Government of\r\nBolivia calls on Chile to resume our bilateral dialogue\r\nfollowing the agreement of both countries at the 2000\r\nAlgarve meeting and declares its intention to pursue\r\nthe dialogue initiated by our respective Presidents, in\r\nparticular at the November 2003 meeting of Heads of\r\nState and Heads of Government on the occasion of the\r\nthirteenth Ibero-American Summit, which took place in\r\nSanta Cruz de la Sierra in Bolivia.\r\nIn the process of South American integration, the\r\nnations of the Andean Community and MERCOSUR\r\nhave reached agreements with the goal of moving\r\ntowards an integrated South American area, which\r\ncould become a reality sooner than expected. However,\r\nthe persistence of bilateral conflicts and the lack of a\r\nresponse to Bolivia’s maritime claim will delay and\r\nweaken the process of regional integration. Bolivia\r\nbelieves its land-locked isolation is a multilateral issue\r\ngiven its geopolitical nature, economic impact and\r\ndiplomatic consequences.\r\nAt the same time, Bolivia stresses that bilateral\r\nnegotiations with Chile are possible and that it stands\r\nready to make the attempt, while reserving the option\r\nof raising and discussing this issue in various forums\r\nand international organizations so long as it remains\r\nunresolved.\r\nNegotiations with Chile must have a clear\r\norientation and a clear objective, which is, without\r\ndoubt, the signing of a new treaty that reflects the\r\npresent situation. If we want to create a new vision for\r\nthe twenty-first century, it makes no sense to look\r\nbackwards. On the contrary, we must look forward,\r\nseeking a new legal instrument between Chile and\r\nBolivia that truly and really enables peace and\r\nfriendship between our two peoples.\r\nThe Government of Bolivia takes this opportunity\r\nto express its willingness to enter into an open dialogue\r\nwith the Government of Chile, enabling the attainment\r\nof an adequate answer and a final solution to the\r\nmaritime problem.\r\nIn conclusion, the Bolivian delegation reaffirms\r\nthe need to find peaceful solutions to the controversies\r\nthat continue to exist in the Western hemisphere by\r\nacting in a spirit of genuine and rejuvenating\r\nmultilateralism, aimed at strengthening efforts to\r\nenable peace-loving peoples to make progress in their\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\ndevelopment on the ever more solid foundations of\r\nshared responsibilities and generous solidarity.\r\nMr. Aniemena (Nigeria): I would like to express\r\nmy delegation’s appreciation of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s comprehensive reports, contained in\r\ndocuments A/59/62 and A/59/126, on important\r\ndevelopments and issues relating to oceans and the law\r\nof the sea, including information on the status of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and\r\nits implementing agreements. It is gratifying to note\r\nthat today, 16 November 2004, marks the tenth\r\nanniversary of the Convention’s entry-into-force.\r\nWith the number of parties to the Convention\r\nnow standing at 145 of a total of 195 States, we\r\nwelcome the remarkable progress in the efforts towards\r\nuniversal accession to the Convention. Indeed, the\r\nConvention has proved to be a veritable and crucial\r\nlegal framework for all issues and activities related to\r\noceans and for the allocation of ocean spaces. As a\r\ncoastal State, Nigeria reaffirms its unwavering\r\ncommitment to the Convention and its implementing\r\nagreements.\r\nWe are greatly encouraged by the international\r\ncommunity’s desire to establish a Global Marine\r\nAssessment process that is truly global and all-\r\ninclusive. We believe that the establishment of a new\r\nassessment process would go a long way in providing\r\ncoherent and viable options and measures to deal with\r\nthe challenges of the successful management of the\r\nmarine environment and the question of the\r\ndeteriorating state of the world’s oceans and seas and\r\nin addressing the socio-economic consequences of the\r\ndegradation of the marine environment.\r\nNigeria continues to grapple with the\r\noverwhelming challenges of improving the standards\r\nof living of its coastal populations by seeking ways to\r\nreverse the economic and social setbacks occasioned\r\nby adverse environmental impacts. In the light of the\r\ntransboundary nature of negative environmental impact\r\nand the resulting economic and social problems\r\nassociated with marine degradation, Nigeria strongly\r\nsupports an assessment that essentially addresses the\r\nsocio-economic causes and consequences of the\r\ndistressing conditions of the marine environment.\r\nIn the light of the foregoing, Nigeria welcomes\r\nthe ongoing efforts towards the establishment of a\r\nGlobal Marine Assessment, which is to be a regular,\r\nglobal and comprehensive assessment of the marine\r\nenvironment, including living marine resources and\r\nsocio-economic aspects. We note that the draft\r\nconclusions of the Global Marine Assessment\r\nInternational Workshop include a recommendation that\r\nthe General Assembly invite the Secretary-General to\r\nestablish a task force to initiate and coordinate the next\r\nstage of preparatory work necessary to formally\r\nestablish the Global Marine Assessment. In that regard,\r\nmy delegation strongly supports the view that the work\r\nof the task force should conform to the principles of\r\nthe Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the\r\nrelevant resolutions of the General Assembly,\r\nresolutions 57/141 and 58/240.\r\nConcerning the issue of maritime space, Nigeria\r\nhas indicated that it will present its submission on the\r\nlimits of its continental shelf before August 2005. We\r\ncommend the work of the Commission on the Limits of\r\nthe Continental Shelf, particularly the adoption of a\r\nrevised set of rules of procedure, which was\r\naccomplished on the basis of the practical experience\r\ngained by the Commission from receiving and\r\nexamining its first submission, from the Russian\r\nFederation. We believe that the consolidation of all the\r\nexisting procedural rules into a single basic document\r\nwill make them easier to understand and will facilitate\r\ntheir application and interpretation by coastal States\r\nintending to make a submission. In addition, we\r\nwelcome the ongoing work on the preparation of a\r\ntraining manual to assist States in acquiring the\r\nknowledge and skills necessary to prepare a\r\nsubmission on the outer limits of the continental shelf.\r\nNigeria also commends the Secretary-General for\r\nhis detailed report entitled “Sustainable fisheries,\r\nincluding through the Agreement for the\r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December\r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of\r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish\r\nStocks, and related instruments” (A/59/298). We note\r\nwith appreciation the steps and initiatives taken by the\r\ninternational community to improve the conservation\r\nand management of fishery resources and other marine\r\nliving resources with a view to achieving sustainable\r\nfisheries and protecting marine ecosystems and\r\nbiodiversity.\r\nNigeria appreciates the need to manage and\r\nconserve fish stocks. Commercial fishing constitutes an\r\nimportant factor in ensuring food security programmes,\r\na basic policy of our Government. Consequently, the\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nconservation and rational use of living resources of the\r\nsea and the sustainable development of resources are\r\nvital to its success. In that regard, Nigeria notes with\r\ninterest the positive impact that the 1995 Fish Stocks\r\nAgreement has made on the conservation and\r\nmanagement of international fisheries and that it has\r\nbecome the standard for best international practice in\r\nmany States. We believe that the 1995 Fish Stocks\r\nAgreement represents a courageous attempt by the\r\ninternational community to protect commercially\r\nimportant species that have been subjected to illegal,\r\nunregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing.\r\nThe central role of the regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations (RFMOs) in the\r\nimplementation of the relevant fishery instruments\r\ncannot be overemphasized. They continue to make\r\ninvaluable contributions to tackling IUU fishing\r\nproblems and destructive fishing practices. Nigeria\r\ntherefore welcomes the progress made thus far by the\r\nvarious RFMOs. Nigeria continues to support\r\ncooperation and coordination among the RFMOs to\r\nenhance data collection, monitoring and enforcement.\r\nWe also appreciate the important role of the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)\r\nin that regard.\r\nNigeria agrees that IUU fishing in all its forms\r\nconstitutes the main obstacle to achieving sustainable\r\nfisheries, both in areas under national jurisdiction and\r\non the high seas. We recognize the International Plan\r\nof Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal,\r\nUnreported and Unregulated Fishing as the main\r\ninternational instrument for dealing with this problem,\r\nand we welcome the decision of the General Assembly\r\nto make the full implementation of that instrument a\r\ntop priority. We further endorse the recommendations\r\nof the FAO technical consultation to tackle the\r\nproblem, including the recommendation that FAO\r\ncontinue to use funds to assist developing States with\r\nthe implementation of the International Plan of Action,\r\nand the recommendation concerning the need for flag\r\nStates, at the national level or acting through RFMOs,\r\nto adopt measures to prevent the reflagging of vessels\r\nto States that do not comply with the Agreement.\r\nNigeria underlines the importance that the United\r\nNations places on capacity-building for developing\r\nStates. In the same vein, we welcome the collaboration\r\nbetween the FAO, the World Bank, the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development and the World\r\nWide Fund for Nature to forge a strategic partnership\r\nfor a sustainable fisheries intervention fund in the large\r\necosystems of sub-Saharan Africa. We believe this\r\nmove should enhance the use of Global Environment\r\nFacility (GEF) funds to implement the World Summit\r\non Sustainable Development targets on poverty\r\nreduction and fisheries. We welcome the approval by\r\nthe GEF of a 15-month project to prepare the relevant\r\npartnership brief, which is expected to propose a $265\r\nmillion budget over a period of 10 years. It is pertinent\r\nto note that the fisheries component of the preparatory\r\nmeeting for the African Process for the Protection and\r\nDevelopment of the Marine and Coastal Environment\r\nin Sub-Saharan Africa took place in June 2002.\r\nFinally, the international community must address\r\nthe continuous damage being done to the marine\r\necosystem by well-known destructive fishing practices,\r\nto supplement regional efforts to put an end to such\r\npractices. The precautionary approach and the\r\necosystem approach should be blended to ensure the\r\nsustainable use of marine resources.\r\nMr. MacKay (New Zealand): New Zealand\r\nassociates itself with the statement by Samoa on behalf\r\nof the States of the Pacific Islands Forum, of which\r\nNew Zealand is a member. We would also like to add a\r\nfew additional comments on our own behalf.\r\nThis year is particularly significant for the issues\r\nof oceans and the law of the sea. Our debate marks the\r\ntenth anniversary of the opening for signature of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The\r\ncontinuing relevance of the Convention and its\r\nprinciples as the global foundation document for\r\noceans governance and management was reaffirmed\r\nand given modern expression by our leaders at the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development, held in\r\nJohannesburg two years ago. New Zealand welcomed\r\nthe commitments made in the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation on oceans issues, and continues to urge\r\nStates to make every effort to ensure that the calls to\r\naction contained in that Plan are fulfilled.\r\nIn particular, New Zealand is concerned that\r\nadverse impacts of fishing activities on vulnerable\r\nmarine ecosystems continue to occur, and, more\r\nworryingly, that reactions by States to address the\r\nproblem are often too slow and inadequate. New\r\nZealand considers that these issues require urgent\r\ninterim action.\r\nNew Zealand also strongly supports the need to\r\naddress these issues through appropriate regional\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nfisheries management structures. Proper geographical\r\ncoverage of regional fisheries management\r\norganizations with the capacity to manage demersal\r\nspecies, updated mandates for organizations to address\r\nenvironmental issues caused by deep-sea fisheries, and\r\nthe adoption of strong conservation and management\r\nmeasures are three key areas for States to focus their\r\naction and attention. For our part — in addition to\r\nexisting prohibitions and other measures in place in our\r\nown exclusive economic zone — New Zealand is\r\nalready taking the first steps towards the establishment\r\nof a new regional fisheries management framework for\r\ndemersal fisheries in the Tasman Sea area adjacent to\r\nNew Zealand’s waters.\r\nWe are pleased with the commitment shown by\r\nall States this year to address the impacts of destructive\r\nfishing practices and bottom-trawling that have adverse\r\neffects on marine ecosystems. Given the urgency of\r\nthis issue, New Zealand looks forward to the\r\nopportunity to check progress on interim measures and\r\non improvements to regional management\r\narrangements next year, at the sixtieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Together, we will need to consider\r\noptions for ensuring that adequate protection and\r\nmanagement is in place for any areas where progress\r\nhas been insufficient.\r\nNew Zealand welcomes the establishment of a\r\nnew Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group to\r\nstudy issues relating to the conservation and\r\nsustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond\r\nareas of national jurisdiction. There is no question that\r\nthe time has now come for States to sit down together\r\nand focus in earnest on the question of high seas\r\nmarine biodiversity, which, as we are all aware,\r\ninvolves a multitude of interests. We must not be\r\ndeterred by the number and complexity of issues that\r\nwill arise in the course of this work, nor by the\r\nexpectation that resolution of them will take time. We\r\nhope that the work of the Group will enable key issues\r\nto be clearly identified so as to facilitate the direction\r\nand scope of any future work. We are ready and willing\r\nto use this forum to engage seriously with others to\r\nwork through the relevant issues of importance so as to\r\nenhance protection and preservation of the marine\r\nenvironment.\r\nProper conservation and management of marine\r\nresources and biodiversity requires a fully integrated\r\napproach to oceans governance and management. As\r\nnoted in Samoa’s statement on behalf of the Pacific\r\nIslands Forum, we in the Pacific have a regional\r\noceans policy in place as well as an action plan to\r\nensure integrated implementation of our regional\r\npolicy. In that same vein, New Zealand continues to\r\nview the Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and\r\nLaw of the Sea as a vital opportunity to survey, in an\r\nintegrated way, important international oceans issues.\r\nNew Zealand supports the adoption of a renewed\r\nmandate for the Informal Consultative Process beyond\r\nthe sixth meeting of the Process, to be held in June\r\nnext year.\r\nFinally, we thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport, which is, as always, comprehensive and of great\r\nassistance to delegations and to the wider oceans\r\nconstituency. I should like here to acknowledge, as we\r\nhave in the past, the very fine work carried out by the\r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.\r\nWe participated in the consideration of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report during the Informal\r\nConsultative Process earlier this year, which identified\r\nkey issues of concern. As a co-sponsor, we fully\r\nsupport the reflection of those concerns and the\r\nconclusions reached in both resolutions under this\r\nitem.\r\nMr. Nguyen Duy Chien (Viet Nam): As we\r\ncelebrate the tenth anniversary of the entry into force\r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea (UNCLOS), we would like to express our\r\nsatisfaction with the positive developments that have\r\noccurred in the process of implementing the\r\nConvention, such as the rapid increase in UNCLOS\r\nmembership, the successful establishment and\r\nfunctioning of the three relevant bodies — namely the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority, the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea, and the Commission\r\non the Limits of the Continental Shelf.\r\nWe congratulate the International Seabed\r\nAuthority on the work it has done during the last\r\ndecade and support its efforts in the development of a\r\nlegal regime for prospecting and exploration for\r\npolymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich crusts and in the\r\nconservation of biodiversity in the Area. We also\r\ncommend the work of the International Tribunal for the\r\nLaw of the Sea and the Commission on the Limits of\r\nContinental Shelf. In particular, we appreciate the\r\ncontinuing efforts made by the Commission in assisting\r\nStates in the preparation of their submissions, by\r\nproviding any scientific and technical advice that might\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nbe useful, preparing a training manual and an executive\r\nsummary, and calling for additional political and\r\nfinancial support for the Trust Fund. We will continue\r\nto support the work of these three bodies.\r\nThe delegation of Viet Nam takes note with\r\nappreciation of the outcome of the discussions held\r\nduring the fifth meeting of the Open-ended Informal\r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the\r\nSea. We believe that any activity related to the\r\nbiological diversity of the deep seabed beyond areas of\r\nnational jurisdiction must be carried out for the benefit\r\nof humankind as the whole. In general, we support the\r\nmeeting’s recommendations as submitted to the fifty-\r\nninth session of the General Assembly. We also\r\nwelcome the decision to establish an Ad Hoc Informal\r\nWorking Group to survey past and present activities of\r\nthe United Nations and other relevant international\r\norganizations with regard to the conservation and\r\nsustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond\r\nareas of national jurisdiction, and examine the\r\nscientific, technical, economic, legal, environmental,\r\nsocio-economic and other aspects of those issues. In\r\nthat context, we would like to lend our support to the\r\nview that arrangements relating to new ocean affairs\r\nissues should be fair and take into account the interests\r\nof developing countries.\r\nTwo years ago, the member countries of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and\r\nChina signed the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties\r\nin the South China Sea — Eastern Sea. As an important\r\nstep towards building a code of conduct in the South\r\nChina Sea, the Declaration underlines, among other\r\nthings, the commitment of the parties to exercising\r\nself-restraint in the conduct of activities that could\r\ncomplicate or escalate disputes or affect peace and\r\nstability in the region. The recent ASEAN Ministerial\r\nMeeting in June 2004 in Jakarta and the Ministerial\r\nConference of the Movement of Non-Aligned\r\nCountries in August 2004 in Durban, South Africa,\r\nhighlighted the significance of the Declaration on the\r\nConduct of Parties in the South China Sea for\r\npromoting peace, security and stability in the region.\r\nViet Nam has had a consistent policy of peaceful\r\nsettlement of relevant disputes in the spirit of equality,\r\nmutual understanding and strict respect for\r\ninternational law, especially the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, and is committed to\r\nrespect and implement the Declaration. It is up to the\r\nother signatories to strictly abide by all provisions of\r\nthe Declaration, especially the commitment not to\r\nconduct activities that would complicate or endanger\r\nthe peace and affect peace and stability in the region.\r\nMr. Tierney (Australia): As we reflect today on\r\nwhat has happened in the law of the sea since the entry\r\ninto force exactly ten years ago of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, who can fail to be\r\nsurprised at how far we’ve come since 1994? Anxiety\r\nabout whether the Convention would ever gain wider\r\nparticipation has been replaced by sense of security in\r\nthe status it has achieved as the foundation of States’\r\ncooperation in their use of the oceans.\r\nThe comprehensive instrument we have today\r\nwas not always planned to have that character. The\r\nprocess by which it came about was sparked 37 years\r\nago by Ambassador Pardo’s address proposing that the\r\ndeep ocean floor should be the common heritage of all\r\nmankind. This concept quickly won universal\r\nacceptance, but carried with it the need to define the\r\nboundary between the deep ocean floor and the\r\ncontinental shelf under national jurisdiction. Article 76\r\nof the Convention, which sets out the rules for\r\nestablishing the boundary, is in a sense the seed from\r\nwhich the Convention grew.\r\nIt was quickly realized that one facet of the law\r\nof the sea had implications for all other facets. As the\r\npreamble to the Convention and the resolutions before\r\nus state, the problems of ocean space are closely\r\ninterrelated and need to be considered as a whole. That\r\nremains true and it’s something we should all bear in\r\nmind with the Convention being open for amendment\r\nfrom today. However, most of the piecemeal\r\nimprovements to the Convention that many of us\r\nincluding Australia would be happy to see, would be\r\nequally attainable, in effect, by continuing to refine the\r\nway we interpret and apply the Convention.\r\nThe recommendations of the fifth meeting of the\r\nUnited Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Oceans and Law of the Sea are the source\r\nof much of the new language in the resolutions before\r\nus. That attests once more to the value of the process.\r\nAs usual Australia will co-sponsor and vote in\r\nfavour of both resolutions. We express our thanks to\r\nthe coordinators, to the Secretariat, whose job seems to\r\nget harder every year in line with the resolutions’ ever-\r\nincreasing length, and it is time we lightened their\r\nburden. There are plenty of topical problems in the\r\nLaw of the Sea in general, and fisheries in particular,\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nthat are worthy of our close attention, but their\r\nprominence is only obscured by our collective\r\ninsistence on repeating the same things year after year,\r\nas though General Assembly resolutions expired after a\r\nyear. Is it too much to hope that the combined total this\r\nyear of 45 preambular and 187 operative paragraphs in\r\nthe two resolutions represent high-water marks?\r\nYesterday, Australia submitted to the Commission\r\non the Limits of the Continental Shelf its submission\r\non the outer limit of the shelf beyond 200 miles, the\r\nterritorial sea baseline. Australia’s submission is the\r\nthird on the Commission’s books. We are confident that\r\nthe Commission will faithfully discharge its functions\r\nunder article 76. We look forward to working with the\r\nCommission in the coming months, as it formulates the\r\nrecommendations on which our final and binding outer\r\nlimit will be based.\r\nWe are confident that in our case, these\r\nrecommendations will emerge within a reasonable\r\ntimeframe. However, we are concerned that, for\r\nreasons beyond the Commission’s control, this will not\r\nnecessarily be so for States that come after us. While\r\nthe Commission only has the space and human\r\nresources to deal actively with two submissions at a\r\ntime, the achievement of certainty about the limits of\r\nthe areas beyond national jurisdiction and the removal\r\nof a clog in the operation of the International Seabed\r\nAuthority are likely to be an increasingly remote\r\nprospect. For this reason, Australia welcomes\r\nparagraph 31 of the omnibus resolution. As required by\r\nparagraph 10, Australia’s submission is without\r\nprejudice to a number of existing and outstanding\r\nmaritime boundary delimitations.\r\nI am pleased to report that one of the outstanding\r\ndelimitations was recently resolved. Our maritime\r\nboundary delimitation agreement with New Zealand\r\nwas signed in Adelaide on 25 July 2004 and settled\r\nwhat was Australia’s longest undelimitated maritime\r\nboundary. The legal certainty the treaty engenders is an\r\nessential step towards the rational exploitation of\r\nresources in the parts of the Tasman Sea concerned. As\r\na boundary arrived at by negotiation, it is by definition\r\none that both sides regard as fair and an equitable\r\nreflection of their overlapping maritime zone\r\nentitlements under the Convention.\r\nTurning to fisheries, Australia welcomes the fact\r\nthat since our last session the European Community\r\nand many of its member States, as well as Kenya, have\r\nbecome parties to the Fish Stock Agreement. This adds\r\nsignificantly to the gravitational pull the Agreement is\r\nexercising on the general international law of fisheries.\r\nIn Australia’s region, we welcome the entry into force\r\nof the Honolulu Convention on the Conservation and\r\nManagement of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the\r\nWestern and Central Pacific Ocean. It creates a\r\nmechanism for sustainable exploitation of tuna, the one\r\nsizeable resource enjoyed by the island States of the\r\nPacific Island Forum. The Commission created by the\r\nConvention is due to hold its inaugural meeting next\r\nmonth. It is particularly gratifying that two States with\r\ndistinct water-fishing interests in the Convention area,\r\nChina and the Republic of Korea, and one fishing\r\nentity with similar interests, Chinese Taipei, have now\r\nconsented to be bound by the Convention.\r\nThe Convention is a breakthrough for another\r\nreason, namely, to give practical effect to the fine\r\nwords we utter each year. We talk a lot about the\r\ncautionary approach to fishing in Annex II of the\r\nUnited Nations Fish Stocks Agreement, but neglect\r\narticle 10 (j), which obliges parties to agree on\r\ndecision-making procedures that facilitate the timely\r\nand effective adoption of conservation management\r\nmeasures. Consensus or objection procedures have\r\noften driven all the Commissions to the lowest\r\ncommon denominator. They adopt measures that are\r\ntoo little, too late or they end up completely paralysed.\r\nThe Honolulu Convention is a serious attempt at\r\nimplementing article 10 (j) and avoiding paralysis.\r\nInstead of providing an objective procedure, the\r\nConvention provides for a review procedure. The only\r\ngrounds for review of measures adopted under the\r\nConvention are that the measures are inconsistent with\r\nthe Convention, the Fish Stocks Agreement or the\r\nHonolulu Convention, or that they discriminate in form\r\nor in fact against the State concerned.\r\nAustralia was surprised that so much of the\r\nnegotiation of this year’s draft resolution on fisheries\r\nwas devoted to the issue of bottom-trawling. Australia\r\nhas been a long-standing champion of high-seas\r\nbiodiversity conservation. We realize that some fishing\r\npractices have damaged important biodiversity, and\r\nthat in some areas this damage is continuing.\r\nAustralia is concerned, however, that fishing\r\npractices that are not destructive of high-seas\r\nbiodiversity might also be penalized if we take too\r\nbroad an approach. The efficacy of the measures we\r\ntake will in part depend on their ability to differentiate\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nbetween genuinely destructive and non-destructive\r\npractices, and between those flag States that are\r\nprepared to control their nationals’ activities and those\r\nthat are not. Australia will allow its nationals to build a\r\nsustainable longline and trawl industry in the waters of\r\nthe Southern Oceans. At the same time, we will\r\ncontinue to ensure, consistent with paragraph 66 of the\r\nfisheries draft resolution (A/59/L.23), that fishing is\r\nconducted responsibly and with observer coverage. We\r\nwill also continue to work hard to improve governance\r\nin the high seas more generally.\r\nAustralia has long been a proponent of\r\nstrengthening measures to tackle illegal fishing. We\r\ncontinue to act firmly against unlicensed vessels\r\nfishing in Australian waters, whatever their flags. We\r\nare pleased to have seen, earlier this month, the\r\nadoption of a centralized vessel monitoring system by\r\nthe Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic\r\nMarine Living Resources. No single measure will do\r\nmore to combat the illegal, unreported and unregulated\r\nfishing that has been going on in the Southern Ocean\r\nfor far too long.\r\nBut are we doing all we can to bring uncontrolled\r\nfishing to an end? Perhaps treating illegal, unreported\r\nand unregulated fishing as a single problem reduced to\r\nan acronym — IUU — has outlived its usefulness.\r\nAfter all, such fishing is not one problem but three,\r\neach of which requires separate international policy\r\nresponses. Those responses must be based on flag\r\nStates’ responsibility for the activities of their fishing\r\nvessels on the high seas or in other States’ exclusive\r\neconomic zones. Making States accountable for those\r\nactivities must become a focus of our efforts.\r\nMr. Arons (Palau): Palau agrees and fully\r\nassociates itself with the statement delivered earlier by\r\nthe representative of Samoa on behalf of the Pacific\r\nIslands Forum group.\r\nPalau took great pride in participating in the\r\ndiscussions over the last month that will shape\r\ninternational law on fishing and the ocean for years to\r\ncome. The spirit of cooperation and compromise made\r\nthe discussions fruitful and relevant. It was important\r\nto hear not only from the world’s largest fishing\r\nnations, but also from those smaller States that are\r\naffected by the practices of others.\r\nIt is regrettable that over the course of the\r\ninformal discussions much emphasis was placed on\r\nhow the resolutions would impact the fishing States.\r\nAs one looks at the declining state of the world’s\r\necosystems, it is abundantly clear that we have too\r\noften repeated the same mistake. Rather than applying\r\nthe precautionary principle and taking measures to\r\nprevent destruction of the environment, we far too\r\noften find ourselves trying to solve problems that have\r\nalready developed destructive and sometimes\r\nunstoppable momentum. The failure over the last\r\nweeks to adequately address the issue of deep-sea\r\nbottom trawling is a stark example of that very\r\nphenomenon.\r\nOver the last month and-a-half we had the\r\nopportunity to chart a different and better course.\r\nScientists from around the world have called on this\r\nbody to take urgent action to prevent destruction of the\r\ndeep seas’ magnificent biodiversity — a world of\r\nuntold beauty and value. The scientific community is\r\njust beginning to understand the scope and the\r\nvulnerability of the deep sea. It is already clear,\r\nhowever, that seamounts and other deep-sea features\r\nare both teeming with unique life and extremely\r\nvulnerable. At the same time, we know that a small\r\nnumber of fleets from larger, more developed countries\r\nthat have depleted their own fisheries are now bottom\r\ntrawling in international waters. And we know that that\r\nmethod of fishing is ploughing up ancient coral\r\nsystems and untold scores of endemic species.\r\nFor Pacific nations like Palau, protecting the\r\nocean is not of casual interest; it is essential to\r\npreserving our way of life. Without fish in the sea, we\r\nin the Pacific simply will not survive. Accordingly, we\r\nare disappointed that the Open-ended Consultative\r\nProcess did not recommend that the General Assembly\r\ntake immediate and effective measures this year to\r\nprotect the deep sea from destructive fishing practices.\r\nThe General Assembly has twice in the past two\r\nyears emphasized the need for urgent action to manage\r\nthe risks to marine biodiversity in areas beyond\r\nnational jurisdiction. In February, this call was echoed\r\nby the Seventh Conference of the Parties to the\r\nConvention on Biological Diversity. And just last\r\nsummer, Secretary-General Kofi Annan and United\r\nNations Environment Programme Executive Director\r\nKlaus Toepfer made similar calls for action to protect\r\nthe world’s oceans.\r\nIn the light of these and other expressions of\r\nconcern by the international community, Palau believes\r\nthat the time for action has arrived. We therefore\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nexpress our grave disappointment that the draft\r\nresolutions currently before the Assembly did not call\r\nfor an immediate moratorium on bottom trawl fishing\r\nin all high seas regions. Untold destruction of the\r\nworld’s most beautiful and biodiverse seabeds will\r\ncontinue until such a moratorium is in place. A\r\nmoratorium on high-seas bottom trawling would be\r\nconsistent with this institution’s best traditions of\r\nglobal marine stewardship, such as General Assembly\r\nresolutions on large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing on\r\nthe high seas that were adopted by consensus from\r\n1989 to 1991.\r\nPalau will continue to raise the issue of a\r\nmoratorium on deep-sea bottom trawling at all\r\ninternational forums until the legal infrastructure is in\r\nplace to deal with that destructive practice.\r\nMr. Pawlak (Poland): At the outset, I would like\r\nto thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive\r\nreport on oceans and the law of the sea (A/59/62) and\r\nfor its very informative and up-to-date addendum. Both\r\ndocuments provide us with an excellent overview of\r\ndevelopments relating to the implementation of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and\r\nthe work of the Organization and other international\r\nbodies in the field of ocean affairs.\r\nI wish also to express our appreciation to the\r\ncoordinators of the draft resolutions before us today,\r\nnamely, Mr. Marcos de Almeida of Brazil, Ms. Jennifer\r\nMcIver of New Zealand and Ms. Holly Koehler of the\r\nUnited States. Poland is pleased to co-sponsor both\r\ndraft resolutions. In addition, I would also like to thank\r\nthe Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea,\r\nheaded by its new Director, Mr. Vladimir Golitsyn, for\r\nthe support they have provided.\r\nMy delegation wishes to associate fully itself\r\nwith the statement made by the representative of the\r\nNetherlands today on behalf of the European Union.\r\nWe would like, nevertheless, to provide some\r\nadditional information on issues under consideration\r\nrelated to Poland’s activities.\r\nIt is my great honour to deliver this statement\r\ntoday on 16 November, which marks the tenth\r\nanniversary of the entry into force of the 1982 United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. During the\r\npast decade, despite numerous obstacles and\r\nchallenges, the Convention, as a unique international\r\nlegal instrument, contributed greatly to cooperation in\r\nmaritime affairs and strengthened the enforcement of\r\nlaw in a balanced and harmonious way. I would like to\r\ntake this opportunity to appeal to States which have not\r\nyet done so to accede to the Convention with the aim\r\nof ensuring its universality and enabling the\r\nConvention to attain its full potential.\r\nSince international affairs are increasingly\r\ninfluenced by international judiciary institutions, my\r\ndelegation would like to commend the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea on its active role in\r\nsolving inter-State disputes, thus contributing to the\r\naffirmation of the rule of law in maritime affairs. The\r\nTribunal’s internal judicial practices and guidelines for\r\nthe preparation and submission of cases before it were\r\nwell presented by Mr. Dolliver Nelson, President of the\r\nTribunal, as well as by Mr. Philippe Gautier, the\r\nRegistrar, during the last two Meetings of States\r\nParties.\r\nThe sections of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/59/62 and Add.1) that deals with the\r\nprotection and preservation of the marine environment\r\nhave provided a comprehensive understanding of the\r\ndegradation of coastal and marine environments caused\r\nby pollution from sewage, persistent organic\r\nsubstances, radioactive materials and oil, as well as\r\npollution from vessels and oil spills.\r\nThe Polish delegation is very concerned by the\r\nfact that the degradation of coastal and marine\r\nenvironments has not decreased in the last year but in\r\nfact has intensified. We must do everything in our\r\npower to stop that process, which has an unprecedented\r\nimpact on human health, food security and safety. We\r\nbelieve that one of the more efficient ways of\r\npreventing the further degradation of the marine\r\nenvironment is through regional cooperation among\r\nStates.\r\nPoland fully supports the activities of the Baltic\r\nMarine Environment Protection Commission and the\r\nrecommendations adopted during its 25th meeting in\r\nHelsinki, in March 2004, on measures to reduce\r\ndischarges from freshwater and marine fish farming,\r\nand on assessment of the need for escort towing in\r\ntanker transport routes to prevent accidents in the\r\nBaltic Sea area, new oil filtering technologies on board\r\nships and guidelines for the safety of winter navigation\r\nin the Baltic Sea.\r\nMy Government is fully committed to\r\nimprovement of the state of the marine environment in\r\nthe Baltic Sea. In fact, on 9 October 2003, the Polish\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nCouncil of Ministers adopted an ordinance on the\r\nexpansion of the act of 1995 concerning the prevention\r\nof marine pollution by ships. That ordinance\r\ncriminalized marine pollution by navy, coastguard and\r\npolice vessels.\r\nPoland is also committed to the protection and\r\npreservation of the marine biodiversity of the oceans in\r\nareas of national jurisdiction and beyond the limits of\r\nnational jurisdiction. We therefore highly appreciate\r\nthe decision to establish an ad hoc open-ended\r\ninformal working group to study issues relating to the\r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological\r\ndiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction. We\r\nsupport that timely initiative and are willing to\r\ncooperate with other delegations and institutions on\r\nthat issue.\r\nTaking into account the fact that shipping carries\r\nmore than 90 per cent of world trade, Poland believes\r\nthat safety of navigation is of crucial importance to the\r\ninternational community. In that respect we recall the\r\ndecision of the European Parliament of 6 November\r\n2003 to set up a temporary committee on improving\r\nsafety at sea and its subsequent resolution on this issue\r\nadopted on 20 April 2004.\r\nPoland supports the establishment of a European\r\ncoastguard service equipped with the necessary\r\ncompetence and instruments to ensure maritime safety\r\nand protection of the maritime environment, strict\r\nmonitoring of adherence to certain shipping routes,\r\nprosecution of the illegal entry of vessels and\r\ncoordination of measures in the event of an accident at\r\nsea.\r\nWe welcome the approval of the amendments —\r\nproposed by the International Maritime Organization’s\r\nMaritime Safety Committee — to Chapter XII of the\r\nInternational Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea\r\naimed at introducing new provisions relating to double-\r\nhull construction for new bulk carriers of 150 metres in\r\nlength and over as an optional alternative to single-side\r\nconstruction. We look forward to the adoption of those\r\namendments during the session of the International\r\nMaritime Organization scheduled for next month. We\r\nwould, however, like to stress that more attention\r\nshould be devoted to the maintenance and condition of\r\nvessels, since a poorly maintained double-hulled tanker\r\nrepresents a greater potential hazard than a well\r\nmaintained single-hulled tanker.\r\nPoland is encouraged by the fact that since the\r\nPrestige disaster of November 2002 we are fortunate\r\nnot to have witnessed a tragedy of a similar scale in\r\nEurope. However, we are concerned by the disaster\r\ninvolving the freighter Rocknes off the coast of\r\nNorway, which occurred last January and caused the\r\ndeaths of 18 people.\r\nWith respect to maritime security and crimes at\r\nsea, my delegation is pleased to acknowledge the entry\r\ninto force on 1 July 2004 of the International Ship and\r\nPort Facility Security Code and related amendments to\r\nthe Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. We are\r\nencouraged by the steadily rising number of ships and\r\nport facilities that have had their port security plans\r\napproved.\r\nPoland supports the criminalization of the\r\nmaritime transport of weapons of mass destruction,\r\ntheir means of delivery and related materials in the\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts\r\nagainst the Safety of Maritime Navigation. We are\r\nfully committed to the Proliferation Security Initiative,\r\nwhich is an important tool in responding to the\r\ngrowing challenge posed by the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nWe believe that serious consideration should be\r\ngiven to proposals to include the transport of nuclear,\r\nchemical and biological weapons in the list of offences.\r\nWe continue to be deeply concerned about the increase\r\nin the number of reported acts of piracy and armed\r\nrobbery. We support the conclusion of regional\r\nagreements aimed at combating those crimes, including\r\nefforts against terrorism, and enhancing cooperation at\r\nregional levels.\r\nWith respect to the fisheries draft resolution\r\n(A/58/L.23), Poland is pleased that a significant\r\namount of emphasis was given to cooperation to\r\ncombat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. We\r\nare deeply concerned by the continued deterioration of\r\nmarine fish stocks worldwide. The situation is\r\nalarming, since almost half the major fish stocks are\r\nnow fully exploited and another 25 per cent are\r\noverexploited or significantly depleted.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation is pleased to recall\r\nthat on 19 February 2004, the Polish parliament\r\nadopted a fisheries act that constitutes a significant\r\nstep forward in its domestic legislation aimed at\r\nrationalizing and regulating activities related to fishing.\r\nIn addition, the Government of the Republic of Poland\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nis currently in the final stage of acceding to the\r\nAgreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\nrelating to the Conservation and Management of\r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish\r\nStocks. We hope that the effective implementation of\r\nthose legal instruments will bring us one step closer to\r\npreventing the further deterioration of fish stocks and\r\nenhancing the protection of the marine ecosystems and\r\nof biodiversity.\r\nIn conclusion, I am pleased to inform the General\r\nAssembly that my Government is currently in the\r\nprocess of acceding to the Agreement on the Privileges\r\nand Immunities of the International Tribunal for the\r\nLaw of the Sea and to the Protocol on the Privileges\r\nand Immunities of the International Seabed Authority.\r\nMr. Paolillo (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nwish to add a few brief comments to what was said by\r\nthe representative of Chile, who spoke on behalf of a\r\ngroup of countries to which Uruguay belongs.\r\nEvery year, my delegation awaits with a certain\r\nanxiety the reports of the Secretary-General on the\r\noceans and the law of the sea. This is because year\r\nafter year we hope that we will be told that the\r\nprogressive deterioration of the marine environment\r\nhas been checked and that the state of the oceans in\r\ngeneral and of their resources has improved.\r\nRegrettably, this year — as on previous\r\noccasions — that hope has been frustrated. Clearly, the\r\nreports before us (A/59/62 and Add.1, A/59/63 and\r\nA/59/126) provide abundant data on measures adopted\r\nand activities undertaken to face the threats that loom\r\nover the oceanic space. Legislation and regulations as\r\nwell as cooperative actions carried out by global and\r\nregional institutions have always occupied a large part\r\nof the Secretary-General’s reports, and they do so in\r\nthe reports submitted during the present session.\r\nThose reports describe new international\r\nregulations and measures adopted recently in various\r\nareas of the law of the sea — such as prevention and\r\nsuppression of crime at sea, security in international\r\nmaritime transport and protection of the marine\r\nenvironment. Furthermore, we welcome the existence\r\nof a network of programmes, plans of action and\r\ninstitutions that have undertaken vigorous regional\r\ncooperation activities aimed at protecting the marine\r\nenvironment in 18 marine and coastal regions. It is\r\ntherefore clear that in the 10 years since the entry into\r\nforce of the United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea, States and international institutions have\r\nfocused on the task of strengthening the international\r\noceans regime established by the Convention.\r\nHowever, and despite such activity in the spheres\r\nof regulation and cooperation, the reality presents a\r\ndiscouraging picture. The degradation of the coastal\r\nand marine environments has intensified. The threat\r\nposed to the health of the oceans by the past and\r\npresent dumping of hazardous substances into the sea\r\nand by the ecologically irresponsible scrapping of ships\r\ncontinues unabated. In certain regions of the world,\r\nthere is a constant risk of hydrocarbon pollution. The\r\ngeneral situation of all marine fish populations about\r\nwhich information is available continues to deteriorate\r\nbecause of overfishing, illegal, unregulated and\r\nunreported fishing and unsustainable fishing practices.\r\nThe number of cases of piracy, robbery, kidnapping\r\nand other acts of violence committed in the marine\r\nspace continues to increase in some regions of the\r\nworld, and the trafficking of immigrants and drugs\r\ncontinues to be a threat to security.\r\nThose trends persist, but not because of a lack of\r\nwarnings or regulations. The reports leave no room for\r\ndoubt as to the cause of the growing deterioration and\r\ndepletion of the marine space. That cause is rooted in\r\nthe indifferent or negligent behaviour of States that do\r\nnot adopt the policies, regulations and measures that\r\nthey have pledged to adopt or, if they adopt them, do\r\nnot implement them or act in a manner that is\r\nincompatible with or in open violation of\r\ninternationally undertaken commitments.\r\nAt the opening of the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\nreported how the rule of law is currently being\r\nbreached throughout the world and how ignoring and\r\nviolating the fundamental laws of international\r\ncoexistence threaten peace and security. Unfortunately,\r\nsuch breaching of the rule of law manifests itself in\r\nmany areas of international cooperation and is\r\npersistent and widespread in some sectors of the law of\r\nthe sea.\r\nWe understand that the best way to celebrate the\r\ntenth anniversary of the Convention’s entry into force\r\nis to comply with it and with the many subsequent\r\ninstruments that we have accepted to ensure its\r\nimplementation. We must recall that — as the\r\nSecretary-General said concerning the rule of law —\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nthe existence of the Convention as a mere concept is\r\nnot enough; the Convention must be respected and\r\ncomplied with, and it must pervade all State activities\r\nin the ocean environment. Let us also recall that the\r\nbasic message of the report in document A/59/62 is\r\nexpressed in its final paragraph, paragraph 307. It\r\nconsists of an appeal to all States to fully implement\r\nthe provisions of the Convention, in their legislation, in\r\ntheir administrations and in their daily practice.\r\nMoreover, in operative paragraph 4 of draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.22, States are requested to\r\nharmonize their national legislation with the\r\nConvention’s provisions and to ensure the consistent\r\napplication of those provisions. That portion of the\r\ntext, through its annual repetition, has become a\r\nroutine formula to which no one pays attention.\r\nHowever, in our opinion, it continues to be the most\r\nimportant appeal in this increasingly long resolution.\r\nThe increase in human activity in the deepest\r\nocean areas, made possible by technological\r\ndevelopment — particularly the capture of deep-water\r\nspecies — has caused growing alarm in the\r\ninternational community, because such activity has\r\nserious negative effects on the particularly vulnerable\r\nhabitats of those species.\r\nUruguay welcomes the importance being\r\naccorded by international forums to the issue of\r\nconserving and classifying the biological diversity of\r\nthe seabed beyond national jurisdiction. That vast\r\nreserve of compounds, materials and organisms located\r\nin the ocean depths offers the promise of great\r\neconomic, scientific and environmental resources, but\r\nthe exploitation of those resources is being carried out\r\nin a disorderly and ecologically irresponsible manner.\r\nFishing activities, the mining of the seabed, bio-\r\nprospecting and even scientific research are all\r\nactivities that threaten the integrity of the ecosystems\r\nlocated in areas beyond national jurisdiction. This\r\nproblem must become a priority item on the\r\ninternational agenda so that we can examine it in\r\ndepth, adopting an integral and multidisciplinary\r\napproach.\r\nWe therefore enthusiastically support the\r\nreferences in paragraphs 67 to 76 of draft resolution\r\nA/59/L.22 on the need to adopt measures to monitor\r\nthe threats to biological diversity in the seabed and to\r\ntackle certain destructive practices. We welcome the\r\ndecision to establish an ad hoc open-ended informal\r\nworking group, which would be responsible for\r\nstudying the problems of conservation and the\r\nsustainable use of marine biodiversity.\r\nThe International Seabed Authority — which in\r\nits first 10 years of existence and under the leadership\r\nof Mr. Satya Nandan successfully completed the\r\npreparatory phase of its tasks — is called upon to play\r\nan important role in formulating a strategy to protect\r\nthe biodiversity of the international zone. In\r\nformulating as soon as possible the draft regulation for\r\nthe prospecting and exploration of polymetallic\r\nsulphides and ferromanganese crusts, the Authority can\r\ncontribute substantially to the protection of the zone’s\r\nvulnerable ecosystems by adopting appropriate rules.\r\nUruguay continues to be concerned with the fact\r\nthat after having proved the destructive effects of\r\nbottom-trawling fishing nets, we have not yet been able\r\nto agree on adopting effective measures to put an end\r\nto — or at least limit — this practice, which causes\r\nirreversible damage to the marine environment. In that\r\nrespect, we find the content of paragraph 66 of the\r\ndraft resolution on sustainable fishing to be\r\ndisappointing.\r\nI would like to highlight the importance of the\r\nUnited Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, which held\r\nits fifth meeting this year. The fact that this forum is\r\nfocusing its deliberations on a limited number of topics\r\npreselected by the General Assembly, with the valuable\r\nparticipation of experts, ensures an enriching exchange\r\nof ideas and information and a dissemination of\r\nknowledge regarding the ocean space that is\r\nindispensable to the adoption of appropriate policies\r\nand regulations.\r\nFinally, in celebrating the tenth anniversary of the\r\nentry into force of the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea, we think it is also necessary to\r\ncelebrate the successful functioning of the institutions\r\nthat the Convention created: the International Tribunal\r\nfor the Law of the Sea, the International Seabed\r\nAuthority and the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf, as well as the productive and\r\nefficient work of the Division for Ocean Affairs and\r\nthe Law of the Sea. We extend our thanks to the\r\nauthorities and the personnel of those institutions.\r\nThe Acting President: We have now heard the\r\nlast speaker on our list on sub-items (a) and (b) for this\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nmeeting. We will continue this debate at 10 a.m.\r\ntomorrow.\r\nOne representative has asked to speak in exercise\r\nof the right of reply. May I remind members that\r\nstatements in the exercise of the right of reply are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to\r\nfive minutes for the second intervention and should be\r\nmade by delegations from their seats. I call upon the\r\nrepresentative of Chile.\r\nMr. Maquieira (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): In the\r\ndebate this afternoon, the representative of Bolivia\r\nmade a statement in which he referred to my country\r\nand to the Treaty of Peace and Friendship, which has\r\ngoverned our two countries’ relations since 1904. In\r\npresenting his perception of the Treaty he made a\r\nseries of misleading statements that I feel obliged to\r\ncorrect.\r\nFirst, the peace treaty between both countries was\r\nfreely examined, negotiated and concluded. The\r\nBolivian Government contributed substantive\r\ninitiatives and proposals regarding the Treaty, as noted\r\nin the documents that describe the negotiations. The\r\nTreaty of Peace and Friendship of 1904 was approved\r\nby a broad majority of the congresses of both countries\r\nat a time of economic progress and constitutional\r\nnormality in Chile and Bolivia. All its clauses, despite\r\nwhat was stated here today by the representative of\r\nBolivia, have been completely respected. This has led\r\nto relations of good neighbourliness and the\r\nestablishment of mechanisms for permanent bilateral\r\nconsultations and cooperation in various areas.\r\nThis Treaty guarantees a legal framework freely\r\nagreed upon and fully implemented by our countries\r\nand a regime of free transit and access to and from the\r\nsea for Bolivia in all circumstances. My country fulfils\r\nand will continue to fulfil that obligation so that this\r\naccess remains full and permanent. Free transit is a\r\npractical and daily reality between both countries.\r\nUnder this regime goods, vehicles, trucks and railways,\r\nas well as an oil pipeline, pass to and from the ports of\r\nArica and Antofagasto at all times and in all\r\ncircumstances. The Bolivian Government fulfils its\r\nresponsibilities in a regular manner and with no\r\nobstacles whatsoever, in accordance with existing\r\nagreements. The Chile-Bolivia border-crossing is\r\nspeedy and efficient and has been hailed by impartial\r\nparties, including the United Nations, as a useful and\r\nconstructive example for other border crossings in the\r\nregion.\r\nIn this context, it is important to reiterate my\r\ncountry’s firm and unwavering support for the\r\nprinciples and the validity of international treaties, as\r\nwell as its compliance with the agreed provisions. I\r\nwould like to state that this is not a multilateral topic\r\nand to reiterate that my country has declared on many\r\noccasions its willingness to have a dialogue with\r\nBolivia and has repeatedly proposed the restoration of\r\ndiplomatic relations. In that respect, we await Bolivia’s\r\ndecision to move towards dealing with issues of mutual\r\ninterest in accordance with the principles of bilateral\r\nrelations.\r\nMr. Araníbar Quiroga (Bolivia) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): After listening to the statement by the\r\nrepresentative of Chile — which expresses a position\r\noften repeated by Chile, since it reiterates that the\r\ntreaty between Bolivia and Chile regulates a normal\r\nsituation — I must once again refer to facts that are\r\nconclusive in that they demonstrate that what the treaty\r\ntried to resolve was not resolved. This is true not only\r\nwith regard to my country, for reasons that I have\r\nstated and that are repeated with increasing insistence\r\nin a public outcry to find a free, useful and sovereign\r\noutlet to the sea. There are also increasingly repeated,\r\nevident and unconcealable statements by the citizens of\r\nour sister country Chile that the treaty signed with\r\nBolivia needs to be updated to reflect new realities and\r\nmust allow for Bolivia’s useful, free and sovereign\r\naccess to the Pacific Ocean.\r\nThese are facts that are well known in the public\r\nopinion of both countries. It is equally well known that\r\nif this treaty had resolved what it should have, it would\r\nnot have led to negotiations on more than five\r\noccasions in the last century — in 1920, 1926, 1950,\r\n1975 and 1987 — aimed precisely at resolving what\r\nthis treaty did not resolve.\r\nIn that respect, we have to say again that the\r\npersistence of bilateral conflicts and the lack of\r\nmaritime access will prevent regional integration.\r\nBolivia considers that its landlocked situation is a\r\nmultilateral problem because of its geopolitical effect,\r\neconomic impact and the diplomacy involved. But\r\nBolivia declares that a bilateral negotiation with Chile\r\nis possible, and it is prepared to undertake it. Until that\r\nis done, Bolivia will continue to discuss the matter in\r\ninternational forums.\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.55\r\nNegotiations with Chile should have a clear\r\nobjective, and that is the signing of a new treaty that\r\naddresses the present issue. If we wish to have a vision\r\nof the twenty-first century we should not look\r\nbackwards, but rather we must look ahead, seeking the\r\nnegotiation of a new legal instrument between Chile\r\nand Bolivia that truly and genuinely will allow us to\r\nachieve peace and friendship between our peoples.\r\nMr. Maquieira (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I do\r\nnot wish to prolong this meeting unduly, therefore I\r\nwill simply confine myself to once again stating what\r\nmy delegation has reiterated, which is that between\r\nChile and Bolivia there is no type of territorial\r\nproblem.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to inform\r\nMembers that, at the request of the sponsor,\r\nconsideration of agenda item 161, entitled “Andean\r\nZone of Peace”, originally scheduled for Thursday\r\nafternoon, 18 November 2004, is postponed to\r\nThursday afternoon, 2 December 2004, after the\r\nconsideration of the reports of the Sixth Committee.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
