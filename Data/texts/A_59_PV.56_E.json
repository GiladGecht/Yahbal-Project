(Gabon)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Sevilla\r\nSomoza (Nicaragua), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 49 (continued)\r\nOceans and the law of the sea\r\n(a) Oceans and the law of the sea\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/59/62,\r\nA/59/62/Add.1, A/59/63 and A/59/126)\r\nReport on the work of the United Nations\r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on\r\nOceans and the Law of the Sea at its fifth\r\nmeeting (A/59/122)\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.22)\r\n(b) Sustainable fisheries, including through the\r\n1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the\r\nProvisions of the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982\r\nrelating to the Conservation and Management\r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory\r\nFish Stocks, and related instruments\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/59/298)\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.23)\r\nMr. Kuzmenkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The Russian Federation attaches great\r\nimportance to the General Assembly’s consideration of\r\ncooperation on oceans and the Law of the Sea. This\r\nyear marks the tenth anniversary of the entry into force\r\nof the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea, which is the basis of contemporary relations\r\namong States on the marine environment. We fully\r\nconcur with the positive statements about the\r\nConvention that we have heard today, as it is the key\r\ninternational legal instrument in the area of marine\r\nactivities, establishing a unified regime for cooperation\r\non marine affairs. It reflects in a just and balanced\r\nmanner the interests of all States and coordinates the\r\nvarious State activities in the area of the sea. We call\r\non States that have not yet acceded to the Convention\r\nto do so in the near future. We are convinced that\r\nfurther development of international maritime law\r\nshould proceed on the basis of compliance with the\r\nregime established by the 1982 Convention.\r\nThis year was replete with various events and\r\nactivities relating to the law of the sea. With respect to\r\nthe activities of the International Seabed Authority, we\r\nare impressed by the progress it made in elaborating\r\ndraft rules for locating and mining polymetallic\r\nsulphides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts.\r\nHowever, we have doubts about the advisability of\r\ngiving that body special jurisdiction to protect marine\r\nbiological resources.\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.56\r\nWe believe that it would be very useful to\r\ndevelop international cooperation for the adoption of\r\nfurther measures to strengthen oversight by flag States\r\nof vessels sailing under their flag.\r\nWe share the hopes expressed by many\r\ndelegations in connection with the establishment of the\r\nUnited Nations Oceans programme, which is aimed at\r\na better coordination of the activities of organizations\r\ndealing with ocean affairs and at preventing the\r\nduplication that often arises, given the extensive\r\nnetwork of organizations and the vast challenges they\r\nface.\r\nThe Russian Federation welcomes the application\r\nof Brazil — and of Australia too, as we were informed\r\ntoday — to the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf requesting delineation of the limits\r\nof their continental shelf. We await with interest the\r\nresults of the Australian and Brazilian applications to\r\nthe Commission.\r\nThe Russian Federation has also requested the\r\ndelimitation of the continental shelf for the areas of the\r\nArctic and Pacific Oceans. Currently, the relevant\r\nministries and research institutions of the Russian\r\nFederation are working to prepare the additional\r\ninformation required by the Commission, and we are\r\nworking on resolving bilateral questions that have\r\narisen in connection with the Russian Federation\r\nsubmission.\r\nGiven that in the next five years the Commission\r\nwill receive approximately 10 more such requests,\r\nattention should be given to creating the conditions for\r\nits smooth and effective functioning, since the\r\nCommission’s workload is growing considerably.\r\nThe Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and\r\nthe Law of the Sea, whose fifth session took place last\r\nspring, has made a major contribution to our\r\ndiscussion. We believe it is important to emphasize that\r\nthe great potential of the Informal Consultative\r\nProcess, with the equal participation of governmental\r\nexperts and representatives of international\r\norganizations that deal with this subject, is making it\r\npossible to properly resolve complex problems\r\ninvolving cooperation on the world’s oceans in order to\r\nidentify long-term forms of interaction. The\r\nConsultative Process should make a specific\r\ncontribution to the cause of sustainable development.\r\nHowever, we draw attention to counterproductive\r\nattempts to expand the mandate of the Informal\r\nConsultative Process and give it oversight functions of\r\nmonitoring States’ compliance with their obligations\r\nunder the 1982 Convention. The General Assembly is\r\ndoing its job successfully, as are the Meetings of States\r\nParties to the 1982 Convention.\r\nI would like to say a few words about the\r\ndecisions of the fifty-second session of the Marine\r\nEnvironment Protection Committee of the International\r\nMaritime Organization (IMO) and about recognizing\r\nparticularly sensitive Western European sea areas. We\r\nthink it necessary to emphasize that addressing\r\nregulatory lacunae for particularly sensitive sea areas\r\nshould not result in the restriction of the legitimate\r\nrights and interests of other States. That applies in\r\nparticular to the principle of freedom of navigation. We\r\nhope that the proposals of the Working Group, which\r\nwas established pursuant to the decision of the\r\nCommittee for the Protection of the Marine\r\nEnvironment in order to improve the IMO’s current\r\nguidelines to establish these particularly sensitive sea\r\nareas, can find answers to those questions, taking into\r\naccount the legitimate interests of all States.\r\nAnother important area for international\r\ncooperation on marine affairs is the establishment of a\r\nregular process for a global assessment of the state of\r\nthe maritime environment. The first results of the\r\ndiscussion of that problem have been modest to say the\r\nleast, and we cannot find them satisfactory. It is crucial\r\nto make an additional effort to ensure prompt and\r\ncomplete initiation of its work. In that context, we need\r\nto establish a transparent process with a clear structure,\r\nwhile avoiding the duplication of functions of the\r\ninternational organization that already exists for that\r\npurpose and the imposition of any additional,\r\nuntenable financial burdens on States.\r\nOne of the key instruments in the area of\r\nconservation and management of marine living\r\nresources and fish stocks is the 1995 Agreement on the\r\nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish\r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.  The Russian\r\ndelegation views with interest the proposal to hold an\r\nearly 2006 review conference on compliance with the\r\nConvention, and we intend to participate actively in the\r\npreparatory process and the conference itself.\r\nIn conclusion, I thank the Secretary-General for\r\nthe very professional reports that he has submitted to\r\nthe General Assembly on this agenda item. The\r\nRussian Federation commends the draft resolutions that\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.56\r\nhave been prepared on oceans and the law of the sea\r\nand on sustainable fisheries (A/59/L.22 and L.23). I am\r\nsure that much credit for that should be given to the\r\ncoordinators. I take this opportunity to convey to them\r\nour sincere recognition for the work they have done.\r\nWe will support the adoption of the draft resolutions\r\nbefore the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Kendall (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nArgentine delegation associates itself with a statement\r\nmade yesterday by the representative of Chile, whose\r\nviews we share. We wish in particular, as other\r\ndelegations have done, to highlight the commemoration\r\nof the tenth anniversary of the entry into force of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,\r\nwhich establishes the basic legal framework for\r\nactivities carried out in the oceans and seas, and for\r\ntheir sustainable development.\r\nIssues covered by the agenda item on oceans and\r\nthe law of the sea are multifaceted, complex and of\r\ngreat interest to our country. I shall not go into them in\r\nany depth, because Chile in its statement has already\r\ndone so. However, we do wish to express our thanks to\r\nthe coordinators of the draft resolutions now before us,\r\nMr. Marcos de Almeida of Brazil and Jennifer McIver\r\nof New Zealand on the issue of the law of the sea and\r\noceans and Ms. Holly Koehler of the United States on\r\nthe issue of sustainable fisheries, for the excellent job\r\nthat they have done. We are also grateful to the\r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and Law of the Sea of the\r\nOffice of Legal Affairs for their assistance throughout\r\nthe negotiating process. Negotiating texts of such\r\ndrafts is a complex and lengthy process in view of the\r\nrange and scope of the issues covered in them. For this\r\nreason, for future negotiations, a calendar of meetings\r\nshould be planned that would not overlap with those of\r\nthe Sixth Committee.\r\nLastly, on the question of sustainable fisheries,\r\nwe wish to refer briefly to the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on sustainable fisheries (A/59/298), which in\r\nparagraph 151 speaks of principal gaps in the coverage\r\nof existing measures adopted by regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations.\r\nI would like to make the point in this regard that\r\nthe gaps identified by the Secretary-General in the\r\nreport are not jurisdictional in nature as the paragraph\r\nseems to imply. These gaps have to do with the\r\nabsence of any established regional fisheries\r\norganization designed to implement conservation\r\nmeasures. When such gaps are identified, we need to\r\ntake into account the causes behind them, such as\r\nunresolved sovereignty disputes.\r\nMr. Gala López (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nToday on the tenth anniversary of the entry into force\r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea, we are extremely gratified to note that the\r\nConvention is still as relevant and valid, and has\r\nupheld its universal character and fundamental\r\nimportance for the maintenance and strengthening of\r\ninternational peace and security, as well as for the\r\nsustainable development of oceans and seas.\r\nMy delegation places special emphasis on the\r\nneed to enhance international cooperation among all\r\nactors involved in the management of the seas and\r\noceans, including exchange of knowledge and\r\ncapacity-building, which are aspects of key importance\r\nfor developing countries. My country, given its\r\ngeography, has a particular interest in issues relating to\r\nthe seas and oceans. In spite of the serious economic\r\ndifficulties that we face, we have striven and are still\r\nstriving to implement national strategies for the\r\nsustainable development and protection of the marine\r\nenvironment in order to ensure the implementation of\r\nthe Convention in a consistent and effective manner.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea sets up a sound and universally recognized\r\nlegal framework, within which all activities affecting\r\nthe oceans and the seas should be carried out. For this\r\nreason, we draw attention to the policies and initiatives\r\nof certain States that contravene the Convention, as, for\r\nexample, the Proliferation Security Initiative relating to\r\nweapons of mass destruction. If that Initiative were put\r\ninto effect, it would, in our opinion, disregard the\r\ngenerally accepted rules concerning the interception of\r\nvessels and the legal regime governing the various\r\nmaritime spaces.\r\nWe also wish to point out that any activity of a\r\ncommercial nature relating to biological diversity in\r\nareas beyond national jurisdiction should be governed\r\nby the principles established in the Convention, which\r\nprovides that maritime scientific research in the area\r\nshould be carried out exclusively for peaceful purposes\r\nand for the benefit of humankind as a whole. In this\r\nregard, we are happy to see the establishment of an\r\nopen-ended ad hoc working group responsible for\r\nstudying issues relating to the conservation and\r\nsustainable use of marine biological diversity outside\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.56\r\nareas of national jurisdiction, as indicated in the draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.22, on which we shall be taking\r\naction today.\r\nIn conclusion, let me express thanks for the\r\nefforts of the coordinators of the two draft resolutions,\r\nas well as to the Secretary-General for his report on the\r\noceans and the law of the sea, as well as for the work\r\nof the Division of Ocean Affairs and Law of the Sea in\r\nthis area.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with\r\nAssembly resolution 54/195 of 17 December 1999, I\r\nnow call on the observer of the International Union for\r\nthe Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.\r\nMs. Kimball (International Union for the\r\nConservation of Nature and Natural Resources): The\r\nInternational Union for the Conservation of Nature and\r\nNatural Resources is pleased to join today in\r\ncelebrating tenth anniversary of the entry into force of\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nIt is an impressive constitutional document, and, like\r\nany such document, it contemplates elaboration and\r\nfurther development. Sustainable ocean management\r\nrequires it. More than seventy per cent of harvested\r\nfish stocks worldwide are fished at or beyond their\r\nsustainable limit. As fishers turn to new stocks of\r\nspecies at greater depth, these too are increasingly\r\ndepleted.\r\nThe impact of destructive fishing practices on a\r\nwide range of marine species is well-documented, from\r\nsea turtles and sea birds to sharks and corals. In deep-\r\nsea areas, bottom-trawling has destroyed vital coral\r\ncommunities and thoroughly depleted target fish stocks\r\nassociated with sea mounts. Extinctions of the many\r\nunique species found around sea mounts are already\r\nlikely. In most cases, regional arrangements for these\r\nhigh seas fisheries still focus narrowly on fishery\r\nresources and ignore important habitat and non-target\r\nspecies. There are not even bodies competent to\r\nregulate these fisheries in large areas of the world’s\r\noceans.\r\nThese severe declines and emerging extinctions\r\nhave a widespread impact on global biodiversity. They\r\nalso have enormous implications for world food\r\nsecurity and human livelihoods. In addition, the\r\nrealization of future benefits from sustainable use of\r\nthese resources is seriously undermined.\r\nIf we are to maintain the productivity of marine\r\nspecies and ecosystems, we can no longer delay the\r\nshift to a more integrated, ecosystem approach to ocean\r\nand fisheries management. Precautionary measures are\r\nessential. This will be an important charge for the Ad\r\nHoc Open-ended Informal Working Group to be\r\nestablished by the General Assembly. Setting a\r\npractical and focused agenda for that Group will be\r\ncritical.\r\nThe General Assembly has now explicitly\r\nrecognized bottom trawling as a destructive fishing\r\npractice and a pressing threat to vulnerable marine\r\necosystems. The International Union for the\r\nConservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN)\r\nregrets that more forceful action could not be agreed to\r\nprohibit this destructive fishing practice on an interim\r\nbasis in international waters. The absence of such\r\nshort-term measures means further destruction and loss\r\nof seabed biodiversity until States and regional bodies\r\ncan agree on adequate conservation and management\r\nmeasures. IUCN and other conservation organizations\r\nwill be tracking progress over the next year.\r\nAnother urgent need is a global process to\r\nmonitor and assess the state of the marine environment.\r\nFor deep-sea biodiversity and ecosystems, the call in\r\nthe draft resolutions for more research is helpful, but a\r\npolicy-relevant scientific assessment, based on\r\navailable information, would establish a baseline for\r\nfuture research and assessment, underscore what is at\r\nstake for the international community and expedite\r\nagreement on appropriate measures. In view of the\r\ndelay in establishing a regular global marine\r\nassessment, IUCN urges that the Intergovernmental\r\nOceanographic Commission of UNESCO, in\r\ncollaboration with relevant organizations and in\r\nconsultation with States, be encouraged to prepare such\r\nan assessment as soon as possible.\r\nIn the medium term, an ecosystem approach\r\nmeans a significant makeover in most regional fishery\r\nmanagement organizations, based on the principles and\r\nmeasures of the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement\r\nand the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries of\r\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United\r\nNations. This should ensure equal treatment for all\r\nhigh-seas fisheries.\r\nFor the seabed beyond national jurisdiction, an\r\necosystem approach means that all activities should be\r\nheld to the same standards of environmental protection\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.56\r\nand conservation — whether minerals development,\r\nbottom trawling, or others. It is useful to recall in this\r\nrespect that the International Seabed Authority’s rules\r\nrequire environmental assessment in advance of\r\nminerals exploration.\r\nA new challenge this year is seabed genetic\r\nresources beyond national jurisdiction. Many\r\nrepresentatives have suggested that this issue be\r\naddressed in a manner consistent with the principles of\r\nthe Convention on Biological Diversity and the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. IUCN\r\nbelieves that international cooperation can provide for\r\nthe conservation and sustainable use of these resources\r\nand for equity in their utilization. It can also strengthen\r\ncollaborative scientific research and build knowledge\r\nand capacity for biodiversity conservation. The new\r\nWorking Group can help ensure adequate factual\r\nbackground preparation as a common starting point for\r\nconsidering options and approaches.\r\nTo implement an ecosystem approach, IUCN sees\r\nmarine protected area networks as a critical tool,\r\nincluding in areas within and beyond national\r\njurisdiction. Beyond national jurisdiction, they have an\r\nimportant role to play in preserving unique and\r\nrepresentative deep-sea biodiversity and its\r\nbiotechnology potential.\r\nOn two final points, IUCN urges that the inter-\r\nagency Oceans and Coastal Areas Network (UN-\r\nOceans) be given a defined role regarding biodiversity\r\nconservation in areas beyond national jurisdiction. It\r\ncould support the new Working Group in the\r\npreparation of policy-relevant scientific assessments.\r\nOver the longer term, it could facilitate the\r\ndevelopment of coherent marine protected area\r\nnetworks.\r\nSecondly, IUCN reiterates its call for a major\r\nupgrade in national, regional and global arrangements\r\nfor compliance with and enforcement of international\r\nrules in order to eliminate all those who profit from\r\nillegal at-sea activities. A systematic approach is\r\nincreasingly urgent.\r\nOnce again, we commend the excellence of the\r\nSecretary-General’s comprehensive reports on oceans\r\nand fisheries.\r\nMr. Talbot (Guyana): Guyana attaches great\r\nimportance to the ongoing debate on oceans and the\r\nlaw of the sea, a debate we consider greatly enriched\r\nby the reports of the Secretary-General under this item.\r\nWe are pleased to participate in the deliberations at the\r\npresent session, which marks the tenth anniversary of\r\nthe entry into force of the United Nations Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea.\r\nI would like to state at the outset that my\r\ndelegation fully subscribes to the statement made by\r\nthe Permanent Representative of Barbados on behalf of\r\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM). The\r\nintervention I will make today is largely in support of\r\nthe view expressed in the CARICOM statement at the\r\n54th meeting of the General Assembly that\r\n“the benefits to be derived from areas to which\r\nthe principle of the common heritage of mankind\r\napplies must be accessible to all mankind and not\r\njust limited to the commercial interests that seek\r\nto exploit its rich biodiversity for profit”.\r\nLaw is an instrument of social control that,\r\nwhether domestic or international, must be adapted to\r\nthe exigencies of change occurring in the society or\r\nsystem to which it relates, if it is to preserve its\r\nrelevance and effectiveness. Change being imminent in\r\nall forms of human social organization, law norms, far\r\nfrom being immutable and fixed, are always in a state\r\nof becoming. The process of change is exemplified, for\r\nexample, by the scope of domestic jurisdiction today,\r\nwhich has evolved because of the increased\r\npreoccupation of the international community with\r\nmatters that had, hitherto, appertained to the domestic\r\njurisdiction of a State. We may also note that the legal\r\nstatus of the continental shelf itself has emerged in\r\nresponse to scientific and exploitability developments.\r\nThe list of examples is unending.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea was correctly characterized by Mr. Hans\r\nCorell, former Under-Secretary-General for Legal\r\nAffairs, as perhaps the single greatest legal codification\r\nachievement of the international community in the\r\ntwentieth century. But it is evident that the Convention\r\nwas never intended to be the be all and end all of\r\nprescriptions relating to the law of the sea. Not only is\r\ninternal evidence of this reality contained in the\r\ndocument itself, the actual determination of what was\r\nmeant by the “common heritage of mankind” was not\r\nfixed for all time, but would have to be interpreted\r\nflexibly as the related realities manifested themselves\r\nor became known to humankind. Prescriptions that are\r\ngrounded on the state of human knowledge at a given\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.56\r\npoint in time must inevitably be changed or\r\nreinterpreted when the inadequacies and imperfections\r\nof that state of knowledge become apparent. We ought\r\nnot to have opportunistic regimes crafted on such\r\nimperfections.\r\nThe allocation of marine resources worldwide has\r\na sadly chequered history. The determining factor in\r\nsuch allocations has until quite recently been the\r\npossession of naval power and national wealth. The\r\ngreater the complement in each of these categories, the\r\nlarger the volume of marine resources accruing to the\r\nState or Power involved.\r\nPerhaps the major effect of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea was to effectuate a\r\nmore equitable distribution of marine resources\r\nworldwide. The extension of the territorial sea, the\r\ncreation of the exclusive economic zone, the\r\nessentially declaratory codification of the rules\r\ngoverning the continental shelf, and the establishment\r\nof the common heritage of mankind encompassing the\r\nseabed and the subsoil in areas beyond the limits of\r\nnational jurisdiction have largely eliminated the earlier\r\nmode of resource allocation in marine affairs.\r\nFurther, it seems clear that the contemporary\r\nunderstanding of the seabed and its resources beyond\r\nthe limits of national jurisdiction is radically at\r\nvariance with what that understanding was at the time\r\nof the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea. And it is reasonable to infer from that manifest\r\nreality that the scope and range of the Convention with\r\nrespect to the definition of the common heritage of\r\nmankind would have been more inclusive, had the\r\noriginal negotiators known what we know today. It all\r\nhas to do, in our view, with exploitability — with\r\ndevelopments in science that expand, for the\r\ncommunity, accessibility to valuable resources that\r\nwere unknown earlier but are known or at least\r\npartially known now.\r\nGuyana believes that the international community\r\nshould not be imprisoned by an interpretation of a\r\ntreaty that derives from an incomplete understanding of\r\nreality. Rather, it is our view that the community\r\nshould proceed by analogical reasoning to adapt\r\ncurrent regimes to new circumstances and\r\nunderstandings as necessary in order to provide a more\r\ncomplete comprehension of reality; and we believe\r\nthere is abundant precedent for this manner of\r\nproceeding in international law. The Vienna\r\nConvention on the Law of Treaties contains the\r\nconcept of clausula rebus sic stantibus — whereby\r\nprovisions of a treaty may be nullified if the present\r\ncircumstances are such that, had they been known at\r\nthe time of the original negotiations, that particular\r\ntreaty project would never have been concluded.\r\nGuyana is not for a moment suggesting that the\r\ntowering accomplishment of the international\r\ncommunity that is embodied in the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea be destroyed or in\r\nany way weakened. Rather, our suggestion is that we\r\nshould craft our interpretations of the common heritage\r\nof mankind so as to enable us to capture its entire\r\npresent signification — a signification that has been\r\ntransformed by a new reality which, had that really\r\nbeen known at the time of the initial negotiations\r\nleading up to the Convention, would presumably have\r\nlead to a clearer result.\r\nIt is appropriate that we remind ourselves that all\r\nlaw is concerned with the protection of particular\r\ninterests, which change over time in response to\r\nchanges in the distribution of political power within a\r\ngiven entity or system. It would, therefore, inevitably\r\nfollow that the greater the number of interests\r\nprotected, the greater the legitimacy of the prevailing\r\nprotective arrangements.\r\nIn this regard, the law of the sea arrangements\r\nwhich pre-dated the Convention lost much of their\r\nlegitimacy with decolonization and the emergence of a\r\nlarge number of new States possessing new interests\r\nthat had to be taken into account by the international\r\nlegal system. It is partly because of this emergence that\r\nwe have seen major changes introduced into\r\ninternational law, including changes in the law of the\r\nsea, which are reflected in the Convention.\r\nGuyana considers that inadvertent omissions\r\nfrom the contemporary consensus that constitutes the\r\nlaw of the sea should not, as we craft solutions for new\r\nsituations not previously anticipated, cause us to\r\nregress as a result of actions which ignore the\r\nunderlying spirit and intended purpose of the\r\nConvention. In this regard, it would appear that the\r\nenvironmental protection conventions are instructive,\r\nand in this connection, I refer particularly to what are\r\ntermed “framework conventions”, in which present\r\ngaps or insufficiencies in human knowledge are frankly\r\nacknowledged, while some prescriptions in such\r\nconventions are being filled in as the relevant\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.56\r\nknowledge pertaining to those areas is developed. We\r\nsubmit that it would be helpful to the contemporary\r\ndiscussion of the law of the sea if the international\r\ncommunity were to view the Convention as itself\r\nbeing, at least partially, a “framework convention”, and\r\nif we were to proceed to deal with lacunae and larger\r\nassociated problems that might emerge in the spirit of\r\nequity and fairness that undergirds the Convention, and\r\nin which the concept of the common heritage of\r\nmankind, as it relates to the law of the sea, was born.\r\nGuyana believes that to proceed otherwise would be to\r\ntake a step backwards, since this would restore the\r\nstratification in marine resource allocation that we\r\nthought had already been rejected.\r\nThe magnitude of a State’s power and resources\r\nshould not alone determine the complement of marine\r\nresources allocated to that State. Rather, it is Guyana’s\r\nview that the only just manner of proceeding is the\r\nequitable allocation of marine resources.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 51/6 of 24 October 1996,\r\nI now call on His Excellency Mr. Satya Nandan,\r\nSecretary-General of the International Seabed\r\nAuthority.\r\nMr. Nandan (International Seabed Authority):\r\nTen years since the entry into force of the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)\r\nis a good time to assess its contributions to peace and\r\ngood order in the oceans. Unfortunately, in the short\r\ntime available to address this Assembly, it is difficult\r\nto do such an assessment in any detail.\r\nIt would be fair to say that, overall, the\r\nConvention has been a remarkable success. The United\r\nNations can feel justly proud of this great achievement.\r\nBecause of the outstanding success of the Convention,\r\nthe law of the sea is generally taken for granted, with\r\nlittle thought given to its complex and multifaceted\r\nnature and the way in which it has carefully balanced\r\nand woven together competing uses and claims. Nor is\r\nthe fact that the Convention continues to make an\r\nimmense contribution to global peace and security\r\nadequately appreciated.\r\nThe achievements of the Convention are many.\r\nThe Convention has provided stability and certainty in\r\nthe international law of the sea. By defining the rights\r\nand duties of States, it has provided the basis for the\r\nconduct of relations between and among States on\r\nmaritime issues. It has provided a sound legal\r\nframework for States to conduct activities in the\r\noceans. The comprehensive report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, prepared so ably by the Division for Ocean\r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea, not only demonstrates\r\nthe diversity of oceans-related issues, but also\r\nillustrates clearly that the Convention is widely seen by\r\nStates, international organizations and judicial bodies\r\nas the primary source of international law of the sea.\r\nThis is further reflected in the consistency with which\r\nthe Convention is applied in State practice.\r\nWhere the international community has not\r\nsucceeded, however, is in the discharge of the\r\nresponsibilities assumed by States under the\r\nConvention. As the two draft resolutions before the\r\nAssembly demonstrate, the international community\r\ncannot feel satisfied that its efforts in ocean\r\ngovernance have been successful. States need to\r\ndevelop management strategies that balance sound\r\necological practices with economic needs, and adopt an\r\necosystem approach in order to ensure long-term\r\nsustainable use of the oceans and their resources. For\r\nthis to be achieved there is a need for capacity-building\r\nwith strong emphasis placed on promoting scientific\r\nand environmental literacy. Knowledge will produce\r\ninformed decision makers and promote ethical\r\nstewardship of the seas and oceans.\r\nThis year is also the tenth anniversary of the\r\nestablishment of the International Seabed Authority,\r\nwhich came into existence upon the entry into force of\r\nthe Convention. The Authority celebrated this event in\r\nMay of this year during its regular session by holding a\r\ntwo-day commemorative session that was addressed by\r\nthe President of the Assembly, the Secretary-General of\r\nthe Authority, the Prime Minister of Jamaica, the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations through the\r\nthen Acting Legal Counsel, the President of the\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Chairman of\r\nthe Preparatory Commission. Messages were also\r\nreceived from the President of the third United Nations\r\nConference on the Law of the Sea and the first\r\nChairman of the Preparatory Commission, and\r\nstatements were made by the chairmen of the regional\r\ngroups. Two panel discussions were held on the\r\nachievements of the Authority in its first 10 years and\r\non its future direction. This was followed by scientific\r\npresentations on the various mineral resources in the\r\ndeep seabed and on the marine environment in which\r\nthey are found. The annual report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Authority (ISBA/10/A/3) this year\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.56\r\ncontains a review of the Authority’s work and\r\ndevelopment over the past 10 years. I recommend it to\r\nthose who would like to know more about the\r\nfunctioning of the Authority.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to thank the\r\nmember States of the Authority that for the past ten\r\nyears have supported and guided its development. I\r\nalso wish to express my appreciation for the many\r\nencouraging remarks made by delegations in this\r\nAssembly on the work of the Authority. I believe this\r\nto be a positive indication of the commitment of\r\nmember States to see the Authority fulfil its\r\nresponsibilities in accordance with the 1982 United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the\r\n1994 Agreement relating to the Implementation of\r\nPart XI of the Convention. I also wish to acknowledge\r\nwith gratitude the kind remarks made by delegations\r\nupon my re-election as Secretary-General.\r\nLast year, I informed the Assembly that the\r\nAuthority was about to adopt a three-year programme\r\nof work. This was done at the tenth session. The\r\nsubstantive work programme of the Authority is based\r\non the provisions of the Convention and the\r\nAgreement, in particular section I, paragraph 5, of the\r\nannex to the Agreement. The work of the Authority has\r\nprogressively become more scientific and technical. It\r\nis based largely on marine scientific research in the\r\ndeep ocean and on the need to develop a better\r\nunderstanding of the deep ocean environment. Indeed,\r\none of the basic responsibilities of the Authority under\r\nthe Convention is to promote and encourage marine\r\nscientific research in the deep seabed and to\r\ndisseminate the results of such research. The Authority\r\nis also mandated to ensure effective protection of the\r\nmarine environment from harmful effects which may\r\narise from activities in the deep seabed. The Authority\r\nhas attempted to carry out its mandates in two ways.\r\nThe first is by holding technical workshops which\r\nbring together internationally recognized scientists,\r\nexperts, researchers, contractors for exploration,\r\nrepresentatives of the offshore mining industry and\r\nrepresentatives of Member States. The most recent\r\nworkshop, held in September this year, adopted\r\nrecommendations on the establishment of\r\nenvironmental baselines and monitoring programmes\r\nfor polymetallic sulphides and cobalt crusts. The\r\nrecommendations from this workshop will be presented\r\nto the Legal and Technical Commission of the\r\nAuthority for its consideration and adoption.\r\nSecondly, the Authority promotes marine\r\nscientific research through selected scientific research\r\nprogrammes being undertaken by international\r\nscientists. The Authority is currently associated with\r\nwhat is known as the Kaplan project, which is designed\r\nto measure biodiversity, species range and gene flow in\r\nthe Clarion-Clipperton Zone in the North-East Pacific.\r\nThis is the region for which the Authority has already\r\nissued six exploration contracts. The information\r\ngained from this project will be used to determine the\r\npotential risks for marine life as a result of mining for\r\nmanganese nodules.\r\nThe first set of detailed results and analyses from\r\nthis project should be available by the summer of 2005.\r\nThe outputs will include a database of some of the\r\nimportant species found in the Clarion-Clipperton\r\nZone, including their genetic sequences. This will, in\r\nfact, be the first project of its kind to assess the genetic\r\nresources in the nodule province. Information on the\r\nbiodiversity derived from this project will be\r\nsuperimposed on the geological model which the\r\nAuthority is developing for that zone. The model will\r\nconsiderably enhance our knowledge of the geological\r\nand biological environment of that area.\r\nThe Authority will also be promoting two\r\nprogrammes within the Census of Marine Life which\r\nare directly relevant to its work. These are the work\r\nbeing undertaken by the Chemosynthetic Ecosystems\r\nGroup (ChEss) and the Seamounts Group (CenSeam).\r\nBoth of these cover the environments where\r\npolymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich crusts are found.\r\nThe Council of the Authority is currently considering\r\nregulations for exploration for those resources.\r\nPolymetallic sulphides are found at hydrothermal\r\nvent sites, which are areas of the seabed where\r\nmineral-rich super-heated water emerges from the\r\nseabed, producing mineral chimneys that support a vast\r\ndiversity of life. Cobalt-rich crusts, on the other hand,\r\nare usually found on seamounts, which often support\r\nfauna specific to them — meaning that the species are\r\nnot found elsewhere. The vulnerability of seamount\r\ncommunities and the concern for their protection has\r\nclearly been highlighted in recent years through the\r\ndiscussions regarding destructive fishing methods on\r\nseamounts. This issue was a subject of discussion at\r\nthe United Nations Informal Consultative Process and\r\nis also referred to in the two draft resolutions before\r\nthe General Assembly. For the Authority, it is\r\nimportant to understand the ecology of seamounts and\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.56\r\nthe nature of the fauna and flora that exist there and to\r\ndetermine what measures need to be taken in order to\r\nminimize any harmful effects from mining-related\r\nactivities.\r\nIt is a matter of grave concern that, while the\r\nAuthority is in the process of developing guidelines for\r\nthe application of precautionary measures for the\r\nprotection of the ecosystem on the seamounts on a\r\nscientific basis, there are fishing activities which,\r\nthrough the use of certain types of gear, are\r\nindiscriminately destroying the very same ecosystem.\r\nMarine scientific research is an essential tool for\r\nocean governance. It increases knowledge of the ocean\r\nenvironment and enables us to take sound management\r\ndecisions concerning its resources. For the Authority,\r\nsuch knowledge is important to ensure that the\r\nregulations and guidelines it adopts are scientifically\r\nsound. Despite the progress that has been made in\r\nmarine scientific research in recent years, the fact is\r\nthat our knowledge of the oceans remains insignificant.\r\nWe know more about the surface of the moon than\r\nabout the ocean on which life on earth depends.\r\nConcern about the lack of scientific information\r\nin the development of effective ocean policy was\r\nrecently echoed in the introductory statement of the\r\nChairman of the United States Commission on Ocean\r\nPolicy when he introduced the Commission’s final\r\nreport, entitled Ocean Blueprint for the Twenty-First\r\nCentury, to the United States Senate Committee on\r\nCommerce, Science and Transportation. He stated that\r\n“An effective national ocean policy should\r\nbe based on unbiased, credible, and up-to-date\r\nscientific information. Unfortunately, the oceans\r\nremain one of the least explored and most poorly\r\nunderstood environments on the planet, despite\r\nsome tantalizing discoveries over the last\r\ncentury.”\r\nThe need for a better knowledge of the ocean\r\nenvironment is self-evident. One need only read the\r\ndraft resolutions before the Assembly to recognize that\r\nthe number of actions that States are being asked to\r\ntake can be implemented effectively only if States have\r\nsound scientific knowledge of the marine environment.\r\nIt is for that reason that last year in my statement I\r\nurged the General Assembly to adopt a declaration in\r\nsupport of enhanced efforts in marine scientific\r\nresearch through national, regional and global\r\nprogrammes in order to generate new impetus in\r\nmarine scientific research. Such a declaration will have\r\nno financial implications for the United Nations. On\r\nthe other hand, it will serve to encourage Governments,\r\nintergovernmental organizations, non-governmental\r\norganizations, charitable foundations and scientific\r\ninstitutions to give high priority to marine scientific\r\nresearch, from which all of us can benefit.\r\nThe two rather comprehensive draft resolutions\r\nbefore the Assembly, contained in documents\r\nA/59/L.22 and A/59/L.23, refer to a variety of subject\r\nareas, and it is difficult to cover them all. I would like\r\nto congratulate the coordinators of the draft resolutions\r\nand others who assisted them for highlighting the many\r\nimportant issues pertaining to ocean governance. I\r\nwish to express my appreciation for the references to\r\nthe Authority and its work and also to the need for\r\ntimely contributions by Member States. I would like to\r\ninform the Assembly that the eleventh regular session\r\nof the Authority will be held from 15 to 26 August\r\n2005. This will be preceded by a one-week meeting of\r\nthe Legal and Technical Commission. I might mention\r\nthat there is a good prospect that the Authority may\r\nreceive a new application for a nodule exploration\r\nlicence by the next session.\r\nI would also like to renew the request for\r\nMember States to contribute to the Authority’s\r\nvoluntary fund to facilitate the participation of\r\ndeveloping country members of the Legal and\r\nTechnical Commission and the Finance Committee in\r\nthe work of those bodies.\r\nSince I had the honour to serve as the Chairman\r\nof the United Nations Conference on Highly Migratory\r\nFish Stocks and Straddling Fish Stocks and was the\r\narchitect of the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement\r\n(UNSFA), which was adopted in 1995, I cannot resist\r\nmaking a few comments concerning the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/59/L.23 on\r\nsustainable fisheries. I would first like to express\r\nsatisfaction at the entry into force of the Fish Stocks\r\nAgreement and the adoption of its provisions in a\r\nnumber of regional fisheries organizations — in\r\nparticular through the new Western and Central Pacific\r\nOcean Fish Stocks Convention, which entered into\r\nforce in June 2004, and the South-East Atlantic\r\nFisheries Organization Convention, which entered into\r\nforce in 2003.\r\nAs stated in the draft resolution, under the terms\r\nof the UNFSA, a review conference is scheduled for\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.56\r\n2006. In the light of a number of issues raised in the\r\ndraft resolution with respect to high seas fisheries, the\r\nreview conference might be an appropriate forum to\r\nconsider a number of those issues. It may be useful to\r\nbegin to consider how they can be addressed.\r\nPerhaps the first point to make is that the UNFSA\r\nis a strong and far-reaching instrument. It may not be\r\nperfect, but it is by far the most comprehensive\r\nagreement relating to the conservation and\r\nmanagement of fish stocks.\r\nNevertheless, it is to be acknowledged that until\r\nthe Agreement enjoys universal participation and\r\nStates fully comply with their obligations — in\r\nparticular those contained in article 8 of the Agreement\r\nin relation to organizations — unregulated high seas\r\nfishing, that is fishing by non-members outside the\r\nrules set by regional fisheries management\r\norganizations (RFMOs), will remain a considerable\r\nproblem. The 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks\r\nAgreement is indisputably a giant step in the direction\r\nof sustainable use of fish resources, but it cannot attain\r\nits full potential unless the most important coastal\r\nStates, fishing States and flag States are parties to it.\r\nA key strategy must be to secure broader\r\nparticipation in the Agreement. The need for that has\r\nbeen emphasized repeatedly in numerous General\r\nAssembly resolutions and in other international bodies.\r\nIn the long term, it is important that all parties to the\r\n1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\nbecome parties to the Agreement, so that, as originally\r\nintended, there would be a seamless connection\r\nbetween the provisions of the Convention and the\r\nprovisions of the Agreement. This is likely to take\r\ntime, but in the short term, it is especially important\r\nthat all high seas fishing nations and actual and\r\npotential flag States become parties to the Agreement\r\nas soon as possible so that the opportunities for “free\r\nriding” can be minimized and as many high seas actors\r\nas possible are bound by the existing web of legal\r\nobligations.\r\nSpecial efforts should be made to bring specific\r\ncountries into the Fish Stocks Agreement. These might\r\ninclude countries that are already members of two or\r\nmore regional arrangements — thus having a clear\r\nfishing interest — but are not yet parties to the\r\nAgreement, and those countries that are significant flag\r\nStates of high seas fishing vessels. It is interesting to\r\nnote that of the 14 open-registry countries that had\r\nregistered the largest number of fishing vessels\r\nbetween 1999 and 2003, 10 are not parties to the\r\nAgreement and three of those countries are not even\r\nparties to the 1982 Convention. In other words, they\r\nwillingly flag fishing vessels but are not prepared to\r\ncommit to the basic obligations of flag States that are\r\nenshrined in the Convention and accepted by the\r\noverwhelming majority of the international\r\ncommunity — 145 States Members of the United\r\nNations are parties to the Convention. Yet all of those\r\ncountries are present in the General Assembly and are\r\nlikely to participate in the adoption of the present draft\r\nresolutions.\r\nThe second key point to make is that experience\r\nhas shown that the Fish Stocks Agreement may not\r\nhave gone far enough. There are critical gaps in its\r\ncoverage which need to be dealt with. For example, it\r\nis seen as limited in application to straddling fish\r\nstocks and highly migratory fish stocks. Some consider\r\nthat it does not cover sufficiently the problem of\r\ndiscrete high seas stocks, including deep-sea fisheries.\r\nAlthough that difficulty may be more a perception than\r\na reality, it is leading to the undesirable situation in\r\nwhich piecemeal and sometimes rather radical\r\nproposals are being promoted to deal with specific\r\nproblems, such as proposals for blanket prohibitions on\r\ncertain fishing practices. Surely it would be much\r\nbetter if those problems were dealt with in accordance\r\nwith the same principles that apply to straddling and\r\nhighly migratory fish stocks, and under the same sort\r\nof comprehensive management framework that the\r\nAgreement encourages. High-seas fishing is a global\r\nphenomenon, and there needs to be a comprehensive\r\nglobal management framework rather than piecemeal\r\ngap-filling. Serious consideration should therefore be\r\ngiven to expanding the scope of application of the\r\nAgreement so as to include all fish stocks in the high\r\nseas.\r\nThe third major issue with regard to the Fish\r\nStocks Agreement is that, although it accords a key\r\nrole to regional fisheries management organizations\r\n(RFMOs), designed to lead eventually to a situation\r\nwhere high-seas fishing can be engaged in only by\r\nvessels flying the flags of States that are members of\r\nRFMOs or that cooperate with them, unfortunately,\r\nwhat we have seen is that this is not enough by itself.\r\nRegional fisheries management organizations’\r\ncoverage is incomplete; some lack capacity, and in all\r\nof them, participation is not sufficiently broad to\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.56\r\nensure compliance with conservation and management\r\nmeasures and eliminate the problem of free riders. The\r\nirresistible conclusion is that it is not enough to rely on\r\na disparate and relatively inefficient and incomplete\r\nnetwork of RFMOs to implement the Agreement. It is\r\nlikely that increased oversight at the global level can\r\nsignificantly reinforce regional and national measures\r\nto effectively implement the Agreement. That would\r\npromote a more systemic approach to improving the\r\nconformity of conservation and management measures\r\nwith the Agreement. At the very least, RFMOs can and\r\nshould be improved. Their mandate should also be\r\nexpanded to cover all fish stocks in the area of their\r\ncompetence, including those found on seamounts.\r\nThe fourth major problem is that neither the Fish\r\nStocks Agreement nor any of the RFMOs are equipped\r\nto deal with the problem of allocation of high seas\r\nresources. The high seas is one of the few remaining\r\nglobal commons, others being the atmosphere and\r\nbiosphere. Despite the increasing qualifications that\r\nhave been placed on the exercise of high seas freedoms\r\nthrough the widening and deepening of the obligations\r\nplaced upon States by the Agreement, the current\r\ninternational regime governing access to high seas\r\nresources remains the traditional rule of capture. Left\r\nunconstrained, we know that the end result of States\r\nexercising the unrestricted right to fish on the high seas\r\nis the “tragedy of the commons”.\r\nA number of international initiatives have begun\r\nto look in more detail at those problems. The Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization, for example, continues to\r\nprovide valuable technical advice and support to\r\nRFMOs and will hold a ministerial session of its\r\nCommittee on Fisheries in 2005. The Organization for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development’s Committee\r\non Fisheries is also expected shortly to produce a major\r\npiece of work on the economic incentives for illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated fishing (IUU fishing) based\r\non exhaustive analysis. We can also look forward to the\r\noutcomes of the novel initiative taken by a group of\r\nfisheries ministers from developed and developing\r\ncountries to establish a ministerial task force on high-\r\nseas fishing to try to identify practical measures that\r\nwill have a measurable impact on the problems of IUU\r\nfishing. Together, the results of those processes, if\r\napplied and implemented by States and fishing entities,\r\nshould help to show the way forward.\r\nI would like to conclude by restating that the\r\n1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\nand its related instruments provide a sound legal\r\nfoundation for ocean governance but clearly there is\r\nmuch that needs to be done by the international\r\ncommunity, individually and collectively, to meet the\r\ndemands of responsible stewardship of the oceans and\r\nits resources.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 51/204 of 17 December\r\n1996, I now call on Mr. Dolliver Nelson, President of\r\nthe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.\r\nMr. Nelson (International Tribunal for the Law of\r\nthe Sea): It is an honour for me, on behalf of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, to\r\naddress this fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly on the occasion of its annual examination of\r\nthe item “Oceans and the law of the sea”, and\r\nespecially on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of\r\nthe entry into force of the United Nations Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea. I extend to the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly my personal congratulations and\r\nthose of the Tribunal, on his election.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to report to\r\nthe General Assembly on the developments that have\r\ntaken place with respect to the Tribunal since the last\r\nmeeting of the Assembly on this agenda item, held in\r\nNovember 2003. I am particularly pleased to inform\r\nthe Assembly that the negotiations with the German\r\nauthorities on the Headquarters Agreement between the\r\nTribunal and the Federal Republic of Germany came to\r\na successful conclusion. The text of the Agreement\r\nshould be signed before the end of this year. I wish to\r\nplace on record our deep gratitude to the Federal\r\nRepublic of Germany for the excellent cooperation it\r\nhas extended to the Tribunal in this matter.\r\nIn the course of the year, the Tribunal held two\r\nsessions: the seventeenth session from 22 March to\r\n2 April 2003, and the eighteenth session from\r\n20 September to 1 October 2003. Those sessions were\r\ndevoted to legal and judicial matters, as well to\r\nadministrative and organizational issues related to the\r\ndischarge of the judicial functions of the Tribunal.\r\nWith respect to the judicial work of the Tribunal,\r\nI should like to mention that a case is still pending on\r\nthe docket, the Case concerning the Conservation and\r\nSustainable Exploitation of Swordfish Stocks in the\r\nSouth-Eastern Pacific Ocean, Chile/European\r\nCommunity, which was submitted to a Chamber of the\r\nTribunal. By order dated 16 December 2003, the time\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.56\r\nlimit for making preliminary objections with respect to\r\nthe case was extended at the request of the parties until\r\n1 January 2006 to enable them to reach an agreement.\r\nSince my last report to the General Assembly, no\r\nnew cases have been submitted to the Tribunal. I must\r\nhowever point out, that on several occasions, requests\r\nhave been addressed to the Registry for information\r\nregarding the institution of prompt release proceedings,\r\nand, on more than one occasion, cases were not\r\ninstituted because negotiations been the parties proved\r\nsuccessful.\r\nIt is certainly a function of the Tribunal to be\r\neasily available to parties, a factor which can facilitate\r\nthe negotiation process between the parties to a\r\ndispute. Thus the mere existence of the Tribunal, a\r\nstanding body, assists States to settle their maritime\r\ndisputes without resorting to litigation. The Tribunal\r\nhas dealt with 12 cases during its eight-year existence,\r\nin which it has delivered six judgements and 26 orders.\r\nThis compares favourably with the record of other\r\ninternational courts and tribunals in the initial stages of\r\ntheir existence.\r\nIt is gratifying to note that 17 States parties from\r\ndifferent regions of the world have been engaged in\r\nproceedings before the Tribunal. It should also be\r\nremarked — and this is generally agreed — that the\r\nTribunal has rendered its decisions within remarkably\r\nshort periods. The Tribunal has already made some\r\ncontribution to the development of international law,\r\nwith regard to issues such as the nationality of claims,\r\nreparation, use of force in law enforcement activities,\r\nhot pursuit and the question of the genuine link\r\nbetween the vessel and the flag State.\r\nIt can be fairly said that the Tribunal has also\r\ndeveloped a coherent jurisprudence in prompt release\r\nproceedings under article 292 of the Convention. The\r\ncases dealing with a prescription of provisional\r\nmeasures under article 290, paragraph 5, concerned\r\nprimarily the protection of the marine environment. In\r\nthose cases the Tribunal emphasized the duty to\r\ncooperate, and stressed the importance of exercising\r\nprudence and caution when undertaking activities\r\nwhich may have a harmful effect on the marine\r\nenvironment.\r\nIn a sense, these decisions can be viewed as\r\nhelping in the development of international\r\nenvironmental law. In that connection, I would like to\r\nthank the sponsors of draft resolution A/59/L.22 for\r\nnoting the continued and significant contribution of the\r\nTribunal to the peaceful settlement of disputes, in\r\naccordance with Part XV of the Convention, and for\r\nunderlining the important role and authority of the\r\nTribunal concerning the application of the Convention\r\nand the agreement relating to the implementation of\r\nPart XI of the Convention.\r\nMay I recall that out of 145 States parties to the\r\nConvention, only 34 have made written declarations\r\nrelating to the settlement of disputes under article 287\r\nof the Convention, and that 21 States parties have\r\nchosen the Tribunal as the means, or one of the means,\r\nfor the settlement of disputes concerning the\r\ninterpretation or application of the Convention. It is to\r\nbe hoped that an increasing number of States will\r\nutilize the possibility, offered by article 287 of the\r\nConvention, of choosing means for the settlement of\r\ndisputes concerning the Convention, as is stated in\r\ndraft resolution A/59/L.23. States may also confer\r\njurisdiction on the Tribunal through international\r\nagreements. Seven such multilateral agreements have\r\nalready been concluded.\r\nIt should be noted here that even in the absence\r\nof any declaration under article 287 of the Convention,\r\nStates are obliged to submit their disputes to a\r\nprocedure entailing binding decisions. By virtue of that\r\nprovision, States which have not made any declaration\r\nare deemed to have accepted arbitration, and\r\narbitration would then be the only procedure binding\r\nupon the parties, unless they agree otherwise.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to draw attention to\r\nthe possibility for parties to submit their disputes to a\r\nspecial chamber of the Tribunal in accordance with\r\narticle 15, paragraph 2, of the Tribunal’s Statute. Such\r\na special chamber is an alternative to arbitration and\r\nshould be of particular interest to possible users, for\r\nvarious reasons. The composition of a special chamber\r\nshall be determined by the Tribunal with the approval\r\nof the parties. This gives the parties a measure of\r\ncontrol over its composition. The parties to a dispute\r\ndo not have to bear the expenses of the proceedings\r\nbefore the Tribunal. For example, there are no\r\nexpenses for remuneration of the members of the\r\nchamber, including travel; there are no administrative\r\ncharges; there are no expenses for interpretation. The\r\nparties have at their disposal the rules of the Tribunal,\r\nwhich can be applied in a flexible manner. For\r\ninstance, the parties may propose certain modifications\r\nor additions to the rules. They may agree on the time\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.56\r\nlimits for the filing of pleadings or the number of\r\npleadings or the holding of oral proceedings. It should\r\nbe noted, however, that the institution of international\r\nlegal proceedings involves expenses for the States\r\nconcerned. It is true that, unlike what was said above\r\nwith respect to arbitral proceedings, the parties to a\r\ndispute before the Tribunal do not have to share the\r\nfinancial burden relating to the functioning of the\r\nTribunal, since expenses incurred by the Tribunal in\r\ndealing with cases submitted to it are financed by\r\nStates parties.\r\nNevertheless, parties need to cover expenses for\r\ncounsel and advocates representing them, as well as for\r\naccommodation in Hamburg. These costs may be\r\nburdensome for States — in particular developing\r\nStates — whenever they are contemplating submitting\r\na case to the Tribunal. In that respect, I wish to draw\r\nattention to resolution 55/7, entitled “Oceans and the\r\nlaw of the sea”, of 30 October 2000, whereby the\r\nGeneral Assembly requested the Secretary-General to\r\nestablish a voluntary Trust Fund to assist developing\r\nstates in the settlement of disputes through the\r\nTribunal. Two States have so far made contributions to\r\nthe Fund. Currently the Fund amounts to $55,000. It is\r\nhoped that most States will consider making\r\ncontributions to this Fund.\r\nI am pleased to report that, on 1 September 2004,\r\nMr. Horst Köhler, President of the Federal Republic of\r\nGermany, accompanied by 140 members of the\r\ndiplomatic corps, was received at the Tribunal. On that\r\noccasion I made a statement on the work of the\r\nTribunal, which can be found on the Tribunal web site\r\n(www.itlos.org).\r\nI am also glad to report to the General Assembly\r\nthat, in commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the\r\nentry into force of the Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea, a symposium on maritime delimitation took place\r\non the premises of the Tribunal on 25 and\r\n26 September 2004. The event was organized jointly\r\nby the International Foundation for the Law of the Sea,\r\nthe Association internationale du droit de la mer, the\r\nInstitut du droit économique de la mer of Monaco, the\r\nLaw of the Sea and Maritime Law Institute of the\r\nUniversity of Hamburg, the Federal Maritime and\r\nHydrographical Agency and the Bucerius Law School\r\nof Hamburg. More than 150 participants, including a\r\nlarge number of representatives of States, attended the\r\nevent. The symposium demonstrated the importance of\r\nmaritime delimitation issues. Clearly these questions\r\ncontinue to attract the interest of practitioners, experts\r\nand Government officials. As far as the Tribunal is\r\nconcerned, it is ready, and possesses the necessary\r\nexpertise, to deal with cases relating to maritime\r\ndelimitation.\r\nI should also like to mention that the Tribunal has\r\ntaken further steps to develop its relationship with\r\nother international organizations and bodies. During\r\nthe current year, the Tribunal has concluded\r\nadministrative arrangements with the International\r\nLabour Office and the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Organization.\r\nSince I spoke to the Assembly in November last\r\nyear, one State has acceded to the Agreement on the\r\nPrivileges and Immunities of the Tribunal. The\r\nAgreement entered into force on 30 December 2001,\r\nand to date only 14 States have expressed their consent\r\nto be bound by it. In this regard, I would like to refer to\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 58/240 of 23 December\r\n2003, in which the Assembly called upon States that\r\nhave not done so to consider ratifying or acceding to\r\nthe Agreement. The Registrar sent notes verbales to\r\nStates parties in June 2004 making reference to the\r\nrecommendation of the General Assembly. That\r\nrecommendation has also been included in the draft\r\nresolution this year.\r\nAs of 1 November 2004, there was an unpaid\r\nbalance of assessed contributions to the overall budget\r\nof the Tribunal of $2,569,684 for the budgets covering\r\nthe period from 1996-1997 to 2004. The Tribunal is\r\naware of the difficulties this situation may raise with\r\nrespect to its functioning. The Registrar will send notes\r\nverbales to the States parties concerned in December\r\n2004, reminding them of their outstanding\r\ncontributions to the budgets of the Tribunal. We are\r\nthankful to the sponsors of the draft resolution for\r\nincorporating an appeal to States parties in this matter.\r\nI wish to refer to the internship programme of the\r\nTribunal and the grant provided by the Korea\r\nInternational Cooperation Agency (KOICA) for\r\nfunding the participation of candidates from\r\ndeveloping countries in the programme. It gives me\r\npleasure to inform the Assembly that, since the grant\r\nwas put in place earlier this year, 11 interns from 11\r\ncountries have benefited from the KOICA grant. On\r\nbehalf of the Tribunal, I wish to convey our gratitude\r\nto the Korea International Cooperation Agency for this\r\ngenerous contribution.\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.56\r\nI take this opportunity to state that the Tribunal\r\ncontinues to seek the moral and material support of the\r\ninternational community. In conclusion, I would like to\r\nexpress my appreciation to the Assembly President and\r\nto delegations for having provided me with the\r\nopportunity to address this meeting. I would also like\r\nto thank the Secretary-General, the Legal Counsel and\r\nthe Director of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the\r\nLaw of the Sea for their support. I wish the General\r\nAssembly every success in its important deliberations\r\nat this session.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 49, sub-items (a)\r\nand (b).\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution\r\nA/59/L.22 and draft resolution A/59/L.23, as orally\r\ncorrected.\r\nBefore giving the floor to representatives who\r\nwish to speak in explanation of vote or position before\r\naction is taken on the draft resolutions, may I remind\r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10\r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Erciyes (Turkey): With regard to the two\r\ndraft resolutions before us under agenda item 49,\r\nTurkey will vote against the draft resolution contained\r\nin document A/59/L.22, entitled “Oceans and the law\r\nof the sea”. The reason for my delegation’s negative\r\nvote is that some of the elements contained in the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,\r\nwhich has prevented Turkey from approving the\r\nConvention, are once again retained in this year’s draft\r\nresolution. Turkey supports international efforts to\r\nestablish a regime of the sea which is based on the\r\nprinciple of equity and which can be acceptable to all\r\nStates. However, in our opinion, the Convention does\r\nnot make adequate provision for special geographical\r\nsituations and, as a consequence, is not able to\r\nestablish an acceptable balance between conflicting\r\ninterests. Furthermore, the Convention makes no\r\nprovision for registering reservations on specific\r\nclauses.\r\nAlthough Turkey agrees with the Convention\r\nwith regard to its general intent, and with most of its\r\nprovisions, it is unable to become a party to it because\r\nof those serious shortcomings. That being the case,\r\nTurkey cannot support the draft resolution, which also\r\ncalls on States to become parties to the Convention and\r\nto harmonize their national legislation with its\r\nprovisions.\r\nAs for the draft resolution on sustainable\r\nfisheries, contained in document A/59/L.23, as orally\r\ncorrected, my delegation would like to state that\r\nTurkey is fully committed to the conservation,\r\nmanagement and sustainable use of marine living\r\nresources, and attaches great importance to regional\r\ncooperation to that end. In that context, Turkey\r\nsupports the draft resolution. However, my delegation\r\nwishes to reaffirm once again our position vis-à-vis the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. For\r\nthe reasons that I have just set out, Turkey is not able\r\nto give its consent to certain references to the\r\nConvention made in that draft resolution, in particular\r\noperative paragraph 2, in which States are called upon\r\nto become parties to the Convention. In this respect,\r\nTurkey dissociates itself from the consensus on those\r\nparticular references.\r\nMs. Núñez de Odremán (Venezuela) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): My delegation would like to refer to draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.22, under agenda item 49, entitled\r\n“Oceans and the law of the sea”, which is before the\r\nAssembly for consideration and on which a vote will\r\nshortly be taken.\r\nThe delegation of Venezuela wishes once again to\r\nunderscore its commitment to cooperate with efforts\r\ndesigned to promote coordination on issues relating to\r\noceans in the framework of the negotiations recently\r\nconcluded, which resulted in the text that will be\r\nshortly presented in this Hall.\r\nIn that regard, we note that the reasons that have\r\nprevented Venezuela from becoming a party to the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\nremain valid. For that reason, my delegation is not in a\r\nposition to join States in supporting this draft\r\nresolution, since the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\r\nis not a party to the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea of 10 December 1982, and the norms of\r\nthat Convention do not apply to it under international\r\ncustomary law — except those that the Bolivarian\r\nRepublic of Venezuela may have explicitly recognized,\r\nor may recognize in future, by incorporating them into\r\nits domestic legislation.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, my delegation wishes to\r\nreaffirm its historical position vis-à-vis the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Certain\r\naspects of the document submitted today by the\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.56\r\npresidency compel my delegation to abstain in the\r\nvoting that is to take place shortly.\r\nMy delegation wishes also to refer to the draft\r\nresolution submitted in this Hall as document\r\nA/59/L.23 under agenda item 49 (b), entitled\r\n“Sustainable fisheries, including through the\r\nAgreement for the implementation of the Provisions of\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\nof 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and\r\nManagement of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks, and related instruments”, which\r\nis before us for consideration.\r\nIn that regard, the delegation of Venezuela wishes\r\nto underscore its commitment to cooperate with efforts\r\naimed at promoting coordination on issues relating to\r\nthe question of sustainable fisheries in the context of\r\nthe negotiations that have recently concluded and\r\nwhich resulted in the text submitted in this Hall.\r\nIt is important to note that, at the national level,\r\nVenezuela is taking significant steps forward in the\r\narea of the conservation and management of marine\r\nbiological resources and in measures to control the\r\noperations of domestic-flagged vessels.\r\nMy country has also undertaken cooperative\r\nefforts, in the context of regional fisheries management\r\norganizations, relating to effective conservation\r\nmeasures to maintain the long-term sustainability of\r\nstraddling and highly migratory fish stocks. The results\r\nof the cooperation that is taking place in those forums\r\nhave been reflected in the adoption of regulatory\r\nresolutions and recommendations covering such stocks.\r\nIn that regard, Venezuela has taken part in\r\ninternational fisheries management commissions such\r\nas the International Commission for the Conservation\r\nof Atlantic Tunas, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna\r\nCommission and the negotiations of the Inter-American\r\nConvention on the Protection and Conservation of Sea\r\nTurtles, of which it is the depositary.\r\nLikewise, our country from the very outset took\r\npart in the negotiations on the Convention for the\r\nProtection and Development of the Marine\r\nEnvironment of the Wider Caribbean Region and its\r\nProtocol concerning Protected Areas and Wildlife, as\r\nwell as the Convention on Biological Diversity, which\r\nwe consider to be a framework instrument for the\r\nregulation of conservation and use of biological\r\ndiversity in all spheres.\r\nVenezuela has provided support to small island\r\ndeveloping States in the context of the Western Central\r\nAtlantic Fishery Commission, through cooperation and\r\ninstitutional support for the initiatives taken by those\r\ncountries to develop their fishery administrations. It\r\nhas also taken part in the formation of working groups\r\ndesigned to study the most important fisheries of the\r\nregion and in the setting up of a statistical database, at\r\nthe regional level, to facilitate the elaboration of\r\nregional management measures, with the goal being the\r\neconomic development of those States.\r\nFor its part, the Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela, through its Fisheries and Aquaculture Act,\r\nwhich entered into force in November 2001,\r\nspecifically appealed to domestic-flagged vessels to\r\ncomply with international measures for the\r\nconservation and management of living resources, as\r\nspecified in article 65 of the Act. That task is expressly\r\nentrusted to the National Fisheries Institute under the\r\nlaw.\r\nAt the national level, we monitor the operations\r\nof domestic-flagged fishing vessels trawling on the\r\nhigh seas through regular reporting to management\r\ncommissions set up under the aforementioned Act.\r\nOngoing communication with those agencies has made\r\nit possible to identify the exact areas of operation of\r\nnational vessels and the extent of their compliance with\r\nestablished provisions for resource management.\r\nFor its part, Venezuela also has taken measures to\r\ndeal with the problems arising from illegal, unreported\r\nand unregulated fishing through periodic reports to\r\ncommissions on domestic-flagged vessels operating\r\nlawfully in international waters or in the jurisdictional\r\nwaters of other States.\r\nThe Fisheries and Aquaculture Act provides for\r\nthe installation of positioning devices on fishing\r\nvessels larger than 30 units of gross tonnage, as well as\r\nthe use of properly authorized onboard observers, in\r\norder to compile the necessary information on fishing\r\nactivities, in keeping with the Act. That legal\r\ninstrument also includes sanctions to be applied in case\r\nof non-compliance by Venezuelan fishing vessels with\r\nconservation and management measures.\r\nAs regards fishing capacity, the Government of\r\nVenezuela has underscored in various forums its\r\nreadiness to maintain its holding capacity at current\r\nlevels. It has also urged other Member States and\r\ncooperating countries in the aforementioned\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.56\r\norganizations to find points of consensus that will\r\nmake it possible to work to effectively limit fleet\r\ncapacity, in keeping with what was agreed in the\r\nUnited Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s\r\nInternational Plan of Action for the Management of\r\nFishing Capacity, in order to ensure the conservation of\r\nfishing resources and the sustainable long-term\r\ndevelopment of fisheries.\r\nWith regard to conservation measures to protect\r\necosystems and the environment, including straddling\r\nand highly migratory stocks, I would note that the\r\nagreements to which Venezuela is a party contain\r\nprovisions on the efforts that countries should make to\r\nmaintain the sustainability of the marine environment,\r\nin harmony with the species inhabiting it. With that in\r\nmind, the country welcomes such decisions and is\r\nworking, in the context of its legal framework, to\r\nprotect the aquatic marine environment and its living\r\nresources.\r\nWe also consider a top priority the preservation\r\nof ecosystems, so that their natural productivity and\r\nstability are not recklessly disrupted, ensuring that they\r\ncan be used in a way that will ensure sustainable\r\nfishing.\r\nIn that regard, we wish to state that the reasons\r\nstill exist that have prevented Venezuela from\r\nbecoming a party to the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea, including the Agreement for the\r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December\r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of\r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish\r\nStocks still exist.\r\nFor that reason, my delegation is not in a position\r\nto join with States supporting the content of the draft\r\nresolution, since the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\r\nis not a party to the Agreement for the Implementation\r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation\r\nand Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks. Nor are the provisions of that\r\nAgreement applicable to Venezuela under international\r\ncustomary law, except those that the Bolivarian\r\nRepublic of Venezuela has explicitly recognized, or\r\nmay recognize in future, by incorporating this\r\nprovisions in its domestic legislation.\r\nHaving stated this, my delegation wishes to\r\nreaffirm the fact that it will not block consensus on the\r\ndraft resolution before the Assembly. However, it\r\nwould reaffirm its historical position vis-à-vis the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and\r\nits related agreements, since we take the view that\r\ncertain aspects of the draft resolution compel my\r\ndelegation to note an explicit reservation regarding that\r\ndocument.\r\nMr. Llanos (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation wishes to make a statement concerning the\r\ncontent of operative paragraph 66 of the draft\r\nresolution on sustainable fisheries, contained in\r\ndocument A/59/L.23, on which action will be taken\r\nshortly.\r\nChile joins the consensus on the understanding\r\nthat, in keeping with the rights of sovereignty and\r\njurisdiction established by the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea for coastal States in\r\ntheir economic exclusive zones, it is incumbent on\r\nthose States, in keeping with their circumstances, to\r\nconsider conservation and sustainable management\r\nmeasures, in accordance with that Convention and\r\ninternational law.\r\nMs. Zanelli (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Peru\r\nwishes to make a statement in connection with\r\noperative paragraph 66 of the draft resolution\r\ncontained in document A/59/L.23. Peru joins the\r\nconsensus on this draft resolution on the understanding\r\nthat, in conformity with the rights of sovereignty and\r\njurisdiction that international law recognizes for\r\ncoastal States, it is up to those States to consider the\r\nrelated conservation and sustainable management\r\nmeasures in accordance with international law.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in explanation of vote before the vote. The\r\nAssembly will now take a decision on draft resolution\r\nA/59/L.22 and draft resolution A/59/L.23, as orally\r\ncorrected.\r\nWe turn first to draft resolution A/59/L.22,\r\nentitled “Oceans and the law of the sea”.\r\nI give the floor to the representative of the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Chief, General Assembly Affairs\r\nBranch): I would like to inform members that under the\r\nterms of operative paragraphs 6, 17, 29, 32, 73, 74, 86\r\nand 90 of draft resolution A/59/L.22, the General\r\nAssembly would: request the Secretary-General to\r\nimprove the existing Geographic Information System\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.56\r\nand to give due publicity to it; request the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to convene the fifteenth Meeting of States\r\nParties to the Convention in New York from 16 to\r\n24 June 2005 and to provide the services required;\r\napprove the convening by the Secretary-General of the\r\nfifteenth session of the Commission in New York from\r\n4 to 22 April 2005, and of the sixteenth session of the\r\nCommission from 29 August to 16 September 2005, on\r\nthe understanding that the second and third weeks of\r\neach session will be used by the Commission for\r\ntechnically related matters; request the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in cooperation with States and relevant\r\ninternational organization and institutions, to consider\r\ndeveloping and making available training courses;\r\ndecide to establish an Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal\r\nWorking Group to study issues relating to the\r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological\r\ndiversity and request the Secretary-General to report on\r\nthose issues in the context of his report on oceans and\r\nthe law of the sea to the sixtieth session of the General\r\nAssembly; request the Secretary-General to convene\r\nthe second International Workshop on the regular\r\nprocess for global reporting and assessment of the state\r\nof the marine environment, including socio-economic\r\naspects from 13 to 15 June 2005; and to convene the\r\nsixth meeting of the Consultative Process in New York\r\nfrom 6 to 10 June 2005.\r\nAs concerns the conference-servicing\r\nrequirements for the anticipated meetings referred to in\r\nparagraphs 17, 29, 86 and 90, it should be noted that\r\nthe sessions have already been programmed in the\r\nrevised draft calendar of conferences and meetings for\r\n2005. Hence, no additional appropriation would be\r\nrequired.\r\nWith regard to the second International\r\nWorkshop, it is understood that the Meeting of States\r\nParties will be shortened by three days. Accordingly,\r\nthe second International Workshop will meet during the\r\nfirst three days of the dates originally allocated to and\r\napproved for the fifteenth Meeting of States Parties,\r\n13 to 24 June 2005. Therefore, there would be no\r\nadditional conference servicing implications for\r\nholding the second International Workshop from 13 to\r\n15 June 2005, provided that the total documentation\r\nand interpretation workload of both the Workshop and\r\nthe Meeting of States Parties does not exceed the total\r\noriginally allocated to and approved for the Meeting of\r\nStates Parties.\r\nAs concerns paragraphs 6, 32, 73 and 74, the\r\nrequired substantive servicing is already included in\r\nthe programme of work of subprogramme 4, “Law of\r\nthe sea and ocean affairs”. Accordingly, should the\r\nGeneral Assembly adopt draft resolution A/59/L.22, no\r\nadditional requirements would arise for the programme\r\nbudget for the biennium 2004-2005.\r\nThe Acting President: Before proceeding to take\r\naction on the draft resolution, I should like to announce\r\nthat since the introduction of the draft resolution, the\r\nfollowing countries have become sponsors of\r\nA/59/L.22: Australia, Belize, Cameroon, Croatia,\r\nGermany, Indonesia, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Papua New\r\nGuinea, Poland, the Russian Federation, Saint Lucia,\r\nSamoa, Sierra Leone and Ukraine.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAlgeria, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda,\r\nArgentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahamas,\r\nBahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Belize, Bolivia,\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil,\r\nBrunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Canada,\r\nChile, China, Congo, Costa Rica, Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nCroatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic,\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark,\r\nDjibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt,\r\nEl Salvador, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France,\r\nGabon, Gambia, Georgia, Germany, Ghana,\r\nGreece, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau,\r\nGuyana, Honduras, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran\r\n(Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Italy,\r\nJamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya,\r\nKuwait, Lao People’s Democratic Republic,\r\nLatvia, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Liechtenstein,\r\nLithuania, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives,\r\nMali, Malta, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Mexico,\r\nMicronesia (Federated States of), Monaco,\r\nMongolia, Morocco, Myanmar, Namibia, Nauru,\r\nNepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua,\r\nNigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Palau, Panama,\r\nParaguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal,\r\nQatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of Moldova,\r\nRomania, Russian Federation, Samoa, San\r\nMarino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, Seychelles, Sierra Leone,\r\nSingapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands,\r\nSouth Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname,\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.56\r\nSweden, Switzerland, Thailand, the former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-Leste,\r\nTogo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia,\r\nTuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates,\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern\r\nIreland, United Republic of Tanzania, United\r\nStates of America, Uruguay, Viet Nam, Yemen,\r\nZambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst:\r\nTurkey\r\nAbstaining:\r\nColombia, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)\r\nDraft resolution A/59/L.22 was adopted by 141\r\nvotes to 1, with 2 abstentions (resolution 59/24).\r\nThe Acting President: We turn next to draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.23, entitled “Sustainable fisheries,\r\nincluding through the 1995 Agreement for the\r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December\r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of\r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish\r\nStocks, and related instruments”, as orally corrected.\r\nI give the floor to the representative of the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Chief, General Assembly Affairs\r\nBranch): I would like to inform members that under the\r\nterms of operative paragraphs 16 and 18 of draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.23, the General Assembly would:\r\nrequest the Secretary-General to convene, pursuant to\r\narticle 36 of the Agreement, in the first part of 2006 a\r\none-week review conference, with a view to assessing\r\nthe effectiveness of the Agreement in securing the\r\nconservation and management of straddling fish stocks\r\nand highly migratory fish stocks, and to render the\r\nnecessary assistance and to provide such services as\r\nmay be required for the review conference; and recall\r\nparagraph 6 of its resolution 56/13, and request the\r\nSecretary-General to convene a fourth round of\r\ninformal consultations of States parties to the\r\nAgreement, to consider, principally, but not limited to,\r\nissues related to the preparation for the review\r\nconference to be convened by the Secretary-General,\r\npursuant to article 36 of the Agreement and making\r\nany appropriate recommendation to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nPursuant to those requests, it is envisaged that\r\nthere would be a total of 19 meetings for one week in\r\nthe first half of 2006 in New York, with interpretation\r\nin all six languages. Documentation requirements\r\nwould be 200 pages of pre-session, 100 pages of in-\r\nsession and 100 pages of post-session documents, to be\r\nissued in all six languages.\r\nThe exact dates of the meetings will be\r\ndetermined in consultation between the substantive\r\nsecretariat and the Department for General Assembly\r\nand Conference Management, subject to the\r\navailability of conference facilities and services\r\nallocated for the General Assembly and its working\r\ngroups, and on the condition that no two working\r\ngroups of the General Assembly would meet\r\nsimultaneously.\r\nThe conference-servicing requirements for the\r\nanticipated four-day review conference in 2006 are\r\nestimated — at full cost and using 2004-2005 rates —\r\nat $470,600. The extent to which the Organization’s\r\ncapacity would need to be supplemented by temporary\r\nassistance resources can be determined only in the light\r\nof the calendar of conferences and meetings for the\r\nbiennium 2006-2007. Provision for such requirements\r\nwould be considered under the relevant section for\r\nconference services of the proposed programme budget\r\nfor the biennium 2006-2007, not only for meetings\r\nprogrammed at the time of budget preparation, but also\r\nfor meetings authorized subsequently, provided that the\r\nnumber and distribution of meetings are consistent\r\nwith the pattern of meetings of past years.\r\nAs concerns operative paragraph 18, the\r\nsubstantive servicing associated with the convening of\r\na fourth round of informal consultations is already\r\nincluded in the programme of work of subprogramme\r\n4, Law of the sea and ocean affairs.\r\nAccordingly, should the General Assembly adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/59/L.23, no additional requirements\r\nwould arise for the programme budget for the biennium\r\n2004-2005.\r\nThe Acting President: Before we proceed to take\r\naction on draft resolution A/59/L.23, I should like to\r\nannounce that, since its introduction, the following\r\ncountries have joined the list of sponsors: Cameroon,\r\nNauru, Nicaragua, Papua New Guinea, Saint Lucia,\r\nSamoa and Sierra Leone.\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.56\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/59/L.23, as orally corrected?\r\nResolution A/59/L.23, as orally corrected, was\r\nadopted (resolution 59/25).\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the floor to\r\nthose representatives who wish to speak in explanation\r\nof vote or position on the resolutions just adopted, may\r\nI remind delegations that explanations of vote are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Nesi (Italy): Italy voted in favour of draft\r\nresolution A/59/L.22, under agenda item 49 (a),\r\nentitled “Oceans and the law of the sea”, although this\r\nyear it did not sponsor the draft resolution. In this\r\nregard, Italy would like to underline its concerns with\r\nregard to paragraph 7 of the resolution. First, Italy\r\nbelieves that reference should be made to the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea — the\r\nMontego Bay Convention — in general, since article\r\n149, in addition to article 303, refers to the protection\r\nof the underwater cultural heritage.\r\nMoreover, Italy also believes that mention should\r\nhave been made of the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)\r\nConvention on the Protection of the Underwater\r\nCultural Heritage. The UNESCO Convention was\r\nnegotiated and adopted to clarify and strengthen the\r\ncontents of the relevant United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea provisions and to provide a specific\r\nand better regime for the protection of the underwater\r\ncultural heritage. The UNESCO Convention deserves\r\nto be mentioned in the resolution.\r\nMr. Dolatyar (Islamic Republic of Iran): My\r\ndelegation voted in favour of draft resolution\r\nA/59/L.22. However, I would like to make it clear that\r\nmy delegation dissociates itself from the seventeenth\r\npreambular paragraph of the resolution, which takes\r\nnote of the report of the Secretary-General entitled\r\n“Oceans and the law of the sea” contained in document\r\nA/59/62. Paragraph 28 of that report refers to news\r\nreports that in our view fail to accurately reflect the\r\nsituation in the Persian Gulf as regards the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran. We request the Secretariat to rectify\r\nthat shortcoming when preparing the next report on the\r\nsubject.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in explanation of vote. May I take it that it is\r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 49 and its sub-items (a)\r\nand (b)?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at noon.\r\n"
