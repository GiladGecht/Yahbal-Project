(Gabon)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Effah-Apenteng\r\n(Ghana), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 18\r\nElection of judges of the International Tribunal for\r\nthe Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious\r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia\r\nsince 1991\r\nLetter from the President of the Security\r\nCouncil (A/59/437)\r\nMemorandum by the Secretary-General\r\n(A/59/438)\r\nCurricula vitae (A/59/439)\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly\r\nwill proceed to the election of 14 permanent judges of\r\nthe International Tribunal for the Prosecution of\r\nPersons Responsible for Serious Violations of\r\nInternational Humanitarian Law Committed in the\r\nTerritory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 for a\r\nfour-year term of office commencing on 17 November\r\n2005.\r\nAt the election of judges in 2001, 14 permanent\r\njudges were elected for a term of four years that will\r\nexpire on 16 November 2005.\r\nIn connection with the election today of the 14\r\npermanent judges, I should like to bring the following\r\nmatters to the attention of the General Assembly.\r\nFirst, according to article 13 bis, paragraph 1, of\r\nthe statute of the International Tribunal as amended by\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1166 (1998) of 13 May\r\n1998 and 1329 (2000) of 30 November 2000, the 14\r\npermanent judges of the International Tribunal shall be\r\nelected by the General Assembly from a list of\r\ncandidates submitted by the Security Council.\r\nAt its 5057th meeting, on 14 October 2004, the\r\nSecurity Council, in accordance with article 13 bis,\r\nsubparagraph 1 (c) of the statute of the International\r\nTribunal, established in resolution 1567 (2004) a list of\r\n22 candidates, taking due account of the adequate\r\nrepresentation of the principal legal systems of the\r\nworld. The list was formally conveyed to the President\r\nof the General Assembly by a letter dated 14 October\r\n2004 from the President of the Security Council. The\r\nletter was issued as document A/59/437.\r\nSecondly, in accordance with article 13 bis,\r\nsubparagraph 1 (d) of the statute of the International\r\nTribunal, the Holy See, a non-Member State\r\nmaintaining a permanent observer mission at United\r\nNations Headquarters, shall participate in the election\r\nin the same manner as the States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations. On this occasion, I am happy to\r\nwelcome here the representative of the Holy See.\r\nFinally, I should like to draw the attention of the\r\nAssembly to the documents relating to the election.\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.57\r\nThe memorandum by the Secretary-General concerning\r\nthe election of judges of the International Tribunal is\r\ncontained in document A/59/438. The list of 22\r\ncandidates can be found in paragraph 7 of the same\r\ndocument.\r\nThe curricula vitae of the 22 candidates are\r\ncontained in document A/59/439. In that connection,\r\nmay I bring to the Assembly’s attention the provision\r\nof article 13 of the statute of the International Tribunal,\r\nwhich reads as follows:\r\n“The permanent and ad litem judges shall\r\nbe persons of high moral character, impartiality\r\nand integrity who possess the qualifications\r\nrequired in their respective countries for\r\nappointment to the highest judicial offices. In the\r\noverall composition of the Chambers and sections\r\nof the Trial Chambers, due account shall be taken\r\nof the experience of the judges in criminal law,\r\ninternational law, including international\r\nhumanitarian law and human rights law.”\r\nAs representatives are aware, the election of\r\njudges will take place in accordance with the relevant\r\nprovisions of article 13 bis of the statute of the\r\nInternational Tribunal.\r\nIn addition, given the similar nature of the election\r\nof judges of the International Court of Justice and the\r\nelection of judges of the International Tribunal, it was\r\ndecided at the time of the elections of judges in 1993,\r\nas well as in 1997, 1998 and 2001, to follow similar\r\nelection procedures in the General Assembly. In his\r\nmemorandum, the Secretary-General suggests that\r\nthose precedents be applied to the election of judges of\r\nthe International Tribunal.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly agrees to that\r\nsuggestion?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with article\r\n13 bis, subparagraph 1 (d) of the statute of the\r\nInternational Tribunal, the candidates who receive an\r\nabsolute majority of the votes of States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations and of the non-member State shall be\r\ndeclared elected. The consistent practice of the United\r\nNations has been to interpret the words “absolute\r\nmajority” as meaning a majority of all electors,\r\nwhether or not they vote or are allowed to vote. The\r\nelectors, for that purpose, are all 191 Member States\r\nand one non-member State, the Holy See. Accordingly,\r\n97 votes constitute an absolute majority for the purpose\r\nof electing judges of the International Tribunal.\r\nIf, in the first ballot, the number of candidates\r\nobtaining an absolute majority is less than 14, a second\r\nballot will be held and balloting will continue in the\r\nsame meeting until 14 candidates have obtained an\r\nabsolute majority.\r\nFollowing the practice in the election of judges of\r\nthe International Court of Justice, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral suggests in his memorandum that any second\r\nand subsequent balloting shall be unrestricted. It is\r\nfurther suggested that, following the practice in the\r\nelection of the judges of the International Court of\r\nJustice, if more than 14 candidates obtain an absolute\r\nmajority of votes in the first ballot, a second ballot will\r\nbe held on all candidates and balloting will continue at\r\nthe same meeting until 14 candidates, and no more,\r\nhave obtained an absolute majority.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly agrees to the\r\nprocedures I have just outlined?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nObserver of the Holy See.\r\nArchbishop Migliore (Holy See): The Holy See\r\nhas followed carefully the activities of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, since the\r\nTribunal is a juridical instrument of the international\r\ncommunity and an expression of its condemnation of\r\nviolations of international humanitarian law. In\r\nconsideration of its specific nature and objectives, the\r\nHoly See, although invited to participate in the voting\r\nprocess, has decided, as on previous occasions, to\r\nabstain from voting today on the candidates for the\r\noffice of judge of the International Criminal Tribunal\r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia.\r\nAt the same time, my delegation takes this\r\nopportunity to state its confidence in those selected by\r\nthis process and wish them well in their mission to\r\napply the law dispassionately, thus promoting justice,\r\nreconciliation and peace among the peoples who\r\ncomprise the former Yugoslavia.\r\nThe Acting President: Before we begin the\r\nvoting process, I should like to remind Members that,\r\npursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, no representative shall interrupt the\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.57\r\nvoting except on a point of order on the actual conduct\r\nof the voting.\r\nI should like to seek the usual cooperation of\r\nrepresentatives during the time of the conduct of the\r\nelection. Please be reminded that, during the voting\r\nprocess, all campaigning should cease in the General\r\nAssembly Hall. This means in particular that, once the\r\nmeeting has begun, no more campaign material can be\r\ndistributed inside the Hall. All representatives are also\r\nrequested to remain at their seats so that the voting\r\nprocess can proceed in an orderly manner. I thank them\r\nfor their cooperation.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot\r\npapers will now be distributed.\r\nI request representatives to use only those ballot\r\npapers that have been distributed. Only those\r\ncandidates whose names appear on the ballot papers\r\nare eligible for election. Representatives will indicate\r\nthe 14 candidates for whom they wish to vote by\r\nplacing crosses at the left of their names on the ballot\r\npapers. Ballot papers on which more than 14 names are\r\nmarked will be considered invalid. Votes may be cast\r\nonly for those whose names appear on the ballot\r\npapers.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Augustine\r\n(India), Ms. Barbosa (Mexico), Ms. Szmidt\r\n(Poland), Ms. Direito (Portugal) and Ms. Katungye\r\n(Uganda) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.35 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 12 noon.\r\nThe Acting President: The result of the voting is\r\nas follows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 190\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 190\r\nAbstentions: 2\r\nNumber of Members voting: 188\r\nRequired absolute majority: 97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nWolfgang Schomburg (Germany) 157\r\nFausto Pocar (Italy) 155\r\nLiu Daqun (China) 151\r\nChristine Van den Wyngaert (Belgium) 151\r\nTheodor Meron (United States) 148\r\nPatrick Lipton Robinson (Jamaica) 146\r\nIain Bonomy (United Kingdom) 144\r\nMohamed Shahabuddeen (Guyana) 140\r\nO-gon Kwon (Republic of Korea) 139\r\nCarmel Agius (Malta) 138\r\nKevin Horace Parker (Australia) 136\r\nJean-Claude Antonetti (France) 135\r\nAlphonsus Martinus Maria\r\n   Orie (Netherlands) 131\r\nVolodymyr Vassylenko (Ukraine) 121\r\nBakone Melema Moloto (South Africa) 115\r\nMohamed Amin El-Abbassi\r\n   El Mahdi (Egypt) 110\r\nVonimbolana Rasoazanany (Madagascar) 98\r\nPrisca Matimba Nyambe (Zambia) 81\r\nSharada Prasad Prandit (Nepal) 44\r\nElhagi Abdulkader Emberesh (Libyan\r\n   Arab Jamahiriya) 40\r\nYenyi Olungu (Democratic Republic\r\n   of the Congo) 32\r\nRigoberto Espinal Irias (Honduras) 31\r\nThe Acting President: In the ballot just\r\ncompleted, more than the required number of\r\ncandidates — in this case, 17 candidates — have\r\nobtained an absolute majority.\r\nIn accordance with the decision taken earlier, the\r\nAssembly will proceed to another unrestricted ballot to\r\nfill the 14 vacancies.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like\r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the\r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no\r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a\r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot\r\npapers will now be distributed.\r\nI request representatives to use only those ballot\r\npapers that have been distributed. Only those\r\ncandidates whose names appear on the ballot papers are\r\neligible for election. Representatives will indicate the 14\r\ncandidates for whom they wish to vote by placing\r\ncrosses at the left of their names on the ballot papers.\r\nBallot papers on which more than 14 names are marked\r\nwill be considered invalid. Votes may be cast only for\r\nthose whose names appear on the ballot papers.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Augustine\r\n(India), Ms. Barbosa (Mexico), Ms. Szmidt\r\n(Poland), Ms. Direito (Portugal) and Ms.\r\nKatungye (Uganda) acted as tellers.\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.57\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 12.20 p.m. and\r\nresumed at 1.15 p.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The result of the voting is\r\nas follows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 188\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 188\r\nAbstentions: 2\r\nNumber of Members voting: 186\r\nRequired absolute majority: 97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nWolfgang Schomburg (Germany) 159\r\nFausto Pocar (Italy) 151\r\nLiu Daqun (China) 150\r\nChristine Van den Wyngaert (Belgium) 148\r\nCarmel Agius (Malta) 145\r\nPatrick Lipton Robinson (Jamaica) 142\r\nO-gon Kwon (Republic of Korea) 142\r\nTheodor Meron (United States) 141\r\nMohamed Shahabuddeen (Guyana) 141\r\nIain Bonomy (United Kingdom) 141\r\nJean-Claude Antonetti (France) 135\r\nKevin Horace Parker (Australia) 132\r\nAlphonsus Martinus Maria\r\n   Orie (Netherlands) 132\r\nVolodymyr Vassylenko (Ukraine 124\r\nBakone Melema Moloto (South Africa) 116\r\nMohamed Amin El-Abbassi\r\n   El Mahdi (Egypt) 106\r\nVonimbolana Rasoazanany (Madagascar) 85\r\nPrisca Matimba Nyambe (Zambia) 52\r\nElhagi Abdulkader Emberesh (Libyan\r\n   Arab Jamahiriya) 29\r\nYenyi Olungu (Democratic Republic\r\n   of the Congo) 22\r\nRigoberto Espinal Irias (Honduras) 22\r\nSharada Prasad Prandit (Nepal) 20\r\nThe Acting President: In the ballot just\r\ncompleted, again more than the required number of\r\ncandidates — in this case, 16 candidates, have obtained\r\nan absolute majority.\r\nIn accordance with the decision taken earlier, the\r\nAssembly will proceed to another unrestricted ballot to\r\nfill the 14 vacancies.\r\nIn view of the late hour, I should like to suggest\r\nthat we suspend the meeting until 3 p.m. this afternoon.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 1.20 p.m. and\r\nresumed at 3.15 p.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly\r\nwill now proceed to the third round of unrestricted\r\nballoting to fill the 14 vacancies.\r\nBefore proceeding further, I should like to recall\r\nonce again for delegations the following procedures for\r\nthe election of the judges, as was stated in the\r\nSecretary-General’s memorandum contained in\r\ndocument A/59/438.\r\nIf, in the first ballot, the number of candidates\r\nobtaining an absolute majority is less than 14, a second\r\nballot will be held, and balloting will continue in the\r\nsame meeting until 14 candidates, and no more, have\r\nobtained an absolute majority.\r\nFollowing the practice in the election of judges of\r\nthe International Court of Justice, any second and\r\nsubsequent balloting shall be unrestricted.\r\nIf more than 14 candidates obtain an absolute\r\nmajority of votes in the first ballot, a second ballot will\r\nbe held on all candidates, and balloting will continue at\r\nthe same meeting until 14 candidates, and no more,\r\nhave obtained an absolute majority.\r\nA number of representatives have asked for the\r\nfloor.\r\nMr. Elmessallati (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya):\r\nAllow me, first, to thank all the representatives who\r\nhave supported our candidate and to express my\r\ncountry’s gratitude to them.\r\nSecondly, in view of the results of the previous\r\ntwo rounds of balloting, I would like to announce that\r\nwe wish to withdraw our candidate from this election.\r\nMr. Suazo (Honduras) (spoke in Spanish): First\r\nof all, allow me to thank all those delegations that have\r\nsupported us in this electoral process, which has\r\nproved to be extremely complex in view of the\r\ncircumstances established in the statute of the Tribunal.\r\nI am grateful for the information provided on\r\nelectoral procedures in the International Court of\r\nJustice, but I would note that the Court’s electoral\r\nprocess is rather more elaborate and involves\r\nsimultaneous voting in the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council. I therefore think that the analogy\r\nmade to unrestricted ballots in which a majority of\r\nvotes is secured by certain States competing in the\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.57\r\nprocess is not the soundest comparison. My delegation\r\nwould draw attention to the need to review the\r\nelectoral process set out in the Tribunal’s statute.\r\nFinally, in order to secure consensus and\r\nagreement and to ensure that Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean are represented by our candidates Guyana\r\nand Jamaica, Honduras withdraws its candidacy.\r\nThe Acting President: Members have heard the\r\nstatements just made that Mr. Elhagi Abdulkader\r\nEmberesh of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Mr.\r\nRigoberto Espinal Irias of Honduras have decided to\r\nwithdraw their names from the list of candidates\r\nestablished by the Security Council. Accordingly, those\r\nnames will be struck from the ballot paper.\r\nIf delegations have no objection, we shall now\r\nproceed with the current round of balloting, taking into\r\naccount the statements just made by the representatives\r\nof the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Honduras.\r\nThe names of the candidates just withdrawn will\r\ntherefore be removed from the next ballot. For this\r\nballoting, I would like to request members to strike out\r\nthe names of the candidates who have just withdrawn,\r\nnamely, Mr. Elhagi Abdulkader Emberesh of the\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya and Mr. Rigoberto Espinal\r\nIrias of Honduras.\r\nWe shall now continue with the balloting.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot\r\npapers will now be distributed.\r\nI request representatives to use only those ballot\r\npapers that have been distributed. Only those\r\ncandidates whose names appear on the ballot papers\r\nare eligible for election. Representatives will indicate\r\nthe 14 candidates for whom they wish to vote by\r\nplacing crosses at the left of their names on the ballot\r\npapers. Ballot papers on which more than 14 names are\r\nmarked will be considered invalid. Votes may be cast\r\nonly for those whose names appear on the ballot\r\npapers.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Augustine\r\n(India), Ms. Viejo (Mexico), Ms. Szmidt (Poland),\r\nMs. Direito (Portugal) and Ms. Katungye\r\n(Uganda) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 3.30 p.m. and\r\nresumed at 5.05 p.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The result of the voting is\r\nas follows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 191\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 191\r\nAbstentions: 2\r\nNumber of Members voting: 189\r\nRequired absolute majority: 97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nWolfgang Schomburg (Germany) 163\r\nLiu Daqun (China) 160\r\nFausto Pocar (Italy) 157\r\nPatrick Lipton Robinson (Jamaica) 156\r\nTheodor Meron (United States) 152\r\nIain Bonomy (United Kingdom) 151\r\nChristine Van den Wyngaert (Belgium) 151\r\nO-gon Kwon (Republic of Korea) 149\r\nMohamed Shahabuddeen (Guyana) 149\r\nCarmel Agius (Malta) 148\r\nKevin Horace Parker (Australia) 147\r\nAlphonsus Martinus Maria\r\n   Orie (Netherlands) 141\r\nJean-Claude Antonetti (France) 140\r\nVolodymyr Vassylenko (Ukraine) 123\r\nBakone Melema Moloto (South Africa) 112\r\nMohamed Amin El-Abbassi\r\n   El Mahdi (Egypt) 92\r\nVonimbolana Rasoazanany (Madagascar) 72\r\nPrisca Matimba Nyambe (Zambia) 44\r\nSharada Prasad Prandit (Nepal) 21\r\nYenyi Olungu (Democratic Republic\r\n   of the Congo) 20\r\nThe Acting President: In the third ballot just\r\ncompleted, again more than the required number of\r\ncandidates — in this case, 15 candidates — have\r\nobtained an absolute majority.\r\nIn accordance with the decision taken earlier, the\r\nAssembly will proceed to another unrestricted ballot to\r\nfill the 14 vacancies.\r\nA number of representatives have asked to take\r\nthe floor.\r\nMr. Matondo Mamuamda (Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo) (spoke in French): The\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo wishes to extend its\r\nwarm thanks to the representatives of brotherly and\r\nfriendly countries that voted for our national candidate.\r\nHowever, given the results of the first, second and third\r\nrounds of balloting, the Democratic Republic of the\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.57\r\nCongo has decided to withdraw the candidacy of the\r\nperson in question.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo wishes to\r\nassure our friends and brothers here whose nationals\r\nremain candidates for positions on the Tribunal that its\r\nwithdrawal will have absolutely no impact on its\r\narrangements or other agreements of principle relating\r\nto these circumstances.\r\nMr. Musambachime (Zambia): My delegation\r\nwould like to thank all the member States that have\r\nsupported our candidature up to this point, but our\r\ndelegation feels that we should withdraw our candidate,\r\nMrs. Nyambe. In so doing, we want to assure all those\r\nthat have supported us of our gratitude and thanks.\r\nMr. Dhakal (Nepal): First of all, my delegation\r\nwould like to express its sincere gratitude to all those\r\ndelegations that have kindly extended their support to\r\nthe candidate of Nepal, Mr. Mr. Sharada Prasad Pandit,\r\nSupreme Court justice of Nepal. However, in view of\r\nthe trend or pattern of voting in the three rounds of\r\nballoting, my delegation would like to inform all\r\ndelegations here that we wish to withdraw Mr. Pandit’s\r\ncandidature.\r\nMr. Andrianarivelo-Razafy (Madagascar)\r\n(spoke in French): On behalf of the delegation of\r\nMadagascar, and in particular of our candidate, I wish\r\nvery warmly to thank all those delegations that have\r\nbeen kind enough to support Madagascar’s candidate.\r\nGiven the number of votes that she has received,\r\nhowever, we wish to inform the Assembly that we are\r\nwithdrawing the candidacy of Ms. Vonimbolana\r\nRasoazanany and wish every success to those\r\nremaining in the race.\r\nThe Acting President: Members have heard the\r\nstatements that Mr. Yenyi Olungu of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Mr. Sharada Prasad Pandit of\r\nNepal, Ms. Vonimbolana Rasoazanany of Madagascar\r\nand Ms. Prisca Matimba Nyambe of Zambia have decided\r\nto withdraw their names from the list of candidates\r\nestablished by the Security Council. Accordingly, those\r\nnames will be struck from the ballot paper.\r\nIn view of the fact that new ballots have to be\r\nprepared to take into account the withdrawals that have\r\njust been announced, I would suggest that the\r\nAssembly suspend its meeting at this point and that we\r\nresume our meeting in 10 minutes to proceed to the\r\nfourth round of balloting.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly agrees to that\r\nproposal?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 5.15 p.m. and\r\nresumed at 5.30 p.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly\r\nwill proceed to the fourth round of unrestricted\r\nballoting to fill the 14 vacancies.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot\r\npapers will now be distributed.\r\nI request representatives to use only those ballot\r\npapers that have been distributed.

The theme for this year’s Africa\r\nIndustrialization Day is ‘Strengthening\r\nProductive Capacity for Poverty Reduction\r\nwithin the Framework of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development’.\r\n“Poverty remains a big challenge for Africa.\r\nTo achieve the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nparticularly the halving of income poverty, the\r\nAfrican economies must grow. The estimates\r\nshow that annual gross domestic product per\r\ncapita growth rates of 2 to 6 per cent are required\r\nto meet that Goal. In that context, productivity\r\nenhancement plays a leading role.\r\n“As a key component of productivity,\r\nsuccessful industrialization is the motive force for\r\napplying new technologies and entrepreneurship\r\ndevelopment in Africa. It provides an enabling\r\nenvironment for human capital development,\r\npromotes institutional change, modernizes the\r\nexport structure, as well as creates new\r\nemployment opportunities.\r\n“To alleviate poverty, African countries\r\nmust introduce good industrial policies and\r\npromote domestic and foreign investment,\r\nexpansion of markets, infrastructure\r\ndevelopment, employment and technological\r\nchange. That goal can be pursued through\r\nregional integration and economic cooperation to\r\ngain access to international markets.\r\n“The leading role played by the regional\r\neconomic communities and the private sector in\r\nstrengthening the productive capacities of the\r\nmanufacturing sector is important to ensure\r\nsustained growth. With that aim, the United\r\nNations Industrial Development Organization and\r\nthe Conference of the African Ministers of\r\nIndustry have jointly launched the African\r\nProductive Capacity Initiative, which was\r\nendorsed by the African Union Summit in July\r\n2004 as the industrial component of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).\r\n“The Initiative will spell out policies and\r\nmeasures enabling African countries to enhance\r\ntheir productive capacities through a value chain\r\napproach and regional integration and enter the\r\nglobal production network.\r\n“We are happy to see that, recognizing the\r\nimportance of industry as a strategic factor of\r\neconomic development, NEPAD foresees strong\r\nindustrial policies that will help African countries\r\nstrengthen their productive capacities and ability\r\nto fight poverty. I am confident that Africa, with\r\nits vast human and natural resources and strong\r\ncommitment to the Development Goals, will be\r\nable to achieve the objectives of NEPAD.\r\n“In that context, I would like to urge the\r\ninternational community to enhance its support\r\nfor the productive capacity-building efforts of\r\nAfrican countries in order to help them achieve\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and the\r\nobjectives of NEPAD.\r\n“The strategy for strengthening the\r\nproductive capacity for poverty reduction in\r\nAfrica within the framework of NEPAD is\r\nundoubtedly a step in the right direction.\r\n“This is a day to renew and reconfirm our\r\ncommitment to working in global partnership and\r\nto contributing towards sustainable industrial\r\ndevelopment as an effective tool for poverty\r\nreduction in Africa.”\r\nAgenda item 158\r\nDeclaration by the United Nations of 8 and 9 May as\r\ndays of remembrance and reconciliation\r\nDraft resolution (A/59/L.28/Rev.1)\r\nThe Acting President: As was announced again\r\nat this morning’s meeting, at this time the Assembly\r\nwill hold only the debate on agenda item 158.\r\nI give the floor to the representative of the\r\nRussian Federation to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/59/L.28/Rev.1.\r\nMr. Fedotov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\ndelegations of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan,\r\nKyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian\r\nFederation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.57\r\nIn 2005, the entire world will celebrate the\r\nsixtieth anniversary of the victory over fascism. The\r\ngreat triumph of the Second World War was the result\r\nof the joint efforts of the peoples of many countries\r\nand was the primary impulse leading the international\r\ncommunity to establish the United Nations. Through\r\nthe suffering and death of millions, the peoples of the\r\nworld have come to see the irreplaceable nature of the\r\ninternational security system that the United Nations\r\nembodies in the maintenance of international peace.\r\nToday, it is important to recall the lessons of the\r\nSecond World War and the memory of those who died in\r\nit, and to unite the efforts of the international community,\r\nthrough the central role of the United Nations, to face the\r\nnew threats and challenges emerging in the world. The\r\nMember States must come together to address new\r\nchallenges, to achieve the pacific settlement of\r\ndisputes, to deal with conflicts in the future and to\r\nstrengthen the maintenance of stable and lasting peace.\r\nIn the general interests of humankind, we will\r\nneed to further strengthen the role and efficiency of the\r\nUnited Nations as a central element in the system of\r\ncollective security in order to implement the widely\r\nhailed objectives of the Charter and to save peoples\r\nfrom the scourge of war.\r\nToday, the General Assembly is considering the\r\ndraft resolution on the declaration by the United\r\nNations of 8 and 9 May as days of remembrance and\r\nreconciliation, contained in document A/59/L.28/Rev.1.\r\nWe believe that the General Assembly will support that\r\nimportant collective and universal initiative and help to\r\nmobilize efforts to maintain a secure and equitable\r\nworld order in accordance with the United Nations\r\nCharter. The General Assembly will hold a special\r\nsolemn meeting on 9 May 2005 in commemoration of\r\nthe sacrifices made during the war, at which a\r\ndeclaration will be made to encourage general progress\r\nand the avoidance of new wars.\r\nWe hope that the draft resolution will be adopted\r\nwithout a vote. Bearing in mind the fact that certain\r\ndelegations have asked for more time to work on the\r\ndraft, we suggest that the adoption of a decision on it\r\nbe postponed until Monday, 22 November.\r\nMr. Van den Berg (Netherlands): I have the\r\nhonour to speak briefly on behalf of the European Union.\r\nTo the European Union member States, as is the\r\ncase for many other countries around the world, the\r\nwar brought unspeakable suffering. It affected the lives\r\nof millions of people in Europe and beyond. It changed\r\nthe fates of individuals, families and whole nations.\r\nRightfully, reflection on that suffering and\r\ncommemoration of the end of that period of extreme\r\nhorrors are our common duty. It should inspire us — as\r\nindividuals, as nations, as organizations — to do\r\neverything in our power to jointly prevent war and\r\nviolence and to deal in a peaceful manner with the\r\nchallenges and threats we are facing.\r\nWe should at the same time recognize that, in\r\nmany respects, progress has been made since the end of\r\nthe Second World War towards reconciliation,\r\ninternational and regional cooperation, and the\r\npromotion of democratic values, human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms. In fact, our common United\r\nNations and our European Union bear witness to that\r\nprogress and therefore we hope that we will reach an\r\nagreement on the draft resolution just introduced by\r\nVice-Minister Fedotov.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nI would like to inform members that, at the request\r\nof the sponsors, action on draft resolution\r\nA/59/L.28/Rev.1 will be taken on Monday, 22 November\r\n2004, as the first item.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this\r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 158.\r\nAgenda item 18 (continued)\r\nElection of judges of the International Tribunal for\r\nthe Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious\r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia\r\nsince 1991\r\nLetter from the President of the Security\r\nCouncil (A/59/437)\r\nMemorandum by the Secretary-General\r\n(A/59/438)\r\nCurricula vitae (A/59/439)\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly\r\nwill now proceed to the seventh round of unrestricted\r\nballoting to fill the 14 vacancies.\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.57\r\nBefore proceeding further, I should like to recall\r\nonce again for delegations the following procedures for\r\nthe election of the judges, as was stated in the\r\nSecretary-General’s memorandum contained in\r\ndocument A/59/438.\r\nIf, in the first ballot, the number of candidates\r\nobtaining an absolute majority is less than 14, a second\r\nballot will be held, and balloting will continue in the\r\nsame meeting until 14 candidates, and no more, have\r\nobtained an absolute majority.\r\nFollowing the practice in the election of judges of\r\nthe International Court of Justice, any second and\r\nsubsequent balloting shall be unrestricted.\r\nIf more than 14 candidates obtain an absolute\r\nmajority of votes in the first ballot, a second ballot will\r\nbe held on all candidates, and balloting will continue at\r\nthe same meeting until 14 candidates, and no more,\r\nhave obtained an absolute majority.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot\r\npapers will now be distributed.\r\nI request representatives to use only those ballot\r\npapers that have been distributed. Only those\r\ncandidates whose names appear on the ballot papers\r\nare eligible for election.
