(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Sulejman Tihić, Chairman of the\r\nPresidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the Chairman of the\r\nPresidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nMr. Sulejman Tihić, Chairman of the Presidency\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Sulejman Tihić,\r\nChairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Tihić (spoke in Bosnian; English text\r\nprovided by the delegation): I wish to greet you all and\r\nexpress my great pleasure at having this opportunity to\r\naddress this Assembly. I also wish to thank the United\r\nNations, once again, for everything it has done and is\r\ndoing for my country. Specifically, I would like to\r\nstress the importance of giving support to the returnees\r\nwho were expelled from their homes.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina is a multi-ethnic country\r\nin which Bosnian Muslims, Orthodox Serbs, Catholic\r\nCroats, Jews and many other ethnicities lived in peace\r\nand tolerance for hundreds of years. In Sarajevo and in\r\nmost other Bosnian towns, one can find mosques,\r\nOrthodox and Catholic churches and Jewish temples\r\nthat have stood side by side for hundreds of years. For\r\nthis reason, Sarajevo is called the Jerusalem of Europe.\r\nPreserving the multi-ethnic structure of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, with all its characteristics and\r\ndiversities, presents an historic challenge, not only to\r\nEurope, but to the whole world. Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina is the foremost meeting point of world\r\ncultures and religions. It therefore refutes the theory of\r\nthe clash of civilizations.\r\nI would like to update you on the situation in my\r\ncountry, which has made significant progress over the\r\nlast nine years.\r\nThe infrastructure destroyed in the war has been\r\nrebuilt and macroeconomic stability has been achieved,\r\nwith only 1 per cent inflation. The banking system has\r\nbeen consolidated and foreign debts are being paid off.\r\nSince the post-war period, the gross domestic product\r\nhas increased three times over and national reserves\r\nhave increased 14 times over. Foreign currency\r\nreserves and savings are constantly increasing as well.\r\nWe are on the right path to meeting all the\r\nrequirements for starting negotiations with the\r\nEuropean Union (EU) on stabilization and association\r\nagreements. Due to the Republika Srpska entitys\r\nfailure to cooperate with the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), we have\r\nbeen unable to gain Partnership for Peace membership,\r\nalthough we meet all of the requirements.\r\nStrong reforms are under way in the areas of\r\neducation, customs, taxes, security and the defence\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nsystem. Many new central institutions have been set\r\nup, such as the Defence and Security Ministry, the\r\nintelligence service, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Joint\r\nMilitary Command and others. Compared with the\r\napproximately 500,000 soldiers of the three separate\r\narmies in 1995, the Bosnia and Herzegovina military\r\nforces now have 12,000 soldiers. The North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization (NATO) had some 70,000 soldiers\r\nin Bosnia in 1996, and the Stabilization Force (SFOR)\r\nnow has about 7,000. The security situation is stable;\r\nthe peace has never been broken. Since the Dayton\r\nPeace Accords were signed, not a single foreign soldier\r\nhas been killed in Bosnia. Instead of being a consumer\r\nof international aid, Bosnia and Herzegovina is\r\nincreasingly becoming a participant in international\r\npeace missions, such as those in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, Liberia,\r\nTimor-Leste, Haiti and others.\r\nThe common foreign, security and defence\r\npolicies of the European Union have enabled the EU to\r\ntake the leading role in Bosnia and Herzegovina. By\r\nthe end of this year, EU military forces will take over\r\nfrom SFOR in Bosnia.\r\nThe positive stabilization process  as well as\r\nthe overall progress made not only in Bosnia, but also\r\nin the other countries created after the dissolution of\r\nthe former Yugoslavia  is being slowed down by an\r\ninappropriate attitude towards war crimes and war\r\ncriminals. Some public and political officials are trying\r\nto find an excuse for the war crimes, saying they were\r\ncommitted in the interest of vital ethnic protection. Yet\r\nwar criminals are treated as national heroes. This must\r\nbe changed. Only on the basis of truth and justice can\r\nwe build confidence and reconciliation among the\r\npeople and friendly relations among our respective\r\ncountries.\r\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia has an irreplaceable role to play in\r\nthat process. We deeply appreciate the work it has done\r\nso far. In our view, it must finish the trials that have\r\nalready begun, particularly those of the highest-level\r\nofficials. Some of the cases not yet completed can be\r\ntransferred only to courts of countries where the crimes\r\nhappened. This can be done only when those countries\r\nare prepared to guarantee fair and correct trials.\r\nFull cooperation with the ICTY must be an\r\nunavoidable requirement for accession to Euro-Atlantic\r\ninstitutions. Moreover, it is not enough to arrest and\r\nprosecute only war criminals on the ICTYs list. Local\r\ncourts in our respective countries must prosecute\r\nthousands of other war criminals who are still at large,\r\nwho constitute a destabilizing factor, who hinder\r\npositive processes, and who are often connected with\r\norganized crime.\r\nIn my country, we are going to establish within\r\nthe Bosnia and Herzegovina Court a war crimes\r\nchamber. The chamber will take over some of the\r\nHague Tribunals cases, but it will also prosecute many\r\nother criminals. It is going to be The Hague in\r\nminiature. We will therefore need technical and\r\nfinancial support, and we will have to involve\r\ninternational judges and prosecutors with experience in\r\nsuch trials, above all those who have worked at The\r\nHague Tribunal.\r\nNext year will be the tenth anniversary of the\r\ngenocide against Bosnian Muslims in the United\r\nNations safe havens of Srebrenica and Zepa. The\r\npeople most responsible for that genocide, as well as\r\nfor all other war crimes committed in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina  Radovan Karadzic and Ratko\r\nMladic  have not yet been arrested. Those two men\r\nare responsible for the death of about 200,000 people.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I call on all in authority to arrest\r\nthem.\r\nThe outstanding issue of about 15,000 missing\r\npersons, whose bodies are spread among numerous\r\nmass graves throughout the country, 320 of which have\r\nbeen found so far in Bosnia, presents a big problem for\r\nmy country. We need help in finding the missing and\r\nidentifying them.\r\nThe political system set up by the Dayton and\r\nWashington Agreements played a positive role in\r\nestablishing peace, reconstruction and progress in my\r\ncountry. However, they are now increasingly becoming\r\nan obstacle to further development and progress. The\r\ncurrent administration in Bosnia, with a federation\r\ncomposed of 10 cantons, a republic and a district \r\nstrong entities and a weak State  is an obstacle in our\r\nway towards Euro-Atlantic integration. It is an\r\nextremely complicated and expensive system that is\r\nbarely operational. The people, both in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and outside, are aware of this to varying\r\ndegrees.\r\nI believe the time is coming for domestic political\r\nrepresentatives to start to discuss the revision of\r\nBosnias constitution and its compliance with\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\ninternational conventions. We have to create an\r\nefficient State with institutions and mandates that will\r\nenable us to become a full member of the EU and\r\nNATO. I hope we will get support and help from\r\nfriendly countries and the international community as a\r\nwhole. A good opportunity for this will be next year,\r\nthe tenth anniversary of the signing of the Dayton\r\nPeace Accords. It is time for Bosnia to turn from the\r\nDayton phase to the Brussels phase.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina is sincerely and firmly\r\ncommitted to strengthening friendly relations with the\r\nneighbouring Republic of Croatia and the State Union\r\nof Serbia and Montenegro on the basis of mutual\r\nrespect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and\r\nequality. Our geographical location, history, ethnic\r\ncomposition and economic and infrastructure\r\nconnections are leading us towards overall cooperation.\r\nWe are aware that, without a resolution of disputed\r\nissues, we cannot proceed further to European\r\nintegration; we already have achieved some progress in\r\nthis regard.\r\nThe countries of South-Eastern Europe have\r\nmade huge individual and joint efforts to achieve great\r\nprogress in changing the stereotype of the region as a\r\nbackward, problematic and conflict-ridden area of the\r\nEuropean suburbs. Regional cooperation is being\r\npromoted in the areas of defence, security, border\r\ncontrol, free markets, visa regimes, combating\r\ncorruption and organized crime and the protection of\r\nethnic and religious minorities.\r\nThe issue of borders in the region cannot and\r\nmust not be opened again. We have to arrange such\r\nmatters in compliance with European standards.\r\nHowever, we have to open the issue of cooperation\r\nwith respect to borders, since it is in our common\r\ninterest.\r\nI think that the Iraqi crisis needs to be resolved\r\nsimultaneously with the Palestinian issue. We therefore\r\nsupport the initiative of the Quartet and the road map\r\nas a basis for setting up a sincere dialogue between the\r\ntwo States, with United States mediation. We also\r\nstrongly condemn all terrorist acts, as well as execution\r\nwithout trial of Palestinian religious leaders. We\r\nstrongly condemn the Israeli sides construction of the\r\nprotection wall.\r\nWe are happy with the consensus among Security\r\nCouncil members on the transfer of sovereignty from\r\ncoalition forces to the legitimately elected legal and\r\nexecutive authorities in Iraq. We think the United\r\nNations should take the leading role in shaping the\r\nfuture of Iraq. The Iraqi people need to govern their\r\nown country, and the military forces that control the\r\nterritory must respect the Geneva Conventions and\r\nhumanitarian law. The territorial integrity and\r\nsovereignty of Iraq must be preserved, including\r\nsovereignty over its natural resources. We call for\r\nprotection of Iraqs world heritage civilization and holy\r\nplaces, such as Karbala and the Imam Ali mosque in\r\nNajaf. With a view to helping the people of Iraq and\r\ncontributing to the establishment of peace there,\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina has sent a unit to Iraq to\r\ndestroy mines and unexploded devices.\r\nMy country is sincerely committed to combating\r\ninternational terrorism and is an active participant in\r\nthe international anti-terrorist coalition. Terrorism is\r\nnot only a threat to peace and security; in our view, it is\r\nimmoral and counterproductive. It is immoral because\r\ninnocent people are killed, and it is counterproductive\r\nbecause terrorism cannot resolve problems. It only\r\nproduces new ones. In that regard, I would like to\r\nhighlight here the example of Bosnian Muslims, since\r\nwe were the major victim of the aggression against\r\nBosnia between 1992 and 1995. We managed to defend\r\nourselves, but both during and after the war we never\r\nturned our hands to revenge or terrorism.\r\nAllow me to review the issue of Security Council\r\nreform, as well as that of strengthening the efficiency\r\nof the mechanisms of the United Nations. The citizens\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina know from their own\r\nexperience what a lack of proper and efficient United\r\nNations action can mean. If United Nations\r\nmechanisms were more efficient, the aggression\r\nagainst Bosnia and Herzegovina would not have\r\nhappened or, at least, the war would not have been so\r\nlong. If they were more efficient, then genocide would\r\nnot have been committed in the United Nations safe\r\nhavens of Srebrenica and Zepa. For that reason, I want\r\nto remind everyone of the Organizations obligation to\r\nassist the survivors in those areas.\r\nWhen considering the situation in the world\r\ntoday, the question of efficient cooperation in the area\r\nof security is inevitably raised. The Security Council\r\nneeds to be the leading factor for peace and stability in\r\nthe world. It has to have at its disposal mechanisms\r\nthat can be operated with efficiency and speed in order\r\nto prevent conflicts from becoming military clashes.\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nAmong other proposals, we support the initiatives\r\nto enlarge the Security Councils membership.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina wants to become a non-\r\npermanent member of the Security Council. In terms of\r\nSecurity Council efficiency, our experience has been\r\nmostly a negative one. Through our participation in the\r\nwork of the Council, we hope to prevent a repetition of\r\nour experience elsewhere in the world. Therefore, we\r\ntake this opportunity to confirm our intention of\r\nputting forth our candidature for the 2010-2011 term.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina deserves that honour and we\r\nare determined to prove our worth.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Bosnia and Herzegovina for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nMr. Sulejman Tihić, President of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alejandro Toledo Manrique,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Peru\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Peru.\r\nMr. Alejandro Toledo Manrique, President of the\r\nRepublic of Peru, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Alejandro\r\nToledo Manrique, President of the Republic of Peru,\r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Toledo Manrique (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAllow me to join previous speakers in congratulating\r\nyou on your election to the presidency of the fifty-\r\nninth session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe world of the twenty-first century faces a\r\nparadox. It is unified globally in the areas of\r\nproduction, such as trade, finance and in the digital\r\nrevolution of information and communication\r\ntechnology  yet it is divided by the increase in\r\nconflicts, civil strife and transnational terrorism, as\r\nwell as cultural and ethnic violence. The world is\r\nunified by universal values, such as democracy, human\r\nrights and respect for freedom of expression and the\r\nenvironment  yet it is divided when democracy\r\nclashes with social demands for more jobs and less\r\nhunger.\r\nThose contradictory trends of globalization and\r\nfragmentation jeopardize governance not only at the\r\ninternational level, but also within nations. Conflicts\r\nsharpen; many poor States are rocked by domestic and\r\nexternal violence; terrorist organizations and traffickers\r\nin drugs, weapons and persons are emerging and\r\namassing devastating global power.\r\nSince the end of the cold war, more than 30 civil\r\nconflicts have caused approximately 5 million deaths\r\nand created almost 17 million refugees. In 2004, the\r\nUnited Nations has been administering 15\r\npeacekeeping operations and 15 special political\r\nmissions. That means that 16 per cent of Member\r\nStates are affected by issues undermining peace and\r\ninternational security.\r\nIn a context in which no single Power can assure\r\nglobal governance, in a world where fragmentation\r\nabets nuclear threats, both nations and peoples demand\r\nurgent decisions  decisions ensuring global\r\ngovernance based on international law, increased\r\nrespect for the United Nations, within a renewed and\r\nstrengthened multilateralism, and the reinforcement of\r\nthe values of peace and international justice.\r\nIn the global era, the world requires broad\r\nconsensus. Peru considers that the best solution is to be\r\nfound through both change and continuity. We must\r\nstabilize the world political situation and generate an\r\ninternational alliance for development and social\r\njustice. We call for continuity in order to attain the\r\ngoals of the United Nations. We call for peace,\r\nsecurity, juridical equality of States, the non-use of\r\nforce, the prohibition of aggression, the international\r\nrule of law governing relations among States,\r\ninternational cooperation, economic and social\r\ndevelopment and respect for human rights  all of\r\nwhich are more necessary and have more validity today\r\nthan ever before.\r\nWe also propose a change of tools, mechanisms\r\nand measures. The reform of the Security Council must\r\nbe tackled realistically, bearing in mind its role as a\r\nmechanism for collective security for the international\r\ncommunity as a whole. The people want a Security\r\nCouncil with guarantees of legitimate and effective\r\ndecisions.\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nPeru is a country whose diplomatic tradition,\r\nsince the nineteenth century, has supported\r\nmultilateralism as the best means for international\r\ndecisions, particularly to promote peace and\r\ndevelopment. Peru participates in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. My country is contributing\r\nmilitary troops in Cyprus, on the border between\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea and in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, and we are participating in Liberia and in\r\nCôte dIvoire. Recently, my Government decided to\r\nsend a fully equipped company to help achieve\r\nstability, security and the reinstitutionalization of\r\ndemocracy in the Republic of Haiti.\r\nAs a result of our long-standing participation in\r\nmaintaining peace and security and in promoting\r\ndevelopment, Peru has announced its candidacy for a\r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council during the\r\nperiod 2006-2007. We are grateful for the considerable\r\nsupport that we have received and for the favourable\r\nconsideration given to our candidacy.\r\nToday, 2.8 billion people live on $2 per day; 1.3\r\nbillion people subsist on $1 per day. Moreover, in the\r\n1990s, social inequality became more pronounced\r\nthroughout the world. According to the Worldwatch\r\nInstitute, that increase in inequality affected not only\r\npersonal incomes, but also access to water, food and\r\nenergy  public goods essential for civilized life and\r\nsocio-political stability. Today, the decrease in personal\r\nincomes and the increase in inequality are colliding\r\nlike tectonic plates, producing tremors of social\r\ndisintegration and international conflict.\r\nTherefore, we in the international community\r\nmust understand that the peace, security and stability\r\nof the world system are not related solely to political,\r\nmilitary or strategic aspects. Peace and security have\r\nsocial and economic components. Poverty and\r\nexclusion militate against peace, security and\r\ndemocracy. Social exclusion produces violence,\r\ninstability and national and international fragmentation\r\nand renders democracy fragile. We cannot overcome\r\nthat situation if we do not cause globalization to have a\r\nhuman face and to become a positive force that\r\nprovides tangible benefits to all nations and all human\r\nbeings.\r\nThe rule of law and the international legal order\r\nmust guarantee access to justice and respect for human\r\nrights. The rule of law must prevent impunity. At the\r\nsame time, democratic societies must make\r\ntransparency and the fight against corruption true\r\npolicies of the State.\r\nPeru, before the process of recovering its\r\ndemocracy, was captive to corruption, systematic\r\nhuman rights violations and the subjugation of justice\r\nto political power. The corrupt and authoritarian\r\nGovernment hijacked democracy, tortured\r\nsystematically and made corruption a tool of political\r\npower. Today, the free consciences of Peru demand that\r\nthose responsible be brought to justice. Therefore, I\r\nappeal to the Government of Japan to contribute to\r\naccess to justice by authorizing the extradition of\r\nformer President Alberto Fujimori for the crimes\r\nagainst humanity with which Peruvian justice has\r\ncharged him, including his alleged responsibility for\r\nacts of torture, forced disappearances, summary\r\nexecutions and acts of corruption. Democratic Peru\r\nguarantees a fair trial and due process under the rule of\r\nlaw. I make this appeal in the conviction that the rule\r\nof law and the international legal order must guarantee\r\naccess to justice. To deny such access is tantamount to\r\nenshrining impunity, and I am sure that the\r\ninternational order is not prepared to consider itself an\r\naccomplice to such impunity. We hope that that will\r\nnot happen.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of Peru for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Alejandro Toledo Manrique, President of the\r\nRepublic of Peru, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Sam Nujoma, President of the\r\nRepublic of Namibia\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Namibia.\r\nMr. Sam Nujoma, President of the Republic of\r\nNamibia, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Sam Nujoma,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Namibia, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nPresident Nujoma: It is a source of pride for\r\nAfricans and our friends alike to see you, Sir, presiding\r\nover the demanding business of the fifty-ninth session\r\nof the General Assembly. You bring to your high office\r\nthe immense wisdom and experience you have gained\r\nover the years as a dedicated public servant and\r\nCabinet minister of the Gabonese Republic. You hold\r\nin your capable hands the mandate given to you by the\r\nCharter of the United Nations to give new impetus to\r\nthe promotion of peace, human security and sustainable\r\ndevelopment throughout the world. I congratulate you\r\nwarmly and pledge Namibias full support to you\r\npersonally and to your Bureau.\r\nYou will recall, Mr. President, the renewed spirit\r\nand firm resolve for change demonstrated by African\r\nleaders in July 2002 in Durban, South Africa. There,\r\nwe stressed a new beginning for Africa in transforming\r\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) and\r\nlaunching the African Union and its development arm,\r\nthe New Partnership for Africas Development\r\n(NEPAD). We also reiterated our commitment to\r\nembrace the African diaspora in consolidating and\r\ntransforming our continent.\r\nI am, therefore, delighted to note that the\r\noutgoing President of the General Assembly, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Julian Hunte, hails from the sister\r\ncountry of Saint Lucia in the Caribbean. I pay tribute\r\nto him for his excellent and successful service to the\r\nUnited Nations. During his tenure of office, he showed\r\nleadership and dedication to world peace, security and\r\nsustainable development.\r\nWe are gathered once again at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters to reaffirm the precious ideals, principles\r\nand purposes of the Organization, and to transform\r\nthem into action towards ending armed conflict, saving\r\nour children and investing resources to eradicate\r\nhunger, disease and poverty in the world.\r\nOur illustrious and hardworking Secretary-\r\nGeneral, my dear brother Kofi Annan, has left no stone\r\nunturned in his tireless efforts to exert his authority in\r\nconflict situations. His insistence on the centrality and\r\nlegitimate responsibility of the Organization to be on\r\nthe side of the poor, the weak and the needy in the\r\nworld should be commended. In his annual report on\r\nthe work of the Organization (A/59/1), the Secretary-\r\nGeneral once again reminds Member States of the\r\nterrible state of the world, and offers real alternatives\r\nfor world peace and security, social development\r\nfinancing and the mitigation of the effects of the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic and other infectious diseases. I\r\ncommend the Secretary-General for his worthy\r\ninterventions and effective leadership.\r\nDuring the 1999-2000 period, Namibia had the\r\nrare honour and privilege of serving the Organization\r\nin two capacities. My country served both as a non-\r\npermanent member of the Security Council and,\r\nsimultaneously, as President of the fifty-fourth session\r\nof the General Assembly, whose task, among others,\r\nwas to prepare for the Millennium Summit and the\r\nadoption of the historic Millennium Declaration. I was\r\nthus called upon to co-chair that Summit together with\r\nmy Finnish counterpart, Her Excellency Ms. Tarja\r\nHalonen.\r\nAt that memorable Summit, the largest ever\r\ngathering of world leaders unanimously endorsed the\r\nfar-reaching Millennium Development Goals and\r\ntargets. Today we all remain bound by that historic and\r\nunique undertaking. Member States collectively\r\npledged, among other things, to eradicate extreme\r\npoverty and hunger; achieve universal primary\r\neducation; promote gender equality and empower\r\nwomen; reduce child mortality and improve maternal\r\nhealth; combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and\r\nother diseases; ensure environmental sustainability;\r\nand develop a global partnership for sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nBy endorsing those Development Goals and\r\ntargets, our Governments have made a serious and\r\nirrevocable commitment, through reliable public policy\r\ninterventions, to care for the millions of our children\r\nall over the world who are asking for nothing more\r\nthan love, protection and a peaceful childhood.\r\nIn this undertaking, we cannot ignore the ever-\r\nwidening income gap between the rich and the poor,\r\nbetween the industrialized North and the developing\r\nSouth. This situation represents a dangerous time\r\nbomb, which the world can ill afford to let take its own\r\ncourse. Our planet Earth is too small to perpetuate the\r\nunacceptable juxtaposition of abject poverty and\r\nabundant prosperity. We will deal with this situation\r\neffectively only when we promote mutually beneficial\r\ncommercial trade between the North and the South\r\nwithin the framework of North-South and South-South\r\ncooperation.\r\nI would like to emphasize that the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and targets by themselves are only\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\ndeclarations of intent. Our Governments must translate\r\nthem into sustainable policies, buttressed by adequate\r\nfinancial and technological resources, to make a real\r\ndifference in the lives of our peoples.\r\nFor its part, Namibia, in cooperation with the\r\nrelevant United Nations agencies, has adopted a\r\ncountrywide programme to implement the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and targets. In addition to\r\ndeploying our own resolve and capabilities, we call\r\nupon other development partners to assist us in our\r\nnational efforts towards nation-building, reconciliation\r\nand transformation.\r\nAt the initiative of President Luiz Inácio Lula da\r\nSilva of the Federative Republic of Brazil, world\r\nleaders converged at United Nations Headquarters on\r\n20 September 2004 to exchange views and find\r\nworkable solutions aimed at bringing an end to hunger\r\nand poverty in the world. We commend him for that\r\nimportant initiative, in which we participated. At the\r\nend of the meeting, a declaration was adopted, which\r\nNamibia fully supports. We call upon Member States\r\nand other stakeholders to implement it with due\r\nurgency.\r\nThe world has enormous resources with which to\r\nfight and defeat poverty, hunger and\r\nunderdevelopment. In this process of dialogue, we\r\nmust insist on a realistic balance between the total\r\nworld spending on war and weapons technology on the\r\none hand and the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and targets on the other. What is\r\nrequired is political will and compassion on the part of\r\nworld leaders. The debate on weapons of mass\r\ndestruction must not divide United Nations Member\r\nStates, but should lead nations to find and enhance\r\npeaceful coexistence and cooperation. Developed\r\ncountries should consider their support to the countries\r\nof the South as an act of enlightened contribution to\r\nregional and global stability, and as a purposeful\r\nincentive to encourage increased mutually beneficial\r\ncommercial trade and investment among all nations.\r\nI wish to underline the significance of my\r\npresence at the current session of the General\r\nAssembly. Attached to my attendance are a long\r\nhistory, a personal journey and an unbroken link\r\nbetween Namibia and the United Nations over many\r\nyears. I entered this building for the first time in 1960,\r\nas a petitioner before the Fourth Committee of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThat was my first humble but determined\r\nemergence on the diplomatic scene. I have spent many\r\nyears since then, attending various United Nations\r\ndebates and conferences that dealt with the\r\ndecolonization of Namibia and negotiations on self-\r\ndetermination and independence. During those many\r\nyears, I addressed some of the Security Council\r\nmeetings held in respect of the question of Namibia,\r\nstarting in 1971, as the first freedom fighter accorded\r\nsuch an opportunity.\r\nI got to meet and know many distinguished\r\nstatesmen, diplomats, fellow petitioners and eminent\r\ninternational civil servants in New York, Geneva, Paris\r\nand other important conference venues. My Namibian\r\ncolleagues and I will always treasure the advice,\r\nsupport and solidarity we received from the United\r\nNations family, and from friends the world over. Many\r\nfriendly nations of the world stood firm and rendered\r\nmoral, material and diplomatic support to the noble\r\ncause of our freedom and independence.\r\nMany world-renowned revolutionaries,\r\nparticularly on the African continent, rendered selfless\r\nsacrifices, not only towards the independence of our\r\nmotherland, but also to free the African continent from\r\ncolonial exploitation and apartheid.\r\nI therefore would like to salute and pay homage\r\nto the visionary leaders of the African continent who\r\nshaped the vision of African unity and the continents\r\nemancipation from the yoke of colonialism, foreign\r\noccupation and apartheid. Among them, I pay special\r\ntribute to Kwame Nkrumah, the first President of\r\nGhana; Ahmed Ben Bella, the first Prime Minister of\r\nAlgeria; Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt; Julius\r\nKambarage Nyerere of Tanzania; Kenneth Kaunda of\r\nZambia; General Murtala Mohammed of Nigeria;\r\nAntonio Agostinho Neto of Angola; and other African\r\nleaders and pan-Africanists.\r\nNamibias protracted liberation struggle was\r\nbloody and bitter. It caused the untold suffering and\r\nsacrifices of our people inside the country and those of\r\nus who were forced to spend many decades in exile.\r\nAfter many years of struggle, the international\r\ncommunity finally recognized and endorsed the\r\nlegitimacy of our cause for freedom, equality and\r\njustice, led by our national liberation movement, the\r\nSouth-West Africa Peoples Organization (SWAPO) of\r\nNamibia.\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nNamibia became principally the legal\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations, and in that way a\r\nunique partnership was forged for a common cause\r\nbetween the world Organization and the struggling\r\nNamibian people, which endured for 30 daunting and\r\neventful years.\r\nOn 21 March 1990, His Excellency Javier Pérez\r\nde Cuéllar, then Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, swore me in as President of the Republic of\r\nNamibia. Later in September of the same year, I\r\nreturned to the United Nations to address the General\r\nAssembly and, on behalf of my people, to thank the\r\nUnited Nations for the special partnership and the\r\nprincipled support in various forms that eventually\r\ngave birth to the 160th State Member of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nI paid tribute to those United Nations civil\r\nservants and members of the United Nations Transition\r\nAssistance Group (UNTAG) who served diligently to\r\nensure the full implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 435 (1978). I also paid homage to those who\r\ndied in the course of their duty in Namibia.\r\nI wish to recall with appreciation that my initial\r\naccess to the United Nations was made possible by\r\nnon-governmental organizations, church groups, a\r\nhandful of United Nations staff members and\r\nconcerned diplomats from friendly countries. I\r\nsincerely thank them all. The Namibian people salute\r\nthem and will forever honour the memories we shared.\r\nAmong those many organizations, I wish to\r\nparticularly single out and pay deserved tribute to the\r\nAfrica-America Institute for its exceptional dedication\r\nto provide and expand educational opportunities to\r\nAfricans across our continent, including Namibians,\r\nboth before and after our independence. I join other\r\nAfrican leaders in welcoming the Africa-America\r\nInstitutes fiftieth anniversary education partnership\r\ncampaign, which I wholeheartedly recommend for\r\nglobal support.\r\nBy my own decision and in compliance with our\r\nConstitution, I will be serving as President of the\r\nRepublic only until 20 March 2005. I will then bid\r\nfarewell to my State duties and public functions. I am\r\nlooking forward to a less hectic life, but I will remain a\r\nfully engaged private citizen. I intend to undertake\r\ncertain causes that are dear to my heart and be ready to\r\nassist national, regional and international efforts,\r\nespecially in the areas of poverty eradication, people\r\nwith disabilities, food production and infrastructure\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAt the beginning of my statement, I referred to\r\nthe launch of the African Union, NEPAD and Africas\r\nresolve to pursue a new beginning. I now want to add\r\nanother crucial dimension, that of gender equality and\r\nthe empowerment of women in decision-making and\r\ntheir election to national, regional and international\r\ninstitutions.\r\nOur subregional organization, the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community, spearheaded this\r\nnew thinking, and we are happy that the African Union\r\nhas also started implementing this progressive and\r\nforward-looking agenda.\r\nThe recent inauguration of the Pan-African\r\nParliament, which is hosted by South Africa, is a\r\nlitmus test for Africas renewal. We must not delay or\r\nfail in our joint venture to achieve the total integration\r\nof our continent.\r\nThe recognition and the full participation of\r\nwomen in decision-making are fundamental to Africas\r\ntransformation and industrialization. With that in mind,\r\nwe proudly acknowledge the election of Mrs. Gertrude\r\nMongella of Tanzania, who became the first President\r\nof the Pan-African Parliament. There is no shortage of\r\ncompetent and experienced African women to lead the\r\nway forward. The African Union Commission includes\r\nfemale commissioners from various African countries.\r\nAfrica must place at the top of its agenda the\r\ninvolvement and support of women as leaders and role\r\nmodels.\r\nSince the days of the Organization of African\r\nUnity, the United Nations and Africa have been true\r\npartners. In the process, they have offered one another\r\nmutual support and ever increasing cooperation in the\r\nvital fields of conflict resolution, peace-building,\r\nhumanitarian relief and social development. Now that\r\nthe African Union has established its Peace and\r\nSecurity Council, in addition to NEPAD, we envisage a\r\nwider scope for cooperation and resource mobilization\r\nto plan for the prevention of armed conflicts and\r\nhuman suffering in Africa.\r\nWith the attainment of sustained peace and\r\nstability, Africas economic growth and poverty\r\neradication will become a reality and the hopes and\r\naspirations of our people will be realized. To that end,\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nwe need continued and strong partnership with the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nFrom this podium and in various other forums,\r\nwe have reaffirmed our belief in a peaceful,\r\ndemocratic, transparent and just international system.\r\nWe have advocated a system that would bring the poor\r\nand the rich of the world together to save the lives of\r\nmillions and pursue sustainable development and\r\nhuman security.\r\nTo achieve that noble objective, the United\r\nNations, in particular the Security Council, cannot\r\ncontinue operating on the basis of undemocratic\r\nstructures of decision-making. The Council should be\r\nreformed without delay; political will is what is\r\nlacking. We can do better. Now is the time. Africa\r\nneeds its place as a key player in this world body. We\r\ndemand our share of responsibility.\r\nThe current war in Iraq has divided the world,\r\ncausing enormous human suffering and undermining\r\ninternational peace and security. There is widespread\r\ndistrust among nations, and the danger of nuclear\r\nproliferation makes the situation even more alarming.\r\nMillions of people in Africa, especially in the\r\nGreat Lakes region and the Sudan, continue to\r\nexperience untold suffering due to conflict and war.\r\nNamibia is deeply concerned about the killings and the\r\nhuman rights violations against innocent women,\r\nchildren and the elderly in the Darfur region of the\r\nSudan. We call on all parties concerned, in particular\r\nthe Government of the Sudan, to implement without\r\ndelay all the agreements and commitments they have\r\nmade.\r\nAgainst that background, my Government fully\r\nsupports Security Council resolution 1564 (2004) of\r\n18 September 2004. While we support the efforts of the\r\nAfrican Union to find a peaceful solution to that highly\r\nvolatile situation, we feel strongly that the Security\r\nCouncil should assume full responsibility in\r\naccordance with the Charter. This problem can be\r\nresolved only through a Security Council resolution\r\nestablishing a peacekeeping mission for Sudan, in\r\nparticular to deal with human suffering in Darfur. In\r\nthat context, as a product of the United Nations\r\nourselves, and in the light of our commitment to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\r\nNamibia is prepared to contribute a battalion to such a\r\nUnited Nations mission.\r\nThe United Nations Settlement Plan for Western\r\nSahara must be implemented immediately. Likewise,\r\nthe inalienable rights of the Palestinian people must be\r\nrealized. We, the international community, owe it to\r\nthem.\r\nNamibia reiterates its call for the immediate and\r\nunconditional lifting of the United States embargo\r\nagainst Cuba in order to allow the people of the two\r\ncountries to coexist peacefully.\r\nThe global security situation is being further\r\nthreatened by the emergence of mercenaries, who\r\nundermine legitimate Governments. The African\r\ncontinent has not been spared by this ugly\r\nphenomenon, which should be condemned by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe United Nations is the ideal place for finding\r\nsolutions through multilateral negotiations and\r\ncompromise. The Secretary-General needs the\r\nunwavering support of all Member States in order to\r\nplay an effective role in the Middle East and Africa\r\nand in conflict situations around the world. Whether\r\nfighting poverty, HIV/AIDS or terrorism, the\r\ninternational community must act as one. We must stop\r\nhuman suffering and promote security and prosperity\r\nfor all.\r\nNamibia stands for peace, unity, stability and\r\nmutually beneficial economic partnership. Our\r\nConstitution is the primary guide we rely on in those\r\npursuits.\r\nMy Government is implementing Vision 2030\r\nand the successive national development plans in\r\nstages, with a view to further enhancing economic\r\ngrowth and improving the living conditions of our\r\npeople, including by transforming our villages into\r\nviable socio-economic participants. Poverty, education,\r\nhealth care, unemployment, HIV/AIDS, skills\r\ndevelopment, the empowerment of women, the\r\nprotection of children and assistance to people with\r\ndisabilities are among the urgent national priorities\r\ncovered in those people-centred government\r\ninterventions.\r\nWe carry them out in partnership with business,\r\nlabour and those representing civil society. Happily, the\r\ncompetent United Nations agencies and international\r\nexperts based in Namibia are working closely with my\r\nGovernment to bring prosperity and transformation to\r\nNamibia and the subregion. When we succeed, Africa\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nwill benefit and the world, too, will acknowledge the\r\nshared rewards of development partnerships.\r\nI conclude my statement in the confidence that,\r\nthrough the United Nations, humanity will triumph\r\nover the challenges that confront us today so that the\r\nfuture generations will live in peace, free from the\r\nscourges of war, poverty, hunger and disease. I believe\r\nstrongly that our common goals and objectives are\r\nachievable because a people united, striving to achieve\r\na common good for all members of society, will always\r\nemerge victorious. Long live the United Nations!\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of Namibia for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Sam Nujoma, President of the Republic of\r\nNamibia, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the\r\nRepublic of South Africa\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of South Africa.\r\nMr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the Republic of\r\nSouth Africa, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Thabo Mbeki,\r\nPresident of the Republic of South Africa, and to invite\r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nPresident Mbeki: There are some matters on\r\nwhich we all agree. One of these is that, later this year,\r\nwe will receive the important report that will be tabled\r\nby the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\r\nChange, which was constituted by our Secretary-\r\nGeneral. The other is that, next year, we will mark the\r\ntenth anniversaries of the Copenhagen World Summit\r\non Sustainable Development and the Beijing World\r\nConference on Women and discuss their outcomes. The\r\nthird matter on which we all agree is that, next year, we\r\nwill observe the fifth anniversary of the adoption of the\r\nhistoric Millennium Declaration.\r\nWe will also agree that we took all these\r\ninitiatives  the convening of the social, womens and\r\nmillennium summits and the constitution of the High-\r\nLevel Panel  because we were of one mind that we\r\nhad a number of problems that needed to be solved. In\r\nthe Millennium Declaration, we used inspiring words\r\nto sum up our response to these problems. We said:\r\nWe have a collective responsibility to uphold the\r\nprinciples of human dignity, equality and equity\r\nat the global level. As leaders we have a duty\r\ntherefore to all the worlds people, especially the\r\nmost vulnerable and, in particular, the children of\r\nthe world, to whom the future belongs.\r\n(resolution 55/2, para. 2)\r\nWe went on to say:\r\nWe are determined to establish a just and lasting\r\npeace all over the world in accordance with the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter. (ibid.,\r\npara. 4)\r\nWe also said that our efforts to make globalization\r\nfully inclusive and equitable\r\nmust include policies and measures, at the\r\nglobal level, which correspond to the needs of\r\ndeveloping countries and economies in transition\r\nand are formulated and implemented with their\r\neffective participation. (ibid., para. 5)\r\nTo this we added the commitment that\r\nWe will spare no effort to free our fellow men,\r\nwomen and children from the abject and\r\ndehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty\r\nWe are committed to making the right to\r\ndevelopment a reality for everyone and to freeing\r\nthe entire human race from want. (ibid.,\r\npara. 11)\r\nNaturally, we have no choice but to agree that we\r\ndid say all these things and would undoubtedly agree\r\nthat we meant what we said. I trust that this will not\r\nmark the end of the range of issues over which we\r\nwould speak with one voice. I say this because, when I\r\nhave asked myself the question Have we achieved the\r\ngoals we set ourselves?, I have found it impossible\r\nnot to answer that we have failed. There may very well\r\nbe others among us who will take a different view and\r\nsay that a good beginning has been made and therefore\r\nthat it is too early to say we have failed.\r\nBut I am certain that if we say to those affected\r\nby violence and war that we have made a good\r\nbeginning towards the establishment of a just and\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nlasting peace all over the world, they will not believe\r\nus. I am equally certain that if we say to those who go\r\nto bed hungry every day that we have made a good\r\nbeginning towards freeing the entire human race from\r\nwant, they will also not believe us.\r\nI would make bold to say that the vision of\r\nhuman dignity, equality and equity at the global level\r\nthat we enunciated in this imposing forum four years\r\nago resonates among the ordinary people who are\r\nvictims of hunger and war as a beautiful dream that\r\nwill inevitably be deferred.\r\nDoes this mean that, when we made the promises\r\nwe made, we deliberately intended to tell the billions\r\nof ordinary people a lie? The answer to that question is\r\nobviously no. Did we speak as we did simply\r\nbecause talk is easy and cheap? Again, the answer to\r\nthat question is obviously no. The question must\r\ntherefore arise as to why the grandeur of our words and\r\nthe vision they paint  of a world of peace, free of\r\nwar, a world characterized by shared prosperity, free of\r\npoverty  has not produced the grand results we\r\nsincerely sought and seek.\r\nIt would seem to me that the answer to that\r\nquestion lies in the fact that we have as yet not\r\nseriously confronted the difficult issues that relate to\r\nthe uses and perhaps the abuses of power. Yesterday, in\r\nhis statement on his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nspoke eloquently about the 3,000-year-old Code of\r\nHammurabi, and said: That code was a landmark in\r\nmankinds struggle to build an order where, instead of\r\nmight making right, right would make might\r\n(A/59/PV.3). We took it that the Secretary-General was,\r\nin his own elegant way, drawing our attention to the\r\ncentral question of our day: the uses and abuses of\r\npower.\r\nContemporary human society is characterized by\r\na gross and entrenched imbalance in the distribution of\r\npower. That power is held and exercised by human\r\nbeings. As human beings, the powerful share many\r\nthings with the powerless. Together, the powerful and\r\nthe disempowered share the common human needs to\r\neat, to drink water, to be protected from the elements,\r\nto dream, to love, to laugh, to play, and to live.\r\nBut life itself tells us that all of that describes\r\nonly what human beings share. The rest, the relations\r\namong us as social beings, is defined by our varied\r\naccess to power and its exercise.\r\nWithout fear of contradiction, I have said that we\r\nall agree that later this year we will receive the report\r\nof the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\r\nChange. I am equally convinced that, depending on\r\nwhere we stand relative to the power equation, we will\r\nhold radically different views about what constitutes\r\nhumanitys most serious threats and challenges, and\r\ntherefore what must be changed to respond to that\r\nperceived reality.\r\nBoth the powerful and the disempowered will\r\nundoubtedly agree that terrorism and war represent a\r\nserious threat to all humanity. They will agree that we\r\nwere right to make the commitment in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration to work for\r\na just and lasting peace all over the world in\r\naccordance with the purposes and principles of\r\nthe Charter (resolution 55/2, para. 4).\r\nMany of those who have already addressed the\r\nAssembly have correctly drawn our attention to many\r\ninstances of terrorism and war, to which we are all\r\nopposed. They have spoken of the bombings of the\r\nUnited States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and of\r\nthe African and American lives those claimed; of the\r\nheinous 11 September outrage in this city; and of the\r\nacts of terrorism in Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Morocco,\r\nSpain, Israel, Gatumba in Burundi, Beslan in the\r\nRussian Federation, and elsewhere.\r\nThey have correctly drawn our attention to the\r\nviolent conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo,\r\nBurundi, the Sudan, Palestine, Israel, Iraq,\r\nAfghanistan, Chechnya, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and\r\nelsewhere, and to other unsolved problems, such as\r\nself-determination for the people of Western Sahara,\r\nthat cry out for a solution.\r\nBoth the powerful and the disempowered agree\r\nthat the international community must act together\r\nsuccessfully to confront these situations and therefore\r\nthe threat and challenge of terrorism and war.\r\nHowever, the powerful will also make the\r\nadditional determination that terrorism and war\r\nconstitute the central and principal threat and challenge\r\nthat human civilization faces. They will make that\r\ndetermination because, almost by definition, the\r\nterrorists target them simply because they are\r\npowerful; they have no logical choice but to identify\r\nterrorism as the central and principal threat and\r\nchallenge they face, and to which they must respond.\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nBecause of their place in the power equation,\r\nwhat they decide will necessarily represent the global\r\ndecision of what constitutes the central, principal and\r\nmost urgent threat and challenge to human society,\r\nnecessitating various changes in the global system of\r\ngovernance. What they decide will translate into a set\r\nof obligatory injunctions, issued by this Organization,\r\nwhich all Member nations will have to accept and\r\nimplement.\r\nAgain, both the powerful and the disempowered\r\nwill undoubtedly also agree that poverty, want and\r\nunderdevelopment constitute serious problems that all\r\nhumanity must confront. Many of those who have\r\nalready addressed the Assembly have correctly drawn\r\nour attention to the reality of poverty, which billions\r\nacross the globe continue to experience.\r\nAmong other things, they have correctly\r\nreminded us of the fact that some countries are poorer\r\ntoday than they were a decade ago. They have pointed\r\nto the virtual certainty that we will fail to meet the\r\nMillennium Development Goals we set ourselves four\r\nyears ago.\r\nBoth the powerful and the disempowered agree\r\nthat the international community must act together\r\nsuccessfully to confront this situation, and therefore\r\nthe threat and challenge of poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment. However, the disempowered, who\r\nare also the poor of the world, will also make the\r\nadditional determination that poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment constitute the central and principal\r\nthreat and challenge that human civilization faces.\r\nThey will make the determination that, because\r\nthey are the daily victims of deprivation and want,\r\nwhich claim the lives of millions every year \r\ntranslating into cold statistics about shortened life\r\nexpectancy  deprivation and want represent the\r\ncentral and principal threat and challenge that\r\nhumanity faces, necessitating changes in the global\r\nsystem of governance in order effectively to respond to\r\nthat reality.\r\nBut because they are powerless, those billions \r\nthe overwhelming majority of the same humanity that\r\nneeds to eat, to drink water, to be protected from the\r\nelements, to dream, to love, to laugh, to play, to live \r\nwill have no possibility of persuading this\r\nOrganization, laughably described in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration as the most universal and most\r\nrepresentative Organization in the world, to translate\r\nwhat they have concluded into obligatory injunctions,\r\nissued by this Organization, which all Member nations\r\nwill have to accept and implement.\r\nIf, for a moment, we resist the temptation to\r\nspeak in parables or in tongues, for fear that we might\r\nbe punished for telling the truth, we must say that this\r\nstark and simple reality reflects the distribution of\r\npower and wealth in contemporary human society.\r\nThe wealthy and powerful feel, correctly,\r\nmortally threatened by the fanatical rage of the\r\nterrorists. They have the power to respond to this\r\npresent and immediate danger with all their might, and,\r\nbecause they are mighty, they can determine for all\r\nhumanity that the principal threat to them is the\r\nprincipal threat that all humanity faces.\r\nThe poor and powerless feel threatened by a\r\npermanent hurricane of poverty, which is devastating\r\ntheir communities as horrendously as hurricane Ivan\r\ndestroyed the Caribbean island State of Grenada.\r\nBut, tragically, because they are poor, they do not\r\nhave the means to respond to this present and\r\nimmediate danger. Neither do they have the power to\r\ndetermine for all humanity that what they decide is the\r\nprincipal threat they confront, is also the principal\r\nthreat that all humanity, including the rich and\r\npowerful, faces.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration, we spoke of the\r\nneed to implement\r\npolicies and measures, at the global level, which\r\ncorrespond to the needs of developing countries\r\nand economies in transition and are formulated\r\nand implemented with their effective\r\nparticipation (ibid., para. 5).\r\nPerhaps the mistake we made was to assume that\r\nthe contemporary distribution of power in human\r\nsociety would permit this outcome, and that, regardless\r\nof this fundamental consideration, it would be possible\r\nfor the concerns of the poor to take precedence on the\r\nglobal agenda and the global programme of action.\r\nWe comforted, or perhaps deluded, ourselves\r\nwith the thought that this Organization is the most\r\nuniversal and most representative organization in the\r\nworld  afraid to ask the question, is it?\r\nEvery year many of us who have spoken, and will\r\nspeak, from this rostrum make an annual pilgrimage to\r\nthis great and vibrant city to plead the cause of the\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\npoor of the world, hopeful that this time our voices will\r\nbe heard. Every year, after a few days, we pack up our\r\nbags to return to the reality of our societies, whose\r\nsqualor stands out in sharp contrast to the splendour of\r\nNew York and this majestic precinct that constitutes\r\nthe headquarters of the United Nations.\r\nIn the aftermath, resolutions are passed. Again\r\nand again our permanent representatives, with their\r\nextraordinary and plenipotentiary powers, report that\r\nthose resolutions oblige us to act to thwart the deadly\r\nplans of murderous terrorist gangs. Again and again\r\nthey report that yet another appeal has been made to\r\nthe mighty and the lowly alike, voluntarily to respond\r\nto the cries of the wretched of the earth.\r\nWe are truly proud and inspired to see you,\r\nMr. President, presiding over the proceedings of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, because we\r\nknow that you will discharge your obligations as a son\r\nof the poor of the world should. We are moved by the\r\nfact that you had as your predecessor President Julian\r\nHunte, who also understood intimately what must be\r\ndone to ensure that the United Nations can become, in\r\nreality, the indispensable common house of the entire\r\nhuman family.\r\nAs an Israeli said to us at our headquarters in\r\nPretoria a fortnight ago, it is perhaps time that we, the\r\npoor and powerless, abandon our wheelchairs and\r\nbegin to walk unaided. Perhaps that will help to build\r\nthe social order of which Hammurabi  and Kofi\r\nAnnan  spoke, in which right makes might and not\r\nmight, right.\r\nMr. Mwanawasa (Zambia), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof South Africa for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the Republic of\r\nSouth Africa, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ismail Omar Guelleh, President of\r\nthe Republic of Djibouti\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of\r\nDjibouti.\r\nMr. Ismail Omar Guelleh, President of the\r\nRepublic of Djibouti, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ismail Omar Guelleh,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Djibouti, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Guelleh (spoke in French): The\r\nprotracted period of tension that the international\r\ncommunity is currently experiencing underscores the\r\nneed for greater cooperation and commitment. It is\r\nfortunate, therefore, that during the past year the\r\nGeneral Assembly benefited from the capable guidance\r\nof President Julian Hunte. The wealth of experience of\r\nhis successor, Mr. Jean Ping, together with his great\r\ndiplomatic acumen and insight, lead us to feel\r\nconfident that he is in the right place at the right time.\r\nWe pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for the exemplary manner in which he has\r\npromoted the United Nations and maintained and\r\nincreased its relevance for the most critical issues of\r\nthe day. The degree to which the United Nations is\r\nconsulted on and participates in pivotal events and the\r\nresolution of crises throughout the world is a tribute to\r\nMr. Annans selfless dedication to the Organization.\r\nHe is also to be commended for the closer\r\nworking relationship that he has been able to foster\r\nwith the private sector and civil society through the\r\nglobal compact, with the aim of offering help and\r\nexpertise to needy communities and young people.\r\nAs the Secretary-General stated in his most recent\r\nreport on the work of the Organization, the United\r\nNations  indeed, the world  has had a very difficult\r\nand challenging year. Many of us have been\r\ntraumatized by terrorism, by the brutal acts of\r\nrepression that are taking place in many parts of the\r\nworld and by the tense situation and developments in\r\nIraq.\r\nFor the majority of the worlds people, however,\r\nthe most immediate threats are those of hunger,\r\npoverty, lack of drinking water, environmental\r\ndegradation and endemic or infectious diseases,\r\nincluding HIV/AIDS and malaria. Overall, the\r\nSecretary-General notes that we have departed\r\nconsiderably from the vision and spirit of the\r\nMillennium Declaration of 2000, which embodied the\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\naspirations of our time: a world united by common\r\nvalues, with the primary goal of providing better living\r\nconditions for humanity, in an environment of peace\r\nand security.\r\nUnfortunately, as the Secretary-General notes,\r\nevents related to terrorism have shaken our sense of\r\ncommon purpose. The tragedy of 11 September 2001,\r\nthe wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the ongoing\r\nbloodshed in the Middle East and other disturbing\r\nincidents throughout the world have profoundly\r\ndivided the international community about how to\r\nensure our collective security.\r\nWhile we have seen many examples of State\r\nterrorism, terrorism has become essentially stateless\r\nand nebulous in nature, and is able to spread without\r\nregard to borders or nationalities. Although there is no\r\ndisputing the fact that terrorism must be confronted\r\npromptly and vigorously, the knee-jerk reaction of\r\nattempting to crush it militarily fails to address its\r\nmany manifestations or get to its root causes.\r\nWe must pay special heed to our prejudices and\r\nfears as we endeavour to resolve difficult political\r\nproblems that may have been building for decades.\r\nWe must also accept that terrorism is not a faith\r\nor an ideology. It may well be a tactic or a strategy of\r\nlast resort on the part of those who view themselves,\r\ntheir faith, their beliefs or their physical environment\r\nas endangered. While we must act resolutely in\r\nconfronting acts of terrorism, to do so precipitately,\r\nwithout examining the underlying causes, could prove\r\ndestructive or even fatal. No one should excuse the\r\nbrutal and heinous crimes that are being committed in\r\nso many places today, but we must acknowledge that\r\nthe situation requires us to find a solution.\r\nThe international community is threatened by the\r\ninstability that this phenomenon entails. We must not\r\nunderestimate the importance of realistic foreign and\r\ndevelopment policies directed at resolving tensions and\r\nreducing poverty. We must find a way to bring the\r\nworld together to reconcile differences and eliminate\r\nreasons for misunderstanding. The words and thoughts\r\nof the late American President, Franklin D. Roosevelt,\r\nare relevant here. For him, security meant not only\r\nsafety from attack by outside aggressors, but also\r\neconomic, social and moral security. As he said,\r\nessential to such a peace is a decent standard of living\r\nfor all individuals, for freedom from fear is eternally\r\nlinked with freedom from want.\r\nWe are all aware of the commitments we made at\r\nthe Millennium Summit in 2000. The critical needs and\r\nills confronting mankind were identified at that\r\nSummit, and we committed to resolving them in\r\nvarious ways and according to a specific timetable. The\r\neight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\r\nrepresent a worldwide quest to eliminate poverty and\r\nhunger while improving health care, education and the\r\nenvironment.\r\nSadly, an evaluation of progress towards reaching\r\nthese goals by the target dates reveals that we are\r\nmaking erratic progress. A recent study in Geneva\r\nfound that the world is scarcely making a third of the\r\neffort necessary to achieve these modest targets. In\r\nparticular, the eighth goal, which calls for a global\r\npartnership of rich and poor countries for development,\r\nenvisioned a substantial increase in official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA), a reduction or\r\ncancellation of debts, the removal of protectionist\r\nbarriers for agricultural products and free access to the\r\nmarkets of the industrialized countries. Needless to\r\nsay, progress on this goal has been limited. It is the\r\nonly goal lacking a deadline or timetable and is\r\nhampered by the apparent reluctance of developed\r\ncountries to keep their commitments.\r\nOf the 50 least developed countries (LDCs), 34\r\nare in Africa. Although five or six African countries\r\nare close to transitioning, only one has successfully\r\nmade a smooth transition. Attempts to mobilize\r\ndomestic resources through the private sector will\r\nrequire more time and funds. Low levels of savings and\r\ninvestment rates testify to the huge decline in resources\r\nneeded for development. Undoubtedly, there is an\r\nurgent need to continually increase development\r\nassistance to this group of countries.\r\nAfricas need for development assistance has\r\ncreated the impression that the continent is a major\r\nfinancial burden to the international community. In\r\nfact, while Africa is disproportionately aid-dependent,\r\nit does not receive a disproportionate amount of aid.\r\nOverall, as things stand, LDCs will not be able to\r\nreduce poverty, achieve universal primary education or\r\nreverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. A report by\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) describes LDCs woeful\r\ndeficits in savings dedicated to growth, public\r\ninvestment and essential services. The report also\r\nstates that the conclusion is unequivocal and that on\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nthe basis of domestic resources alone, LDCs cannot lift\r\nthemselves out of poverty.\r\nToday, in a post-11-September world, a new\r\nrationale for aid is emerging. Aid is increasingly seen\r\nas a potent force in the war on terror by providing\r\nsupport to both front-line States and weak States in\r\nwhich terrorism could breed. Additionally, there is a\r\nmounting recognition of endemic poverty and of the\r\ninequalities that threaten national security interests.\r\nDespite this realization, however, development\r\nassistance programmes have become more selective,\r\naimed at a small group of countries that are in some\r\nway qualified. Nevertheless, many countries fail to\r\nqualify for this aid. Concrete actions must be taken for\r\nthe sake of the millions suffering in those countries.\r\nWe ignore them at our own risk.\r\nCommon sense tells us that conflict is endemic\r\nand hardly any region in the world has escaped its\r\nviolence. However, the reality is that no new civil wars\r\nhave broken out recently, and there has been a decline\r\nin the number of drawn-out conflicts within and\r\nbetween States. We notice that although the number of\r\nvictims has risen sharply, the number of terrorist\r\nincidents has in fact declined. That said, fewer people\r\nare being killed by war than at almost anytime in the\r\npast century. Few wars are beginning and many old\r\nones are ending. This is particularly true in Africa,\r\nwhere some seven millions souls perished in the\r\nconflicts of Angola, Congo, Sudan, Sierra Leone,\r\nLiberia and Somalia. With the exception of the Darfur\r\nregion in the Sudan, each one of those conflicts\r\nappears to be either coming to an end, winding down\r\nor stabilizing. Of course, we are all deeply saddened by\r\nthe scale of the tragedy in Darfur. This issue, however,\r\nneeds to be tackled with the greatest care, clarity,\r\nfairness and seriousness. We must be cautious about\r\nmaking generalizations and forming prejudices too\r\nsoon. We need to direct our efforts towards the right\r\nsolutions.\r\nConflicts, of course, require weapons, and\r\nreducing this threat requires a halt to arms shipments.\r\nThese shipments divert vital resources from other\r\ncritical needs. The countries of Asia, Latin America,\r\nthe Middle East and Africa spend some $22 billion on\r\narms each year, that is, more than two thirds of arms\r\nsales worldwide.\r\nSolidifying peace in the world calls for more\r\npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking and additional\r\npeacekeeping missions. Unless fully supported by the\r\ninternational community through additional resources,\r\nfurther operations would strain United Nations\r\nplanning, pre-positioned forces, logistics, procurement\r\nand command and control capabilities. What is\r\nrequired, therefore, is greater assistance for regional\r\npeacekeeping capabilities, particularly in Africa.\r\nAny action undertaken must necessarily have the\r\napproval of the United Nations. This is the only path\r\nthat confers a degree of legitimacy on any undertaking.\r\nAction undertaken by the United Nations implies the\r\napproval of the Security Council. Here it must be noted\r\nthat the Council continues to operate in accordance\r\nwith the legacy of the Second World War in terms of its\r\nstructure.\r\nFurthermore, the exponential growth in United\r\nNations membership is not reflected in the Council.\r\nThere is an urgent need for the developing world to\r\nhave a stronger voice in the Council. The Council must\r\nhave a more equitable and realistic distribution, in\r\nterms of both representation and composition. Security\r\nCouncil reform is long overdue and there is an urgent\r\nneed to expand the reform in both the permanent and\r\nnon-permanent categories, embracing developing and\r\ndeveloped countries. We are pleased with the\r\nestablishment by the Secretary-General of the High-\r\nLevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. Some\r\nof its initial soundings cover the expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council, recalling members commitment to\r\ncontribute to national and international peace and\r\nsecurity. We deem auspicious the projected full review\r\nof the Councils work at the end of every decade,\r\nincluding a review of the manpower and financial\r\nresources of peacekeeping missions. We await the\r\nPanels report this December to the Secretary-General,\r\nand we will consider his comments during the next\r\nsession of the Assembly.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nFollowing the Arta Peace Conference, which we\r\ninitiated and the outlines of which I presented to this\r\nvery Assembly several years ago, the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\r\nmember States considered it necessary to complete this\r\nprocess by broadening its base. Since then, and to date,\r\nthe Somali reconciliation conference in Nairobi,\r\nKenya, under the auspices of IGAD, has achieved\r\ntangible progress, which we welcome. Particular\r\nrecognition should be addressed to all IGAD member\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nStates for their self-sacrifice and devotion, especially\r\nto our brothers from Kenya, whose good offices,\r\npatience and determination allowed the negotiations to\r\ncontinue even in the most critical moments. Indeed, the\r\nSomali representatives, spurred by the will of the\r\nregion and the convergence of political and financial\r\nsupport of the international community, worked\r\nrelentlessly to set up the first pillar of the Somali\r\nGovernment institutions  that is, the Transitional\r\nParliament. This first stage, welcomed by the Somali\r\npeople within the country and in the diaspora, and the\r\ninternational community as a whole, finally brought a\r\nglimmer of hope that the reign of anarchy and chaos\r\nwould soon come to an end in Somalia.\r\nThe divergences of view that prevailed for a long\r\ntime among the countries of the region on ways of\r\nresolving the Somali conflict have now yielded to\r\ncommon sense and collective resolve, to work in\r\nharmony and to collaborate in a sincere and fraternal\r\nspirit towards the ultimate goal of helping our Somali\r\nbrothers achieve legitimate and lasting peace.\r\nThe misunderstandings and difficulties\r\nencountered during the process have provided an\r\nopportunity for a fresh review of the statements of the\r\nvarious regional actors for a clear-eyed and in-depth\r\nanalysis, imbued with the genuine desire to show the\r\nsolidarity of IGAD countries towards Somalia, and has\r\nmade it possible to underscore the common need to\r\nhelp the Somali people to establish a broad-based\r\nGovernment that is representative and legitimate. This\r\nConference has culminated in a Somali Parliament,\r\nwhere all the factions and various components of\r\nSomali civil society are represented, such as\r\nintellectuals, professionals, women and others. Last\r\nweek, the members of Parliament elected a Speaker,\r\nand today they are electing his deputies before\r\nproceeding on 10 October to elect the President of the\r\nTransitional Government.\r\nWithout a doubt, and very importantly so, the\r\nfacts bear out that we are today in a significantly\r\ndifferent mood than the past, because this time the\r\nSomali people are more determined to deepen their\r\ndialogue and the reconciliation process. And as a\r\nregion we are convinced that we must work together\r\ntowards achieving the goals agreed upon. It is also the\r\nresponsibility of the international community to act in\r\na strong and decisive manner to assist Somalia.\r\nIn the first place, the international community\r\nmust provide the necessary financial and political\r\nsupport to rapidly enable the new Government to create\r\nthe conditions for achieving the rehabilitation of\r\nfacilities needed to house the new Government; the\r\nprovision of direct budgetary support to pay wages and\r\nother administrative expenditures; and the tackling of\r\nsecurity issues head-on, in particular, with the\r\nimplementation of demobilization, disarmament and\r\nreintegration programmes (DDR).\r\nIn this first six-month critical phase, the actions\r\nundertaken by the new Government will determine the\r\nauthority of its legitimacy as it proceeds to consolidate\r\nthe gains obtained from the reconciliation process, with\r\nthe aim of addressing the formidable expectations of\r\nthe Somali people.\r\nIn the second place, at the political level, it is\r\nassumed that the new Transitional Parliament will be\r\nan all-inclusive body; it will agree to swear in members\r\nof this National Assembly; and all its members will\r\naccept the primacy of the rule of law, responsible\r\nnorms of behaviour, disarmament and demobilization.\r\nAny contrary attitudes, actions or activities that could\r\nundermine the efforts to pacify the country or frustrate\r\nthe effectiveness of the new Government should not be\r\ntolerated or accepted by the region or by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn this respect, the Security Council, the unique\r\nbody entrusted with the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, may be called upon to take\r\nnecessary measures in conformity with the United\r\nNations Charter to apply the following measures in\r\ncase the new State faces a resurgence of obstacles to\r\nthe reconciliation process or restoration of the State.\r\nThese would be the implementation of a list and a\r\nsystematic regime of sanctions directed against those\r\nwho would continue to undermine the Governments\r\npeace efforts.\r\nWe are deeply convinced that this is a unique\r\nopportunity for the international community to finally\r\nresolve the long-lasting conflict in Somalia. We need to\r\nacknowledge the changes that have taken place. The\r\nSomalis are determined, and the region is united. We\r\nshould, at all costs, avoid repetition of the scenario we\r\nhave experienced in the past. Let us seize this\r\nopportunity. Let us, together, help our Somali brothers\r\nand sisters in their quest for peace, stability, and unity.\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nUntil now, innumerable resolutions,\r\ncommitments, initiatives and peace processes to\r\nresolve the long-festering Middle East conflict remain\r\nat best rhetorical. A clear-cut vision of the two-State\r\nsolution  a secure Israel side by side with a viable\r\nPalestinian State  rings hollow in the wake of a large\r\nexpansion of illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories of the West Bank, with the\r\nbuilding of thousands of houses on land confiscated\r\nfrom Palestinian families. All this sounds familiar.\r\nOver the last three-and-a-half decades, we have\r\nwitnessed the blatant confiscation of Palestinian land,\r\nfarmlands and water resources. The daily oppression\r\nand repression of Palestinian victims is beyond\r\ncomprehension. Nevertheless, the Palestinians continue\r\nto struggle against all odds to maintain some\r\nsemblance of civil order.\r\nMaking an already untenable and explosive\r\nsituation even worse, Israel, in defiance of\r\ninternational law and public opinion, has embarked on\r\nbuilding a separation wall, which is penetrating and\r\ndividing Palestinian territory in two, well beyond\r\nIsraels 1967 borders, thus creating facts on the ground.\r\nAnd, as we all know by now, Israels proposed tactical\r\nwithdrawal from Gaza is not a prelude to Palestinian\r\nstatehood. All these violent and deliberate actions have\r\nmade a mockery of the road map, and thus, rendered it\r\nworthless; this is the same fate that met the Oslo\r\nAccords.\r\nAbandoned by the international community, the\r\nPalestinians are struck with indefinite deprivation, a\r\nsense of hopelessness and statelessness. That being the\r\ncase, this Assembly has perhaps the sad duty to\r\npronounce itself incapable of constraining Israel, a\r\nMember State of this Organization, rather than\r\ncontinuing to give false hope to a people that has\r\nalready lost everything.\r\nDjibouti, strategically situated at a crossroad of\r\nthe seas, and serving as a gateway to the growing\r\nAfrican and Middle Eastern markets, has been\r\nfortunate in achieving a period of sustained growth,\r\nstability and improved governance. Many of our\r\nfacilities are presently undergoing considerable\r\nimprovements to respond to, and to take advantage of\r\nthe growing demands. A new modern port is under\r\nconstruction, the first phase being an oil terminal\r\nexpected to be operational by next year, followed by a\r\nmajor container terminal, and finally by an industrial\r\nfree zone that will be the first of its kind in Africa,\r\noffering light manufacturing and value-added facilities\r\nand services in a duty-free setting, including\r\nwarehousing, storage and distribution.\r\nIn this respect, we wish to express deep gratitude\r\nto the inspiring and pragmatic leadership of Dubai, our\r\nkey partner in this visionary venture, that will\r\nundoubtedly put Djibouti on the map of international\r\ntrade and shipping.\r\nDjibouti seeks to improve its private sector\r\ndevelopment by reducing the cost of creating or doing\r\nbusiness, by improving its labour force through\r\ninvestments in education, training, health, social\r\nprotection and eliminating gender disparities. The\r\nGovernment is also working to strengthen institutional\r\ncapacity and governance, while developing its\r\nabsorptive capacity to better manage, as well as\r\neffectively utilize, donor support.\r\nThe Horn of Africa has seen its share of conflict\r\nand natural disasters. Together with our friends in the\r\nregion, we are resolutely engaged in mitigating the\r\nplight of our people, reducing tensions and conflict,\r\ndeveloping cooperation in the areas of transport,\r\ncommunications, health and the environment. Regional\r\nand international security issues and, in particular, the\r\nfight against terrorism, are of primary concern to the\r\ncountries in the Horn of Africa. Together with our\r\ninternational partners, we are doing all we can in the\r\nfight against that scourge. The same holds true for the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, tuberculosis and malaria. Our\r\nregion has no other alternative than to strengthen\r\ncooperation in all areas  from economic development\r\nto improving confidence-building measures.\r\nDjibouti, friend to all, enemy of none, will spare\r\nno effort to further intensify the search for greater\r\nregional harmony and cooperation, while promoting a\r\npluralistic, open, and healthy society at home.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of Djibouti for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Ismail Omar Guelleh, President of the\r\nRepublic of Djibouti, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nAddress by Mr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos, President of\r\nthe Republic of Paraguay\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay.\r\nMr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos, President of the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Nicanor Duarte\r\nFrutos, President of the Republic of Paraguay, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Duarte Frutos (spoke in Spanish):\r\nToday our continent is experiencing a time of great\r\nopportunity, yet it is also beset by serious threats,\r\nincluding a falling standard of living for the masses,\r\nradical adjustment measures, the globalization of\r\nfinancial capital and a lack of access to markets in\r\ndeveloped countries  all of which have not\r\ncontributed to generating sustained economic growth,\r\nand even less to reducing poverty and inequality. The\r\ngreat challenge before us is to redouble our efforts\r\ndaily to eradicate this cancer by strengthening public\r\ninstitutions and forging a new social ethic, as well as a\r\nnew international order with multilateral bodies that\r\ntruly contribute to peace throughout the world, human\r\ndevelopment and the sharp reduction of poverty, social\r\ninequalities and the exploitation of man by man and\r\nnation by nation.\r\nThe United Nations, this noble institution, must\r\nnot lose sight of its historic memory, its raison dêtre\r\nand the objectives that led to its creation, if its efforts\r\ncurrently under way are to result in healthy attitude\r\nchanges and a greater political capacity to institute\r\nregulatory frameworks that can put a stop to economic\r\nDarwinism and conflicts throughout the world.\r\nToday, more than ever, the possibility of building\r\na more just world, free from such painful\r\ncontradictions, depends upon the inclusion of the less\r\ndeveloped countries in the globalized economy and the\r\npolitical will to overcome pure market forces. The\r\nindustrialization of the United States, Germany and\r\nJapan in the nineteenth century could be described in\r\nsimilar terms, as could their emergence from their\r\nrelative backwardness compared with Great Britain,\r\nthe pioneer nation of that time.\r\nThe failure throughout almost all of Latin\r\nAmerica to overcome its backwardness, poverty and\r\ndependency is frequently due to selfishness and\r\nhistoric impediments to advantageous connections\r\nbetween our national economies and the worldwide\r\nmarket. If this seems to be a recurrent condition, then\r\nwe should constantly keep in mind the message of the\r\nConsensus of Brazil: we must govern globalization if\r\nwe are to turn it into a source of opportunity for all, if\r\nglobalization is not to be what it has become  a force\r\nsynonymous with marginalization, exclusion or\r\nconquest, dependent on markets and cheap labour,\r\nwhich leads to a form of semi-slavery in many\r\ncountries.\r\nI wish to propose to the General Assembly joint\r\naction that can be taken in four areas.\r\nFirst, social investment throughout the continent\r\nmust reach levels that will make it possible to attain\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. To that end, the\r\npoorest countries, which clearly cannot obtain such\r\nlevels of investment, could have recourse to a\r\ncounterpart fund for social equity with soft financing\r\ncoming from international organizations and unilateral\r\ncontributions.\r\nSecondly, we realize that not everything can be\r\nsolved with money. Money, when it is misused,\r\nweakens and corrupts. Accordingly, we must also\r\ncommit ourselves to carrying out the necessary\r\ninstitutional reforms to ensure the proper formulation,\r\nimplementation and assessment of social policies. And\r\nwe must be ready to ensure that access to the\r\naforementioned funds will lead to wide-reaching\r\ninnovations in the management of public\r\nadministration, demonstrable by means of indices on\r\nefficiency and transparency.\r\nThirdly, international organizations must\r\nincreasingly realize that economic and social reform\r\nmust flow from the experience and wisdom of those\r\ncountries themselves, with their own formulas that are\r\nin keeping with their cultural standards and that\r\ninvolve all the representatives of civil society.\r\nFourthly, with growing levels of poverty it is\r\nimpossible to meet the burden of external debt\r\nservicing. There must be a new, realistic policy that\r\nwill put forward rational terms on future payment of\r\ndebt, terms that will make it possible to lay the basis\r\nfor sustained and equitable development, terms which\r\nallow us to meet our commitments without pushing our\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\npeople into irreversible poverty. It is important to place\r\nthe needs of the poor and dispossessed over the\r\nrepayment of the debt.\r\nThat is why we must imaginatively and skilfully\r\ndevise alternative financing mechanisms for the fight\r\nagainst hunger and extreme poverty. That task requires\r\ngreater intellectual resources and technical expertise\r\nand a new and fair financial architecture, not the\r\naccumulation of wealth, worship of the market or the\r\npromotion of globalization that does not allow the just\r\ndistribution of the wealth produced by all of us\r\nthroughout the world. We need a new financial\r\narchitecture that enables us to reduce poverty and to\r\nwork for the stability of the worlds emerging\r\ndemocracies.\r\nOne year ago, my Government inherited a\r\nsituation characterized by economic stagnation,\r\nrecession and spreading poverty and by weak and\r\nunreliable public institutions, resulting in timid social\r\npolicies that could hardly tackle the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nTwo major challenges face my country. First, the\r\nindigenous population  which in Paraguay is not\r\nlarge, totalling no more than 100,000  lacks access to\r\nits most vital needs and faces the disintegration of\r\nmuch of its natural lands owing to the historical rule of\r\nindolent landowners, and most recently to a type of\r\nagrarian modernization that was insensitive to human\r\ndignity.\r\nSecondly, the unconscionable face of extreme\r\npoverty in my country is that of the peasants. Today,\r\ntwo out of three Paraguayans continue to belong to that\r\nsocial sector. Likewise, one of the most significant\r\ncauses of that critical national problem is the very\r\nunjust distribution of land that has existed for many\r\nyears in Paraguay. That is not only an urgent and very\r\nshocking social problem, but also a political and\r\nethical problem that is manifested in a repeated and\r\nincreasingly grave struggle for land.\r\nIn the light of that situation, we propose a State\r\nwith social, fiscal and environmental responsibility:\r\nsocial responsibility in the sense of guaranteeing\r\nhealth, education and basic services and avoiding\r\nconcentration of profit and wealth; fiscal responsibility\r\nto avoid a deficit and chronic indebtedness, which\r\nultimately punish social investment; and environmental\r\nresponsibility to preserve natures reproductive\r\ncapacity and to ensure for future generations the right\r\nto enjoy resources not created by man.\r\nWe also propose the implementation of a national\r\nanti-poverty strategy that will channel the domestic and\r\nexternal resources necessary to meet the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. The national Government has\r\ndefined as a top budget priority an increase in social\r\nspending to resolutely address the problems of poverty,\r\ndestitution and inequality, with the objective of\r\nreaching 40 per cent of the central administrations\r\ntotal public spending for next year, 2005.\r\nFor development, cooperation is not enough;\r\nthere must also be access to markets on preferential\r\nterms, liberalization of the agricultural product markets\r\nand special treatment for the landlocked least\r\ndeveloped countries, such as Paraguay, punished by\r\nhistory and geopolitics, which make our foreign trade\r\nmore expensive and significantly reduce our\r\ncompetitiveness. There needs to be a compensatory\r\nframework to place my country, Paraguay, on an equal\r\nfooting with other nations in terms of international\r\ntrade.\r\nIn the international context, we join in the appeal\r\nfor a more just and humanized international order in\r\nwhich the least developed are not always condemned to\r\ndiscrimination, indifference and backwardness. With\r\nthat objective, we must move towards an inclusive\r\nmultilateralism that will offer equality, rationality and\r\njustice in international relations.\r\nSimilarly  and in keeping with Paraguays\r\nposition on Taiwan in the United Nations  we once\r\nmore reaffirm our conviction that the brotherly\r\nRepublic of China, Taiwan, should become a full-\r\nfledged Member of the Organization, in accordance\r\nwith the principle of universality and with norms of\r\ninternational law.\r\nToday we have heard more of the same things we\r\nhear every year in the Assembly. But we hope that this\r\ntime we can return to our countries and share with our\r\npeoples the news that finally, in New York, the worlds\r\nleaders have taken important steps forward in\r\nalleviating  even if just a little  the pain, sorrow\r\nand hopelessness of the millions of human beings who\r\nlive on Earth. I am confident that God will give us the\r\nwisdom and the strength necessary to lead our\r\ncountries on the path of freedom, peace, development\r\nand justice.\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of Paraguay for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos, President of the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by General Pervez Musharraf, President of\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan.\r\nGeneral Pervez Musharraf, President of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan, was escorted into\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency General Pervez\r\nMusharraf, President of the Islamic Republic of\r\nPakistan, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Musharraf: Allow me at the outset to\r\nexpress to you, Sir, our warm felicitations on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-ninth session. We congratulate Mr. Julian Hunte\r\non his successful stewardship of the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the Assembly. I also reaffirm our deep\r\nappreciation for the wise leadership of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, and his services for the cause\r\nof peace and progress in the world.\r\nA profound transformation is under way in\r\ninternational relations. The dangerous balances of the\r\ncold war have been replaced by the complex and\r\nequally dangerous realities of our world today. It is a\r\nworld marked by intensifying globalization of\r\neconomies, production, trade and information, on one\r\nside; and by terrorist violence, poverty and disease, on\r\nthe other.\r\nThe growing asymmetries in power among States,\r\ndiscrimination in the dispensing of international\r\njustice, repression of peoples legitimate aspirations\r\nand growing socio-economic disparities have\r\nprecipitated new threats to international peace and to\r\ninternational security: the threats of terrorism,\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and\r\nimploding States. The world today sees turmoil and\r\nupheaval everywhere, especially in the third world, and\r\nmore specifically in the Muslim world. Too many\r\nfronts have been opened and too many battle lines have\r\nbeen drawn. The time for closing fronts has come. The\r\nworld today is crying for peace, reconciliation and\r\nreform. Our objective today has to be harmony through\r\nreconciliation and accommodation, globally and\r\nregionally.\r\nTerrorism poses the most urgent threat to many\r\ncountries, including the most powerful States. For\r\nmany of us, the terrorist threat is very close and may be\r\nvery personal. Terrorism threatens Pakistans vital\r\nnational interests and objectives. We have thus\r\nparticipated actively in the unprecedented global\r\ncampaign against it. Pakistan has led the way in that\r\ncampaign. Our counter-terrorist campaign is ongoing.\r\nGlobal cooperation against terrorism has been\r\nhighly successful. Determined and collective action has\r\ncontained and disrupted the violent agendas of the\r\nterrorists. We are winning the battle against terrorists.\r\nHowever, what we are doing is insufficient to win the\r\nultimate war against them. The immediate anti-terrorist\r\nresponse has to be accompanied by a clear long-term\r\nstrategy that strikes at the root of the problem if we are\r\nto ensure final success against this scourge.\r\nI have proposed a two-pronged strategy of\r\nenlightened moderation to overcome terrorism and\r\nprevent a clash of civilizations. The most recent\r\nIslamic Summit, in Malaysia, endorsed that plan,\r\nwhich involves, on the one hand, internal socio-\r\neconomic reform in the Muslim world and, on the\r\nother, active support from the major Powers to ensure\r\npolitical justice and socio-economic revival for all\r\nIslamic peoples. While the Islamic world has taken its\r\nfirst step in the form of nominating a Commission of\r\nEminent Persons to propose measures for a renaissance\r\nin the Muslim world, the major Powers of the West\r\nhave yet to show movement in seriously trying to\r\nresolve internationally recognized disputes affecting\r\nthe Muslim world.\r\nThe industrialized world must support the\r\nendeavour to bring about an Islamic renaissance,\r\nespecially through adequate financial and technical\r\nassistance and larger trade opportunities. More\r\nimportant, justice must be offered to Islamic peoples in\r\nthe form of the resolution of all outstanding\r\ninternational disputes which affect Muslims. There is\r\nno time to lose. Action has to be taken before an iron\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\ncurtain finally descends between the West and the\r\nIslamic world.\r\nThe tragedy of Palestine is an open wound\r\ninflicted on the psyche of every Muslim. It generates\r\nanger and resentment across the Islamic world.\r\nContinued Israeli violence and the Israelis erection of\r\nthe illegal separation wall, usurping more Palestinian\r\nland, as well as suicide attacks by misguided\r\nPalestinians, are frustrating the prospects of peace and\r\nprolonging the agony of the Palestinian people. While\r\nPakistan stands for peace, recognizing the right of\r\nIsrael to exist as also the right of the Palestinians to\r\nhave their own homeland, we can never accept the\r\nusurpation of additional Palestinian land. Israel has no\r\nright to erect its separation wall beyond its 1967\r\nboundaries. Pakistan calls on Israel to withdraw the\r\nwall from all occupied Palestinian lands, taking it back\r\nto the pre-1967 boundaries. We also call on Israel to\r\nstop the daily atrocities against Palestinians. Pakistan\r\nalso appeals to President Yasser Arafat to use his\r\ninfluence to reciprocally halt the intifada and give\r\npeace a chance.\r\nA major responsibility rests with the Quartet, and\r\nin particular with the worlds greatest Power, the\r\nUnited States, to secure a fair and peaceful solution to\r\nthe problem, realizing the vision of two States, Israel\r\nand Palestine, living side by side in peace, harmony\r\nand security. The United States can and must play the\r\nrole of a just broker of peace. Peace must succeed in\r\nthe Middle East; failure is no longer an option.\r\nIt has always been my conviction that Pakistan\r\nand India can resolve all their differences, including\r\nover Jammu and Kashmir, through a sincere dialogue.\r\nThe dangerous confrontation of 2002 and the three\r\nwars prior to that between our two countries have\r\ndemonstrated that there is no military solution to our\r\nproblems. The aspiration to peace enjoys popular\r\nsupport in Pakistan and, I believe, in India as well.\r\nNeither country can achieve its ambition for social and\r\neconomic progress in the absence of peace. We must\r\nachieve peace for the sake of the impoverished people\r\nof South Asia  for their development and prosperity.\r\nAfter several aborted attempts, Pakistan and India\r\nhave been able to initiate confidence-building\r\nmeasures and a composite dialogue this year to address\r\nall outstanding issues. Pakistan has pursued this\r\nprocess with complete sincerity, giving bilateralism a\r\nfinal chance. We feel that the dual channels of\r\nconfidence-building measures and the dialogue process\r\nmust proceed in tandem. We also are firmly committed\r\nto resolving all disputes with India peacefully,\r\nincluding the Kashmir dispute. That issue cannot be\r\nignored. Its resolution cannot be delayed inordinately.\r\nWe desire a resolution for Kashmir which is just and\r\nacceptable to India, Pakistan and the people of\r\nKashmir.\r\nWe also seek strategic stability with India. I am\r\nglad to say that up until now, the normalization process\r\nhas progressed well, in a cordial atmosphere. Now that\r\nthe negotiations are entering the difficult stage of\r\ngrappling with solutions to previously irreconcilable\r\ndisputes, Pakistan hopes that India will show the same\r\nsincerity, flexibility and boldness that Pakistan will\r\ndemonstrate. I look forward to my meeting the day\r\nafter tomorrow with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.\r\nI would like to convey to him that this is the moment\r\nfor peace; we must not allow it to slip away.\r\nIraq has taken a serious turn, to the anguish of the\r\nentire world community. It is imperative that together\r\nwith closing the Palestine and Kashmir fronts, we also\r\nwind down the Iraq confrontation. Pakistan stands for\r\nrestoration of peace and stability in Iraq to ensure its\r\nunity and territorial integrity. That can only be\r\nachieved through handing over governance authority to\r\nthe people of Iraq and allowing them full control over\r\ntheir natural resources. Internal law and order and\r\nsecurity can be best promoted by local Iraqi police and\r\nmilitia, who need to be built up expeditiously.\r\nAt an opportune time, and at the request of the\r\npeople and Government of Iraq, the Muslim world\r\ncould play a role in bringing peace and harmony to this\r\nconflict-torn nation.\r\nThe forthcoming elections in Afghanistan will be\r\nan important landmark in the countrys progress\r\ntowards democracy and stability. Pakistan will do all it\r\ncan to prevent terrorists from using our territory to\r\ndisrupt the Afghan election process. The subsequent\r\nparliamentary elections in April 2005 would also augur\r\nwell for self-governance in Afghanistan. While the\r\npolitical channel is progressing well  and we wish\r\nPresident Karzai all success  the process of building\r\nthe Afghan National Army and reconstruction efforts\r\nneed to be accelerated in order to install durable peace\r\nin Afghanistan.\r\nIn our globalized world, peace and development\r\nare interdependent, now more than ever before. Despite\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\ndynamic growth in some parts of the developing world,\r\neconomic and social disparities are increasing. The rich\r\nare richer; the poor are poorer. Over 2 billion people on\r\nour planet  a quarter of the worlds population \r\nlive in abject poverty, afflicted by hunger, disease and\r\nconflict. Islands of peace and prosperity cannot coexist\r\nfor long within oceans of instability and poverty.\r\nA bold and innovative global strategy is required\r\nto redress the growing inequalities in the world. Good\r\ngovernance is a precondition for development; but the\r\nneed to rectify the glaring inequities and imbalances in\r\nthe international financial and trade systems is equally\r\nessential.\r\nOfficial development assistance can and must be\r\ndoubled. Innovative ways can and must be adopted to\r\ngenerate the financial resources required for\r\ndevelopment. The billions transferred abroad by\r\ncorrupt leaders should be returned to the looted\r\ncountries to finance poverty alleviation, education and\r\nhealth. International investment flows should be\r\nconsciously directed to the poorer developing\r\ncountries, where such funds could unleash the latent\r\npower of the poor for consumption and production.\r\nWe also know by now that trade, and not just aid,\r\nis the way to promote growth and to benefit from\r\nglobalization. However, it has to be made more\r\nequitable. Unfair agricultural subsidies should be\r\neliminated and high and escalating tariffs that\r\ndiscriminate against the products of the poor should be\r\nremoved. Special and differential treatment should be\r\noffered to disadvantaged developing countries. In my\r\nview, we need more than a level playing field; we need\r\na field tilted in favour of the developing countries.\r\nUnless the worlds leaders generate the political\r\nwill required to agree and implement those measures\r\nurgently, the Millennium Development Goals will\r\nremain a mirage.\r\nIn Pakistan, we are well on the way to\r\ntransforming our country into a modern, progressive,\r\ntolerant, democratic, Islamic state, reflecting the vision\r\nof our founding father, Quaid-e-Azam. Democracy has\r\nbeen restored in Pakistan. The people have been\r\nempowered through a revolutionary local government\r\nsystem. Our women have been empowered. However,\r\nlike other developing countries, Pakistan confronts\r\nseveral challenges. But, we are confident of success.\r\nOur governance is good. Our national priorities are\r\nabsolutely clear.\r\nToday, there is welcome resurgence of support for\r\nmultilateralism. This must be a multilateralism based\r\non the principles of the United Nations Charter, a\r\ncooperative and democratic multilateralism. It must\r\nseek just, peaceful and durable solutions to conflicts\r\nand disputes. It must promote a programme for nuclear\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. It must foster\r\nglobal development and global prosperity.\r\nAll our collective aspirations can best be pursued\r\nwithin this world Organization. The United Nations\r\nmust be strengthened and revitalized to respond to the\r\nchallenges of twenty-first century.\r\nThe United Nations Security Council should\r\nbecome more effective, democratic and representative.\r\nThere is no agreement on the aspiration of a few States\r\nto acquire permanent membership in the Security\r\nCouncil. The overwhelming majority of States are\r\nagainst the creation of new centres of privilege. The\r\nCouncil should be enlarged to ensure the representation\r\nof the mostly small and medium States which have\r\njoined the United Nations over the last three decades.\r\nWe have to consider new ideas to craft a consensus on\r\nthe enlargement of the Security Council.\r\nPakistan believes that a new consensus on peace,\r\nsecurity and development, can and should be achieved\r\non the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations next year. The summit meeting\r\nsuggested by the Secretary-General for next year must\r\nlead to a negotiated final document adopted through\r\nconsensus. That historic summit will, I hope, and\r\nPakistan hopes, create a new paradigm to achieve\r\nuniversal peace and prosperity.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nGeneral Pervez Musharraf, President of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan, was escorted from\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nMr. Fayssal Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, President of\r\nthe Republic of Latvia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of\r\nthe Republic of Latvia.\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nMrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, President of the\r\nRepublic of Latvia, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, President of the Republic of\r\nLatvia, and to invite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Vike-Freiberga: I wish I could begin\r\nthis address on a more optimistic note, but since we\r\nlast convened at the General Assembly one year ago,\r\nmany dramatic and disconcerting events have occurred\r\non the world stage. I refer in particular to the\r\nindiscriminate and brutal terrorist attacks on civilians\r\nall over the world: in Russia, Spain, Iraq, Israel, Saudi\r\nArabia, Indonesia and many other countries. I refer to\r\nthe targeting of children and their parents at schools,\r\non buses and on aeroplanes. I refer to the almost daily\r\nbomb blasts on busy city streets, in marketplaces and\r\nin residential apartment buildings. I refer to the sadistic\r\npride and relish with which terrorists have been filming\r\nthe shooting, throat-slashing and decapitation of their\r\nvictims.\r\nThe purposeful torture and killing of civilians is\r\none of the basest forms of human barbarity. It is a\r\ncrime against humanity, along with ethnic cleansing\r\nand genocide. Unfortunately, terrorism is not\r\ndisappearing from the news headlines of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. Instead, it is becoming the principal\r\nmethod of warfare used by disaffected groups seeking\r\nto achieve their political ends and to blackmail national\r\nGovernments. Nothing can justify the use of such\r\nmeans. Any seemingly noble ends can only be\r\ndiscredited by using terrorism to further them.\r\nFrequently, countries facing terrorist attacks have\r\nbeen using vastly superior military capabilities to strike\r\nhard at real or perceived terrorist targets. Too often,\r\nhowever, those strikes have had an undesirable side\r\neffect of their own: the further wounding and killing of\r\ncivilians and the additional destruction of property.\r\nSuch strikes have done nothing to diminish the deep-\r\nseated feelings of resentment of disaffected\r\npopulations. The events of the past few years, and\r\nindeed of the past few decades, point to the stark and\r\nsobering reality that the military option alone has not\r\nbeen effective in rooting out terrorism and that\r\nterrorism has not been an effective means for achieving\r\npolitical aspirations and goals.\r\nSuch never-ending cycles of killing and mounting\r\nmutual hostility will cease once and for all only when\r\nthe parties involved forsake the use of violence. In the\r\nMiddle East, Latvia views the road map for peace as\r\nthe only feasible means of obtaining a cessation of\r\nhostilities between Israelis and Palestinians. My\r\ncountry encourages the interested parties to do their\r\nutmost to de-escalate tensions and resume the peace\r\nprocess.\r\nIn Iraq, the United States-led coalition forces\r\nhave handed over power to an interim Government, but\r\nsecurity problems are hampering the reconstruction of\r\nthe country and threaten the viability of free and fair\r\nelections this coming January. The transition in Iraq\r\nwill require continued international assistance, and I\r\nencourage the United Nations to assume an active role\r\nin that regard.\r\nAfghanistan is due to experience its first ever\r\nelections next month. Latvia hopes that the historic\r\nevent will not be derailed by violent attempts to disrupt\r\nthe democratic process in that country. Latvia is ready\r\nto continue supporting international efforts to provide\r\npeace and security in both Afghanistan and Iraq.\r\nTen years after the human catastrophe in Rwanda,\r\nwe are again confronted with the systematic rape,\r\ntorture and killing of civilians, in the Darfur region of\r\nthe Sudan. Those crimes have occurred on such a wide\r\nscale that they might be classifiable as ethnic cleansing\r\nand genocide. Latvia welcomes the mediation efforts of\r\nthe African Union and encourages all parties involved\r\nto ensure that no further harm comes to the civilians of\r\nthe region. My country supports Security Council\r\nresolution 1564 (2004) of 18 September, which urges\r\nthe Sudanese Government to act decisively to stop the\r\nviolence.\r\nThe United Nations faces the prospect of\r\nestablishing a new peacekeeping mission in Sudan, in\r\naddition to the 17 field operations already on the\r\nground. During the past few months alone, two new\r\nMissions were established, in Burundi and Haiti, while\r\na third was expanded in Côte dIvoire. The United\r\nNations peacekeeping budget for next year may nearly\r\ndouble as a result.\r\nLatvia is deeply committed to the United Nations\r\nand to effective multilateralism as a central element of\r\nUnited Nations activities. Latvia believes that the\r\nUnited Nations must maintain its crucial role in the\r\nmediation of international disputes and that Member\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nStates must summon the collective political will to\r\nsupport the United Nations as a truly credible force for\r\npeace.\r\nThe Security Council has been the principal\r\nforum in which the countries of the world deliberate\r\ntogether on matters of peace and security. Latvia\r\nbelieves that the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nSecurity Council Reform must continue its activities\r\nand come forth with proposals on how to make the\r\nCouncil more representative of todays political and\r\neconomic realities, how to provide the Council with\r\ngreater legitimacy and how to render it more effective.\r\nA serious debate should be continued regarding the\r\nenlargement of the number of permanent and non-\r\npermanent members of the Security Council. Countries\r\nsuch as Japan or Germany can and should play an\r\nincreasingly stronger role in this framework in view of\r\ntheir substantial contribution to United Nations\r\nactivities and commitments.\r\nProposals for enhancing coordination between the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Economic and Social Council\r\nand the Security Council have made little progress.\r\nOverlapping mandates and the duplication of efforts\r\ncontinue to reduce the efficiency of the United Nations.\r\nThe economic and social programmes of the United\r\nNations need to be reformed, as well. For example,\r\nwhy are the issues of the Economic and Social Council\r\nreviewed four times a year, when twice a year might be\r\nsufficient? Combined with the restructuring of the\r\nEconomic and Social Councils functional\r\ncommissions, such a reduction of redundancy in the\r\nreview process could free up vital financial and human\r\nresources for important economic and social\r\ndevelopment programmes in the developing countries\r\nthat need them most.\r\nLatvia recognizes the important role of the United\r\nNations and other international organizations in\r\npromoting worldwide development and reducing\r\npoverty. Having regained its independence only 13\r\nyears ago, Latvia is gradually completing the transition\r\nfrom a receiving to a donor country. We are grateful for\r\nthe valuable assistance that the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) has provided to our\r\ncountry since 1993, and we are pleased that UNDP has\r\nextended its mandate until the end of 2005. Although\r\nthe amount that Latvia is contributing to worldwide\r\ndevelopment assistance is not very large at the\r\nmoment, we are committed to allocating no less than\r\none third of 1 per cent of our gross national product to\r\ndevelopment assistance by 2006, as required of all the\r\nEuropean Unions member States.\r\nLatvias priority areas for development\r\ncooperation centre around the promotion of democratic\r\nand civil societies, economic development,\r\nenvironmental protection and other issues in the\r\ncountries neighbouring the European Union,\r\nparticularly Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Russia,\r\nUkraine and Uzbekistan, to name some of the countries\r\nto which Latvia has already provided bilateral technical\r\nassistance.\r\nLatvia is eager to reduce the divides between the\r\ndeveloped and the developing world. The industrial\r\nsociety into which we were born has been\r\ncharacterized by the heavy machinery and tools that\r\nhave marked human progress over the last two\r\ncenturies. Now this society is evolving into an\r\ninformation and knowledge society, with innovation as\r\nan important engine of growth. Latvia has been\r\nactively involved in the United Nations World Summit\r\non the Information Society (WSIS) and considers it an\r\nhonour to chair the Preparatory Committee of the\r\nsecond phase of the Summit, which will take place in\r\nTunis in November 2005. The WSIS process should be\r\nan integral part of the international communitys efforts\r\nto eradicate poverty as outlined in the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, which will be reviewed\r\nperiodically until 2015.\r\nAlthough the delegations here today come from\r\nmany different backgrounds, practice different faiths\r\nand speak different languages, all of us in this room\r\nshare the same desire to make our world a better,\r\ncleaner, more peaceful and more prosperous place to\r\nlive in. We share a world view on what it means to be a\r\nhuman and on the inherent value of each human life.\r\nThe more we strive to enshrine such values as\r\ntolerance, compassion and mutual respect, the more\r\nhuman and the more humane our societies will become.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Latvia for the statement\r\nshe has just made.\r\nMrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, President of the\r\nRepublic of Latvia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nAddress by Mr. Robert Mugabe, President of the\r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of\r\nthe Republic of Zimbabwe.\r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of\r\nZimbabwe, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency\r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of\r\nZimbabwe, and to invite him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Mugabe: I am delighted to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Ping, a distinguished son of Africa,\r\nupon his election as President of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-ninth session. Indeed, at a time when the\r\ncommunity of nations has committed itself to paying\r\ndue attention to issues that relate to development in\r\nAfrica through support for the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development and other mechanisms, his\r\npresidency gives us the hope and confidence that our\r\nconcerns and aspirations and those of others will\r\nremain high on the agenda of this body. Let me also\r\nexpress our sincere appreciation to his predecessor,\r\nMr. Julian Hunte, for the efficient and exemplary\r\nmanner in which he conducted the business of the fifty-\r\neighth session.\r\nAt the fifty-eighth session, I spoke alongside\r\nothers about the need to reform the United Nations and\r\nits related bodies so as to make them more democratic.\r\nI stressed the perils inherent in the status quo,\r\nparticularly with regard to the dominance of global\r\npolitics by one super-Power and its closest allies.\r\nWhile we welcome the current debate on enhancing the\r\nauthority and role of the United Nations, we wish to\r\nstress the need to address the core issue of the\r\ndemocratization of international governance. Debate on\r\nthe reform of the Security Council has been too long\r\ndrawn out because of attempts calculated to protect\r\nthose whose interests are best served by the status quo.\r\nIronically, it is some of those same forces that,\r\nsince last year, have been raining bombs and hellfire on\r\ninnocent Iraqis purportedly in the name of democracy.\r\nIraq today has become a vast inferno created by blatant\r\nand completely illegal and defiant acts of aggression\r\nby the United States, Britain and their allies, in the full\r\ntrail of which the world has witnessed mass destruction\r\nof both human lives and property, and with them our\r\nhuman rights, values, morality and the norms of\r\ninternational law as enshrined in our Charter. We are\r\nnow being coerced into accepting and believing that a\r\nnew political-cum-religious doctrine has arisen,\r\nnamely, that there is but one political god  George\r\nW. Bush  and that Tony Blair is his prophet. It is the\r\nKoran writ anew in Baghdad.\r\nThe United Nations Charter remains the only and\r\nmost sacred document and proponent of the relations of\r\nour nations. Anything else is political heresy.\r\nWe note that the Secretary-General has placed\r\nbefore the General Assembly the report of the Panel of\r\nEminent Persons on United Nations-Civil Society\r\nRelations. While civil society makes a significant\r\ncontribution to the work of the United Nations, we\r\nhope that any arrangements that will eventually be\r\nagreed upon will recognize that the United Nations\r\nremains an inter-State and intergovernmental body. It is\r\nalso our expectation that the conclusions of the debate\r\nwill recognize the different levels of development of\r\ncivil society in different parts of the world.\r\nAs we prepare for the mid-term review of the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration in\r\nSeptember 2005, it is apparent that many developing\r\ncountries, including my own country, Zimbabwe, may\r\nbe unable to meet the goals and targets set, as our\r\nsubregion of southern Africa has in recent years\r\nexperienced extended and successive periods of\r\ninclement weather, principally droughts, that have\r\nwreaked havoc upon our economies and accordingly\r\ndiminished our capacity to achieve the Millennium\r\nDeclaration targets. The situation, particularly with\r\nregards to the health and education sectors, has also\r\nbeen worsened by the brain drain and the devastating\r\neffects of the HIV and AIDS pandemic.\r\nIn that regard, Zimbabwe welcomes the\r\ncontinuing efforts of this community of nations to find\r\nsolutions to the scourge of HIV and AIDS that has\r\nravaged our peoples and economies. At the national\r\nlevel, we have taken measures, within our limited\r\nmeans, to combat the pandemic. We are also\r\ncoordinating our efforts at the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) level. Regrettably,\r\nwe continue to see an unfortunate and futile tendency\r\nto use assistance in this area as a reward for political\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\ncompliance and malleability, making it unavailable to\r\ncountries whose Governments are deemed\r\ninconvenient. Let it be realized that the pandemic\r\ndoes not respect boundaries and that these self-serving,\r\nselective approaches will have little or no meaningful\r\nresults.\r\nZimbabwe has also had to withstand unprovoked\r\ndeclared and undeclared sanctions, imposed by Britain\r\nand its allies, which are bent on bringing down our\r\nlegitimately elected Government. Mr. Tony Blair, the\r\nBritish Prime Minister, has arrogantly and\r\nunashamedly announced in his Parliament that his\r\nGovernment was working with Zimbabwes opposition\r\nparty to bring about regime change. Once again, the\r\nlawless nature of that man who, along with his\r\nWashington master, believes he is God-ordained to rule\r\nour world, has shown itself. Regime change is the\r\ninalienable right of the Zimbabwean people, who,\r\nthrough their sovereign vote, can make and unmake our\r\nGovernments.\r\nIn any case, we reject completely the assertions\r\nof, and pretence to, democracy by our former colonial\r\nmasters, whose undemocratic regimes we taught the\r\nlesson of one man  or one woman  one vote\r\nthrough our armed liberation struggles.\r\nAs we in Africa look at the situation here in the\r\nUnited States, we are aware of the plight of the black\r\npeople  Afro-Americans  of both yesterday and\r\ntoday and of the semi-slave, half-citizen status that has\r\nbeen their burden. Do the blacks in the United States\r\nhave the same political, social and economic rights and\r\nstatus as their white counterparts? When we will we\r\never have a black  African-American  President of\r\nthe United States? Never, ever. Why?\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to express the\r\nappreciation of my Government and that of the people\r\nof Zimbabwe for the humanitarian assistance we\r\nreceived from the international community during our\r\nperiod of need. Without such support, we would not\r\nhave been able to avert a major catastrophe.\r\nI am pleased to inform you, Sir, that we have, in\r\nspite of the sanctions and evil wishes of Britain and its\r\nallies, now emerged from that difficult phase. We had a\r\nrelatively good agricultural season this year, and our\r\nland reform programme has begun to make a\r\nsignificant contribution towards the turnaround of our\r\neconomy. Despite the partial drought at the beginning\r\nof the season, we have managed this year to realize a\r\ngood harvest  certainly one good enough to ensure\r\nthat we meet our food requirements until the next\r\nseason. We plead with the International Monetary Fund\r\n(IMF) to stop its strange political mouthings, lies and\r\nfabrications about our situation. Our own regional\r\norganizations know the truth about Zimbabwe. We urge\r\nthe IMF to listen to them, and, for once, to be clean.\r\nMy Government is determined to eliminate\r\ncorruption and its corrosive effects on national\r\ndevelopment efforts. After signing the International\r\nConvention against Corruption in November last year,\r\nwe put in place legal and administrative measures that\r\nhave already arrested a growing and deliberate\r\ntendency to circumvent normal business practices,\r\nparticularly in the financial-services sector. We have,\r\nhowever, experienced some setbacks in our efforts, as\r\nsome countries, particularly in the developed West,\r\ncontinue to provide safe havens for fugitive economic\r\nsaboteurs from our country.\r\nIn March next year, Zimbabwe will be holding its\r\nsixth democratic parliamentary elections since\r\nindependence in 1980. Those elections, like others\r\nbefore them, will be conducted in accordance with our\r\nnational laws and the SADC principles and guidelines\r\ngoverning democratic elections, recently adopted by\r\nour subregion. We do not need any lessons from the\r\nNetherlands or its imperialist allies from the European\r\nUnion on this question. Zimbabwe will indeed\r\nwelcome to the elections those observers whose sole\r\nand undivided purpose is to observe the process and\r\nnot to meddle in the politics of the country.\r\nThe fight against international terrorism has\r\nexposed the duplicity and insincerity of erstwhile\r\nleading democracies and human rights monitors with\r\nregard to the question of the observance of human\r\nrights. We have seen established international\r\nconventions thrown to the dogs, and resolutions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and other United Nations bodies on\r\nthis issue have come to naught.\r\nWe are seriously concerned at the fact that the\r\nUnited Nations, the pre-eminent instrument for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\r\nwatched helplessly while Iraq was unlawfully attacked\r\nand plundered by the United States and United\r\nKingdom-led so-called coalition of the willing. Such\r\nbelligerent, gunslinging diplomacy and the illegitimate\r\nterritorial occupation of the State of Iraq are blemishes\r\non the fair-play image of the United Nations.\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nWhile the sadistic scenes from Abu Ghraib\r\nremain vivid in our minds, other places in Iraq, as well\r\nas Guantanamo Bay, have provided useful samples of\r\nthe Western concept of respect for human rights. Let\r\nme say once again that the West should spare us their\r\nlessons on human rights. They do not have the moral\r\nauthority to speak about, let alone parade themselves as\r\ntorch-bearers of, human rights.\r\nZimbabwe remains deeply concerned about the\r\nsituation in the Middle East. We continue to be\r\nrevolted by a situation where the collective decisions\r\nand authority of the United Nations are disregarded\r\nwith impunity on account of big-brother support. We\r\ndemand an immediate lifting of all restrictions illegally\r\nimposed on the Palestinian people, which have seen\r\nPresident Yasser Arafat remain a virtual prisoner of\r\nforeign occupation. We welcome the recent opinion\r\ngiven by the International Court of Justice that found\r\nthe construction of the Israeli wall to be in\r\ncontravention of international law, and the subsequent\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution that demanded an\r\nimmediate halt to that monstrosity.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, the African Union\r\nearlier this year established its own Peace and Security\r\nCouncil to seek and promote African solutions to\r\nAfrican problems. Already, the Council is seized with\r\nthe matter of the crisis in western Sudan. Those efforts\r\nneed the support of the international community.\r\nLet me conclude by assuring Mr. Ping of my\r\ncountrys support as he presides over the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session. I wish also to\r\nreiterate my countrys commitment positively to\r\ncontribute to the fulfilment of the aims and purposes of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Mr. Robert\r\nMugabe, for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of\r\nZimbabwe, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of\r\nthe Republic of Malawi\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of\r\nthe Republic of Malawi.\r\nMr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the\r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency\r\nMr. Bingu wa Mutharika, President of the Republic of\r\nMalawi, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mutharika: I am delighted to be\r\nparticipating, for the first time, in the deliberations of\r\nthe General Assembly as head of State and\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Malawi.\r\nI should like to begin by joining others who have\r\nspoken before me in congratulating Mr. Jean Ping on\r\nhis assumption of the high office of President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I have no\r\ndoubt that his election will provide an opportunity to\r\nincrease global awareness of the enormous challenges\r\nthat Africa and other less developed regions of the\r\nworld are facing. I hope that, through him, the\r\nopportunity for the poor countries to fully participate\r\nin world economic prosperity will be enhanced.\r\nI also wish to avail myself of this opportunity to\r\npay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Julian Robert Hunte,\r\nfor guiding the work of the fifty-eighth session with\r\nadmirable skill and pragmatism.\r\nWe also salute Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, for the dynamic\r\nleadership skills that he continues to display in steering\r\nthe affairs of the Organization.\r\nI have entitled my statement Sharing global\r\nprosperity. I have done so in order to underscore the\r\nfact that one of the most daunting challenges facing the\r\ninternational community today is to achieve a balance\r\nin economic transformation and growth between the\r\nrich and the poor countries so as to eradicate poverty\r\namong the latter.\r\nIn looking at the future of the United Nations, we\r\nneed to take stock of the response to world poverty. I\r\nam aware that several attempts have been made by the\r\ninternational community to alleviate poverty  and the\r\ngoal is still being pursued but the results so far have\r\nbeen dismal. During the past 30 years, for example, the\r\nnumber of least developed countries has risen from 25\r\nto 49. This means that globally, economic growth is in\r\nreverse gear. Among the questions we are asking with\r\nregard to the sharing of global prosperity is this: why\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nare the industrialized countries more prosperous, while\r\nin Africa and the rest of the developing countries\r\npoverty is increasing? In other words, why has\r\nglobalization failed to achieve a more equitable\r\ndistribution of global prosperity?\r\nIn Malawi we have discovered that we need to\r\nseriously transform our economic structures in order to\r\nbegin to provide and produce new wealth. This can be\r\nachieved by transforming the abundant agricultural\r\ncommodities, raw materials and minerals into goods\r\nthat can be traded globally. It is only by creating new\r\nwealth in rural areas that we can effectively eradicate\r\npoverty.\r\nOur major strategy is to gain a share in global\r\nprosperity by transforming Malawi from being an\r\nimporting and consuming country to being a\r\npredominantly producing and exporting country. In\r\nother words, we must begin to position our economy to\r\ntake full advantage of global trade. This will be\r\nachieved through intensive industrial research and the\r\napplication of science and technology to the specific\r\nconditions in my country.\r\nMalawi  as in the case of most African\r\ncountries  is richly endowed with a wide range of\r\nagricultural primary commodities, good soil and water\r\nresources that can enable us to develop viable agro-\r\nprocessing and manufacturing industries. The critical\r\nissue for us in Malawi, therefore, is the creation of new\r\nwealth as the basis for poverty reduction. In order to do\r\nthat, we must encourage significant domestic savings,\r\nas well as inflows of resources, especially foreign\r\ndirect investment.\r\nWe in Malawi estimate that in order to alleviate\r\npoverty, we need to achieve an annual growth rate of at\r\nleast 6 per cent over the next decade. In order to\r\nachieve that, we are determined to create conditions for\r\nsustainable macroeconomic growth through\r\nfundamental policy reforms to improve economic and\r\npolitical governance. We have put in place measures\r\nfor the reform of the public sector, the agricultural\r\nsector and the private sector.\r\nWe are also determined to improve good\r\ngovernance by stamping out corruption. To that end,\r\nwe have adopted a zero-tolerance stance with regard to\r\ncorruption. I am therefore happy to have signed,\r\nyesterday, the United Nations Convention against\r\nCorruption.\r\nMalawi is cognizant of the fact that our national\r\nvision must be fully supported by the international\r\ncommunity. That is why Malawi joins the call for\r\nbetter market access and lower tariff and non-tariff\r\nbarriers to trade in industrialized countries.\r\nMalawi would therefore like to stress the need to\r\nadvance the dialogue in the Doha development agenda.\r\nFor their part, the industrialized nations need to\r\nseriously address the major concerns of the poor\r\neconomies. The challenge for industrialized countries\r\nis therefore to share with the poor countries the\r\nprosperity that comes about through globalization, by\r\nassisting us to stand on our own and to develop\r\nappropriate technologies for transforming our\r\nagricultural raw materials, minerals and other natural\r\nresources into wealth. In Malawi, we believe that a\r\npartner who walks with you side-by-side down the road\r\nis better than one whom you have to carry on your\r\nshoulders. We want to walk with the industrialized\r\nnations; we do not want to be carried on their\r\nshoulders.\r\nSome positive efforts that Malawi welcomes\r\ntowards global equity include the various initiatives\r\ntaken by the Group of Eight countries aimed at\r\naddressing some of the concerns to which I have just\r\nreferred. Among those are the United Kingdoms\r\ndecision to significantly increase its aid and technical\r\nassistance to Africa; the reaffirmation of strong support\r\nfor the New Partnership for Africas Development; the\r\ndecision by the United States Government to extend\r\nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act from 2008 to\r\n2015; and the European Unions Everything But\r\nArms initiative, which seeks to enhance opportunities\r\nfor increased access for African exports into the\r\nEuropean market.\r\nThose initiatives are, indeed, encouraging, and\r\nmy Government fully appreciates them. I wish,\r\nhowever, to appeal for those noble promises and\r\ncommitments to be matched by action. We need proof\r\nthat actions speak louder than words.\r\nThe management of foreign debt is another\r\npositive way in which global prosperity can be shared.\r\nOur concern is that, in spite of numerous initiatives\r\naimed at finding a durable solution to the debt\r\nproblem, the world is nowhere near that solution. My\r\nGovernment is still allocating a significant amount of\r\nour resources to debt-servicing at the expense of\r\ninvestment in infrastructure, production and income\r\n29\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\ngeneration. Such diversion of resources has led, among\r\nother things, to the deepening of poverty and a lack of\r\nsignificant macroeconomic growth.\r\nHowever, Malawi, like other eligible African\r\ncountries, had welcomed arrangements for debt relief\r\nunder the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)\r\nDebt Initiative. But the conditions for reaching the\r\ndecision and completion points are so arduous that\r\nonly a few countries in sub-Saharan Africa have\r\nmanaged to reach the completion stage. We believe that\r\nthe preconditions for the HIPC Initiative are\r\nunrealistic. Surely, less stringent conditionalities would\r\nhave enabled more countries to succeed.\r\nThat notwithstanding, Malawi welcomes the\r\nmeasures by some bilateral donors to respond to the\r\nexternal debt crisis. In particular, I must mention the\r\nGovernment of Japan, which, a few weeks ago,\r\ncancelled a debt Malawi owed it, amounting to $256\r\nmillion. I take this opportunity to thank Japan most\r\nsincerely for that gesture. We hope that other\r\nindustrialized countries will follow this example.\r\nI referred earlier to the need for adequate donor\r\nsupport to sustain national initiatives. In that regard, I\r\nbelieve that the New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) provides a framework for\r\nsharing the responsibility for economic development\r\nbetween Africa and the rich countries. It is for that\r\nreason that Malawi has acceded to NEPADs African\r\nPeer Review Mechanism in a bid to put in place\r\ninternationally accepted political and economic good\r\ngovernance. Our accession to the African Peer Review\r\nMechanism is also a demonstration of our confidence\r\nin the NEPAD programme as a tool to enhance Africas\r\neffective participation in global prosperity.\r\nLet me now turn to a global challenge that\r\nthreatens all development efforts. This is the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic. The HIV/AIDS pandemic\r\ncontinues to pound incessantly upon the African\r\neconomies, destroying the capacity of many countries\r\nto achieve sustainable economic development. Because\r\nit affects the most productive segment of our labour\r\nforce, we are losing more qualified and experienced\r\npersonnel much faster than we can train new ones.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic is a human tragedy of\r\nunimaginable proportions. Experience in dealing with\r\nthis disaster in my country has taught us that\r\nHIV/AIDS is a medical crisis, an economic crisis, a\r\nsocial crisis and a political crisis. It is a medical crisis\r\nbecause no cure has yet been found for HIV/AIDS. It is\r\nan economic crisis because it is depleting financial and\r\nhuman resources for development while also\r\ndevastating our national capacities for good\r\ngovernance. HIV/AIDS is a social crisis because of the\r\nstigma that makes the affected unable to be integrated\r\ninto normal day-to-day relations as well as in the work\r\nplaces. HIV/AIDS has also created a large number of\r\norphans that need to be cared for. HIV/AIDS is a\r\npolitical crisis because it threatens democratic\r\ninstitutions by killing politicians and others who are\r\nthe voice of the people.\r\nTherefore, in order to deal with this pandemic,\r\nwe have learned the imperative of adopting a holistic\r\napproach. It is for that reason that we appeal to the\r\nUnited Nations to collectively raise new awareness,\r\nnew assumptions and new solutions. To that end, the\r\nUnited Nations ought to redesign its policy in\r\nproviding support, care, treatment and prevention of\r\nHIV/AIDS, alongside the provision of adequate,\r\nnutritious food and a proper diet.\r\nBefore concluding my statement, I wish to raise\r\nanother concern I have concerning the efforts towards\r\nsustainable growth and the development of the world.\r\nThis relates to the need for world peace. One can\r\nhardly emphasize enough that, without global peace,\r\nthere cannot be global prosperity. In that regard, I\r\nwould like to welcome the efforts made by the\r\nSecretary-General, jointly with the Security Council, in\r\ntaking a number of decisive steps towards conflict\r\nprevention, resolution and management around the\r\nglobe.\r\nTurning to the specific issues of peace in Africa, I\r\nam concerned that sub-Saharan Africa has been and\r\ncontinues to be one of the most unstable and conflict-\r\nprone regions of the globe. The region also happens to\r\nbe home to most of the worlds poorest people, who are\r\nliving below the international poverty line.\r\nThe conflict in Sudans Darfur region, in\r\nparticular, is yet another sad chapter in the history of\r\nsub-Saharan Africa and one that the African people can\r\nill afford. Africa and the international community must\r\nfind quick and lasting solutions to the crisis in the\r\nDarfur region.\r\nI would like to conclude my statement by\r\nassuring the General Assembly that my Government\r\nfully endorses the proposals to reform the United\r\nNations. We share the belief that a more representative\r\n30\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nand democratic United Nations will enhance the\r\nefficiency and credibility of this global Organization. It\r\nwill also enhance the efforts towards a just and more\r\nequitable sharing of global prosperity.\r\nMay God bless the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Malawi for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the\r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Right Honourable Paul Martin,\r\nPrime Minister of Canada\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime\r\nMinister of Canada.\r\nMr. Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I have\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency The Right\r\nHonourable Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada,\r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Martin (Canada): I want to talk today about\r\nUnited Nations reform, particularly about the way we\r\nshould serve and the way we should do business if the\r\nUnited Nations is to play the role we want it to in the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe world is organized into independent States\r\nand the primary obligation of Governments is to look\r\nafter their own people. This presents us with a\r\nfundamental dilemma, for unless we also act\r\ncollectively on the basis of our common humanity, the\r\nrich will become richer, the poor will become poorer,\r\nand hundreds of millions of people will be at risk.\r\nThus, we need institutions whose primary obligation is\r\nto our common humanity. Herein lies the importance of\r\nthe United Nations. It comprises Member States, but its\r\nmission is, indeed, to serve the worlds peoples. Its\r\nCharter makes this very clear:\r\nWe the peoples of the United Nations [are]\r\ndetermined  to reaffirm faith in fundamental\r\nhuman rights, in the dignity and worth of the\r\nhuman person, in the equal rights of men and\r\nwomen.\r\nOthers, quite properly, will talk about structural\r\nreform. But today I want to talk about reforms\r\ndesigned to put our common humanity at the centre of\r\nthe agenda of the United Nations.\r\nCanada sees five areas where bold steps are\r\nrequired. The first area is the responsibility to\r\nprotect  the need to develop the rules and the\r\npolitical will that would allow the international\r\ncommunity to intervene in countries to prevent a\r\nhumanitarian catastrophe.\r\nDarfur is a human tragedy of immense\r\nproportions.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWe welcome the Security Councils support for\r\nexpanded engagement there, although we believe the\r\ninternational response should be more robust. The\r\nAfrican Union, which has agreed to lead that effort,\r\nmust have the unswerving support of the international\r\ncommunity. Canada is offering $20 million to assist,\r\nand we call on others to join in now.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIt is good that the international community is\r\nfinally moving, but it has taken far too long. The\r\nSecurity Council has been bogged down in debating\r\nthe issue. It has looked at whether Darfur is a threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. It is considering\r\nwhether the tragedy qualifies as genocide, because\r\neither could provide justification, under international\r\nlaw, for intervention. The fact is, though, that, while\r\nthe international community struggles with definitions,\r\nthe people of Darfur struggle with disaster. They are\r\nhungry, they are homeless, they are sick, and many\r\nhave been driven out of their own country. Tens of\r\nthousands have been murdered, raped and assaulted.\r\nWar crimes and crimes against humanity are being\r\ncommitted.\r\nWe must not let debates about definitions become\r\nobstacles to action. We should not have to go through\r\nsuch painful exercises to figure out how to respond to\r\nhumanitarian catastrophe. We need clear principles that\r\n31\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nwill allow the international community to intervene\r\nmuch faster in situations like the one in Darfur.\r\nOur common humanity should be a powerful\r\nenough argument, and yet that is precisely what is\r\nmissing. Put simply, there is still no explicit provision\r\nin international law for intervention on humanitarian\r\ngrounds. The responsibility to protect is intended to\r\nfill that gap. It says that we should have the legal right\r\nto intervene in a country on the grounds of\r\nhumanitarian emergency alone. We should be able to\r\ndo so when the Government of a country is unwilling\r\nor unable to protect its people from extreme harm as a\r\nresult of internal war, repression or, simply, State\r\nfailure.\r\nThe primary responsibility for the protection of a\r\nStates own population lies with that State itself. We\r\nare not arguing for a unilateral right to intervene in one\r\ncountry whenever another country feels like it. It is\r\nalways preferable to have multilateral authority for\r\nintervention in the affairs of a sovereign State. What\r\nwe seek is the evolution of international law and\r\npractice so that multilateral action may be taken in\r\nsituations of extreme humanitarian emergency.\r\nInternational law is moving in the right direction.\r\nExisting instruments such as the Convention on\r\nGenocide and human rights treaties acknowledge\r\nStates obligations to their own people. The\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court and\r\ncriminal tribunals are further steps forward. Thus\r\ncustomary international law is evolving to provide a\r\nsolid basis in the building of a normative framework\r\nfor collective humanitarian intervention. To speed it\r\nalong, however, Member States should now adopt a\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution recognizing the evolution\r\nof sovereignty to encompass the international\r\nresponsibility to people. In turn, the Security Council\r\nshould establish new thresholds for when the\r\ninternational community judges that civilian\r\npopulations face extreme threats; and for exploring\r\nnon-military and, if necessary, proportionate military\r\noptions to protect civilians. The responsibility to\r\nprotect is not a license for intervention; it is an\r\ninternational guarantor of political accountability.\r\nThe second area I would speak to is the\r\nresponsibility to deny, which encompasses the need\r\nto ensure that weapons of mass destruction do not\r\nunder any circumstances spread to States or terrorists\r\nprepared to use them, especially against innocent\r\ncivilians. Non-proliferation and disarmament remain\r\nfundamental pillars of the commitment of the United\r\nNations to international peace and security.\r\nIn both cases, multilateralism has been\r\nchallenged by dramatic changes in the security climate,\r\nand there is a clear need to make our systems stronger\r\nand more responsive. Strict verification is the key.\r\nThe United Nations nuclear watchdog, the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, needs stronger\r\ntools, and it needs political support. We need more\r\nrigorous controls on sensitive nuclear technology, and\r\nthe Security Council must be prepared to deal with\r\nnon-compliance effectively. The fact is that, as we all\r\nknow, determined proliferators have been able to\r\ncircumvent their treaty obligations. The United Nations\r\nshould establish a permanent inspection and\r\nverification mechanism that can reinforce and\r\nsupplement existing verification systems.\r\nMore generally, and to show how far we have to\r\ngo on the disarmament agenda, and on the\r\nresponsibility to deny, the Conference on\r\nDisarmament, charged with the responsibility for\r\nnegotiating new multilateral instruments, has not even\r\nbeen able to agree on a work plan since 1998. Surely\r\nthe Conference must get back to productive work.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe third area is the responsibility to respect\r\nhuman beings, their dignity, their freedom and their\r\nculture. I would like to talk about a broader notion of\r\nhuman rights - one that can encompass individual\r\nrights, the protection of collective rights and pluralism,\r\nas reflected in the concept of cultural diversity. In fact,\r\nthe United Nations Development Programmes recent\r\nHuman Development Report stresses that cultural\r\ndiversity is also tied in with freedom. That is why we\r\nsupport a United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization instrument on cultural\r\npromotion.\r\nSince the United Nations Charter and the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, humanity has\r\nmade remarkable strides in the area of human rights.\r\nConventions are now in place to protect a number of\r\nrights: civil, political, economic, social and cultural.\r\nBut we must remain vigilant in the face of new forms\r\nof abuse, such as international trafficking of people and\r\nthe horrifying child sex trade.\r\n32\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nIn addition to the protections afforded individual\r\nrights, various conventions have also been concluded\r\nto better protect minorities, to denounce racial\r\ndiscrimination and to combat marginalization.\r\nNevertheless, it is apparent that the most divisive\r\nconflicts result, more often than not, from attempts by\r\none group to prevent other groups from realizing their\r\nperfectly legitimate economic, religious, social or\r\npolitical aspirations. Entire communities are\r\nthreatened. Violence, civil strife and even failed States\r\nensue. Kosovo, Bosnia, the Great Lakes region in\r\nAfrica, and today Darfur are the most chilling\r\nexamples. The international community must take\r\nvigorous action to protect individuals as well as\r\nminority communities. It is not enough to simply\r\npossess various legal instruments; they must be put\r\ninto practice. Institutions responsible for human rights\r\nmust reveal to the entire world those guilty of abuse \r\nbe they armed groups, communities or Governments \r\nand take the necessary measures. The United Nations is\r\nour moral conscience and it is up to us to act.\r\nThe fourth area is the responsibility to build. The\r\nobjectives of the Millennium Summit on poverty,\r\ndisease and global insecurity will come to naught if we\r\ndo not follow up on the Monterrey Consensus,\r\naccording to which genuine development requires a\r\nholistic approach to such issues as debt, market access\r\nand social investment.\r\nThat being said, as we have seen in Haiti over the\r\npast 10 years, all the aid in the world will have only a\r\nfleeting effect if a country does not have functioning\r\npublic institutions. We must build countries\r\ngovernance capacities and take the time to do it right.\r\nThe same is true for economic institutions. Those that\r\nwork well marshal the creative energies of local\r\nentrepreneurs. That is the message of the United\r\nNations Commission on the Private Sector and\r\nDevelopment: a thriving economy is the product of\r\ncitizens trust in their countrys public institutions. In\r\nbrief, development depends on governance.\r\nLastly, there is responsibility for the future,\r\nwhich is to say the obligation we have to leave a better\r\nworld for our children. That is no small challenge. It\r\ninvolves all aspects of our common heritage: health,\r\nthe environment, oceans, space. The new pandemics\r\ndemand our most urgent attention. AIDS, SARS and\r\nthe Ebola virus are sounding a terrifying alarm, but\r\nscientists are predicting even worse diseases. The\r\nWorld Health Organization must bolster its\r\nsurveillance systems. It must do a better job\r\ncoordinating its actions with those of other United\r\nNations bodies.\r\nBeyond health issues lies the whole question of\r\nmanaging our environment. It is gravely threatened.\r\nOnly international cooperation and technical assistance\r\ncan bring lasting solutions to such problems as access\r\nto clean air and water. Furthermore, we need an oceans\r\npolicy that allows us to rebuild our fish stocks. Access\r\nto fisheries must be better regulated under international\r\nlaw. Simply put, the pillage of those global resources\r\nmust stop.\r\nSpace is our final frontier. It has always captured\r\nour imagination. What a tragedy it would be if space\r\nbecame one big weapons arsenal and the scene of a\r\nnew arms race. In 1967, the United Nations agreed that\r\nweapons of mass destruction must not be based in\r\nspace. The time has come to extend that ban to all\r\nweapons.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI have talked today about responsibilities. In\r\nconclusion, let me mention one more: the\r\nresponsibility to act. We await the report of the\r\nSecretary-Generals High-Level Panel and we\r\nanticipate substantial recommendations for reform.\r\nMany countries are focused on the Security Council\r\nand we should support reforms that will make it more\r\neffective and will permit those countries which actively\r\nsupport United Nations peacekeeping, development\r\nand other activities to continue to have a meaningful\r\nopportunity to serve.\r\nBut we must also look forward to\r\nrecommendations that go well beyond the Security\r\nCouncil. For example, there is a need to set out\r\nmeasures to facilitate an integrated response to the\r\ndiverse range of security challenges that each of us\r\nfaces, from the proliferation of terrorism to improving\r\nUnited Nations coordination on development, health\r\nand the environment. As individual countries, as\r\nindividual members of regional organizations, and as\r\nparticipants in various international groups that form\r\naround specific interests, we all must act to bridge the\r\ndifferences that divide us and to forge an international\r\nconsensus for reform of the United Nations.\r\nIn another context, for instance, Canada has\r\nproposed a special meeting at which leaders from 20 or\r\nso countries in the developed and developing worlds\r\n33\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\nwould get together to discuss our collective challenges\r\nand responsibilities. This could very well include\r\nproviding a major boost to United Nations reform\r\nefforts.\r\nIn any event, no matter how one comes at it, the\r\ntime has come for real reform of the United Nations.\r\nAll of us in this Hall and in our respective\r\nGovernments must put aside narrow interests and work\r\nto common purpose to strengthen this universal\r\ninstitution, whose activities give force to our common\r\nhumanity.\r\nFour years ago, at the Millennium Summit, the\r\nleaders of the world agreed that we have a duty  to\r\nall the worlds people, especially the most vulnerable\r\n(resolution 55/2, para. 2). That duty will not be\r\ndischarged unless we as Governments speak to the\r\ndignity and to the freedom of every human being on\r\nEarth, here at the worlds meeting place of nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPrime Minister of Canada for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nThe Honourable Paul Martin, Prime Minister of\r\nCanada, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Issam Fares, Deputy Prime\r\nMinister of Lebanon.\r\nMr. Fares (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): As the\r\nhead of Lebanons delegation to the General Assembly,\r\nI am pleased to congratulate Mr. Ping on his election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession. I wish him success in his presidency. I also\r\nwant to acclaim the special relationship that my\r\ncountry has with his and to express our gratitude for\r\nthe support which his country, Gabon, gives to our\r\nlarge Lebanese community working there and enjoying\r\nits hospitality.\r\nI also wish to thank his predecessor, Mr. Julian\r\nHunte, for his effective leadership as President of the\r\nAssembly at the fifty-eighth session.\r\nSecretary-General Annan has earned our respect\r\nand appreciation for the efforts he has made to further\r\nthe United Nations goal of working for a just, secure\r\nand peaceful world.\r\nIn past years, we in Lebanon used to come to this\r\nforum seeking United Nations help. The United\r\nNations has always come to our support, adopting\r\nresolutions affirming Lebanons independence,\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. We must express\r\nour gratitude to the United Nations for dispatching the\r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, stationed on\r\nour frontiers with Israel, and for the continuing and\r\neffective aid we get from the Organizations\r\nspecialized agencies.\r\nToday, we come to this forum with a different\r\nobjective. Our country is in good shape. It has regained\r\nits position in the region. We have moved from\r\ndestruction to construction, from rule by the militias to\r\nthe rule of law, from anarchy to stability and security,\r\nand from division to unity. In the 1970s and 1980s,\r\nLebanonization became a bad word. It stood for\r\nanarchy and infighting. Now, however,\r\nLebanonization has regained its true, original\r\nmeaning as a term standing for democracy, freedom,\r\npluralism and recognition of the other.\r\nEarly this month, the Security Council adopted its\r\nresolution 1559 (2004), concerning Lebanon. The\r\nresolution has two dimensions, one regional, the other\r\ninternal. As for the regional dimension, the resolution\r\ncalls for the withdrawal of all foreign forces still in\r\nLebanon. There are Israeli forces occupying part of\r\nLebanon: the Shebaa farms and the surrounding area.\r\nTogether with the rest of the Assembly, we call for the\r\nimmediate withdrawal of those forces. From this\r\nrostrum, we also call upon Israel to halt its daily\r\nviolations of our airspace.\r\nThere are also Syrian forces in Lebanon. Those\r\nforces are on our territory at the request of the\r\nLebanese Government and in accordance with\r\nagreements signed by the two parties. Lebanon will\r\naccept the presence of those troops as long as the\r\nsecurity situation in the region merits it. It is Lebanons\r\npolicy that not a single non-Lebanese soldier should\r\nremain on its soil. Our disagreement with the United\r\nNations concerning the withdrawal of Syrian forces\r\nlies in the timing of the withdrawal; it is not a\r\ndisagreement on the principle of withdrawal. The\r\ntiming is under continuous discussion between the\r\nLebanese and Syrian Governments; it will depend on\r\ntheir assessment of the security situation in the region.\r\nIt is also the policy of Lebanon to support the national\r\nresistance movement, which played an important role\r\nin forcing Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon.\r\nAs for the Councils resolutions internal\r\ndimension  relating to the amendment of our\r\nConstitution  we consider it an unacceptable\r\nintervention in our internal affairs. Our Constitution,\r\nwhich was promulgated in 1926, may be the oldest\r\n34\r\nA/59/PV.5\r\ndemocratic constitution in the entire Middle East.\r\nSuccessive Lebanese Parliaments have amended it\r\nmany times, always in accordance with its own\r\namendment mechanisms and by absolute majorities.\r\nLebanon is a civilized democratic country. It\r\nabides by international law and reveres the moral\r\nprinciples and values on which it is based. My country\r\nwas a founding Member of the United Nations in 1945.\r\nIt played a leading role in the formulation of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. And,\r\nfrom this rostrum, Lebanon has exposed and opposed\r\nall destructive and disruptive ideologies and\r\nmovements that we felt impeded the course of\r\ncivilization and the future of humanity.\r\nToday, we stand together with the United Nations\r\nin opposing international terrorism in all its forms.\r\nLebanon has witnessed the horrors of terrorism on its\r\nsoil; it has witnessed innocent people being kidnapped,\r\ntortured and killed. It knows what terrorism is all\r\nabout, and, as a result of first-hand knowledge, it\r\ncondemns it in the strongest terms. We also condemn\r\nthose who wilfully confuse terrorism with the struggle\r\nfor national liberation and independence. There are\r\nthose who exploit the universal revulsion against\r\nterrorism to smear national liberation movements by\r\nbranding them as terrorist. National liberation is a right\r\nand an honour; terrorism is a crime and cowardice.\r\nLebanon has recovered its stability and freedom.\r\nWe are not here to ask anything specific for ourselves.\r\nWe do, however, ask that the United Nations devote\r\nmore attention to our region. The region is in turmoil,\r\nand it looks to the United Nations to help establish\r\npeace. The Organization has been granted legitimacy\r\nby all nations in its quest to ensure peace and stability.\r\nWe ask the following of the United Nations. First,\r\nthe Organization should increase its efforts to solve the\r\nMiddle East problem. It should do so by implementing\r\nits resolutions concerning Israels withdrawal from the\r\nterritories it occupied in 1967, by giving the\r\nPalestinians an independent sovereign State and by\r\nensuring the return of Palestinian refugees to their\r\nhomeland. The more the Middle East conflict is\r\nallowed to fester, the more difficult it will be to resolve\r\nand the more danger and war there will be in the\r\nregion.\r\nSecondly, the United Nations should assume\r\ngreater responsibility in resolving the violent conflict\r\nin Iraq and in restoring peace, stability and unity to the\r\nIraqis. The Iraqis have suffered greatly, and they\r\ndeserve strong and continuing support from the United\r\nNations so that they can build a free, just and\r\ndemocratic order.\r\nThirdly, the Organization should help the Middle\r\nEast region to achieve a new stable order based on just\r\nand equitable solutions and on the right to self-\r\ndetermination, since that region is the birthplace of the\r\nthree monotheistic religions. The United Nations\r\nshould also put an end to the arms race and to the\r\nwaste of capabilities and rid the region of weapons of\r\nmass destruction.\r\nFourthly, the United Nations should encourage\r\nthe establishment of civil organizations as a necessary\r\nfirst step in the process of reform and democratization.\r\nIt is difficult to build an accountable democratic\r\nsystem without diverse and pluralistic civil institutions.\r\nDemocracy is based on political parties, trade unions,\r\ncivil institutions, humanitarian organizations and\r\nassociations of all kinds, which are the foundations of\r\nreform and democracy.\r\nLebanon has a clear vision about the future of the\r\nregion and of its civilization. It wants to play a decisive\r\nrole in that future, as it did in forging an Eastern\r\ncivilization in the region, based on the most profound\r\nprinciples of Christianity and Islam.\r\nLebanon is an international country, bigger than\r\nits size and population, due to its emigrants, who\r\ninhabit every nook and cranny of the world. Wherever\r\nthey may be, the Lebanese are emissaries of innovation\r\nand production. Some countries may take pride in\r\nexporting weapons and in deploying armies, but\r\nLebanon, since the dawn of history, has prided itself on\r\nexporting its precious young people, who, in all\r\ncontinents, assume the highest posts in universities,\r\nresearch centres, industries and businesses.\r\nLebanon supports the United Nations because of\r\nits universal views on humanity and its future. In the\r\npast, my country may have suffered precisely because\r\nof its universalism, its openness and its freedom.\r\nBecause Lebanon has given much, Lebanon deserves\r\nmuch.\r\nFinally, I wish the General Assembly and its\r\nMain Committees every success in addressing the\r\nmany important items on the agenda. Lebanon will\r\nparticipate actively in all these proceedings, in any way\r\nthat will help to attain the objectives of the United\r\nNations and advance the universal cause of freedom\r\nand peace.\r\nThe meeting rose at 2.05 p.m.\r\n"
