(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ion Iliescu, President of Romania\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of Romania.\r\nMr. Ion Iliescu, President of Romania, was\r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Ion Iliescu,\r\nPresident of Romania, and to invite him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nPresident Iliescu (spoke in French): Allow me at\r\nthe outset to join others who have warmly\r\ncongratulated you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at this session. I\r\nwish you every success in your important undertaking,\r\nwhich will enjoy the full support of the Romanian\r\ndelegation.\r\nFor some years now, this great worldwide\r\ngathering has opened in the wake of deadly terrorist\r\nattacks that require us to respond as one to voice strong\r\ncondemnation of all terrorist acts and a commitment to\r\ncontributing ever more energetically to the affirmation\r\nof effective multilateralism that will make global\r\naction increasingly effectual.\r\nIn that context, I cannot fail briefly to address the\r\nissue of the struggle against terrorism, which is more\r\nurgent today than ever before. Since September 2001,\r\nthe level of violence of acts of terrorism — perpetrated\r\nin the name of ideological, territorial, religious or\r\nethnic differences and incompatibilities — has risen\r\ndramatically.\r\nAt the same time, the very nature of terrorist acts\r\nhas changed. The complexity and scale of such\r\nbarbarism, claiming the lives of hundreds or even\r\nthousands of innocent victims — often children, as in\r\nthe recent incident in Beslan — are indescribably grim\r\nand represent immense challenges. Yet another factor\r\nis at play in all this: the increase in the number of\r\nterrorist acts. In such conditions, the struggle against\r\nthat scourge — whose implications are not only\r\nimmediate, but also complex and global in nature — is\r\nan urgent and ongoing obligation for all States.\r\nRomania promptly and meaningfully joined the\r\nanti-terrorism campaign and has demonstrated its\r\nresolve to contribute to eradicating it. We believe,\r\nhowever, that the struggle to end terrorism must also\r\naddress its underlying causes, including poverty, and\r\nmust not be used as a pretext for flouting or violating\r\nhuman rights. If that were to occur, we would be\r\nplaying into the hands of the perpetrators of terrorist\r\nacts, who not only seek loss of life and devastation, but\r\nstrive above all to destroy symbols and values. On the\r\nother hand, promoting respect for human rights and\r\ndemocratic values is the only way to eliminate such\r\nmanifestations of hatred and violence.\r\nThe nature and, above all, the inherent dangers of\r\nthe current international context make the development\r\nof cooperation among all kinds of international actors,\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nState and non-State alike, increasingly urgent. As an\r\nOrganization that is universal by vocation and in\r\nlegitimacy, the United Nations must fully assume its\r\nrole as the driving force behind efforts to adapt to\r\nchanges in the international environment. In an\r\ninterdependent world, no single State is safe from such\r\ndangers or from threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity, including terrorism, the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, the increasing number of\r\nStates affected by instability, the growth of global\r\ndisparities, humanitarian crises, ethnic wars and intra-\r\nState wars.\r\nManaging such risks requires a comprehensive\r\nand coherent approach on the part of the United\r\nNations, including through the promotion of preventive\r\npolitical and diplomatic measures, such as the\r\nstrengthening of international treaties and conventions\r\non combating terrorism and the non-proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction; efforts to make\r\ninternational export control regimes and specialized\r\ninternational structures more effective; and, in extreme\r\ncases, recourse to coercive measures, in accordance\r\nwith the United Nations Charter.\r\nOur Organization has one strong and complex\r\ntool at its disposal in meeting such challenges. I refer\r\nto the Security Council, in which Romania is striving\r\nto make a real contribution to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and the establishment\r\nof a world climate of stability, with particular emphasis\r\non fighting terrorism, preventing conflicts and\r\nhumanitarian crisis situations, maintaining the unity of\r\nCouncil members and supporting consensus solutions,\r\nand encouraging cooperation on stabilization between\r\nthe United Nations and regional organizations. With\r\nrespect to that last issue, I would note that Romania\r\nhas been and continues to be interested in cooperation\r\nbetween the global Organization and the regional and\r\nsubregional pillars. Given the current international\r\ncontext, that is of major importance.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe need to speed up the reform of the United\r\nNations is more urgent than ever. The series of\r\nchallenges, more or less new, that the Organization has\r\nto face in the twenty-first century make its reform a\r\npriority if its structures and working methods are to\r\nadapt to the present realities. The terms of reference\r\ncontinue to be efficiency, adaptability and progress.\r\nRomania looks forward to the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary-General on the report of the eminent persons\r\nso that we may embrace, together with other States, a\r\ncollective effort that cannot afford delay.\r\nWe hope that the sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nOrganization’s establishment will mark significant\r\nprogress in the process of adapting the United Nations\r\nto the new challenges, and especially the Security\r\nCouncil, the essential body in the management of\r\nworld peace and stability. Our relation to that organ, as\r\na non-permanent member, increases our conviction that\r\na new configuration, closely reflecting current realities\r\nby increasing the number of permanent and non-\r\npermanent seats, will consolidate the representative\r\nprofile of the Security Council and thus its authority\r\nand efficiency.\r\nI cannot ignore another aspect of our\r\ncontemporary world. Both a source of challenges and a\r\nmost generous framework for opportunities, the\r\nphenomenon of globalization is unavoidable and\r\naffects us all. Given its nature, the United Nations is\r\nideally placed to manage the phenomenon, particularly\r\nby correcting its consequences.\r\nIn that context, Romania fully embraces the\r\nGlobal Compact Initiative of our Secretary-General,\r\nwhich needs support and strengthening. All Member\r\nStates must promote regional and transcontinental\r\nintegration as vehicles and instruments of a harnessed\r\nglobalization. In this case, the European Union stands\r\nas a success story, since it acts as a vector not only of\r\neconomic integration, but also of democratic values\r\nand human rights. The United Nations has to try to find\r\nways to adjust the rules of the world market in order to\r\ndiminish, in the medium and long terms, the big gaps\r\nthat exist between the rich countries and the poor.\r\nAnother priority in our efforts to harness\r\nglobalization is the need to enhance coordination\r\namong the specialized agencies and institutions of the\r\nUnited Nations system in their work to ensure the\r\ndiffusion of information technology at a lower cost. We\r\nneed to show more determination in our attempts to\r\ndecrease the gaps in this field, and to guarantee the\r\nevolution of less developed countries from a state of\r\nmarginalization to one catalysed by knowledge-based\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAllow me to turn now to another essential factor\r\nfor a better future, one that Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan also underlined in his introductory speech —\r\nthe rule of law. The validity of the principles of the\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nCharter of the United Nations have not only withstood\r\nthe test of time, but they have also been reaffirmed by\r\na whole new network of international agreements,\r\nmandatory standards and norms of action to which\r\nStates have voluntarily acceded, mechanisms for the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and monitoring\r\ncommitments.\r\nAs a proof of our faith in the international law\r\nsystem, Romania appealed this year for the first time to\r\nthe International Court of Justice — the main judicial\r\nbody of the United Nations — to resolve a question of\r\nmaritime delimitation. Romania also appealed to an\r\ninternational investigation commission to solve the\r\ncase of an infrastructure works project with cross-\r\nborder impact on the Bistroe Channel in the Danube\r\nDelta. Our appeal concerns the need for close\r\ncollaboration in order to protect a unique and fragile\r\nplace, a UNESCO world heritage site.\r\nOur efforts towards an effective multilateralism\r\nalso involve us in other major issues on the United\r\nNations agenda. Romania has promptly joined, and\r\nsubstantially contributed to, international efforts for the\r\nstabilization and reconstruction of Afghanistan and\r\nIraq, in keeping with its long history of participation in\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and the\r\nprovision of assistance in post-conflict phases.\r\nThe global vocation and aspirations of my\r\ncountry are closely related to its European destiny. The\r\nfocus of Romanian diplomacy is therefore oriented\r\ntowards the democratic stabilization of our\r\nneighbouring region and its effective connection to a\r\nunited Europe. For too long that region has been\r\naffected by wars and all kinds of tensions, often acute\r\nones. Under such circumstances, Romania can only\r\nsupport, alongside all of Europe, a boost to democracy,\r\neconomic development and a long-lasting stabilization\r\nof the countries in the region.\r\nAt the same time, Romania is ready to contribute\r\nto the stability and development of all countries in the\r\nBlack Sea region. We hope to turn this strategic area —\r\nwith its close connections to other regions of immense\r\npotential, including the Mediterranean Basin, the\r\nCaucasus, Central Asia and the Middle East — into a\r\ncooperation and security zone.\r\nI cannot conclude without making a brief\r\nreference to another theme to which Romania attaches\r\nparticular importance. My country strongly supports\r\nconcerted action to prevent the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. In an international\r\ncontext that is often volatile and defined by a growing\r\ncomplexity and increased interdependence, we cannot\r\nignore the necessity for immediate action, using the\r\nmeans offered by our global Organization, in particular\r\nthe Security Council Committee established pursuant\r\nto resolution 1540 (2004).\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nRomania for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ion Iliescu, President of Romania, was\r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Enrique Bolaños Geyer, President of\r\nthe Republic of Nicaragua\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Nicaragua.\r\nMr. Enrique Bolaños Geyer, President of the\r\nRepublic of Nicaragua, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Enrique\r\nBolaños Geyer, President of the Republic of Nicaragua,\r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Bolaños Geyer (spoke in Spanish): In\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth century railroads were\r\nbuilt all over the world. Steel at that time was not of\r\nsuch good quality and for that reason wheels\r\nsometimes broke, causing accidents and derailments.\r\nTo avoid those accidents, at every station stop there\r\nwas a brakeman who walked the length of the tracks,\r\nhammer in hand, hammering on the wheels so that any\r\nof the wheels that sounded broken could be changed.\r\nYears passed and the quality of steel improved, but the\r\nbrakemen kept hammering on the wheels, heedless of\r\nthe fact that it was no longer necessary.\r\nThe world changes, and that means that we, too,\r\nneed to change in order to adapt to new circumstances.\r\nSomething similar is happening in the United Nations.\r\nThe Security Council, designed after the Second World\r\nWar to maintain peace in the post-war world, is not the\r\nSecurity Council that the new century of information\r\ntechnology and globalization needs. We must reinvent\r\nthe United Nations.\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nLet us begin by making the reform of the United\r\nNations, on which we have already agreed, effective.\r\nWe have to broaden participation in the Security\r\nCouncil to include other countries, both as permanent\r\nmembers — which at the very least should include\r\nGermany and Japan — and as non-permanent\r\nmembers, in order to allow for more equitable and\r\ndemocratic representation.\r\nOur Organization needs to adapt to the new\r\nchallenges and realities of the present. Development,\r\nfor example, needs a new approach. What concerns us\r\nmost is to ensure that populations and individuals\r\nparticipate more actively in the decisions shaping their\r\nown future. As I said three days ago, in the “Action\r\nAgainst Hunger and Poverty” meeting of world\r\nleaders, development is a responsibility of States, but it\r\nis also the primary responsibility of the individual.\r\nI find the words of Nobel Laureate José\r\nSaramago are appropriate here when he writes:\r\n“As vehemently as we claim our rights, let us\r\nalso lay claim to responsibility for our duties.\r\nPerhaps then the world will become a bit better.”\r\nSo it was a wise thing that our American\r\nDeclaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, signed in\r\nBogotá in 1948, established that equal to, and as a\r\ncounterpart to rights, there are also individual\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nThat includes instilling in the conscience of\r\ncitizens a culture of responsibility. Next to the right to\r\nreceive a State-sponsored education stands the civil\r\nresponsibility to make the most effective use of that\r\neducation and to obtain at least a primary education.\r\nNext to the right of children to have a father and a\r\nmother stands the duty of parents to care for, help,\r\nfeed, educate and shelter their young children.\r\nChildren, for their part, have the responsibility always\r\nto honour their parents, help them, feed them and give\r\nthem shelter when they are in need. Next to the right to\r\nemployment stands the duty to provide efficient\r\nservice. Everyone has the responsibility to work, each\r\naccording to his ability and possibilities, in order to\r\nobtain the resources for survival, thus achieving\r\npersonal progress and social development.\r\nAlong with the right to health goes the\r\nresponsibility to contribute to a healthy and clean\r\nenvironment. With the right to enjoy the benefits of\r\nprogress goes the responsibility to contribute to\r\ndevelopment. With the right to the freedom of\r\nexpression goes the responsibility of tolerating\r\ndiffering opinions. In short, every right has a\r\ncorresponding duty or responsibility.\r\nWith the fall of the Berlin wall, the age in which\r\nthe State was expected to be responsible for everything\r\ncame to a close. Today, we must all participate together\r\nin the search for new paths for our individual\r\ndevelopment and for that of our countries and of all\r\nhumanity.\r\nThe passing of time motivates us to renew our\r\nbasic principles. I therefore propose that we once again\r\nadopt an ethic of development based principally on\r\nindividual responsibility as well as on the\r\nresponsibility of nations.\r\nThe well-being and the development of nations\r\nare the result of individual well-being and the\r\ndevelopment of the people that make up that society.\r\nSocial well-being should not be measured by how\r\nmany people are assisted by social programmes\r\nfinanced from national budgets but by how many\r\npeople leave those programmes because they have\r\nbecome able to manage on their own.\r\nIn his book, Underdevelopment is a State of\r\nMind, Lawrence Harrison defines a negative attitude as\r\na barrier to development and a positive attitude —\r\nbased on the belief in one’s own ability to improve\r\noneself through individual effort — as a driving force\r\nof development.\r\nIn order to bolster all the elements I have cited, it\r\nis essential that the right to accede to public office\r\nshould be accompanied by the responsibility to carry\r\nout one’s duties honestly. At the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, several heads of State have\r\nemphasized the need to fight corruption. It is a\r\nresponsibility that has rightly been gaining ground.\r\nIn Nicaragua, we have undertaken the arduous\r\nfight against corruption. First, corrupt bureaucrats have\r\nbeen brought to trial and sentenced, just as is\r\nhappening in other Latin American countries.\r\nSecondly, we have brought before the National\r\nAssembly a body of legislation to strengthen our fight\r\nagainst corruption.\r\nThirdly, we have established a programme for\r\nintegrity and transparency that prevents corrupt\r\npractices in the executive branch and which provides a\r\nmodel for the other branches of Government in\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nundertaking reform and increasing transparency. For\r\nexample, we have published on the Internet, for\r\neveryone to see — for the countries extending\r\nassistance, international organizations and the\r\nmedia — both the Republic’s national budget and the\r\ndetails of external assistance.\r\nFourthly, we have undertaken to fight the culture\r\nof corruption, including by teaching values and\r\npromoting the idea of the individual as the maker of his\r\nor her own destiny.\r\nWe must work for a United Nations that reaffirms\r\nits credibility and authority by taking the appropriate\r\neffective collective action. Nicaragua recognizes the\r\nimportance of the proposals various countries have\r\nsubmitted to this forum, in particular Spain’s proposal\r\nto reduce external debt in exchange for initiatives for\r\nsocial development, particularly in the area of primary\r\neducation, and the United States proposal to create a\r\nfund for democracy. Nicaragua views with approval\r\nthat such a democracy fund would be partially\r\nallocated to training and support for auditing and\r\njudicial entities, given that corruption is the greatest\r\nfoe of democracy. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\nsaid yesterday, “They notice when we use words to\r\nmask inaction”. Nicaragua’s energy and determination\r\nare devoted to those efforts.\r\nRecent world events have demonstrated once\r\nagain the evil nature of terrorism and how it breaks\r\ndown the values of humanity and civilization. I\r\nreiterate my most sincere condolences to all those\r\ncountries and individuals around the world that have\r\nsuffered the effects of terrorism.\r\nI underline that we deplore, to cite only the most\r\nrecent acts, those who caused the loss of the precious\r\nlives of innocent children in the Russian Federation.\r\nWe also repudiate the attack against the Australian\r\nEmbassy in Jakarta.\r\nThe best way to defeat terrorism is to remain\r\nfaithful to our values of freedom, dignity and justice.\r\nTerrorism rejects those values.\r\nNicaragua aspires to be elected as a non-\r\npermanent member of the Security Council for 2006\r\nand 2007. Nicaragua, a founding country of the\r\nOrganization, has known and suffered the horrors of\r\nwar and has undertaken the democratization of our\r\nnation. It is by virtue of the valuable school of our\r\nrecent history that we can participate in the Security\r\nCouncil. As I stated in this forum last year, whoever\r\nknows the horrors of war can contribute more\r\neffectively to preventing it.\r\nI cannot fail to refer to the question of Taiwan’s\r\nrepresentation in the United Nations. That country,\r\nwith 23 million inhabitants, has a democratic\r\nGovernment and maintains diplomatic, trade and\r\ncooperative relations with many Member States of the\r\nOrganization. However, paradoxically, it lacks\r\nmembership. That exclusion is inexcusable.\r\nAt the beginning of this session, we heard the sad\r\nmessages from Haiti and the Dominican Republic,\r\nwhich have suffered the devastating effects of nature. I\r\nconvey our solidarity, encouragement and hope to\r\nthose countries and to the victims of natural disasters\r\nin the United States, Grenada, Jamaica, Panama, the\r\nBahamas, Cuba, Grand Cayman and other islands of\r\nthe Caribbean.\r\nThis afternoon, I began my address by speaking\r\nof the responsibilities of citizens. That is the way for\r\nour peoples to attain their hopes, expectations and\r\ndreams.\r\nMay God bless the United Nations and may God\r\nalways bless Nicaragua.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of Nicaragua for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Enrique Bolaños Geyer, President of the\r\nRepublic of Nicaragua, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Domitien Ndayizeye, President of the\r\nRepublic of Burundi\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Burundi.\r\nMr. Domitien Ndayizeye, President of the\r\nRepublic of Burundi, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Domitien\r\nNdayizeye, President of the Republic of Burundi, and\r\nto invite him to address the General Assembly.\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nPresident Ndayizeye (spoke in French): On\r\nbehalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, I\r\nextend my sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your\r\nwell-deserved election to the prestigious presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at this session. I assure you of\r\nmy entire delegation’s unwavering support for you in\r\nyour noble work.\r\nI also pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Julian\r\nRobert Hunte, for his excellent guidance of the work of\r\nthe Assembly at the fifty-eighth session.\r\nI also take this opportunity once again to\r\ncongratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan on his\r\nongoing dedication and courage in discharging his\r\nresponsibilities. I thank him for his ever-growing and\r\nresolute support for the cause of peace and security\r\nthroughout the world and in my country, Burundi, in\r\nparticular.\r\nWhen the Security Council adopted resolution\r\n1545 (2004) authorizing the deployment of the United\r\nNations Operation in Burundi, the United Nations\r\nmade a real contribution to the peace process in my\r\ncountry, which two months later is now drawing\r\ntowards the final phase of that process.\r\nThe signing of the Arusha Peace and\r\nReconciliation Agreement for Burundi on 28 August\r\n2000 was a decisive step forward in the peace process\r\nin my country, which since 1993 had been devastated\r\nby the longest crisis in its history, even jeopardizing\r\nthe very existence of the nation. The Agreement\r\nushered in a new era of calm and a gradual return to\r\npeace with the conclusion of ceasefire agreements with\r\nthe armed political movements, especially since the\r\nsigning on 16 November 2003 of a comprehensive\r\nceasefire agreement with the main rebel movement\r\nConseil national pour la défense de la démocratie-\r\nForces nationales pour la défense de la démocratie.\r\nToday, calm has descended throughout almost all\r\nour national territory because we have acted on our\r\nfirm commitment to implement the agreements. Fully\r\ninclusive institutions have gradually been established\r\nand we are now preparing to enter the post-transition\r\nera with elected institutions, to the satisfaction of our\r\npeople and that of the international community.\r\nWe wish to send the strong message that we are\r\nresolved to break the logic of violence and to support\r\nthe restoration of peace, reconciliation, democracy and\r\ndevelopment in our country. We also protect and\r\nstrengthen peace and security by integrating the\r\nfighters from the armed movements into the security\r\nand defence forces that we will need to establish our\r\nnational army and police force, to the comfort of all.\r\nThe process will be complemented by the disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants and\r\ntroops not included in the integration process.\r\nThe disarmament, demobilization and\r\nprofessional or social reintegration programme is\r\ncoordinated at the uppermost level by the highest\r\nauthorities of our country, including the ministries\r\nconcerned and representatives of the World Bank, the\r\narmy and the armed movements. The programme is\r\ncurrently in its first phase, bringing the combatants\r\ntogether into agreed zones. Those combatants will very\r\nshortly be transferred to the sites identified for their\r\ncantonment, while the Government troops will remain\r\nin their barracks. We already have in place a precedent\r\nfor the integration of the forces, having created a\r\nspecial institutional protection brigade on 1 July.\r\nMoreover, mixed military units have begun training in\r\na pilot centre with a view to establishing the national\r\ndefence force. This approach is intended to correct the\r\nethnic and regional imbalances that have often been\r\nobserved in our country and that have constituted the\r\nsource of the social and political conflict that has\r\nbrought us so much suffering.\r\nThe demobilization sites are ready, but we face a\r\nterrible shortage of material and financial resources to\r\npay for the increase in the numbers of people we will\r\nhave to handle in the first few years before progressive\r\ndemobilization ends. We must recall that\r\ndemobilization and disarmament will make a real\r\ncontribution to creating a security environment\r\nconducive to the organization of free, democratic,\r\ntransparent and honest elections.\r\nThe draft post-transition constitution, which will\r\nserve as the basis for organizing the elections, and\r\nother legal and administrative texts were discussed at\r\ngreat length among the politicians in the President’s\r\ncircle and at the levels of mediation and heads of State\r\nof the subregion. Some provisions on power-sharing\r\nthat did not enjoy unanimous support were upheld by\r\n20 of 30 political parties and endorsed by the twenty-\r\nsecond summit of heads of State of the subregion. They\r\nwere then included in the draft constitution, which was\r\nadopted unanimously by our Parliament, with a 70-per\r\ncent attendance rate, on 17 September. We have\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nscheduled a referendum on the draft constitution for 20\r\nOctober.\r\nThus, despite the opposition of some political\r\nparties, we believe that Burundi will soon have a post-\r\ntransition constitution and other legal texts that are\r\ncustomary in democratic countries. We are placing our\r\nfaith in the Independent National Electoral\r\nCommission established to organize the technical\r\naspects of the elections. We would stress that the\r\nCommission will succeed only if we obtain the support\r\nof our external bilateral and multilateral partners. We\r\nsincerely thank those who have already pledged their\r\nassistance, and we would urge others to follow suit.\r\nThe efforts to maintain peace are still being\r\nresisted by the Palipehutu-Forces nationales de\r\nliberation movement, which still refuses to come to the\r\nnegotiating table. Following the movement’s\r\ninvolvement in the assassination of Papal Nuncio\r\nMonsignor Courtney and in the massacre of Congolese\r\nrefugees in Gatumba and elsewhere, the summit of\r\nheads of State of the regional initiative on Burundi,\r\nmeeting in Dar-es-Salaam, classified it as a terrorist\r\norganization and recommended that the United Nations\r\nand the African Union take the appropriate restrictive\r\nmeasures. Here, I would like to urge the United\r\nNations to support the decisions taken at that regional\r\nsummit and thus to follow the lead of the African\r\nUnion, which has already responded favourably to that\r\nappeal. I also take this opportunity to thank the heads\r\nof State of the subregion and the mediators for the\r\nsupport that they have constantly provided to the\r\nBurundian peace process.\r\nAs everyone knows, security concerns are\r\nunfortunately not limited to within my country’s\r\nborders. The security of Burundi affects that of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and\r\nTanzania. In the light of that interdependence, an\r\ninternational conference on peace, security, democracy,\r\neconomic development and regional integration in the\r\nGreat Lakes region is scheduled for November in\r\nDar es Salaam. That conference will undoubtedly have\r\na positive effect on the countries concerned. I have the\r\nfirm conviction that it will promote a new dynamic of\r\npeace in the entire subregion so that we can bury the\r\nhatchet of war and turn resolutely towards the integral\r\nand integrated development of our peoples.\r\nThe efforts to contain and resolve the many\r\nconflicts that continue to shake the African continent\r\nare very instructive. First of all, the African countries\r\nand the African Union have shown their political will\r\nand their resolve to manage their own problems,\r\ndespite an obvious shortage of resources. Therefore, it\r\nis time to call for the substantial strengthening of\r\ninternational support provided to the African Union\r\nand for much more active cooperation between the\r\nAfrican Union and the United Nations on conflict\r\nprevention and the restoration of peace. Moreover, the\r\nvarious approaches have shown us that the quest for\r\npeace must be inclusive, not deliberately excluding\r\nanyone. That is a sensible and productive approach.\r\nSuch joint action is something we hope the\r\nOrganization can do — particularly now, when\r\nmultilateralism seems to be recovering from recent\r\ndifficult ordeals. We must therefore remain united to\r\npreserve the cherished ideals bequeathed to us by the\r\nfounders of the United Nations and enthusiastically\r\nreaffirmed in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nA much more cohesive and shared action under\r\nthe banner of the United Nations is thus essential at the\r\npresent time, marked by the complexity of the\r\nchallenges we are called to face, such as nebulous\r\ninternational terrorism, which is more of a threat to\r\npeace, stability and the safety of our borders than ever\r\nbefore; the risk of the proliferation of small arms and\r\nlight weapons; and prostitution and the illicit trade in\r\nhuman persons, whose effects are both cruel and\r\ndevastating to human rights, particularly children’s\r\nrights.\r\nCohesion undoubtedly implies a carefully\r\nplanned effort. In that regard, we welcome the\r\nSecretary-General’s initiative to establish a High-Level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change. Its\r\nconclusions will serve as beacons to us as we seek to\r\nhumanize international relations and to promote a\r\nworld of solidarity and development compatible with\r\nthe environment.\r\nThe complexity of the current challenges\r\njustifies — now more than ever before — the urgent,\r\nlong-awaited reform of the Organization. We welcome\r\nthe steps already taken to streamline the working\r\nmethods of the General Assembly and the reforms\r\nalready initiated within the Secretariat with a view to\r\nadapting the Organization’s internal structures and\r\nculture to new expectations and challenges. We hope\r\nthat the same dynamic will be applied to Security\r\nCouncil reform so that it will soon become a reality.\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nAttaining the Millennium Development Goals is a\r\nchallenge for us all. Experts suggest that the efforts\r\nalready undertaken are not equal to the task. Therefore,\r\nwe must sharpen our focus by mobilizing more of the\r\nnecessary resources.\r\nOur moral and historic responsibility to future\r\ngenerations is particularly great in the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS. Entire families have been decimated,\r\nmillions of children have been orphaned and elderly\r\npersons are abandoned, alone and defenceless. It is the\r\nfamily structure that is disintegrating, and that is\r\nhorrible to see. It is our common responsibility to unite\r\nour forces to wipe out this pandemic, which knows no\r\nborders and threatens the very survival of the human\r\nrace. We have no right to fail.\r\nIn the economic area, we know the unbearable\r\nsituation of the peoples in the least developed\r\ncountries, who are trapped in abject poverty. In that\r\nregard, my delegation urges the international\r\ncommunity to work together in implementing the\r\nBrussels Programme of Action. From that perspective,\r\ndebt relief, more flexible conditions for joining the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, an increase\r\nin official development assistance and the opening up\r\nof international markets deserve careful attention.\r\nThe international community cannot remain\r\nindecisive on the issue of agricultural subsidies in\r\nindustrialized countries that distort the rules of the\r\ngame of free competition and considerably reduce the\r\nopportunities for poor countries to develop.\r\nAfrica has enormous natural resources, yet\r\npoverty, diseases and suffering of every kind ravage it\r\nmore than they do other continents. By forming the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development, Africans\r\nhave committed themselves to promoting good\r\npolitical and economic governance — a prerequisite\r\nfor sustainable development. The priorities are already\r\nidentified, sector by sector, and the subregional\r\nstructures are being further strengthened. Yet the\r\nsuccess of the efforts currently under way will depend\r\nnot only on the resolve of Africans themselves, but\r\nalso on the level of solidarity offered by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe twentieth century and the beginning of the\r\ntwenty-first century have witnessed important forums\r\nin which the world’s leaders have made decisive\r\ncommitments in various areas affecting human\r\nsecurity, in the profound sense of the term. Those\r\ncommitments, which have given rise to much hope\r\nthroughout the world, have been implemented only\r\npartially. It is our hope that the high-level plenary\r\nmeeting scheduled for 2005 will be able to breathe new\r\nlife into the implementation of the commitments made,\r\nfor the happiness and prosperity of present and future\r\ngenerations.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of Burundi for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Domitien Ndayizeye, President of the\r\nRepublic of Burundi, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Boniface Alexandre, Interim\r\nPresident of the Republic of Haiti\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the Interim President of\r\nthe Republic of Haiti.\r\nMr. Boniface Alexandre, Interim President of the\r\nRepublic of Haiti, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Boniface\r\nAlexandre, Interim President of the Republic of Haiti,\r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Alexandre (spoke in French): It is a\r\npleasure for me, on behalf of the people and the\r\nGovernment of Haiti and on my own behalf, to express\r\nto you, Sir, my heartfelt congratulations on your\r\nelection on 10 June to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth regular session. The\r\noutstanding qualities that have won you this distinction\r\nundoubtedly constitute a guarantee that our work will\r\nprogress well. I am convinced that advances will be\r\nmade in the search for viable and lasting solutions to\r\nthe different problems confronting the international\r\ncommunity. I also wish to express our gratitude to\r\nMinister Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia, whose far-\r\nsightedness and sense of balance gave decisive weight\r\nto his initiatives to give new dynamics to the work of\r\nthe General Assembly during the last session.\r\nI also want to pay tribute to the Secretary-General\r\nof the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to reiterate\r\nto him, on behalf of the Haitian people, our deepest\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nappreciation for the constant interest that he has shown\r\nin Haiti. This is also an opportunity for me to express\r\nto you, Mr. President, and to the United Nations family\r\nmy deepest thanks for the expressions of sympathy\r\ntowards — and solidarity with — the Haitian people,\r\nonce again struck by terrible floods on 18 and\r\n19 September 2004.\r\nSince 1945, our Organization has given proof of\r\nits capacity for survival and renewal. Nonetheless, the\r\nrecent course of events in certain parts of the world is\r\nof constant concern. The imposing of terror as a form\r\nof political expression is completely unacceptable. In\r\nthis regard, Haiti endorses the relevant resolutions of\r\nthe Security Council. The spiral of violence, which\r\ntragically affects civilian populations here and\r\nelsewhere, is an attack on human dignity and on the\r\nculture of peace that the United Nations embodies. The\r\nUnited Nations must necessarily play its role in the\r\nforefront, in accordance with the United Nations\r\nCharter, in the settlement of disputes that threaten\r\ninternational peace and security. The Republic of Haiti\r\nwishes to reaffirm its commitment to the ideals and to\r\nthe principles of universality of our Organization and\r\nto the objectives of peace and development to be\r\nattained through international cooperation.\r\nWhile the Republic of Haiti celebrates, this year,\r\nthe bicentenary of its independence, it has had to\r\nrequest the solidarity of the United Nations to help in\r\nthe stabilization of the situation in the country,\r\nfollowing the events of 29 February 2004. The Haitian\r\npeople express their appreciation to the Security\r\nCouncil, which, at my request, gave the international\r\ncommunity the mandate to help Haiti in the process of\r\npolitical transition by virtue of Security Council\r\nresolutions 1529 (2004) and 1542 (2004).\r\nSeven months after the major political events that\r\ntook place in Haiti, I have come here to bear witness to\r\nthe hopes that democratic renewal is inspiring in the\r\nHaitian population. I am also here to say, on behalf of\r\nthe Haitian people and their Government, that the\r\nRepublic of Haiti has never felt as close to the\r\nprinciples and the objectives of the United Nations,\r\nwhich, at the height of our distress, showed its interest\r\nin a future of freedom, democracy and collective well-\r\nbeing in Haiti.\r\nOn 29 February 2004, in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of the Haitian Constitution and in my\r\ncapacity as Chief Justice of our Supreme Court, I took\r\nmy oath as interim President of the Republic. Fifteen\r\ndays later, a Government of transition was established,\r\nwith the participation of the political and social forces\r\nof the country. The transition over which I am\r\npresiding is designed to be inclusive. The democratic\r\nprocess has begun. Political parties are forming, and\r\nothers are reorganizing themselves. A constant and\r\nfruitful dialogue has begun between the authorities of\r\nthe State, the political class and civil society\r\norganizations in the country. In that same spirit, a\r\nmutually satisfactory agreement was reached on\r\n18 September between the Government authorities and\r\nthe representatives of the demobilized military. This\r\nthus spared the nation a bloodbath and a pointless\r\nfratricidal struggle.\r\nI pledged, before the Haitian nation, to put an end\r\nto the political transition that dated back some 20\r\nyears. May this transition put an end to the transition.\r\nGeneral elections will be organized in 2005. The\r\nGovernment resolutely supports this process, and, on\r\n7 February 2006, I must and will hand power over to a\r\ndemocratically elected President.\r\nI thank those States that made the deployment of\r\nthe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti\r\n(MINUSTAH) possible, particularly those that have\r\nmade or will make contingents available to the\r\nmission. I invite MINUSTAH to work more closely\r\nwith the Haitian authorities for genuine disarmament in\r\nthe country. It is not admissible that armed groups\r\ncommit their misdeeds with impunity, without being\r\nthe least disturbed by the presence of MINUSTAH.\r\nThe Haitian national police is steadily strengthening.\r\nThe transitional Government counts on international\r\ncooperation to make that strengthening not only\r\nquantitative, but qualitative, in terms of training and\r\nequipment.\r\nWithout the active and sustained support of the\r\ninternational community, the objectives of the\r\ntransitional Government might not be achieved. That\r\nfailure would mean a return to anarchy and chaos in\r\nHaiti and would be a grave setback to the United\r\nNations.\r\nHowever, Haiti has a fresh look. All freedoms are\r\nguaranteed, international commitments are respected\r\nand justice again prevails. Unfortunately, the\r\nGovernment of Haiti and its intentions were recently\r\nquestioned, following a verdict in which no member of\r\nthe executive branch had any role whatsoever, and that,\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nin accordance with the Constitution and the laws of the\r\nRepublic.\r\nThe necessary reform of the Haitian judicial\r\nsystem is clearly an imperative. But it is fundamentally\r\nunjust to blame the present Government of brazen\r\ninterference in judiciary proceedings or to\r\nsystematically bleed magistrates and the civil servants\r\nin charge of establishing the law.\r\nThe Government of Haiti is extremely sensitive\r\nto the comments and remarks of its friends and partners\r\nwith whom it is cooperating in all fields of political,\r\neconomic and social governance; but it refuses to be\r\nassociated with or connected to decisions that involve\r\nonly one organ of the State, which acted completely\r\nindependently, even if those decisions might raise\r\ncertain questions.\r\nWhat must not be forgotten is that I am still\r\nPresident of the Court of Appeals, provisionally\r\nexercising the function of President of the Republic.\r\nTherefore, I cannot tolerate any arbitrary action, nor\r\ncan I tolerate any interference of the political authority\r\nin the judiciary system. Justice must be independent.\r\nGuaranteeing security, promoting freedom and\r\nhuman dignity, promoting economic growth and social\r\ndevelopment, preparing the provisional electoral\r\ncouncil for the holding of honest, credible and clean\r\nelections — those are the objectives that the\r\nGovernment of Haiti intends to achieve through its\r\nprogramme of action, within the current climate of\r\nexceptional difficulties.\r\nFor that reason, I make a solemn appeal from this\r\nrostrum to the international community, to friendly\r\ncountries, to the specialized agencies of the United\r\nNations system, and to all of those for whom solidarity\r\nis not just word that special attention, beyond symbolic\r\ngestures, be given to the Republic of Haiti so that a\r\nsubstantial and well-directed cooperative effort may\r\nhelp mobilize the necessary resources, with a view to\r\nimmediate and long-term action, and may promote the\r\nreturn of sustained growth in Haiti following years of\r\nstagnation.\r\nThe people of Haiti are starting anew, and it is\r\nnatural that at this time they should turn to the United\r\nNations. Based upon the values and objectives that we\r\nshare, Haiti seeks the understanding of its natural\r\npartners so that it can at last break the infernal cycle of\r\nviolence and isolation in which it has lived for too\r\nlong.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Interim\r\nPresident of the Republic of Haiti for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Boniface Alexandre, Interim President of the\r\nRepublic of Haiti, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Oscar Berger Perdomo, President of\r\nthe Republic of Guatemala\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Guatemala.\r\nMr. Oscar Berger Perdomo, President of the\r\nRepublic of Guatemala, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations Mr. Oscar Berger Perdomo,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Guatemala, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Perdomo (spoke in Spanish): I would\r\nlike to begin by expressing our appreciation to\r\nMr. Julian Hunte, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saint\r\nLucia, for his accomplished and skilful leadership of\r\nthe General Assembly during its previous session.\r\nI would also like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-ninth session.\r\nI would also like to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the great wisdom that he\r\nhas shown in the discharge of his functions. He\r\ndeserves our respect and appreciation, and we extend\r\nto him our support and solidarity.\r\nMy country has reached a crucial point in its\r\nhistory. It faces the challenge of living up to the\r\nexpectations raised by the end of the internal armed\r\nconflict. Since January, when I assumed office, the\r\nfrustrated hopes of all of our people have been\r\nrekindled.\r\nMy plan of government is predicated on the peace\r\nagreements and defines their implementation as a\r\ncommitment of the whole nation. As President of\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nGuatemala, I endorse fully the principle that a firm and\r\nlasting peace must be based on participatory socio-\r\neconomic development, aimed at achieving the\r\ncommon good and responding to the needs of all of our\r\npeople, particularly those still living in extreme\r\npoverty.\r\nSince I took office, I have made a point of\r\nlistening to the opinions of all of our citizens. That has\r\nenabled me to identify the constraints facing\r\nGuatemala, which it must overcome if it is to deal\r\nadequately with the many legitimate social demands\r\nand expectations.\r\nThe actions that my Government intends to take\r\nin the period 2004 to 2008 will focus on four areas:\r\nsocial investment; conditions of production;\r\nenvironmental sustainability; and security for all.\r\nThose policies are being carried out within the\r\nframework of the principles of solidarity and\r\ninclusiveness; decentralization and participation; and\r\ntransparency in public actions. Those areas of action\r\nand principles accord fully with the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nI would like to single out a number of\r\nachievements resulting from our new approach to\r\ngovernment. We have reduced our troop strength by\r\n43 per cent and have begun to modernize the armed\r\nforces and to make them more professional, consistent\r\nwith the functions that they are required to perform in\r\ntime of peace. This includes, at the international level,\r\ngreater participation by the Guatemalan army in United\r\nNations peace operations, for example in Haiti.\r\nIn terms of public spending, we are according\r\npriority to education, health, security, citizenship and\r\ninfrastructure.\r\nWe are fighting petty crime, gang-related crime\r\nand organized crime, focusing in particular on\r\ncombating drug trafficking, terrorism, smuggling,\r\nmoney laundering, trafficking in persons and the illegal\r\narms trade, all of which represent a huge challenge that\r\ncannot be overcome without the support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe are waging an all-out war against corruption,\r\nand creating mechanisms to ensure transparency in\r\npublic procurement and contracting. For the first time\r\nin the history of our country, charges of corruption are\r\nbeing investigated, and those found guilty will be\r\nprosecuted.\r\nWe have adopted a series of measures aimed at\r\nelaborating and implementing a fiscal pact. Sustained\r\nefforts are being made to meet the taxation goals set\r\nout in the peace agreements, within the framework of\r\nmy Government’s objectives for economic growth.\r\nWe have, as a matter of priority, established a\r\nnational front against hunger and malnutrition.\r\nWorking with civil society, we have elaborated a policy\r\non food and nutritional security.\r\nWe have consolidated our responsible approach\r\nto macroeconomic management; that is necessary if we\r\nare to promote competitiveness and productive\r\ninvestment and ensure the well-being of all\r\nGuatemalans. In this context, we launched a\r\nprogramme for economic and social recovery, entitled\r\nVamos Guatemala.\r\nWe have taken firm measures to eliminate\r\nextreme poverty and reduce social exclusion, while\r\nfully respecting our diversity — for Guatemala is a\r\nmulti-ethnic, multicultural and multilingual country.\r\nMy Government is committed to full respect for\r\nhuman rights. We believe that every Guatemalan\r\nshould enjoy basic rights and fundamental freedoms,\r\nand that the right to development must be ensured. In\r\nthis context, Guatemala will cooperate with\r\ninternational bodies that promote and protect human\r\nrights.\r\nMy Government’s foreign policy is consistent\r\nwith its national interests. Our guiding principle is the\r\nneed to ensure that Guatemala can take its proper place\r\nin today’s globalized world, as well as to strengthen\r\nmultilateralism and regional integration.\r\nThe presidents of the Central American countries\r\nhave given greater impetus to our integration process.\r\nThis year, we took the decisions required to bring to\r\nfruition a customs union between El Salvador,\r\nHonduras, Nicaragua and Guatemala.\r\nMy Government is proposing a new beginning in\r\nits bilateral relationship with Belize. We must reach a\r\npermanent, just, equitable and honourable settlement of\r\nthe territorial dispute between the two countries, while\r\nat the same time making a constructive effort to resolve\r\nthe socio-economic problems afflicting our peoples.\r\nThat is why my Government is promoting joint\r\nprojects relating to production, a trade agreement,\r\ngreater flexibility in the transit of persons, goods and\r\nservices, full observance of human rights and the\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nconclusion of agreements for mutual legal assistance,\r\nall of which will contribute to the progress of our\r\npeoples and to the security of the region.\r\nThe Central American countries have just\r\nconcluded trade negotiations with the United States.\r\nLast May, at the Guadalajara Summit, an\r\nannouncement was made regarding the initiation of a\r\nprocess leading up to an association agreement\r\nbetween Central America and the European Union, to\r\ninclude a free trade agreement. We will shortly be\r\nsigning a trade agreement with Colombia, and we hope\r\nto conclude free trade agreements with Taiwan,\r\nMERCOSUR, the Andean Group and the Caribbean\r\nCommunity.\r\nLooking after the interests of Guatemalan\r\nemigrants is also a priority issue for my Government.\r\nWe provide support for them as they seek solutions to\r\ntheir problems and respect for their fundamental rights.\r\nWe are in contact with the receiving countries,\r\nparticularly the United States of America, with a view\r\nto regularizing the situation of emigrants, who make a\r\nsubstantial contribution to the well-being of their\r\ncommunities.\r\nAll the efforts that Guatemala is making to\r\novercome poverty and achieve socio-economic\r\ndevelopment necessarily depend on the progress being\r\nmade in multilateral trade negotiations. Guatemala\r\nappeals to the international community to fulfil its\r\nlongstanding commitments to eliminate all the\r\nmeasures and practices that distort markets, to\r\nliberalize trade in our products and, more generally, to\r\nadopt measures enabling a country like Guatemala,\r\nwhich has been striving to open its economy, to obtain\r\nbetter opportunities for access to markets for its\r\nexports.\r\nMay I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the\r\nUnited Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala\r\n(MINUGUA), which, after 10 years of fruitful work, is\r\nreaching the end of its mandate. MINUGUA has left an\r\nimportant legacy in our country.\r\nI would like to turn now to our agenda at this\r\nsession. We are convinced of the need to adapt the\r\nOrganization to the new challenges, threats and\r\nchanges that humanity faces. We trust that 2005 will\r\noffer us an opportunity to react to them in a responsible\r\nmanner.\r\nOne of the most timely issues is the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. Our position thereon has been\r\nevolving, reflecting the imperative need to make that\r\norgan more representative, transparent and effective.\r\nWe advocate the expansion of its membership and\r\ncould agree to such an expansion being applied to both\r\ncategories of members — permanent and non-\r\npermanent — so long as the need to ensure adequate\r\ngeographic representation is taken into account. The\r\nreform of the Security Council would be the point of\r\ndeparture for the adaptation of all the organs of the\r\nUnited Nations to the new circumstances. We favour\r\nthe strengthening of the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nWe reiterate our complete repudiation of all\r\nforms of terrorism. We are taking all feasible measures\r\nat the national level against the scourge and support the\r\ncollective action of the international community to\r\ncombat it, inter alia, through the implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1390\r\n(2002), as well as participation in the relevant treaties.\r\nWe are convinced of the need for a stronger\r\ncollective capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts. We\r\nbelieve that the United Nations should continue to\r\naddress the imperative of development, including such\r\nemerging issues as transnational migrations. We also\r\nfeel that our Organization should play a vital role in\r\nseeking to ensure that the benefits of globalization are\r\nwidely distributed among all countries. In that\r\nconnection, we wish to highlight the significance we\r\nattach to the Monterrey Consensus and the\r\nJohannesburg Plan of Action.\r\nGuatemala is conscious of the divisions that\r\npersist in the Middle East, Asia and Africa among\r\nneighbouring countries. We earnestly hope that the\r\ndisputes between them can be resolved through\r\ndialogue and other peaceful means, thus enabling all\r\npeoples of the world to be represented here without\r\nrejection or discrimination.\r\nI wish to note in particular our concern over the\r\nsituation of the 23 million inhabitants of the Republic\r\nof China on Taiwan, whose aspirations to\r\nrepresentation in international bodies remain\r\nunfulfilled. We also wish to voice our earnest hope that\r\nthe difficult situation prevailing in the Middle East,\r\nwhich has deteriorated of late, will be resolved in\r\nconformity with Security Council resolutions 242\r\n(1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002) and 1402 (2002).\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nUnder your guidance, Sir, this Assembly will\r\nhave to address issues of the greatest significance for\r\nhumankind and the United Nations. Guatemala\r\nundertakes to participate actively in this year’s debates\r\nand in the special event to be held just before our next\r\nregular session. We hasten to offer our cooperation\r\nwith a view to the success of your endeavours.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of Guatemala for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Oscar Berger Perdomo, President of the\r\nRepublic of Guatemala, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Elías Antonio Saca González,\r\nPresident of the Republic of El Salvador\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of El Salvador.\r\nMr. Elías Antonio Saca González, President of the\r\nRepublic of El Salvador, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Elías Antonio\r\nSaca González, President of the Republic of El\r\nSalvador, and to invite him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Saca González (spoke in Spanish): It\r\nis my great honour to represent the Salvadoran people\r\nas I address the United Nations, the supreme global\r\nforum, for the first time.\r\nI wish to convey my sincerest congratulations to\r\nyou, Sir, on your election to coordinate the work of this\r\nsession. We also thank Mr. Julian Hunte for his\r\noutstanding leadership of the last session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nTo the Secretary-General, we reiterate our\r\nadmiration and our respect for his leadership in the\r\nfulfilment of the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter at a time when the Organization is\r\nconfronting growing and complex global challenges\r\naffecting international peace and security.\r\nInternal and international conflicts, terrorism and\r\ntransnational organized crime, the persistence of\r\nextreme poverty, environmental deterioration and\r\nunresolved development problems are global in nature\r\nand require a harmonizing centre that can support the\r\nefforts of the international community to find shared\r\nand consensual solutions in order to establish an\r\ninternational order that responds to the needs and\r\naspirations of humankind.\r\nThat integrating centre must be the United\r\nNations. We therefore support the establishment of the\r\npanel of eminent persons to make recommendations on\r\ncollective security and the strengthening of\r\nmultilateralism in order more effectively to confront\r\nglobal challenges.\r\nIrrational and criminal terrorist acts have\r\nhighlighted the need for us to unite in our efforts and\r\nour determination, regardless of the differences that\r\nmay exist among States, to unify our views and adopt\r\ncollective action to find ways to confront the\r\nphenomenon and its causes, in the framework of\r\nrespect for international law.\r\nThe delegation of El Salvador reaffirms its full\r\nconviction that global terrorism is not an issue between\r\ncultures or nations. From that perspective, the\r\nGovernment of El Salvador has decided to respond to\r\nthe United Nations appeal by participating in the work\r\nof reconstruction and humanitarian assistance in Iraq.\r\nBy its very nature, our presence in Iraq deserves\r\nan additional explanation. We are not there for military\r\nreasons. Ours is a considered response to the appeal\r\nlaunched by this Organization for the international\r\ncommunity to help in the transition phase leading to\r\nthe full establishment of authority based on the free\r\nwill of the Iraqi people, with absolute respect for its\r\nterritorial integrity, its own culture and its\r\nunquestionable right to define its own destiny.\r\nEl Salvador suffered a long internal war and\r\nsucceeded, with the support of the international\r\ncommunity and the United Nations, in achieving\r\nlasting peace. We believe that the time has come to\r\nmake our testimony and accumulated experience, both\r\nduring the political negotiations for peace and the\r\npeace-building phase, available to other peoples.\r\nEl Salvador reiterates its firm and resolute\r\nsupport for peace-building and peacekeeping\r\noperations, above all because we have enjoyed the\r\nbenefits of such an operation, but also, of course,\r\nbecause of their positive results in various regions of\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nthe world. On the basis of that conviction, our country\r\nhas signed a memorandum of understanding with the\r\nUnited Nations, the best evidence of El Salvador’s\r\ncommitment to such activities, which are so necessary\r\nin today’s complex and unquiet world. We have\r\npresented a list of resources that are available to the\r\nworld Organization as a basis for our participation in\r\nfuture operations, in addition to those in which we are\r\nalready participating.\r\nIn that context, in order to demonstrate our spirit\r\nof cooperation on these issues, I am pleased to\r\nannounce my Government’s interest in submitting its\r\ncandidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security\r\nCouncil so as to make our accumulated experience\r\navailable to this Organization.\r\nSince the successful conclusion of our internal\r\nconflict, El Salvador has focused its attention\r\nresolutely on human development. The Government I\r\nlead, by dint of a broad majority vote of the Salvadoran\r\npeople on 1 June, is one of openness and inclusion,\r\nwith a vision of national integration and service to the\r\ninterests and aspirations of our people. Such vital\r\nquestions as security, employment, the effective\r\nimprovement of basic services and the productivity of\r\nour communities and regions are the top priorities of\r\nour governing programme.\r\nWe are focusing on transforming national\r\neducation, on reshaping public health care, on\r\nsignificantly strengthening the rule of law, on\r\ncombating crime in all its manifestations and at all\r\nlevels, on reactivating the economy and on making\r\nSalvadoran society internationally competitive. Insofar\r\nas we achieve greater progress domestically, we will be\r\ncompetitive externally.\r\nIn addition, however, we are working on a social\r\nplan geared towards reducing extreme poverty in the\r\nnext five years. To that end, we are undertaking a tax\r\nreform that will increase tax collection and reduce\r\nevasion, allowing us to obtain the additional funds\r\nnecessary to implementing our social plan. We shall\r\nlevy a special tax on tobacco, alcohol, weapons and\r\nammunition in order to promote a special health care\r\nfund with which we will expand health assistance to\r\nthe rural areas of our country and undermine the black\r\nmarket in those goods.\r\nIn the approximately 100 days that we have been\r\nin office, we have undertaken important health reforms\r\nby extending medical coverage to the age of 12 for the\r\nchildren of workers who contribute to Salvadoran\r\nsocial security and by granting emergency paediatric\r\nservices to almost 400,000 boys and girls.\r\nWe know that no Government effort will be\r\neffective without the cooperation of all sectors in our\r\ncountry. We are therefore launching a mechanism of\r\nunderstanding with all our political and social forces.\r\nIn that context, we have established an employment\r\nagreement that seeks solutions, together with private\r\nenterprise, for strengthening the agriculture,\r\nconstruction, tourism and micro-, small and medium-\r\nsized business sectors, with the aim of generating more\r\njobs.\r\nOne of the best mechanisms for increasing our\r\ndevelopment potential is investment in education. In\r\nthat awareness, we have launched the National\r\nEducation Plan 2021, which seeks to reinvigorate our\r\nvision of the future of education through short-,\r\nmedium- and long-term programmes. We hope that our\r\nnational effort will also enjoy international\r\ncooperation. That is why we were pleased by the\r\ndecision taken by the Government of Spain to provide\r\nassistance for primary education.\r\nThe most urgent of the challenges confronting\r\nSalvadoran society is that of providing security to our\r\ncitizens. In order to meet that need, we recently\r\nestablished a rural police force, along with a\r\nuncompromising plan to eradicate delinquency in\r\nurban areas overrun by gangs. The plan also offers\r\nspecial programmes for young people who wish to\r\nabandon the path of crime.\r\nEl Salvador unreservedly shares the interests\r\nexpressed at the International Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development. We reiterate our dedication to\r\nseeking alternative ways and means and renewed\r\ncommitments to making the fight on poverty more\r\neffective — an objective that is interlinked with peace\r\nand security in the modern world.\r\nIn that vein, we welcome the initiative of Brazil,\r\nFrance, Chile and Spain confirming the need, in the\r\nfight against hunger and poverty, for greater and more\r\neffective efforts to place stability and global security\r\non a solid foundation. If we all apply our will and\r\ncommitment, we can develop new programmes and\r\nidentify innovative public policies that will allow us to\r\nachieve the Millennium Goals.\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nThroughout its history, El Salvador has been a\r\ncountry of emigration. The flow of emigration was\r\nintensified by the war, and today virtually one third of\r\nour population lives abroad. Maintaining and\r\ndeepening links with the country of origin is one of the\r\nmain policies of our administration. Our national\r\nreality requires us to integrate the views of Salvadorans\r\nabroad with local expectations. The economic impact\r\nof this phenomenon is decisive to our life as a nation,\r\nbut equally or even more important is the sociological\r\nand cultural impact of the situation. The phenomenon\r\nof transculturization experienced by our society is\r\nchanging El Salvador forever.\r\nThe contribution of migrants to their countries of\r\norigin and to their host countries deserves special\r\nattention from the international community, and\r\nparticularly from the specialized agencies of the United\r\nNations system. The transfer of remittances is a key\r\nelement in the mobilization of resources for the\r\neradication of poverty and the attainment of the\r\nMillennium Goals. The reduction of the cost of\r\nremittances should be a concern of the international\r\ncommunity. From that standpoint, I am pleased to\r\nexpress our great interest in participating actively in\r\nthe high-level dialogue on international migration and\r\ndevelopment, to be held in 2006.\r\nWe welcome the United States proposal to create\r\na fund for democracy. In the same vein, El Salvador\r\nwelcomes the General Assembly’s proclamation of\r\n2005 as the International Year of Microcredit. The\r\nproclamation can promote the strengthening of micro-,\r\nsmall and medium-sized enterprises, which represent a\r\nbroad spectrum of the social fabric and help sustain\r\nnational progress.\r\nIn today’s world, globalization has put us all on\r\nthe map of international reality. It promotes the\r\ndynamic of strategic alliances in trade and all other\r\nfields, and makes it possible to build models for\r\ndevelopment by comparing them with other\r\nexperiences. Gradually and in a balanced manner, we\r\nhave decided to strengthen our links of cooperation\r\nwith various developed countries. The prevailing\r\nregionalization makes us all dependent on one another.\r\nIn the case of countries such as ours, the situation leads\r\nus to nurture our energies and creativity, open markets,\r\npromote financial flows, facilitate the transfer of\r\ntechnology and encourage competitiveness. These are\r\nmajor opportunities and challenges that we must all\r\naccept.\r\nWhile cooperation for development remains\r\nfundamental, El Salvador reiterates the urgent need for\r\na system of multilateral trade that is open, fair, rule-\r\nbased, foreseeable and non-discriminatory, in\r\naccordance with the objectives of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nIn a world that is becoming increasingly\r\nglobalized and therefore increasingly interdependent,\r\neconomic phenomena affect us all in a chain reaction.\r\nThe current international energy situation has a\r\nsignificant impact on the economies of our countries,\r\nwith a negative effect on the dynamics of growth and\r\nprogress. Thus, from this United Nations rostrum we\r\nstrongly urge that we explore, as an organized\r\ncommunity, not only short-term avenues for\r\novercoming the crises, but also structural remedies that\r\ncan help the most vulnerable countries, in particular. It\r\nis contradictory to talk about combating poverty and\r\nhunger while the consumer countries are paying such\r\nhigh prices for petroleum.\r\nThe complex Palestinian-Israeli conflict is a\r\nsource of enormous concern to our country, given the\r\nincessant violence, the lack of control over terrorist\r\ngroups and the ever-growing difficulty of returning to\r\ndialogue and political understanding. Our country\r\nreiterates, as it has done consistently, its support for\r\nany effort and measure to open space for a negotiated\r\npolitical solution that takes into account the legitimate\r\ninterests of the parties directly involved.\r\nAs for the Republic of China on Taiwan, that is a\r\ncase which the community of nations must examine in\r\nthe light of international realities. Resolution 2758\r\n(XXVI) of 1971 did not resolve the issue of the\r\nrepresentation of the Taiwanese people in the United\r\nNations. That nation has developed politically,\r\neconomically and socially in an independent, free and\r\ndemocratic way. It has its own institutions and\r\ncharacteristics, just like any other State of the\r\ninternational community. However, Taiwan’s situation\r\nin the international community is exceptional, because\r\nits absence from this forum is a denial of the exercise\r\nof the rights that are recognized to other peoples and of\r\nthe universal and democratic nature of our\r\nOrganization. Our delegation therefore supports\r\nconsideration of the exceptional situation of the\r\npopulation of the Republic of China on Taiwan and its\r\neventual participation in this forum and other\r\ninternational organizations.\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nOur Organization has played, is playing and will\r\ncontinue to play a decisive role in maintaining the\r\nworld’s healthy balance. Reality is changing\r\nconstantly. Many things have been left behind and\r\nmany things await us. Institutions in all areas and at all\r\nlevels must evolve with the changing times. In that\r\nvein, we associate ourselves with those who are\r\ncommitted to the structural renewal of the United\r\nNations. We believe that such reform must encompass\r\nthe highest structures, including the Security Council.\r\nEvery year, the nations of the world, through their\r\nrepresentatives, attend this rendezvous with the destiny\r\nof the world. We have the responsibility to do nothing\r\nless than to build a better world for current and future\r\ngenerations. Every word, every gesture and every\r\ndecision made or reached here must be aimed at that\r\nlofty purpose. Only if we combine our efforts can a\r\nnew, safer, fairer, more peaceful and more sharing\r\nreality emerge. Together with all the nations\r\nrepresented here, El Salvador takes up the challenge of\r\njoining in that concert of constructive wills, in the\r\nconfidence that the god of nations will illuminate and\r\nencourage us so that we may fulfil his will for peace\r\nand brotherhood in a world in which no one is left\r\nbehind.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of El Salvador for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nMr. Elías Antonio Saca González, President of the\r\nRepublic of El Salvador, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Charles Gyude Bryant, Chairman of\r\nthe National Transitional Government of the\r\nRepublic of Liberia\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the Chairman of the\r\nNational Transitional Government of the Republic of\r\nLiberia.\r\nMr. Charles Gyude Bryant, Chairman of the\r\nNational Transitional Government of the\r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Charles Gyude\r\nBryant, Chairman of the National Transitional\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Liberia, and to invite\r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nChairman Bryant: It is an honour for me to\r\nstand here today to address the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-ninth session.\r\nWhen, in 1945, Liberia joined the efforts to\r\nestablish this Organization in order to bring an end to a\r\nglobal war and to pursue justice and maintain world\r\npeace, little did we know that we had subscribed to an\r\ninsurance policy that, 59 years later, would provide\r\ncoverage for Liberia and redeem its people and its\r\nsovereignty.\r\nAs members know, Liberia is a country in\r\ntransition from continued crisis to sustainable peace.\r\nThe United Nations, the United States and the\r\nEuropean Union have all worked with the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) to\r\nstabilize the situation, attending to the humanitarian\r\ncrisis and navigating the difficult road to peace. We\r\nremain immensely grateful for the role of South Africa\r\nand ECOWAS for providing regional leadership in the\r\nsearch for peace in Liberia. The pivotal roles played by\r\nboth the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Republic\r\nof Ghana deserve special commendation. We are\r\nparticularly grateful to Secretary-General Annan and\r\nthe United Nations, the United States and the European\r\nUnion for partnering with ECOWAS in these\r\nendeavours.\r\nI am pleased to inform this Assembly that the\r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement singed in Ghana in\r\nAugust 2003 continues to guide the Liberian peace\r\nprocess. A power-sharing National Transitional\r\nGovernment comprising all warring factions, political\r\nparties, and civil society is working. The ceasefire\r\nagreement signed on June 17, 2003, continues to be\r\ninsured by the 15,000-strong United Nations Mission\r\nin Liberia (UNMIL), operating with a Chapter VII\r\nmandate. The force is now disarming and demobilizing\r\nall armed groups.\r\nAt the beginning of the United Nations Mission\r\nin October 2003, we estimated that some 38,000\r\ncombatants would have submitted themselves to the\r\ndisarmament and demobilization program. Today,\r\n73,600 fighters have been disarmed. Over 22,000\r\npieces of serviceable weapons of all kinds have been\r\nsurrendered and decommissioned, and more than\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\n5 million rounds of ammunition collected and\r\ndestroyed by UNMIL.\r\nMeanwhile, the high number of combatants\r\ndisarmed and demobilized has overwhelmed our\r\ncapacity to rehabilitate and reintegrate them. The\r\nabsence of social infrastructures exacerbates the\r\nsituation. War-related damage to the national\r\ninfrastructures and community facilities is extensive.\r\nWithout exception, all communities have lost their\r\ncapacity to accommodate and support even the\r\nslightest caseload of returnees.\r\nSome of the ex-combatants have enrolled in civil\r\nworks programmes sponsored by UNMIL, the\r\nEuropean Commission, the United States Agency for\r\nInternational Development and the People’s Republic\r\nof China. A significant number are seeking readmission\r\ninto regular academic programmes. Others are\r\nenrolling in vocational training institutions to acquire\r\nlife skills.\r\nThere are special efforts being made for children\r\nand female former fighters to receive specialized care\r\nand training through programmes sponsored by United\r\nNations agencies and other international and local non-\r\ngovernmental organizations.\r\nAs a direct result of the civil conflict, a sizeable\r\nnumber of Liberians are currently residing outside of\r\nthe country, mostly as refugees. As disarmament nears\r\ncompletion and as our Government extends its\r\nauthority, the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees is preparing for organized repatriation of\r\nLiberians. In addition, some 500,000 internally\r\ndisplaced persons are expected to commence leaving\r\ntheir camps and returning to their local communities\r\ntowards the end of October this year.\r\nThe role the United Nations is playing to bring\r\nsustainable peace and human dignity to our country\r\nand people is phenomenal and indicative of the new\r\nchallenges which the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community must face and meet head on if\r\nwe, the people of the United Nations, are to live in\r\npeace and enjoy our inalienable rights. Peace and the\r\nfreedom to enjoy those rights under the rule of law\r\nrequire not just curative measures, but preventive\r\nactions to address the problems of poverty, ignorance\r\nand disease of the world’s poorer peoples and\r\ncountries.\r\nThe National Transitional Government’s recovery\r\nagenda has as its focus the improvement of the well-\r\nbeing of our people by the creation of employment\r\nopportunities to put returnees and ex-combatants to\r\nwork. Our recent history teaches us that when ex-\r\ncombatants are not meaningfully rehabilitated and\r\nreintegrated and that when many in our society are not\r\nstakeholders and are excluded, we run the risk that they\r\nwill return to violent crime and conflict. We are\r\nextremely worried about that prospect.\r\nAgainst that background, there is now real\r\nurgency to revive our economy and create jobs. That is\r\nwhy, in June of this year, I pleaded with the Security\r\nCouncil to lift the sanctions imposed on diamonds and\r\ntimber — two sectors that hold great potential for job\r\ncreation and economic recovery. Sanctions continue to\r\nhurt Liberia. It must not be forgotten that the sanctions\r\nwere imposed primarily because Liberia was exporting\r\nconflict by trafficking in arms for diamonds. A related\r\nreason was the lack of transparency and accountability\r\nin the management of State resources, especially from\r\nthe forestry sector and the maritime programme. That\r\nsituation no longer obtains.\r\nOur Government is not buying arms. To the\r\ncontrary, we are disarming tens of thousands of\r\ncombatants. We are also cooperating with the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank,\r\nthe African Development Bank, the European\r\nCommission and the United States Treasury and State\r\nDepartments in putting into place proper mechanisms\r\nfor transparency and accountability in the use of State\r\nresources.\r\nIn that regard, the European Commission is\r\nfunding the systems audit of five revenue-generating\r\nagencies and the Central Bank of Liberia. The World\r\nBank is working with the Government to reform the\r\npublic procurement system and is assisting the Liberia\r\nPetroleum Refinery Corporation to put into place a\r\nsystem of international competitive bidding of\r\npetroleum products. The IMF is assisting the Central\r\nBank to introduce transparency in the management of\r\nthe foreign exchange regime. The United States\r\nTreasury Department is engaged with us in financial\r\nsector reforms, particularly in the areas of monetary\r\npolicy, revenue enhancement, budgeting and\r\nexpenditure controls. Also, the United States State\r\nDepartment is working with the Forestry Development\r\nAuthority in implementing an environment-friendly\r\nforestry reform programme.\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nGiven all these efforts, we once again appeal to\r\nthe Security Council to lift the sanctions to enable us to\r\ncreate jobs and to attend to the enormous social needs\r\nof our people.\r\nIn early February, the United Nations, in\r\ncollaboration with the World Bank and the United\r\nStates Government, co-hosted a donors conference for\r\nLiberia. The aim of the conference was to seek support\r\nfor our two-year reconstruction plan. The international\r\ncommunity responded generously with pledges of $520\r\nmillion. I am happy to report that, to date, $455 million\r\nof those pledges have been classified as firm\r\ncommitments. Projects are under way to spend those\r\nfunds and to bring much needed relief to our people.\r\nElections in Liberia are not new, but most have\r\nbeen characterized by widespread rigging. Thus, unfair\r\nelections in themselves have been a major source of\r\nconflict in Liberia. This time around, Liberians are\r\ndetermined to undertake free and fair elections as an\r\nequity participation in the investment of sustainable\r\npeace and national renewal. The Transitional\r\nGovernment remains committed to the holding of\r\nelections in October 2005 and to the smooth transfer of\r\npower to a democratically elected Government in\r\nJanuary 2006.\r\nLiberia has developed strong collaborative efforts\r\nwith our neighbours in the Mano River Union to end\r\nthe activities of armed non-State actors. The Mano\r\nRiver Union countries have committed themselves to\r\nstrictly adhering to the Non-Aggression and Security\r\nCooperation Treaty of the Union and the meticulous\r\nimplementation of the fifteenth protocol. Liberia\r\nreiterates its commitment to cooperating with all\r\nprovisions on security and peace as enshrined in the\r\ncharters of the United Nations, the African Union, the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States and the\r\nMano River Union.\r\nWe call on the United Nations to urgently engage\r\nin crisis prevention and in strengthening the peace in\r\nour region. In that regard, we urge this body to work\r\nwith regional and subregional organizations, such as\r\nthe African Union and ECOWAS.\r\nToday more than ever before, the utility of the\r\nUnited Nations is being tested. Never before has the\r\nworld faced so many different types of conflicts in so\r\nmany different places at the same time. However, we\r\nare encouraged by the fact that the high number and\r\ncomplexity of those problems have not lessened the\r\ndetermination of Member States to stay the course of\r\nfostering international peace and stability.\r\nThe threat posed by global terrorism, combined\r\nwith widespread poverty, especially in developing\r\ncountries, constitutes a real barrier to the attainment of\r\nthe Millennium Goals.\r\nThe continued existence of conflicts in the\r\nMiddle East provides a source of worry. After decades,\r\nit is time that a workable solution be found to the\r\nIsraeli-Palestinian issue.\r\nThe current Iraqi crisis is also troubling to a\r\nworld body searching for solutions to world conflicts.\r\nLiberia calls for a unified global approach to the Iraqi\r\nquestion and urges the United Nations to play an active\r\nrole in the resolution of that crisis.\r\nIn Africa, news from the Darfur region in Sudan\r\nis frightening. We support the position of the African\r\nUnion on the Darfur problem and ask for a speedy\r\nresolution of the crisis so as to bring relief to the\r\nregion.\r\nThe recent massacre of nearly 200 Tutsi in\r\nBurundi sends a grim reminder of the 1994 genocide in\r\nRwanda. Urgent action should be taken to contain the\r\nsituation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nMaking peace is difficult because the resolution\r\nof conflicts sometimes engenders new contradictions\r\nthat must be addressed. In post-conflict situations like\r\nours, where national capacities have been decimated,\r\nthe continued goodwill of the international community\r\nto assist in reconstruction is paramount. We thus pray\r\nfor the continued engagement of the United Nations in\r\nglobal crises.\r\nLiberia has gone through 15 years of violent\r\nconflicts. In Accra, Ghana, in 2003, Liberians reasoned\r\ntogether to reject war and build a better society. Liberia\r\nis now breaking through from being a failed State to\r\nbeing a democratic and vibrant society. There is now a\r\ngrowing sense of hope and optimism among our\r\npeople. We cannot fail now, for we have seen the cost\r\nof war as compared to the price of peace. Liberians\r\nhave finally resolved to choose the path of peace and\r\nstay on it.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Chairman of\r\nthe National Transitional Government of the Republic\r\nof Liberia for the statement he has just made.\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nMr. Charles Gyude Bryant, Chairman of the\r\nNational Transitional Government of the\r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Carlos Mesa Gisbert, President of\r\nthe Republic of Bolivia\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Bolivia.\r\nMr. Carlos Mesa Gisbert, President of the\r\nRepublic of Bolivia, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Carlos Mesa\r\nGisbert, President of the Republic of Bolivia, and to\r\ninvite him to address the General Assembly.\r\nPresident Mesa Gisbert (spoke in Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of Bolivia, I wish to express a concern that is\r\nglobal: the issue of terrorism. A world that is haunted\r\nby terrorism is an insecure world, one whose prospects\r\nare threatened. Bolivia believes that the fight against\r\nterrorism is one of the most important tasks we need to\r\nundertake together. The incident in Beslan in the\r\nRussian Federation demonstrates how far it is possible\r\nto go in brutal actions that are entirely divorced from\r\nany sense of humanity.\r\nThe fight against terrorism must also be linked to\r\nthe struggle against other scourges of concern to us all.\r\nIn that context, Bolivia affirms its most resolute\r\ncommitment to the fight against drug trafficking, which\r\nin our country is being waged through the eradication\r\nof excess coca, undertaken with respect for the nation’s\r\ntradition of consumption. That joint task could not be\r\nfulfilled without the presence and support of the\r\ninternational community and in the context of shared\r\nresponsibility. Shared responsibility requires clear\r\naction to be taken on both sides of the chain of\r\nproduction to eliminate the scourge of drug trafficking.\r\nShared responsibility requires the social and the\r\neconomic issues to be considered when addressing the\r\nproblem.\r\nBolivia has elaborated the idea of alternative\r\ndevelopment, which we would wish to see converted\r\ninto comprehensive development. In other words, the\r\nparticipation of the communities and villages where\r\ncoca is produced in Bolivia should be part of the\r\ndecision-making process and of the design of strategies\r\nto modify current practices of cultivation and to\r\ngenerate reasonable economic options, to open\r\nmarkets, and to reduce the costs of intervention to the\r\ninternational community in the eradication of coca, and\r\nin particular in the process of seeking viable alternative\r\nways for the Bolivian economy.\r\nWe believe that the fight against the scourges that\r\nare currently stalemating humankind could not be\r\nwaged without a multilateral response to the challenges\r\nto modern society. We firmly believe in multilateralism\r\nand strongly support the United Nations as the arena of\r\nthat multilateralism. We are convinced that the time\r\nhas come to produce a series of comprehensive reforms\r\nin the Organization as a whole. That would require,\r\ninter alia, an expansion of the Security Council at the\r\nonset of a new historic era. As the challenges have\r\nchanged, so too must the responses.\r\nIn that context, we are convinced that another\r\naspect to be thoroughly reviewed is the paradigm of\r\nglobal development, which is unsustainable over time\r\nand will not allow for long-term responses, but which\r\nwill instead generate complex problems that cannot be\r\nresolved. A change in the development paradigm\r\nrequires openness of mind and a heterodox capacity to\r\nrespond to the basic parameters in which the world\r\neconomy functions today, without demagogic\r\nresponses or utopian solutions. On the contrary, we\r\nneed to ponder such issues as hunger, poverty and\r\nexclusion, which afflict millions of human beings on\r\nour planet.\r\nThis is a good opportunity to recall that, over the\r\npast year, Bolivia has experienced a particularly\r\ndifficult situation. In October 2003, a social, political\r\nand economic crisis pushed our nation to the brink of\r\nconfrontation and violence, with unforeseeable\r\nconsequences. The crisis threatened all of our\r\ninstitutions, and in particular our democratic system.\r\nThe Bolivian response to that crisis was issued\r\npeacefully, in respect for democracy, through a\r\nmechanism of constitutional succession that allowed\r\nme, as Vice-President, to take office as President and to\r\nassume the enormous challenges to the country in order\r\nto restore order, peace and the prospects and hopes of\r\nour society.\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nWhy did this crisis occur in Bolivia? It happened\r\nbecause of an accumulation of historic arrears that, at\r\nsome point, had to be paid for by our society. Those\r\narrears included exclusion, discrimination, a vision of\r\nBolivian society rife with racism, and truly dreadful\r\npoverty. The efforts undertaken by the country on the\r\nbasis of a liberal economic model and of a structural\r\nadjustment model had their highs and lows. Positive\r\nresults allowed for macroeconomic stability, but\r\ngenuinely inadequate results in the social sphere were\r\nthe outcome primarily of exhaustion and the need for\r\ndifferent responses. All of those historical arrears fell\r\ndue in October, leading to a popular upheaval that\r\nended in social turmoil, calling not only for a short-\r\nterm response — ours, I believe, was effective in that\r\ndemocracy and peace were preserved — but also and\r\nabove all for a forward-looking solution.\r\nWhat are the major challenges facing Bolivia\r\ntoday in its geographical, historical and geopolitical\r\ncontexts? It must first resolve its own conflict between\r\nsociety and State and the challenges of its own\r\neconomic growth. One of the country’s key issues was\r\nthe definition of an energy policy once we learned that\r\nour nation has one of the largest reserves of natural gas\r\nin South America.\r\nWe chose a path that was difficult, yet attractive,\r\nand that marked our desire for democratic participation\r\nand participative democracy — please forgive the\r\nwordplay — within our society. We opted for a binding\r\nreferendum in which the people of Bolivia were able to\r\ndecide what they wished to do with their most\r\nimportant energy resources. The referendum\r\nhighlighted our will to participate and to define our\r\nown destiny. It was successfully held on 18 July. It\r\ntook place in a framework of peace, of democratic\r\nparticipation and of clear and convincing responses\r\nthat allowed our Government to move forward with a\r\nhydrocarbons and natural gas policy that regulates\r\nexport, industrialization and relations with investors\r\nand investment companies that are appropriate and\r\nuseful to our nation.\r\nIn this forum, I wish to affirm our belief in a\r\nconstructive and mutually beneficial relationship\r\nbetween private investors in Bolivia and the\r\nrepresentatives of the State. Perhaps one of the most\r\nimportant lessons of recent years is that we must\r\nneither revert to the old system of State capitalism of\r\nthe 1950s and 1960s, nor pursue the rigid orthodoxy of\r\nthe liberal vision.\r\nThe answer for today is a practical combination\r\nwithin the false distinction between the market and the\r\nState. That distinction must be abolished and the\r\ncombination made viable without exclusions and\r\nwithout jeopardizing the fundamental concept, in\r\nwhich we believe, that legal security is guaranteed by\r\nthe rule of law. That is the path on which we have\r\nembarked as we work to adopt new hydrocarbons\r\nlegislation.\r\nPerhaps the most important thing for Bolivia in\r\nthe coming months, however, is to reach a new social\r\ncovenant. While the relationship between society and\r\nthe State has been severely damaged and threatened by\r\ncollapse, it is clear that the concept of democratic\r\nparticipation has to be reflected in that covenant\r\nthrough a constituent assembly, freely elected to define\r\nthe outline of the country that we wish to build in the\r\nimmediate future.\r\nGiven that my Government has no political party\r\nor organized presence in that context, we shall convene\r\na constituent assembly that is truly pluralistic and in\r\nwhich the elements of our Magna Carta will be\r\nprovided by various social sectors yet respond to a\r\nsingle basic concept: an end to exclusion and\r\ndiscrimination; the option — in a country where the\r\nmajority is of indigenous Quechua, Aymara or Guaraní\r\norigin — for the majority to express itself; and the\r\ndefinition, in a democratic context and in the\r\nframework of distinct regions and distinct visions, of\r\nthe profile of a viable nation.\r\nI also wish to note that we achieved something\r\nvery important after the crisis: the restoration of peace\r\nthrough transparent, honest and austere action that\r\nBolivia urgently needed. This does not mean that the\r\ntask is done. The struggle against corruption will\r\nalways be a challenge in our country, as it is elsewhere\r\nin the world, but I believe that we have demonstrated a\r\nclear commitment that has given us credibility and\r\nlegitimacy in our society.\r\nTransparency, honesty and austerity are vital\r\nelements in a poor nation that must administer\r\nappropriately and efficiently the meagre resources at its\r\ndisposal. In that context, I wish here at the United\r\nNations to thank the international community, which\r\nwas consistent and unified in its support for Bolivia\r\nduring the crisis and in the following months, helping\r\nus to implement a consistent macroeconomic policy to\r\nresolve such serious issues as its heavy fiscal deficit.\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nGiven its geographical location at the centre of\r\nour continent, Bolivia should be a pivotal country in\r\nthe fast-paced process of integration. That process has\r\ntwo major protagonists: the Andean Community, of\r\nwhich we are a member, and the Southern Common\r\nMarket, of which we are an associate member. At first,\r\nwe were a “hinge” country, but we are now in the\r\nprocess of integration that will gradually encompass a\r\nlarge bloc of South American nations, which we\r\nwelcome and towards which we are striving.\r\nIn that context of coordination and integration,\r\nBolivia holds a key play in any process of\r\ninfrastructure development. In energy, Bolivia is a\r\ncountry that can serve as South America’s energy\r\ndistribution hub. In telecommunications — fibre optics\r\nin particular — and, of course, in highway\r\ninfrastructure, we are vital and must be an actor that\r\nfacilitates rather than obstructs.\r\nI wish to share a thought here with such\r\nmultilateral entities as the World Bank, the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and other organizations\r\nthat are cooperating with Bolivia and other developing\r\ncountries.\r\nBecause of its revenues and high level of debt,\r\nBolivia has been considered to be a heavily indebted\r\npoor country. In theory, that has given it a series of\r\nadvantages in debt servicing and, above all, in the\r\nchannelling of that servicing not towards repayment,\r\nbut towards social services. Paradoxically, however,\r\nthis has limited the country’s capacity to obtain non-\r\nconcessional loans that would allow us to implement\r\ninfrastructure projects that are of interest not only to\r\nBolivia, but to all countries of the region.\r\nWe believe that we must begin to look differently\r\nat the way international organizations interpret those\r\nloans in order to make them more flexible and to avoid\r\nthe paradox whereby an advantage becomes a burden\r\nthat makes development impossible. We hope that this\r\nnew approach will be grasped by the international\r\ncommunity, and in particular by the multilateral\r\norganizations.\r\nLastly, I wish to broach a subject that we will\r\nalways stress in our statements before the world\r\ncommunity. Bolivia’s landlocked status is a factor that\r\nhas curbed our development. Bolivia was born as an\r\nindependent country with a coastline on the Pacific\r\nOcean. Today, we demand free, useful and sovereign\r\naccess to that Ocean. Our demand has moral, historical\r\nand legal bases and is linked to the high economic cost\r\nthat has made development difficult throughout our\r\nhistory. We make this demand, and I want to emphasize\r\nthis, on the basis of a logic of construction — a logic\r\nof integration.\r\nChile and Bolivia are countries that complement\r\neach other. We are countries that have a destiny of\r\nshared development and integration. To fail to find a\r\nsolution to the Bolivian issue is to negate the\r\npossibility of development and integration and prevent\r\nit from becoming a reality.\r\nBolivia is prepared to undertake an open dialogue\r\nin order to find an appropriate and definitive solution\r\nto the problem. That is all the more true today because\r\nSouth American integration is so close at hand, and\r\nbecause Bolivia’s maritime problem has become an\r\nobstacle on the path to that integration.\r\nWe are expressing a rational, constructive\r\ndesire — a will for integration. Our demand is\r\nunchanging and has profound relevance in the context\r\nof everything I said earlier.\r\nI should like to conclude by stating here, before\r\nthe nations of the world, that our country is one of\r\npeace that believes in disarmament. It believes also\r\nthat we need to reflect on and change many of the\r\nparadigms which in the course of time have\r\ncrystallized certain positions and have limited the\r\nopen-mindedness that we need today, more than ever,\r\nin the twenty-first century, in order to face the\r\nchallenges of the future.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of Bolivia for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Carlos Mesa Gisbert, President of the\r\nRepublic of Bolivia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Kessai Note, President of the\r\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands.\r\nMr. Kessai Note, President of the Republic of the\r\nMarshall Islands, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Kessai Note,\r\nPresident of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and\r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Note: I am honoured to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session on behalf of\r\nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands.\r\nAllow me to extend my congratulations to you,\r\nMr. President, on your election, and to wish you well in\r\nyour endeavours throughout this session.\r\nThis year has seen important landmarks for the\r\nMarshall Islands at the domestic level. On 1 May we\r\ncelebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption\r\nof our Constitution. The same day also marked the\r\nentry into force of our amended Compact of Free\r\nAssociation with the United States. The renewal of that\r\nagreement reaffirms the special relationship between\r\nour two countries.\r\nAt the regional level, we continue to place great\r\nimportance on our membership in the Pacific Islands\r\nForum. Over the past year, the Forum has conducted a\r\ncomprehensive review of existing regional\r\nmechanisms. Last month Pacific leaders met in Samoa,\r\nwhere they endorsed the terms of reference of a new\r\nPacific Plan, which will develop a strategy for broader\r\nregional cooperation based on the key goals of\r\neconomic growth, sustainable development, good\r\ngovernance and security.\r\nAt the international level, the Marshall Islands\r\nreaffirms its solidarity with the Alliance of Small\r\nIsland States (AOSIS), which continues to act as a\r\npowerful voice for small island developing States.\r\nIt has long been recognized that small island\r\ndeveloping States suffer from unique vulnerabilities\r\nand disadvantages. In January 2005, the international\r\ncommunity will meet in Mauritius to conduct the\r\n10-year review of the Barbados Programme of Action\r\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States. Over the past year, members of\r\nAOSIS have been engaged in a detailed process of\r\npreparation for the international meeting. At an\r\ninterregional meeting in January, small island\r\ndeveloping States adopted the AOSIS Strategy for the\r\nFurther Implementation of the Barbados Programme of\r\nAction, which addresses critical issues including\r\nclimate change and sea-level rise, renewable energy,\r\ntrade access and others.\r\nIt is vital that we maintain the momentum in the\r\nlead-up to Mauritius in order to ensure a successful\r\noutcome for small island developing States. I\r\nencourage the international community to become\r\nengaged in the ongoing preparatory process and to\r\nparticipate in the international meeting at the highest\r\nlevel. It is our fervent hope that the meeting will\r\nproduce practical outcomes that will assist small island\r\ndeveloping States in implementing the Programme of\r\nAction to benefit people at the local level.\r\nIn this increasingly globalized world, the\r\nMarshall Islands faces challenges shared by many\r\nother small island States. Our environment is extremely\r\nvulnerable to the effects of climate change and natural\r\ndisasters; our small population faces the challenge of\r\nmanaging high levels of major diseases such as\r\ndiabetes, and the risk of the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS\r\nand other sexually transmitted diseases; and our limited\r\nresource base and remoteness restrict our ability to\r\nintegrate into the global economy.\r\nWith these challenges in mind, the Marshall\r\nIslands is particularly concerned about the following\r\nissues.\r\nFirst, regarding sustainable development, the\r\nMarshall Islands has developed a national sustainable\r\ndevelopment strategy, and we are in the process of\r\nestablishing a task force to ensure that the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals are fully integrated into our\r\nnational strategy. In striving to achieve internationally\r\nagreed development goals, we are severely constrained\r\nby our lack of human and technical resources. Thus we\r\ncontinue to seek to form partnerships that will assist us\r\nthrough capacity-building and technology transfer.\r\nWe were pleased that the twelfth session of the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development focused on\r\nwater, sanitation and human settlements. We in the\r\nPacific region are working hard to improve access to\r\nfresh water and to develop environmentally responsible\r\nwaste-management systems. We seek the support of the\r\ninternational community to assist us in the\r\nimplementation of regional projects such as the Pacific\r\nRegional Action Plan on Sustainable Water\r\nManagement. We look forward to the thirteenth session\r\nof the Commission’s providing further policy guidance\r\nin these areas.\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nAn ongoing issue of the utmost concern for the\r\npeople of the Marshall Islands is that of nuclear-\r\nweapon testing. Between 1946 and 1958, the United\r\nStates conducted a series of nuclear tests in the\r\nMarshall Islands, which included the detonation of 23\r\natomic and hydrogen bombs. On 1 March this year we\r\ncommemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the Bravo\r\ntest at Bikini atoll. The Bravo blast was 1,000 times\r\nmore powerful than Hiroshima, and its fallout spread\r\nradioactive debris across the neighbouring islands.\r\nToday, many of our people continue to suffer\r\nfrom the long-term health effects, while others remain\r\ndisplaced from their homes because of ongoing\r\ncontamination. We urge the United States Government\r\nto fully address the issue of adequate compensation for\r\npopulations affected by the nuclear testing programme\r\nand to fulfil its responsibilities regarding the safe\r\nresettlement of displaced populations.\r\nOn broader issues of disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation, we urge the international community to\r\nretain a focus on disarmament by the nuclear-weapon\r\nStates, as well as on non-proliferation measures. We\r\nlook forward to next year’s Review Conference of the\r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons, and we hope that the Conference\r\nwill produce substantial progress on the 13 steps\r\ntowards complete nuclear disarmament.\r\nI wish to reiterate our critical concern regarding\r\nclimate change. Along with other low-lying island\r\nnations, we are most vulnerable to the impacts of\r\nclimate change. We are already experiencing these\r\ndramatic effects: sea levels are rising, weather patterns\r\nare changing and coral reef systems are being harmed.\r\nUrgent action is needed at the global level to halt and\r\nultimately reverse the devastating impact of climate\r\nchange. Without such global action, our national efforts\r\nat sustainable development will ultimately be rendered\r\nmeaningless.\r\nWhile we are committed to playing our part,\r\nstrong leadership is required by the major\r\nindustrialized countries. We renew our support for the\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the\r\nKyoto Protocol, and we call upon all States that have\r\nnot yet done so — in particular the major emitters — to\r\nratify the Protocol without further delay. We also call\r\nupon the international community to assist small island\r\ndeveloping States in developing and implementing\r\ncomprehensive adaptation strategies.\r\nAs a nation whose livelihood depends on the\r\nresources of the sea, we are becoming increasingly\r\nconcerned about the state of the world’s oceans and\r\nfish stocks. At the regional level, we cooperate closely\r\nwith other members of the Pacific Islands Forum to\r\nensure that the oceans and marine resources in our\r\nregion are managed in a responsible and sustainable\r\nmanner. The Pacific Islands Regional Ocean Policy,\r\nadopted in 2002, will be implemented throughout the\r\nregion under a recently developed framework for\r\nintegrated strategic action. Another notable\r\nachievement in the region is the entry into force of the\r\nConvention on the Conservation and Management of\r\nHighly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and\r\nCentral Pacific Ocean.\r\nWhile such developments are encouraging, we\r\nreiterate our concerns regarding the prevalence of\r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Like many\r\nother small island developing States, we rely on\r\nfisheries resources as a primary means of survival, yet\r\nwe lack the capacity to adequately monitor our\r\nexclusive economic zone. Regional and international\r\ncooperation must focus on addressing the problem of\r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and\r\nassisting small island developing States by building\r\ncapacity for monitoring and surveillance.\r\nI have briefly mentioned a few of the major\r\npriorities for the Marshall Islands. There are, of course,\r\nmany other important issues to be addressed during the\r\nupcoming session.\r\nInternational terrorism is obviously one of the\r\nbiggest challenges facing the global community today.\r\nThe reality is that no State or region is immune. All\r\nStates must take action at the national level and must\r\ncooperate at the regional and international levels to\r\nensure that we combat terrorist threats with\r\ncomprehensive and unified action. Within the Pacific\r\nregion, we continue to cooperate closely to ensure that\r\neffective regional action is taken to combat threats to\r\npeace and security. At the national level, we are in the\r\nprocess of implementing the 12 core anti-terrorism\r\nconventions and the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions, and we have taken many steps to combat\r\nmoney laundering and terrorist financing.\r\nThe Marshall Islands, as a State party to the\r\nRome Statute, welcomes the ongoing progress of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. We are pleased that the\r\nCourt is now fully operational and has begun its first\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\ninvestigations. We are confident that the Court will\r\nplay a valuable role in the administration of justice at\r\nthe international level, and we urge those States that\r\nhave not yet done so to become parties.\r\nAnother issue requiring action by this body is the\r\ncontinued exclusion of Taiwan from the United\r\nNations. Taiwan is a peace-loving, sovereign State, and\r\nonly its democratically elected Government can be the\r\nlegitimate representative of the interests of the people\r\nof Taiwan within the United Nations. The Marshall\r\nIslands reiterates its full support for the ongoing quest\r\nof the people of Taiwan to be granted membership in\r\nthis global body and in various other international\r\norganizations.\r\nFinally, the Marshall Islands reiterates its support\r\nfor the expansion of the Security Council in both\r\ncategories of membership. We support the allocation of\r\na new permanent seat to Japan, and we believe that the\r\nrepresentation on the Council of developing countries\r\nmust be increased. Such expansion is crucial if the\r\nCouncil is to retain its legitimacy.\r\nMy delegation looks forward, Mr. President, to a\r\nproductive session under your able leadership.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Kessai Note, President of the Republic of the\r\nMarshall Islands, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Arnold Rüütel, President of the\r\nRepublic of Estonia\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Estonia.\r\nMr. Arnold Rüütel, President of the Republic of\r\nEstonia, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Arnold Rüütel,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Estonia, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rüütel (spoke in Estonian; English\r\ntext provided by the delegation): First of all, allow me\r\nto congratulate you on your election to the office of the\r\nPresident of the fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly. I wish you every success and all the best in\r\nyour very important work. I would also like to thank\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, for his leadership\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session.\r\nThe current session is very significant for\r\nEstonia, since it is the first time ever that we\r\nparticipate at the General Assembly as a member State\r\nof the European Union and the NATO. We are\r\ntherefore more aware than ever before of our shared\r\nresponsibility for the world, but also of our\r\nvulnerability to global threats.\r\nDuring the last few years, we have all witnessed\r\nnew threats to world peace and security. We have also\r\nseen how these threats are all connected to economic,\r\nsocial, cultural and humanitarian problems. The fifty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly focused on the\r\nsituation in Iraq. However, securing peace and stability\r\nin the Middle East remains an ongoing concern. I hope\r\nthat all of this has only deepened our conviction that\r\nthe goals and principles of the United Nations Charter\r\nhave not really lost their topicality but rather, are even\r\nmore topical now. In today’s world of new threats and\r\nchanging global security, we need shared solutions\r\nmore than ever before. The United Nations is the only\r\norganization established to coordinate, on a global\r\nscale, the efforts of States in safeguarding international\r\nstability and security. The United Nations has to be\r\neven more decisive and efficient in order to\r\nsuccessfully fulfil its important responsibilities in this\r\nnew situation.\r\nThe reduction of world poverty continues to be a\r\ncentral issue on the global development agenda; less\r\npoverty would certainly mean more international\r\nstability and security. The international community has\r\nmade a commitment to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals by the year 2015, halving poverty\r\nin the world by that time. That is a very optimistic\r\npromise indeed, and it assumes that all countries must\r\nperform even more purposefully and in an even more\r\ncoordinated manner. High-level meetings in Doha,\r\nMonterrey and Johannesburg have shown us the way;\r\nnow, we must act.\r\nAt the forthcoming 2005 summit, we will review\r\nour progress in fulfilling the goals set out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. I would like to appeal to all of\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nus here to work so that we would be content with the\r\nconclusions in the interim report.\r\nTogether with other United Nations Member\r\nStates, Estonia shares responsibility for balanced\r\ndevelopment in the world and makes its contribution\r\ntowards achieving the common goals. Only recently,\r\nwe were one of the recipient countries of international\r\naid. Now that we are one of the donors, we are very\r\nmuch aware of how important it is that international\r\naid be coordinated and harmonized. We began\r\nproviding international aid in 1998. Time has shown\r\nthat the Estonian experience in building up democratic\r\ninstitutions, implementing economic reforms and\r\ninvolving civil society in public life and decision-\r\nmaking can really help other countries where such\r\nprocesses are still in their initial stage.\r\nDespite the work that has already been done to\r\nachieve the very challenging Millennium Development\r\nGoals, we must admit, unfortunately, that the gap\r\nbetween the rich and the poor is widening. What is\r\nmore, it is taking new forms in our changing world. In\r\naddition to economic inequality, the information era\r\nhas brought about the so-called digital divide, a divide\r\nbetween information-rich and information-poor States\r\nand nations as well as social groups. I would like to\r\nbriefly elaborate on this topic.\r\nIn spite of the rapid development in information\r\ntechnology over the last ten years, only a small group\r\nof privileged countries and social groups have\r\nbenefited from the so-called digital revolution. For\r\nexample, let us consider access to the Internet. Many of\r\nus cannot really imagine life without the Internet, but\r\nfour-fifths of the world population have never had any\r\ncontact with the Internet. More than a half of Internet\r\nusers live in Europe or in North America, which\r\ntogether represent only 17 per cent of the world’s\r\npopulation. In Africa, only 1.4 per cent of the\r\npopulation uses the Internet.\r\nThe digital divide exists not only between\r\ncountries but also within countries, between different\r\nsocial groups. The causes of such a divide can be age,\r\ngender, language, education or income. The digital\r\ndivide is a reflection of technological, social and\r\neconomic backwardness, perhaps due to a lack of\r\ninfrastructure or to that infrastructure being very\r\nexpensive. At the same time, the digital divide is not\r\nonly an expression of existing socio-economic\r\ninequality, but also amplifies it and even causes it.\r\nToday, the social and economic value of access to\r\ninformation is much higher than it was 20 years ago.\r\nUnequal access to know-how, information networks\r\nand opportunities to contribute to these networks, will,\r\nin the longer term, lead to a further marginalization of\r\npoor countries and poor social groups. Paradoxically,\r\nthe very same Internet is behind this marginalization,\r\nalthough it is supposed to be the cheapest and most\r\nefficient way to exchange information and knowledge\r\nin the world.\r\nSince information technology has a strong impact\r\non economic growth and competitiveness, there is no\r\ndoubt that it is a new factor in development policy.\r\nThat is why in recent years, more and more attention\r\nhas focused on the causes and consequences of the\r\ndigital divide. For example, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme’s Human Development\r\nReport 2001 concentrated on those problems and was\r\nthe centre of attention at the 2003 World Summit on\r\nthe Information Society in Geneva.\r\nI am very pleased that Estonia has, in a relatively\r\nshort period of time, achieved a remarkable level in\r\nseveral areas of information technology. We have\r\nmanaged to create a favourable environment for\r\ndevelopment in this field and have ensured that the\r\nnecessary infrastructure has been created through close\r\ncooperation between the public sector and the private\r\nsector, businesses and non-governmental organizations.\r\nAs a result of this, Estonian citizens of limited means\r\nnow have access to several information society\r\nservices. According to “The Economist”, as of 2004,\r\nEstonia ranks 26th in the world in e-readiness and\r\nholds a leading position among Central and Eastern\r\nEuropean countries. More than half the Estonian\r\npopulation regularly uses the Internet; 38 per cent own\r\ncomputers; 80 per cent own mobile phones; 62 per cent\r\nuse Internet banking; and 59 per cent fill out their tax\r\nreturns electronically. Estonians can communicate with\r\nboth the central Government and local governments\r\nover the Internet and are able to use legally binding\r\ndigital signatures. All those indicators are in line with\r\nEuropean Union averages even though Estonia’s gross\r\ndomestic product remains considerably lower than the\r\nEuropean average.\r\nI believe that, as a former country in transition,\r\nEstonia has experiences which could be very useful for\r\ndeveloping countries with respect to the promotion of\r\ninformation and communication technologies. Estonia\r\nis in a position to provide development assistance, first\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nand foremost in the form of know-how. We have\r\nalready taken steps in that direction: in the summer of\r\n2002 the Government of Estonia, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and the Information\r\nProgramme of the Open Society Institute jointly set up\r\nthe Estonian e-Governance Academy. The purpose of\r\nthat unique Academy is to improve the public-private\r\ncooperation in the information and communication\r\ntechnologies. The initial beneficiaries of the project are\r\nCentral and Eastern European countries, countries of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States and Asian\r\ncountries, but we already have future plans for African\r\ncountries as well. The e-Governance Academy has\r\nalready held training courses for officials from\r\nKyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, Albania, Kazakhstan and other\r\ncountries.\r\nThe year 2004 is the final year of the\r\nInternational Decade of the World’s Indigenous People.\r\nI am an Estonian, and as an Estonian I have a specific\r\nreason to talk about indigenous peoples: we are a\r\nnation that knows how important it is to preserve and\r\ndevelop our culture and language. Therefore, I am very\r\nhappy that recent decades have seen increased\r\nmomentum in the activities of the United Nations and\r\nits agencies to protect the rights of indigenous peoples.\r\nBut the approaching end of the International\r\nDecade of the World’s Indigenous People must not\r\nmean diminished attention to the situation of\r\nindigenous peoples. The rights of indigenous peoples\r\nmust be codified in international law without further\r\ndelay. Estonia firmly supports the speedy formulation\r\nand adoption of a declaration on the rights of\r\nindigenous peoples. Regardless of the progress that has\r\nbeen made locally, many of the world’s peoples remain\r\nuncertain about the preservation of their cultures and\r\nlanguages. Restrictions on the rights of indigenous\r\npeoples are one of the reasons behind the emergence of\r\nhot spots and crises.\r\nMr. Dauth (Australia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nScientists enter endangered species into a Red\r\nBook in order to help save them from extinction. But\r\nwe do not yet have a Red Book of peoples. When a\r\nspecies of wildlife disappears, nature becomes poorer\r\nand the ecological balance can be damaged. By the\r\nsame token, the extinction of a people means that the\r\nwhole world becomes intellectually and culturally\r\npoorer.\r\nAnthropologists have used the concept of the\r\n“fourth world” to refer to the ever increasing\r\nmarginalization of indigenous peoples and the\r\ndeterioration of their living conditions. The living\r\nconditions of Finno-Ugric peoples in their historic\r\nhomelands provide a worrying example. The Council\r\nof Europe Parliamentary Assembly has expressed its\r\nconcerns in that respect. In August this year, the fourth\r\nWorld Congress of the Finno-Ugric Peoples took place\r\nin Estonia under the motto “Youth is our future.” The\r\nfinal document of the Congress expressed concern\r\nabout the ongoing loss of national identity by Finno-\r\nUgric peoples and called on the international\r\ncommunity to devote greater attention to the protection\r\nof human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples\r\nand national minorities.\r\nI would like finally to touch upon the future of\r\nthe United Nations. The United Nations needs to be\r\nstrengthened and improved: it needs to be reorganized\r\nso that it can better respond to new challenges.\r\nReorganization and increased efficiency would make\r\nthe Organization more reliable and provide it with\r\ngreater authority. Here, all Member States share a\r\ncommon goal: to ensure the steady development of the\r\nUnited Nations and to effect reforms that would\r\nenhance its effectiveness as a multilateral organization.\r\nEstonia firmly supports that process.\r\nI believe that greater attention should be devoted\r\nto the prevention of crises and conflicts. We await the\r\npublication on 1 December of the report of the High-\r\nLevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, which\r\ncould provide essential guidelines for making the\r\nUnited Nations function more efficiently in the\r\nchanged global framework.\r\nThanks to the efforts of Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan and the President of the fifty-eighth session,\r\nJulian Hunte, and thanks to the cooperation of Member\r\nStates, discussions on revitalization of the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly have yielded concrete and desirable\r\nresults, reflected in resolution 58/316, adopted on\r\n1 July. That resolution is an essential landmark in the\r\nprocess of changing and modernizing the General\r\nAssembly to keep pace with developments in world\r\nevents. At the fifty-ninth session, under the presidency\r\nof Mr. Jean Ping, we must continue and intensify our\r\nefforts in that direction.\r\nFinally, it is also high time that we moved\r\nforward with reform of the Security Council, which\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nwould enable the United Nations to participate more\r\neffectively in resolving world problems and crises.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Estonia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Arnold Rüütel, President of the Republic of\r\nEstonia, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Martín Torrijos, President of the\r\nRepublic of Panama\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of\r\nPanama.\r\nMr. Martín Torrijos, President of the Republic of\r\nPanama, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Martín Torrijos, President\r\nof the Republic of Panama, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Torrijos (spoke in Spanish): I wish to\r\nbegin by warmly congratulating Mr. Jean Ping,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Gabon, on his election\r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nninth session. I wish also to extend my country’s\r\nthanks to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\r\nthe powerful and inspiring words he spoke yesterday\r\n(see A/59/PV.3).\r\nThousands of my compatriots are today suffering\r\nunder the blows of nature. Floods of a kind never\r\nbefore seen have brought grief to many families. The\r\nentire country has turned to the victims in a truly\r\nmoving display of solidarity. With my heart in Panama\r\nwith the victims and their families, I have come to the\r\nUnited Nations, because the tragedy unfolding in my\r\ncountry highlights more than ever the need to tackle\r\nthe problem of poverty urgently.\r\nThe United Nations was conceived as a way of\r\npreventing war and restoring peace. Today, all the\r\ncountries of the world have to be able to feel that they\r\ncan come to the United Nations to solve their problems\r\nand not just to discuss them. If that is to happen, the\r\nUnited Nations must reform.\r\nFor some years, from this rostrum, heads of State\r\nand Government have been urging the need for reform,\r\nand the Secretary-General has welcomed that initiative.\r\nI want to join my voice to theirs so that once and for all\r\nwe actually carry out the reform. We cannot afford to\r\nwait any longer or the people of the world will lose\r\nfaith in the United Nations.\r\nWe do not need an organization with a glorious\r\npast. We need an organization with a future, one that\r\ncan tackle the world’s most serious problems. For that\r\nreason it is necessary that the principal organs be more\r\nrepresentative.\r\nThere are political struggles and armed conflicts\r\non every continent. There is no region of the world\r\nwhere peace and harmony reign. Some are regional\r\nconflicts, some are internal ones, but they are no less\r\nbloody for that. And yet, there is one struggle that is\r\nglobal in dimension and that requires global solutions.\r\nI am speaking of the struggle against hunger and\r\npoverty. That was the subject of a 20 September\r\nmeeting of more than 60 world leaders, who were\r\nresolved to tackle it with all the tools available to them.\r\nI need not dwell on the tragic numbers, but I do\r\nendorse what has been said by the moving force of that\r\nmeeting, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, President of Brazil:\r\n“peace can never grow out of poverty and hunger”.\r\nIn Latin America the threat to democracy posed\r\nby military coups has been significantly reduced. It is\r\nno longer army divisions that threaten democracy; it is\r\nthe legions of the poor and the unprotected who can\r\ndestroy democratic institutions if their basic needs are\r\nnot met.\r\nBut then we face a contradiction: the more\r\npoverty there is in a given country, the less likelihood\r\nthere is of being able to defeat it. Countries are crushed\r\nby public debt. Millions of people are being born today\r\nalready owing more than they will earn in their entire\r\nlifetime. Often those debts are the result of past\r\ndeficits, which, owing to excessive bureaucracy, bad\r\nprojects or corruption, produced no tangible benefits\r\nfor the people. The fiscal problems facing most of the\r\ncountries in our region make the situation even worse,\r\nas Governments lack the resources they need to try to\r\nmeet the minimum needs of their people.\r\nThis analysis is not a new one. The “lost decade”\r\nof the 1980s was the result of exactly the same\r\nproblems, although there was also an international\r\neconomic crisis and an absence of democratic\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nlegitimacy in most of the continent at that time. There\r\nare, however, undeniable differences between that\r\nperiod and the present. On the one hand, over the past\r\nfew years unprecedented wealth has been generated,\r\nwhile at the same time the number of poor has grown.\r\nOn the other hand, although more countries are\r\ndemocratic today, there is also a greater amount of\r\ndebate on how to effectively address society’s\r\nimmediate problems.\r\nDemocracy, as a system of government, ended up\r\nbeing conflated with the limitations of individuals,\r\nwhile in truth the problem was that Governments were\r\nunable to produce effective responses. The problem is\r\nthus not democracy; the problem lies with\r\nGovernments.\r\nDirect help to Governments, in the form of loans\r\nor grants, has not been enough or sufficiently effective\r\nto solve the problems of poverty or the lack of growth\r\nthat the aid was supposed to correct. Those of us who\r\nhave the responsibility of governing and trying to\r\nprovide answers cannot forget that, for many, patience\r\nhas yielded to despair. The immediacy of their needs\r\ndemands immediate solutions, which are not always to\r\nhand. That means that we have to speak out clearly\r\nabout the problems, that we have to administer our\r\nStates with transparency and that we have to fight\r\ncorruption in order to win back the trust of people who\r\nare tired of so much deception and frustration.\r\nLatin America needs a new economic agenda, one\r\nnot based at just throwing money at social problems. It\r\nneeds an agenda that seeks to understand the complex\r\nnature of our countries and institutions. Stopping\r\npayments, restructuring, adjustments — that is a road\r\nthat we have been down before, and our region was the\r\nloser.\r\nThe new agenda requires absolute transparency in\r\npublic administration and accountability. But the task\r\nof making public administration more efficient and\r\nmore transparent takes time and resources. But interest\r\non debt builds up, and the needs of a large sector of the\r\npopulation also increase.\r\nProgress in reducing poverty among our peoples\r\nwill require much effort and great resources from the\r\npoor countries; to a degree, creditor countries and\r\nmultilateral agencies could compensate them by\r\nreducing public debt. In that regard, we propose that a\r\nrelief clause be included in the lending programmes of\r\nthe international financial institutions to reduce future\r\ninterest on our public debt if we meet agreed goals on\r\npoverty reduction. That would be one way of\r\ncompensating Governments for their efforts to alleviate\r\npoverty while also allowing them to meet their\r\nfinancial obligations.\r\nIn the past few years, people’s concerns have\r\nshifted dramatically. Cultural heritage, natural wealth,\r\nbiodiversity and animal species threatened with\r\nextinction must all be protected. It seems that\r\nsometimes financial resources are found more easily\r\nfor those issues than for the millions of human beings\r\nwho are dying every day of hunger, or for those who\r\nare barely surviving, unable to live a decent life, and\r\nwithout hope.\r\nI would like to join in the widespread call on the\r\ninternational community to devise and implement bold\r\nand generous approaches to tackle poverty. It is\r\nshameful that in the technological age, when so many\r\nthings have been invented that were unimaginable just\r\n10 years ago, that we have not been able to invent a\r\nway for millions of people in the world to escape from\r\nthe subhuman conditions to which poverty condemns\r\nthem.\r\nSometimes it seems that international aid is\r\nprovided only if there are desperate tragedies or acts of\r\nterrorism. Of course, when nations are victims of\r\nnational disaster or terrorism such international\r\nassistance is necessary and commendable. I would like\r\nto take this opportunity to reiterate Panama’s resolve to\r\ncombat terrorism wherever it may occur. But we must\r\nnot forget that many more people die because of\r\npoverty than in wars or natural disasters.\r\nI am pleased to report that Panama has done its\r\nduty and has stood by the international community in\r\nits efficient and safe management of the Canal. We\r\nshall continue in future to manage that important artery\r\nof international trade in the same way, so that it will\r\nbe, as it has been today, open to shipping from all\r\ncountries of the world.\r\nI will return to my country optimistic, because I\r\nhave seen here a determination to fight poverty. I have\r\nsensed the solidarity of the international community in\r\nthe face of natural disaster and I have renewed my\r\nbelief that when there is the will, when there is faith\r\nand determination, the most difficult tasks can be\r\naccomplished.\r\n29\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Panama for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Martin Torrijos, President of the Republic of\r\nPanama, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Joseph Kabila, President of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the President of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo.\r\nMr. Joseph Kabila, President of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Joseph Kabila, President\r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kabila (spoke in French): At this time,\r\nwhen I have the honour to take the floor before this\r\naugust Assembly, above all I would like to express to\r\nyou, on behalf of the Congolese people as well as on\r\nmy own behalf, my warm congratulations to Mr. Jean\r\nPing on his election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly as well as the election of the members of his\r\nBureau.\r\nI also take this occasion to congratulate and give\r\nmy continued support to Mr. Julian Hunte, the\r\nPresident of the previous General Assembly, for the\r\nsignificant quality of the work he accomplished during\r\na difficult international situation.\r\nThis debate provides me the opportunity to bring\r\nthe message of my country to the world — a message\r\nof peace and national reconciliation — and to express\r\nour vision concerning the violent events taking place in\r\nthe world and the most appropriate way to find lasting\r\nsolutions to those events.\r\nIn that respect, looking back at world\r\ndevelopments, we can only note and deplore the rise in\r\ninternational terrorism in all its forms with its long line\r\nof victims, distress and desolation. This appears to me\r\nto be the appropriate time to announce that my\r\ncountry’s commitment to the ratification of all\r\ninternational legal instruments on terrorism is moving\r\ninto its final phase of adoption. Our aim is to combat\r\nthat scourge which — I repeat — spares no one.\r\nApart from terrorism, the international\r\ncommunity is confronted with the resurgence of other\r\ndisasters which are just as murderous and devastating\r\nand which require us to strengthen our collective\r\nefforts. In particular I am thinking of HIV/AIDS,\r\nmalaria, tuberculosis and other endemic diseases.\r\nThat list of forgotten diseases should not obscure\r\nthe immense poverty and the natural disasters that we\r\nsee throughout the world. Moreover, we must not\r\nforget the areas of tension, civil wars and other armed\r\nconflicts which increase the misery and hopelessness\r\nof humanity and which thus sorely test international\r\npeace and security.\r\nDuring the intersessional period, the situation in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo has been\r\ncharacterized by a process of political transition. In the\r\nlong term, we plan to organize elections which will\r\nenable the Congolese people to freely choose their\r\nleaders. In that respect, I would like to point out that\r\nthat process reached its midway point on 30 June 2004.\r\nIt has thus entered a decisive phase which requires\r\nfrom all institutions of the transition a redoubling of\r\neffort in order to meet the electoral deadlines as laid\r\nout in the global agreement.\r\nToday we can congratulate ourselves on the\r\nfollowing significant progress: the reunification of\r\nnational territory through the setting up of a land\r\ncommission under central authority; national\r\nreconciliation, symbolized by the presence in the\r\nGovernment of former enemies; and the beginning of\r\nthe process of integration of the army and the\r\nestablishment of the national police force.\r\nNevertheless, much remains to be done, including\r\nthe complete restoration of the authority of the State\r\nthroughout the country and the establishment of the\r\nnecessary internal and external conditions for the\r\nholding of the aforementioned elections.\r\nThus, taking into account the desire for peace of\r\nall of the Congolese people, and the determination\r\nexpressed many times by the transitional Government\r\nto respect the deadlines, it is important that we\r\nreinforce, in terms of quality and quantity, the United\r\nNations Organization Mission in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo (MONUC), whose support of\r\nthe forces of order will help us put an end to the\r\n30\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nactivism of the militias which continue to sow death\r\nand desolation in the eastern part of the country. In\r\naddition, given the results obtained by the political\r\nplayers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the\r\nfulfilment of their obligations under the global\r\nagreement, we launch an urgent appeal to the\r\ninternational community and ask it to respect its\r\npromises and commitments in bringing about the\r\nobjectives of the transition.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is a\r\npeace-loving country, resolutely committed to\r\ndeveloping, maintaining and promoting excellent\r\nrelations with all countries dedicated to peace and\r\njustice and particularly, with its neighbours.\r\nAlso the principle of good neighbourliness, far\r\nfrom being a simple slogan, is for us a living and daily\r\nreality. That is why I am happy to see the signature of\r\nthe terms of reference, establishing a joint verification\r\nmechanism on the eastern border of our national\r\nterritory. This will enable us to rebuild trust in relations\r\nin the region, a process which will culminate in the\r\ninternational conference on peace, security and\r\ndevelopment, scheduled to take place shortly.\r\nThe other major task in the Great Lakes region\r\nremains preventing a recurrence of unfortunate events,\r\nsuch as the massacres of the people in Bukuvu, Ituri\r\nand those recently committed in Gatumba, Burundi,\r\nduring which 160 of our fellow citizens tragically lost\r\ntheir lives. This assassination of Congolese refugees on\r\nBurundian soil is the work of the enemies of peace and\r\nof peaceful cohabitation in our subregion. The people\r\nof Congo are waiting impatiently for the report of the\r\ninquiry being prepared under United Nations auspices\r\non this very subject.\r\nI solemnly express the Congolese people’s faith\r\nin the United Nations, which has stood at our side at\r\nthe cost of many sacrifices. We firmly believe in its\r\nability to take even more responsibility on its\r\nshoulders, with a view to the ideas and principles\r\ncontained in the Charter, particularly with regard to its\r\nprocess of revitalization and the adaptation of its\r\nstructures so that it is able to rethink its working\r\nmethods in order that we will see peace, security and\r\npeaceful cohabitation come about among peoples\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nI would like to conclude my statement by\r\nassuring the Assembly of our will to bring to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion, with the help of the whole of the\r\ninternational community, the process of transition\r\nwithin the set deadlines so that the sons and daughters\r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo are able to\r\nlive again in peace and dignity so long denied them\r\nand to which they legitimately have the right.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Joseph Kabila, President of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Valdas Adamkus, President of the\r\nRepublic of Lithuania\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of\r\nLithuania.\r\nMr. Valdas Adamkus, President of the Republic of\r\nLithuania, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Valdas Adamkus,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Lithuania, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Adamkus: Allow me to express my\r\nsincere thanks to the President of the General\r\nAssembly at its previous session, Julian Hunte, whose\r\nable and skilful leadership we enjoyed during the past\r\nsession. I also wish the President at the fifty-ninth\r\nsession, Jean Ping, a year of highly constructive and\r\nsuccessful work.\r\nIt is our common duty to make this fifty-ninth\r\nsession a success and a fitting preparation for the\r\nsixtieth anniversary of the United Nations and the first\r\nhigh-level review of the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, to be held next year. I believe\r\nthese two occasions will offer an excellent framework\r\nfor a serious review of how the changing global\r\nsituation can be met by a renewed United Nations.\r\nThe risks and challenges of the new millennium\r\naffect us all and can be tackled only by common\r\nefforts. Threats such as terrorism recognize no borders,\r\nno differentiation by race, religion, or ethnicity. The\r\nhorror, devastation and fear that terrorism brings are\r\n31\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nthe same whether in Casablanca, Madrid, New York,\r\nJerusalem or Beslan. Terrorism cannot be justified.\r\nAnd there can be no excuses and no leniency in\r\nconfronting it. The fight against terrorism must remain\r\none of the priority tasks of individual Member States\r\nand of the United Nations.\r\nEven as we speak, humanitarian crises, poverty,\r\nfamine and disease continue to plague large parts of the\r\nworld. Across the globe, almost a billion people\r\nsurvive on less than a dollar a day. In sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica alone, around 300 million people live in abject\r\npoverty.\r\nIn Iraq, the hope for universal and free elections\r\nis marred by almost daily explosions, and security\r\nremains too precarious for the United Nations to\r\nresume its pivotal role. The Middle East conflict\r\ncontinues taking its desperate death toll. And the word\r\ngenocide is once again on our lips owing to the Darfur\r\ncrisis in Sudan.\r\nTherefore, we need to go the extra mile, to make\r\nextra efforts to empower the United Nations to deal\r\nsuccessfully with these and other threats and\r\nchallenges, because the United Nations, despite all the\r\ncriticism, remains the only Organization capable of\r\nembodying the principles of a truly global and\r\neffective multilateralism. The United Nations can offer\r\nthe global reach and legitimacy necessary to enable the\r\ninternational community to act.\r\nAs the nature of threats before us is changing and\r\nnew responses are needed, it is high time to agree on\r\nfuture policies and principles. Today we need to build a\r\nshared understanding of the nature of modern threats to\r\ninternational peace and security. Much depends on the\r\nability of the United Nations — that is, on us — to\r\nreach a new consensus on collective security. Our\r\nstrength lies in our resolve to deal collectively with\r\nmajor challenges to peace, security and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nToday, more than ever before, the United Nations\r\nhas to play the leading role in building societies that\r\nfollow the path of good governance, respect human\r\nrights and the rule of law. We must be able to intervene\r\nand to prevent situations of massive human rights\r\nviolations.\r\nWe must also be firm in our struggle against all\r\nattempts to encroach upon human dignity, against all\r\nforms and manifestations of intolerance, anti-Semitism,\r\nracism or Islamophobia. The international community\r\nis vulnerable to the dangers posed by the proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction, international\r\norganized crime, environmental degradation and the\r\nspread of highly dangerous diseases, such as\r\nHIV/AIDS. Our common efforts against these and\r\nother threats must be universal, consistent, systematic\r\nand unwavering.\r\nNo less universal and consistent must be our\r\nefforts to reduce poverty and hunger, to diminish\r\ndisparities between and within nations, to improve\r\nliving conditions for women and children and to offer a\r\nhope of a dignified life to ever-larger segments of the\r\nworld’s population, as pledged in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nWe need to press ahead with the implementation\r\nof the Millennium Development Goals. We need to\r\nreinforce our political will to make our global\r\npartnership more effective, by fully honouring the\r\ncommitments undertaken by the Monterrey Consensus.\r\nWithout peace there is no development. Without\r\ndevelopment there is no peace. This recognized linkage\r\nof security and development should be better reflected\r\nin our global agenda. Only by confronting these issues\r\nin a coherent and coordinated manner shall we be able\r\nto build our common future.\r\nLithuania is ready to contribute bilaterally and\r\nmultilaterally to the implementation of the Millennium\r\nGoals, and by sharing our experience of a national\r\nreform process. Our membership in the enlarged\r\nEuropean Union and the North Atlantic Alliance\r\nenables us to play a more active role by embracing the\r\nprinciples of development policy and by adopting the\r\nrole of a donor.\r\nNext year we will discuss how to find consensus\r\non the institutional and political framework for the\r\nUnited Nations to operate in the future. Lithuania fully\r\nembraces the need for reform of the United Nations for\r\nthe sake of enhancing its effectiveness and\r\ninclusiveness. We hope that the outcome of the\r\ndeliberations of the High-Level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change will be able to contribute\r\nsignificantly to giving a renewed impetus to the reform\r\nof the United Nations. If so, the next test will be to find\r\nbroad agreement on changes and follow their\r\nimplementation.\r\n32\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nI hope, too, that next year will be crucial in\r\nmoving ahead with the long-debated reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. The issue is not whether the Security\r\nCouncil should be enlarged. It is how to make it\r\neffective and representative. Therefore, Lithuania fully\r\nembraces the idea of ensuring broader representation\r\nand responsibility for the Security Council.\r\nIn addition, the Economic and Social Council\r\nmust be renewed and strengthened. By dedicating\r\nourselves to Economic and Social Council reform we\r\nhave a real chance to make it an effective tool in the\r\nhands of active and responsible United Nations\r\nmembers.\r\nIt is my hope and wish that by the end of this\r\nsession we shall arrive at marking the sixtieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations with the conviction\r\nand satisfaction that we have done everything in our\r\npower to build a better Organization, one capable of\r\nresponding to both old and new, hard and soft, threats\r\nand challenges in an effective and comprehensive way.\r\nFully aware that the United Nations was created\r\nto serve humankind, let us embrace this challenge. Let\r\nus bring to fruition the promise that the United Nations\r\nis capable of fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the\r\npeoples for whom it was created.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Lithuania for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Valdas Adamkus, President of the Republic of\r\nLithuania, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Pedro Miguel de Santana Lopes,\r\nPrime Minister of the Portuguese Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the\r\nPortuguese Republic.\r\nMr. Pedro Miguel de Santana Lopes, Prime\r\nMinister of the Portuguese Republic, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Pedro Miguel de\r\nSantana Lopes, Prime Minister of the Portuguese\r\nRepublic, and inviting him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Lopes (Portugal) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): At the outset,\r\nI would like to state that Portugal, of course, endorses\r\nthe statement made here by the presidency of the\r\nEuropean Union. Portugal wishes the United Nations to\r\nfulfil the central role it rightly deserves in the\r\ncommunity of nations. The United Nations is an\r\nindispensable international Organization. Without this\r\nbody, of which we are all a part, the world would be\r\nmore unstable, less predictable and a place where the\r\nuniversal dream of peace and freedom would be no\r\nmore than a mirage on a far-off horizon.\r\nThe United Nations was established in a distant\r\nhistorical context, but its ideas and basic values remain\r\ncontemporary. Portugal has a habit of recalling them,\r\non occasions such as this, because we feel that this\r\ncommon undertaking is based on solid foundations.\r\n“We the peoples of the United Nations” believe in the\r\ndignity and the value of the human being, in\r\nfundamental freedoms and in equality between men\r\nand women. We defend the primacy of international\r\nlaw and tolerance in relations between peoples.\r\nBut we also believe that one should not\r\ndistinguish between large and small nations, as we all\r\nhave a common interest in social advancement and in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThese are the objectives of this Organization that need\r\nto be preserved and strengthened. This is, in good\r\ntruth, our common cause, the cause of humankind.\r\nThe month of September, in this city of New\r\nYork, inevitably brings back memories of the horror of\r\nthree years ago. It forces us to look at the challenges to\r\npeace that this Organization and all of us face today.\r\nThe tragic events in Madrid, Beslan, Baghdad, Jakarta\r\nand other places show us that terrorism has entered the\r\ndeepest and darkest of shadows.\r\nNo cause, no idea, justifies acts of pure barbarism\r\nand the spilling of innocent blood. Terrorism is an\r\nenemy of humankind. Moreover, Portugal believes that\r\nit is up to the United Nations to contribute decisively\r\nto the establishment of a global strategy against\r\nterrorism — a strategy that takes into account not only\r\nthe obvious security-related responses, but also other\r\nelements that may have the potential to generate\r\nviolence.\r\n33\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nLet us be unyielding in the fight against\r\nterrorism, but let us also engage ourselves in doing it\r\ncollectively. Let us take into account the laws and the\r\nvalues in whose name we are fighting, and should be\r\nfighting, this evil.\r\nHunger and poverty generate despair and may\r\ncause people to choose the path of violence. I would\r\ntherefore like to express my appreciation for the\r\nSummit of World Leaders for Action against Hunger\r\nand Poverty, promoted by President Lula da Silva,\r\nwhich I had the honour to attend. We believe that that\r\nmeeting was a fundamental step towards alleviating\r\ncases of extreme poverty, which are unsustainable in\r\nmoral and political terms.\r\nIf we act now, the world can change for the\r\nbetter; if we do not, its balance could become\r\nincreasingly difficult to manage. Portugal wants to be\r\nat the forefront of the future. That is why we believe\r\nthat the sustainability of development and the defence\r\nof natural resources are paradigms of a new era. We\r\nbelieve that the economic development of the twenty-\r\nfirst century will be sustainable only if it truly respects\r\nthe balance of the planet and if the Kyoto provisions\r\nare truly implemented.\r\nDoes it make sense that an Organization like the\r\nUnited Nations continues to work in the twenty-first\r\ncentury as it did 60 years ago? The United Nations was\r\nborn at a time when there were no televisions, no\r\ncomputers, no cellular phones. Communications,\r\ntechnologies and means of transportation have all\r\nchanged; DNA and the human genome have now been\r\ndiscovered; we surf the Internet on a global scale. And\r\nyet the Organization that brings together the peoples of\r\nthe world has the same structure that it had more than\r\nhalf a century ago.\r\nThe pace of change is breathtaking. The United\r\nNations finds itself at a crossroads: while its relevance\r\nis not challenged, we may question its effectiveness.\r\nBut that is an issue that should be placed primarily\r\nbefore Member States. After all, the United Nations is\r\nan expression of our collective will. The Organization\r\ncannot be seen as a distant reflection on which we\r\nproject our individual expectations, which often exceed\r\nthe limits of the mandates and the means that we make\r\navailable to it.\r\nIn that regard, we support the work of the High-\r\nLevel Panel established last year by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to examine current challenges to peace and\r\nsecurity. The strategies for strengthening the\r\nOrganization to be recommended by the Panel aim at\r\npreserving what is best in the United Nations and at\r\nensuring that it is equipped with the means necessary\r\nto promote real development, prevent conflicts and\r\nprotect human rights.\r\nPortugal unequivocally supports reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. We support its enlargement so that it\r\nwill better reflect the world of today, through a\r\nrebalancing of its representativity. We have already\r\nstated before this forum — and we reaffirm today —\r\nour support for an increase in the number of permanent\r\nand non-permanent members. Portugal’s support for\r\nBrazil, Germany and Japan has been known to the\r\nGeneral Assembly since 1993. We have already\r\nexpressed our support for India’s application for\r\ncandidacy, and, on behalf of the Government of\r\nPortugal, I take the opportunity to express our\r\ncommitment to seeing the African continent\r\nrepresented by a permanent seat on the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nBut we also want to improve the relationship\r\nbetween the Council and other organs and agencies of\r\nthe United Nations, as well as promoting greater\r\ntransparency in its decisions. The democracy that the\r\nOrganization defends is not compatible with obsolete\r\nworking methods that often have a negative impact on\r\nthe image and the credibility of the United Nations and\r\nlead to its paralysis.\r\nPreventing conflicts is more important than\r\nsolving them. We should be aware that the usefulness\r\nof the United Nations will ultimately be judged by its\r\ncapacity for conflict prevention. The proliferation of\r\ncrisis situations has led to the current deployment of\r\napproximately 60,000 Blue Helmets in peacekeeping\r\noperations, and that number continues to increase.\r\nPortugal has been with the United Nations in\r\nmany of its peacekeeping operations around the world.\r\nHere, I would like to pay tribute to my compatriots and\r\nto all others who have served on peacekeeping\r\nmissions, particularly those who have given their lives\r\nfor our common ideals.\r\nIt is our hope that the Organization can better\r\ndevelop its work in the field of conflict prevention.\r\nHowever, we still lack an efficient instrument for the\r\ndevelopment of that policy. Therefore, at the last\r\nsession of the General Assembly, Portugal proposed\r\nthe creation of a commission to promote peace and\r\n34\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\ndevelopment, under the authority of and in\r\ncollaboration with the Security Council and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. Its objectives would be\r\nto regularly monitor countries in crisis or at risk and to\r\nensure the cooperation6 of regional and international\r\ninstitutions.\r\nWe believe that our proposal remains relevant,\r\nand we thank all those who have already improved it\r\nthrough suggestions and comments. This is an idea on\r\nwhich we have worked in particular with our partners\r\nin the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries,\r\nwhich I would like to warmly acknowledge on this\r\noccasion.\r\nIndeed, the Portuguese language is the unifying\r\nfactor among hundreds of millions of people on five\r\ncontinents. So that it can have strength as a vehicle of\r\ncommunication and culture in the twenty-first century,\r\nthe Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries\r\nneeds its members to make a clear commitment to the\r\nconnection between the past, the present and the future.\r\nThe fact that Portugal is the cradle of the Portuguese\r\nlanguage does not lead us to claim it for ourselves\r\nalone with any special rights. The communities that\r\none joins as a result of specific interests, however\r\nlegitimate, can never erase one’s own community —\r\none’s family, spirit, language, culture and identity.\r\n“Know thyself” was already inscribed at the foot of the\r\nTemple of Delphi.\r\nNowhere are we confronted with such a huge\r\npredicament regarding the ability of the United Nations\r\nto act as in Iraq. Iraq needs the support of the\r\ninternational community. The Iraqi people, ravaged by\r\ndecades of dictatorship and war, deserve such support.\r\nAnd we should give the United Nations the necessary\r\nmeans to fulfil in its entirety the mandate provided by\r\nthe Security Council. But we must also understand\r\nclearly that the international presence in Iraq —\r\napproved by the Security Council and by the Iraqi\r\nInterim Government — is by its own nature\r\nprovisional.\r\nIt is time for the international community to unite\r\nin its efforts to ensure that the Iraqi people again find\r\nthe path towards peace and development. We cannot\r\nchange the past, but we must assume that the future can\r\nstill be influenced in a positive way. Thus, we must\r\nquickly restore unity if our Organization is not to suffer\r\npermanent collateral damage as a result of the Iraqi\r\ncrisis.\r\nFor democracy to succeed in Iraq, and for that\r\ncountry to maintain its unity, it is essential that its\r\npeople have a say, through elections, regarding the way\r\nthey wish to be governed. It is also important that the\r\nagreed political timetable be honoured, or we may\r\nseriously compromise the rightful expectations of the\r\nIraqi people and Government. We cannot allow those\r\nwho generate instability through unthinkable acts of\r\nterrorism to have the power to veto the establishment\r\nof a democratic regime in Iraq. Elections are the only\r\nway to enable the Iraqi people to meet the destiny of\r\ndemocracy and freedom to which they are entitled.\r\nPeace, freedom and democracy are also at stake\r\nin other parts of the world we inhabit. We cannot look\r\naway from the tragedy unfolding in Darfur. Our\r\ncollective security also requires the effective\r\ninternational control of the production of nuclear,\r\nchemical and bacteriological weapons and the means to\r\ndeploy them.\r\nFor the maintenance of international security, it is\r\nalso essential that the Organization continues to push\r\nfor the resumption of the Middle East peace process.\r\nThe existing status quo is unacceptable. Israel and\r\nPalestine need to learn to coexist in peace and security,\r\nwithin internationally recognized borders and without\r\nartificial partitions.\r\nWe cannot replace the dichotomy between\r\nliberalism and collectivism with another between\r\nliberty and peace on the one hand and terror and\r\ndictatorship on the other. The world has already\r\nentered a new era. The peoples of the whole world, as\r\nreferred to in the Charter of the United Nations,\r\ndemand a new contract between the governed and those\r\nwho govern.\r\nThe three classic powers of Montesquieu are no\r\nlonger the only ones in the government of the peoples.\r\nThose who believe so are lost in time. There is nothing\r\nworse than erring in our perception of reality. There are\r\npowers that are not as they were and others that\r\nMontesquieu, Locke and the drafters of liberal\r\nrevolutions could not know of, because they did not\r\nexist or because, over time, they have changed\r\nconfiguration. One need only think of the power of the\r\nmedia over people’s lives today.\r\nOur peoples want to feel strength in the present\r\nand faith in the future. For that reason, I shall end my\r\naddress the way I began: stressing the indispensability\r\nand the centrality of the United Nations in the daily\r\n35\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nlives of free and sovereign nations. We belong to an\r\nOrganization that has restored hope to many peoples\r\nand human beings by bringing the light of freedom to\r\nthose who lived in oppression. Timor-Leste is an\r\nexcellent example of the ability of the United Nations\r\nto do good.\r\nBut one should also stress the attention the\r\nUnited Nations has given to the vulnerable, children\r\nand the disabled and to the promotion of gender\r\nequality. For this Organization, humankind is not an\r\nabstract entity. The dialogue between cultures,\r\ncivilizations and religions, which Portugal upholds, is\r\nan integral part of the daily work of the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe are part of an Organization dedicated to\r\nmaking peace and preventing war. We are party to a\r\ncollective project in the service of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms. We have the strength of our\r\nconvictions. And, as Pope John Paul II has stated, we\r\nknow that peace is not weakness, but strength.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nPortuguese Republic for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Pedro Miguel de Santana Lopes, Prime\r\nMinister of the Portuguese Republic, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Marc Forné Molné, Prime Minister\r\nof the Principality of Andorra\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the\r\nPrincipality of Andorra.\r\nMr. Marc Forné Molné, Prime Minister of the\r\nPrincipality of Andorra, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Marc Forné Molné,\r\nPrime Minister of the Principality of Andorra, and\r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Forné Molné (Andorra) (spoke in Catalan;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): A decade ago\r\nI was elected the Head of Government of my country.\r\nIt was 1994, a time of hope for the world and for the\r\nOrganization of the United Nations. The collapse of the\r\ncommunist system and the iron curtain and the\r\nappearance of new democracies in the world, combined\r\nwith a positive economic outlook enabled us to\r\nimagine a better future for humankind in the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nTen years later, we are living with considerable\r\nconcern in a world that is becoming more and more\r\nviolent, in which terrorist attacks are met with a\r\nmilitary response and those military responses seem to\r\ngenerate new terrorist attacks. It would seem that we\r\nare caught up in a terrible settling of scores and in a\r\nspiral of hate, fanaticism and senseless bloodshed.\r\nEvery day, the media shows images of innocent people\r\nand soldiers losing their lives in those conflicts. The\r\nstakes continue to rise, yet the cause of world peace\r\nseems increasingly vulnerable. The almost\r\ninstantaneous arrival in every home of images of the\r\nmost dramatic events taking place everywhere is even\r\nbecoming banal.\r\nThe privilege of being able to come so many\r\ntimes to the Assembly on behalf of my country has\r\nproduced in me states of mind that have gone from\r\ninitial curiosity and the wish to know and learn to a\r\nmuch more sceptical phase, by way of periods in which\r\nlarge question marks were placed on the role we are all\r\nplaying in this game.\r\nWe want to be positive and optimistic and not to\r\nbetray the heritage of peace, harmony and open\r\nwelcome that are the essence of the life of the\r\nAndorrans, both women and men. But it must be\r\nadmitted that it is becoming more and more difficult to\r\nthink in that way and to believe that the principles that\r\ninspired, for example, the founding of the United\r\nStates of America, can still prevail.\r\nThat is because the notion of pre-emptive war has\r\nnow shaken us all. The principle of attacking before\r\none is attacked is no new invention. But it had seemed\r\nto be a tribal memory or a type of behaviour belonging\r\nto other, none too remote times in the history of Europe\r\nitself.\r\nThe big questions are: what justifies a pre-\r\nemptive attack? Which country or countries pose a\r\nsufficient threat to allow taking such a risk? Why\r\nattack one country and not another, perhaps equally\r\ndangerous one? Are the sufferings of some people\r\nmore meaningful than the sufferings of others, and\r\nconsequently more deserving of action? Should the\r\nconventions of international law be cast aside by\r\n36\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nMembers of the United Nations, as they are by lawless\r\nterrorists?\r\nWhat I would like to do today is reflect on the\r\nthings we can learn from the past that can guide us\r\ntowards a more promising and safer future.\r\nFor countries with a deep respect and admiration\r\nfor the history of freedom of the United States — and\r\nAndorra counts itself among those countries — it is a\r\nsource of consternation to note that the doctrine of pre-\r\nemptive attack has generated a level of distrust among\r\nGovernments and peoples. After the worldwide\r\noutpouring of sympathy following the terrorist attacks\r\non New York and Washington, that changed perception\r\nis profoundly troubling.\r\nNeither can anyone claim that sympathy is\r\nenough. Worldwide sympathy was the reaction to the\r\nattacks on New York and Washington. We, the people\r\nof Andorra, were very directly affected by the attacks\r\nin Madrid six months ago. Very recently, Russia has\r\nbeen added to the list of disasters. But sympathy alone\r\ncannot break the cycle of fear and violence.\r\nWe need to address the causes of terrorism and\r\ncomprehend the forces that give it power in order to\r\nrespond together in compliance with the rule of law.\r\nTomorrow, my country will deposit instruments of\r\nratification for four conventions against terrorism, and\r\nthe rest are scheduled to be ratified in the coming year.\r\nMr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nWe cannot allow terrorism to unbind the rule of\r\nlaw, since that would mean undoing the tissue of\r\ncivilized behaviour, which serves as a safety net in\r\nmodern culture. Instead of isolating one nation from\r\nanother, instead of moralizing and self-serving political\r\nposturing, instead of giving in to fear, we must\r\nrecognize that our common vulnerability goes hand in\r\nhand with a humanity that we also share.\r\nHelping every member of the international\r\ncommunity to realize that what happens to others can\r\nalso happen to us creates a basis for tolerance and\r\nunderstanding. How much stronger we, all the\r\ncountries represented at the United Nations, could\r\nbecome in the fight against terrorism if we truly acted\r\ntogether. A Security Council strengthened by a\r\ncommon will to root out terrorism could do much more\r\nthan individual actions supported by a few\r\nGovernments.\r\nWe must give back to the United Nations its sense\r\nof determination and help it to help us all in the\r\ncrucially important fight against terrorism. I call in\r\nparticular on the States that are permanent members of\r\nthe Security Council to think long and hard about what\r\nthey can achieve together, with the support of all other\r\nUnited Nations Member States, to preserve\r\ninternational order and models of civilized behaviour,\r\nwhich this Organization represents and which it has\r\ntaken humankind so many millenniums of suffering\r\nand progress to achieve.\r\nIn this context, Andorra would support an\r\nincrease — up to 24 — in the number of members of\r\nthe Security Council so as to guarantee a more accurate\r\nrepresentation of the reality of today’s world in that\r\nimportant decision-making body.\r\nI believe that the energy that feeds the cycle of\r\nviolence is the result of the abstractions behind which\r\nwe hide — abstractions of nation, religion or race. We\r\nhide our vulnerability behind a kind of rigid certainty\r\nor moral righteousness. Ignorance and the\r\nunwillingness to recognize differences give rise to\r\nxenophobia and racism.\r\nThere is not much use in wondering now if the\r\nresults would have been different, and the dangers\r\nfacing us today less severe, if different policies had\r\nbeen applied after the criminal and unforgivable\r\nattacks of 11 September 2001; if the peace process in\r\nIsrael and Palestine had been more successful; or if we\r\nin the United Nations had been able to play a different\r\nrole. Granted, our response, as the United Nations, to\r\nother international crises has been imperfect, and we\r\nare constantly striving to rectify the way in which we\r\napproach such issues. But the results have been\r\ninvaluable. Our efforts averted worse bloodbaths,\r\ngreater harm to the oppressed and ever more extreme\r\ntrauma and despair.\r\nWhat good is this Organization if we lack the\r\nwisdom and moral strength to attempt to reconcile our\r\nfellow nations? How could we continue to hope for\r\npeace and justice in the world if the United Nations\r\nceased to press forward with its mission?\r\nAndorra has never been a wealthy country,\r\nthough its inhabitants have always been free. In this\r\nrespect, we have a privileged history. Other nations\r\nhave endured greater privations and fratricidal wars,\r\nhave lost customs and traditions and have had its\r\ncitizens flee into exile.\r\n37\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nConscious of the moral debt which we owe to\r\nothers, three years ago we proposed to increase our\r\ndevelopment assistance to 0.7 per cent of our budget\r\nfor next year. Although that represents a great effort for\r\nus, as a small country, I am happy to inform the\r\nAssembly that that commitment will be honoured. I am\r\nalso sure that my successor as head of Government will\r\ncontinue to increase Andorra’s contribution to the\r\nobjectives of development until we reach 0.7 per cent\r\nof gross domestic product. We will also become a\r\nmember of the Food and Agriculture Organization of\r\nthe United Nations and help to make its worthy\r\nmission a reality.\r\nWe live in a world of limited resources and\r\nopportunities. Competition for them is increasing with\r\nthe growth of globalization. The worst outcome of the\r\ninevitable future competition would be increasingly\r\nviolent demands on the part of one nation or another.\r\nYet the essential issues facing us are not restricted to\r\njust one part of the world; nor can they be defined in\r\nterms of the advantages or interests of a single nation.\r\nPreserving the environment and maintaining a strong\r\nglobal economy, dignified standards of living and safe\r\nand peaceful political relationships all require a\r\nconcerted effort.\r\nThe task will not be easy. It will require all the\r\ncourage, energy, diplomatic talent and communication\r\nskills that we can bring to bear. Our joint task has\r\nnever been as important as in the coming year.\r\nYesterday, I listened carefully to the words of the\r\nSecretary-General, who set a very high standard for all\r\nin his opening speech. I would like sincerely to\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for the courage of\r\nhis words. I have heard many impressive speeches in\r\nthis Hall over the past 10 years. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s statement yesterday was the best, by far, of\r\nall of them.\r\nAlthough Andorra joined the United Nations just\r\n10 years ago, our country is not a new one. Quite the\r\ncontrary — the Principality of Andorra is one of the\r\noldest and most peaceful nations in the world. Our\r\nfrontiers have not changed for centuries, and we have\r\npractised parliamentary democracy for over half of that\r\ntime. In fact, we have had uninterrupted peace since\r\n1278.\r\nIn the thirteenth century, during the violent period\r\nof the Cathar heresies, which created upheaval in our\r\npart of the world, two powerful lords — the Count of\r\nFoix in the north and the Bishop of Urgell in the\r\nsouth — managed to overcome religious and political\r\ndifferences to negotiate an agreement which made the\r\nAndorran State possible. Through the 1993\r\nconstitution, we keep their successors — the President\r\nof the French Republic and the Bishop of Urgell — as\r\nour heads of State in a personal, joint and indivisible\r\nmanner. The continued existence of Andorra over the\r\ncenturies has, indeed, been the result of a skilful and\r\nconstant will to negotiate between our people and their\r\npowerful neighbours.\r\nThe democratic process which began with the\r\nsetting up of the Council of the Land in 1419 was\r\nessential for our survival as a free community.\r\nAlthough conflicts have also threatened Andorra\r\nduring its history, mutual understanding has protected\r\nus better than have the high peaks of the mountains\r\nwhich surround us or the rigorous winters which\r\nisolate us from the outside world for weeks and weeks\r\nat a time. When I read Andorran documents from past\r\ncenturies, I recognize how deeply ideas of\r\nindependence and respect for others have guaranteed\r\nour well-being and our security.\r\nGiven the bloody course of European history\r\nduring previous millenniums, we hold this as a\r\nremarkable accomplishment. We have never had an\r\narmy, nor have we produced one single offensive\r\nweapon of any type. Our only weapon has been the\r\nwisdom and prudence of our forebears, who had the\r\ngood sense to keep out of all neighbouring conflicts.\r\nThat good sense has been inherited by the new\r\ngenerations of young Andorrans — women and men\r\nwho are very well prepared for the world of today,\r\nopen to knowledge of new technology and full of\r\nlegitimate pride in being members of a small State in\r\nwhich they have every chance of being the main agents\r\nof their future, but who are, at the same time,\r\nperplexed by the growth of new religious fanaticism\r\nand exclusiveness and by the return of old fanaticisms,\r\nwhich we had considered forgotten.\r\nAt this, the dawn of a new era, we must pass on\r\nto them the trust which we have placed in the United\r\nNations and in the supremacy of law over force. This\r\nour fathers taught us, and this our children must learn\r\nif they are to be worthy members of humankind.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\n38\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nPrincipality of Andorra for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Marc Forné Molné, Prime Minister of the\r\nPrincipality of Andorra, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ivo Sanader, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Croatia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Croatia.\r\nMr. Ivo Sanader, Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Croatia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Ivo Sanader, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Croatia, and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Sanader (Croatia): This is my first address\r\nto this body in my capacity as the Prime Minister of\r\nCroatia. I feel privileged to be able to present the\r\nAssembly with the Croatian Government’s strategic\r\npriorities in the domain of foreign policy.\r\nI would like at the outset to congratulate Minister\r\nJean Ping on his assumption of the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and to wish him every success in\r\nperforming his highly important task. He can rely fully\r\non Croatia’s support and cooperation.\r\nFor the first time, Croatia is addressing the\r\nGeneral Assembly as a candidate country for\r\nmembership in the European Union. Today, I would\r\nlike to share with you Croatia’s position with respect to\r\nthe most important tasks facing the United Nations at\r\nthis time of great multilateral challenges.\r\nThe very fact that so many heads of State and\r\nGovernment leaders have gathered here in New York to\r\nmark the beginning of the fifty-ninth General\r\nAssembly session serves as a telling affirmation that\r\nmultilateralism is a driving force in global politics and\r\nconfirms that we live in no ordinary times.\r\nThe world at the beginning of the twenty-first\r\ncentury is profoundly different from the one in which\r\nthe Berlin wall started to crumble. Never before have\r\nwe faced so many opportunities stemming from new\r\ntechnologies and enhanced regional and global\r\ncooperation. And seldom have we encountered as many\r\nthreats and challenges as we do today.\r\nTragic events in recent years, from New York to\r\nMoscow, from the Middle East all the way to Southern\r\nAsia have confirmed that terrorism currently stands out\r\nas the most pressing threat to our world, taking, as it\r\nhas, thousands of innocent lives at random. Equally\r\ndangerous is the threat of weapons of mass destruction\r\n(WMDs). We must resort to all means necessary to\r\nprevent the proliferation of these vehicles of death. If\r\nthe two evils of terrorism and WMDs are synergized,\r\nthey could bring upon mankind an unforeseeable level\r\nof destruction.\r\nTherefore, we must not relax our efforts in the\r\nfight against global terrorism nor neglect the deadly\r\nimpact of WMDs. These issues must remain at the top\r\nof our priorities; any hesitation to address them in a\r\ntimely and appropriate manner could have unforgiving\r\nconsequences.\r\nThe United Nations should continue to play a\r\ndecisive role in our quest for a stable, secure and\r\nprosperous world. Croatia welcomes the reports of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the United Nations\r\n(A/59/1) and the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration (A/59/282). I would particularly like to\r\ncommend his reform efforts to date. He has identified\r\nmany challenges to the United Nations and we should\r\nnot hesitate to meet them. We particularly share his\r\nassessment that the United Nations requires adequate\r\nsecurity and institutional agility to adapt to changing\r\ncircumstances in the world. The Security Council has a\r\nparamount responsibility in that regard, but we must\r\nnot overlook the role of the General Assembly, whose\r\npotential is far from being explored to the fullest.\r\nRegarding Security Council reform, Croatia\r\nsupports the enlargement of the Council in all\r\ncategories of membership, based on appropriate\r\nregional representation.\r\nLet us make the United Nations even more\r\nrelevant, with a range of inventive and collaborative\r\napproaches that will increase the effectiveness of our\r\njoint efforts and result in the Organization’s increased\r\ncapability to respond to the needs and realities of the\r\nnew century.\r\nThe credibility of the United Nations does not\r\ndepend solely on the political will of its Member States\r\nand its capacity to manage crises. It also depends on its\r\n39\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\ncapacity to respond to the expectations of those who\r\nare in dire need of assistance, who cannot protect\r\nthemselves from imbalances and injustice. We cannot\r\nshy away from seeking all available solutions to the\r\nfundamental global challenges we face today, including\r\nextreme poverty, drug smuggling, the spread of deadly\r\ndiseases and global climate change. Globalization\r\nneeds to be mastered; the opportunities it offers need to\r\nbe assessed and its excesses rectified.\r\nFinding appropriate answers to those fundamental\r\nquestions requires multilateral cooperation, with a\r\nviable and effective United Nations at its core. We all\r\nwish to see a strong and decisive United Nations that is\r\ncapable of effectively responding to current and future\r\nchallenges, but this cannot happen by default. It\r\ndepends solely on the contribution and dedication of\r\neach and every Member State.\r\nCroatia gained extensive experience in post-\r\nconflict management after the war that was imposed\r\nupon it in the 1990s, especially in the fields of refugee\r\nreturn, confidence building, prosecuting war crimes,\r\neconomic reconstruction and the reintegration of war-\r\ntorn areas with the rest of the country. We stand ready\r\nto contribute our knowledge and share it with those\r\nwho need it.\r\nIn confronting alarming challenges, such as\r\nsecurity, poverty, terrorism, pandemics and\r\nenvironmental issues, collective action is most likely to\r\nyield the best results, since not even the most powerful\r\namong us can bear the burden alone.\r\nAt this very moment, Croatian peacekeepers are\r\nparticipating in seven United Nations peacekeeping\r\nmissions. We are determined to further intensify our\r\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping missions\r\nwith respect to the composition and number of troops\r\ndeployed, as well as the theatres of operation.\r\nWe will continue to support the training of\r\npeacekeepers from newest troop-contributing\r\ncountries — whether provided directly or under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations — by receiving foreign\r\nofficers as attendees of the relevant training courses in\r\nthe Republic of Croatia, as well as by sending Croatian\r\ninstructors to organize and conduct courses in the\r\nnewest troop-contributing countries.\r\nCroatia has presented its candidacy for\r\nmembership in the Security Council for the 2008-2009\r\nterm. Our membership would not only represent a great\r\ntribute to my country, but also a recognition of all the\r\neffort that has been fruitfully invested in the peace and\r\nstability of South-East Europe.\r\nWe are proud of our achievements since\r\nbecoming a United Nations Member State in May\r\n1992. From being part of a European powder keg,\r\nCroatia grew into one of the key generators and\r\npromoters of stability in South-East Europe and\r\nbeyond. With a growing economy, a greatly expanded\r\nhighway network and a blossoming tourism industry,\r\nCroatia is firmly oriented towards the future. And I can\r\nstate with confidence that the best is yet to come.\r\nCroatia has successfully embarked upon the road\r\nof Euro-Atlantic integration, with a clear goal of\r\nEuropean Union and NATO membership. The bedrock\r\nof Croatia’s foreign policy remains good bilateral\r\nrelations with all our neighbours and beyond, cross-\r\nborder and regional cooperation and constructive\r\nmultilateralism.\r\nMy country is speedily preparing for the opening\r\nof accession negotiations with the European Union in\r\nearly 2005. We are confident that Croatia will fully\r\nmeet all the criteria required in this demanding process\r\non time. We have already demonstrated our reform and\r\ndecision-making abilities through the fulfilment of the\r\nCopenhagen criteria required for European Union\r\ncandidate status. This has been far from easy, but in the\r\nend, Croatia’s success demonstrates that hard work and\r\nreform-oriented policies are the best possible\r\ninvestment in a country’s future.\r\nCroatia is ready to serve as a model country in\r\nSouth-East Europe, encouraging and assisting our\r\nneighbours to realize their Euro-Atlantic ambitions.\r\nThe prospect of EU membership has proved to be the\r\nbest incentive for the countries of Central and south-\r\neast Europe to implement comprehensive political,\r\neconomic, institutional and democratic reforms.\r\nA unified Europe is no longer a dream; it is a\r\nreality upon which the prosperity and security of the\r\nentire continent is based. The European Union is\r\neconomic prosperity and cooperation; it is stability and\r\nsecurity; but, above all, it is its values that stand out so\r\nstrongly. We all share the same values, the same\r\nprinciples and the same dedication.\r\nA famous Croatian poet, Dobrisa Cesaric, wrote a\r\npoem about a waterfall whose beauty and might are\r\n40\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\ncreated by thousands of small drops of water. Croatia’s\r\ndrop is a part of this wonder, called “one Europe”.\r\nCroatia is determined to contribute to the best of\r\nits ability to the success of this Organization and to the\r\nprinciples on which it is based. Too often we fail to\r\nfathom the true meaning of a phrase that is much more\r\nthan the mere name of our Organization: the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe United Nations — there can be no better\r\nglobal formula in the face of the mounting challenges\r\nand the potential, burdens, hopes and expectations of\r\nthe new century.\r\nMr. Ivo Sanader, Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Croatia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Miguel Abia Biteo Boricó, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Equatorial Guinea.\r\nMr. Miguel Abia Biteo Boricó, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Miguel Abia Biteo\r\nBoricó, Prime Minister of the Republic of Equatorial\r\nGuinea, and inviting him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Abia Biteo Boricó (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAlthough protocol requires that our statements be brief,\r\nit is no matter of routine for Equatorial Guinea to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Jean Ping, Minister of Foreign Affairs\r\nof the Gabonese Republic, on his well-deserved\r\nelection to guide the work of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-ninth regular session.\r\nWe congratulate you, Mr. President, because,\r\nfirst, it is right that the voice of the oppressed and\r\nmarginalized that you represent should be heard loud\r\nand clear by the international community. Secondly, we\r\nwould like also to encourage you, because the task\r\nfacing you personally and your country, the Gabonese\r\nRepublic, is to coordinate — and to endeavour to\r\nreconcile — the varied and opposing interests that exist\r\nin this unipolar, artificial and fragile world, where few\r\nspeak out, others say nothing or only listen, and yet\r\nothers speak, but to no effect.\r\nThe task is difficult, because we need to rebuild\r\nthe international authority that has been taken away\r\nfrom the United Nations. We can do this only if there is\r\na spirit of honesty, individual and collective\r\nresponsibility, and goodwill on the part of Member\r\nStates, so that selfish interests can be put aside in the\r\ncommon fight to ensure the primacy of the principles\r\nand objectives of this world Organization, which are\r\npositive and universal.\r\nMr. President, you will always be able to count\r\non the support and ongoing cooperation of my country,\r\nthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea, in ensuring that\r\nyour work is fruitful and benefits humankind.\r\nWe express our eternal gratitude to Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, Secretary-General of this Organization, who at\r\nall times has been equal to the circumstances and who\r\nhas dealt with caution, impartiality and justice with the\r\nissues that have come to the attention of the\r\nOrganization over the course of this year. We reiterate\r\nour confidence in him and assure him of our\r\ncooperation in the task of strengthening the role of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nEquatorial Guinea is participating in the work of\r\nthe General Assembly at this session with deep concern\r\nbecause of the dangers and threats posed by the\r\nmethods used by more powerful countries in\r\nintervening in the affairs of less protected nations, such\r\nas my own. We believe that the United Nations has still\r\nnot fulfilled its primary objective of guaranteeing\r\ninternational peace and security. We are living in times\r\nof serious upheaval in various parts of the world,\r\nbrought about by the anarchy that currently\r\ncharacterizes international relations.\r\nEquatorial Guinea will join its efforts with those\r\nof the international community in order to strengthen\r\nthe international authority of the United Nations.\r\nWe have come to the United Nations to state\r\npublicly that Equatorial Guinea is under threat. We say\r\nthis out loud, and we hope that we will truly be heard,\r\nbecause we know that complaints by weaker States\r\nhave often fallen on deaf ears in this forum when the\r\ninterests of the strongest are at stake.\r\nEquatorial Guinea is facing a serious threat, and\r\nwe ask the United Nations to take serious, committed\r\nmeasures, not only with regard to the issues affecting\r\nEquatorial Guinea today but also in order to prevent\r\n41\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nother countries in the same situation as ours from being\r\nvictimized by the same sort of conspiracy in future.\r\nIndeed, my country is being threatened by the\r\nincessant and poisonous campaign of defamation\r\nagainst my Government that has been orchestrated by\r\npressure groups and by the press of certain countries —\r\nsaying that we in Equatorial Guinea do not respect\r\nhuman rights, calling my Government a dictatorship, as\r\nwell as accusing us of squandering oil revenues. That\r\ncampaign has as its only objective the justification of\r\nan absurd intervention by force in Equatorial\r\nGuinea — the failed multinational mercenary invasion\r\nthat was to have taken place on 6 March last.\r\nThe international community is aware of the\r\nevents connected to that aborted plan thanks to press\r\nreports on the trials, held simultaneously in Equatorial\r\nGuinea and in Zimbabwe, of those mercenaries who\r\nwere arrested in Malabo and in Harare, respectively.\r\nIndeed, and under the pretext of supporting the\r\npolitical claims of a supposed opposition leader in\r\nexile in Spain, a number of mercenaries, of various\r\nnationalities but with a common leadership, acquired a\r\ncargo plane with the goal of transporting to Malabo, in\r\nthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea, 65 trained, armed\r\nmen who were to take part in an invasion — a suicide\r\noperation. They planned to occupy previously\r\nidentified strategic areas, in order physically to remove\r\nthe President of the Republic, members of the\r\nGovernment and anyone who opposed them.\r\nThe invasion, planned for the night of 7 March\r\n2004, would have represented the implementation of an\r\nelaborate plan, hatched, elaborated and perfected by\r\nanother group of 18 men, who had obtained a license to\r\nfly cargo and passenger planes in Equatorial Guinea,\r\nusing the facilities provided by the Government. That\r\ngroup was to join up with those coming from Harare.\r\nThe support that they received from Spain was to\r\ninvolve the use of two Spanish Navy warships with 500\r\nsailors on board, for support in case of resistance. The\r\ngoal was to put in power, at Government headquarters,\r\nMr. Severo Moto Nsa, who had formed a government\r\nin exile that was recognized by the previous\r\nGovernment of Spain.\r\nFortunately, the solidarity of the Governments of\r\nAngola, Zimbabwe and South Africa came into play\r\nand they alerted the security services of my country,\r\nwhich acted immediately, arresting, on the night of 6\r\nMarch, the 18 men stationed in Malabo, while the\r\nHarare Government did the same with those found in\r\nthat capital’s airport on 7 March 2004.\r\nThe mercenaries themselves, in public statements\r\nduring the trials held in Malabo and in Harare,\r\nexplained the plan’s objectives and named the people\r\ninvolved. They also gave details on the financing of the\r\npurchase of arms and of the cargo plane, and on the\r\noffer of the Spanish ships, which were already, at that\r\ntime, anchored in the territorial waters of Equatorial\r\nGuinea.\r\nThe Secretary-General, as well as the Members of\r\nthis Organization, should know that, a month before\r\nthose events, my Government had rejected and\r\ndenounced the sending of those warships to Equatorial\r\nGuinea in a note to the Spanish Government, which at\r\nthe time was using as a pretext its support for the\r\nGovernment of Equatorial Guinea in the conflict\r\nrelated to its claim of sovereignty over the island of\r\nMbañie. This General Assembly can, I am sure,\r\nunderstand the danger and the loss of human life that\r\nthis invasion would have caused if it had succeeded.\r\nWe know that Equatorial Guinea is a victim for\r\nthe sole reason that it has respected the principles and\r\nexercised the fundamental rights of a sovereign State,\r\nwhich are the exercise of sovereignty by the people,\r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other\r\ncountries and the right to the exclusive use of the\r\nresources that nature has given it. If this is so, we\r\nwould like the Assembly to reply to the following\r\nquestions, if possible.\r\nWhy are so many negative things currently being\r\nsaid about Equatorial Guinea in foreign circles, when\r\nthe country’s people themselves live in peace and there\r\nare no demands being made by the populace or from\r\nthe people’s representative bodies?\r\nWhy this talk of dictatorship and oppression in\r\nEquatorial Guinea, when the administration in power\r\nhas re-established political freedom in the country,\r\nwith 13 political parties in a country of barely one\r\nmillion people?\r\nCan a dictatorship based on oppression allow\r\nfreedom such as the current level of foreign investment\r\nand the arrival of more than seventeen international\r\nflights per week to such a small country as Equatorial\r\nGuinea?\r\n42\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nIs there an international police force that has the\r\nauthority to tell Equatorial Guinea how to use its\r\neconomic resources, when we already have an\r\nadministrative and political organization for managing\r\nour resources with transparency? Can a country that\r\ndoes not use its resources for the benefit of the people\r\napprove an annual budget, through parliament, of 618\r\nbillion CFA francs as a justifiable public cost?\r\nIs it true that the only way to end the abuse\r\nallegedly committed by Equatorial Guinea would be to\r\norganize the kind of terrorist and mercenary invasion\r\ntargeted at eliminating innocent people that was\r\nplanned on 6 March 2004?\r\nEquatorial Guinea would like to know whether\r\nthis mercenary system is supported by the international\r\ncommunity. If it is supported, which countries are\r\nresponsible for this crime? We do not believe that there\r\nis any difference between the terrorism that we\r\ncondemn today and the terrorist acts committed by\r\nmercenaries in various parts of the world.\r\nEquatorial Guinea is seriously under threat. We\r\nsay this because we know from reliable sources that\r\nour enemies will not forgive the embarrassment and\r\ndefeat caused by the failure of the mercenary invasion\r\non 6 March. However, this does not mean that\r\nEquatorial Guinea is going to drop its arms or fall on\r\nits knees and let the enemy do with it what it will. We\r\nbelieve that the United Nations responsibility is to\r\nmaintain peace and international security and to avoid\r\na merciless war between countries.\r\nWe would like to affirm that there are countries\r\nwho are Members of this global Organization,\r\nrepresented in this hemicycle, whose security agencies\r\nwere informed of this devilish plan, and who, unlike\r\nAngola, South Africa and Zimbabwe, who expressed\r\ntheir solidarity, simply kept silent, waiting for events to\r\nunfold. But we ask you to leave us in peace, because\r\nEquatorial Guinea is a peaceful country and we do not\r\nthink that we have offended anyone.\r\nA detailed analysis of the situation has shown us\r\nthat the end of the cold war has not actually led to the\r\nunification of humanity and the integration of the\r\nworld as we had hoped. Rather, it has rekindled selfish\r\nand perverse feelings among those who have always\r\ndominated — or have always wanted to dominate —\r\nthe world. The phenomenon of mercenaries, therefore,\r\nis a classic practice of States’ piracy, politically dressed\r\nup and falsely justified by political, economic and\r\nhumanitarian interests. This is why we continue to see\r\nthis defamatory campaign, to justify a possible\r\ninvasion.\r\nNevertheless, Equatorial Guinea does not need to\r\nplease the international community with propaganda\r\nregarding our development. Our only judge and arbiter\r\nis our own people, to which our State institutions must\r\njustify their actions. This tactic of creating a falsified\r\nnegative image of a State is of no surprise to anybody\r\nat the moment, and it should least of all be a surprise to\r\nthis world Organization.\r\nWe also see that the theory of a globalized world\r\nis a fallacy, because, as we very often say, you cannot\r\ncall a dog to you while holding a stick to beat it. We\r\ncannot accept globalization when the concept of\r\ncolonialism, the superiority of some peoples over\r\nothers or even of neo-colonialism still exists.\r\nGlobalization is in contradiction with the concept of\r\nthe superiority of some over others. Globalization does\r\nnot mean exclusion as opposed to integration and\r\ncooperation. Finally, globalization does not mean\r\npower relations such as those that some would like to\r\nimpose.\r\nThe situation in Equatorial Guinea affects other\r\ncountries of Central Africa as well, as the terrorists\r\nthemselves have declared. We know that the\r\nmercenaries have acted in other parts of the world, and\r\nwe bring this to the General Assembly because of the\r\ndestructive effects that have been seen in other affected\r\ncountries. We feel that solidarity among African States\r\nand the third world in general is absolutely\r\nindispensable, because we are the direct victims of\r\nthose who are ordering these mercenary acts.\r\nIn conclusion, we must stop looking backwards.\r\nThe current breakdown of the forces of peace,\r\nindependence and the sovereignty of States, as the\r\nantithesis to the major wars of the past century, shows\r\nus that we are close to unleashing a universal\r\nholocaust. The situation today is that the weakest and\r\nmost needy are ignored and marginalized. We have to\r\nput a stop to this race to chaos and build a world that is\r\nmore respectful of the human race.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Equatorial Guinea for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\n43\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nMr. Miguel Abia Biteo Boricó, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Mr. Rashid\r\nAbdullah Al-Noaimi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe United Arab Emirates.\r\nMr. Al-Noaimi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): Mr. President, on behalf of the United Arab\r\nEmirates, it gives me great pleasure to begin my\r\nstatement by congratulating you, Sir, and your friendly\r\ncountry, the Gabonese Republic, on your election as\r\nPresident of the fifty-ninth session of this Assembly.\r\nGiven your political skills and experience, we are\r\nconfident that you will competently and successfully\r\nlead our deliberations on pressing global and regional\r\nissues. We wish you every success in your endeavours.\r\nOn this occasion, I wish to pay tribute to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Robert Hunte, for his wise and\r\nskilful management of the activities of the previous\r\nsession. It also gives me pleasure to reiterate our\r\nappreciation and gratitude to Mr. Kofi Annan, the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, for his\r\nconsistent efforts to strengthen the leading role of the\r\nUnited Nations, especially in resolving the political\r\nconflicts and economic crises that continue to plague\r\nour world.\r\nNotwithstanding the achievements of the last\r\ncentury and their positive impact on the principles of\r\nliberalization, globalization and freedom, recent\r\nevents, especially during the last few years, have\r\nincluded, violations of human rights, the outbreak of\r\nterrorist attacks and the eruption of violence and\r\nconflicts. These events have, to a great extent, limited\r\npeoples’ ability to reap the benefits of most of these\r\nachievements. Instead of directing efforts towards\r\nsolving the problems related to poverty, the spread of\r\nepidemics, improving sustainable economic,\r\nenvironmental and social development mechanisms\r\nand strengthening international relations — as outlined\r\nin the Millennium Declaration — the world had to\r\ndevote a great part of its efforts to further exploring\r\ncoordinated measures for combating these grave\r\nthreats, which have shaken the underpinnings of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nPrevious experience has shown that regional and\r\ninternational multilateral initiatives built on principles\r\nof partnership, justice, transparency and equality\r\namong peoples and States can address and contain\r\nglobal challenges. Therefore, we are convinced that\r\ncarrying out the reform needed in the existing\r\nstructures of international relations, especially in the\r\nUnited Nations system, has become an important\r\npriority so that its principal organs — the Security\r\nCouncil, the General Assembly and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council — can revitalize their activities and\r\nfulfil their responsibilities in terms of maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nCommitment by all countries and governments to\r\ndischarge their responsibilities in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of international law is a key condition for\r\nenforcing the rule of law and avoiding potential\r\neconomic, environmental and security problems.\r\nTherefore, the United Arab Emirates, as a Member of\r\nthe United Nations, is committed to meet its\r\nobligations, especially those related to promoting\r\nfriendly relations with neighbouring countries,\r\ncooperation in the security and economic fields and\r\nrespect for the sovereignty, national unity and\r\nterritorial integrity and the right to self-determination\r\nof all countries.\r\nProceeding from its belief in the value of\r\ndialogue, peaceful negotiations and legal arbitration in\r\nsettling conflicts and disputes among countries, the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates has pursued a firm and peaceful\r\npolicy regarding the question of the occupation by the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran of our three islands: Greater\r\nTunb, Lesser Tunb and Abou Moussa. The\r\ninternational community is now aware of the legal,\r\nhistorical and political grounds of this case, as well as\r\nall the initiatives, contacts and constant efforts by my\r\ncountry at various levels to find a peaceful solution to\r\nthis question.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates is perplexed at the\r\nposition of Iran and its constant rejection of all\r\npeaceful initiatives and endeavours by the member\r\nStates of the Gulf Cooperation Council to find a\r\npeaceful solution to this important issue. Therefore, the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates calls upon the international\r\ncommunity to urge Iran either to clarify its intentions\r\ntowards the United Arab Emirates by entering\r\nunconditionally into serious bilateral negotiations\r\nwhich ensure restoration of the three occupied islands,\r\ntheir continental shelves and regional airspace and\r\ntheir economic zones to the full sovereignty and\r\nterritorial unity of the United Arab Emirates, or to\r\naccept referral of this case to the International Court of\r\nJustice for arbitration.\r\n44\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nThe regrettable developments taking place on the\r\nsecurity front in the Arabian Gulf region have created\r\nserious challenges to the international community due\r\nto the sensitive nature of this region and the emergence\r\nof new forms of threats, which include terrorist acts,\r\nkidnappings and arbitrary killing of hundreds of\r\ninnocent people in various areas in Iraq and other\r\ncountries. In this context, the United Arab Emirates\r\nexpresses its strong condemnation of all acts of\r\nviolence in Iraq, which if not contained will lead to an\r\nescalation of tension and instability in the entire\r\nregion, as well as the world. We also express our\r\nsupport to the legitimate endeavours of the Iraqi people\r\nand their interim Government to complete\r\narrangements for a peaceful transition of authority as\r\nsoon as possible, to exercise their inalienable right to\r\ndecide their political future and internal affairs, control\r\ntheir natural resources, rebuild their national\r\ninstitutions and maintain security on their borders.\r\nWe also attach great importance to supporting\r\ninternational and regional efforts to help the Iraqi\r\npeople to rehabilitate their destroyed institutions, and\r\nto the unity and solidarity of the Iraqi people especially\r\nduring this critical stage, in order to enable them to\r\nstart a new phase in which security, stability, good-\r\nneighbourly relations and cooperation with all\r\ncountries of the world prevail.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates reiterates its strong\r\ncondemnation of all acts of terrorism in the Gulf\r\nregion, especially in the fraternal Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia and other areas where a number of residential\r\nareas were targets of horrific terrorist attacks. The\r\nUnited Arab Emirates declares its full support for the\r\ncontinuing efforts and measures taken by these\r\ncountries to combat those inadmissible acts, including\r\nthose by the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia to defeat those criminal terrorist attempts inside\r\nSaudi territory.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates believes that\r\nsettlement of the Middle East question cannot be\r\nachieved with the position of a de facto situation of\r\noccupation, settlement, and siege of the Palestinian\r\npeople, who are now facing the worst humanitarian\r\ncrisis in their history because of the acts of arbitrary\r\nkilling, destruction, starvation and unjustified mass\r\ndetentions by the Israeli authorities. The United Arab\r\nEmirates affirms that continuation of the Israeli\r\naggression will inevitably lead to more violence and\r\ndeterioration in the security situation.\r\nWe therefore recall the historical, political and\r\nlegal responsibility of the United Nations and the\r\nQuartet, which is now responsible for finding a\r\nsettlement of the Palestinian question through obliging\r\nIsrael, the occupying Power, to unconditionally comply\r\nwith the terms of the road map and other relevant\r\ninternational resolutions, especially those issued by the\r\nInternational Court of Justice and the General\r\nAssembly that call for dismantling the racist separation\r\nwall in the West Bank, as it is considered illegal and\r\nnull and void.\r\nWe also affirm that establishment of a\r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace in the region\r\ndepends on the ability of the international community\r\nto end Israel’s intransigence, on revitalization of the\r\npeace process and on full Israeli withdrawal from all\r\nPalestinian and other Arab territories occupied since\r\n1967, including East Jerusalem, the Syrian Golan and\r\nthe Shab’a farms. It depends also on the establishment\r\nof a Palestinian State with its capital at Al-Quds al-\r\nSharif, pursuant to the relevant international\r\nresolutions and the fundamentals of the existing Arab\r\npeace initiative, which is based on the principle of land\r\nfor peace. In that context, we also affirm the\r\nimportance of respecting the wishes of the Lebanese\r\npeople and of not interfering in its internal affairs.\r\nAttaining and maintaining balance in the security\r\nsituation in the Middle East and the Gulf region is\r\ntoday a matter of high priority. It requires a\r\ncomprehensive, non-discriminatory, confidence-\r\nbuilding policy that will lead to the elimination of all\r\nexisting arsenals of weapons of mass destruction as\r\npart of an international process of non-proliferation.\r\nHere, we look forward to the outcome of the recent\r\nvisit of the Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to a number of\r\ncountries in the region, which was aimed at convincing\r\ntheir Governments to relinquish the nuclear arsenals\r\nthat pose a threat to neighbouring countries.\r\nIn that connection, we renew our appeal to the\r\ninternational community to take all necessary measures\r\nto compel the Israeli Government to accede to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) and to subject all its nuclear facilities to the\r\nIAEA international safeguards system, so that a zone\r\nfree of weapons of mass destruction can be established\r\nin the Arabian Gulf and the Middle East regions.\r\n45\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nReports of the Secretary-General on the world\r\neconomic and social situation reveal that almost a\r\nbillion people lack food, drinking water, job\r\nopportunities, housing and educational, health and\r\nsocial services. The United Arab Emirates has a good\r\nrecord of providing development and relief assistance\r\nto many countries, and we believe that the international\r\ncommunity should address those challenges as its\r\ncommon responsibility, requiring complete fulfilment\r\nof the commitments and pledges made by developed\r\nnations at United Nations conferences and summits on\r\nsustainable development and on financing for\r\ndevelopment. Those pledges relate to increasing\r\nassistance to developing countries, rescheduling\r\nforeign debt, easing restrictions on foreign trade,\r\nincreasing foreign investment and providing access to\r\nmodern technologies for peaceful purposes. That would\r\nenable developing countries to share equally in the\r\nbenefits of globalization.\r\nFurther, we welcome current efforts to set up a\r\nglobal fund to end poverty by 2015. Here, we affirm\r\nthat there must be progress in negotiations on North-\r\nSouth cooperation and on coordination among regional\r\nand international organizations if we are to put an end\r\nto the negative effects of repeated financial and\r\neconomic crises and ensure steady assistance flows and\r\nthe stability of commodity markets. Policies and\r\nchoices to liberalize world trade and the world\r\neconomy must be reviewed from a development\r\nperspective, taking into account the concerns and needs\r\nof small countries and developing countries, and their\r\nright to attain development and participate in the\r\ninternational decision-making process. This would\r\nenable their economies to avoid stagnation and\r\nmarginalization, and would ensure the implementation\r\nof national programmes to diversify national\r\nproduction, develop human resources and reduce levels\r\nof unemployment, poverty and disease.\r\nWe hope that our deliberations at this session will\r\nhave a positive outcome that will enhance our\r\nperception of our common causes and buttress our joint\r\nefforts to create a prosperous world based on the rule\r\nof law and justice, a world in which tolerance, well-\r\nbeing and progress prevail.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Rodolphe Adada, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of the Republic of the\r\nCongo.\r\nMr. Adada (Congo) (spoke in French): The\r\nelection of Mr. Jean Ping to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session does honour\r\nto our continent, to our subregion of Central Africa and\r\nto his country, Gabon. I congratulate him sincerely on\r\nbehalf of my delegation. We are familiar with Mr.\r\nPing’s high sense of duty, his selfless dedication to his\r\nwork and his great skill, and we have no doubt that —\r\nlike his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte\r\nof Saint Lucia — he will spare no effort to meet our\r\nexpectations.\r\nTo the Secretary-General we say how much we\r\nappreciate his initiatives and his tireless efforts to\r\nmake the Organization more effective.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, Member States made\r\nsolemn and very important commitments. Today,\r\ndespite the fact that some progress has been made in\r\nimplementing the Millennium Development Goals, the\r\nsituation remains troubling. The assessment of the\r\nimplementation of the Goals scheduled for 2005 is thus\r\nof particular importance. Here, we support all\r\ninitiatives that would give fresh impetus to\r\ninternational cooperation to combat poverty and\r\nhunger. I am thinking in particular of the initiative of\r\nHis Excellency President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of\r\nthe Federative Republic of Brazil, which rightly\r\nfocuses on the Millennium Development Goals and on\r\nthe Monterrey Consensus. The African Union’s\r\nExtraordinary Summit on Employment and Poverty\r\nAlleviation in Africa, held on 8 and 9 September in\r\nOuagadougou, Burkina Faso, was also intended to\r\naddress those concerns.\r\nIn spite of all the problems that have hobbled the\r\nDoha round of multilateral trade negotiations, the\r\nresumption of negotiations this summer in Geneva\r\ngives us some reason to hope for the establishment of\r\nequitable rules of international trade. We continue to\r\nhope for greater equity and solidarity among poor and\r\nrich nations with a view to achieving globalization that\r\nis fair. We therefore support the recommendations of\r\nthe World Commission on the Social Dimension of\r\nGlobalization.\r\nTo meet the Millennium Development Goals, we\r\nalso need peace and security — which, unfortunately,\r\nare lacking in a number of regions. The situation in the\r\nMiddle East continues to concern us. Peace, that\r\nfundamental aspiration, remains beyond the grasp of\r\n46\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nthe peoples of the region; it is our joint responsibility\r\nto put in place the conditions for lasting peace.\r\nIn Africa, the attention of the international\r\ncommunity remains focused on the too-great number of\r\ncrises. To be sure, we can be pleased at recent\r\ndevelopments in the situation in Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nfollowing the Accra III summit, but we must continue\r\nto work to make the process irreversible.\r\nIn the Sudan, the Darfur crisis continues to be of\r\ngreat concern, in both its humanitarian and its political\r\ndimensions. A greater mobilization by the international\r\ncommunity is required to support the efforts of the\r\nAfrican Union. The objective is to avoid a disaster and\r\nto ensure peace for the people of the Sudan.\r\nIn our subregion of Central Africa, we were\r\npleased with the positive outcome on 12 July 2004 of\r\nthe national forum held in Sao Tome and Principe,\r\nscheduled under the Memorandum of Understanding,\r\ndated 23 July 2003, and concluded under the auspices\r\nof the Economic Community of Central African States,\r\nthe Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, the\r\nAfrican Union, the United States of America and\r\nNigeria.\r\nIn the Central African Republic, where there is\r\nstill a peacekeeping force of the Central African\r\nEconomic and Monetary Community, supported\r\nlogistically by France, our hope is to see the\r\ndemocratic process move forward and proceed to the\r\ngeneral elections which are scheduled for 2005.\r\nWe welcome the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity in Burundi — in particular, the South\r\nAfrican mediation — for the results achieved to date.\r\nWe call upon the political leaders of that country to\r\nremain focused on the national interests. Unity and\r\ndevelopment in Burundi depend on that.\r\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\npolitical life in the eastern part of the country in\r\nparticular has recently been marked by a number of\r\ngrave events such as the Ituri crisis, the Bukavu\r\nrebellion and the Gatumba massacres. We renew our\r\nsupport for the global and inclusive agreement, as well\r\nas for the institutions for transition.\r\nWe call on the international community to\r\ncontinue to pay all the attention required to that\r\ncountry, and we support all initiatives that would\r\nincrease troop strength and the means of action of the\r\nUnited Nations Organization Mission in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. It is in that context\r\nthat we are pleased with today’s signature of the terms\r\nof reference of the joint oversight mechanism between\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda.\r\nThat overview of the political situation in our\r\nsubregion, which includes a number of countries in\r\npost-conflict situations, fully justifies the request of\r\nCentral Africa to have a United Nations office. We are\r\npleased with the existence of the United Nations\r\nStanding Advisory Committee on Questions of\r\nSecurity in Central Africa and, in particular, the work\r\ngiven to that Committee. We wish to continue to have\r\nthe input of the Committee in its relations with the\r\ncompetent bodies of the subregion, in light of what is\r\nat stake.\r\nSimilarly, we expect implementation of the\r\nconclusions of the multifaceted mission that was\r\ndispatched to Central Africa in June 2003 by the\r\nSecretary-General. We appreciate those conclusions as\r\nbeing very relevant, especially those establishing\r\nprogrammes for disarmament, demobilization and\r\nreintegration to help consolidate the peace processes\r\ntaking place; helping to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS;\r\nstopping the circulation of small arms and light\r\nweapons; protecting the environment and creating\r\nconditions for development in Central Africa.\r\nIn order to meet all of the challenges and to\r\nestablish all the conditions required for stability, we are\r\nplacing our hopes on the international conference for\r\npeace, security, democracy and development in the\r\nGreat Lakes region, preparations for which are already\r\nunder way. That conference will undoubtedly be an\r\nexcellent opportunity to search for lasting solutions to\r\nthe recurrent crises that cause bloodshed in the region.\r\nI reiterate my country’s willingness to make its\r\ncontribution to that process.\r\nAs you know, the Republic of the Congo is\r\namong the countries in our subregion which is in a\r\npost-conflict situation. Under the leadership of\r\nPresident Denis Sassou-Nguesso, Congo is\r\nendeavouring at the same time, to consolidate peace\r\nand to re-establish a comprehensive macroeconomic\r\nequilibrium.\r\nAmong our current priorities, the question of\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration\r\ncontinues to be very important. Our national\r\nprogramme concerning those issues will, for the 2004-\r\n2006 period, involve more than 40,000 ex-combatants.\r\n47\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nThe efforts of the Government, which are supported —\r\nand we appreciate that support — by the European\r\nUnion, the United Nations Development Programme\r\nand the World Bank, will be continued. We would also\r\nappreciate any other contribution that would help the\r\nCongolese Government resolve that thorny issue.\r\nAdditionally, Congo, in hoping to benefit from\r\nthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative, is\r\nvery sensitive to the decisions taken in Paris on 9 and\r\n14 September 2004, respectively, by the Paris Club and\r\nthe donors. Here I reiterate the appreciation of my\r\nGovernment for those efforts. Congo’s eligibility for\r\nthat Initiative will undoubtedly allow us to allocate a\r\nmajority of our resources for development and\r\ntherefore to follow up with what was contained in our\r\nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which we expect\r\nwill be validated by the International Monetary Fund\r\nand the World Bank.\r\nThat would help us succeed in our efforts, within\r\nour national plan, concerning good governance and\r\ntransparency in the management of our national affairs.\r\nTherefore, in following up on those various objectives,\r\nour country has joined the African Peer Review\r\nMechanism under the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment and we have signed on to the Extractive\r\nIndustries Transparency Initiative.\r\nConcerning the environment, we are involved in a\r\npartnership with the international community\r\nconcerning the Congo Basin Initiative. Brazzaville will\r\nshortly host a summit that will consider plans to\r\nconserve the forests of this world heritage area. We\r\ntherefore welcome the support given to that plan by\r\nFrance, the United Nations, the European Union, the\r\nUnited States, Germany, South Africa and a number of\r\nnon-governmental organizations.\r\nCongo reiterates its support for multilateralism.\r\nWe remain convinced that the United Nations is the\r\nideal framework for meeting the challenges that face\r\nthe world. But the world has changed. New challenges\r\nare before us that require reforms that will allow the\r\nUnited Nations to adapt itself to current missions and\r\nthe global configuration of the twenty-first century.\r\nWe therefore welcome the reform process\r\nundertaken by the Secretary-General and are truly\r\nhopeful regarding the recommendations of the high-\r\nlevel panel which was set up to examine the principle\r\nthreats and challenges to collective peace and security\r\nand to make proposals with respect to reform of the\r\ninternational system.\r\nAmong the reforms expected, we firmly support\r\nthe idea of enlarging the Security Council in its two\r\ncomponents, namely, permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers. We must take into account — among other\r\nthings — the diversity of today’s world in order to\r\nhighlight the criteria of geographical representation\r\nand of responsibility in the management of worldwide\r\naffairs, without ever sacrificing effectiveness,\r\ncohesion, transparency or credibility.\r\nAs was stated by the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, in his statement to\r\nthe General Assembly at the 3rd meeting, on\r\n21 September, “today, more than ever, the world needs\r\nan effective mechanism through which to seek common\r\nsolutions to common problems.” In order do this, we\r\nmust not only act together in complying with the rules\r\nthat we ourselves have implemented, but we must also\r\ncomply with the commitments we have made.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the general debate for this meeting. Several\r\nrepresentatives have requested to speak in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply. May I remind members that, in\r\naccordance with General Assembly decision 34/401,\r\nstatements in exercise of the right of reply are limited\r\nto 10 minutes for the first intervention and to 5 minutes\r\nfor the second and should be made by delegations from\r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Vengesa (Zimbabwe): I make this statement\r\non behalf of my Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nMr. Stanislaus I. G. Mudenge.\r\n“The Minister of the Netherlands, speaking\r\non behalf of the European Union, expressed\r\nconcern about what he called the situation in\r\nZimbabwe. I am not sure whether by ‘situation in\r\nZimbabwe’ he is alluding to the recent successful\r\nland reform and redistribution exercise, which we\r\nhave just completed. I want to assure the Minister\r\nthat the exercise, far from being a cause for\r\nconcern, is truly a reason for celebration — a\r\nfulfilment of the liberation struggle.\r\n“Secondly, the Minister urges my country to\r\ncomply with the Southern Africa Development\r\nCommunity’s (SADC) guidelines for democratic\r\nelections, which were adopted by SADC last\r\nmonth. The Minister is being rather arrogant and\r\n48\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\npresumptuous by positing himself and his\r\ncolleagues as the enforcers of the SADC\r\nguidelines. Those guidelines belong to SADC, a\r\ngroup of free independent former colonies in\r\nsouthern Africa that do not accept any tutelage,\r\nespecially from former colonial masters we\r\nfought and defeated only yesterday. Zimbabwe\r\nwas an active partner in the formulation of the\r\nSADC guidelines and has already taken prompt\r\nand firm steps to implement those guidelines.\r\n“Thirdly, Zimbabwe calls on the\r\nNetherlands, the United Kingdom and the United\r\nStates to desist from their daily, poisonous anti-\r\nZimbabwe-Government propaganda emanating\r\nfrom their clandestine radio stations. Those three\r\ncountries are destabilizing my country through\r\nradio programmes targeted at my country. I say to\r\nthe Netherlands: stop your wicked broadcasts\r\nagainst my country through your so-called ‘voice\r\nof the people’ station, the United States through\r\nthe ‘Studio 7’ station and the British through the\r\nso-called ‘short-wave’ radio station. Those\r\nweapons of mass deception have been unleashed\r\nagainst my country for the last two years.\r\n“Furthermore, I call upon the Netherlands\r\nand those among its allies who are pouring\r\nmillions of dollars into non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGO), and even through church\r\nleaders, to support the opposition party in my\r\ncountry, to desist from this blatant interference in\r\nthe internal affairs of my country.\r\n“Lastly, I hope that the Netherlands will be\r\nprepared to accept the verdict of the people of\r\nZimbabwe next year, when they once again reject\r\nthe British-sponsored, and Dutch-supported,\r\npuppet opposition party in my country.”\r\nMrs. Hasteh (Islamic Republic of Iran): This\r\nevening, the Foreign Minister of the United Arab\r\nEmirates made some unacceptable claims against the\r\nterritorial integrity of my country. As we have clearly\r\nand repeatedly placed on record our position on that\r\nissue on previous occasions, I do not need to go into\r\ndetails. The Islamic Republic of Iran is fully committed\r\nto its international obligations, especially those arising\r\nfrom the memorandum of understanding of 1971. We\r\nfirmly believe that misunderstandings over the\r\ninterpretation or application of that memorandum of\r\nunderstanding, if any, should be addressed with good\r\nwill and through mutually agreed mechanisms, in order\r\nto find an acceptable solution.\r\nMeanwhile, my Government has always\r\nwelcomed the interaction and exchange of views\r\nbetween officials of Iran and the United Arab Emirates\r\non issues of interest and concern to both our countries.\r\nWe believe that dialogue between our two\r\nGovernments can play a determining role in removing\r\nany existing misunderstandings.\r\nMr. Al-Habsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): My country, which has always been keen to\r\nexpress its firm and principled position with regard to\r\nthe national cause just referred to, must again reiterate\r\nits deep disappointment about the repeated claims\r\nmade by the representatives of Iran annually in this\r\nHall. Those claims contravene all historical and legal\r\ndocuments and demographic facts that prove that the\r\nthree islands in question are part of the sovereignty of\r\nthe United Arab Emirates. It is for that reason that we\r\ntoday raised the question of why Iran has not submitted\r\nfactual proof and legal and historical evidence and\r\ndocuments to show that that country has been entitled,\r\nsince 1971, to occupy those three islands belonging to\r\nthe United Arab Emirates, as well as to change the\r\nhistorical, political and demographic character of the\r\nislands.\r\nTherefore, in accordance with the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and the\r\nnorms of international law, we call upon the\r\ninternational community to work to urge the\r\nGovernment of Iran to translate its good intentions\r\ntowards the United Arab Emirates by either\r\nunconditionally entering into direct bilateral\r\nnegotiations in order, once and for all, to put an end to\r\nthe occupation of the three islands and return them to\r\ntheir original Arab inhabitants, or by resorting to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice for a legal settlement of\r\nthe issue, following the examples provided by similar\r\ncases that have thus been resolved.\r\nMy country, which believes that stability in the\r\nArabian Gulf region requires the establishment of\r\ngood-neighbourly relations on the basis of respect for\r\nthe sovereignty, independence and integrity of all\r\nMember States, will be committed to accepting the\r\nruling of the International Court of Justice, as we are\r\nconfident about our political, legal and historical rights\r\nto the three islands in question, which are an integral\r\npart of our homeland and of the territorial integrity, air\r\n49\r\nA/59/PV.6\r\nspace, continental shelf and exclusive economic zone\r\nof the United Arab Emirates, which is indivisible and\r\nshould not be jeopardized under any circumstances.\r\nMr. Hamburger (Netherlands): I will be very\r\nbrief. The Netherlands, speaking in its capacity as\r\nPresident of the European Union, regrets Zimbabwe’s\r\nreaction to the European Union’s statement delivered\r\nyesterday by the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands.\r\nWe wish to reiterate the European Union’s commitment\r\nto the rule of law, including the need for free and fair\r\nelections. We consider that an international standard to\r\nwhich all countries should adhere.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the\r\nrepresentative of Spain on a point of order.\r\nMr. Oyarzún (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nsimply want to say that, given the comments made by\r\nthe Prime Minister of Equatorial Guinea — in which he\r\nreferred to Spain — my delegation reserves its right of\r\nreply, which it will exercise at the appropriate time.\r\nThe meeting rose at 8.30 p.m.\r\n"
