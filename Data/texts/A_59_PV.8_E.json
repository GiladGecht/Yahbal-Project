(Gabon)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Henrique Pereira Rosa, President of\r\nthe Republic of Guinea-Bissau\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau.\r\nMr. Henrique Pereira Rosa, President of the\r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Henrique\r\nPereira Rosa, President of the Republic of Guinea-\r\nBissau, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Pereira Rosa (spoke in Portuguese;\r\ninterpretation from French text provided by the\r\ndelegation): Thirty years ago, my country attained its\r\nnational sovereignty. Indeed, it was on 17 September\r\n1974 that the young Republic of Guinea-Bissau was\r\nadmitted to the United Nations as a full-fledged\r\nMember State. Three decades, to be sure, is a short\r\ntime in terms of nation-building. But it is a long time if\r\nyou consider that in most African countries, including\r\nmy own, life expectancy does not exceed 50 years.\r\nThat bitter reality is the true measure of the time that\r\nhas elapsed and of what my country has achieved since\r\nindependence. Hence, for us in Guinea-Bissau, this is\r\nan important time for reflection, indeed for\r\nintrospection, in the light of recent events and of the\r\nsuccessive crises we have confronted of late.\r\nI address the Assembly today as the transitional\r\nPresident of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau.\r\nAddressing the Assembly gives me particular pleasure,\r\nSir, because you  Mr. Jean Ping, the outstanding\r\nMinister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe brotherly and friendly Gabonese Republic  are\r\npresiding over the Assemblys work with the skill,\r\nexperience and talent we all know so well.\r\nWe have come to New York in search of new\r\nideas for innovative and resolute action, ideas that will\r\naffect the way we think and will have a positive impact\r\non our joint efforts to create a new world of peace,\r\nfreedom and social justice for all countries and peoples\r\nrepresented here.\r\nIt was with great attention and interest that we\r\nlistened to the outstanding statement made here two\r\ndays ago by Secretary-General Kofi Annan (see\r\nA/59/PV.3). His observations were thought-provoking.\r\nFor our part, we share his vision of the world as it is\r\ntoday and as it should be tomorrow. Above all, we\r\nappreciate his dedication and determination at the head\r\nof the Organization, whose irreplaceable role is\r\nincreasingly evident throughout the world.\r\nWe live today in a world of ever more striking\r\ncontrasts, imbalances, contradictions and inequalities.\r\nOn the one hand, we are witness to increasingly\r\nmarvellous scientific and technological progress, from\r\nwhich certain countries benefit greatly. On the other\r\n2\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nhand, hundreds of millions of people continue to live\r\nprecarious lives and to suffer from malnutrition and\r\nendemic disease. This situation is not only inhuman\r\nand immoral, it is dangerous. It is sowing all the seeds\r\nthat provoke frustration and despair, fuel rancour and\r\nhatred and lead to irrational behaviour and to actions\r\nendangering peace and international security.\r\nCombating poverty and epidemics such as\r\nHIV/AIDS throughout the world does not mean kindness\r\nor charity; it is common sense that requires that together\r\nwe mobilize our actions to combat those scourges. I am\r\ngratified by the initiative of certain heads of State  in\r\nparticular, President Lula da Silva  in recalling to\r\neach of us our responsibilities in the fight to eradicate\r\nhunger and destitution in a world as interdependent as\r\nthe one in which we live today. It is critical here to\r\nunderstand that there is an urgent need to act, and to\r\nact properly. Above all, let us not wait for more reports\r\nor analyses to be submitted to us first, regardless of\r\nhow visionary or relevant they may be. Thousands of\r\nwomen, children and infants die every day because\r\nthey lack a pill or a vaccination. That is unjust; that is\r\nimmoral.\r\nWe must pool our efforts to establish more\r\nequitable relations among States. International trade\r\nmust be better regulated, just as globalization and its\r\neffects on the world economy must be better\r\ncontrolled, to allow for a more equitable distribution of\r\nthe riches of the world. Rather than leaving the\r\nunderdeveloped countries to suffer from the effects of\r\nglobalization, let us create for them the conditions\r\nnecessary for their integration into the process, which\r\nis utterly beyond their control and whose social\r\ndimension must be the subject of specific measures so\r\nas to mitigate negative consequences.\r\nToday it is clear to everyone that to ensure peace\r\nthroughout the world there is a need to promote the\r\ndevelopment of the poorest countries and to improve\r\nthe living conditions of populations, in particular by\r\nguaranteeing them access to drinking water, health and\r\neducation  especially for girls. Above all there is a\r\nneed to create a social and political environment that is\r\nstable and is likely to release that creative energy of\r\neach and every individual and to promote the\r\nparticipation of all citizens in the management of the\r\naffairs of State of their country.\r\nThe rights of each and every person must be\r\nrespected, and all liberties provided by the law must be\r\nguaranteed without any impediment. The rule of law\r\nmust be consolidated to allow each institution to\r\nfunction properly and effectively. I am thinking in\r\nparticular of justice, which must be able to act with full\r\nindependence and with scrupulous respect for the\r\nseparation of executive, legislative and judicial powers.\r\nGuinea-Bissau, unfortunately, has not escaped\r\nfrom the cycle of violence and political crisis that\r\nseems today to have become a prerogative of the\r\nAfrican countries. Our country has recently suffered\r\nfrom the disastrous consequences of an economic\r\npolicy that is poorly adapted to the real needs of the\r\npopulation. The domestic conflict we have been\r\nexperiencing in Guinea-Bissau since 1998 could have\r\nbeen avoided. It has further impoverished a country\r\nthat is among the least developed countries and where\r\neverything must still be built because nothing could\r\nresist destruction. We are aware of the seriousness of\r\nthe situation and of the need to pool our efforts to make\r\nthe necessary changes, which our people have a right to\r\nexpect from their leaders.\r\nOur people have suffered too much and for too\r\nlong and have made too many sacrifices. We must\r\ncreate new conditions that provide reasons for hope.\r\nWe have successfully initiated national dialogue based\r\non mutual respect and taking into account the national\r\ninterest. We have created a new culture of peace based\r\non our affiliation with one single country with all its\r\ndiversity and social and cultural riches. We have\r\ndecided to make democracy an immutable reality.\r\nHowever, we are aware that democracy is not\r\neasy to build in a poor country where the illiteracy rate\r\nis still high and where the fundamental infrastructure is\r\nstill severely lacking. Nevertheless, we continue to be\r\ninspired by the courage of our people and by the\r\nsupport of other countries  those of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), the\r\nUnion Économique et Monétaire Ouest-africaine\r\n(UEMOA) and the Community of Portuguese-speaking\r\nCountries in particular  and the European Union,\r\nChina and the rest of the international community.\r\nThus last March we were able to organize legislative\r\nelections that the international community considered\r\njust and credible and to establish a new parliament, the\r\nrole of which is fundamental in any democracy. We\r\nwill also be organizing presidential elections in April\r\n2005, as agreed in the Charter of Transition, thus\r\nallowing for the restoration of constitutional order.\r\n3\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nGuinea-Bissau needs the assistance of the\r\ninternational community to meet the many enormous\r\nchallenges confronting it. That assistance is urgent and\r\nimportant. We have created mechanisms for the\r\nrigorous control of State revenues and expenditures\r\nand, with the assistance of the UNDP and the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions in particular, all the necessary\r\nconditions for the transparent management of public\r\nproperty, which allows us to combat corruption.\r\nTo enable us to relaunch our economy rapidly, we\r\nare planning to hold a round table in December. We\r\nhope that India, Brazil and South Africa will be\r\nassisting us in that initiative to combat poverty and\r\nhelping us in the organization we have created in our\r\ncountry.\r\nWe have here a great opportunity to express our\r\ngratitude for the commitment and dynamic action of\r\nthe Economic and Social Councils Ad Hoc Advisory\r\nGroup on Guinea-Bissau and its partners, an\r\nindispensable instrument for advancing constructive\r\ndialogue between Guinea-Bissau and its partners for\r\ndevelopment, including the World Bank and the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund. I should like to thank\r\nthem from this rostrum for their continued support. So,\r\ntoo, we wish to reaffirm our great appreciation for the\r\nmembers of the Security Council who visited our\r\ncountry last June and showed their great interest in it.\r\nFor the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity Guinea-Bissau, speaking before the great\r\nmajority of the Members of the Organization, hopes\r\nthat the Security Councils part will be strengthened by\r\nenhancing its membership to better reflect the world\r\nsituation. From this rostrum, I would like to say how\r\ngrateful we are to those who supported us in the first\r\nphase of our transition.\r\nHumanity is one and indivisible. The men and\r\nwomen who inhabit our planet share the same\r\naspirations: peace and well-being. Every individual,\r\nwhatever the continent he belongs to, feels the same\r\nfrustration when confronting injustice, impunity and\r\nviolations of the rights of the human being. There is\r\nnot a single child who does not feel the need to be\r\nloved and protected by his or her parents and who does\r\nnot hope to grow up in a home where peace and love\r\nreign. How can we protect them if nothing is done to\r\nguarantee the rights of women and give a suitable\r\neducation to young women? How can we prevent the\r\nmother, and the child she brings into the world,\r\nbecoming victims of an endemic illness such as AIDS,\r\ntuberculosis or malaria at a time when most poor\r\ncountries are incapable of providing basic health care?\r\nTomorrows world is being built today. Thanks to\r\nthe awareness of the real challenges, in this planetary\r\nvillage in which we all live, with its advantages and its\r\nproblems, our human condition must be the common\r\ndenominator on which and around which all people of\r\ngood will should come together in order to make our\r\nworld more fair, more tolerant and based more on\r\nsolidarity.\r\nWhether we are discussing crises in Africa or in\r\nthe Middle East, or the fight against terrorism  a\r\nfight that requires us all to mobilize our efforts  we\r\nmust be animated by the same determination to seek\r\nlasting solutions based on consensus.\r\nThe peoples we represent expect us to take\r\nconcrete actions. They hope that we will be able to\r\novercome our differences and pool our efforts so as to\r\nrespond to their most urgent needs. Many praiseworthy\r\ninitiatives to eradicate hunger, poverty, malnutrition\r\nand illiteracy have been undertaken. We must involve\r\nnon-governmental organizations and other elements of\r\ncivil society. In other words, we must appeal to all\r\npeople of goodwill.\r\nThe nations of the world all share the planet\r\nEarth, on which we all live. It is our responsibility to\r\nprotect it so that we can provide our children and our\r\nchildrens children with the conditions for a healthy\r\nlife lived in dignity.\r\nEnvironmental protection alone is not enough.\r\nWe must also create a climate of peace throughout the\r\nworld. That cannot be done without the help of each\r\nMember State: it must be a collective effort in which\r\ndialogue and agreement take precedence and where the\r\nrule of law prevails in international relations. None of\r\nour peoples can live in isolation in the self-reliant\r\nmanner of the past. The interdependence of the global\r\neconomy is now a reality for all of us. Let us take\r\nadvantage of the resources of the Earth without\r\nabusing our ecosystems, because the future of the\r\nplanet depends on our capacity to think in terms of the\r\ncollective interest. Let us act in a spirit of humanism\r\nand solidarity whenever the poorest of the poor\r\nconfront calamity and natural disasters  disasters\r\nsuch as those that have recently afflicted Haiti, the\r\nDominican Republic and other Caribbean countries.\r\n4\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nLet us understand the true dimension and\r\nmeaning of the spiritual force that resides in each\r\nhuman being  a force to which we can turn at times\r\nof doubt and discouragement in order to regain the will\r\nand the energy we need to overcome our challenges.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of Guinea-Bissau for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nMr. Henrique Pereira Rosa, President of the\r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Al Hadji Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh,\r\nPresident of the Republic of the Gambia\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of the Gambia.\r\nAl Hadji Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, President of the\r\nRepublic of the Gambia, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Al Hadji Yahya A.\r\nJ. J. Jammeh, President of the Republic of the Gambia,\r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Jammeh: I should like, Sir, to\r\ncongratulate you on your assumption of the presidency\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. This\r\nsession might well prove to be epoch-making in that\r\nthis body will be called upon to consider and to make\r\nfar-reaching decisions on what ought to be done to\r\nrevitalize our Organization and to better align it to fit\r\ntodays imperatives for global security, peace and\r\ndevelopment. I have no doubt that you will live up to\r\nour expectations and that, given your wisdom and vast\r\nexperience, you will guide our deliberations to a\r\nsuccessful outcome. You may rest assured, Mr. President,\r\nthat you will receive my delegations fullest cooperation.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to pay\r\ntribute to your predecessor, the very energetic and\r\ndynamic outgoing President, Mr. Julian E. Hunte, who\r\nconducted the business of the fifty-eighth session with\r\ngusto, dedication and courage, and who helped us to\r\naddress some difficult issues. My delegation wishes\r\nhim all the very best in his future endeavours.\r\nTo our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, I\r\nexpress my deep appreciation for yet another year of\r\ndedicated service to the Organization  indeed, to\r\nhumanity at large. Some of the problems that were laid\r\nbefore him were not easy to resolve but, as expected,\r\nresolved they were. I hope that his efforts to ensure the\r\ntriumph of multilateralism, the resolution of disputes\r\nand the pursuit of meaningful cooperation among\r\nnations will be further bolstered during the session that\r\nis just beginning.\r\nI stand here representing the young people of the\r\nworld. My statement is very long, and is divided into\r\ntwo parts: one part will be circulated to\r\nrepresentatives; I will read out the other part.\r\nWorld leaders have stood at this rostrum on many\r\noccasions, addressing the world. We made pledges to\r\nthe children of the world during the twenty-seventh\r\nspecial session  the childrens summit  in 2002.\r\nDuring that special session, we pledged to create a\r\nbetter world and an environment conducive to the\r\nwellbeing of the children of the world. We have also\r\ncome up with objectives for global development so as\r\nto make the world a better place for humanity by 2015.\r\nSo far, there is no indication that those objectives will\r\nbe achieved in the next 2,000 years.\r\nWhat are the problems? Since the childrens\r\nsummit took place, we have seen the condition of the\r\nworlds children become more and more desperate.\r\nChildren are being butchered throughout the world.\r\nChildrens rights are being violated. Children are being\r\nsold into slavery, and they are being terrorized by\r\nadults  we, who are supposed to take care of them.\r\nWe have seen the economies of small States\r\ncollapse as a result of rising oil prices. I come from a\r\nvolatile part of the world, but I do not represent only\r\nAfrica; I represent the young people of the world, whose\r\nfuture is very bleak if the status quo is not addressed.\r\nWhat are the problems of humanity today? They\r\nare man-made problems, and, because they are man-\r\nmade, we will be able to resolve them. The solution to\r\nthose problems lies with us, human beings \r\nirrespective of race, colour, creed or religion.\r\nThe problem of development can best be\r\nsummarized thus: as long as there is violence and as long\r\nas there is no peace or global security, we, the poorer\r\nparts of humanity, will always become poorer and poorer,\r\nwhile the richer nations will become richer and richer.\r\n5\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nThere cannot be any development without peace\r\nand stability. There cannot be peace or stability without\r\ndemocracy, justice and equality. The main problem of\r\nhumanity today  which is creating all our other\r\nproblems  is a result of four human tendencies:\r\ngreed, double standards, intolerance and hypocrisy.\r\nNone of us here can look into the faces of our\r\nchildren and assure them of a bright future or of their\r\nsafety. Because of greed, human life has been reduced\r\nto naught. People want to become rich at the expense\r\nof human life. Greed can come in many forms. The\r\ninsatiable appetite for world domination and\r\nintolerance  those are things that face humanity today.\r\nOur problem is not a confrontation between Islam\r\nand other religions. The problem of terrorism is a\r\nhuman characteristic. No good Muslim would ever\r\ncommit a terrorist act. But, because the world has\r\nbecome so bad, lawlessness is rampant, and those who\r\nwant to take out their frustrations on other human\r\nbeings can do so in the name of Islam or any other\r\nreligion.\r\nI have listened to my colleagues who have spoken\r\nhere. But, as long as certain issues are not addressed,\r\nthere will be no peace, and the war against terror will\r\nbecome an elusive fight that we will always lose.\r\nSome of us believe that, because we disapproved\r\nof the war in Iraq in the beginning, it is not our\r\nbusiness to help solve it now. But let me assure the\r\nAssembly that the war in Iraq has more far-reaching\r\nconsequences for humanity  and particularly for the\r\nchildren whom we pledged to support at the World\r\nSummit for Children  than for anything else. We\r\nhave seen our economies collapse because of high oil\r\nprices that rise higher every day. It is our collective\r\nresponsibility to put an end to the war in Iraq. We have\r\nseen the rise of global terrorism; the world is a more\r\ndangerous place today than during the cold war. The\r\nwar in Iraq  regardless of whether or not we\r\nsupported it  is a human tragedy, and it is not in our\r\ninterests, as the human race, to let that war continue\r\nbecause we disapprove of what has happened. Two\r\nwrongs cannot make a right. Even if we believe that\r\nthe war was wrong, it is the responsibility of the entire\r\nhuman race to help put an end to the suffering of the\r\nIraqi people. We have seen children being butchered in\r\nBeslan, Russia; we have seen Palestinian and Israeli\r\nchildren being butchered. The problem is not a\r\nreligious problem but a political one, because we, the\r\nleaders of the world, want to teach others a lesson by\r\nmaking them suffer. That is a human tragedy.\r\nWe cannot be diplomats here if we want to solve\r\nthe worlds problems. It is amazing that, when certain\r\nactions that are described as terrorist acts are carried\r\nout by other parties, they are described as retaliation\r\nfor something. An unlawful act that destroys human\r\nlife is a terrorist act, regardless of its objective or the\r\nrationale behind it.\r\nIf poverty is not addressed, there will be\r\ndesperation and hunger. And, if human beings are\r\ndesperate, they can resort to actions that are horrific to\r\nthe rest of us. We have seen that some parts of the\r\nworld are very rich and that other parts  including\r\nAfrica, where I come from  are becoming poorer and\r\npoorer. If the worlds wealth is not distributed equally,\r\nthere will be imbalances and inequities, and there will\r\nbe people who are desperate. If people are desperate,\r\nthey will do anything to survive.\r\nHowever, that does not mean that one can justify\r\nviolence. I do not justify violence in any form, because\r\nI believe that peace and stability would augur well for\r\nour children. The fight against terror is global. Let us\r\nbe mindful of the consequences of allowing terror to be\r\nseen as a legitimate act.\r\nWe have seen double standards being applied\r\nwhen resolutions are adopted for the good of humanity\r\nby the international community  which is represented\r\nhere  and, in some cases, are enforced to the letter,\r\nwhereas a few States are above international law and\r\nUnited Nations resolutions.\r\nThat brings me to the issue of nuclear weapons.\r\nAs a human being and as a peacemaker, I believe that,\r\nfollowing the end of the cold war, no nation should\r\nhave been able to justify the possession of nuclear\r\nweapons, much less become a new nuclear Power. If\r\npowerful nations continue to keep their nuclear\r\nweapons  and there are many double standards in the\r\nway we deal with one another  that will only become\r\nan enticement for others to opt for nuclear weapons\r\nbecause they think such weapons will serve as an\r\ninsurance policy against attacks.\r\nI know that, during the 1980s, there was a\r\ncampaign to promote nuclear disarmament. Today, in\r\nthe new millennium, that campaign should be\r\nstrengthened through a United Nations resolution\r\nmaking it illegal for anyone to possess nuclear\r\n6\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nweapons. We have seen conflicts simmering that will\r\nhave drastic consequences for humanity  conflicts\r\naimed at preventing certain States from acquiring\r\nnuclear weapons. Now that the Soviet empire no longer\r\nexists, all nuclear weapons  whether they are\r\npossessed by the Gambia or by any other country \r\nshould be eliminated. Just imagine one bomb killing\r\nmillions of people. And here we stand, telling everyone\r\nthat the world will be a better place for mankind. I believe\r\nin the peaceful resolution of all conflicts. Indeed, as far\r\nas I know, there is no licensing authority for the\r\npossession of nuclear weapons; therefore, no one can\r\ndecide who should and who should not have them.\r\nWe should take a bold step to ensure that no one\r\nhas nuclear weapons. In this forum, on behalf of the\r\nworlds children, I appeal to those who aspire to\r\npossess nuclear weapons that that is the wrong path to\r\ntake. Peace and stability cannot be ensured through the\r\npossession of nuclear weapons. The strength of a\r\nnation is not based on its firepower or its nuclear\r\narsenal, but is determined by its ability to make the\r\nworld a better place for humanity, including its own\r\ncitizens. Nuclear weapons are not a solution.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Republic of the Gambia for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nAl Hadji Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, President of the\r\nRepublic of the Gambia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ricardo Maduro Joest, President of\r\nthe Republic of Honduras\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Honduras.\r\nMr. Ricardo Maduro Joest, President of the\r\nRepublic of Honduras, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Ricardo\r\nMaduro Joest, President of the Republic of Honduras,\r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Maduro Joest (spoke in Spanish): For\r\nthe second time, I have this special opportunity of\r\nappearing before you in the common home of the\r\nnations of the world. Everyone knows that we live in a\r\ntime of great risks and problems, but also of great\r\nopportunities. Allow me to refer to two challenges,\r\nwhich in my opinion are the most important: the lack\r\nof security and the existence of poverty.\r\nFirst of all, I must refer to the lack of security. I\r\nbelieve that it is obvious to everyone that the durability\r\nof our democratic system and the alleviation of poverty\r\nrequire us to provide for the security of each one of our\r\ncitizens. My Government is committed to that. The\r\nsafety of my compatriots is my first priority. I am\r\ncommitted to ensuring respect for human rights and,\r\nwithin that concept, I am even more committed to\r\nensuring the protection and the security of honest and\r\nhard-working citizens. If we all strive to provide\r\nsecurity and reduce our citizens level of poverty, we\r\nwill also be combating terrorists, and we will be\r\nwinning the battle against those who take advantage of\r\nthe positive qualities of democracy to destroy it\r\nthrough terror.\r\nCombating terrorism begins by combating crime\r\nand delinquency in our countries. We are committed to\r\nthis struggle, and we know that we are not alone. This\r\nis, in fact, a universal challenge. We know that we can\r\nonly confront it if we are together. Crime, delinquency\r\nand terrorism have, in effect, already undergone\r\nglobalization and our actions, therefore, must be\r\nequally based on international cooperation.\r\nOrganized crime appears in many shapes and\r\nforms. However, few are as degrading as drug\r\ntrafficking. Few crimes generate as much corruption or\r\nso thoroughly destroy the core of our society and our\r\nvalues than drug trafficking. My country is on the drug\r\ntrafficking route. We are right in the middle of the\r\ncorridor that links the producers to the consumers. We\r\nare victims of the greed of the producers and the\r\nperverted desires of the consumers. Over the past 18\r\nmonths in Honduras, we have impounded more drugs\r\nthan in all the previous nine years, but this is obviously\r\nstill not enough. Combating organized crime and drug\r\ntrafficking, if we are alone, will be almost impossible.\r\nThe Governments of the countries in which drugs are\r\nproduced, the countries that are used to transport the\r\ndrugs and the countries in which the drugs are\r\nconsumed must, together, confront this. If we are\r\nalone, the poor countries have very few chances of\r\nsucceeding. If we remain alone, we will have to divert\r\nresources that we need to combat poverty towards\r\ncombating drug trafficking and organized crime. We\r\n7\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nneed more resolute, direct and substantial support if we\r\nare to confront this tremendous challenge. I would like\r\nto say to the wealthy countries: let us work together to\r\nconfront this scourge of our time.\r\nSecurity also implies the rule of law and, for over\r\nthree years, we have worked to bring it about. We have\r\ncombated corruption by closing businesses that\r\nengaged in tax evasion, eliminated the immunity of\r\npublic servants and promoted a responsible use of State\r\nresources. We have achieved a great deal, but we\r\nrecognize that a great deal remains to be done. We\r\nrecently adopted a property law, which, for the first\r\ntime in our history, enables the poor to hold deeds to\r\ntheir land. This may seem simple and almost trivial in\r\ndeveloped countries, but on our continent, by and\r\nlarge, the poor have not enjoyed the benefit of these\r\nvaluable deeds. Eighty-four per cent of Honduras\r\ncitizens do not have a title to the plot of land on which\r\nthey live. We are opening new pathways, and before\r\nmy Government completes its mandate, we hope that\r\nhundreds of thousands of poor people will hold, for the\r\nfirst time, registered titles to their property.\r\nSecurity also implies peaceful relationships with\r\nour neighbours. For the first time in our history, our\r\nland borders have been defined, and they are now\r\nbeing conclusively demarcated. What is even more\r\nimportant is that this was achieved without spilling\r\nblood and without bellicose threats. We resorted to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice in The Hague and we\r\nhave complied with its rulings. As far as Honduras is\r\nconcerned, solving a border dispute is not something\r\nthat can be achieved through violence. It can be achieved\r\npeacefully, through international jurisprudence.\r\nHaving now consolidated our land borders, we\r\nare defining our maritime borders, and we have once\r\nagain had recourse to the International Court of Justice.\r\nIn our opinion, the time has now come to take the\r\nnext step. The time has come to declare Central America\r\na zone of peace, a zone that renounces violence as a\r\nmeans of resolving disputes. To consolidate this\r\nprocess with the support of the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, we have already eliminated all the\r\nlandmines that were placed around our country years\r\nago, and we can now say with pride that we are a\r\ncountry that is entirely free of landmines. To bring this\r\nprocess to completion, we now propose reducing the\r\nnumber of weapons of war throughout the region. To\r\nlend credibility to this process, we invite the United\r\nNations to accompany us and to certify compliance on\r\nthe part of each of our countries. We also invite the\r\ninternational community to join us in this process.\r\nWe propose that the process of arms reduction be\r\nsupported with fresh resources to combat poverty. We\r\npropose an exchange: weapons of war in exchange for\r\nfunding for poverty alleviation. Please support us.\r\nPoverty, and even more, hunger and malnutrition, are\r\nthe most fearsome enemies of our democratic systems.\r\nA democracy based on empty stomachs is an empty\r\ndemocracy. All the research that has been carried out,\r\nincluding studies by the United Nations, tell us that,\r\ntoday as never before, formal democracy prevails\r\nthroughout our continent, in Latin America. However,\r\nthe same studies tell us that, today more than ever,\r\ndissatisfaction with our democratic systems is rampant.\r\nPoverty undermines our democracies and hunger\r\nerodes them. We know that combating poverty and\r\nhunger is an effort that must be shared by all. In our\r\ncase, in Honduras, with much participation on the part\r\nof our citizens, we have devised a strategy to combat\r\npoverty that incorporates the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. This legacy has been refined and perfected over\r\nthe past two years. The strategy to combat poverty is\r\nthe very foundation of our vision as a country and of\r\nour planning as a nation.\r\nHowever, alone and in isolation, our efforts\r\nundoubtedly will not be able to produce the hoped-for\r\nresults for our people. We require the support of the\r\ninternational community. International cooperation is\r\nnot a handout; it is an investment. Everyone, absolutely\r\neveryone, derives benefit from it. Our small economies\r\nare open to international trade and to globalization. We\r\ndo not fear this challenge; in fact, we see that it\r\nprovides tremendous opportunities to us.\r\nHowever, we will not be able to overcome our\r\npoverty if the rules of international trade are not fair.\r\nWe firmly believe that protected markets lead only to\r\nstagnation and the growth of poverty. It is not fair that\r\nwhile we are opening our markets, other countries are\r\ngiving subsidies to their producers.\r\nWe welcome the decision of the United States to\r\nreturn to the International Coffee Organization, but at\r\nthe same time we ask that the hundreds of thousands of\r\nfamilies that grow coffee in rural areas be paid better.\r\nLet me give you an example. Five years ago, our\r\nfarmers earned 40 per cent of the price of coffee served\r\nto the final consumer. Today, they earn only 9 per cent,\r\n8\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nwhile the companies in developed countries pocket the\r\ndifference. I invite the presidents and heads of State of\r\ncoffee-producing countries to work together until we\r\nachieve a better price for all of our farmers. Together,\r\nproducers and consumers, we can make sure that coffee\r\nis not a bitter drink for the producers.\r\nIf the price of coffee can have a rapid and\r\nmassive impact on the struggle against poverty, the\r\nprice of oil, when it rises, rapidly makes our poverty\r\nmuch worse. In the case of my country, over the past\r\nyear the increased bill for oil is 12 times what we\r\nspend on providing school lunches to 870,000 boys and\r\ngirls who used to go to school without eating every\r\nday. This is 12 times what it took us years and many\r\nsacrifices to achieve. The world has seldom seen so\r\nmassive a transfer of resources from poor importing\r\ncountries to wealthy oil-exporting countries.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to appeal to\r\ninternational conscience, and in particular to the\r\nconscience of oil-exporting countries, that we may\r\nestablish a trading system that brings about a reduction\r\nin the price of oil and helps to stabilize it. We need a\r\nsystem that takes account of poverty in countries and\r\nof the efforts that are being made to combat it. We need\r\na system that enjoys United Nations supervision to\r\nensure that it is used properly.\r\nI am making a formal request to the United\r\nNations to take the lead in this matter. I am not\r\nexaggerating when I say that there are few other\r\nactions we could take that would make such a great\r\ncontribution to reducing poverty. I would also like to\r\nappeal to the developed countries to use oil like a\r\nscarce resource. Let them continue to improve fuel\r\nefficiency and to establish taxes that reflect the true\r\ncost of oil. Let them coordinate measures to make sure\r\nthat demand does not grow unduly and make prices\r\ngrow too fast. They should make prudent use of a non-\r\nrenewable resource to which we should all have access.\r\nI would like to conclude by appealing to all to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations system. That is the only\r\nway we can achieve peace in the world. Let us\r\nsubordinate our individual agendas in order to find\r\nagreed solutions here in the United Nations. The well-\r\nbeing of the world demands that we act in this manner.\r\nI would also add that we support reforming the\r\nSecurity Council by increasing the number of\r\npermanent and non-permanent members. This will\r\nmake it possible for countries such as Japan to\r\nparticipate, as well as a representative for Latin\r\nAmerica. This will lend greater legitimacy to the\r\nCouncils decisions. We also support an all-embracing\r\napproach for the United Nations, which, in our opinion,\r\nmeans that we should find a way of enabling the\r\nChinese people in Taiwan to participate in the United\r\nNations processes.\r\nAs I said at the beginning, we are living in difficult\r\ntimes, but this is also a time of great opportunity. We\r\nhold out our hand in friendship to everyone. All that\r\nwe ask in exchange is to be treated fairly.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nRepublic of Honduras for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ricardo Maduro Joest, President of the\r\nRepublic of Honduras, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jorge Batlle Ibáñez, President of the\r\nEastern Republic of Uruguay\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the\r\nEastern Republic of Uruguay.\r\nMr. Jorge Batlle Ibáñez, President of the Eastern\r\nRepublic of Uruguay, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Jorge Batlle\r\nIbáñez, the President of the Eastern Republic of\r\nUruguay, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Batlle Ibáñez (spoke in Spanish):\r\nToday no one denies that globalization is here and that\r\nit is here to stay. Not only has it changed the world of\r\ncommunications so that now everything happens at the\r\nsame time throughout the world, but more importantly,\r\nit has made historical borders irrelevant. The young\r\ngeneration has more contact with other young people\r\nliving thousands of miles away than they have with\r\ntheir own neighbours or family.\r\nIt is absolutely true that a global culture is\r\nemerging in this world. While this is happening,\r\ncountries are still living on their nationalisms, their\r\nsecular habits, their own interests and their parochial\r\nprojects that are often alien to the new realities. The\r\nquestion that we leaders ask ourselves  especially\r\n9\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nthose of us who represent small nations  is whether\r\nthis inexorable change can be handled by the\r\norganizations that we have created, or whether those\r\norganizations still have a long way to go in terms of\r\nadapting to the new reality. When we look at the\r\nimpressive success achieved by the United Nations\r\nsince San Francisco in 1944, two things seem clear.\r\nFirst, the institutions that we have created\r\nrepresent the greatest and most successful effort ever\r\nmade by mankind to organize peaceful coexistence and\r\nto endow the planet with the best possible instruments\r\nfor dealing with the important aspects of human lives\r\nwithin human society.\r\nSecondly, it is equally clear that the world has\r\nchanged so much that the current reality now far\r\nexceeds the capacity of the institutions that were\r\ncreated to address and resolve past issues, issues that\r\ntoday have taken on totally different characteristics.\r\nSuffice it to recall that the founding Members of the\r\nUnited Nations numbered 51 and that today there are\r\n191 Member States. More important, the worlds\r\npopulation at that time was only half what it is today.\r\nAnd the total is inexorably rising towards 9 billion.\r\nFurthermore, over the past 40 years, scientific\r\nadvances and the ensuing technological applications have\r\nincreased the resources of a very small group of nations,\r\nleaving far behind many other countries, some of which\r\nonly recently gained their independence and most of\r\nwhich are rich in natural resources but lack the basic\r\nstructures needed to achieve sustainable growth \r\ncountries, moreover, where, no doubt as a consequence\r\nof this, the population is increasing at very high rates\r\nand where the resulting emigration to other continents\r\nwill soon create serious problems of coexistence.\r\nUruguay has been a Member of the United\r\nNations since its foundation and believes in the\r\nOrganization and in the varied multilateral agencies\r\nthat support its efforts; we understand the need to\r\nconsider Charter revision so that nations that did not\r\nthen carry the weight they carry today can assume\r\ngreater obligations in the inescapable tasks that the\r\nsituation of mankind now imposes on us. It is time for\r\nthem to share the responsibility with the five nations\r\nthat assumed it nearly 60 years ago.\r\nUruguay has also been participating in\r\npeacekeeping operations for many years. Uruguay is one\r\nof the largest troop contributors, and is the very largest\r\nif the ratio of its small population  3.4 million  to\r\npeacekeepers is taken into consideration. We have\r\nparticipated in operations in Asia and in Africa, and we\r\nare currently deployed in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, Haiti, Eritrea and elsewhere.\r\nUruguay acknowledges and welcomes the wise\r\nEuropean Union effort to bring equality at the highest\r\nlevel to European nations with marked differences in\r\nincome compared with the richest countries. The\r\nexamples of Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece,\r\nwhich will surely be emulated for new European Union\r\nmembers, indicate what we in the United Nations must\r\ndo for the Congo and Haiti.\r\nThere is no point in achieving peace if the United\r\nNations lacks funds that can immediately be spent for the\r\npractical benefit of peoples in extreme economic\r\ndifficulties. We must create global and largely\r\nautonomous financial instruments to achieve those goals.\r\nThat is the only way for the United Nations to succeed.\r\nA tiny nation like Haiti  of 27,000 square\r\nkilometres and 9 million inhabitants, where the average\r\nnumber of children per mother is 4.7 and which lacks\r\nthe institutional and material infrastructure it needs \r\ncannot and will not resolve its problems merely\r\nbecause a contingent of military forces from countries\r\nof the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) is\r\nkeeping the peace.\r\nTravelling in the Congo with the troops we\r\nrecently dispatched, we see exactly the same thing\r\nhappening: a nation of 2.2 million square kilometres\r\nand a population of 50 million does not have a road\r\ngoing from one end of the country to the other. Without\r\nautonomous, ready and independent means of coping\r\nwith and transforming that state of affairs, the United\r\nNations will not have solved anything at all even five,\r\n10, 15 or 20 years from now. Yet only the United\r\nNations can handle such tasks.\r\nJust more than three years since the fateful day of\r\n11 September 2001 and just over six months since the\r\ntragedy in Madrid, new and terrible forms of violence\r\ncontinue assailing other parts of the world, claiming\r\nhundreds of innocent victims  as we have recently seen\r\nin Russia and as we see in the Middle East. This reveals\r\nthe destructive power that poses a permanent threat to the\r\nworld as a whole, a source of inescapable sadness and\r\na cause for despair about the human condition itself.\r\nTerrorism  and a genuine commitment to\r\ncombat and defeat it  must therefore be the first item\r\n10\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\non our international agenda. Each State, each nation, each\r\ncommunity and each human being must contribute to\r\nthis endeavour; that is how we can help the United\r\nNations to fulfil its role as universal guarantor.\r\nCombating this and other evils  hunger, poverty,\r\nunderdevelopment, marginalization, exclusion  requires\r\na United Nations that is more united, nimbler and more\r\neffective. That is why the Organization must be more\r\nrepresentative, more balanced and more reliable: so\r\nthat it can continue to be a reference point for the weak\r\nand a restraining influence on the strong.\r\nHere, our country has recently adopted legislation\r\nstrengthening the system of prevention and control of\r\nmoney laundering and the financing of terrorism. We\r\nare in compliance with nearly all current treaties in this\r\narea, and our legislation improves our mechanisms for\r\ninternational cooperation against money laundering\r\nand the financing of terrorism.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit and in the Doha\r\nDeclaration and Monterrey Consensus we agreed on\r\nprinciples, goals and priorities, and we made\r\ncommitments which we reaffirmed a few days ago at\r\nthe summit of world leaders for the Action Against\r\nHunger and Poverty. If we are to attain those goals, we\r\nneed more just and equitable rules of international\r\ntrade. That is how to ensure that this becomes a key\r\nstage in the march towards the social and political\r\nstability that is today in serious jeopardy.\r\nThis is particularly important since it is well\r\nknown that States that vociferously preach free trade\r\nand demand open markets  which in our case are\r\nalready entirely open  themselves impose and institute\r\nobstacles to trade, subsidize their production in distorting\r\nways and compete with countries such as mine and many\r\nothers, which have nothing to offer the world except the\r\nlabour of their people in the commodity and industrial\r\nsectors, which further enriches the rich countries.\r\nUruguay attaches fundamental importance to\r\nfinancial and trade issues. In all international forums,\r\nUruguay calls for freer, more open markets. We favour\r\na single market from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego; we\r\nsupport the Doha Agreement; we support the opening\r\nof markets. We believe in freedom, but we believe also\r\nthat freedom is indivisible: there can be no political\r\nfreedom without economic freedom, and we think there\r\ncan be no economic freedom that does not go hand in\r\nhand with political freedom.\r\nWe believe, therefore, that peoples can be strong\r\nonly if they can create their future in freedom. We\r\ncannot build and stabilize democracies if women and\r\nmen cannot find an honest job to which to devote their\r\nenergies. That goal cannot be achieved with economic\r\nassistance alone or with loans that, in the poorest\r\ncountries, are paid back only with great difficulty. It\r\ncan be brought about only with free trade  something\r\nthat the world experienced in the nineteenth century.\r\nIn conclusion, Uruguay will continue to be\r\ncommitted to the international system and to the\r\nprogressive development of international law, the most\r\nrecent expression of which was the establishment of\r\nthe International Criminal Court, whose Statute we\r\nhave ratified. We reaffirm our conviction that\r\nmultilateralism is the main principle on which the\r\nconduct of international affairs must be based. We\r\nexpress the hope that our region and the world as a\r\nwhole will pool their efforts and work together in a\r\nrealistic and committed manner. We continue to believe\r\nin the United Nations as the collective instrument best\r\nsuited to our search for peace.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Eastern Republic of Uruguay for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Jorge Batlle Ibáñez, President of the Eastern\r\nRepublic of Uruguay, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Right Honourable Pakalitha\r\nBethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Defence and Public Service of the Kingdom\r\nof Lesotho\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Defence and Public Service of the\r\nKingdom of Lesotho.\r\nThe Right Honourable Pakalitha Bethuel\r\nMosisili, Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nDefence and Public Service of the Kingdom of\r\nLesotho, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\n11\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I have great\r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency The Right\r\nHonourable Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Defence and Public Service of the\r\nKingdom of Lesotho, and inviting him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Mosisili (Lesotho): I would like, on behalf of\r\nmy delegation, to join previous speakers in\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at this session. At\r\nthe same time, I would like to extend our compliments\r\nto your predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, as well as to the\r\nSecretary-General, for a job well done.\r\nIf there has been one consistent and predictable\r\narea of convergence in our debates during General\r\nAssembly sessions of the past, as well as during the\r\ncurrent session, it is the compelling need for a peaceful\r\nand stable world  a world where humankind lives in\r\nharmony, mutual tolerance and respect for the\r\ncollective benefit. For if we have peace and stability at\r\nthe national, regional and international levels,\r\nhumankind will be able to concentrate on the real\r\nissues of the development of this, our only world.\r\nNever before has our world been so insecure or\r\nfaced such enormous challenges. Sadly, this insecurity\r\nresults from mans inhumanity and his insensitivity to\r\nhuman life. Yet it is also through mans efforts that the\r\neffects of such challenges can and must be mitigated\r\nor  better still  defeated.\r\nIt is common knowledge that the root cause of the\r\nworlds insecurity today is international terrorism and\r\narmed conflict. Terrorist actions continue to haunt and\r\nto shock us. The recent murder of innocent, young,\r\ndefenceless school children in Beslan, Russia; the\r\nbombings in Indonesia; and daily killings in Iraq,\r\nPalestine and Israel, are simply too ghastly to\r\ncountenance. Equally, the recent massacres of men,\r\nwomen and children in refugee camps in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and the\r\nSudan are not only dastardly in the extreme, but stand\r\nin stark contrast to everything that modern civilization,\r\nhumanity and morality espouse.\r\nOur world will continue to be insecure for as long\r\nas terrorists continue to be harboured and financed by\r\nsome States Members of the United Nations. We must\r\nrecognize that none of us is immune from terrorism.\r\nBut a more honest and practical solution would be for\r\nall States Members of the United Nations to commit\r\nthemselves not to harbour or finance terrorists and their\r\norganizations. In that way, terrorists would have no\r\nsafe haven, thus rendering it possible to chase them\r\nfrom pillar to post until terrorist organizations are\r\neliminated from our world.\r\nWe submit that yet another, equally pragmatic,\r\nsolution may be found in the answer to the question:\r\nwhat is it that drives an inherently good human being\r\nto commit such inhuman and senseless acts of State\r\nterrorism, organizational terrorism or individual\r\nterrorism? In short, we must confront the causes of\r\nterrorism, honestly and without malice to anybody.\r\nLesotho is deeply concerned by the fact that\r\narmed conflicts continue to cause suffering and hinder\r\neconomic growth in Africa and elsewhere. However,\r\nwe commend the United Nations for all its efforts\r\naimed at the elimination of human suffering in armed\r\nconflict situations. When, in July 2003, the Assembly\r\nadopted its historic resolution 57/337, on the\r\nprevention of armed conflict, it recognized that\r\nmultilateral cooperation, under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations, could be an effective means to prevent\r\narmed conflict and to address its root causes.\r\nFurthermore, it acknowledged the responsibility of the\r\nUnited Nations to stand up to the challenge of\r\npreventing, rather than just responding to, conflict.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to express\r\nmy delegations appreciation to the Secretary-General,\r\nfor the comprehensive report to be presented at this\r\nsession on the implementation of that important\r\nresolution.\r\nFor years now, the situation in Somalia has posed a\r\nthreat to international peace and security. The swearing-\r\nin of Somalias transitional parliament on 22 August\r\n2004, in Nairobi, Kenya, paves the way for genuine\r\nrecovery for Somalia. In that regard, my delegation\r\ncompliments the Government of Kenya, the Inter-\r\nGovernmental Authority on Development, the African\r\nUnion and all other stakeholders for their efforts to\r\nbring about normalcy in Somalia. We must not allow\r\nthe momentum to decrease, or the process to be\r\nderailed by those who seek to fuel hatred, division and\r\nthe killing of the people of Somalia, including as a\r\nresult of the smuggling of arms, which takes place\r\ndespite the arms embargo.\r\nThe humanitarian and security crises engulfing\r\nthe Darfur region in the Sudan are a cause for serious\r\nconcern to all of us. A lot has been said about that\r\n12\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\ngrave situation, but not much has been done to contain\r\nthe humanitarian and political crises.\r\nHowever, my delegation is hopeful that words\r\nwill finally translate into action. We had hoped that,\r\nwith the help of the African Union mediators, the\r\nrepresentatives of the Government of the Sudan and the\r\ntwo rebel groups  the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA)\r\nand the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM)  could\r\nbe persuaded to sign and respect the protocol on\r\nsecurity. We reiterate our call to all concerned parties\r\nto enter into negotiations. We wish to remind the\r\nGovernment of the Sudan that it is its primary\r\nresponsibility, first and foremost, to protect the civilian\r\nlife of its nationals.\r\nThe Great Lakes region remains politically\r\nvolatile. This situation has been exacerbated by the\r\nrecent massacre of refugees from the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo at the Gatumba refugee camp in\r\nwestern Burundi. We hope that the fact that the Forces\r\nfor National Liberation (FNL) have claimed\r\nresponsibility for the killings would make\r\ninvestigations easier.\r\nThe peace process in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo remains elusive, at a time when we had\r\nthought that the gains that had been made from the\r\nCongolese dialogue, in South Africa, could be\r\nconsolidated. We reiterate the call by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for renewed commitment by\r\nthe Transitional Government in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, the Security Council and the\r\ninternational community to work in full partnership to\r\nsee the transitional process through to elections\r\nscheduled for 2005.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that, at the regional level,\r\nthe Southern African Development Community\r\n(SADC) heads of State or Government, at their recent\r\nsummit in Mauritius, mandated the SADC Organ on\r\nPolitics, Defence and Security Cooperation actively to\r\nremain seized of the situation in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo.\r\nMy delegation has never condoned the killings of\r\nIsraelis by the Palestinians or of Palestinians by the\r\nIsraelis. We have always considered the root causes of\r\nthe problem in the Middle East, which is the illegal\r\noccupation of Palestinian lands by Israel. That problem\r\nhas been exacerbated by the construction by Israel of a\r\nseparation wall in the occupied Palestinian territory.\r\nThe International Court of Justice, the principal\r\njudicial organ of the United Nations, on 9 July 2004\r\nrendered its advisory opinion that such construction\r\nwas contrary to international law. We therefore appeal\r\nto Israel to implement the important resolution adopted\r\nby the General Assembly in view of the Courts\r\nadvisory opinion. Moreover, it is our submission that,\r\nunless and until the issue of the inalienable rights of\r\nthe Palestinian people is addressed vigorously, urgently\r\nand truthfully, peace and security will remain elusive\r\nin the Middle East.\r\nWe should perhaps recall that, four years ago, we\r\ngathered in this very Hall with hope for, and\r\nanticipation of, a better life for all humankind in the\r\ntwenty-first century, as we adopted the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nWe set time-bound and measurable goals for\r\ncombating, inter alia, poverty, hunger, disease, the\r\nspread of HIV and AIDS, illiteracy, environmental\r\ndegradation and discrimination against women.\r\nNeedless to say, we are today, as we were then,\r\ncommitted to the achievement of those goals.\r\nHowever, we did not anticipate that, as we\r\napproach the comprehensive review in 2005, the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic would have become the greatest\r\nthreat to life itself, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.\r\nUndoubtedly, the HIV/AIDS pandemic threatens to\r\nrender futile and irrelevant all our efforts at the\r\nbetterment of humankind, including the attainment of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\r\nAs early as the year 2000, Lesotho had declared\r\nHIV/AIDS a national disaster, and various measures\r\nwere being taken at the national level to control and\r\nmanage the pandemic. We have not been alone in that\r\nfight, fortunately. It is in that spirit that we wish to\r\nrecognize and appreciate the dedication of Mr. Stephen\r\nLewis, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for\r\nHIV/AIDS in Africa, and of Mr. James Morris, Special\r\nEnvoy for Humanitarian Needs in Southern Africa.\r\nThrough his advocacy, Mr. Lewis has helped\r\nLesotho start a robust programme of antiretroviral\r\ntreatment, while Mr. Morriss initiatives have ensured\r\nfood supply for vulnerable and orphaned children.\r\nInterventions of this nature give credence to the lofty\r\ndeclarations adopted at various international summits\r\non the HIV/AIDS pandemic, as they complement and\r\nstrengthen our own initiatives and limited resources.\r\nMy delegation reiterates the call for increased\r\nsupport for the New Partnership for Africas\r\n13\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), the framework for achieving\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals in Africa. It is yet\r\nanother mechanism that will enable African countries\r\nto fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic, to eradicate poverty\r\nand to reduce the high unemployment rate.\r\nIn the same context, the Millennium Challenge\r\nAccount is indeed a worthy and commendable\r\ninitiative by the Government of the United States of\r\nAmerica to launch the least developed countries on the\r\nroad to sound and sustainable development.\r\nThe prevailing situations in Western Sahara and\r\nin Cuba continue to be of major concern. My de1egation\r\nwill  because it must  repeat the statement we have\r\nmade on many previous occasions: that the people of\r\nWestern Sahara have suffered long enough. We have\r\ntherefore noted with appreciation the latest\r\nreaffirmation by the Security Council of its support for\r\nthe 1991 settlement plan, allowing the nations of\r\nWestern Sahara to determine the future of the disputed\r\nterritory in a referendum. We hope that the referendum\r\nwill be held soon, and urge that this be the case.\r\nBy the same token, the unilateral economic\r\nembargo against Cuba is causing untold misery to the\r\npeople of that country. My delegation believes that,\r\nwhen two countries are at war with each other, or when\r\na country has been condemned by the international\r\ncommunity for gross misconduct, an economic\r\nembargo could be justifiable. However, we are not\r\naware that any war has been declared against Cuba, or\r\nthat the Government of Cuba has compromised or\r\nbroken international law. We therefore remain in the\r\ndark as to what might justify the victimization of\r\nmillions of Cubans by the unilateral economic\r\nblockade, for we contend that it is the sovereign,\r\ndemocratic and, indeed, sacred right of the people of\r\nCuba to determine the system of Government most\r\nappropriate for their country. Accordingly, we urge that\r\nnormalcy be restored to Cuba through the removal of\r\nthe economic blockade.\r\nThe coming into operation of the International\r\nCriminal Court signifies, in our view, an end to\r\nimpunity. We are elated that there now exists an\r\ninternational body that can take over when national\r\ncourts are unable or unwilling to try perpetrators of the\r\nmost egregious violations of human rights. We would\r\nindeed live in a safer world if State parties to the Rome\r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court adhered to\r\nit, and if the Court attained universal jurisdiction. My\r\ndelegation encourages States that have not yet ratified\r\nthe Statute to do so as a matter of urgency  indeed,\r\nas a matter of common sense.\r\nWe are pleased to note that the ICC has\r\ncommenced investigations in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo and Uganda. We congratulate both these\r\nsister countries for their cooperation with the ICC.\r\nIn order for the United Nations family to address\r\ntodays challenges effectively, the Organization must\r\nbe reformed, with the Security Council being the\r\ncentral focus of that effort. The Security Council must\r\nreflect the reality of the international community in the\r\ntwenty-first century. That must be done against the\r\nbackground of multilateralism, upon which international\r\npeace and security is premised. In that regard, allow me\r\nto congratulate His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte,\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nsession, for the hard work and commitment he\r\ndisplayed as the Chair of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Reform of the Security Council.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate that it is only\r\nthrough solidarity, unity of purpose and honesty among\r\nus Member States that the United Nations will defeat in\r\nour time the greatest challenges ever to face\r\nhumankind. Otherwise, as Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan stressed in his opening statement, history will\r\nindeed judge us harshly.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Defence and Public Service\r\nof the Kingdom of Lesotho for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nThe Right Honourable Pakalitha Bethuel\r\nMosisili, Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nDefence and Public Service of the Kingdom of\r\nLesotho, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by the Honourable Lawrence Gonzi,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Malta\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Malta.\r\nThe Honourable Lawrence Gonzi, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Malta, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I have great\r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Lawrence\r\n14\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nGonzi, Prime Minister of the Republic of Malta, and\r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Gonzi (Malta): I would like first to\r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\r\nsession. You have an important and challenging task\r\nahead. In executing your duties you can be assured of\r\nmy full support and that of the Maltese delegation.\r\nI take this opportunity to express our appreciation\r\nto the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\neighth session, His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte. Over\r\nthe last twelve months he has successfully guided the\r\nAssemblys work with exemplary dedication and\r\ninitiative.\r\nI would also like, at the outset of my intervention\r\nthis afternoon, to take the opportunity to express the\r\nsolidarity of the Maltese people with those countries\r\nand people who have suffered loss of life and damage\r\nto property as a result of the recent spate of hurricanes\r\nand tropical storms, particularly the people of Haiti.\r\nWe, the Maltese people, pledge our support in this hour\r\nof need.\r\nIt is a source of particular satisfaction for me to\r\naddress the Assembly for the first time as Prime\r\nMinister of Malta, and also for Malta in its new role as\r\na member of the European Union. The President of the\r\nUnions Council of Ministers, the Foreign Minister of\r\nthe Netherlands, has already laid before the Assembly\r\nthe objectives and priorities of the 25 members of the\r\nUnion for the coming months.\r\nThe upholding and development of international\r\nlaw and effective multilateralism are central to the\r\nEuropean Unions external actions. The role of the\r\nUnited Nations is vital in this regard. Malta has\r\nconsistently supported the view that the international\r\ncommunity needs this universal forum within which it\r\ncan collectively deliberate and act upon the many\r\nproblems that confront it. Our membership in the\r\nEuropean Union gives renewed scope and added\r\ndimension to our commitment to the United Nations\r\nand its role in international affairs.\r\nRecent events have raised urgent questions about\r\nthe extent to which the United Nations is fulfilling the\r\nrole envisaged for it under the Charter. Inevitably this\r\nleads to some serious concerns about the effectiveness\r\nof our Organization. Nevertheless, the questions which\r\nhave been raised do not diminish the case not only for\r\nits continued existence but also for its strengthening as\r\na world body. As we survey the latest developments in\r\ncrises spots around the globe, the realization intensifies\r\nthat solutions to the major problems of our age are\r\nbeyond the grasp and control of any single nation or\r\nparticular group of nations, however powerful and\r\ndetermined.\r\nThe international system is itself frequently\r\noverwhelmed by the immensity and complexity of many\r\nof the problems it faces. The United Nations is indeed at\r\nthe forefront of action in the most critical areas \r\nfurthering development, relieving suffering, safeguarding\r\nhuman rights, combating terrorism, fighting\r\nenvironmental degradation, fostering sustainability,\r\nresolving conflicts, promoting peace and disarmament\r\nand upholding the rule of international law.\r\nEach year we derive a measure of comfort from\r\nthe knowledge that some progress is being recorded in\r\ncertain areas. In this years report the Secretary-\r\nGeneral mentions last Julys Framework Agreement\r\nthat put the Doha Round of trade negotiations back on\r\ntrack; he refers to the contribution that United Nations\r\npeace missions are making towards the gradual\r\nimprovement of the situation in Liberia, Sierra Leone,\r\nSomalia and the Central African Republic, as well as in\r\nAfghanistan, Papua New Guinea, Guatemala and Haiti.\r\nHe records the launching of an important new\r\nprogramme in the fight against HIV/AIDS; he notes\r\nthat for the second consecutive year the global refugee\r\nfigure has decreased by nearly 1 million, and he\r\nbelieves that meeting the Millennium Development\r\nGoals by the target date of 2015 remains achievable.\r\nAt the same time, however, the Secretary-General\r\nhighlights a bewildering array of areas on which no\r\nvisible progress can be registered, in spite of the fact\r\nthat, as the Secretary-General reminds us, there are at\r\npresent more than 56,000 uniformed personnel and\r\nsome 11,000 civilian staff from 97 countries serving in\r\n16 United Nations missions worldwide, and in spite of\r\nthe fact that the whole United Nations system,\r\nincluding the specialized agencies, is wholeheartedly\r\nengaged in the work of promoting economic and social\r\nprogress and development.\r\nThe humanitarian crisis in Darfur, in western\r\nSudan, is one stark manifestation of an apparently\r\nunbridgeable gap between intention and execution. The\r\ndaily visions on television screens throughout the\r\nworld of thousands of refugees suffering and dying\r\n15\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\noverwhelm the impact that a steady but slow\r\ndiplomacy may be making in its own right. In Iraq, in\r\nPalestine and in Israel, the fact that in those difficult\r\nrealities hardly a single day goes by without news of\r\npeople dying violently in armed actions is in sharp\r\ncontrast with the limited reports on continuing efforts\r\nto find peaceful and viable solutions. Silently, across\r\nour globe of plenty with its advanced technology, the\r\nfact remains that in spite of our collective efforts\r\nmillions of individuals, many of them children,\r\ncontinue to suffer and die in conditions of absolute\r\npoverty, malnutrition and disease.\r\nOver the next 12 months two events will provide\r\na special opportunity for the United Nations\r\nmembership to focus on the key issues that challenge\r\nthe vitality and effectiveness of our Organization. The\r\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change,\r\nappointed by the Secretary-General last year, will soon\r\nproduce its report. The Secretary-General expects that\r\nthe Panel, after examining the threats we face and\r\nevaluating our existing policies, processes and\r\ninstitutions, will make bold and practicable\r\nrecommendations. It will be up to us as Member States,\r\ncollectively and individually, to be equally bold and\r\npractical in responding to those recommendations.\r\nThe Panels report will be followed in 2005 by a\r\nhigh-level meeting on the five-year review of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, as well as the commemoration\r\nof the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations. Five\r\nyears after what was expected to be the dawn of a new\r\nera, the time will be ripe for some dramatic results to\r\nemerge, not least at the institutional level.\r\nHigh on the agenda in this context is the reform\r\nof the Security Council. As currently constituted, the\r\nCouncil suffers from three noticeable weaknesses.\r\nFirst, it has limited means of adequately addressing the\r\ndevelopment issues involved in security matters.\r\nSecondly, the regional distribution of authority in the\r\nCouncil is severely lopsided. And, thirdly, the great\r\nmajority of Member States, especially the smaller ones,\r\nare underrepresented in the deliberations of the\r\nCouncil. Urgent remedies need to be found for all these\r\nweaknesses for the Council to be able to continue to\r\nplay a relevant role in the twenty-first century.\r\nIn its turn, the General Assembly needs to greatly\r\nintensify current efforts to enhance the strengths\r\ninherent in its universality, while discarding the\r\ndebilitating and time-consuming procedures and\r\nworking methods that such universality has bred. The\r\nmajor organs and specialized agencies of the United\r\nNations system also need to devise improved ways of\r\nharmonizing, through the Economic and Social Council,\r\ntheir many impressive, but often disparate, efforts to\r\nfoster sustainable social and economic development.\r\nOne of the underlying strengths of the United\r\nNations system lies in the manner in which it permits\r\naction at the regional level to insert itself into global\r\nefforts towards peace, security and cooperation. In recent\r\nyears, the progressive strengthening of the African Union\r\nhas added a welcome partner to the regional framework,\r\nin what is, unfortunately, the region of greatest need.\r\nThe recently enlarged European Union has also\r\nbeen progressively enhancing its cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations at both the regional and higher levels.\r\nThe Secretary-General refers in his report on the work\r\nof the Organization (A/59/1) to the significant progress in\r\nEU/United Nations cooperation on conflict prevention,\r\npeace-building and post-conflict reconstruction, as well\r\nas in crisis management activities.\r\nOne area in which the EU and the United Nations\r\nare active and important partners concerns the question\r\nof Palestine. As members of the Quartet, the EU and\r\nthe United Nations play a significant role by injecting a\r\nmuch-needed balance and objectivity into an issue\r\ntormented by violence and passion. Both the EU and\r\nthe United Nations are by right major stakeholders in\r\nthe issue. History and geographical proximity underpin\r\nthe special interest of all EU member States in the\r\nprosperity and well-being of both Israelis and\r\nPalestinians. The creation and peaceful coexistence of\r\ntwo neighbouring States, Israel and Palestine, was one\r\nof the United Nations very first, but unfortunately still\r\nunfulfilled, recommendations.\r\nAfter decades of bitterness and wrong turns, the\r\nissue of Palestine remains jeopardized by the forces of\r\nextremism and intransigence. But extremism and\r\nintransigence  as manifested by both the perpetrators\r\nof Palestinian suicide bombings and Israeli advocates\r\nof a continuing and forceful military occupation of\r\nPalestinian territories  do have a counterbalance on\r\nboth sides, as manifested by the Geneva Initiative of\r\nlate last year, among many other examples. The EU\r\nand the United Nations need to continuously exert their\r\ninfluence and pressure on both sides to persuade them\r\nto give greater heed and credibility to the voices of\r\nreason which lie in their midst.\r\n16\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nThe path to legality and reconciliation has been\r\ndefined in the road map, in the many resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly and, most\r\nrecently, in the advisory opinion of the International\r\nCourt of Justice. Even in the face of constant setbacks\r\non the ground, the EU and United Nations Quartet\r\npartners need to remain steadfast in their insistence\r\nthat the road to peace can only be set within those\r\nparameters.\r\nMalta looks at the problem both from its tragic\r\nhumanitarian dimension as well as from its far-\r\nreaching implications for peace and security. One\r\nimportant concern for us in that regard is the impact\r\nthat the problem has on issues of peace and security in\r\nthe Middle East in general and the Mediterranean area\r\nin particular.\r\nOne of the primary objectives of the European\r\nUnion is to promote the development, through\r\npartnership, of a common zone of peace, prosperity and\r\nprogress in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. In\r\nrecent months the Union has elaborated a policy\r\nagenda for that strategic partnership linking together a\r\nnumber of instruments and mechanisms that have been\r\nput in place over the years. The Euro-Mediterranean\r\nPartnership  the Barcelona or Euromed process  and\r\nthe European Neighbourhood Policy are the frameworks\r\nof that policy. A key element in the EU approach is the\r\nparallel importance assigned to the processes of\r\nsecurity-building and to cooperation in the social,\r\neconomic, cultural and humanitarian fields. In that way\r\nit ensures that the evolving relationships in the Euro-\r\nMediterranean area are tailored to the specific concerns\r\nand needs of the individual countries and regions.\r\nFor the Balkan region, the framework provided\r\nby the European Neighbourhood Policy  and the\r\nprospect of consolidating relationships with the\r\nEuropean Union which it implies  constitutes an\r\nimportant contributory factor towards growth and\r\nstability. With the exception of the situation in Kosovo,\r\nwhich remains disturbing, and some other examples,\r\nprogress in the Balkan region is encouraging.\r\nThe almost decade-long EuroMed process has\r\ngradually but steadily put into place a useful structure\r\nfor the strengthening and consolidation of relationships\r\namong the countries of the Mediterranean. It not only\r\ncontributes to the economic and social development of\r\nindividual countries, but also provides a stable\r\nbackground in which some of the wider problems may be\r\ntackled, taking into account the strong linkage that\r\nexists between security and cooperation in Europe and\r\nin the Mediterranean. It needs strengthening and\r\nbroadening, and in that context, the participation of\r\nLibya in the Barcelona Euromed process would be\r\nparticularly welcome.\r\nOne such issue concerns the question of\r\nmigration from the southern to the northern shores of\r\nthe Mediterranean. As in other parts of the world, that\r\nissue needs to be tackled from the economic, social and\r\npolitical, as well as the humanitarian, perspective.\r\nBecause of its geographical location and small size,\r\nMalta has a special sensitivity to the many problems\r\nand complexities of the issue. We are hopeful that the\r\nspirit of cooperation and understanding provided by the\r\nEuroMed process can help countries in our region to\r\nsuccessfully tackle the challenges involved.\r\nOver the last few months, an important\r\ndevelopment took place in our region in the context of\r\ndisarmament. Libyas decision to renounce its\r\nprogramme of weapons of mass destruction has been\r\nwelcomed by all. As a longstanding friend and close\r\nneighbour of Libya, Malta has particular reasons to\r\nwelcome this development and the increased\r\nopportunities it now creates for Libya to play a\r\nsignificant role in the process of Euro-Mediterranean\r\nsecurity and cooperation.\r\nIt is reasonable to argue that the framework of\r\nregional stability and cooperation provided by the\r\nEuro-Mediterranean process was one factor that\r\ncontributed to Libyas decision to renounce its\r\nprogramme. Nevertheless, problems relating to the\r\ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction still exist\r\nin other regions of the world. The role that can be\r\nplayed by initiatives encouraging regional stability and\r\neconomic and social development in the resolution of\r\nthese problems should not be underestimated.\r\nWe must also look at the problems raised by the\r\nthreat of new weapons of mass destruction as part of\r\nthe wider issue of disarmament in its many aspects.\r\nThe continuing commitment to the major multilateral\r\ntreaties and increased efforts to intensify measures of\r\nverification and compliance are of paramount importance\r\nin this regard. Equally important is the need to bring the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty into force\r\nwithout further delay.\r\nThe problem of the proliferation of weapons,\r\nespecially weapons of mass destruction, has in our day\r\n17\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nassumed a new and frightening dimension in its\r\npossible linkage with terrorism. In this regard, as the\r\nSecretary-General points out, the effective\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1540\r\n(2004), adopted earlier this year, should complement\r\nongoing efforts to strengthen existing multilateral and\r\nnon-proliferation regimes.\r\nThe fight against terrorism involves all of us and\r\nneeds to be pursued with firmness and tenacity. At the\r\nsame time, the struggle must take place on our terms\r\nand not those of the terrorists. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral takes every opportunity to remind us, this\r\nstruggle must not take place at the expense of the\r\nfundamental freedoms and basic dignity of individuals,\r\nneither must we allow the legitimate concern to\r\neradicate terrorism in all its aspects to distract the\r\ncommitment of the global community in its endeavour\r\ntowards the economic and social development of the\r\nless advantaged regions of the world.\r\nIn conclusion, our concerns for the safety of our\r\npeople must be counter-balanced by the assurances that\r\nthose responsible for these threats will be dealt with by\r\na coherent and effective system of trans-frontier justice\r\nthat reflects respect for the rule of law. The\r\ninternational communitys endeavours in recent years\r\nhave found fruition in the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, a functioning institution\r\nthat increases its effectiveness the more widely all the\r\nmembers of the family of nations subscribe to it.\r\nIn encouraging reflection on these topical issues,\r\nI feel confident in the credentials offered by my\r\ncountry, whose level of commitment to the United\r\nNations certainly makes up for any physical limitations\r\nwe may have. Malta has been instrumental in\r\ndeveloping the concept of common heritage, in relation\r\nboth to the high seas and to climate change, and we\r\nhave emphasized the importance of intergenerational\r\nsolidarity, as evidenced not only by our initiatives on\r\nageing but also as the host country for the International\r\nInstitute on Ageing.\r\nAs in previous years, the issues before of the\r\nGeneral Assembly are many and complex. The density\r\nand variety of the agenda we have before us are both a\r\nchallenge and an opportunity for our Organization. I\r\ntrust that under your able guidance, Mr. President, we\r\nwill find the energy and wisdom to meet these\r\nchallenges and exploit these opportunities. Humanity is\r\ncounting on all of us.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Malta for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nThe Honourable Lawrence Gonzi, Prime Minister\r\nof the Republic of Malta, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Alhaji Aliu Mahama, Vice-President\r\nof the Republic of Ghana\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic of Ghana.\r\nAlhaji Aliu Mahama, Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I have great\r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Alhaji Aliu\r\nMahama, Vice-President of the Republic of Ghana, and\r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Mahama (Ghana): I have the distinct honour\r\nto congratulate you, Mr. President, a distinguished\r\nAfrican diplomat, on your election to preside over the\r\nfifty-ninth session of this Assembly and to wish you\r\nsuccess in your undertaking. I would also like to\r\ncommend your predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, for the\r\ndedication and commitment that he brought to bear on\r\nhis stewardship of the fifty-eighth session.\r\nThree years ago, a terrible tragedy hit this city.\r\nThe unprecedented terrorist attacks of 11 September\r\nresulted in the death of thousands of innocent people of\r\nmany nationalities, including some from my own\r\ncountry, Ghana. The whole world shared the pain and\r\nsorrow of New York in the aftermath of those\r\natrocities. The whole world also rose in solidarity with\r\nthe people of the United States to ensure that such\r\ntragedies would not happen again.\r\n11 September reminds us of the importance of\r\nseeking a multilateral and peaceful means for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\r\nespecially now, when it has become evident that only\r\ncollective, multilateral efforts will suffice to defeat the\r\nnew scourge of mankind, global terrorism.\r\nThe United Nations has an indispensable role to\r\nplay, being the most universal and representative\r\nintergovernmental organization and the best forum for\r\nthe practice of multilateralism. However, the success of\r\n18\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nmultilateralism and collective security will depend on\r\nhow the reforms of the United Nations system are\r\nimplemented. In this regard, we applaud the initiative\r\nof our illustrious compatriot, Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan, in setting up the United Nations High-Level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change, to make\r\nproposals on how the United Nations can best be\r\nreformed to meet the new challenges of our world.\r\nWe, in Africa, agree that the objectives of the\r\nUnited Nations reforms, including the revitalization of\r\nthe General Assembly and the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, are aimed at enhancing the role of the\r\nOrganization and its capacity to overcome current\r\nthreats and emerging challenges. The reforms should\r\nbe in conformity with the purposes and principles of\r\nthe United Nations Charter and the process must be\r\nbased on full consultations in a democratic and\r\ntransparent manner. To this end, we look forward to a\r\nrevitalized General Assembly that would assume its\r\nrightful position as the most authoritative and\r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations.\r\nWith regard to the Security Council, the African\r\nposition emphasizes the need to democratize and ensure\r\nequitable geographical representation, with Africa\r\nallotted no less than two permanent seats and five non-\r\npermanent seats in the expanded Security Council.\r\nI wish to address the crucial issue of poverty\r\neradication and the promotion of sustainable\r\ndevelopment in developing countries in which\r\nwidespread poverty is endemic, particularly in Africa.\r\nAs we strive to overcome our current economic woes,\r\nwe need the worlds solidarity, resources, technical\r\nknow-how and support. The historic Millennium\r\nSummit of the United Nations, which brought together\r\n189 nations in September 2000 and adopted the\r\nMillennium Declaration, was a clarion call for action to\r\nsolve these problems and set forth the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals with measurable goals and targets\r\nfor combating them. On that occasion, the international\r\ncommunity pledged to spare no effort to free our\r\nfellow men, women and children from the abject and\r\ndehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty.\r\nAfrica has adopted the New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which reaffirms our belief that\r\nAfricans have the primary responsibility to solve the\r\nproblems of poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy\r\nafflicting the majority of our population and to stem\r\nAfricas marginalization from global markets. In tandem,\r\nwe are striving to foster political stability, accountable\r\nand transparent governance under the rule of law,\r\nbecause we believe it is the right thing to do. Ghana\r\nhas volunteered as the first country in Africa for the\r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism, and my Government\r\nis cooperating with the review panel to facilitate the\r\npreparation of the review report, because we in Ghana\r\ncherish very much our democracy and our commitment\r\nof respect for human rights and the rule of law.\r\nOur renewed resolve, within the context of\r\nNEPAD, to accelerate the sustainable development of\r\nthe continent, dovetails fully with the avowed\r\ncommitment of the international community to help\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. It was,\r\ntherefore, a very welcome and positive development\r\nwhen the General Assembly, in its resolution 57/7 of\r\n4 November 2002, urged the international community\r\nto organize support for African countries within the\r\nframework of the principles, objectives and priorities\r\nof NEPAD. However, for this convergence of vision\r\nand effort to yield the desired results, there must be\r\ngenuine partnership between Africa and the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe implementation of NEPAD and the creation\r\nof institutions such as the Pan-African Parliament, the\r\nPeace and Security Council, the Economic, Social and\r\nCultural Council, and various commissions of the\r\nrecently established African Union, reflect Africas\r\ndetermination to be the architect of its own future. The\r\ninitiatives of the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States, the West African regional body\r\ncurrently chaired by the President of Ghana, Mr. John\r\nAgyekum Kufuor, in dealing with the conflicts that\r\nhave recently plagued our region are good examples of\r\nthis development. Accra has been the venue for\r\nsuccessful peace talks concerning Liberia and, most\r\nrecently, on 29 July 2004, Côte dIvoire, which has\r\nrevived hopes for a durable peace in that important\r\nWest African country.\r\nThe important decisions taken at the last summit\r\nof the African Union in Addis Ababa have given cause\r\nfor cautious optimism as the political leadership,\r\nGovernments, the public, civil society and the private\r\nsector now seem to have embarked upon a journey of\r\ncollaborative effort to put an end to conflicts and to\r\nfocus instead on the promotion of peace, security and\r\nsustainable development for the benefit of the peoples\r\nof the continent.\r\n19\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nIt is disheartening, though, to observe that,\r\ndespite the good intentions of the international\r\ncommunity, as exemplified at the various international\r\nforums that have followed the Millennium Summit,\r\nthere has not been any significant achievement due to\r\nthe absence of genuine global partnership for\r\ndevelopment. There continues to be an agonizing paradox\r\nbetween the summit and conference declarations of a\r\nnew global partnership and the persistence of an\r\nasymmetrical global system that works largely against\r\nthe interests of developing countries.\r\nQuite evidently, the laudable long-term initiatives\r\nto halve hunger and poverty by the year 2015 cannot be\r\nachieved without a fundamental restructuring of the\r\nglobal trade system, particularly in agricultural\r\nproducts. Such an initiative should include developed\r\ncountries dismantling subsidies and lowering tariffs,\r\nthereby helping to uphold and safeguard an open,\r\nequitable, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory\r\ntrading and financial system. The concerns of\r\ndeveloping countries have been reiterated in this\r\nAssembly over the years; we therefore urge our\r\ndeveloped partners to act now.\r\nFor many countries in Africa, stable long-term\r\nplanning will be impossible without more systematic\r\nand sustained debt relief. Despite the progress recorded\r\nin the implementation of the enhanced Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative and the\r\nprovision of substantial debt relief by bilateral official\r\ncreditors, achieving long-term debt sustainability and,\r\nat the same time, a reduction in poverty as targeted,\r\nremains a major problem for many African countries.\r\nWe, therefore, welcome the initiative of British Prime\r\nMinister Tony Blair in setting up the African\r\nCommission.\r\nOfficial development assistance (ODA), as we are\r\naware, continues to play an essential role in\r\ncomplementing other sources of financing for\r\ndevelopment and creating a congenial environment for\r\nprivate sector activity. Although ODA flows, which\r\ndecreased in the 1990s, have picked up in recent years,\r\nthe fact that these flows remain, on average, still far\r\nbelow internationally agreed targets is a major cause\r\nfor concern. In this connection, it is pertinent to recall\r\nthat an additional $50 billion a year in development\r\nassistance would be required as a minimum to meet the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. The fundamental\r\nquestion facing the international community is whether\r\nit is committed to the indispensable, challenging, but\r\nultimately rewarding global partnership, which alone\r\ncan make this dream come true.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic is a global emergency\r\nand a key threat to achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, especially for countries in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa. The pandemic has caused untold\r\nsuffering and death in our countries, destroying entire\r\ncommunities, reversing development gains and posing\r\na serious security threat.\r\nUnfortunately, despite the substantial measures\r\ntaken by the Government in combating the scourge,\r\nGhanas efforts have been severely constrained by a\r\nlack of adequate resources required to prevent new\r\ninfections, provide care and support for people,\r\nparticularly women and children living with\r\nHIV/AIDS. We wish to urge the international\r\ncommunity to provide the needed resources for the\r\nfight against this global emergency.\r\nGhana attaches great importance to the\r\nempowerment of women to make them equal partners\r\nin the formulation and implementation of development\r\npolicies. Since the adoption of the Beijing Declaration\r\nand Platform for Action and the outcome of the\r\ntwenty-third special session of the General Assembly,\r\ngender equality has been an essential element of\r\nGhanas efforts to attain sustainable development. The\r\nactive involvement of women in political processes and\r\ndecision-making at all levels and in all sectors is being\r\nvigorously pursued. Impediments such as discrimination\r\nand violence against women are being dealt with\r\nthrough education, advocacy and legislation.\r\nDespite the strong political will within the\r\ninternational community to create a world fit for\r\nchildren, the reality in many parts of the world is a far\r\ncry from the ideals voiced at the twenty-seventh\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly, on children.\r\nWe call for the adoption of effective policies to\r\neradicate poverty, to ensure access to education and to\r\nprovide families with support to guarantee the well-\r\nbeing of children. Decisive international cooperation is\r\nalso required to strengthen legal and other preventive\r\nmechanisms to tackle effectively the increasing\r\npractice of child trafficking for unconscionable\r\nexploitative purposes.\r\nGhana believes that the staff of the Organization,\r\nwho make sacrifices daily to maintain peace and\r\nsecurity in zones of conflict and humanitarian disaster,\r\ndeserve to be provided with a secure and safe\r\n20\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nenvironment in which to operate. In that regard, we\r\nwill continue to condemn all attacks against United\r\nNations personnel and call for firm action by States to\r\nestablish conditions that prevent such attacks, in\r\nfulfilment of the obligations of host countries towards\r\nthe United Nations and its personnel.\r\nGhana, as a major troop-contributing country,\r\nwill continue to support United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations globally, as well as in Africa. That\r\ncommitment, which began with our participation in the\r\nUnited Nations Operation in the Congo in 1960, is born\r\nof the firm moral conviction in our solidarity for\r\nhumanity and the knowledge that a lack of peace and\r\nstability anywhere can be a real threat to peace and\r\nsecurity for all of us.\r\nIn conclusion, I urge Member States to rededicate\r\nthemselves individually and collectively to the ideals\r\nthat underpin the Organization and provide it with the\r\ncommensurate resources as it strives to fulfil the\r\naspirations of the peoples of the world. We cannot,\r\nshould not and must not fail in that undertaking.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Alhaji Aliu Mahama, Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Sandra Pierantozzi, Vice-\r\nPresident and Minister of Health of the\r\nRepublic of Palau\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by the Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic of Palau.\r\nMrs. Sandra Pierantozzi, Vice-President and\r\nMinister of Health of the Republic of Palau, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I have great\r\npleasure in welcoming Her Excellency Mrs. Sandra\r\nPierantozzi, Vice-President of the Republic of Palau,\r\nand inviting her to address the General Assembly.\r\nMrs. Pierantozzi (Palau): This is a momentous\r\nyear for our country as we celebrate, on 1 October, the\r\ntenth anniversary of our independence and our\r\nmembership in this institution. Palau was the last\r\ncountry to emerge from the Trusteeship System, having\r\nbeen administered by the United States under the\r\nsupervision of the United Nations longer than any\r\ncountry in the world. It was the United Nations that\r\nprovided Palau with a willing forum in which to\r\nexpress and ultimately achieve our right to sovereignty,\r\nand for that we are ever thankful. I am also happy to\r\nobserve, on this tenth anniversary, that this year we\r\nestablished, for the first time, a permanent mission in\r\nNew York so that we can enhance our ability to meet\r\nour international responsibilities.\r\nIt was the United States, through its\r\nadministration and willing cooperation during our\r\npeaceful emergence into independence, that assured us\r\nthe liberty and the values that guide us today. For that\r\nextraordinary legacy, we today express our deep\r\ngratitude to the United States of America.\r\nThis is a good year for Palau to deepen its\r\ninvolvement, since it coincides with the worlds\r\npreparation for the Mauritius conference and the\r\nincreased emphasis at the United Nations on the unique\r\nchallenges facing small island developing States.\r\nWhile images of swaying palm trees and white sand\r\nbeaches prevail in the worlds imagination, they are\r\nonly part of the story. In truth and in fact, the\r\nremoteness and the isolation of Palau make it a very\r\ndifficult place to develop a self-reliant economy,\r\nprovide medical care and education to its people and\r\ndeter aggression and terrorism. Fuel and transportation\r\nprices are among the highest in the world. After four\r\nsuccessive colonial administrations, our infrastructure\r\nis quite incomplete, and our most promising hope for\r\nthe development of a sustainable economy, our pristine\r\nenvironment, is threatened by factors beyond our\r\ncontrol, such as the failure of all industrialized\r\ncountries to reach agreement on implementing the\r\nKyoto Protocol.\r\nWe have created a democratic society and\r\nensured human rights for our people, but without\r\ninternational focus, we will not be able to provide hope\r\nand opportunity to our children, and we will continue\r\nto watch as they leave their homeland to seek an\r\neducation and a career elsewhere. For no matter what\r\nstatistics may be advanced, what references to gross\r\nnational product may be debated, until we can provide\r\nour children with the incentive to stay and help build\r\nour country, we will have lost. Thus, the Mauritius\r\nprocess is critical for Palau, and we trust that the\r\ndeveloped countries of the world will embrace it.\r\n21\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nSimilarly, we trust that United Nations agencies\r\nwill sharpen their focus on the small island developing\r\nStates and correct what we view as a current\r\nimbalance, in support of the fragile small States of the\r\nworld. We applaud the recent efforts of the Global\r\nEnvironmental Facility (GEF) to streamline assistance\r\nto Palau through the creation of an innovative North\r\nPacific subregional programme that will build our\r\ncapacity to protect our environment and create a\r\nsustainable economy.\r\nWe are troubled, however, by a growing tendency\r\nin the donor community to demand that small countries\r\nlike ours prove our capacity before assistance can be\r\ndelivered. This is a catch-22 situation that threatens to\r\nhalt our development. The only way we can build our\r\ncapacity to execute projects that will save, for example,\r\nour unique biodiversity is to experience the hard work\r\nof completing projects and learning from our\r\nexperience.\r\nThis observation does not mean that we are\r\nreluctant to accept the obligations and responsibilities\r\ninherent in receiving assistance. We are willing and\r\neager to be monitored by the international community\r\nin our performance. We firmly believe that we should\r\nbe held accountable for the quality and the\r\ntransparency of our efforts.\r\nIt is ironic that tiny countries such as ours, where\r\nso many of the worlds environmental treasures exist,\r\nare denied the assistance they need due to a perceived\r\nlack of capacity to navigate the unwieldy bureaucracies of\r\nthe international organizations charged with protecting\r\nthose very treasures.\r\nAs already noted, the failure of the world to come\r\nto agreement on implementing the Kyoto Protocol will\r\ncontribute to the destruction of our marine and\r\nterrestrial resources. Palau, like many other small\r\nisland developing States, is a window on the worlds\r\nfuture in this regard and must be carefully observed.\r\nWe urge the GEF to create real funding opportunities\r\nfor adaptation and mitigation measures in a proactive\r\nand streamlined fashion before it is too late.\r\nIn a similar vein, we are increasingly aware of the\r\nparticularly damaging fishing practice of deep-sea\r\nbottom trawling. Increasingly employed on the high\r\nseas as coastal fisheries are depleted, this technique\r\nentails dragging heavy equipment along the seabed,\r\ncompletely destroying established coral, sponge and\r\nrelated communities that have taken centuries to\r\ndevelop. We are a culture of fishing people and find\r\nthis practice unacceptable. As we participated with our\r\nPacific colleagues in eliminating drift-net fishing some\r\nyears ago, we now call upon the world to join us in\r\ndeclaring a moratorium on deep sea bottom trawling\r\nbefore this practice does any more irremediable damage.\r\nLast month, Palaus accession to the Group of\r\nAsian States created the largest regional grouping in\r\nthe United Nations. Two critical issues involving our\r\nAsian region also have great global significance.\r\nFirst, for the United Nations to be effective at\r\nensuring international peace and security, all nations,\r\nlarge and small, should be represented in its\r\ndeliberations. The Republic of China on Taiwan should\r\nno longer be kept on the sidelines of the most\r\nimportant international Organization. The principle of\r\nuniversality should be applied so that the 23 million\r\npeople of Taiwan can bring their talents, their energy\r\nand their principled democratic positions to the\r\norganizations, bodies, specialized agencies and\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations, thereby aiding the\r\nrest of the world in pursuing our mutual agenda.\r\nSecondly, and also in pursuit of the most effective\r\nmeans to strengthen the credibility of the United\r\nNations, Palau urges the United Nations to reform the\r\nSecurity Council to reflect the reality of the\r\ninternational community in the twenty-first century so\r\nthat countries that play a major role in the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security always participate\r\nin the decision-making process of the Security Council.\r\nPalau believes that the Security Council should be\r\nexpanded to include additional developing and\r\ndeveloped countries as new members, and that Japans\r\nstellar record of contribution is a solid basis for Japans\r\nassumption of permanent membership of the Security\r\nCouncil. Japan has been a leader in international\r\ninitiatives for many years, and it is for that reason that\r\nPalau takes this strongly felt position.\r\nMuch of my presentation today has focused on\r\nthe enormous threats to vulnerable island States like\r\nPalau. We agree with the Secretary-General, who\r\nobserved in his opening remarks to the high-level\r\nsegment of the twelfth session of the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development, held at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters from 28 to 30 April 2004, that high-\r\nlevel political attention has been diverted from\r\nsustainable development by the recent emphasis given\r\nto terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and the war\r\n22\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nin Iraq. But Palau also understands that the scourge of\r\nglobal terrorism and its immoral violence against\r\ninnocent people must be defeated. We are proud of our\r\nsons and daughters serving in the United States\r\nmilitary. Only last week, one of those sons, a Marine\r\nfighting side by side with Coalition forces in Iraq, paid\r\nthe ultimate price, marking the first death of a Palauan\r\nin the struggle with global terrorism. Our forces are\r\nsmall in number but, like Corporal Ngirmidol, large in\r\nloyalty, commitment and idealism. No one should\r\nmake any mistake about that.\r\nPalau is grateful to the United States for allowing\r\nus to achieve our independence and thus to join the\r\ninternational communitys quest for world peace.\r\nNonetheless, a balanced international agenda which\r\nincludes a determined focus on sustainable development\r\nis required if Palau is to achieve some measure of\r\neconomic self-reliance, and if the world as we know it\r\nis to survive.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Vice\r\nPresident and Minister of Health of the Republic of\r\nPalau for the statement she has just made.\r\nMrs. Sandra Pierantozzi, Vice-President and\r\nMinister of Health of the Republic of Palau, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Serene Highness Prince Albert,\r\nCrown Prince of the Principality of Monaco\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Serene Highness Prince\r\nAlbert, Crown Prince of the Principality of Monaco.\r\nHis Serene Highness Prince Albert, Crown Prince\r\nof the Principality of Monaco, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Serene Highness Prince Albert, Crown\r\nPrince of the Principality of Monaco, and inviting him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nCrown Prince Albert (Monaco) (spoke in\r\nFrench): It is with great pleasure that I congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your unanimous election to preside over\r\nthe fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly, an\r\nelection that offers Africa its tenth presidency. The\r\nGabonese Republic thus has received from the\r\ninternational community the recognition it deserves\r\nand the French-speaking countries are delighted to see\r\none of our own guiding our debates. Be assured that\r\nthe delegation of Monaco, which I am leading, will\r\nfully support you in your noble mission in the service\r\nof peace and development. I would also like to hail the\r\nSecretary-General for his courage and his unwavering\r\ncommitment to peace.\r\nA long time ago, the Organization began a\r\nprocess of thinking through the reforms that are\r\nrequired to improve its functioning. In that connection,\r\nI would like to congratulate the outgoing President of\r\nthe Assembly, Mr. Julian Hunte, on his work during the\r\nfifty-eighth session; his perseverance made possible\r\nthe adoption of new measures to revitalize the work of\r\nthe General Assembly. While welcoming that progress,\r\nwe know that we must continue along that path.\r\nDedication to democracy and to the rule of law,\r\nunswerving confidence in the virtues of multilateralism\r\nand respect for our differences allow us to move\r\nforward in a spirit of harmony and to continue to adapt\r\nthe Organization to meet the challenges of our time. It\r\nis vital that the Organization be provided with the\r\nmeans to better respond to the expectations of the\r\npeoples of the world.\r\nThis is why the Principality supports initiatives\r\naimed at improving the Organizations methods of\r\nwork and, in particular, those regarding Security\r\nCouncil reform. Enlargement of the Council, in both\r\npermanent and non-permanent seats, will strengthen its\r\ncapacity to contribute to the essential objectives of the\r\nmaintenance of peace by providing more equitable\r\nrepresentation of the diverse regions that compose the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe fifteenth International AIDS Conference,\r\nheld in Thailand last July, once again highlighted the\r\ndevastation caused by this terrible pandemic as well as\r\nits disastrous social consequences. However, the\r\nConference also demonstrated that when international\r\norganizations, Governments and civil society agree to\r\nwork together, we can fight this scourge more\r\neffectively. In that struggle, the role of women is\r\ncrucial. In my country, Her Serene Highness Princess\r\nStephanie, my sister, created and chairs the Fight AIDS\r\nMonaco association that gives moral and material\r\nsupport to AIDS patients and their families while\r\npromoting information and prevention programmes.\r\nFor my part, I have expressed the wish that all of\r\nthe Principalitys school children participate in marking a\r\n23\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nworld day for children orphaned by AIDS, to show\r\ntheir solidarity with these vulnerable children whose\r\nnumber could reach 100 million by the year 2010.\r\nOnce again this year, my country has been\r\ncontributing to the Global Fund to fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, which was created following\r\nthe twenty-sixth special session of the General\r\nAssembly, the first to be devoted to a disease. We have\r\nbeen providing regular support for the activities of the\r\nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS\r\n(UNAIDS) since its creation, and I am pleased to\r\nannounce that the Principality has decided to\r\nstrengthen its financial cooperation with the\r\nProgramme. We hope that the creation within UNAIDS\r\nof the Programme Acceleration Fund will allow us to\r\nmeet specific needs defined by the recipient States\r\nthemselves. In effect, we are convinced of the necessity\r\nfor States to strengthen, on the one hand, their\r\ncapacities in terms of basic social services and\r\nadequate sanitation facilities and on the other hand, to\r\npursue public awareness and information campaigns.\r\nUpon the initiative of His Serene Highness the\r\nSovereign Prince, my father, the Principality of\r\nMonaco has always expressed its solidarity to the most\r\nunderdeveloped populations. We share the concerns of\r\nworld leaders regarding the adverse impact that the\r\npersistence of extreme poverty is having on\r\ninternational security.\r\nWe shall therefore consider most carefully the\r\nelaboration of a new global partnership designed to\r\neliminate hunger and poverty and to advance economic\r\ndevelopment and social justice, as a continuation to the\r\ncommitments undertaken at the Millennium Summit\r\nand during the Monterrey Conference.\r\nTerrorism, unfortunately, has become a daily\r\nreality, as is attested to by, among others, the tragedy\r\nthat took place in Beslan, which is repugnant to all of\r\nus. Our determination to fight it must remain unshaken\r\nand that is why we welcome the establishment of an\r\nexecutive directorate of the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee. In that domain, international cooperation is\r\nan essential element for effective action. No State,\r\nregardless of its size, can be a weak link that might\r\nendanger the efforts we are conducting together.\r\nTherefore, the Principality intends to play its role\r\nin the battle which our Organization is waging against\r\nterrorism. Thus, Monaco has become a party to all of the\r\ntwelve conventions designed to eradicate international\r\nterrorism and has adopted, as domestic legislation,\r\nappropriate measures for their implementation.\r\nBut the battle against terrorism also requires that\r\nwe act irreproachably in terms of our respect for\r\nhuman rights. Accordingly, the Principality is making\r\nevery effort to guarantee them on its territory; hence\r\nMonacos forthcoming accession to the Convention on\r\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\r\nWomen.\r\nThe number of refugees and displaced persons\r\nwho are displaced within their own countries continues\r\nto increase, and our response to the unbearable\r\nsuffering of those human beings cannot be limited to\r\nour moral indignation. As in any urgent and complex\r\nemergency situation, civilians and the most vulnerable\r\namong them are the targets of harm and the worst types\r\nof abuse. The humanitarian disaster which continues to\r\ntake place under our very eyes in Darfur has shown,\r\nonce again, how limited we are in our capacity to\r\nenforce respect for human rights and for international\r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nIn response to the appeal launched by the Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees (UNHCR) during the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on children in 2002, the authorities\r\nof Monaco decided to earmark their traditional\r\ncontribution to UNHCR towards primary education for\r\nrefugee children. We hope to provide those children,\r\nwhose world has been brutally shattered overnight, a\r\nsubstitute for their traditional educational environment,\r\nby allowing them to escape, albeit a little, those terrible\r\nconditions of daily life dominated by promiscuity and\r\nthe anguish of having forever lost their homes.\r\nChampioning the interests of the child has always\r\nbeen one of our major concerns. To build a world fit\r\nfor children, in keeping with the commitments\r\nundertaken during the May 2002 special session on\r\nchildren, the World Association of Childrens Friends,\r\npresided over by my sister, Her Royal Highness the\r\nPrincess of Hanover, organized in the Principality in\r\nApril 2003, a round table on that subject.\r\nUnfortunately, the need is becoming clearer each day,\r\nto strengthen the area of international law designed to\r\nguarantee the rights of children and to assure that those\r\nlaws are more effectively applied.\r\nThus, do not those particularly heinous crimes\r\nrequire an exceptionally strong response? Do we not\r\nneed to ensure that the most serious violations of the\r\n24\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nrights of children do not fall under a statute of\r\nlimitations and do we not need to extend the powers of\r\nthe national jurisdictions by providing them with\r\nuniversal competence in that area?\r\nThe Principality of Monaco urges you to give\r\nthought to this, in other words, to plan for the adoption\r\nof a legal instrument which will make it possible here,\r\nto react against the impunity which continues to\r\nprevail, concerning the enrolment of child soldiers, the\r\nsexual exploitation of children and the despicable trade\r\nof which they are victims  to mention only the most\r\nrevolting of those crimes.\r\nThe debate held last June in the Security Council\r\nserved to reaffirm the timely nature of such\r\nconsiderations. By abolishing the statute of limitations\r\nfor those horrendous crimes, we would be\r\nstrengthening their prevention, as well as fulfilling our\r\nduty to honour the memory of the victims. By\r\nexpanding the competences of our national\r\njurisdictions so that borders no longer serve to limit\r\nour actions, we will be better able to cope with the\r\ndevelopment of the transnational organized crime\r\nnetwork which defies our States and the legal order\r\nthey are trying to establish.\r\nI am fully aware that this essentially moral\r\nstruggle  to ensure respect for the rights of the\r\nchild  gives rise, given the present state of\r\ninternational law, to numerous legal difficulties. But is\r\nit not our duty to act when that legislation is no longer\r\nadapted to meet the challenges of our time, at a time\r\nwhen the international community is clearly closing its\r\nunified ranks, to put an end to those practices which\r\nare abhorrent to all of us?\r\nLet us be courageous and foresighted in\r\nchampioning the most noble cause that exists  the\r\ndefence of innocents. Let us respond to the appeal of\r\nAlbert Einstein made so long ago that  there will be\r\nno progress in this world as long as there are unhappy\r\nchildren.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Crown\r\nPrince of the Principality of Monaco for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nCrown Prince Albert, Crown Prince of the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdullah Gül, Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey.\r\nMr. Gül (Turkey): I would like to start by\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I\r\npledge the full support of my delegation for your\r\nendeavours. I would also like to pay tribute to your\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte for his\r\nable presidency.\r\nWe are world leaders at a time when our globe is\r\nundergoing an important phase of adaptation to new\r\nrealities, opportunities and challenges.\r\nAs the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, frequently states, we now possess the know-\r\nhow to address our common concerns. The Millennium\r\nSummit, which was the largest gathering of world\r\nleaders, produced a historical document  the\r\nMillennium Declaration  which charts the right\r\ncourse for humanity in the new millennium.\r\nThe goals that the Millennium Declaration\r\ndefined for humanity are ambitious, yet achievable.\r\nReducing hunger and extreme poverty, spreading\r\nuniversal primary education, halting infectious diseases\r\nand reducing child mortality within 15 years continue\r\nto be urgent tasks.\r\nUniversal humanitarian challenges and chronic\r\npolitical-military conflicts are compounded with new\r\nand asymmetrical threats such as terrorism, narcotic\r\ndrugs, organized crime, the proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction and environmental problems.\r\nOn the other hand, racism, anti-Semitism,\r\nprejudicial attitudes against the tenets of certain creeds\r\nand cultures, among them those of Islam, and xenophobia\r\nadd fuel to those menaces. In addition, the special and\r\nurgent needs of the African continent continue to\r\nrequire a collective response.\r\nThe United Nations system should be encouraged to\r\nintensify its role in addressing those issues. Confidence in\r\nthe international order and in international institutions\r\nshould not be undermined. A more effective and credible\r\nUnited Nations would be better able to face the\r\ncommon challenges of today. The Security Council\r\nshould have a more representative and balanced\r\ncharacter; indeed, representation in the Council must\r\nbe inclusive and fair. That will increase its legitimacy\r\n25\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nand efficiency. In that respect, I would like to\r\ncommend the efforts of the Secretary-General.\r\nThe correlation between good governance and\r\npeace and prosperity is valid both domestically and\r\ninternationally. Therefore, a global agenda for reform\r\nshould cover all aspects of domestic and international\r\nlife. Each member of the international community has\r\na stake in, and responsibility for, the implementation of\r\nsuch an agenda.\r\nOn our part, my Government, fully conscious of\r\nthat correlation, has carried out sweeping political and\r\neconomic reforms in the past two years. We have thus\r\nupgraded and deepened our democracy and\r\nconsolidated an accountable, transparent and efficient\r\nadministration and a dynamic civil society upholding\r\nthe rule of law and human rights. The expectations of\r\nour people, as well as the relevant United Nations and\r\nEuropean Union standards, inspired us in our reform\r\ndrive. I take pride in the fact that many observers, both\r\nin the west and in the east, have seen in our experience\r\nthe perfect embodiment of modernity, progress,\r\nidentity and tradition.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to confirm\r\nTurkeys candidacy for a non-permanent seat in the\r\nSecurity Council for the term 2009-2010. In spite of its\r\nsubstantial contributions to peace and security, Turkey\r\nhas not been a member of the Council for almost half a\r\ncentury. Therefore we rightfully expect the support of\r\nthe General Assembly for our candidacy.\r\nOur bid for a non-permanent seat is in tune with\r\nTurkeys larger efforts to secure peace, stability and\r\nsecurity in its region and beyond. Turkey figures\r\nprominently in humanitarian activities, from Palestine to\r\nDarfur. We have been contributing increasing numbers to\r\ninternational peacekeeping missions whose geographical\r\ndistribution ranges from Bosnia to Afghanistan.\r\nTurkey has a unique position as the only member\r\nof the Organization of the Islamic Conference that is\r\nalso a candidate for membership in the European\r\nUnion. That position enables us to facilitate interaction\r\nand dialogue between the Islamic world and the West.\r\nTurkey has numerous achievements to its credit\r\nin the process of helping to create an environment\r\nconducive to development, stability and progress in our\r\nregion and beyond. The Black Sea Economic\r\nCooperation, the Economic Cooperation Organization\r\nand the Stability Pact are good examples to that effect.\r\nMy Government has been taking a peaceful and\r\nproblem-solving approach to world affairs. On the\r\nchronic issue of Cyprus, my Government fully\r\nsupported Secretary-General Kofi Annans good-\r\noffices mission, and we cooperated closely with him.\r\nThe Secretary-Generals settlement plan was the result\r\nof four years of serious negotiations between the two\r\nsides. They were conducted on the basis of a new\r\nbi-zonal partnership with a federal Government and\r\ntwo constituent States. The plan was put to separate\r\nreferendums, with the prior agreement of all parties\r\nconcerned. The Annan plan was overwhelmingly\r\naccepted by the Turkish Cypriots, but the Greek\r\nCypriot leadership chose to reject it.\r\nMr. Sevilla Somoza (Nicaragua), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nI profoundly regret the fact that an opportunity to\r\nresolve the longstanding problem of Cyprus was thus\r\nmissed. As a result, a chance to grant fresh credibility\r\nto the United Nations was lost. A possible source of\r\ninspiration for peacemakers elsewhere, in the Middle\r\nEast or the Caucasus, also disappeared.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his report to the\r\nSecurity Council, clearly stated that the referendums\r\ndrastically changed the situation on the island. It\r\nconfirmed, once again, the existence of two equal peoples\r\nand their separate rights to decide their own fate.\r\nThe Secretary-General also called on the\r\nmembers of the Security Council to\r\ngive a strong lead to all States to cooperate both\r\nbilaterally and in international bodies, to\r\neliminate unnecessary restrictions and barriers\r\nthat have the effect of isolating the Turkish\r\nCypriots and impeding their development\r\n(S/2004/437, p. 2).\r\nTurkey remains committed to a lasting settlement\r\nin Cyprus. Five months have passed since the Turkish\r\nCypriots, responding to the call of the international\r\ncommunity, voted courageously in favour of the United\r\nNations plan. However, they have yet to be rewarded\r\nfor expressing their will to reunify the island. We urge\r\nthe Security Council positively to respond to the\r\nSecretary-Generals call. We also appeal to United\r\nNations Member States to take concrete steps, at the\r\nbilateral level, to put an end to the isolation and\r\npunishment of the people of the Turkish Republic of\r\nNorthern Cyprus.\r\n26\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nTurkey has been strongly supporting, and will\r\ncontinue to support, the preservation of peace and\r\nstability in south-east Europe.\r\nWe are glad to note that considerable progress has\r\nbeen achieved in this region thanks to the sustained\r\nefforts of the international community and of the\r\nBalkan countries themselves.\r\nTurkey is determined to sustain the promising and\r\nconstructive atmosphere in our relations with Greece.\r\nWe hope that the improvement in bilateral relations\r\nwill continue in the coming period. Our wide-ranging\r\ncooperation is expanding in every field. That will\r\nfacilitate the settlement of all pending issues. It will\r\nalso result in a climate of cooperation beneficial to the\r\ntwo countries, as well as peace, stability and security in\r\nthe region as a whole.\r\nTurkey believes that it is high time to start taking\r\nconcrete steps towards eliminating the existing\r\nfrozen conflicts in the southern Caucasus, such as\r\nthose in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and South\r\nOssetia. As a neighbouring country, we are actively\r\ncontributing to efforts aimed at achieving stability and\r\nprosperity in that region. To that end, we have been\r\nencouraging all the parties concerned while facilitating\r\nthe ongoing process of dialogue. We hope that the\r\nAbkhazian conflict and the problems in South Ossetia\r\nwill be overcome by peaceful means, within the\r\nframework of the territorial integrity and sovereignty\r\nof Georgia.\r\nMy Government supports a just and lasting\r\nsolution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict on the basis\r\nof the fundamental principles of international law, the\r\nterritorial integrity of Azerbaijan and good-neighbourly\r\nrelations. We expect the Armenian Government to fully\r\ncomply with the relevant United Nations resolutions to\r\nreach such a solution.\r\nThe Middle East problem and the situation in Iraq\r\nand Afghanistan are the major conflicts responsible for\r\ncompounding instability in the world and are leading to\r\nincreasingly serious consequences.\r\nThe road map is the only available framework for\r\na comprehensive settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian\r\nproblem. Benefiting from its traditional ties with the\r\nparties, Turkey has already offered its active\r\ncontribution to the implementation of the road map. We\r\nalso support every effort that is initiated and\r\ncoordinated in that context.\r\nWe join the call made by the Quartet yesterday.\r\nThe resumption of the negotiating process between the\r\ntwo parties should remain the central objective of\r\ncurrent efforts. It is important, likewise, that both sides\r\nfulfil their performance criteria as laid out in the road\r\nmap. Terrorist attacks against the Israeli people must\r\nstop. So must the deliberate destruction of Palestinian\r\nlives and properties. The process of the reform of\r\nPalestinian institutions must be advanced. Israeli\r\nsettlement activities must be immediately halted. The\r\nruling of the International Court of Justice must be\r\nrespected. And the living conditions of the Palestinians\r\nneed to be urgently improved.\r\nAny settlement would be incomplete without\r\nprogress on all tracks, including those involving Syria\r\nand Lebanon.\r\nMy Government is focused on contributing to the\r\nimprovement of the situation in Iraq. We appreciate the\r\nmassive resources and political efforts mobilized by\r\nthe United States Administration and the international\r\ncommunity for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of\r\nIraq. We sincerely hope those efforts yield the desired\r\nresults soon. However, the humanitarian, political and\r\nsecurity difficulties faced by the people of Iraq\r\ncontinue to adversely affect one another. It goes\r\nwithout saying that developments in Iraq are also\r\naffecting my country and causing suffering for my\r\npeople, while, as we are a neighbouring country, most\r\nof Iraqs humanitarian needs are being supplied\r\nthrough Turkey.\r\nThe Iraqi transition is not only about the fate of\r\nthe Iraqi nation. It is about the future of peace and\r\nprosperity in the whole region and beyond. That is the\r\nmotive for Turkeys strong support of a united,\r\nterritorially intact and democratic Iraq  an Iraq that is at\r\npeace with itself and with its neighbours. That should\r\nand can only be achieved with the full participation and\r\nsupport of the Iraqi people as a whole. More United\r\nNations involvement would facilitate that task. The\r\nseries of neighbouring countries meetings, initiated by\r\nTurkey, is also a valuable instrument to be taken into\r\naccount. After all, as Iraqs success will be our\r\ncollective success, so its failure will also be a\r\ncollective failure. For its part, Turkey will continue to\r\nsupport the Iraqi interim Governments efforts in\r\npaving the way to normalcy and democracy.\r\nTurkeys traditional support for the Afghan\r\npeople will continue. The establishment of security,\r\n27\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nstability and a democratic system in Afghanistan is\r\nanother urgent task. Freeing that country from\r\nterrorism, extremism and narcotics is of crucial\r\nimportance for the international community. We should\r\nall work to make the upcoming elections a significant\r\nstep towards those ends.\r\nWe all agree that terrorism has no justification. It\r\ncan never claim to respect any religion, nation or\r\ncause. Indiscriminate killing of innocent people, be it\r\nin New York, Istanbul, Baghdad, Beslan or elsewhere,\r\nis a crime against humanity. We condemn those\r\nterrorist atrocities in the strongest terms.\r\nAs a country that has long suffered from\r\nterrorism, Turkey calls for more intensified multilateral\r\ncooperation. The United Nations system is an\r\nimportant platform in that respect and we extend our\r\nfull support to efforts under its aegis.\r\nWe also strongly believe in the urgent need to\r\nstrengthen the control regimes for weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and their delivery systems. We will\r\ncontinue to support ongoing work to ensure full\r\nadherence to the legal instruments in that field. The\r\ncreation of nuclear-weapon-free zones is an important\r\nway of strengthening peace and security in the world\r\nand in all regions, including the Middle East.\r\nTurkey is determined to use every effort and\r\ndeploy all the means at its disposal in order to\r\nstrengthen peace and stability in its immediate region\r\nand beyond. We will try to use the influence of our\r\nmultidimensional ties and deep-rooted relations to\r\nachieve that goal. We remain strongly committed to\r\ntranslating into reality the universal validity of the\r\nnoble values and principles enshrined in the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on Her Excellency Mrs. Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Austria.\r\nMrs. Ferrero-Waldner (Austria): I should like to\r\nbegin by congratulating Mr. Jean Ping on his election\r\nas President of the fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly. He may be sure that Austria will fully\r\nsupport him in carrying out his important task.\r\nI fully subscribe to the statement made by the\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands on\r\nbehalf of the European Union, which expressed the\r\nposition of the European Union regarding the various\r\nglobal and regional challenges we face today. I would\r\nlike to emphasize a few additional points from our own\r\nperspective.\r\nOver the past few years we have had to reassess\r\nkey concepts of our national and international security\r\nenvironment. With the emergence of new and complex\r\nthreats, in particular terrorism in combination with the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the\r\ninternational community faces unprecedented\r\nchallenges for which it has to find legitimate\r\nresponses. Just recently, we witnessed the horrifying\r\nterrorist attack against innocent school children in\r\nBeslan. This was only the last of a whole series of\r\nheinous attacks in all regions of the world targeted\r\nagainst innocents.\r\nAustria is committed to full cooperation with\r\nother States and United Nations bodies involved in\r\ncounter-terrorism and is working to promote the whole\r\nrange of United Nations action against terrorism. In\r\nVienna, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\r\nand its Terrorism Prevention Branch make an important\r\ncontribution by rendering assistance to Member States\r\nin implementing national legislation required by\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) and in\r\nbuilding their national capacity to do so.\r\nAustria is convinced that only effective\r\nmultilateralism based on the rule of law can address the\r\nnew and complex challenges that the international\r\ncommunity faces today. We support the efforts of the\r\nQuartet in the Middle East peace process, and we urge\r\nIsrael and the Palestinians to implement their\r\nrespective obligations. The road map remains the only\r\nway forward towards a just, comprehensive and lasting\r\nsettlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict leading to two\r\nStates living side by side in peace and security.\r\nThe United Nations continues to play a key role\r\nin South-Eastern Europe, especially in Kosovo. We\r\nwelcome the recent appointment of Mr. Søren Jessen-\r\nPetersen as Special Representative for Kosovo. In that\r\nregard, within the European Union, the countries of the\r\nregional partnership  the Czech Republic, Hungary,\r\nPoland, Slovakia, Slovenia and my country, Austria \r\npresented concrete proposals with regard to security,\r\neconomic development, decentralization and the\r\nprotection of minorities and of religious sites. We are\r\nconfident that they can contribute to progress in\r\nKosovo.\r\nInternational and regional efforts are essential if\r\nwe are to contain and resolve the various conflicts in\r\n28\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nother regions of the world. The dramatic situation in\r\nDarfur highlights the need for better harmonization of the\r\ninternational efforts of the United Nations, the African\r\nUnion, the EU, the League of Arab States, the United\r\nStates and other actors. We will have to examine\r\ncarefully the results of the current mission to Darfur of\r\nthe new Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide\r\nand the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nSuch missions and mechanisms are indeed the\r\ntools that the United Nations needs if it is to effectively\r\naddress emerging crisis situations. Strengthening the\r\nrule of law, human rights, democratic participation and\r\neconomic development will reduce the chance of\r\nconflicts within societies and among States turning\r\nviolent. In order to be a credible player, the United\r\nNations must be given the necessary institutional\r\nframework to enact effective strategies at all stages of\r\na conflict.\r\nAustria therefore welcomed the Secretary-\r\nGenerals call for reform, in particular his initiative to\r\nestablish a High-Level Panel of eminent persons to\r\npropose specific measures for institutional innovation\r\nby the end of the year. I was happy to meet with the\r\nmembers of the Panel when it held its meeting in\r\nAustria earlier this year.\r\nOne item on the Panels agenda is Security\r\nCouncil reform. Austria, like many other countries, is\r\nconcerned about the growing gap between the\r\nCouncils current composition on the one hand, and the\r\nchanging political, economic and social reality of the\r\ncommunity of nations on the other.\r\nIt is essential to enlarge and balance the\r\nmembership of the Security Council, as well as to\r\nincrease its transparency. In order for all peoples to\r\nidentify with its decisions, we must ensure that the\r\nSecurity Council is a body that truly reflects the\r\ndiversity of the worlds cultures and regions by an\r\nimproved representation of regions such as Africa,\r\nAsia and Latin America.\r\nAs you know, Sir, it is my personal vision that, in\r\nthe longer term, the European Union should also be\r\nrepresented in the Security Council. I pointed out\r\nduring the general debate last year that that would be\r\nthe logical consequence of further European integration\r\nin the field of common foreign and security policy.\r\nThe United Nations has been at the centre of\r\nAustrias foreign policy since we became a Member\r\nafter regaining our full independence in 1955. We have\r\nalways strongly supported the principles and purposes\r\nof the United Nations, and we remain committed to the\r\ngoals of the Charter.\r\nAustria feels honoured and privileged to host one\r\nof the headquarters of the United Nations. This year,\r\nwe celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the opening\r\nof the Vienna International Centre, home to many United\r\nNations institutions. The work of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency and the Preparatory Committee\r\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nOrganization with respect to nuclear non-proliferation;\r\nthe work of the United Nations Industrial Development\r\nOrganization on development cooperation; and the\r\nfight against the so-called uncivil society by the United\r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime, contribute\r\nsubstantially to the international communitys efforts to\r\nconfront the worlds new security threats.\r\nIn this spirit of full and honest commitment to the\r\nUnited Nations, I would like to recall that Austria is a\r\ncandidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security\r\nCouncil for the term 2009-2010. Our candidature,\r\nannounced over five years ago  in 1999  is based\r\non our willingness to contribute actively and\r\nconstructively to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. We fully recognize the heavy\r\nresponsibility which Security Council membership\r\nentails and we are ready to assume it.\r\nOver the past 50 years, Austria has sought to\r\ncontribute effectively to the work of the United Nations,\r\nin particular in the fields of peace and security, human\r\nrights, development, disarmament and international\r\nlaw. We are a significant contributor to United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations and have traditionally been\r\namong the largest European troop contributors. Since\r\n1963, over 50,000 Austrians have served in more than\r\n50 United Nations missions worldwide.\r\nSecurity, as we see it, means human security. It is\r\nthe kind of security that all human beings are looking\r\nfor, among them millions of civilians in all parts of the\r\nworld affected by armed conflict  the majority of\r\nthem women and children  and 40 million people\r\nliving with the HIV virus. Human security transcends\r\nthe concept of hard threats and soft threats. If we see\r\nthose threats through the prism of the human beings\r\nconcerned, it becomes clear that for the afflicted\r\nindividual, all such threats  war, hunger, terrorism or\r\ndeadly disease  deprive them of their security.\r\n29\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nAustria is honoured to chair the first Review\r\nConference of States Parties to the Anti-personnel\r\nMine-Ban Convention in Nairobi later this year, where\r\nthe international community will chart a course for the\r\nsolution of the landmine problem in the coming years.\r\nThe Mine-Ban Convention has become a true example\r\nof a successful and effective multilateral approach to\r\naddress a global problem. I encourage all States to\r\nparticipate at the Nairobi Summit at the highest\r\npossible level.\r\nAs a member of the Human Security Network, we\r\ncooperate with others to promote human security in the\r\nworld. To provide one concrete example, Austria \r\ntogether with Slovenia and Jordan  initiated and\r\nfunded an aid project for traumatized children in Iraq. I\r\nam convinced that applying a human security\r\nperspective to international problems has the potential\r\nof preventing or resolving conflict and promoting\r\npeace and development.\r\nWe also need to reflect further on how best to\r\nensure respect for human rights during conflict, how to\r\nincorporate human rights into preventive policies and\r\nhow to formulate post-conflict strategies likely to\r\nachieve lasting reconciliation and build a firm basis for\r\nthe rule of law and good governance. In that respect,\r\nhuman rights education is an important element in\r\ngetting to the root of conflict and breaking the vicious\r\ncircle of human rights violations.\r\nViolence between ethnic groups and religious\r\ncommunities has shaken countries across the globe. In\r\nparticular, the disregard for the needs and the rights of\r\nminorities tends to fuel violent conflict. Our\r\nendeavours for the protection of the rights of minorities\r\nare still highly needed, not the least to ensure that\r\nethnic cleansing or genocide will never happen again.\r\nWe know that the Secretary-General feels very strongly\r\nabout the need for speed of action to prevent the most\r\nheinous crimes. I share his concerns.\r\nThe Austrian Government is convinced that it is\r\nan essential responsibility of the United Nations and its\r\nMember States to address the root causes of conflict.\r\nGlobal poverty, inequality, competition for scarce\r\nresources, environmental degradation and the spread of\r\ninfectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, are among the\r\ningredients that fuel the outbreak of conflicts both\r\nwithin countries and among States.\r\nThe Austrian Development Policy has placed a\r\nparticular focus on poverty reduction, maintenance of\r\npeace and the protection of the environment. I am\r\npleased to inform the Assembly that Austria has\r\nincreased its development aid by 35 per cent this year.\r\nIn the area of environment and sustainable energy, we\r\nhave initiated and promoted the Global Forum for\r\nSustainable Energy, which aims at providing access to\r\nenergy for people in developing countries. We consider\r\nissues such as climate change, the decline of\r\nbiodiversity and other forms of environmental\r\ndegradation as essential aspects of our comprehensive\r\nsecurity agenda.\r\nLet me finally highlight an issue which the\r\nSecretary-General made a central theme of his address\r\nto the General Assembly. The key guarantee for\r\ncreating and maintaining peace and security in the\r\nworld has been and will continue to be an international\r\nsystem based on the rule of law. This was the very idea\r\nof the founders of the United Nations.\r\nI particularly welcome the Secretary-Generals\r\npledge two days ago that he will make the United\r\nNations work to strengthen the rule of law and\r\ntransitional justice in conflict and post-conflict\r\nsocieties a priority for the remainder of his tenure.\r\nParticularly for smaller and medium sized countries, an\r\ninternational order based on the rule of law is of\r\nparamount importance.\r\nWith this in mind, I would like to announce today\r\nthat I have launched a discourse on the role and\r\nfunction of the Security Council in strengthening a\r\nrules-based international system. As a first step, we\r\nwill organize in November a panel of international\r\nlegal experts during International Law Week at\r\nHeadquarters, which will analyse the increasing law-\r\nmaking tendency of the Security Council.\r\nThis is my last speech as Austrian Foreign\r\nMinister. As you may know, I have been nominated\r\nCommissioner of the European Union for External\r\nRelations and European Neighbourhood Policy. This\r\nfunction will, of course, keep me in close contact with\r\nmany Assembly delegates and with the United Nations.\r\nI would therefore like to use this opportunity today to\r\nthank all colleagues, members of delegations and, in\r\nparticular, the Secretariat, in which I myself had the\r\nhonour to work, for the support that has been extended\r\nto me and my staff here in New York over the past\r\nyears. A special and warm expression of gratitude and\r\nrespect goes to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. To the\r\nPresident of the Assembly, I would like to extend my\r\n30\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nbest wishes for a successful and constructive fifty-\r\nninth session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Sergey Lavrov, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Russian Federation.\r\nMr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): I am addressing the Assembly today at a most\r\ndifficult time for our country, when tears are still being\r\nshed by those who lost their children and loved ones\r\nduring the horrific terrorist attack in the Russian city of\r\nBeslan. I would like from this rostrum to take this\r\nopportunity to express once again my gratitude to all\r\nthose who have shown their solidarity with Russia in\r\nthese tragic days. Our special thanks go to the States and\r\ninternational organizations that extended their helping\r\nhand to the victims and the bereaved families  to all\r\nthose who have suffered from this outrage.\r\nI am also addressing the Assembly at a moment\r\nof truth, when there cannot possibly be any doubt\r\nwhatever remaining as to the true nature of\r\ninternational terrorism and the challenge it has flung\r\ndown before the world community. With their actions\r\nthroughout the world, the terrorists have once and for\r\nall placed themselves in opposition to civilized\r\nmankind. In fact, having made the mass murder of\r\npeople an end in itself, they have knowingly violated\r\nall norms of human morality.\r\nRussia has drawn harsh conclusions. They have\r\nbeen set forth in the 4 and 13 September addresses by\r\nthe President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir V.\r\nPutin. We will not allow anyone to encroach on the\r\nsovereignty of our State. We will resolutely strengthen\r\nthe unity of the country and its people in order to\r\ncounter terror and to guarantee a secure and decent life\r\nfor our citizens in freedom and democracy.\r\nThe measures announced by the Russian\r\nPresident to achieve these objectives will be\r\nimplemented on the basis of our countrys\r\nConstitution; and we will continue to defend our\r\nlegitimate interests throughout the world, not through\r\nconfrontation, but by means of equitable dialogue,\r\ncooperation and partnership. Moreover, a readiness to\r\nengage in honest cooperation in fighting terrorism\r\nwithout double standards, is becoming one of the key\r\ncriteria in our relations with any and all States.\r\nWe must enter into a qualitatively new and critical\r\nstage in the activities of the anti-terrorist coalition. The\r\nmeeting of the Security Council of 1 September\r\ndemonstrated the strong determination of the\r\ninternational community to continue its fight against\r\nterrorism in a consistent way. It is important now to\r\ntranslate this commitment into practical actions as\r\nquickly as possible.\r\nIn the three years that have passed since the\r\nterrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, a\r\nlot has been done to develop effective partnership in\r\nthis sphere. However, compared to the scale of the\r\nthreat, far from enough has been done. It is important\r\nto learn lessons from the experience gained and to\r\ndraw conclusions for the future.\r\nFirst, the global nature of the terrorist threat testifies\r\nto the fact that security in todays world is indivisible.\r\nConsequently, only collective responsibility can make\r\nthe world secure. The fight against terrorism should\r\nunite States rather than pit them against each other. We\r\ncan deal with this evil only on a multilateral basis by\r\ncombining our efforts and acting in the spirit of solidarity.\r\nAs President Putin has declared, Russia considers the\r\nobjective of strengthening the anti-terrorist coalition to\r\nbe one of our most important tasks.\r\nA special emphasis here should be placed on\r\nintensifying the cooperation among our special services,\r\nwhich, we are convinced, must now be raised to a\r\nqualitatively new level of trust and coordinated action.\r\nSecondly, a clear strategy and a generally\r\nacceptable legal framework are the prerequisites for\r\nsuccess in combating terrorism. Such a framework is\r\nenshrined in resolution 1373 (2001) and in other\r\ndecisions of the Security Council. But now, additional\r\nefforts are needed. They include making necessary\r\namendments to national legislation, acceding to\r\ninternational anti-terrorist conventions and finalizing\r\nnew international counter-terrorism legal instruments.\r\nIn circumstances where international terrorism\r\nhas declared war on our entire civilization, the\r\ndetermination of States to use their right of self-\r\ndefence in conformity with Article 51 of the United\r\nNations Charter is of particular importance. Of course\r\ninternational law is clearly not an inalterable dogma.\r\nThe fight against terrorism calls for its development\r\nand improvement.\r\nThirdly, the time has come to renounce double\r\nstandards once and for all when it comes to terror,\r\nregardless of the slogans in which it may be cloaked.\r\n31\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nThose who slaughtered children in Beslan and hijacked\r\naeroplanes to attack America are creatures of the same\r\nilk.\r\nHarbouring terrorists, their henchmen and their\r\nsponsors undermines unity and mutual trust among\r\nthose that form part of the anti-terrorist front, serves as\r\njustification for the actions of terrorists and indeed\r\nencourages them to commit similar crimes in other\r\ncountries. I would recall that United Nations decisions\r\nrequire States granting political asylum to carefully\r\nexamine the personal records of each individual to\r\nmake sure that he or she has no links to terrorism.\r\nAttempts to use the fight against terrorism in various\r\ngeopolitical games are even more counterproductive\r\nand dangerous.\r\nFourth, the utter atrociousness of the recent\r\nterrorist attacks proves there is the need for reliable\r\nsafeguards against terrorists gaining access to weapons\r\nof mass destruction. Russia is prepared for the closest\r\nkind of international partnership in that area. Our\r\ncountry was one of the sponsors of Security Council\r\nresolution 1540 (2004). It is a participant in the\r\nProliferation Security Initiative and a co-sponsor of the\r\nGroup of Eight (G-8) Action Plan on Non-\r\nProliferation. Those initiatives are complementary and\r\nare designed to increase the effectiveness of the regime of\r\nthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nsomething which is especially relevant on the eve of the\r\n2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\r\nFifth, drug trafficking is increasingly interwoven\r\nwith terrorism. The drug flow from Afghanistan has\r\nacquired global significance. The implementation of a\r\nset of social, economic and law-enforcement measures\r\nboth within and outside the borders of that country is\r\nnow more urgent than ever. One of the key elements of\r\nthat strategy lies in strengthening the existing anti-drug\r\nsecurity belts and creating new ones.\r\nRussia is making an important contribution\r\ntowards resolving the drug problem, including through\r\nthe formulation of specific legal, political and\r\noperational measures within the framework of the\r\nShanghai Cooperation Organization and the Collective\r\nSecurity Treaty Organization (CSTO). We are ready to\r\ncoordinate actions with the Government of\r\nAfghanistan, and with the multinational and coalition\r\nforces operating in that country.\r\nSixth, international terrorists have neither\r\nnationality nor religion. In fact, it is specifically\r\nreligion and national culture that, today as never\r\nbefore, require protection from the devastating impact\r\nof extremism of any kind. There is a need for\r\nrespectful dialogue among various religions and\r\ncivilizations. Russia, which is open both to the West\r\nand to the East, is ready to play its part in that process,\r\nwhich is intended to prevent a split in civilization.\r\nAnother pressing task today is the saving of\r\nworld spiritual and cultural monuments from attacks by\r\nextremists. We deem it essential to establish\r\ncooperation in that area between the United Nations\r\nand its specialized agencies, primarily the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO). Failing to act here  as well\r\nas standing by in silence at the desecration of\r\nmemorials to Second World War heroes and victims\r\nand at attempts to rehabilitate fascists  can only play\r\ninto the hands of those who wish to incite extremist\r\ntrends in society.\r\nSeventh, Russia believes that the United Nations\r\nmust continue to play a pivotal role in uniting the\r\nefforts of the international community in its fight\r\nagainst terrorism. As Chair of the Security Councils\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), our country\r\nintends to actively contribute to speeding up the reform\r\nof that Committee. We propose drafting a new Security\r\nCouncil resolution that would ensure the most effective\r\npossible functioning of the CTC, so as to identify, in a\r\ntimely manner, weak links in the anti-terrorism\r\nnetwork and increase practical cooperation between the\r\nCTC and international and regional organizations,\r\nincluding the Commonwealth of Independent States\r\n(CIS), the CSTO and the Shanghai Cooperation\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe CIS summit held recently in Astana,\r\nKazakhstan, reaffirmed the strong potential of CIS\r\nregional structures in all areas, from anti-terrorist\r\nactivities and ensuring collective security to\r\nintensifying economic integration.\r\nCertainly, in an increasingly interdependent\r\nworld, the war on terrorism cannot be considered in\r\nisolation from other pressing issues facing mankind.\r\nThis is especially relevant to the settlement of\r\nconflicts, which for decades have been destabilizing\r\nthe situation at the regional and global levels. Through\r\nits decisions, the General Assembly must promote a\r\n32\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nMiddle East settlement on the basis of commitments\r\nmade by the parties under the road map. Yesterday, the\r\nQuartet of international mediators spoke out to that end.\r\nThe situation in Iraq is a source of serious\r\nconcern. Russia is ready to render all possible\r\nassistance towards attaining a political settlement\r\naimed at preserving Iraqs territorial integrity and\r\nensuring its political sovereignty and a genuinely\r\ndemocratic post-war recovery. The search for national\r\nreconciliation within Iraq is of key significance; here,\r\nthe Iraqis could be assisted by the holding of an\r\ninternational conference with the participation of all\r\nmajor Iraqi political forces, friendly States, Security\r\nCouncil members and the League of Arab States and\r\nother organizations.\r\nWe must remain vigilant with regard to Kosovo,\r\nwhich is a dangerous hotbed of tension. There is no\r\nroom for complacency. We must work to ensure that\r\nuniversally recognized standards of human rights and\r\nthe rights of national minorities are applied in the\r\nregion. We also need to make full use of existing\r\nmechanisms for conflict settlement within the CIS.\r\nConsolidating the peacemaking capacity of the\r\ninternational community is crucial to overcoming\r\nregional crises. A collective response to humanitarian\r\ncrises, in particular those on the African continent, in\r\nfull compliance with the United Nations Charter and in\r\na spirit of partnership with regional structures, would\r\nleave no doubt that the Charter remains a universal\r\nbasis for the effective solution of such problems.\r\nThe United Nations must continue to focus its\r\nattention on other global threats to security and\r\nsustainable development as well. Those include the\r\neradication of poverty and illiteracy as a breeding\r\nground for extremism. Annually, our country grants\r\n1,000 scholarships to students from African countries.\r\nRussia has contributed $7.5 million to the Global Fund\r\nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and has\r\nprovided bilateral humanitarian assistance to a number\r\nof African countries.\r\nAmong the challenges and threats is that of\r\nfinding ways to bridge the gap between poor and rich\r\nStates. Russia has been making its contribution there;\r\nbetween 1998 and 2002 it wrote off the debt of African\r\ncountries equivalent to $11.2 billion.\r\nAnother challenge is ensuring environmental\r\nsecurity. Here I would like to confirm that in\r\naccordance with the decision of President Vladimir V.\r\nPutin we are now engaged in serious consideration of\r\nratification of the Kyoto Protocol.\r\nThe challenges also include preventing the\r\ntransformation of outer space into a theatre of armed\r\nconfrontation. Together with China, we are calling for the\r\nconclusion of a comprehensive agreement to that end. We\r\ncall upon all countries with space capability to join in that\r\ninitiative. There is also a growing need to elaborate a\r\nUnited Nations convention on outer space law.\r\nA further challenge is the fight against gross\r\nviolations of human rights, with a view to ensuring the\r\nsecurity and dignity of the individual. The United\r\nNations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe, the Council of Europe and other\r\norganizations should not remain passive spectators\r\nwhen, in some countries, a considerable part of the\r\npopulation is deprived of citizenship and consequently\r\nof basic political, social and economic rights.\r\nOn Russias initiative, the General Assembly, at\r\nits fifty-seventh and fifty-eighth sessions, adopted\r\nresolutions 57/145 and 58/16 respectively, on\r\nestablishing, under the aegis of the United Nations, a\r\ncomprehensive approach to countering new threats and\r\nchallenges. The resolutions contain specific guidelines\r\nfor bringing the international community closer to a\r\nnew security model that would meet the global\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nThose are the lines along which the High-level\r\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change, established\r\nby the Secretary-General, is organizing its work. We\r\nhope that its recommendations will pave the way for a\r\ngenuine enhancement of the effectiveness of the United\r\nNations. At the same time, reform of the Organization,\r\nand particularly of the Security Council, should be\r\nbased on the broadest possible agreement and should\r\nnot provoke the alienation of States.\r\nThe international community is undergoing a\r\ncomplex period in its establishment of a new system of\r\ninternational relations. It is already clear that this will\r\nbe a long-term process with an uncertain future and\r\none that, so far, is difficult to predict. At the same time,\r\nthere is an enormous increase in the number of new\r\nunresolved problems and new dangerous challenges to\r\nsecurity and the development of mankind. We still lack\r\na collective strategy and universally applicable\r\nmechanisms for responding to those challenges. In fact,\r\n33\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nwe have to constantly improvise and use makeshift\r\nmeans to ensure world stability.\r\nA question arises as to whether we could soon\r\nfind ourselves in a situation in which events start to go\r\nout of control. Is it not time for the international\r\ncommunity to assume an active role in impacting upon\r\nglobal processes and taking targeted actions to\r\nestablish a more secure and just world order? Russia is\r\nfully determined, together with other countries, to\r\nbuild such a world order and take its proper place\r\ntherein as a free and democratic State.\r\nMore than half a century ago, the civilized world\r\nput aside all its disputes and differences and mobilized\r\nits efforts to counter the deadly threat of Nazi\r\nenslavement. The enemy that opposes us today is no\r\nless dangerous and no less merciless. Russia sincerely\r\nhopes that the forthcoming sixtieth anniversary of the\r\nend of World War II and the establishment of the\r\nUnited Nations will become a historic milestone on the\r\npath to a world order in which the twenty-first century\r\nsees the noble principles of peace, stability and\r\ndevelopment enshrined in the United Nations Charter\r\nhold sway.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency The Right Honourable Jack\r\nStraw, Secretary of State for Foreign and\r\nCommonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom of\r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nMr. Straw (United Kingdom): Mr. President, I\r\noffer my congratulations and those of my country on\r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-ninth session.\r\nEighteen months ago, the United Nations faced\r\ndivisions more serious than any since the Cuban\r\nmissile crisis of October 1962. We all worried whether\r\nthe strength and unity which we had built up since the\r\nend of the cold war could survive.\r\nThen last year we watched, as Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan stood at his now famous fork in the road.\r\nIn the year since, almost instinctively, we have decided\r\nto follow our Secretary-Generals directions. This\r\nOrganization has not been plunged, as some predicted,\r\ninto paralysis; instead, I have felt a powerful if\r\nunspoken determination to make the United Nations\r\nwork, and to work more effectively, to fulfil its central\r\ntask: to secure peace around the world.\r\nOver the last 12 months we have dealt with new\r\ncrises such as that in Darfur in the Sudan, where we\r\nhave set clear tasks for both the Sudanese Government\r\nand the rebel groups. We have tackled the situation in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great\r\nLakes; mobilized international support for the new\r\nIraq; and addressed a long list of hugely important\r\nsubjects which rarely receive the coverage they should\r\nin the media  Haiti, Georgia, Timor-Leste,\r\nBougainville and Western Sahara.\r\nWe have shown in those actions the unity of\r\npurpose which is one of the strongest weapons in our\r\nhands to defeat the evils which today affect the globe.\r\nAnd the search for consensus has not been confined to\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nI am proud that just a few months after the\r\ndifficult times of early last year, France, Germany and\r\nthe United Kingdom came together to work, as we\r\ncontinue to do, on the Iran dossier before the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\r\nI recognize, of course, the frustrations which all\r\nof us feel, not least over the Israel-Palestine conflict,\r\nwhere the clear path to peace set out in the road map\r\nand endorsed by the Security Council remains elusive.\r\nBut all in all we have shown the will to make collective\r\naction work, though we know, too, that we need to go\r\nfurther.\r\nIn particular, we need to get better at tackling\r\nthreats which have changed dramatically since the\r\nfounding of the United Nations. Today the greatest\r\nthreats to our security often come not from other\r\nfunctioning sovereign States, but from terrorist\r\norganizations, from failing States and from man-made\r\nshocks to our environment like climate change, which\r\ncan exacerbate State failure and breed internal\r\ninstability.\r\nThe High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\r\nChange appointed by the Secretary-General is\r\npreparing its recommendations on ways to address the\r\nvarious challenges. We should remember in all this that\r\nwe have one great advantage. Though its institutions\r\nand the founding text of the Charter has hardly\r\nchanged in 60 years, the United Nations is not an\r\norganization set in stone, but a set of living institutions\r\nbased on a shared will to make collective security\r\nwork. The United Nations has adapted in the past \r\nwith the development of peacekeeping, a greater focus\r\non individual rights and the setting of global targets for\r\n34\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\ndevelopment  and I am confident that it can adapt in\r\nthe future.\r\nOf course, institutional change is part of that. At\r\nthe United Nations foundation, one eighth of its\r\nmembers could expect to be elected members of the\r\nSecurity Council at any one time. Today that\r\nproportion is less than one eighteenth. The United\r\nKingdom has long supported the case for expanding\r\nthe Security Council to, say, 24 members, and for\r\nincluding amongst the permanent members: Germany\r\nand Japan, two countries which between them\r\ncontribute 28 per cent of the budget of the United\r\nNations; India, which represents one sixth of the entire\r\nworlds population; and Brazil, which just missed\r\npermanent membership back in 1945.\r\nBut we should not see an expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council, or other institutional change, as a\r\npanacea. The biggest need is to adapt our common\r\nunderstanding  the United Nations jurisprudence, if\r\nyou like  and its operational effectiveness so that we\r\ncan respond more quickly and more thoroughly to\r\ntodays new threats.\r\nLet me highlight three areas which to me seem\r\nparticularly important: first, our approach must be\r\nbroader and must tackle threats to the most vulnerable,\r\nincluding poverty, disease and environmental\r\ndegradation; secondly, we must build a new consensus by\r\nexpanding the scope of collective action; and, thirdly, we\r\nmust deal with the threat of terrorism, which menaces\r\nus all and everything for which we stand.\r\nLet me now take these three points in turn. First,\r\nthere is the need for a broader approach which\r\naddresses the complex and interdependent nature of\r\nsecurity today. Here, we have to do more to meet the\r\nMillennium Development Goals and to promote\r\nsustainable development, especially in Africa. We\r\ncannot have security without development or\r\ndevelopment without security.\r\nAs the Secretary-General highlighted in his\r\nspeech this week, we have to do more to entrench the\r\nrule of law and justice, especially in States recovering\r\nfrom conflict. The United Kingdom will pursue work\r\non the Secretary-Generals report during its Security\r\nCouncil presidency next month.\r\nWe could also use the United Nations better, to\r\nagree to monitor and help implement globally accepted\r\nnorms of good governance.\r\nAnd we need to act together quickly on climate\r\nchange, perhaps the greatest long-term threat to our\r\nworld in terms of stability and security. We have to\r\nimplement Kyoto  and I greatly welcome what my\r\ncolleague, His Excellency Sergey Lavrov had to say on\r\nthat today  and agree to emission reductions beyond\r\n2012.\r\nMy second point is the need to build a new\r\nconsensus on the scope of collective action. We all\r\nrepresent independent, sovereign states. But even as we\r\nfounded the United Nations we recognized that\r\nsovereignty was a trust in the hands of a nations\r\ngovernment: there to be respected, not abused, from\r\neither without or within.\r\nThe Charter set out arrangements so that an abuse\r\nfrom without could be dealt with through the inherent\r\nright of self-defence recognized in Article 51 of the\r\nCharter. But it also said that an abuse from within\r\nwhich threatens the peace could and should be dealt\r\nwith by the Security Council, under the powers\r\nenshrined in the other articles of Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter, and by the many conventions concluded\r\nwithin the United Nations framework, including, for\r\nexample, the 1948 Geneva Convention. No longer \r\nwe all said  could or should the world turn away\r\nfrom unspeakable barbarities like that of the Holocaust.\r\nBut we have not always lived up to those high\r\nexpectations, as the tragedies of Rwanda and Bosnia\r\nten years ago reminded us. Today we must resolve to\r\ndo so and to engage in situations of humanitarian\r\ncatastrophe or grave violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law and to act in the face of other threats\r\nto international peace and security.\r\nThe principle of non-interference has to be\r\nqualified by a duty to protect, especially where\r\nGovernments are failing in that duty.\r\nWe therefore need, for example, to be ready to\r\nsupport greater use by the Secretary-General of his\r\npowers under Article 99 of the Charter, to bring threats\r\nto peace to the Security Councils attention. We have to\r\nact quickly in response, because prevention is far better\r\nthan cure. We should look to work more closely with\r\nregional organizations, as we are doing with the\r\nAfrican Union in Darfur. We need more discussion on\r\nthe criteria as to when the international community\r\nmight have to intervene with military force in extreme\r\ncircumstances. We must get better at engaging for the\r\nlong term in countries recovering from conflict,\r\n35\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\ncoordinating our efforts in response to locally agreed\r\npriorities.\r\nMy third point is the urgent need to combat\r\nglobal terrorism, a menace directed at us all. If we have\r\nlearned anything in the three years since 11 September\r\n2001 it is that international terrorism is indiscriminate\r\nin its targets and merciless in its hatred. Christian, Jew,\r\nHindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Muslim, people of no religion\r\nor any religion, and of every or no shade of political\r\nopinion, all have died through the terrorists bullet or\r\nbomb.\r\nMy friend Sergey Lavrov spoke eloquently a\r\nmoment ago about the tears still wet for the terrible,\r\nunspeakable massacre of the young and innocent that\r\ntook place in Beslan. Sergey, your tears are my tears;\r\nRussias tears are the worlds tears. We are all in the\r\nfight against terrorism together.\r\nToday in Iraq we are seeing again the depths to\r\nwhich the terrorists plumb. The vast majority of the\r\nvictims of terrorism in Iraq are Iraqis. Our thoughts\r\nand condolences are with the Government and people\r\nof Iraq and with their families. But some of the victims\r\nof terrorism in Iraq are foreigners who are helping\r\nIraqis to build a more stable and prosperous country.\r\nOne of them is Kenneth Bigley, a British engineer held\r\nhostage by terrorists who have already barbarically\r\nmurdered his two American comrades. Our thoughts\r\nand prayers are with their families. We continue to do\r\nall we can to secure Mr. Bigleys release.\r\nI know  how could I forget  that opinions\r\nhave differed over the rightness of the military action\r\ntaken in Iraq 18 months ago. But I warrant that no\r\nnation is in favour of the terrorist insurgency now\r\noccurring there. For we all recognize that what is being\r\nattempted by the terrorists in Iraq is an attack both on\r\nthe Iraqi people and on everything for which the\r\nOrganization stands: safety, security and human rights.\r\nWe have to come together to defeat the terrorists and\r\ntheir despicable aims.\r\nThe threat of terrorism confronts democratic,\r\nproperly functioning States with an acute dilemma,\r\nnamely, how to fight those who recognize none of the\r\nvalues for which we stand while remaining true to\r\nthose values. Our commitments under international\r\nconventions express many of those values and the\r\nimportance that we attach to them. But equally, those\r\nconventions cannot be allowed to shelter those\r\ninvolved in terrorism. The conventions were designed\r\nto protect citizens from abuse by States, not by\r\nterrorists.\r\nThe 1951 Convention relating to the Status of\r\nRefugees protects those with a well-founded fear of\r\npersecution. I am proud that the United Kingdom and so\r\nmany other nations have offered that protection when and\r\nwhere it was required. But as the 1951 Convention\r\nitself sets out, asylum is not an unqualified right. It does\r\nnot apply to anyone who has committed a war crime, a\r\ncrime against humanity or other serious crime; nor\r\ndoes it apply to anyone who is guilty of acts contrary\r\nto the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\r\nWe must never stoop to the level of the terrorist \r\nto torture, mistreatment or unjustified incarceration \r\nnor will any country within the European Union be\r\nparty to the return of suspects to such conditions, nor\r\nto face the death penalty. But we cannot let terrorists\r\nexploit a protection designed for the persecuted, not\r\nthe persecutors. We in the United Kingdom shall\r\ntherefore be working closely with Russia on its\r\nimportant draft Security Council resolution, to see how\r\nbest we can prevent those who commit, support and\r\nfinance terrorism from sheltering behind a refugee\r\nstatus to which they are not entitled. Along with the\r\nRussian Federation and other partners in the Security\r\nCouncil, we also wish to look at ways to ensure the\r\nspeedier extradition of such individuals.\r\nWe, the United Nations, have over the last year\r\nbegun to show a new determination to come together\r\nand to make collective action work. A year from now,\r\nwe will meet again here to review the\r\nrecommendations of the High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change, as well as the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, and to set the United Nations\r\nagenda for the next decade. The United Kingdoms\r\nchairmanship of the G-8 next year will focus on\r\ntackling climate change and on Africa, on which the\r\nIndependent Commission for Africa will be producing\r\nrecommendations as to how best we can support the\r\nradical agenda for change and development designed\r\nby Africa itself through the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development and the African Union. Our\r\npresidency of the European Union will help us to lead\r\nefforts for a successful outcome in the Doha\r\nDevelopment Round, and for building the European\r\nUnions crisis-management capabilities.\r\nMore than ever, global security is our shared\r\nresponsibility. In the year ahead, as we continue to\r\n36\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nadapt to todays threats and challenges, we must find\r\nrenewed determination and political will to make\r\ncollective security work. The United Kingdom is\r\ndetermined to play its full part in that endeavour.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Brian Cowen, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Ireland.\r\nMr. Cowen (Ireland): I first addressed the\r\nGeneral Assembly in the year 2000. The millennium\r\nyear was a time of great hope, reflected in the outcome\r\nof the Millennium Summit. World leaders committed\r\nthe peoples of the planet to a new beginning in which\r\nthe dawn of the twenty-first century would mark a\r\nbreak from the past, with a new sharing of burdens,\r\nand a new common dedication to peace and human\r\nprogress.\r\nToday the light of that new dawn is obscured by\r\nthe dark clouds of war, terror, ethnic violence and\r\ncontinuing abuse of human rights. Twelve months ago\r\nand again this week, the Secretary-General pointed out\r\nthat the Organization is at a fork in the road and that\r\nwe have to decide on the way forward. Much work has\r\nbeen undertaken since the Secretary-General laid down\r\nthat challenge. The High-level Panel on Threats,\r\nChallenges and Change is working on its report. I am\r\npleased to recall that the European Union (EU) made a\r\ndetailed submission to the Panel, drawn up during\r\nIrelands recent presidency of the Union. We also took\r\na decision to mainstream the issue of effective\r\nmultilateralism in the Unions discussions with other\r\nregional groups.\r\nWe await the Panels report and the Secretary-\r\nGenerals recommendations that will follow. In his\r\naddress on Tuesday, the Secretary-General expressed\r\nthe hope that when the heads of State and Government\r\nmeet next year to review progress on the Millennium\r\nDeclaration they will be ready to take bold decisions.\r\nThey must, because the longer we linger at the fork in\r\nthe road, the more difficult will be the road ahead.\r\nWe cannot afford to postpone action. More and\r\nmore citizens of the world are questioning whether the\r\nUnited Nations has the capacity, or even the will, to\r\nprevent conflict and protect the vulnerable from\r\ninjustice. They are becoming increasingly disillusioned\r\nwith an Organization which either cannot take\r\ndecisions or whose decisions are ignored with\r\nimpunity. They see the politics of the lowest common\r\ndenominator in operation, with strong and sensible\r\ndraft resolutions watered down to mere platitudes.\r\nThey hear the United Nations being denigrated by\r\nthose who make a virtue of their determination to put\r\nnational interests above all other considerations. They\r\nfear that the Organization is no longer driven by the\r\ndetermination and idealism of the founding fathers.\r\nMy Prime Minister, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern,\r\nmade clear last year, when he addressed the General\r\nAssembly, where the fault lies. It lies with us, the\r\nGovernments of the Member States. We have a strong\r\nand much respected Secretary-General in Kofi Annan.\r\nWe have brave and dedicated officials. Many have put\r\ntheir lives on the line for the Organization and what it\r\nstands for. Some have made the ultimate sacrifice. United\r\nNations staff deserve better protection in the future.\r\nIt is time for the Governments of Member States\r\nto act. We need, as the Secretary-General put it, to seek\r\ncommon solutions to common problems. That will\r\nrequire political will and effective structures. Neither\r\none on its own will suffice. The essential requirement\r\nis a more effective system of collective security. Such a\r\nsystem requires the unique legitimacy offered by an\r\neffective United Nations and its Charter.\r\nIt is clear that the composition of the Security\r\nCouncil no longer accurately reflects global\r\ngeopolitical realities. In Irelands view, a modest and\r\nregionally balanced increase in its membership, both in\r\nthe permanent and non-permanent categories, is\r\njustified. Increased representation from the developing\r\nworld would enhance its legitimacy, and thereby its\r\neffectiveness.\r\nBut a more effective Security Council will need\r\nmore than a change in structures. There has to be a\r\nchange in attitudes. Those States that sit on the Security\r\nCouncil have a responsibility to rise above national or\r\nregional interests and act in the wider interests of\r\nmankind. That is an obligation that rests on each and\r\nevery member of the Council. But those who either\r\nassert or aspire to positions of world leadership  and\r\nthere is no shortage of candidates  bear a particular\r\nresponsibility to act in the global interest.\r\nPutting national interests first is not an effective\r\nanswer to the challenges that confront us. It may be a\r\ncliché to say that our planet is shrinking, but that does\r\nnot make it any less true. While most of us continue to\r\nwish to organize and govern ourselves primarily within\r\nthe framework of the nation-State, we must recognize\r\nthat technological development and economic\r\n37\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nintegration are impairing the effectiveness of the\r\nnation-State as a defensive bastion.\r\nPower and influence must be used in the interests\r\nof the international community as a whole, rather than\r\nfor the pursuit of narrow, short-term interests. States\r\nand regions have broad and varied interests, both\r\nindividual and collective. Our system must\r\naccommodate and reconcile those interests. Otherwise\r\nwe are doomed to division between those who would\r\nimpose hegemony and those who would resist it.\r\nIn his report on the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, the Secretary-General has\r\nwarned that the world is falling short in its\r\nperformance towards the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. In sub-Saharan Africa\r\nespecially, many countries are caught in a poverty trap\r\nand face the crippling challenges of unsustainable debt\r\nand HIV/AIDS, often compounded by instability.\r\nIreland fully recognizes the seriousness of the\r\nshortfall in development funding that faces us, which is\r\npresently estimated at 50 billion per year. The best\r\nmeans of bridging that gap is for donor nations to\r\nrecommit themselves to reaching the United Nations\r\ntarget for official development assistance of 0.7 per\r\ncent of gross national product. The Irish Government\r\nremains committed to that goal. Ireland, which has\r\nincreased its official development assistance very\r\nsubstantially in recent years, will continue working\r\nactively with its developing country partners to build a\r\nstrong global partnership for development.\r\nEconomic and social development is the means\r\nby which the worlds poorer countries can be lifted out\r\nof poverty. An open international trading regime aimed\r\nat facilitating investment is an integral part of our\r\nmultilateral system, and fair market access is an\r\nessential part of that. Some developing countries\r\nestimate that, in a best-case scenario, a successful\r\noutcome to the Doha Round could help raise up to 500\r\nmillion people out of extreme poverty. Fairer\r\ninternational trading arrangements are imperative if we\r\nare to address the problems of underdevelopment.\r\nIreland and its European Union partners are determined\r\nnot to be found wanting in the task of bringing the\r\nDoha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, finally,\r\nto a conclusion, with an agreement that meets the\r\nessential concerns of all sides.\r\nOver the past year we have once again seen that\r\nthe failure of State institutions is a major source of\r\nconflict and human misery. The responsibility for\r\nprotecting people from conflict and the effects of\r\nconflict, and from humanitarian catastrophe, lies\r\nprimarily with the Governments concerned. However,\r\nit has been well demonstrated that events within a\r\nparticular country can threaten international peace and\r\nsecurity and spread misery far beyond its borders.\r\nWhere Governments are unable or unwilling to take the\r\nnecessary steps to prevent catastrophe in their own\r\ncountry, I believe that the international community has\r\nresponsibilities to protect in those circumstances.\r\nIt is increasingly evident that instability very\r\nfrequently arises from situations where human rights\r\nare abused or denied. The abuse of human rights is also\r\nat the root of poverty and underdevelopment. Respect\r\nfor human rights, on the other hand, is an essential\r\nelement of good governance, and must be at the centre\r\nof efforts to prevent conflict, and of post-conflict\r\nreconstruction. Presently, 40 per cent of conflicts that\r\nappear to have been resolved break out again within\r\nfive years. We simply must do better in identifying\r\nemerging problems sooner. We also need to put in\r\nplace policies and structures that are effective within a\r\nnew, enforceable legal framework.\r\nI hope, therefore, that the High-level Panel will\r\naddress the serious questions involved in international\r\nintervention, and put forward recommendations that\r\nwill act as a basis for consensus. We trust that they will\r\nalso give full and careful consideration to the policies\r\nand structures that we need in order to carry out our\r\nresponsibilities towards States and societies at risk of\r\ninstability. Any such structures must facilitate a\r\nsustained engagement with those States, to ensure that\r\nthey receive whatever assistance is needed  political,\r\nhumanitarian and economic  to avert instability or a\r\nreturn to conflict. In addressing those problems on the\r\nbasis of the report of the High-level Panel, let us not\r\nsacrifice substance on the altar of process.\r\nIreland welcomes the increasing role of regional\r\nand subregional organizations in crisis management,\r\nunder the overall authority of the Security Council. The\r\nEuropean Union is engaged in developing its role in\r\nconflict prevention and crisis management, while fully\r\nrecognizing the central role and authority of the United\r\nNations. I am pleased to state that during Irelands\r\nrecent presidency of the European Union, important\r\nprogress was achieved in implementing the Joint\r\nDeclaration on United Nations-European Union\r\nCooperation in Crisis Management. It was agreed in\r\n38\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nJune, during our presidency, that the European Union\r\nwill make a rapid response capability available, and at\r\nthe service of the United Nations. That will take effect\r\non an initial basis in 2005, with the full complement of\r\n1,500 troops being ready and available by 2007.\r\nThe efforts of the African Union and the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States in crisis\r\nmanagement have been particularly valuable and\r\ndeserve support. The African Unions involvement in\r\nDarfur, where it currently has 120 monitors with a\r\nprotection force of 300, is an extremely positive\r\ndevelopment. It is fully supported by the European\r\nUnion, including through the African Peace Facility,\r\nestablished during Irelands recent presidency of the\r\nUnion. The African Union is planning to augment its\r\ncontingent in Sudan, where it is estimated that a force\r\nof at least 5,000 may be necessary to assure a secure\r\nenvironment for the people of Darfur. The European\r\nUnion is ready to increase its backing for the African\r\nUnions effort accordingly.\r\nWhatever political difficulties may have arisen in\r\nDarfur, the people there did not deserve to suffer\r\nmassacre, rape and famine, or to see their villages and\r\ncrops destroyed and their livestock driven off. When\r\nthe depredations of the ruthless militias were unleashed\r\nupon them, they looked in vain for the even-handed\r\nprotection of their Government.\r\nI want to recognize the efforts of United Nations\r\nagencies and non-governmental organizations \r\nincluding Irish organizations such as GOAL, Concern\r\nand Trócaire  that responded so quickly and\r\ngenerously to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. The\r\ndedication of humanitarian aid workers must also be\r\napplauded.\r\nThe humanitarian needs in Darfur still remain\r\nimmense. I appeal for continued support from the\r\ninternational community to meet the funding shortfall.\r\nIreland has contributed almost 6 million in\r\nGovernment-funded aid so far this year to assist the\r\nhumanitarian effort there through United Nations\r\nagencies as well as through Irish and international non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. The Irish people have\r\nbeen greatly moved by the suffering in Darfur and have\r\nbeen generous in providing additional, non-government\r\nfinancial support for the relief effort.\r\nI also wish to pay tribute to the leadership of the\r\nSecretary-General in insisting on an appropriate\r\nresponse from the Security Council. I welcome the\r\nrecent adoption by the Security Council of resolution\r\n1564 (2004), although it is a matter of regret and\r\nbewilderment to many that the resolution did not\r\nreceive the unanimous backing of Council members. I\r\nhope that the Council will now unite in seeking to\r\nassert its will and bring an end to a situation that is an\r\naffront to humanity.\r\nI urge the authorities in the Sudan to fulfil, with\r\nthe utmost urgency, the obligations that have been\r\nimposed on them by the Security Council. They must\r\ncooperate closely with the monitors deployed by the\r\nAfrican Union. They must ensure that the Janjaweed\r\nmilitia are brought under control and disarmed and that\r\npersons responsible for crimes and serious violations of\r\nhuman rights are brought to justice. And they must\r\nensure that secure conditions are restored so that\r\npeople can return voluntarily to their homes. I also\r\nurge all parties in the Abuja talks, including the rebel\r\ngroups, to show flexibility and goodwill so that the\r\nunderlying problems of Darfur can be resolved in a\r\npeaceful manner.\r\nOnce again, we meet in the General Assembly\r\nHall under the shadow of terrorism. The recent\r\nappalling images from Beslan provide a further\r\nemphatic demonstration of the moral bankruptcy of\r\nterrorism. The fact that those attacks targeted innocent\r\nchildren, along with the consequent trauma caused to\r\nchildren worldwide who saw the torn bodies of the\r\nchildren and mothers of Beslan on their television\r\nscreens, make them all the more heinous. They\r\nreinforce, if reinforcement were needed, the absolute\r\nduty of Member States of the United Nations to\r\ncooperate effectively in identifying and bringing to\r\njustice those who plan, direct, finance, facilitate and\r\ncarry out terrorist acts.\r\nTerrorist acts are always reprehensible, and those\r\nwho carry them out bear full responsibility for them.\r\nThat is true irrespective of any underlying factors that\r\nmight exist, such as national or civil conflict or\r\noppressive economic or social conditions. We must\r\nshow determination to confront and face down\r\nterrorists when they test our resolve through their\r\ninvolvement in heinous acts of violence designed to\r\nterrorize the public into conceding to their distorted\r\nview of the world. But we also have to be smart to win.\r\nTerrorism can rarely be defeated by exclusively\r\nmilitary or security means, although those means are\r\nobviously a very necessary component in the fight\r\n39\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nagainst terrorism. It is necessary, at the same time, to\r\naddress the root causes of terrorism. I made that point\r\nwhen I addressed the General Assembly in the\r\naftermath of the atrocities of 11 September, and I make\r\nno apologies for repeating it today. Let there be no\r\nmisunderstanding. I offer no excuses for terrorism.\r\nTerrorism is evil. But it is my strong belief that people\r\nare not born evil. At a certain point in their lives,\r\nsomething  perhaps a particular event or the\r\nexperience of indoctrination  causes them to embrace\r\nevil. To seek to address that root cause is not to be soft\r\non terrorism, it is the intelligent way to attack\r\nterrorism.\r\nTerrorism tests the effectiveness of our national\r\nand collective security systems, but it also tests the\r\nquality of our institutions, including our systems of\r\njustice, and the strength of our values. As we seek to\r\nprotect ourselves, we must ensure that those\r\ninstitutions remain strong, that democratic values are\r\nnot undermined, that our systems of justice are not\r\ncompromised and that our struggle is conducted in full\r\nrespect for international law and human rights norms.\r\nIf we fail to do that, any success we achieve over\r\nterrorists will be at the expense of the way of life we\r\nseek to protect.\r\nThe people of Israel and Palestine continue to\r\nsuffer from violence that is as futile as it is tragic. The\r\nroot cause of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a struggle\r\nover land. The land must be shared by agreement\r\narrived at through negotiation between the parties to\r\nthe conflict. The continuing unilateral expansion of\r\nsettlements and the construction and maintenance of\r\nthe separation barrier on the West Bank will make the\r\nconflict more difficult to resolve. The entire international\r\ncommunity  particularly Israels friends  need to\r\nsend that clear and unambiguous message to the Israeli\r\nGovernment and the people of Israel.\r\nIreland acknowledges the right, indeed the\r\nresponsibility, of the Israeli Government to protect its\r\npeople, including, if it so wishes, by a security fence\r\nalong its recognized borders. However, the building of\r\nthe fence in the West Bank serves to divide Palestinian\r\ncommunities and creates severe hardship for them. It\r\nwill also serve to perpetuate the so-called facts on the\r\nground, and make it more difficult to reach a final\r\nsettlement. The advisory opinion of the International\r\nCourt of Justice has given clear guidance on the fence\r\nthat should be given careful consideration by those\r\nwhose policies and actions it addresses.\r\nThe Palestinian Authority must also assume its\r\nresponsibilities under the road map, notwithstanding\r\nthe difficulties it faces. Effective and responsible\r\nleadership is required. The Palestinian people can best\r\nachieve their sovereignty by restoring national\r\ndiscipline and rejecting the path of violence.\r\nIreland, in common with its EU partners,\r\ncontinues to believe that the only way to reach a\r\ncomprehensive settlement of the conflict is through the\r\nQuartet road map. In the Tullamore Declaration, issued\r\nduring Irelands recent presidency of the European\r\nUnion, EU ministers welcomed the expressed intention\r\nof Prime Minister Sharon to withdraw from Gaza and\r\nacknowledged the impetus that such a withdrawal\r\ncould give to the peace process, as long as it met\r\ncertain conditions, including that it take place in the\r\ncontext of the implementation of the road map.\r\nI therefore urge Israel and the Palestinian\r\nAuthority to cooperate closely with the Quartet to\r\nensure that the withdrawal from Gaza is accompanied\r\nby the full and effective assumption by the Palestinian\r\nAuthority of its responsibilities in the territory, and that\r\na momentum towards the full implementation of the\r\nroad map is developed.\r\nThe passage of Security Council resolution 1546\r\n(2004) and the subsequent establishment of the Interim\r\nGovernment of Iraq, represented a crucial coming\r\ntogether by the international community on the\r\nimportance of reconstruction in Iraq. It is vital that that\r\nGovernment should be able to move ahead and\r\nestablish a full democratic mandate. However, the\r\nsecurity situation in Iraq remains a matter of grave\r\nconcern to us all, and the challenges facing the new\r\nGovernment are great. An end to the lethal violence\r\nthat is disrupting the normal development of that\r\ncountry is essential.\r\nIreland has always seen the role of the United\r\nNations as central to the issue of reconstructing Iraq.\r\nWe therefore welcome the forthcoming return of the\r\nUnited Nations mission. Ireland and its EU partners\r\nwill seek to ensure that that mission is provided with\r\nthe necessary security to allow it to carry out its\r\nfunctions.\r\nThe Irish and British Governments continue to\r\nwork in close partnership to consolidate peace and\r\npolitical stability in Northern Ireland. Since the Good\r\nFriday Agreement of 1998, considerable progress has\r\nbeen made in improving and normalizing life in\r\n40\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nNorthern Ireland. In our view, the complete\r\nimplementation of the Good Friday Agreement remains\r\ndefinitively the best way forward.\r\nThe elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly\r\nlast November gave leadership mandates to the Sinn\r\nFein party and the Democratic Unionist Party in their\r\nrespective nationalist and unionist communities. Since\r\nthen, both Governments have engaged in intensive\r\ndiscussions with all the parties to finally resolve the\r\nkey issues of confidence that have thus far frustrated\r\nthe full achievement of peace and political stability in\r\nNorthern Ireland. Those key issues include ending\r\nparamilitary activity in all its forms; completing the\r\nprocess of decommissioning Irish Republican Army\r\nweapons; the implementation by the British\r\nGovernment of the agreed programme of normalization\r\nand demilitarization; ensuring that the new policing\r\nservice is supported by all sections of the community\r\nand resolving the related issue of the devolution of\r\njustice and policing powers; and obtaining\r\ncommitments from all parties to fully participate in the\r\ninstitutions of the Agreement.\r\nThose were the issues that were addressed in\r\nthree days of intensive talks that were convened by\r\nboth Governments in Leeds Castle in England last\r\nweek. Substantial progress was made in the talks\r\nregarding the issues of paramilitarism and arms\r\ndecommissioning. As Prime Minister Blair said after\r\nthe talks, the contours of the paramilitary question are\r\nnow in sight of being resolved, to be accompanied by\r\nsubsequent demilitarization, as agreed in the joint\r\ndeclaration issued by the British and Irish\r\nGovernments last October. In addition, significant\r\nprogress was made with regard to the policing issue\r\nand the devolution of those powers to devolved\r\ninstitutions in Northern Ireland.\r\nRegrettably, it was not possible to achieve\r\nagreement among the parties themselves on the\r\nquestion of the operation of the political institutions of\r\nthe Agreement. Talks are continuing in Belfast this\r\nweek to see if the gaps between the parties on that\r\nissue can be resolved. The gaps are narrow and can,\r\nand must, be overcome at the earliest possible date. It\r\nwas noteworthy in that regard that the leader of the\r\nDemocratic Unionist Party, Mr. Ian Paisley, made the\r\npoint immediately after the talks that a golden\r\nopportunity has been available to realize a stable and\r\nentirely peaceful future. For our part, the Irish\r\nGovernment is open to considering changes that would\r\nimprove the workings of the institutions while\r\nmaintaining compliance with the fundamentals of the\r\nAgreement, and we have brought forward proposals in\r\nthat regard. But, I reiterate, as the Taoiseach emphasized\r\nlast weekend, such changes must not disturb the\r\nfundamental balance of the Good Friday Agreement, in\r\nparticular its key power-sharing provisions.\r\nThe resolution of those institutional questions\r\nwould allow both Governments to bring forward a\r\ncomprehensive package providing a template for\r\npolitical stability in Northern Ireland. It would be a\r\ntragedy if the failure to bridge the remaining gaps on\r\nthat institutional matter frustrated the goal of\r\ndefinitively removing the issue of arms from politics in\r\nNorthern Ireland. The people, rightly, would not\r\nunderstand why that long-awaited prize was denied\r\nbecause of a reluctance to fully embrace the structures\r\nof partnership and power-sharing.\r\nIf, on the other hand, those institutional issues\r\ncan be resolved and a comprehensive agreement then\r\nbrought forward, we can finally liberate partnership\r\npolitics in Northern Ireland and allow its committed\r\nand talented politicians  from all sides of the\r\ncommunity  to collectively get on with the job of\r\nproviding better governance, a prospering economy\r\nand a fair society for all of the people.\r\nI will conclude where I began, on the need to\r\nrededicate ourselves to the reinvigoration of this great\r\nOrganization.\r\nNext year will be a year in which important\r\ndecisions on the future of the United Nations must be\r\ntaken. We need to rededicate ourselves to the principles\r\nand purposes for which this Organization was founded.\r\nWe need to restore the sense of ambition and idealism\r\nthat illuminated the United Nations at its inception. We\r\nneed, above all, to build an Organization that is results-\r\noriented and that can demonstrate that politics is the\r\nmost effective means of resolving conflict. Let us make\r\n2005 the year in which the United Nations is reborn\r\nstrong, effective and respected, as the founding fathers\r\nintended it to be.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Mustafa Osman\r\nIsmail, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\r\nthe Sudan.\r\nMr. Ismail (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It gives me\r\npleasure to extend my delegations sincere\r\n41\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Jean Ping on his deserved\r\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-ninth session of\r\nthe General Assembly. Given the issues that we must\r\nconsider during this session, and in view of the\r\nimportant tasks we must face in the coming year, we\r\nparticularly welcome the Presidents experience and\r\nskills, which are familiar to us in the African arena.\r\nWe would also like to extend our thanks and\r\nappreciation to Mr. Julian R. Hunte, the outgoing\r\nPresident, for the great efforts he made in conducting\r\nthe work of the Assembly, as well as to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for leading the work of the Organization.\r\nLast year from this rostrum I stated that\r\nnegotiations between the Government and the Sudan\r\nPeoples Liberation Movement/Army, under the\r\nauspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on\r\nDevelopment (IGAD) and Kenyas chairmanship, and\r\nwith the support of the IGAD partners, had made great\r\nprogress and peace had become imminent. I am glad to\r\nsay that the last round of negotiations resulted in the\r\nsigning, in the first week of June 2004, of six protocols\r\ndealing with security arrangements, cessation of\r\nhostilities, distribution of wealth, power-sharing and\r\nthe conflict in the Nubian mountains region, the Blue\r\nNile and Abiai. We decided to hold the last round of\r\nnegotiations on 7 October 2004 to complete the details\r\nof a comprehensive peace, which will, it is hoped, be\r\nsigned at the end of this year.\r\nWe stand on the threshold of peace. The new\r\nchallenge before us now is to overcome the differences\r\nof the past, start reconstruction and rehabilitation,\r\nconcentrate on development and strengthen the pillars\r\nof peace and national unity on the basis of\r\ncompatriotism and equality of rights and duties. For\r\nthat reason, my Government declares its firm intention\r\nof conducting a national dialogue with all political\r\nforces, inside and outside the Sudan, in order to make\r\npeace a national objective that can be achieved through\r\na national charter.\r\nIt also gives me pleasure to say that in addition to\r\nthe talks in Naivasha and Abuja my Government\r\nstarted a third forum in Cairo, under the auspices of the\r\nEgyptian Government, to engage in dialogue with\r\nfactions of the national opposition, headquartered in\r\nAsmara.\r\nBecause war has devastated all sectors of the\r\ncountry, reconstruction efforts are especially difficult.\r\nWe would like to express our appreciation to the\r\ninternational community for the humanitarian assistance\r\nthey provided during the war. We now appeal to the\r\ninternational community to help in the reconstruction\r\nprocess: to ameliorate the living conditions in the areas\r\ndevastated by war all over the Sudan; to aid in the\r\nresettlement of internally displaced persons and\r\nrefugees; and to participate in development projects in\r\norder to achieve peace and stability.\r\nWe were at the threshold of peace in the south\r\nwhen another war broke out in Darfur as the result of a\r\nrebel movement begun by some tribes and supported\r\nby foreign forces. The rebel movements terrorist\r\naction was not directed against the Government only,\r\nbut against those tribes that refused to join them. That,\r\nin turn, pushed those tribes to train and arm militias to\r\ndefend themselves against the rebels. The rebel\r\nmovement targeted the security apparatus, sowing\r\ndeath and destruction, which led to the release of criminal\r\nJanjaweed groups from prisons. The aggression continued\r\nagainst civilians and Government institutions.\r\nThe root causes of Darfur go back to conflicts\r\namong the tribal communities in the region. Previously,\r\nthose conflicts were settled according to traditional\r\ncustoms and norms. But the growth in population and\r\nthe number of livestock, coupled with a decrease in the\r\nwater supply owing to desertification, led to tense\r\nstruggles between grazing land tribes and farmers.\r\nThere were other causes for regional conflict: an influx\r\nof arms and the interference of neighbouring countries\r\nthat tried to exploit the tense situation, encouraging\r\nrebellions against the Government by training and\r\narming certain groups.\r\nThe present conflict in Darfur started in March\r\n2003, when rebels started inciting dissension and strife,\r\nattacking highways, plundering livestock and taking\r\ninternational relief workers as hostages. The\r\nGovernment tried to convince them to abandon military\r\naction, but they insisted on occupying cities and\r\nvillages and terrorizing tribes, forcing them into armed\r\nservice. Everyone had to carry weapons for self-\r\ndefence. Then, the Government intervened to try to\r\nhalt the hostilities, impose law and order and prevent\r\ncivil war.\r\nThis conflict, which was imposed on the\r\nGovernment, has created extremely complicated and\r\ndire humanitarian conditions. The Government took the\r\nnecessary measures. It sent food relief to Darfur. Next,\r\nit eliminated all the administrative, legal and technical\r\n42\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\narrangements that impeded relief work, it allowed\r\nrelief organizations to enter Darfur unimpeded, and it\r\ncurtailed certain regulations, such as visa requirements,\r\nin order to provide protection to camps of displaced\r\npersons. The Government deployed police and\r\nreopened legal offices destroyed by the rebels. The\r\nprocess of bringing all of those accused of violating\r\nhuman rights to justice began. Furthermore, the\r\nGovernment cooperated with the international\r\ncommunity by signing a joint communiqué with the\r\nSecretary-General that includes a number of measures\r\nto deal with the situation in Darfur and, together with\r\nJan Pronk, Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the Sudan, I headed a Joint Implementation\r\nMechanism mission to the area.\r\nFurthermore, out of its belief in a peaceful\r\nsettlement as a strategic choice, the Government\r\nentered into negotiations with the rebels under the\r\nauspices of the President of Chad, which culminated in\r\nthe Abashi agreement in 2003, but that agreement was\r\nlater violated by the rebels. However, this did not\r\nweaken the Governments resolve to continue its\r\nefforts, until we attained the ceasefire agreement in\r\nNDjamena. In order to cooperate with the African\r\nUnion, we sent a high-level delegation to the first\r\nround of negotiations at Addis Ababa; our delegation\r\nwas given full authority to reach a peaceful settlement\r\nwith the rebels. But the rebels boycotted the talks.\r\nThe Government redoubled its efforts at all\r\nlevels  political, security and humanitarian  out of\r\nits responsibility for the people, and it cooperated fully\r\nwith the United Nations so as to implement the\r\nagreement that had been reached with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. Then, on 30 July 2004, the Security Council\r\nadopted resolution 1556 (2004), which gave the\r\nGovernment only one month to deal with the problem\r\nand threatened the imposition of sanctions. It is\r\nregrettable that this resolution sent an erroneous\r\nmessage, thus encouraging the rebels to give up\r\nnegotiations with good intention. They insisted on\r\nconditions that were impossible to implement. And this\r\nled to the collapse of negotiations in Addis Ababa, in\r\nspite of the African Unions great efforts.\r\nNotwithstanding the faults and impracticality of\r\nthis Security Council resolution, my Government,\r\nabiding by its international legitimacy and\r\nresponsibility for its people, will continue to do its\r\nutmost to find the shortest way for the return of peace,\r\nstability and security to Darfur. My Government signed\r\na working plan for Darfur with the United Nations; this\r\nplan included detailed arrangements for humanitarian\r\naid, security and protection of displaced persons and\r\ntheir voluntary return. We assigned extra police forces,\r\nnumbering 10,000. We also signed an agreement with\r\nthe International Organization for Migration on the\r\nreturn of refugees.\r\nWithin the framework of a political settlement,\r\nand despite the intransigence and lack of seriousness of\r\nthe rebels, my Government accepted the invitation\r\nextended by President Obasanjo of Nigeria, the current\r\nChairman of the African Union. We then sent another\r\nhigh-ranking delegation to Abuja on 23 August out of\r\nour belief in the political settlement as a strategic\r\noption. As it happened in the Addis Ababa\r\nnegotiations, the Security Council adopted its\r\nresolution 1564 (2004) last Saturday, 18 September,\r\nwhich gave more incentive to the rebels and sent them\r\nan erroneous message to continue their intransigence.\r\nThis led to the failure of the negotiations.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1564 (2004) did not\r\nconsider my Governments efforts to contain the\r\nhumanitarian crisis in Darfur, which led to détente in\r\nthe situation. It did not pay attention to my\r\nGovernments warning about the negative impact of\r\nany measures that would hamper the efforts made by\r\nthe African Union for the peaceful settlement of the\r\nquestion of Darfur.\r\nWe call upon the international community to\r\nprovide assistance to the needy population in Darfur.\r\nAt the same time, we ask for support and promotion of\r\nthe African Unions efforts and that the situation on the\r\nground not be further complicated or the Unions\r\nefforts undermined.\r\nBelieving in our own principles, our sense of\r\nresponsibility and the attention my Government\r\nattaches to human rights questions, we have cooperated\r\nwith international and voluntary organizations for the\r\ndevelopment and enhancement of human rights in my\r\ncountry. We have ratified this year the African\r\nChildrens Initiative and, over the past months, we\r\nhave received some independent experts and special\r\nrapporteurs sent by the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In\r\ncooperation with OHCHR, we have deployed a team of\r\nhuman rights observers in Darfur. Sudans doors will\r\nbe open for all those who want to know the truth. We\r\nhave nothing to hide. Our efforts were not limited to\r\n43\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\ncooperating with the international community. We have\r\ntaken some measures at the local level, and we have\r\nestablished a national independent committee to\r\ninvestigate allegations of human rights violations in\r\nDarfur. Also, there are other committees to investigate\r\nthe other claims of rape in the Darfur region besides\r\nour efforts to provide protection, peace and security to\r\nour citizens.\r\nSince the beginning of the crisis, my Government\r\nhas not hesitated to recognize that there has been a\r\nhumanitarian problem in Darfur and a security problem\r\nthat ought to be dealt with through a comprehensive\r\npolitical solution, despite the fact that the rebel\r\nmovement led to this problem by starting violence and\r\nfighting. Then we resorted to the international\r\ncommunity in general and the African Union and the\r\nLeague of Arab States in particular.\r\nWe hope that the international community,\r\nespecially the Security Council, will cooperate with us\r\nto find a solution instead of issuing threats and\r\ncondemnations. The last Security Council resolution is\r\na living example of such threats.\r\nWe welcome the international communitys\r\ninvestigation of the Darfur violations. As I said, we\r\nhave nothing to hide. What we all want from the\r\nSecretary-General, who is responsible for the\r\nestablishment of this committee, and from the Security\r\nCouncil is confirmation of the credibility of the\r\ninternational organization so that this international\r\ncommittee would be neutral and professional. We do\r\nnot want a committee like that headed by Richard\r\nButler, who prepared his report at another location\r\nwhere it was signed and submitted to the Security\r\nCouncil indicating that it represented the position of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nWe hope that the voices of those who took certain\r\npositions regarding Darfur will be silent until the\r\ninternational committees report is issued. We face a\r\nvery delicate situation and developments in the world\r\ntoday, and we need to face such challenges by\r\ngarnering the political will to enhance the role of the\r\nUnited Nations and its agencies in order to carry out\r\ntheir functions within the framework of a real\r\ndemocracy that would express the interests and hopes\r\nof all peoples and confront the challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nWe must accelerate our current efforts that have\r\nbeen going on for a decade now for Security Council\r\nreform and to develop its methods of work. The body\r\nthat is responsible for international peace and security\r\nis composed of permanent members, whose monopoly\r\nof the veto reflects a great imbalance over the simplest\r\ncriteria of justice. Among the five permanent\r\nMembers, there are three from one geographical group;\r\ntwo of them are from Western Europe. There is no\r\nrepresentation whatsoever for entire continents, such as\r\nAfrica or Latin America, and vast regions of Asia.\r\nTherefore, any discussion about submitting another\r\ncandidate from Western Europe before taking these\r\ncontinents into consideration would be a consecration\r\nof this imbalanced equation and of the Wests\r\nhegemony over the affairs of this Organization.\r\nTerrorism and extremism are among the\r\nchallenges facing the world today. We declare our total\r\nrejection and condemnation of this destructive\r\nphenomenon; but at the same time there is an\r\nunacceptable misunderstanding and confusion between\r\nterrorism and the struggles of people to achieve their\r\nindependence and to rid themselves of foreign\r\noccupation. This misunderstanding culminates in the\r\nextreme when terrorism is linked to followers of a\r\ncertain religion or culture. Terrorism has no religion or\r\nhomeland. We stand with the international community\r\nand cooperate with it in its fight to eliminate terrorism,\r\nand we call for an international agreement on a\r\ndefinition of terrorism and to find the best means to\r\nface this plague through collective efforts.\r\nThe gap between the rich and poor countries is\r\nwidening within a system of globalization that further\r\nenriches the wealthy and impoverishes the poor. It has\r\nbecome an obstacle for the international community\r\nand the aspirations to a free and dignified life of\r\nbillions of people in developing countries. The\r\nimbalance in todays world economy and free trade is\r\nobvious. It will have an adverse effect not only on the\r\ndeveloping countries but will lead also to total\r\ncatastrophe in the whole world. We need to have\r\npolitical resolve, as stated by world leaders in the\r\nMillennium Declaration four years ago, and later at\r\nMonterrey and Johannesburg.\r\nDeveloping and least developed countries are still\r\nsuffering from hunger and poverty.\r\nLet us renew hope for the hundreds of millions of\r\npoor and hungry people by translating that political\r\nwill into concrete action in order to provide them with\r\neducation and drinking water and to eliminate hunger,\r\n44\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\ndestitution and disease by focusing on the goals and\r\nprogrammes that we have repeatedly agreed on. In this\r\nconnection, we would like to pay tribute to the\r\ninternational initiative on the new Action Against\r\nHunger and Poverty.\r\nIsraels oppressive policies against unarmed\r\nPalestinian people, the imposition of closures on\r\noccupied Palestinian land, the extrajudicial crimes\r\ncommitted there, the demolition of houses, the\r\nstarvation and intimidation, the increased settlement\r\nactivities and the besieging of the Palestinian President\r\nall require that the international community bring\r\npressure to bear on Israel to stop those acts. The Sudan\r\nwelcomes the advisory opinion of the International\r\nCourt of Justice on the illegality of the separation wall\r\nand on compensation for all losses caused by it. We\r\nwelcome resolution ES-10/15, adopted by the General\r\nAssembly at its tenth emergency session, on 20 July\r\n2004, demanding that Israel abide by that opinion. An\r\ninternational, comprehensive and just peace in the\r\nMiddle East will be reached only when Israel\r\nwithdraws from all occupied Arab lands, including the\r\nSyrian Golan Heights and the Lebanese Shalia farms.\r\nThere will be no peace or stability until the Palestinian\r\npeople recover their legitimate rights, including their\r\nright to establish an independent Palestinian State with\r\nJerusalem as its capital and the right of refugees to\r\nreturn to their lands.\r\nThe difficult situation facing the Iraqi people\r\nmakes it necessary to assist them to overcome their\r\nproblems. Here we reaffirm the unity and independence\r\nof the Iraqi people and their right to self-determination.\r\nWe hope that the restoration of those rights will lead to\r\nsecurity and stability and to a return to normality in\r\nIraq and that it will enable the Iraqi people to exercise\r\ntheir right to choose their own political leadership\r\nthrough free and fair elections. We call upon the\r\ninternational community to support the Iraqi\r\nprovisional Government, to help in the reconstruction\r\nof Iraq and to support any initiative that would enable\r\nthe Iraqis to live in dignity in their own country.\r\nOur efforts complement those efforts of the\r\nAfrican Union to achieve stability and development in\r\nour continent, a continent so rich natural and human\r\nresources and capabilities. We have resolved to settle\r\nour conflicts and crises, which squander such resources\r\nand capabilities, and to work instead to promote\r\neconomic and social development through the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development (NEPAD).\r\nIn conclusion, we reaffirm our determination to\r\nachieve a comprehensive and just peace that would\r\nlead to stability and well-being for the people of the\r\nSudan and would bolster African Union efforts towards\r\neconomic and social integrity. We look forward to the\r\nUnited Nations playing its role in establishing justice\r\nin international relations based on understanding,\r\ncooperation and mutual interests and avoiding\r\nconfrontation and sanctions, which have proven to be\r\nharmful to people.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to Mr. Per Stig Moeller, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Denmark.\r\nMr. Moeller (Denmark): When we met a year\r\nago, there was widespread concern that we had reached\r\nan impasse that threatened to paralyse the United\r\nNations. I am happy to note today that this looming\r\nthreat of division is receding and is being replaced by a\r\nrenewed commitment to multilateralism.\r\nIn that spirit, Denmark welcomes the Security\r\nCouncils unanimous adoption of its resolution 1546\r\n(2004), on Iraq. The resolution is, first and foremost, of\r\ngreat significance for the prospects of peace and\r\nstability in Iraq and throughout the region. It is also of\r\ngreat importance for the Security Councils ability to\r\nperform its role as the custodian of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nThe United Nations must play a leading role in\r\nthe political process and in the reconstruction of Iraq.\r\nThe wisdom and skill of the Secretary-General and his\r\nSpecial Adviser have advanced this process, and we\r\nhope that the advisory role of the United Nations will\r\nbe further enhanced. We urge all Member States to\r\nsupport the interim Government of Iraq in its\r\nendeavours to establish peace and security in Iraq.\r\nThe year 2005 will be the year in which Member\r\nStates willingness to work towards a strong, united\r\nand effective United Nations will be tested. The\r\nchallenge is to develop credible, effective and\r\ncomprehensive United Nations responses to the threats\r\nand challenges of the new millennium, whether they be\r\nconflict prevention, conflict resolution and peace-\r\nbuilding, or the fight against terrorism and the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, or\r\nrespect for human rights and international law, last but\r\ncertainly not least, the enormous challenge of\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals.\r\n45\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nDenmark strongly supports the Secretary-Generals\r\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change and\r\nlooks forward to its report later this year. Efforts to reform\r\nthe Organization, including enlarging the membership of\r\nthe Security Council, must continue if the United\r\nNations is to meet the new challenges. Democracy is\r\nalso a question of representation, and if large parts of\r\nthe world do not feel represented in the Security\r\nCouncil there is a risk that they will not feel bound by\r\nits decisions. The Security Council must reflect the\r\nrealities of the world of today, not those of the past.\r\nWe live in a world in which the distinction\r\nbetween military and non-military threats is\r\nincreasingly blurred. Most current threats are complex\r\nand combine elements of both. Creating synergies\r\namong development, political and security components\r\nwill be the key to the success of the United Nations.\r\nDenmark will endeavour to assist in this process across\r\nthe full range of United Nations activities.\r\nDenmark is a candidate for election to the\r\nSecurity Council during this session of the General\r\nAssembly. If elected, the focus of Denmarks tenure in\r\nthe Council will be to seek new and more effective\r\nways of integrating security and development and\r\nstrengthening international law. In that connection, I\r\nwelcome the Secretary-Generals important opening\r\nstatement in this debate (see A/59/PV.3), in which he\r\noutlined the fundamental principles for a world order\r\nbased on international law.\r\nGreater coherence is needed in international\r\npeace operations. We firmly believe that the United\r\nNations needs to give civilian crisis management the\r\nsame priority that is accorded to military crisis\r\nmanagement. More than 40 per cent of countries\r\nemerging from conflict slide back into conflict. In\r\norder to build sustainable peace, much more attention\r\nneeds to be given to the civilian aspects of crisis\r\nmanagement. This includes the demobilization and\r\nreintegration of combatants as well as the social,\r\neconomic and legal reconstruction of war-torn societies.\r\nWe must make State-building a central goal of\r\nconflict management and peace-building, alongside the\r\nprovision of basic security. Whatever mechanism we\r\nset up, the challenge is to ensure the involvement of all\r\nstakeholders. That includes national Governments, the\r\nSecretariat, United Nations development funds and\r\nprogrammes, the Bretton Woods institutions, regional\r\norganizations and bilateral donors.\r\nIn order to improve compliance with Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, the process towards targeted and\r\nsmarter sanctions should be continued. The challenge\r\nis twofold. First, the Security Council must rigorously\r\nimplement its resolutions, including when they\r\nstipulate serious consequences in case of non-\r\ncompliance. Secondly, the countries concerned must be\r\ngiven positive incentives to comply with those\r\nresolutions.\r\nTerrorism and the proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction are serious threats to peace and\r\nsecurity and impede progress towards stability and\r\nprosperity. Terrorists threaten the everyday life and\r\nvalues of millions of innocent individuals. Terrorists\r\nmust be stopped by hard power and by soft power to\r\nprevent decades of unrest and terror.\r\nCountering new threats requires a multifaceted,\r\nintegrated response by the United Nations and its\r\npartners. Success demands synergy, a finely tuned mix\r\nof diplomacy, aid, police efforts, intelligence, legal\r\nassistance and  if need be  military power. The\r\nUnited Nations must take a leading role in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism, providing both the framework for\r\nglobal efforts and the legitimacy for collective action.\r\nTerror must not lead to isolation; it must not stop\r\nglobalization. In the world of today, huge global\r\ndisparities in resources have become apparent to\r\neverybody. Social and economic exclusion, as well as\r\ndeficient democracies, the absence of the rule of law\r\nand lack of respect for human rights, contribute to\r\npolitical radicalization and religious extremism.\r\nEnsuring that new generations have access to the\r\nbenefits of globalization  such as democracy and\r\nhope for a better future  is a global challenge.\r\nThe main responsibility for fighting terrorism lies\r\nwith individual States. This includes compliance with\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, as well as\r\nratification and implementation of the 12 United\r\nNations conventions against terrorism. Denmark\r\nsupports efforts to reinvigorate the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee (CTC). We support efforts to renew and\r\nupgrade the offer of technical assistance to countries\r\nthat need it. The work of the CTC must be better\r\nfocused and linked with the assistance extended to\r\ncountries that have the will  but lack the means  to\r\nmeet the requirements of Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001).\r\n46\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nJust as important, we must strengthen\r\ninternational agreements to prevent the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. Denmark therefore\r\nsupports Security Council resolution 1540 (2004), and\r\nlooks forward to its full implementation.\r\nThe United Nations has been instrumental in\r\nestablishing the core international human rights\r\nconventions. This year we are celebrating the twenty-\r\nfifth anniversary of one of those conventions  the\r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women. The importance of the\r\nelimination of discrimination against women and of\r\nensuring respect for the right of women to decide\r\nfreely over their own lives  including in matters\r\nrelating to marriage, reproductive health and\r\nHIV/AIDS  is self-evident. This main message of the\r\nCairo Programme of Action, adopted 10 years ago, is\r\nas relevant today as ever.\r\nWith a view to eradicating torture, Denmark calls\r\nupon all States to sign and ratify the Optional Protocol\r\nto the Convention against Torture, so that it can enter\r\ninto force at an early date.\r\nWe are now in the era of implementation of those\r\nhuman rights commitments that have been undertaken.\r\nAs the main body in its field, the Commission on\r\nHuman Rights has a crucial role to play in this respect\r\nand should be further strengthened.\r\n2005 will be a defining moment for the United\r\nNations. World leaders will meet in New York to take\r\nstock of progress in the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration. That meeting will provide a\r\nunique opportunity to break new ground, push ahead\r\nwith the interlinked agenda of peace, security and\r\ndevelopment and follow up the recommendations of\r\nthe High-level Panel.\r\nA key priority for Denmark will be to speed up\r\nthe implementation of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. The results so far are not sufficiently\r\nencouraging  especially with regard to Africa.\r\nDenmark attaches the highest priority to Africas\r\ndevelopment and would like the situation there and its\r\nprospects to be high on the agenda at the 2005 summit.\r\nIn order to reach the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, an effective partnership will be required\r\nbetween developed and developing countries. The gap\r\nbetween goals and resources must be closed. We are\r\ndeeply concerned about the inadequacy of the current\r\nlevel of development financing. Further resources are\r\nneeded, as is better coordination in their allocation.\r\nLast year, Denmark took the lead in making our\r\ncommitments transparent in a Millennium Development\r\nGoals report. A new report will be published next\r\nmonth. We call on all other States to do likewise.\r\nDevelopment efforts and conflict resolution in\r\nAfrica must go hand in hand. Progress achieved in\r\neconomic and social development will be sustainable\r\nonly if we manage to put an end to conflict on the\r\nAfrican continent. We stand ready to support the\r\nsignificant and sustained efforts undertaken by the\r\nAfricans themselves in this regard. There is a need to\r\nfurther strengthen the African security architecture in\r\ncooperation with the African Union, subregional\r\nAfrican organizations, the United Nations, the\r\nEuropean Union and Governments acting bilaterally.\r\nWe also need to strengthen the regional approaches of\r\nthe United Nations in the field. Denmark stands ready\r\nto contribute actively.\r\nFurthermore, recent natural disasters illustrate the\r\nimportance of dealing with international environmental\r\nissues such as climate change, biodiversity,\r\ndeforestation and desertification.\r\nThe Secretary-General has shown great\r\nleadership in pressing for strengthened and effective\r\nmultilateralism, and things are slowly starting to come\r\ntogether. Our common voyage will not be over with the\r\n2005 summit  far from it. The High-level Panels\r\nreport, a renewed focus on post-conflict intervention, and\r\nthe implementation of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals can herald a new age of strong and effective\r\nmultilateralism if, collectively, we rise to the challenge.\r\nThe task of this generation is to hand the world to\r\nthe next generation in better shape than we received it.\r\nDenmark will spare no effort in its endeavours to\r\ntranslate that vision into reality.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Solomon Passy,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria.\r\nMr. Passy (spoke in French): I would like, on\r\nbehalf of Bulgaria, to offer my sincere congratulations\r\nto Mr. Jean Ping on his assumption of the presidency\r\n a position of great responsibility. Given his great\r\nexperience in multilateral diplomacy, I sure that he will\r\nlead the deliberations of the fifty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to a successful outcome. I would\r\n47\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nalso like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the\r\nwork done by his predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, to\r\nreform and revitalize the Assembly.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThis is the first year that the Republic of Bulgaria\r\nhas taken part in the deliberations of the General\r\nAssembly as a full-fledged member of the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization and as a State which has successfully\r\nconcluded its negotiations on joining the European\r\nUnion. We are fully aware of the great responsibility\r\nwhich we bear this year in discharging our mandate as\r\nthe Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe. All those factors\r\nencourage Bulgaria to redouble its efforts in support of\r\nthe United Nations. We shall continue our efforts\r\naimed at strengthening the authority and role of the\r\nUnited Nations. We shall support the constructive\r\nproposals for reforms within the United Nations, which\r\nshould enhance its capacity and effectiveness.\r\nToday the United Nations faces new challenges,\r\nwhich require resolute joint action and coordination.\r\nThe United Nations and its bodies, as well as the\r\nspecialized institutions within its system, will continue\r\nto make an important contribution aimed at dealing\r\nwith extreme poverty and hunger, achieving\r\nsustainable development, containing and eliminating\r\nviolence and human rights abuses and affirming the\r\nrule of law, good governance and democratic values.\r\nInternational terrorism poses the most serious\r\nthreat to international peace and security. This requires\r\ncoordinated and resolute action by all States and the\r\nentire international community. Nothing can justify\r\nterrorist acts. It is essential that terrorists do not get\r\nhold of weapons of mass destruction nor distract us\r\nfrom our agenda, as outlined by the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nThis month the world remembers the victims of\r\nthe terrorist acts of 11 September, marking the\r\nanniversary of those tragic events. We all watched in\r\nhorror, anguish and anger the cold-blooded massacre of\r\ninnocent children and their parents in the school in\r\nBeslan. That is terrorism at its ugliest.\r\nBulgaria, too, is firmly convinced that\r\ninternational terrorism threatens all States and that it\r\ncan be dealt with only through joint efforts. It is for\r\nthat reason that the people and the Government of\r\nBulgaria have whole-heartedly supported our countrys\r\nactive participation in the global coalition against\r\nterrorism. We are committed to pursuing that policy\r\nsteadfastly, even though we have suffered human\r\nlosses and sustained damage.\r\nWithin the United Nations system, the Security\r\nCouncil and its Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC)\r\nare vested with the task of ensuring success in the fight\r\nagainst international terrorism. We share the view that\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1535 (2004) and the\r\ncreation of the new Counter-Terrorism Committee\r\nExecutive Directorate have improved coordination in\r\nthis field. The Al Qaeda and Taliban Committee,\r\nbeefed up in 2004 with the Monitoring Group and\r\nSanctions Enforcement Support Team, should also\r\ncontinue to wield its positive influence.\r\nWithin the framework of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Bulgaria\r\nhas been assisting in the joint initiatives of the CTC\r\nand OSCE and of the United Nations Office for Drug\r\nControl and Crime Prevention.\r\nThe OSCE has been involved in several countries\r\nin south-east Europe for many years now, and its\r\ncommitment to fostering peace and stability in the\r\nregion, through its field missions in Macedonia;\r\nCroatia; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Albania; Serbia and\r\nMontenegro; and Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro, has\r\nproved invaluable. Through activities such as\r\ninstitution- and capacity-building, promoting and\r\nsupporting legislative reform, respect for human rights,\r\nand  in cooperation with the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\r\nand other international actors  the repatriation of\r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons, the OSCE\r\nhas made clear its comparative advantage in the region.\r\nBut, while this work is essential, it cannot be done\r\neffectively without enhanced efforts by the international\r\ncommunity to address the regions lagging infrastructure.\r\nThe development of infrastructure and political\r\nstability must go hand in hand. The people of the\r\nregion are isolated from each other and from the rest of\r\nthe region. Indeed, it can take longer to fly from Sofia to\r\nTirana than to cross the Atlantic. There is a desperate\r\nneed for highways, railways and infrastructure\r\ncorridors to bring the people of the region closer\r\ntogether. Bulgaria knows from experience the\r\nimportance for the people of south-eastern Europe of\r\nhaving the prospect of full integration into mainstream\r\nEuropean political and economic structures.\r\n48\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nSustained efforts must be made by the\r\ninternational community to stimulate economic growth\r\nin that region and to offer young people in particular\r\ntangible hope for the future.\r\nBulgaria has always regarded the stability and\r\nsecurity of south-east Europe as one of its priorities.\r\nYet, in spite of the positive changes and the\r\nacceleration of the European and Euro-Atlantic\r\nintegration of the States in the region, the events that\r\ntook place in Kosovo last March revealed that serious\r\nrisks and latent threats still exist. Bulgaria supports the\r\nemergence of a democratic, multi-ethnic, multi-cultural\r\nand multi-religious society in Kosovo. We will\r\ncontinue to cooperate actively with the United Nations\r\nMission in Kosovo so that this aim can finally be\r\nattained.\r\nBulgaria is in favour of the full implementation\r\nof Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and its\r\nstandards before status policy. An agreement on\r\nthose standards, together with the forthcoming\r\nnegotiating process, will be decisive for Kosovos\r\nfuture. We welcome the Secretary-Generals initiatives,\r\nand in particular the comprehensive review of the\r\npolitical situation in Kosovo prepared by Ambassador\r\nKai Eide. We will continue to lend our active support\r\nto Mr. Soren Jessen-Petersen, the Secretary-Generals\r\nnewly appointed Special Representative. We hope that\r\nthe elections next month will prove to be an important\r\nstep forward in the context of the social and political\r\nprocesses under way and towards reaching a durable\r\nsolution to the Kosovo problem.\r\nBulgaria is firmly convinced that the United\r\nNations must play a key role in the stabilization and\r\nrestoration of Iraq, in the ongoing political and\r\nconstitutional process, based on Security Council\r\nresolution 1546 (2004), and in the preparations for\r\ndemocratic and free elections. We welcome the first\r\nsteps taken in Baghdad by Mr. Ashraf Qazi, the\r\nSecretary-Generals Special Representative, as well as\r\nthe mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission\r\nfor Iraq (UNAMI).\r\nThere have been encouraging developments in\r\nthe resolution of conflicts in certain hot spots in the\r\nworld, such as Sierra Leone and Timor-Leste. At the\r\nsame time, there are complicated situations in other\r\nregions, particularly in Africa. The situation in Darfur\r\nis of serious concern. Security Council resolution 1556\r\n(2004) and the recently adopted resolution 1564 (2004)\r\nmust be complied with in order to avoid a repetition of\r\nthe tragedy in other parts of the African continent, similar\r\nto the events that occurred during the last decade.\r\nDuring Bulgarias chairmanship of the OSCE, we\r\nhave been making concerted efforts to spur and further\r\ndevelop cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe OSCE. We have been encouraged by the Secretary-\r\nGenerals specific initiatives, aimed at improving the\r\nsynchronization of actions, communication and\r\nexchange of information with regional organizations.\r\nWe give very high marks to United Nations-OSCE\r\ncooperation in the western Balkans, the region of the\r\nCaucasus and in Central Asia.\r\nContemporary geopolitical realities require not\r\nonly cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOSCE, but also cooperation with the European Union,\r\nNATO, the Council of Europe, the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States and relevant international agencies.\r\nIn my view, closer interaction between them is of\r\ncrucial importance to security, stability, democratic\r\nprosperity and tolerance throughout the world.\r\nThe developments in Georgia have been followed\r\nwith close attention by the Bulgarian OSCE\r\nchairmanship. We have also been actively involved in\r\nefforts to avert possible crisis situations in the\r\nautonomous region of Ajaria. We note with satisfaction\r\nthe encouraging changes that have taken place in\r\nAzerbaijan and Tajikistan, including the decision of the\r\nPresident of Azerbaijan, announced in March, to\r\nrelease 129 prisoners, as well as the June decision by\r\nthe President and the Parliament of Tajikistan to\r\nimpose a moratorium on the death penalty.\r\nThe OSCE, through its outreach activities,\r\nattaches great importance to assisting the normalization\r\nof Afghanistan and its steady progress towards\r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights. We express\r\nour satisfaction at the fact that the OSCE will\r\ncontribute to the monitoring of elections in\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nIn adapting ourselves to current geopolitical\r\nrealities, we envisage building a bridge of confidence\r\nover the Black Sea  an endeavour which can lay the\r\ngroundwork for future security, cooperation and\r\ntolerance in Europe, in Asia and the rest of the world.\r\nWe are deeply convinced that the Black Sea dialogue is\r\nof special importance not only for participating nations\r\nbut also because it can set a positive example for other\r\nparts of the world.\r\n49\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nRespect for and observance of internationally\r\nrecognized standards of human rights by Member\r\nStates is a prerequisite both for their national security\r\nand for sustainable development. It is also a\r\nprerequisite for international peace and security. The\r\nprotection of basic human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms worldwide is a priority in the policy of the\r\nBulgarian Government. Our historical experience\r\nteaches us that, in the quest to achieve prosperity and\r\nsecurity in any society, it is necessary to have not only\r\nan adequate legal system and mechanisms for its\r\neffective implementation, but also a spirit of tolerance.\r\nWe must not tolerate only one minority and ignore the\r\nothers. Anti-Semitism, anti-Islamism, anti-Arabism,\r\nanti-Europeanism, anti-Americanism and even anti-\r\nglobalism ought to be equally and totally rejected.\r\nBulgaria welcomes the progressive reintegration\r\nof Libya into the international community. However, my\r\ncountry believes that a compelling message from the\r\nLibyan authorities about their respect for human rights\r\nand human values could only be communicated through a\r\njust solution to the well-known case of the medical\r\nworkers  six Bulgarians and one Palestinian  who\r\nhave been held behind bars in Tripoli and Benghazi for\r\nalmost six years. In this regard, we call upon the\r\nUnited Nations to redouble its efforts in the fight\r\nagainst the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa, which we\r\nbelieve is the cause of these tragic developments\r\nconcerning these seven innocent people.\r\nBulgaria regards issues concerning women,\r\nchildren and persons belonging to vulnerable groups of\r\nthe population, including elderly and disabled persons,\r\nas inseparable parts of the entire complex of human\r\nrights. The Bulgarian Government fully supports the\r\nstrict implementation of the documents of the World\r\nConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,\r\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance, the twenty-\r\nseventh special session of the General Assembly on\r\nchildren, the World Assembly on Ageing, as well as the\r\nongoing efforts of the international community to draft\r\nand adopt a convention on the protection of the rights\r\nand dignity of disabled persons.\r\nThe measures aimed at revitalizing all the\r\nactivities of the United Nations are of extraordinary\r\nimportance for the current session of the General\r\nAssembly. The effectiveness of the work of United\r\nNations bodies, particularly the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, is fundamental for solidifying the all-around\r\nrole of this world Organization. The sooner we do it,\r\nthe better, and all the more so since next year we will\r\nbe celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations. Let us hope that we will at that time be able to\r\ncongratulate ourselves on the adoption of these badly\r\nneeded reforms. Taking all this into consideration and\r\nacting on the basis of the political will of all Member\r\nStates, as declared at the Millennium Summit, we give\r\nour support to the common efforts for speeding up\r\nUnited Nations reform and for strengthening the ties and\r\ncoordination among the United Nations, the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and the World Trade Organization.\r\nThe United Nations plays a principal and pivotal\r\nrole in the Republic of Bulgarias foreign policy, as\r\nstated at the fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly by our Prime Minister, Mr. Simeon Saxe-\r\nCoburg-Gotha. To this end, we shall continue our\r\nefforts to promote the role of the United Nations and\r\nenhance its efficiency and organizational structure in\r\norder to promote peace, development, democracy and\r\nthe rule of law.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to Sheikh Mohammad Al-Sabah Al-\r\nSalem Al-Sabah, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nState of Kuwait.\r\nMr. Al-Sabah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I am\r\npleased to convey my congratulations to the President\r\nelected to the fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly. I likewise take this opportunity to express\r\nour appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for the great efforts he has been exerting to\r\nrestructure and reform the United Nations, to improve\r\nits methods of work and revitalize its role in all fields\r\nin order to face the demands and challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nReform and restructuring of the United Nations\r\nsystem have become imperatives, since this world\r\nOrganization remains the ideal mechanism to address\r\nthe urgent problems of the world, by way of combating\r\npoverty and hunger, ensuring the non-proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, achieving disarmament\r\nand resolving armed conflicts, combating diseases that\r\ntake the lives of millions, such as AIDS and malaria.\r\nThe United Nations has organized numerous\r\ninternational conferences and summits in the last 10\r\nyears, such as the Millennium Summit, the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg\r\nand the International Conference on Financing for\r\n50\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nDevelopment in Monterrey to address those\r\nmultilateral problems. The international community\r\nmay not have been able to achieve enough progress in\r\naddressing some of these issues, but this should not\r\nprevent us from redoubling our efforts to implement\r\nthe international treaties, resolutions and programmes\r\nof action of such United Nations conferences. This\r\nmust be done in order to ensure respect for the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter, international\r\nlaw, the central role of the United Nations and its\r\nprimacy in preserving international peace and security\r\nand in the strengthening of international cooperation in\r\nthe economic, social and cultural spheres.\r\nTerrorism is one of the major challenges the\r\nUnited Nations faces in this millennium. Its negative\r\neffects are extremely serious and touch upon all States\r\nwithout exception, although to varying degrees.\r\nTerrorist attacks such as those of 11 September 2001,\r\nthe attacks against the brotherly kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia and the events in Jakarta and Beslan emphasize\r\nthe fact that this phenomenon affects us all. Its targets are\r\nall peoples of the world, not any one State in particular.\r\nWe must, therefore, cooperate fully and\r\ncollectively in addressing the roots of terrorism and not\r\nsimply deal with its tragic effects. Kuwait has endorsed\r\nall of the United Nations resolutions to combat\r\nterrorism. Terrorism, however, is not related to any one\r\nethnic group, culture or religion. It is an international\r\nphenomenon that must be addressed by the United\r\nNations, as the ideal framework for diagnosing its\r\ncauses and arriving at the necessary solutions needed\r\nto contain it.\r\nA year and a half after the fall of Saddam\r\nHusseins dictatorship, the situation in Iraq continues\r\nto be a delicate one of uncertainty and insecurity, due\r\nto terrorist acts carried out by armed groups and the\r\nremnants of the old regime. This is hampering the\r\nefforts of the interim Iraqi Government, which is\r\nendeavouring to rebuild what the old regime destroyed\r\nthrough its policy of aggression.\r\nConvinced as we are that security and stability in\r\nIraq mean security for the region as a whole, Kuwait\r\nsupports the efforts of the Iraqis to rebuild their\r\ncountry in these difficult times, so that Iraq may\r\nresume its positive international and regional roles. We\r\nare sure that the Iraqi people will be able to do this. In\r\nthat regard, we support Security Council resolution\r\n1546 (2004), which supports the effort that everyone\r\nwishes to see, namely, the preservation of Iraqs\r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and unity. Kuwait\r\nsupports the interim Government of Iraq, which is\r\nexpressing the will of the Iraqi people to build a\r\ntolerant Iraq that cares about peace, based upon\r\ndemocracy, the building of constitutional institutions\r\nand respect for and pursuit of its internal political\r\nprocess, which would be embodied in the\r\nestablishment of the Iraqi National Congress that\r\nwould build such institutions, formulate a new\r\nconstitution, and conduct new and free elections.\r\nKuwait aspires to strong brotherly relations with the\r\nnew, free Iraq, based on mutual respect, good\r\nneighbourliness, respect for bilateral agreements and\r\nresolutions under international law.\r\nWe welcome, likewise, the creation of a tribunal\r\nfor former military officers responsible for crimes\r\nagainst the Iraqi people and the people of Kuwait\r\ncommitted during the invasion of Kuwait, as well as\r\nfor the killing of Kuwaiti prisoners of war and third-\r\ncountry persons.\r\nWe express our appreciation to the United\r\nNations and international and regional organizations \r\nsuch as the Non-Aligned Movement, the Organization\r\nof the Islamic Conference, the League of Arab States\r\nand the Gulf Cooperation Council  for their support\r\nand their condemnation of the old regime, which killed\r\nprisoners of war and concealed that crime for more\r\nthan a decade in flagrant violation of international\r\nhumanitarian law. We also thank the interim\r\nGovernment, which is seeking to investigate what has\r\nhappened to those prisoners of war.\r\nWe are following with great concern the tragic\r\nsituation faced by the Palestinian people in the occupied\r\nArab territories as a result of Israeli policies and practices\r\nthat contravene international and humanitarian law.\r\nWe reaffirm our support to the struggle of the\r\nPalestinian people and their legitimate claim to recover\r\ntheir political rights. We therefore call upon Israel to\r\nrespect Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338\r\n(1973), and 1515 (2003), the principle of land for\r\npeace, the road map and the dismantling of the racial\r\nseparation wall. That is part of our integral vision for\r\nresolving the situation in the Middle East, which must\r\nbe based on mutual respect and cooperation between\r\nall parties.\r\nTo ensure stability in the Middle East, we must\r\nalso work to eradicate weapons of mass destruction,\r\n51\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nand all parties need to pursue the path of understanding\r\nand dialogue to implement the noble principles of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations governing inter-State\r\nrelations and relations among the peoples of the world.\r\nWe reiterate, in that regard, that the dispute between\r\nthe United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran concerning the three islands that belong to the\r\nEmirates should be resolved by peaceful means. We\r\nurge the two parties to resolve that dispute as rapidly as\r\npossible.\r\nRegarding Darfur, we are all concerned about the\r\nhumanitarian tragedy there. We believe that the Sudan\r\nis striving to find a reasonable solution to that\r\nhumanitarian dilemma.\r\nKuwait is pursuing international and regional\r\nefforts to achieve peace and security in both\r\nAfghanistan and Somalia, which for many years have\r\nsuffered from a lack of authority and the deterioration\r\nof their economic and political situation owing to the\r\nconflicts between various local forces and factions. We\r\nsupport the good offices of the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations that have made progress\r\npossible at the political level. We hope that those\r\nefforts will continue so that national reconciliation in\r\nthose brotherly nations can be achieved.\r\nThe information revolution and the vast\r\ntechnological progress in the areas of trade and\r\ncommunications have brought about interdependence.\r\nThe world has become a little village, every corner of\r\nwhich can now be reached. Many States, and\r\ndeveloping countries in particular, have therefore\r\nundergone fundamental changes in their economic\r\nframework in order to take advantage of the\r\nphenomenon of economic globablization and ensure\r\nprogress and development for their peoples. Despite\r\nthe benefits of those policies, such as the liberalization\r\nof international trade and the lowering of tariff\r\nbarriers, many countries, especially the least developed\r\namong them, are suffering from marginalization and\r\nmany aggravated social problems, such as poverty,\r\nhunger and the spread of diseases resulting from the\r\ndeterioration of their economies. For that reason, we\r\ncall upon the international financial institutions, and\r\nthe World Trade Organization in particular, to give\r\nspecial attention to the developing countries and to\r\nconsider providing financial support to improve their\r\neconomic and social situations. We call upon the\r\ndeveloped countries to increase their development\r\nassistance, to open access to their markets, and to\r\nreduce the debt burden of the developing countries so\r\nthat they are able to strengthen their economic\r\ninfrastructure.\r\nKuwait continues to support development\r\nprojects in many developing countries through regional\r\nand international institutions and organizations, as well\r\nas through the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic\r\nDevelopment, which we had the honour of establishing\r\nover four decades ago and through which we have\r\nprovided more than $11 billion to over 100 countries.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit our leaders laid out\r\nthe paths to be followed and goals to be attained. Let us\r\nwork together to achieve a better future for all peoples.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Vuk Draković, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia and Montenegro.\r\nMr. Draković (Serbia and Montenegro) (spoke\r\nin Serbian; English text provided by the delegation):\r\nAllow me at the outset to convey the greetings and best\r\nwishes of the people of my country to Member States\r\nand their people, and to the Secretary-General.\r\nWar, oppression, crime, hatred and suffering\r\nplague hundreds of millions of men and women all\r\nover the world today. In pursuit of the ideals of peace,\r\ndemocracy and happiness, the United Nations is the\r\nunited conscience of humankind. In order to achieve\r\nthe goals of the Millennium Declaration, our\r\nOrganization must be strengthened structurally,\r\neconomically and spiritually.\r\nSerbia and Montenegro therefore supports both\r\nthe initiatives for the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil, that based on the need for equal\r\nrepresentation of all continents, and that which\r\nconcedes a special role for the most developed\r\ncountries, without whose support the United Nations\r\nwould be unable to fulfil its noble goals.\r\nThe fight against global terrorism in all its\r\nmanifestations, such as anti-Semitism and anti-\r\nIslamism, is our primary responsibility today. Those\r\nwho perpetrated, masterminded and bankrolled terrorist\r\natrocities in New York, Washington, Moscow, Beslan,\r\nJerusalem, Madrid, Istanbul and other places have not\r\nonly declared war against all nations, but also against\r\nGod himself, who is the same God for all people.\r\nIn the fight against terrorism, force is\r\nunavoidable, but prevention is what we need most.\r\n52\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nPoliticians, international religious and spiritual leaders\r\nand the media must constantly emphasize that the\r\nkilling of children and of innocent civilians are crimes\r\nthat the terrorists are perpetrating against their own\r\nreligions and nations and that God will neither forgive\r\nthem nor reward them with paradise for such crimes.\r\nMultilateralism is the only means to prevent the\r\ncatastrophe of the clash between faiths and\r\ncivilizations. At the same time, terrorism must be\r\ncondemned with equal resolve by everyone. There can\r\nbe no acceptable terrorists, nor should terrorists be\r\nproclaimed as freedom fighters anywhere.\r\nSerbia and Montenegro is a small country that has\r\nbeen confronted with most of the worlds current\r\nproblems and misfortunes. The recent wars that saw the\r\nbreak-up of Yugoslavia  one of the founding members\r\nof the United Nations  have had immense and painful\r\nconsequences: unemployment; poverty; the tragic\r\nplight of some 600,000 refugees; hopelessness among\r\nyoung people, which breeds drug dependence; a rising\r\nsuicide rate; and the desperate position of Serbs in\r\nKosovo and Metohija.\r\nThe reality of Kosovo and Metohija today is both\r\ndramatic and grim. Over the past five years, the\r\ninternational administration and dominance of the\r\nAlbanian majority of this Serbian province have led to\r\nthe killing or abduction of more than 2,500 Serbs,\r\nincluding many children, and to the destruction of\r\n1,500-year-old churches and monasteries and\r\napproximately 40,000 homes. As a result of terrorism\r\nand massive violations of basic human rights, nearly\r\n200,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians have been\r\nexpelled from Kosovo and Metohija.\r\nThe hopes of suffering victims are directed\r\ntowards the United Nations, particularly its bodies and\r\nspecialized agencies. I take this opportunity to express\r\nmy most profound gratitude to the Secretary-General\r\nand to the Director-General of UNESCO for the\r\ndecision to convene, in November, an international\r\ndonor conference aimed at funding the reconstruction\r\nof destroyed churches and monasteries in Kosovo. We\r\nare also grateful for the principled position that all\r\nhomes must be rebuilt, that conditions must be created\r\nfor the return of all of those who have been expelled\r\nand that the Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija must be\r\nguaranteed the right to life and to freedom of\r\nmovement and all civil, national and religious freedoms.\r\nThe spirit of a united Europe and a united world\r\nlives in the hearts of Serbs and Montenegrins. While\r\nwe respect the existing State borders that we share with\r\nour neighbours, we wish to erase them in everyday life\r\nand to build a common European future based on\r\ndialogue, reconciliation and equality among all nations.\r\nWe are fully confident that, with the strong support of\r\nthe United Nations, we will attain that goal.\r\nBut the insistence by some on the creation of a\r\nsovereign State of Kosovo amounts to a call for the\r\nbreak-up of the sovereign State of Serbia and\r\nMontenegro. Such an objective breeds new hatred and\r\nmisery and is contrary to the basic tenets of\r\ninternational law and to the Charter of the United\r\nNations. We will not agree to the violation of the rights\r\nof our State and its citizens.\r\nBy applying consistent standards in addressing all\r\ncrimes, the United Nations will assist the efforts of the\r\ndemocratic Government in Serbia and Montenegro to\r\nfulfil our obligations to the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is something\r\nwe must do. The nation is innocent; responsibility rests\r\non the individual, and none of those who have been\r\nindicted for war crimes has the right to hold a nation\r\nhostage.\r\nAll of us on this planet are brothers and sisters.\r\nGens una sumus: we are all one family. Therefore, the\r\nprimary obligation of any majority, whether religious,\r\nracial or ethnic, is to fully protect the rights of\r\nminorities. I can assure the Assembly that my\r\nGovernment is unreservedly committed to that\r\nprinciple.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker in the general debate for\r\nthis meeting. I call on the representative of Spain, who\r\nwishes to speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I\r\nremind members that, in accordance with General\r\nAssembly decision 34/401, statements in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and five for the second and should be\r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Palacio (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): Yesterday,\r\nthe Spanish delegation listened attentively to the\r\nstatement of the Prime Minister of Equatorial Guinea,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Miguel Abia Biteo Boricó, before\r\nthe General Assembly. His words, as far as references to\r\nSpain are concerned, were received by my delegation\r\nwith astonishment. The extremely grave accusations\r\n53\r\nA/59/PV.8\r\nmade against Spain  that it supposedly participated with\r\nfinancing and logistical support in an attempted coup\r\ndétat in Equatorial Guinea last March  are\r\nunacceptable in every respect. Those accusations,\r\nwhich Spain vigorously rejects, are being made\r\nrepeatedly by members of the Government of\r\nEquatorial Guinea without having thus far presented to\r\nthe Assembly or to any other forum the slightest\r\nevidence to support them.\r\nMany times, the Spanish Government has denied,\r\nbefore the Government of Equatorial Guinea, any\r\ninvolvement in the facts reported and has reaffirmed\r\nour strong commitment to ensure that no activities are\r\ncarried out from Spanish territory that seek to\r\ndestabilize or overthrow any foreign Government by\r\nviolent or anti-democratic means.\r\nSpain maintains friendly relations with all\r\ncountries of the world and, of course, with Equatorial\r\nGuinea, based on the principles of international law,\r\namong them respect for sovereignty and non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of other States. The\r\nSpanish delegation takes this opportunity to reaffirm\r\nour Governments willingness to maintain the best\r\nrelations of friendship and cooperation with the\r\nauthorities of Equatorial Guinea. We believe that\r\nsufficient channels exist between the two Governments\r\nto appropriately address and resolve any issue that may\r\nbe a source of concern.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I call\r\non the representative of Equatorial Guinea, who wishes\r\nto speak on a point of order.\r\nMs. Nchama Nsue (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): On the basis of the statement in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply just made by the representative of\r\nSpain concerning the statement made yesterday by my\r\ncountrys Prime Minister before the General Assembly,\r\nmy delegation reserves the right to present a reply,\r\nwhich will be made at the appropriate time.\r\nThe meeting rose at 8.30 p.m.\r\n"
